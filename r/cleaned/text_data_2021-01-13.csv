Edit: link here: Sure may true heman body humans ü§îü§î actually skeptical one shot announced starting trial two shots well. Seriously though, what? started vaccinating people 65+ places. There's 50 million people age bracket probably going take enough vaccinated start reducing daily deaths. Kids can‚Äôt vaccinated. It‚Äôs approved 16 17. Anyone teenager (or friend / family member teenager) NY, TX, UT, MN, ID?

Moderna currently running clinical trial administer covid vaccine kids ages 12-17 (this one administered adults now, new trial see safe effective kids). 

Slaoui said press conference yesterday trouble recruiting enough volunteers, maybe info super hidden, here's list locations recruiting: page says 'not recruiting yet', that's false, various locations signing people different channels, example here's link Houston: Isn‚Äôt purpose prioritizing teacher vaccination reopen in-person schooling? Otherwise go others aren‚Äôt/can‚Äôt work home. Nothing makes money like continuous! really appreciate sentiment, reality young people like (30) able get vaccine sooner go without. Please, us favor take turn! offense taken; completely correct. Rams super bowl pats years back, majority friends LA idea team super bowl. dealing larger logistics network, one would needed handle large population, fact life going problems. There's higher chance something going wrong one many, many points. place like South Dakota Vermont many ""points"" - hospitals, distribution centers, drivers, trucks, etc. - compared California. get vaccinated? state several months! ""Non-nationals"" sounds way broad. hope lazy translation. non-national residents? people work/spousal/etc visas? Asking seriously. actively search proof agenda always find it. make correct.

Your videos prove existance crowded areas certain places certain times. says nothing *what normal* *how differs before*. Anecdotal arguments inherently flawed, never base argument them.

I could easily go film empty street claim ""everybody staying home"".  Yes correct. simplified it. vaccine contains RNA wich like blueprint protein. cells use RNA produce protein. skipped step first comment. change point. I‚Äôm curious vaccination would exempt tested. gorillas/tigers. It‚Äôs crazy many people willing vaccine 2023+. It‚Äôs like think life pauses stay shutdown can‚Äôt die things process... No. FFS. Figure kind dual system prioritize also distribute leftover anyone everyone wants them, reverse age order. week standby list might 75+, next week 65+, forth (adjust ""week"" longer depending vaccine supply). 

Don't pay stragglers hold everyone else cajole stragglers maybe finally taking vaccine. Article Text Below:

Contracting coronavirus gives ‚Äúat least good‚Äù immune defence future infections vaccine, according comprehensive study reinfection rates.

Previous illness provided 85 per cent protection asymptomatic symptomatic reinfection, researchers said following thousands people caught virus spring.

Although found small number among group get infected twice, typically suffered milder form disease.

With estimated one five infected, findings, based study 21,000 UK healthcare workers, suggested that¬†herd immunity¬†could already slowing course pandemic. However, scientists warned still know long immunity lasted.

‚ÄúWhat that‚Äôs saying¬†to us prior infection looks good vaccine, least time interval, good news population,‚Äù said Susan Hopkins, deputy director national infections service Public Health England (PHE). ‚ÄúIt help alongside vaccine give level immunity protection start reduce transmission.‚Äù

The research immunity PHE followed 6,600 clinical staff infected first wave, along 14,000 remained healthy, regularly testing see whether subsequently positive.

By late November 318 infections among 14,000 44 reinfections among 6,600. cases mild showed symptoms.

There uncertainty among¬†the reinfection number, may even lower. scientists said could exclude possibility cases picking evidence first infection.

Although¬†the Pfizer vaccine¬†has headline efficacy rate 95 per cent, figure based symptomatic infections alone, mildest cases ignored.

Professor Hopkins said best way think immunity infection good as, better than, vaccine.

‚ÄúThe immunity gives similar effects Pfizer vaccine, much better effects Astrazeneca vaccine, reassuring people,‚Äù said. Two doses Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine offer 62 per cent protection.

However, said licence ignore¬†social distancing. ‚ÄúIt seem new infections come. definitely get reinfected primary infection,‚Äù said added risk severe disease extremely low.

Simon Clarke, University Reading, said study ‚Äúmajor implications get current crisis‚Äù.

He said: ‚ÄúThe good news study gives weight [to belief] reinfections Covid rare, least stage, antibodies provide protection meaningful amount time, although may lifelong immunity.‚Äù Julian Tang, Leicester University, said hospitals became overwhelmed second wave, results ‚Äúreduce anxiety many healthcare worker colleagues concerns getting Covid-19 twice‚Äù.

The findings may also lead renewed calls infected moved queue vaccine. joint committee vaccination immunisation, decides vaccine priorities, previously resisted idea.

The researchers next want look effect vaccine previous infection.

This week Edge Health, data consultant, estimated 12.4 million people infected England, equivalent one five population.

Well that‚Äôs time I‚Äôd root Alabama lol Thanks this. non story. 

I'm frontline heath care worker works Covid patients major hospital required us. wish was.... 1 week Pfizer vaccine, issues far, anyone concerned. side effects minor arm pain. Yup. least. Lots media agencies making COVID content free (and since last March) even mean? Africa country!! That‚Äôs like saying: ‚ÄúEurope secures 270m doses‚Äù.


**Europe secures deal 400 million doses COVID-19 Doubles Supply Pfizer-BioNTech Covid depends read out. also call others SOL since possible could confer immunity form getting moderate severe case disease -- example, turn mild cold symptoms rather needing hospitalization, dying it. mother father law appointment January 22nd. THAT'S NEXT FREAKING FRIDAY GUYS!!! category smokers? sounds like saRNA produces mRNA, saRNA exhausted mRNA made, mRNA exhausted spike protein made. Please read article, equal idiots upvoting them. comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals lockdown. Feudal Japan 2.0 many variants COVID currently circulation? Also, whatever happened Cluster-5? RNA thing proteins can't state fact. *could* many gotten infected, that's guessing based limited data. know ~8% confirmed, anything beyond speculation, fact.

Months ago sub touting CDC statement could 10x confirmed infections fact. obviously know that's true since otherwise we'd rapidly approaching 100% infected. already received vaccine things back normal couple weeks after? explain mean? think misunderstand something here. genetic material changed fear. person attending in-person learning new lockdown January, envy brother's school.

Most clean desks, sanitise hands wear masks halls (I self-isolate December reasons like that). keep Pfizer Moderna shots seniors use single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine rest population. businesses afford to. We‚Äôre barely staying afloat is.... CPS administration brightest set minds world, never been. That's insane. Plenty rich folk Michigan ripe eating. spam comment repeatedly. I've since approach Thanksgiving, anticipating increased risk due holiday travel California. could work part time live 70 80k. That's enough live places pretty comfortably. He‚Äôs Joe Manchin donor.

Stop copy-pasting comment everywhere, dude. It‚Äôs spammy annoying. One day they'll advocating cats vaccinated since apparently get covid19 need ELI5 :( got lost percentages cohorts.

There's 90% number thrown around end. really effective rate single shot?!?! probably true. people habit stick. I've read posts ppl say like masks. headline likely mislead many, that's headlines for. Ireland California 14 day rate. 1448 vs 1,452. teachers getting vaccinated soon sisters there(Canadian teaching English) past three years. basically happening different regions. supply distribution. latter clusterfuck, far. confidence Feb. 15 enough time teachers get shots.

If they'd set goals teacher vaccination rates tied school reopenings that, it'd one thing. would make feel like actually plan. instead, declared schools reopening Feb. 15 later said, hindsight, ""oh, suppose teachers get vaccines, too."" commenting done far remote learning vs person want input model place remote learning mean it‚Äôs successful whatsoever. I've yet speak parent who's kids anything going motions online school learning thing.  seems like needs reiterated time:

Tuesday Wednesday numbers always higher due reporting done. Tuesday numbers Sweden report Sat-Mon, Wednesday registers cross-checked find previously unreported deaths.

There also extra reporting lag currently due Christmas holidays backlog then. see actual numbers deaths predicted increase, see note Sweden reports deaths death date report date. means looking Worldometers, always look like deaths decreasing - even not. Therefore recommend looking link instead.

As example headline misleading, deadliest day yet Sweden whole pandemic (according statistics available currently) Dec 17 **just 120 deaths**. Sick pay days often lead issues. Often itnincentivizes people come sick save sick days vacation time said ""The pandemic USA 2021."" Whether true depends production J&amp;J acceptance. 50% adults get vaccinated (never mind young children even approved 2022 likely) probably woods matter much vaccine produced.

I'm saying that's likely (we'll probably hit acceptance rate). think always limiting step, even J&amp;J. abstract:

No, protein vaccine like key virus uses get cells. produce keys body learn recognize soon real virus cell uses key immune system triggered. whole Virus lot one protein. Sure has. sure voted that. Take +1. problem reservation doses second shot.

The feds holding back doses ensure everyone got second shot case supply disruption. May make sense scenarios, bit weird manufacturers saying worries, go ahead send out, got this.

As side effect clear states true future allocation vaccines were. ALSO kept second dose back.

And make matters worse, hospitals same.

They've changed tactics generally letting lower levels handle second dose allocations, thus lot freeing up. parts logistics (mainly trained people admin monitor) going quickly become bottleneck. people don‚Äôt know better (and that‚Äôs fault). majority country doesn‚Äôt medical science background, flat don‚Äôt know difference wasn‚Äôt properly conveyed almost year ago. Sure, probably know N95 mask much protective, also told reserved healthcare workers aren‚Äôt available. told make own, purchase (anywhere now).  site posts CDC numbers day. Scroll 2/3 see daily numbers. Tell NZ, Vietnam, South Korea, Iceland, Finland, Bahamas. parents 80s live California, haven‚Äôt able get vaccinated. They‚Äôve called local hospitals doctors daily nobody vaccine. 

What‚Äôs point announcing people get vaccinated even vulnerable people haven‚Äôt chance? means anyone insists medical condition get it.

I'm speculating, almost certainly check medical records even effortless get medical diagnosis. Plus almost everyone already legit claim medical diagnosis.

Please stop using word ‚Äúrushed,‚Äù technology makes vaccines possible developed decade, final stages happening within last year. Genome sequencing also cut much time traditional vaccine development would take Seems like smaller states handling better, pretty obvious issues scale. understand, would hope OP trying convey image article actually way understand.

1. Johnson &amp; Johnson RNA vaccine. thinking Moderna Pfizer. 

2. RNA can't converted back DNA cells. RNA short-lived. makes protein permanently degraded. mUcH gEt PaId iT? /s  Look 9/11 cost country medical costs.

We'll able start putting behind us year. disease. species worse. Thanks! Going make calls tomorrow see get signed. CDC guidelines high risk categories help make case Science question someone knows me, would happen RNA wasn‚Äôt effective vacccines instead already broken down, absolutely nothing would body produce antibodies fight broken RNA cells, something entirely different? Perhaps. point, nonetheless, OP's title calling ""prison-style conference rooms"" biased. seem trying best deal covid, applauded efforts. Plenty professions required come work.

Miraculously, despite months lying, hospital systems collapsing, bars restaurants open months now, people travelling prepandemic levels, they've built enormous infrastructure quarantine people border considerable expense, they're testing rejecting shipments food countries contaminated they're exporting vast amounts medical equipment medication keeping much domestically.

The way China fought pandemic simply compatible 100% transparent. Every case contact traced extensively, [their movements highlighted hotspots mapping since February 2020, entire cities tested there's positive case detected movement restrictions enforced, within proximity case, everyone else free move normal.

Masks became political issue, that, comment progressive sites like Reddit explaining cloth masks barely work N95 masks better downvoted attacked progressives saw accurate information attack progressive ideals.

And isn‚Äôt like could go non-progressive sites post information don‚Äôt care masks all. Well... new normal. old normal people could easily travel wait Covid beaten worldwide. would cut profits tho.

Same say vaccine effective 1 year. Denmark five medical regions (besides Greenland Faroe Islands), would say fairly centralised - especially regarding national databases.

Well, like totalitarianism, good you. BTW, countries like North Korea 0 case. may consider migrating one effective countries enjoy life.  France considering 'night clock' 6 PM 6 AM. night clock, fucking day clock. Absolutely insane. Night clock=curfew bit less - 2,996 people died 9/11. every day 200 days we'd 599,200 dead people. Still though, 400k horrific makes lose hope America. science, potential, one biggest fails world because...politics attention spans. Talk shooting foot. $$$ one question: get vaccine protected regardless anti- vaxxers do? longer care them. make choice live die with. Main argument hear anti-vaxxers imposible make vaccine fast needs 5 years.

There many info bother read. take control people‚Äôs lives, also take responsibility them. 10-20% population COVID, immunity ignored here. Even starting great company stuff 20 something year olds.

Michael Bloomberg Jeff Bezos would like word take info coming Beijing Washington huge grain salt days. probably right, conviction would difficult.

Reading news watching anti-maskers storm random grocery stores state, already lacking ICU resources, serve make incredibly incensed. Well lucky go good schools, no, experience.

I think exactly right. Coupled fact (rightly wrongly, many people really statistically minor threat) lot people see COVID serious risk personally, USA culture promotes individual ""me me"" looking things society-wide level. tough get continue take precautions protect others. Also, even people taking things super seriously getting tired aspects (the distancing family friends especially seems grating lot people, understandably so). think realizing despite national headlines - much impact local level - area, would never know anything different despite masks - schools open, sports back, restaurants open, many sick, there's huge fatigue level sure. mirror.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Europe fucked vaccine supply distribution. They‚Äôre mess. me. I'll get vaccine available, first one line. I'll wait several months. Isn‚Äôt covid costs covered treatment? started Thanksgiving  trails sporadically wild night crazy orgies fueled cocktail drugs alcohol ‚Äòshrooms? Asymptomatic seems like likely reason. much likely test false positive. speaking chances however. 100 people experience, 99 asymptomatic 1 false positive (not real numbers). Still means could 1 person. likely one 99. Without tests, would asume asymptomatic since best bet. even looks like Q follower. self-entitled gaze reeks conspiracy theorist. Ew. I‚Äôm honestly thin ice probably, since I‚Äôve barely functional multi week stretches due anxiety insomnia. 

So yeah starting fight customer spend 95% time would bad move. they‚Äôre Fortune 500 company.

Technically authority ‚Äústop job‚Äù unsafe work practices. would go like lead balloon. Death appropriate punishment things people jail for. 

I keep distance people. control wash hands. got check well. /s cannot wait hear China wants us hear Certainly ignoring lol. try discuss someone wouldn‚Äôt blatantly ignore order unless want risk fired  two separate trials, regulatory submission separate. point, makes sense go ahead 1 dose strategy, wait approval, go there. approved, either keep 2 dose study (and submit regular approval) abandon study altogether. Getting two dose vaccine everyone every year likely gonna challenging it‚Äôs gonna make harder society ever move pandemic. Thanks Oh, 100% malicious. knowingly intended cause harm ""prove"" point. Apparently according ex-wife he's kind nutty evangelical top that. Exactly. young significant amount travel live big city, day get Covid related coronavirus. guarantee vaccine protect every variant, better odds favor. 

I don‚Äôt like viruses attack nerves cardiovascular system. bueno. *January 27th, 2021: Jesus Comes Back! See's shadow fucks right back again, 20 years apocalypse.* I'm expert. posted link experts critical paper. Im sure guys think gonna happen point, people gonna die, drastic shutdowns again, unemployment spike human misery incalculable, remaining businesses open again, another $2-3T stimulus? That's like $6T year, like 25% total debt country. point, its' over, deal deaths, sucks, worried loved ones, can, need move here, we're talking decades recovery point 15% bump annual deaths. hard say depends several factors. However, generally speaking, old population carehomes logistically hardest slowest group vaccinate, next phases vaccination plans go smoother.

Much depends JJ, AZ get approved. Could March. Could April. Could May. Quit shit. vaccine cleared safety checks administered yet. may clear checks May. mean like taught public school? (YMMV experience) That's almost half state's population. bother? open *everyone* 16 older. Which, IMO, makes sense currently doses wasted we're vaccinating people fast enough. Releasing logs log jam helpful. work, get it. Especially considering government done fuck help supplement people work. I'm still waiting get PUA money.

But go life ""normal"" family risk assessment, blatant negligent. mean respecting proper protocols like mask wearing, distancing, general hygiene workplace public.

Many families dual income families, yet parents continue work, send kids school, to, want to. God forbid one make sacrifice help kids instead contributing spread disease. many schools properly set manage kids safely, fault theirs, (again) lack government support.

I'm single parent two kids, care elderly mother. need working. I'm not. safety family community important. could easily let 11 12 year old fend 9-10 hrs day go work, hope online courses burn house down. don't. retirement money said done, myself, kids, parents come healthy end. Obviously guarantee, least I've done could.

We lost one family member (on side state) due COVID sister (who lives another state altogether) deathly ill two weeks, shockingly, physically fit active healthy. affected first hand, say shit real. that's part problem think. real many even best intentions think is. can't blame them. losing family member, thinking know anyone sick, even real? hit home. Hard. Maybe right motive really clear beyond malicious. like year later? Slow clap WHO. Slow clap CHINA. Slow clap TRUTH even though simple comment illustrating good point, types comments spamming many posts - Britain‚Äôs former world number one Andy Murray doubtful next month‚Äôs Australian Open organisers confirmed Thursday tested positive new coronavirus. players, allowed spend five hours outside rooms quarantine training purposes tested daily virus, play warm-up events Melbourne Park Jan. 31 Australian Open starts. Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, currently ranked 123rd world, pulled season-opening Delray Beach Open Florida earlier month reduce risk contracting COVID-19. still blows mind we're wasting time trying give vaccine young people want millions elderly people practically begging it.

Stop wasting time healthcare workers. time waste them, people die. Melbourne differently we're currently Europe..? Europe disagrees yeah probably true US Authoritarianism perks, yes.  go state board council 1-7 board members (depending state) look case get provide supporting evidence. probably open closed case though honest you.  Ok, question: EU give enough vaccines, doesnt take 2 weeks vaccinate 1% population, meant First reported 9 months ;)  dogma virology natural immunity always better vaccine. Whoever tells different story either corrupt study well. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Chinese government would like know location Businesses love hiding behind bullshit CDC guidelines Actual cases.

That exponential growth. Never.

There thing like EU vaccine rollout. every nation state EU vaccination program, Denmark fast, France slow, Germany moderate speed etc...

However, AZ JJ ever get approved, course would speed things quite considerable. Like leader country spewing lies national TV nearly 4 years? That's literally exactly happened J&amp;J blatantly didnt said would filter outgoing air too? Per CDC, it‚Äôs 10 days start symptoms, long they‚Äôre improving fever. mother come quarantine Sunday.

This good way use information. understand panic ""vaccine-deniers"". supply issue issue even 6 months. think it'll take year vaccinate ""willing"" people.

I looking forward vaccination I'd say available everyone today. said, I'd feel easier get vaccine used 100m+ people last 6 months. It'd show safe option people.

I know common meme thing say, almost year crap, confidently say Reddit news, know COVID exists. America. Studies shown triple layer cotton mask(study released CBC still website effectiveness masks) quite effective. issues that, triple layer cotton mask new standard cloth masks single double layer nylon materials still quite popular.

Again agree misinformation lack government guidance issue culprit. Well deserved! Sounds fair. already influenced existing administration release doses faster. think so. licensing board suspended license, meaning ban temporarily **Br**eaking **Kr**aut. Distribution plans written funding

Despite people subreddit think, lots people enjoy wearing masks avoiding people. prospect another year unthinkable.

In last week I've literally tuned politics COVID talk ultimately taking massive toll mental health literally zero effect personally.

Biden gonna president week. COVID gonna continue existing vaccine rolls out.

Seriously though jokes aside city part weekly sewer testing pretty good predicting rise fall covid levels community. I've seen they've taken proactive approach it. levels wastewater go up, free testing clinics usually pop well. really smart way track infections within city, really hope communities keep viruses well. really could beneficial. Wear mask step house. simple.  Obviously non valved mask superior. open valved still reduces emitted particles levels similar cloth masks. vaccinated group we're seeing 50% reduction spread? bad. Similar Pfizer/Moderna 95% similar AstraZeneca 64% ? little late, eh? It‚Äôs disgrace gets released week vaccines rolled out. long known report suppressed? sacrificed futures young people save bunch soon dead dodderers. 

The vast majority working population never needed lose jobs livelihoods. needed legally enforced stay home vulnerable people support them, vaccine developed whilst rest us allowed get lives, face exceptionally low lethality disease. Instead 90% U.K. locked down, figure would low 20%. Sorry uninformed. mink fiasco? Evidence China creating virus military weapon could trigger world war. plenty reasons keep evidence public handle diplomacy instead.

Hopefully another lie Trump. state, however, follow federal guidance calling individuals 16 65 medical conditions eligible vaccine. California individuals next tier. 

Fuck newsom Thanks link. question claimed best protection comes placing piece surgical tape inside valve...effectively making non-valved respirator? Unless mean one strip sufficient allowing air around exit valve? want schools open?!  Problem respirators filtered breathing open valve release, breathing non filtered spraying particulate

As edit - take look [this good job explaining viral latency. Specifically, virus latent, ""the full viral genome retained host cell"" - think there's *any* chance scientists studying year seen now? paper also explains primarily herpes retro viruses exhibit this. There's mention coronaviruses anywhere, coronaviruses this. 

And finally, even somehow latent evidence, big deal. Chickenpox mono latent - freak those? virtually people end hospital Covid vaccinated first number people hospital would plummet. would make Covid like flu terms societal impact exceptions.

Therefore people sanitizing literally everything seems overkill. Surely helps, increasing risk disorders cancers due chemical exposure beyond ""typical"" limits. know covid shamers think trying kill things. Others feel washing hands wearing surgical mask enough. Side note. friend mine that's PA said single flu case hospital first time tenure DIDNT ASK COVID EXCESS DEATHS.. ASKED COVID PERIOD?

The way lack basic math! Don‚Äôt confuse prevention disease (symptoms) infection (having/shedding virus positive result potentially subsequent transmission occur). thats everything

I‚Äôm ears anyone better/additional info prospective timeline. NYC, caught early March Christmas (MIL brought whole house. children, grandchildren, everyone. furious). definitely get twice.  Kinda makes sense they‚Äôre trying get hospitalizations preserve ICU capacity. Perhaps that‚Äôs short-term justification, let‚Äôs hope works. going death spiral. LOL Way encourage people disclose COVID... thought way would go beginning. NY, spring. turned slow. think lot people felt inevitable, would ravage cities one one like this. think possible ""thrive"" following restrictions. friends family outside household thriving. terrible.

Sure, that's possible. someone make comment first place, they? clearly number real humans making comments, crazy think real humans upvoting downvoting too. people claim opposing opinion upvotes/downvotes due bots help argument all. Cuuuz smart people substance abuse issues? Lol sure thing sport. would encourage people get tested interest informing anyone contact positive test.

More importantly, Dr. Cristakis' rebuttal illustrates point making. got much smaller education-mortality association estimate European datasets, mostly came Norway Sweden, decided calculate US's estimate separately, mortality-education association 2 countries, robust social protections, strong vocational programs, meaningful income equality, universal health care, unlikely good model association education mortality US, structural supports.

The fact hundreds thousands people die winter super fucked up. required badass, requires compassionate. estimated months ago 10% world already infected, yet date handful documented reinfections. That's considerably better vaccine's claimed 95% efficacy.

Depends rollout Novavax/J&amp;J/Oxford. 

I googling saw Pfizer, like Moderna, promising 100M doses March fyi.  leads us question states handled logistics poorly. states got right, rest not. means helping poor countries covid keeps mutating enough render vaccines ineffective, I'm gonna check out. can't live rest life like this. type 1 diabetic, advised wait vaccinated endocrinologist pcp. understand why's, encouraged wait continue quarantine. Yeah, they'll vaccinate players games without audience. That's what's going end happening. Looks like doesn‚Äôt apply la county :( great majority survives long rehab, kept tracheostomy weeks end

There's reason answered ""yes"" comorbidity question (after checking obesity counted). feel kinda bad potentially displacing someone greater need, government decided equal need I'm volunteering wait longer force to.

Here go again. person requires 2 shots, 500 days summer 2022, least math

IF last person got shot day 250, they'd receive shot 2 day 271 278. sure taught math. one saying sweden embraces science

Nope, never said Sweden embracing masks mass?

FHM recently started recommending them. recommended earlier visibly, would've followed. one issues Swedish many excuses ambiguous answers?

What excuses ambiguous answers? evidence this? Agreed, I'm greedy vaccine worry plenty headlines telling everybody shit Florida, can't though mention filthy *gaijin* comments?

I disappoint. one sees photo petri dish? I'm tired ""but cases May"" people ""but muh backlog"" people.

When died change another 1,500 reported dying shit. matter died yesterday, last Tuesday, May.  may good people used breathing gas mask.   Keep hospital. Keep dieing. Keep becoming long haller. 

It good question sure lot people want ask. Seriously, that‚Äôs needed say: ‚ÄúCovid causes permanent erectile dysfunction almost male cases!!!‚Äù.

Surely taking public transport better taking public transport mask. sources claim public transport usage cut half. something wrong sources, give articulate response *what* wrong *why* proof, ""it proof""?

With said, wish people *do* take public transport anyway would use mask.   dumb, loaded question discussing, defensive?. one saying sweden embraces science. that's true sweden embracing masks mass?. many excuses ambiguous answers reality nearly nobody wears face masks sweden?.

I trying make sweden look bad. post videos show real life sweden people see nearly nobody wears masks.

The article written cdc clear, aerosols spread covid therefore wearing face masks mandatory sweden. would put people's lives risk.

Then sweden listening science?. Health insurance companies can't deny you. Calories greater calories out. That's really it. self control issues EMT eating anything fast food sustainable unless packed something kept well (24 hour shifts fridge unpredictable schedules) great! Looking WaPo vaccine tracker, half Alabama's population ""prioritized."" Uh . . . word might mean think means. time vaccine widely available data mRNA's effects fertility, many people open then. According physicians, clinical trials Pfizer Moderna vaccines indicate first shot provided benefits 10 days administered, time second shot given month later, initial dose already 80 90 percent effective COVID-19. second dose adds effectiveness potentially makes immunity vaccine ‚Äúmore durable,‚Äù said. 

So, even though get second Moderna one month first, even point, second dose, first dose already 80-90% effective. second booster 80-90% damn good vaccine. could divide 90 30 say day gives us 3% vaccine effectiveness. 

Just kidding, don‚Äôt think works way it‚Äôs fun think about. effectiveness ramp time. think thing allocating doses tier, understand correctly. 2m healthcare workers 1a, reserving 4m doses cover first second dose vaccine 1a person. need think that. know SIR simulator web? complaint (unless really clue articulately read write), Biden couldn‚Äôt release president.

I‚Äôm sorry, college students don‚Äôt work people work home shouldn‚Äôt get yet.

For record, long I‚Äôm teaching remotely I‚Äôm happy stay ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt get it‚Äù category. patiently wait turn. want sooner seems we‚Äôre going back (which newsom wants).  Almost disturbing Sweden's horribly high death count, Swedes flock posts protect ""The Image Sweden"".

It's absurd... mean, we're also getting millions vaccinated along million immunity catching covid already. winter last big surge unless covid mutates enough make vaccines ineffective. Well Chinese article. Sorry always No, ‚Äúflattening curve‚Äù meant preserve hospital capacity already place spreading admissions. 

The surge hospitals plan B failed flatten said curve. around 950k lucky time quarantine period 14 days. later extended 14+7 (14 days facilities 7 days home). However, old woman left home 7-day period, led outbreak. China extended quarantine 21 days facilities.

The lesson is: never expect everyone cooperate home quarantine. Karens everywhere, China exception. No. managing outcomes Moderna's CEO stated corona stay. 

When get 1 dose vaccine efficacy chance infected lowered however likelyhood negative outcome infection infected (death permenantly disability) also lowered.

In trials showed 95% efficacy 5% luckily less severity.

The goal slow spread also diminish severity normal life resume. able eradicate it. Expanded, much. Uber driver getting 1/5th pay fucked. student fucked. wish headline read ""mandates"" ""allows"" Agreed, need official studies time tell Yeah I‚Äôm hospital worker know lots hospital nurses medical leave non-hospital affiliated medical personnel trying daily weeks get appointment. website usually says try back later.

For record: wish mask usage higher wish FHM would've started recommending masks earlier situations. mot discussing. interesting, practical way even put dent pandemic. might well launch OTC nasal disinfectant clinical trials going anywhere. much complexity involved dosing regimen. spray either works immediately, leaving long term efficacy keeps susceptible nasal aerosol infection minutes later, long term efficacy increases chances toxicity. There's much middle-ground. owned company, I'd try market nasal disinfectant allow people use see fit, never claiming efficacy prevention illness. "" British intelligence sources maintained available evidence suggests virus appears originated among wildlife. ""

Yes. raTG13 one former variants. WIV never publish sequence virus Jan.'20? found already seven years ago. needed inserts able infect humans. know kept secret? reach Wuhan? natural route, lab leak? dude, whatever doctors tell do. may make sense get vaccine, don‚Äôt random comments Reddit say should. Listen whatever doctor tells I'll show libs, I'll wear 1 EU much easier US. Sweden put border recently. Seems getting anywhere, guess nations Taiwan shit hole 4th world countries bodies pilling everywhere, according atleast. makes think that? Testing Sweden level European countries mortality also much average.

If mean dead/case exact day partially lot lag death reporting cases come quickly. said, CFR 3.1% quite standard. comparison UK 3.4% CFR today's numbers. Might end far less dangerous like 4 endemic hCoVs. people systemically protected (either infection vaccine) re-exposure likely result mild upper airway mucosal infection (common cold). Nice! know vaccine rumor mill, find info? Dude, hope fuck dead wrong! RNA DNA. genetics manipulated?

 worried too, crazy surges, feel like it‚Äôs matter time elderly parents get it.. wondering this. slow vaccine rollout been, varients made concerned this. It‚Äôs crazy they‚Äôre reporting better #s things like indoor schools, bars, restaurants, nightclubs, concerts open there. Live CA questioning whether makes sense stay long term now. Believe even vaccinations still restrictions years certain businesses. Born raised CA makes choice harder... They're really trained local governments money keep them, since rely lot sales tax (restaurants/bars) good worrying going do? careful. 

Also, every indication far vaccines protect variants. take years. hypotheses point. Based research, since virus shown jump across species, could see strains come diseases animals get covid, including: bats, apes, camels, pangolins, mink, domesticated animals cats dogs, lions, tigers, civets. 

I one really want mutate viruses rapidly kill cats dogs (if true). reminder, please keep things civil, please keep information quality high. Racist discourse acceptable sub, conspiracy theories.

Does Immun system respawn differently would deactivated virus vector virus?

True words forget companies refusing let office workers work home. That's happening, too. 40% 65 pre-diabetes (a term like, communicates point). 10% Americans aged 18 65 diagnosed diabetes. means 50% weakened immune systems. that's one disease. Layer immune system issues Covid 19 straw breaks camel's back. Former cancer survivors, asthmatics, inflammation issues, perhaps even people mild severe allergies.

The vast majority deaths people 60/65 (US: 261,000) vs (70,000), rate diabetes mirrors.

If see age photo, often person overweight:

[Age say two people diabetes, health issue, hell lot confirmation bias going on. assumptions exaggerated? Sure, I'm open generally wrong. general belief 50% Covid 19 carriers asymptomatic, vast majority people young probably fully functioning immune systems... someone diabetes that.

Also, older unhealthy people (I would fucking hope) successfully isolating social distancing. That's extended family seems doing. parents siblings high risk groups really locked down, whereas wife, daughter, low risk mostly lived life usual (of course, masks, social distancing, washing hands). I'm sure dad heart meds, mom 12 different meds (including meds diabetes) fare well. Hopefully they'll get vaccinated month.

The statistics really account human behavior, that's education economics (and history politics) comes use. can't look numbers say, 20%.... need account people smartly knowingly avoided getting Covid 19 thus far. job number clients/customers unhealthy and/or old dropped 90%, many people lessons via zoom/skype, still lessons face face. brother, wife, niece nephew telework.

California's Department Public Health expanding access COVID-19 vaccines everyone aged 65 older, allowing age group skip ahead eligibility queue. Los Angeles County won‚Äôt expanding access yet.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's move puts seniors ahead first responders, teachers, childcare providers food agriculture workers, slated receive vaccines health care workers nursing home residents.

In statement, governor said:

‚ÄúThere higher priority efficiently equitably distributing vaccines quickly possible face gravest consequences.‚Äù

But L.A. County won‚Äôt start 65+ group finishes vaccinating health care workers, Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said today. still 500,000 go, said, adding county doesn‚Äôt enough vaccines achieve goal finishing group‚Äôs immunizations end month.

So far, 200,000 health care workers nursing home residents gotten vaccinated, Ferrer said.

""I know frustrating must seem folks L..A County,"" said.

Ferrer said county asked state vaccines, expand 65+ age group sooner, yet heard back.

She expressed hope next week ‚Äúwe'll able enroll many providers many pharmacies [in vaccination effort], start advance booking appointments‚Äù seniors.

The state plans roll new email/text notification system next week let people know they're eligible receive vaccine, Gov. Newsom said.

Efforts ramping create mass vaccination sites across state, including Dodger Stadium Disneyland. Newsom said stadiums convention fairgrounds also converted vaccination sites.

The change California's vaccination plan comes day CDC recommended help speed inoculation process, criticized moving slowly. federal government also promised increase vaccine supply states. second half doses saved federal level, state level. states need focus getting needles arms asap. Also new plan stop saving second doses period. expecting slow downs vaccine production there's reason hold onto half them.  LA hasnt opened yet, yea keep looking, could change immediately. Here‚Äôs list counties eligibility vaccination clinic registration wish people thought like this, many stupid people around. I‚Äôm FL people act like there‚Äôs nothing going on, it‚Äôs absolutely bonkers Clearly job essential important or...


JESUS CHRIST, anyone says qualify essential, let know i'll fly smack face. calendar missing months Lrrr Blrrgh? know added recently, update. ""We weird year, weird as...a gopher flicking potato. Geico. 15 minutes saves 15% more."" Tom Cruise would went him. article says LA might HCWs remainder month. feel like they'll pressured open more. theyre behind.

OC already opened today Oh Gosh, come speak Governor Louisiana current answer rising covid numbers past couple months tell residents ""be good neighbor"". andrew cuomo sent New York government email registered covid updates stating federal guidelines suggest open current phase individuals 65+ immunocompromised. tried make appointment online government eligibility tool received email two days ago well today, options still aren‚Äôt available registration. How'd get mens room stopwatch? Yeah 4,5 also weak sauce. expect flack liking 2. never bought whole villains pull Newark airport siege thing. Like suspension disbelief never happened, took film. light last week‚Äôs events Capitol Hill maybe rewatch; may seem far plausible now, sadly. loaded question presuppositions agreed upon. main reasons obesity? topic sensitive mean discussion. One many benefits countries took care things. I‚Äôm fine waiting see countries learning progress mistakes. Show articles rich smart people paying thousands dollars donations cut line get vaccine sooner.

They want get vaccine awesome. government organize vaccine workers, similar census workers, assigned designated blocks vaccinate around 20-30 households day. Similar smallpox vaccines distributed remote villages. Relying people proactive, make appointments, come houses going take long time get through. really dumb policy. agree US banned people traveling, it‚Äôd make sense. go one way absolutely makes sense Looks like want free real estate. median age Sweden 2 years older US age distribution similar. Kenya 20 very, significant. worry. good authority gone Easter.   lots money suddenly becomes medical condition proven yet, no. need directly compare reinfection vs new infection someone vaccinated, one yet. vaccine provide lifelong immunity. ebb flow. Every year cases go back immunity wanes. We'll cycle forever. Covid going away. Ever. Oh, guess downvote like mask backed scientific paper?

Sorry tell UV protection gives. That's hard part. takes time costs money build serious production capacity. takes serious production capacity make hundred-million masks per day. High quality (e.g., N95) masks, made specialized machines.

Private companies want build production capacity unless know market beyond months.  DPA could used that.  

Vaccines effective, produced delivered schedule.  DPA could also used increase vaccine production.

I expect Biden serious experts working problems, sign whatever need sign get job done. Maybe bleach therapy provided option. Well guess point I'd little disappointed better considering we're already doing. *""The number newly hospitalized coronavirus patients statewide declined 2,500 admissions every 24 hours past two days previous daily average 3,500 new admissions, California Health Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said online briefing reporters.*

*Ghaly called ‚Äúthe biggest signal things beginning flatten potentially improve.‚Äù*

Myself, overweight goals fitness would perfectly doable past year stay home orders. think this? learn Spanish like wanted to? follow though learning draw side affiliate marketing website?

 


I think I'm alone fact that, may lot time things, MENTAL ENERGY sapped survival mode. Overweight people know need lose weight, that's easier said done.  This.

How many doctors bias straight say stuff news? don‚Äôt question whether media would cherry pick fear monger we‚Äôve seen million times? really need ignore kind article similar haven‚Äôt able find N95s (without exhalation valve) kind normal price ‚Äî price needs exactly 2018, wildly expensive would nice. finally buy KF94s full respirator though (I needed one anyway). I‚Äôm arguing diabetes complicates covid. say deaths 65 diabetic wildly wrong. studies put 20%. I‚Äôm angry can‚Äôt take vaccine. Medical conditions knocked running, j don‚Äôt trust us getting herd immunity America dumb rn Delivery store pick up! Little risk still veggies trying times... [How make I‚Äôm sorry. Hmmmm.... interesting said 100 million first 100 days. said specifically 100 million shots, wear N95 work days; days work closely public. comes cloth goes that‚Äôs done. They‚Äôre incredibly uncomfortable/hot feel need endure discomfort I‚Äôm high-risk scenarios. think people wearing mask 12+ hours day would agree. might want look science behind diabetes. finding healthy looking people 20's testing beginning stages diabetes.

The (type II) disease starts muscle fibers, moves organs, serious conditions like vision loss, kidney failure, foot amputation. mid-stages irreversible, early stages reversed. Considering 75% Americans overweight obese overconsumption fast food carbohydrates, yeah, large percent people 30's 40's pathway towards full blown diabetes 50's 60's. disease takes decades reach critical stages, months year two.


To think otherwise ignoring facts. idea fat healthy true never was. luxury times high cost energy, pandemic time cheap energy abundant food supplies. Big Mac, fries, coke healthy meal. slice cake la mode healthy. getting least hour long walk day healthy. 

A BMI 27, unless one professional sports player weight lifter, healthy. one serious disease disability, able 15 pull ups 50 sit ups one set. addition, one able ride bike hour walk two hours without difficulties. basic levels fitness large number people physically incapable doing... thus, healthy likely develop diabetes. 

Roughly speaking 30% Americans 65 diagnosed diabetes. estimated 40% Americans 65 'pre-diabetes.' ADA numbers, considering increase obesity past decades, theses numbers going up. people teens 20's path diabetes, see really increasing people 30's 40's, instead 50's 60's.

This bet would make millionaire.

It's fact diabetes attacks every part body, 2/3 public weakened immune system, course something like Covid-19 going devastating. look countries highest death numbers, look pictures people 65 dying... hmmmm. ""Good news everyone! Sir David Attenborough alone.  get life sentence. Ah thanks clarifying!  Maybe they‚Äôre vulnerable? source that? seems like low goal considering 950K today alone. like wearing shrink wrap. thinking...it's time revive original Witchdoctor mask. knew doing. Especially since eye wear well protect aerosol spread. Masks helps need three layers, eye wear adds additional protection. 

CDC failure entire thing. guidance real leadership there. entire page eye wear archived. Hope something changes next administration. Older people shorter telomeres. That's called aging. 

Every disease affects old people results. 

Why even publication? (a mild case), sort went like this:

Days 1-2: exhausted, slightly achy day 2.

Day 3: stuffy nose, ran high fever hours.

Days 4-8: tightness chest, mild cough, body aches, chills, mild fever, loss taste smell (though, nose burning feeling)

Today (Day 9): woke without tightness chest, fever, stuffy nose. Still tired achey, mild cough.

If sounds familiar you, might align milder case. read, mild/asymptomatic cases tend run timeline. Check  Ehh fair enough. true though (except maybe part fantastic health) Hey now, I‚Äôve learned throughout pandemic it‚Äôs safer stay couch watch TV year. avoid risk, I‚Äôll eligible vaccine faster!

/s  know. Good question vaccine could increase chance mutation virus becoming resistant vaccine. we're vaccinated (or least 70% country is) why? There's chance overrun hospitals unless entire city get vaccinated something.

Or mean Covid mutates strain vaccinated against?  Next time say ""I understand RNA is""  laws ""for now"" since could struck overturned time. Nonetheless, cannot debited insurance pre-existing condition US. Worrying might happen future pointless. fair enough, Pretty soon there‚Äôs going mutation make current vaccines ineffective. mean re-vaccinate everyone again? even hit herd immunity mutations? Doesn‚Äôt mean open article incognito mode clear cookies? I'm sorry going this... feel like everyone circle knows someone lost father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, uncles aunts... even peers

it sickens noone takes seriously True worth mental exhaustion care others anymore. blame people point. vaccine readily available, public stop listening health officials. see sunmer US back normal regardless government says Mutations happen virus replicates spreads. Back day made copies FIRE mix music CD worse copies came out. want mutations keep vaccination rate low means people get infected infection probability mutation increases.. Also mutations necessarily bad thing - hopefully covid mutates flu like virus instead even deadlier strain.

Also UK playing timing 2nd arw also vaccinating interchangeably. could get Moderna first second dose could Pfizer even AZ soon.

Listen get may change opinion fine least admit current strategy sucks. fed govt 30mn vaccines hold states 20mn vaccines freezers. literally 50mn vaccines chilling could people's arms. :( Die Hard w/ Vengeance last one me. rest feel off. Biden aiming 1 million day. doctors write note present vaccination site? First one's free 1% 6600, put big numbers, 350,000,000 3,500,000 expect reinfected severe symptoms. I'mma leave part last post reinfection here.

E484K mutation part group variants identified South Africa associated increased infectivity also observed occurring recently described B.1.1.248 lineage Brazil.3,4 lineage initially described samples Rio de Janeiro, already detected UK, USA, Portugal Australia. show B.1.1.248 may widely spread among Brazilian states well. RBD also major target neutralizing antibodies elicited primary exposure SARS-CoV-2 E484K mutation predicted affect antibody neutralization.5 finding E484K, episode SARS-CoV-2 reinfection might major implications public health policies, surveillance immunization strategies. can't touch N95 ""pre- post- wearing""? use once? woodwind player came quarantine asymptomatic positive, terrifies me. Ya, high risk category front line get it. It‚Äôs good got it, that‚Äôs great. 

I‚Äôm high risk category wife hope get mine soon. cautious ask monitor feels. stuff spread family (luckily everyone okay) I'm getting myself. biggest thing noticed days leading initial symptoms EXTREMELY tired. 

If anything, play safe people. Stay in, cross fingers, maybe dayquil ready case. Chances likely fine, given wearing masks. simple, clear, actionable, specific information tells public masks reliable, exists, easily available. plenty web pages explain labeling system standards.  Products labeled according standard meet.

The ""N95"" label, one labels. 

On boxes surgical masks, look ""ASTM Level 3"". (ASTM Level 2 masks less water-resistant. ASTM Level 1 masks quite good filters.) three ASTM Levels better cloth masks.

The problem lack information. problem is, marketers figured make money selling inferior products. 

In categories medical products, inferior products allowed sold. That's assuming far much efficiency. end summer. better closer 90% like others. want 80% get 95%. doesn‚Äôt make statement less true. makes ass. can‚Äôt distinguish two. barely makes news. America complete mess. slipped heart attacks cancer good strength summer fall. honestly think vaccinations numbers drive much themselves. Hospitalizations deaths number public health officials care about. vaccination process obviously help with.

But one gonna care there's x amount cases hospitals normal. Yeah, certainly Catholic kooks/extremists, mean official position church. Bruh I'm getting sick online bullshit 

I never thought would say seriously want go back school Also allowing younger people high risk sign up.  tried finding information development vaccine pre-COVID-19, couldn‚Äôt find anything; articles state made within year. Would able provide source read it? :) fresh veggies also extremely healthy contribute stronger immune system. I‚Äôd guess despite COVID risk, shopping (and eating!) plenty fresh fruits veggies every week KN95 mask could lower risk adverse health outcomes (COVID otherwise) eating less healthy diet allows shop less frequently.

Or could load frozen fruits veggies best worlds Running makes providing 2nd shot kind hard? I‚Äôve edited comment poorly phrased. would stupid fine something isn‚Äôt technically wrong. Fines like reserved **intentional** anti-vax propaganda media spreading misleading information. Psoriasis rough contagious. use light therapy seems help. HOMIES GOT ASTHMA EXACTLY expected look like. advisers actors like Bruce uses better ones politicians pay. feels odd embarrassed state like Washington right now, envious of... *Mississippi* don‚Äôt know downvoted‚Äî get vaccine! need long world get daily new cases mutations might might spread around communities become new dominant variant. worldometers daily new cases, always starts zero single day, soon 1mil new cases per day. ‚ÄúAllows‚Äù well thank much overlords. Imagine typing comment someone works hospital overrun Covid. ‚ÄúLagging indicators‚Äù don‚Äôt make right-here-right-now situation less dire donut. still go grocery store Costco buy supplies. also go hiking go outside exercise.  feel spread right now, even safe. guess referring becoming hermit type lock house. Idk think surgical one gaps. mask virtually gaps n95. understand it, it‚Äôs filter gaps. Surgical
Masks tighten around ears smaller gap tie one super loose uncle currently life support LA. COVID sucks. worked fast him. 

Day 1: Cough sore throat. little. Sore joints

Day 2: Cough worse. Sore throat worse. Fever 103.

Day 3: Bought oximeter. Oxygen dipped 81%. Complaining inability catch breath. Aunt starts showing symptoms. Ambulance called. 

Day 4: night hospital. Started feeling better. Oxygen level mid 90‚Äôs. Fever gone.

Day 5: Oxygen drops 80. ventilator.

Day 6: Emergency surgery intestinal bleeding

Day 7: kidneys failing: put dialysis.

Today: family told prepare. Aunt feeling better. cough, fever....still positive. Well that‚Äôs extreme example. moved phone online ordering quick gifts hospital reduce risk. better believe someone works hospital gift shop fulfilling phone orders qualifies vaccine. Yeah NGl don‚Äôt really lots friends I‚Äôm moving soon basically pretty much done shot like I‚Äôll wear mask I‚Äôm losing time people love  revoked? No, doctors aren‚Äôt that. read this... Denmark, except lag couple days various databases combined. 37 deaths reported yesterday, 25 day rest previous 2-3 days. sure prevention death good? representative sample population part study? e.g also include high risk elderly pre-existing conditions? Took time America Classic example hot, bright. mostly asymptomatic patient disease September October (my sense taste smell degraded finally bounces back Christmas new year), find ironic smoking still listed high risk condition.

I'm 37, smoke three four cigarettes weekdays breaks work vape nicotine fairly heavily well.

I saw story signing availability notification county I'm and, yes, check high risk box. Gonna tell 64yr old dad since smokes also call later today.

I'm huge hurry get shot due corona fear, imagine lot doors near future require vacc card get in. It‚Äôs pitiful can‚Äôt buy NIOSH certified N95 masks every pharmacy gas station grocery store America $1 each, 10 months 350k deaths global pandemic. Thanks Republicans. Thanks Trump. Im anti vaxx. Id gladly take Pfizer Moderna day week strain longer containable current measures soft lock-downs we've Western countries. fair, lot deaths beginning pandemic, going nursing homes, makes numbers look worse currently Walter Whitepower unclear whether high number cases variant UK transmissible emerged area already high spread COVID-19.

Lol. insurance obviously current PCP. According http://www.xinhuanet.com/local/2021-01/14/c_1126982930.htm person tested positive Jan 9, presented fever, hospitalized declined rapidly, died organ failure due coronavirus Jan 13. S/he pre-existing cardiac conditions. somehow cover things entirely yet. You‚Äôre right! heart muscle needs blood (oxygen) blood vessels surrounding heart can‚Äôt provide blood heart contracts, rather heart relaxes beats. it‚Äôs good slow resting heart rate, bad live stressful life heart rate elevated long periods time. Wow, 4000? 


What vaccine protect variants? Seems like you‚Äôre tho... ethical reasons Bob's uncle. He‚Äôs Matt Damon Contagion. I‚Äôm genuinely concerned government either cautious inept dynamically change policy due successful vaccination. maybe details uncertainty vaccine don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs causing confident it. 

I texted doctor acquaintance mine yesterday evening, he‚Äôs volunteering vaccine clinics simply said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know don‚Äôt know‚Äù. 

That‚Äôs led believe! What's different makes one shot That's believable... bride definitely understand concept risk groups. communications manager George Mason University Fairfax, Virginia, learned July fell rare category people whose blood could help scientists understand Covid-19 potentially treat fall ill. ""I strange peace whatever happened saddened prospect perhaps living see son hit major life milestones, graduating high school, college getting married becoming father himself,"" Hollis said. mid-July, volunteered participate coronavirus study campus, enthusiastically backed new George Mason University President Gregory Washington led Liotta, former deputy director National Institutes Health.  do, masks everyone doesn‚Äôt make good picture bbc use dad died virus October 2019 came back vacation Spain. Symptoms identical Covid. mom wondering maybe early version virus. doctor said ""some weird, strong virus"". doubt we'll ever find out. Maybe bit one dimensional!

The Strategic Research Collaboration BioNTech Weissman crucial!

I don‚Äôt want point European German accomplishment - international one!

International cooperation crucial solving global problems face personally bit annoyed national emphasis USA right know.

Thank input! That‚Äôs ridiculous. funk it‚Äôs like personal gain getting vaxxed? area knock wood hasn‚Äôt strict lockdowns still super sad literally can‚Äôt see people still told Nah. suspended permanently revoked. still entitled due process, takes time. wheels justice turn slowly.

He'll never work pharmacist. best then! would agree, actually think that's reasoning here. 2.6 years, actually. yes realize extreme example is, wanted show magnitude much age matters  Man....there variety theories causes typecast, viral infection, yet unidentified, suggested side effect, eliminated, cause autoimmune suppression pancreas. 

Still though, antivax entirely alien me.  read article engineer talking difficulties get people come construction sites Wuhan. pay 10 fold wages find anyone willing take risks.

For medical teams lot social pressure go practices like shaving hair raised criticism unnecessary seems overzealous local administrator, central government decision...

There quite army medical units sent choice matter military course.

But end medical teams sent better PPE doctors died treated initial wave. 40thousand doctors went help suffered casualties far know. also happening places aren‚Äôt ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù Covid. look racial percentages Dallas, see 40% population hispanx. moving areas used majority Africanx American, makes sense sites hispanx neighborhoods covering ethnoracial groups. article fails mention Jewish, Asian, Middle Eastern Indian communities much larger northern part Dallas. whitex preferred higher number sites. N95s vents blow exhaled particles people. N95s without vents protect others wearer. Yeah right. 500$ month spend. Assholes come every form every variety.  thoughts well. I'm comparing Denmark, Denmark course also league comes testing (0.9% CFR).  Lol get flu shots?? Let‚Äôs look data much measures followed people.

Masking:

Lowest rates among countries surveyed. long shot. Climbing 15 percent end period, mid range 75 percent, USA hovered around 80 mobility (working home Reduced mobility low 25 percent, coming back 60 percent baseline summer, reducing 40 percent baseline second wave.

Here US far compliant well: hit 60 percent lower usual Sweden 25 percent baseline, summer similar, second wave Americans locked harder.  could probably ask primary care physician qualify. would different? extra spike protein make antibodies to. Lets see turns out. Hope wedding worth it. vaccine lottery. like small daily draw everyone vaccinated day, bigger ones end every month something everyone thats got far. Unsure voted, may reason indeed. endo pretty strict, pcp, so....I see 3rd opinion differs. meatloaf said, 2 3 ain't bad. Still spouting anti vaccine rubbish see.

Benjjoh anti vaxer, spreader misinformation.

This best anti vaxers operate. pretend antivax surface, sew doubt ti make seem credible. Getting vaccine kinda sucks, lot people bad reactions it. anti-science blame anti-science it, hide legitimate reasons someone might want jump right receiving it. certainly looks like management failure.

It clear since January putting vaccines en masse months key, likely work early summer.

Governments promised fund production ramp-up prior trials' results.

I always thought planned maximum production capacity.

But now, looks like that. also looks like additional plants added merely weeks lead time.

How many people die this? got first dose Moderna vaccine yesterday!  Thanks infographic contagious spreads effectively Can't even slight bit good news without top comment still doom gloom.  Nothing. Even covid became politically divisive, standard anti-pandemic tools politicized precluded US China decided use them, cause might trace end cold war earlier. Quebec specifically. havent heard province considering together without masks. one thinks bride didn‚Äôt understand limitations weddings? People really struggling understand far Moderna/Pfizer-BioNTech/Oxford-AZ offer 100% protection hospitalisation severe version disease. somewhat agree. think single shot place remote areas since easier store execute. Personally like morning coffee im sticking double shot. math pretty straightforward - following advice would cause people die (and even POC die) focused elderly, deaths POC would proportionately less (given greater number elderly whites would die), felt better. message originally made last months figure things out. 10 months later. damn, rather inject me! handle muscle pain, really don‚Äôt wanna shit brains out. predictable Trump getting impeached again. ü§£ Idk. lot catholic people don‚Äôt like pope something tells it‚Äôs people also anti-vaxxers.

But still hope so, too. safer, magic line safe unsafe. personal preference. say fairly confidently roughly 90+% safer them. makes comfortable, consider it. 

I would say though really need wait least 2 weeks second dose. world much bigger USA dude! use it? People spectical chinese vaccines  run capacity major markets may appear decline. saying. always chance pregnant know yet (if sexually active age 50) saying no-one 65 dies cancer, shotgun wounds, heart attacks, house fires, car crashes, motor neurons disease, (insert whole host causes death here)?  they're denied access positive? issue? good ones health care professionals people don‚Äôt know stay 2 meters apart. Literally  best friend got first Pfizer shot day issues slightly sore arm headache went away drinking water. (The nurses told this.) always horrinle side effects flu shot pleasantly surprised nowhere near bad her. think come play covid end endemic, yearly pill easily picked local pharmacy cover mutations much like aflu shot. also accurate since covid mutates much slower slow even running rampant Wouldn‚Äôt considered mild didn‚Äôt require hospitalization? certainly makes body develop immune response. First dose felt nothing. Got 2nd dose 7am yesterday woke 2am today freezing, nauseated, dizzy, headache. Currently 5am feeling bit better still crappy. 

Not dissing vaccine. told expect body feel terrible develops response definitely working. Many people work preloading Tylenol NSAIDs read conflicting reports hinders body‚Äôs response not. 

Overall yay science. type vaccine development pages way future vaccines hopefully never need. Dumbass. Great way throw away years school future job. Good work people read paper referenced? 44 tee infections significant proportion thought received false positives first ‚Äòpositive case‚Äô didn‚Äôt show symptoms technology relatively new

Yes, biontec licenced Penn university developing 15 - 20 years. Biontec (and moderna) come along licence able create vaccine matter days. Moderna litterally took couple days. Biontec similar. Anything anti-China immediately downvoted subreddit although actual reasons distrust CCP ""Two scientists team remained Singapore testing positive antibodies"" February.

Biontech says planing release first batch end March - think likely update end February. release production capabilities timeline end January.

They planing producing 250Millionen doses Marburg July 500Million Rest year.  Bolder prediction, vaccine coupled widespread infection rates perfect storm vaccine escape. vaccine end effective prevalent strain summer we'll getting boosters modified vaccine then. wonder data whether tonsilectomy worse outcomes.

When doc wanted get mine removed remonstrated gonna stand way getting e.g lung infection relented. no, getting frequent tonsilitis either.  get ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù? They‚Äôll still eventually vaccinated think restrictions slowly lifted. won‚Äôt like light switch. least US, there‚Äôs minimal lockdown begin restriction village Hebei, China: leave village, break leg. obey order, knock teeth. competent government love?



Ethical? No.

Effective? Yes.

It sure shit kicking many people western countries (mine included) need take seriously. Yeehaw! also helps us direct vaccines people actually need them. It‚Äôs similar finding millions vaccines already administered. hope it‚Äôs accurate finding. Pourquoi? Everywhere see \~85 - 88k deaths. excess deaths? someone link good, bulk medical-grade disposable masks use? don‚Äôt want randomly pick junk Amazon keep reading cloth mask isn‚Äôt good can‚Äôt find honest source good replacement. Thanks Added benefit wrap receipt around head makeshift face mask real issue age restrictions putting people getting vaccine. would 0 problems getting shots arms artificial barriers place. wish taken weeks determined one-shot effectiveness Moderna Pfizer too. preliminary results looked good single shot dosing know second shot actually necessary not. competent government does. Stockholms commuter trains gates stations closest city, farther (and stations gates one entrance other). They‚Äôre spot checked, travelled work daily (before COVID) checked maybe every year.

Trams person going checking tickets every station. Thanks dude Good, keep Oda-sensei save cost. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  live NYC got Covid March. asked it? happened? 

Just convinced something make true. know people done everything possibly can, go work clients/co-workers/etc wear mask correctly respect distance. can't control others, commennt sounds privileged ignorant. perfect. Ita doses arms bins people protected far better alternative.

With current US numbers, anything better nothing. People big risk COVID already passed COVID last 8 months (we got evidence antibodies present least 8 months naturally-infected) last line receive vaccine. Actually, think everyone 65 vaccinated.  living rooms. say tuned become common place now. That‚Äôs interesting idea. like it, think could backfire: Payment could strengthen idea vaccine isn‚Äôt safe test subjects. Right, definitely obesity severe obesity: condition ton Americans have. see people skipping line solely that. agree. thing really annoys too. It‚Äôs phase two trails tried 200 people it‚Äôs got go phase 3 trails 10,000 people say anything Vaccine around time, friends. lasted long time, 4-5 weeks, mostly congestion lungs never fully clearing. exercising 7-9 times week around time 98-100%. Somehow getting moving better lying rest, thats congestion got worse. Id classify non typical sickness, ultimately mild. complications. Understood. thanks part others. :) Unfortunately questions beyond me, find article good yeah, thing is, taiwanoids consider chinese, hence racism. Bad idea, people abuse trust break houses, eventually real vaccine workers get shot (or least let in) someone thought trying trick letting in. takes happening once.

In UK people already falling covid vaccine scams. pandemic shown us anything, messaging leadership (or lack thereof) make difference. US Japan money pride. former could boon midst pandemic, latter got best them.  personally control it, obviously. certainly direct federal resources states assist distribution implementation. People making much deal delay production. mainly affec February early March countries using doses far matter. already year..there nothing investigate! math article messed license removed? may cost many people lives. Also realising many companies/events probably require vaccine able participate. Well vaccines seem better Chinese one. Less expensive effective.

So try best give poor countries vaccine, might help?

I usually vote green think opposing ends spectrum way :-) Small! think government subsidized hotels quarantining got Toyoko Gangnam. heard people got Ramada. return ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I‚Äôm looking forward seeing friends family. don‚Äôt miss commute work, pub, shopping, waiting kind queue etc. Aside able see friends family, I‚Äôd say life gotten better thanks pandemic can‚Äôt one. Poland closed borders spring half day trucks waiting lines 50 miles long every direction borders. happened UK new mutation announced shut tunnel.  'shutdown' / 'lockdown' america mostly useless PR stunts fool people govt tried protect (they've not)

The elite class start planning keep ""business usual"" vaccines come out. vaccine work well expected good new variants? Well people could keep dying maintain usual business next vaccine. PCR tests show positive active infection.

Antibody tests show positive active infection, recovered, vaccinated (because vaccines stimulate antibody response).

Basically, PCR tests, means LOT people active infections could concluded tests antibody-based. already felt hospitals area bad discharging patients early...

That‚Äôs awful. work hospital? come impression? check google scholar yourself, tons studies submitted talking phenomenon - sub hands ears. Hopefully never meet yall real life bc don‚Äôt want virus selling fear. Yea like genuine fuckin time Perhaps way original comment worded convey trying get across. don‚Äôt think business ‚Äúrequire‚Äù staff receive vaccine.

The article linked U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission allowed companies mandate flu vaccines, also **they require COVID-19 vaccines.**

So yes, require vaccine. mistaken cannot require it.

However, next comment says necessarily able fire you. I'm disputing that. link goes page eeoc.gov talks considerations regarding termination, disability sincerely held religious belief prevents employee getting vaccine. cannot accommodate employee exclude entering workplace. sure dosages different, one using adenovirus store instructions spike protein whereas Moderna Pfizer ones mRNA based. love this!! Strawman much? Paywall hit could finish reading. also say 13 quarantine? benefit European, I‚Äôm curious, much US charging Vaccine? game changed.... again! would 1% people received doses. guess worded statistic say received vaccine instead completed vaccination. yes, evolutionary pressure different.    

If nonvaccinated person infected mutation evades antibodies spike protein beneficial person antibodies spike protein.  
And person mounts immune response antibodies proteins virus - mutation evading antibodies spike protein beneficial antibodies still kill virus.   

In person effective vaccine: antibodies spike protein. virus mutates spike protein: variant selected possibility spread.   

Thats often virus/bacteria variants generated, exposing sub-lethal doses drug give time evade partially effective treatment. Probably part plea deal voluntarily give without making board pharmacy go process taking it... either way, he‚Äôs going practice again. Here's question? WTF travel shut worldwide pandemic dropped significantly? Lots pharmacists women. Lots anti-vax Karen women well. already hard enough get people wear cloth masks. Lucky him.

J&amp;J saw 70-80% one dose would seek EUA. may later go back seek EUA two dose. second EUA would automatically invalidate first. (in theory FDA could revoke would good reason, 10% improvement almost certainly good enough reason, given added complexity)

It's possible regiments approved GP's flexibility choose depending patient. 

We likely get two dose data March/April. assuming one dose decently effective likely receive EUA soon. Lol sounds like implying every 100 years so. easy people complaining would really stupid then! antivaccer but...

Yes, yes are. Media outlets, ban overused phase ""grim milestone?"" effects vaccination visible number active cases? US given 9 million doses numbers still really high Holy shit serious? hospital located, want disclose exact location, country/state?

I read article first wave nursing home put patients required much care ""dying room"" room left hospitals. similar hospital? Nice change ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna die‚Äù news Okay... 2 doses doesn‚Äôt prevent cases Covid either... sort thinking flawed.

Yes, case October. wearing masks indoors, required outdoors though.

Marisa Iati

Rampant community transmission coronavirus crippled vaccine rollout boxed people corner: Many relying negative test results, inherently limited usefulness, certificate clearance see family friends.

While testing critical containing outbreak, negative test result free pass forgo social distancing, mask-wearing mitigation measures. reminders negative coronavirus test means doesn‚Äôt mean.

**The tests still varying degrees accuracy**

Coronavirus testing United States ramped significantly recent months, daily test count hovering around 1.5 million January. two categories tests: PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests ‚Äî considered ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù ‚Äî less-accurate antigen tests.

PCR tests use molecular process processed lab. Faster cheaper antigen tests detect proteins virus‚Äôs surface. rapid home tests, estimated 90 percent accurate, use antigen technology.

PCR tests best bet getting sense whether you‚Äôre infected, even though results take longer antigen results. Still, PCR tests result false negatives.

That‚Äôs part giant cotton swabs used many tests may pick traces virus deep nasal cavity. virus may moved nose lungs somewhere else, swab may inserted far enough.

But nasopharyngeal swabs, collect samples back nose throat, still reliable less invasive throat swabs nasal swabs.

**A test may able detect virus early course**

Early infection, virus may reproduced enough detectable. false negative rate PCR tests day exposure 100 percent, falls 38 percent five days later symptoms usually set in, according analysis published Annals Internal Medicine. rate decreases further, 20 percent, three days.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt yet understand exactly person who‚Äôs infected start testing positive virus,‚Äù Muge Cevik, clinical lecturer infectious diseases medical virology University St. Andrews, told Washington Post December. ‚ÄúSo situations person could test negative, could still contagious.‚Äù

If think you‚Äôve exposed coronavirus receive negative test result, may want get tested days. also self-quarantine you‚Äôre waiting results.

The Centers Disease Control Prevention suggests quarantining 14 days considers 10 days acceptable haven‚Äôt experienced symptoms. agency also says it‚Äôs probably safe leave home seven days symptoms received negative test result.

**You could test negative become infected soon afterward**

On top limitations, coronavirus test captures one moment time. could walk testing center immediately contract virus. test took going reflect new infection.

This constraint particularly important keep mind plan travel learn outcome test. crowded airport terminal rest-stop restroom could expose virus you‚Äôve concluded negative test means you‚Äôre infected.

Gathering indoors inherently risky, negative test result doesn‚Äôt tell full story.

This genuinely isn‚Äôt correct usage words. amount ‚Äúbut language evolves‚Äù ever convince otherwise.  Also changes spike protein enough needs new vaccine might less transmissible Data suggest vaccines 95% effective two weeks second shot. That's 1 20 chance effective. mortality age range great. 

I'd strongly suggest waiting larger percentage population vaccinated positivity rates drop significantly. article talking body produces enough antibodies show infected. could exposed friends Monday test positive 14-days later. people test positive 2-5 days, since show signs 6-14 days that's quarantine period.  Census workers came six times filled census , pushing give info. looked windows made numbers. Nome access previous information. Many pushy nosy. 

So might see would utterly trust government trained goons able able handle vaccine distribution. Virginia DC too, maybe Maryland well. isn‚Äôt one state... we‚Äôre actually past point sister tested positive week first dose vaccine. dayton wonder that's still got even PPE wore.

Her case mild nobody else house tested positive.  First off, great getting second dose! I‚Äôm curious whether there‚Äôd changes life - example, whether free roam around without mask, don‚Äôt observe social distancing, etc. Could share?  vaccine injected arm stimulates one type immune cell go lymph node armpit stimulate types immune cells. virus nose/throat causes inflammation stimulates immune cells go lymph nodes throat neck (including tonsils) stimulate immune cells. body respond stimuli. can't answer whether resulting immune response better vaccine alone, work. get second dose vaccine, boost immune response. Normal relative.

I mean harsh fires California every year now.

People wear masks smoke.

Basically stuff like hand washing mask wearing public transport become norms Ah see, old enough first time there's lot people trying sign up, gotcha dont see trusted dispense medication ever well, many impressions China's epidemic control approaches totalitarianism work Western medias' exaggerated biased reports. Call undemocratic want , proved multiple times faster put thorough lockdown new spread, sooner expect normality return go back restriction-free state. understand giving vaccine elderly make VAST majority deaths hospital staff assumedly vectors transmission. would interesting, however, imagine counter-factual simply vaccinated whomever wanted age 50+ two months, lower 40+ using Walgreens/CVS, etc. Israel doing? going age strictly essential workers, 1a, 1b, 2a, etc.

It would interesting see State attempt strict age......in Fall would've sworn issue would supply millions sitting shelf. said obese, good part people type 2 diabetes. Several US states thing early started counting people symptoms confirmed tests.  11 homeschooled I'm sure even appropriate age thoroughly brainwashed want anyways. Sad ""Slow"" rollout we've administered doses raw-numbers basis fifth-most doses per-capita basis?

Seems like context needed here.

Or arise cultural issues, many control - like over-policing, longer prison sentences crimes, higher arrests similar levels criminality, endemic poverty Jim Crow, really ended generation ago, etc?

For example, look chart, arguably prestigious think tank Earth (Brookings Institution, via Hamilton see vastly different levels arrest convictions despite similar levels criminality races. destabilized government may even ineffective current Admin terms covid response hope get next admin democratic congress. moment think coup attempt takes precedence. However, wish would report general public think over. 4000 deaths day barely peep.  mean know care since low risk dying meaningless survive dramatically lower quality life.

Also I've got one dead. One ICU. One unable leave bed. 3 4 month. I'm personally ""it kill you"" bullshit.

Wear mask responsible death. Hope vaccines put damper things get bad üí∞AND LOVES Sadly, even news big portion population ignored it. Hope get focus back next week

Give least month. Biden gets sworn 6 days Trump got impeached yesterday. lot N95 mask shaming early pandemic, cloth masks became thing, died pretty fast. 

However, say Democrats one politicize masks rewrite history. Democrats ones marching state capitols demanding end mask mandates. Democrats ones nix idea shipping masks every household.

I think mask advice USA revisited probably N95 supplies medical settings still stressed. still large swath country wear mask all. also follows concerns, lack them, outgoing federal administration clearly put eggs vaccine basket. suspicious almost virus infections leave degree immunity recovery, many cases appears case, happens virus changed mean time. knew early covid mutating fast flu. suspicious ""There currently evidence.."" statements typically ignore background knowledge put burden proof side whatever line speaker pushing.

(sorry niggle clear presume mean second infections secondary infections). Graph remember, mind pointing date Gangsta approved. still wearing mask pandemic though. much years school work. Hope buying conspiracy theories worth it.

No one chooses buy conspiracy theories. license go away, least much environmental influence personal predispositions quirks mental processes.

It's sad reflection society live in. We're constantly looking enemies, rather looking work together unite. concern too, particularly second trial originally planned  P100 filters 6300 like 2096 7800 last years. Thank heads up! Ebola-2000?  sure that, he‚Äôs probably hero 70 million Trump voters. One probably owns rite aide going happen, people make vaccines, administer them, studied things like large chunks lives fully understanding elderly sick vaccinated, still much race clock. protected groups contract virus, suffer worst, die without spreading much, race mutations cause death rates younger healthier patients. push hard, harder, get rest us that. fair, we're known attention spans. importantly, car crashes contagious passed others simply room curiosity, why‚Äôd get antibody test soon? This. die intelligent folks, long run it'll help drive infection possibility way down, first several months/year, there's still real (and high) chance contracting virus unvaccinated person, even vaccinated.

You get ill normal, whole point vaccine. preliminary data confidence intervals large.

It also 4-8 week time period known less effective. know talking about. spike deaths like backlog deaths reported time. remember UK removing thousands deaths months back example.  I'm France say true ...we still remember H1N1 fiasco economic infrastructure designed paused. would cause degree ruin wealthy that's big no-no ask relevant statistic highest cases per capita large country. countries us tiny countries one outbreak makes per capita case count soar. last point, absolutely. like we've forgotten society, owe things other. owe caution health care workers, owe labor you? Yes should, scientists. someone internet 10 hours youtube research... Probably anti-vaxx hospitals correlated less overall education, nurses 2 year degrees, popular perception nurses defaults female.

It quite unsettling pharmacist believe vaccines. get education? Nice. help immensely stages Rare mother died cannot see mom due immediate surgery hospital accepting patient lockdown pets going die owner forced isolated 21 days you? sure teach (as Chinese) good China scale one ten, bad care details trust scientists? everything going world, I‚Äôm cool trusting people living.

Edit add: think graphic good people like thanks sharing! I‚Äôm burnt sick hermit.  really hope not. really depends many factors. think parts world see serious progress summer. US still way many people flouting mask mandates, insisting hoax, refusing vaccine. 

If EU, would keep travel ban except essential travel 2021. 

Also, longer virus lingers, people become infected, time mutate.

The truth really know end. Anyone says different lying you. best doctors say ""we hope"" ""We think"" ""based projections"". course! Don‚Äôt ridiculous, plenty virus families waiting turns. also money. Everyone short cash, finding things spend money low todo list.

The government needed step mail people masks vouchers them. Make stupidly easy right mask filter. Anything else policy failure. Yes, however, shortly war ended ‚Äúworld war II‚Äù common term, referred ‚Äúthe second Great War‚Äù. call risk assessment, call selfish asshole. Potato patatoe strawman minority white? doubt that?

In order that, kills every infected cell replaces healthy one. 

So really covid symptoms symptoms immune system fighting SOMETHING.  I'm presuming anything - parts done postmortem brain tissue. Looking model involving fetal brain tissue postmortem brains begs questions asked above, answered: think studying died fetal tissue tells us full brains people survived? Even survive experience this, makes believe common? makes believe common coronaviruses? makes believe that, even were, would cause ""latency"" problems talking about? 

If want believe somehow going break mold know viruses latency, go right ahead. initial question downvoted - I've explained given plenty good reasons catastrophizing likely, certainly continue act correct. surprised others agree. Nonsense, parents aren¬¥t protected getting infected vaccine. 

really naive thinking fine getting vaccine. depends entirely next election, honest. polarized country is, *justifiably* contested election, election overruled courts would certainly it. Basically situation constitutional validity could questioned someone insane. first coup often fails. Even Germany. 

If Bush v Gore current actors, would *absolutely* blood.

But even ignoring that, time took write 10 people died covid.

I week Christmas new years. news, building shit fun. recharge lasted maybe day. False, per truthers died otherwise natural causes got classified COVID.

Well, next admin going hamstrung first week impeachment stuff we're gonna wait beginning Feb earliest see new administration anything one way other. ??? got wasnt immune immune system made immune afterwards. simply countering statement said basically disappeared, fact killed well million ppl. Lol thanks correction know... even live rural SWVA everyone masks every public place go, exception convenience stores maybe. people supposed do, think time? information point, ""news"" it, dying vaccines rolling out. People want hear virus time, especially repeating headlines everyday anyway ""US hits new record, Faucci says might, Faucci says won't..."" turns noise. Well yanking license completely instead suspending it? men, even wearing masks top beard? Yes., bunch hold public office. XD Exactly. Everyone wants single cause spikes (it's holidays, cold people inside, people wearing masks).

And right, combination lot variables. combine millions people work moving ecosystem. I've accepted it. anxiety it. part staying home go caring things control. can‚Äôt speak reaction. That‚Äôs scary, I‚Äôd definitely talk doctor getting shot. 

As side effects, vaccine produces pretty strong immune response (just like actual covid does). side effects body ramping fight spike protein. people get similar responses flu vaccines, people noticeable responses covid vaccine. would they've already loosened little. Prior week public sign up. employers. heh, damn fires... first time life evacuated i‚Äôm even super close fires were. friends get evacuated 4 times span month half. i‚Äôm spooked they‚Äôre even spooked. feel bad people didn‚Äôt think big deal u problems tasting? live Hong Kong - Chinese SEZ, medical matters control HK health department Chinese national health commission - HK, Macau mainland report figures separately. numbers aggregate - that's opinion, simply fact.

My point simply data inconsistency appeared attempting claim exist - two numbers expressed different basis.

Maybe I'm engineer, find discrepancy two things immediate reaction think ""what could caused this"" - rather ""someone must lying"". seen time time can't care 1 thing time. Rona! Race War! Blue man bad! Rona! Trump! Riot! Storm capital! mean theoretically, spreadsheet problem. rolling tally people need second dose intake new vaccine. 

You able figure balance upcoming second doses vaccine intake. real risk unanticipated disruption, massive freezer failure large quantity vaccine distribution problem. even holding back margins buffer that, able run fairly lean releasing it. Oh thought whole state. right! like March again! Except worse Let's clear, shots given not, way, bad. one person vaccinated could become vector pass onto risk person. ""moralizing"" order vaccine EVERYONE get simultaneously sounding alarm ICU's beyond capacity exploding curve sounds like pure cognitive dissonance. 

There total lack urgency comes administering virus jibe situation itself, hits new highs every single day. Well looking numbers. 80-90% hospitalizations fatalities 12-15% population. estimates 30% overall population already exposed. We're vaccinating 3-4% far.

Israel place watch terms fast vaccine make difference. already given shots large majority vulnerable population weeks significant drop illness death. Thats enough. needs put jail also fined. Someone another thread said Newsom plan shutdowns. asked source got nothing, evidence claim?   Every sixty seconds 1 minute passes Africa /s  No, want work hopeful Israel soon turn around! big question level immunity achieve, enough suppress virus. Based prior research, one strategy researchers suggest engage vigorous exercise get good night‚Äôs sleep 24 hours vaccination immune system operating peak performance.

Meanwhile, vaccine trials tell exercise vigorously vaccination period. yeah getting I'm saying. One thing disease kills without medicines another thing something kills despite medicines got licensed suspended? jail time? monetary fines? Even worse countries: Portugal 156 deaths yesterday, US equivalent 5085 deaths-----UK yesterday 1564 deaths, that's 7,632 US equivalent deaths--Germany 1201 deaths, US equivalent 4,756 deaths---Ireland 63 deaths, 4208 US equivalent Look former religious people turned atheist. feel like there's social media blame here. There's something else entirely makes people susceptible propaganda. agree country acting described totally evil, right? Goddamnit. that's like parents seem think sister mentally troubled.

Tuberculosis rare developed countries mostly nutrition hygiene. things lacking many developing countries deaths occurring.

If sterilizing immunity, rate spread fall faster people get vaccinated, providing protection people still waiting vaccinations, trigger easement social distancing measures make people feel safer. isn't, wearing masks vaccination going cause people either waiting vaccinations medically unable vaccinated keep cautious possibly even increase resistance resuming normal activities. prolong social distancing measures unnecessarily continue hurt economy. Wearing mask little longer know safest way get pandemic quicker. medically unable vaccinated, already high risk covid complications forces isolation continue covid run natural course.  shit  mask reduce chances getting sick.

L Pretty much paper critics. academia works. special unblinded???????? worries, see lot dates headlines (""J&amp;J likely approved ____!"") hard time keeping track. trying figure expectations think lot people freaking vaccine never proper expectations begin with. little encouraging see many states highest vaccination rates see slight declines cases. Perhaps they're directly related gives hope we're weeks seeing slow down. Zero doses complete????????? Worldwide? That's crazy. trust someone downplayed outbreak people sent armies doctors heavily control virus?

But course would, CIA plant astroturfing spreading propaganda. partially think what's happening segment population caring continued caring segment focusing political emergency hoping incoming (competent) administration coming rescue couple weeks. Thus confirming deep knew true. sub whole still completely doomer daily discussion thread unjustifiably optimistic. quite interesting, really. read book called Great Influenza back start this, everyone got real interest played out. hoping get peace mind it, help heh

For sure, advanced long shot, knew Viri vaccines, actively working one several countries thing mutated became less lethal. got lucky. knew control spread perfect storm stupid. corner turned people finally getting side war ended, good enough people already tired precautions live said wars... wrong, viri' give shit affairs, huge wave cases again. would say count could better places stayed locked continued endure take seriously huge second waves (some none all).

Part reason vaccine research going well leader field Germany identified wrong bacterium... fact virus bacterium first place. Unfortunately lot study based foundation targeting effect cause death (the pneumonia) realize symptom cause think. knew differance think, mean Smallpox Virus hey vaccine 1780's. get kept low start, war war, neither side wanted admit getting cleaned virus. mutated become less lethal big push find vaccine, think huge delay comfortable going herd immunity solution. Again, we/they got lucky, mutations always bad things spread, seeing this, mutate. part learning made feel better. record recall. Scared one. It‚Äôs dawg. What‚Äôs efficacy rate anyway? Quite tragic.

I mean yeah quite tragic, need smug it. I'm Chicago I've lost 3 family members Covid (some different states) last month half. proof sterilizing immunity, no, that's ok. Masks needed rate spread slows. People need stop selfish af start thinking people. especially true portion population either unable vaccinated (there medical reasons prevent this, like immune disorders. Certain types allergies recommended get now. Pregnant women actually cleared well) unlucky 5%. reduction spread, likely, better yet sterilizing immunity, rates spread fall vaccinations occur.

It's forever, people need chill bit.  We'll see first batch phase III data South African arm (12,000) next week! Confirmed head Medical Council South Africa. think one things mentioned detail news mentioned article reinfections trend toward less severe. Correct I‚Äôm wrong, you‚Äôve said reinfections trend toward greater severity. really need practice improve English, I? making look like dumb, argh... that's cringe even me. Talked ICU nurse. 

In August said pretty bad. December said arms tired every shift shes constantly chest compressions dying patients.

I see people instagram SoCal house parties grinding (no masks), boat parties Florida, New Year's parties NorthEast.

Watching death toll counter probably going change anything. 80% lot people some

Also pretty much pulled ass Well complete opposite media reporting past year. happened 20,000 news articles suggesting natural covid immunity short lived? massive disinfo campaign? arrivals South America Portugal banned Friday concerns Brazilian coronavirus variant.  Secretary Grant Shapps said change would come force 04:00 GMT.  Irish citizens foreign nationals residence rights still able travel must isolate 10 days, said.  decision announced following meeting ministers Thursday.  ban applies arrivals Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay Venezuela.  Shapps said Portugal included ""given strong travel links Brazil"" - would exemption hauliers travelling country allow transportation essential goods.  said suspending travel European country would act ""as another way reduce risk importing infections"". Pretty low. likely first/second week March. awful. 
I'm trying make people realize comparing covid 9/11 ridiculous. daily 9/11 cancer / heart attack decades now. one bat eye Stay safe. look love. Medication work differently children. Even dosage tricky figure out. receive dose less? much less? kids get side effects? effects end worse virus? children susceptible rare inmune disorders vaccine small chance causing? puberty affect vaccine way?

There's good reasons medicine certain groups like children pregnant women require specific testing stronger oversight Sites keep crashing appointments filled up. need better system. 24 hr vaccination site please!!! Hyperbole lost upon average reddit user  actually know rare vaccinated person catch coronavirus. trials test trial participants unless showed symptoms, impossible know percentage caught asymptomatic COVID much spread it. entire post dangerously misleading. Never part PRC though  Everyone comments sound like American...helpless. real problem administrations community mind sets. I‚Äôm done people dying others. really sucks. works release data, not?  I‚Äôm losing fucking mind this. I‚Äôm family teachers work restaurant like 30 ppl working times close contact none us get vaccine smokers intentionally ruining health get us. state fucking joke point fact ...
There daily 9/11 heart attack cancer country decades. That's fact. 

We Everything avoid it, that's another fact Hardly, unknown.

That said, increasingly likely: [LONDON - People COVID-19 highly likely immunity least five months, **there evidence antibodies may still able carry spread virus**, study British healthcare workers ‚ÄúThese data reinforce message that, time being, everyone potential source infection others behave accordingly,‚Äù said Eleanor Riley, professor immunology infectious disease Edinburgh Simon Clarke, associate professor cellular microbiology Reading University, said study ‚Äúhas major implications get current crisis‚Äù. Suspended license?

Fucking hit head it. today mom grandparents gotten first dose vaccine aunt who‚Äôs nurse got second dose yesterday, feels good  course. frankly, people infected get vaccinated point, hold let someone protection get moment. Even actually 83%, that's hell lot better hoping vaccines month two ago - remember FDA going approve anything 50%+? No. care

Maybe don't. That's :) Well... case smoking, polonium-210 tobacco stay embedded cause cancer decades quitting.

I still quit year, 2 decades.. feel crap ton better great even die lung cancer 30 years. quality life greatly 1st death since May story reported Al Jazeera Guardian CTV News France 24 CNBC name few.

I've yet see another source deaths 2021. done same, except know I'm never going get vaccine since Gov. fool. last part statement little different me. 

It's ""...and wait till get coronavirus"" mean, still go public sauna, even mask still thought super interesting. Never would thought. ""Countries develop cutting edge medicine take advantage donating poorer nations."" Wouldn‚Äôt weird randomly looking people‚Äôs lung x rays?

The vast majority trauma patients getting chest x-rays patients admitted hospital tested Covid too. hard form expert opinion topic. 

I agree though - opinion backed anything substantial. don‚Äôt know everybody thinks aren‚Äôt enforcing mitigation measures. businesses operating limited capacity all. Schools closed large medium districts across country. Masks required every chain store states. 

The mitigation methods causing problems they‚Äôre solving, states can‚Äôt even distribute vaccine properly. Lol! Could imagine people would respond Black/Indian woman calling nationwide lockdown. correct. nonessential part. hunting gathering aspect bit hyperbolic.

I sure majority people US enough clothing last extended period time. Additionally cooking essential skill. one ability onus failure basic survival.

Grocery stores open variety options cook meal price range. people think elderly extremely disabled. Good news! programs assist people subsidized governments.

So restaurants still nonessential. Due profession, fully prepared pandemic began reveal outside Wuhan, China. invested multiple bottles 99% alcohol, dozen boxes gloves, 100 KN95 masks, 100 N95 masks fitted 100 fitted somebody else, 2,500 surgical masks, multiple industrial size bottles hand sanitizer, stuff turned needed. 

Anyways, built computer virus acted much like virus Italy took much data could. compared U.S. virus built didn‚Äôt account orange-face cultists still claim hoax, worse flu, etc. essentially repeating everything messiah tells them. 

Per multiple studies, latest coming Columbia University, could saved hundreds thousands lives orange guy ignored absolutely everything experts stated must done. There‚Äôs one person blame excessive number deaths continue rise record breaking numbers. There‚Äôs one person blame minority presidential voters shouting *inefficacy* masks proven, hoax, whatever‚Äî idiots attacked U.S. Capital. anti-vaccers believe implanted microchips manufactured Bill Gates, chemically castrated, implanted 5G antennas. mean, craziness believe go history and, spent centuries ground, ashes spread across world, etc. people going shake heads shame actions cultists. SoCal surprised see everyone wearing masks! 

Now I‚Äôm returned home Canada compliance street say, 80% even less! real evidence Swedish strategy failure. Given situation transpired last week Capitol, I‚Äôm sure anyone thinks even option. would see large scale maskless protesting rapid spread virus. Would rather hear news unused vaccines Yep, everything happening behind closed doors hospitals made unreality worse. imagine footage thousands people taken field executed every day? long would let go on? We're dealing fascist coup instigated domestic right wing terrorists right now

Priorities ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Well said! Thank kind words! Shocked pikachu face. 

If could seen coming. I'm really sure point COVID existing Spanish flu (which 1918-1920, 1900, small correction). Virus mitigation efforts COVID-exclusive thing. There's reason places world experiencing almost non-existent flu season year.

But anyway, I'm glad hear nobody know got infected died. many, many people can't say same. try remember that, okay? Anecdotal obviously things feel way better now. know thats data shows, work ""critical manufacturing"" running entire pandemic. 160 person factory 4 people right either Covid positive quarantining due exposure. thanksgiving christmas 30 people out. finally feel like breath again. Yeah sorry managing expectations deaths drop restrictions lifted majority us go back normal life risk would par would things point. 0 chance happens way. all. Sorry. Restrictions deaths nonexistent harm good. didn‚Äôt want people try get virus immunity there‚Äôs scarce vaccine don‚Äôt want vaccinate immunity. It‚Äôs like masks weren‚Äôt recommended first save healthcare workers. Thanks providing personal insight! still think situation looks like normal trains running like video. case point reporting it. agree people could better, starts government assertive strict.

I could also imagine situation bit worse Stockholm places.

Attacking population country quite toxic, especially considering they've told order avoid infecting others.

Where from? country fared pandemic? 

If authorities told Swedes wear masks public spaces, would happen. Even enforced. that's sadly case. Bad infographic, info microchips /s I‚Äôm sure 12 people wyoming concerned. Funny enough todays research article show natural immunity strong stronger vaccine. know. wrote article:

Deaths due COVID surges April July, lull May June. common causes people 25 64 heart disease (16.0%) diabetes (8.6%), among people 65 older, leading causes Alzheimer disease (67.4%) diabetes (48.3%). know people caught twice? seriously country we've taken pandemic.

It part CDC initiative. 

It shot Trump administration. Currently COVID deaths running DOUBLE graph shows, 30,000 per week.

He can‚Äôt catch survive lockdown forever yes it‚Äôs hard watch die would harder! 

Ugh hide home watch world burn guess .. looked results severe cases, dont think trials enough data say that. would make sense protects severe cases, dont think definitive proof yet.

If J&amp;J vaccine less effective, could see enough data regards severe cases though. Always surprising read UK things countries half year ago... Wow. Hilarious. strain think caused pandemic 1890? Sorry hear frustrating, also strange California given 26% shots. doses there, somewhere. think lot people would like know where. Maybe concentrated wrong parts state, maybe withholding 2nd doses happening multiple levels, like state hospitals example. Can't give can't get it. interact anyone without wearing respirator except spouse, never leave house except go doctor (while also wearing respirator).  looking actually. nurse anything go help direct traffic people-move carry stuff around whatever. Thanks tip I'll check again. take ‚Äúoh sold drugs? deserve deadly disease‚Äù? Gross Dear, people last year can't tell N95 P95 A2 B2 cartridge suddenly become mask experts tell respirators problematic. 

Listen, wrap piece cloth exhale valve. worse shitty cloth mask. Mostly. placate ""experts"" know particulate filter existence provide 95% filtration exhale breaths hours. Moisture wreckes them. anyone get severe disease, reinfected? main question. Yep. Worked me. moments masks available. got email notice yesterday supplier offering packs 20 3M N95 masks $20. Sold hour. enough, remain email alert lists. States need start buying masks residents distributing them.  wondering withholding 2nd doses happening multiple levels. Like feds hold back half doses give states, states hold back half doses distribute hospitals, also hold back half doses. seen evidence this, guessing. states given 75% doses others 25%.

Pretty frustrating California populous state seems stuck using 25% doses. :sidles volunteer table:

""How do, fellow kids!"" know old guys live handful states US allow minors get vaccinated without parental consent. laws different state state definitely something look into. Like evidence would still time agree they're reported, saying public health officials care much hospitalizations, disagree.

The first time see bunch cases hospitalizations actually drop, public health officials notice. trend continues weeks, they'll know what's going respond accordingly.

I'm making numbers up, completely. Let's say throughout 2020 til now, 50k cases meant 5k hospitalizations, month 50k cases mean 500 hospitalizations, even experts gonna care lot less cases now. won‚Äôt chipped Bill Gates üòÇ wearing P100 reusable respirator since June. whatever KN95/N95 could find time. see point less protection.

People gotten worse. Initially beginning pandemic area (northeast) large percentage people wearing N95/KN95 masks, surgical masks, even P100 respirators. rare sight, almost everyone wears cloth ones. IMO, I've always viewed cloth last resort can't find anything else. thesun.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

""Alabama: Thank God Mississippi \*sob*"" crossed mink farms resides wild mink. Cats also well-suited host infects particularly aggressive way increases danger humans jumps back. father 62 diabetes? took year almost 13,000 deaths.

Your government hard work, you! think people notice see people jumping buildings, bodies street ways watching people die. wonder mainstream media show details dead bodies people dying. Maybe show bodies piled trucks. protectionist laws Japan approve *any* vaccines (and start rolling out) May earliest.

(Basically Japan insists local trials approve vaccines, started).

Madness even hold Olympics, honestly. entirely depends governments organisation get vaccines people. country 150,000 vaccines storage vaccinating 8,000 people day. 1,000,000 vaccines storage going change anything lost family member get high horse man. purely anecdotal, personally know 13 people covid, 2 got sick, 6 fatigue loss taste smell, 5 symptoms got tested work. know 6 people gotten antibody tests never tested positive virus, 2 us positive antibodies (test done twice finger prick blood donation). Sure wear many masks want, enjoy getting carbon monoxide poisoning, getting lightheaded fainting also damaging body general.

Watch doctors say wearing masks fine people feeling light headed faint working day. Pfizer moderna cleverly chose report symptomatic cases many test positive pcr again.

Myth 5b: ‚ÄúThe virus 100 nm (0.1 Œºm) size filters masks work‚Äù

This big myth people explain article.  Thanks Brownian motion, small particles easiest filter. yeah think many vaccines going come market following months. $1.6 trillion goes right back economy. Medical care, rent housing, electric bills, groceries. It‚Äôs successful US social program ever. 

It wasn‚Äôt long ago children didn‚Äôt even public schools attend. friends, lived far away rarely saw transportation time rough. I‚Äôm saying children aren‚Äôt hard time right now, children‚Äôs need socializing new problem.

If threat hospitals overwhelmed metric judge whether shut down, is?

Elimination seem like realistic goal point. Even possible, worth reperecussions totally agree one way. another, look way America WWII handled Spanish Flu, Prohibition, Dust Bowl, ten years Great Depression, McCarthyism, Cold War, Vietnam, pretty sure things are, better, pretty much exactly same. Item item, country exactly problems, handled exactly way century last one, rather less eloquently. Coronavirus, War Drugs, Global Warming, Islamic Terrorism, Iraq War: thing that's missing McCarthyism, want adduce controversial political phenomenon discussion--but pick whichever contemporary witch hunt turns crank.

We know Santayana said fail learn history doomed repeat it. left really pessimistic part, Thucydides included: even learn history doomed repeat it. Italy, actually. think reason downvotes idea normalcy return autumn. think lot people thinking/hoping lot sooner that.

For matters vaccinating vulnerable population, 65+ health conditions. 12-15% population responsible 80% hospitalizations deaths. think get done probably within month. lag vaccination numbers dropping see things getting lot better March/April.  guess there‚Äôs plus side vaccine hesitant people there: us really want vaccine might options. I‚Äôm 34 healthy I‚Äôm still really hoping BioNTech Moderna. need sweet, sweet mRNA. mentioned miracle occurred. yu mean? case many infections. issue disease much much dangerous vaccine.

I suspect well vaccines eventually proven prevent transmission, many countries start require entry, like Yellow Fever vaccination. doubt prior natural infection count, need get recognised vaccine. Businesses going least give people time vaccine, healthcare high rate people side effects serious enough unable work day even several days vaccine. think could major deterrent comes vaccinating public especially jobs sick time. good start, still fill massive holes. actual enforced quarantine like hotel 14 days? happens tested negative 3 days ago tested positive last day?

If want implement policy, least right! mention domestic flights. Com‚Äôon! fucking compassion prick Lockdown worked Australia could totally eliminate risk people bringing virus country abroad. countries luxury Sorry, scientists agree saying.

*"" Contracting coronavirus gives ‚Äúat least good‚Äù immune defence future infections vaccine, according comprehensive study reinfection rates. wonder whether believe commenter Reddit Times article quoting scientists. happy accept sources have. Seeing little testing Japan scary :-( 
They however, sometimes, magical organizing stuff, could see vaccinating everyone record time, far even received significant vaccine orders. Weird case counts death counts get different response subreddit news Sweden US/UK  protect teachers staff? Many died exposure school. nature pneumonia severe covid cases really weird blood vessel reaction leaks fluid place. Almost really scary shit happens covid virus attacks lining blood vessels. comorbidities worst health outcomes covid people either viral receptor blood vessels prior damage them.

The pneumonia happens normal colds based able cough mucus really easy, leads bacterial pneumonia road. said I‚Äôm sure sensation able breathe coughing feel lot shittier asthmatic, that‚Äôs there‚Äôs much associated mortality even illness pneumonia associated it. Yeah. Precious time lost. US government smidge competence would done everything could increase production capacity N95 equivalent respirators make deals China import them. give free public. Source control mask work extent. N95 masks would still prevent ton infections. thought china beating us lol. many people company?

I bet people late adopters, see person alive well (even single day after) want jump onboard asap. unsure timing generally agree. estimates 30% population already exposed, probably higher areas. Add vaccinating significant % vulnerable population think turn corner soon. confuses different efficacy stats given based measured. 

Is Sinovac vaccine 50% effective metric rates Phizer 95% AZ 62% (I know numbers murky too). Lol,hahaha. cute sure... see news primarily case counts. gets lost every case same, case found young healthy person testing different someone shows hospital.

I agree hospitalizations fatalities probably important metric widely accurately reported. Hear hear. cannot claim doesn‚Äôt change dna does. I‚Äôm personally bit afraid it, even though I‚Äôm absolutely pro-vaccine Everybody starts comment ""I'm anti-vaxxer, but..."" usually says anti-vaxx bullshit afterwards. There‚Äôs bias, there‚Äôs false reporting. Fox News spreads conspiracy theories know false extraordinarily misleading. MSNBC CNN don‚Äôt try sell conspiracy theories news. That‚Äôs huge difference. Still That's cop bad excuse. read, it‚Äôs different entity handles unblinding data, checkpoints process get see interim results (without unblinding - stats).

I would say still counts blinded - don‚Äôt know got cannot influence results way. Utter nonsense SMCP CCP media. Hong Kong based paper close opposition get China. Sorry, bed wetting nonsense.

Yeah, level discourse expected someone like you. Let's get real issue, simply willing make sacrifice life benefit rest society. toxic individual, concerned well being. amount benefit locking matters you, benefit personally. time lag, vaccinate, takes 10-12 days first shot ~50-60% effective, second shot 3-4 weeks another week two ~95% effective. vaccine help people already sick.

Israel past week vaccinated vulnerable population first shot think 4-5 weeks really kicks in.

However, optimistic effect pretty dramatic, basically almost eliminating cases among people get sick. think hospitalizations fatalities, necessarily cases, drop 80%+. can‚Äôt asshole. someone tired dealing year + doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre ‚Äúgrandma-killer‚Äù want life back. Don‚Äôt quick judge like know everything. One worse though. Austria (9 mio inhabitants) started vaccinating dec 28th 
and January 7th 6k people got vaccination ""there plans wait 12th vaccinate masses"". critizied parties media, hurried bit slow nevertheless. Israel (similar population) vaccinated 10 times people period Man... Taiwan CDC blasting ads teaching people wear masks, dispose masks, reuse masks, test masks, more. don‚Äôt understand US wouldn‚Äôt same.

Basically, masks hold water one side, side remain dry, got great masks. many fakes online especially China, way test yourself. good surgical masks pass test. got type respirator cleanable P100 cartridges (NIOSH). easily tape piece cloth/surgical mask valve. masks easy breathe protective, they're pretty heavy cleaning bit pain. think will. Also really authority since mainly state governments. He's probably gonna encourage mask use No. wrong

Do Restrictions ultimately states. state mandates, federal government can't enforce them. likely find company making MANDATORY employees vaccinated... 

Hope like shopping online... thought jails prisons high risk neglected pandemic. Seems cruel unusual deny vaccine government custody.  understand logic, necessarily disagree, strange homeless people prison prioritized essential workers front lines keeping society running. also looked periodically studies. statistical analysis, like trying correlate cases severity different government interventions.

There one big study back June showed lockdowns effective bunch calls retract problems numbers ago found article titled ""If masks work surgeons wear them"" pointed differences surgery theater general public masks may work public, article taken down.

There studies relatively small area like Lebanon Scotland.

Honestly really seen anything convincing conclusive. Every time say get downvoted get bunch comments calling ""hoaxer"" ""denier"" ""conspiracy theorist"" whatever. still true. lot data proof lockdowns work. definitely data don't. California supposedly locked cases really took off.

I think something spread understand. Maybe airborne, maybe not, maybe surfaces, maybe actually remains active air weeks, know. run bunch studies mean they've gotten bottom it. spread fast prevalent everywhere matter people think clear something well understood happening. clearly fool. Delusional like looking comment history likely one would wear wrong kind mask meet rule wearing mask inconvenience life. 

Mask wearing social norm, need companies start making conventional masks day day use. Either way still looking 12 months minimum mask usage enjoy whilst ;) Jokes all, already caught life pandemic almost twice many people died per capita Illinois compared California. quoting real person that's unfortunate. Unless trying build straw man point. stupid point. list symptoms caused coronavirus point ""anything"". honestly seems like could failure testing. Attributing wrong symptoms positive test. Coming 400,000 US deaths hysteria. probably yet since even US cdc 2-8 weeks behind data, meaning we'd wait end feb know sure.

the key phrase google would ""excess deaths"" ""excess mortality"" likely find looking for. I've wear renovation work house involving fine particles, definitely suck hours. 

I've wearing cloth mask grocery store such, maybe wearing one N95s instead... IFR healthy 50 year olds circa 0.005%

Do source this? I'm seeing 0.03% 15-44 UK.  ***This peak auth right moment Damn 10 times?!? Stay safe. friend got covid November still dealing it. cousins, give fuck group, sick well month. still can't wrap head around attitude experience.

At least one family give fuck group. rest actually trying, burned point. social gatherings banned non essential businesses still closed? hasn‚Äôt case state many months. Even parents‚Äô state, restrictions right now, movie theaters arcades open. important things focus like useless impeachment effort. Cmon. appreciate sentiment, caution without cost.  life expectancy 100, expect 1% die year. Ergo, 76 million people die year, 208,000 day. think virus reason. Also, natural selection exists reason. want attend superspreader event go, spread family lose someone cause didnt listen science, complain. Moral story, dont fucking stupid, family gets live. Muh non-sequiturs Fauci saying crap like makes situation worse. Pandemic fatigue caused hopeless feeling never end simply move on. Despite people subreddit think, lots people enjoy wearing masks avoiding people. prospect another year unthinkable.

What supposed say asked? got shit ""14 days stop spread"" campaign. What's middle ground unrealistic expectations crush disease honest assessments current reality? guys think Biden introduce restrictions curb spread covid month two pick pace vaccinations? say that. find data CDC website? everyone gets coronavirus cloudy lungs? long last?   well good, appointments available anywhere South Jersey. county's mega site, despite open week, online registration phone number call. eligible now, registered, gotten email back make appointment. complete chaos. they're hospital something else. trauma doc. Agreed peer-reviewed study, must there. rate, first report we've heard extensive damage non-severe patients. someone terminal cancer fell cliff, die fall cancer? 

Just people already sick mean covid kill them. EXPONENTIAL!!!!! also gradual. GONNA KILL 600% PEOPLE!!!!! 

The way situation vaccines. That's it. lockdowns cause harm. Vaccinate, vulnerable first line, death rates drop matter fun new variant gets everyone excited. Sadly gained weight. next calendar, whole family agreed get board healthy eating.  push vaccine everyone getting bad? short answer unlike Europe UK, there's emergency Plan B, namely Lockdown. government (with backing huge swath American public) refused shutdown economy again. Half country decided Is: can't take precautions &amp; can't work home unfortunately expendable greater good. really final act Social Darwinism writ large. Thank you, I've looking for. plague times, would definitely invite people court play around, one ever took seriously. incredibly pessimistic subreddit full well-off people actually enjoy lockdowns. negative impact mental health anyone scrolls even minutes. Lets march ya''ll! 0.1% high problem policies limited effectiveness people power treat exception, example.

If Biden wants impose rules, needs make clear even politicians get caught outside rules fined, lose jobs go jail. 

I lost track number people (both parties) would give order later caught restaurants, vacations even wearing masks.

Stupidity limited letter political tribe. started two shot trial (ENSEMBLE II) couple months one-shot, that's surprise!

It's really easy - first visit took hour, lot filling paperwork stuff like that. Follow-up visits extremely quick well.

Unless super squeamish giving blood, difficult normal annual physical doctor. even take BP anything! people jail, generally jail penalty death. 
And Covid kill you. fact kill people mean appropriate trap human place risk catching exponentially higher, give way protect themselves. 

Add this: someone prison gets COVID, us taxpayers cover costs medical care. much cheaper vaccinate people either get it, symptoms mild need treatment. 
I'm arguing shit--YOU are. Civil war ain't coming. is, gonna antifa/blm proud boys

let fight. mean would EU consider don‚Äôt doses ordered? spend enough time approving vaccines they‚Äôll actually use, what‚Äôs point looking one won‚Äôt yet another congressperson tested positive vaccination, time [a week receiving second biggest report lockdowns working china, new zealand, australia. 

for ""western"" countries also grade effective lockdown been, many people honor it, whether groups still meet, etc etc kinda see line gaiters started used, went ""hey that's great, help much - instead"" ""let's shame redneck ignorant science, report came last week"" way quickly Apparently fired bunch pharmacists offered rehire pay cut many pharmacists straight refused work them, don‚Äôt blame them. Idk 4hrs MIN. WAGE pay enough make that...  

Let's say make $10hr... Xs 4. = $40....  let's forget Uncle Sam takes cut money well... there‚Äôs point trying educate you

I hoping would uncovered new law would give federal executive branch *any* power order mask mandate. Can‚Äôt wait Parkey doink one... Rural areas lower population density. work farm often within 2km anyone another farm, let alone 2m. Lol seen movie theater closed since August, eat drink There‚Äôs also much complaining real life realize it‚Äôs falling deaf ears. said think another sub? always assumed lot people smart majority idiots televised. 

Talk rude awakening. Yeah really idea what's happening them. We've gotten lot conflicting news past week. think really matters though production problems they're anyway maybe later bro Stop shopping Amazon, starters. Buy kind mask supplier likely get ordered. 

Amazon's fulfillment process make easier knock-off products get delivered SKU system places ""same"" product bin. Ordering Amazon trustworthy process longer. Sure return stuff easily, save hassle. told someone day worry what's going china since hard verify numbers, start building hospitals would time worry.

well, cnn reporting : ""Construction also started centralized medical center in¬†Shijiazhuang. It‚Äôs set cover 33 hectares 3,000 makeshift wards, CGTN reported.""

that's roughly 500 meters 500 meters, 1/4 square kilometer, give take Damn fucked individual positivity rates fell able get vaccine may change mind. However, main issue majority Americans wear mask, 2 points matter till 80% vaccinated. 
At least one family driving avoid airplanes. tried see renting van everyone, went mostly due drive time adding days onto trip. US going cross country. 

My sister waiting get vaccinated see parents too, line too. We've since beginning pandemic. news all. (I'm condoning it, think America problem cases). I've trying fairly closely follow progress J&amp;J Vaccine. 
 key data points article least new me. 

* Internally, J&amp;J team targeting 60%+ Effectiveness
* They're confident going ""much higher 60%"" - possibly 80%, ""possibly closing Moderna Pfizer doing"" 95%
* clinical protocol allowed early look data 20-people infected, assume predictions coming from. 
* They'll full results 154 confirmed cases reported. 
* expect results last week January, first week February. expect 01/25 - 02/05. 
* They're planning seek EUA single-dose vaccine, would apply separately authorization booster studies show effective/beneficial. 
* phase II data, 90% volunteers protective antibodies 29-days, 100% day 57. 
* booster arm study doubled level neutralizing antibodies. 

Not article, [NYT's production focused yesterday: 

* J&amp;J Expects somewhere 3-10-million doses delivered US end February. 
* total 100-million end June. fucking blows, makes blood boil you. worked retail level dumbfuckery lack basic sanity concerns people pre covid enough make anyone lose faith humanity. Stay safe end news slapping customer, ill contribute legal funds. read article. It‚Äôs one doctors anecdotal story. asymptomatic people getting chest X-rays? It‚Äôs happening big numbers far know. need see one todbit. Stories like scare people needlessly Focus relationships try somewhere consistently. 

Doesn‚Äôt matter didn‚Äôt follow lesson plan, doesn‚Äôt matter don‚Äôt know math, anything helps keep class calm orderly. that‚Äôs done, whatever floats boat, lesson game.

The long term subs developed deep relationships kids cried would longer subbing long term. high schoolers. That‚Äôs exactly mean. read knew there‚Äôs point trying educate you. don‚Äôt get now, never will. Lol :) 

Yes ! look infection curves places vaccinated highest percentages population, especially West Virginia Dakotas. barring huge disaster new variant, week probably marks beginning decline phase pandemic US. 

considering first doses confer amount protection start see making dent elsewhere pretty soon Congrats!  live right next sweden. FAR worse results, despite fact population density much higher theirs.

I also dont give fuck excess death., Denmark/Sweden/Norway/Finland counts deaths exactly way. Excess death idiotic way measuring,. article doesn‚Äôt make seem like that‚Äôs true knows. agree completely. found went Facebook, felt. cut social media except reddit (because many things reddit avoid negative). kept Facebook, open 1-2√ó month min check notifications close out. Facebook definitely makes worse Me, New Jersey resident, clicking article: great news!

Me, reading article: SMOKERS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! quite impressive one. He'd make wink people. even pulled rabbit made coin disappear. Damn that‚Äôs interesting position in. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs wrong answer here, though - go you‚Äôre comfortable with. Seems like could work cut people‚Äôs allowed time house half. Even gather still won‚Äôt time also go stores, appointments, etc.  wonder military physical training together even normal formations more. already gay porned soo asymptomatic people getting chest X-rays? need see data one persons anecdotal story tbh. Covid isnt death sentence population. Also, depends state penalty laws far constitues death penalty. Stop arguing shit. bombed Afghanistan Iraq reason? There's evidence current mutations less deadly. likely eventually become endemic, saying need ""move on"" hospitals still filling ridiculous. boy need get out. Like u/Khal1505 said, ""for real""

If really think civil war, need stop watching news, go exercise (run, walk, bike ride). Politics affect unless let it. 

You're going die one day. days, live. parents could trying protect successful son. knows. Anyway, heard regarding Savage now. lot people appreciate it, sure. Sucks trying help belittled though. sometimes see masks made (we pretty interesting fabric times) brightens day. god hate We're clear 400,000 deaths what, week? Less? 3,000 deaths start war long soldiers fighting born started, scale orders magnitude nobody gives damn, enough isolate, enough wear mask, enough even pay attention.  That's true. wear mask owner private business property asks condition entering property. ‚òπÔ∏è here. pictures Christmas recent wedding made sad. chose seeing family responsible.

Sounds like someone projecting.  Movie theaters state open since August regular food drink. Sacrificing one summer bad enough. several riots going country speak. think lose another summer. Thanks clarifying this. saying makes sense think need cautious extrapolating beyond actually measured. 

In Moderna trial 196 came COVID symptoms. 196, 11 received vaccine, ~95% cases unvaccinated participants. That's efficacy numbers coming from. really know trials less likely symptomatic following vaccination.  course have. person dies every 20 seconds. actually gave thought deserves we‚Äôd either alcoholics hang ourselves.

I wonder sentiment victims concentration camps felt like. exactly obviously, similar. Like learned helplessness live situation. Rural areas still hardest hit areas. people still travel city shop visit family. Rural states hardest hit areas currently. say that?  NYC construction sites told care workers wearing masks keeping distance. However alamac, nuts butts, 30 people. people wear mask. Safety care anything might I'm open shop job right instead union. knows, one cares 1 3 10 million infected shows weak virus overall, kill old. good CA prioritizing vaccines 65 over. Massachusetts 10 pm unenforced curfew everyone goes people's houses restaurants close.

We long passed point lockdowns curfews anything. Nobody listens quite frankly can't blame them. know least two kinds immunity. often systemic immunity, virus reproduce deep within body still live nasal passages spread way? often people think sterilizing immunity, can't survive all. arbitrary date Fauci pick next. Tune next week! Dude, get hard steady work right now? People bills, need food, provide family ever right now. cost everything's gone since everything rocks. thankful people still actually working instead mooching unemployment. Plus go everyday. testing people antibodies giving vaccine, prioritizing without antibodies, cover immunity ground faster? Yes. Atta boy, Moderna. I've listened radio every day throughout numbers IL cook county (chicago) live sounding crazy high me. Meanwhile mayor chicago said open restaurants since people gathering anyway Kinda shady considering vaccine still EUA. Hope pay people stay home get symptomatic 2nd shot. Look way, away precaution attempt get back normal, it‚Äôs discovered immunized *can* still spread virus. happens, haven‚Äôt gone back normal, we‚Äôve dug brand new hole.

We‚Äôre saying spiteful. We‚Äôre saying punishment. We‚Äôre practically begging y‚Äôall *we don‚Äôt want lose little progress we‚Äôve made*. I‚Äôm good thanks fauci think made excuses. No, exhausted well. go walk times week alone go supermarket that's it. I'm super lonely whole situation took away lot personal life (like everyone). meaning even though people tired certainly situation 'citizens give fuck'. Whilst people refuse wear masks etc, definitely noticed lot people wearing masks walking around ever before. feel part people trying pull together help get us mess hope vaccines FYI, January 1st. 60+ would better cutoff then?

it's crazy perfectly scales age (well certain point), also luckily doubling every 9 years still quite small fatality rate get older end scale KN95 masks still effective me? Seeing though N95‚Äôs harder obtain. 

I‚Äôve going sub don‚Äôt know believe. wearing cloth first upgraded KN95 things getting worse. need know bought effective. yes, it‚Äôs true days backlog! Yup...3000 dead day .... doesnt even hit anymore...I guess we‚Äôve living long worse already something used to. I‚Äôm hoping family gets spared this. wear masks, fam does, hate mom go take care errands....she‚Äôs 66...the risk category. think aunts husband dying covid scared little recently she‚Äôs hopefully going stay more. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äù

Yeah well person major lockdowns Australia, attest restrictions saved lives, economy. Maybe Europe fuckin shit together unified response wouldn‚Äôt mess know reinfections even less likely death? incredible news, goes well! Stop count!! won‚Äôt immediate, no. me, vaccine means surgery maybe go inside grocery store again. Air travel might take longer get used to. Honestly, since body constantly battling disease immune response busy think wearing mask might prudent long while. 

The questions ask won‚Äôt change. think always honorable human, even see actions directly affect others. epilepsy allowed drive six months seizure. don‚Äôt isn‚Äôt accident dying, it‚Äôs accident killing someone else.

EDIT: don‚Äôt stay home fear. stay home respect others. baby powder fiasco don‚Äôt trust prevented severe symptoms 100%. Actually, ‚Äúreal‚Äù number lower. Sweden counts different countries. someone COVID-19, within 30 days, dies - registers covid-19 death. Even got hit buy bus, overdosed would died anyway cancer. countries doesn‚Äôt count cases see right away death would happened even without covid. sad. exactly.

If actually compare access mortality weekly basis see much worse Sweden   must crazy think people actually wear mask home.

Yes, simple. I‚Äôm everything stay safe. Hearing bad doesn‚Äôt really change anything me. I‚Äôm washing hands, staying home, wearing mask, social distancing daily walk, etc.

Ministers preparing double vaccination rate half million day next week plans dramatically ramp delivery.

Confidential government figures published Scottish government suggest government preparing vaccinate many 3.8 million people next week.

It would eclipse 2.6 million people received vaccine past five weeks amid reports Boris Johnson frustrated slow pace rollout. recent daily vaccination figure 207,661.

The figures suggest government target deliver pledge vaccinating 15 million risk February 15. means risk groups could vaccinated mid-March.

There fury government yesterday Scotland published figures showing number vaccines deployed weekly basis.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs insane,‚Äù government source said. ‚ÄúThe figures given Scottish government strictest confidence. could undermine entire programme.‚Äù

The figures, since deleted, suggest Scotland due receive 309,382 doses next week, equating 3.8 million whole UK. end next month, production ramped even Scotland receiving 443,531 doses week, suggesting 5.4 million delivered UK.

A government source described figures set Scotland document ‚Äúreasonable best case scenario‚Äù.

‚ÄúThese figures suggest easily going meet target, isn‚Äôt lot headroom there,‚Äù source said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs competitive market things go wrong production process.‚Äù

The figures suggest two weeks Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine available, source said due supply issues.

AstraZeneca told MPs expects able deliver two million doses week UK mid-February, described ‚Äúconservative‚Äù estimate.

However government sources said AstraZeneca previously suggested could hit target mid late January.

Mr Johnson told Commons liaison committee yesterday: ‚ÄúThis government secured bigger supply vaccines . . . virtually country world. big, big stream vaccines coming track also programme accelerate delivery Oxford vaccine, remaining Pfizer vaccine brought forward, Moderna vaccine well.‚Äù think ""masks 2022"" messaging making people lose hope--especially since period precautions really needed priority groups vaccinated late spring-early summer. completely agree. separate note, also traveling Europe going different place? looked up. got email Tues, Mar 10th talking covid precautions going start office like free cookies break room Wed.

Hey dude, shut fuck up. 

I‚Äôve seen destruction addiction via father. However, addicts still people. people deserve care compassion. Addiction disease (this debate, it‚Äôs medical fact). 

Lots different factors lead someone drugs shows real lack empathy part can‚Äôt understand that. drug addicts come unstable home parents also addicted substance. It‚Äôs know they‚Äôve modeled them. 

The issue much complex you‚Äôre making be. People recover support. I‚Äôm sure factories could quickly ramp exist, doubt vaccines. *wouldn‚Äôt* want get already? influencers. Many coworkers traveling recently too. Everyone acting like virus gone even though worst ever been.  Peak far... getting vaccine everyone else? puts healthcare workers greater risk. hopeful yet. countless major strains, infected person gives possibility new strains. vaccine rollout slow many countries access vaccines, many countries access vaccines yet. literally 100 years ago doctors still believed miasma theory illness. antibiotics, antivirals, ventilators, etc. 

The fact many people died Covid knowledge tools didn‚Äôt exist 100 years ago straight shameful. hmm, maybe WE'RE virus :0

either way, extremely interesting minority dumb fucks mess everything everyone Dad 62 year old teacher alberta, pretty worried rn tbh didn‚Äôt. Great. Speed vaccination process even more. least work involves leaving house presumably seeing humans (though guess negatives).

Civil war table since 2016, historically need several things kick civil war.

Not need partisan divisions general desperation populace, have, there‚Äôs key ingredients too.

* leader. don‚Äôt mean figurehead leader, like Trump (although need one too, is... less ideal role, even supporters, don‚Äôt admit it), need something evolve command control structure. Due decentralized nature grass roots insurgency, tough ask. said, spurned ideological leader coalesce movement them

* Logistics/funding. many civil wars start split military. Although small arms enough wage guerrilla war, sufficient wage open conflict. result, without large amount military defection (which doubt see), need supply channel arms cash buy with. need however broken early strategic victory, like armory/supply depot seizure. it, French it, etc etc

* populace stomach violence. people aren‚Äôt open violent change, overtures war treated terrorism. right polls show around 30% people agree happened, suggesting strong openness violence, number would need higher.

* common goal. there‚Äôs bunch groups involved, Q proud boys boog, none common goal, collaboration beyond disorganized action unlikely.

* trigger. big one, cause lot dominos fall place. unjust election contested election excellent trigger. truly believe election close, overturned courts, would seeing overtures war. Imagine instead clean sweep was
Only 1000 votes, contested Bush V Gore style. Support would go roof, wouldn‚Äôt delusional imagine election unconstitutional. However, detached reality claim recent election stolen. reasonable person could believe stolen, increases populace‚Äôs stomach violence equalizes demographics sides conflict.

For reasons others, think temporarily dodged potential open civil war. door shut though next election could easily light tinderbox.

Terrorism even insurgent movement however different game together, threshold triggers within realm current reality (you don‚Äôt need army, dozen hundred fanatics. don‚Äôt need money beyond individual provide. don‚Äôt need public support. don‚Äôt need massive level cohesion, platform share eachothers hate on. Etc) truly believe see spades. better. RGB first step cyber punk reality  How? U.S. obviously Wuhan discovered it? means U.S. let slip radar either incompetence purpose. Ok thx.. seal properly around face still breathe. importantly though contact people limited right think serve fine. However, I‚Äôm travelling business Uk bought these. I‚Äôm I‚Äôll limited people well I‚Äôm type wear mask indoors outdoors times except house live alone. 

I wanted sturdier mask cloth using. N95 may get allergic reaction due sensitive skin. 

Anyway, thx letting know either way. It‚Äôs almost like America another significant event happening moment that‚Äôs little pressing situation that‚Äôs largely past almost year. event again? Something rather important government building? Let‚Äôs really put thinking caps on. mean say effect whatever bit ridiculous. Otherwise grown seeing ads lawyers class action lawsuits taken various meds call. truth know long term effects this... time actually study it. Yes. whole world absolutely nothing kept chugging along like normal, probably would've reached like 6 months ago, not, even sooner. death toll would __WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY__ higher right now.

mRNA likely become much common, it‚Äôs quicker develop much easier produce large scale. What's point getting vaccine ? already covid.

People habit going grocery store, like...4 days week can't plan shit. try set meal plan, manage get like 90% stuff need, like today like, ""I need cilantro tomato, might well swing store way home grab beer, too."" think check stuff still need Friday's meal.

In subheader, even make point say ""*optional* trips"". they're saying stop grocery shopping together; go sparingly, get shit need once, try social distance well. tech job old fashioned industry. Upper management must think telecommuting exactly equal vacation time company. Sorry, masks communal settings normal. delusional thinking that. nice day!

!Remindme 12 months CFR matter unless want fear monger. IFR true fatality rate. you‚Äôre getting it... live life lol take risks 

It‚Äôs selfish anyone ask everyone isolate indefinitely , would destroy mental health take away valuable time relatively short lives 

If things safely, like watch movie w friend see family smaller groups 
Do it

Tomorrow never guaranteed waste time isolating, knows you‚Äôll ever come Ok, let rephrase this: 

the whole idea Moderna would need change means changing enough necessitate different vaccinations. 

Why would predict most-circulating strains like flu? would change time, like 40 years now? swear 3-6 months guys gonna saying wait another 3-6 months. I'm done. Still beats 2 months unrestricted travel outings last year. We‚Äôll take get. source number? I'd like read it. fuck able collect that.

A lot go uncollected big contributor health care costs much US. loss gets made elsewhere.

We less version universal care people turned away ER emergency refuse make everyone coverage.

The ACA basically us trying copy Swiss healthcare system bring costs eventually repealed part insurance. Asian population LA seems like level headed group far taking pandemic seriously. world difference behavior, safety, preparation see Wal Mart Target, saw went Asian supermarket week ago. Everyone mask, wearing latex gloves too, forms PPE. Failing state It‚Äôs nice gesture. federal program honest. left house 10 months. Take fucked dark humor, hey keep dying. Makes real estate cheaper. Darwinism work. behavior changed much since pandemic started? Live concerts canceled, people don‚Äôt even wear masks live. Comments manually flagged vote. account permanently suspended posting video Chinese cops beating Uyghur boy, ban came china daytime hours violate anything appeal. votes flooding post comments, course, usual pro china comments. less deadly time, infectious time

That's general rule thumb. example AIDS would like word. I'm Nova Scotia, live New Zealand. months since we've even community case whole country. We've lucked out. Unfortunately, grandmother passed away NS though. crazy differently could gone us. fiancee French, we're watching cousins siblings go third lockdown, wear masks, get sick... basically, vaccine made, means pandemic over. I‚Äôm trying figure use chloroplasts moment Got jab today! Wow, office would shook core.   Thanks! don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen list awhile it‚Äôs constantly updated.  Half population fucking stupid, says guy drinking fifth daily. Lmao often get stuck weird sleep paralysis state can't breath try moving breathing capacity general reduced


Omg, lung capacity gets reduced even due covid get stuck one again, it'll nightmare. Hope issue goes away soon fam! Obviously going to. one cares virus anymore. 85% minimum. likely close 100%. There's probably billion infections worldwide far, something like 33 confirmed, documented reinfections among them.

The study figure comes found two ""probable"" reinfections 6600 confirmed infections additional 42 ""possible"" cases.

I'm sure arrived 85%, 44 6600 0.7%. got first dose vaccine Monday really important keep running finish line. caught now, would really stupid. I'm getting second dose Feb 8 immune Valentine's day. I'm front line worker, health care I'm lucky got early. Hopefully everyone get soon. Fuck feelings license hit natural immunity considering slow vaccine distribution Damn covid. really understand full toll killer world years. Back March SIA door staff enforcing reduced capacity social distancing queues. stopped allowing exemptions that's they'd need, since anybody inside without one definition must taken since entering. highlights simplemindedness people. area's laissez-faire attitude towards COVID19 led hospitals experiencing numerous periods near at-capacity ICU occupancy extent they've ship people state care. Imagine disaster causing dozens, hundreds people needing treatment one completely preventable periods.  downplaying, fucking reality it. bad good many stores order line free curbside pick . Use one possible. avail town try going stores fewer trips last time set foot grocery store March 16th, 2020. little rough ordering online, sometimes mess up, sometimes they're sold out, sometimes there's surcharge, sometimes tip (rightly so) expensive. worth sure vs alternative feeling that's issue lot states. Georgia, live, struggled rural hospitals enough willing people vaccines given. Taiwan's performance par warm Chinese provinces. year ago pre-pandemic, seem relevant. Germany, strong government strict laws, obviously.

But really would prefer would reasoning explaining ideas article.

For example, exposure walking someone? so, linearity example would make sense. Otherwise, checkout would interest, people rarely start talking customers.

If aerosol infections take minutes immediate vicinity airstream exposure, like lab results suggest, concentrations grocery stores ever getting high enough happen one place?

Or fomites contaminated maskless speaking culprit, virus concentrations goods raise linearly respect time people store?

I'd really like know wisdom behind this. guessing infections still happening direct contact, extent even coupling social groups grocery shopping infections becomes totally irrelevant. biased guess see driving, see neighbourhood, hear people. Since article doesn‚Äôt specify, I‚Äôm gonna assum operating kissing booth. still 100% severe cases hate fucking country.

I longer explanation somewhere thread below, think talk effectiveness masks frequently tend focus filtration efficiency handling usage. disposable surgical masks still better cloth masks, taking account imperfect use handling. review hopefully illustrates important proper use addition filtration efficiency is. one far less likely improperly handle mask intended single-use disposable reusable one.

California Expands Vaccine Access Everyone 65 Older, LA County Ready

Updated January 13, 2021 5:10 PM
Published January 13, 2021 1:39 PM
 
A pharmacist UCI HEalth Center preps COVID-19 vaccine. (Chava Sanchez/LAist)
California's Department Public Health expanding access COVID-19 vaccines everyone aged 65 older, allowing age group skip ahead eligibility queue. Los Angeles County won‚Äôt expanding access yet.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's move puts seniors ahead first responders, teachers, childcare providers food agriculture workers, slated receive vaccines health care workers nursing home residents.

In statement, governor said:

‚ÄúThere higher priority efficiently equitably distributing vaccines quickly possible face gravest consequences.‚Äù

But L.A. County won‚Äôt start 65+ group finishes vaccinating health care workers, Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said today. still 500,000 go, said, adding county doesn‚Äôt enough vaccines achieve goal finishing group‚Äôs immunizations end month.

So far, 200,000 health care workers nursing home residents gotten vaccinated, Ferrer said.

""I know frustrating must seem folks L..A County,"" said.

Ferrer said county asked state vaccines, expand 65+ age group sooner, yet heard back.

She expressed hope next week ‚Äúwe'll able enroll many providers many pharmacies [in vaccination effort], start advance booking appointments‚Äù seniors.

The state plans roll new email/text notification system next week let people know they're eligible receive vaccine, Gov. Newsom said.

Efforts ramping create mass vaccination sites across state, including Dodger Stadium Disneyland. Newsom said stadiums convention fairgrounds also converted vaccination sites.

The change California's vaccination plan comes day CDC recommended help speed inoculation process, criticized moving slowly. federal government also promised increase vaccine supply states. I'd guess would true even coronavirus.   thing changed consumption patterns extra $$ stimulus blow. went hospital potential lung clot (luckily not!) blood clotting disorder 6 serious blood clots belt. put corner testing high alert capacity. ER full, beds full, ambulances kept coming, hospital beds full, ambulances starting turned away. 

I felt terrible even going! people die 3 major blood clots. I‚Äôve lost 11 close family member blood clotting disorder can‚Äôt duck around feels like may one. 

As nurse asked up. said hospital full Covid people complications whole system nothing they‚Äôd ever seen! people reported calling pharmacies Walgreens resulted appointments. teach charter school started going back person September. September 14th December 17th, three confirmed cases. That‚Äôs it. don‚Äôt care covid outbreaks aren‚Äôt driven person learning. still families going send kids school long Covid still threat. teacher, sick tired bullshit hybrid learning. cannot teach class effectively ten kids person 21 online. It‚Äôs exhausting hate it. want kids come back school come back. Given know immunity generated vaccines, means terms antibody titers, T-cell immunity, factors, we're going good long term immunity current vaccines, let alone future ones. Antibodies SARS (from 2003, original SARS) infections (there never vaccine), lasted 12 years. Step 1: 

Step 2: 3M 6300

Step 3: 3M P100 filters

Boom, protected coronavirus. frightening statement article me. 

""those asymptomatic show severe chest X-ray 70 80% time"" talking fact well covid, vaccinating population really isn‚Äôt priority compared states Europe. I‚Äôm Vietnam think we‚Äôre pretty happy enjoying normal lives world getting shit together. Make sure buy regulated goods (mask filters) legit sellers like Amazon itself. products link effectively flea market goods, way verify quality, recourse product misbranded misadvertised. cancelled permanently suspended. sub faux reddit experts telling people daily take 10x recommended amount vitamin cat take joke... Would accurate say ‚Äúa plurality covid deaths people 65 secondary diabetes?‚Äù Irrelevant. borders shit show handling virus. think lot folks think high risk dying realize disease ways getting us. read, long Covid picnic. That‚Äôs true. one anymore.  really hope one poor souls using fiberglass air filter medium personal respirator. Sure, may \~95% filter efficiency, breathing glass particulate could quite possibly worse covid.

Personally, prefer buy commercial P100 masks. Older people likely hospitalized covid. reduces hospital capacity people die. Vaccinating medical workers older people reduces strain healthcare system. I'm fine long treatments people get sick vaccines. can't think many diseases completely eradicated. absolutely compared peers. states learn successful states. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Really sorry this. need better health insurance health care country. (I assuming us. Apologies incorrect.) do! It‚Äôs likely everyone pivot positions within economy already got it, ie healthcare workings, grocery store employees etc. We‚Äôre point facility staff residents already infected, risk new infections low. Significant variants seem popping every day contest among viral strains, competitive advantage important. virus‚Äô goal find invade new bodies. variant manages capture them, turn infect yet bodies, vault ahead competitors establish short order, timid strains crowded landscape altogether, brash newcomer calling shots instance, experts warn B.1.1.7's increased transmissibility drive proportion population needs vaccinated achieve herd immunity bring pandemic deny virus enough new victims keep pandemic alive growing, need surround carriers uninfectable ‚Äî words, vaccinated ‚Äî people stand way make transmission harder. better virus infecting new victims, uninfectable people need population block path new victim.

the estimates transmissibility estimates needed herd immunity fluctuates

scientists like dr fauci changing numbers yank chain 'move goal posts'

when new evidence like variant B.1.1.7 comes change estimate.

stay safe ya'll play type really defending idea couldn‚Äôt planned roll vaccine better have?

Some states great, 80% vaccines administered states like this.  concern? mRNA, exactly. anything, they're protein strands. production capacity masks. technology goes actual filter material composes n95 masks quite specialized (and many cases proprietary). build mask production capacity like, without raw filtration medium, little good. Unfortunately, since much melt-blown fabric made foreign countries, DPA would little affect production state side. others mentioned, it‚Äôs states, lot leeway here. example, 30 years old technically ‚Äúobese‚Äù, it‚Äôs bodybuilding barely visible body fat. eyes medicine, risk factor allowed get vaccine already Fl.

Asthma, hypertension (and even don‚Äôt, could say history hypertension they‚Äôd let slide), autoimmune, obesity/overweight, diabetes risk factors consider. 

In clinics FL restrictions made going days hardly vaccinations, they‚Äôre trying speed process letting conditions in. Same, even dick county you? Sorry going this. Wish entire family quick complete recovery. lockdown schedule getting trashed.. logistics Olympic Games enormous 

They need sorts stuff won‚Äôt ready likely great time anti maskers flying home every nook cranny America plague cult attack. farthest northern reaches Michigan told non-essential frontline groups wait summer possible chance. dependent quickly peeps get vaxxed. think definitely reasonable get vulnerable 20% jabbed next wave start. Best luck. want parents vaccinated, too. many health issues fear Covid would death sentence them. tend people pull ‚Äúvaccines religious beliefs‚Äù card medical exception card, medical provide proof condition. religious exemption, people make bullshit it‚Äôs much harder employer find non-discriminatory way verify that. 

Why religious exemption option healthcare workers? America. playbook. manual. whole world dropped ball, ball slippery catch. It‚Äôs likely data hasn‚Äôt come yet December. person's exclusively coronavirus troll. Pay mind. Call nearby hospitals go web page. 

Some vaccines need ultra cold storage places it. doomer moment lol ""How fellow seniors?"" doctors nurses know caught covid people would die. back up, one replace sick primary caseload right covid patients. might why. comparison?

I don‚Äôt blame anyone getting caught guard pandemic year ago. 

I think think it‚Äôs crazy last 8-10 months governors apparently haven‚Äôt spent time thinking best roll out.

This governor quoted saying working vendor right build website. 

Really? now? That‚Äôs incompetence. Biden passing much anything congressional margins tight. Sounds like vaccines may finally starting impact. county? Congrats!!  idk getting downvoted. laughed. upvote lol high cholesterol? ""We need get points board keep team same.""

[Well, duh! summary game ever. think that's another 'trope'.] hope gets Nancy Shouldnt linger around past September sure Yeah can. should, they've decided stop caring public health they're bored ""tired traumatized"".

The west even get mask enforcement right. Sick individualist whiners acting like they're victims. personal household ready pandemic? I‚Äôm curious well. think either bot troll. keep posting firing squads active ""Sino"" sub, I've heard pretty pro Chinese gov't. Get here. Yeah agree. don‚Äôt think teachers prioritized populations. Age health issues be. I‚Äôm bottom totem pole won‚Äôt get mine long time that‚Äôs be. 

I could maybe see wanting grocery store workers certain essential manufacturing prioritized think it‚Äôs bit complicated vaccines occupation. easy healthcare workers could send vaccines hospitals directly. can‚Äôt send vaccines grocery stores lol. Worried whether works side effects? long? can't remember.. blur. Personally prefer full face respirator long term wear. Since seals around perimeter face really takes pressure nose mouth area. downside 99% people wearing piece t-shirt face look like nuts (or sometimes jealousy even). Washington needs this. qualify doesn‚Äôt mean available. people can‚Äôt get aren‚Äôt enough distribute yet. explains drastic fall heart attacks cancer covid deaths spike?

Can happen efficacy similar viral vector vaccine half time? know half year trial efficacy 2 dose vaccine longer term? Maybe viral vector vaccines works way one tested one dose? get contact Moderna pifser make vaccines?

No one get precursors we've maxed global supply basically. That's important make many different types vaccines possible: Diversify manufacturing capabilities. people luck. /s many 91 expected pull (i.e. live)? Really source? true ease health system  Ffs not? It‚Äôs damn hard enough getting people wear one. want change again? *Die Hard*, *the Fifth Element*, *the Sixth Sense*. think business force employees get vaccine. employee's choice, based conversation personal doctor. Jan 21, see Age far away biggest risk LA County. 72% hospitalized patients Latino, it‚Äôs pretty well distributed age wise. good luck implementing race based (minority) prioritization. society would prefer let rip.

Unfortunately really good solutions. talk nation strategy providing protection small subsets (like healthcare workers) population future pandemics, one. actually hold belief happen. vaccine deployed we'll go mission accomplished, end. 
 
That's conversation switched fast people behave instead protection use. Stay 27 feet away people go indoors another person last hour individual now. Holy hell that's quick! Hey know average age cancer death 78. guess cancer isn‚Äôt problem either right? know.. seems little back-something me.. op,   county doesn‚Äôt even vaccine group 1B yet onto dose 2. deep red zone.

Pfizer answer month, recall. 
At time, premature draw conclusion. meanwhile, here's [the boilerplate 'Q: person received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, vaccine protect transmission') vaccines protect viral illnesses also reduce transmission virus causes disease vaccinated. hoped case, scientific community yet know Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine reduce transmission. FWIW, someone Los Angeles subreddit shared link [Los Angeles County COVID-in-sewage last week showed precipitous drop amount found sewage. taken indicate case numbers would improving coming weeks...but I'm expert this. don‚Äôt think everyone needs n95s people upgrade surgical filtered one better. ill take free lmao entire US system mess.

B.1.1.7 already bad enough. wish could tell you, Covid-19 nasty virus, get stable patients sick, quickly. new drug trials we've seeing decrease deaths actually, hopefully majority pull through. quite lot patients surviving covid-19 first surge, that's it, surviving! great majority survives long rehab, kept tracheostomy weeks end, several months. virus leaves permanent damage several organs. 9.9 yesterday. Monday report higher weekend days much lower likely catch up. highest non Monday yet. Improvement good... Needs improve faster. still falling behind supply without even releasing second doses (which good pointless end arms) worse ? reason get vaccine?

I mean wont getting summer anyways :( virus ""successful"" needs make copies itself. 

If virus kills host host spread it, that's shit virus.

Ebola shitty virus humans, evolutionarily speaking. Kills hosts spread it. 

Think herpes. That's hell virus. Pops occasionally, back hiding dorsal root ganglion. Huge numbers people infected, minor occasional discomfort. 

UNFORTUNATELY, covid already incredible spreading (long incubation period, high infectivity, moderately robust outside body), natural attenuation towards less fatal strain less likely. Right, tell people it‚Äôs unstudied, we‚Äôre trying learn more, it‚Äôs hard thing study simple way involves deliberately infecting people, something we‚Äôre squeamish about.

Don‚Äôt tell people still spread, don‚Äôt know one way other.

Because already skeptical population, WHO/CDC/public health general already burned credibility series massive fuck ups last year, CDC especially. guidelines actively wrong harmful many places.

So tell doesn‚Äôt block transmission, keep wearing mask, people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worse flu, and/or thinks masks sort plot, much less likely get vaccine.

So made meaning expect defend thought said?

Lets get crux matter here. 

You think Sweden secret strategy lying it.

I not.

Further discussion pointless. Everybody choices. saw earlier post said calis well require vaccine every 12....$$$ mean 6 months :-$ job sent us email saying us register want vaccine encourage us so. Everyone talked said day company makes take vaccine, day get fired. said take it. ""I've never flu shot never gotten flu"" fairly common excuse well "" new, test enough"".

Problem know say people like basically deny science behind understand it.  Get Orwellian shit. actor Matt Perry? sucks, depression sucks resident state who's favorite xmas movie Die Hard, disappoints much. won‚Äôt downvote you. That‚Äôs done Technically, 'second year' arrived. yes, already gotten worse. also vastly improve 'said second year'. average pandemics last 2 years anyway. summer, we'll well way massively improving global situation regards virus itself. point I‚Äôm ready call higher transmissibility B117 functionally moot. Cases London going lockdown. avenues protect people earlier variants still work here. reason think vaccines won‚Äôt. Additionally, R0/Rt flexible, even increased transmissibility causes question need increased percent immune reach herd immunity. sure hope go sleep here, case sounds lot like mine, want find useful mind keep talking tomorrow No, barrier acceptance. anything get arms.

As saying goes, vaccines stop pandemics, *vaccinations* do. nearly travelers including U.S. citizens must show negative test within three days departure documentation recovery COVID-19, order signed U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield.

All travelers aged 2 older must comply except passengers transiting United States. CDC also consider waivers testing requirements airlines flying countries little testing capacity, including places Caribbean.


Pretty interesting proof already cvoid need test. Tier system still place. CDC changed guidelines CA modified plans reflect this. need watch Red Wings bad, disappointment tolerable Coronavirus Also tried limiting vaccine older vulnerable. slow clunky rollout vaccine sitting warehouses.

 need arms teachers getting makes ton sense. Naa vaccination. Job. No, means Germany full cranks push good practices That's South Africa. they're submitting it, data public then. couple weeks  People catching everything they‚Äôre supposed to. Wearing masks, washing hands, staying home. fault catch it. Millions Americans wont even wear god damn masks nearly year pandemic even without accounting geographical differences comparison ridiculous...

Keep mind 7% US population positive COVID test. know plan vaccinate anyway, put near end end line brings vaccinations needed get herd immunity. difference n95 mask kn95? 
Somebody told it‚Äôs n95 manufactured US kn95 everywhere else. standard though ... 

I both, n95 definitely mask kn95, sure believe. sounds like agency cancelled rather specific workers. would terrible idea send folks take care covid -19 positive patient proceed travel take care elderly folks. said, we‚Äôre almost year pandemic provider system place deal now, like providing fanciest PPE (where get whole face mask snorkel pumps filtered air) caretakers visit covid 19 positive clients, consolidate covid 19 positive cases specific team extra PPE (and hazard pay) types visits. seems like much could organized made plan entirely expected scenario, system failed folks Fold paper half, half again, on, reach moon 45 folds. get bigger observable universe 103 folds.

Edit: well dang, scrolled more. Someone already made statement immune response. necessarily covid symptoms. body reacting foreign body fight Die Hard Vengeance, Live Free Die Hard, Good Day Die Hard. said science deniers choose believe kids can‚Äôt spread covid. Every location run every day. that‚Äôs true, think it‚Äôs disgraceful way handle it. Think implication: working health = bad, ordering junk food = yeah fine

I honestly don‚Äôt know get idea. Cities country closed streets give people safe way stay healthy outdoors.

But preventing people around public enclosed spaces (McDonald‚Äôs gyms almost everywhere), also keep people healthy. great. Would love concrete statements scientific community consequences delaying second dose.

There could individual consequences, decreased immunity seen trials (Pfizer/Moderna ~ 95%). 

There could vaccine resistance virus strains develop.

If fears answered good news... GO GO GO. rational concerns. ton testing done. ""they're"" blaming markets would potentially put sick pangolins bats proximity other? Allowing get infected viruses letting viruses mix match? That‚Äôd nice call good. Canada get 5 days sick family, 15 days paid vacation, assistant manager small retail store Well hospitalizations plataued last week there's that.

It's possible seeing early effects vaccinating nursing home elderly fewer hospitalizations.

Even cases stay high, age distribution shifts younger, fewer deaths. 

But cake already baked half million deaths March 1. can't see way changes.

Maybe lucky end 600K US deaths. Yes. Children alien life forms capable spreading every disease like Petri dishes are. Except covid. Covid special. Ok two questions you:

1. person?
2. money? can't trust celebrities wear masks, trust? like spring antibodies recovered patient lasted month appointment 19th. give option unblinded then. Hell yes actually give existing businesses money ahead time adapt COVID-friendly business model. restaurants takeout-only. I'm letting get money business lost there's dine in.

Life-saving compromises y'all. walked without fuss according original story. Right? would send unvaccinated kid school bring home unvaccinated self? Covid vaccines, mean. That's true, appears infectious variants developing parts across country, think it'll much effect would caused mass outbreak like Australia Taiwan understand frustration better strategy quicker, efficient, lead less infections deaths. perfect method want resulted 20mn vaccines sitting freezers going bad. Sorry - edited comment include article Pfizer agreed summer, vaccine even proven effective, provide initial 100 million doses United States. new agreement, Pfizer provide additional 70 million doses end June another 30 million end July, doubling deliveries promised initial contract. so?

Vaccines limited old people health care workers US right now, vaccinating people soon. reasonable people anxious get call get shot. CDC issued report demonstrated aerosols vector spread covid. come masks low sweden swedes say follow I‚Äôm young perfectly healthy person still want vaccine. friends caught covid sound fun. totally get elderly healthcare workers get first considering many people declining think anyone wants vaccine able get it. young doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre invincible. lot young people work grocery stores, food establishments, places contact public happens letting us also get vaccines makes sense. point absolutely ridiculous. asthma kid, assumed grew it. Recently got virus something started sounding like pneumonia week+. Diagnosed asthmatic bronchitis. 
 
I run 15+ miles week I'm making assumptions body's ability handle covid. going go  Would possible rapid testing sites airports?   bike repair shop 10 minutes today, regular 3-layer mask (instead n95 used rare indoor visits).

I'm definitely sweating it. I‚Äôve smoked heavily almost ten years. It‚Äôs honestly terrifying think that, die, black lungs might actually use Covid survivor they‚Äôre still better shape. 

I‚Äôm currently organ donor. real possibility, go DMV get shit updated donor weekend. ""discover"" ...Is revenge Alabama? Thanks. Yeah, sucks. mum lives lot guilt - healthy one - her, know? tell stress shit, but...

If one positive come it, one people working really hard weight now. said 3 mutations, one similar UK variant spike protein make virulent. stated yet two mutations were. Hopefully nothing worry is... mark shows whem editing 5 mins original comment Hey! I‚Äôm smoker fantastic lungs living however 2021. Everyone allowed make personal decisions I‚Äôm glad enjoying yours! Texas pretty big they‚Äôve vaccinated nearly double per capita. February one used covid-19 either.  2020 Strikes Back? People Italy going depressed people world. doctors duty save lives got full ppe instead garbage bags like places.

For builders like project go outside workcamp hangout locals. Username definitely checks out. 

I don‚Äôt know you, please take love energy random stranger. I‚Äôm proud happy you‚Äôre adjusting different way life. can‚Äôt imagine process like. 

I ask, get doc appointments keeping leg elevated? Proper response? people can‚Äôt even wear mask. massive riots June left completely ignored social distancing.

I control myself. reason curve didn‚Äôt flatten.

So yes failed. there‚Äôs nothing could do. I‚Äôm broken record think people get realize can‚Äôt lot things without getting first. 

Depending live, might able go concerts, sports games, school, travel. I, unfortunately, think it‚Äôs going take missing fun things get people board. I‚Äôm currently law school remotely absolute joke. Lol dying normal Idk bad hospital last month internally bleeding go ER waited hrs tried hard stay awake nearly passing many times. finally got called got treated know spent long time ER bed nurses told waiting ICU bed open. Finally got getting better enough wait long time move normal room.

I mean, dont mind noth previous rooms tbh got privacy comfort lol. even told usually patients transferred hospitals since doctors one.

I hope things get better soon hated alone whole week see much struggle everyone space time patient. True! lot people want wait see effects vaccine. think it‚Äôll give autism, microchip, ridiculous reason, vaccines long term effects unknown there‚Äôs way know it‚Äôs while. temporary side effects, normal stuff like nausea headaches, it‚Äôs far people want see vaccine action bit Face mask usage low part pandemic, anything recently there's uptick usage. blaim government Public Health Agency late start recommending them.

The people I've talked takes pandemic seriously. also many don't. ones encounter probably depend kind people socialize with. think something unique Sweden.

And still see telling personal experience differs lying. They'll set fire think Americans see undesirable die first it. statistically they're right. get saying, there's intermediate selective this. booked appointments next month hours expanding it. could easily accomplished days without making essentially first come first serve ensure need revived them. Obviously one uses general public conversation. general, immunity vaccines far superior infections. new ones Covid, general.

The studies animals really encouraging, it'll years worth protection.

I'll check article see fear mongering.

Edit: fast.

It's mostly overstating risk, optimistic. better data time goes on. I'm worried article. subs remove duplicates know one survive, key information (such link official government source), thought would useful them. Ah, okay. thought meant nothing US could done better. Yeah, impossible fight uphill battle stuck country kind stupid that's bubbled recently. difference n95 mask kn95?

I got burned explaining difference. Let's keep certification matter. ""Back normal June"" may stretch unless ramp number people getting vaccinated per day. Like wanted vaccinate 200 million people next 20 weeks we'd need 10 million shots/week, double two-dose vaccine. far we've done 10.8 million shots month.

Received vaccine today I‚Äôm teacher eligible state. endocrinologist told get it, reason to. understand Massachusetts insists worst Google anything nursing home deaths New York orders governor take cases hospital even hadn‚Äôt tested negative. big story March April. history allergies? sent ER? I‚Äôm lucky health life insurance, permanently disabled way scares way dying. watched grandpas lose minds due Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia. 

I feel like asshole took last year, 27 years old, genuinely respect admire cope major disabilities every day. terrifies damn near anything, people still get live life every day coping shit ton stronger am. Another video sweden, face masks lying, people notice. Looks like US hit 400k days Trump leaves office. 60% efficacy, need vaccinate 100% population threshold herd immunity higher 60%. Taiwan called 'Wuhan Pneumonia' Mandarin. Hard racist mostly race suppose. considered ""permanent"" damage? would think would mean would never fully heal patient's lifetime. mean thing around little year, think safer err side caution. heals eventually, truly great. not...then what? Generations people may oxygen tanks day, lung transplants, maybe die sooner?

This kind concerning. Good problem point mandatory anyone wants go public. Don‚Äôt wanna get vaccinated don‚Äôt put others risk. Lol, could said Die Hard 1 2 3. anyone else concerned side effects vaccine? cousin took sent ER day... 2021 worse 2020? Severe pulmonary fibrosis difficult reverse. Problem damage causes immune system go self-propagating cascade. There‚Äôs active research treat pulmonary fibrosis, much entered clinic yet much want. I'll wait extra days pop 3:30AM traffic, people, in, out, bing bang done. That's Chinese media government reported beginning. became issue PRC government tried change narrative.  No. PrEP vaccine. even better 90s moderna pfizer 90s  old get appt? father 80 type 2 diabetes. He‚Äôs scheduled get first shot 25th California huge fuck I‚Äôm surprised tbh vaccine train immune system prepare case comes contact real thing. contrast antibiotics administered kill bacteria; stop taking risk resistant bacteria spreading making overall pop strain drug resistant.

If want reach herd immunity need vaccinate people less. depends type, thought. Allergic asthmatics come okay, people whose asthma mostly flared cold (ahem) ... much.

I got shot today, job, asthma. official, everyone get oral! drugs they've trials seem work ? There's different efficacy numbers, headline number typically efficacy preventing symptomatic cases. That's pretty self explanatory runs gamut fever cough way ICU death.

You also see efficacy Severe cases. Definitions vary, basically saying ""likelihood prevent hospitilization.""

So 80% effective vaccine likely one 80% effective symptomatic cases, could 100% effective severe cases. 20% SoL, might moderate mild case. Check local county news. county sign online appointment. show up, wait line people made appointments around time, get shot. tested positive Monday I'm curious anyone could help understand course disease. girlfriend exposed work last Monday, tested negative following Wednesday (rapid PCR) took test Friday (PCR) came back negative. took another test past Monday (PCR) her's negative, mine positive. now, neither us developed symptoms finding Tuesday following expose quarantined contacts 9 days. China used draconian measure

NZ island

AUS island

Singapore effectively island city state.  ... duh? fuck funny point stop hospitals filling people dying. suggestion vaccines reduce spread unknown much. precautionary principle would suggest get there's even slight chance will. Good thing required shop then. Plenty stores there. least person's body overwhelmed future getting vaccine already caught it. Bye. think terms yourself, population whole  Please bring US. 4:20 shots sound nice. suppose, unless it‚Äôs causing massive sudden pressure healthcare system, system already expanded meet demand.

For example, COVID hit, don‚Äôt remember hearing ICU shortages obesity, I‚Äôm sure argue would worse treatment outcomes obese people treated something time.

But COVID, certainly point people die healthcare system overwhelmed sudden large increase demand. wasting money this? 

Nothing coming _____ believable. cabal liars inspires confidence. Yeah arm gave shot hurt pretty solidly like day. actually wake first night guess rolled onto arm. like bruise mostly hurt touch hurt otherwise. 

The pain move armpit day two that, pretty minor.

We'll see couple weeks second dose goes. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* way NYC - really tough get slot point appointments booked *April*. really hope projected slots we're stretch administration current allocation next three months - plenty nurses sorts huge event centers, hard believe it'll really take long. think something like ~150k people would fly JFK every day pre-covid.

Though apparently (according mayor), we're track run doses end next week. I'm bit confused far tell, we're administering many vaccines yet (looks like ~100k last week, 28.5k yesterday), hopefully means we're scaling existing efforts big time. I'd honestly *praise* city hall ran out, since least means we've done best can. Moderna currently trial ages 12-16. Hopefully available soon. middle high schools online students trying careful forced put families risk school attendance policies. Especially new strains emerging. Heartbreaking point valid. Healthy things banned. far seems USA kinda well vaccination pace (surprisingly considering astonishing negligent reaction whole epidemic). apart Israel, countries well too? Yup. Lies,damn lies and...statistics. \*checks sub i'm on\* nevermind, can't finish sentence sucks. thought ok since Bloomberg tracker says one Eu countries biggest rates vaccinations. Let‚Äôs hope get shit together. 
Thanks honesty though even know efficacy yet. 

US desperate straits two months UK currently hot seat. Yeah salient part. vaccines, even people part minority became symptomatic rarely severe form disease.

So vaccine ""only"" 80% effective getting form disease, close 100% effective winding dead it.

If holds true one, feel less safe taking it. I'm worried dying permanently disabled COVID, equivalent cold days. Small pox still level four labs waiting idiot release it. think argument potentially high levels false negatives among suspected covid-19 cases fundamentally flawed. sensitivity PCR tests groups studies. Positive results indicate that, almost 20 times infections placebo group, thus false negatives also follow suit. Even Dr. Doshi saying true many false negatives, would affect groups proportionally, keeping efficacy rate. someone explain whole safety vaccines conspiracies wrong? keep seeing loads people near preaching conspiracy feel like brain fried know think anymore testing kids kids symptomatic contact tracing US KNOW kids spreading it...but guess would yes do. like spread every little bug,virus,bacteria fungus cute grubby little hands land on. virus already RNA plus lot stuff makes body nasty immune response. know efficacy yet? even try?

LOL, no. Many hospitals even rehire many nurses laid last spring. Eating like pig creates pressure health care system. That's taking toll rights moment. I'm sorry 40+ BMI kind absurd shut society shit. That's thoughts well. 50% effective, expect 50% cases study 100% effective vaccine. anyone working methods getting taste back? surprising - US one huge fucking petri dish. That‚Äôs reasonable, good luck, challenge everyone! Hopefully start making progress spring able ever get Life Insurance

And importantly, health insurance. YES! actually got info immunologist Q&amp;A day. vaccine likely produce stronger longer lasting immunity/resistance.

The mRNA vaccines engineered trigger *specific* immune response spike protein, essential virus able reproduce infect cells. critical virus' survival, changes spike protein would compromise vaccine's effectiveness likely mutations.

A 'natural' immune response generate antibodies immune functions *many* parts virus- may may include strong response spike. immunity COVID infection likely compromised mutations variants change characteristics immune system remembers. Neither I. think government plays important role play even bigger role health care, example.

Yet frustrating smartest minds working CDC, yet actively promoted recommendation would difficult implement lead lives lost.

Was virtue signaling? actually think better lose lives? Even worse elderly POC one susceptible groups there, thrown bus.

I honestly even want know many thousands lives lost recommendation. Like said, glad finally corrected hope learned lesson. I‚Äôm novavax phase 3. deathly allergic penicillin, doctor monitoring didn‚Äôt care allergic. good. Faucci said would 5,000 deaths per day April people didn‚Äôt believe him. Rightfully so...what fool. See, America like greatest. figure better that, clearly shooting 5,000 deaths per day end January. April closer 10k/day. made meaning expect defend thought said?

The difference really ain't think Sweden secret strategy lying it.

It's complete secret they've admitted discussion pointless.

As always comes you. die Covid-21 deniers like ""BUT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION 6%"" yet still people vaccinated lot countries Europe ugh. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs healthy things vs killing thinking behind that. think it‚Äôs killing vs killing others.

So continue eat McDonald‚Äôs kill way, can‚Äôt exert enclosed space people around might coronavirus kill someone else that.

Also, exercise certainly isn‚Äôt banned, exercise indoors people. Like McDonald‚Äôs isn‚Äôt banned, eating indoors people (dining inside). it‚Äôs consistent way. That's happens tell people fattest state country, one highest smoking rates, people obesity smokers eligible get vaccine, despite fact many people much higher priority still gotten there's yet mid-February earliest.  Strongly agree. guy wizard behind curtain getting things done record time Donald. Release it. best thing did. I'm surprised considered 'news'.

Covid damage redditors covid subs yelling since April timeframe. dying. possibility becoming handicapped able ever get Life Insurance. many old folks survived first couple waves. Socialized medicine expensive, need finish wankers off.  

(/s don‚Äôt understand sarcasm) nothing stopping spread COVID, it‚Äôs limiting foreign strains entering country. case calling 1918 flu Spanish flu uneducated started America. NYSE closed Monday, likely Tuesday.  Termination. really hoping employer steps moment state figures wants vaccinate 'essential' employees arranges vaccinations. Losing one employee one day costs lot money, losing someone 1-2 weeks costs significantly more, big financial incentive get us vaccinated ASAP. actually right around infections peaked Spring, meaning way late.

Deaths peaked mid April, due incubation time time takes actually die virus would guess actualy peak infections late March. treated thousands patients since March.  
Of them, tells CBS 11 News COVID-19 symptoms show severe chest X-ray every time.  
And asymptomatic show severe chest X-ray 70 80% time.  
**‚ÄúThere still people say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm fine don‚Äôt issues‚Äô pull chest X-ray absolutely bad chest X-ray,‚Äù said.** Hey - make fun us California; highly talented Schwarzenegger running things here, I'm sure still governor would gone commando found way terminate COVID across whole state, unlike Newsom facing petition total recall. Depends live. 24 decent Google. Give try. Excellent! hope every state runs tomorrow! least know vaccines used plan next round. Open country guys haven‚Äôt school? district full-time person entire year. option parents keep kids home teachers simultaneously teach kids class Zoom. 

Oh, bumped teachers back vaccination list. think you‚Äôll find favoring re-opening want teachers staff vaccinated, seems like reasonable balance ever flu vaccine before?

Flu vaccines made anew year. Shocking. could seen coming. Going 65 plus stupid. Look WV smartly gone 80 plus 70 plus. 60 plus comes next. Going one 65 one move dumb. 3.7 million? Wow. UK alone done 3 million. mock relentlessly. can‚Äôt fix them, fun expense Love love love took mine today. Glad hear you‚Äôre okay side effects. 

They told expect arm pain, similar tetanus shot hours. confirm? own. doctor helpless, even reply messages weeks. research find place accepting high risk patients area. Found hospital hour away me, stayed night book one 10,000 allotted appointments open March, took longest nap ever lol. 

Look state's guidelines they're allowing hospitals give immunocompromised people. questions:

1. stops cells producing viral protein rest life (presumably leaving permanent state inflammation must forever immune response viral proteins made body)?

2. RNA inside cell mutate cause unknown cell malfunction (as opposed correctly producing viral protein intended)?

3. prevents immune system attacking native cells along side viral protein? is, stops immune system identifying body's cells targets attack attacking protein? plan let kids finish last months school year online, like they've done rest year. Call schoolyear wash start person next year, everyone's vaccinated.

Meanwhile, work roll social programs. impossible, enough people motivated. example, district quickly put together program deliver meals students, free, regardless income level. alone huge. Let's keep ball rolling. think pretty safe say midwest mountain states past peak. Like said, vaccinations enough people recently infected really think there's chance things reach former peaks.

As country, we're already vaccinating three times number official cases per day rate going accelerate next several weeks. Tomorrow likely hit one million people vaccinated day first time. end February think almost certainly 60+ million people vaccinated expect see noticeable drop number deaths then. great. kill outright, still get comorbidity before. Yeah cells produce protein infect cells city, 19 LTC first dose. interesting see couple weeks worked hit hard. People need good news works. Valid concern, known side effects fatality rate COVID worse nearly every level, addition *more unknown long term* *side effects*. unknown vaccine small risk take save lives get back form normalcy. already signed papers get vaccinated can't wait. Yes. recapitalize struggling small businesses, can't bring people back dead. ""Long term effects still unknown"" (from link posted) also referring to, impossible time say certainty. probably know many years. think Schengen zone still closed necessarily. think that's two shots. second shot ups response level allows body immunity longer. (I'm expert, speculating based I've read) I've saying thing!

Anti-vaxxers making $20k/year would quietly get vaccine way. Kinda funny putting potentially lifesaving medical news behind paywall. (Waving hysterically government) don‚Äôt pay me! Give shots! bring friends? LOT friends? Also, delay hidden statistics like often countries. Sweden reports deaths death date lag becomes visible. country reports deaths report date, idea *how long ago deaths actually happened*. It‚Äôd make lot people hold too. Make universal anyone gets one. Unlikely. Vaccine production expanded extend period 5-7 months. Several hundreds millions maybe, billion - definitely no. going open Schengen zone flights? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right withhold vaccine people forced exposed (and likely spread it) people capable staying home resume unnecessary activities.

They vaccinated resume unnecessary activities, vaccinated likely die get disease.  ask get it? lymphoma. Breaking Barriers! thought doable plan, invent manufacture really good mask. It‚Äôs right army‚Äôs alley. no. muddling along. wish Biden would order military order everyone wear them. first dose, sore arm nothing else **(besides feeling euphoria newfound hope future)**

relatable ü§£

How long take started feeling sleepy developed fever?

I remember taking flu shot developing chills/fever within 12 hrs ever happened never again. I‚Äôm annoyed. got TDAP booster yesterday; means, apparently, need wait 14 days getting COVID vaccine. Wish I‚Äôd known yesterday could get shot week..... call BS. findings show gut microbiome diminished based severity infection due intensity cytokine storm produced body trying fight infection. say fuck covid? aunt, mom‚Äôs twin, passed away Covid hours ago. RN. Thankfully fellow nurses around passed wasn‚Äôt alone. heart hurts much right now. Probably means like 60-80% chasing 90% keep up. ELI5 what's normal O2 level? measures? lol time bunch millennials busybody housewives tell us awesome vegan diet smoothies! ""but warns known cancer-causing materials containment unit"" üòú forget European country significant part population already infected need vaccine. vaccination going. problem Olympics European countries, probably south America countries vaccinating enough, African able exactly know state pandemic countries think Anti body tests.

Doctors want know long term effects. start find lung problems asymptomatics, start scanning everyone antibodies check effects. wrong: third Americans one comorbidities, counting age (65+). normal. still terrified. ""going motions"" kind way. vaccine news actually brought back lot fear. interesting see London keep lockdown place virus gone. Almost nobody willing that.

I found article similar question too. One family member extremely high cholesterol mild heart arrhythmia issues. extremely high risk medical conditions considering COVID affects heart lot? would qualify now? Sweet Home Alabama! Per capita Mass 3rd highest deaths; idk right strategy lower Me, wife son recovering covid write this. asthma oxygen level one point dropped 93. hit 91 90, would ER. bit scary honestly. I‚Äôm also runner 50 thought would handle okay. 7 days still coughing brains out.  opposed person's recklessness. comes Florida man, never sure since almost anything Florida man plausible. quarantine, that's really best thing do. Letting others guinea pigs figuring vaccine best smart thing do. can't quarantine, better get vaccine. would lose money. Thanks, aware that. thinking kind unfair discriminate age since younger people pose greater transmission risk. 

I imagining Boomers lived full life surviving vaccinated Millennials still lot contribute society die become disabled weren't. guess: good chunk population vaccinated combined people realizing covid can't eradicated. still see lot media/politicians/laypeople still hoping reach point cases magically gone. florida? good? want 20 upvotes sub need use several paragraphs say florida bad. done 3% first weeks almost recipients gotten 1 shot. One way look 2 shots per person, inject enough reach 200%. stick 250 day timeline double injection rate compared now. like hope doable though. government produced managed trials vaccines. US government simply provided funding infrastructure aid vaccine makers would simultaneously produce vaccine run phase three trials. 

Also exchange ‚Äúallergic reaction‚Äù ‚Äúanaphylactic‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen lots people mild allergic reactions two mRNA vaccines. exquisitely low number serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) either vaccine zero patients died it. data there, safe take. tl;dr 6600 health care workers positive antibodies 2 experienced researchers called ""probable"" reinfections, 42 others experienced ""possible"" reinfections.

I really idea 44 probable/possible reinfections 6600 confirmed infections translates 83% efficacy preventing reinfections though.

44 6600 0.7%. Anyone expert care weigh this? Yeah National guard already helping throughout pandemic doesn‚Äôt matter isn‚Äôt physically enough vaccine. means every pharmacy Cali getting called every resident Cali 65 looking doses don‚Äôt exist. teachers? Grocery clerks? Postal/FedEx/ups workers? Kroger treated employees like absolute shit entire pandemic. give fuck anything profits. ended hero pay. write say anything customers wearing masks. store managers walk around maskless. They've many outbreaks within staff. suck ass. retrospect, think ""flatten curve"" problematic connotations. seems imply keeping infection levels sort tolerable bound, learning live manage infections ""safe"" level.

In reality, countries adopting mindset found difficult ""manage"" covid envisioned way; things seemed control Europe summer, soon conditions changed, virus ready flare quickly get control. contrast, countries adopted ""zero covid"" strategy much better experience.

The ""flatten curve"" messaging arose early days pandemic based understanding flu outbreaks. One year pandemic, clear covid, really safe level flatten curve to. need aim zero. Mississippi too. Plus health care workers. there's literally effort made convince people wear them, advertised sale. educate find internet. Thus, small percent population wearing appropriate masks.

With said, KF94 mask choice. Strikes nice balance comfort effectiveness. fair, that's never really Catholic church's stance medical treatments. *Maybe* even two inaccurate, ""supposed quarantine"" returning citizens Australia. go mandatory Hotel Quarantine. recent outbreaks due staff working hotels accidentally getting infected, increased testing daily Diabetes attacks every part body. couple decades one diabetes significantly aged compared one without. wager almost deaths people 60 are, part, due people diabetes. single economist NPR referring Robert Litan actually work practicing economist rather he's sport law columnist Athletic partner anti-trust law firm. He's opinion far expert one.

In addition, idea well thought-out speaking general platitudes might happen using economic theory literally textbook real practice. quote says all:

""His plan would cost country $250 billion $300 billion. Litan says would drop bucket compared economic harm pandemic persists.""

Yep, U.S. government hundreds billions dollars (already multiple trillion dollar deficit) consequence generalization something ""not even close"" lack growth GDP country already experiencing near year now. plan save economy destroying inflating entity regulates it: nice.

Or course people really bad x-ray showing chronic symptoms months Covid. ICUs full, deaths causes age groups (young people car crashes work accidents) skyrocketing. You‚Äôre forgetting quick covid death isn‚Äôt hospital drain. It‚Äôs people survive covid strain hospital beds weeks months.  ‚ÄúLive covid forever‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean masks, distancing, quarantines, rolling lock downs, etc forever, even years. virus circulates doesn‚Äôt upend society like now. likely less dangerous too.  agree get vaccinated soon available me, another thing consider this: get vaccine, know taking (low) risks vaccine, get vaccine, take (higher) risks covid actually get covid. There's guarantee actually get infected get vaccinated. still, I'd rather go low risk vaccine higher risk get covid. I'm downvoting strongly disagree ""complete logistical failure"". That's doomerism.

The roll far perfect numerous issues. project scope complexity going teething issues hiccups early days rollout scales up.

Mind you, county mandatory masks awhile, there's reason discrepancy. sucky situation around. That's quite anecdotal. Anyway, masks recommended public transport certain times.

Lol, insane.  fair worked last time.

Till Americans rocked like


 ""Noooo, let us oppress culture cause want exploi.. mean trade you""

It's 21st century. I'm sure US foreign affairs advance mindset since then..... internal discussion discuss options. external discussions communicate decision.""

Ok quote said discussing possible scenarios internally. vaccine could *somehow* eradicate virus entire planet even though lot people take it, realistic I'm regular human(24) asthma I'm technically risk. get vaccine? get it?  think are, want sound pessimist but: vaccinations extremely slow lot countries, like many europeans. deadlines already moving almost fall...

Strains expanding alarming rate, many countries going borders closed quite lot type.

So international event kind going happen year... Yeah remember get certain vaccines school. also realize emergency care workers hospital workers would different regulations things nature. something would part original hiring paperwork. jobs never brought up. mean course middle pandemic before. made think HR ramifications requiring something like vaccines. yet country McDonalds open take away gyms closed. Fucking disgrace. things still bad around time definatly should. ""The results non-human primate trial outstanding oral think oral right strategy.

Best quote coronavirus article *ever*. Appreciate reading. middle high schools, though? Stadiums open too. Actually informed comments sub. 'Rumor' may misnomer, like deduction since Slaoui stated Johnson &amp; Johnson may apply EUA end January, means week 25 January. infer J&amp;J want put press release next week, potentially beginning week, would help stock price rise throughout following trading days. may wrong, course, next Monday, Tuesday, Thursday dates keep mind. Every major urban area US covid essentially beginning program. No. Again, less deadly confers greater rate spread. Viruses mutate contagious - full stop.

Get vaccine continue working what‚Äôs necessary catch virus.... simple concept one seems understand. wife also essential Here‚Äôs reading AAMC Starting Monday, N95 required Bavaria grocery shopping. terribly 25%, Texas 49% Florida New York 40%

""In internal discussion discuss options. external discussions communicate remember lot UK US articles shitting lax Swedish approach. wonder two countries doing.

Our neighbours expressed scepticism well. They've polite obvious reasons, still seem quite critical handled pandemic here, every right, seeing death toll way higher things considered.

Edit: im excited
.. last time felt elevation/hope like ages ago Heart attack cancer two absolutely awful things nearly everybody lost somebody to. there's separate thing killing additional 100% people usually kill that's supposed enormous deal? *and* less deadly, generally speaking country world vaccinating 10 % population day?

On thing hope, daydreaming another... boyfriend tested positive Saturday sick since last Tuesday. say sick mean basically cold cold symptoms ended Friday. got tested Friday discovered couldn‚Äôt smell anything. 

He‚Äôs quarantined room since Saturday fine since then. Seriously thing wrong can‚Äôt smell taste anything. he‚Äôs bored mind. 

He still quarantine next Tuesday. question going take turn worse, average day happens? know case different can‚Äôt answered 100% certainty I‚Äôm curious there‚Äôs time frame symptom onset people start experience complications.

Keep mind everyone, American state far away country zero impact everyday life. $100 says one cops running around without mask. better article would many lives impact end due negligence case. Cop typically = Trump licker.
It's kinda easy assume hypothesis accurate guess. evidence really support assertion. California terribly 25%, Texas 49% Florida New York 40%. Indeed Texas given shots despite smaller. really California poorly among large states. Meanwhile several small states also poorly. Sounds like understand situation then. Greenhouse gases cause global warming, viruses successfully mutate contagious. keep saying South African variant etc can‚Äôt say wuhan virus it‚Äôs insane lol nurse, Pfizer shots. First shot, minor headache pain injection site. Second shot, pain injection site tired (though later might parent life).

We're long run. LOL people April saying this'll soon. ....right? Lol legal? mentality even wear mask lol brain? speak real people everybody specially expats admit swedes wear face masks everybody surprised nobody cares. 

But keep twisting argument never give clear view what's actually happening sweden.

From people met experience since march 2020 say life sweden never real pandemic right bus, supermarkets, restaurants pretty much nobody wears face masks.

I hope international media exposes truth sweden unfair countries paying high price way life destroyed individual freedoms taken away, swedes getting away use ambiguous language hide truth. Please apologize class slowing reading OP‚Äôs statement correctly. 

‚Äúwhen‚Äù ‚Äúwill‚Äù context known future tense. let rephrase that: ""You said \[probably based generalized observation\] discussing options internally. discussions decide strategy 'after decided ""free interpretations""? Seeing pattern here

It's free interpretation direct quote, also contradicts claim ""alternative theory"".

Black Plague still us, Tuberculosis. Yet ‚Äòmanaged‚Äô keeping vaccinations date providing Listening public Health Services. lol what? act God. m

30mn w/50% protection 1% 95% protection back tests extremely hard get. one really knows number cases early spring sick got tested. point places it‚Äôs easy get tested much fewer cases missed. authors seem suggest gut microbiota determine severity infection. Would reverse causality also explain data, i.e. could severity infection determine composition gut microbiota? Probably, yes.

If results exposure thus worse symptoms, probably would mean older patient would harder time things.

I think that's big though. lot stuff I've seen far indicates infections, lethal. I'm going quiet night in, think.

Might even order food delivery. Yes, probably die. Even high risk group, chances dying went significantly vaccine....I'd call pretty big step toward normalcy. It‚Äôs type 2 right now.

From posts thread sounds like really care people. People like ones make life enjoyable others around you, hope see relief soon. No, shouldn't. specifically asked anecdote need hard evidence. 

My comment taken actual argument indication situation Sweden whole, rather description personal experience.

Our experiences differ, many reasons this, example could live different parts Sweden. make either experiences ""deceptive"" ""untruthful"", taken facts. anything, difference respective experiences highlights problems anecdotal evidence.

Rolling Please explain class Biden ‚Äòreleased‚Äô vaccines entire week becomes president? idea. still something like 70% doses unused expansion able go supply quickly. enough doses freezers completely vaccinate Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, still hundred thousand doses left over. It‚Äôs ridiculous.   r/titlegore yet. America literally giving people COVID ensure corporate profits right now. Human dignity never valued corporate profits history. 90% people study producing antibodies day 29, 100% day 57, number antibodies detected per sample increased time period. study showing vaccine safe, generates immune response everybody.

I can‚Äôt tell effective antibodies stage - percentage people still got covid study, even wasn‚Äôt symptomatic, anyone got severe covid. quite low.

  completely alter calculus: faster people immunized, better. efficient vaccination rollout could shorten timeline year, even six months, coronavirus become endemic infection.  vaccines unlikely eradicate coronavirus, Dr. Lavine predicted. virus become permanent, albeit benign, inhabitant environment.  experts said scenario plausible likely.  overall intellectual construct paper fully agree with,‚Äù said Shane Crotty, virologist La Jolla Institute Immunology San Diego.  vaccines prevent people transmitting virus, ‚Äúthen becomes lot like measles scenario, vaccinate everybody, including kids, really don‚Äôt see virus infecting people anymore,‚Äù Dr. Crotty said.  plausible vaccines prevent illness ‚Äî necessarily infection transmission, added. means coronavirus continue circulate.  unlikely vaccines right going provide sterilizing immunity,‚Äù kind needed prevent infection, said Jennifer Gommerman, immunologist University Toronto.  infection coronavirus produces strong immune response nose throat. current vaccines, Dr. Gommerman said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre getting natural immune response actual upper respiratory tract, you‚Äôre getting injection arm.‚Äù raises likelihood infections still occur, even vaccination.

nvm school absolutely traumatic number kids, thriving remote learning ways never could subject bullying, racial discrimination etc. k-12 school even teachers picked weird kids, many dropped out-i'm sure opportunity learn without shit they'd done better (but i'm old online charters option) youngest brother part J&amp;J clinical trial Detroit got study effects vaccine broad range ethnicities (mixed group different races, Latinos, African Americans, Asians). previously ill CoVid got lead project job. got injection, became ill (his roommates considered calling ambulance him) day felt fine afterwards. goes back clinic every often antibody levels measured. Survival fittest then. vaccines available wants it. Agree. vaccines, time period second dose least x amount time. come second dose late, start over. mention psych ward. Puzzling. immune response vaccine difficult talk doctor going getting vaccine truly hope so. Sure, smoke comes out. idea unfitted masks stop larger aerosols disbursed people, primary concern virus. fit need perfect. Even fit KN95 KF94 rather well (ear loop design), probably leak exhaling nose area. Interesting, seems like Denmark effective systems reporting then. guess one advantages centralized approach.

It little hard find information Sweden, seems like covid deaths need reported separately actual death certificate. deaths reported specific database reported electronically paper. find information guidelines fast report needs done. guess Wednesdays cross-check death registers testing registers find deaths reported Socialstyrelsen SmiNet.

I think also 21 regions database deaths first reported, forwarded SmiNet. 

A decentralized healthcare pros, think big con pandemic. centralized healthcare would've helped lot handling crisis, comes reporting numbers.

This based able find online, though. Someone insight could probably provide much better description. 1. important remember minimizing exposure equally important wearing mask. Minimizing social activities people outside household HUGE curbing spread virus. dining restaurant, would argue contributing spread. Take-out contactless delivery options readily available protect employees restaurant. 

2. agree better options available, think also equally shameful Worker‚Äôs Comp masks distributes past summer U.S. protective. currently college, received equally inferior mask university expected feel comfortable attending in-person class. 

This frustrates 2 main reasons: 

a) sustainable someone buy protective mask themselves, environmental sense economic/financial sense. Non-reusable surgical masks already found bulk floating oceans. I‚Äôve seen discarded parking lots without care. time caring Earth becoming increasingly urgent critical matter, increased waste without sustainable solution feeding demise planet‚Äôs delicate ecosystem. 

b) Moreover, low-income families may equal access effective mask protection N95s consumerism/increased demand drive prices supply remains constant/decreases (not economist, using understanding economics). ultimately perpetuating social inequalities society. rich middle class afforded healthcare protection, working/lower class left behind. 

3) agree would helpful CDC FDA provide specific examples good facial coverings, wonder issues ‚Äúendorsing‚Äù given product. Considering FDA government agency, I‚Äôm sure boundaries this. CDC government agency, seeks minimize partiality political affiliation (although certain things I‚Äôm learning semester political affairs class really much gray line people realize, boil politics matters opinion/beliefs). 

Anyways, that‚Äôs little morning coffee Reddit vibe. Thanks reading did. Everyone please stay safe socially distance, wear mask, love humanity, wash yo damn hands. Lets go university, GMU! Interestingly Bavaria made use FFP2 (basically N95 EU) mask go store public transport. I'd say 20-30% people use anyway government started give free (or low cost) vulnerable people. get online pretty easily 1 EUR last quite while. 

Even reduces R 0.1 guess worth fairly easy measure take harm economy. People 85+ 85-90% chance surviving even without vaccine get COVID. 60-69 age group 97-98% percent surviving even without vaccine happen COVID. vaccine thought prevent death general, let's assume actuality effective 99% time (seems unlikely, we're assuming worst-case scenario here).

.01*2.5%=.025% chance death get COVID, still statistically unlikely 1-week travel scenario (see: tens millions people going bars indoor house parties months still managed contract far).

If figure even 1/5 chance getting COVID trip (in reality less this), .005% chance die trip. Or, 1 20,000. state seems holding back 70%. We‚Äôve used 30% on-hand vaccine. It‚Äôs unconscionable. Half million doses gathering dust freezers. It‚Äôs like state shortage elderly people need want them, process broken. Even many hospital workers delayed.

Of course, that‚Äôs probably due poor planning incompetence local bureaucracy. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

There‚Äôs way I‚Äôm picking cloth better ones. admit temptation break rules stymied idea catch now, last 10 months basically waste. longer go, determined try avoid can. That's problem sensationalized media really helped create short attention spans. US especially, we're shiny, new, breaking stories, events, objects. important news stories technically reported downplayed picked en masse. Consider little waves made Pentagon confirmed UFO videos real one paid mind it. different year, would played up, speculated, spoofed, kinds stuff.

Covid played hard beginning made divisive become background noise basically everyone. People care still want, people taking protective measures, can. vaccine rollout sensationalized missed metrics initial projections even that's boiled arguing. really exhausting continually hear people argue back forth topic us kind left pick path make way through.

In April, ready what's necessary virus 1/3 less rampant now. certainly can't lock year shows there's attitude shift 6-8 months. know someone 70's made bunch cloth masks way back masks bought shown (through text- yes text) articles like one explain differences masks ineffective made. definately differences masks sure. problem put one masks go wherever to. goes grocery stores instead getting pick up, goes massage, accupunture, physical therapy, clothes shopping, craft store, on. stupid. surely read. lots money buy masks. also literally reason leave house well.

Do really know someone got virus totally following recommendation ? I've known someone who's died back march last year. 70s, NHS straight gave he's high risk worth saving. really higher. Public health officials going, ""oops bad, cloth masks told wear 10 months suck, wear masks instead"" ""masks nothing public, wear masks"" going increase confidence public health guidelines.

It may complicated approach, certainly remarkable. Full respirators generally filter incoming air. think near full attendance outdoors question tbh Yes everyone heard do

Its another matter mindset people need have. individuals don‚Äôt control wider situation individuals needed across wider country, things change. There‚Äôs use worrying things beyond control, instead worry things directly control. 

 goes life general. things happen matter what. limit impact focus control rather control never have. Taxes come limit impact budgeting. Coronavirus here, limit impact socially distancing, wearing masks washing hands. say tax rates governmental reaction Covid take action minimise impact.

I seen family &amp; friends, eaten restaurant, travelled, done non-essential shopping outings, except occasional hike, almost year. behavior changing matter latest mutation is. People ignoring guidance CDC health officials probably going change either.

We've reached bit equilibrium everyone drawn line sand we're waiting turn vaccine. Takes 2 weeks vaccine take effect. Full protection stated 95% achieved 2 weeks second dose. Yeah reinfection different there‚Äôs data stating immune people get infected transmit virus 

Also got 83% rate beyond lmfao actively rejected it. Airborne virus. Go poorly ventilated room people lots different households. Airborne virus spreads.  That‚Äôs stop believing Iraq war lies uncovered. Fear monger harder daddy... customer. would wrong then. employer doesn‚Äôt gave rules ‚Äúwear mask‚Äù actually gave us kn95s

You wear masks provided accordance manufacturers instructions. get checking validity 50,000 people‚Äôs masks daily would major pain ugh isn‚Äôt strange psychological thing.

However, expecting compassionate, timely results current system futile. covid-free interwebs hug, friend buddy high school shortly beginning driving came conclusion ""stopping 4-way stops chumps. stop everyone else going to.""

This self-centered, narcissistic reasoning antimaskers. ""While rely everyone else right thing I'm going refuse right thing everyone else."" fact I've seen one guy it, guy.

So clearly bald bearded men glasses hate vaccines. Unless cop every corner city every store, I'm sure stringent rules heftier fines would do. 

Besides, plenty cops pretty loose mask wearing habits...this whole mask thing requires respect health institutions, social trust moral leadership, none America (or, matter, countries) lot of. Lol, yeah right. 15 min, viral particles would dispersed wind several km. second dose window narrow. don‚Äôt get day 21 (or 28 one) current immunity doesn‚Äôt disappear. Delaying week three hinder long term effectiveness. UK waiting 12 weeks doses, though debate waiting long.

There far Pfizer Moderna doses vaccine pipeline. get vulnerable segment population first dose Fast, hospital overloads loads deaths prevented greatly reduced since vaccine surprisingly effective couple weeks one dose. trouble later getting sufficient vaccine, stop vaccinating new people (who lower risk categories anyway) give second doses high risk people. meantime, one two vaccines approved also start vaccinating lower risk people high risk people didn‚Äôt get first round shots. J&amp;J ask approval soon. Evers good guy, efficient bureaucrat. would fine normal times, challenges faced pandemic evil legislature/Supreme Court.  supposed vaccine 18 months. science done incredible, basically miracle. Vaccines coming early basically completely bailed government, absolutely failed enact decent, sustainable plan could enacted 18 months + distribution. Ask floor leader! smart man (according himself). like Great Wonderful OZ. hard work past year making go away like miracle.  Lol Still waiting world stop hating Quite literally economy cannot function much longer restrictions. Either vaccine solves problems care problems anymore. everywhere else due underreporting. People get vaccine get infected. result end.  wish name Larry Brilliant. extreme mean cases like 'people getting welded home' posted above, guys getting cuffed tied pole willing obey lockdown rules, tell examples rare instances, mostly early stage outbreak last year desperate contain spread used someone repeatedly broke rules. Yes there's difference China Taiwan's methods, definitely say Taiwan good work, big differences two terms things like population size, medical resources per capita, public's general awareness, well. makes sense compare approaches without counting aspects. actually assumes many anti-vax idiots refuse get vaccine. are, drag months year CCP propaganda works. ignore democratic countries well dealing COVID imply country competitive ‚Äústudying Chinese experience‚Äù better question many people wearing masks all? Unfortunately untrue. I've seen numerous people use reason vaccine ""doesn't work"". even worse, gives coronavirus. Humans incredibly bad risk assessment. look something like terrorism, incredibly unlikely affect yet Americans support throwing billions dollars prevention. literally likely die random wasp sting terrorism US.

Covid opposite, several magnitudes likely kill close family members anything else likely encounter daily lives yet many people decided risks small (they aren't). mean receiving vaccine it‚Äôs good 5 months? Sounds like OCD literally allow get I'm Spain last time fully lockdowned May partially lockdowned June. curfew limits October, etc hard lockdown lol. Bars still open 6 pm area though that's change following days. France gone harder measures year measures exceptionally hard compared UE. things significantly worse October 10 pm curfews shops, outdoor bars schools cut time Actually much better government‚Äôs. following progression China since mid-January, bought oxygen separator, enough toilet paper outlast initial surge. 

I prepared fellow countrymen‚Äôs inability stop pandemic Spring/Summer, increasingly difficult maintain vigilance many months. sad since virus stopped August. agree. ""boat"" design KF94s really good. recently started using breathe lot better three-layer cloth masks using. They're decently re-usable I'm little sad seek months before. Still waiting common sense go get it? Appointment care doctor? CVS walk-in appointment? Looking get grandfather vaccinated today possibly since medical conditions may qualify me. fair, let get straight. believe vaccine, going go jail ruined injections, going go jail stuck whole bunch inmates coughing going begging it? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it? say mfbrucee wants Swedes dead say that‚Äôs true. protecting ‚Äúthe image mfbrucee‚Äù trying correct information?

You‚Äôre right though. It‚Äôs absurd.   guy looks like half dudes America‚Äôs Wanted üò≥üò¨ lower thresholds natural immunity. People likely get spread get first. random vaccination, need higher numbers.  Even somehow allowed licence no-one would employ like looking same. makes easier avoid them. May make recommendation tool like 98.6 get primary doc via text inexpensively?  Oh, downvote accurate comment above? thing that's interesting 70% went unused 60-70% declined it. Know audience. mean whole lot see phase III data, single-dose vaccine could really help move things along. Canada already 38 million doses secured, could fully vaccinated pretty quickly depending fast J&amp;J pump doses. small benefits cannot excluded, find significant benefits case growth restrictive NPIs (stay home orders business closures) Similar reductions case growth may achievable less restrictive interventions. Lower herd immunity natural immunity. vaccinating randomly population, indeed need higher numbers like Fauci saying. We'll mix natural infection vaccination, it'll somewhere between. ‚Äúmild‚Äù case.

Did someone tell telling that? literally die mean mild case.

You severe case.

I mild case... 99% asymptomatic, issues 5 days worth brain fog mild exhaustion came 2.5 weeks quarantining. making things up, cool! story woman putting elder relatives risk death considered ‚ÄúGood News‚Äù? postpone fucking wedding it‚Äôs actually safe one! mean wont wearing mask distancing? wil someone demand put mask keep distance , say vaccinated ? Behealthyusa.net 

I feel KF94s easiest people USA get decent product reasonably sure mask genuine really good filtration also protects wearer. gain like 20 pounds get vaccinated? Challenge accepted! Nah....Pull plug imagine hospital bill üòÇü§Ø Except they've already fallen behind production, still weeks away EUA like. would *the* vaccine finished phase II trial 4-5 weeks ago, right may able help maintain timelines mentioned point. hard time seeing move anything forward unless produce substantial quantities quickly. non-authoritarian governments insanely bad human right abuses? think anyone bit global awareness knows true ""liberal democracies"" commit worst atrocities. Still , may infect kill others. need really really step mask mandates enforcing , go 10x harder people fail comply rules set things right course Australia, Taiwan New Zealand authoritarians supressed virus too, isn't? hero complex problem Brazilian variant infected healthcare worker previously COVId. suggests immunity original strain may effective Brazilian. [Brazilian strain reinfection worry new Brazilian Covid variant.

It's going affect small strip south. think you‚Äôre pulling asthma statistic ass. doctor said, said doctors agreed, asthma comorbidity, actually might decrease chances developing severe Covid. 5k come. Probably hit today. public educated enough know difference vaccinated sterilizing immunity.

Most people going think ""vaccination = can't get sick = can't get others sick"" nice straightforward that.

For instance, vaccinated person still get infected infectious period may small severe (even asymptomatic) due vaccine, could still hypothetically transmit virus diminished window. I‚Äôve never understood belief among people interested public health masks work one way. 

Oh sure, put mask flu patient, wearing one protect yourself? Probably doesn‚Äôt work! Because? talk /r/covidiots upvoting comments calling antimaskers shot without trial? jeez

Not that... holy shit, comments sub least somewhat upvoted. Wooooow. johnson Johnson asbestos products looked way bc going expensive fix... ill choose one two. makes sense little population vaccinated currently. vaccinated person may asymptomatic pass virus on. see ""it's over"" declaration summer, maybe closer year's end developed countries. Poorer countries likely lag behind that. 


However, vaccines approved coming months, believe end sights, sure. Trying compare China compared Mao era questionable. Completely different circumstances. evidence suggest China under-reporting deaths. looks like darkest timeline version *Les Nessman.* SEEN new N95 mask retailer frequent all, since April.

Also come vaccine seems causing side effects compared flu vaccine ? EUA approved one dose regimen. two dose regimen increase effectiveness, two dose regimen probably recommended full approval used post pandemic.

## Abstract

The rapid spread Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide disease caused virus, coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused global pandemic devastating social economic consequences. Throughout pandemic, several health systems overwhelmed light rapid emergence new cases within short period time. heavy workload imposed hospital services might negatively affected patients' outcomes exacerbated mortality rates.

Mortality predictions made using Monte-Carlo methods based multistate survival analysis set Cox regression models, first constructed validated nationwide cohort first stages pandemic Israel. show peak hospitalizations September October 2020, patient deaths significantly exceeded model's mortality predictions, reverting match predictions patient load subsided October, showing signs renewed excess mortality hospital load increasing since late December 2020. work emphasizes even countries healthcare system reach specific point defined insufficiency, increase hospital workload associated higher patient mortality, ruling factors related changes hospitalized population. addition, study highlights importance quantifying excess mortality order assess quality care, define appropriate carrying capacity severe patients order guide timely healthcare policies allocate appropriate resources.

What evidence current measures (when place) aren‚Äôt sufficient, data coming UK suggests are? course removed strain spread much quickly wasn‚Äôt point made. Helsingborg hit especially hard, I'm surprised they're bad keeping distance wearing masks. Mask use rising still low places, experience, Sure, China simply way open get away sort massive conspiracy. virus widespread like allege there's way could hide that. Furthermore there's logical reason try downplay virus. downplay easier spread eventually snowball control. far logical assumption forthright facts success due extremely aggressive actions they've taken combat virus. narrative makes way logical sense conspiracy theories. Somewhere around 600,000. majority grandmas grandpas, ‚Äúalmost dead‚Äù according Covid truthers. honest here...do really think US position it‚Äôs today many people Covid-19 driving across Canadian Mexican borders? experience, young people want anything parents days.

I think history always ""these days"". Youth culture start post-WWII America (though individualistic culture help curb popularity), young adulthood across many cultures times characterized divide time attention work, socializing peers, caring elders.

The main issue word ""want"". lot young people ""want"" something parents, problem modern society give much occasion so.

I would want stay home parents, society tells potential mates ""living mama's basement"" red flag comes finding love starting family.

I want job lets stay close parents, unfortunately, parents live high CoL area makes unaffordable.

I want take work visit parents, unfortunately, limited number days leave this.

My point young people nowadays different past, modern lifestyle expectations young people made harder balance productive member society (work), start grow family (socializing peers), care elders.

If lived society grew thinking sex roof parents live ""no big deal""; born, raised, lived, died within 20 miles; better life-work balance, whole bunch us would ""wanting"" something parents.   can't avoid activities totally, I'd really like know people get infected.

Unfortunately, German government, including RKI, running decent tracing experiments uncover circumstances transmission.

So go current trendy media guesses based n=115 case studies current social media rumours transmission routes parameters, hoping least partially connected reality. person needs mask occasional store doctor visit, issue isn‚Äôt looking standards, it‚Äôs knowing isn‚Äôt lying them. received much total crap Amazon, gamed reviews opened packages whatever, I‚Äôd like make sure I‚Äôm buying something someone didn‚Äôt slap total lie cheap imported stuff.

At least cloth mask know have. Currently need go back 28 days death number given date 90% complete: corona going good economy? 
 
Hear out, 240k dead means 240k inheritances lets say 500k people. 
 
The average time recieve inheritance buy new car like 10 weeks. people squander inheritances immediately. Meaning money fed back system becomes someone elses profit . Wouldn‚Äôt eligible phase 1c? antibody test end 10 days? Yep, that‚Äôs exactly happened. I‚Äôm hoping get one soon. hasn‚Äôt ANYWHERE since March lives alone.

So, FL strictly age.....are better CA/NY extra rules standards get when? lot sitting unused thrown states must poorly. Meaning, FL avg must half states worse. Aha. truth comes comments. Thanks, Twitter thread makes lot sense. really sucks. hope developed world open countries around summer. 13 yr old would there's site near us. let see asshole? Industrial health safety here. workplace shut right now. They‚Äôre literally handing packets saying ‚Äúprotocol social distancing work possible.‚Äù

The local health department worried getting slaughtered killing jobs keeping people safe, like, fuck, do? Close plant down, state unemployment system swamped isn‚Äôt helping anyone, hundreds people lose health insurance, shut anyway keep people dying week?

The USA fucked, we‚Äôre done, there‚Äôs winning. would reading counting taught kindergarten...   That‚Äôs exactly wait administration piece shit. Remember aide ready go? God amount lives lost one else could‚Äôve gotten control sooner -.- Mr. Rogers real deal. spread traced back domestic sources. 

Should make wonder inspires policy. Vaccine effective point one present argments sort someone trained field. I‚Äôm aware want comebacks claim thought saving people something. ruined doses, lost job, many lives think saved? don‚Äôt believe someone like think they‚Äôre hero. media spreading propaganda downplaying successes highlighting failures China.  He's Senator. unless daddy named Joel Miller  need. Immunity probably last years years. think article blaming kids. pointing kids likely transmit virus vulnerable, kids active. care it? wash hands, wear mask, already got first dose vaccine. life overwhelming deal much bad news. care mental health. 

I think democracy bit shambles little newsworthy moment.

FFS, I‚Äôm really worried inauguration next week. fuckery going go down? says fundamentally need reconsider societal norms accommodate longterm mitigation measures. 

She doesn‚Äôt say directly it‚Äôs obvious she‚Äôs implying. CDC's list high risk conditions, would skipping line? want vaccine distributors play god pick choose gets vaccine, we?

An international team researchers pooled data scores peer-reviewed papers capturing 399,000 patients. found people obesity contracted SARS-CoV-2 113% likely people healthy weight land hospital, 74% likely admitted ICU, 48% likely die. I‚Äôve read J&amp;J currently making production site Netherlands. Problem seems simple capacity make stockpile doses facility open. obey rules restrictions, I""m tired seeing people throw tantrums stores asked wear mask. evidence need vaccines yearly? Children less likely spread disease though. There‚Äôs actual studies think people realize poor mask try better one. mom wearing surgical masks said felt safe. gave kf94 said felt much protective. realized loose surgical mask better seal analogy totally wrong. understand why, need someone explain? one binary mindset lol. Sure, pharmacists spend 6 - 8 years school studying physiology, biology, biochemistry, microbiology, human anatomy, etc. people remember details 9th-grade science, pharmacist's job remember details. good thing can't spread anyone lesser health! issue rate kills perfectly young people incredibly low. mean ban water probably kills young people Good generally anxious person learning early saved lot worry. fault country especially high population downright stupid people. part make sure family close friends same. I'm guessing problem awareness. know program area sign up. believe Astra Zeneca‚Äôs vaccine already there. Would great another think they‚Äôre already ramping production one. two also great another big bottleneck getting raw ingredients mRNA vaccines. produced much quickly. even aren‚Äôt effective they‚Äôll able inoculate people several times fast, may super important immunity vaccines ends lasting 6-12 months like scientists said possibility. worthless since made stretch breathable. Fabric stretching face means larger gaps fibers equals protection. There's evidence people natural immunity covid (from getting sick once) catch spread covid. likely true vaccines well.

So vaccinating teachers protect teachers children community large. Also assuming covid mutate significantly due ongoing half-assed vaccination effort, seems unlikely day. line dumb.

All they‚Äôre arguing potentially turning people want get vaccine order return normal life, thus slowing progress toward herd immunity.

It‚Äôs extremely unlikely vaccinated person contract disease, it‚Äôs guarantee vaccinated people contract serious disease. Even rare people contract disease spite vaccination small number contribution overall background spread negligible. Meanwhile, people still losing homes businesses fallout restrictions speak.

We selling vaccine way let people ‚Äújail‚Äù ‚Äî restrictions ‚Äî go back normal lives enjoy things like large scale socialization indoor dining again. Period.

The cases vaccine fails prevent contraction disease followed transmission way measure benefits selling program way. understand frustration post 1.) month healthcare workers could get it, currently people 75 65 could get it.

The reason frustration that, *due access limitations*, vaccines sitting unused.

Prioritization good, allowed result major slowdown distribution. need getting shots arms.

What means that, healthcare worker can't get vaccinated another two weeks due scheduling, etc. vaccine *reserved them* (i.e. sitting unused freezer two weeks), instead used immediately someone else. (more less) gambling fact vaccine arrived two weeks use vaccinate said heath care worker. would genuinely idea comment trying say. Yeeeep! sadly... I‚Äôd say 60% people talk say won‚Äôt get it. 60 years ago done good effect tv station got telegraph (cheaper phone call!) headline. film details would shipped truck arrive time 11:00 news.

Today satellites (1980s technology!) even internet (you know new thing...) information available live, marketing developed back still exists. Yes, patient.

This 'Merica. us insurance. Yeah, that's whole point first post, dumb binary mindset. first ultra-cautious. sanitized groceries brought home.

Overtime I've come realize things. one, can't avoid risk. two, risk appears overstated. least initially thought contagious is.

At stage live life normal, modifications. wear N95 everywhere go. meet friends outside + mask. go outdoor events. go shopping stores. thing sit eat drink restaurant. friends adopted life style. around 10 close friends none us got it.

I'm professional here, take will. anecdotal experience, virus spreading prolonged indoor exposure. people would wear masks stop meeting families indoors stop sit dining drinking, could largely eliminate virus. sure, please increase speed scale vaccinations ridiculous Probably people r/Sino bots. also upvote downvote comment together. read Chinese forum CCP lovers feel sub anti CCP want correct it.  curiosity, articles read that? Couple things. PCR tests result less false positives antigens testing results more. article doesn‚Äôt mention testing method used. article also acknowledges higher rates false positives early testing could likely cause. widen lens look prevalence confirmed reinfection worldwide find it‚Äôs extremely low. 10 within players population NBA alone anomaly warrants investigation. article little gossip. let‚Äôs vaccinate teachers. Thankfully places starting OMG, going terrible Cable News. can't that.  help edit proper grammar would gladly, i'm Brazil. ""coup attempt"" got close success trying LA Lakers.

did invite court tryout? that's close get realize interviews edited censored people specific narrative tell, call agenda bias. need talk people lived it, believe different conversation. I'm engaging further... LOL. keep reading keep fooling yourself. background rate infection high USA, true regardless article says. Lmao, defined evil yourself. one initially came dumb binary mindset classify people. I‚Äôm glad realize pathetic wear two cloth masks pm2.5 filters Correct.  Same, go work every day, about, avoid getting careful around socially. ny far? Dying isn‚Äôt thing worry covid though. don‚Äôt know long term effects covid even asymptomatic cases. wife's doc told get it. I'll bet asked Sony Microsoft would glad offer 3000 units next production run (which I'm sure constantly running).

There however ethical concerns pay concerns stop this. work supply issue. Well, short starting vigilant groups That's internet fun back smart people really wanted access 'content' creators.   real though. crushing weight hyper focus bad much bear. things well interact physically people unless we're distant outside. sucks way is. worst part seeing people socials decided they're done shown things without masks, distance, sharing drinks, otherwise pretending 400,000+ dead shortly üòî grammatically incorrect comment already many awards? seems saving lives one factor. States set schedule, ACIP (who advises CDC advises states) 4 principles. #2+3 might keep going age, since elder white front line four ethical principles assist ACIP formulating recommendations initial allocation COVID-19 vaccine: 1) maximizing benefits minimizing harms; 2) promoting justice; 3) mitigating health inequities; 4) promoting talking biden dude. know conservative made valid point changed mind. right force people stay home compensate them. hurts business, jobs, families hes got point. 

So now

I ok lock includes massive stimulus spending cant happen state level dont money. must come federal I'm 3 steps removed COVID death I'm aware of. hope everything get closer that.

I've also 2 extended family members die non-COVID stuff, somewhat expected... urge add list. surprise me. planning trip summer people. held zoom meeting money due buy plan tickets reserve spots. one concerned whether go. pointed positivity rates (15% here), lack mask wearing issues. one else spoke acted like issue. realize us burned dealing covid, reason something reckless like flying across country pandemic. Every one told this. definitely sunk in. yeah. i'm sure amplified bc people always talk ill-like uncle talk times year found spent 4 weeks hospital+ICU summer (and he's old unhealthy, he's like 40, something would guessed). didnt tell anyone besides wife Except everything that‚Äôs released says vaccination green light immediately resume normal life. They‚Äôre still supposed maintain mask social distancing protocols people get vaccine community spread drops. Getting vaccine immediately hop plane international travel irresponsible.

And simply old mean people ‚Äúgiven country.‚Äù People 65 age range close death need squeeze every last minute left. Everyone giving time fun things this. time elderly valuable anyone else‚Äôs hit certain age.

With limited vaccines, need give people save suffering. old people go fun reward old. article says  agree subjected propaganda constantly ask benefits this? quickly leads critical thinking rabbit hole vaccinates bullshit. understand that, make less furious tbh. I'm losing ability live life want pay give lung cancer. like times cover people taking 10 smoke breaks day back retail days.... fucccckkkkkk smokers SMH. I‚Äôm currently going grocery drugstores, guess I‚Äôll wait. experience. Schools sources community spread. Agreed, it‚Äôs def good thing feel like I‚Äôll never understand actions. would feel bad guy? mental health issues? guess...

But someone culpability. supervisors allowing stay job clearly unstable.  UK ""shutdown"" involve masses unmasked people Christmas shopping? March 13th makes sense. area CVS pressing pharmacists give vaccine while. former CVS pharmacist gotten communication others know received emails asking want come back give them. They're even offering sign bonuses. making existing pharmacists asked help clinics well working normal store hours upset they're expected it. 

I'm curious see much extra staff put stores COVID vaccine rollout. lived many flu shot reasons never got much extra hours overlap. went expected churn 500+ scripts day expected churn 500+ scripts *and* give 20+ flu shots. company reputation criminally understaffed hope really beef staffing something important. discount this. Suspended? taken away, permanently? train military administrator vaccine deploy agree this. brains barely evolved grasslands Serengeti. We're able handle power. Source? peak right now. Talk us next week.

The fact people it. people refuse like big fucking babies, usual fucking things everyone else. big fucking babies still charge federal response nothing tantrum shitting themselves.

Oh, big fucking babies also threw side sedition insurrection last week that's also kinda important don't, know, become fascist dictatorship.

It'll months get vaccinated wife got second dose yesterday. posted journalist got wrong. He's charged three felonies far, likely face jail time. pleading begging RKI useless long measures enforced law. Universities allowed cram 50 people different households regions lecture hall write 2-hour exam? least half travel public transportation. now, 24 hours later, ""urgent appeal"" RKI travel? Well, helps.

I also ""urgent"" suggestion: penalizing CoronaSchVO violations 20.000 ‚Ç¨ fine giving money whose existence threatened pandemic? would probably effective faster current solution, considering large number people still know wear mask properly.

Sorry venting. Reddit echo chamber pro-health measure support. average person radically different average person First off, article doesn‚Äôt mention anything rolling lockdowns.

Second, it‚Äôs practically guarantee virus still us years come. long enough immunity population, new outbreaks die rather quickly. Anyone else getting brother hood NOD vibes? literally work microbiology lab. 

RNA permanently alter cells. promise you. article says criminally charged. arrested?

I'm assuming got wrong he's charged least misdemeanor work charges.

---- pharmacist, man police name, arrested recommended charges first degree recklessly endangering safety, adulterating prescription drug criminal damage property, felonies. held Ozaukee County jail.

I'll tell grandparents kill save us time! live, sides want re-open everything restrictions grown unpopular.

Maybe try closing 2 weeks, originally planned mild you. mild millions Americans, close half million already died. thought anti-bodies lasted months people recovered? Correct. 

We unfortunately assuming vaccinated populations behave (epidemiologically) least mostly like ""natural"" immunity. data there, good news. 'getting ahead line', per se, state phases understanding certain conditions certain phases. 

In Florida, share experience obese getting vaccine days ago. places offering vaccine healthcare workers 65+. There's phases there's line governors executive order ""Persons deemed extremely vulnerable COVID-19 hospital providers"". 

I able find 2 places offer vaccine groups area. One place let book appointment online portal even though site said eligible account records hospital rightly say i'm 65. Must glitch site updated say must doctor's note 65.

For place got vaccine, website said open 65+, healthcare workers, ""individuals conditions put high-risk developing severe illness COVID-19 defined CDC."" Which, obesity list, able make appointment, am. 10,000 slots March felt like getting super bowl tickets tbh. like 4 better 2 tbh. rank would like 1 way rest, 3 4 tied second place, 2 third, 5 even get rank. *has definitely released there's actually amount evidence they're lower risk general population. end, really know smoking affects people's risk think jump line *maybe* slight risk factor React maybe not, capacity empathy decent people require gut punch reaction understand people feeling grandmother dies. saw wrong. last year Geno Malkin's current contract. Pens' window narrowing. hear you.

One positive thing I've focusing reading vaccine (like, literally reading scientific papers, I'm scientist). COVID behaves like coronaviruses (which guarantee likely), vaccine prevent illness also reduce symptoms get unlucky catch it.

So think choice make. I'm vaccinated, decide reduced risk enough move life?

I think answer yes. responses sensationalist headlines lockdowns another decade scaring me. understand wanting get hopes up, evidence right shows things probably improve drastically within next six months. There‚Äôs need end there‚Äôs light end tunnel. dozens variants already. nature viruses. nothing scare tactics. Gotchya. gonna say, state we're definitely danger dosages expiring giving enough. See, scares me. get sick mess lungs even though worked hard quit smoking going pissed. miss smoking still, don‚Äôt mean like crave cigarette addiction, mean enjoy smoking want willing kill horribly it. dealing that‚Äôs really do. many factors outside control endlessly thinking causes undue stress.

If start worrying people know aren‚Äôt wearing masks, aren‚Äôt social distancing, much. thought Texas It‚Äôs really bad I‚Äôm point government isn‚Äôt anything it. I‚Äôm going life safe could possibly be, respecting others CDC recommends. feel like it‚Äôs completely control. scariest part lots schools Nebraska going back full capacity two weeks. Same. I‚Äôm fine above, haven‚Äôt seen folks north 13 months now, cannot WAIT see them. pretty quick vaccine. That‚Äôs enough coronavirus one year point almost every discussion study subject seems miss- virus cares actual amount social distancing rather whatever regulations place given place time.

And outside cell phone mobility data (which limited value) really good way measure people actually doing. Math  tv shows video games

Man, I'm jealous still entertain way. got old around July.

In fact, think I've 'entertained' anything 6 months. Nothing free folks Waiting J&amp;J California Blair Walsh, we‚Äôre lucky Basically yes.

I understand Cuomo reaction - offensive groups handing vaccine people within group regardless meeting qualifications - surprising backfired like did.

When tell people going punish give vaccine someone qualify state guidelines, course doses going get wasted.

Key points one rigorous analyses immunity reinfection:

* Study included 20,787 healthcare workers infected UK's first wave, 6,614 tested positive antibodies start study.
* Ran 18th June - 24th November.
* participants PCR antibody tested every 2-4 weeks.
* study period, **44** previously infected healthcare workers tested positive again: compares 318 previously non-infected participants.
* Protection reinfection estimated **83%** 5 months based data.
* 2 reinfections identified ""probable"", whilst rest ""possible"": therefore assumed true number reinfections may slightly lower (work ongoing confirm this).
* Crucially, **most reinfections mild.**
* Participants continue followed year assess changes immunity. Work also done see impact variants VOC202012/01 results, also find long vaccine-induced immunity lasts. paid way anyone per shot Fuck. Preach. Kids don‚Äôt transmit virus readily adults either. There‚Äôs study well skeptical Turkey Russia Covid data, turned full shit. yeah, country authoritarian famous government propaganda official truth gonna get benefit doubt. Well, 100M people already infected, we're going vaccinating kids, 100M vaccinated adults basically get rid COVID. Yea, see that. Considering failed coup happen, surprise anyone. Thursday, USFK said remaining two new cases included U.S. military contractor's spouse ""Department Defense civilian direct relationship six individuals."" Local television network KBS said Thursday Korea reported 500 cases daily average fourth-straight day, authorities remain guard. BTJ Center Nations Sangju, North Gyeongsang Province, source 700 cases reported recent days, according Singapore's Strait Times Thursday. affect kids, infect adults come contact public transport home. crazy think 1,000th death huge news. even point single cruise ship enough inflate national infection numbers. There‚Äôs also evidence yet you‚Äôre immune doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt still pass along

While that's true scientific-demonstrated experimental sense, educated guess would lean towards probably reducing infectiousness. think non-scientifically educated people necessarily explicitly told this, might increase riskier behavior. know I'll still treating potentially infectious even vaccine.

However suspect huge component transmission viral load, vaccine absolutely decrease viral load infected individual. Exactly. Game theory. Challenge yourself. like we're playing frogger everyday, trying avoid getting hit virus driving one trucks! might read find interesting.
It's one right? also radiolab podcast episode July 17 called ""Dispatches 1918"" listened yesterday.
It's great haunting.

Bacteria much bigger virus. bacteria seen microscope virus need electron microscope (which 1931).

So logical made mistake time.

That said many vaccines viruses developed first image virus seen. 
So still right might able get vaccine much faster spent resources...

I also read article earlier year also talks mask wearing make huge difference. 

When writing comment, forgot flu mutated less deadly form mask wearing would necessary 25 years like wrote. ... sub routinely really scary views what‚Äôs ok name stopping covid.

What fuck? mean, else done? There's need advocacy point, everyone knows fuck doing. people refuse believe unreachable. 

At point anything checking schedule updates vaccine rollout self harm way. don‚Äôt disagree you, think goes back trust issue. came months ago without evidence support would eroded trust people everywhere. American College Obstetricians Gynecologists recommends virus withheld pregnant women. he‚Äôs underwater, get wet? (We‚Äôll probably find next 100 years so) take daily sauna, temperatures 80 - 90 degrees Celsius. issue 3-4 minutes enclosed space without airflow would still adequate time get infected. Honestly, barely even bothered look variants virus started found UK countries actually looking.

Since far highest amount cases daily new cases world, chances good already several variants working way territory. able spot since labs started actively looking earnest since UK SA variants found, likely going discovered genetic testing performed. That's feel. problem widespread now, difficult avoid. Wearing mask, social distancing, basic hygiene enough we're facing constant exposures.

Individual low risk activities cumulatively became high risk exposed enough times. really plodding everybody. I‚Äôm skeptical bodies pile people would change behavior 

The assumption people agency follow government Yeah, wear mask True think people overwhelmed compassion fatigue.

Yep, herd immunity won‚Äôt occur, international travel prevalent, world‚Äôs population vaccinated. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs going take years that. best bet resuming flares lower increasing are.

Bezos could pay million dollars per hour 223 days he‚Äôd barely put dent fortune. scale wealth hard imagine. Yep here. start, first panic attack life thinking supply lines would shut down. Thankfully happen. Live went on, wore gloves grocery store trashed outside, used hand sanitizer multiple times process unloading. used sanitizer, gloves. went hunting wear mask 3 people trip, 1 week later covid. thought risky see 3 people (we sat around inside small camper trailer).

Covid like nothing me, guess got lucky. zero fear getting sick, course still wear masks wash hands, traveling social events, feel like like 4 6 months immunity feels great. ok take vaccine summer. Work never shut down, working home partially nice. pretty good year initial scare, since go parties anyway, rarely bars. Deep South shithole here.

County two spots decided renew mask mandate. There's slight protest considering county within Top 5 hardest hit whole fucking state. 3% who? Unfortunately, lots epidemiological studies evidence immunity infection take many years end pandemic (much much slower vaccination). Yes. might actually sick know. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù. situation could feel fine still spread virus exhaled droplets. Much needed going happen. little late. Even vaccine works new variants gives long term immunity screwed. don‚Äôt think death tally even half months. We‚Äôve got beds rationing oxygen. need lockdown. Right back you. stress teachers put insane. true. Trump people determined 100% vaccine would ""fall truck."" great news, another weapon fight virus. Symptom fast changing culture Haha calculating since minutes whether total million feasible :-)

I also think not.

Unless ""a million"" common language means ""many many"". read 50% frontline workers particular county refused vaccine, can‚Äôt find anything indicates rate national global level. Regardless it‚Äôs sad see.

I also don‚Äôt know number take account folks aren‚Äôt supposed take vaccine tested positive covid last 90days. last 90days 15million new cases US, compiled state data show ~10% cases US healthcare workers, would disqualify 1.5million healthcare workers right gate, don‚Äôt know counted percentage ‚Äúrefused‚Äù data excluded Took entirely long find comment. amount trash accumulated pandemic disposable masks particular enormous. Good luck Mother Earth. Something saved 3 million+ deaths europe alone. 446 million people 1-2% mortality rate among ~75% need get herd immunity kicks thats 3 million. Plus minus depending whether hospitals overloaded. Plus whole lot hospital system fails...which might without lockdowns.

Your red blood cells carry oxygen cells. Normally red blood cells coming lungs oxygen (say, 95%). means cells, including brain cells, get oxygen function.

If lungs damaged, breathe smoke, go really high, otherwise good supply oxygen red blood cells level falls cells start going without oxygen, means can't make energy. Without energy cells shut eventually die (or sometimes hybernate).

Even 3, wear ‚Äúsuper hero masks‚Äù can‚Äôt dance don‚Äôt. 

We spent. It‚Äôs exhausting. Especially active adventurous toddler yard. stop park trips literally ones masks. pulled school positive there. 

It‚Äôs exhausting. Thank GOD Vinatieri charge lot society seems like hostage situation. Pay taxes police instance. Sometimes necessary. struggle get people wear anything all.

And yet that's number they're advertising without qualification. say ""at least 83%""? previously infected think improve immunity 95% get vaccine? 

Sounds right. Yeah, practice stay home unless get groceries (I'm lucky go outside house work though). weekly check vaccine availability, even available still four year old medical issues I'm long run oh tired people never cared still don't. Deleted Facebook towards start it, talk many people anymore, live life confines property vaccinated (in home) try bit normalcy. people science business backgrounds get jobs dumbasses become politicians.

Weird given even virus isn‚Äôt studied BSL-4 labs.

Well, stores district *finally* starting get back regular staffing numbers everyone quit start this. They're even pushing rx techs get certified give immunizations, front store staff fill rx ringing prescriptions - may notice sounds lot like ""pressuring existing staff less"" ""adding staff allow enhanced cleaning immunizations.""

Oh, remember major chains gave holiday bonuses closed christmas thank employees? one extra day CVS, ""holiday"" bonuses pay another two weeks.

So basically, keep eye news company's botched vaccine rollout, every time see headline ""dedicated, hard-working staff,"" replace phrase ""overworked corporate wage-slaves."" People would gather day anyways. people gonna get stuff done daytime there‚Äôs already hella people anyways.  I‚Äôd say isn‚Äôt accurate. 

We actual studies disagree. Wont hurt though. Seek help test enough. way death rate high. Japan simply can't bothered test 0.1 percent total population every day. mean time resource advantages? US one first countries outside China case. time disadvantage. also recently reduced funding pandemic response groups hit short PPE.

So would say US time disadvantage, resource disadvantage ‚ÄúWhat you?‚Äù

wasn't **2000's** finally figured HIV came from.. 

had go back 1920s.

yeah. AIDS ""new"". all.

it jumped monkeys humans 60 years even got name.

they jab lot fucking monkeys figure Pre-1980

It widely believed [HIV originated Kinshasa, Democratic Republic Congo around 1920 HIV crossed species chimpanzees 1980s, know many people infected HIV developed AIDS. HIV unknown transmission accompanied noticeable signs symptoms.

While sporadic cases AIDS documented prior 1970, available data suggests current epidemic started mid- late 1970s. 1980, HIV may already spread five continents (North America, South America, Europe, Africa Australia). period, 100,000 300,000 people could already watched live arson suspect get arrested live stream, LA.  literally 15-20 cops bunched , close other, one mask ( live news helicopter ) I've heard said ""masks icing physical distancing"" sure could written post life nuanced ... xD they're lockdown obviously people new variant sudden. goes gradually. Look argue want, math remains quite simple. 2 city's 100.000 people infected, one city R 1.1 one R 1.5. One month later second city 6x cases deaths first. 

This means one month ago coronaviruses us magically changed british variant else stayed same. could around 27.000 daily deaths instead 'mere' 4.500 have. 

Obviously, nothing drastic gonna happen, gonna much gradual curving growth untill enough population vaccinated would make huge difference. variant, honest scientific opinion, highly problematic fear mongering all. could really easily effectively digital certificate. Bet come wacky alternative work. vaccine cure. Rabies vaccine cure rabies, flu vaccine cure flu. boosts immune system fighting chance virus. they've ever been. We

I think speak everyone. yet risk modified multiple things. Seatbelts, speed limits, directions drive (i.e. signs), limitations put body drive, proof drive first place, limit many people car, inspection make sure car safe road.

And things punishable law violated. Every one instance government stepping mediate risk public health cars pose. This! Although hope peak.

Nothing read going make stay home more, I'm already much can. I've racked brain trying find something justify cutting can't. thing leave direct physical need monthly trip pick kid's school papers. Even grocery visits I've got stretched monthly. I've done share. people need pick slack. way get die covid, deniers never seem die it. ones took precautions got sick anyway. big news. Many countries thing regarding foreign travelers, isn‚Äôt huge news aspect. 

But we‚Äôre 6 months Olympics everything trending wrong direction happen summer. would deny access someone antibodies? People vaccinated immune COVID test positive antibodies. would denied entry?

It seems either Chinese government understand purpose antibodies, attempt intimidate team disrupt investigation. Meltdown detected. ignore guy. people love moan every positive thing India Indian govt does. Oh, one them. Carry on. fuck shit, really maddening way people took pandemic; pearls swine Bullshit Also point. wear mask work around strangers see friends family.

I still see friends family indoors though. cases high right area. Masks pretty saturated now, really huge problem, even politicised. maybe much lack demand? Imagine you. done that. feel sorry yourself? realized actually happened? Ok let's China did. 

Weld people homes forcefully take medical centers. 

Solid plan.

Also 100% made people quarantine beginning returning back states. countries much better US, especially considering time resource advantages had.  issues getting vaccine state ID TX. Unstoppable force? Meet immovable object. Bad news, object: you‚Äôre gonna give. Nothing said indestructible object. immovable. Like gives lot credibility argument many conservatives - would ‚Äúgo away‚Äù (from media , politicians caring) election. 

I saw tweet earlier said newpaper headlines cover virus less January last year - even thing outside China. 

Schools reopening highest contagious rates, cuomo saying need open literally using talking points conservatives bashed.. aren‚Äôt helping either. meaning? enough say covid dangerous? need wait 6 months find  Holy shit. 6PM? Civil unrest already rising Europe man might last straw.

You cant lock people inside homes ending sight. There's evidence mutations make virus less deadly. really hard constantly pay attention something year. I'm burned coronavirus even funny. can, mostly stay home, wear mask, wash hands hope best Could elaborate coronavirus? 

We know already Bsl-4 Wuhan. works stops gatherings. virology. Whoever calls virology dogma basic understanding dogma. I‚Äôm participating next week believe mine 2 shot trial since said another shot 2 months now. far? visits?  Same. high hopes people this, every time saw someone without mask minor trauma. hope humanity, I‚Äôm right to. don‚Äôt deserve planet. point vaccine give everyone immunity infection. vaccines give better longer lasting immunity infections.  enough people level immunity (70%?) \_then\_ socialize freely.

Sorta like ideal case of: group people who'd (and knew develop good immune response). sister visiting (and interacting) people who'd recently it, would much better freely interacting everyone. Even became asymptomatic spreader again, people she'd around would less, not, susceptible.

IF vaccine impart immunity, then... would vaccine. Oh, hi honey, I'm space rocket launching event right now, ended here? ask mother agree people would care more. think even 10%, probably even 5% would caused societal collapse. honestly didn‚Äôt even know looked Spanish flu death rate around 2% imagine 5% way connected world.  point exactly, look problem local context. country/state right &amp; countries/states that's better parts solution.

Denying there's problem going fix it. agree more, time pass someone else dies deserve it. depends. office job work home, social life goes basically zero without able meet anyone 5 days straight. Even curfew 22 discourages many dinner gatherings  none paper, medical grade paper component think maybe part high pressure fluid protection stuff medical grade masks (intended withstand human blood pressure artery nicked surgery), providing structural elements. think delayed? keep hearing thought initially, pretty big group friends game US (a lot south). also family over. say thing. Everyone wearing masks indoors get fussing it. Maybe videos virtue signalers twitter post crazy people making scenes trigger people make think common is? I'm day 13 isolation testing positive. everything right: mask anywhere outside private property, washing hands, wiping surfaces, on. I've skipped social gatherings, avoided family holidays, even took time eat apart coworkers avoid contamination.

I got symptoms Jan 2 year, places could come grocery store cash flow. careful long, clue slipped up. Hi, late 20s teacher switched smoking vaping year (and started decrease that).

I preregistered vaccine placed group 1a. selected ‚Äúnicotine/smoking addition‚Äùduring questionnaire. health issues. 

I don‚Äôt know chosen way was.

Edited: dumb fingers accidentally hit post stopped browsing sub around 2 months Lol, well huge favor much lower risk severe side effects. I‚Äôve heard several high ranking people institution expect available general public mid March. 

Just keep safe. time coming soon ‚ù§Ô∏è Moderna stock 3.5% today. Someone smart connect dots depressing thought day. people probably told year live right pandemic hit. got :( see people missing point.... Like blindly believe report given context. Honestly confused someone help feel crazy reading thread! mom never given single shit covid. constantly remind wear mask. goes gym without one. Tells one where‚Äôs one there. fucking gym. Sweating spitting breathing hardest equipment. Covid isn‚Äôt going away folks. People ESPECIALLY religious people spent entire lives pretending denying truth death. Everytime ping existential dread hits brain rides self defense reassurance heaven life eternal ice cream puppies. 

People brain washing way social media Legit same. control control. 100% sure think nursing home allocation included staff well. think CVS said they'll finish 25th kinds evidence vaccines type stop transmitting reasonable logic says would stop transmission well. BUT, also reasonable say ""I know"" health official, long term studies yet. see they're saying it. would extremely unusual stop transmission. looks like get immunity week first dose. Glad see tone starting change bit. People complain news making depressed time voluntarily consuming 24/7. focus friends/family improving life. There's really point creating negativity something can't change. mean makes sense. don‚Äôt need run clinical trials every year flu vaccine updated. make best replies. that's interesting! I'll reconsider. agree even thread see much denial blas√© indifference. I've saying please let Americans travel here, think offer asylum people want escape violence, social unrest, out-of-control virus, indifference human life demonstrated private healthcare system. rest country option outsource pharmacies? Moderna **believes**?

No, want act believing something.  
Provide **solid scientific reasons** could that, it! Josh Scobee Steelers tenure... mainly leadership disadvantage, dress much like, everyone knows happened Obama, mess we're now. We've drive groceries exclusively since cases started going locally (NC) September. Sometimes get random produce nice stressing unmasked assholes. hope grocers start charging much curbside pickup get past pandemic, good thing come past year. Seeing friends family die changes minds. LOL, 'initial outbreak' China locked Wuhan? Yes. argument international flight Shanghai question Wuhan locked down? That's kind point fucking lock it, people still move Shanghai. question China lock region China allow international flight region. 

And whenever someone brings Hitler, lost argument. accept surrender grace.  I'm still 100% taking seriously US. real change family learned transmits less surfaces, took less precautions delivered food groceries. that, I'm changing anything vaccinations rolled numbers way down.

It's infuriating watch idiots sending kids back school, playing sports, going church...and watching numbers skyrocket behavior. vaccine manufacturing capacity also raw materials needed. Part second US-Pfizer deal aiding acquiring/making resources used manufacture vaccine. everyone make stuff either issuing order suddenly Ford stops making cars tomorrow make vaccine. There's increase possible immediate everyone ot. get many mixed messages, one hand told patronize businesses keep going income workers deserve front lines, I've landed thinking. Nobody ever says workers actually want though. said need jobs go businesses. Others like wish there. 

I know situation varies per person. thoughts someone awful position? people takeout stuff? bad customers mask problem? want right thing know is. yet, half effective benefit helps reduce covid transmission drastically! stupid debate

the correlation implementation mask mandates cases rise... wish people would see that. fear comes media starts reporting crazily cases/deaths/hospitalizations (with exaggerated metrics) remember back June, media completely silent COVID sudden July started covering fear restarted. media exaggerate reporting fear, can't that... they? need 30 day national lock pay everyone stay home. Women hard time mean men easy. That's Machine Era starts human trait, american. REALLY give shit think 150 people max. you! work travel/hospitality industry. fuck job still open? furloughed (I awhile, still go salaried employees cover shift). 

Not staying home, going travel, wear fucking mask! small thing do. awful news spread around possibility avg person. Supermarkets already dangerous enough without people hoping win lottery hanging around large quantities. mention it, drinking significantly less removed facebook phone. sure Sputnik V Hungary went bought Sinovac dissatisfied EU scheme. Hear hear. many people complaining respecting rules. Italy, 18k cases day, everyone thinks he's smart bends rules. bending rules taken us. much so. Overpopulation, plastic ocean, global warming, animal species going extinct, etc etc..

We really need proactive instead burrying heads sand pretending something need concerned with. "" Let future generations fix it"" legitimate response. That's bunch shit. America well known one charitable countries earth. There's nothing wrong caring personal success either. last sentence pure unadulterated projection. repeat again, don‚Äôt seem get it.

You may thing set 70¬∞C. may even give kind readout 70¬∞C. temperature heater/evaporator, temperature air room. temperature air room, would alive type this. That‚Äôs fact. It‚Äôs ‚Äúbut muh anecdote‚Äù. Headline concerning - reinvent wheel current vaccine effective new variants identified? - article goes say plan update based currently identified new variants, theoretically possible, needed to. basically saying smoking alters receptors Covid-19 uses attack lungs therefore leaving defunct.  Word. whittled reddit type subs generally like minded folks, technical stuff. Hunting, camping, welding like. yea FB almost ruined me. Silver lining know people need associate real life. Actually saved trip visiting redneck buds basically turned proud boys 2 years hanging em. Fuck em. Usually reddit open minded, I'm surprised see many hateful people coming woodwork [Yeah costume Maybe fly another country, spread sweet covid variant there, UK. imagine cost though. Hi! Good questions! right now, vaccinated still required maintain social distancing mask requirements, change soon. Here's why:

1. estimated vaccine become truly effective approximately 1 week second dose. That's another 4 days me!
2. Right now, stage 3 trials say effective vaccines are. Pfizer's trials showed 95% reduction hospitalization, specifically try determine whether people vaccinated still carriers even get mild cases. vaccines, oral polio vaccine, prevent disease necessarily prevent transmission. possible (though unlikely) virus still live nasal passages, example, spread there. Nasal swab testing pick that, though, preliminary numbers coming israel show 33-60% reduction covid19 positivity rates starting 14 days first dose. far number people received second dose small really know much them. 2 weeks, however, number people Israel alone received two shots (plus one week after) around 600,000, we'll start get amazing data.
3. Even vaccine prevents transmission, 100% effective. Let's say 95% effective - masks still reduce transmission, especially hit herd immunity.
4. enforcement purposes, hard look bunch people ask proof vaccination every person wearing mask. everyone still wear mask, enforcing mask use much easier authorities. social distancing.

But soon change. plan (Israel) people received doses plus one week get certificate allow access certain things, attending larger events, eating indoors restaurants, etc. suspect they're waiting see preliminary numbers reduction positivity rates. said above, numbers juuuust starting come now.

I say plan bit less cautious soon. till I've used n95/ffp2 masks entering clinic, pharmacy, supermarket crowded place, often less crowded places well. less crowded places outdoors I've worn simple surgical type mask. expect I'll reduce n95 use substantially starting next week use surgicals much more.

I getting COVID antibody test monday get results tuesday. I'm paying (about $90) peace mind due curiosity. 


If questions, ask away! think valid concerns. People trust science doctors there's still possibility something going wrong expect much become carefree (which people sub believe going taking vaccine). vaccine approved emergency use creates anxiety questioning someone take it. Saying someone inject new vaccine doctor's answer general questions vaccine ""maybe"", ""there's possibility"", ""a fair amount of"" kinda shitty. Minnesota reopened in-person dining start new peak, reports new mutation present state. know Walz can, dumbest move could made point. drinking been? able cut out? drinking two three beers every night due stress. would like reduce I‚Äôm trying one beer night. far good.

My heart goes anyone feels much stress Medicate drugs alcohol. Please get well hero battling it. Well tbh world's reached atauration point now. tune news corona now. Iv enough. Tell death rates gougn hit 10mill vaccinated I'll interested then. Many ""act"" past nine ten months. 

The Super Bowl coming up, people want host go parties regardless playing. think first case officially reported January 20 last year. Inauguration day 1 year anniversary. make stuff up. There‚Äôs data transmit; they‚Äôre basing claim nothing  Work, Home, TV Video games, repeat.

I can't much longer. call privilege working saving extra cash. OK people keep working buy new iPhones, overpriced cars, expensive dinners risking additional spread COVID? that's saying contradicting said. DOUBLE DOINK worth, mainly Americans say anything flu? No, didn‚Äôt. supply limited enough price high enough people would re-use them, counter-productive? 6 people office (I'm fortunate enough able continue opt work remote like sane person) caught December one person died. time masks would start getting sent out, deaths already dropping due vaccinations warmer weather. sit 70C LEAST twenty minutes. days, I‚Äôve done hour there, breaks between. tell get sunshine forget I'm living canada winter lol Surprised see Asians higher they're slimmest racial group. Cultural factors weight guess. fact speed limit exists demonstrates point. Blasting people 110 going 75 get dirty, looks yes. ""a limit."" mandated law. worse violate it, worse punished. scientist, frustrating. Everything made scary possible. misunderstanding novelty situation, lot media, subsequently politicians, chose listen project pessimistic voices. Sadly, think intentional, seen best way get compliance citizens. However, think approach really eroded trust non-scientists scientific community.

This happened expectations initial wave. happened outdoor spread. happened immunity. happened serology testing. Etc...

The latest cycle discussion vaccine preventing transmission. Many people truly believe there's large shot COVID circulate readily, get sick. makes sense immunologically disease. vaccines prevent transmission form another. I'll eat shoe don't. Even prevent infection, unlucky enough infected still transmit, that's still preventing transmission (you can't spread it). *will* prevent infections. Even high titer exposures still muscle vaccine create mild disease, low titer exposures eliminated. less likely carry disease, less likely transmit. vaccine would actually *aid* transmission remaining cases. That's extremely unlikely. vaccine significantly lower viral loads people spread far poorly.

Has proven yet? No, let's narrative 50:50 shot gets people clicking checking status. Let's honest people scientists instead trying scare compliance. got vaccine waited necessary time interval, simply less likely spreading COVID someone unvaccinated. Really everyone relative risk. IFR Covid odds dying within year given cause. follows overall mortality rates throughout age range. overlapping risks isn‚Äôt. don‚Äôt know much overlapping risk control. closest thing control Sweden lightest reaction. seems third risk overlaps normal risk dying year.

Modern life lots gadgets, doesn‚Äôt replace community, family, friendships, culture, etc contributes well-being. might actually making worse.

You right. don‚Äôt know long term effects Covid. 

We also don‚Äôt know long term effects social disruption scale either. 

We know side effects social isolation all-cause mortality rate: roughly doubles Legit question: volunteering at? Virus mutate yes. deadly less deadly contagious less contagious, roll dice. ""Ignorant!"" Shouts man convinced we'd like south Korea right different politician office news tries make look progressively worse.

Well that's lucky getting progressively worse. Well... husband, mom, caught covid early (early March). None us died, next time mom annual check-up found heart arrhythmia could caused heart attack caught it. months later, noticed change there.

My husband also developed asthma needs use inhaler times per week. doctor says highly likely lingering effect covid.

So far look like I've developed complications myself, there's definitely possible problems death. BSL-4 labs required studying Coronaviruses... even coronavirus even today. 

WIV absolutely leader studying coronaviruses Dr. Shi (bat woman!). WIV facility different labs including BSL-4s. point is:

-The presence BSL-4 lab would needed study Coronaviruses.

Separately, anyone really thinks lab leak, would advise remember Wuhan TWO different labs... WIV well known internationally Chinese CDC lab (older smaller) happens located across street wet market. 

Once virus known, Dr Shi giving interviews lots different places. don‚Äôt recall anyone lab saying squat. 

I would analyze test animal supply chain lab first going WIV source. üòéüëç degree absolutely. there's reason second shots called ""boosters"". estimates protection anywhere 65 80% first doses. got vaccine Tuesday tested positive covid today. lost sense smell late last. know impact timetable second dose? I'm understanding sounds like he's taken turn deep end recent years Hopefully states switching straight age requirement, see things start pick up.

I think choosey getting slowing massively. continue left district. schools started next semester likely keep par course whatever course chose. Next week expected see protests every US state capitol. going better next week, hopefully soon? Hit nail head. Feels like everything fucked stay home follow guidelines people places pandemic. shit fucked. side, guys half way herd immunity. Well, vaccine effective (90-95%?), lots people yet, infection rates still problem everyone declares open season immediately. believe experts say still need precautions, know mine finally, FINALLY going relax bit. bought $250 worth kn95 kf94 masks use family, teachers. kf94 better kn95 overall, kn95 Headband style masks liked.

The required second doses [were held back federal states. five states even used 50% allocation. He's already changing world way gives even money.  get level wealth good person thinking others. herd immunity strategy says herd immunity parenthesis quote.

It matter hiw many time find quotes saying herd immunity. restrictions clearly show strategy. happening too.

So borderline stupid really think 2 weeks. know why, emphasize people frustrated lmao.

I‚Äôm still staying home. understand people, almost year lockdown initially supposed 3 months, frustrated.

it‚Äôs called empathy sweetie :)  same. proven way? hear sometimes unlucky unprotected vaccine protected non-vaccinated people. I'd feel much relieved hard proof this, exposed Sars-CoV2, non-ill even turn positive PCR test. know know many vaccines. suspect X-rays would help know (my layman's opinion) many researchers clinicians decided investigate making excuses? Europeans better. Bulgaria, summer 2020 mostly normal here. Really looking forward summer year. laugh needed otherwise shit afternoon :) local hospital (250ish beds) announced 100% full. telling ambulance crews triage patients. sign-off required doctor.

You release something early bugs patch bugs later date? wear mask. limit travel. I'm everything can, hard even care numbers anymore. Day day people die find less less interested. numbers even seem crazy anymore. I've become numb. Nope. understanding, admittedly guess part, dropped herd immunity thing first immunity measurement. last time Folkh√§lsomyndigheten brought anything herd immunity hinted it.

Here's video clips support wanted spread sake achieving immunity (it's 44 seconds short afford watch it): death total getting much higher. fully expecting take million people US.

Yeah idk exact numbers 18s US frankly we‚Äôll lucky 75% adults ever take study encouraging, unclear whether protection applies older people. study participants aged 35 54 would expected robust immune systems.

That's really important caveat needs fleshed study. duration immunity post-infection similar older populations, even 65 70, necessarily elderly, would much encouraging health care infrastructure's ability weather next months. I. Lmao subreddit rabbit hole makes feel burnout :( really think need open everything vaccine. Rewards front line workers sacrificed much incentivizing people get vaccinated they‚Äôre eligible. Win win. sucks dude. get nervous even 99% people around wearing masks (there face shields thrown mix).

I'm semi-rural part Oregon, too, makes amazing people pretty compliant fussing. Naw, agree guy. people world lack empathy nowadays self-centered spin idea they're actually something charitable shopping. No, people lazy brew need prestige getting Starbucks morning. People right end political spectrum heavily favor anecdotal british strain 1% positive covid tests, said french minister health today press conference. Try working grocery store, see one every days Northern Wisconsin checking in. people still Covid thing? Oregon enjoying drugs home America tuning suffering people since long covid. one-shot phase 3 trial. told it‚Äôs approved EUA, tell got offer real thing placebo group. I'm Belgium where, now, we've managed somewhat reduce power virus community spread stricter measures.

However, appears British South African variant start circulating (some cases detected given country, I'm sure even possible keep outside longterm).

Currently, shops places (museums, take-away, ...) open strict measures mandatory masks, shorter visits, shopping lot people on.

My companion I, course, try reduce shopping sometimes (mostly groceries sometimes also non-essentials take-away). case, try distance, wear standard cloth surgical masks, limit time inside places except home. concerned fomite spread, found evidence far that.
So far, strategy kept loved ones safe.

Given transmissible virus strain Belgium, anything change current behaviors? Invest better masks (FFP2 N99)? Pay attention fomite spread? go essentials?

Current epidemiological situation Belgium found here: appreciate advice. strain worried risky. I'm sure countrymen appreciate exotic gifts they'll bring home abroad... ? going prioritize high risk group vaccine, seems ethically consistent also prioritize high risk group comes ICU admission beds full.

I'm sure find lot people willing take leap.  part I'm awful. People seem convinced covering chin suffice. gave pharmacist dirty look get put mask going register, gave groceries saw packed Whole Foods Stop Shop were. community particular something like 10 15 per hundred tests positive.  Yeah, live US years ago friend got plague, clue still existed happens think view people darker skin vitamin deficiencies worse cases covid, prioritizing populations also reduce hospitalizations. think fatigue tune out. Everything CA closed expect essential places total peak mode terms virus, omnipresent can't speak states. friends aunt got going doctors. rewarding bad decisions, recognizing group addicts specifically risk otherwise healthy people, they're likely die Rona it. 

Maybe single shred compassion body able understand. 

Like said - Type 2 diabetics, people high blood pressure, people skin cancer going tanning, alcoholics, obese people - need put back line personally agree life choices? think vilifying saying life worth saving help long run? Alright, presented 46.1% them. Grats. live Ontario still know one nurse friend friend got it. mostly invisible enemy me.

April till June spent entire day driving six different towns three counties drop supplies pick finished masks, we'd distribute masks local essential businesses. 60 volunteers peak. masks became political mostly collapsed sent tailspin. still handful volunteers, we're working specifically local hospital system now. problem flights aha. global pandemic killing thousands people day. Part community sometimes things (i.e. labor) others, even we're paid it.

I understand wanting get seems like everyone else themselves, can't imagine saying ""yeah could help save lives, said they're going give money, I'd rather binge latest show Netflix."" America falling. I'm similar place. Sometime around Thanksgiving realized critical mass people give fuck we're going live 500k+ deaths trapped home vaccines finish rolling like... 9-15 months. year late... state issue isn‚Äôt aren‚Äôt distributing vaccines have, it‚Äôs aren‚Äôt getting enough fed. Question.

Here US, say ""everyone get tested, regardless symptoms circumstances, pay dime"".

Is Canada, UK, Europe, etc?

Or running symptoms-based approach denying testing asymptomatic people (without known exposure)?

Do test positivity reports countries? makes feel like 9 months stress totally unnecessary.

Devil's advocate: idea COVID would affect you. mother could died may ended long-lasting effects.  Ah shit, go again. fails protect 400,000 government knowingly kills 1 million+. 

Good thing USA both‚Äîalthough millions kills count they're black brown people halfway across world. That's fair must towards OC IE You‚Äôre dead wrong that. like tighter/denser living conditions lack access early care well overall health (before infection). Watching movies without eating drinking pretty shit, better nothing 3 countries top 5 populous....

That may something else it. Doses limited amount approved vaccines even cover countries part Let‚Äôs send kids back school! Seriously- WTF? that‚Äôs wrote ‚Äúmild‚Äù ... travel reside UK It‚Äôs mask. wear day. Gets bit sweaty, may well there, trouble gives. Suspended?? Doug, kick tour! Lower risk seniors already vaccinated many places. According article, COVID patients occupy 40% hospital beds Arizona, hey, Coyotes going let fans watch person (at 20% capacity) season! Please send help. One coworkers twice still goes restaurants gatherings shit. It‚Äôs infuriating. 

I‚Äôm glad position allows hole office pretty much day. government tuning people since began too. honest, part hopes wearing mask public becomes normal thing like many countries. possible caught COVID late January first schools closed, partner emergency room wreck immediately after. consistent trouble breathing; he's athletic work out, saw black tunnel going flight stairs (I run 6 minute mile reference). 

The possibility caught early worries future outbreaks. go back forth relieved vaccine coming, realizing probably summer get one. recently stopped going grocery store get drive groceries. basically thing outside house. Vaccines *reduce* probability symptomatic infection.

Vaccines *reduce* probability severe disease.

Vaccines *reduce* probability transmission (hopefully).

There magic bullet. even meet guy knowing little fucks gives pandemic? wouldn‚Äôt even agreed space him.  Like said, heating units might producing air 65-80¬∞C, sitting air that‚Äôs pushing 200 degrees F. would hot enough air burn skin minutes, let alone 20. temperatures you‚Äôre talking aren‚Äôt far sitting hot tub that‚Äôs literally filled boiling water.

If want walk park buddy, see harm that. 2-3? pre existing condition something get early?

I‚Äôm planning able get like July. World Data states US #14. addition this, countries transparent reporting.

Are deliberately pushing misinformation here? many factors go state‚Äôs coronavirus case numbers simple correlation useless rule gyms playing role causation, especially know spreads via water droplets created exhale. sadly can‚Äôt won‚Äôt 

I live upper middle class part CA hardly know anyone even Covid. Nearly everyone wearing masks times months live numbers keep getting much worse. Maybe approach we're taking problem? US vaccine/reopening predictions:

__NOW (Mid Jan)-Mid March:__ Vaccinate healthcare workers multiple risk categories. Also vaccinate teachers, educators, caregivers early March. *Social gatherings non essential businesses still closed.*

__Mid March-Late May:__ Vaccinate essential workers (fast food, grocery store, bank, transit/delivery drivers, gas station, cashiers, etc.) well lower-risk seniors. *Small outdoor masked public events venues like zoos, botanical gardens, small theme parks fairs, gatherings resume reduced capacity.*

__Early June-Early August:__ Mass rollout general lower-risk adult population (WFH/non-essential/unemployed). *Indoor businesses like arcades movie theaters open masks food consumption. Outdoor dining relatively safe.* People take seriously (eg wear masks work, go private indoor gatherings etc) like drunk drivers--they increasing risk others behavior themselves. Thanks! sounds much accurate hope 83% floor taken note (Italy) &amp; June US ...   

Source? Look seriously China treating it. 

In America don‚Äôt even require quarantine 

Everyone  lot nations listed except Uk lot catching order pass US deaths per capita. Sure situation great either doesn‚Äôt make ok Americans: there's vaccine now, right? Floridian here, untrue. county run sites allowing appointments 65+, hospitals even get appointment. places offering healthcare workers, i've heard need valid work ID valid paystub. 

What hearing sounds like broken telephone stemming Canadian citizens residency half year able get vaccine, they're still 65+. here. multiple strains spreading.  Immunity one guarantee immunity all. Hell, recover thanks inflammation vs. Immune response, catch strain twice. need remember even vaccine need continue mask thing social distancing numbers start coming down. don‚Äôt know still carriers vaccination. measures total nonsense. meet one person private travel public transport job surrounded strangers many companies working home.

not speak border traffic czechia, poland, austria on. many people driving everyday one country go working even shopping.

they shooting shotgun instead using laser precise measures, government clue point. bill gates chip ? ! disappoint !

./s  started vaccines December, 100k people vaccinated one received second dose... reason think variant would make vaccines ineffective. Yeah I‚Äôve stopped watching Covid news bc it‚Äôs pointless depressing point. 

I‚Äôve already assumed won‚Äôt get vaccine (even though asthma, I‚Äôm MD), live don‚Äôt come contact ANYONE, fam lives different state. 

It bums out. watch sometimes need jolt ‚Äúwhy still again...‚Äù yeah there‚Äôs much one person do. tHINGS ALREADY BIT STRESSFUL. Lol

I feel people states thing enforced. Damn that‚Äôs crazy, three people Wyoming got coronavirus Americans? Humans. mean citizens give fuck point go without masks? yeah, that's news. I'm looking at: states obese severely obese eligible. Overweight folks wait little longer. Also, 9/11 gave people enemy focus rage on. Revenge justice powerful motivators psychologically attractive people. ""Doing right thing"" 9/11 meant kicking ass taking names people. right thing pandemic means acknowledging powerless hide wait. surprise lot people made enemy (China, liberuls freedom stealing masks, etc) raged instead. confirm completely false. 85% chance mild symptoms, think lot people care anymore. 20-something friend many friends got it, said flu worse. preexisting conditions still care, losing smell-taste symptom, I'm pretty sure would anti-masker point, sick it. could guaranteed get severe symptoms, would infecting right well even lost sense taste smell while. Yeah, violent, armed insurrection mob chanting hang pence pelosi (among others), erected gallows, one turn feet away getting access members congress big deal. downplaying defend it? means complete list I'm pretty sure got vaccines ordered developed.

We comprehensive data subject far cannot release it. confirmed published cases, set trend cases reinfection reported clinical outcomes. I'm sure National Guard something say that. None idiots make far. Except San Diego County...the non-doctor science challenged Board supervisors said NO...not health workers vaccinated even though 30% said NO....the President Board says issue logistics rolling juice people hold valid license work giving vaccinations.

Speaking GI involvement digress little.. theory many cases 'purely' GI Covid going unnoticed - particularly kids. intestines rich ACE2 receptors infection probably mild non-specific symptoms asymptomatic cases necessarily picked pharyngeal PCR. think intestinal Covid dead-end transmission cases (outside slums).

Initially booted slowly expectation became apart supposed office daily. employer sounds like smart person realization little effect. sure live Northern California much speculation day recall petition went 1 million signatures. dat... what? already know vaccines 100% effective. assumption I'm making people get less effective vaccine would get effective one months/years later they're widely available, booster. updated someone please let know, last read SARS-CoV-2 genetic material isolated samples. That, own, prove there's virus circulating area. Much less new one, even less one infects humans. significance sequences came light retrospect. [Archive average pandemics last 2 years anyway.

I know recent *flu* pandemics around 2 year averages, pandemics general ravaged globe time spans ranging 15 years hundreds. Arizona, went husband (works hospital) got shot huge drive-through vaccination site. soon pulled tent reached window give shot, wrote time windshield dry-erase marker. told us pull ahead another lot, ""honk horn feel reaction"". dozens cars waiting, one nurse walking around peering people's windows respond. national guard soldier walked around too, soon saw 15 minutes past time windshield, handed vaccination card window waved us away. super efficient.  probably going die anyways regardless covid

For singular event, little shaky far damage moral hazard going go. think vaccine schedule reflects broader policy, broader policy lead deaths long term. posting articles cut people pay-wall. Remember people used say alien invasion thing could unite world common enemy?

What happens get 60% population vaccinated, hesitancy takes that's ceiling? plausible outcome, teetering edge herd immunity (again, unknown) continue outbreaks country unvaccinated pockets.

I guess I'm saying that, always way people convince ""enough people vaccinated"" ""that's dangerous still"". I'm sure supposed understand really ***means*** anymore.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  220k confirmed cases may 500-800k total cases though head office move pandemic, nobody allowed near place without director level approval. colleague go today get something done desks, storage units seats still plastic coverings on.

I feel great deal people still make commute work sit office. hard time wrapping brain around difficult people wear mask practice social distancing. refuse wear face ""diaper"" also access ventilators get sick since hoax anyway. french tell 6PM curfew harder measure last lockdown had.
At least 2nd lockdown could go shopping walking. curfew can't anything working. Suspended neck Seems like good r/Masks4All thread. thing think he'd would mask mandate trying push stimulus/grant money/unemployment quickly speed vaccines True, finding news unreliable sources (facebook/twitter). sure news really sway people acting safe, maybe also see quite people giving up. unfortunate best thing keep head mask on. supposed ‚Äúnot‚Äù there? second half comment thrown off! People going take seriously constant government fuckups. 

My European country never stopped people entering, leaving returning. Isolation upon return monitored. colleague came work day returned Spain. Schools remained operation though children immune. 

Lockdown longer work. People lost trust feel they're implemented punish destroy them. Whether target businesses, jobs mental health. Age artificial barrier. agree need given faster, stock shelves completely logical they're health care workers 65+ first. save lives. 5 dad's coworkers tested positive last 2 months, one lost nephew 30s. Went 'perfectly healthy' respirator, dead, 17 days. said basically one wears masks, including dude lost nephew it. ""Just flu."" ""Not serious."" fucking don't. projection. response COVID-19 pandemic failure, says King would mean Covid burn lockdown protestors save vaccines responsible ones. Yeah thats easiest way achieve herd immunity among ages 18-60 id assume, save 95% efficacy really need sub fucking weird. People talk masks like people talk Remember bask sunlight dont want leave house. Lack sunlight incredible bad health, expescially trying keep immune system healthy. almost like pretending virus exist months half-assing measures really well compared actually addressing issue head evidence based approaches. many times see damn headline I'm buying something idiotic without reliable source.

A terminal cancer patient losing half his/hers remaining 30 days maybe hit bus positive +1 covid death? C'mon. whole world opened would reach herd immunity faster? There's still proof vaccine prevents transmission. 1-2 months test antibodies people 70. would take lab resources. lot made ""irresponsible"" people partying causing numbers go up. element. real reason LA afflicted large population multi-generational families crammed one house. least one likely one works ""essential"" industries make highly exposed virus. pretty well describes latino experience LA overlay map particular combination factors covid patients close. y'all think we're going right direction we're lower number too. company went September said- WFH till September 2021. announced June 2020. work big company.. Oh fuck bullshit. day see someone wearing fucking P100 respirator public day die laughter. reason believe

It looks like cases topping out. 7 day average \~44K December 22. went around holidays 34K December 31 increased back 43K.

If case counts follow pattern rest country seen, there's reason believe start seeing case counts start drop pretty quickly. European contractors build things whilst working home? I'm sure one, i'm also sure vast minority. people visiting infecting others go back home. tragic. Now, talent right - Billy Mack  You‚Äôd look like major dork still started Wuhan. I'm pretty sure back office year, all. Office open, nobody come in. Nothing near DC :( Probably neither. that's real scare think would slow vaccination even already survey people, come antibody test, get back first appointment, rather come in. dont think would good use resources he's charged properly accordance law charges cary jail time yes. know judge cares following law regardless personal feelings it. since beginning. Well maybe dellema trust effectiveness masks. could dont see disease high survival rate threat.

If intrestednin keeping people safe wont wear mask, try gifting vitamin supplements. Vitamin c always good immune systems. affored vitamins give away, give rose buds. (Before flower bloomed) really high vitamin c, getting people boost immune systems good alternitive trying convince wear masks. studying efficacy booster dose then? results single dose released weeks right? That‚Äôs it‚Äôs efficacious rate must Gates' microchips. controls people's minds. Everyone knows that. secret agenda secret world government end humanity making people stop breeding. /s data yet indicate whether vaccinated people greater risk cytokine storms?

Almost colleagues who've gotten second vaccine dose gotten ill around 24h mark. makes wonder exposed COVID could trigger cytokine storm since response vaccine already intense. even say vaccine. You‚Äôre awesome! Thank do. offense maybe need get bubble. It‚Äôs news, lot people radicalized. Last week cashier started ranting ‚Äúit‚Äôs time American people stand up, guns we‚Äôre going take it!‚Äù hear sentiment anytime I‚Äôm public. 75 million Americans think democracy dead election stolen. There‚Äôs real threat next couple years things don‚Äôt change almost like actually something rather pretend exist months overcome may disadvantages outbreak first began, high population density, land borders 10 countries. live Tennessee, known several people who've it. One former coworkers died, we've three family friends die well. think Tennessee number one hotspot back December. People wearing masks taking seriously. local medical examiner's office said overwhelmed. shameful. Yeah latest politics show exciting! Thousands dying? Nah. Disproven many many times Past year? Things like pandemics need planned time measured decades. PPE needed stockpiled, bombs cruise missiles. like attitude. Especially educating much possible part Thanks giving answer already stated came to. National lockdown happen, legally possible discussed 10+ months don‚Äôt know man. work construction. single construction worker states know luxury even day quarantine. I‚Äôm easily busier last two years working shoulder shoulder trenches 10-12 hours day it‚Äôs busy since first wave. means COVID denier exposed anyone could way right gotten sick. There‚Äôs COVID around apparently aren‚Äôt bodies stacking street. see plan; he's gonna take vaccine ""against will"", pull ""I told so"" live life secretly wanted. Yikes, troll narcissist?  necessarily. actual medical-grade surgical masks fit face better, leak less, easier breath chinese non-medical-grade disposable masks. incoming administration's COVID plan released tonight: asks $20 billion funding national vaccine distribution program, $50B testing, $30B PPE. Vaccines way respond new variant, least US. matter well spreads people immune - even immunity widespread, vulnerable immune, lockdown necessary.

The vaccines mass produced - enough delivered already get 10% population - weeks. production go here.

We maintain reasonable precautions - wearing masks social distancing. governments spending efforts facilitating vaccines, wasting time lockdowns. point covid vaccine suffer problems flu vaccine, inability target apply here. tweak *and* target correct strain(s). Trump finally trouble losers don‚Äôt care covid anymore, that‚Äôs reason initially cared get trump out. delivery slots every supermarket area filled back March 2020.

Even takeaways collection only. Yeah, same.

Plus think everyone well ‚Äúcamps‚Äù now. you‚Äôve preventative measures, you‚Äôre used it‚Äôs normal now. haven‚Äôt haven‚Äôt gotten sick, it‚Äôs likely reinforced belief there‚Äôs reason anything. Either way there‚Äôs burnout finger pointing.

Not trying equate soundness reasoning, general experience. Oh, good point. forgot sub in. Thank correction. know people want pretend gone height fury! got vaccine survived bout covid point fool asking death pretend safe there. mean even get shot..some damn day, carry wearing mask public anyway! feel like I'm pretty good PPD front, although reason never talked PPA could legit. baby super fantastic baby clueless motherhood, feel pretty solid... anxiety around covid potentially leaving kid motherless DEFINITE possibility, I'll watch that!! Thank you! re-use disposable masks. put paper bag room temperature 4 days let virus die off.

And medical-grade surgical mask going better cloth mask melt-blown filter layer. Distrust authorities ingrained French mentality since French revolution. Sure, that‚Äôs absolutely true. problem is, maximalist approach lower chance mass compliance long term tempered approach (as see article). mass voluntary compliance approach possibly work democracy. fair, attempted coup last week. know future government is, (as learned) leadership big effect deal pandemic.  It‚Äôs post. marked NSFW.  covid. Even social distancing mask wearing. utterly pisses see friends neighbors taking seriously. mainstream media taken top stories share. Politics important covid, know watching CNN, FOX, MSNBC Mike Dewine, governor Ohio, following similar mindset well Well *did* help us Europe WW2 Marshall plan. curiosity, wearing masks? adopted dog heart worms got him, used slow kill method along doxycycline 4 weeks. Killed worms eggs. month life. happy didn‚Äôt arsenic protocol. Lockdown forever already agreed give shout-out genius expert decided homeless aren‚Äôt exempt Quebec‚Äôs curfew. 

Yes, homeless person isn‚Äôt inside 8 PM, get fined $6000 caught. went work first time since March, two people including masks. Everyone else mask 6 feet apart. Fucking annoying.  Ye, know. thats still wearing mask get vaccine, know sure. 6 months ago wouldve laughed told would corona, state (NH) still comparatively well much worse 6 months ago, went 0-10 cases day hundreds. started going downhill thanksgiving people dont listen. Vaccines seem like much lower priority they've controlled spread virus without them. likelihood reach 5,000 deaths day? heading there?   People lost jobs, businesses, life events, opportunities friends family pandemic. cool downplay takes piss, wearing mask 30mins-an hour whilst shop isn‚Äôt even anything inconvenient. wear one 10 hour shift 5 days week manage fine.

Can‚Äôt blame supermarket staff though honest, I‚Äôve worked one know people like certainly wouldn‚Äôt risk getting punched face minimum wage ! Wyoming... u good bro? Here's wild idea. global travel ban. Multiple strains exist. could catch form new strain back square one. Wait miss something yesterday still can't believe everyone craps pants fear worry virus low death rate. majority people worry someone else dieing, 'idiot' 'part problem'. problem death natural aspect life realize can't start l living. suck sometimes close you, weep people died coronavirus even know. Prior virus deaths cared immediate family. celebrities talked like card we're compassionate person overdosed drugs bought money supported buying albums watching movies. Get up, get out, quit waiting everyone follow orders cure. cute called immune system  there‚Äôs top level, overarching thing I‚Äôm tired country ‚Äúaddressed‚Äù coronavirus it‚Äôs this:

We can‚Äôt wait thing out. I‚Äôm tired hearing people waiting over. 

We waited tests show us bad do. people waiting (this past) Summer magically burn away. we‚Äôre waiting vaccines distribution. 

We cannot wait thing out. need work it. Oh that‚Äôs legit. I‚Äôll see meet requirements (they‚Äôre little different standard).

The problem though concept air going around mask means I‚Äôm breathing bit unfiltered air.

I‚Äôm gonna start using tape spent early working years working people like wish did, believe it. almost staff working class, uneducated job prospects, put anything. even aware legality something like would make effort look it, none could afford lawyer they're barely making enough pay rent buy food. good chunk immigrants, forget it. They're happy country, they're going risk biting hand feeds them, especially they're job they've worked past entry level.

It *is* illegal, means keeping doors open losing business anyway due shutdown, definitely owners willing risk it. looking worldometer accurate active case numbers, don't. lot states report recoveries properly that's active cases rarely gone despite couple waves going already. cruise ship cases like february March active month two ago. doubt it‚Äôll machine washable, maybe wipe alcohol pads? Masks complete replacement distancing. I'd say would also inaccurate say ""that lack social distancing covered mask wearing."" help get wrong, spending hour two within 6 feet people, still potential infect others.


There also businesses masking going work. Bars obvious example. can't mask well drinking business gets massacred social distancing requirements.  Cambridge masks want virus protection God heart skipped beat thought said ‚ÄúSir David Attenborough dies COVID-19‚Äù üò∞ kind place work??? feel like need context. Bye bye freedom. pandemic ever forever, even absence vaccine. People get angry idea social distancing makes little uncomfortable. However, slowing spread actually help us get back normal faster. 

Seriously, learn shit 1918 pandemic. actually took stricter measures better long run got quicker. Philadelphia went full ""I'm fucking mode"" never actually fully financially recovered. read much Reddit bro. privileged fuck lmao. sound like republican looool feel like may reason can't handle Germany anymore then. IFR among worst world, we're gigantic retirement home. we're still first real wave, neighbours seen much higher death counts may already small protection. Driving dangerous. absolutely massive amount laws around driving increase safety, including following traffic laws wearing seatbelt. 

Do realize basically arguing *for* mandates here? Exactly. Couldn‚Äôt agree more. people damn selfish? True fact: homeless exempt Quebec‚Äôs curfew. don‚Äôt make shelter 8 PM, get $6000 fine.

What there‚Äôs shelter space, Canada barely better US comes social supports? $6000 fine.

What overcrowding shelters causes COVID spread? cares, $6000 fine. 

These brilliant geniuses charge pandemic response, case anyone still illusion people recommending lockdowns infallible. point basically amounts something looks like something score political points. buried BIL November 2020 died covid-19. yesterday another state relative checked hospital covid. sister covid survived.

Don't take chances covid 19, care friends family town whatever want pretend gone. man love like brother cold hard ground one laid ICU, again.   Remember talking Norway, work. suspect talking US, really care laws never work there. New recommendations FHI today said doctor. also right doctors Norway stop medical treatment think right. studies long antibodies asymptomatic infections usually last? went concert year ago packed, standing room only. I'm fan cloth mask proper filter inside (from Home Depot Lowe's). really need vaccinate anyone wants it, questions asked, need VACCINES! Im ready!!! thread: people can‚Äôt read past headline, apparently.

No one saying don‚Äôt go store. saying *go less*. Instead going pick couple things twice week, plan 2 weeks worth meals go store once. It‚Äôs husband time. Less trips, substance per trip. Masks social distancing 2024 can‚Äôt visit parents. father plant manager company gets COVID terminate mother already respiratory problems. Hey hey hey, need come personal attacks.

You cannot force people agree risk assessment calling freak disagreeing worldview. need see humanity we're going get this.

I personally think life perpetual social distancing, unable hug family, unable share joy wedding bar mitzvah friend, able laugh bottle wine, life worth living. Especially loved ones vaccinated protected best abilities.

You may disagree. That's fine. talk it. choice.

You say ""In scenario, *is* reality"". Yes, precisely. low non-zero risk associated with, well, living life. say, take risk. worth me. Maybe you, cannot tell worth me. I've home based 15 years, company office hour away several hundred employees based there. closed office around March/April 2020 timeframe. sent email day offices remain closed except essential staff (e.g. people needed data center) September 2021. friend covid Christmas knows gotten someone work. works warehouse BIG COMPANY know. called told exposed someone covid mandatory take test work tested positive. Sounds great right thing do, right? Well found she‚Äôs back work 12 days later initial positive test. Asked meant got negative test go back. answer: nope. Work doesn‚Äôt require take test simply come back long don‚Äôt feel anymore symptoms 10 days. understand people need work also problem.. Honestly think people need do. Put oxygen mask first.

It's good stay aware what's going causes breakdown harm good. Mental health big part surviving many things are. selfish take breaks need to. Also benefits closing state travel.

In beginning, Trump mentioned New York. everyone, mean everyone, went ballistic. idea, one, even hotzone time, NY, wanted it. YES! don‚Äôt buy products. careful make lot stuff names. 
I would asking vaccines, certainly one. isolated cases. one guy 75 heart attacks past. tetanus shot me, bring on! Says green horn college student üòÇ  Hard say, Proud Boys all... forget three headed monster anti-intellectuallism, anti-science religion!  *7,300 new cases

God wish 300.... felt bit lethargic next day bit headache, body ache, could dehydrated. I'm sure. side effects suppose pretty mild. oral-fecal disease. detectable intestines, point time, detectable URT. cop out, nothing more. Even became legal requirement, supermarkets literally issued press releases saying ""nah mate, we're enforcing that."" Meanwhile smaller shops hospitality venues happy properly Covid safe get closed down.

I guarantee first supermarket announce immediately ordered close, rest would magically fallen line.

I disagree concept exemptions though. Preventing spread deadly disease something able opt of.   That's thing, governments wants less deaths many people want that, want shorter pandemic. Michigan, employers terminate employees without cause. employer give reason. say ""pack shit get out."" Although, may actually illegal fire someone getting sick. sign paper could backfire employer. estimates 25-30% exposed end January. thing exponential growth well grows pretty fast. Well, herd immunity achieved - enough people either Covid-19 vaccinated it. Somewhere summer best guess. probably never 100% end. justified ""in home"" technically garage. always cleans well people. lives rurally, pond fish in, booked solid since opened past summer. We've WFH since March estimated date return July, I'm guessing gets pushed again. I've go office twice now... pick office supplies time run bunch copies 11x17 doc home. times VP approval, online symptom survey temp checked door. I'm glad employer f'ing around either.  covid already, still gained weight - also 25 pounds, still mental lows. Yes, initially 
I happy beat thing immunity didn‚Äôt last long ... 
I caught end February/beginning March I‚Äôm hairdresser knows many people infected without even knowing symptoms showed. even went packed Broadway show day got sick ... (this lockdown) 

You right thing careful, hang there, friend! proud right thing. Wake doomer bubble. Know kids safe. ____ (percent thay scares ), look deaths. Kids die number doesn‚Äôt round 0. 

As month ago checked. 132 age 19 died.  132 entire USA 19 I‚Äôm guessing 20-30% population.  get 4 deaths normally go 6 big percentage doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Completely agree don‚Äôt want hard him. He‚Äôs done ton good.

But saying wear masks countries like japan, South Korea, Taiwan, etc wore masks enough evidence show would help. mean surgeons wear masks reason, isn‚Äôt completely new news.

Even told everyone use homemade ones (like eventually ended doing) would relieves stress. could instituted emergency manufacture act produce masks. 
They could bared manufactures selling public (like eventually did.)

Obviously don‚Äôt think anyone entire platform would say couldn‚Äôt handled better. However, saying don‚Äôt need masks Fauchi planted seeds masks important. many anti maskers quote day. even think wrong first time he‚Äôs probably wrong time. TIL work place option us work remotely home. Instead baby boomer ceo wants everyone office much possible instead go 50% working home 50% office swap every week. 3 people get sick continue come work. hate country culture. virus comes six. stupid. tragedy, but, Brazilian, unfortunately can't say I'm surprised.

The government joke, real health minister, chloroquine viewed solution, many places people simply care anymore hospitals overwhelmed. perfect recipe disaster. people take shit seriously. always welcome block sub visit much. cousin Eddie coming visit  someone non bot account please explain us belive this? used services whether agreed not. Someone called ambulance you? Well, that‚Äôs $1,200 car ride. It‚Äôs bill now. It‚Äôs works US. weak. weak virus. kill many. kill me.

It disappear. don‚Äôt know keep going longer, anxiety depression roof.

I scared restrictions virus point. also pay vaccines wrecked. Okay end? COVID completely stop disrupting lives? I've like now, events Washington, D.C. Wednesday 6th strengthened stance matter.

If refuse acknowledge danger COVID-19, handwave away lives needlessly lost, unnecessary human suffering, either directly due illness, economic malaise roiled many people country, get die?

**Humanity better without you!**

Downvote want, care. reading stories people continuing insist overblown they're ICU die hour two later? Good riddance.

My heart sympathies go people trying stay safe, get sick, selfish actions sicken. None whatsoever people refuse wear masks public, refuse social distance, forth. go hike. live infected can't even leave house.

Police random checks see in.

The fact handoff puppy funny. 5 close friends elementary school wives now. they're good friends too. offense, like anxious person. anxiety symptoms. Traditional vaccines provide immunity number mechanisms, containing ""dead"" viral particles. One ways including individual viral protein. Since SARS-CoV-2 jab includes mRNA, cell's protein precursor, acts much like vaccines. Stop whining. Go buy good masks. online supplier masks, get waiting list. buy China. verified suppliers. thanks buddy can‚Äôt get groceries delivered? know sister lives Ohio way get deliveries. Antibodies found U.S. CDC scientists 106 blood donations dated December 2019 - January 2020 ... suggest people could've infected June December 2019?

No. That's ridiculous stretch.    
The paper concludes could December.    Robert Garry, infectious disease expert Tulane University published origins SARS-CoV-2   information available still points China origin pandemic. first documented COVID-19 case United States occurred Washington state individual ‚Äúreturned United States Wuhan January 15, 2020.‚Äù first cases Japan South Korea documented people come Wuhan sum, likelihood many severe upper respiratory infections occurred world November December 2019 actually COVID-19 astronomically low. likelihood earlier pockets broke non-Chinese areas prior December 2019 also low   

It's also unlikely test samples November 2019 found zero. know get info how‚Äôs legal charge something didn‚Äôt consent to?

I‚Äôm assuming corruption created law everyone auto consents medical help. Even bankrupt die.  MindMed We're professionals ignoring crisis. Global warming? Grandkids problem. School shootings? Schools problem. Wealth divide? Bootstraps. Automation? Everyone mechanic. Racism? MLK made magically go away. Covid-19? It'll die summer. It'll kill elderly anyway. worth economy shut down. Masks unconstitutional. China responsible? can't wait 2021.

This country drunk. considered healthy. guy 30 runner. He's still bad shape. couple days ago texted told doctor said lungs permanently damaged. [here's set links vaccine hubs, Texas encompasses 20 counties, setups orders ignore reside. e.g. live Collin County signups, register signups nearby Dallas Tarrant counties

[HEB also launched vaccine registration although rt doses hand. hopefully soon rambles bit.

TL;DR might be- 
People taking COVID seriously COVID patients face prolonged hospital stays may shape health years come. Family members often provide information ways figuring are. find attempt collect payment. good this. There‚Äôs entire industry developed around collecting medical bill payment. looking forward commute, shopping queueing things? don‚Äôt see anything I‚Äôve said selfish, since it‚Äôs safe assume everyone misses contact friends family. It‚Äôs areas life improved, specifically work-life balance spending less time (physically) shopping etc.

I realise everyone work home, lot people are. separate questions, really shows entrenched mindset. probably don‚Äôt clots. truly worried, would something bring doctor. alleviate anxiety, notoriously agoraphobic, hypochondriac internet site. concerns vaccinating seniors care homes vaccines weren‚Äôt tested older weak senior demographic. bad America checked out. Maybe change transfer power Biden. find crazy, live Canada, area serviced regional health system serves ~250k people, don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs Covid got first death week  Estimates covid infection provided 85 percent protection.

That level infection slow numbers it‚Äôs straight up, Chinese-style lockdown could get things control there‚Äôs way we‚Äôd get everyone comply (in US least) barring draconian measures. 

The lockdowns joke. Brazil use Sinovac vaccine We'd fucked lethal, like death-of-a-nation level bad. Look operation dark winter, FEMA DHS basically ran simulation found US critically prepared situation like this. 
 
(this downplaying covid though, still fucking bad killed 380,000+ Americans) France. like headline quoting whole US, applies California. disagree. plenty intelligent educators public health experts too. going show ""investigated"" ü§£ Please tell us ""continuing tune in"" anything except fuck sanity point

We already know do. People still refusing basic things. need keep watching trainwreck, I'm part best fuckin can. yet see someone affected start taking precautions seriously. Biggest change deniers apathetic I've seen they're affected vocal denial anymore, also really altering behavior.  started mass vaccination program NRG stadium today. 4k doses first better nothing. They're also changing allocations counties rural areas. vaccines allotted larger cities. done last year. saw tweet earlier said newpaper headlines cover virus less January last year - even thing outside China. educated people prone conspiracy theories. Look ex military guys they‚Äôve caught insurrectionists ‚Äî attorneys, ceo guys, cops. aren‚Äôt bag boys grocery store. Social media companies, incl reddit, need nationalized Still going get fresh air get mad fuck house? Think again. Also might want start wearing mask inside house. never know /s Im sorry happened. That‚Äôs terrible. hear lot anecdotes occasional younger deaths also possible overcounting inaccuracies. coworker 40s already sick / risk factors healthy? I‚Äôm talking personal social decision-making, disasterous governmental lovkdowns policies. People downvoting they‚Äôre equating social distancing lockdowns, they‚Äôre completely different things. social distancing means staying six feet apart strangers public spaces. doesn‚Äôt upend anyone‚Äôs life. grocery stores!!!! cash mask??? Lets say need better ones now!!!! Looks like Wyoming 50% infection growth. 

In news, 4 people Wyoming tested positive... obviously simple, solution send back hope things get hand. solution simple mind anything I've written? Peak? peak? Says who? options going store either:

1) someone deliver everything (which means there)

or 

2) Stop eating.

Neither one acceptable. Sorry meant be, intention. Keep good work do. Okay, there‚Äôs sterilizing immunity? then? end? clickbait articles comments sure make seem like forever see anything comment, yes. quite bad.  completely agree you. another fear-mongering article tries take sensationalized anecdotal account pass factual.

Preemptive edit downvotes: sibling radiologist top academic institution California, person's ""account"" simply true goes vast body scientific data.   Sounds like needs excuse weekends emergency, didn‚Äôt even approve visit bill though. fuck able collect that.

Like literally unable talk. go on. karaoke nights first leaving courtesy CCP Yeah, stupid. still need stuff to, like, live. It‚Äôs impossible get slot form delivery aswell. vast minority people who's life gotten better pandemic. seriously selfish deluded think otherwise express remorse somewhere statement missed? There‚Äôs little data support that. Ok follow recommendation. Got people tested negative home country mean can't get infected travel. Trying paint making quarantine travelling unnecessary obstacles plainly stupid. I‚Äôll agree disagree then. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs simple That's crazy. son it, sister it. Dad, brother law, 2 cousins, worst thing reported 4 day fever. None went hospital. Weird thing works. There‚Äôs data support that, fear m*ngering us sign waiver back February would keep working caught it, company would pay everything, even though insurance plan.

They shut March. Everyone made money unemployment ever made working there.

In July called us back work new waiver: forced return work. I'm chosing accepting risk. get sick, company held responsible. might die, that's risk I'm willing take.

I job since. refused go back. Yeah -- Like government specs, almost takes degree engineering.  called ""Good"", ""Better"", ""Best"", without technical explanation, would much easier idiots understand.  And, maybe, put sign, something like, ""We sell Bad masks."" Ok got it, cancer victims responsible happens someone refuse wear mask go covid party. logic bended make sure right Let reminder keep saying children risk getting infected virus Yeah that's legal Michigan. Australia: lost job $1500 fortnight. Business lost much revenue government gave help pay staff instead laying off. 
In state test (free here) state government gave $300 stay home got results. Lol basically. Always loved type folks posts going church Sunday, wearing mask day week, driving 5 hours defend confederate statue Wednesday. 

And im individualism capitalism now. Like yea, im honest work hard get fun stuff Bubba wants drink coors lite stock shelves Dollar general. mind Bubba still gets live clean water, full belly, HEALTH CARE AVAILABILITY GOOD EDUCATION, regardless ability motivation. completely fucks dies family lose that. Agreed. really hope one believes stuff.

So CCP, totalitarian regime known covering things (see: Uighur Muslims), restricting free speech, strictly controlling flow information country, yeah, let's trust claim Covid deaths 9 months densely populated country world.

I sincerely hope nobody falling stop eating? start getting vaccine people. think we‚Äôre past point avoiding people. There‚Äôs evidence whatsoever doesn‚Äôt. assumed works immunity diseases proven otherwise, way around. Im day 14 first Moderna dose, interesting see data Figure 2 gives tad confidence especially masking constantly sanitizing hands! Trump created covid? know Impossible U.S. Thanks everyone shouting ""Muh freedoms."" benefits anyway. Economy recovering stock market definitely important 380k Yeah we're talking public. doubt people would deal correctly. work alone archaeology lab that‚Äôs part historic foundation, there‚Äôs additional building property that‚Äôs like admin center. Today, head property came work admin center. tested positive Monday. literally locked door lab saw drive couldn‚Äôt get area. Yes priority helping parents, forcing children back virus filled school I‚Äôm sure regulations know PR would horrendous. Hospitals don‚Äôt check insurance start billing come emergency, many covid patients do. keep billing turn bill collectors refuse pay. Medical bills one leading causes bankruptcy US gives inclination bad is. Lol, minute thought meant *international* travel. like...uhhhhhh.... think driven politics desperation science. general, I'd agree you. It'd understandable using trackers. specifically mentioned JHU data. see mention tracker. Archive link article (no error judgement bringing mask. wearing bandana refused put face. He's a-hole. Ah yes, Gillette model. look forward five-mask package. Thanks!  Thank sharing. I‚Äôm glad vaccine. Ok. got me. However, worst part Fifth Element. character douche movie well. Sweden close nothing, comparison, got better average results terms excess deaths. really already treatments pipe end 2021 could probably treat Covid home nasal spray disposable injection like epi pen sounds like awful idea. I‚Äôm mass vaccinations science (and fully intend get vaccine soon it‚Äôs available me), seems really suspect shitty hold stimulus people‚Äôs heads. Especially federal government barely done anything keep people afloat past 9 months. Nope, testing fairly stable Maybe it‚Äôs lower hoped?  im assuming nasal spray/drip would help case since ear/nose/throat connected   interesting. Especially intemediate yeast known mechanism mutagenesis. I'll dive deeper this. However, even best fitting hypothesis, still wont know sure thing originated. also beginning know one vaccines would work, needed multiple different vaccine development. antibody test relevant vaccine? B117 make people sicker.
It makes people sick published paper month ago help? understand j&amp;j still working vaccine? get contact Moderna pifser make vaccines? need vaccines. make sense continue research point start making vaccines proven work get people vaccines. Yea cloth masks pretty permeable surgical ones paper woven filters much better stopping bacteria viruses getting nothing 100 percent effective people take effective measures decrease transmission Tier 1 needs ramp phase 2 begin. know phase 2 folks ones spreading covid [But 1.25M number include doses occurred 24 CDC states don‚Äôt report weekend, Monday‚Äôs tally includes catch-up prior days. Bloomberg done months ago   attenuate time immune systems lose naivety. probably become seasonal time well. 2nd, 3rd + generation vaccines get better due time. SARS-COV-2 'rule' much longer. lots exercise options don‚Äôt involve gyms. know sub probably going downvote me. open schools safely. brothers school bas open since August, 0 super spreader events.

1. Masks must worn properly day unless outside mask break.

2. Instant 14 day quarantine contact someone positive, cant bypassed negative test.

3. Teachers wear mask face shield.

4. Choice person virtual classes parents.

5. Lunches spread throughout entire school, kids must stay 6 feet apart times.

6. Students leave school different times depending grade level, form transportation. big backlog there's room stuff shut production? hope that's knows he's throwing numbers. I've couting 21st since made announcement lol Remember everyone disgusted Florida making obvious choice? do. Nailed it, thank much, thanks! bad slow, live here.

We crazy cases today, almost 40k cases 40 million country.

Spain lives tourism hope start take vaccinations campaign seriously, even predictions summer majoritary right now...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* oh, TIL  No. That's like saying tire car. spike protien one part virus incapable replicating. 381K/53M = 0.0072 = 0.72% != 0.007%

Some people really astoundingly bad math... Except might different time... Put thinking hat think people 45 much likely get younger people

Why? really evidence this? healthcare even *requiring* vaccinated. Great question! I'm expert virology microbiology background I'll give shot. think asking SARS-CoV-2 follows lysogenic pathway lytic pathway. Viruses use lysogenic cycle (such HIV) incorporate viral genetic material host (human case) genomes. means mitosis/division, daughter cells maintain genetic material, upon stimulus begin producing viral proteins much later on. SARS-CoV-2 use replication process. Instead, RNA genome encapsulated lipid membrane (comprising envelope SARS-CoV-2), fuses cells' lipid membranes 'injects' RNA cells. RNA indistinguishable RNA cells produce code proteins, essentially, virus hijacks protein synthesis machinery produce viral proteins instead. proteins repackaged using cell membranes released cell. new viral particles go repeat cycle infect neighbouring cells. spike protein virus seems really good immune target, immune system produce antibodies bind virus make easier immune cells neutralize. Infected cells would either killed infection (lysis, bursting), immune system recognize infected cells kill apoptosis order stop production virus. hope answers question!   reactionary though? like ""oh cases decline now, fine"" waves keep coming back. Americans dont freak out.they dont. US given 10.3 million vaccines. entire european union given 3.7 million. killing it.

Well, point? trial centered healthcare workers can't avoid around COVID higher levels exposure much viral load general population. far vaccine works practice preventing severe symptoms death.

Yes, N95 mask best, general population use correctly going challenge. 

Perhaps wrong. That's good guess ew us favor go tomm lol Might indeed data, think 1 % daily, stil impressive.

But country world even close vaccinate 10 % daily. even new vaccines, one saying would reality either... got vaccinated evening well-organized easy (ontario). felt like flu shot! That's exactly thought process was. Every Karen throw absolute fit! Chinese, also Nagasaki.   bandana around neck.

It‚Äôs really though it? vaccine rollout limited supply would point operating 24/7 moment. changes supply increases. It‚Äôs perfectly reasonable.  that's true, thats good news US predicted 100 million covid cases already, would speed process heard immunity. hospitals space, high risk people opportunity vaccinated, cases decline mask mandates go away comfortable wearing one. Old age far away biggest risk factor death. Canada median age COVID death something like 84. UK 82, Germany 83 (IIRC), even US think 75 78. 

If concerned high death counts, vaccinating elderly top priority starting retirement nursing homes. believe (or all) Canada's Moderna doses far actually come US. Lonza got Swiss approval start manufacturing Moderna 10 days ago, anything that's come Canada far would presumably US production.

As timelines, BC came expected Q1-Q3 numbers Pfizer Moderna combined, assume share population share, national numbers work to:

Q1: 6M (that includes Dec 2020) 
Q2: 20M 
Q3: 45M

So that's 71M Pfizer + Moderna end September, enough whole population exclude people refuse take (and way enough approved children then). AstraZeneca/J&amp;J/Novavax doses would top that. Assuming they're approved, AZ J&amp;J doses supposed start arriving Canada April so, one released official numbers timelines yet. think Minister Anand mentioned 30-38M Q2 doses total, would suggest 10-18M two assume 20M Pfizer + Moderna. know Ontario mentioned 15M doses Q2 (which 38M nationally), might federal government expecting 4 vaccines. hopefully pretty much anyone wants getting first dose sometime mid-summer.  Directors peak young? Who? Bryan singer? Peter berg? Rodriguez? It‚Äôs always safer cautious, burden proof people believe cause long term damage asymptomatic people. There‚Äôs need assume absolute worst case scenario happen word epidemiology, infection said endemic (from Greek ·ºêŒΩ en ""in, within"" Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøœÇ demos ""people"") population infection constantly maintained baseline level geographic area without external inputs.

The flu also endemic. Well, may unorganized people wait.

But get vaccines arms.

Also understand aggression. I'm even supportive Sweden's handling, I've openly criticizing several times sub, important criticism based actual facts.

Videos great convincing people, good actually proving anything. show situation specific place specific time. Stockholm city 2 million people many relying public transport daily commute, course cases congestion. video show situation whole, pandemic exists whole Sweden metro certain time. *statistics* necessary, prove lot videos. curiosity would attribute obesity to? Genes, overeating, eating bad things, access food, food knowledge/training, house habits? Holy fuck real?!? Source?!?! say confidence spreading misinformation telling truth. lucky people taking videos life right see nobody wearing masks sweden. [This suggests infected people largely safe reinfection 5 months.

However, concerns me. particular, since vaccines normally work mimicking genuine infection, surely protection can't longer. presume vaccines around long enough perform serious study duration protection.

Am right concerned countries UK US ultimately relying vaccination ultimate silver bullet virus, vaccine protection may last long enough give sufficient herd immunity? honestly think kids learn remote vs person head sand. why, even though I'm terrified based mortality odds, still quarantining like I'm 90-year-old emphysema. last thing want end lungs look like 90-year-old emphysema!

Lets forget issues messing ur angiotensin system cause (which covid-19 sars viruses do) ur heart kidney disease . damage theoretically cause self much unlucky suffer severe prolonged infection. Again? overtook it? No, CDC lost credibility back March.

But matter, even support think does. articles same. People focus words ""reopen schools"" ignore words ""when safely"" means ""community spread low."" Right now, we're worst part pandemic *by far*. unequivocally meet standard ""can safely.""

That's mention biggie, speaks directly topic report offered insight risks school teachers staff members, information gathering nationwide infection rates. Ummm how? lol. significant portion population normal. wife vaccine, still can‚Äôt travel, still can‚Äôt go national parks, restaurants, bars etc etc. seems far normal her. let‚Äôs vaccinate general population... ...especially considering infected 1.3 billion people? Oh wait... obviously 100% people going get vaccine. Right 50% health care workers places choosing get it. Obese 20 year old Oklahoman. put group 2 65+ adults comorbidities. Yep! CA, healthcare workers prioritized first line. 34 million doses given, 10 million US: still safe, still effective! Next up, people 65! pages great resources. Show studies Ivermectin, HQC, etc. 

And collection expert opinions regarding early COVID treatment super interesting, too. wild strongly treatments attacked, despite science. wait enough vaccines everybody? CDC says 150,000 unused doses. whether 60% 95% I've read still get virus although less severe still transmit virus what's point vaccination ? I'm looking answers argument thanks working hostess fancy restaurant NYC came dinner one night. perfectly nice charming, even though tshirt jackets required. pass way bathroom, must seen 25 times (sniff). time he‚Äôd make little face joke, appreciated otherwise boring night. 

I sorely disappointed mask thing. probably got written that. thinking along similar lines (love youyang gu's site too), seem like threshold higher many thought. think elderly vulnerable vaccinated see deaths tapering off, restrictions go window 3-5 months immunity vaccine well conflict interest? 3 weeks Florida .... discount fact tons people dying, all, tend report batches. 10,000 reports once, usually means someone catching paperwork, yesterday especially deadly. 7-day average best monitor metric.

At time statistics alarming, they're also trending direction, makes evaluation easy. Everything equals extremely bad, now. No. Nothing makes happier reading news every morning. still check daily. still watch listen press conferences. still wear masks indoors things contactless. husband still works home (as already doing). feel safe feel like keep family friends safe. able take full advantage travelling (young kids) anywhere crowds, lockdown let us know important things life - sharing close friends family. I'm glad without anxiety :) efficacy looks good, think would make sense take shot communities workplaces acceptance low try convince people take it. Let people proactively seek vaccination get double shot since likely show second shot, take shot (single shot, easier storage requirements) communities try educate people get take it. First all, single day 167 deaths, let alone 120 (as current data). many new deaths *reported* Wednesday, Wednesday death numbers always higher due reporting technicalities. See actual deaths

Also, even though testing ramped second wave, regions still hitting limits. currently around 200 - 300 000 tests done weekly (i.e. 2-3% population tested weekly), virus widespread currently still bit low. also see positivity rate getting higher, around 20% last checked. means cases missed.

Lastly, forced testing. Everybody covid may test themselves, especially slight symptoms.  People finally realized politicized was, flattening curve simply failed anything could done Came say this, sure hell wouldn‚Äôt still CEO there. I'm boat here. Trying figure cancer patient active chemo &amp; trial get it. 

When people asked around cancer sub, replies posts one gotten yet matter location wise. 

It seems like they're concerned giving cancer patients. people getting ""not now"" ""we wait see longer"" answers doctors. parents?! reconcile [Report JCVI estimated efficacy single dose Pfizer BioNTech (page 3 onwards) whose goal justify delaying second dose UK?

They calculated vaccine efficiency 1st dose alone really calculated around 50% Since live LA, I've thinking go grocery store. I'd see celebrities every blue moon decent amount character actors C-listers time time different stores. think nice want shopping (a lot assume use personal assistants delivery services) able go shop anonymity 21 since pfizer ;)

thank you! hit 5500 day average. Deaths continue rise slightly lags hospitalizations, increasingly clear hospitalizations inflected. guess, we'll probably peak right around 7-day moving average north 4000, plus minus hundred. 

This based infection trends within states (the Midwest - still spreading quickly - clearly decline - South West clearly starting peak well) impact vaccinations death rates (we'll see death rates case rates prioritization vaccinating highest risk populations). 

The IHME model also predict 5500/day. predicts 5500/day easing existing restrictions botched vaccine rollout. baseline projection lower.

That said, absolutely shameful we're even talking 4000 deaths day. absolute public health failure. reach level, means - least peak period - COVID almost makes half deaths cause. fuck pay?  that‚Äôs least could employees Yup. population gains immunity either vaccines natural infection, virus get milder milder eventually join common cold viruses Weird way say ""I admit I'm asshole"". post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Could expand deep sea divers bit? help do? That's fascinating!  They‚Äôre NY too... exciting Disease Specialist Dr. Mohammed Reza said little data available re-infections, **it appears COVID-19 re-infections becoming likely.**  [reference recent study, published Nov. 27, looked 157 frontline workers, looked antibodies 60 days out. saw 28 percent frontline workers didn‚Äôt antibody, two months out. tells you, possibly, point, could get re-infected,‚Äù Dr. Reza said.

That's good news. hope Boomers consider same.

Dear lord, one listen this. 

Go get vaccinated available you. anyone favors getting right now. Many, many people misjudged Bruce every state this? Yes, case ask professional. know need skin less affected parts, combo cigarettes alcohol might check. Shut seen delaying second doses COVID-19 vaccines spur viral Pretty hard recover dead. Yeah Pfizer/Moderna ones prevent disease. Good, mean people getting vacinated  want know vaccine available, better calling different medical centers near trying make appointment since every medical center may specific vaccine. would certainly nice. There... anything could done? Seriously? that? imply we'll 8k deaths per day February?

Unlikely importantly covid+ around corner. understand, 3,410 cases mostly people tested tested negative. article incorrect. symptoms Pfizer trial, required get tested. exact words used ‚Äú3,410 suspected cases without PCR confirmation‚Äù. mean tested, means test positive.
The thread r/COVID19 clarifies this: Peter Doshi anti-vaccination wack job finds ways discredit vaccines regardless observations correct (they usually aren‚Äôt). Thanks. Can? usually doesn't?? hate Bruce Willis movies really like Fingers crossed 3 get vaccine soon! psychiatric hospital maximum security prison barbed wire all, nearly 1,300 patients housed Patton. largely people accused violent crimes found judges incompetent stand trial guilty mental illness. People committed state psychiatric facilities like Patton typically must remain judge rules would longer pose threat others released. many amazing movies, it‚Äôs sad see asshole he‚Äôs turned Yeah none that. tired day think part go early vaccine got 4 hours sleep night prior it. asteroid hits July... Keep mind health care worker doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean surgeon doctor nurse Im guessing part excellent healthcare general healthiness population. Pretty much. sitting pile doses using them. enough sitting around completely vaccinate multiple states. feds suggested giving new doses states using fastest. even 24 hours later California expanded population that's eligible lot. think never good idea deviate tested proven protocols. efficacy concerns, also regards liability. make claim, burden proof you, me.

With said, [this suggest travelling public transport cut half peak first wave. Finding statistics second wave harder, though [this article suggests significant (30-50%) decrease travel Malm√∂ Gothenburg recent times well. video anecdote comment trusted scientific evidence?. 

I live sweden too, must take bus go work. NOBODY wears masks. count one person full bus.

I go supermarket, count maybe one person rest masks. 

People go usual, see restrain, see barely changes.

I hear comments make nothing reality live everyday. see restaurants nearly full, people living normal life day.

It makes angry telling truth deceptively making people think people sweden wearing masks true. 

Here videos, since see everything anecdote anybody eyes consistent, immediate, much longer period time, though - believe CERB recipients could claim seven months benefit received within days applying. base rate Canada‚Äôs Employment Insurance also increased $500 week many people benefits last year, may comparable lump sum American stimulus even unemployment benefits it‚Äôs way actually useful. method making sterilizing vaccine come with, I'd like hear it. part virus targeting? really, you‚Äôre allowed mask 14 days allowed gatherings week. can‚Äôt go dinner friends.

Surely residency requirement? would treat homeless undocumented? feel whatever way want large majority people. I‚Äôm saying right wrong. People world call Spanish Flu. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs normal name. Covid coronavirus people world call this. sound like idiot want call different names that‚Äôs hill want die on.  Cant get next state anyhow ;) 15KM I'm rather confused California include 65+ people first priority group healthcare workers immediately upon receiving first batch vaccines weeks ago. Older people significantly likely die, make vast majority COVID causalities. think criminally negligent California wait month expect get sometime 2022. May something type 1 diabetic autoimmune disorder type 2? virus mutation, know developed seperately? Turkey trial fewer 2,000 participants. sample size small.  California? Everywhere US. literally guideline. bad outlawed plenty vaccine everyone. Dollar General employees go people? NL63 lead severe disease upon re-exposure. Viral titers increase upon reinfection. Interestingly, seasonal hCoV utilizes ACE2 receptor. cost living Spain? career probably got covid. knew it. knew people would think go mask free vaccine. think usa vaccinate illegals. least legal people vaccinated (should want vaccine).  changed something like ""either quarantine take test 48 hours before/just arriving"", that's extremely similar whatever November overruled 10-day quarantine rule. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø mean this? really idea, trying jackass. California using vaccines feds threaten send elsewhere, California finally stepped up? RemindMe! 45 days problem pandemic Situation many things new, well Data handle global Scale!

It like Tsunami sick People well Data, Reports Studies.

Very similar 3/11 Melt-downs F‚ÄôShima. way people need vaccine available shots. draw line somewhere. wait 3 months covid infection endoscopy kept testing postive. was/am experiencing GI issues since onset COVID. wait three months told stomach inflamed hiatal hernia. hernia probably pre-covid, inflamation/gastritis probably it. general, getting care months near impossible. wish places proper PPE feel confident taking Covid-positive patients. Like, put people hazmat suits that's want order see patients.

I feel sorry man. uncomfortable last 3 months, man endured humiliating, going infection. US plenty time prepare... Don‚Äôt forget also refuse get vaccine well. Hospitals still busy long time.  kids vaccinated? insane? kids died flu California year Coronavirus.

## Conclusions

We attempted clarify dispel several common myths around science underpinning airborne transmission viruses. myths presented easily dismantled consideration given physical, epidemiological virological principles respiratory aerosols produced disseminated; secondary cases infection (or cannot) readily identified; appropriate infection control measures actually can, do, affect risk transmission. **There mounting evidence support presence transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 inhalation airborne viruses. Exposure small airborne particles - even - likely lead infection SARS-CoV-2 widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and/or direct contact infected people contaminated explanations rationale SARS-CoV-2 transmission applied respiratory viruses, need consider number different types studies available specific mean infection control practitioners healthcare, well general population? Aside obvious benefits Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), existing evidence sufficiently strong warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission part overall strategy limit infection risk indoors.

These would include sufficient effective ventilation, possibly enhanced particle filtration air disinfection; avoidance systems recirculate mix air. Opening windows, subject thermal comfort security, provides gesture towards reducing risk infection lingering viral control overcrowding healthcare confined indoor environments community, including public transport, also relevant. exist range cost-effective measures aimed diluting infectious airborne particles homes hospitals easily implemented, without major renovation serve protect us seek evidence required reduce risk Covid-19 coming months years. time discard myths rewrite science viral transmission. sums me. went large Asda day Bristol. amount people pairs groups without masks distressing. simply dropped collect + parcel decided shopping somehwer else. There's many ways say ""We're fucked"" again... Yeah, usually call fake news point rubbish that's disproved thousand times over. Corona passe. dual governments moment Found Sinophobe. hope mean 50% nurses take vaccine. oh yea, denying 2 people showed positive infection recently outrageous move, right? instead, open gate infected still ongoing pandemic, especially infected.  read somewhere people start producing antibodies right away. happen 10 rapid test cassettes researcher friend gave me.  Yup, anyone saying would cause massive lines, break age finely want. change age daily want. Tuesday could anyone born March 1952, Wednesday could April 1952, etc... easy solution. keep supply coming logistics scheduling basically take care themselves. Yeah remember state 1st, 10th cases like ""what??"" becomes 1 million like ""ok"". Good think connection two things.

It would sad nurses need rewarded way.We need call direct incentives, rather let rely luck. Come live Thailand criticize King, would love jails. takes months train workers. Moderna vaccine, calculated would take 8,000 workers make 16 billion vaccines yearly. Training also expensive takes away people job elsewhere. website collecting/collating reporting instances side effects various vaccines?

I 99% certain I'll get vaccine, bad reactions certain things past. Although none things vaccines. sound mild  continued ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù would mean countries go lockdown also That's media beating everyone head year constant reporting every twist turn down.. bleeds leads. regard may people mentally thing stay mentally healthy tune out.  shit really hitting fan can't pozsibly care, we're worked out. is.. highly doubt that‚Äôs meant. don‚Äôt think people never symptoms lung damage like see picture. doesn‚Äôt make sense. can‚Äôt know didn‚Äôt expand upon meant. Yep. hear every single Asian African nation.

Westerners can't seem accept fact Sub-Saharan Africa East Asia done better Western nations (minus Australia New Zealand).

The 21st century belong Asia Oceania. 22nd century belong Africa. can‚Äôt use plastic straws want everyone wearing new disposable mask every day...so much trash everywhere. Possibly needed, fair enough. messaging probably wouldn‚Äôt actively damaging program, unlike article. fat ass uncle dead mofo covid! Good riddance say. likely yes.  ‚ÄúThe fact staff rates growing faster rate community rates something paying attention to,‚Äù said Emily Oster, Brown University researcher spearheaded analysis collection November, Oster [pointed data showing New York teachers likely COVID others community. **That longer case New York, hasn‚Äôt case Texas months** ‚Äî two states best data Anybody die yet? think much jokes first person work dies. got sent email work head honcho said lot deaths family members people work still mandating masks requiring vaccine shot 1c able get earlier getting better.

Days 1% vaccinated = 19 days

Days 2% vaccinated = 8 days

Days 3% vaccinated = 5 days also link within article going contract August spells things pretty well. J&amp;J given reason wont hit production targets, claimed begin production August currently exactly zero doses complete, much figure out. didnt That's it? manslaughter charges vaccines destroyed?  Nah. shit needs end 2021. issue rate kills perfectly young people incredibly low.

No, issue even mild cases, perfectly healthy young people, covid cause damage multiple even didn't, still pass people die it. always personally. Uhm. Skin temperature levels duration probably good mention inhaling hot steam prolonged periods also cause issues.

Then again, know. so, structured like bonus would get extra money delivered vaccine earlier. might provided correct incentive structure. Really say ""masks needed two weeks second dose."" good enough resume normal.  second video normal flow rush hour experienced everyday go work. fact buses keep full many times nobody wears masks all. count 100 people maybe 2 5 mask. restaurants, supermarkets, shopping malls.

So representative everyday situation.

What really makes angry swedes trying downplay everything rest world forced wear masks. cases double 80% people ICU COVID die? Indeed, think many states federal government threatened start prioritize distribution vaccines fast administered. Americans completely incapable caring problems affects personally-we see literally everything.


This isnt United States problem either. seen behavior European South American countries well. US, follow individual state nearby county hit records, adds up. 951,324 yesterday (not counting 2nd doses).

We really closer 2m/day, may happen February keep making gains past weeks. Lmao, **full** lockdown Hebei right people complained **zero** improvement compared happened Wuhan last year. learn China watching CGTN global times?

Restaurants packed, movie theaters bars good time. It‚Äôs fucking insanity Exactly. best believe 75-80% us stop they're longer mandated. base one two cases reinfection single paper showing mild antibody escape convalescent sera. Americans never tuned in. yeah, think there's difference personal emotional response level care societal level action

ex: lost anyone drunk driving incident, emotional response someone has, still support evidence based interventions reduce DUIs, offer friends rides im sober, etc Yuo worrying aint going good.

O theres evidence suggest right things catch covid19 symptoms likely milder due lower viral load.

So keep said doing. Oh yeah won‚Äôt create issues /s

People absolutely lose shit it‚Äôs required. lol agree you. That's referred representative trying ""insane"". stop writing walls text now. mean measles killed millions people resulted blindness brain damage others. haven‚Äôt eradicated yet.   Please cue extra-super-contagious COVID-19 mutation UK may released upon world. find peeing section thing hilarious. part hoped catching would leave disfigured, people cant cope invisible illnesses. Yeah, I'm gonna keep wearing neck gaiters over. least keep warm winter. Guess I‚Äôm screwed working emergency department wearing surgical mask taking care patients Same. 

I would made 3.5-4x much money said ‚Äúcan‚Äôt come in, there‚Äôs plague‚Äù, gotten fired; sat home watching Netflix collecting check.

Inoculate healthcare workers, teachers, rest public facing critical infrastructure police/fire. frontline workers. 

Then everyone else. Instead getting outraged anyone thought question person might done something like this?. Perhaps know something don't. This. nasty condescending tone. hope author parachute jumping horse high. 2 weeks second dose thought reached maximum protection. whatever want following local rules restrictions respect others. Please aware government funded private enterprise CDC guidelines. law enforcement agency authority ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù access. maybe Reddit stop shallow learn judge books what's opposed covers. Appearently 7-day-Incidence per 100.000 people highest among 80+ people Germany 333 even surprised break new death record every day.

It's insane spectecular fail protecting vulnerable.

Seems like number intensive care patience reducing least.

Edit: Forgot source (couldn't find english translation) Countries higher transmission variants yet want in. anti-vaccine political motivation Clicked link ""Sinclair Broadcast Group"".... thanks! I‚Äôve thrown away sneezed smelled awful, straps broke, long actually wore out. know found n95s sterilized 20 times so... I‚Äôd guess 20 times? Sounds rough, about:

Stock food **close PLANET (or least developed countries) 3 weeks** good.

Stay home, transport, air travel, schools, visits, sports, nobody streets. Military streets, trespassers arrested contained camp batches 3 weeks last individual batch recovered. Yes, abuse. also abuse complying measures.

Otherwise it'll linger us years. would assume surgical better somewhat standardized known least base level protection. Cloth mask effectiveness depend fabric type, thread count, etc., really telling effective specific one is. sure offer protection, probably offer less tend comfortable ones people go for. Get line bud, projected US 100 million people already covid, 20+ million five regions Denmark quite decentralised. choose electronic systems on. Basically get money state find best use within medical law.
Municipalities also responsible medical care hospitals etc.

National things like databases question course managed national level. politics dig? know poster State Washington, Washington District Colombia, seat national government, right?

Washington state full state parks, glaciers, interesting people, mostly decent economy really good cities towns. Also drug addicts, homelessness, racist militias states somewhere, either hidden surface obvious open. No, that's OC43. Yeah, hard compete coup attempt news attention. Hope get focus back next week. Evidence kind sketchy 1890 pandemic. mainly based timing cross event best guess estimate. try make association SARS-CoV-2 terms symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 OC43 use different receptors. ACE2, instance, found cardiomyocytes one reasons see cardiac involvement. OC43 generally associated cardiac involvement associated gastrointestinal involvement really noted Russian pandemic. could go either way one we'll probably never know. 

I hope we're seeing birth another endemic hCoV. Everybody assumes viruses become less lethal time there's really selective pressure given transmission likely occur viral titers highest, symptoms start SARS-CoV-2. Greater LA (or rather SoCal) metropolitan region isn‚Äôt liberal. OC used KKK capital southwest. Love guy: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve jabbed many times,‚Äù said Ian Hurley, 80, former policeman helped create Crimestoppers phone line never misses chance show edgy sense humor.

‚ÄúWhatever case is, might walk cross road get run over,‚Äù said. tried get pediatric Pfizer trial area spots filled up. moderna open spot, I‚Äôll take True, distancing not. Still point remains people need stop thinking one even 2 shots vaccine means you‚Äôre invincible. doesn‚Äôt. still need take precautions. Multiplying US deaths 5 gives meaningless number. compare UK either need divide US death 5 multiply UK deaths 5. far I'm aware tested across age ranges none went hospital. trail something like 30000 participants. info I'm going digging again.  long term care facilities actually requiring heavily pressuring staff get it. understand may legal liabilities come requiring it. 85% type 1 patients definitely autoimmune. 15% detectable beta cell autoantibodies.  sub seems equate COVID response overall government competence. one crisis well-managed authoritarianism, let excuse human rights abuses Chinese government.

China's government features lot redditors would like see own, still considerable communist influence. However, COVID =/= overall government competence. I'd rather government fails protect 400,000 government knowingly kills 1 million+.  want push far say it: perhaps anything West achieve goal mentioned would resemble China already doing. Vaccines one example - government pledged supply developing countries. know far going still contrast developed countries supposedly hogging vaccine supplies. Despite lower efficiency, inactivated vaccines apparently require less strict storage conditions mRNA they're suited underdeveloped areas poor infrastructure.

Sorry assumed much. figured mainstream Western political parties would little overlap mainstream Chinese values, I'm familiar Green minor US parties. searched bit values seem much better, sadly seem like dem/rep dichotomy going anywhere soon. guess US ever get Green president least someone drastically dem/rep, it'll show US system capable more. However said, might also involve like China, real China live instead Nazi surrogate portrayed Western mainstream narratives. Sure, I‚Äôll wear mask going walk forest. /s slow worldwide rollout, US still 1/3 worldwide total vaccines used far, 10.8 million world 32.6 million used. Horse manure. discover it? defense, suspect first sentence ended differently intended started :)

Thanks lesson though, thorough. ones saying ""5k day?! Ridiculous! get 4.5"" really considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù children though? ~ 1 million children die COVID (~100 deaths US tens millions cases), would literally need risk whatsoever make worth it. agree risk crazy low, zero? everyone 40+ absolutely. Redditors rejoicing news lmao ten percent Americans know covid time vaccine available them. worth hassle [report confirmed CCP lying Chinese officials gave world optimistic data access internally

And said UK different China. China change definition, suddenly found **unreported** deaths equals current death number initially saw story hoped sanity misunderstanding, may thought specific vials already spoiled left something. alas, dumb. players tested positive virus asymptomatic months ago could actually false positives. players tested antibody levels determine level immunity. isn‚Äôt currently leaguewide procedure place regularly test levels.

They first formed partnership Biontech help develop vaccines 2018, Pfizer long history vaccine development, along deep pockets 

They expanded relationship spring 2020, Pfizer injecting $700 million, covering 100% vaccine development costs Sorry guess misunderstood you. Yes. know tests alone indicative cases, right? many false positives negatives. 

Also, look number tests done number cases confirmed, see India's cases peaked around 100K per day number dramatic downward slide less 20k per day last seven days. number tests done continue stay pace.

A better indicator number deaths, actual record hospitalizations attributable Covid-19. 

Covid-19, first pandemic India encountered 30 years, become quite adapt handling new one one. Joke aside, good. quit stroke earlier year. (I quit then, LOL) read article epidemiologist like month ago said need prepare intermittent outbreaks rolling lockdowns potentially 5-10 listening person? make handsewn reusable dickbill masks? pictures? That‚Äôs interesting! Yeah bad FYI life back 'normal' dependent upon vaccine efficacy. Much head - young healthy people virtually risk virus irrationally afraid death it.

Case point, drive around anywhere Florida states without crazy restrictions, life already back normal 99% people.

I strongly suspect people sub, take LOT longer get back 'normal' vs rest us. point is, he's danger community. say, ""oh well, I'm support him."" arrested charged brandishing intentionally transmitting infectious disease. Direct contact matter. come contact someone else, gives them, contact someone else parent grandparent gets sick dies. That's works.

Not 50% COVID hospitalizations age 65, 25-30% 18-49 years age.

Just visit CDC data COVID hospitalizations, choose percentage see yourself: large number young healthy people complications COVID. even make individual districts bid buy PPE swiped government? Sounds like need Freedom ^tm there. That's leaving money table. Biontech supplying Germany Turkey 

Pfizer supplying rest EU youve court? held ball lebron held? marched right past armed security like owned staples center? Pretty rare atm, get unlucky af Nothing like letting free market handle century pandemic.. mom put HEPA filter supposed go miele vacuum cloth mask goes out. It‚Äôs better mask.  that's true, one side seems objectively pro-virus.  Luke wanted spread covid anything differently now: wearing masks, rushing reopen everything regardless data, ignoring sidelining science, on. License suspended? revoked jailed too?  exactly it. soon positivity percentage goes back like 5%, lot people vaccinated, hospitals risk running beds, I'm going keep up. think ""new normal"" messaging sucked. hanging friends deciding ""let's go see movie"" without whole risk analysis, realizing shouldn't, sucks.

I'm really hoping stamp stuff summer warms stuff. LOL 1. enough respirators everyone. Laws supply demand, they're $60-90 demand high, ludicrous. 300,000,000 respirators floating around. Heck, try buy one looking getting used one one that's filters swiped box sold separately people desperate.

2. They're uncomfortable fuck. N95's bad enough, full cartridge respirator heavy, rigid, hurts head, neck, face. They're specifically working hazardous environments. I'd gladly wear one go COVID ward, course, they're kind overkill grocery shopping. 

3. can't get people wear cloth masks, makes think they're going strap Hannibal Lecter headpiece? mean, get wrong, could order M3 respirator looked like Vader's helmet Bane's mask (the Nolan one, look good luchador gear) I'd probably it. people quite so... dorky. Lol, wut? Yes, increasing 1 20 would massive % increase. No, it‚Äôs still big deal. Hey fellow houstonian! I'd love sent link pattern. Thanks much! read, new variants (UK &amp; SA) cause higher nasopharyngeal viral loads, means infected exhale virus comparison older variants. 

The mutations small change structure virus thus transmission modes. 

Winter weather help. Airborne particles main mode. Yeah well prob mostly normal may summer. reason get feelings hurt  Yes, done federal level, also done state level California reason leading issues. mean? presented countries currently recording deaths per capita US. India, even essential surgery cost around 6 months salary. government care. like: fucking die see plenty patients admitted Covid-19 role.

One things stands lungs covid patients fibrosis scarring, lung collapse, loss perfusion lung segments, relatively large scale compared COPD (classic smoking emphysema pulmonary fibrosis), less interstitial disease, causes widespread pathology small air sacs (alveoli).

tl;dr like comparing death thousand cuts hammer blow. uplifting.

Good them. Get time. government though? Local government? State government, federal government? trying hold get sick get vaccine.

I've socially distanced 10 months, handle 2-3 more. right 400k there's explain discrepancies population. makes lot sense actually. suppose it'd worse revoke immediately. Sure, blindly trusting someone clearly illogical. Trusting clinical trials foremost virology experts world hand... Key points one rigorous analyses immunity reinfection:

* Study included 20,787 healthcare workers infected UK's first wave, 6,614 tested positive antibodies start study.
* Ran 18th June - 24th November.
* participants PCR antibody tested every 2-4 weeks.
* study period, **44** previously infected healthcare workers tested positive again: compares 318 previously non-infected participants.
* Protection reinfection estimated **83%** 5 months based data.
* 2 reinfections identified ""probable"", whilst rest ""possible"": therefore assumed true number reinfections may slightly lower (work ongoing confirm this).
* Crucially, **most reinfections mild.**
* Participants continue followed year assess changes immunity. Work also done see impact variants VOC202012/01 results, also find long vaccine-induced immunity lasts. prefer pharmacists stick area expertise...  know efficacy neck gaiters masks, particularly double over? Legit asking, seen wide range takes them, ""they work all!"" ""they effective cloth masks"". least ""X. that's good thing"" trend died down. No. terrible choice words.  really. CDC officially expanded candidates ramped distribution last couple days. like one day under. We‚Äôre vaccinating quicker countries per capita among countries size lol. Good questions. know seem trying keep people ICU immediate future act swiftly inundated. [That would really seen Japanese mass vaccination? It‚Äôs like army routine, 50 people gather line arm sleeves rolled up, line moves like getting Dunkin‚Äô donut coffee. point routinely school office settings. always wondered Matt Damon‚Äôs character immune virus - maybe it. True guess better way put - people informed ever going be. inform someone much care listen. Fair, though mileage may vary too. Even within denomination vary wildly.   
And every teacher good teacher, teaching relevant much less true information. even are, questioning result proofs &amp; evidence dismissal.  
Also it‚Äôs good hear good public schools there, thank comment. filters especially face mask muffle voice much it‚Äôs hard wear I‚Äôm teaching, especially 70 kids cafeteria eating yelling communicate friends sitting 6 feet apart. Sometimes, way communicate students pull mask yell kid wearing mask seat. It‚Äôs frustrating situation. 

I still teach filter mask, face shield makes hard communicate. wear cafeteria, I‚Äôm constantly lifting talk students. wish vaccine sight me, word yet. parents. given enough country deserve able enjoy golden years instead waiting another six months. problem letting ahead vaccination line. 

I zero resentment grandmas grandpas want travel eat restaurants whatever darn well please. Many states it‚Äôs legal pharmacists dispense medicine conflicts religious beliefs. Yea least you‚Äôre disregarding regulations like many people are. EVERYONE PANIC! I‚Äôve like since masks went debate simple mitigation strategies. Nothing much avoid crowds can, wear mask hope others are, hope best vaccine. since March feel got couple months general public goes vaccines like scalpers PS5s unless people area still ‚Äúiffy‚Äù vaccines leave possible openings me.

Xmas New Years numbers probably start coming soon, weeks hopefully numbers start going somewhat manageable numbers slowly people start taking vaccine. owe labor you?

If think health care right, yep. privilege, obligation extends ways. right, extends one way. one‚Äôs life upended social distancing, wearing mask, frequent handwashing. That‚Äôs perception/opinion worsened due America‚Äôs conspiratorial nature deep political wedge nation right now. employer told can't surgical mask N95, customer told you?

If customer, simply tell following CDC recommendations, elevated risk COVID19. wearing N95 mask your, their, protection. 

No fortune 500 company going policy allow N95 masks. Give time. I'm sure they'll smooth eventually. r/lostredditors downvoted, yeah. Lung tissue heals. pack day smoker decades, stop, lungs get better. takes years. Lung tissue grows surely, slowly. confused.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Everyone pretty highly informed point, regardless care

I wouldnt sure that. dont think using word ""everyone"" anywhere near accurate. think many people stopped paying attention immediately informed, much less highly informed. Many others completely misinformed. Many others dont care informed simply arent. that‚Äôs goal ban smoking altogether? live smoker, get priority vaccine too? I‚Äôm technically higher risk. would think that, remember reading early shocked smokers hospital it. Jain disturbing me. pray Hindu brothers sisters exercise caution, Jai Hind properly charged lose license end story. can‚Äôt trust someone like end responsible many lives. No, countries recording ""4000k deaths day"" (I'm assuming meant 4000 there) significantly lower populations. Germany, Sweden, Panama, Portugal, UK Czechia examples (not limited these) countries currently recording deaths per capita US.

Absolute figures irrelevant. relied someone shop veggies before? Maybe viral load low new test didnt detect previous test detected. Remindme! 120 days said sounds like is.  yo grandma appointment FRIDAY. like first county. People care say Biden got people killed via COVID inaction, kinda like Obama economy.

So yeah given inaguration. cares, death death...

Was stating that, since said *""But tuberculosis defeated mostly""*, fact trailing right behind covid. all? people arent going space suit gotta get groceries necessarily. virus would need evolve less virulent. Come on, know shtick. ""It tested enough"" ""It's new mRNA tech dangerous that"" know rest theories.

I also think call make decision, again, often call make important decisions sometimes.

Our beliefs necessarily determined strength science behind them. We're emotional creatures. We're influenced media, social circle on. Frankly pharmacologist direct access ""science"" begin with.

I see people certain opinions ""this safest vaccine history humanity"" opinions unfounded based emotion, rather science. 

We like believe we're rational. ain't. also weird countries get zero attention well well, others get tons.  Yeah it‚Äôs shame. family like too. keep driving home focus healthcare workers. seems one factor can‚Äôt explained away fake news/hoax/flu conspiracies. Doesn‚Äôt seem much effect hoped keep trying. Suspended???? would really b concerned receiving medicine person Could also symptom new infectious variants spreading. Probably bit bit that. Even seemed given up.  one nationwide serious lockdown last March two weeks we've given up. 

After lockdown there's relentless push right side media politicians go ignore pandemic.  ""Get back work, go lives, wear mask.""  Constant propaganda. Turn news week. Find park go walks. going civil war. ""coup attempt"" got close success trying LA Lakers.

Believe world still mostly okay. consumed worry point feel like human ""the virus might kill without ever getting sick"" time reset. real. irresponsible article time people ignoring masks altogether. addition billions one time masks discarded environment, whereas cloth masks reusable. Moderna estimated vaccine good year unsure others need yeah versatile la county population 10 million Yes, seem like starting take care backlog now, lag going down. probably see days high numbers coming week.

And clear enough: single day even close 351 deaths. deadliest day far whole pandemic Dec 17, currently 118 deaths reported. would you, one said death rates high enough make every person knows someone died first hand. kind actual idiot confused know one 400k 300 million citizens, combined believe entire globe make little old think one way another. Never mind long term damage organs. 

Actually epitome human stupidity selfishness. ""Better"" problem there. likely depends type protection way might exposed.

If around COVID patients day, blocking 95% overall large number particles may better limits amount overall exposure. walking store, mostly want stop bigger droplets.

Plus, N95 masks require fit test get 95% we're going billion people. normal circumstances, blocking spread via larger drops people probably best understand more.

Edit: sorry, said surgical masks. think point still valid I'm leaving it. Pharmacists get hefty dose science education. disturbing think went far astray believe DNA nonsense. Still 'mostly' think meant there's all. teach good China's methods is, I'm fully aware hard lockdowns ugly easy lot people. I'm reminding you, China, either packed hospitals struggle keep surge like Wuhan first outbreak. time there's doubt lives would lost. think would better choice? long bf parent's need isolate?
His mother feeling well since last friday. husband took test yesterday, morning tests came. Mother positive, father negative. Mother insists comoliting 10 days self isolation sunday. Father going work time, tested negative. says stop isolating wife stop isolating. think 4 days since approved results soon.
What math one?  Completely true. factors modern medical history, Christakis writes *Apollo‚Äôs Arrow*, **vaccines cures infectious disease typically arrived, arrive, end stage disease, damage already done death rate dramatically declined**. measles, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, typhoid, miracle drugs didn‚Äôt bring rampant disease sudden end ‚Äî shut door good outbreaks largely died already. **This phenomenon called McKeown hypothesis ‚Äî medical interventions tend play small role compared public-health measures, socioeconomic advances, natural dynamics disease spreads fact veins extremities contract cold weather imply bad cardiovascular state, that‚Äôs body trying maintain consistent core temperature (less warm blood goes = less blood cooled going back in). work 15h/week heart certainly better shape 95% western population disregard genetic disorders etc. Yes, asthma counts. condition diabetes, recent surgeries, immune diseases, heart diseases, severely overweight, liver kidney diseases....will qualify you. China reporting region includes Hong Kong Macau China national health commission numbers include Chinese mainland.

And yes, significant (although declining) COVID outbreak HK.

Trying present gotcha makes look either lazy dishonest. Tested adults. Children's bodies tiny adults. react differently medications vaccines. equivalent people signed initial testing. Adults make decisions safety. Children not. Plenty parents comfortable this. *That's USSR still great nation... Right? Oh wait...*

The USSR lost literally entire generation young men came WWII completely shattered industrial base.

The part USSR emerged intact WWII basic national sovereignty, that's it. that's win, keep it. Great article. many cooks kitchen. Kids nasty little things definitely spread RONA. insinuating here?

Vaccines don‚Äôt work? what? Lol.  Keep wearing N95. say can't, challenge directly. Haven‚Äôt heard anything pregnant people yet either, even though it‚Äôs proven they‚Äôre higher risk get Covid. People hearing things past 10 months. They've made decisions want handle covid-19 now. We've anything necessary grocery shopping exercising neighborhood park early mornings fills people.

If risk assessment leads behave ways endanger people way, fact wrong. dumb, malicious.  Well shared responsibility well. healthy 55 personally feel personally little risk virus statistics bear out, especially lockdown.

The risk virus heavily skewed towards small segment population, 80-90% hospitalizations fatalities people 65+ health conditions, half fatalities nursing homes.

I responsible actions never set foot nursing home within 100 feet anyone 65+ months. isolate society based minuscule chance inadvertently link chain transmission someone infected someone nursing home? also responsibility risk group isolate people run nursing homes super careful spread virus there.

How much risk/responsibility mine personally? honest continued surprised many fatalities subgroup people month month. would think one 1 people 8 65+ health conditions read headlines would super careful. stories doctors love jobs much can't stay away 65 diabetic 50 pounds overweight go work anyway. people taking crazy risks. somehow thousands thousands people caught virus sick dead. heck thinking? wear mask wash hands avoid people? not?

This long winded justification avoiding lockdowns wear mask isolate social norms rather risk. think affects risk family friends one bit. 80-something in-laws 300 miles away see besides little risk. many developed countries? evidence 25 year old smoker higher risk 55 year old conditions?

I opposed true, kind doubt true. deductibles? Agreed. take science works better debate, think situation would still same. really whats available whats affordable, combined education. $5-10$ mask wash reuse much want (and likley put filter choose) much practical people budget buying boxes surgical masks. Also, sheer amount waste comes disposable masks insane, digging things ocean every nook crany planet decades come, know several people choose use reason alone. masks pros cons, ultimately think people choose wear masks make mask shopping decisions based affordability, comfort, style, ect, less effectiveness. people prioritize effectiveness, well, im yet common pleb able buy even one N95 mask, would say effectiveness priority, government needs make effective masks actually attainable average folks.

Article continues Part people dont money buy disposable n95 masks long. would add up. Reusable masks necessary many people theyre economical. 

Of course issue partly havent properly informed, government done nothing help inform public provide masks unlike many countries. i'm waiting manslaughter charges. like what, 240 deaths per day? population 40 million?
I live Rio, 1 death every 10 minutes, population 16 million. Believe me, I'd rather California. post couple weeks ago story first got attention, redditor explained vaccine could changed RNA/DNA working mRNA level instead. sleepy look post well written. mayor Wuhan spoke TV allowed disclose virus receiving permission local government, need get authorisation disclosure"" admit someone lying, answer cannot obvious 2021 Wacky Wednesday every week something major happening every Wednesday.

One done terms disinformation - article published last year Jama ultimately retracted. HCQ Remdesivir shown detrimental painted, patients reportedly ""okay"" them. 

The media government said ""shut we'll reopened time"" - work. Blind faith went window, government needed tell truth, told stories ""hope"" ultimately wrong.

The media said ""X politicians save us / harm us"" clearly sensationalist, sides. Cuomo (D-NY gov) wrong nursing homes, deSantis (R-Fl gov) wrong reopening saying worry. Newsom (D-Ca gov) wrong criticizing NY botched response, many people saying ""California right, lol what's wrong NY"", Abbott (R-Tx gov) wrong questioning it.

I mean factors per million direct comparison. worth - virus mutation works, less deadly time, infectious time.

Its really simple concept happy fear mongering.

A virus variant causes individual develop severe deadly symptoms spread new hosts fast one inflicts mild managable symptoms. host secere symptoms likely stay away individuals, isolated hospital hindered enough normal social interactions occur. mild symptom / infectious variant able spread variant able thrive host without killing it.

I truly understand anyone using common sense believes this. Keep mind Florida completely open performing better half states nation (even vax distribution). Really don‚Äôt think open gyms suicidal sub wants be. Perfect excuse kick investigators ensure don‚Äôt find anything. Damn that's almost 0.1% death rate. That's scary.

I can't anything large, car, kids, try avoid single-use plastics (impossible, try), eat less meat, buy local, fly around planes. end day, actions enough we're sorta fucked think focus what's front me. probably prevent spread, know sure, treat doesn‚Äôt. ‚Äòprobably‚Äô isn‚Äôt best basis decision making pandemic. still know anybody covid none family got it. Dude, commenting fucking thread want call people bots? dude clearly brazilian, check profile. Social distancing : washing hands, standing away people (1metre 2metres, depending countries), wearing mask, spending time enclosed spaces people live you, throwing disposable tissue dustbin one use.

But want burry prepper's cave months, that's you. impacts kills someone care about, *shocked Pikachu*.

Sometimes, they'll hang onto stubborness even beyond death.

Oooo, driver cover one while. That‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs black white. Even 5% trial participants develop Covid symptoms mild cases. it‚Äôs falling 5% means you‚Äôll see benefits vaccine. ""salaried"" government lockdowns happen late virus already spread. Look New Zealand, Australia, China, South Korea.

This ""I've assessed risks decided differently you"" thing basically pro-drunk driving argument. pretends risk person reckless, that's absolutely untrue. says patients who've COVID-19 symptoms show severe chest X-ray every time, **those asymptomatic show severe chest X-ray 70% 80% time.**""

I'd say that's pretty concerning. Lmao ok buddy. How's weather fantasy land? unicorns migrating yet? underlings health issues. It‚Äôs hard calling underling, little praise poor pay. That's cultural problem, human-nature problem. really surprising people care mom stranger they've never heard of? really surprising people want locked home months months?

Every single country planet struggling except handful tiny island nations Pacific. something wrecking whole world, indicator problem country-specific. J&amp;J delayed now? mean US data later, still come late January like it‚Äôs supposed to? point view, I‚Äôm gonna vaccine, there‚Äôs zero point kind distancing longer. Zero, none, nada. feel free want whole idea don‚Äôt wear masks distance worry anything longer. There‚Äôs point me. want see friends faces hang things. ribosomes produce mRNA strand itself. mRNA degraded, matter couple days. half life spike protein also couple days spike proteins recognized immune system causes proliferation specific immune cells recognize it. cells ready go next time see spike protein. 

Within week receiving vaccine, nothing left cells. difference body greater number immune cells trained specifically recognize spike protein. works people contained. still people traveling states. also remember even though Governor like California‚Äôs would favor policy, Mayors may especially rural areas. WV north dakota kicking california new york's ass. Money might problem Read article, seeing asymptomatic patients well. Learn use google. find things yourself. birthday 6th. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll take like champ lice :) (a) good person

(b) (like me) already 'rona mean can't contract *again*--it bitch first time, look forward risking Bc don‚Äôt know ur talking about. That‚Äôs evident bc instance us government isn‚Äôt even charge vaccine rollout 

Don‚Äôt get feelings hurt understand things gonna alright person infected February/March, mild meant anything require hospitalization. really definition ""moderate"" back then. person definitely fall severe category would required administration oxygen. Read article, seeing asymptomatic patients well. Downside they've managed manufacture 23 doses far. 'All need yes no' seems best exposure method evil fucks Im Brazil. hell supposed get back. Yes keep telling people ""I want last person catches Coronavirus."" us talk two sentences? That‚Äôs absurd. Sure hope vaccinate every citizen first ones need done again. Lol. us you. one side also want spread good science people make informed decisions

Yes. exactly Republicans wanted beginning. approach begins ends. want people make decisions. oppose mask mandates completely ok private businesses decided enforce them. Problem they're also ok private businesses deciding ban masks entirely. one reasons states lot vaccine still hand enough cover medical personnel acceptance rate terrible. Well, clear, getting sick disease. It‚Äôs almost certainly 95% sterilizing immunity. Agreed second point makes say that? Seems like ""the elites"" even cavalier breaking restrictions traveling. Yeah, I‚Äôm really defending policy, adding bit info. friend mine actively going out, seeing different groups friends, filming short movies close contact groups mask, works state prison, went Tennessee (worst infection rate) girls trip. Granted, wears mask it, much risk fight situations? posted Instagram story day getting vaccine important fight disease protect others. can‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm burnt out. don‚Äôt see anyone. grocery shop work. That‚Äôs it. need - masks, distancing, washing hands, etc. see little people care appearances sake. I‚Äôm tired invested anymore We've taken ifnwe ignore itndoesnt exist approach  Last heard Biden still wants send kids back school. given indication supports lockdown. It‚Äôs 10 months high alert folks. gets tiring, people moving sanity. still masking/distancing hysteria over. Every man even collectivist societies. easy demonstrate higher risk. 

I seen evidence particularly high risk. 

The benchmark 60 year old conditions currently excluded distribution.  Welcome Wuhan, please step quarantine box 14 days...   

14 days later... Um look leave virus spreading Lmao that's complete bs. country 1.4 billion people one death months? Hahaha stopped following numbers long time ago you. It‚Äôs like method handling ever gonna change.

I feel like boyfriend become straight agoraphobic. go pick groceries (so don‚Äôt even leave car) even mere thought going complete chore anything may put us close vicinity humans making us nervous. really hope recover mentally. :( miss going dates without even thinking dangers. Yikes even insults lame. Zzzzz, goodnight Yep, it‚Äôs Americans. Pay attention Europe anywhere else world! What! That‚Äôs awesome, thank you! time better masks changeable filters used protection others i.e filter inhale exhale. 

The wastage caused disposable masks insane, need look long term sustainable options Covid gonna us time come even covid, we'll like mask wearing social normality prevent spread cold flu viruses general. I'm sorry dude, can't guy tried unironically claim car crashes contagious. That's pidgeon shitting chessboard levels pointless. Exactly. least parent poster doesn‚Äôt look like Professor Honeydew! can't remember cover biology class, make room civil engineering related knowledge. learn one cousins epidemiologist early pandemic, would concerns would reach her. I‚Äôm sorry, don‚Äôt know keep going. burned teaching high needs schools, watching everything that‚Äôs happened healthcare workers worse many magnitudes. Work many angles can. parents got call eye doctor last week saying vaccines done staff going start giving patients. Well, disposable N95s 5 bucks piece people hunting them. 60 dollars get 12 disposable N95s. Yes that's bullshit, well established virus contagious pre-symptomatic period. Also, without precautions, \*very\* contagious fucking position. expect booster recommended next year, don‚Äôt think major adjustments vax need made least three years. Caught late October. Felt like nearing finish line (vaccine) tripped. know gave criticized person many times last 10 months, kinda assumed get it, person would one responsible. Hate say it, America tuned looooong ago. mean, FL governor flat said rules, regulations, mandates, etc work lifted we're own. mentality ""eh screw someone dies gets sick oh well. one tell I'll want let others suffer eventually take vaccine move life"" put us position.

Anyone thought country, egotistical self-centered country world, gonna get grip stuff beginning actually work together stop spread moron. hope took type people died suffer long term effects needlessly. Nicceeee lot times organizations don‚Äôt give answers like you‚Äôre suggesting consequences wrong. Nebulous statements nice catching flak losing trust, second utmost importance. x-ray'ed anyone's lungs times got early last year? This. Honestly 24/7 obsession months end *anything* extremely unhealthy behavior. doesn‚Äôt affect way adults. That‚Äôs demonstrated multiple studies Keep putting words mouth. Got it. nice day. Considering we‚Äôre brink civil war two time boogaloos understand start war other. Id love get vaccine get back semblance normality, unfortunately half countrymen seem decided trump ride die guy reason. Please stop, know talking about. Surgical masks made paper. paper indicates offer AVERAGE 6-fold, best case 55-fold protection. talking ass need stop. Spreading disinformation harmful. I've seen work literally people walking masks without management employees stopping people, people adhere social distancing 6ft, store packed times. don‚Äôt think Chinese hiding much regards Covid initial outbreak, can‚Äôt expect anyone fully trust country says don‚Äôt free press. Well done intentionally missing point - guess proving cars aren‚Äôt actually, literally, contagious prove tires, apples buildings aren‚Äôt contagious either?  Look guy here! rebel! 

But yeah lot people thing. personally see storming bars going huge gatherings yet, certainly enjoy events I've missing while. Actually flying see family first thing list. forget go away. Pfft. I'm feeling same, I'm higher risk, I'll still weigh risks. suspect I'll go one public game night, freak non-mask-wearers getting close, lock back in. 

It's seeing friends again, though. . . . masked. indoor risks still high, particularly other's homes, year isolation time get vaccine. part, damn it. Ok, working permissible long subsistence-level only. Got possibility student loan forgiveness stimulus checks keeps going. Gives sense might something better, secure financially, end long-ass tunnel. bf always says ‚Äúyou cant control others behavior own. Good you, stay safe Instead arguing ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù vaccine first don‚Äôt look bigger picture? people vaccinate better us are. Please this. went Safeway DC around 40 people hanging around Pharmacy. People trying buy groceries making unsafe.  news isn‚Äôt showing streams bodies coming hospitals.

For 9/11 everyone America watched event unfold live national television.

For COVID it‚Äôs old news, showing bodies slowly dying hospitals getting carted morgue truck doesn‚Äôt attract eyes. need attack grammar bruh, understand saying. :) need snarky articles bashing U.S though!! ""we"" care ""we"" care. elites care, themselves. see like class division anything else. now. would horrible PR. like PCR testing, started free availability increases, insurance companies quietly start decreasing portion bill. hear lot shit said white redditors Vietnam, Mongolia, Taiwan, Singapore, etc. coworkers planning trips. One went Mexico Christmas New Year‚Äôs. Upon return, encouraged coworkers go. Another booked Cancun trip April. Meanwhile, husband still hunkering house taking every precaution can. NPR journalists really jobs well here. uncritically believe government's PR. [Mediapart actual journalist enquiry, government plan properly vaccine supply chain logistics. team Sant√© Publique France understaffed. France military logistics specialists choose involve ask McKinsey consulting instead. plan ahead enough, got blindsided problems, shitty PR coverup stupid mean antivaxxers.

Macron act angry wants, he's one charge. parliamentary democracy everything voted thirty times, France. fact is, 50% population wants vaccinated, can't yet another governmental failure. retirement homes many people initially want get vaccinated, seeing fellow residents get shot totally fine made change mind. 

There's little trust vaccine government repeatedly broken trust: first masks useful (because enough them), children contagious (because want close schools). wonder they're viewed suspiciously. Pair little scientific knowledge get wacky conspiracy theories. majority people far deep end. Seeing friends family get vaccinated change minds. got covid March masking. ppl work spread it. mild case went back work 2 weeks. masking avoiding crowds since last March. bubble people comfy with.

Since then, tell everyone burned out. Recently live, obesity qualifies get vaccine. 100 pounds overweight. I'm considered obese. People burned out. Privileged? scrimped saved entire life money. privileged?

I said understand people work. sacrifices made keep society safe. buy annual Apple iPhones, luxury cars, steak crab dinners. clearly nobody cares matter anyone. FECKIN VACCINES?!?!?! Well president tried install whit nationalist fascist dictator. get worry people dying corona. That's luxury america right now. I'd appreciate make us feel bad about. literally everything manage keep democracy alive right still mayor now, means Beijing find anything wrong. worry, soon Uncle Joe heal thoughts prayers (if remember them). understand better treat Covid patients, months ago number would even uglier. ever ‚Äútune in‚Äù? able confirm 2 reinfections

Those 2 classified ""probable"". see anywhere saying confirmed. neither case subject positive test first suspected infection. This. anything it'd much safer people's window outdoor exercise bigger. I'd quite gladly hike 8pm onwards along quiet residential roads get daily exercise without encountering others, instead go others need go work shopping. get trying stop people gathering night can't observed surely better let rule breakers gather outside force inside rest us best keep healthy within rules come (distanced) contact others? aren‚Äôt prioritizing people vaccination? great analogy IMO. Getting around cars necessary people. Temporarily gathering large groups indoors not. people equivalent anti-seat belt anti-airbag also saying nobody dies car accidents it‚Äôs real, don‚Äôt wear seat belt chance dying 1%. Etc etc. cars lots measures place make safer, continually work safety technology. motor safety laws licensing get enforced. COVID yes way live manage risk. large large portion country following steps mitigate risk.  need come terms never seeing family friends huh? mean Brazilian bat one? That‚Äôs true - look state headlines last year. weren‚Äôt intentionally drumming fear, least willingly probing claims. I'm not, read link. fitted mask, slab paper front face. best case 67-75%, next zero protection. anymore. around 2017 became harder understand complex make requirements receive vaccine, bottlenecks introduce system slower rollout becomes. That's lesson we've learned last 3 weeks. need clear, concise, easy-to-understand requirements. Everyone knows age - 65, sign go get it. That's get done quickly efficiently. past days, timeline pushed back substantially. disappointing That's contagious means. Jesus. Every state different aren‚Äôt guaranteed ‚Äúimmune‚Äù point, chance immune. one shot chance immune, it‚Äôs rather low. Two weeks shot two, it‚Äôs good chance.

Headline might well say ‚ÄúRussian roulette proven unsafe 1 6 players die‚Äù. shit gotta say hear read ""This worst virus yet"" feels like literally every week, really feels like loses weight. far know, neither state decided conditions qualify.

That seems unlikely me. probably plans. state submit plan Feds advance distribution. could well both.

The local government definitely downplaying it. central government may also suppressed information knew cat bag, handled competently threw local government bus.

I‚Äôve seen things like happen often corporate environment seems like part human nature point.  privileged enough quit job live savings trying moralize people temerity keep jobs calling voluntary unemployment ""sacrifice"" ü§£ ü§£  Can't die Covid shoot head... always peak, reached yet agree think it‚Äôs 50%. half it‚Äôs hard study long antibodies last you‚Äôre novel pandemic. Even longest could probably say last year hasn‚Äôt longer that. Depends. currently China, no. Check state's plan.

Here's lists page 18 ""high-risk chronic diseases"" move person age 18+ group 1c.

There's many list, I'll note diabetes (as diseases cause immunocompromised HIV). Asthma not. came mention last name... imagine story behind first family member surname.  either response pretty great thinking particular field situation moron narcissist got chance pick surname went broke. Supposedly there‚Äôs significant number Japanese want cancel completely Olympics Japan. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I‚Äôm lucky allowed take even that. Hooray USA. one asking hide. it‚Äôs organized county check county health website/twitter/facebook. godspeed. liked glass article Onion? totally get coming think numbers come back 80%, feel extremely secure getting shot.



Yes, druthers would elect get Pfizer Moderna regimen. However, even 80% efficacy achieved, we'd right expect even higher rate reduction cases ""severe"" symptoms hospitalizations. 



For non-immunocompromised non elderly populations (a cohort I'm part of), I'd consider win vaccine gave assurance worst would come (now less likely) infection mild cold/flu like symptoms. Another idea could kids longer incubations parents quarantine preemptively eliminate kid infecting others?  Christmas. meant local boom, peak. might higher, knows, Christmas I'd imagine would make people pushy gather Thanksgiving. point much emphasis testing often wrong mean anything? Since guidelines assume infected unsure, negative test change behaviour anyway. Yeah hit keep rhythm right Moderna Pfizer

Really? Didn‚Äôt know that, thought always optimistic 90+ surprise everyone mainly suppressed cases. looking pretty bleak that.

Are looking graph? peaked mid april. deaths lagging infection around 21 days cases peaked end march.

End march Swedish said discussing possible scenarios internally.

Did I? Where? actually happened Sweden's lax approach got widely criticised world.

Yeah remember lot UK US articles shitting lax Swedish approach. wonder two countries doing. Florida. 

Florida man, Florida man, 
Florida man hates logic man,
They fight, Florida wins.
Florida man. world. Uk Ireland's higher California's?  Why? still live polio, bubonic plague, TB, name it. Every disease that‚Äôs caused pandemic still around. Small pox exception super human achievement likes we‚Äôve never seen doctor diagnoses long illness? Like 2 months?

In Spain months covered Social security. 

And employer can't fire that, would improcedent firing would give indemnization you.

I think total point animals, human dignity important corporate profits...  worries, clearer. also find annoying articles specific. add City. Yea, mom. Soon enough. information I've seen asthma COVID find correlation severe disease, good news. Diabetes, heart lung issues (including high blood pressure potentially) obesity seem factors severe disease would also interested finding real criteria be. CDC guidance Jan 12 brought problem need figure comorbidities count offer solution. Lost 28 pounds last year. BMI 22. think ok 25 probably not. 25 still packing gut two stone ideal weight twenties. Every pound gone get close true healthy BMI 20/21 feels fantastic. 

Being overfat normalised lost sight healthy feels looks like. looking hope so. I‚Äôm Orange County friends whose parents LA can‚Äôt wait get vaccine. LETS GO Oh NYS sorry. Meanwhile, god help heart attack, stroke, get involved car crash, cancer another fatal disease don‚Äôt know yet, get shot, get shanked, get severe flu/fever, literally emergency hospitals overwhelmed. one virus eliminated human history. Small pox. mean still worry previous pandemic causing viruses. either vaccine them, attain immunity young age mutated less deadly spread less. 

It still serious concern. doesn‚Äôt get refuse leave Quick trip LA, anyone..? Who‚Äôs picture of? They're claim Olympic medals 4,000 variants checked research month ago, I'm sure now. far, two evidence increased transmission one evidence impact antibody performance, 15% that, empirically speaking odds new variant might problem 3/4,000. got email saying hcw's eligible (some previously based level care facility provided). imagine it'll little start rolling 65+ Roll Tide! qPCR sensitivity limited detection. swab perform assay correctly, someone clinically relevant COVID time testing, get positive. test negative, done correctly, means person almost definitely spread COVID time test taken. reason said ""correctly performed"" someone undoubtedly bring imperfect sensitivity tests, say negative rule COVID 100%. that's separate issue related skill testers. I'm talking people *do* tiny amounts COVID epithelium, sensitivity limits qPCR. people unlikely transmit COVID. pretty much rules (fringe) threat article hinted at.

As cycles, I've never done qPCR 35 cycles, felt like overkill. would ROC analysis based following people's clinical outcomes variety cycle conditions, think anyone's done (and data helpful either every test slightly different). think summer, prevalence low, 35-40 cycles excessive achieved worse outcomes 30 cycles. low prevalence, PPV (positive predictive value) low, cause people cast doubt positive result (or falsely believe they've infected act recklessly). Now, produce false positives, prevalence quite high people get positive true positive. still absolute number false positives, small compared true positives, extra sensitivity could, theoretically, pick extra infections. However, even still think 30-35 cycles enough past optimal ROC curve (sensitive specific enough). Gosh, *Unbreakable* underrated hell. 


I really enjoy it. 


Too bad never made sequel. *\[stares directly camera\]*  Germany here... quarantine rule state tossed out... Since stupid quarantine come place less covid... whoops even notice that.

Nor - found pasting reddit search seeing [the thread comment mentioned candidate rather chosen vaccine. thread says vaccinates using part spike immune system recognises, whereas vaccine we're using used whole spike. Wikipedia says reason chosen good safety profile one chosen

*re-commenting previous comment moderated using reddit shortlink needs spend two days ICU bs .0008% remark. I‚Äôm Alberta. Cant comment much outside world, basically go parents, sisters place that‚Äôs it. stores still open. shop Safeway Costco Cabelas anyways. love working home, could go that. necessarily. co-worker elderly family friend contracted Covid son. visited mother NYE, knowing it. diagnosed last week passed away Monday night, that's less two weeks exposure death. bet end point.... Things way better spring Games Summer, missing something though? Yeah us California reason wary ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù nonsense. actually went Florida last month visit friend (stayed home returning negative PCR) pretty refreshing, seems like CA everything revolves around Covid. pretty painful see children Florida going school, participating extracurricular activities sports. Life short relationships makes short time special immeasurable. Cries Saskatchewan :( Infections peaked decreasing across country. CA peaked Dec 22 bet, I'd say might get high much, followed decline. makes think there's going boom? A. Different technology, different manufacturing. turn machine make this, besides Moderna Pfizer haven‚Äôt said would allow manufacturing agreement. B. advantage vaccine Pfizer/Moderna. Near room temp storage, one injection, traditional virus vector vaccine. C. It‚Äôs good options one vaccine unavailable due pre-existing conditions global availability. Except actual data evidence schools aren‚Äôt super spreading events Wait 4th no, since astrazeneca third California following guidelines. people 65. Yes can. healthcare organizations require influenza vaccination every year. get flu shot, job. (if legimate medical reason provide doctor's note exempt) At-will employment ftw.

The covid vaccines authorized emergency use right now, can't legally required. full authorization happens another year two, absolutely required vaccines. negative test, swab picked nose. developed symptoms subsequently positive three days later swab went far enough ‚Äútickle brain‚Äù. arriving? people can't force eat poorly, give cancer. This, right now, bad two killers.

What's point? mechanism increased R values milder symptoms favors decrease virulence.

This like saying ""there mechanism greenhouse gas emissions that's causing global warming"" dumb say air travel necessity? Mythbusters conclusion: Plausible hospitals, medical facilities, etc. absolutely can. I've applied jobs, past, required date TB, polio, MMR vaccines. 


And schools time. can't get past... 3rd grade, think? ...in CA without Hep series. Viruses mutate survive. don‚Äôt mutate deadly host dies, virus can‚Äôt spread (at least comes respiratory/aerosolized viruses). also read virus mutates enough, spike protein eventually becomes pretty useless unable bind ACE2 receptors what‚Äôs causing much damage certain people now. virus might mutate transmit easier keeps mutating, yeah virus alive won‚Äôt able much human body mutates obscurity. much people say it‚Äôs ‚Äúnovel‚Äù virus, it‚Äôs alien weird virus. It‚Äôs behaving pretty standard virus caliber. problem lack education provided public

I disagree part. problem lack education; lack giving damn.

The fact N95 masks provide better filtration cloth masks blasted news, across literally every media source, since least March 2020. Furthermore, take genius understand random piece cloth provide level filtration specialty made mask. People give damn wear what's convenient aesthetically pleasing. So... I've thought lot this. agree MANY members federal government indeed corrupt, hate government. fact, fact say things like 'I fucking hate government' makes actually love America freedoms have. massive corruption problems? Absolutely. president who's criminal? Yep. can't lose hope. 

**'The price apathy towards public affairs ruled evil men.' - Plato** That's another scenario parameter would like able run, federal government taken strong position start. many Americans seem entrenched ""my rights!"" argument know would mattered much.

I'm way absolving Trump's pathetic bunged response, wondering many people still care. know several people say going get vaccine.. let know selfish. Re: cars, saying different enforcing covid mitigation measures, people following either. masks, windows open inside reduce risk, etc. (at least people driving spread right now, behaving risky ways). 

Re: end sight, end sight. would way better treated way treat car safety 10 months ago, didn‚Äôt. now, vaccines rolled out. need hold 3-6 months. It‚Äôs forever. least people avoid large, maskless indoor gatherings. someone said upthread, things would increase chance getting sick possibly lifelong organ damage, now, like getting tackled 1 yard line bc decided run defenders instead around. America nation believes collective action problem arises collective action required, Americans would rather ignore problem entirely instead work together. There's sense community country, we're strangers happen live next other. 

Furthermore, people take lockdown seriously first fatigued. Even cautious people know getting point want lives back. virus mild mean can't fatal people damaged immune systems. Hundreds millions get covid (the estimated 750 million people already gotten october fifth 2020). frail much longer live get severe cases (those pre-existing serious end-stage conditions), barring outliers there's infinitesimal chance healthy young person might develop cytokine storm die. That's exactly common flu works every year, fact flu higher chance killing healthy young people children covid.

It's impossible low IFR virus classified dangerous, viruses spread extemely fast majority people contract mild symptoms none (asymptomatics). That's makes covid-19 highly contagious mild respiratory virus (if highly contagious highly dangerous virus would significantly higher infection fatality rate - IFR).¬† 

Covid ""kill"" people especially harmful virus. Covid ""kills"" much someone weak immune system handle...just like mild virus do. People ""vulnerable"" covid (nonagenarians octogenarians multiple comorbidities) also vulnerable causes natural death one ever claimed want protect from. idea covid anything remotely like death sentence *everyone* elderly also completely false. complete misunderstanding nature virus facts elderly people, reached end natural lifespan die.  championship win dont think alabamas gonna stay stable zone lol. actually makes sense, people risk ones getting first. Death rate drastically goes less reason care keep restrictions Ah, right. Somehow read likely evade. German government: alright Imma shut public transit ban leaving home unless work. bad people going hikes! (Because apparently *that's* virus spreads. offices.)

(Apparently, federal government push next conference next week. states actually write orders, states usually bit sensible. fairly unlikely actually come pass.) similar infection mechanisms flu, coughing, sneezing, airborne etc. 

It's definitively flu. it. work last 2 shutdowns decimated savings, aren‚Äôt paying business owners, bosses, close public safety aren‚Äôt paying us work go get paid. I‚Äôm I‚Äôm careful, much be, outside work attempt minimize risk distancing, sanitizing, staying home mostly. point hearing news it‚Äôs still deadly, multiple new strains vaccine rollout isn‚Äôt working properly, doesn‚Äôt help me. close family 65? chances dying 1%.

Your risk dying covid lower driving get tested. think people eligible vaccines request unblinded drop trial unethical force people stay trial offered vaccine elsewhere someone likely later line health issues, I'm worried speed get shot. can't stand much time stuck inside house time idiots town. I'm sick life worth less effort put mask store.

I wish harm towards anyone hope karma gives deserve whatever may be. considered permanently limiting person's ability spread via respiration? recommend murder, perhaps could super-glue mask face. Yeah, numbers sort lost meaning me. Like course they're going keep going long people keep congregating. 

I'm committed sheltering place indefinitely, whether 100 new cases day 100,000. numbers mean less finding client it, 92 year-old grandfather it. 

PS bill client knowing might die never pay me? burden matters sick accept work may end charitable contribution? I'm going option two RN. üò£ say covid nit it. /s Could next Henrietta Lacks?  show equation please? Anyone notice nobody flu year? covid!  Yeah exactly no. Sure. best have. Given Sweden‚Äôs masking rates, far lowest countries surveyed here, seems quite likely aren‚Äôt changing behavior nearly much 2 people workplace died weekend. .5% staff. even want leave house now. Well obviously genetic predisposition causing Hispanics issues. think u/bobsaget824 means say numbers game- vaccinations uptake distancing masks dropped. Think vaccines bridge- we'll get there. 


u/bobsaget824 correct I'm wrong. Yup. sustain peak attention peak fighting tempo short period time.

That's needed national strategy work flatten curve, decimate it.

I live NM, bordered AZ TX. summer, governor (whom support) kept going hard virus, even though plenty hospital space, things generally normal. kept trying drive far could -- ""background"" level infections state also somewhat elevated due leakage borders TX/AZ, it. summer, middle state great, borders problems.

So, kept going hard it, already hit background levels. Eventually wore out, opened RIGHT fall coming around. Duh. going go bad quickly. went bad, locked heck holidays seem blunted huge rise (yay us), EVERYONE wildly fatigued. look much longer time get everyone comply, tired.

A nationally coordinated 2 week lockdown, followed smaller mitigations help cover things summer, another 2 week lockdown heading fall / holiday season, everyone would much better off. many states/people trying maintain high-alert basically forever. sustainable, need put people high alert, they're fatigued make happen quickly. Daily thread science supporting part sub left... there‚Äôs article saying immune people could actually transmitting virus still called literally data supporting claim. Like 0. I‚Äôll let guys guess turned out. baseless rhetoric literally happening forum itself. yea threw political insults. insult trump time well homie think might referring document states:

""Every person shall right life physical integrity. Freedom person shall inviolable. rights may interfered pursuant law.""

Laws as:

""If events ascertained may lead occurrence transmissible disease, assumed events occurred, responsible authority shall take necessary measures avert dangers individual general public may result therefrom."" (IfSG ¬ß16 (1))

Laymen like might conclude measures comply sections currently realized somewhat hesitantly. would call carelessly taking spreading potentially lethal pathogens minor violation? worked well past god-knows-how-many years people cannot asked change behavior?

I would still say mandatory avoid unnecessary risks protect others yourself. still welcome people think ignore regulations consider affront personal freedom, masculinity like. Still, mean would like see second ""Erm√§chtigungsgesetz"", that's implying. you‚Äôre saying despite well educated aerospace engineers astrophysicists, people Huntsville can‚Äôt handle location space command? Huntsville intellectual hub one key cities helped facilitate moon landing 1969. continues NASA city home Marshall Space Flight Center epicenter space achievements. International Space Station depends Marshall Space Flight Center heavily daily basis.


It‚Äôs like pulled Bessemer grabbed dozen average people asked operate carry administration space headquarters. state also wouldn‚Äôt advisable, would it? Exactly. become clear everyone going live life way want; nothing going change point. people like playing extremely safe, people like try go life safe way, people don‚Äôt give shit anything live like isn‚Äôt even pandemic going on. Eventually vaccinated ones refuse go around coughing others faces driving price Healthcare. end. Best thing I‚Äôve read miss days good ol flu. Begone Covid! vast majority us going wear masks covid, lol. Hell, majority us *want* now, many us cause ""required"" morally complex, psychologically simple, reason this: folks playing ""**communal roulette**"" describe fired shot *or* saw innocent bystander get shot either. *feels* like individual decision (even though obviously isn't). Absolutely international effort :) 

No American centrism, I'm sharing facts find companies' press releases Yeah, making $18/hr working directly coronavirus patients now. least finally able get vaccinated yesterday though. Hope tey find origin get bottom it. what‚Äôs solution young children fall farther farther behind? can‚Äôt keep home point either board not. think convince types. I've seen rampage family extended family - hospitalizing killing others - anti-mask/hoax conspiracy people still unswayed. delusional must wear mask make jokes funeral family member died covid-19? Minnesota Vikings fan it‚Äôs home hard. :( Op utter pocket lint pour lies online...

Imagine using excess deaths parameter...

If stop moving would deaths accidents...

US 300k excess deaths... doesnt mean covid... ALSO MEAN covid...

AAAAND.....there even..those excess...


There 1million dead 1.3million dead... 

What 300k covid... dont see conspiracies saying this.. why? Cos ppl pussies warned would bad period - is. stop - distance, mask, wash! definitely relevant comment. way comment makes sense assume that. Due getting less exercise crossed fit five pounds overweight. Maybe pack another 40 pounds get obese vaccinated. Val Kilmer art, science! could separate administration fee place wanted dick that, would refundable government right now, people concerned giving shots charging English first language understand think talking april 2020, strategy nordic neighbours Sweden much different (none nordics stay home orders mask mandates time, nordics instructed people work home; difference mainly closing non-essential businesses short periods primary schools childcare) definitely larger initial spread northern Sweden specifically Stockholm.

This difference attributed multiple factors, mostly connected larger amount people traveled time - Stockholm's ski holiday week later Denmark's Sk√•ne's (and Sk√•ne also really low spread infection spring, even lower Denmark, even though strategy rest Sweden), Sweden much larger immigrant population, travels home back holidays also works lives vulnerable infection-spread conditions.

In spring, Norway already seeing decline infection numbers introduced restrictions, definitely true Sweden. Norway's residents travel abroad much holiday (compared Sweden) holiday, Norway great ski resorts own, Swedish tourists period preferred ski Alps. recommending quarantine people Italy, however turned (in sequencing) large part original infected people came Sweden brought disease UK Austria, time even considered countries risk. live small town 50k people. Every large store (Home Depot, Walmart, Canadian Tire, Staples, London Drugs, etc.) packs N95 masks sale since least mid summer. cheap, easily accessible everywhere.

Furthermore, I'd still take mask potentially incorrect N95 label, vs. cloth mark. former, least _chance_ getting N95-level filtration, latter know fact don't. Worst case, former mask provides filtration latter.

At point, care health, reason wearing cloth marks. I'm much convinced actual stats rate spread schools closed rate spread without. city/country. i.e, factors same.

I know enough statistics know easy ***lie*** misleading think information article stuff many Americans unaware of. mentions unemployment taxable includes unemployment made pushed new tax bracket first time. It‚Äôs highly unlikely set money aside pay taxes hit hard Uncle Sam didn‚Äôt ‚ÄúA lot people **made lot money unemployment working** CARES Act everything else government did.

They‚Äôre shutting elective surgeries wife‚Äôs hospital asking employees work overtime uncompensated again.

At least she‚Äôs vaccinated, things keep going way going start rejecting patients soon. (NC)

Even folks start dying homes I‚Äôm afraid things won‚Äôt change. would they? People don‚Äôt seem care. think call ""Florida"" days... I'm glad least someone else knows this. someone who's selling astm level 3 masks vendor since start infuriating lack steps government taken educate people important wear masks like ones we're selling. 

The amount people would walk store asking clear masks masks holes/vents them. give half population Yeha im pretty well it.  ""we"" morons. posted simple understand short article, lot people still comparing flu. Maybe helps argue talk family, friends colleagues. unintentionally illuminating comment. others said, deeply entrenched atotmised selfishness even know revealing. fucking hate government, proven completely incompetent. actually solution problem (vaccines) it‚Äôs #1 priority.

Just bunch corrupt fucks probably don‚Äôt want give power high imposing restrictions. point know don‚Äôt work, look New York California. Shit works spread. Seems help decrease mortality rates: Compare Canada Sweden.

Sweden 954 deaths per million Covid-19, lightest changes behavior. Canada 453 Covid-19 deaths per million, quite authoritarian response. looks like Canada‚Äôs response saved lives right? half Covid-19 deaths per capita Sweden.

Until look excess death percentages overall.

Sweden 5.9 percent excess deaths causes including Covid. Canada 9.33 percent excess deaths causes.

So Sweden significantly better job keeping citizens safe, despite almost twice rate Covid-19 deaths per capita.

That significant adverse effects be. First all, virus isn‚Äôt way die.

nice way start something completely irrelevant, even say. Nearly everything 100% doesn‚Äôt mix! I'm boat. I've teaching interesting remote learning become sort normal. stopped think I'm it, become really depressed. rock roll get it, actually bad day provide new N95 daily every family member free then... even still headlines? seen genuine one since Spring pandemic nutjob political conspiracies, really question future!! Taxes income always thing. deductions exemptions. addl $600 received Congress taxed, UI. Thanks this. wouldn‚Äôt allowed gather evidence first place? telling  comment pretty much nails it, it‚Äôs really sad got numb 4,000 daily deaths, staggering... Dude lol reason think can‚Äôt transmit immune, can‚Äôt say without data. argument data. Science serious shit.  omg, sorry hear go :( How‚Äôd get vaccinated list stats excess death stats Covid-19 stats? Right..and minimum, 15 days. took 5-7 days days get test back. quarantined 10-14 days receipt positive test, 15-21 days post test days antibody test. Ah yes, people = cases. nothing could done stop spread magically transmitted virus. one lockdown skeptics? can‚Äôt impose mandate, don‚Äôt provide N95 masks.  Sure ;-) news tries make look progressively worse. People tuned out, news gonna try word differently, get clicks views. \[Thoughts reading article\]:

Probably helps territory around size New Jersey, similar sized population concentrated strip (along coast Ashkelon north Haifa, east Jerusalem) roughly size Rhode island, always mobilized military, well planned public health system every population center optimized war-time levels casualties, probably helps rapid roll-out distribution vaccine became available.

\[After reading article\]

Pretty much above... believe FDBT Texas also making Tonix‚Äôs horsepox COVID vaccine. haven‚Äôt heard anything Tonix‚Äôs vaccine assume entering phase FDBT focusing energy, especially 8x2000L expansion Texas, Novavax‚Äôs vaccine closer approval. Yeah probably end **pandemic** lead eradication COVID completely. thing circulate like flu / common cold forever, (hopefully) small rates enough people get vaccinated.  Thanks continuing wear mask. reports people getting again. Also, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough research show even you‚Äôve wouldn‚Äôt get sick, couldn‚Äôt still carrier spread it. 100% this. It‚Äôs already exhausting arguing overly worrying it.  Interesting ""it's taking long"" effectively ""reasoning"" (excuse) people using en masse finally start wriggling lockdown precautions.. Despite fact many complaining ""sick"" lockdowns, also ones went way try ""shame"" people anti lockdown.. ""2 years long"" might make much sense you, ""2 months long"" made someone financially emotionally destitute. LOL 2 dose phase 3  live Bay Area, better still pretty bad. go groceries take walks. groceries get super early go store it‚Äôs crowded bunch people breathing everything. can‚Äôt wrap head around people throw caution wind go socialize. Could Dodgers fans close Petco Park? point people care continue follow necessary guidelines people don't, won't.

We've got enough problems politics. Get people roll vaccine properly. I'm 2 shot trial, second one next week.

On first visit took blood pressure, BMI (the usual etc). Took blood, gave covid test. Whole thing took 90 mins so.

Not sure find placebo group not, whole trial set last 2 years guess then. fair, rapidly developing field probably waiting peer reviewed evidence fully throw support masks. New evidence coming day day basis understanding virus becoming clearer. credit, human motivations beliefs. Trust science scientists, necessarily ignore say. Honestly...zombies might improvement whatever last year been.

Just sayin agree, also really need average 1.3m initiations day completely end six months. I've since summer. riots broke (I'm democrat condone violence), cops started abusing peaceful protesters (what actual fuck) south started booming cases, like ""well, hope spirit broken. Everyone stupid worrying like 5 people that's it. can't control stupidity. wear mask stay fuck away everyone. got first vaccine shot last night! go #2 Feb 3.

That's get zombies people get here? everyone social distancing, mask wearing, taking precautions, yet virus still raging, things fucking daily life slowing virus appreciable way point view?

Ok made far clicked DV moved on, hopefully understand average person might think. pandemic complex long-term problem people cannot stay high alert indefinitely. hard stay vigilant something like last year completely changed life seen nothing negative personal life news. answers, understand people lax precautions... open new one things they've decades..

Yeah.. no!

You want data fit opinion! That's true. people might that, every country, people sticking lockdown. anything, I'm seeing lots people wearing masks outside ever before, even they're alone. ramping vaccination programme people willing lockdown try stick rules help get us ASAP left apartment month. depression really bad right now, barely function. drove around two towns yesterday Oklahoma. one wearing mask. stayed truck whole time. saw one lady without mask walking directly busy pharmacy mother walking grocery store toddler hand infant carry-cradle.  faith hope everything gone.

Masks: massive contingent anti-maskers still cite early arguments masks. best way protect HCWs limit spread community.

PCR tests: cranked cycles achieve max sensitivity, lost specificity. tons people got false positive test walking around like they're immune.

Vaccines: Telling people still socially distance getting vaccine pissed people made many question point even was, even though probability reduces transmission significantly, even perfectly.

Have good day man! sitting unused thought entire supply planned used?

My specific complaint ""planned used"" different ""used."" Every vaccine used (potentially) life saved. Again, need getting shots arms. way vaccinate someone today, use vaccine that, hold someone future.

We expand priority groups use shots immediately. shots ever sitting unused, waiting injected, millions ready willing get shot today.

States also need looking ahead vaccines arrive. U.S. least 400 million doses end July. administer them, need vaccinating something like 2-3 million people day. doses hand, excuses. doses need administer them, yet seems like states going totally unprepared actually that. brought two entirely seperate things.

Thanks letting know struck wrong post instead hammering downvote.  smokers deserve contract spread die Rona?

No, deserve extra priority non-smokers make shitty life choices. smooth brained take, we're treating children acute danger one advocating do. However difference pandemic car crash one two contagious. survive car crash pass someone else. appear Several laboratory studies already shown surgical home-made masks somewhat (but incompletely) effective limiting exhaled particles, protecting wearers inhaling particles others. Surgical masks contain, therefore reduce, dissemination viruses shed infected wearer 3-4-fold (i.e. ‚àº67-75%), even 100% case seasonal coronaviruses.34,51 infectious person wears mask face covering, size exhaled plume also reduced also helps reduce risk exposure nearby.

A surgical mask purely ""spit catcher"" designed protect patient surgery. provide ZERO protection infected person fit face massive holes. 

Air (like gases fluids) always travel path least resistance. Every time inhale exhale, air pass though mask, travels around it. begs question, remove people positive COVID test positive antibody test vaccine waitlist? Especially, young people healthcare Furthermore understanding total US deaths decreased YOY.

What? saying think fewer Americans died 2020 2019? one side also want spread good science people make informed decisions, fund programs help struggling financially right now, fund efforts ramp completely failed vaccine roll Republican administration treated us to? Seriously, take look time seriously use phrase ""both sides,"" often ignoring pretty important differences (not wish Dems progressive courageous many ways) [Professor Susan Hopkins, Senior Medical Advisor Public Health England SIREN study lead study given us clearest picture date nature antibody protection COVID-19 critical people misunderstand early know virus, developed antibodies, protected reinfection, total yet know long protection lasts. **Crucially, believe people may still able pass virus on.** Don‚Äôt forget get two doses it‚Äôs another 14days second dose full immunity. There‚Äôs also evidence yet you‚Äôre immune doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt still pass along smokers deserve contract spread die Rona? nobody quit smoking years anymore? Idk understand sentiment logical extension would denying obese, type 2, alcoholics, etc vaccine well I‚Äôm fine wearing masks til fall yeah goalposts moving back even normal people gonna stop caring

it‚Äôs dumbasses faults taking virus seriously ruining everyone else beginning pandemic ofc ppl gonna get tired say continuously move finish line backwards seems self-evident. However, can‚Äôt draw meaningful conclusions small sample size.

But Pfizer covered 100% costs front 

This addition funding Pfizer provided since 2018 develop vaccines Cool, one advantages duckbill makes glasses fogging less likely, right? That‚Äôs lot words say agree me. end day fed send shots, it‚Äôs states figure jab people arm. Article seems super misleading then. Smokers fuck lungs: blood vessels shot too. COVID attacks blood vessels anything, I‚Äôd guess that‚Äôs puts higher risk. This! tell fellow nursing student virus causing people loose limbs causing renal failure absolutely shocked You‚Äôre also toxic tbh - one case enough justify treating children acute danger, we‚Äôd naturally stop letting play outdoors ride cars.

Don‚Äôt need talk smoking Covid I‚Äôm aware, trying quit, severe anxiety patient here. awaiting dispensary edibles ready weekend case positive need quit cold turkey, don‚Äôt want mess test results. anxious smoke would help, bored looking high. 10 days (little longer)

So like 11 days? Simpler - ad impressions. Scared intrigued users engage = impressions = better bottom line. Also eating healthy, exercising regularly, spending time outdoors, vitamins great preventative maintenance illness need lockdown. I‚Äôm sick need wear mask? People don‚Äôt want eat healthy don‚Äôt want exercise. That‚Äôs much cancer heart disease. They‚Äôd rather take pill continue lifestyle.

9/11 affected half million people - worked area course helped victims. plausible mechanism two mRNA vaccines cause long-term complications. They've studied extensively already tested tens thousands volunteers months. already good understanding underlying cellular processes involved protein synthesis. risk serious issues vaccine like astronomically small compared risks associated covid indefensible anyone who's even slightly informed would willing make tradeoff. Yep.

Yes. imagine scenario isn‚Äôt unique. Women likely bearing brunt mental health stress virus. I'd surprised even one countries thrown money finding vaccine, generosity makes financial sense. Many listed countries even developed own.

Thx must rest world cake walk right People don‚Äôt care. tell licking boots beneficial mental health based ‚Äúpeer reviewed‚Äù study they‚Äôll go along it. No. family (high risk) taken care health best can, prioritized vaccine. dont see moral someone destroyed health considered important here. themselves. called Gattaca? Well sucks spread little faster, spreads way faster. Spread exponential, 50% increase transmittability easily mean 600% increase deaths within month. 

With vaccinations 3%(?) US, might help soon enough. hope does, really do, I'm surely pessimistic guys. democrat states follow Joe Biddens policy republican one's don't. quickly (less month) become apparent policy works.

With caveat states low population density use different policy covid19 states high population density. correct, article poor job making distinction. 

However [this mentions counties similar issues. estimated 50% refused Riverside County, example, LA appears reflect larger trend. terms executive order? Yeah, CCP year scrub evidence. word people plural. people is. ""People dying"". Like video Egypt, multiple larger facilities. Really brings home many cannot survive virus without professional medical care intubation risky business. Az joins chat - it‚Äôs reefer trucks hospital parking lot - no, apparently doesn‚Äôt convince some... Although study could provide data possible protection beyond five months, Prof Hopkins optimistic would last ‚Äúmuch longer months people speculating about‚Äù early stages pandemic last year.

Obviously globalism makes spread easier, see pandemic like Still, around third 14 million people living Jordan River Mediterranean Sea included vaccination campaign. Israel distributed vaccines Jewish settlers West Bank, Palestinians cramped, impoverished Gaza Strip. waiting see anti-vax'ers explode say state making virtually impossible still access, make appointment providers give vaccine seniors. contact health officials providers either direct website, send boilerplate email say provider giving seniors general public vaccine awhile.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Realizing can't eradicated change behaviors. virus fades dozen cases day social distancing end. ""forgotten"" ""thinks invincible""? even Cuomo saying, ""We can't shut indefinitely. Life go COVID eradicated,"" think goes show Fauci touch. Age 65+ anyone 18+ underlying conditions...but proof condition required understand things like smoking included list. everyone started reserving appts. Milsurp gas masks. 

You won't. reported deaths. real number may even higher. highest death count single day 118 Dec 17, day reported count 91, even though number included large backlog deaths past 30 days. 5.3% eligible people vaccinated  astounding achievement. beginning pandemic, conventional wisdom would take years develop vaccine. vaccines administered require special logistics deliver store. yet 11 million doses already given, states using allocations (considering required second doses reserved), first shots nearly 5 percent American adults. that's nation pandemic peak, constitutional crisis, rollout starting holidays, nothing ever gets done. 

Pardon seeing bright side, I'm awe. Except right time urgently need flatten curve -- ever -- time everyone shrugging shoulders tapping out. time get turned away full hospitals. Oh sure did. chose ignore them, painted everyone pointing selfish clueless. naahhhhhhhhh really know first part. North Dakota particular one comprehensive testing programs US probably much better capture rate fall rest country, actually know close achieving herd immunity. states saw numbers jump back holidays despite substantial amount natural immunity already had. 

in case, vaccinating 5% population area R pretty close 1 probably enough bring back 1 therefore make dent. RtLive tracker 20 states 1 compared six states ten days ago. average 2019 2 9/11‚Äôs death everyday US. don‚Äôt know people think contextualizing like gonna change anyone‚Äôs mind.  say article. would asymptomatic person seeing trauma surgeon? Places handled appropriately aggressively done significantly better. Look death rates per million 

Check South Korea, death per million rate 23.11. United States 1,166 deaths per million. 

You might say fair populations different. death rate per ***HUNDRED THOUSAND*** US states here:  Let's take California, 40 million population S. Korea 50 million population--similar enough populations. Korea, 23.11 per million zero deaths per million past 7 days. California, 79 per hundred thousand == 790 per million. similar enough population comparison, California 34 times worse death rate.

Korea much faster concerted response cases rose. unified rhetoric social distancing adhering mask wearing. even significant draconian shut-downs. wide-scale testing tracking/tracing much earlier allowed much faster isolation cases. Seriousness virus communicated quickly openly. talk covid-19 worse seasonal flu worried about. politicize polarize public. shitcan entire pandemic response strategy. regional national politicians saying people go families holidays instead responsible things reduce transmission.

Your comment sounds ignorant. probably combination vaccines natural immunity there. Obviously latter former, 3%ish vaccine (since they're like 5.6% vaccinated now, half probably last week) little helpful well. funny studies right show genes may correlated higher rates addiction. 

I know mean - fatal covid comorbidities caused lifestyle choices. seems people want shit addicts. Oklahoma, please send common sense logic leaders. seriously use some. SinoVac shown 50% effective preventing symptoms? think halts progression serious complications, many could still wind needing lower levels care, intensive ICU critical care. Also Northern regions China still poor working class may lack urgent care community clinics abundant modernized areas like Shanghai Guangdong. implementing lock downs never considered ramifications small businesses closing mental health problems. Yes, privilege. people work asses entire lives still can't save money retire buy house. fact even ability privilege.

There nothing wrong privileged need seen is.

Also ten months total clusterfuck government response end sight, ask people sacrifice long unreasonable. one would hope so. i'd curious fast could produce get injected. i've seen efficacies 50-80% surely would help stem tide whatever outbreak building hospital for. Same.  like price gas. stopped paying attention years ago. There's nothing need need it. talk refusing business people without vaccine whatnot presumably everyone want unblinded still board airplanes proving real vaccination. yet categories overlapping. contrary, thankful been. glad get go gym, grocery stores shops want, etc. wear masks. opinion, best response could hoped can‚Äôt years supremely lucky -- I've working remotely 11 years partner's school went virtual learning March. basically go months without seeing anyone. entry point monthly grocery run. Plus, british strain (that's probably french given early 2nd wave, tho I'm speculating, take seriously) probably already main one (and time started worrying really) outside extremely elderly obese 99% us fine don‚Äôt walk pile dead bodies get mail agree sentiment. feel bad people damn near year help mitigate spread selfish assholes nothing help perpetuate problem. people supposed wanted get back normal quickly possible everyone group morons basically said ""fuck everyone else, I'm me."" damn shame people can't see self sacrifice would've helped everyone. don‚Äôt necessarily disagree said seems miss point bit. You‚Äôre willing risk life less shitty year two, you‚Äôre life probably isn‚Äôt one risk. Modern life also allows lot comforts entertainment didn‚Äôt exist 100 years ago. 

QoL could greatly affected long term covid symptoms/side effects considered. headline suggests lung damage true covid patients. read article, lungs referring examined trauma surgeon. reached point trauma surgeon looking xrays, represent covid patients. got cut social media/news moved China 2016. Realized much happier/satisfied decided stay permanently came back home. Honestly stay reddit too. Sadly point time ignorance bliss. already concluded ""investigations"" left? oh that's interesting, i've looking something like that. thanks  20%. leaves 80% spread it. one worst case scenarios airborne virus.  Yep. Biden going bring Eminem White House run country. He'll release new album 2021 labeled ""Marshall Law.""  1 lady died workplace means 4% since 25 staff  Thanks clarifying that. 

I know wear mask getting vaccine don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre still carriers, anyone know research factor ie: still carriers Yes, one dose offset symptoms, depends many days first dose, actually, many countries delaying second dose get people vaccinated, believe protection 1 dose 60% that, bought time doctors still really good idea treat people this. ended hospital would increased chance survival later (assuming area overrun hospitals right now).  last time drove exactly speed limit highway? get lot dirty looks honking horns drivers went around you? Well definitely. individual case, one one must. 22nd century belong developed nation/bloc largest population. So, probably China (given population plateau soon), likely nation India united African union. 

But none us live see day. Fun fact. One causes COPD gardening.  here, take seriously, spend stress focusing people doing? Uuuuuuu777...... wooooooow.... adverse effects o.O woooow..

We better stop locking asap :O aero20 discounts $30

Still cheap $4 per. Honestly sounds like it‚Äôs you‚Äôre stressing worry. Schedule test know one way other. second paragraph, question doctor. Nobody Reddit qualified give definitive answers comes health situation.  gathering large groups indoors not. 

I disagree, increasing number people. gathering two weeks three weeks one thing, happy shelter place first. gathering indefinite period end sight unrealistic, even going increase chance dying. cars lots measures place make safer, continually work safety technology. motor safety laws licensing get enforced. 

Exactly point, used car driving analogy. cost-benefit analysis mitigation measure, allows weigh risk drawbacks mitigation measure. could prevent lot deaths injuries requiring cars come safety features, safety features much impact total cost car, so. could also prevent lot deaths injuries reducing speeds highways 20 miles hour, causes problems solves, don't. anywhere data available total death rate 1000 people country wise, whole 2020, damage analyzed. mean new year come country kind data. Gotta enough produced make mandatory Fair enough - think overall point stands. fraction 44 almost certainly going actually reinfected, hopefully large portion. 83% floor. get lung damage symptom, scare tactic click bait?

Come fuck on... think understand permanent lung damage means individual nation could write did. test date got test back somewhere 5-7 days, well 2 weeks time antibody test. 

More importantly, wasn‚Äôt tested thought exposed, change behavior week. one with, within 6 feet, unmasked, inside, hours time got it. 

These test fallible.  we‚Äôre tuning out, still can‚Äôt go bars, clubs concerts?  UK ""peeing lanes"". Well, R values old strain 0.92 (taken article), new strain 1.45 60% cases England moment new strain overall cases still rising. However available data suggests that‚Äôs case. 

When R value from? suspect latest lockdown it. R value country wasn‚Äôt lockdown don‚Äôt think say would still high current restrictions aren‚Äôt enough.

So point still evidence greater restrictions started weeks ago sufficient originally stated. Lol. resources get doses arms utilizing them. resulting people dying delaying return normal. Lol.  94% effective That's hate media twists everything make fear porn. According @COVID19Tracking twitter account, 7-day average hospitalizations country went yesterday first time since September. Now, account mention found remarkable, seems like extremely good news! may one-day aberration it'll go back today, signal we're getting near peak hospitalizations since cases really increasing current level.  cant survive going mail. think one vaccines 5 hours refrigeration. forget damage heart well: 
 Puntmann expert heart imaging University Hospital Frankfurt Germany. team researchers recently scanned hearts 100 patients recently recovered COVID-19, including 18 asymptomatic. found 78 signs heart damage 
Source: Yes, tells people going. tell anything behaving there.

It's useful complete picture. parties make political hay sun shines.

They'll walk away $$$$$ mess.  So, still argument? risk sounding macabre would like replay scenario covid far deadly. think many people hear constant news stories cases see co-workers, friends family get time even show symptoms. think created mentality big deal. Still huh? Glad you‚Äôre part actually facing pandemic head Iirc mild means didnt wind hospital, allegedly defined way medical. Right? else do? There's nothing place support us, trying die. seeing this?

Everything I‚Äôve seen either says don‚Äôt know anything may evade treatments vaccines. Umm probably still know lot people COVID. die. 1900, say, ""I know bunch people COVID."" I'd say, ""Yeah cousin sick flu last week he's fine now."" think Americans simply care people. affect personally, literally care. American culture personal success material wealth, self others. Community best church centred thing, even soothing one's personal guilt opposed actually caring people. There's tiers it. China big bad can't anything right. rest Asia looked much, mostly people really know much Asia. Japan South Korea generally praised. 

But scary thing Asian nations would recieve much circlejerk hate actually America's way, IMHO. use think case, recent years made seem so. relative lack hate nations nations unheard anything else. Death loved one change view. know people lost loved one Covid say ""they would've died anyway. died Covid."" pandemic made fearful future America. 9/11 every single day due average person country‚Äôs complete apathy towards fellow citizens. world mostly okay, it‚Äôs political problems - it‚Äôs nearly everyone given simple actions could take help neighbors die. ""A government spokesman said week ‚Äúexchange views‚Äù Chinese scientists gave indication whether would allowed gather evidence"".

If allowed gather evidence what's point??? I've personally managed least get three people work seriously consider getting vaccine can. Going stance ""it sounds dangerous"" ""hmmm.....you know, look getting it"" quite improvement. probably helps point wife's experience vaccine. really like America centrism - international effort wouldn‚Äôt stand right without cooperation!

With vaccine!

Especially since Pfizer producing much vaccine, Biontech producing Germany Turkey talking yesterday lol yes, screenshots saved somewhere. Honest question. everyone trip got vaccinated, would change mind? positivity rates still 10%? 5%? know longer ""reckless""?

This I've struggling with. obviously reckless something like right now, unvaccinated. get vaccine, picture get lot muddier. Things **as good possibly be** one shot arm, personally (I know community spread contributes control that).

Many us procrastinating thinking tough choices. me, I've decided get vaccine fly cross country go see family. year, point, need draw line sand know I've crossed it. Satan truth, hail Satan Good I‚Äôm glad know that. mostly spread droplets except specific procedures cause aersolize Even beyond this, consider people driving tired, looking phones/fucking radios moving, medication, drinking etc.

It really bizarre new phenomenon people prioritize routines safety others. Literally everything said true correct. want go road then?

Clothing stores grocery stores essential human survival either. hunt gather make clothes animal skin. Slightly misleading headline.

(It still sucks - average person automatically know works one help work out.) covid, still getting vaccine. still carry virus spread even natural antibodies sick. Hopefully vaccine stop asymptomatic carrier virus like research suggested. wear mask limit social interactions much possible, however really getting tired really hoping time next year. Also, really surprised people tired this? good tsar bad boyars eh agree done. mean, like vaccinate kids Garcetti simultaneously reporting increasing numbers deaths hospitalizations Los Angeles, pushing ""safely"" reopen schools. 

Apparently, according talk last night, Los Angeles better.

Suddenly miraculously. 

So ridiculous. Yeah, like 2 weeks. Yeah kinda hard pay attention civil war going on. Omg still this??? wish could live non mask island look hospitalizations already made rather severe selection. Masters manipulation nice üòÇüíØüëåüèª  seeing research brought going lockdown government using time expand increase healthcare resources future surges. 

The army could build makeshift hospitals scratch times like nothing hoping population comply disease go away. think case people. virus affected friend friend isn‚Äôt taken seriously be. won‚Äôt people directly affected virus taken seriously precautions taken. sight, mind. Agree, wholeheartedly, work librarian town numbers skyrocketed holidays. closed week deemed essential enough phone calls mayor communist. 

The city office open, banks utilities drive-through even doctor's offices shutting tele-visits only. gas stations, grocery stores, library open. Why? essential one caring? Like you, taken leave absence get paid bills.

It‚Äôs stupidity white people go church, cultural otherwise peak white arrogance assuming every chinese person lying lmao. saying go get infected.

What mean, though, probably tell people infected, especially recently, wait vaccine available. would provide protection faster telling everyone, infected not, get priority group. paywall almost like important ""pay attention"" actually something. Let‚Äôs see stance weeks 18 till 6 curfews ethical thing yeah, theory would better know analyze long term consequences.

On hand, people want need vaccinated, need point. thought US democracy co-operative thing, covert civil war

Yeah, changed back. I'm digging it. seems like it'll prepare beat get it, though accountability, Americans entirely conditioned media narratives. blatantly obvious government fucked PPE, fucked testing, went horseshit ""flattening curve"" strategy going fuck vaccines well. Ah didn‚Äôt know - sorry. 

I‚Äôm Europe we‚Äôre absolutely supply constrained moment... something pragmatic always doesn‚Äôt mean right thing do. Again, understand idea would entertained. also fucking furious think it‚Äôs disgusting frankly, want go pragmatism, people we‚Äôre saving going burden medical system future smoking catches them.  2 weeks steep increase, one day decrease, Iowas ""governer"" starts easing restrictions worked corrections beginning pandemic. told wore masks would ‚Äúfreak inmates‚Äù didn‚Äôt masks time, told wear them. said reported authorities lock dangerous behavior that's tantamount attempted manslaughter least. meantime, everyone stop paying harm even kill people. like time house burned down, fire department showed year later investigate.

""We can't find evidence cause fire. even fire. Everything fine here!"", said. Right, think demand overestimated tbh. I‚Äôll surprised 200mil people willing get vaccine. lot young previously infected people natural immunity pass. Fingers crossed you‚Äôre right. Sorry forgot it‚Äôs literally George Orwell‚Äôs 1984 they‚Äôve got gun friends heads every time talk Natural selection ""Now basketball season begun, limits fans, masks social distancing. There‚Äôs dance team; cheering, jeering student sections.
‚ÄúIt really takes away environment student extracurricular activities,‚Äù said activities director Todd Coy, who‚Äôs served position 25 years""

Wow Todd, things must hard you. I'm really sure doctors dealing dying covid patients Iowa see perspective matter. Death natural part life. Nothing better people can't anything panic. Absolutely not. case restrictions would lifted spring healthcare acceptable limits work nursing home. Yep. anecdotal means nothing macro-severity situation, know least 40 people one hospitalized... day fine. haven‚Äôt seen family year dozen friends huge weddings traveled planes, cruises etc. 

I live notoriously dumb southern state worrying everyone around really damaging mental health. pretty much YOLO everyone else around days, masks. lost (good) job recently really monitor emotions stuff prevent depression creeping in. means every store, every train, every anything people need crowded. one get groceries past 6 pm, example, means people need store slim hours working out. US would soon politician's left, jail. 

H'm see advantage plan :D Yeah - I'd still say summer-travel Europe up-in-the-air. 

We fully refundable trip booked mid-June, yet booked anything that's 100% refundable, since I'd say right now, coin-flip. 15 days. 4chan copypasta brazilian variants anything worry already exposed National Institute Infectious Diseases (NIID) said currently ‚Äúno proof showing new variant found Brazil high German partner BioNTech said last week vaccine worked N501Y mutation found British Brazilian variants. realized year since heard virus. Wonder happened? Trump dismantling government agency responsible handling this. withheld aid start contract bidding wars. medical supplies... thanks Jared Kushner. republican government doesn‚Äôt care, won‚Äôt actual leader (hoping) wants handle situation. Republican states skewing covid numbers resisting lockdowns get medical funding Trump wouldn‚Äôt supply locked ‚Äúkeep economy open‚Äù. Sending students school Betsy Devos. one situations exacerbated trumps cabinet. fucked us. knew it. Wake fuck up. I‚Äôm pissed every fucking day too. 385k Americans dead. vaccines work. issues. article:

Preliminary evidence also suggests variant unlikely evade immune responses generated vaccines previous COVID-19 infection. What? lower-risk seniors vaccinated life go back normal. noted Moderna vaccine doesn‚Äôt require special transportation, stored regular refrigerator 30 days. Pfizer vaccine requires ultra cold storage.

The reason Moderna spent past decade working mRNA increasing stability lipid casing keeps degrading. [Production looks like. Bahahah, good luck guy. -a begrudged Vikings fan Death causes? Covid? Newton? Believe me, plan hanging friends things clear up. I've really hung friends once, outside distancing, since last March. However, still plan cautious since know still spread virus even vaccine prevent illness. consider people can't get vaccine yet immunocompromised children. plan going back 100% normal life vaccinated still caution had, mind hanging vaccinated friends. seems like reasonable stance me. Like someone else said, though, think they're putting pragmatism fairness; goal reduce hospital / ICU admission. party pivot quickly instantly change talking points. Followers proceed whatever direction told march blame Obama pandemic. word looking regarding populace is: Troglodyte Ah gotcha. Makes sense. Im immune contagious I‚Äôm living life normally, simple that. don‚Äôt need herd immunity people start living normally they‚Äôre spreading. least see zombies coming... you‚Äôd rather quickly, risk giving limited vaccines people already antibodies? others go without?

YES DEFINITELY. California currently stockpiling vaccines faster administering them. According Bloomberg tracker they've gone 2.3 mil available doses 3.4 mil past week; total number doses administered since started less million. 

The constraint supply, constraint bureaucracy resources distribute vaccines. Trying hard prioritize way harm good. restrictions designed overwhelm health care system way herd immunity. interesting!

The comments reaction vaccine place. Thanks. Yeah never mind risk infecting others, mind boggling little people care health. many horror stories read realize virus big deal? get it. That's failure failed hard way success.

1/3 county infected means 1/3 county immune disease. vaccinations ramp up, well way herd immunity soon. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ü§£ agree it‚Äôs government....it never makes sense. article say percentage 1/3 likely infected *now* must huge.

How reduce transmission level hospitals keep without restrictions? think can, there's appetite restrictions. 

People say we've ""locked down"" since March true. significant restrictions, yes, nearly everything open reduced capacity. probably helps reduce infections customers, workplace spread still huge still coworkers.

We probably need 2 week real shutdown bend curve, happen, accepted deaths.

And vaccinations going fast LA county, although better neighboring counties cities health departments. Ofcourse one replying lol.. ‚Äúwe die!‚Äù odd coincidence that's exactly UK planning high infection rate forced change mind. post title makes sound like something wrong unexpected happened...

The article simply stated six people vaccinated allergic reactions, average, delayed things day. go anaphylaxis anything life-threatening.

An allergic reaction possible vaccination. Lucky Number Slevin, Looper, Moonrise Kingdom. 3 movies past decade one mentioned. really lot good movies. I'm thankful time I'm prison. think I'd survive there. several friends served multiple years prison (one 10 yrs think) I've heard horror stories. it. even mean ""Potential infection"". Meaning know got reinfected, reinfections symptoms. PCR test might picked debris virus even false positives. Yes. include data, parts support opinion, support opinion. probably are. It‚Äôs hard know sure you‚Äôre buying.  West Virginia seems something right.

The idea state (WA) sitting hundreds thousands doses reason fills rage. still much care. live medically fragile people get luxury pretending like there's pandemic going on. 
I fed up, though. Mostly people businesses care. I'm *especially* tired hearing ""if feel safe, go out!"" be: ""don't want wear mask? go out!"" 
Though record, mostly go risky. Well, seem same. Brain dead could possibly infect get teeth you.  think good analogy I‚Äôm afraid use deniers they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right! someone covid fell cliff would still counted covid death! numbers soooo inflated!‚Äù dozen deaths miscounted spring people died accidents homicides covid, despite mistake caught long removed dataset. incredibly frustrating. clinical trials specific regimen followed. They're talking rear end. influencing factors.

Sweden seems quite good year started without Corona slightly lower access mortality - Canada opposite around. 

If look Waves Pandemic it‚Äôs bold statement say Canada worse Sweden. factor death per capita it‚Äôs bold anymore. Imagine thinking addicts deserve treated better people made better life choices 'lmao'. context giving ability live normally back people choose smoke literally months choose I‚Äôm really seeing point. personally think drugs legalized. also think giving smokers priority access vaccine disgusting. Consider redo math don‚Äôt understand city getting harshly prosecuted indoor dining compared rest state. live Long Island, say definitely don‚Äôt deserve indoor dining, due sheer case numbers stupidity people live here. friends servers bartenders restaurants LI, amount people won‚Äôt comply mask wearing restaurants absurd. remember, got taken away, indoor dining boroughs going pretty well. 

Feels like point they‚Äôre willing let service industry die NYC scapegoat show they‚Äôre ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù stop spread. Yeah like FB memes really annoying lately. love interacting people reading articles pages like, there's always moron comments spouting conspiracy BS frustrating give up. 

I deactivated weeks summer nice. enjoy taking pics GF posting show off. sisters GF use FB heavily share memes shit fun past time me. 

I gotta stay comment sections easier said done. awfully accurate. Hope he‚Äôs wrong Brazilian bat cocktail IFR, although point time think fatality rate overestimated anyway  play Enver Hoxha. I'm Albanian. percentage population ten countries? 3 weeks minimum vaccines, longer may ideal.   Drain !!! Strap up!! get first dose vaccine 6 days. I‚Äôm going keep I‚Äôve I‚Äôm second. Beyond that, everyone sick tired thinking worrying this. majority family followed guidelines. mom extremely paranoid entire time followed many guidelines possible. caught right Christmas one else family yet. Almost makes feel like 9 months stress totally unnecessary. No, people paid labor. hard concept. What's sad expecting people administer vaccines make nothing CEOs companies makes billions.

PS: job Target pays $15/hr. Giving vaccines least much. Sincerely hope friend family member ends addicted something. Maybe less ass. Nope. unacceptable never happen again. It‚Äôs contract, really. could push issue guess she‚Äôll never make partner. It‚Äôs private group docs, hospital. Professional regulator here. right answer. Change process defense lawyers get real creative. always stick courts validated past. true let man hope damnit government's fault....continually moving goalposts nearly year.

Nobody believes they're told more, good bad. record, block you, no, agree you. Stupid policy.

Countries need vaccinate many can, soon can. EU used similar warped logic God knows many people end dying it. cynical. LIKE IT!  Apparently, federal government floating idea shutting public transit altogether, mandating FFP2 (N95) masks everywhere, even total lock-in suddenly table. Next week, we'll see many ideas states willing commit to.

(One article read poetically described current government response ""flailing arms utter panic idea mutations"".) No, get vaccine starting TODAY. Every night turned ""what want watch tonight?"" point watch TV pass time. Countries paid development vaccines created environments companies could flourish reaping benefits.

Why they? fair? Life fair. pandemic happening then. Uncompensated overtime?  stinks. unethical, illegal, request employees?  bonfire keep distance other. really even big deal. Chill out. 83% based comparing possible probable reinfections background infection rate previously uninfected group.

That said, 83% floor, 44 possible probable reinfections confirmed. example, took probables (2), rate increases 99% immune. likelihood, real number somewhere 83% 99%. international air travel open chartered planes Wuhan. idea vulnerable vaccinated resume mostly normal life thanks decreased risk. hard understand this? FL gave seniors play golf stay home day. really prepared say one CoVID died 9 months?

If cancer, die get tested CoVID, count?

What China's testing policy?

This know China's numbers BS - wholly 7 months ago. want tell whole second wave, ONE person died?

Does Winnie know keep success stories straight aligned? People arguing kids school district, demanding reopening now. 2nd worst state atm. idea wtf people thinking. caught last week MAD! could break - Zoom Christmas family instead traveling. Eating home every day instead going out, etc., etc. school teach insisted person last week I‚Äôve got ‚Äòrona. kicker week next week we‚Äôre virtual much staff out. lot could avoided virtual get-go. Sure are, covid-26 hits. coldest winter GA least 5 years

Weird! Warmest winter I've ever Ontario - 11 winters far warmest. barely 0C Lmao ain‚Äôt bozo Half country would boo would say ""YASS KWEEN SLAY!"" one would actually listen content saying all. Whatever reason investigated media held accountable spreading misinformation. Anyone 2 seconds research could find infected virus confer lasting immunity vast majority people. didn‚Äôt research negligence best, deliberate misinformation fear mongering worst. sure, yes!

I feel like I‚Äôve crusade try get folks understand infection disease aren‚Äôt same. that‚Äôs exactly say correct; far know, even fully vaccinated folks could get infected transmit. Likely reduced rate, cases lower yep, mask distance. Lol love people automatically confirm it‚Äôs political. time storm capitol weekend. one said foolproof way get it. believe sentiment ‚Äúdo can, smart, try stay healthy, move forward.‚Äù Marshall law, huh? People dying talking money. Get shit together selfish asshole. Oof. Imagine thinking    year 2020, 3 top cumulative leading causes death are:

1. Heart Disease - 700k (probably 680k area)
2. Cancer - 600k
3. *Covid-19* - 345k

So no, several causes death higher Covid , big two. #4 usually accidental deaths, 2020, may overtaken stroke; know numbers start getting close finalized. 2018 accidental deaths #3 cause 167k, Covid clears bar long shot securely #3 spot 2020.

It entirely possible 12 month period May May Covid-19 exceeds 600k deaths overtakes cancer 12 month period. depends vaccine rollout immunity starts curb explosive spread seeing now. give idea, 85k Americans died Covid past 31 days started coming side peak, rather seems rate death continues accelerate. Amen. Shutting business people won‚Äôt help makes 0 sense Happy 1 month vacci-versary! US began campaign exactly one month ago administered least 10 million shots since then. You‚Äôre absolutely nuts lol Dems literally moderate shit party. Moderate President, moderate senate super tight majority chambers Congress. Manchin, Sinema, Tester, Feinstein, Ossoff Kelly, expect get passed? like 5 progressive senators lol certainly moderate agenda I‚Äôm concerned passing all. you‚Äôre expecting kind bold progressive change first place, you‚Äôre going left heartbroken shell shocked.  parents acted way got sick. better think actually regret actions. isn‚Äôt much do.. learn hard way, unfortunately. People acting like ""we still know"". Point people still need wear masks social distance even vaccinated. I'm sure else do. 
Yes people know died it.
Yes people know are/have hospitalized weeks it.
I've beaten once.
Nobody job cares take precautions. 
Most people town still think ots fake.  clarify: 40% health care workers **in LA County** American üëã much tuning out, assure December said arms tired every shift shes constantly chest compressions dying patients.

r/thathappened

Seriously, unless designated CPR giver hospital services 5M+ metro area, huge exaggeration part. parents Texas. currently group get vaccinated. alas, vaccine available anywhere near them. üò¢ Appreciate it. Yea I'm good now. I'm 6'2"" 250 lb man Irish descent, high tolerance plays part. became issue usually drink heavy like times celebration relaxation. time profound sadness seeing people I've known 20 years show true colors. booze quickly turned sadness rage, thankfully generally manifested yelling whatever news social media stupidly consuming. healthy either way slice it. beers, THC, chill. social media, focusing control makes work. occasionally educate someone work might less educated receptive informed. lady husband come store. wearing mask, wasnt. asked one, started ""I medical permit wear one."" didnt even entertain it, told could give mask. opted leave, tried call complain owner. told medical permit potentially infect people deadly virus, hung her. Im sooooo fed BS. no. large states well too. California NY uniquely incompetent. True let lesson preparing future get back normal Open floodgates tbh. It‚Äôs travesty states used 30-40% distributed vaccines. Way much control. set mass vaccination clinics need ID showing you‚Äôre 65+ get vaccine. he's come contact neice positive believe still needs isolate couple days. virus 14 day incubation period, possible false negative (I hope though). CDC recommends isolating 14 days coming close contact someone who's covid positive. Hope helps. Anyone receiving shot (or doses matter) still social responsibility mask prevent potential spread others vaccinated. think responsibility ends point people provided opportunity vaccination. 

If vaccination proven sterilizing, going get whole world trouble people claim cannot spread covid shots. sure effective way ‚Äúprove‚Äù vaccination public setting suck grocery store, airport, etc, see many conflicts coming months.

Of course, must losing brain cells think Americans capability socially responsible point, I‚Äôve committed 2021 year optimism. Xe de. 

Hey look gme ask care ü•∞ went pharmacy asking ointment burn blistered. told ran cold water minutes immediately proceeded scold didn‚Äôt use toothpaste that‚Äôs blistered turning black. burn floor heater. remember learned firefighter came 5th grade class shouldn‚Äôt put anything like burn would scrape stuff burned skin order treat it. depends live. areas, people wear masks. areas, everyone does. actually yes, problem. sign Grainger account, problem finding n95 higher respirators (both reusable disposable) since last July. thread, comment, people saying overblown grandma die.  presented us *most* countries currently recording deaths per capita US. See outside mask social distancing, problem solved. family WhatsApp group keep touch / share grandkids etc, oh my, certain family members group, turned place rant everything see news / social etc etc. bringing everyone helpful slightest.

This great advice Squeak. There's much can't control, everyone focused little things (like said, hands/face/space) think we'd feel little better. countries actually fund development vaccine receiving? doubt it. They, many cases, simply paying receive guy, guy 12 monkeys supposed save world :( governor caught partying without mask on. nobody taking shit seriously. they? They're specifically risk die addiction. Addicts deserve compassion ... effectively useless

*Panik!* fuck humanity. hope die. Quebec announced today ‚Äúexperts‚Äù say second dose Pfizer vaccine administer 45-90 days first dose .... feeling frustrated today Yup. realized watching news constant negativity makes depressed already am. it‚Äôs related covid anything negative, I‚Äôll turn off. wear mask, sanitize, social distance accept is. College online great personally since get flexibility work. gotta wait til get vaccine nothing else done Close 100% tbh. Even production issues still millions doses ready shipped. south getting done, regarding vaccinations. north literally letting vaccines go bad thrown away due stupid bureaucratic meddling. That's low testing capacity. proactive testing back March April somehow bad them. Looks like investment olympics squandered. massive disinfo campaign

I wonder corporate media would clamoring doom gloom past year pushing story. wonder. problem is, solution wrong. Contrary popular belief, evidence masks slow spread covid. false info anti-science there, surprise see things continue get worse. analysis, would first come first serve. clarify, 83% *floor* immunity based study. 44, 2 considered probable reinfections others possible.

If 2 actual reinfections, number would 99% immunity. 44, that's 83% comes in. likelihood, it'll somewhere between. 110% effective bust! vaccine contagious... something. Really? still get even take precautions. way 100% avoid unless stay inside 24/7 grow food. 

Maybe feel differently love big city tons people walking around covid, every trip essential place small gamble even mask. literally open months. know, daily discussion place think we'll lockdown 2024 Well else supposed do? I'm baffled continued declarations people things serious health issues unless they're spread like virus.

If people concerned saving lives, start acting concerned. People magically get cancer. get cancer foundation society built everything help get cancer. Good. Congrats. grandmother got yesterday, grandfather getting wednesday next week. I'm super excited able see mean everyone complains lockdowns, one better solution vaccines get rolled out. likely trust people actually (enough) work home without constant supervision. Maybe try aligning goals deliverables instead hours worked, commit giving regular updates tracking. can't handle that, frankly manager business.

To fair, know industry maybe actually hours worked objective outcomes. double check see india included (it's not) noticed something interesting.

they looking administered vaccines ones shipped. effectively saying rich nations quickly jabbing populations (which think everyone universe expected) nation buys vaccine delivered them, hardly think anyone else's obligation send doctors/nurses inject unless nations asking help nearest rich nation 7 deaths Taiwan since beginning pandemic, Taiwan lying? still enjoy games degree can't watch TV. reminds things used be. Especially hang comedies. get upgraded trans.

Trans get upgraded asexual. 

Asexual get upgraded sexual. Yeah right Pot, meets kettle.

Ron DeSantis literally sent SWAT team data scientist refuses lie COVID case numbers.

And pretend West strong motive paint Chinese government either brutal draconian (but surprisingly, good job), bumbling fumbling idiots can't find asses map.

The truth likely somewhere between. understand coming from. ready frustrating become political clear fix this. 

There evidence even asymptomatic folks would get severe lung damage 70-80% time. feeling many folks know that. Yeah ain't gonna lie 2020 broke me. Due pandemic, racial injustices, war liberals (I'm liberal lesbian) election shit, also dealing like 4 personal issues ranging health problems, mom dad's health, dad becoming meth head wanting kill sister, job (union) asshole year fall time started fucking me. much BS every week something happened... I'm mentally strong person help break crying times. overwhelming. definitely smoked little much pot September October. high almost day every day. functioning unsafe, still. needed keep calm anxiety control. even anxiety depression mental health problems. 2020 much.

I'm much better now. Quitting toxic ass, racist, homophobic, sexist place. work jail basically toxic straight white male privilege could ever imagine. I'm moving far away, 1000 miles exact. 

But feel like brain changed. saw burnout cause long term issues left untreated knew overwhelmed stressed burnt out, anything yet stuff causing issues things control. 

If mentally string beforehand amazing wonderful loyal girlfriend, idk could made 2020 without much worse off. 

Now hate people society wanna left alone. wanna go work, work alone, come home girl spend days together drama. I'm looking forward move. businesses talking about. Going back normal flare ups initiate lockdowns briefer periods go back

Lmao. Western governments blew load failed good response Covid19. Fat chance lockdowns anywhere near followed back March. lost engineering job profits down. Nobody buying anything covid. wish people would take seriously. going choose hope one. fact already many effective vaccines amazing. It‚Äôs honestly hilarious catch disease insane spreading rate, you‚Äôre somehow idiot. everything right still get people forgot pandemic things worse ever. Reap sow. update hand. Ooo reminds woman held sign said son died covid still supports trump.... wonder she‚Äôs now. last 100 years cared much flu spreads eventually ends killing someone.

It unfortunate event life planet. sudden grandma murderer going eat salad outdoor patio read? like y‚Äôall acting like it‚Äôs oppressive asked wear mask public space strangers wait herd immunity kick in. Comments articles like remind truly selfish ridiculous people are.

Edit missing word Great use make sure results verifiable cannot altered/changed/faked 250mil eligible adults. 75% 188mil. We‚Äôve done 11mil far. Need pick pace, certainly possible get range June.  work several people it. One person 50s otherwise super healthy hospital weeks still unable work 2 months later due severe health problems. Others whole family infected, hospitalized.

Now good 20% (my work mostly qualifies) refusing vaccine. Many people either dont wear masks dont wear correctly. Insanity. Also go eyes

It exceedingly rare actually get Covid this. Switzerland. 18 get opportunity vaccine July. feel same. preschool teacher. got covid. experiencing life altering symptoms.  hate needed risk life barely make ends meet, ton hospital bills can't pay. Fuck trying homeless. Fuck covid, fuck people. wait i'm confused, gay choice then?

/s never data suggest 3 months immunity limit. anything data always suggested would minimum year more. always wear cloth kn95 mask, surgical mask. Short n95, similar respirator, think setup pretty good. authoritarian creepy.  Australia exit ban though, mention cap number residents return home. measures would never fly Europe, North America. probably level protection - still careful second! Would dumb get you‚Äôre close ""cloudy lungs""? right math, 28.5%. fool. someone close personal experience addicts. Unlike you, sense empathy. MN reopened bars restaurants 50% capacity (which nobody followed lockdown again, follow now) schools set welcome back kids Tuesday.

Full capacity k-3rd grade hybrid learning rest.

We fucked funny anymore. sure posts violate policies Reddit. discussing coronavirus reply people wearing masks social distancing idiots die. keep dropping hints like Fauci talking masks 100 days inauguration. must know people completely tired lockdowns.

I think one important things Biden start restore confidence trust government. Trump everything could tear part are. turning around would improve many things stop bunch squabbling. kind lockdown plan need present right way also show people kind positive message hope. shifting goalposts thing undermined people's trust confidence. Like 1984 war always almost over, ""free beer tomorrow"". ‚ÄúWell chance dying like 1% old frail.‚Äù

You know what? You‚Äôre exactly right, likely won‚Äôt die. However, cause kidney failure. Congratulations survived welcome dialysis. Lung issues, good luck activity requiring extra effort. Neurological conditions, better hope there‚Äôs long term nerve damage. Heart issues, enough said.

But veil many refuse look secondary &amp; tertiary problems come it. Yes, survived wasn‚Äôt near bad flu. reckless behavior turn gave 10 people creating chain reaction. month later chain resulted many requiring hospitalization. You‚Äôre dad suddenly MI/CVA symptoms call ambulance. ambulance never shows it‚Äôs waiting outside ER patient back 14 hours enter building. say decide drive you‚Äôre dad ER. Sorry, one capacity patients even hallways. Now, drive another one second dad extremely critical. Dad doesn‚Äôt receive treatment time passes (happened city work 3 weeks ago). 

It‚Äôs fatality rate. Modern medicine exceptional days. It‚Äôs hospitals, who‚Äôs staffing already anemic, bombarded exponential number patients causing otherwise routine scenarios easily treated, unjustly suffer severe consequences due actions others. started filtering focusing it‚Äôs extra stress something can‚Äôt control 

Welcome Stoicism, friend Ya that‚Äôs interpreted sign 2 dose test. would imagine people would drop like flies vaccine approved next month people wait 2 years find got know someone 25, COVID October (hospitalized 5 days, couldn‚Äôt keep fluids down), flew Texas see family Christmas, managed get first shot clinic ‚Äúbecause underlying condition prioritized‚Äù. Texas first come first serve dependent facility make decisions register? need one instance catch covid. 

Condensing entire days worth grocery shoppers limited hours (even limited employment) vastly increase risk exposure everyone. 

I caught covid supermarket shoppers. following guidelines. Stunning retort well thought comment Got first Moderna shot today - even hint pain injection site. Source? Nobody ever said would living like years. That‚Äôs unsustainable Come Orange County, people seem allergic masks here, infuriating! curious, annual flu vaccine 60-70% range effectiveness. 80% sounds low, it‚Äôs still quite strong people thought health insurance america unaffordable previously. SCARED come 2020  response: ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø shit already everywhere lol. UK discovered first. US astronomical numbers months now. doubt new variants here.

This doesn‚Äôt detract OPs message. Limit time outside place, mask, social distance, try stress much otherwise. everyone followed basics would thing check. Buttt know people are. aunt hospitalized covid recently uncle died weeks ago dad's going dinner friend. feel like whole world gone insane. pandemic shown people general seem really bad seeing things long-term extrapolating future consequences. Everyone reacts see right front them; factor things something might put ahead later on, like one ignoring parental leave gobsmacked kid suddenly need it. problem virus successful response predicting future consequences now; spreads aggressively already late reacting current situation bad. find wear day work, need least day them. 

That long seems result humidity face, breath, etc cause damp ok mask. happens, seems kinda lose shape feels like ends mouth kinda gross. 

I rotate try give space it. seriously must sad people actually think way private home health care worker friend missed appointment vaccine shot multiple times.

""Other stuff do""

How kill patients kids? that!!??

It's aggravating. trying put forth data. detailing it‚Äôs like here.   Spoiler Alert: won't. yes is.  LA County, deaths day reached almost 20% US‚Äô deaths last week never getting freedoms back; last train pulls station Yeah, considered that. got touch foster they're healthy. could mean asymptomatic, though. several riots going country speak

Where? mean that‚Äôs scientists businesses talking about. Going back normal flare ups initiate lockdowns briefer periods go back. know guys don‚Äôt wanna hear I‚Äôm going trust science. Look China, thats literally what‚Äôs happening lmao 100% happen. Neither party wants begin with.  anti vaxxers keep propagating virus results straining hospitals again, expect mask use continue. respect guy, honestly remain quiet timelines. way giving another summer. LA County literally almost 600 deaths day last week thought too. estimates many 30% population may already exposed. could exclude vaccinations could go much 30% faster.

But adds lot logistics antibody tests accurate. risk would want take antibody test, get false negative, skip vaccination, get sick. Probably best vaccinate everyone. Let ask different way.

You think influenza terms (""staying home respect others"", ""traveling worth dying causing someone else die""). yes true COVID deadlier influenza widespread ***right now***.

But slowly, time, people gain vaccine-induced immunity natural immunity infection, COVID approach influenza lethality prevalence. might even end less deadly influenza years, since transition pandemic endemic mean mostly young children ones getting first time given that, expect know COVID longer existential threat, rather everyday reality manage upend lives (like influenza)? waiting ""feel safe""?

Or expect go like forever? mean throw doses out? place CDC site historical data download updating daily hand?   Lags? USA better EU vaccination. :) 2 sides care beating other. American people. Dogs infected humans. Maybe given little Trojan horse. Especially Washington gets info states also release public. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* what?

/s everyone we‚Äôd better place. You‚Äôre exactly doi. life back normal moths now. Don‚Äôt know he‚Äôs talking about. trivial detail, almost 10% population already.

I think we're probably well north 10% point.... Well consistent message communication. One person reads something news, another Facebook, another told neighbor, think truth.

A huge part problem this, information consistent message. government PR campaign run ads like ""get vote"". proof lockdowns end think are. help China, countries relying China, vaccine efficacy rate 50%. guess that's matter much money willing risk.

You could certainly book now, gotta prepared able go trip that's significantly different would hope for.

If want risk right now, need observe things change here. pull trigger personal feel risk/benefit tells book trip.

To tell personal opinion: propose girlfriend, I'd want something look back 30 40 years think ""those good old times"", I'm sure would case pretty much toeing line COVID restrictions. Personally book anything country France declared squarely control. words, doubt would year, unless things speed significantly spring. ""Window opportunity"", anyone? COVID Fatigue.

I honest god don‚Äôt blame - last year *fucked* don‚Äôt want anymore.

Difference know mask up, start home, stay safe get shit overwork get back fucking normal. Draconian rules make people care more. lock people tell can't earn living, eventually people give fuck. care covid anymore. work hospital shocking number front line secondary staff getting it. week, anything already accounted second dose released county. honestly know reason refusal. Everyone I'm close enough ask got jab soon could. Might feeling apathy invincibility? got yet type thing. less interested current pandemic next one. feel pretty good vaccine options currently glad see new technology developed unfortunately probably going last time see kind outbreak.

The mRNA vaccine development actually started almost 10 years ago, one reasons able develop one That's federal level. US 44 million doses already, distributed half that. half, 30% actually injected (numbers days ago, could higher now). 

Biden plans stop holdback. makes sense, given major supply chain disruptions extremely unlikely. expert, guess would factor likelihood exposure. So, example, imaginary disease somehow immunity post-infection, still expect 100% recovered reinfected short time period, exposed.

That said, looks like they're looking 44 pretty extensively able confirm 2 reinfections. guess would decent portion remaining number be, course interested see. without knowing integrity immune systems either. ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù could people immunocompromised skewing data ‚Äúaverage person‚Äù like virus evolving many new variant strains due mutations around world. wonder perhaps going mutation wave due weather changes factor. perhaps mutation coincidently discovered different locations compared other. Yeah also says like 35% people vaccinated time number care think public health officials well healthcare workers choice?

In country, healthcare worker refuse vaccinate real medical condition makes vaccination risky, fired allowed practice medicine anywhere country. think I‚Äôm lying reason? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible hold beliefs simultaneously?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* expert totally agree, doesn‚Äôt seem right total dick holes also worry lengthening dosing interval from, say, 3 weeks 3 months, could speed emergence mutants creating pool subimmune people enough antibodies slow virus avoid developing symptoms‚Äîbut enough wipe out. people might incubate viruses mutations allow dodge vaccine-induced antibodies‚Äîfor example, changing amino acid sequence site antibodies previously bound, preventing virus invading cells replicating. COVID-19 vaccines generate immunity one protein, spike protein virus‚Äô surface, new vaccines might easier mutant viruses evade vaccines evoke broader immunity

Bieniasz says can‚Äôt say certainty whether vaccine-resisting viral strains result. ‚ÄúBut goal would it."" 7 day rolling average also peak there's that. stating amount cases came amount tests daily report govt pushes people

I said another comment every day 50%+ positivity tokyo (thank fuck!) Data dump, reached actual 4k day per day yet Youyang Gu's projection website US hitting herd immunity 5 months...and Moderna Pfizer vaccines! Imagine fast we'll move J&amp;J AstraZeneca sure. Anti-vax people take anything potentially negative said blow up. &lt;orders another oz Ultimate Trainwreck better start giving out. got 2 million haven‚Äôt administered according bloomberg. strange sensation like jump pool get chlorine nose. sensation almost flavor it...impossible describe closest description metallic-y chlorine flavor. I‚Äôm seeing anyone talk this, husband Covid symptom. We‚Äôre 3 weeks out, still comes back sometimes. Settle sparky. bad right now, absolutely. get better, also yes. Sooner rather later. asthma, lady state health department said due asthma infected normal around 95. already disadvantage. Ah see, simply stop thinking people mostly likely yo die virus people worthy life.

Brilliant ages patients? illnesses? lungs look like 1 month negative test? 6 months? lungs look pneumonia? flu? 

Many questions asked anecdotal evidence. Need actual study longterm determine big problem is. whole state, unlike Newsom facing petition total recall.

I see there, \*slow clap\* anyone else concerned delayed J&amp;J approval (apparently maybe till March now?!) production issues they‚Äôve terms delaying normalcy. NGL mainly looking reassurance rn Santa barbara here. Essential worker site link shared others. Ive given direction employer yet bunch coworkers signed up. I've trying site used keeps showing clinics available. Dead parents pretty bad setback kid.

Do actual data dropouts?

That doesn‚Äôt reflect experience actual teacher. Generally symptomatic infections.  October. I'm 31, despite rough 3 days, able get without hospitalization. breathing same. get tired easily seem need sleep used to. also wake chest pains occasionally Surgical masks better pretty cheap now. also breathe better cloth masks. rotate every days hanging ones don‚Äôt use air out. Humans lived worse things covid. many things forgotten never happened. One day young person look weird talk covid pandemic 2020.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* already COVID high levels (like US now, Wuhan did) choice Wuhan-style lockdown. act early keep COVID suppressed much less disruption life. Why? People already settled decisions. personally affected, won‚Äôt change. imposed restrictions several countries, every country that. That‚Äôs different allowing residents leave return there‚Äôs reason every democracy world hasn‚Äôt suggested similar measures. likely comes fit. Surgical masks form good seal likely much better cloth masks do. Cloth masks good seal next useless. Ok, year tops you‚Äôre saying. We‚Äôre currently two months away year restrictions. time, people lost jobs, lost opportunities never present again, leave school without proper qualifications, list goes on. Right now, it‚Äôs nice easy say ‚Äúit‚Äôs year selfish be‚Äù, unless we‚Äôre intending life normal 2 months, simply isn‚Äôt. 

This virus real clearly dangerous certain sects population. However, amount people simply couldn‚Äôt give shit (on many issues, COVID) staggering. reading comment chain FB UK (I‚Äôm British national living US) saw someone said 1/2 lung capacity due medical condition had, can‚Äôt wear mask, can‚Äôt go work job. Masks 0 distorting oxygen levels, peoples heads. 

Outside obvious, there‚Äôs multiple things. mental health wasn‚Äôt great going pandemic. tanked result it. Someone loves sitting phone, playing online games, watching 2 seasons show bed obviously isn‚Äôt struggling much this. But, you‚Äôve heard extroverts, right? I‚Äôm somewhere middle, 99% time completely alone day 0 *physical* social interaction gf comes home, stay night, go bed, rinse repeat, absolutely killing me. 

One biggest issues virus painted dangerous, deadly, highly problematic across board. It‚Äôs hard convincing someone miss good chunk life (be concerts, graduations, exams, seeing friends, going bar), lose jobs/sanity, something HUGE chunk population contract, don‚Äôt even know it. It‚Äôs hard work, unsupportive government, getting social interaction, able anything circumstance. understand looking going ‚Äúall virus get, I‚Äôm likely even know it‚Äù. 

If transmission issue, advise/legislate vulnerable groups isolate? way governments could support fully needed it, rather trying figure best way avoid giving girlfriend less half paycheck‚Äôs worth money one off. It‚Äôs happening anyway, really? elderly/vulnerable locked rest us. support systems likely need rather preventing anyone damn thing? Challenge it. life we're talking about. get fired, find another job Another issue know people caught it, included yet know anyone died it. 

Same. know 20+ people got COVID, ranging late teens 90s. one seriously sick (an 80 year old several pre-existing conditions) rest fine days. fine now. accurate anti-body tests? probably back March. Would anti-body test even show anything since long? hear 2nd dose fabulous cite another source? Same. Hopefully viral low it‚Äôs mild case say ""Common Sense"" French?  understand now!  week since symptoms subsided lung capacity still trash Pregnancy CDC‚Äôs list high-risk medical conditions, NJ list came from. 

[CDC memo re: expanding US military suppose strict procedures ensure American military personnel spread covid overseas military bases. American military already dealing lot bad PR rapes, sex abuse, assaults, etc., Americans associated overseas military bases. imagine still happening. yeah saw that. read article time made original comment. 

also kinda sneaky (disingenuous?) include india, 30 million doses hand today, injections start next couple days Congrats repeating title? saying Korea gets number cases week get day. However based per capita numbers means Korea better US. don‚Äôt know actually case, claim. Aka nothing brag about.  Says who? It‚Äôs airborne virus spreads aerosol particles via cough sneezing? people also still touch eyes, fact tell us happy medium reality truth. one thought would locked almost year, yet are. Crawl back social justice void came from. 

Well that's one way invalidate random mortality rate 

It's random though. yes statistical outliers (healthy 40 year old dies, sick 80 year old lives) *overwhelmingly* sick elderly dying everyone else fine. Tonight Portugal start one month full lockdown (apart schools reason). Buying international plane ticket 2021 huge gamble, man. Good point. Limit exposure subreddit. Get sunlight fresh air. hobbies.

Best. *was, articles Yeah would trial error. think incredibly naive think nobody's life upended due social distancing (and lesser extent mask-wearing well). 


While completely favor restrictions, can't deny federal government come support people who's jobs income curtailed due social distancing. put many people lose-lose situation regards decision making pandemic.  According many called experts here, 50% need herd immunity safe now! think it‚Äôs lead water like Roman Empire? seem become dumbest nation earth.  feel man, I'd put girlfriend ""better average"" category - sound disciplined - feel like we're standing alone rock (generally smart, ""woke"") people know taking 4th 5th unnecessary plane trip since March going Hawaii ""they're hurting tourism dollars."" I'm starting crack people, even stop Zoom socializing family decisions this. can't say anything ""too wide"" doses thrown away allocation usage 30%. fucking crime humanity US states appear inept getting shot people's arms slowly. single dose sit shelf 24 hours, period. 

Getting high priority people vaccine *is important*, getting *everyone vaccinated fast possible*. 

If overly-restrictive qualifications mean people get sick die long term, virus time spread sitting thumbs butts contemplating kinds qualifications enforce, help over-worked over-stressed front line healthcare essential workers either! got ton work lately? efficacy tends good though. I'm aware big part guess strains, however. Where? Texas heart defect found anything. cool like emotionally abusing ""friend."" mean grinding? I'm afraid want know is. think many people hear constant news stories cases see co-workers, friends family get time even show symptoms. 

This truth. know 20+ gotten it, ranging late teens 90s. one really suffered 80-something hypertension, diabetes, preexisting heart problems. Everyone completely fine, including aforementioned 80 year old. 

Honestly I'm afraid getting COVID. care. Mass testing properly enforced quarantine could mitigate impact virus vaccination efforts start effect. Alas, Western countries abandoned serious contact tracing neglected ramp testing maintain pace. hear people constantly saying can‚Äôt wait pandemic over. clearly don‚Äôt want bad enough actually wear mask actually get vaccinated. Fucking insane. people made small compromises we‚Äôd much, MUCH better place right now. People dumb hell. exactly, thank you! case back March. 
I wasn‚Äôt short breath fever never high. lungs felt like sand paper though, bad cough lasted while. husband sick like 10 days, cough. agree Tegnell lockdowns pointless. Good. Yeah no. already it, even want guinea pig vaccine. get flu vaccine yearly, I'll wait one.

The vaccine Pandemrix caused narcolepsy. one caused platelets 56 year old, perfectly healthy doctor fail, killing him. right socialize important someone else's health. Yes, make selfish. disease deadly need reminded existence. r/titlegore
/r/ihadastroke Like said months ago. USA never rid virus stay. new normal. way shut everything half ass shut like had. I'm talking everything except necessary things. 

78 Million people voted Trump that's 78 Million people caring Virus. Like xrays news showed morning. think Texas surgeon talking  doubts sincere investigation actually taking place. dog &amp; pony show pretend like they‚Äôre something. Would love true. Maybe announced yesterday, shots appointments even clinics available Wayne Oakland counties. state seems best step every opportunity. Really sucks hear that. married thankfully (since 2019 lol) go walks wife regularly pretty cold nowadays.

I wear mask really miss pre-2020 life like hanging bars restaurants etc. can't negotiate force nature. friend whose family works manufacturing China stated theres covid outbreaks whole time. lot localities workplaces though seem hiding central government though prevent lockdowns closures. central government still seems trying stop it.

Theres still mask mandates many places restrictions well exactly business usual. countries underreporting. According recent news, US 35% Russia 300% Covid deaths officially counted. situation bound much worse 3rd world people die without Covid test. Ah. knew you. Poor baby. cry engage covid denialism. 

I doubt continue go night, desire continue endulge little temper tantrum. would analyzing data impact unblinding? definitely not, I‚Äôm curious would think does. Again, I'm gonna wear mask, socially distance whenever possible, get vaccine, everyone else fuck off. I'm done. go...  Yes, wrong. Specifically reflecting wrong changing behaviour thinking continue wrong future?

I'm detecting odd amount gaslighting dismissivness you. Look, months ago many people cheering trial results vaccines proclaiming everything over. going hit new year tens millions people vaccinated fully immune. Soon hundreds millions would get jab life would normal March. 

But time many people looked exact data came different conclusion, would fixed overnight. challenges vaccine distribution real still solved, March would continue bad place hundreds thousands daily infections continuing.

And people differing opinions treated? Downvotes, bans... ""doomer"" silly!!! disgusting see disgusting see people like continue gaslight learn nothing continuing wrong. treated like emergence new disease. Fortunately, one vaccine for. need test find this, trace, isolate, vaccinate around surrounding area explodes results rationing care. worry it. even happen, 4th day office. Oregon represent! measures fly whenever government chooses enforce them.

UK banned flights South America Portugal. Probably won‚Äôt tbh.... still like 18 days till second you‚Äôll fine then. let someone shame fluency native tongue. expressed views adequately, they're finding nitpick ""invalidate"" argument. planet living on? It‚Äôs apartheid Israel. Christians really don‚Äôt care ‚Äúlife‚Äù you? FDA needs hurry AZ. point delaying EUA worth given minimal risks involved. yes, hopefully it‚Äôll heal slowly back I‚Äôm 39 healthy. English second language probably ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù wasn‚Äôt right term, like long term damage. Sorry, I‚Äôm buying this. 

So according surgeon everyone even one symptom severe lung damage 80% asymptomatic patients too?

That goes literally hundreds studies point generally show anywhere 15-30% *hospitalized* patients kind organ damage x-rays evaluations. anything comfort you. fact 1 3 people shows nowhere near deadly originally thought. matter headline, forget Instacart treated workers early days pandemic.  still constantly amazes learn much better countries dealing virus. course, must losing brain cells think Americans capability socially responsible point

Or Europeans another wave. Chinese another wave. Australians...I could go on. Seeing vaccines offer total complete protection, infection could still happen, much less likely. Yup, makes sense wealthier nations required storage facilities/transportation distribute administer vaccines.

For reference, 10 countries used: terms total doses top countries US, China, UK, Israel, United Arab Emirates, Italy, Russia, Germany, Spain Canada. probably caught son here. fucking insanity!! It‚Äôs American way This.

Don‚Äôt snowboarder Olympics win gold trick right finish line, fell, lost.

Finish race, you‚Äôre good! Ah yes, ""just flu"" strikes wouldn't. much information virus going year ago would meant would unprepared. example, know virus transmitted weeks first cases reported. gist lockdown nothing stop spread resuming.

Obviously lockdown either: Got em opinion recent deaths people got vaccinated? 
from I've seen fairly old people fatal heart attacks hours getting first shot one guy 50s suffered hemorrhagic stroke days getting vaccinated. also recorded deaths young healthy people. 

it's tiny number considering number people vaccinated causality found yet far know.

I one know mRNA vaccines could cause I'm also professional matter. Palestinians government, provide vaccines them. allowed venues use loophole health dept. negotiated NBC SNL. organs. said go night....

No, like proving Covid bedwetters wrong. It‚Äôs little bit hobby moment enjoy lockdown induced unemployment 20 year professional career.  ""lose another summer"" sounds like talking point. I'm hearing echo (echo (echo (echo))) Yes, do, sucky thing: take away fun parts people (dinners, hangouts, parties, bars, restaurants) preserve shitty capitalist parts (work, school people work).  Look. would agree Europe USA took kinds steps beginning saturated would take months months hardcore lockdown get rid it. Even animal reservoirs need lockdown would probably come back up.

After ten months restrictions, absolutely one would go now. coworkers grandma, rest home, got corona, worried sick. Guess what? lived. really pretty telling we're able view virus common enemy. mean, is. mad vague terrorists know nothing see can't collectively fighting virus.

We've even anthropomorphized blown picture give face. still people need look another race people mad instead. almost like they're racist idiots mad anyway using excuse. Still, around third 14 million people living Jordan River Mediterranean Sea included vaccination campaign. Israel distributed vaccines Jewish settlers West Bank, Palestinians cramped, impoverished Gaza Strip.  That‚Äôll interesting see happened ‚Äúnever forgetting‚Äù  tried nothing gave - Americans I‚Äôm already gay become ultra gay?? I‚Äôm down.  that's it, it? see community someone care about. concern health people favorite *sportsball team* neighbors, ""those people"" side tracks.

If change, we're stuck nation. blame last 40 years, mentality ""we've got *ours*, fuck you!"" coming *certain* classes politicians this. Antibodies tend fade months. know several people definitely tested positive COVID April/May longer test positive antibodies. (T B cell protection remains wouldn‚Äôt show antibody test). may never know really March, unfortunately. Hearing people say vaccines covid different vaccines - something rna related. really different vaccines currently use? plan getting soon can, curious respond someone talking different Yeah made wack claim someone part effective vaccine range could infected still transmit data. Shit obnoxious read  Take money...but I‚Äôm gonna see price point like $400 USD sad That's really even remotely comparable. federal government bungling response states separate responses varying degrees success = free market activity? realized week needed serious caring-compassion meditation exercises something, father-in-law got work *thinks* he's safe get it, man try. ended worst one everyone get it, still bad thankfully, made freaking angry rest knuckle-dragging, Trump-country, bar-hopping rednecks works got easy. wishing misery suffering upon ignorance, miserable year made feel regarding people. fucked up. people still listening WHO? American pandemic strategy always normalize large numbers. 3,000-4,000 people dying every day. anyone really care?  Depending vaccine question (many less effective) well variables individuals responding strongly vaccines others. text message received recently. Edited protect identity. father took ill week ago, elderly also received messages like one understand import taking precautions seriously.... also sociable still accepting visitors friends thinking risk 
He presented extreme fatigue days later mild fever. Suspecting covid began treating awaiting test. testing stations overwhelmed took four days get positive result.
In meantime developed severe fevers lasted four hours time.
He mother denial insisting virus.
He battled fevers fevers broke four grueling days looked fine. insisted recovering even cancelled nurse brother arranged him.
The next morning mother frantically called. Within minutes could breathe. oxygen saturation dropped 53.
The neighbour went house house found someone half empty oxygen cylinder managed stabilize him. brother made way take hospital tried find hospital bed - none! brother could get house. made way knowing do. called ambulance none available. dialed netcare ambulance either put call thru another company trying find ambulance.
When got father bad shape. oxygen finishing tank managed get car wanted drive hospital would make oxygen left. could sit back car hold hand recite verses calm him. thought end trying find pray words couldn‚Äôt come due tears. ambulance called 10 minutes away.
They arrived collected went hospital field tent option. called dr said beds. field tent access oxygen concentrators cylinders could manage breathe machine oxygen levels low. dr tent overwhelmed knowing attend first.... many patients father battling air. stood blazing sun outside tent could see could try get calm down, watching trying reach bed in. watched suffocating almost passing out. dr came said oxygen cylinders available want help dad get oxygen. rushed different places - stock. Time essence. places turned away need account buy oxygen time wondering whether ok tent. Finally angel human forwarded account number use via WhatsApp group. got oxygen rushed back Alhamdulillah able breathe bad shape. Still beds available didn‚Äôt know whether oxygen going run would next sales person told come back more.
My father given bed 8.30pm hospital spending entire day fighting life outside tent ..... 
May God bless assisted day. May God bless doctor nurse tent, volunteers told putting risk save lives thinking health families.
My mother tested positive symptoms alone home - put family risk go see her? can‚Äôt leave alone - hard especially calls says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared chest tight‚Äù reminded care us reach old age become like children..... people would call scared look happened deadly virus. Sadly beautiful father returned Creator yesterday (Friday) minutes midnight.
No matter is.... virus, man made, mutated, 5G .... doesn‚Äôt matter, infecting people causing great pain, suffering loss life. Please wait happen home understand seriousness situation. please respect others put risk believe real. good completely agree. hoped covid would show businesses different way continue operate, has. hometown restaurants set lot outside seating entirely closed interior. Traditional brick mortar financial institutions, insurance, mortgage, banking seem thrive in-person appointments think problem ""old-timers"" cant get around 

My boss still going clients houses conduct extensive 2 hour walkthroughs order insure dwelling. hey okay cause wearing mask /s Nope. Around 220k cases day around 800k vaccinations day give take due non-tested cases reporting would true, except whole problem viral pandemic low risk people infect higher risk people. vaccinating *everyone* reduces risk *everyone else.*

Even yet proven vaccine fully ""sterilizes"" people spreading it, *certainly* reduces risk happening quite lot. 

So entirely selfless noble refuse vaccine offered, think ""I need it"". YES, DO. refusing might let someone else get now... slows overall effort, vaccine that's basically right front redirected someone else. delusional expect people raised liberal individualism libertarian strains thought even bare minimum help put societal common good themselves.

The USA martial law right now. military enforcing covid restrictions countries populist disproportionately liberal individualist libertarian mindset.

If done, disease control is. Jet fuel melt steel beams. worry people gonna keeo getting Covid years forever. there's last person get they'll almost certainly anti-vaxxer. there‚Äôs kinds fallout, like people experiencing long covid. Yep. WTO date pushed July 1 like October. understand push get everyone back office quickly. Second guessing important, FDA done exactly loosening guidelines phases. rate limiting step vaccination always doses never people jab. process remain fluid open change. don‚Äôt adapt fly we‚Äôll never correctly. fifth others wearing mask

Pick one Yes. thread outside one 3 weeks since last update, think biggest delay yet. know October Nov 3 week break too, usually updated every week. dumb. someone else something stupid mean too. Dunno that, Germany vaccinated much less people countries used vaccine. like Fauci really care says anymore, every week he's saying something different, I've basically tuned point  Palestinians living West Bank Gaza Strip Israeli citizens, fact 138 193 nations UN recognize regions sovereign nation Palestine. latter region likes lob missiles Israel, responds kind roughly year.

The Arab Israelis, Palestinians Israeli citizenship full Israeli rights going eligible vaccines like Israeli citizens.

Now Israel treats living West Bank Gaza, that's whole worms, Israel responsible getting vaccines, though im sure three sides (Israel, Hamas, Fatah run Palestinian Authority West Bank) come solution, least Israel Palestinian Authority can... Hamas good negotiating. prefer mouth breather. Aint bit early china bots posting? 0 chance winning next term

*[cries 2016 ""conventional wisdom""]* brothers work made whole staff sign waiver catch Covid terminated. 11.1 million Americans, 3% U.S. population, gotten first shot vaccine, gain 800,000 day before, Centers Disease Control Prevention said Thursday. goal inoculating anywhere 70% 85% population achieve herd immunity conquer outbreak still many months away many times get posted? goodness Karma may kind Yeah isn‚Äôt Olympic works Best luck. Try needlessly infect anyone way out. would like reduce I‚Äôm trying one beer night. far good.

In case one ever told you: congratulations. I'm trying way sarcastic patronizing --- takes lot concerted effort people realize. That's big deal, worth appreciating. people care care don‚Äôt don‚Äôt. point non order magnitude changes deaths going change that. Indeed. article vague. fever nausea kill someone? people already deathbed sent edge? allergic reaction? old warehouse job multiple cases began sweeping rug want close down. recent outbreak, four people got it, lived one person. ""uninfected"" person came said HR lady naturally got sent home. Fast forward weeks later supervisor, line manager got it. told us keep ourselves, friend said told exact thing back October.

Surprising nobody. number cases per day larger number vaccinations per day? necessarily think work lockdowns locking people homes.

So exactly Tegnell thinks. It‚Äôs hard stay home pay rent.

However, always remember: *conscious choice* deny COVID stimulus direct aid. Precisely would ""forced"" go back work.

I'll leave exercise redditor figure benefits that. Yeah ""lockdown fetishists"" want tens thousands excess deaths total collapse medical system.

God forbid sacrifice minor individual freedoms sake societal wellbeing greater good. here. employer even let go office 15 minutes pick running kit. ethical objection admirable, but... get vaccinated, could *go back work person* assist overall vaccination effort, nothing else, could safely treat patients need routine medical care (or provide admin support providers do). 

The prioritization scheme messed sure, individual people second-guess help anyone, ends resulting doses stored unused thrown away.

If there's burning building (the pandemic), everyone thinks ""no, evacuate, I'll hold door open someone else""... eventually someone walk fucking door. lot better everyone does, fast can, instead crowding around inside waiting others leave. suspicions correct, one ones don‚Äôt understand tax brackets work. embarrassed know something speaking authority dangerous.

If someone's new hire, sure get it. i've industry 4 years I'm mid-20s lol know conservative made valid point changed mind. right force people stay home compensate them. hurts business, jobs, families he's got point.

Which point progressives/liberals now--but conservatives think ""giving people free stuff"" bad, ""makes 'em lazy, want work"". That's *multiple* COVID relief bills passed House sat ~~ninja turtle~~ Mitch McConnell's desk, unheard ok lock includes massive stimulus spending cant happen state level money. must come federal

See above. *cough cough* ""someone"" pulled head shell, could reality. agree, don‚Äôt forget ‚Äúthey‚Äù us reading needs work. Cases != deaths. Derkha derkha American Federal Government: men enemy bullets! Think way. Smokers getting vaccinated keeps ICU, meaning unlikely event need bed, one likely available.

Frankly can‚Äôt trust employees work home aren‚Äôt hiring right employee hiring practices garbage. even survive, still may left severe complications make hard go back baseline functioning 

Scary . It‚Äôs ‚Äúonly 15 days‚Äù almost year now. Covid doesn‚Äôt give shit curfews doesn‚Äôt give shit lockdowns. don‚Äôt work. recommendation greatly appreciated. Thank you!  speak fact need job, I‚Äôm tuning lot employers are. ‚ÄúWe need person interview‚Äù, problem, ‚Äúwhat protocols?‚Äù. answer cancel interview, don‚Äôt care safety others, certainly don‚Äôt care you. 0 people workplace coronavirus, that's 0% comment brewing coffee home, too! many people go Starbucks afford quality espresso machine fresh beans needed make comparable coffee?

Like, fuck, sucks, berating people wanting ""good"" cup coffee 5 bucks without extra strings attached making home right, especially pandemic government provided adequate supports workforce shut down.

People acting like respecting pandemic supporting businesses opposite ends binary. Says every person gives fun part preserve shitty capitalist part.

It's like traffic - traffic, traffic. Yesterday 4,000 people died US COVID. Last week, S. Korea ~3,500 *cases*. deaths, cases. comment said, comparing US deaths SK deaths... much better weekly case count less daily death count. No, population difference explain this. Stupidity greed do. truly rather. necessarily think work lockdowns locking people homes. certainly quarantine rules, face protection health care etc., TTI begin with. lot things could implemented didn't.

There several positive things come delaying spread, better preparedness, protection, structures, personnel, treatments, waiting vaccine forth. really good reasons ultimate goal **to stop** spread infection best abilities, never official goal. Yta won‚Äôt get fooled says patients who've COVID-19 symptoms show severe chest X-ray every time, asymptomatic show severe chest X-ray 70% 80% time. getting back friends social lives Fauci saying need wear masks Fall 2021?

Surely case rates low, others know vaccinated focus energies activities socially distanced (i.e. going clubbing) expect anyone shelter themselves. That's ridiculous.

But vaccinated 2021, children immune compromised all.

So what's wrong suggestion wear masks? barely inconvenience pathetic folks can't suck wear protect around society large. find time get sort argument, I'm mostly arguing myself. really believe believe, need convince yourself, there's usually reason argue. think I've ever really changed someone's mind arguing --- people set ways.

So yeah, argue disagree anyone unless need to, someone actually spend time like girlfriend. point winning arguments per se, finding common ground compromising deciding we're compatible. also got 400k dead year it? Agree. saying there's good argument fauci saying makes sense.....and good argument fucking dumb say it. mean, got vaccinated people saying WORSE around I'm likely spreading know symptoms. crazy coming reasonable people watch fauci religiously. seems know difference 'estimated' 'found'. linked outcome one computer modelled GUESS December 23 last year. CDC saying ""91 million **may** infected"" date, ""**if if** computer model least somewhat accurate"". modelling disease wildly inaccurate and, **OF COURSE** constant flux course last year. Johns Hopkins site American Academy Pediatrics use actual real reported numbers **not guesses**. CDC would first admit number computer assisted guess nothing more. 

There doubt numbers reported USA underreported, especially comparison civilized countries universal public health care millions people very, leery contact might lead kidnapped sent elsewhere, perhaps deaths. 

Even can't recognize difference established fact guess (estimate) enough common sense understand every infectious disease different death rates different age groups. EVERY one Covid 19. ""86"" comes dividing **real** reported deaths according American Academy Pediatrics two given collected data two million **real** reported cases. teach simple division first years primary school ?

To think level still think IgG levels end-all-be-all immunity?

Because IgG antibodies end-all-be-all immunity comes reinfection SARS-CoV-2. That's prevents person getting severely all, blood levels IgG tangential best immunity respiratory viruses, detectable antibody levels many infections fall extremely quickly despite functional immunity still existing. 

We're talking specifically SARS-CoV-2 here. want talk diseases, pandemic important epithelial IgA memory B cells. Second, pulling 7% preprint.

And read Crotty paper, see show levels IgA memory (CD8) going down.  Figure 2 shows numerous individuals undetectable levels IgA first time I've heard somebody refer ""epithelial IgA"" produced epithelial cells. Figure 3 shows CD8 cell memory. IgG memory B cells make bulk immune response SARS-CoV-2. arguing importance IgA, that's going losing pulling 7% preprint. 

This true. I've cited peer reviewed, published papers 7% number. lie math last debate, would need see ~100-fold higher recorded reinfections 7% data hold true.

You tried math failed miserably assumed 7% would re-exposed virus people first exposure. feel bad understand simple disease dynamics made trivial error. argued infections recorded

Actually, no, point time, made major error, dipped conversation. There's little question whether reinfections reported (not recorded, reported). course aren't. None 44 reinfections listed reported. mean reminded already accounted using recorded infections only.

Yes, assumed everybody exposed twice major flaw. juvenile mistake make. 93% people experience immunity least several months SARS-CoV-2 infection.

You're literally trying make argument thread study showed overall 83% immunity reinfection... 94% immunity symptomatic reinfection 75% immunity asymptomatic reinfection. suppose 94% whopping 1% greater 93% got there... isn¬¥t good?

Hopefully actual leadership top less week now, rollout improve. trying stir anything up, title *does* say exact thing. 

I haven‚Äôt gotten virus last 12 months I‚Äôm going change behavior virus infectious. can‚Äôt see less people now, don‚Äôt see anyone. True. infected means transmission... Frig me, end previously common strain Covid would infect 160 people 5 generations transmission. new variant would infect 1000 people time. lockdowns necessary. Look happened Ireland new variant arriving. locked less 1,000 cases day before, suddenly went couple hundred cases day 8,000 day 3 weeks new variant. 

Lockdowns worked many places really strict enough done late. later start, stricter must longer need last. NZ example totally eliminated virus 7 week strict lockdown March-May. thing acted faster second outbreak took 3 weeks lockdown eliminate again. Melbourne took month move lockdown outbreak July took 4 months strict lockdown eliminate that. new variant would take much longer. 

NZ prepared immediately move strictest lockdown level single case escapes border quarantine. Queensland 3 days 1 case escaped system last week. That's way respond new variant. deaths registered U.K. Wales amongst healthy 60 year olds.

I'm seeing 3,968 deaths 60 January 7th file. I'm sure getting 448 number from. Maybe point out. 80-90% hospitalizations fatalities concentrated 12-15% population, 65+ health conditions. estimates 30% overall population already infected.

Vaccinations starting health workers target population. think vaccinations reach 10-15% population start see drop hospitalizations fatalities. take while, efficacy first dose partial takes 10-12 days, 2nd dose, another 10-12 days, etc. see drop-off pretty dramatic. Like fall 80-90%.

Once happens, virus still spreading far less serious. Healthy people 60 really little risk. point think people start relax.

I sure exactly, estimating we'd vaccinate 10% population end January, think sounds little low. think start see pretty good numbers end February.

We also watch Israel way ahead everyone else reportedly vaccinated 70-80% vulnerable population already. think run ahead schedule. like 3-4 weeks think start show benefit. Agree 100%.

You‚Äôre selfish stupid. That‚Äôs horseshit

70-80% asymptomatic people lung damage worse years smoking? lungs damaged you‚Äôre going feel -hence wouldn‚Äôt asymptomatic. 

Absolute fear mongering nonsense Yup, school's started shutting down, work shut offices part gone back. nice first. Now...ehhhh.... One eat work. can't live air light.

Yes, best protect respect safety measures, can't live never ending lockdown. Hopefully dent number deaths hospitalizations surges every holiday. Next public holiday when? time new daily cases start decline.

Go troll someone else, idiot. completely unenforceable court. can‚Äôt sign away rights sue employer made sick. fairness, since seems go up, *always* peak. kids teenagers (&lt;18) low priority list approved vaccines yet proven safe them? please stop calling ‚ÄúBritish mutation/variant?‚Äù discourages naming countries lead prejudice discrimination British people. I'm sorry, fact opened air b&amp;b home let strangers vacation time seems insane me.

I really hope okay, lost father Covid April I'm trying picture could come contact 150+ people current restrictions am.  everything open kind forward facing job hard.  Name shame them. Also report them, hugely illegal. British variant turns unstoppable lockdowns, UK, we'll introduce herd immunity. could done 10 months ago people listened me. OC here.

///////s could mean difference worst behind us versus front us.

Yes, race variants vaccine. vaccine start make dent next couple months. rolled strategically, ie, health care workers, risk populations, mortality could greatly reduced even anything resembling community immunity reached. Lockdowns work. worked last year. problem sustainable.

A lockdown necessary governments fuck badly. put economy people's lives, destroyed both. Maybe time demand punishment them. seems bit exaggerated. 1 3 lot response: ¬Ø\\*(„ÉÑ)*/¬Ø lock downs actually help? mental health economy? take factors consideration passing regulations like this. wish media would stop bringing up. sad died, even related vaccine it‚Äôs rare situation warranting repeated media coverage fans anti vax fears. It‚Äôs pretty huge yep. Walk around tiny village bakery, pub, school, church, you‚Äôll still see different plaques doors independent practice naturopathy/hypnotherapy/etiopathy/osteopathy/etc etc. Also homeopathy huge history due Laboratoires Boiron; many years campaigning it‚Äôs reimbursed social security anymore, many people still believe it. won‚Äôt even cover stupid mouths, they‚Äôre proud it!

They're getting power holding you, me, everyone else. Dear lord. Stop spreading tripe, election over. Guess it‚Äôs time apply instacart job Still wouldn‚Äôt waste 10 months; know lot supportive care improved. Problem would area curve tried flatten currently straight hospitals overrun like places. Really? estimate 1-4 million, currently reported 2 million deaths related COVID, I'd say we're right range. know compare epidemics much changes viruses world.

I agree, though, rarely see Hong Kong flu mentioned, even now. I've heard story doctor. heard anyone else. Care share links? Damn, millions people vaccinated already one would think could peer review safety check results such... does. post sub Reddit time providing misdirection. actually knew would reply didn‚Äôt think record thought elsewhere prove point People comments clearly never country Yellow Fever. common many countries.

This digital version LONG overdue due people faking it. knowledge implemented well depends. Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) prevents worker fired medical condition, including covid. also right return illness over. exceptions, conditions. apply highly-compensated employees example. applies employers 50 employees. qualify protection, employed employer past 12 months. Things bad Amazon state...and lots bats around :-( brings next point, doctor run hospital think could create worlds first fungal vaccine (there‚Äôs fungal vaccines currently passed trials)  statement generally true (and UK considering delaying second shot months), one major caveat:

They (or little) data delays second shot effects efficacy. science behind protocol suggests actually could likely increase efficacy (up amount time), really test Phase3 protocol cannot say SURE.

To clear: I'm advocate trying push many first shots possible (i.e. reserve any), prioritizing getting second shots always go front line. would allow current total supply dictate many first shots happen introducing risk second shot timing complete supply disruption occurred (which unlikely). quick Google search [found majority deaths 1918 pandemic influenza really secondary bacterial pneumonia, apply logic. Report them. Different ages sick. one die sickest survived 30. None fully recovered. coworker died early 40s. think know difference.  Fair enough. It‚Äôs tough parents don‚Äôt choice, however. 23 percent US single parent households Well...just America. countries still responsible need be. We‚Äôre tired dealing government won‚Äôt take action, deal much we‚Äôre able. Atlanta, Benz Stadium started mass vaccination site run March.  well respected journalist organization 

I agree, terrible situation, whatever silly reason, Jewish settlers illegally purchased Palestinian land claim still considered citizens nation Israel. Whereas Palestinians live considered sovereign Palestinian land aren't, getting vaccines responsibility Palestinian Authority/ Fatah West Bank, well Hamas led Government Gaza Strip. Israel Palestinian Authority led Fatah known come agreements regarding issues public health past. Hamas... much...

All Palestinians Israeli citizenship (1,890,000 people roughly 21% Israel's total population) ***are*** included vaccination campaign. vaccinations stay pace increase, likely start seeing drop cases deaths towards end February? Can't mental burdens dead. **Taps head** People risk still occupy spaces people aren't, seems main problem approach  Recent developments Covid-19 pandemic exposed grim reality: keep we‚Äôre prevent infections, we‚Äôre screwed. Well, even That‚Äôs virus appears getting even better infecting us. Since least December, new, contagious variants SARS-CoV-2 virus causes Covid-19 outcompeting earlier versions virus countries far wide Brazil, UK, South advantage new variants carry seems given situation people gathered, they‚Äôll infect people ‚Äî estimated 30 70 percent people case B.1.1.7 variant first identified Britain, identified 50 countries. doubt? Honestly, special kind stupid think China cooperate let world know whole pandemic started. Western countries better realize reality.  See exactly Im talking sign cant get freaking vaccine shot. Like source, community spread area check, schools safely reopen. Oh. honestly unexpected. 

I remember seeing $350K bills start pandemic. I‚Äôm sure hospitals aren‚Äôt going serve someone can‚Äôt pay people insured can. actual regulations real punishments industry afraid bad PR.  think heard they're distracted lockdowns, economic survival, political BS. third picture look like someone broke back?  think also making assumption FDA would approve this. That's assumption I'm questioning. tested positive antibodies Inauguration Day one year anniversary first case Covid 19. can't make stuff up. need able sue people wear masks.

The problem can't prove someone particular gave covid.

What need revision laws judges fine anyone contact prove wearing mask.

So medical bills $100k, two idiots interact without without wearing masks, liable $50k. Let alone risk asymptomatic passing along others. People completely clueless maliciously uncaring ""it affect *me*""=""no problem!!"" camp. agree... hope rush fast long lasting adverse effects. New technology problems. deep history new stuff causing issues removed from. Market later due issues it... Look diet pills 80s basically meth. Look used asbestos supposed best thing since sliced bread. countless others told safe come back later say nah wrong. hope case type vaccine. hate family die this. could lived longer life. One aunt, another grandfather. mourn deaths every day. One got reckless, assisted living home. 

Being healthy adult stayed away older people anyone wished quarantine. isolate avoid friends consequence got covid, along 15-20 guys girls see regularly, decided take risk keep physical training. Nobody complications, purely coincidentally fact healthy extremely active? Either way, that's bro science, healthy okay, underlying conditions, please safe. Again, bro science. 


Here interactive map draw conclusions. scientific findings says U.S. 39 blood donations December 13-16, 2019 showing antibodies people infected June early December 2019. Wuhan hospital cases December 26, 2019.  Covid cause fluid fill sacks lungs. goes away weeks. 

Some people get permanent lung scarring it‚Äôs common. Especially weren‚Äôt hospitalized. US hospitals don‚Äôt refuse hospitalize covid patients unless it‚Äôs warranted. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anywhere US cite example hospital refusing help covid patient based insurance.  person died 10 survivors permanently disabled fully agree Sputnik vaccine certainly credible tool get crisis. really kind thing, pedantic person opening something emotional? It‚Äôs 50% efficacy means would reduce average persons risk getting virus 50% worth noting strain that's circulating Manaus believed virulent, exporting patients critical condition states might spread new strain faster country. Maybe everyone high risk go out. people risk locked down. effect younger healthy people nearly badly.  Lol even writes articles? call journalists? Wow. hate admit, hit nail head. Take upvote. Trying manage anxiety moment, need bounce ideas people dealt hopefully see what's normal make feel better, not, know point becomes serious.

My chest/lungs feel uncomfortable. generally painful, just... off. Kind tight/constricted, like I'm edge cough. Although I'm sitting here, shoulder vaguely hurts. arms/legs random... blips feeling? pain, almost like barely sore muscle/pinched nerve/ touching slight bruise, split second goes away. always different spot. Shoulder, arm, knee, shin. Randomly wherever. Husband mentioned someone covid bunch clots know got lung scan, I'm terrified clots everywhere... I'm left sitting trying figure covid bunch clots, normal concerned, anxiety REALLY kicking in. :S  I've also vaguely lightheaded headache today kind went away day went on. chest muscle stuff still going.

For background: Husband baby last month, roughly 5 weeks old, I'm recovering childbirth top this, dealing pretty solid lack sleep. days born, symptoms, tested positive tested negative. symptoms super obvious, got worse, better, hes recovering. second time I've felt like crap past month, first time mostly sinus - sinus drainage, headache, lightheaded. chest tightness etc now, freaking I'm terrified clots everywhere something. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

Done here. good rest day.   imagining yet. busy judging him. 

(Not think anything wrong judging him, expect able sympathize time. Unless, course, bit split personality yourself. maybe easy sympathize judge time.)

Imagine beliefs. Imagine based that, thinking whole time right thing. Imagine later (this probably happened yet, may never happen, actually, guess probably point) realize mistaken. would truly horrible feeling.

Anyway, suppose summed said ""for mental health issues"" -- that's large part I'm talking about.

Also, statement nothing illegality behavior, seem focused on. Although, course, mental health considered decide fit stand trial not. really care happens yet. I'm still dumbfounded happening. smh... THIS.

So many people given shit wearing cloth masks (they filters replace daily) saying wearing surgical masks protect better. Surgical masks replacing least day multiple times day. box 20 cheap shelling kind money every week new box surgical masks. friend trusted part extended bubble, friend over. like, family takes kids grandparents childcare. people live different houses part extended bubble. I'm sure people didnt get worked earlier, definitely doable. cant trust 99.9% people, 1 2 extra people bubble partner. bubble together. homes. occasional dinner movie nights. think armed insurrection transition power pressing matter. young, died something else. Exactly, COVID overall worsened anxiety going reddit made even worse point started panic attacks whenever went outside people touched me.

Sometimes it‚Äôs better mental health take break rona news wish would put executive order. gets worse day day   scary. Espically asking people give rational one refuted it. Well sucks true. hope human beings dont feel way  minor testing I‚Äôve seen Texas. open DC I‚Äôll it. main one seems safe two months(I skeptical first amount red tape cut it‚Äôs turned fine). Maybe patents opened kind philanthropic effort get vaccine everyone would fair. stands, companies making billions dollars vaccine least could actually pay workers. Argentina. Although mostly based politics, unfortunately. People oppose current government turned anti-vaxx oppose whatever government does. Except hospitals overflow reach capacity every single year. Acording conclusion, might well forever completely ignore detrimental effects past ten months society. economy crashed, dozens different sectors bankrupted, children lost year education social development crucial stages lives, increased use plastics, increased pollution, increased starvation, increase suicides, overdoses domestic violence. *can't get anywhere them, let alone vote* pointless rhetoric. words matter far actions taken them. shit McConnell saying would support impeachment bring vote action keep Senate session.

They impeachment articles drafted Hillary Trump Presidency, difference rhetoric now, threat. chinese bot lives middle Amazon rainforest. Totally right, clever person... Everyone burnt out. Even strict covid protocol people. People thought vaccine approved starting vaccinate people, going finally end. NOPE! reports everywhere vaccines sitting around, used states well goals vaccination rates.

The government every level.. local/state/national, woefully unprepared every step pandemic past year. failed us, plain simple. like this, short pictures, understandable.  mean look get it, you‚Äôre healthy young otherwise post viral fatigue actually pretty rare. pay attention you‚Äôll see percentages LOOK high people suffering ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù taken groups hospitalized really small. 

So get it, manage anxieties little better put perspective. also think world going start opening back spring summer. it‚Äôs best work now. first thing doctors China noticed, unusual lung damage. 

Months ago doctor commented lungs asymptomatic people COVID scuba divers saying could never dive again. check interest diving. divers idea lung damage would make dive dangerous.

We know extent asymptomatic cases generally get chest x-rays, etc. we‚Äôre honest, don‚Äôt expect anyone react way dead relative/loved one stranger. course would react strongly something directly affects you. wouldn‚Äôt you? That‚Äôs human nature, shouldn‚Äôt excuse part help general community. sitting unused thought entire supply planned used? 

In case MS looks lot better states, bad problem compared states expire can‚Äôt even tell many things learned adult really should‚Äôve learned school. straight student, read textbooks cover cover spare time. covered I‚Äôd known it.

Edit add another example: found 2 years ago stamp act was. heard name, obviously American history book didn‚Äôt even go detail tax stamps &amp; teacher joke. Naw dems hammer disagreements get shit done. need run right more. moderates thrown bone 2 progressives obstructionist get shit passed. West Virginia pulled remarkable faaaiiirrrrr I'm definitely doctor, damage smoking pretty different damage caused Covid? layman's understanding exposure smoke causes direct irreversible damage walls alveoli, whereas Covid damages lungs immune system's inflammatory response. alveoli become inflamed filled liquid, walls damaged way. Covid thought common inflammation go fluids clear time infection treated, eventually alveoli restore function. Whereas toxins smoke exposure damage alveoli walls, can't regenerated there's permanent reduction function.

I'm probably missing ton details here, I'd love someone ELI5 I'm wrong. country buying SinoPharm vaccine, 79% effective, approved? people country outraged buying chinese vaccine continue live life (work school), make sacrifices you‚Äôre able greater good, practice basic prevention methods (masks, distancing, hand washing) minimize risk still everything need family survive thrive. Sure, family priority isn‚Äôt either/or, all/nothing situation. Pregnant people eligible NJ according expanded rules.  Says article transmission doesn‚Äôt affect vaccine ability halt transmission, also doesn‚Äôt really provide solid evidence past covid infection still means transmit Absolutely. guess freezers full bodies even convince people, nothing will.

Or caring healthcare workers. I'm sorry 400k people dead US alone, attitude pure ignorance. personally know anyone died volcanic eruption either, still believe exist. covid patients likely make given treatment first place. US protocol place? Must come Ohio State frat house. Here‚Äôs best explanation could find. I'm Florida. thing, heard it. 

As far know said health insurance cover costs.

Not everyone gets health insurance.

They never removed responsibility patient. still one us get insurance, however (too late qualify enrollment). Awesome. Thank you! referred ""insane"". mentioned ""on 21st"". What's 21st buckaroo? Yeah, that‚Äôs definitely concern. feeling people around take it, airlines require show you‚Äôve taken it, employers require it, might change mind know, countries like Germany thing called constitution, least attempt fair society. know see disadvantage want doors welded up, developed countries usually like that. can't ruin people's lives (the effective consequence 20k euro debt people) minor violations (that certainly teach scum use mask right), also, can't run law parliament consider ""urgent"". know, bunch pussies right, study story country might find clue things like that.

If like it, may suggest moving Phillipines Indonesia, shoot drug users, death penalty, stuff like that. would absolutely love Duterte's Covid policy. would need lock every animal Earth also. Otherwise reservoir always ready re-infect soon lockdown ends. Yeah, won‚Äôt happen. one, even staunch pro-lockdown crowd, going wear masks social distance another decade. hasn‚Äôt even year people fed it. would much rather prefer pay $40 couple neck gaiters wear wash months months opposed $40 worth surgical masks, would last month half so. 

Also, sheer amount garbage many masks would produce sustained period time extremely putting. wear disposables, I‚Äôd wearing one literally fell apart (and, even then, I‚Äôd probably try repair finally threw out). 

Gloves worse, though. God, this, hope vinyl latex gloves disappear won‚Äôt much worthless, purposeless garbage generated. think functions RNA mRNA really well understood 70s. probably make way pre-secondary science curriculum 90s later, schools using textbooks much older that. unreasonable covered, especially someone went school 80s/90s even early 2000s. Georgia Arkansas worst vaccination rates country.

That's percentage vaccines allotted. Arkansas really bad. state, bottom five vaccination rates according Bloomberg (congrats Mississippi moving list):

Alabama

Nevada

Georgia

South Carolina

California case anyone curious, 1.1 million votes Los Angeles County 2020, 27% vote.
That's quite Midwest states combined.

But yes, actual issues causing lot deeper ""red vs blue"". No. Religion makes reasonable people unreasonable things. every American heard that, guarantee every American actually agrees that.. many people still think hyped flu numbers lie someone KNOW actually dies doesn‚Äôt affect us considering time vaccine widespread we‚Äôll probably know transmit even vaccination Thats exactly opposite highly informed though. point. 

At time, im sure people think blanket statements like ""everyone highly informed"" ""every single American knows..."" acceptable. Making generalizations isnt really helpful make point. 

Most many? Sure. Every single American? lots Americans simply believe conspiracy, think deaths falsely attributed, think blown proportion, dont think masks work, stay home.

Thinking every single american ""knows basics"" false. plenty heads sand, many actively disagree basic facts. ability mutate, flu actually much worse COVID regard potential long-term harm. actually nastier virus outright, COVID much, much worse us right natural immunity. Every virus ""entry fee,"" preying huge reservoir hosts immunity greater susceptibility disease. pandemic COVID's entry fee.

You build immunity viruses throughout life vaccines natural infection. catch flu, similar strain something past, probably much milder. However, flu constantly mutating, immune response spot on. Then, every get strain people's immune systems can't handle, causes pandemic like H1N1 swine flu (but even swine flu substantial partial immunity, leading low IFR).¬†


Once everyone form immunity, COVID likely regarded similarly endemic coronaviruses, mild cold. That's also evident well children handle COVID. Children's immune systems quite good novel viruses. start life without natural immunity, they're naturally equipped die exposure new viruses (though obviously viruses/pathogens still deadly children, hence childhood mortality bad modern hygiene). lose ability get older immune systems get weaker, part COVID mortality strong age dependency.


Flu still nastiest virus widely circulating western world, around long us dealt children vvaccination. ability mutate really reason problem even today. No. Ummm... Yes, knew this.  worst part covid fatal. many cases little symptoms many people recover despite stats people shrug think fine get know many people survived it. death rate like 20%, ironically, might less total deaths. work, there‚Äôs bunch people laugh it. many gotten came back stories bad cough day two kid wasn‚Äôt even bothered it. One guy move schedule couple weeks. Nobody talking he‚Äôs gonna die gotta find replacement. He‚Äôs like 58 years old small team 5.

Another guy talked cousin cousin‚Äôs family gotten it, including 70 year old mother/grandma, got fine.

We still precautions people tell put mask you‚Äôre wearing it. we‚Äôre getting paycheck gotta follow company rules. Otherwise, it‚Äôs joke part.  I'm taking wall, I? üôÑ
I literally told diversity discussions point views pandemic governments say i'm binary mindset? Give break Serious question, something like contained shield filters like painter might wear gas mask?

I assume filters stop things small virus? filters available like that. Kind like sci-fi helmet vibe. also regularly see doctors nurses smoking outside hospitals ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø never understood it. see first-hand damage, yet still do. Yeah, know sucks. wish ticket everyone once. try trust process. keep 1 person covid hospital bed someone needs reasons use it, call win. Like aunt arthritis hips surgery cancelled beds full. live constant pain months end. sure one buckaroo. Nobody position file impeachment Dems. become clear soon, unlikely people vaccinated spread virus. say hospital administrators get bonus year instead give nurses money thank you? starting come idea continue wearing masks even herd immunity.

""Experts say expect wear masks year possibly 2022, coming back community flares virus, NPR reported."" No, covid hospital treatment covered Act, believe... can‚Äôt recall details. May don‚Äôt think so. Sometimes it‚Äôs say, it‚Äôs *how say it*. Tone delivery important getting message across.

Maybe could tell dad worried hospitalized. shows love care health also driving home seriousness illness. say sincerity, reacts dismissively don‚Äôt take personally. I‚Äôm sure worried too, people don‚Äôt like show weakness that‚Äôs raised. cOntAgIoUs (seems pretty contagious someone else flies plane I'm side fucking building) shit dies I‚Äôm planning picking martial art combat sport, boxing ask? Shit, poor circulation going kill me? Even pre pandemic working 15hrs week, hands feet skin temps almost room temperature. although I‚Äôm healthy weight I‚Äôm one super cut guys, generically athletic.

If poor circulation doesn‚Äôt get me, anxiety driven tachycardia lol  pharmacist doesn‚Äôt understand mRNA ‚Äúhe thought would change DNA‚Äù really shouldn‚Äôt practice all. That‚Äôs like bio 101. fucking moron. love got downvoted question. vaccine side effects occasionally. That‚Äôs ok talk about. 

She didn‚Äôt history allergies. already Covid summer, maybe complicated it? 

She really weird muscle spasms made feel like walking wasn‚Äôt moving, basically. She‚Äôs fine now. mom also got - they‚Äôre healthcare - seems fine. first dose far. No, he's angel named Castiel. Pay attention, wouldja?! people going suffer choices anti-vaxxers people cannot vaccine due allergies etc. heard trialing option might work people group, hopefully able protected. would awful want vaccine much rest us still risk cohort people refuse it. Like Walter White later episodes breaking bad! Post shaved head, became really bad Walt. friend. Tested positive one day, gf lives not. Got another test following week, negative. mom, see first result, tested positive. 

We assume *probably* positive, difficult know. CDC lost credibility told people wear masks March credibility years.

I get it, rock hard place. Telling people needed wear masks would meant run supplies needed frontline workers. Trump administration would supported CDC messaging asking us buy N95 masks make due cloth mask punitive measures protect supplies. decided lie try prevent run masks work made look like malicious fools.

Now getting told cloth mask effectiveness inflated everyone switching KN95 masks another blow credibility. Question.

If super antibodies destroy virus, ever harbor enough asymptomatic contagious? /r/exmormon would place look actually suggests masks *less* effective thought American mortician, want say us *do* still care much trying hard curb pandemic. support government... makes difficult appear though *are* trying *do* care, even though literally millions us do. 

Right peeing section swimming pool every turn. States left handle mandates states requiring masks others not. 

Just please assume morons America. Many us respect science care want pandemic end. like people need someone family die see severity. That's scary af. heal time (like, years, most)? don‚Äôt know honestly, would guess they‚Äôre higher risk pump shit lungs every day could wrong. livid, better even try shit state  Makes sense goal keeping people ICU. Nice sermon.

For distribution probability infections, correct, however. greed, doubt. density problem people getting kids business people tourists connecting viral nests. call greed, highly detrimental behaviour.

The wild animal reservoirs work animals enough contact, terms spatial density frequency - assuming narrative negligible fomite transmission real. Industrial livestock farming problem epidemics, though. Surgical masks 50 $4 eBay... that‚Äôs 8 cents each, cheaper Wendy‚Äôs 4 4 meal. one turd $hitshow days. Sir, Coronavirus sub, worldnews geopolitcs measles didn‚Äôt end us, neither rona would shit get COVID end kind damage long took finally quit smoking. watched youtube video doctor Cambell presented study, try find it.

I found one part talking asthma  Although sure thing there's plenty evidence need that. Wrong.   government represents population largely relying homemade cloth masks instead standardized masks certified qualified government body.

So... definitely US.

Ran ear loop surgical masks husband bought Nov 2019 pretty quick sending mom, giving older neighbors.

Plus great collection now, helped small business owners across country buying respect appreciation staff saved cared them? realize they‚Äôve try keep people alive? cloth masks particles almost 97% medical masks 44%.

I take medical masks better still half effective protecting yourself. false positives testing sports leagues past year players test positive negative 5 days straight look actually happening though. Right around 2.3 million doses available California, cover 1.15 million people, assuming 2 dose per person series. population California 40 million.

You can't address everyone right now, can't quite time enough doses available yet. Cases going immediately disappear. People still quite time, people still hospitalized, front line health care workers exposed virus many months next year. quick label dismiss people like that. 

The difficult-to-admit truth safety, wellbeing happiness family important idea ""greater good"" society. recognize illogical theory whats good goose good gander. end day, choice family society, choose family. lot people, means going work. Kids going school. living like we're nuclear doomsday.

Everybody different circumstances. lived alone cat way make money home, would awfully easy ""stay home save lives."" got kids, family members depend you, anything like risk calculus changes quite bit. weighing risk Covid risk losing livelihood. psychological risk children. damage children missing important developmental milestones.

It's easy tell people live, cast shame meeting expectations. Reality far nuanced that. Maybe good answers. We're bunch imperfect people trying best can. It‚Äôs perfect. specialist visit cost $300 hour co pay, depending specialist. We‚Äôre covered something like 10 free psychology appointments year. Family doctor $40 visit earn $24k year, definite problems. 

Some medical tests super painful. (But kept hundreds, thousands)

All blood tests free.

Health insurance cover things can‚Äôt get Medicare $300 month.

Fortunately medications top $30 month, government picks rest.

It‚Äôs mixed bag, yes, urgent care really well covered. Except know case everyone ""on side.""

Many people rejecting evidence risky is. ""Every death COVID death.""

They've made risks involved measures combat pandemic: ""Masks make breath CO2 kill you."" 

And top off, vote bunch people done anything mitigate risks involved economic restrictions.

So, sure, there's one universal risk assessment, assessed risk differently.

(And without even discussing whole risk assessment focused entirely themselves. might healthy 30 year old, grocer craning neck around plastic barrier talk without mask lives 74 year old diabetic.) feel like we've hard time getting people come shots, tbh. hospital work pretty large number people vaccinated nearly enough. lines slowed trickle. almost keep thinking  better question: people still wearing masks? never tested vaccines see prevent transmission. still know that. data shows prevents severity illness. immediately prioritized risk based data. Thank God Mississippi actually lived China would know Wuhan local government lied hid outbreak. central government fired local leaders sent army take care virus. competent haven‚Äôt allowed investigations origins virus. It‚Äôs almost like might something hide? Lol good luck. Heath safety (health wellness? Idk) *massive* company. Might well scream pillow would interesting, however, imagine counter-factual simply vaccinated whomever wanted age 50+ two months, lower 40+ using Walgreens/CVS, etc. Israel doing?

Israel strictly 65+. 

The US 100 million people age 50, start vaccination enough doses fully vaccinate 20 million. first come first serve, doses would gone younger physically fit people better able navigate online appointment systems wait hours-long lines.

And don‚Äôt imagine would look like state went strictly age start- that‚Äôs exactly Florida did. they‚Äôve firmly middle pack terms percentage doses they‚Äôve administered. understanding even overly optimistic rollout, still predictions vaccinating 100M March, especially vaccines get approved. suspect decent number population vaccine skeptics (10-20%), decent number (about 25%) population children aren‚Äôt given vaccine yet, prediction option getting vaccine March April. Yeah, got get that. I‚Äôve working speedwalking city parks, feel terrible walking elderly people don‚Äôt mask on, glasses.  Last time checked, car crashes often involve two cars least - guess look crashes trees point stands! real facts scaring public compliance, maybe best interests comply don‚Äôt think tuning out. think holding pattern. There‚Äôs nothing left sit home wait vaccinated. 

Once enough receive it, slowly hell end. solution. part, seems like everyone decided game plan.

Oklahoma State Department Health Gov.

Are kidding me, Kevin Stitt? ridiculous thing done yet! can't believe even agreed this. Somehow Stitt thought good idea case rate (even pediatric rate) skyrocketing right now. can't believe this. ultimately disgusting levels. Good grief, Oklahoma! data Oxford vaccine, experts (JCVI) made decision. surprise, you‚Äôre maximum immunity week 2nd dose. first dose doesn‚Äôt provide maximum immunity. infection curves Dakotas result natural decline covid cases following severe outbreaks, vaccines time. enough people vaccinated point make much difference.

B)attempt contact tracing

Unfortunately usually reduce shy hospitals overwhelmed. fear you‚Äôre somewhat correct, lockdowns don‚Äôt feel productive. Better mitigation though. would suggest? psych, meds (oh lord meds). can‚Äôt read anymore, hell barely watch tv certainly can‚Äôt play video game. can‚Äôt think well enough focus.

Fauchi part Trump administration said beginning masks didn‚Äôt work.
I specifically remember decided ignore since already wearing mask working school system. Fauchi either said wear masks one reasons 1) trying save masks hospital workers rush masks public making hard find masks. 2) Trump pushed say masks it‚Äôs visible sign pandemic, downplaying first half year. 3) mistaken.

We already plenty studies done water droplets masks. played safe either bent knee sent bad information help hospitals. Imo told people wear mask shutdowns wouldn‚Äôt are.

I know Reddit loves gloss reason Fauchi boy (just like Mueler Comey dropped ball websites eyes.)
However, Fauchi Trump government told Americans wear mask. ‚Äúdon‚Äôt buy them, make them‚Äù ‚Äúwait evidence‚Äù ‚ÄúWait till hospitals get first.‚Äù Etc etc.
He literally said wear mask. back back weeks later say ‚Äúwear mask‚Äù people won‚Äôt hear you, listen you, change original beliefs helped create.

If someone told didn‚Äôt need take vitamins over, one day says take vitamins, bet many people hesitant listen. Ohhh used capital letters now. Yeah right, totally argument now. needs go away pandemic. said social interaction need--innate, immutable. Yet next sentence say people stupid selfish trying take care human need. think adds up. tbh think sad can't even consistently vaccinate least million people per day, given month since began rollout. Glad I'm one whose first thought holy shit, bill gonna crazy! Good old USA... 11,148,991 doses administered US. 

The big part though 1,225,493 vaccinated LTCF compared 1,080,000 yesterday. WV Dakotas indication, 5% vaccinated makes dent. 

things probably start plummet till hit 45-50 million first doses though  Something widely reported hospitalization *rate*, like many hospitalizations cases. think falling steadily beginning, think 2 reasons, younger healthier people found virus via testing, we're getting better treating it.

But see eyeballing fatality charts too. Like New York, initial peak cases per day 10k currently 15k. original peak fatalities per day 1000 200. lag, cases 50% higher fatalities far 80% lower.

So simply focusing cases really meaningful. 538 great article Right on! Yes authoritative govt would likely lie surprise. yes unbelievable. Agreed also look what's working along throwing money it. Yeah, we're also starting ramp 2nd doses CDC tracks first doses. Probably closer 1m now. example, home state MD reported 13k first doses 3k second doses today.  I'm lowly pleb would make sense tax tax-money given people? give less. think regions out-of-control rampant spread that's threatening hospital system (like SoCal). Right patients grave conditions told wait surgeries major procedures ICU critical care staffing limited. dad grandpa may able put coronary vascular surgery couple weeks 2 3 months out. website itself, keeping track personally every time goes million gets reported such. news articles one well  decrease transmissions get rid disease itself
The moment restrictions loosens huge spikes point? 10,000 covid deaths, *half* US, country makes ~5% population.

People dying old age isn‚Äôt choice. *chosing* let millions people die worldwide collective ineptitude **They did** since excluded possibilities based vague notion ""probably work"". That's choice. origin estimation could possibly email tror att viruset kommer att svepa fram som en storm √∂ver Sverige och smitta princip alla p√• en eller tv√• m√•nader/‚Ä¶/Jag tror det redan finns tusentals smittade Sverige./‚Ä¶/Det hela upph√∂r n√§r s√• m√•nga blivit smittade och sedan immuna s√• att viruset inte har n√•gonstans att ta v√§gen (kallas ‚Äôherd immunity‚Äô)‚Äù Okay sure, seeing insane comment was? Firstly, implying ""deniers"" way untruthful personal experiences? second, whole thing sounds like ""I wish worse could right talk bad is."" 870,000 vaccines distributed one day. Could better. 

Other day 1.25 million reported due backlog, U.S. generally stuck range around 600K 900K.  excuse lots shops Etsy sell Plastic Shield Mask. put head plastic comes cloth mask. me, kinda effect hearing Im fan crowded stores. seen many variations shield mask. drawback id foggy rainy.

if someone gets first dose vaccine, frist second dose get infected covid

does vaccine offset symptoms covid degree useless without second dose? fuck supposed relax know existing could killing coworkers mom whatever without even knowing it?

Read, play video game, exercise, learn instrument, cook, clean room, meditate, call friend, watching sport, etc. 

If none things allowing relax, see psych. CDC publishes data completely final data 2020 couple would look carefully articles though lot people trying use make one point another. Like they'll take preliminary numbers 2020 compare complete numbers 2019 draw conclusions. relationship population density Covid-19 death death rates matter measure well country protected health citizens. Covid-19 isn‚Äôt type death matters. 

And absolute safety isn‚Äôt thing life matters either. certainly isn‚Äôt meaning life. Community, family, culture, civil liberties, etc also contribute quality life right. Quality life also matters, quantity.

That said, yes, expect July 2021 able go parties, go restaurants, bars, movie theaters, see families, travel domestically little restrictions. I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôm wrong. find who‚Äôs right 5 6 months.

Interesting. least happy better though? :D choose herd immunity strategy context says. get 60% 70% vaccinated stalls out? never reach 80% vaccinations?

In ideal world would wait 80% threshold too. think we're going get 80% people willing get vaccinated. start thinking **real world**, ideal outcome. said take makes angry. someone terminal cancer fell cliff, die fall cancer? sick people lost cause now? Someone lung cancer could another 5 years got covid theyre dead. make sure say died *with* covid, it. Fuck noise. yet, half effective benefit helps reduce covid transmission drastically! stupid debate 0% chance I‚Äôm wearing mask hit vaccination goals. actually read article? thing people would done needed do, France wouldn‚Äôt mess right now. wonder created waitlist consisting local teachers 50 years could alerted open slots? get vaccinating random customers better wasting vials, given want kids return in-person instruction earlier rather later, think someone command chain would prioritizing leftover shots? Well think good news gives flexibility people get 2nd shot helps logistics.

Imagine effectiveness disappeared 30 days something. would absolutely get 2nd shot then. they're saying take months later. 1 dose 2 dose phase 3? stupidity led us 9 months mask debates. Yes they're better patients, act like provide benefits wearer pure idiocy. meant fully protective?? No. That's n95 masks exist ""Get back work, go lives, wear mask.""  Constant propaganda.

I can't help wonder many people start question system demands growth productivity matter what. 

Finite resources infinite growth trainwreck waiting happen. GOP made clear choice relentless productivity people's lives, choose former. mask destructive unstable system is, many learned way.

Or Mark Fisher put it, ""it's easier imagine end world end capitalism."" puzzled.

Looking original press release upon article based, titled 

**[""Past COVID-19 infection provides immunity people may still carry transmit Financial Times' headline (and article) skips half infected COVID-19 past likely protected reinfection several months, Public Health England (PHE) study found, although **experts cautioned immunity may still able carry virus nose throat therefore risk transmitting ""We know virus, developed antibodies, protected reinfection, total yet know long protection lasts. **Crucially, believe people may still able pass virus on.**"" Yay Oregon! First all, virus isn‚Äôt way die.

Compare Canada Sweden.

Sweden 954 deaths per million Covid-19, lightest changes behavior.
Canada 453 Covid-19 deaths per million, quite authoritarian response. looks like Canada‚Äôs response saved lives right? half Covid-19 deaths per capita Sweden.

Until look excess death percentages overall.

Sweden 5.9 percent excess deaths causes including Covid.
Canada 9.33 percent excess deaths causes.

So Sweden significantly better job keeping citizens safe, despite almost twice rate Covid-19 deaths per capita.

You guys getting lockdowns? Darn don‚Äôt shop there. Guess I‚Äôll wait Basically, I'm US Ireland entered 3rd lockdown. already responsible masks, hand washing social distancing that's pretty much do.

I've stopped watching government/HSE press conferences announce numbers affected age groups depressing stage No. I‚Äôm looking link saying it‚Äôs false people spread virus vaccination. dont know they're prosecuted company makes it.

There's much false information going around here. make ignorant choice saying masks nothing fine every day harass people wearing masks.

Opinions facts different things. opinion can't facts. Peer reviewed data discoveries belief opinion, facts best know. there's lot word around PA masks nothing virus hoax sorts bull s*it. people around really like businesses actively enforce masks much bother wear one.

and spread grows fairly certain exposed work. person who's chair backs mine (and frequently conversations office) came work fever cough worked entire shift. also know sure exposed church lockdown. least dozen people end hospital testing positive probably least two dozen symptoms need hospitalization. ran fever probably half day similar symptoms everyone else. bet, I'd say 80-85% chance it. Back March testing anyone unless fever and/or needed hospitalized. time fever condition anything sit couch wish death. Kind of, bit really. Paris sidewalks front restaurants overrun people enjoying drinks food to-go. understand they're moving curfew forward (to attempt stop w/o actually shuttering restaurants), sure I'm fan... That's good way put it. Even 95% rate could depend typical viral doses received - trial conducted somewhere without masks NPI's, might get different numbers. makes hard comparing trials.

There new data Israel suggesting 50% efficacy preventing positive tests. would nice see average viral load via CT values too, think published.

Pending information, guess I'm assuming congress good degree vaccination protection, came time prevent worse outcome here. ? work tech, fairly common. big tech businesses kicked workers, already setup working remotely, knew bad viral effects might be.

Heck, lost one co-worker COVID, another coma six weeks. really early though, lockdown. Really though? cause every fucking channel part every discussion days.

The guy brought office even acknowledge him, let alone offer apology infected/hospitalized.

When came back everyone wore mask two weeks said fuck stopped wearing them. 

One guys dodged high risk dying gets still wear mask. guy hospitalized infected fiance kids wear one ""the CDC says immune 6 months"" which, fucking don't.

But live Sydney, Australia. Getting Covid-19 approaching parity odds struck lightning.

(Sure, fined wearing mask public transport public buildings recent rule still quite rare actually happen. people also complying well.) ""magic number"" mean theoretical threshold herd immunity, simply number yet.

Herd immunity calculated based efficacy towards sterilizing immunity, protection disease.

Many family members hospitalized I'm pretty sure mentioned 2 deaths now. get tested weeks ago due covid exposure.

The end doctor's recommended quarantine coming friday. wants return office Monday next week. WORK FUCKING INSURANCE. I've working home around 2 months 5 months office 3 months working home. Yeah, quarantined, returned, we're back quarantining

I'm predicting going want us start coming back again. I'm going flat refuse say IDGAF I'm returning till shit's over. asthma, aint dying fucking job, life/health property/casualty insurance related. 

I'm fucking flabbergasted woman doing. Agreed. need stop gatekeeping get focus increasing supply distribution. california metropolitan area probably. Catching twice exceedingly rate proven all. happened? Maybe, 5 confirmed. Beyond that, essentially immune best science able confirm. becomes proven, I'll adjust response kind. slippery slope. deny people one unhealthy behavior, end? diabetics eat much sugar?

Do really want ban cigarettes? alcohol marijuana? really world want live in, drug cartels black markets? intermittent reports small outbreaks China past months. suspect acting like first publically admitted new cases lock downs since initial Wuhan, that's clearly case. Yeah, think even Trump didn‚Äôt say anything, shot foot many times would likely position mistrust Interesting ""it's taking long"" effectively ""reasoning"" (excuse) people using en masse finally start wriggling lockdown precautions.. Despite fact many complaining ""sick"" lockdowns, also ones went way try ""shame"" people anti lockdown.. ""2 years long"" might make much sense you, ""2 months long"" made someone financially emotionally destitute. working home compared white folks. also likely worse access healthcare. hope so. think really started coming online recently states moving age brackets. Also mass vaccination centers starting come online that's exciting you‚Äôd rather quickly, risk giving limited vaccines people already antibodies? others go without? 

I see point supply longer issue though Every major city needs large, 24/7 vaccine location. Sports stadium something else central city. Personnel appointment times still seems holdup. testing sites convert vaccine sites. Private companies volunteer/get paid send nurses large vaccination sites help. concerned play fire new vaccine resistant variant appear. bad could much worse.

I live Czechia. months ago among least infected. argue worst infection per capita. 

This scary.  almost impossible determine vaccine. usually autopsies. Gotta enough produced

China do. patients would likely even survive haircut. reason suspect vaccine dangerous ordinary people. basically honor system. Friends telling friends took advantage already got first shots follow shot scheduled. mean that's great..the merrier, shots meant healthcare worker. You... know flu season, right? Also, common cold still there.... and.... lots viruses...

Why everything automatically considered covid? There‚Äôs huge difference ‚Äúnot *my* President‚Äù ‚Äúnot *the* President‚Äù ‚ù§ Please know alone. Even know personally they, you, people care. IIRC September, CDC estimated 0.6%. possible better treatments lowered fatalities little. all. could, far I'm concerned, definitely done e.g. Norway educational institutions closed organized sports activities discontinued.  number events businesses closed, including cultural events, sports events, gyms swimming pools. establishments hospitality industry bars, pubs clubs serving food close, establishment serving food would ensure visitors could stay least 1 meter apart.  professionals working patient care prohibited traveling abroad 20 April 2020. ban applied business travel private travel.  returned trips outside Sweden Finland since 27 February quarantine, regardless whether showed symptoms not.  travel strongly discouraged. Directorate discouraged travelling work unless strictly necessary encouraged avoiding public transport possible, well avoiding crowded places.  requested visit others institutions vulnerable groups (the elderly, psychiatry, prison etc.) generally encouraged limiting close contact others.  public transport schedule run normal, ensure people critical social functions could get work able distance other.  16 March, non-residents banned entering  19 March, residents prohibited staying cabins outside home municipalities, order avoid putting strain rural medical infrastructure. People suspected confirmed infected must follow stricter home isolation rules. government established fines people violating home quarantine home isolation rules organizing events.

That's extreme let's say China/Wuhan Italy people hanging balconies get fresh air (which might necessary time - I'm saying anything that). thought Covid deaths frail old, without vaccine? Smh might lived 2-10 years longer without Vaccine. Spot on. spot on, right? (If read data right) That‚Äôs scary chicago. MIL oxygen since april. lungs completely damaged. severe case ventilation 19 days. Old people make deaths, obviously prioritized. time, disagree strategy Norwegian government. Patients frail short life expectancy vaccinated. DNR, get it. Many patients would receive antibiotics bacterial pneumonia. changing rules, individual doctor charge patient, think good. dude good track record? makes sense, public transportation means people cannot go work - including nurses doctors Well smokers also way likely die covid compared you. goal alleviate hospitals morgues technically get vaccine sooner healthy old adult. x3 money thanks dude, also afraid didnt put much level retardation involved train thought absolutely mind blowing. Even source trying tell you‚Äôre attempting:

‚ÄúThe AAP believes number reported COVID-19 cases children likely undercount children‚Äôs symptoms often mild, may tested every illness.‚Äù

Deaths ACTUAL cases hugely important metric (i.e., governmental organizations trying come estimates). Deaths REPORTED cases disease children never even know completely pointless. literally tells nothing. curfew 6pm (Ardennes FR) 3 weeks incidence stopped increasing stable around 280. Everywhere curfew worse. Sounds kinda like western business owners hiding cases try best avoid shut downs, capitalism everywhere guess lol  social media got drinking, get social media. give hazard pay working around lunatics miss movie theaters shitty movies great popcorn. majority cares (in US) much, since somewhere around 40% country supports Trump polls. sounds like depression. online therapy options. work work? Lol exactly what‚Äôs happening office. That‚Äôs crazy, already deaths family would take seriously. many stupid people honestly. Hope doing? brother asked groomsman wedding. said ok thinking would small thing immediate family course want support brother. back looking supportive finding around 150 people flying various states. also got chain text planning bachelor party turning renting house 15 people involves lot bar hopping I‚Äôm guessing... can‚Äôt believe I‚ÄôM one struggling look like asshole. Right, really need decade debauched hedonism this.

Be careful wish for. ""weimar mentality"" beginning. infection estimate site seems really lower end. study suggests 1 8 infections gets detected. indication Sweden might 35-40% immunity. even Pfizer vaccine bought? Vaccines grow trees. even vaccine less year due financing vaccine development rich countries.

The European Union opted joint procurement rich poor countries get vaccines time. EU also initiated international project called Covax deliver 2 billion doses poor countries end 2021. Following approval, first deliveries due February. 

Neither US China participate Covax. China using vaccines promote geopolitical influence. UK US able get early deliveries ahead countries due emergency approvals.  hopefully never do. 380,000 Americans dead, ‚Äúbest response could hoped for‚Äù

Not even gonna try choose words better one?  right? makes happy working home (should fully remote position start), makes sad &amp; Heartbroken millions caught it, 400,000 confirmed deaths US, countless people going catch it, somehow terrifyingly large percentage still argue basic precautions force others harms way. 

Really freaking sad, demonstrates people actively work best interests, literally reason. attest here‚Äôs video proof. Thanks, friend üòä People care anymore. want about. must make vaccinating every one #1 national priority. hire train many people vaccinate. Line people give shot. Yeah. I've occasionally, feel same. need prioritize types things though bring frustration level some. article: "" ‚ÄúCalifornia middle surge look hospitalizations deaths, see 75% deaths individuals 65 older,‚Äù said California Surgeon General Dr. Nadine Burke Harris. ""

The mortalilty percentage Ventura County 90% 65 older, balance split 30's 50's early 60's. like old pneumonia mortality rate, less due modern medical intervention. 75%. 90%. 

But said below, Ventura suffering life molasses. last sentence hit nail head. However, think Trump source mistrust institutions, rather symptom. whole election 2016 people confidence establishment.

The best thing Biden, Fauci, etc. restore confidence actually start consistent. argued back october lockdowns answer, yet government Fauci issued / encouraged shut downs. people expected trust institutions institutions trust themselves? Restrictions distrust people super fatigued one shopper per customer, change exposed, also decreases number people exposed. got first dose vaccine today.

I know we've got long way go first time months feel hopeful. Thank you! Like said I'm good now. bounce back game strong AF lol GF really help made feel loved safe secure needed bad beyond grateful thankful her. really best thing happen together year would pop question. still soon ask things go like another year I'll probably ask marry me.

2020 made see humans selfish, care others. since deleted lot people life, family well, offer anything positive life. circle small people circle know trust life. actually 2020 tore built back stronger mentally. Look another job can. obviously care safety others. That's thing, never come that. Why? wont COVID, kill someone? told New Zealand ""model"" country world.

Hopefully notifies promptly new info registering vaccinations.      
   
       
Fun facts:  
Population LA county 10,004,300.  
It would 10th populous state itself.   
   
The big job ahead them. quite people prefer term sewist, learned fellow volunteers. technically word, language ever evolving. vaccinated person trials vaccine hospitalized, one ""severe"" case (the trials different criteria) blood oxygen fall 93. sample size tiny protection severe disease seems strong. That's weeks second dose though.

There visible bump symptomatic rate first days vaccination, sounds like talking about. None vaccines would make sick, would ""occupy"" immune system giving fake targets sounds like bad happened fighting real COVID time. little surprising, good news. lucky. Haven‚Äôt sick, don‚Äôt know anyone been. one problem. don‚Äôt go anywhere. Don‚Äôt see anyone. worked almost year. going little crazy right now. Let rage on, getting rid red hats. would put past would land massive legal consequences (thus financial consequences). I‚Äôm defending business owners beacons morality, suggestion someone Reddit‚Äôs ‚Äúbrother‚Äù‚Äôs ‚Äúboss‚Äù preposterous probably untrue live NYC.  one knows sweet spot is. much? enough? things worth others? Even car analogy, laws accumulated adjusted decades. stupid article. two tested positive China let in, that's policy. applies everyone, scientists priviledge? Sputnik V approved EMA &lt;90% efficacity, would rather Sputnik AZ.

And would use Sputnik even Oxford considers combined use AZ Sputnik? extremely intelligent managers get idea everyone gotten COVID chose get infected via poor decisions? Nice. high risk defined CDC, state DPH, etc? tested younger people yet. again: 50% efficiency means complete efficiency. irrelevant still get assymptomatic infection mild cold vaccinated. Sinovac, pretty much vaccines, prevent 100% hospitalizations deaths, matters.

This brazilian, locally produced version Sinovac. vaccine, produced tested Turkey got 91% meaningless efficiency scale. indeed sounds weird lot credible reasons that.

Better vaccine lower efficiency, long virtually zeroes hospitalizations deaths, one affordable poor countries take sci-fi tech merely transported. Otherwise would Moderna Pfizer milking money countries it. believe exactly behind thus extensive effort discredit Russian Chinese vaccines. Yeah, don‚Äôt believe this. actually true needs reported local authorities massively illegal. FDA hasn‚Äôt approved 16 back normal would include mask requirements. lockdown. Thanks. makes sense. There‚Äôs easy fix called defense production act. Sadly crybaby chief won‚Äôt use it. office hiring? living? Florida? area restrictions since mid march see going away least May. hearing COVID variants may render vaccine useless 

Where hearing coming from? reports actual labs making vaccine telling us vaccines still good protecting mutated strains. Thankfully situation would plan vaccines could developed Covid? oxygen shortages LA too. Production simply can't keep demand financial incentive program government order increase production capacity. natural financial incentive either demand surely plummet end year excess capacity go waste even drive prices, they'd never recoup costs incurred increase production.

Hanlon's razor. easy problem see coming easy fix nothing gain fixing it. Starting choice. understand treating same, treated better slap face. Yes. You‚Äôve said before.

Criminals people well. 

And kill you. make groups? lol... guys really need better accessible education system. I'm laughing funny one bit. trying get it.. need vacation üòÇ think best case scenario single dose gives around 80% protection, getting booster shot maybe 6 months later provides similar numbers Moderna, would allow people like teachers etc return schools safely, allowing risk group adequately protected Typical sky news think schools closed? dozen copies book could help: http://cup.columbia.edu/book/a-survival-guide-to-the-misinformation-age/9780231168731 exact opposite saying Unlikely things happen time, one happens you, probability becomes 100%. flat don‚Äôt know difference wasn‚Äôt properly conveyed almost year ago

This far think biggest fuck-up response. look millions people using contradictions messaging near beginning original basis thinking COVID's overblown hoax. glad get to...

So matter things necessary, good idea. whether ""get [do thing]"".

That sounds like making case making lockdown protocols strict, less.  Eurocentric way reporting. back colonization era? Considering number asymptomatic cases, yes.  jobless introvert gaming addict, nothing changes home life could royally suck. N95 sterilized UV used rotation chance dry out. lot doctors last year.

I would prefer wait another 6 months getting vaccinated. Thank update that! asthma certainly seems make prone severe cases cold flu, believe that. searches topic early half pandemic uncovered stats supporting higher risk asthma yet. antibody tests accurate, problem body doesn‚Äôt constantly pump antibodies every infection.

That WWII generation lived multiple Polio epidemics , Smallpox (1949), Hong Kong Flu (\`68) various influenza years on...

...jumping ahead present...

The Chicken Pox vaccine came 1995 AIDS huuuuuuuuuuuuge deal 80s 90s til modern meds able bring control.

The group born \`00s hafta deal it, everyone born pretty much getting constant onslaught viruses-are-out-to-kill ya years.

The media really ran COVID baby, nowhere near devastation OGs like smallpox polio Sadly, US private healthcare. refuse service them.

Maybe, might make fascists advocate single payer healthcare?!  Oh yeah, true! read literature? based conjecture fact children tested nearly much adults. Generally children severe cases do, admitted ICU rate adults. 

Almost 20% children obese america increased risk severe cases. Children less likely die covid still risk developing MIS-C conditions affect adults covid children higher risk developing multisystem inflammatory currently regulatory affairs program M.Sc. conducted biomedical research. Currently drug received emergency approval means benefits provided drug society greater potential harm cause. I.e. there's better chance getting sick dying COVID getting vaccine.

Now took drug 30 years old widely used could say safe vaccine? Absolutely not. simply long term data even short term data missing (people certain medical conditions taking it, adolescents, etc). way rationalize much higher chance getting COVID dying anything vaccine might do.

Don't let people blind optimism sway questioning things though. basically blasphemy Reddit subs even say concerned taking vaccine tested long. professors regulatory field seem mixed it. think totally fine, others unsure wary. Take information will. 10 close friends?? good life? I‚Äôm jealous. it! diet key too, maybe exercise me.  went mostly veggie, late night munching stuff it‚Äôs celery sticks rice cakes. Sounds like joke, real :)

I benefit getting stuck sister covid, 100% veggie... got going. 90% veggie, it‚Äôs new religion.. diet :) mean... either r/cripplingalcoholism yo!!!!!!! get it? plenty immunosuppressed kids need this. see huh. Well I'm assuming FF7 hit PC year. Maybe try drops price sale then. love open world games like Dragon's Dogma, Skyrim, HZD, etc... FF7 game decade easily. never thought would good is. also can't wait try Cyberpunk though patch bit more. Shit wild there, sending something like 250 pacients states plane, receiving 30 pacients today live Teresina.

Also volume oxygen consumed high local industry able keep up, looking way import oxygen Venezuela.

edit: hell already 750 pacients, number 100s morning Possible. remove food original packaging also wash hand touch anything outside house.  Lmao right? Security told enforce though, damn shame.

I‚Äôm gonna start tying strings taping nose ridge down. It‚Äôs miserable sucks gives amazing seal (you tell damn thing inflates like balloon exhale)

I‚Äôm sure month they‚Äôll tell it‚Äôll least buy time I'm Nova Scotia, removed us. handful cases province. deaths since spring, state emergency since March many us can't see families. get media everyone else though. bit surreal. would likely distributed one dose initially, would switch soon new guidance came in. least that‚Äôs PH office would it. * addition high bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), mask also high fluid resistance protects large droplets and¬†splashes.
* smart mask‚Äôs detachable ventilator regulates airflow capable filtering least 95% airborne¬†particles.
* Project Hazel comes special charging case lined UV light interior kills bacteria viruses mask¬†charges.

Something tells affordable. Sounds like something Michigan‚Äôs Attorney General least Department Public Health know about. seems incredibly illegal. explains low numbers India then. Europe twice population US disagree putting efforts vaccination, truly glad charge anything. experience NYC think that's basically it. 

We've got pod, we've seen family isolating getting tested, we've travelled via car airplane. precautions kn95 indoors shopping around people know outside, washing hands going indoor bars/restaurants etc. etc.  

Yes lifestyle curtailed extent manageable. looking like folks generation vaccinated weeks that's gonna huge weight lifted.

That's real tragedy this, really need minimum amount unselfishness avoid suffering. would mean 60% US virus. find hard believe, could persuaded article study supports this. point issue criminals getting covid innocent people.And kill you, part not. Even better, moderna Pfizer vaccines immunity result lasts tested 3 months expected 1 year. yearly Covid shot may thing I'm saving kick ass new computer play Cyberpunk, I'm open world person. pretty much confirmed point China large number bots social media platforms like Reddit.

Is surprise pro-China comment heavily upvoted, anything China downvoted hell?  mention studies found brief, close contact covid carriers poses much less risk transmission say, teaching class hour China shitty this. entire world knows started there.  Let us figure make sure happen again. 

Also close wet markets.  Stop randomly making worlds bold, sound like mental problem. Possible fomites groceries? Yeah, I'm going judge anyone breaking point (wear mask though). Fuck selfish people flaunted precautions start, fuck governments worldwide everything humanly possible ensure spread virus sake ""the economy."" 

We could easily prevented month two DONE. couple months perfectly reasonable length time lockdown. year half not, laughable. point, everyone ""believes"" Covid decision make based much personal risk want take on. stopping spread anymore, ship sailed long time ago. Thanks Republicans politicizing issue, 40% America never even consider wearing mask, let alone restriction actually takes personal sacrifice. 

I friends family locked down, living alone, months. healthy adults, may get vaccine Autumn 2021. fully support seeking social interaction horrible winter. don‚Äôt- think get worse gets better.

The vaccine rollout unlikely suppress case counts degree B.1.1.7 variant increases them. Minister Viktor Orban‚Äôs chief staff Gergely Gulyas told briefing Thursday vaccine shipments EU‚Äôs programme arriving slowly, weekly shipments less 100,000 doses, Hungary would **continue talks Russia** China additional vaccine Accompanied healthy dose finger-pointing problem even full lockdown enough spread among essential worker cohort cases never get low enough rely solely contact tracing US Europe. Lol cruise ships. forgot that. Trump want one docking either. right Absolutely. family friends ignoring continuing travel visit one another almost every week. case even though we‚Äôve 8 get two die. It‚Äôs frustrating get out. I‚Äôve stopped saying anything getting cousin. continue try protect live with. don‚Äôt understand wrong everyone ignores it, plays especially deny it. wait enough population vaccinated. Thats already plan, less. still things like spend time friends. gotta careful.

Also, never getting risk zero. You‚Äôre right never happen. make risk *manageable*. healthcare system work pace that‚Äôs sustainable. Right now, it‚Äôs not.  summer spring, i'm going out. now; cold hell outside literally everything closed. father it. friend exposed. work colleague died it. Another workmate got extremely sick. Americans seriously weak character. finally get one real test failed miserably.   Funny news outlets keep making simple mistake...  Fuck yeah . Drain keep barely alive . Pump back vitamins nutrients pump till hes back full vitals . bam ! Drain . laboratory.  imagine another lockdown like Biden wanting? gonna interesting news people done hearing viruses lockdowns. live PA too. testing system worst country (seriously, bottom, look up). makes think vaccinations go smoothly?

I'll going across river, hometown NJ, getting vaccinated there. Fuck PA. Article title bad, never said couldn‚Äôt happen earlier. think crossed wires reading. Lack understanding relates morons think income taxed higher rate higher tax bracket. even forgo income avoid it.

Separately, referring amount owed one income bracket amount owed $500 next tax bracket negligible. fact involve feelings.

But based responses sounds like owe bunch money. I'm definitely going outside more, too. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's got two 95% efficiency vaccines year it? Garbage article title. Garbage. Absolute garbage. NEVER says ‚Äúuntil fall 2021‚Äù like that‚Äôs earliest happen. Absolutely likely happen earlier. Fbi entered chat.   Feel better! keep head up! 46 days til March.

With roughly current numbers, 

46 * 4000 = 184,000 people die covid then. shit. Americans fucking idiots. trick quit smoking get covid. better lungs amount money thrown lung research pretty much guarantee die something else. prejudice, basically. Isn‚Äôt illegal? 14th amendment reason. They‚Äôre going let people die color skin. Safeway dead around closing. going go restaurants, travel, that

If they're open. things remain closed down, won't. Note paper peer reviewed sample size 201, way small create assumption high degree confidence Stop researching get test. could COVID, could something else, could anxiety - endlessly researching symptoms going get anywhere. 

I'm guessing spelling ""tonnes"" US, know testing availability like are, hopefully need provide endless justification get test. Call doctor's office see say.  Yeah people weird. Also us thread got downvoted lmao actually something like ten times deadly flu, people actually dying things would survived hospitals jam-packed. ""The scientist saying shit bad makes worse I'm tired bad, can't say good go movie"" fucking real? Could genuine, reports stage dementia years, getting lines earpiece.. mean honestly I'd rather Canada right LA county corona cases Canada lmao see schools horrifying. Since ""being compliant can"" good enough?

Masks required attend school. required bus to/from school, cafeteria, gym. ""rules thee, me"" faculty teach masks ""everyone hear clearly"". Can't scold students severity situation non-compliant either, might cause panic. first time United States coronation. not, would rather around someone regularly wears unidirectional commercial grade P100 someone wears far less efficient home made mask bidirectional 30-80% efficiency, mainly willing spend money purchase mask, indicates willingness take covid seriously beyond government mandates. 

Assuming take seriously, P100 going heck lot prevent person becoming another covid vector lower quality mask. said, open exhaust port much issue one could hang surgical mask filter canisters... Biden Corona matter. semi-surprised going submit February, already, more, merrier. never said wasn't. Yeah, vaccine announced, coup attempt got everyone distracted last major virus news vaccines ready. Americans mentally hamstrung poor schooling rapid media blitz decades, wonder everything dumpster it? guess 9/11 terms conspiracy time might true I‚Äôm 15 city listed recruiting currently inactive. mean open recruitment point? vaccine ***this effective*** preventing disease also make less likely transmit virus. Preliminary data suggested one mRNA vaccines (I forget one) 50-70% effective preventing asymptomatic cases too.

The point need think this: **This probably good vaccines ever get.** **never** remove risk catching COVID completely (just like eradicated influenza).

So need ask ourselves, much risk reduction enough?

If ***any*** remaining risk much you, going stuck purgatory forever. Yes. Covid killing people.

But isn‚Äôt cause excess deaths places disruptive responses. 

Sweden 10 times many deaths causes neighbors, percent more. significantly deaths Covid. 3.4 times many Covid deaths per capita Denmark. 98% survival rate... think bigger reason people caring they‚Äôre much likely know people got didn‚Äôt symptoms cough day, they‚Äôve realized serious actually isn‚Äôt. know probably 15 people who‚Äôve gotten it, including 80 year old didn‚Äôt even know it. 1 trouble all, one go hospital fine well. people get it, people tell absurd lockdown is. blame them? 100th ""today marks new record new coronavirus cases/deaths"" certainly gets repetitive. ""In today's news: coronavirus still bad. Wear mask wash hands etc. 11"" say? credibility years.

They lost credibility staffers came BS anti-gun study wrote conclusion first, ""study"". CDC never been, never be, trustworthy. 10th? like 17th? assuming count central/south american countries ""western world"". Hopefully get soon! company actual medical professionals licenses, seeing COVID + geriatric patients, state/counties still regularly ignored us. First PPE, vaccines. seem know handful professions ignore rest create policies. Biden can‚Äôt make states lockdown afaik, that‚Äôs outside powers. Unless declared martial law there‚Äôs way that, would insane felt tenderness tingly-ness arm rest day, painful. next day pretty heavy fatigue headache good chunk day, could course attributed number factors. enough feel like got vaccine placebo, knows! think Biden could impose mask mandate.

And would thinking wrong. feds little power states comes health. am. People quit 30 see basically full recovery. Perhaps spread little faster - WHAT. change anything response - still need focus getting vulnerable vaccinated everyone else. that's takes? I'm it. California also got explosion cases December. everywhere now. mean would guess months now, that‚Äôs enough time collect data rolled Yeah everyone else said. top faith nobody know ends dead end COVID potential complications. living time everywhere look seems coming Hollywood studio real life.   royal ""we"" - American society. doctors look eyes tell you‚Äôre mild get away without admitting you. It‚Äôs medical professionals spouting. necessarily fair true assessment it‚Äôs medical community tells patients makes sure wear them? I'm going continue wear garbage cotton mask store owners say to. employee called tell niece's PCR test came back positive, snap negative. snap also negative. advised stay home got results back PCR. negative, safe come work? Yes, can‚Äôt forget states hardest hit areas. domestic terror via right-wing fascists. like Oklahoma City bombing attempt capital. Haha worries, i've weird responses getting vaccine due weight including ""don't feel guilty"", coming someone traveling non-stop entire pandemic stayed locked ordered groceries lol.

Hopefully info becomes available shipments vaccine high risk people. reached doctor asking note, even got appointment, never got back me. Seems know much. unfortunately true. family stayed home holidays seen weird ones. avoided family insisted wearing masks day Xmas pickup presents family outside. Even though extremely cautious early days quarantine, seems like desire normalcy far outweighs risk. unfortunate almost like people feel they've done enough clearly that's case. Vaccinations giving weird false sense security even though received them. I've heard herd immunity thrown way times.. men infected dying COVID-19 = Women bear brunt mental health burdens

Of course.... sad statement America people somehow offended notion would something help fellow Americans without something them. believe correct. timing new account fits bans previous ones also subreddits also goes to, think. previous guy also Croatia similar type writing making personal attacks insults. obviously mean explosion cases got Christmas (where european countries similar lockdowns showing reduced numbers period). Plus obviously fact studied british variant shown 30-70% higher replication rate.
 
But never mind, call evidence scare tactics there's little point arguing. Spoiling medicine intending use fits bill. Good grief. need research things posting it. Many unaware unemployment benefits, additional $600 per week coronavirus relief, considered taxable IRS states it‚Äôs Source tax exempt?  idea know certainty Vaccine prevent transmission? I've seen it, like -10 downvotes I'm one 10s millions. I'm right middle it. sucks society failed people. honestly can't help people own.

Though hardships life taken time learn basic skills survival. enjoyment necessity. Nobody got back. I'm sure give 2 shits me.

Shit's rough right best get by. I'm curious situation is? done.

All things aside. Restaurants still nonessential. Include states ignore lockdown orders mess... many die vaccine late? Lol, top keyword ""non-compliance"". cloth masks pretty good 2-3 layers, better - 2 layers + polypropylene filter? Right?! point there‚Äôs nothing convince them. deny virus literally die strapped ventilators. Bingo. dont make universal risk asessment global pandemic, looking affects personally, even thinking elderly/at risk family neighbors. big difference living civilization, civilized human being. problem headlines. ""No herd immunity 2021"". Article: whole world can't achieve herd immunity year, lot countries easily. think people living EU America worry hitting herd immunity year  still spread even vaccine, you‚Äôre basically asymptomatic case.   No

To make clear again: 

Biontech announced Pfizer would cover 100% development costs, Biontech could pay back future started making money  Yeah got mine earlier week literally felt nothing. kinda problems? ignore it, real, it'll go away, meanwhile ravages us, world, earth, gg people ""really DGAF it"" deaths drop. might looking several months 2000-3000 deaths day US. could double death toll summer. Funding part development. vaccine able developed fast money thrown it. here. I‚Äôve trying apply thinking everything days. can‚Äôt change move on.  large portion population fucking stupid, willfully ignorant apathetic peoples lives jarring.

I liken peoples behavior driving. Rarely one give another break, lest slightly inconvenienced. Even jogging, see people wont cross side (why \*I\*?) see coming, to. Wont shut big mouths talking phone consideration run past. Sometimes hold f'in breath - know hard 64, 1.5 mi feet? Yeah, that's *outside* \- supermarket, forget social distancing - joke. wear full PAPR, assume one step inch way me.

I also get part - what's going politically nation - HARD self-medicate. Hang there, hopefully things getting better upcoming months. COVID apparently causes scoliosis too, judging x-rays. "
