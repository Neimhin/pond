We're lucky Delta variant arose vaccines rolling - already seems making original Wuhan version look like child's play. around last year would absolutely wrecked lot places ""let burn low-risk people"" attitude everywhere. message largely get it, probably asymptomatic may still spread it. It‚Äôs primarily protect unvaccinated. Man, that's rough. I'm sorry family collective head thier ass. Maybe realize error thier ways...maybe won't. Either way, measure value based do. That's easier said done, course. wanted reach help feel seen.   knows covid developing brains  I'm fully vaccinated Moderna stopped wearing N95 mask. However, Covid cases community really rising I'm masking cautious. 34% area got vaccine they're stuck stupid!! actively contributing problem spreading misinformation. vaccine works.

Thats best got? got exposed using hospital admission date start date onset symptoms say youself need admit I'm wrong?

I've got reminder set bro. I'm gonna make know bullshit directly contributed deaths thousands. lot people subreddit severely high levels anxiety frequent subreddit. everyday person subreddit.  Makes sense. cause many kids qaurintine off, disrupting learning even more. plans wear one absolute bare required minimum. don‚Äôt want cause scene get someone job. navigate gym classes see ones aren‚Äôt requiring masks keep up. No, they‚Äôve shown literally less fit. Yup. signaled ""the pandemic over. coast clear y'all."" mean fall surge? Cause winter surge baseline \~15k cases per day.

As fall surge, thats pretty convenient date picked there. happen notice nearly 50% (\~2000 deaths) occurred last week cherry picked data?

Why Sept 1, uptick cases started back first week August?

So move data back 1 week, get 3151 vs 871. move back start surge, get 462 fall deaths vs 488 deaths start surge. places basically tried declaring pandemic leaders willed it, like India Brazil. probably believed people would keep going business told could ignore damage virus - thing ever though make situation worse push things away normal. mostly burrito man admit wrong. Well bright side mask mandates significantly less intrusive lock downs. really don‚Äôt want wear mask they‚Äôre enforced anyway. shouldn't, really need bring Green Pass system back. partner locked lot inmates want get vaccinated. state announced unit reached 70% vaccination rates, normal visitation would begin again, year visits. guys got vaccine real fast. goes around pretty much calling Fauci dickhead. people repeat it. propaganda. certainly saying things like, vaccination choice, want almost 100% guarantee need hospitalized, get vaccinated. genetic predispositions, thanks ancestry DNA tests people willingly submitted, among medical data there.  LA felt masks mandated again. It‚Äôs infuriating, defeating, fucking depressing kid born late 2020. meet anyone outside us June meet anyone unvaccinated.

His great grandmother yearned see we've within 5 minutes house visiting vaccinated family refuse see anyone chooses vaccinated.  Sadly it‚Äôs problem taking icu space Americans 12 over, all. That‚Äôs 50,000,000 Americans. Idk data reading, doses mRNA vaccine single dose j&amp;j extremely well protected present variants. care votes. Overall score Karma Krispy.  Vaccines may effective Delta compared base strain variants say ‚Äúbeing vaccinated doesn‚Äôt even matter‚Äù incorrect dangerous. guarantee vaccine preventing lot infections it‚Äôs letting in. seems typically breakthrough infections seem minor symptoms significantly smaller amount time compared COVID typically takes run course. Can‚Äôt say catching COVID unvaccinated rated comment it‚Äôs true. would completely flipped script.

Edit: severe symptoms even? Encephalitis? Could fuckin imagine? Ugh General population become fatter‚Ä¶lack sufficient blood flow brain.

Even Trump family got vaccines. lot poor fools follow haven‚Äôt. anecdotally know people lost several family members friends covid others don‚Äôt know anyone serious case. Combine anecdotal evidence like partisan politics around vaccine early rhetoric pandemic saying wouldn‚Äôt vaccine 18 months get today. 

I know liberals conservatives vaccinated know liberals conservatives ‚Äúwaiting seeing‚Äù vaccines ‚Äúrushed‚Äù.  Womp, womp. Haha yes US mask going kill you. Republican version ""Viva la muerte!"" one needs look comment sections YouTube. littered people shouting vaccine side effects, freedom lost, religious jargon. 

It's time government recommended (required) big tech companies use simple algorithms *this* subreddit employs vaccine disinformation political rhetoric. Deploying algorithm hard do. Facebook *claims* employed algorithm, failing utterly. 

For failures, retribution renumeration, paying insurance bills effected COVID. f@sc!sm tends corrupt institutions  *yes quickly pre-vaccine today's edition *Ya Say!* Magazine   think approach going win over. I‚Äôm NY, vaccinated won‚Äôt wear it. joking friend mine vaccination tweets custody situation like; said wasn‚Äôt sure üòÇ .     really botched dropped mask guidelines vaccinated individuals. Make every vaccinated death payout insurance unvaccinated (medical exemptions apply). covid related billing charged unvaccinated.    ER simply closed staff tired dealing shit.  whole pandemic since late 2019 raised several issues fairness related local small businesses, schooling, priorities gets vaccinated, working home, masks, etc people know wrecked allergies.  wonder masks trapping pollen like right face, wrecking you.  (im saying wear mask) didnt realise could see future ron desantis tell get vaccinated? tell vsccines autism microchips inside something? even bother getting shape olympics sex banned said anything vaccine ‚Äúbulletproof‚Äù?

No vaccine ‚Äúbullet proof‚Äù. masking supposed reduce spread tot unvaccinated that‚Äôs whole point, won‚Äôt work since anti vaxxers typically anti mask well. would feel lucky rid person. Truly toxic individual. I'm sure that, take look footnote page 11 document Case fatality rate calculated least 28 days since specimen date. **Case fatality comparable across variants** peaked different points pandemic, vary background hospital pressure, vaccination availability rates case profiles, treatment options, impact reporting delay, among factors.

Vaccination availability mentioned footnote. People ages 50+ overwhelmingly likely vaccinated UK, low fatality rate may reflect high effectiveness vaccination preventing severe illness death, we're constantly reminded. Also, genuinely low virulence Delta would hard reconcile carnage saw India.   I‚Äôm familiar article. Also article:

‚ÄúLyons cautioned lack observed post-Covid-19 cases vaccinated people ""just might lag time issue."" is, Covid-19 vaccinations started rolling en masse within past three four months, possible enough time passed identify long-haul patients following vaccinations.‚Äù unvaccinated literally severely inconveniencing guy **who‚Äôs already vaccinated** making 8 figures

You forgot important detail There's data Israel. US longer charting breakthrough infections. wonder why. (Get vaxxed, guys. shocked delta gives cold) people vaxxed waiting research side effect,etc still wearing mask?  following. 

Yes, ultimately choice. 

But told wrong information, influencing choice. know word propaganda? needed term strategy used influence people's decisions thought process. ‚ÄúMy 5G flickering &amp; out, plus caught hoping Melinda French Gates takes Bill cleaners divorce. need booster shot?‚Äù  Sure sue whoever want. Learn read: symptom onset date unknown, hospital admission date used (7802 \[9.8%\]). 
analyses time hospital admission death, patients symptoms occuring hospital excluded. 
These patients included analyses time symtpom onset death.

That's pretty big fucking disclaimer putting post Americans opportunity vaccinated. remaining want jab, that's right. good trying carry bribing reluctant people stupid vaccinated. US needs move. on. There's billions people poorer countries desperately want vaccinated. US ship remaining vaccine production Central South America, India, etc. 

Given Delta variant seems RO 5, herd immunity achievable 94%+ vaccinate, happen. Evidence seems suggest large people vaccinated still Covid (though generally minor symptoms) able pass on. implies nearly every person vaccinate, eventually get Covid. either give immunity need, kill them. 100% choice. Idk reddit denying individual responsibility Delta variant + Leak quarantine procedure hotels + cultists purposely spreading virus everywhere + HCMC late enacting social distancing order + low access vaccines compared neighbors Vietnam well long vaccine companies prioritize rich countries countries well. insist! case agree you. 

I wish could numbers assume are, however best work know far.

Let pay medical bills ever left point expendable

The ""expendable"" people people think others expendable.

Spread good, hate. might convince someone fence get vaccinated rather make sound stupid. Hopefully unable benefit vaccine still able telecommute stay isolated everyone trusted people. saying fully vaccinated population would get impacted Delta? No, possible significant unvaccinated population. Please correct l'm wrong, vaccine protect severe disease? would seem country vaccinated enough, thus much soon comment. Exactly! themselves. ""I'm basically safe that's care about."" Yes statistically individuals relatively safe. that's problem takes us (330million Americans) working together whole virus kill severely harm .5%!!!! (600k Americans!) People realize personal behaviors virus leapfrogs hundreds/thousands kill one person! takes individual chain kill 1! 

Like said care directly impacted unlikely hell anyone else. Sad infuriating!! üò° days. 

By end week, there'll ~10 states left fully vaccinated rate higher Canada. Fun fact: polio killed fewer people US entire 20th century covid last year.  Yeah- much hate sent kids back daycare last week. cases 5 day county vs 500 day peak. Also estimate 35% county covid 49% fully vaccinated point. least need break summer.  working full time juggling 1yo 4 yo extra day make work evening, family taking extra day, vaccinated babysitter. think happen interstate business travel. people can't take planes without proof vaccination, attend events states, might start sink stupids. I'm worried unvaccinated act incubators harmful variants. Yep. Still living pandemic lifestyle thanks 2 young kids. Luckily, social network vaccinated. would never forgive got sick fucked up. Phew yes is! shame rest state get board. Ah well.. can't handle trying get people vaccinated anymore.  Facebook Twitter start month, 2.4x people ICU BC did.

It's dropping places, makes sense open widely. I've argued least done middle ground e.g. opening greater capacity limits, still requiring masks stores transit till end July, etc.

Checking today, there's 99 people ventilators 12 critical care BC. Ontario's population 2.87x size BC's spreading north... Normally would go CFR IFR lethality, deaths/hospitalization, even narrowly deaths / ICU case. would respectively give strict measurements deaths per clinically significant case, terminal cases per respiratory failure. break magic statistics DNA testing along lines extrapolating respectively.

For instance, even know exact lethality rate influenza, know exactly many asymptomatic very-mild unreported cases every year. subclinical cases even important, technically COVID either. situation see wanting know curiosity. imagine regularly wondering whether infected not, would really irritating able scratch itch. Also, there‚Äôs evidence pointing combination natural infection vaccination producing exceptionally strong immunity, even better two doses prior infection, learning prior infection could actually reassuring.  congestion, several lost taste smell. wife thought sinus infection lost taste/smell bad congestion. coughing easily winded times, fever. sure symptoms coworkers Bernie dictator life. Also, every 60 seconds Africa, one minute passes. two teens got first dose getting second dose week. want get back normal. one hell school year. gain getting vaccine. 
My youngest still young. afraid needles, yet can‚Äôt wait get either. 

The trauma scared killing us go school heavy kids. (husband I) work hospital would come back home covid horror stories. scary time. don‚Äôt want live again. never met anyone actually cruise didn‚Äôt love it. Cruises awesome. Reddit loves hate cruises reason. live Asia, mask-mandated country. People sick wearing them. do, law, they're chin first opportunity. think going walk back. However, surprised provided additional clarification guidance high community spread. Get vaccinated drop GOP mentality that's left, talk.  point 90% 50+ pool vaccinated (a known fact). vaccine completely ineffective would expect see 9 times many vaccinated people dying unvaccinated. fact less twice many indicates significant death risk reduction. Hope kid ok now. can‚Äôt imagine dealing pandemic. actually pretty much country average vaccination. 65+ group seems vaxxed pretty high % relief. Wish stubborn anti-vax cousins would realize I‚Äôm pressing get vaccinated care don‚Äôt want watch die painful death. Unfortunately asshole politicians America politicized vaccines think I‚Äôm trying convert politics support.

I don‚Äôt want watch needlessly suffer man. Fuck whole thing. we‚Äôre dealing variant contagious Delta, one contagious diseases modern history. CDC said may necessary 85% population immune reach herd immunity. Even Delta estimated we‚Äôd need 70% eradicate.

It‚Äôs never happening. *All Vermont entered chat* HIV completely different virus isn‚Äôt spread air. Ah makes sense. also impression also response mandatory vaccinations among health care workers days ago. think single credible virologist thinks going extinct. not. fester poorer counties, mutate, come back first world waves.  case, ETA 3 weeks, 4 maximum.  Delta variant enters cells easily making infectious lethal. evolutionary benefit infectious greater cost killing hosts, especially host die quickly anyway. 


Basically, infectious period ends host typically dies, there's evolutionary pressure Covid less fatal. I'm trying find dataset, thought yesterday saw 91% 65+ Florida gotten least 1 dose somewhere mid-high 80's% fully vaccinated 2 doses. Much higher thought, makes sigh relief though. delta variant replicates airway better humans alpha variant therefore easily transmitted. you‚Äôre vaccinated, coast still clear. Something like 99% hospitalizations unvaccinated. home schooling either? didnt go replies yet. But- 

I think hard tease apart lethality infectivity testing variables. many factors would affect reported cases are, including low-symptomatic. may try correct certain variables well end making look less lethal. one wants that. Stop. issue people want ""to already! Ugh!"" ......when isn't.  Yes, limits scientific method - however, silver lining whole pandemic we've learned streamline little. point healthy people prime life fared worst. less vigorous immune response improved survival.

It would almost like martial art using opponents strength them, confronted someone stands knowing attack that. Yes, that's said. persist long selection pressure mutation. selection pressure *for* mutation (e.g. strains get killed spike protein looks similar COVID Classic‚Ñ¢'s) becomes dominant. people immunocompromosed people still young get vaccine. quiets something, helpful population level restrictions, example masking indoor spaces general public. think think would helped. typical Floridian. 

I'm vaccinated know people are, but, coworkers acquaintances vaccinated get vaccinated. 

I sort think insane.  79% Quebec‚Äôs teens got vaccine. Two kids included. quite well. 

In pharmacology, 12 years old often considered adults anyway. Doctor son:
I‚Äôm sure get vaccinated. 
My son:
  Well ... tell things. 
      guarantee don‚Äôt get vaccinated, get COVID ... probably within 2 years less regardless trying personally protective. 
         get COVID, probably get sick due age even though healthy active. age (65) immune system age issue. 
         may get hospitalized. 
         may die. 
         may die. 
         may lingering issues years 

      get vaccine ... well, could find 10 years unexpected issue ... though doubt unexpected issues hundreds millions people received shot nil negative impact essentially social media comments totally wrong (they technical skills understand DNA affected etc.$ ... like can‚Äôt read social media learn job) ... but, mentioned, long 10 year period, gotten COVID probably lingering effects, given others. 

     kids? ones 10 11 ... probably so.  younger ones ... quite sure yet. 

     Well l, go back operating room see save someone wish would gotten vaccinated. There‚Äôs less people Canada California‚Ä¶ 

And despite extra ~1.4M inhabitants, there's less vaccinations California anyway. Yes, that‚Äôs completely fine. careful you‚Äôre woozy dizzy.  Almost everyone 50 vaccinated.
Obviously 100% population vaccinated would see 100% deaths among vaccinated. Yeah. need biosafety level 4 lab order handle dangerous organisms. Like anthrax. got shipped mail. Oh. Yeah agree assessment. AZ less efficacy mRNA vaccines. Israel used mostly Pfizer heard. see upcoming days show regards breakthrough cases. It‚Äôs unfortunate US isn‚Äôt recording breakthrough cases unless hospitalization death. understand would want hide info antivaxxers use info solidify mislead beliefs think need info virus imho People self centered think parents going face fact kids &lt;12 years old probably get covid next months. Everything reopened many people get sick without overwhelming hospital system due vaccinations. There‚Äôs lot ways kids avoid covid point. can‚Äôt expect young kids navigate situation safely. Right, since antigens (spike proteins) produced inside cells, must accurately mimic real infection immune system? suggest Novavax vaccine, nanoparticles spikes attached vaccine (not made inside cells), would less effective generating T-Cell response? Since beginning vaccination ""knew"" covid would another flu.

Maybe get annual influenza/covid doses. I'm Absolutely false, it‚Äôs far contagious original dangerous. good outcome seeing current wave 88% adults least single dose vaccine. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, CDC - public health officials - seem agree right now. time Delta spreading rampantly. vaccines showed nearly 100% effectiveness preventing symptomatic (and asymptomatic) infections previous strains.

Delta far contagious. vaccine still effective it, however far breakthrough cases previous strains. seems US experience there‚Äôs layer younger folks apathetic/feel invincible, I‚Äôm sure expectation play quite like necessarily serial infection rate order 5.2 days - that's time one person getting it, giving another. median incubation period significantly shorter 14 days.

14 days period almost infections become detectable. incubation period - that's 3-4 days. Wow, interesting headline implies something different quote. strange unusual... (/s, directed person replying to) shit It'll worse next month, seems basically guaranteed point. like bunch people held going suddenly start vaccinating. don‚Äôt need 100% agree that. didn‚Äôt before. need agree force others. That's really percentages work. However, Canada lot population centered urban areas.. also good reaching isolated communities always to. end day mind set anything. saying either good bad, different. mean everyone run around saying US dumb taking vaccine. American way life contributed development vaccines saving lives. also difference vaccine US &amp; UK. mRNA vaccines effective AZ. That‚Äôs part you‚Äôre seeing. Make sure report misinformation whenever see Facebook. It‚Äôs satisfying get one chucklefucks thrown Facebook jail. Hey long Covid thing isn‚Äôt year half emergence little friggin‚Äô early talking *lifelong* complications? Israel data suggests Pfizer may ~65% range symptomatic infection. Still good perhaps high previous variants.  Well hope right. really really I‚Äôm getting sick living pandemic. rise cases UK Israel really alarming say least, I‚Äôve hearing incidents breakthrough cases. hope wrong. thing Olympic Village well, basically massive sex party time. know people mixing god knows kinds fluids. Yes, fully vaccinated don‚Äôt know intubated. grandparents friends die covid, contracting covid. early indication mRNA vaccines gave protection natural immunity couple variants, think data faded background data came in.

Look way: well-protected moderate severe disease vaccines, also infection-generated immunity. less protected now. parent younger kids, forced send kids school month. option online school mask mandate. keep kids home without going school cops come me. Parents little recourse. people severe symptoms infect anybody.

A cousin died COVID-19 three months ago, mother wife cared fabric disposable masks got infection Mickey Mouse medal /s  Reddit much better. Gaslighting astroturfing rampant. Mods positions bought default subs control whatever narrative want. power mods massive amount subs control. ridiculous. Social media leads radicalism. Twitter might cancerous though. fucking children 12???? keep trying scare us, us care also children cannot get vaxxed???? covid crippled 1/200 people, am-I-right?  point, vaccine can't fully protect vulnerable populations, time booster? modified formula? Masking cut long run, need treatments booster.  Seriously. amount pathos heartbreak gnashing teeth hear people *having wear piece cloth nose mouth short periods* continues astonish me.

Surgeons, construction workers, agricultural workers wear heavy personal protection gear 8 hours day multi-decade career. see anyone suffering ill effects. contrary. Well, vaccinated adults throwing hissy fit wearing mask, full knowledge kids 12 can't vaccinated yet. think insurance companies allowed charge based vacination status. Thank you. Hope get jab soon. rest though? I've casually gotten vaccines life Canadian without fuss. know what's covered Medicare top head. Thanks response! think boils able see. seen perhaps videos COVID super-close.. Covid isn‚Äôt visible naked eye. Smallpox went 0 fucked 14-17 days. point person learned 1:3 chance dying (30%). deformed people everyone would already. üòÇ Maybe get news news, reddit? told don‚Äôt disagree. I‚Äôve debated designed kind policy. might even looking effects vaccine driven relaxation policies local level. two problems didn‚Äôt wait long enough looking local level, rolled way that‚Äôs going politically tough undo. 

It‚Äôs tough balance, fair Biden administration coming fourth quarter 28 points down. looking like fumble. might what's coming (and finally pushes least people get vaccinated) insurance penalties vaccinated. Added cost great motivator. Where's leadership?

When's last time Biden talked coronavirus? administration acting like over, cases 140% last 14 days. classifying people needed therapeutic rehabilitation ""mild"" mainstream media. closing city prevent press publishing videos overwhelmed hospitals people dying streets. arrested doctors tried publish information actual effects level danger virus. intentionally knowingly published misinformation incorrect numbers related virus, infection rates, lethality.

They intentionally suppressed information related virus, spread, health effects that's Chinese government does: minimizes anything makes Chinese government look bad.

I never said know ""all long term health effects."" Unless intentionally obtuse, may be, said ""the degree severity *potential* long term effects."" *very* aware convalescent field hospitals.

Stop trying rewrite history head apologist. worse that. One polio vaccines actually caused 40,000 polio infections , paralyzed 200, killed 10.

Nevertheless, still best thing society overall far. done. part.

This seems surprisingly common attitude. ""I made sense got tired it, screw it.""

This definitely attitude might hear child spoiled pre-teen, still surprises hear adults.

I worn seat belts bike helmets long time, keep paying fire insurance bill every month, catch saying I'm going anymore I'm tired therefore I'm ""done."" lot tiresome burdensome things adult life keep doing.

I get it. miss buying Shiner Bock HEB! look positivity rates tell that. state it‚Äôs 1 percent. U.K.?  pathetic. anemia, makes get tired breath easily, still run lift weights mask gym. big deal. I'm tired hearing people act like wearing mask great burden. all. that's idea adversity, very, easy life. Yea, terror child permanently crippled definitely powerful motivator. becomes lethal people would get vaccine take precautions. People highest risk virus pretty well vaccinated. dad wants continue delayed trip African safari planned July last year upcoming October. We‚Äôre fully vaccinated (mixture J&amp;J Pfizer family) thought won‚Äôt large city (Nairobi one night) distanced outdoors entirety trip closest capacity people plane rides over. fully vaxed considering type trip would feel? stupid acceptable? still doses it. It‚Äôs beast though. It‚Äôs given layers skin leaves small permanent scar. Sunday church. Instead dinner church, parents took younger sister local high school waited line take sugar cube. remember father holding sister could swear received dropper medicine received sugar cube. 
Regardless idea receiving vaccine ludicrous. many anti vaxxers today also polio vaccine lines. Water wet people first-hand experience diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, polio. Measles smallpox considered facts life vaccination. People trust public health officials back then. much last smallpox outbreak U.S. happened New York 1940s [millions vaccinated within couple young Dr. Fauci one inoculated. anti-smallpox vaccine people. threatened jail and/or strapped down.  cruise 2019, ship strict hand washing. time went one restaurants, would forced wash hands crew watching it. Facebook afford defend and/or buy island nation own.

And people hooked. They‚Äôll get fix somewhere. logic, think person replied expendable.

Which, logic, makes expendable. still believe first amendment right people gossip bullshit.

There need laws teaching children critically reason see bullshit.

At certain point, accept gullible lost cause. know never recieved smallpox vaccine? fucking worked. mean case kind wrong. issues early mass vaccination attempts led mistrust vaccine. great example pick make point. I‚Äôm telling medical knowledge obtained scientific method. Period. [The anti-vax movement goes way back creation smallpox That's Mississippi West Virginia measles (and childhood vaccines) - exceptions except genuine medical ones. measles outbreaks 1992 1994 respectively one point number 1 2 childhood vaccination rates US. California studied one measles outbreaks post 2000 believe adopted least rules. Yes, need push back idea get vaccine, ""done"" pandemic longer affect you.

For one thing, every person infected virus mutation factory chance spinning new variants current vaccines protect from. alone means done. Also, existing vaccines expected wear 6 months year. done reason, either. present conditions present vaccines, everyone expect get covid least three six times time 60.

Also, course, globalized economy remain stuck neutral, collapsing supply chains overtaxed national governments long populations hammered.

Vaccinated people ""done."" Health department told probably don‚Äôt live county. v recently, nearly cases people flying overseas testing positive mandatory quarantine. suspect captures lot cases effectively symptomless. sure still case, beginning pandemic read around 80% people, major reason infectious. Don‚Äôt beat this. That‚Äôs old people do. die.  lol switzerland doesn‚Äôt work?
And grecce since time? Thank That's *might* bit different polio even people could clearly see aftereffects polio terms iron lungs people crippled (needing crutches wheelchairs well muscle wasting deformities).

Covid-19 give quite clear undifferentiated visuals. Suffice say, almost everyone generation different view vaccination lived saw this. knows, care he's willing take risk chance supporters thinking he's hero chance pulls off. ""urging caution"" means blame general public shit starts hit fan. argument confusing. agree wholeheartedly need meaningful regulation. That‚Äôs Facebook currently lacks disinformation allowed circulate freely among users. It‚Äôs platform allows 12 people spread lies 50 million kill thousands. stop. sure hope lesson isn‚Äôt mandating vaccines results lower vaccination rates because‚Ä¶ yeah. true virus limited hundred cases per year early 60‚Äôs. don‚Äôt know live, country ‚Äúmask mandates‚Äù always largely voluntary. businesses enforced don‚Äôt want asshole cause scene nutjob murder them. There‚Äôs reason didn‚Äôt get virus control got vaccines wide circulation. arrive figure vaccine rate abysmally low considering long they‚Äôve one? I've saying year well. can't get mass acceptance vaccines scientific concensus people believe whatever want believe find tons support inspiration idiocy online. internet may really set us back terms social progress.  Bragging rights I‚Äôm anaphylaxis camp. frustrated happening inability get boosters, potentially.  Long covid generations polio. It‚Äôs estimated 15 million Americans long covid. That‚Äôs huge swath population potentially can‚Äôt work due failure contain virus needs done. R friends say Biden controlling us virus. rest world listen president?! /s Holy crap, really deluded. know people fail much ask making right decisions. ""Prevailing thoughts"" really bad track record last 18 months. fact, one notable features pandemic quickly widely expert opinion turned wrong. I'm blaming anyone this, exactly, fast-changing unprecedented situation think expect track record continue.

I think wise course point make conservative assumptions possible.  Tell county health dept. Seriously, tell them. Vaccine prevent severity disease. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   think partly partly states locals dropping anyway didn‚Äôt want look powerless. weren‚Äôt wearing masks first place though Careful using stat, combat deaths. 

Edit: Granted, covid caused bunch secondary deaths get attributed well. It‚Äôs little late worry widespread disease. virus never leave shores, us rest lives, Influenza since 1918. r0 covid high country ever able reach herd immunity, *before* delta emerged, would likely require *over 85%* immunization.

So question live it. two ways deal Covid: added immune response system, without one.

Whether want risk serious disease entirely personal choice everyone age 16. Vaccinated people .0000047% chance dying covid .000025% chance hospitalized. 

And you‚Äôre right, people won‚Äôt swayed others wearing wearing masks. entire families unvaccinated people start getting covid together, change minds.

But still enough. endemic. Vax up. way many chances make changes still refuse deflect. must addressed serious way.

Biden needs shut Facebook. least US back normal. That‚Äôs totally okay. last thing anyone let others make decisions them. R value virus US 1. 

Its matter time cases go high. either something get R value 1 get overwhelmed. never ceases amaze brilliant way people able weave metaphors like this. Props you, I'm going take post free writing lesson! Seriously though, well put. Maybe could keep shuting South Aftrica team first match Japanese team.

Sorry weird English,as always. I've got seven family attended wedding together - vaccinated, shots - delta right now. Four pretty serious condition. yeah - happens, lot they'd like believe, methinks. Vaccinated - mask social distance. would unethical give people could potentially nothing even make things worse? Unfortunately, ditching mask requirement ""unvaccinated"" people makes impossible establishments enforce mask-wearing public spaces. practice, means one wears masks anywhere anymore, there's nothing anyone it. widely predicted anyone thought two seconds, seems fact happening. 

It's good example silly disastrous blindly follow ""the science"" dealing behavior large masses human beings.

I like think expect federal leadership this. people are. flock another service, needs laws prevent present future companies thing. also claim literally millions people died vaccine despite evidence outside crazy Alex Jones style sites. don‚Äôt good grip reality. That‚Äôs pretty unlikely... deserves sort award. unique: LOL, logically stop going thinking 'wow, funny'. tried smelling salts ammonia? Weight lifters use lift weight 1000%. refuse go back masks closed businesses protect idiots won‚Äôt protect themselves. 

For overwhelming majority people US getting Covid completely optional. I'll curious see vaccines end causing worse reactions variants...time tell. Hope get well soon though, best. I'm sorry say people way. every bit important life valuable insensitive clods can't seem summon ounce empathy. Please know like there. One reasons keep masking. 

How treatment going? managing ok?

Even severe asthma otherwise susceptible severe covid outcomes.

Thank masking again, since vaccinated still transmit. logical considering coldy without emotions. died way earlier life expectancy amount life lost obviously greater. Everyone eventually dies. latest best, earliest worst. üéØ CDC's ""no masks required"" recommendation came 30% US population fully vaccinated. freaking reckless. agree point, supply isnt limited. Currently nobody better 'sufficiently efficient' (or equally well!)

To give analogy - lets say race one person 2m tall one 1,5m tall, advantage tall, right. limit maximum speed 15km/h get finish line time. say well done short one - best obstructions... speed limit perhaps tall one would get finish line much quicker.

If supply problem countries could tripple vaccination effort others - case begin say efficient others.  nooooo

we're screwed would make sense actually enforcable enforced ""vaccine passport"" system likely never could. Even political non-starter, bureacracy would probably insurmountable.

Long Covid certainly exists, follow every single person claims does, every single health issue someone infected Covid going forward caused it. one perfect, nothing life perfect, vaccine saving us servere complications avoid hospitalization, ending pandemic, origin surely help scientists data virus.

Plus, long brainless anti-vaxxers ""herd stupidity"" someone cleverly said thread, we're going lot long covid normal covid plate. Hopefully make this, we're waiting vaccine rollouts vaccines possible.
We're point still (contrary popular belief) need quarantine wear masks despite vaccinations widespread enough states countries.

Serious question. mask maintain Covid rules forever? likely never going point completely 100% safe them, 100% safe flu season etc. prior pandemic. suspect eventual thing either Covid evolves far less virulent people immune issues need take extra precautions required wider society... perhaps wear medical-grade masks, think twice attending large events etc. local Covid rates high. know, asking 99% population mask forever sustainable solution, rather view fragile say anecdotally weight public opinion side given quickly I've watched masks disappear since restrictions lifted. Ignorant statement ....so infected, need vaccine not? virtually every covid case unvaccinated person.

The CDC tracking non-hospitalized breakthrough cases, know this. seem much European problem.

I exact numbers, antivax pretty high Europe well. downright shameful. plenty people would love nothing get vaccine can't ongoing medical issues, allergies, suppressed immune system, etc. Wear nothing else.

Also even dumbasses simple want vaccine 'deserve' die. Sorry sighted, killing people make add revenue from. kid died severe eczema parents wouldn‚Äôt treat it. Fucking   going lie, LA, even mask mandate lifted, still saw majority people wearing masks inside least area. true. there's skew towards asymptomatic (or mild bother testing), may actual efficacy preventing infection *lower* numbers suggesting, would mean efficacy preventing infection leading hospitalization *higher* numbers suggesting, true supports take I'm griping about.    Sure, standing street, still 96% less likely get severe case. probably end anytime soon. 

I know people got covid first half 2020, got fully vaccinated spring 2021 tested postive second time end June 2021. 

Vaccines great preventing hospitalizations deaths. want get infected all, continue wear masks socially distance. 

A lot people get sick fall winter, vaccinated not. Sure, vaccinated less likely go hospital even die Covid, let's honest, bed bound two weeks home something look forward to, either. Right also accurate. everyone get vaccinated, wear god damn mask. Yeah, main thing drove family strict quarantine. Didn‚Äôt want gamble kid‚Äôs long-term health. IOC remains extremely corrupt allow Japan put games another year. care money that's it. ‚Äúvaccinated people don‚Äôt mask‚Äù first bad step. plenty studies confirming this.  one Australian, correct Sorry sarcastic, countries sent best athlete's place w/ 10% vaccination rate.. I'm sure expected, allowed happen, we're literally going kill strongest healthiest humans produce television. small pharmacy small place people feeling sick go looking counter relief sounds like good place wear mask.

'rona thing one might avoid

With grocery store. already Cameron. Eaker‚Äôs coach, Al Fong,¬†told television station¬†in Des Moines Eaker gymnast tested positive. Eaker, 18-year-old Grain Valley, Mo., said last month need gym work out? Can't go jog ? Thanks reply it‚Äôs really helpful:) Yes, weird hide data vaccine delivery. really need publish data, people push get second doses J&amp;J vaccine effectively used UK. officially approve would actually best rely vaccine much possible anyone still get first dose yet, fully vaccinated immediately.

[Actually, know J&amp;J vaccine effective Delta would actually best rely vaccine much possible anyone still get first dose yet, fully vaccianted immediately. understand Netherlands reimposing restrictions apologised opening early.   That's we're seeing states. We're seeing high fevers 103F fatigue, headache, sore throat, cough, trouble breathing. kids ending hospital ICUs. read 89% get back within month. 11% likely span anywhere couple months 3 years.  Looming? It‚Äôs already dominant strain, weeks Philippines, we've got people vaccinated AZ, Johnson&amp;Johnson, Pfizer, Sputnik, Sinovac (a teensy bit of) Moderna. still lack vaccines. Plenty private companies ordered Moderna employees they're getting frustrated orders arrived yet. actually are. 

We NASA, MD Anderson cancer research center, dont even know many biotechnology labs centers mention less become new silicon valley. could go huge list whats point, may brush anyway. 

You cant judge entire state stupidity few. like cant say everyone reddit idiots one commenter thinks understand entire states population. Grew Polk County I'd imagine there. Dallas there's many masks point me, poor reading comprehension, thread title article mean thing. article talking lower vaccination rates poorer communities, become hot spots. Lower vaccination rates poorer communities equal, ""equal vaccination rates"" stated thread title. seems got infected Japan don‚Äôt know timing. negative arrival maybe hadn‚Äôt developed enough virus test positive yet? read gymnasts can‚Äôt wear masks train it‚Äôs dangerous. mask slips eyes could lead serious injury.   vaccine? Significant numbers opportunity one two jabs necessary full protection. Yeah. One way try least get idea (B) look data vaccination status deaths hospitalizations. data easy come by, seen plenty headlines recently high percentages hospitalizations deaths certain areas certain hospitals among unvaccinated, could imply (B) significant. 

Of course, fewer vaccinated people getting infected begin with, yes, fewer deaths severe cases among them, brings us back root problem trying find actual reduction severity vaccines. 

Hopefully someone informed knows studies already looked shares it. I'm surprised restriction-friendly sub is

Most people love restrictions can't accept fact virus never going away. teammate Leanne Wong vaccinated. article (which recent) also points 1 hospitalized fully vaccinated patients Israel 60.

This also doesn‚Äôt account lower nominal hospitalization rates fact ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù group account previously infected people.

Please review vaccine efficacy calculated commenting vaccine efficacy. Delta variant requires 60% population vaccinated reach herd immunity much lower? 90% instead 95%? point, without data back up, numbers numbers. knew 0 people hospital swine flu. ripped college friend-group, professors, staff, damn near everyone.

I know 20-ish people caught COVID. know 3 hospitalizations 2 ended ICU.

H1N1(pan09) caused 274,304 hospitalizations US.

COVID 2,317,457 hospital admissions. It‚Äôs different beast, experience not-withstanding. It‚Äôll probably happen soon enough. Either way fall almost one thing antimask parents forget. Without masks constant interruptions kids qaurintine. long vaccines approved 12, 12 mask. 12 unfortunately think consistent general guidelines optional vaccinated, knowing 50% people lying.  You‚Äôre 100% right response completely rational. That‚Äôs disagreed upon people sub. Good husband !!

I able book second shot today.. someone demographic, dying covid pretty low bar since 99%+ already rates without vaccination.

How protection long COVID? 

Furthermore, transmission numbers tested ORIGINAL VERSION COVID. J&amp;J, numbers preventing infections always lower Pfizer's, especially variants. J&amp;J still works amazingly well preventing severe illness death COVID types. specifically referring CDC unvaccinated group skews much younger. 5 10 people survive least 5 years lung transplant, many people living least 10 person sure fucked up. transplant dramatically reduces life expectancy. 

Get vaxxed ya doinks. Congrats! got second one week ago.I surprised vaccine huge effect get rid stress. sorts articles comments saying ""side effects mean vaccine working!!!"" back peak vaccination phase, really remember? emphasized much inevitable people would think side effects means much focus side effects public health messaging failed address fact many people experience side effects ‚Äî that‚Äôs Yes, herd immunity possible. Clearly UK still issues people spreading COVID. live US like better here. Well that‚Äôs super Vaccinate - Risk obscure side effect come yet despite clinical trials millions people vaccinated

Wait research - Risk getting real covid meantime, hospitalization, lung damage, long term complications, death


Cautious idiot: Ima play safe boiiis  Alabama .. Dead last Vaccinations. Ivey saids Masks lockdowns happening again. called superintendant area schools masks optional. I'm losing fucking mind debating homeschooling school. need break. need school mental health can't think getting sick covid. People unvaccinated CARE. They're willing risk catching covid think real even everything thats happened. simply dont give shit pass anyone else not.   many vaccine escaping variants find far couple hundred thousand versions? Uh, using calculations 21 serious cases 4.5 million unvaccinated people (the 50%), i.e. less vaccinated group. write replies delete posting I‚Äôm angry. Feels good! think goes show little average public knows viruses work Worst take seen sub saying ALOT  mean, US made excellent progress much better immunity overall, situation look like approaching herd immunity yet.

Currently infections steadily increasing. something would happen robust herd immunity scenario. scenario, infections would fizzle out.

But US heading towards herd immunity? Possibly. think need wait see things develop. This. know least two people weren‚Äôt anti vax, ‚ÄúI want see long term effects are‚Äù ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt bothered go get yet‚Äù either get vaccinated schedule appointment get within last week. hoping delta variant pushing people along getting it. dont know anyone else noticed this, Scotland seen declining case counts since July 4. Well uncle bill gates says wrong.  drastically shortened life immune-suppressors medical bill reward.

All avoid two 30 minute trips CVS. call Misery reason. 

Hospitalizations deaths 99% stupid right now. Mission accomplished. talked sisters yesterday,heard good news youngest sister daughter got 1st vaccination.(In central Japan)

My niece remission leukemia,2 years remission.She got antibody test,Doctor told sister (This sister's explanation me)My niece's B cell still working well,so antibody like 20 years old,though antibody.

Hoping booster shot available people like her! YES!! saw one earlier should, hopefully bring light ""UK=bad"" discussions here. 

One interesting part UK cases now, even better. Deaths range 10m fully translatable World Data others. 

Still could improve: Based 1 breakthrough case, know normally like?  might consider personal health information Point being? really know. likely better? Yes. guaranteed? No.

Using argument games last year? everything else too? Perhaps uncertainty future argument certainty bad situation That's ""justification Olympics."" argument specific issue getting COVID wreck athlete's performance.

The problem I'm pointing argument works athletes exist Olympics. worry athletes third world access vaccines... improve access third world countries vaccines instead organizing multibillion dollar massive event first world benefiting mostly first world brands excuse donate couple thousand doses? Israel tracks data cases Delta basically par. 80% people vaccinated age group, 80% cases vaccinated.

They still seeing reduction severe cases - 50% severe cases/deaths vaccinated, 80% vaccinated.

There caveats, like many unvaccinated natural immunity. UK saw 22% drop unvaccinated 40% increase vaccinated cases last data drop. unvaccinated, uninfected population might getting small. Unreal. sadly consequences also means us might need critical medical care might trouble hospitals get swamped cause bozo taking ICU hospital bed someone else needs. somebody think boomers, free college, full employment low property prices?

You know black people old right? think cruising Jim crow era?

You think mom, lifelong nurse, deserves die houses expensive today?

What absolute monster. hope never work children.  would vaccine effect performance lol? make sound heroic they? pioneers!  1200 scientists worldwide come forward asked UK reopen lot vaccinated. guess you‚Äôre smarter them. canceled again.

Well compare delta ravaging India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Tunisia, Indonesia, etc Israeli data. Even look Portugal Netherlands. Don‚Äôt give vaccines yet. Isreal's scientific reputation nothing compared U.K U.S, Canada many others reported efficacy delta variant. 

I think one think noted israel...didn't previous infection receive one dose? known months one dose efficacy greatly reduced. link? Quick google search failing 3rd place team replaces disqualified team win finals still get bronze gold medal awarded? model based idea behavior would change? Masks social distancing changed that.  IOC nutshell. though? Perhaps are. Anecdotes. thing is, could Japan done avoid this?

Now scream ""just cancel games"": bear mind last year Olympics, delaying permitted anymore. way, scheduling conflict 2022 Beijing Olympics. that's IOC Japan, kind irrelevant here.

Japan already invested Olympic stadiums everything. Olympics massive financial toll begin with, even without pandemic. make use it, they're going lose LOT money, mention suffer considerable international humiliation.

They're really caught damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation here. Really sure *any* good alternatives could taken. Get tested start symptoms. know 2 fully vaccinated people (well past second shot) tested positive now. Go nab yerself dose, eh champ? dumb learned today mixing vaccines may accepted 2-shot vaccinated.

I really wish international guidance things.

My second shot next week, really care get. smart ones. probably didnt vote abbot too. know I'm person asking, would bet people want ditch masks they're vaccinated would happy comply vaccine passport. absolutely would. Put info public registry future employers find, etc. care. heard people problems breathing long COVID. true? so, devastating young athlete? several athletes overseas tested positive virus since arriving Japan, gymnast first known COVID-19 case among Olympians United States. Another U.S. gymnast isolating hotel room health authorities determined close contact young woman tested positive.

If require athletes vaccinated, level playing field minimizing risk? may also last ... cases increasing? masked, locked vaccinated large amount? plenty ""real"" studies (note corroborate findings self-report mention nearly every state least one hospital / clinic Post-Covid care unit PASC (Long Covid / Covid Longhualers), many research: Planning wedding Cincy October (obviously anticipating Delta) would like know Ohio expected peak Delta. Thank informative answer. ""unknown""

I know think set perfect example *not* do. source this? 60% hospitalized vaccinated line told vaccine effectiveness. Still waiting second dose, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll stop wearing mask even I‚Äôve second jab. U.K. showing vaccines working well. high infection rate, low death rate. Except fact hospitalisations already rising exponentially UK, putting stress healthcare system. going blow faces again. happen countries, already see rise happening. UK unlucky first, similar alpha variant.

Let's hope countries stupid   I‚Äôve making cost/benefit arguments vis vis vaccine availability versus mandatory NPI‚Äôs weeks now, think people agree vaccines NPI‚Äôs aren‚Äôt worth cost. said, seems decent sized hardcore group folks insist risk Covid unacceptable, I‚Äôm sure handle it. It‚Äôs like many people‚Äôs capacity risk assessment broken last 16 months. immune system locked never-ending war every intruder. ever loses, die. Getting tired war good survival always likely develop new worrying variants?

Every new strain we've seen far straight upward trajectory ancestor, flu went 1918 (mildly contagious, 0.5% CFR) 1919 (hugely contagious, 15% CFR). remains completely unknown sars-cov-2 achieve horizontal mutation ability influenza did.  virus rides tiny droplets, blocked normal masks.

Maybe went whole year half without getting sick all. I've read death America option fall seriously ill Yep. Elimination possible now. that, countries need vaccinate, lock seal borders. hard pill swallow, specially politicians tied privileges vaccinations (including traveling).

This strategy also fails recognize live interconnected world low income countries much harder time pursuing strategy. 

As seen recently Vietnam, Taiwan Australia., Wolrd SARS-CoV-2 thriving put jeopardy strategy. long NZ stand? need worship handle snakes Hospital admission covid symptoms reason? reading efficacy numbers calculated help all? helped me, since intuitively ""get"" math saw spelled me. feels like we're backsliding

We backsliding; COVID moved forward. Dealing Delta large bump road normalcy, dealing Alpha small bump back March. unknown whether another bump delta.  Dude almost gave heart attack. I‚Äôm sitting desk Maryland I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúWhat miss?‚Äù. checked local news saw really happened ‚Ä¶ Full approval may arrive ever makes Supreme Court. that? Q? 


Funny since last pandemic masks completely acceptable, people wore sick thanked courtesy. ridiculed fools like you. long covid symptoms start get tested? advice online relates exposure don‚Äôt know exposed. like police, ensure people suffer die.  television show hosts. one knows talking head TV. That‚Äôs ok. aren‚Äôt ones going college. Try get everyone around vaccinated. act strongly protect her.  helpful. Thank . Damn straight  county? personally comfortable getting vaccine I'm adopted result dobt know medical history. weird reaction tetanus vaccine first got watch closely new things gotten dont know sensitivities allergens have. know I'm risking especially cousin pass away virus, I've nothing short careful I've prepared isolate start need to. worst part start applying colleges soon lot requiring proof vaccination, can't go really. asked question previous post, told crowds huddled together shelter couple hours one point due rain, likely bulk transmission occurred. Open-air crowds still probably terribly risky. hard say. Delta supposed much transmissible, could rate spread huge win vs base case.

Either way, even great spread unambiguously good news. new virus showed gave us exact numbers getting vaccine world would continued normal.  UK put new vaccine efficacy estimates based recent observations? Ok. EARLY FALL COMING We're tourist state can't people knowing we're fucked.  Deaths always rise least multiplier cases; CFR never going drop rising cases, though sometimes rise. question CFR now. dropped vaccinations (months ago), steady going forward vaccinations insignificant.  Norway 6 weeks iirc - changed? We're red list yet... Covid vaccine % near same, five years now. still avoiding crowds? Yup, biggest problem modern health/wellness industry simple. That's re-hiring 55% staff, group going hiring likely even less vaccinated. facing labor shortage. boneheads like me, ""molecular test""? mean antigen test *not* acceptable? Meningitis one, think. way, blame them? public never really ""needed"" know calculate before. past *very good* solution problem like fought hard, would embraced (sure, would resistance like anti-mask photos see Spanish Flu).

Sad girl. love god banned yet repeated misinformation spreading? single J&amp;J dose followed *single* mRNA 3-6 months would theoretically ideal. We've done trials AZ show good better two doses mRNA. vectored vaccines take time work waiting actually help. There's research J&amp;J particular showing maturation antibody response continues long time. gather, Japanese government generally wanted athletes teams spend little time Japan possible. talk making athletes come Japan days competition (I quite worried jetlagged would've affected them). entirely rational decision, welp, that's Suga admin ya!

But yes, many qualifications events took place really close start games. Italy national gymnastics competition 9 days ago. then, team already selected submitted. baffling reason, best Italian women gymnast, Giorgia Villa, chose compete meet. injured withdraw Olympics. üôÉ Funny thing vaccinated area is, see masks.  Zip codes around 80% 99% vaccinated masks everywhere. Went rural California one masks 38% vaccination rate.   delta that. AFAIK even started phase 1 tests delta/multivalent booster. say employer still COVID testing every week despite large number staff/employees vaccinated. found [contoured worked better son [pleated pleats ended mouth got chewed soggy, contoured masks anything sticking mouth, stayed pretty clean dry. contoured masks also adjustable ear loops help fit snugly.

My kid 3.5 pandemic started, got used wearing masks pretty quickly. hope too! Muh freedom fries says hello. /s US basically already this?   Vaccinated people particularly un-dangerous. immune system like antibiotic antiviral. designed never-ending all-out war multiple fronts every intruder, training advance ever bad virus. Ah see thank you! guess thought otherwise people say second shot side effects usually severe. took mean second shot either made different material stronger dosage. Aunties Uncles SGV never need mandate wear masks. üòÇ Yep! even friend whose daughter super excited turned 5 started wearing mask pre-K (my state mandates school/child care settings age 5 up). something proud big enough help. kids really want help others, know that‚Äôs mask does, board. Masks effective?! basing much testing actual deaths hospitalizations still quite low.

But literally whole ""casedemic"" nonsense side restrictions using one year earlier, proven non-scientific long ago?  7-day rolling average 29,000. get 10,000 day?

Many places flat dropping. Others doubling weekly - faster pace growth we've since March 2020. data doesn‚Äôt match Israel‚Äôs Iowa decided requiring masks schools illegal. Stupid Iowa. feel foolish realizing this. Yes. Initially hospitals offices medical field got moderna. FEMA Pfizer. agree you. It‚Äôs like friend friend told me. repeat seems real time widespread testing done. problem Trump improvement now. I‚Äôm state less 40% vaccination rate. Fought like hell get vaccinated January want follow science. It‚Äôs nerve racking see hospitals filling Covid patients. continue mask, governor wouldn‚Äôt mandate last year, antivaxxers sure hell wont. want breakthrough statistic.  two cities called Kansas City. 

The one Gold Cup played Kansas City, Kansas. say could organized way, exclude possibility transmission. would compare pre-pandemic current? would focus disease take effects environment equation using time period. 

For example, one hard thing compare J&amp;J Pfizer weren‚Äôt variants Pfizer clinical trial period compare J&amp;J period. really hope don‚Äôt find even worse position two years feel like barely avoided apocalypse time I‚Äôd willing bet money insane variant emerge unvaccinated populations kill significant portion population, overrun hospitals, etc.  Myocarditis still documented frequently infected patients vaccinated ones. risk TRANSIENT myocarditis still higher natural infection, even asymptomatic infection. got first shot two weeks ago. Pfizer get second next week, can't choose Pfizer/Moderna. I'm wondering could get next week wait week :) opinion fb? felt seismic shift today.I‚Äôm pro science way, fact others chose vaccinate just, ‚Äòthey‚Äôll wish get Covid‚Äô. Today, however, I‚Äôm pissed. No, storm-a-building pissed, their-actions-threaten-me pissed. unvaccinated zombies. live Florida they‚Äôre everywhere. Things going along nicely: scientists worked &amp; made vaccine, government distributed made available everyone; many people worked get real information collect data keep us informed. longer wear mask even outdoor get-together, inviting vaccinated neighbors. Lovely. we‚Äôve got Delta variant exponentially spreading, would dire didn‚Äôt adults acting like fucking toddlers refusing shot. Yes, infect people already vaccinated. Sorry, fault lies blameless nature, people empty lives- lack efforts- invent conspiracies, false science, crystal-moonbeam ‚Äòmy body temple‚Äô shit justify getting vaccine like grown rational human being. selfish behavior threatening people besides now, I‚Äôm pissed.  Yeah, really think willingly gave chance get vaccinated, also giving chance get someone's lungs. selfish every direction. Children's Mercy Park Sporting KC plays Kansas City, Kansas. Missouri.

So actually original question valid. way virus would mutate make vaccine ineffective spike protein mutated. happens might even infect humans anymore deadly. mean we'll back square one again? world expect re-emergence 2020 early-2021 restrictions soon, even well-vaccinated areas?

By way, happened whole talk earlier ""even there's variant, revise vaccine eight weeks?"" (Not sure Pfizer Moderna said it, both.) Every bit truth. Literally yes. Continue pushing vaccines abandon everything else. Exactly. chance false negative almost 100% first 3 days. slowly goes down. still get virus.

Even nuanced.

With strong immunity, ""get virus"" sense virus may get start replicating. key scale replication - immunity guarding town, replication small scale quickly terminated. person may asymptomatic, may spread others.  states don‚Äôt vaccination rates NY LA. Also actual number risen? Nope, try another lie. Embarrassing comment many ninety year olds breeding? Fixed that... sorry :( ~1% mostly elderly people dying several years collapse civilization.  Yes, lot people seem think COVID it‚Äôs either death mild symptoms. forget lot people hospitalized, lot people long-Covid, many people suffer weeks months. think referring roommate case testing positive, however isolating precaution, zero chance transmission. shamers shamed. going mess feel bad athletes inevitably test positive allowed compete. might find people experience community. people hospital covid covid? distinction, sure made Need get media campaign focus long-term symptoms many people getting, rather focusing deaths. 
 
The US populace need focus become somewhat desensitized COVID deaths. think happen them. 
 
But really pay attention possible long-term/life-long after-effects many survivors facing. reduced lung capacity. mental fog. constant feeling exhaustion. 
 
They may willing play pretty good odds someone 50 die it. may give pause faced 25% odds ""long COVID"", could mean rest lives. feels like they‚Äôre spite nature science. summer Olympics happen time World Cup.

And know one world tune to. Since covid death ""mild""

Does preclude way passing state law banning school locality enacting vaccine requirement.

Though school federal basis could probably requirement despite state law, eg one service academies there. Fuck‚Äôem wait US break sticks too.

I'm sure that's ever going happen, sadly. Maybe it'll happen states Southern states seem determined let thing spread. Right state, illegal public schools require vaccine businesses ask proof vaccine. say change gets full FDA approval I'm holding breath. Well, right vaccine useless protest. know delta variant spreads better including outdoors people close other. good chance protest could super spread event. many people would avoided getting vaccine endgame masks announced? Remember took **ages** actually get politicians tell us threshold mandates would go away.

I lucked getting vaccine appointment. get it, every intention putting county gave us end date mandates, figured ""whatever, masks protect us burn two Saturday mornings"". theyre 90% effective. ~60% got U.S. shit first place: mentality ""so long something negatively impact personally, give shit anyone else!"" 

I've heard many people last year half say, ""I care get COVID"" ""I'm super healthy, there's way I'm going get it"" proceed ignore CDC guidelines, thus contributing spread. people genuine health conditions prevent getting vaxxed relied other, healthier people mask get vaxxed themselves. 

The issue CDC dropping mask mandates businesses made point ensure without masks *actually got vaccinated.* That's we're seeing uptick U.S.: anti-vaxxers anti-maskers saw free pass throw mask away, poor health conditions worry *even more* health safety. I'm beyond tired apathetic attitudes toward virus *still is* affecting millions lives across globe. 

But hey - long *you're* okay, gives fuck anyone else, right?   We're starting see conservative politicians push get voters vaccinated... they're seeing dumbass base dying apparently care... Wait! Isn‚Äôt covishield AstraZeneca? That‚Äôs cold/flu/virus works. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs covid, I‚Äôm saying testing positive covid way know sure instead guessing. counter test get it‚Äôs serious, public health official urges people get tested contain spread. underestimate sheer stupidity general public. preliminary scientific report peer-reviewed and, therefore, regarded conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, treated established information

&amp;#x200B;

Although everyone probably eat greens doubt many doctors would discourage behaviour. concur, seen clinic. US literally eradicated domestic global existence numerous viral pathogens.

Polio, smallpox, etc.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* i‚Äôm fed point ppl. Vaccines months people point it‚Äôs natural selection  appreciate story, even feel like fear mongering sniffles could instantly kill sleep Covid. That‚Äôs works, data isn‚Äôt support claims.

That said, decision track every bit data perplexing one. would nice know total reported breakthrough cases, even number little unreliable since people would dismiss post vaccinated COVID symptoms cold, reporting infection. parents adults around children made choice them. child exposed COVID, get COVID. Vaccination around would provided buffer. lot smug answers here, think lot media. Murdoch stopped expanding media empire Canada due requirement news Canadian owned. company like Fox can't operate subsidiary Canada due requirements certain levels truth journalistic standards Canada. obviously still access media sources countries cable/satellite/internet, never became engrained Canadian culture discussing Canadian issues.

That's starting change rise people getting news FB, hopefully enough create anti-intellectualism see states. fucking shit know happened.

Chinese propaganda early listed bottom 80% ""mild"", intentionally downplayed degrees severity potential long term effects. successful: essentially virus framed since then. ""Most cases mild"" = ""It's big deal.""

(I aware risk looking like racist blaming China this... I'm one guys. I'll source asked, can't really bothered first response) really - standard care + fake medicine. Also, double-blind avoid biases.  RSV rotavirus kills hundreds thousands children per year. dismiss giving lifelong complications? propose it? Wanna bet?

After past year, dont know deadly disease Would overcome denial. Honestly, might better leverage giving anti-vaxxer, anti-maskers exactly wanted (i.e., lifting mandate). Curious, think catching virus herself? Hope ok Mutations happen random mutations tend become prominent encountering environment mutation provides survival value, dictating mutation reproduce Disqualify health insurance pay resources they‚Äôre wasting pocket. think trying give people getting vaccinated (very weak) incentive get vaccinated. ""If vaccinated, take mask."" 

I honestly think expected businesses drop mask requirements quickly that. businesses going check vaccine status. state, illegal businesses check vaccine status, actually. literally 80% state going mask free less 50% fully vaccinated. short, honor system put place CDC failed are.   Covid weird. Sometimes aren't. remember back Washington state, scientists found first covid deaths ones originally documented. younger folks major heath issues, major post sniffles stuff. Covid related blood clots caused heart attacks. Seemingly where.

All I'm saying wise track breakthrough cases, especially symptomatic ones. I‚Äôm getting angrier day number cases rises. They‚Äôre going lose unvaccinated minds force us go back wearing masks (like LA already do). seems probably would've worked better said ""we stop mask mandate 70% adults vaxxed"" get sense admin applying pressure FDA approve vaccines. expect approval within two months. 

Once vaccines approved, businesses others enitites better positioned require vaccines work participate. Ah, thought looking percentages people first second doses drawing conclusions that. rate first doses steady far: go slightly next two weeks availability increase August people 40 continue accepting vaccine like previous age groups.  Selfish murderers think prophet encouraged injecting bleach putting UV lights lungs form caveman cure. Maybe start GoFundMe page get bleach light end tunnel need ASAP?  Weaponized Ignorance never relaxes, opposition? Immune compromised individuals around long COVID. individuals need take precautions needed COVID.  WTF. Lol Smallpox deadlier easier spread. I'd like believe covid mortality rate 10-15% (half smallpox) age groups, type crap happening.  husband severely disabled MS diabetes host illnesses. know fact convinced get vaccine well think someone health honestly feel like Covid would probably kill catches it.   There‚Äôs symptoms death, however. Something cited something print article circled highlighter. ""take eliminate inflammation causes cancer."" figure will? evidence leads conclusion? I'm position. 18 month old. go daycare start teaching person university 2 weeks. 2 weeks! Florida cases skyrocketing I'm scared. help Florida Florida. Enough said. one mandate masks...its mess. contact immune-compromised children, mask help. get masks suck, agree, seems like relatively small ask help need it. whole mask helps you, mask helps me.... Add 1 would right. point I‚Äôm going full authoritarian left:
Don‚Äôt admit eligible, yet still unvaccinated adults hospitals. Oh. assume slowing down. asking slowing down, would sign would hit vaccination wall, 61% would good (it could always worse, like US). Especially delta going around. ""Sorry pulled shit card deck. Take whatever measures personally think need take get this."" Well that's bit problem. covid, one man's sniffles another man's death sentence. think breakthrough infections documented studied. That's fantastic, many need? wrong. anything common anymore quite long time somewhat relief. still sad makes sense.  Short version:

The thing Facebook sells make money access users‚Äô eyes, ears, attention.

Internal research long ago showed controversial content kind would get views people would look longer periods time.

They look whatever causing controversy promote content users.  wedding table got sick time doesn‚Äôt give pause? Correct. remarkably effective.

The CDC dropped mask requirement fully vaccinated individuals science showed safe.

Walking back recommendation done science shows previous stance wrong.

The current guidelines sufficient, opinion, stop/slow spread. States relaxed guidelines beyond CDC recommendations seeing uptick. locally (Panhandle region Texas), we've uptick hospitalizations among unvaccinated populations, deaths younger adults (age 30's). uptick mean CDC change anything... folks risked getting sick refusing vaccinate getting sick. assumed 1st doses slowing think. data looking at? kids 12 vaccinated. they‚Äôve made choice too, right?  500k? I'm getting like [probably even keeping pace number kids becoming adults

Unless work forcing you, even go? Vacationing Florida sends message good enough. not. live Florida, still vote money. Absolutely not. Variants Concern reduced vaccine efficacy emerged November back even vulnerable populations vaccinated.

To sort tag onto poster said: evolution happens random mutations. Heritable variations retained time mutations harm virus' chance surviving long enough passed new hosts.

The vaccines cause immune system kill virus replicate much‚Äîmost frequently noticing killing even enough virus system develop symptoms. such, within individuals less opportunity virus replicate thus mutate. Since individuals many times less likely pass virus people, people vaccinated reduction becomes exponential

The herd immunity threshold increases R0 virus increases (as variants concern) efficacy vaccines/immunity infection prior strain drops. certain point uptake, countries widespread vaccination we'll see COVID Classic‚Ñ¢ die vaccine-efficacy-reducing strains remaining. That's making strains stronger, removing strains (which would replaced anyways virus works evade immunity natural infection‚Äîand likely sooner, again, vaccines reduce infection rates dramatically) Yeah, cause year half, that‚Äôs worked. lot top experts saying unvaccinated expect catch Delta variant. would expect family catch bring home. 

Since vaccinated (and presumably young?) incredibly unlikely severe symptoms. know enough household spread Delta, evidence Israel UK would suggest good chance symptoms contract it, however. horrible. know sister diagnosed 2007 never heard it. many family, friends, even initial doctors idea treat it. Apparently Covid bringing attention it. awful, hope something found helps eventually. Oh wow shocker. Seems bit obvious. Next up: Boosters

CDC: ""don't test vaccinated people unless severe COVID""

Also CDC: ""there's enough evidence vaccinated people getting infected require booster"" forget smallpox. Right counts. It‚Äôs bad virus hasn‚Äôt mutated infect willfully ignorant. live California area less 50% vaccinated. Heck dont think it‚Äôs much 40%. we‚Äôre well compared neighboring counties. masked people around already fully vaccinated. Hippocratic oath forbids this.  believe good intentions terribly misguided. Well that‚Äôs bummer. would expect places put cheap temporary plexiglass attached unpainted 1x3 frames, places outfitted like bank tellers, haven‚Äôt noticed disappearing Los Angeles can. almost died right ER flu.

Biontech already gave those, there'd way tell wether they're vaccine previous infection. 1) wait 3-4 weeks 2nd shot, wait another 2 weeks full effectiveness 
2) wait 2 weeks full effectiveness imagine rate slow lot. vaccination program separated population age groups People 30 39 years old vaccinated now, followed 20-29 couple weeks, would expect population group open vaccines. nurses. Vast majority doctors getting vaccine actually studied medicine. cares chiropractors say covid? absolutely nothing field. even nytimes? might worth taking short term losses 2022 midterms means long term gains elections (because covid caused voters shuffle mortal coil). vaccine 100% free widely available US take. Refuse around them. want unvaccinated need hang little crazy pods. power avoid plague. Oh, wait‚Ä¶. workplace renovated still undergoing renovation. put window open, even inch? Nooooooooooo. Idiots. I'd say pandemic way worse alcoholic. cost money? Then, no. mild shock Israel already used mRNA vaccines first second doses. reason Turkey trying third dose first second doses people 50 health workers inactivated vaccines. people free choose two vaccines third dose. Tribalism nationalism pandemic help anyone. 

We work together species agaisnt this. Please enforce strict vaccination proof testing countries American travel. strict matter able travel. CDC made mistakes, also trying thread needle putting guidelines half country busy acting like toddlers.

In ideal world would able put guidelines, change necessary learned new things, country full whiniest people world give slightest fuck hurt anyone actions think everything run lizard Bill Gates.

So are, public messaging trying tailored right save lives idiots wind killing everyone, failing making everyone angry instead half country angry. become voluntary pandemic US.

And, sadly, wholly predictable. We‚Äôre escaping anytime soon. Oh, used communicate help plan it? 

Echo chambers dangerous social media provides spades. Hmm kind sounds like media think it. check CNN Fox News sometimes compare major headlines. fucking wild part spreading hysteria. need puny viruses. space lasers. concerned catching becoming extremely ill possibly dying? believe consensus vaccinated folks catch virus (no vaccine 100%), run extremely low chance serious illness/death. give exact percentages. people may able add detail. dont know exactly Delta variant transmissible general, much transmissible cost slightly lethal (im implying characteristics dependent other, well possible independent) still significant net gain fitness. Remember mutations random, statistical trends arent guaranteed apparent short timespan. Personally whole time thought achieve herd immunity get cases low amount. Fair comment, upvote making good point. Definitely agree. U.S. surgeon general said Sunday he‚Äôs concerned lies ahead cases COVID-19 increasing every state, millions still unvaccinated highly contagious virus variant spreading rapidly.

Elderly always higher risk immune systems lower, likely comorbidities complicate illness. vaccine isn‚Äôt going make us completely immune, it‚Äôs best solution currently available could potentially suffered lot worse without vaccinated.

Antidotal evidence doesn‚Äôt usually hold strong argument. family member goes hospital regular flu, gets flu shot every year hasn‚Äôt always avoided understands lowers risk.

She also got COVID vaccine, understands it‚Äôs foolproof serious conditions put risk. Again, vaccine lowers risk contract COVID would likely make lungs pretty destroyed.

Independence Day freedom England...  proven success rate vaccine pretty good motivation. many ""done part"" posts seem similar though they're copied pasted many times over. wonder they're bots. also like saying stop wearing seatbelt airbag protect you.

In reality, necessary. Neither 100% effective saving life. WTF freedom day? stupid people be? followed science, there's substantial reason vaccinated people need masks. problem unvaccinated people took masks we're back making reactionary decisions based feelings. vary quite widely. absurd fudged numbers. Facebook, I've seen, really call wrong much adds frame link covid information. ever left point expendable. 

Think minute. ""dumb"" people contribute society economy? contribute less? contributing less others make one ""expendable""? list! Unfortunately, taking decisions ones going die.  I'm posting stated website itself. Yes is. totally fucking encourage it. number basically propagandize ‚Äúalternative medicine‚Äù genuine replacement normal doctors treatment get banned insurance coverage IMO. fact they‚Äôve managed raise status genuinely quacks shows money right places buy anything.  article seriously misinterpreting MIT paper, go actually read, demonstrates people looking information, doesn‚Äôt mean know read analyze it. 

What demonstrates scientific illiteracy deficiency critical thinking, data set yield equally valid yet opposite conclusions don‚Äôt know much longer antivaxxers deny vaccine harmful going happen. China care. would lose face proven come them.  vaccinated person that's longer problem thankfully. want take chances virus that's them. They‚Äôve also gotten away media using term ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù opposed 

I prefer term ""lying.""  Honestly, society would much better without so, wish anyone, determined die silver lining enormous. took advantage moment started eating things hate like raw beets. Gross fucking things taste like dirt taste. took 4 months taste return I‚Äôm certain 6 months later sense smell was. I'd like hear rational counter argument people downvoting you. What's end game here? wear masks hope pray antivaxxers change tune? even think they'll follow guidelines wear mask? Science There‚Äôs can‚Äôt vaccinated yet, like children, immunocompromised, vaccination may effective. still indoors unmasked, unvaccinated people. deserve Long Covid?.  problem affecting person follows stupidity. person turn infects multiple people on. would problem people believe stuff basically problem. Quite opposite actually people would quickly filter gene pool.  said gives ‚Äúslight‚Äù protection infection? That‚Äôs blatantly false. gives quite good protection infection &amp; excellent protection hospitalization &amp; death. 

At mother‚Äôs nursing home, nearly 100% 500 elders got Moderna Dec/Jan. 6 months (unvaccinated) staff showing work infected, one another, seriously‚Ä¶ ONE breakthrough case &amp; 100% asymptomatic. 

This case care facilities across country. Breakthrough cases, - somewhat rare. Severe illness - rare. 

Right now, love fairly well vaccinated city &amp; people maskless place. Even cases increasing, test positivity remained 2%.  Would biologists fall category too? Careful now, might get banned providing ‚Äúfact based quality comments.‚Äù Would ‚Äúsevere illness‚Äù correct then? Boom. exactly happen. what's whole ""at time need boosters, stop talking it""

Yeah assholes? months? Here's idea, plan ahead start shit now....not protection wears couldn‚Äôt eradicate influenza? Yup thing bothered move happened couple weeks April Jobs report came out. states moved end unemployment, suddenly masks came off. makes think significant pressure Biden government open caved. know cases low, knew Delta around corner. science 2-3 months behind what‚Äôs happening field. Proceed caution üòä larger 10 million population ahead States Chile, UK, Canada.

And Spain. United Arab Emirates. Hungary. Israel. (like, 9.89M, 9.73M 9.37M respectively significant differences 10M)

And there's 2-4M population countries also ahead US: Mongolia, Uruguay Qatar.

But yes, 10 countries, countries ahead US tiny population. probably felt pressured open economy. Im going leave   CDC mask guidance read uses language? current guidance soft uses ""should"", ""can"" etc.

I doubt revised guidance would impact either public sentiment local government policy significant way. Public opinion government institutions shifts mostly based [which party holds understand viewpoint although disagree it. see masking particularly onerous want see waves COVID regardless motivates unvaccinated people feel behavior opinions.

A couple things keep mind: many unvaccinated people unvaccinated choice; vaccinated people immunocompromised still need additional protection; least all, pandemic taken *massive* psychological toll health care workers, still need continue treat unvaccinated people.

In words, even believe callously indifferent unvaccinated people suffering dying, extent happen mask-wearing balanced against. deserve punishment karma. Well previous surgeon general went Twitter telling people masks work beginning pandemic. He's since apologized damage done. Covid mortality rate 10-15% would going back dark ages right now. mortality rate small pox? would actual Armageddon I‚Äôm surprised many willfully unvaccinated people try justify choice parroting nonsense vaccine ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù good you.

We vaccine passports.

The unvaccinated without approved exemption disqualified many things including collection unemployment benefits, food stamps, etc.

Corporations given subsidies decline service unvaccinated compensating expected loss earnings turning away customers.

How fuck else supposed get reluctant vaccinate? leave alone, continue hold society back, allow us fully reopen economy (need masks social distancing again), make mutated variants likely emerge.  guess assuming one would need alive lifelong complication. Long-haul COVID long-haul RSV mean dead, means health compromised *while still alive.*

But suspect know death considered lifelong complication. wanted argue offering anything refute point made. met America 2021?

You think we‚Äôre going get 100% country agree government stick needle arm?

If truly idea scope misinformation conspiracy obsession grips massive portion population.  I‚Äôm watching unvaccinated armpit midwestern United States, little preview what‚Äôs coming possible, however provide data report. would think would separate 180,000 cases vaccinated vs unvaccinated not. making speculations, data presented. tell one oldest friends couldn‚Äôt visit us son vax - he‚Äôs 10. vaccinated friends family issues put jeopardy 18 months spent home keep others safe. ended fucking appalled would put son risk like that. I‚Äôll never see used to. beating Gamma WA state.

Might popular opinion, I'm you. every life decision made worrying someone else's worst case scenario?

Tough shit. happens reach peak vaccination levels covid still running rampant among 20-30% Americans unvaccinated? 

We wear masks forever?

Because it‚Äôs never going away. never enough people vaccinated eradicate covid America, ever. 

I‚Äôm waiting something never happen. Anyone thinks ever get rid covid entirely lying themselves.

Vax move on.  Every eligible adult teen who‚Äôs failed vaccinate also playing Russian roulette lives. one knows covid affect get it. would almost zero covid hospitalizations hospitals refused treat unvaccinated people... saying. Maybe give Darwin hand one. ""Antivaxer"" subset ""asshole"". assholes antivax. problem people care anyone nothing get change position.

I severe allergic reaction within five minutes COVID vaccination booster limbo gotten answer yet get vaccinated future. still enough relatives oppose COVID vaccinations change position. would rather cause rift family vaccinated relatives telling stay away. Oh, actually live NJ! Yes, we're one vaccinated states, one best-guarded incoming surge. Feel free come over, get vaccinated first. Facebook/social media one current worlds main warzones. People don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre manipulated countries optimistically, 500k day still really good, though discouraging large population anti-vax uber hesitent, fast it'll go long we're moving fast like this, pandemic, least USA side, non-problem. It'll matter time. 

Let people refuse vaccine ween off.  send Desantis help doctors/nurses treat unvaccinated patients. vaccines free easily available everyone US, pretty much has. Yes. 2morrow War Yes, Duh... offence sounds bit like ""it's driver kills pedestrian, car hits them"" think one thing keep mind lot poor non white people gotten yet. there‚Äôs still work reach people, it‚Äôs anti vax trump people Yes, UK huge outlier much sequencing do. I‚Äôm sure countries closed gap all, one point around 50% sequencing world. Yep myocarditis probably good high performance athletes like ten times many people vaccinated group unvaccinated indicating least 5-fold reduction death risk among vaccinated? know family holdouts get go Disneyland. right now. need put pressure Facebook comments sickening. it‚Äôs creeping here. I‚Äôve really lost faith people past year half adults cannot seem figure cover coughs sneezes. Literally past days I've seen people belching coughing sneezing place public. 

And get started fact soooo many adults wash hands piss shit Tomorrow Never Dies real life?   I'll concede, that's good point. Smallpox innately extremely visible, whereas COVID much internal conspiracy theorists dismiss footage ventilated patients fake.

On hand, day age, get feeling not-insignificant number people would deep enough conspiracy rabbit hole dismiss people covered smallpox blisters ""crisis actors."" Kind way we've heard patients denying COVID even exists literal dying breaths.  Unvaccinated Elaine: *""David! could get Delta variant!!! worst form Covid! permanent loss smell brain damage! ventilator! god ventilator! mean think that?!?!""* 
Vaccinated Puddy: *""Gonna rough.""* Texas magical place, even rare viruses want live here. Ebola said Monkey Pox ""the bbq insane.""  vast majority ppl know became nurses weren‚Äôt academic stars high school.  Yes, plus people cite statistics, needs clarity whether they‚Äôre talking effectiveness preventing infection all, effectiveness preventing symptomatic illness. news. Water cause wet. Maybe misinterpreted, thought arguing mask requirements. way see children parents who've done everything right (vaccines regular mask-wearing) also end hospital alongside children anti-masker anti-vaxxers start requiring masks again. Thankfully, true! See Correction Note: earlier version report said 12¬†patients requiring oxygen support, including five age 12.¬†This based information MOH press statement 12.17am Monday (July 19). ¬†MOH updated press release at¬†2.26am¬†to correct this. fact¬†five patients requiring oxygen support, none age 12. I'm dumb enough make life decisions based stuff posted ying yang FB, Instagram twitter, problem me. Chelsea markets today, leave got near food places. many people masks. Same. We've started wearing store 2 maybe 10 people store wearing today. I'm weird already anyway biggie. Weirdos unite! masks! hospitals full. Arkansas expected need twice capacity currently have. covid yes. Overall? Debatable. Newark shithole see many down-votes got many people believe he's nefarious reasons.

I tend think mental problem may have.  stayed basements 24/7 COVID. Society doesn‚Äôt obligation needs. would surprised learn list side effects grows longer, people tend care less presence. ‚ÄúThe argument dilution‚Äù effect. Winter less worst days last year.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  empathy people working hospitals taking care unvaccinated people. Seems like job got harder. It‚Äôs okay, re-read post definitely came aggressive intended. Thanks support. ü§ì ableist you. Surprised didn‚Äôt say stay basements 24/7. say is, thank gods collapsed lung May/June 2020. always felt kinda hard AF regarding sickness. rarely got sick prior Iraq. however got pneumonia maybe 7 times 4 years infantry. China popping went VA got hit pneumonia vax, generally given old people people get alot. However since service. Anyway, collapsed right lung hurt maybe week 10 days finally tired chest pain waking up. 
The Dr's zero clue was. said negative covid, pneumonia collapsed right lung. tell came first, caused either them. Blasted steroid shots rump mah guns. Anyway, hard AF sent home since oxygen levels still 96% (impressive since smoke). Needless say, although may hard AF, got covid jabs quickness. one hand, yes. People stupid, big discovery. born way. looking someone smallpox enough think ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want shit‚Äù. Seeing someone asymptomatic Covid scary. Seeing hundreds millions recoveries scary. Seeing people dying ventilators possibly scary, except it‚Äôs young seeing old vents. Potential lingering discomforts scary. vaccine works prevents deaths susceptible it. People take action prevent loss earn gain. many don‚Äôt feel anything lose catching Covid, needs change. sure interact multi-family hotel-style apartment building.

And me. Dammit, made laugh. Take upvote!  even made announcement, Delta variant known.  I‚Äôll know leech guy knowledgeable!   - seeing great deal vaccinated patients thankfully: 

‚ÄúDr. Michele Longo, assistant professor neurology Tulane University New Orleans works long-haul patients, said seen patients following breakthrough infection. Neither Dr. Maureen Lyons, medical director Care Recovery Covid-19 Clinic Washington University St. arm soreness last day two, didn‚Äôt find debilitating really.  I‚Äôm expecting non-southern ‚Äúbig‚Äù cities (NYC, SF, LA, Philly, DC, Chicago, Boston, etc) bring back mask mandates, capacity restrictions, bar service, etc. month sooner Wait election fall. Ok care data. number around 88% 64% 6 month mark. That‚Äôs real data. slight. booster shots every 6 months, efficacy even upheld. Seems getting herd immunity one way another end 2021 110%, type people cruises attract. different investigation shows Cuomo done that, answer that. 

But let's pretend people choosing get vaccinated. choice amplified leaders. Fauci Florida? Yeah, ok. No, someone similar situation that‚Äôs tired people thinking know better actual doctor. vaccines becoming less effective? weeks ago almost reports vaccinated people getting sick seems like it‚Äôs becoming common. Even though vaccines still prevent hospitalization feels like we‚Äôre going backwards now. God hate this.   valid concern, far valid one vast swathes world vaccines aren‚Äôt available anyone yet, won‚Äôt another year more. Cuomo sent covid patients nursing homes.

Thats bit different people choosing get vaccinated paying consequences I‚Äôm aware, likely unvaccinated person to:

A) get covid,
B) spread sufficiently

Vaccinated people still transmit level. Ok. atleast sue deliberate dangerous misinformation? booted social media. Pretty much zero chance death, yeah. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  still doesn‚Äôt clear don‚Äôt think think even statement gives chiropractors (or least anti-vax ones follow original theory) much credit. list, chiropractors ones believe traditional science. rest basic understanding scientific method would allow least comment experts likely provide helpful advice. SHOCKER. news 11. Water confirmed wet.  Texas Florida, shining beacon intelligence America plan behind mutations evolution random. could also 100% lethal variant shows symptoms someone contagioud anymore. Since people often contagioud like 2 weeks everything happens weeks irrelevant Virus. Could lethal less. difference spreading. US surgeon general saying masks *should* implemented everyone regardless vaccination status due Delta? think inevitable point, CDC pushed corner, eventually forced rescind earlier guidance okay take masks vaccinated. literally almost cried saw article newsfeed. HELL? I've fully vaccinated months now, national government promised freedom nearly complete normalcy reward. they're going back promises.

*NJ reimplement masks within two weeks. NY reimplement masks within two weeks.* going almost certainly case. I'm moving denial acceptance, anticipating codified state law.

!remindme 1 week Thanks investigative journalism Murrow. necessarily: treatments narrow effective range treatment, must given early rely early detection. Additionally don‚Äôt aid preventing spread likely would still similar contagious periods.

And monoclonal antibody treatments extraordinarily expensive due difficulty production distribution. Pre pandemic almost cost 100k usd per course.  So‚Ä¶. Close borders. got downvoted saying stuff like told people vaxxed they‚Äôve ‚Äúdone part‚Äù won‚Äôt mask again. CDC fail around assume talking US . . . 

I think basically correct. under-vaccinated places hospitals issues, think going widespread. Increasing overall level immunity might even helpful weather gets cold. kidding me? slight benefit protection protection comes death hospitalization. Infection really. lot break cases‚Ä¶ Look Florida, Texas, Floridians look UK. going rough. Get good masks now. Get vaccinated haven't. Delta *monster* variant. think I‚Äôm smart kid moron?  kidding me? slight benefit protection protection comes death hospitalization. Infection really. lot break cases‚Ä¶ Thanks, sad, graduating class twenty know same. Teachers leaving can. Interestingly reading page appears original SARS trained bind effectively though kind targeting process.

Most interestingly claim works variants concern. Wonder better controlled studies there. Came comment vaccinated people get punished lockdown? - 62% teens one dose 
30% teens two doses. far death, low risk? partner 40. I‚Äôm 30 us fairly healthy far know.

I‚Äôm reducing risk considering sharing house, I‚Äôm wearing mask 24/7 including I‚Äôm sleeping obviously accept risk guess. Vaccines work. wonder.  totally agree! Hospitalization death mostly. Big fucking surprise!  theres monkeypox worry bring great point role CDC. phrase guidance using language like ""must"" ""have to"" ""mandatory."" Obviously, cases true; CDC lot power areas like transportation (especially air travel, also cruises, trains, buses). 

As point out, direct power areas like mask use areas like state local government buildings, grocery stores, retail environments. think would ahead use language would make clear making recommendations. 

But think saying penalty ignoring CDC guidance bit disingenuous. Local governments heavily rely CDC guidance make local rules, enforced. primary role CDC main reason dangerous people stop believing say. 

And clear, advocate mandatory mask wearing indoors vaccines became readily available eligible adults teenagers. problem necessary maintain community's health, really see fully vaccinated people wearing masks protect people refused get vaccinated fits bucket. unvaccinated adults want protected, best way protect get vaccinated. protect infection. Don‚Äôt spread misinformation. course people live masks forever. I'm Minnesota spent every winter covering mouths noses outside-I cross country runner skier fully covered mouth nose cold. family friends still do. things wearing mask politicized one made big deal it. silly say masking impossibility. really big deal unless make one. I‚Äôll honest, fence getting vaccine. health issues doctor even warned issues. Living Florida though - knowing people walking around without mask even though haven‚Äôt taken vaccine- paired headlines, pushed finally get it. sure fall going terrible here. cannot stand WFH already (admittedly one few) back office pretty regularly, agree option. You‚Äôd needed help crying receiving rest antivaxxers claiming didn‚Äôt really get sick.  TIL. Thanks info. they‚Äôre elderly. know two elderly people fully vaccinated died read article. issue lack federal oversight allowed manufacturers screw perfectly good vaccine.  basically injected people live polio.

Very intellectually dishonest post. I'd rope pesky things herd em pasture hey  Ohio, Dewine said wont mask mandate schools. Good Lord. don‚Äôt want American government deciding speech net criminal charges.  freedom. /s

In seriousness, people don‚Äôt realize freedom requires minimum level social responsibility lacking.  Good you! I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs really shame. Teachers need protected valued. It‚Äôs sad.    article specifically limited single variant even states re-infection different variant likely. Given conservatively already least 4 variants, based linked, re-infection likely, really support position. No, think media coverage cdc pauses press releases every rare covid vaccine side effect helpful cause getting people get vaccinated. Care share patterns? Pm fine. would jump lockdown? thinking would nice people wore mask inside public places. know interferes people living best lives pandemic, geesh - I‚Äôd prefer kid wasn‚Äôt collateral damage adults go party. 

I still can‚Äôt believe country prioritized opening bars schools 2020. Looks like mindset continues. get locking everybody home acceptable placing mildest restrictions people actual danger isn't. Personally see national security issue 12 people treated such. But, hey, that's me.  Yes, thank Steve Jobs still around going say same, read traced vaccine misinfo 12 people. That‚Äôs crazy twelve people much influence. BTW, one piece misinformation stop spreading ""six week lag"". That's total BS. That‚Äôs even remotely true shows haven‚Äôt even lived Asia. wore n95 surgical last school year. Everyone getting covid matter time completely correct. kids trained wear kn95 hell wearing says even someone bullies know enough keep safe. virtual schooled last year. Everything sacrificed nothing due anti vaxers. essentially people willingly allowing get pneumonia steroids.

Just walking around saying ‚Äúf it, I‚Äôm pneumonia 2.0 battle, lungs (I think) handle it‚Äù

Absolutely bananas people okay get thing petrified 2-5ML medicine.

This get 45 vaccines child (note combo shots) September end summer. fall come I'm sure another variant end. wish family would that. live several states away haven‚Äôt seen two years now, since usually visit summer. family fully anti vax, still believe hydroxychloroquine miracle treatment since touted Trump. mom lupus fibromyalgia believes vaccine make conditions worse. grandparents vaccinated, they‚Äôre around parents much couldn‚Äôt drive see without also around unvaccinated parents. I‚Äôm also immunocosupressants, vaccine doesn‚Äôt work well me. I‚Äôve made clear won‚Äôt see they‚Äôre vaccinated. miss family much, literally mental breakdown days ago doesn‚Äôt seem like care all. carries much higher Viral Load.

""Boris saves Christmas""

The rat knows exactly implications decisions. was, suspect, making taking mask relaxing social distance requirements ‚Äúreward‚Äù vaccination motivate additional uptake. 

This best possible spin put it. ""If boys girls good follow rules, ice cream way home!"" Hard express asinine pathetic is, so. People ice cream time want ditching masks, practical effect zero.

Another explanation idea doing, caved business pressure reopen economy. 

None explanations particularly encouraging.  Kids really tough situation. Unfortunately, US leaders really fumbled ball reopening. Meaning precautions place protect people cannot vaccinate. Thankfully, data suggests majority children extremely low risk severe Covid outcomes. Well... make lying integral part government's behavior, anyone really surprised half citizens choose longer believe anything tell them, whether true not? ""Every lie tell incurs debt truth.

At rate everyone going get covid. Probably multiple times. Thanks response sharing link. appreciate taking time that. mother told 50s elementary school lined everyone put sugar cube everyone's tongue (oral vaccine) - reasonably sure parents never signed it. said everyone school got vaccinated never heard Polio (for part). 50s get bad rap lot things justifiably, feels like people took public health health experts seriously then.

I heard story radio going door door India vaccinate everyone no-one batted eye. swimmer wanting vaccine swimming sport 0.01 second

Odds young swimmer dying covid: low.

Odds young swimmer getting respiratory neuropsychiatric issues, possibly life, covid: medium.

Odds young swimmer dying vaccine: almost impossible.

Odds young swimmer getting issues vaccine lasting days: insanely low.

Unless he's allergic something like PEG insanely low-probability thing, get vaccine cares performance. do, admit could years, wearing mask indoors public.

You you. that's big ol' nope me. experiment. actual fight actual pandemic. dad dead, I'm worried girlfriend, too. empathy towards high risk - despite apparently bolstered resistance variant due prior vaccines - astoundingly stunted. hope never end misplaced notion utilitarianism.  center filled burrito can't understand chance. I‚Äôm even going research desperately need true. Thank sharing positive news. 1,000% agreed. wearing mask ""stopping society"" ""stopping people living lives"", imagine people compromised immune systems, health issues make vulnerable, people children can't get vaxxed feel seeing uptick COVID cases. paper Scotland month ago said delta twice likely result hospitalization alpha variant risk even higher comorbidities. don‚Äôt know research held recent data. [SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC Scotland: demographics, risk hospital admission, vaccine dude. viewpoint absolutely insane. You‚Äôre small minority continue lockdown mask taking vaccine. safe enough you? Maybe another year two spent wasting away inside, seeing friends family? 

I‚Äôm even trying snarky. Don‚Äôt yourself. You‚Äôre vaccinated, faith vaccines getting back normal. Johnson dimly realizing (from place covid quarantine!) idea going massive fiasco, turned Holland across Channel? make sense me? gym best place get infected. guess don‚Äôt know worst effects done couple days receiving shots. Best British luck. Pip pip god damn hottest take I've seen someone throw hours. That's say, please carry on. kills them, he's wrong.  deserve father's name. seems like conspiracy theory itself, me. People refuse get vaccines going swayed whether vaccinated people wear masks, even thinking logical standpoint.

The real issue, see it, allowing people ""legitimately"" go unmasked crowded indoor spaces, make impossible establishment enforce type mask wearing. Vaccinated people ditch masks, unvaccinated people stop wearing masks, too, one tell whether vaccinated. result people basically stopped wearing masks indoors, establishment tools anything it.

This state affairs real consequences cause far widespread disease. TIL. Thanks!  Funny thing ancient Greeks knew direct democracy doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs concept tyranny mob comes from.

We‚Äôve already seen mass exodus doctors, nurses, healthcare workers country put course pandemic. refusal respond seriously levels, personal governmental, eroding little social fabric remained American society. you‚Äôre going let unvaccinated run numbers illness body count, that‚Äôs taking us bad direction.

As end? Elsewhere, take pandemic seriously implement things like vaccine passports stronger border controls. US going continue spiral waves disease irrationality. Inequality heighten wealthy retreat enclaves better pandemic controls. Rural America ravaged, owing inability direct anger born suffering towards responsible, project whatever scapegoats fed far right populists. You‚Äôll able get vaccinated not, wear mask not, think little going return pre-pandemic status quo. Facebook gets decide what‚Äôs Facebook.

Here reality: masks help, aren‚Äôt magic shield prevent people getting COVID. vaccines simply relied masks, eventually everyone would contract virus seroconvert; would question whether person lucky enough asymptomatic develop mild infection unfortunate develop severe COVID. 

That‚Äôs pretty much path anyway people won‚Äôt take damn vaccines. could install permanent national mask mandate would prolong inevitable. Vaccines way truly save lives.

So fine good infect others vaccinated yet.

Plenty people still waiting first second dose. COVID entirely different type disease though...

With COVID, shot doesn‚Äôt protect new ‚Äúdelta strain‚Äù. Polio, one vaccine done forever. 

Mark words, COVID shot becomes flu shot lifetimes.  Make optional required large, optional, public gatherings like movies concerts. afraid vaccine, stay home. Polio much worse. Good thing vaccinated eradicated it. study? personal reason thousands pounds raw sewage dump ocean per ship, per day. oceans dying already.  leant anything England past week. brightest folk. live area low vaccine participation rates? Janssen over-40s (same above)

In Portugal OK¬¥d Janssen males 18. Women much might hormonal birth control. Ah sorry got J-months mixed up, right. actually couple days ago *last month.* 

Although still likely means people maximal immunity yet, especially appointments opening 1 month ago mean everyone got immediately first day. Sure look stats doses population, ranking right EU countries Malta (who got non EU vaccines), Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands - small countries high population density. Much easier reach everybody. harder, lot harder Spain, Sweden.

A map population density thought quite unfair redditor responding compare unfavorably spanish vaccination effort belgian dutch - practically LOTS easier reach everybody small dense countries. Plus spain much higher full vaccination rates demographics priority. Belgium Netherlands likely never reach 100% full vaccination 80s. would mad could read study released next 1-2 weeks concerning long covid vaccinated people UK done Tim Spector. far said less cases vaccinated individuals. much less question.

I‚Äôm old enough friend group got measles vaccine came in. One close friends nearly died kept dark remember really long time illest remember being. Covid started like that, people would banging doors vaccine. homo then... honestly know whether one way other. many refuse get vaccinated might end problem :(

My impression young people apathetic desensitized staying home safety measures , eager vaccinated. course experience seen around me, based data, its' obviously biased.

In end could problem US, I'm hopeful. countries European Union implementing measures make vaccinating mandatory, changes necessary Spain Everybody England (where restrictions lifted) aged 18+, offered vaccine month now. Every country freedom speech scary dystopian hellscape... like Canada. Netherlands Denmark getting vaccination speeds fast efficient, come easy them.

You cant compare efficiency limited supply - efficiency rolling vaccination effort would show. Currently say countries 'sufficiently efficient'. (not so) fun facts: 94% Polio infections children asymptomatic mild, full recovery within week. Less 1% Polio infections children resulted flaccid paralysis.

Additionally cases Germany low people think need get vaccinated all, putting progress halt. :/ Got second jab weekend, spent last weeks dodging many people possible, want catch something 5 cm finish line. 


Now spend next two weeks dodging many people possible sure catch something second jab operational.

No, healthcare workers haven‚Äôt ‚Äújust fine.‚Äù ‚ÄúMisleading‚Äù, really? ‚Äúf it, I‚Äôm pneumonia 2.0 battle, lungs (I think) handle it‚Äù

Same people: ""it's hard/hot breathe mask on"" current practise banning dissent serve us well.  Everyone 18 offered least one shot. weeks later would better IMO, kind see sides. least schools either finished, last week, see \*some\* logic now... see though guess. 85% adults 85% total population? saying right decision saying directly comparing experience Netherlands misleading. Australia's quarantine program ain't anywhere near zero risk yet I'd still trust Olympic Village day. Zero chance problems, imo.  anti- maskers could. Netherlands saw 20x increase new cases 10 days (From 500 day 10.500 per day currently.) UK currently 50.000 cases per day. Maybe result 20x increase, rise cases staggering nonetheless.

Not mild cases recover 2 weeks. people end hospital, mean everything fine. party going brutal.  Kids better far‚Ä¶‚Ä¶We don‚Äôt know kids 10 years post infection. 

Yeah, don‚Äôt know, people go assuming fine don‚Äôt care much.

This isn‚Äôt reality, it‚Äôs perception. perception kids less safe. people take lot less seriously would kids worse off, like polio. That‚Äôs whole point here. egregiously unvaccinated communities areas like Elizabeth Lake (33% 16+) Acton (42% 16+). two regions lowest vaccination rates unincorporated areas northern LA county Catalina Island. response ""outside cities"", still relevant point LA county absolutely areas ""outside city"" situation city county effectively same, like San Francisco.

And three cities officials talking trying set public health department want beholden COVID measures county taken Palmdale (with Republican mayor Steve Hofbauer), Lancaster (with Republican mayor Rex Parris), Santa Clarita (with Republican mayor Cameron Smyth 2020 Republican mayor Bill Miranda 2021). World mean people got covid within previous 9 months (instead actual 6 live) would need one dose vaccine? heart bleeds you. Maybe, take consideration lot anti-vaccine people care security children. Indeed results been.. pretty bad unvaccinated. great example replicate, ask me! Lol like many American states pretty much fully open months now. Kids better far‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

We don‚Äôt know kids 10 years post infection. Perhaps comes back something like shingles vengeance. problem insisting evidence based decision making. Sometimes time evidence, it‚Äôs already late. hand society invested less children afford replace elderly used up, going cold analysis utility; working age adults valuable children elderly least. one could argue earlier better. bit messed up. people would survived antibiotics.

Let‚Äôs see holds nightclubs bars then! rate world thanks sacrifice get reliable data üòÇ gov trying push final surge flu season starts Autumn.

Shows happen willing society. depends Fauci talking, ""masks useless"" Fauci ""wear two masks"" Fauci. UK almost double number people fully vaccinated today Dutch month ago.

There may still increase cases severe. leaders choice: adopt mandatory vaccine policies deal fallout, deal fallout persistent covid deaths.

i lot sympathy blaming facebook power state disposal less compel people get vaccinated. want people vaccinated, adopt policy achieve that. vision personal autonomy right endanger friends relatives important hundred thousand people year dying, mostly white Rs, say (perhaps diplomatic terms) let rest us move on. Delta doesn't, really. Current defenses still largely work it. Even slightly resistant vaccines, that's still minimal overall impact. moment, effects variant (a rise cases) still occurring almost entirely among unvaccinated population.

Also, put Plague, Inc. terms, Delta variant undoubtedly higher *infectivity*, data far indicates *lethality* increased. unfortunate we're seeing rise hospitalizations deaths due sheer number new cases, increased spread means we're also seeing rapid rise acquired immunity recovered cases well, long run going detrimental virus unless undergo another significant mutation.

It's bummer many refuse vaccinated going suffer it, one way another we're still pushing toward herd immunity. anti-vax population insisting hard way, Delta variant accelerating. like point. started, preventing deaths keeping hospitals run. seem forgotten along way.  Plenty people without forced. Yeah like riots last year. optimist regarding mankind *School shootings entered chat* I've always said COVID attacked wrong population first. almost willing promise, beyond shadow doubt, COVID started attacking kids first older populations we'd much higher, nearly 100% vaccination rate.

i pretty much guaranty wrong. people look back miracle polio vaccination‚Äîbecause polio eradicated united states‚Äîand forget achieved **because fucking mandate children get want attend school**. 

the vaccine accepted created giant consequences people chose it. really **really** hope comment age like milk.

If kids still vaccine start get ""back normal"" delta rampaging know want know happen kids started catch covid.

We especially leaders country might ask willing sacrifice economy children vice versa. I'm afraid choose latter.

There actual scientific evidence claim whatsoever.

The short answer know. clinical trials used 3 weeks doses Pfizer 4 weeks Moderna.  UK went 12 weeks doses order get people first doses quicker (a strategy logical time given data showing single dose could provide 70% benefit, one seems less optimal Delta variant pretty much requires doses effective). data UK seem indicate 12 weeks worse 3-4 weeks may somewhat better. I'm aware study pinpointed optimal duration doses. Celts,
Vikings,
Romans,
Angles,
Saxons,
Jutes,
Normans,

I'll admit Celts dubious lol Pessimistically, 500K day static number--it's one that's steadily trending downwards months.

Also shitty articles never link directly paper, annoying.

here actual study, states effectiveness vaccines low ~44% one dose low ~64% two doses pfizer (these lower bounds 95% CI, range massive conveniently neglected mention).

Also actually read study properly would also read following statement authors:

""For Delta B.1.617+ variants concern, study‚Äôs authors rely much smaller less reliable sample sizes, Delta cases confirmed whole genomic sequencing expensive laborious apply positive cases.""

So complete agreement results reported Read - Dutch around 25% vaccinated opened weeks back. I‚Äôm protesting anything, I‚Äôm wearing masks anymore (unless business requires it) I‚Äôm fully vaccinated need to. I‚Äôll take chances getting extremely mild version virus, way vaccine supposed work.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs problem affects me‚Äù sums up.

Even without looking crystal ball, I'm sure there's going another wave infections. Hospitalization, deaths another variant bound follow.

I'd say 35% walking around wearing masks public.  think you‚Äôre putting much faith haphazardly worn shitty masks. grocery store day got stared mask people whose masks barely on.

Not wearing mask wearing piece flimsy cloth barely around mouth thing. Effective masks pleasant reason! Masking presented ‚Äúthis sucks, please wear effective mask vaccines.‚Äù Instead still pushed ‚Äúnot big deal‚Äù people like you, it‚Äôs working vaccinated people know don‚Äôt need them, tired masks. Bullshit. Good luck.

They stop society, joyful parts. get source this? That's bold strategy.

Zero chance success however. took Netherlands 10 days, 20x rise cases.

Assuming rise cases go tad slower, UK government reacting slower... give 15 days, 25X rise cases minimally. precautions small group people can't get vaccines take. Monoclonal antibody treatments free anyone high risk (this includes can't get vaxxed) work well preventing hospitalization taken severe symptoms develop. N95 mask protects wearer well around them.

Wear N95 mask, get weekly free Covid tests, get free antibody treatment test positive, keep safe.

Also, I'm Florida. sudden everyone vaccinated, wearing masks. I've people know comment ""everyone vaccinated been. decide kids pandemic that's problem"". legit cannot make stupidity Florida. honestly breaking heart people would lie care regret phrase ‚Äòfreedom day‚Äô caught on. far breakthrough cases previous strains.

There's published scientific evidence this. Sure, there's quote Israel contradicts several published studies showing little increase breakthrough infections Delta fully vaccinated folks. Parliament full failures care sound bites one-upping nice quotes Twitter youtube Good, Ukraine terribly low vaccination rate far  We'd still fucking Smallpox.

Fun fact, people 1860s onward anti-vax Smallpox many countries made childhood (like 1-4 years old) Smallpox vaccination MANDATORY. Straight out. No, care bodily autonomy Smallpox fucking nightmare. alive witnessed full-on Smallpox infection. brutal disease dying easier option.

To put perspective Measles: Measles formed humans zoological transmission Rinderpest, probably around time people started living closer proximity herd animals cattle. Rinderpest killed millions millions ungulates worldwide, absolutely destroying livestock wild populations came through. Rinderpest devastating disease SECOND disease human beings eradicated. That's right. We've rid world Rinderpest, INCLUDING WILD ANIMALS EVERYWHERE, can't get rid Measles human population can't shoot humans vaccination darts (we obviously this). legit met woman yesterday 4 kids her. wearing masks. mask made comment one kids ""children immune never get covid"". (Florida) felt bad kids. also seems like long covid extremely rare vaccinated lot going around. much want me? I've given much already. Fifteen months hobbies, money, seeing friends family, happiness. Despite never personal worried myself. 

I can't give entire life others. take care now. course, claiming population 25% fully vaccinated risk levels population 50% fully vaccinated, you? could've done proper planning. That's failure government. Caution? 


Yeah, Honestly, it‚Äôs pretty efficient way achieve goal too. Mericans reading this: Faucii said vaxine gives ya pollio Better saying died Covid, people dying live Hillsborough, went shopping Pasco (first time weeks due uptick childcare. get cabin fever). Went two stores Pasco. masks (I one) worn anyone, including children. kids wearing masks all. go Publix way home Hillsborough masks worn around 70%. 

What's frustrating 1) kid 18 months can't get vaccinated dr saying revert back start pandemic protocol. work person starting 2 weeks. put son daycare. shit show right life. 
My mom also works Pasco medical office screamed at, cursed at, masks thrown her. People screaming crying phone deny covid diagnosis. blows mind year half people still know get tested, symptoms, get vaccine, etc. airlines already said require vaccines domestic travel. They're trying maximize profit. really care virus spread. Everyone tired shit. But, certain point view, can't keep locking society return. way eradicate get much vaccines possible give people booster shots keep immunity high. friend mom kid epilepsy sickness causing grand mal understand. conveniently forgetting flu, RSV, fifths etc. tell people uncaring then? Yes stressful put blame taken right steps far less risk girlfriend unvaccinated silly. sick people didn‚Äôt get treatment lockdown wont able get treatment hospitalisations rise anyway they‚Äôll incredibly serious risk, frontline staff don‚Äôt need isolate. sick people vulnerable people, happy ending removing restrictions. grave said: ""died theory"" Romans, Saxons, Vikings - others including?

Normans I'd give although less mass movement population instead transfer power one set rulers another.

Maybe times England 'colonised' Wales, Scotland Ireland though? think so, yes naive view topic. people get unjuries winter/summer sport activities, also fault getting dangerous situations get medical treatment?

If somebody dying heart attack caused smoking literally infront you, would seriously say *""Nah f- it, call ambulance let die floor, fault!""* fair, tech. UK seems today. weird.. Lol I'm really No, supposed keep others safe. vaccinated aren‚Äôt ones driving upcoming surge. blame us call us uncaring Republican science thinking. vaccinated much lower chance even asymptotic cases risk transmission get much lower. aren‚Äôt ones admitted hospitals. Either trust science don‚Äôt. say scientists best guesses shit go back again, Republican science, I.E. critical thinking. live, inject 1 dose patients infected covid less 6 months ago.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean hard deny genuine experience. downvoted? exactly correct. 

They said vaccinated individuals need wear masks, vaccinated, they're already wearing one. vaccine reduces chances transmission lot masks do.

Don't blame telling truth. Ditto people. 

Don‚Äôt measure them, clearly don‚Äôt deserve they‚Äôre unwilling you. 

Sorry deal this. intentionally suppressed information related virus, spread, health effects that's Chinese government does: minimizes anything makes Chinese government look bad.

No argument here. evident anyone familiar Chinese government. Doesn‚Äôt seem limited them, though. See: Florida, even attempts Trump admin suppress numbers. Friends work CDC afraid speak full truth information pages edited staff published misleading virus. NY hiding minimizing happened senior living facilities. 

This governments (hell, people) do. Minimize bad things look better people. never said know ""all long term health effects."" Unless intentionally obtuse, may be, said ""the degree severity potential long term effects."" aware convalescent field hospitals.

I believe you‚Äôre intentionally hyperbolic. Yes, China shares lot blame. pandemic could maybe largely avoided done things differently. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù lot people local city officials up. don‚Äôt understand thought process pointing fingers a) won‚Äôt help us prevent next time b) shifts focus away mistakes becoming better prepared future pandemics. classifying people needed therapeutic rehabilitation ""mild"" mainstream media. closing city prevent press publishing videos overwhelmed hospitals people dying streets. arrested doctors tried publish information actual effects level danger virus. 

And yet, mid-January, whole world knew happening (the heroic doctor later died got word out, noticed nonstop cremations, halting movement nationwide). Taiwan started health screenings incoming China flights Dec 31, 2019. early Feb US government many western governments knew something bad coming. take action first week March. 

I‚Äôm NYC thought ‚Äúoh wash hands‚Äù suddenly NBA ending it‚Äôs season citywide shutdown. Alarms sirens day night. knowing leaving apartment meant death sentence ‚Äúwas flu‚Äù. thought maybe transmitted surfaces too. That‚Äôs scary place like NYC. None us knew happening clearly well April May. Even then, long Covid wasn‚Äôt really talked thought (including scientists doctors) respiratory disease, vascular one. 

So please, tell country first hit hard unknown-at-the-time virus could known would long term effects (other lung issues, *was* talked early)? exactly would knowing sooner long term issues changed course things? People dying larger numbers 9/11 event every day many people still refused social distance wear masks. intentionally knowingly published misinformation incorrect numbers related virus, infection rates, lethality.

Please show sources this. far find, numbers held pretty well, estimating around 1-2% mortality fact, early thought much *more* lethal. ‚ÄúFrom 1955 1963, estimated 10-30% polio vaccines administered US contaminated simian virus 40 (SV40). virus came monkey kidney cell cultures used make polio vaccines time. contamination inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), also found oral polio vaccine (OPV). contamination discovered, U.S. government established testing requirements verify new lots polio vaccines free SV40.‚Äù

Vaccines weren‚Äôt perfect either. Fauci trying make sound like issues previous vaccines. It‚Äôs likely media didn‚Äôt report back then. worse? He‚Äôs long outlived usefulness. don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve vaccinated children Covid here? 50% fully vaccinated, 70% least partly vaccinated. adults, that's 68% 89%. 55s vulnerable, that's 90% doses. 90% adults Covid antibodies vaccination *and* infection, every day antibodies increase number strength throughout country.

The virus likely spread primarily among youth, much robust meaning less likelihood hospitalisation, hospitalised, less likely die likely recover quicker.

To honest, information hand I'm surprised restriction-friendly sub is. know recently got they‚Äôre mostly apathetic didn‚Äôt sense urgency. 

I‚Äôd bet start see small uptick schools start open again. Lotta last minute parent teens decided wanna get vaxxed (even takes 2-6 weeks full immunization) time span long enough, pandemics eradicated mass prayer. survived Covid. bad terrible. mom would survive (plus anybody unable get vaccinated health reasons). That‚Äôs got shot. Monday, Japanese city hosting U.S. gymnastics team pre-Games training said female gymnast team tested positive. name athlete, teens, withheld city Inzai, Chiba Prefecture, statement released Monday, USA Gymnastics confirmed replacement athlete women's artistic gymnastics team tested positive ""the local government determined affected replacement athlete one replacement athlete would subject additional quarantine Monday, Olympic athletes moved separate lodging accommodations separate training facility, originally planned, continue preparation Games,"" team said. several athletes overseas tested positive virus since arriving Japan, gymnast first known COVID-19 case among Olympians United States. Another U.S. gymnast isolating hotel room health authorities determined close contact young woman tested positive.

‚Ä¶  vaccinated people spoiled children.

I'm calling people scream gnash teeth trivial things like wearing piece cloth nose mouth occasionally, order help save lives people, spoiled children. Whether vaccinated not.  petulant crybaby 
 
When gonna realize ""petulant crybaby"" here? Jesus, disconnected reality insane.  don‚Äôt want use vaccine that‚Äôs still development. home another year. don‚Äôt see problem getting shot yet You‚Äôre going get higher aren‚Äôt vaccinating children it‚Äôs metric one that‚Äôs important one tracked. aren‚Äôt going vaccinate babies Covid need to. Herd immunity doesn‚Äôt require 100% take-up. Children receive vaccinations course, things seriously harm them: mumps, measles, polio etc. It‚Äôs known impact Covid children very, low. get vaccinated you? Well said amount things like scientifically tested may limited ethical constraints. would lockdowns come back? vaccinated extremely protected hospitalization death still wear masks.  Everyone else get Delta, question when. Personally I'd rather drag another year. Apple's policy exact every companies policy. starting trickle out. Expect Hybrid models across board. past complete fiction irrational right. Hospitalizations rising though.

[hospital      
[hospital    
[ICU   

And restrictions fell away. would waited longer, get vaccination rate higher spare people hospital visit.  feel like dropped national mask mandate soon. could worn another summer would fine thought ‚ÄúPeople need viruses lives make stronger‚Äù myth debunked first started implementing social distancing measures? agree lockdown impacts, social economic ones, needing exposure viruses keep immune system strong appears false. chlorinate pools inactivate polio well, definitely helps well em, say. Let live life. 

If trying make point ""Americans selfish,"" think better did. fucking cloth literally save lives. hear often ‚ÄúI‚Äôm young healthy, don‚Äôt need vaccine.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going wait research comes out‚Äù

There people need convince get shot rather arguing anti vaccine crowd won‚Äôt change mind. Agreed. It‚Äôs basically, people don‚Äôt want work office 3 days week that‚Äôs bad because
1. People quit

2. People can‚Äôt social distance

3.Apple isn‚Äôt listening

This nothing covid.

It also sounds like opinion article, believe confers immunity afaik, jury still exactly hight percentage would be. gut tells would around protection AZ vaccine. true said much. conext, discussion, broadly western societies. One number (53%) total population, (69%) adult population.
For things like herd immunity total population relevant. defend dangerous misinformation? Also good idea, accomplish goal getting people self-report cardio-pulmonary issues. 

That would encourage people take vaccine (and would also cost lot more). saying Delta variant poses threat vaccinated people well (far less threat sure vaccine 100%).

As someone works data, CDC reliable number years knew started projects related COVID. really aren‚Äôt. explain local areas might still need mandate based COVID vaccination numbers. Fauci talks mitigating risks vaccines aren‚Äôt perfect, saying wears mask crowded indoor areas he‚Äôs old - main issue people get virus. 

Masks situational depend lot stuff. Like, pretty much don‚Äôt wear mask go local small pharmacy know people work vaxxed it‚Äôs never busy 1 2 people‚Ä¶ grocery store street different story town didn‚Äôt get jab grocery store always slammed.

When work in-person, frequently come contact LOT people, make sure mask rest day / couple days afterward places. family co-morbidities wearing masks pandemic.

The CDC pretty clear masks effective tool might need worn, people take certain statements run / don‚Äôt think exceptions. (Like, say vaccinated people don‚Äôt wear mask one area explain it‚Äôs situational another‚Ä¶ many people run first part plug ears rest.) guess see terms ""free speech"" medical professional making millions pushing disinformation directly leading deaths. 

At least would negate ""doesn‚Äôt understand science enough knowingly persuading anyone"" argument post replying to. Except that‚Äôs true look kid know they‚Äôre destined junkie crackhead. Herd Immunity, hard way.  unvaccinated usually say ""hold beer !"" problem ~10% people who've covid tell this, 90% tell regular cold worse

I've ICU twice flu. besides much lower death rate, much much much lower hospitalisation rate. absolutely horrible experience feel dying, doubt anyone who's experienced would want risk getting bad case covid worse probably soon goes full FDA clearance, pretty much foregone conclusion point. 

Whenever comes anti-vaxxer crow ""experimental"", ""unapproved"" vaccine idea trials approvals actually work.

Given crazy high numbers they're seeing safety efficacy, there's basically way they'd fail approve two mRNA vaccines (the adenovirus ones seem little iffy comparison, even though they're also safe quite effective) faster spread COVID-19 at-risk neighbourhoods largely attributable social, economic demographic composition areas. Essential workers, racial minority groups immigrants continue greater exposure COVID-19 overall implication vaccination rates at-risk communities rise fast enough counteract higher risk infection. higher risk emerges structural disadvantages render residents at-risk neighborhoods vulnerable COVID-19 infections. earlier research, also undergoing peer review, identified factors overcrowded housing need travel ‚Äî often via public transit ‚Äî necessities like food health Toronto, average vaccination rates across neighbourhoods varying COVID-19 risks nearly equal. absence herd immunity, vaccination rate populations different degrees exposure virus result infection rate. circumstances, COVID-19 continue spread faster at-risk emergence COVID-19 variants, whether Canada ever achieve herd immunity unclear. Therefore, reducing disparities COVID-19 infections may require greater allocation vaccine dosages higher vaccination rates among groups greater efforts also made understand reduce barriers vaccine access among immigrant communities, including travel time language barriers. Addressing factors may hold key Toronto reduce inequalities COVID-19 vaccines viewed silver bullet end pandemic. Equitable distribution vaccines occur tandem safety measures slow spread COVID-19. multifaceted strategies best weapon variants best chance defeating pandemic. mother grandmother unvaccinated control group, hope around celebrate Christmas. 69% U.K. double vaccinated estimated 9 every 10 antibodies. figures still improving likely par government would‚Äôve hoped programme ended started rollout. take massive looks like take-up high. Duh. kidding. Generally speaking 50% enough. Totally agree. However specifics, coverage amongst 80+ years old somewhere 90% coverage amongst kids 10%. Indeed vaccination campaign designed reduce hospitalization, number cases. works. wearing mask protecting you, others petulant crybaby. vaccines ~85% effective preventing getting infected around ~99.something% effective preventing hospitalization. people get infected vaccinations (especially Delta numbers soaring real possibility) mild asymptomatic cases still transmit virus.
Do really think dislike wear mask important someones immunocompromised family member? one uses stats back point, least make correct. U.K. population two vaccinations currently 69%. state one lowest vaccination rates, governor contracted covid refusing create mask mandate, 99% covid deaths unvaccinated people.

from article - ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs perhaps tragic,‚Äù Anand said. ‚ÄúThe hospitalizations deaths preventable.‚Äù

No, preventable can't fix stupid. natural immunity thrown reconsideration due variant-induced reinfections? include adults. comes whole population little half fully vaccinated. Ah, go! Standard comparison % population, strange ONS would devise report differently! nothing months. full lockdown since March, restrictions lifted today, still full freedom. People still need isolate, foreign travel still restricted, masks still required places.

Freedom Day even delayed June today. vaccination rate every town NJ COVID website want look exact numbers. Strike nerve? Might? way prevented this...  World Data right 53 % population fully vaccinated July 17. 88 % single dose 69 % doses adults. Adults include anyone 17 years old younger. even read article? says people need better masks, masks don‚Äôt work. Glad hear least got first jab belt. Enjoy Germany !  Yeah god forbid healthcare worker healthcare work think interesting Spain administered vaccine.  communities given everyone appointment time place get vaccination, age group eligible.

There need book appointments, show first one, they'll send another one.  wonder approach effective getting people vaccinated bit lazy fence it. Brazil expected country start vaccinating people aged 30+ week.

The cases deaths decreasing since last month. Hopefully continue current trend.

To get idea, here's current moving average cases deaths July 18th:

**Cases moving average:** 40,948 (to give comparison, June 18th 71,566)

**Deaths moving average:** 1,245 (Also June 18th, 2,039) NJ high vaccination rate. addition, North NJ hit hard c19 lot natural immunity also. would imagine already there, really close herd immunity. urban areas likely. Canada epidemiologists saying pretty much everybody except dedicated hermits likely get Delta within next year vaccinated. Nope. require proof immunization, company said blog post.‚Äù Yes. UK really full opening beginning huge 50K+ wave missing something? Conservatives need wiped out. Liberals ever gather masses like this! England mad UK variant isn‚Äôt top dog globally anymore wants ensure manufacture worse variant? I've read people talking it. One guy said pretty much makes smoothies feels less weird eating solid food taste smell.

Another guy's taste/smell get blocked entirely changed experiences things differently. Mostly stuff used smell really good smells horrible (I think noted garlic/onion specifically smells like trash).  one even bodies year yet. appreciate massive sample size gives us ton data.

But normally clinical trials last longer. correct time not? reason. I'll stay indoors avoid concerts long gatherings. I've masked super top following guidelines I've gotten fights disagreements friends it..

But one would care feel bad died. Reading top comments feels like would prefer it.

I'll live bubble. Planning visit OH couple concerts September... news bode well.  Looks encouraging NL situation, sure - let‚Äôs hope turns OK! :) number coronavirus cases diagnosed last week -- 45,449 -- nearing increases seen last summer‚Äôs spike. week-to-week growth rate infections highest state seen since June one-in-five nation‚Äôs new COVID-19 infections Florida, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said rate Jacksonville three nearby counties even higher, leading state new infections per capita surpassing increases seen Florida‚Äôs first spike last 4,328 cases reported week ending Thursday, 19% July 2020 peak largest weekly increase since middle January, city country coming winter surge.

‚Ä¶ Thank saying this. I'm sick narrative Americans used patriotic ready what's right good country. People murdered drinking water fountain back godsakes. 

Polio gone essentially made illegal exist society without getting polio vaccine. government make one Covid vaccines mandatory end shit already. republicans anti-vaxxers problem that, tell tough shit move on. I'm tired kowtowing idiots. surge Netherlands specific causes:

\- Allowing people get jabbed go clubbing without testing night.

\- primary audience clubs festivals (16-30 years old) still 80+% unvaccinated fully vaccinated.

Then also heard also fraud going QR-codes proved tested, vaccinated recovered simply enough manpower enforce regulations check every incoming customer. I'm sure last two things.

Now I'm sure well different population cohorts vaccinated UK equal things might go better here. We'll hope best suppose. still gonna wear mask, got vax. Fk off. See part don‚Äôt get. wearing mask ‚Äúthe world coming stop?‚Äù makes sense. I‚Äôm saying shut anything down.

[archive link anyone trouble accessing article  sweet summer child  conservatives LA. People assume non-white, means conservative dumb reason.  Covid endemic now. It‚Äôs never going away.

Personally, give shit get vaccine not. feeling like justify extremes tells insecure. Great, want vaccine. get sick, you. say when, vaccinated.

I'm trying figure relative risk. numbers use hospitalization rates metric.

The weekly hospitalization rate 5-11yr **Covid ranges 0.1 (current) 0.8 (peak) per 100k per week** causes [30-50% Studies show rhino hospitalization rates range [3/1000 kids conditions (asthma/wheezing) [3/1000 assume Elementary age 3/1000 well. converts show **rhino hospitalizes 5.7 per 100k/week** (3x100/52). 

Dividing rates indicates Covid peak 7x less dangerous (5.7/0.8) current Covid 57x less dangerous (5.7/0.1) children rhino, considering hospitalization rates. Adding 50-70% cold causes, would least halve relative risk Covid. adjustment indicates **Covid 14x 114x less risk hospitalization elementary age children normal cold season** worth spending time writing long argument someone labels vaccinated people sociopaths / awful people. gymnast tested positive (Kara Eaker) fully vaccinated, first person team confirm so. one person women‚Äôs gymnastics team fully vaccinated, unvaccinated person minor.

a cold much mild flu even get cold still sick 2 weeks. knowing know masks social distancing, i'm hoping means never get sick (or least seriously reduce frequency) think mods pro vaccine, delete ban people fear mongering. people doubts (and looking assurances), people report side effects, anti-vaxx directly attack OPs, saying they're stupid get vaccinated yadda yadda. banned members even direct message harass OPs. also go around downvoting pro-vax.

Some people paranoid indeed. example, saw post teenager said dying side effects, side effects merely sore arm (that called ""insane"") headache. two super common, lightweight side effects. guess people different tolerance comes pain, kind post clearly help promote vaccinations.

I stopped following subreddit getting toxic. Never denied clearly US way anti vaxxers wanted admit seem much European problem. know previous variants rarely spread outdoors. 

Or, could lot outdoor transmission. tracing outdoors transmission might difficult. general identifying outdoor transmission seems impossible unless track everyone's movement time.

In Dutch Music Festival case, probably names people names infected people. Contact tracing easier then. Generally illness. think saw one accused doctors basically poisoning unspecified 'agenda'. 

And yeah, bit hard see get **still** people denying even thing. I'm also seeing ""yes real, keep living normal lives."" can't test delta variant. Sounds like hospitals pushing false info articles saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mean antivaxers won‚Äôt convince them‚Äù bad takes.

Tell parents/grandparents/cousins want see won‚Äôt visit till get vaccinated covid cases go 0. people won‚Äôt hold long faced familial ostracization. Thanks. sucks ass, like silence going walk mid lockdown. Seems surreal. Older people vaccinated first likely die covid. everyone get vaccinated? Absolutely. Stage 1, important vaccinate many at-risk patients possible vaccinate healthy 20 year olds.

And still moot point over-abundance vaccines shipping countries expire. Nobody age 12 getting turned away vaccine. vaccinated now, want be.  Yep, sealed deal lied masks March 2020.

My MIL got Pfizer jab today took threat able visit us EU so. wife also decided get double AZ jabs recently prove friends family AZ jab completely safe do. could Pfizer appears people prefer, decided take AZ instead vaccine specifically getting raked coals Ukraine. hoped got AZ jabs OK, wife's friends family would follow suite. Even one it, would consider small victory.

2 months later wife fully jabbed, fine, ready move life. want MIL come visit us EU, way getting without EU approved vaccine. Furthermore, boss told employees hospital works required get vaccinated lose jobs. Apparently 900+ doses Pfizer ""lost"" way Kharkiv last week, doses designated hospital. Instead offered Sinovac vaccines stipulation; take lose job. wife found walk-in clinic online offering Pfizer walk-ins jabs free. MIL decided wake early morning got couple hours ago, jab #2 3 weeks time.

I wish could visit friends Australia US - EU borders open that's far go.... toxic seems...   Great projection. tend think people people though you. sure exactly test that, data seem indicate highly unlikely she'd able spread scenario described.

Vaccines work like bleach virus breathe instantly die contact.  Yup see saying, appreciate breaking simple mind. 

But article say that. specifically laid vaccination rate far less poorer areas. vaccination rate. feel like something misleading thread title - unnecessary. Rona, gift keeps giving.  Louisiana here, correct. feel similarly, still anxious covid spent year actively avoiding it. hard pivot mindset quarantine/avoidance acceptance likely encounter virus point vaccinated person. Sounds silly guess. curious US going compare UK terms delta. People keep saying US behind UK weeks, country fully open several months whereas UK ‚Äúfreedom day‚Äù last week might‚Äôve convinced vaccine-fence sitters finally roll sleeves, fear they‚Äôll another hard lockdown Fall don‚Äôt.

Also, imagine may convinced people reimplement level precautions lives might play role numbers going well. risk significant mutations lies immuno-suppressed, necessarily unvaccinated.

If really cared mutations, give rich nations booster shot millions HIV+ people Africa unvaccinated. block travel Africa make poor poorer.

It good vaccinate US keep borders open. Even could vaccinate every human, animal reservoirs eventually burn us mutation. Someone boost dose optimism. two little girls cautiously optimistic could get vaccinated mid late fall, seeming like unlikely mid late winter along lower effacacy numbers Israel really putting lately.

This seems like going eat 5 years normalcy lives time slows :/ vaccine affect performance actual live infection would??

Let's say shotputter, get vaccinated, turn magnetic, go throw shotput never leaves hand. flipside, probably helps weightlifters hold onto barbell. either way affecting performance.

How often watch over-the-air tv? Doubtful. won‚Äôt seeing huge case numbers locations high vaccine uptake, places low vaccine uptake resistant mitigation efforts begin with. think ship sailed unless something huge unforeseen happens. world difference person can't get vaccinated someone chooses too.  one variant concern per 46 million confirmed cases worldwide.

People throw comments around like everyone else understands. asking original comment really explain us know mean. Nice condescension though.  Obvs ask doctor.

But friends taking happy pills problems vaccines staying meds. Sorry, obvious referring leisure travel here?

If that's referring to. massive indoor Trump rallies masks openly mocked. Even though Australia low vaccination rate, managed vaccinate large proportion people likely die, seem largely worked elderly especially 

However, hasn‚Äôt seemed reduce hospitalisations much, Sydney still high rate hospitalisation proportion community cases, aren‚Äôt discharged hospital fast, concerning 

(The recent Melbourne cluster mostly among younger people far, isn‚Äôt big enough draw conclusions point)  i'm 10 months since infected, still sort chest pain every day. marathon training covid, overweight, etc. guess least still smell taste food going me. Sure agree, though think masking classroom honestly pretty ineffective considering kids going wear correctly times, 0 chance hands them. Plus I'm psychologist grain salt feel like covering everyone's faces developmental period like preschool might negative effects.

But point worrying kids safety school covid unnecessary stress, theyre safe. answer question phase 4 vs extending phase 3. Manhattan one London one? Bc Manhattan good staying masked wow oh wow tourists really wanna wear masks needed evidence IOC care athletes host countries Actually immunocompromised breeding rounds variants. unvaccinated much lesser degree. fact it‚Äôs almost negligible really hope listened CDC's ""schools need masks vaccinated staff students"" bullshit.  know go route require proof vaccination. like walking Walmart full bare faces know probably like 30% people best vaxxed rest want wear mask. 

I've nervous issue. son 15 fully vaccinated also severe autism proven immune system issues also kid brings home influenza every year despite getting flu shot. Also 6 year old 3 year old home obviously young shot. I've real worried masks required schools anymore year half I've spent busting ass keep away virus pointless. 

I add live Missouri one seems give single fuck Covid anymore.  So, think 2022 situation basically today?

It's basically impossible say. think Delta causing lot additional consternation Games. could another variant pop cause issues 12 months now. Maybe variant even effective vaccinated. Maybe Japan finishes vaccination campaign opens baseline level spread rises. That's happening different places world, could also happen Japan.

Point being? really know. likely better? Yes. guaranteed? justification Olympics least third world athletes get vaccine

That's ""justification Olympics."" argument specific issue getting COVID wreck athlete's performance. (Which argument ""Delaying hurt athletes"")

So, yes, board argument hurt athletes delay think COVID risk athletes reduced, increased hosting games year opposed next.

Are lot questions/arguments had? Sure. comment thread pretty narrow scope. athletes refused vaccination fear vaccine affecting performance. I‚Äôd like know infected vaccine status.

parent comment regards specified athletes refused vaccination fear vaccine affecting performance. I‚Äôd like know infected vaccine status. No. get you‚Äôd idea, viral mutation doesn‚Äôt work way. It‚Äôs random, stimulus driven. vaccine evasive variant likely develop vaccinated person unvaccinated one, fact well might *less* likely, since vaccine primed immune system kill faster. 

The bottom line viral mutations fewer infections, fewer mutation opportunities. vaccinate, fewer infections, less mutate. Able spread covid pretty fair definition Good fucking luck putting genie back bottle.

Here LA single business enforcing local new mandate.

None us want protect anti vaxxers. really don‚Äôt. tired. done wearing masks. part. anti vaxxers get shot, suffer.

I‚Äôm done though. Yeah tell employer international travel necessity. Good luck understand data, asked provide graph supports claim yet seen data supports claim. 

Sure happened increase deaths. number cases UK sharp rise 4 weeks dont think - fact cases compared 2th wave. local districts Georgia totally eliminated quarantine protocols. fun winter ü§¶ Anti-vaxx fucks already brought back measles, much stretch polio. ""May blessed...""  still limitations restaurants bars well clubs. Concerts also fully running yet either. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll gone April!‚Äù Said another clueless rich person. People use terminology don‚Äôt understand. Reinfection happen anytime. could reinfected chicken pox daily rest life. means nothing. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening Covid positive cases vaccinated. reason make headlines sells pathetic posted sub yesterday. Google probably bring number articles too. Good luck that. know 3 year old, masks swapped around, dribbled on, Petri dishes full germs within half hour. I'd understand would unvaccinated, majority?? That's insane!! many people work healthcare industry trust science? concerning, 1.38% positivity rate shows IMO vaccines helping. something like 40 states US rate 10%. 

Also, article states 60% people ""serious condition"" vaccinated, overall number people serious condition 54. means 33 vaccinated people serious condition. 50% Israel's 9 million people vaccinated, 33 serious cases 4.5 million fully vaxxed people also proof vaccines working IMO. Masking pretty anti-conservative, surprising least. Toronto, average vaccination rates across neighbourhoods varying COVID-19 risks nearly equal. absence herd immunity, vaccination rate populations different degrees exposure virus result infection rate. circumstances, COVID-19 continue spread faster at-risk neighbourhoods

Neighborhood 45% vaccination rate + little exposure (residents jobs enable work home)

Neighborhood B 45% vaccination rate + frequent exposure (residents jobs lots interaction public)

Neighborhood B covid infections Neighborhood A. 

They‚Äôre advocating risk greater access vaccines. also want people realize vaccines aren‚Äôt miracle cure. precautions need taken addition vaccination prevent infections. can't believe they're allowing unvaccinated people compete. realize covid NEVER going away right? Time learn live instead chasing around depressing lockdown cycle. you‚Äôre looking 0 cases covid-19 you‚Äôll need time machine bud. 

Covid likely always new variant popping somewhere, vaccines hopefully effective treatments won‚Äôt need worry much, dont really worry particularly bad flu‚Äôs normal flu seasons. kids friends wear masks reliably without complaint. anecdote better anecdote. Nope, BC essentially fully open, mask mandate lifted, etc. Really Ontario outlier point.  Biden's literally telling public every opportunity get vaccinated. sure, let's blame president ""land free,"" people riot they're forced anything want people refuse get vaccine. think issue genuinely governments across world trying get economy back running again. Especially UK, they've sold austerity necessity spent billions funding furlough scheme, can't seen offering free money people support truly need 'normal' times.

Sensible restrictions checks + better track trace + double vaccinated people would best way forward. UK? thought one countries basically people wanted vaccine already vaccinated...

I'm Canada get point probably september. Post-polio people who've polio people polio vaccine. stated many notice difference think polio vaccine causes post-polio problems. would argue people haven‚Äôt taking precautions along. Many people probably natural immunity unaccounted previous testing weren‚Äôt getting either. also many us vaccinated prevent spread aren‚Äôt. think people like fail understand calculation works like this:

1. get vaccine, get Covid. Peak performance guaranteed
2. get vaccine, get Covid. Olympics likely over.
3. Get vaccine, get Covid. Performance may suffer vaccine.
4. Get vaccine, still get Covid. Performance suffers Olympics anyway, symptoms likely better vaccine.

So people working probability outcome avoiding vaccines probably overweight performance impact #1, underweight chance getting Covid #2 overweight #4 vs. reality.

Said another way, think less likely they'll get Covid chance negative performance hit force vaccine. prep kind event put much effort really consider increased risk life secondary losing edge.   dumb comment. Long-haul cases absolutely thing viruses, COVID. years ago, flu-like illness took (a healthy 20-year old) six months fully recover from. even-worse virus going ton people. It‚Äôs concerning look plots UK hospitalisations

The sharp increase hospitalisations still potential overload medical system cause excess death morbidity cases continue rise people don‚Äôt want vaccines won‚Äôt affect politically.  Nothing happen restrictions wise. Maybe localized mask mandate couple cities that‚Äôs amusing quote is, even think even true Tories. keep wrong thing. Gov Desantis FL running re-election FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOM main platform policy.

0% chance anything cancelled state (or local governments controls).

Could organizers shut down? Maaaybe?... Utah üò† Coerce word you‚Äôre looking for. 70% least one vaccinated high 60% two counties. feel good sending kid back masking gets shot.

Wow, imagine pain frustration close yet far away, especially vaccinated since early 2021. lucky. daughter old enough vaccinated is, lower vaccination rates state break covid real concern. Yeah updated edit thanks. hope also means Canadians drive US too.

But Canada keeping negative PCR test requirement (for travelers regardless vaccine status, need negative PCR molecular test within 72 hours requesting entry. vaccinated. Plenty US schools require vaccine records antibody titres already shit weird watch good chunk sub turn anti mask quickly.

This sub always over-run anti-maskers. Take look comment history lot people complaining idea wear mask post vaccination almost always see active contributors lockdownskeptisicm similar subreddits. Ever since last summer comments voting sub extraordinarily pro-COVID. I‚Äôve masked year vaccinated. early adopter supporter. know nothing me. It‚Äôs almost two years pandemic many tools use get sick, counting vaccinated. Covid endemic. Im going wear mask forever. Get sub it‚Äôs clouding jidgement dumb. least one high profile athlete going end testing positive isolate due close contact testing positive. olympics canceled postponed everyone come like month early quarantine competing. Exactly says. fully vaccinated asymptomatic pop positive PCR test, extremely unlikely transmit virus anyone. Children 12 also hospitalization rate 1 %  problem covid's main killing ground elderly infirm, people average covid-skeptic economic figure views acceptable losses. killed kids way polio did, they'd suddenly onboard. vaccine saves lives. anti vaxxers don‚Äôt want lives saved power  Um, okay Michael.

Edit: point it‚Äôs impossible... infect people, including people less vaccinated host country.


But guess you‚Äôre typical American, want Americans vaccinated screw it, let poors countries die.  Aug. 9 12:01 a.m. ET. ‚Äî fully vaccinated U.S. citizens permanent residents living country able visit Canada without quarantine two weeks. 
The government said plans allow fully vaccinated travellers countries enter Canada without quarantine Sept. 7. 
A government official speaking background journalists today said that, Aug. 9, children 12 ‚Äî yet approved receive vaccine ‚Äî exempt quarantine requirement entering Canada move around parents follow public health measures. vaccine isnt shield. still get virus. 

Its helpful think copies virus. 1 virus means infected. (Just using numbers reference. actual data presented) 
It may take 5,000 copies feel symptoms. may take 15,000 infectious, may take 30,000 severe disease. 

Of course depends copies located growing. 
Plus wear mask number copies needed could 45,000 infectious. mask close quarters long period time could 4000 infectious.

Olympian could around someone virus. gets it. could asymptomatic low count high antibodies expected vaccinated. body likely taking care unlikely produce enough copies cause serious illness likely prevent enough copies transmission. Thus roomate didnt it. 

Thisbis good protocol overly careful prevents infection. Vaccines prevent infection reduce severity infected. It‚Äôs 0.3 mL serum literally saves lives dozens times effectively.

No one encouraging wearing masks instead getting vaccinated. encouraging wearing masks addition vaccinated case counts drop orders magnitude. daycares area telling employees test definitely tell. Sad situation friend says husband wait fall known vaccine's effect body. wrong hope get Covid? know I'm going hell wishing someone I'm fucking sick rhetoric. children aren‚Äôt risk. deons matter get large part. odds something wrong happen less 1% anecdotal stories. I‚Äôm masks unvaccinated.  Vaccines work well, Spain seeing lowest death rate since 2020 April, cases all-time high. article bullshit. Good point. almost like people nearly every country planet, come together while, fly home, middle global pandemic, bad idea... vaccination rate among 50+ year olds Israel 92-93%, makes making 91.6% cases troubling. raw numbers still fairly small though, possible small sample throwing things off. 

I find hospitalization breakdown bit concerning. ratio fully vaccinated 50+ year olds hospital 3-4x normally expect based vaccine uptake age group, things equal vaccine that's 90-95% effective preventing hospitalization. think mask mandate no, cases always going rise Fourth July. three weeks mask mandate went away, number cases still low, week Fourth (which average people start testing positive) shit started hit fan again. Antivaxxers tend lean right, people right tend patriotic likely big unmasked Fourth July parties large amounts fellow unvaccinated people. like past winter cases starting spiking week ten days Thanksgiving another week Christmas. 

Being pandemic unvaccinated, need mask mandate businesses enforce proof vaccination enter. France millions people signed get vaccinated within couple days. honor system doesn‚Äôt work shit mask mandate nothing either, last month vast majority people I‚Äôve encountered public still masking even don‚Äôt to. suggested above, spread likely happening private home gatherings public places. needs done make lives difficult people haven‚Äôt vaccinated, especially haven‚Äôt done they‚Äôre apathetic it. US avoiding testing vaccinated people though, skews numbers opposite direction, mention pretty substantial proportion infections US still alpha vaccine effective, high use Moderna compared countries likely also provides better real world variant protection. Lol I‚Äôm arguing thought process framing people understand. Every person matrix head following virus depends weight likelihood outcome. 

We actually generally know real likelihood happen really varies depending local circumstances (how prevalent virus is, well immunized community is, vaccine you‚Äôre looking getting, variant prevalent, etc.) likely varies significantly lot people actually think (with unvaccinated likely overweighting vaccine side effects, underweighting vaccine effectiveness Covid likelihood + issues).  *wreak

But exactly this. immune systems know virus all, unless we've vaccinated we've virus before. viruses, inherited little immunity mother probably got bunch getting virus child, less harmful (and little bit base immunity). human Earth vaccinated COVID immunity it, rest bodies built scratch infection. gong show. cancelled all. Imagine event top competitors drop ""Eddie Eagle"" gets gold.

I wonder money changing hands fake test results. Ok thanks that. literally responding felt athletes

No isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs really hard thing ask anyone worldwide pandemic. Let‚Äôs see, risk lives (for good? Lol) postpone games? think that‚Äôs ATHLETES? I'm grateful school stated last year we'd fully masking every student could vaccinated... school goes 18 mos old. I‚Äôm wondering got 60% figure?

It might accurate. know. larger percentage population vaccinated, larger percentage hospitalized patients vaccinated. reason governments wanting everyone get vaccine put two things , fatalities viral mutation could send virus state every vaccine doesn‚Äôt work deaths continue get worse. Stimulants common Netherlands. bet people using catch lockdown. Hope implemented better QR codes etc Netherlands makes sense rolling sleeves booster lot physically fit people think muscles beat virus... Gyms, Yoga studios, Spin class people... think immune fit big thing gym go (thankfully im vax) Howdy!!!! mean‚Ä¶ herd immunity inevitable, anything. vaccinated eventually get infected get immunity natural way. Passing buck They‚Äôve sent athletes internationally country lower vaccination rates US... shouldn‚Äôt test they‚Äôre vaccinated?

Are high? Woof. That‚Äôs crazy. Everyone's excepting accept you. Obviously post could comprehend that. marathon training lot road cycling. i'm back moderate hiking now. took long time though. still intermittent chest tightness / pain cardiologist said stress echo fine could exercise again. i'm queue long haul covid clinic hoping see specialist sometime next couple months. look, excess deaths EVERY single country last year half, lot 

So either killed covid, mysterious thing secretly killing people hundreds thousands.

My money covid point masks still ""normal"", mask mandates even work context restaurants, bars, clubs similar environments. Here's big issue trying make local issue. places ultimately probably going need mask mandates places refuse institute them. Vulnerable people communities \*NEED\* federal government step protect them, local government going to. quick back envelope calculations involving hypothetical disease:

You invent vaccine 90% effective preventing death (pretty bloody good efficacy) persuade 90% people take (ruddy good uptake too).

What proportion people dying would expect vaccinated?

Well every 100 people would died pre-vaccination wave:

- 10 vaccinated still die

- 9 remaining 90 die

- 81 survive.

So deaths decline 81%, almost half die vaccinated people (9/19).

Stats like one headline keep getting thrown around manner likely lead vaccine hesitant people interpret headline suggesting vaccines best ineffective, worse, deadly. aren't.  universe implode delayed games 1 year???

No, lot rich people would lose money. Given high death rate India‚Äôs recent wave, think not. think immune system invincible. Truth virus found ways evade immune system lot smarter immune system. see new variants replicating faster body, without symptoms initially increase chances transmissions too. immune system recognise example Labrador, totally don‚Äôt recognise labradoodle.

Moral ethical judgments aside - likely NHS PCR test sufficient? 

The UK resources say fit fly certificate required, mandated CDC. airlines say travel requirements based arrival destination, I'm sure fit fly certificate fits that.  Technically goal organisms life cycle pass genetic material. usually means trying live maximum lifespan. CDC saying

The CDC talking alpha. delta hospitalizion numbers another month. 

But UK high vaccination rates among Middle aged people; under-30s well vaccinated now. numbers surprising, mean things US. UK 40 daily deaths 50,000 daily cases, US 250 daily deaths fewer cases. Vaccination 30-60 y.o. group makes huge difference. Anecdotally, compare yours, businesses frequent enforced it. Sounds like another genius plan! üôÑ seen nothing regarding Israel saying 60% efficacy symptoms. see somewhere?

My 80-90% number symptoms amalgamation various studies data, namely UK, Scotland, Canada, Singapore, Italy.

I seen Israel saying 64% efficacy infections, even declaration lot cloudiness around it. Cool, thanks, 60% seemed odd Nah knows full well risks. chooses lie money.

Selfishly wished situation could necessary. course, seems be, due diligence kids it. Hoping vaccines kids available sooner later start meaningful responses ""One time? Oh wow, cool!"" Ok makes sense I've also read people getting ""too strong"" immune reaction Moderna (young people). make sense you? also page 17 shows 163 vaccinated died vs 94 unvaccinated died (total). People 50+ double vaccinated deaths 50+ unvaccinated.

As India, strong data cases?

COVID patient hospital, someone else getting care could use.  checked nAb levels routine lab? Interesting, makes sense pretty much data have, nAbs tend peak two weeks past boost dose.

Antibodies one part immune response completely normal wane time. Cellular immunity (B cells) long lasting mature time (in good way). give year 2 heard like 98% people hospital vaxx people get good. long keep taking booster shots new variants come fine, let whatever, worth time thinking it. hospitalization increased deaths considerably lower vaccine compared Alpha variant struck.  People went profession basis medical science hold beliefs basis medical science?

Shocking. Cant even care would care you, sucks. grandmother wont get bc shes checking ready die, last standing like 7 siblings husband replies gotten falsely make assumption lethality orthogonal infectiousness genetic mutations. That's necessarily true.

Some viruses kill side effects immune system fighting -- usually flu kills instance. viruses kill side effects virus themselves.

In first case lethality *is* orthogonal infectiousness depends immune system stimulated quickly, transmissibility.

In second case virus infectious higher transmissibility (it moves person person lives surfaces longer) lethality unchanged long immune system able fight equally well. infectious virus bypass immune system (by evasion suppression) better see increase direct effects virus body. Yea leave man, smarter people took survive let go there.  Well, dentists, podiatrists, neurosurgeons legitimate medical professional insights COVID-19 affects oral, foot, neurological health therefore good reason urging vaccinations.

Even engineers physicists practice real sciences based empirical evidence.

Chiropractors quacks whose treatments repeatedly shown effective placebos best, harmful worst. basis science whatsoever. Delta, obviously?  Yea leave protected, choice. MY?

Every anti-vaxx argument I‚Äôve heard boils fear. fear forcing us live like longer.  largely security theater vaccinated unvaccinated going follow policy they're already now. seem like policy based science practical based human nature.

Maybe never rescended policy before, think put genie back bottle now. Antimaskers seem care anymore pro vaccine people pressing reason so. 

What's end game anyway? Anti vaxxers going anymore likely get vaccine, another metric we're waiting for? interesting see goes!   want choice. seems they‚Äôre quite good 95% symptomatic infections, everything I‚Äôve seen still 80-90% range, still pretty damn good. said vaccines OG covid came December, would thought miraculous too. They‚Äôve lost credibility, far I‚Äôm concerned understand seen manditory medical treatment 100% life death thing.

Doctors call something manditory medical treatment MAY cause death there's high likelihood (no certainty) long term consequences.

So 100 people denied ""necessarily medical treatment"" mean 100 people die. That's works. long reverse decision? quite carefully say Spanish Flu mutated. 1918 understanding things quite limited, enough confidence century old retrospective reconstruction present fact matter many scholarly papers published it.

That different question. Good luck UK!!!!!  think issue Delta vaccines MAY effective preventing symptomatic infection; however, remain almost effective preventing severe health outcomes. shit?! Ego continues one humanity's worst likely dooming traits see  people wearing masks getting sick bullshit talking point. give fuck either yet people ones crying 18+ months. Even vaccines fully effective always chance mutating? *Sad trombone noises*  NJ relatively safe? Interesting cause 0 fear tho... job haha ED RN here. thinking EXACTLY things today.

The trials double blind, show safety show efficacy. real difference EUA full approval, imminent anyway, full efficacy testing it‚Äôs completed limitations study based time passing. production allowed simultaneously done phases trials.  people like need protected. perfectly healthy people refuse get vaccinated selfish fools. real talk: way avoid everyone US getting fall/winter? CDC said we're done masks, lockdowns happen political shit storm would cause, vaccine numbers plateaued. Kids 12 can't get vaxxed back school, masks, etc.

I'm fully vaccinated, wife fully vaccinated, kids can't get vaccines. day care, neither places work requiring masks, see scenario get it. terrifying, also can't see way aside one us stopping working keeping home, wearing N95 day, every day.

Is seeming inevitability family getting fall catastrophizing, we're headed? THIS. Singapore, Covid, people wear masks, got hazy outside. personally wear one PM2.5 hit 150. Never wore sick. think many SEA would relate.

In February 2020, Covid started become problem, think 15% people actively wore masks, even crowded places.

That said, even though I've vaccinated, probably stop wearing mask couple months. Facebook absolute disaster humanity many ways. They‚Äôve also gotten away media using term ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù opposed ‚Äúdisinformation.‚Äù 

Anti-vax propaganda social media deliberate, intentional campaign. people mistakenly sharing incorrect information. organized.

Facebook‚Äôs response Biden‚Äôs remarks absolute disgrace. It‚Äôs clear motive profit. Profits based ‚Äúinteractions‚Äù highly dependent political polarization. Vaccination become one polarizing subjects, absolutely insane.

These variants treated lightly, yet they're far dangerous initial outbreak.

Anyone believes differently guilty wishful thinking. cruising October...I basically roped it, anxious dreading it. least balcony room ü§∑ wonder humanity try whole ""smart people deciding kill dumb people"" again...? good point.

The main counterargument kids eligible couple months, maybe end year 2-5 age range. Another 5% 10% vaccinated significantly cut number hospitalizations deaths needed reach herd immunity.

Another argument there's concept called overshoot. county at, say, 70% herd immunity, actually need 85% delta, start running 70% actually stop get almost 95%. pump breaks bit right time get 95% closer 85%. know right time, country whole tripled cases last month, so, maybe? internal polling Republican party shows base dying. think mean reactive. Reactionary strongly conservative political posture. 

It caught attention know quite people CDC exactly zero reactionaries :)

Consider democratic electoral location Washington DC. 92% voted Biden. However, vaccination rates mildding. next democratic electoral location Vermont, \*does\* highest vaccination rates.  


So, whats difference two? Age, Education wealth. remove political affiliation equation, still gap.  


[A recent shown vaccine hesitance dropped, still prevelant following groups: 

Age 18-39 
Participants without college degree 
and Households make less 50k year.  


the study also points lower economic minority groups tend hesitant vaccines generally, still play here.  


The South known education wealth.  


[538 saying politics may effect, factors important - like peer pressure age.  


So yes, politics may effect, factors greater effect vaccine hesitancy people ignoring political argument. whole chance get vaccine, get it, can't go hospital. Lets thin herd morons believe Jesus fairy tales science. Let pray away. think you‚Äôre getting feel it. think success, usually come quickly, suddenly, instantly? often.

I've found Marketplace super lucrative even compared identical listings ebay/Mercari/etc. Btw nice username, pretty sure I've seen around before. Blaine's pain truth. Infections sickness aren‚Äôt really question. Hospitalizations deaths are. don‚Äôt think anyone denying vaccinated person still develop symptoms. CDC said along. many people making seem though vaccinations don‚Äôt anything someone know got cough body aches days.



The actual data shows minimal risk vaccinated people really is:

Per CDC, vaccinated people .0000047% chance dying covid, .000025% chance hospitalized.   take back said &amp; apologize you. numbers high bc I'm higher vaxxed state. missed first link earlier see saying. Sorry hope isn‚Äôt dumb question.. couldn‚Äôt make new one?  Maybe media job, reported facts let people make minds, they'd credibility we'd done COVID. Instead, ZERO credibility nobody knows believe. clicks instilling fear people. start lab leak theory suppressed. Flagged facebook misinformation true. 

Now everyone onboard theory facebook culprit? Herd stupidity  Thank God Leon. still idea Larry JB created magical dynamic really care. simply one best duos comedy show think of. smallpox scares shit tbh. ever leaks lab somewhere nobody natural immunity anymore cut smallpox vaccine reserves. theory less hazardous strains would win bc could spread easily

That‚Äôs pretty common misunderstanding way various properties pathogen interact evolution. 

The method spread ability given dose virus cause infection, probability kill disable infected person, time interact go number people given infected person infects. Think control panel knob property. also interacting environment via things like social distancing, mask/ppe, vaccinations. 

Evolution constantly twiddling control knobs, mindlessly automatically. virus like HIV 100% lethal (before modern treatments) still spread like wildfire takes long enough. virus like Ebola highly lethal kill quickly easier spread. Variants aren‚Äôt evolving less lethal, spread better whatever environment they‚Äôre encountering. 

So basically turn lethality long also turn contagious is. offset. know you‚Äôre right. makes sick. might missed comment replied to. Regardless, getting fat smoking negative social consequences (you could even say fatness contagious, young kids getting fat fat parents). 

I'm universal health. think thing smelling shit pants, dawg. It‚Äôs scary many people buy BS. Here‚Äôs small  know Mississippi right 7 kids hospitalized Covid 2 ventilators. sure exact ages. feel like that‚Äôs good sign. 1. chances severe disease death significantly reduced. 

2. chances spreading lower.

3. vaccinated people means fewer future mutations. People nowadays would FINE polio. 

It's estimated 95 99 percent people contract poliovirus asymptomatic. known subclinical polio. Even without symptoms, people infected poliovirus still spread virus cause infection others.

It‚Äôs almost like covid stuff people get wrecked fine. :D 

sorry resist Yes hospitals gets overwhelmed choice. manage cases/deaths no. No. know say put oxygen mask first plane? It‚Äôs convey gotta help you‚Äôre able help others. many vaccine hesitant, may feel already helped need steps. so, consequence, issue extends longer.

Yes are. wanna wear mask since vaccinated. Idk that... lot people hesitant give kids shots. 

And lot kids gotten covid instead.

Vaccines may certainly helpful tool tool kit, although take several years deployed point existing virus likely start dying own. US something like 48% fully vaccinated, globally something like 12%. need something like 90% 95% percent Delta variant. expectation 2023 2024 widespread vaccination globally. think vaccines going helpful everyone thinks short run. course first covid shots start losing efficacy 6 12 months, new variants likely coming along time.

I think need stop putting chips vaccines, start thinking terms suite measures deploy keep effects virus manageable. One strategy obviously things like masking improving indoor ventilation substantially, avoiding high-risk behaviors venues. Another looking better treatments help people infected virus recover quickly fewer long-term symptoms.

A tool box one tool pretty useless.

I watching days Gibraltar british enclave Spain, population 99,99% vaccinated Pfizer (from statistics said fully vaccinated population still hundreds vax know what), delta arrived weeks ago, cases rising. first days cases unvaccinated, last days mostly vaccinated. means probably unvaccinated contaged even much immunity.

Herd stoopidity full effect. many lives getting ready lost damaged needlessly. Yes, extremely infuriating!!! üò° UK government particularly open delivery schedules vaccines, bit hard know supply situation like.

However, regarding recent drop vaccination rate: UK heavily relied AstraZeneca vaccine rollout earlier year (something like 60% doses given AZ). However, giving AZ anybody 40 due reported side effects (and probably also balanced lower efficacy AZ). means effectively vaccination right Pfizer Moderna, UK much less supply of.

The J&amp;J vaccine effectively used UK. officially approved, dont think available supplies. also unclear effective Delta variant ( first doses vaccines appear markedly less effective Delta earlier variants ), leaning heavily may mistake.  understand it, expiring soon, bad ethical point view.

The right choice. :)  lose australia doenst improve vaccination rate. Victoria cant keep lockdowning forever either Wonder region live (North Jersey) would considered ""poorly vaccinated."" mean, never thought ever would be, knowing even Los Angeles somehow failed muster levels could successfully prevent second mask mandate worries me. Fair point - pretty wild similarities counties moron, places extremely low vaccination rates. Went home depot NY weekend. Place packed. see single mask on, including clearly 12 crowd. Biden's administration objectively effing badly last infuriating.  wearing mask also puts social pressure people vaccinated (yet dumb) wear mask.

There's also possibility unvaccinated people see mask wearing/mandate proof vaccine effective continue get shot.

 Worried relatives still gotten yet, want relief itself. Well winter flu season going hit hard, practically non-existent last year. People need viruses lives make stronger, living bubble isn‚Äôt good mass populace. 

Locking everyone summer letting outside winter (at time 100 people cram small pubs heating circulation) catch new variants cough end hospital alongside many flu patients good.

Inconceivable!!!!  Lockdowns coming back, esp red places like Ohio.
There poltiical desire. Oh oh!! Here‚Äôs trouble, though. Point 1 (chance severe disease lowered). I‚Äôm already low risk outcome large numbers young(ish) healthy people. vaccine cannot protect threat I‚Äôm worried (permanent loss smell, cognitive functioning, energy, etc. I.e. long covid), interest vaccination drops dramatically. Now, it, even want boosters (because help achieve goal‚ÄîNO infection), know lot people simply treat covid vaccine like treat flu vaccine now. doesn‚Äôt stop covid, won‚Äôt care anymore care flu vaccines making flu less severe. 

This thinking turn covid vaccine something old sick, majority. 

Maybe boosters bump protection infection. I‚Äôd least hold hope trying normalize getting (mild) covid despite vaccination status.   see Indonesia length time. There's much poverty, average person needs stream income eat. vaccine people limited access Sinovac, effective. tragedy. 

That said, there's cure stupid. plenty people world believe God protect virus. quantify reach someone‚Äôs free speech rights? followers? tax returns? public campaign somewhere ban people report account, spam them, something? seems like accounts taken whatever way possible best interest everyone. believe it‚Äôs harming kids (like anti-vaxxers) even though it‚Äôs  Please explain? course. here. Spain, virus festival pretty much same, pretty reasons, i.e., wait reopen damn nightclubs.

5 days go second dose every night count one day less think whether I'll able dodge virus then. would extremely frustrating catch - first obvious reason (being careful time end catching limited partial immunity, right finish line) also means getting second dose all, OK travel within EU outside that, knows (not countries adhere theory infected people need doses).

Good luck! existing list COVID symptoms prior Delta wasn‚Äôt already long enough don‚Äôt like weather/Covid variant, wait minutes.  Brits true heroes. Good luck guys, world watching. make without major casualties rest world free well. Historians going lot write future last 4-6 years.

Total...i guess. 85 adult really make sense things can‚Äôt happen without Covid relief isn‚Äôt table.

We need learn freak case counts ebb flow. risk populations fully vaccinated don‚Äôt face scenario overrun hospitals. 

Plus would contradictory impose restrictions vaccinated. CDC didn‚Äôt say fully vaxed people ditch mask *only case counts low*. Vaccinated people safe severe cases transmit much lower clip. 

There going back anything like 2020 fully vaccinated people straight going put that.  way we've approached pandemic respect children fucking travesty.

Are people refused Covid-19 vaccines kind people would normally getting flu shot? among people vaccination, normally conscientious getting flu shot, could conceivably see *greater* normal uptake flu vaccines, since pandemic experience strong reminder benefits getting vaccinated? 

And another commenter pointed out, there's still greatly reduced international air travel, flu expected spread slowly? repeating next pandemic.

Thankfully science improved. country? don‚Äôt understand, countries reporting much better data terms effectiveness Delta strain. people count, matter members human race. one people care you? Sorry, point. Vaccination saturation reached Eastern Europe, Western Europe, especially Spain Portugal, still supply problem. [Here's graphic illustrates quite daily vaccination rate peaks falls back early 2021 levels, saturation likely reached unless new supply issues develop. US reached saturation quite ago, UK Netherlands also arrived. Germany, Austria Switzerland far behind, clearly see vaccination rates fallen dramatically peak. Spain Portugal seem highest demand European countries, need supply.  There's drastically reduced flu circulation pandemic. know that's predicted make easier harder predict strains vaccinate against? Could conceivably see greater normal uptake flu vaccines, since pandemic experience strong reminder benefits getting vaccinated? another commented out, there's still greatly reduced international air travel, flu would expected spread slowly. Delta Lambda? countries happen in? good news right since people concerned lambda would worse Delta? irony, though! turned away though, lockdowns contributed along government policy, obsession GP's nothing still outright refusing see patients.

The NHS awful pandemic. Covid perfect excuse NHS treat people.

I know first hand there's entire wards nurses barely saw patient first lockdown, second too.

There reason condense Covid cases certain hospitals, others running treatments.  mean, Italian study doesn‚Äôt contradict Swedish one all. show natural antibodies quite long lasting.  Pretty much same. tired neglected, fucking chance vaccinated yet. Please stop narrative open everybody risk chosen. haven‚Äôt seen single article exponential rise cases due breakthrough cases. link? South Korea never lockdowns outside heavily localized regions cities large case spikes. Yet another false dilemma. UK also vaccinating 15-18 year olds. Assuming another comment read correct, even young people got first dose soon possible chance get second dose early August, fully vaccinated late August. I'm Canada fully vaccinated, young person UK I'd pretty pissed opportunity fully vaccinated everything opened completely. still know enough long term effects disease, they're gambling long-term health young adults instead giving chance fully protected. sick healthcare workers vaccinated. lot change symptoms driven vaccination status rather variant though. main changes delta variant compared previous variants runny noses far common, whilst loss smell taste far less common. fire anyone vaccinated. Good luck proving it. knew anyone selfish enough get vaccinated would shame either caved lived like hermit. everyone else know. you, I'd keep dirty little secret. Nobody welcome social circle unless fully vaccinated. know anyone feel way. someone US, I'm honestly worried athletes bringing back disease here. We've got community spread delta everywhere. hope counties handling covid better able quarantine needed.

Amazing watch, sad real.  symptomatic infection.. point vaccine dont die, many times needs said  waiting everyone chance fully vaccinated mean: allowing virus develop resistant variants. ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù attitude won't. look recent news there, seem suffering outbreak too. 

Decisions balance - free open without vaccines approach let's stay locked till covid exist. Whatever England falls towards striking balance. Dude, $$$$$$$$, mean ¬•¬•¬•¬•¬•¬•¬•¬• Diseases got dragged conservative culture wars. specifically, Trump wrong disease. 

And he's malignant narcissist, tried downplay hide he'd admitting fault. prominent expert started get attention, moved undermine Trump would keep spotlight himself. 

All all, conservatives made Trump center culture wars. Trump made sure culture wars him.  UK many fully vaccinated. us 30s younger mostly received one vaccine far. don‚Äôt get 2nd dose another 4 weeks. Netherlands, many still waiting second jab. I've mine last week takes two weeks call 'fully vaccinated'. made appointments soon could, age group allowed to, gotten earlier. Many still fully vaccinated!

 I'm sure rest EU though. Everyone know completely excepting decisions. Don‚Äôt understand I‚Äôm ruining future bud  Agreed edited. However point remains cases turned away demand rising covid cases, lockdown. Lockdown stop getting even worse. What's vax injury SAW COMING?!?!?!!!!!!!!! takes 14 days infection show symptoms, one month ‚Äúlong COVID‚Äù? really outdoors looks tbf, marquee There‚Äôs ton room cases still hundreds deaths day. rates US still level countries take lot precautions. no, don‚Äôt think masks forever, think thousand new cases day state, 500 hospitalized, half adults vaccinated, it‚Äôs soon. I‚Äôd also fine vaccine passport system instead, everyone who‚Äôs unmasked public actually vaccine. way stands right family can‚Äôt even safely run quick errand number people unmasked unvaccinated. I‚Äôm even asking able go bars concerts. I‚Äôm asking able safely get groceries. Agree confounder, although hard account (people want get vaccinated might also want get tested sniffles, different reasons, hard say direction cases-vs-infections balance shifts). definitely right confounds numbers.

And yes, importantly, others rightly pointed me, asymptomatic (or too-mild-to-test) infections high portion vaccinated infections would much support take griped about, would skew numbers citing opposite directions (fewer cases prevented, better percentage cases made mild-or-asymptomatic). think *know* case (no data I'm aware of, tricky obtain without mass-testing asymptomatic people), certainly could be. Say posters back. /r/Olympics also says unvaccinated training partner 18 parents allow get vaccine. Awful true. Current status quo. Eh still getting close seems. It‚Äôs completely linear. 

Cases - importantly severe cases - still way down.  Delta still running throats infect. 

If drop 90% increase 100%‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre still 80% yeah, couple weeks ago, European countries started diverge. Spain still going strong vaccine program, Germany slowing down. Canada isn‚Äôt close fully open! Ontario, populous province, still restrictions. Masks worn public places, stores still capacity limits, social gathering limits, aren‚Äôt mixing maskless transportation, clubs bars yet. Israel reporting 64% efficacy rate Delta infections.

Which means 3 unvaccinated people would infected, instead 1 vaccinated person would far cry ""virtually every covid case unvaccinated person.""  Mandate actual compliance two different things. zero plan wearing one unless company forces (which vocal about). 

Don‚Äôt expect stop going socializing one though. business ignoring mandates gets immediate consideration book well visit. keep making assumptions even flatly omit facts health climate here. idea made believe anti-vaxxer, guess that's another way trying discredit position. 

The truth matter is, U.S. hardly went proper lockdown. start, strong anti-mask sentiment despite *particular* institutions like schools government offices closing down, businesses like continued run, without masks social distancing - even CDC mandate. many people prioritize convenience well-being others. COVID every opportunity spread US allowed it. CDC lifted mask restrictions back May, couple months vaccine available public? portion population vaccinated? way establishments know certain fully vaccinated safe take mask, another anti-mask/vaxxer waiting excuse? That's we've suffered spikes there. Thankfully, severity last year, still concerning.

While I'm grateful vaccines got effective prevention are, greatest boon lessening severity symptoms still get infected. prevented hospitalizations saved lives, still infected become long-hauler complications road. That's worry high-risk loved ones.

While accept COVID never truly going away, understand *will* manageable like flu, polio, etc, time *more effort*. I'm sure 5-10 years now, we'll position we'd hardly think it, we're yet. None illnesses immediately became afterthoughts vaccines introduced - there's still grace period getting majority public. That's COVID, precautions dropped way soon. waited get vaccination rates making call, patronizing false assumptions made national misstep misstep handling ignorant arrogant best. give cites? testing mild/asymptomatic cases?

Israel, example, reporting efficacy rate Delta infection 64%, would mean lots lots cases among vaccinated people. I'm still surprised nobody shot movie dystopian future everyone goes around masks account pollution, masks actually crew's covid safety. healthcare system handle else lockdown again

Really reason lockdown protect healthcare system   Might well put vaccine good use. What‚Äôs source claim nearly half children respiratory issues months infection? athletes refused vaccination fear vaccine affecting performance. I‚Äôd like know infected vaccine status. could ugly quarter front us. School closures, full hospitals, temporary hospitals, body bags, worst ‚Ä¶ microbreweries closed business. Ffs, get vaccinated people, bad habits serve. get ""post-viral"", smart guy Don‚Äôt remember half country vaccines trump, maybe 5% think concerns spread virus Japan athletes/ team officials returning home countries infections causing outbreaks. quarantine get home safety.

I hope one dies infection Olympics. already official team hospitalized Japan - athlete older person comorbidities. Polio guaranteed killer either. caused life long problems, like crippling people life. Israel ‚Äúcrushed‚Äù Delta. long need piece cloth! impactful wearing socks scarf.   money comment continues take hold although part training regimes also weighed heavily. lot olympians get one olympics amount training even carry another year enormous. Also much Tokyo setup temporary, pushing another year would likely required relocating, potentially even Japan. 

The money thing gets thrown around reason it‚Äôs that. includes almost Europe well

Not true all. think selective pressure acting way suggesting. 

If Delta gets 50% lethal, still doubt going take even measures took last year control it. People generally going stand lockdowns IFR goes 0.6% 0.9%, largely among unvaccinated.  real shame people conduct in-person acting singing classes. There's really downside wear mask supermarket mall, L.A. full businesses feel downside especially severely.

No one vaccinated wear mask acting class. killing businesses. Throwing shit fan? going backfire spectacularly. know science works? change position more/better information comes light. Early on, encouraged wash hands masking early evidence pointed transmission via touch. soon changed recognize spreads principally via aerosols mouth. understand that, ideologues idiots, changing one's position makes sense. ideology idiocy excuse. never allowed eradicate disease thinks genetic? Everyone family got jab one anything sore arm  People need get vaccinated pandemic could with. People literally dying get vaccines countries. stupidity about. mean, honestly strain virus really understand well really 1-2(?) years hard data go by. even really know sure long term effects virus has. Personally i'll err side caution keep masked up. made right choice. Thanks us, I‚Äôm even living US. know hospitals empty despite surge cases, right? know vaccine works Delta variant, you? do, keep spreading fear there's longer anything afraid since vaccines work?

It's sad real. Wow. guy stupidest human ever. Omg. Yes, anti-vaxxers suck. aren‚Äôt wear mask them- absolutely get delta even vaccinated. years ago, could seen post like said ""that's definitely troll"".

These days, I'm sure. conservative governing bodies outright barred local jurisdictions anything. AZ, first two waves, cities counties took lead implementing restrictions, [latest \[Arizona\] Senate packed budget conservative policy priorities, including ... host items targeting enforcement coronavirus restrictions. include bans cities requiring vaccines ordering mask mandates pandemic surges similar restrictions schools state colleges universities. That‚Äôs Ontario. west essentially fully open. Sounds like someone pretends everything okay money Israel trying extrapolate rather small bump new cases. UK one watch. shit. Cool thanks sharing. rules turn ""limit social interaction indefinitely"" ""entire industries allowed exist anymore"", risk society. many people would actually follow rules months now? would even enforce them?

Restrictions done temporarily surges keep healthcare system intact, enacting seemingly never-ending basis deal endemic virus option. 1. never meant safe engage every risky activity possible, huge amount time, precautions.

2. sort event past (in beforetimes), even festival 100% outside--which unclear me--the attendees almost certainly going afterwards bars, house parties, similarly risky places. numbers used bit ""washed"". Like drop R consider many things. many infections prevented, many infectious on. 

Also people vaccinated, harder virus get person person number chains drops, alpha first doses massively dropped 50%. imagine 4 person family, one vaccination reduces statistical risk 50% - that? half quarter? draw 4 dots connect - 6 lines - remove one dot - 3 dots 3 connections - 3 potential ways transmission. cutting many potential ways, balance missing efficacy out. Exactly same, opposite. business isn‚Äôt taking care customers won‚Äôt get money again. employment - there‚Äôs list companies I‚Äôd never work bc response employee safety  Anyone else looking 59 think: Yeah, ain't surprising.

Yeah, people going test positive. ain't end world. far relevant much things get spread. athletes vaccinated thus shedding/spreading much? masked time distanced? contacts ID'd quarantined?

60 cases tens thousands even olympics started (loads athletes already several days) yet really warning flags me. 

We could delayed another year still would seeing similar numbers entry COVID going away year. Great. adopt policy US, anti-vaxxers complain we‚Äôre ‚Äúturning China.‚Äù test people symptomatic? People shedding virus they're symptomatic. fact, time symptom onset may time peak infectiousness.

You think Covid-19 test non-symptomatic person Covid-19 contagiousness test. Ya isn‚Äôt going fly me. I‚Äôm wearing mask actual endgame. must super powers! ""Could"" actually critical word context--it means ""we know yet, yet everything opening masks coming many countries."" case Israel, ""could"" reason Israel mandating masks indoors considering reimplementing control measures. yeah let's pretend ""could mean anything."" paraphrase George Carlin - imagine average American. realize half country stupider that. Still get neurological symptoms though cannot comprehend anti-vax mentality   hope stays way time boosters cover variants available. Last thing need vaccinated people suddenly needed hospitalized there's room anywhere anymore. good know. could sworn saw post sub couple days ago suggesting otherwise. point understand reason wear masks, might complete utter moron. ""So LoCkDoWNs fOrEveR?!?!"" Normally breakthrough cases minor symptoms like runny nose feeling weak. know sister breakthrough case delta variant symptoms lasted 3 days disappeared. think people look broadly. Wearing masks grocery stores really hard. far work places, think really depends environment people, company feels many people vaccinated, spacing people such. definitely feel Schools mask mandates kids Vaccinated.   Money probably big driver, athletes. It‚Äôs hard ask get geared yet 3rd straight year. can‚Äôt vaccinated?  90%+ efficiency delta, alpha. It‚Äôs looking like it‚Äôs around 70% delta. Israel puts 60%. scenario would give disproportionately high rates severe disease, majority people vaccinated getting tested least symptomatic. Totally fine -- interact all. (I'm boat.) I'm simply curious region US going (literally) live die amount immunity caused natural disease. vaccination rate laughably low, masking social distancing. plausible many (or most) folks around virus last winter, sick enough require medical help, thereby allowing part official stats.

Well Cares Act left type paid Covid leave hands individual employer, vaccinated person willing get tested they‚Äôre experiencing symptoms? would forfeit two weeks pay order allow CDC get accurate count? People see information come different conclusions level risk, people also vary drastically level risk-tolerance.

I'm UK, seems make sense least give young adults chance get fully vaccinated. that's position middle ""restriction-friendliness"" spectrum, far cry ""lockdown forever, re-open never!"" I'm bit surprised indifferent people potential serious long term health effects non-severe infections. notion death outcome matters, young people die, seems pretty myopic. This. goes form live entertainment too. wondered lot unvaccinated people complacent case numbers would feel motivated get vaccinated cases started going up. Glad see people state woken finally. ‚ÄúCould‚Äù doesnt mean anything. Basic reading comprehension. Oh sure, varying levels.  think problem start latest surge know exactly vaccines work latest variant, yet everything opening masks coming (well, were, many places rolling back). basically opening assumption vaccines effective new variant without really knowing, turns case, end hospitals overwhelmed even prior surges (because masks social distancing r0 closer infecting 5 people new variant 2 first). argument vaccine nothing... Ding ding ding. can‚Äôt easily diagnosed, patient must crazy brushed aside. It‚Äôs infuriating. Florida pretty much open year. South Dakota states never closed all. US lower case rates UL right nevertheless. Probably won‚Äôt last there‚Äôs unpredictability regardless restrictions.  quarantine get home safety.

Maybe athlete Uganda country low vaccination rates, athlete returning country high vaccination rates easy ability obtain vaccinations like US going Olympics dangerous packed UFC stadium crowded club. topic now. people really thought many music theatre programs schools destroyed. That‚Äôs awful lot culture sapped generation. It‚Äôs preventing death. What‚Äôs great vaccine it‚Äôs still preventing serious severe illness require hospitalization. Covid isn‚Äôt thing people need treatment for! both! list reasoning Lol fighting COVID ? 

Covid-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2 virus. like HIV virus AIDS disease.

It usually takes longer day two show symptoms (such fatigue) exposure.

Given vaccinated, find unlikely could happen fast, unlikely first place. 

There harm getting test talking doctor. Lots old rural folks dieing plague burns areas. someone NY-- middle America. lot non-coastal US basically thought got deserved. Meanwhile still nightmares walking get groceries walking past freezer trucks dead bodies, trying watch Netflix hearing ambulances knowing means. 

Will never live near hospital :/ hell vaccinated travel? understand that, dad isn‚Äôt vaccinated either doesn‚Äôt lupus. also don‚Äôt isolate wear masks. go church service rural Tennessee every week mostly filled unvaccinated people continue eat inside restaurants. I‚Äôve thought agreeing see quarantine two weeks prior visit honestly don‚Äôt think would stop going church two weeks. I‚Äôm important them. I'm vaccinated, people area are, kids get them, I'll still wear one going stores such. I'm happy small vocal group area pushing unvaccinated kids wear masks School. Especially since parents like brag getting vaccine.  Lol. gonna keep throwing salty/empty insults way going form argument like adult thread? government today government say 10 years. Would feel comfortable previous administration policing speech? would not. precisely vaccinated kids they've little enough experience contagious disease anti-vax now. Yep. IOC ultimately final say whether games proceed, host country. we're literally going kill strongest healthiest humans

Lol.

What's vaccination rate incoming athletes? North 80%?

None people going die. Breakthrough cases lead death almost completely older sicker age ranges.

So, leaves us another 2000 athletes unvaccinated. What's CFR age range assuming extremely healthy people? Less 0.05%? [This source found. early pandemic, suggests 0.04% 10-19 year olds 1.0% 20 year olds would go Pretty sure less 1 20 hospitilized 20 year olds die, even literally every single unvaccinated athlete got it, still expect one die.

Now, honest discussion risk Japanese workers populations areas hosting games. Sure, discussion, let's real, HIGHLY unlikely lose even single athlete.  article literally says could lower symptomatic infection serious illness: then, ministry said vaccine 64 percent effective preventing infection 93 percent effective preventing serious illness. figures presented Sunday evening coronavirus task force indicate numbers high.

Edit: Serious illness (which one three main selling points vaccine--symptomatic infection, serious illness, death) miss something? 

Did see catastrophe countries states lockdowns? 

We actual lockdowns vaccines even lower IFR, plan?

Never change redditors. It‚Äôs also region plagued government propaganda foreign influence past 100 years, Russia constantly trying undermine government. It‚Äôs hard people trust anyone authority. huge surges without locking already. know risk already. know previous variants rarely spread outdoors. delta infectious prevalent outdoor spread? Yes, end, - 96% reduction. Meaning, making 88% less likely get it. do, *NOT 96%* less likely severe. like 50-75% less likely severe (that's get total 96). still good, at-risk person, still quite worried got breakthrough case. want comforted breakthrough cases unlikely, that's vaccines appear best at. RemindMe! 2 weeks Replacing children easy nowadays though lot countries declining birth rates. like women still get 5 children like 19th century one dies still enough left. children grow working age adults. agree. like everyone non-racist liberal side. Every side shitbirds usually vocal minority.  shame rest us can't vaccinated. I'm hoping situation changes August, stay doors pray one else brings me. 

I hope though focus research assistance provided long covid. There's 2 million people UK currently affected, numbers expected rise. deserve forgotten left behind. We‚Äôve somehow moved ‚Äútwo weeks slow spread‚Äù ‚Äúneed make sure hospitals don‚Äôt get overwhelmed‚Äù ‚Äúwe need live zero COVID world 99% infections mild/asymptotic still acceptable‚Äù

I don‚Äôt get moved goal posts ladder. Adults chance get vaccinated.  Kids worse impacted COVID many flu seasons.  Severe breakthrough infections incredibly rare. immunocompromised small population set taking mitigation‚Äôs measures (masks, distancing) even without COVID. 

It‚Äôs time move on, thoughts prayers willingly unvaccinated make excuses them. People young 12 could received vaccine months over-abundance vaccines available. People refuse take it. clear, I'm saying work - say, care preventing severe disease, long that, good. two things - preventing cases (A) preventing cases severe (B). 

What I'm saying vaccines lot better (A) (B) studies I've seen (honestly looking study suggesting that's case). B might anywhere 25-75%. breakthrough infections maybe 25-75% better full blown COVID, certainly consider ""just sniffles""! old person, breakthrough case could absolutely deadly! 

The older person taking heart fact breakthrough case *unlikely*, vaccines lose front, think need take hard look much risk remains.   !remindme 2 months recall, study based self-reported surveys, may subject response bias. (If didn‚Äôt get sick, aren‚Äôt sick, you‚Äôre likely fail return survey, etc.) number likely lower reality. 

Plus, don‚Äôt really know yet long ‚Äúlong‚Äù is. researchers looking symptoms 1 3 months later. took 3 months get Mono. doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm still suffering now, six years later. I‚Äôm fine now. I‚Äôve colds lingering cough 2-3 months. (That smoker, still.) 

I think get time research, we‚Äôre going find relatively permanent cases. 100% true He's getting primaried trying save lives.

I think there's better nutshell description messed America is.  Philippines poorer Indonesia, still much stricter lockdowns periodically. Covid numbers looking much better thing Facebook responsible making rules apply all. decided remove posts true push agenda decide keep posts break rules turn profits. Facebook arbiter information can't expected that, set rules follow them. 

Listen first say use social media. besides Reddit, discussion usually go past headline that's appreciate. I'll minded lack ability verify yeah use it. Facebook job moral, users job idiots though people choose that's fault. US gymnast tested positive vaccinated, social media posts weeks ago saying won‚Äôt get vaccine There's widely accepted data showing Delta deadly, contagious. Maybe ‚ÄúThe Show State‚Äù shows real Covid actually ? Give time, future mutation start affecting kids narrative change. probably ton conspiracy blame game attached. 

I'm saying petty, reality. Many people knew COVID-19 would continue mutate 1st day heard it; hell that's infected humans 1st place get (have) new flu vaccine every year. chose wrong option manipulate masses backfired. stimulus check anyone vaccinated?

they actually that. Though, guise 'lottery' prize.

But really, instead one big payout, make $10k payout give million vaccinated people, still 'a lottery'. Meanwhile, Tennessee banned outreach minors vaccines like Polio. doesn‚Äôt make COVID less issue. ignore severe long term damage? Death isn‚Äôt consequence getting COVID. Enjoy permanent lung vascular damage.

Also Delta variant much higher death rate 0.2% agree - matters much disease prevented, vaccines *both* preventing cases (A) preventing cases becoming severe (B). point size effect (A) significantly (B) every study I've seen. say 'breakthrough cases almost always mild' really exaggerating (B). saying it‚Äôs right thing do, already delayed games 1 year. Another year would put summer winter games season, I‚Äôm assuming bad IOC

They‚Äôre hell bent getting sweet, sweet, TV revenue year Wrong question. 1) still infect people older, immunocompromised 2) Covid debilitate body ways require hospital ICU, either future. Sometimes permanently. lost virus first hit. Nobody said was. That's something UK needs learn, ""gradually""! Thanks know basics evolution. actually kind wrong. micro scale mutations random. macro scale evolution driven response environmental pressures. test lot, may push towards strains come positive since would spread easily. suggest critical reading peoples comments gauge knowledge. sharing bio 101 info comment make obvious errors, asking info virologists would hard time giving solid answer to, maybe gap understanding want look into.

People keep talking shitty conservatives LA are, time realize racist. Alot Hispanic communities LA conservative, like Asian communities. Yeah, heartbreaking stuff. I‚Äôd feel dumb. madness US many doses walk grocery store, pharmacy, clinic hospital get vaccinated cases without appointment.

And US athletes hanging US athletes, surely vaccinated. KC MO well. Mother law nurse jail nearby refuses get well already COVID pretty sure.. many ppl admitted hospital ICU infected ones? really good news. one anecdote folks know didn‚Äôt get vaccinated probably 75% got COVID toward end year.

From US perspective, even far left liberals moderate conservative spectrum compared world.

So maybe everyone racist conservative party, it‚Äôs really okay differential either - that‚Äôs pretty much thing. 100% correct. main problem politicians even try. even knowledge understanding even begin try. said old hags need removed people understand put place start try. biggest gap modern era laws, regulate ""online society"" pretty good real world what's cloud. wild west way is, like laws regulating companies dumping waste water supplies. society citizens fix demanding politicians fix get boot.

The real sad part easiest form communication masses instead people want argue instead working together find resolution, look thread. people arguing Facebook evil want stop even understand root problem, friends grandparents eat disinformation breakfast believe it. infinite information finger tips choose believe meme vs googling research paper explanation deciding themselves. That's madness! require vaccinated? put vaccinated athletes risk. Children constantly forgotten. Oh can't get it...uh bs kids hospitals rn.   tested fell ill. Everyone except children truly immunocompromised. common cold flu.  Even die, US citizens might care huge medical bills love much Yeah, agree math (i.e. total effectiveness vs hospitalization combination protection infection protection hospitalization conditional getting infected. EDIT: formula looks messy, think we're page).

It's actual data I've seen, protection infection conditional protection. Agree Israel saying 95% total vs hospitalization 60% infection, imply 90% conditional protection, say. seen data encouraging *any* source know Israel's raw data. hope honestly 60% number correct. looking cases-per-week curve hospitalizations-per-week curve OWID, 90% conditional protection number seems almost impossible. BOOOOOOOMMMM. 

LOL :-) think I‚Äôve finally moved stage comments make laugh instead rage. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs actually good thing Hospitals, schools, roads make shit death, that's dark. According Google Australian movers. people transport furniture others changing homes. find weird Florida, Missouri, Arkansas get talked reddit hot spots, Nevada unscathed biggest remaining unknown terms vaccines vs. Delta -- lots vaccinated people willing accept risk getting feels like cold/flu week, lot less willing symptoms months. 

Unfortunately uncommon: ""The researchers found 23% patients one month coronavirus infection sought medical care conditions sought treatment prior infection. total included nearly half patients hospitalized Covid-19, 27% people either mild moderate Covid-19 symptoms, 19% people identified asymptomatic."" Year year look good. trend continues winter could peak higher last. 


""Statewide, 81% people 65 84 gotten least one dose COVID-19 vaccine, compared 41% people 25 34 years old."" happens focus 65 long. Thanks details! hard believe people work hard compete get vaxxed protect efforts.  crushing work like hell get sidelined last moment. Let's say sinking ship fully Africans limited amount rescue boats. practically Titanic scenario. can't save everyone. sure Africans put children boats elderly people? So, clear here... I'm toddler, millions Americans scared get vaccinated also refuse keep masking voluntarily? tf go criticize them, shame selfish wussies right thing? right thing situation, others. long supposed carry load anti-vax morons? Honestly could go forever people opting get vaccinated longer personal responsibility. truly great news hope you‚Äôre staying safe there! Absolutely correct. That's ***all*** about...MONEY! gives fuck peoples' lives/health. 

Totally absurd. must come legislature happen.

To add this, state legislature comprised people like Jena Powell introduced legislation try stop Vax-a-Million program announced. Reggie Stoltzfus(and party) tanked Name/Image/Likeness bill extremely bi-paritsan forcing ban Trans student athletes last minute. 

Or ones things like include provisions state budget allow healthcare providers discriminate LGBTQ+ people, banned vaccine requirements schools, want ban mask requirements, can't pass bill make spousal rape crime. 

[Also DeWine backwards hack thinks propaganda DARE pushes Marijuana yea, semblance competent leader DeWine might shown first 3 weeks March 2020 extremely character him.

So long story short, lockdowns masks coming back Ohio, least government mandated thing. I'd even go far say private businesses allowed require masks comes point. Missourian, care less die. would make state slightly less shitty. Kids anti-vax make another 6 months prob able get vaccinated too. commenter said, wouldn‚Äôt much issue counts kept low. preventable people part- vaccination masks distancing situation calls it. point is, wish people would stop thinking people can‚Äôt get aren‚Äôt making willful choice get it.  might indicate can, country made position won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs rocket science.

And second point, wait another month two, you‚Äôre heading autumn schools back. They‚Äôve already waited another month. Yes. Yes would have. 

/$ really feel medically vulnerable people poor countries without vaccinations. anti vaxers really little sympathy point. also South African soccer Olympic teams descended Japanese capital weekend, two South African soccer players tested positive virus, becoming first athletes confirmed infections inside Olympic South African Football Association said whole team put quarantine ‚Äî first match three days away. allowed compete test negative six hours match.

In another page can‚Äôt make up, South Africans scheduled play match against, guessed it, Japan. said vaccinated, mask longer required safety safety others. true, wrecking credibility think one thing kind muddies waters lot difference infection disease. think proper way putting things primary goal achievement vaccines prevent lessen disease, less good, still pretty-damn-good preventing infection. easy take disease infection synonymous not, care taken looking headlines data appear contradictory fact talking different things. Things get even trickier word ""cases"" used need know author means say that. Takeaway: misanthropic, vain incompetent ‚Äòleaders‚Äô project fear people‚Äôs righteous wrath rush defense. people better leaders better outcomes. authoritarian narrative foisted Hollywood power elites expresses dire pessimism society persuades weak-minded, fearful among us participate spreading unreasonable fears ‚Äòthe mob‚Äô. 

When lockdown brought bear community, one member predicted ‚Äòrebellion riots‚Äô among poor (Blacks) city. course thing occurred rebellions heard white supremacist groups fostered astroturf-style guess who? That‚Äôs right, wealthy elites wanted push narrative public health measures insufferable, assault Liberty. Polio 99.8% survival rate, Fauci. lot recent messaging largely ""it's supposed prevent cases, supposed make mild"". find disingenuous. mistaken this?

I negative response that, giving benefit doubt.

What rephrased ""who cares breakthrough infections, they're effectively sniffles, care preventing severe disease."" really think selective pressure reduce positivity rate tests personally sub suddenly talking long-Covid much now? mean yeah know it‚Äôs always thing, people seem think asymptomatic cases even lead long Covid? Also I‚Äôm getting impression people think long Covid far common actually is. Hilarious. actually going take precautions keeping clean, know, taking vitamins, exercising, that‚Äôs basically entire time pandemic,‚Äù said resident Nichole Brumme. padded chamber? Savage thing posted says Delta Pfizer 88% effective symptomatic 96% effective hospitalization. preventing cases, reducing severity. Anti-vaxxers let children die believing there's nothing else do. 95% hospitalization 80% infection implies 75% protection conditional infected. 

But, good thing vaccines like AZ (or Pfizer Israel data), see lower effective disease. 60% disease 95% hospitalization implies 90% increased protection disease conditional getting it.

The view people expect effectiveness disease slowly wane stout protection hospitalization remain. ""if get cold"" comes in. That‚Äôs American way looking life, certainly. remain unvaccinated ignorance, many deserve compassion. weeks reopen change problem mentioned.

The sensible waiting period delay would date UK government already accepts significant: August 16. (Where changing rules self-isolation fully vaccinated people)

This basically date everybody England booked first dose quickly eligibility opened adults, able get second dose 8 week delay.

Currently we're weird limbo state young population (who tend social contacts spread disease easily) still unable get second doses. we've told single dose particularly effective reducing spread Delta variant. got big chunk population unable effectively get vaccine protection, yet told go forth mingle everything open.  strange place. Pro vaccine (I think?) incredibly paranoid *about* vaccine hypochondriac every symptom. say ‚Äúbanned vaccine requirements schools‚Äù, wtf!? I‚Äôm betting lot parents even kept kids‚Äô vaccinations.  covid vax requirements banned, gonna let whooping cough measles comeback too? get man, sucks. 
And sorry harsh words earlier.
Very much like tired meeting friends still mask.
I tired watching politicians either trying juggle medical economic aspect virus fail ends politicize conspiracy theory laden cult.
I sick going city listen idiots going get vaccinated, government able track whatever.

But came far holding course longer, part reduce casualties time keep this.
Even hard, remember every unneccessary case new variant waiting happen even can't make everybody understand that, least keep hands clean that. Hospitalizations might rise slower, point rising considering unlikely number new infections go time soon, increase more. beginning June still less 1000 Covid patients hospital. number close 4000. might reach 40,000 like peak last wave, might reach 10,000 already bad enough. Yeah shame people deserve care going screwed chose protect themselves.  Also high case numbers means mutation, regardless hospitalization/death rate. It‚Äôs kinda scary...I kidney issue fertility problem. doctor said could hard body respects...I took first dose little fever extreme fatigue...hopefully second dose won‚Äôt bad.

I'd get PCR confirm though rapid tests high false negative rate. Mask vaccinated. vaccinated new variant shows up, mask data comes out. Unmask stated vaccination effective new variant. 

Just listen scientists basically. 1. county 60% full vaccination rate yet go store see maybe 15% masked. infection rates going up, largely among unvaccinated people, think reasonable assume many masking up. Yes, based actual evidence best continue cautious mind wearing mask hours week helpful thing.
2. try make white knight. worked retail condition kept vaccinated, would appreciate someone approaches wearing mask imagine would too. 

I'm telling wear mask vaccinated. asked question gave rationale. added happening people getting vaccinated.

This keep telling anxious people. course cause concern, ok concerned. 

But, think way. hear breakthrough cases. never hear millions times per day vaccines prevent people getting sick (because never occurs) prevent people needing hospitalization. Israel, alarm started raised, large percentage hospitalized people vaccinated. However, entire country, 26 people hospital. 

The point drastically reduce number people hospitalized, people draw short straw still contain vaccinated people. guys hate one. Good old trolley messenger transmits piece message leaves context (i.e. concluding vaccines effective vs using piece said make seem like they're not) certainly shoot messenger. Mayor Jaws met match. data gave clearly shows slight rise rolling average, want accept that, that's problem, mine.

[The BBC also touch deaths rising here, never said anything 1000 deaths deaths sky rocketing, putting words mouth.

I simply asked people dying were. That's it. came along straw man denying data I'm providing.

Now take straw man tin foil hat leave alone.  saw week last CDC clearly stated students staff vaccinated need masks. know they've updated changed 100% read.

ETA: seem misunderstood me. know said unvaccinated individuals need continue wearing masks. proof vaccination required exactly think properly enforced?  Saw live once, still regret day :D people come nonsense? 

seriously fact England vaccinations heavily skewed older people. disease burden exponentially higher age increases. even 95% reduction severe disease/death reduces persons chances level 20-30 year younger person. basically unvaccinated 20 year old STILL less chance death vaxxed 85 year old infected. Would've nice advocated benefits vaccines U12 age group EUA still hanging balance. Anything tamp misinformed notion ""covid doesnt really affect kids"". they've already taken huge financial hit 1 year delay.

Wendover productions video Nebula it.   there, erroding data protection laws. (Which almost exist USA thats different story)

I sure HIPPA also covers vaccination records. would likely fall data classified ‚Äúprovision care‚Äù - means ok share hospital/doctor (in combination PII data would allow identify patient). 

This stop patient disclosing WANTS get walmart whatever. Walmart would hard time ""validating it"" since cant ask anyone verify. know :-)  gotta stop testing asymptomatic fully vaccinated people. positive result people indication infection.  Vaccines 100% effective. literally every single person UK vaccinated, headline would ""100% people admitted UK hospitals two COVID jabs"" even amounted 5 people entire country. 

Percentages great way skew data fit narrative - media clickbait headlines bring ad revenue. That‚Äôs fine. don‚Äôt think care getting sympathy. care maximizing performance.  Username checks  Already see people calling need wiped out. Liberals ever gather masses like this!

This classic response likes /r/Coronavirus. people would problem killing people Covid protect themselves. ultimately I'll feel much better kiddos vaccinated. realize vaccine protection severe disease ultimately matters. However Isreal data remain pessimistic another mutation away substantial decrease vaccine efficacy regard. try read stats kids realize fears irrational... see articles New Orleans saying they're seeing large uptick sick kids. missing critical piece here: age groups, since vaccination uniform across them. Agree. Uk also testing also genomic testing relatively big population country. Many never used masks.

This stupid. Good Unknown? Bruh literally look right you‚Äôll see it, small country surging cases done same. Serious question: Today, possible people decide get fully vaccinated subconsciously secretly want others around die? changes everything true. mention ""would""?

Ferguson models epidemics - ""worst case scenario"". often siezed upon press sensational number. Going baseline vaccine almost certainly keep vaccinated individual hospital 60% admitted hospital fully vaccinated pretty fucking apocalyptic. 

Let‚Äôs hope data and/or headline inaccurate. basically Delta spiking unvaxxed segment, there's worry could follow Israel see much higher % breakthrough cases. Israel nearly 40% covid patients hospitalized fully vaccinated. Virologists know strain susceptible breakthroughs, vaccine protection waning rolled shots several months US, vaxxed ppl particular health conditions put risk hospitalizations. tbh, point protect health &amp; safety. need aware case rate &amp; positivity campus/county/town around may endangered become asymptomatic carrier. 

If stay campus study/work even inadvertently test positive community spread limited. part-time job surrounding area, say waiting tables clerk, potentially exposing hundreds customers covid. young &amp; healthy, really becomes social/bioethical question may sicken (or kill) community, rather safety. that's purely conscious &amp; value system. No, won‚Äôt be. vast, vast majority 50s fully vaccinated, 50 (let alone 80) risk factor compared significantly unvaccinated 30s deaths older vaccinated outnumber everyone else.

However, still tiny fraction deaths would without vaccines. mention local sheriffs! number people vaccinated get sick family vaccinated cant risk getting Covid-19. gotta wait already debatable concerned parents young healthy children really be. Obviously everyone way kids. saying would still concerned kids getting world vaccination shown possibly 70-80% symptomatic Covid higher severe disease? agree. know School system children attend 80% staff vaccinated within close shortest possible time available could get 2nd shot. However, still simple fact kids 12 can't get vaccinated yet, resilient disease, completely immune it, still spread places easily.   Pretty good chance clears competition. Chris Paul got COVID fully vaccinated recently cleared couple days.  CDC guidance *not test vaccinated people* unless severe COVID. yeah, numbers match *by design*.  think best bet would J&amp;J, he's hospitalized ""more three months"" account bit time infection hospitalization probably caught virus early mid April, Georgia opened vaccines 16+ March 25. Even able get vaccine day came available general population, give ton time get mRNA vaccines (although presumably even first would helped), even got one first day available. That's accurate, since many states longer report weekends. always go Tuesday numbers. That's state health agencies catch weekend reporting lags. blood-brain barrier mice (which theorize might explain cognitive issues Covid).

Now clear, vaccine (through different mechanisms MRNA DNA depending vaccine) tells body create spike protein, immune system recognizes something foreign attack antibodies formed result.

There's evidence enough spike proteins created process cause damage, though suspect researchers looking confirm. certainly would explain vaccines higher dosages (like Moderna) seem adverse reactions similar vaccination effectiveness. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

What percentage new cases vaccinated?
David Wiltshire asks many people testing positive vaccinated.

Sir Patrick Vallance says 60% admitted hospital fully vaccinated stresses ""not surprising"" people vaccinated.

Vallance goes say vaccines effective stopping severe disease - help prevent get first place, main aim. Several recent large case-control studies based registry demonstrate long covid pretty much non-existent among mild moderate symptoms. Small studies self-selected samples, control groups self-reported symptoms worthless. Protect Queen!

We could phrase ""if hospitalized COVID, probability previously vaccinated 60%.""

What tell us probability hospitalized COVID vaccinated. 

From title alone, maybe 5 people hospitalized 3 vaccinated. maybe ten million hospitalized six million vaccinated. way tell without information.

I think headlines like ""backward conditional probabilities"" seem first tell want know, actually tell all. Yes, one forced go clubbing, get vaccine. According Google, 54% England fully vaccinated. 54% people accounting 60% hospitalizations they're vaccinated ones?

What's going here? group vaccinated older people people yet Covid? Still seems odd. understanding IOC really puts countries rock hard place... essentially even considered put bid, need willing sign contract. true considering people got vaccine first vulnerable.

Those people almost likely hospitalised perhaps survive result vaccine.

It seems vaccines slowly getting there, Australia donated million, USA donated 2 million, lots needed. saw Pfizer plans deliver 47million doses Q4 year. long time away COVID terms. last year indicator covid peak December/January. 


But started really taking october/september. 


Fully vaccinated guests much worry about, anyone unvaccinated risk also risk others, even vaccinated. Actually incorrect - Vallance sent tweet stating 60% hospital admissions refers unvaccinated together, people together *have gotten vaccinated*, whether high risk. selfish people unvaccinated, punish vaccinated people giving fuck seems twisted. don‚Äôt know considering positive PCR games. Ha, like it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like hunger games. rich countries afford best stuff still end blowing it. May odds ever favor lol. recognizing obvious risk factors downplaying COVID? said I‚Äôm downplaying COVID‚Ä¶you‚Äôre reading want comment despite that. 95%+ studies I‚Äôve seen US filtered purified air. 

Drones deliver food. real. like people assume 16 year old doesn‚Äôt medical insurance.  Link (indoor) concert That‚Äôs pretty much well. Thanks trying chip away often one-sided threads, you‚Äôre good work. They‚Äôve opened vaccines everyone 18 past month so, we‚Äôll probably totally point couple months reckon  Well one thing, people Japan opportunity vaccinated. kids 12 opportunity yet either. also unvaccinated people spreading disease around causing variants threaten whole vaccination program.  nearly 2 years... certain point, people tolerate indefinite restrictions. vaccinated? think so, bet going seeing whole lot Long Covid cases future. LA like 3 months barely cases Covid deaths still incredibly low haven‚Äôt gone up? it‚Äôs significantly deadlier? knew would happen. vaccines never 100%, thing currently impossible modern medical technology. matters bad cases were, one anecdote guy eight day (so far) cough taste smell issues; basically cold. state terrible people try hide behind Nola culture football drives crazy Part nearly half UNvaccinated, doesn‚Äôt bring us close herd immunity. Also, totally anecdotally, lot breakthrough cases people know happening people work TV/ film. need get tested multiple times week work, lot cases found addition people getting tested they‚Äôre feeling sick whatever. test currently required air travellers, non-essential travellers aren‚Äôt able cross land borders (air seems easier). opening August, 72-hour test entry Canadian side US travellers (lifts everyone else September).

 land border closure hasn‚Äôt extended ended yet. extend far time, they‚Äôve announcing extension pretty close expiration date far. wait see.  Yeah overweight person. know tall guy 5'11 he's least 240. weigh quite bit less BMI considered overweight. HIPAA, hippa like hippopotamus. Oh no, definitely practices routines keep conditioning. Even teams isolate leaving Olympics, like Team GB, facilities train in.

All gymnasts sendoff parties gyms they're based in. remotely, i.e. guest honor, Olympic-bound gymnast herself, attended video. Kara Leanne, hand, [right looks like giant party.

The gymnasts probably also farewell get togethers families. lol Maintain common sense precautions (masks, social distancing, unnecessary trips), least people fully vaccinated.

25% enough, Finland we're %, got second shot today, advised keep precautions. Ahahaha. church now?  point make comments knowing get voted. place pretty predictable. COVID one holding cardboard sign. Well, whatever fatality rate would then, I'd like articles regarding would happen COVID-19 killed \[insert mortality rate percentage\] population. Uh, World Cup winter (as stupid sounds). indoor mask mandate anyone 2 up. add capacity restrictions, etc. fair, 12-18 month comments vaccine related fully approved. Two things really impacted that. First success MRNA platforms (genome sequence published like 1/4 vaccine ready like March 4 something crazy), second assumption would enforce NPI's lower spread trials would take longer. Turns human stupidity helped way. I‚Äôm curious due pandemic due massive increase internet social media usage pandemic. I‚Äôd like see comparison mental health suicides pandemic compared previous ones I‚Äôm sure information lacking history. phrase directly essentially says, ""but please follow local business rules"".   keep mind, frantic Reddit posting w‚ò∫Ô∏èay reflects reality ‚ò∫Ô∏è going bars? sub going serious cognitive dissonance article Well, whatever fatality rate would then, I'd like articles regarding would happen COVID-19 killed \[insert mortality rate percentage\] population. 1-2% harder-hit areas Lombardy region (median age 42) died, mostly without hospital care, last spring. 0.5% Amazonas (median age 26) died two waves, second severe Gamma. Delta believed even virulent, could 1% baseline IFR wealthy countries even hospital care - idea many India (median age also 26) caught died spring. surges ended severe NPI's, unchecked case decline, quite worst case. way worst case close 10% - though within credible range started getting good numbers Lombardy, late last spring. 

It's hard judge worst case vaccinations Delia's increased severity. definitely 1% though. 

But central issue letting covid go unchecked always hospital care so. UK letting go unchecked (they think handle surge) LA isn't. course, chose September good nation's health, people actually attending events fully vaccinated then

/s two weeks, right? lmao u people Yes. focus discussion shifted efficacy infection US we're acting vaccines prevent infection rate prevent disease. That's dangerous don't. vaccines probably good preventing transmission, good enough current openness masklessness. Yes people don‚Äôt live inside volcanos they? Canada basically choice AZ, Pfizer Moderna, allow certain amount mixing. I‚Äôm Europe moved South Korea earlier year.
Everyone ages wear KF94 masks children young age wear masks correctly. They‚Äôve even printed masks cartoons etc. It‚Äôs issue yet read news West it‚Äôs America it‚Äôs feel it‚Äôs simply mask. It‚Äôs bit uncomfortable summer heat it‚Äôs literally covering half faces scientific evidence shows rational people know virus enters nose.
It really protect us wear mask correctly.
Literally every store go sells KF94 individually boxes.
They‚Äôre reasonably priced shape designed really comfortable.
South Korea makes masks. 
It saddens anti mask movement still going strong. headlines cherry picking couple random places 

As today, Missouri less half winter peak hospitalizations longer 'staff'.  Covid even get close killing 10% World's population. 

Look India example. Remember streets flooded dying covid victims hospitals overflowing patients? basically covid worse country far. High estimates total Covid fatalities India around 2-3 million deaths. would take 13 million covid casualties India ""just"" get 1% total population India. Someone compile list sponsors games.

Publish online. Make accountable deaths happen. always Redditor knows fatal encounter disease 99% survival rate agree main focus preventing hospitalizations/deaths one main advantages mRNA vaccines also effectively reduced spread justified hurdles cold chain. sure 80-90% efficacy - Israel report Pfizer's efficacy around 60% Delta? frustrated got covid, isolate or? say take precautions?

No not

Lockdowns shutting travel vaccinated people however unacceptable

We locked protect healthcare systems, places like Uk Canada, overwhelming healthcare going incredibly difficult thanks vaccinated individuals.

You want restrictions? fully support non-vaccinated choice individuals locked houses, hey, that‚Äôs probably bit much. Efficacy mete infections important long three unvaxinated populations vaccinated people spread to: 

- kids eligible

- Immunocompromised got vaccine little effective protection may effectively unvaxed

- Idiots declined

Also yet know much ""long covid"" vaccinated. Correcto! real. ""tried"" ""did could"". keep thing check before, still cannot widely available vaccine, that. Continue mask want not. mandates distancing coming back.  link judging efficacy preventing severe disease. infection immunity. Lol

That perfect response, wrong kind post. 40% vaccinated might sound scary, actually considering extremely high uptake risk groups, means efficacy hospitalization 90-100% range. think people follow sub probably fully vaccinated. longer concerned dying virus, since they're fully vaccinated, they're turning attention next salient risk long covid (since murmurings fully vaccinated people still getting infected getting long covid, although idea great risk is). Presumably Swiss court/law, given IOC based. reviewed contract anything. Right. Obviously everyone agree (as abundantly clear votes submission comments) supposed downvote things agree with, supposed downvote information that's misleading incorrect

I able identify part op-ed misleading incorrect, leading believe there's strong emotional reaction going (ironically kind reaction proving point author's suppositions) around 85% people level vaccine protection. means even single vaccinated people included AZ bit weak, program working around 50% level.

If 100% people vaccinated, 100% hospitalized would vaccinated. means 19 million arent vaccinated California. Thats lot warm bodies virus spread into. want feel sympathy cannot get it. Oh, definitely conspiracy theories polio vaccine, fact probably one first instances anti vaxx propaganda, thankfully slow spread information coupled higher mortality kept like today's conspiracies absolutely parents‚Äô right keep child home necessary. longer shaping policy around them. People suck probabilities. figure 100% chance get vaccine, get vaccine. get vaccine, less 100% chance get COVID.

And get vaccine bad reaction, themselves. get COVID, well, unfortunate life unfair!

But data UK‚Äôs Office National Statistics suggest 10-13% kids test positive covid symptoms five weeks. 7-8% symptoms beyond 12 weeks. matches Australian study, examined 151 young children covid found 8% still reported symptoms three six months infection. kids since recovered.

One non-peer reviewed study tracked symptoms among 1,700 school-age children UK tested positive SARS-CoV-2. those, 4.4% symptoms lasted month. 1.8% symptoms persisted longer two months. exchange here: . took literally 3 min find. clear indication long covid happening vaccinated people either.

If 20-30% vaccinated people (30 vaccinated 6+ months ago) getting mostly mild cases, long covid still happens, would bad

There's reason believe would less, unclear far worry covid fix stupid removing see. 100% familiar new mandate. blanket everyone including age 2 2 &amp; up? Even latter, must rough going back masking especially already adjusted post-vax life (I Philly &amp; fully vaxed since early July yet changed mask/distance/WFH routine began 18 March 2020). England's covid vaccination uptake highest age groups pretty high (over 95% 75-89 year olds 90% 60-75 year olds) imagine point there's many high-risk unvaccinated folks left hospitalizations largely high-risk vaccinated folks younger lower-risk folks drew short straw. racism come step dads mum flidamite baby (please excuse spelling) born 1 arm

History governments dont help.. think people trust scientists virologist dedicated life studing vaccines. Scientifically much better position understanding polio really unimaginative. Yes think cross people anti vax less hygienic / careful. Much bigger doses Pfizer, necessary high efficacy original variant. However larger doses result higher efficacy single dose likely higher efficacy variants. fucking CRAZY. get it. Literally nothing else wearing mask, people arms ready skin health officials alive. Can't imagine it'd waited long enough imposing stricter restrictions rather trying masks first. one thing, help timing since wait vaccine effective. want get vaccinated right competing anyway.

But also, Japan basically US March roll out. still lot doctors elderly vaccinate would unfair give doses foreign Generally agree note J&amp;J never 90%+ efficacy preventing infections - 66% efficacy symptomatic COVID. haha worries, one Nothing resembling 10% population would die, especially billions people vaccinated.  disagreeing, perspective.

Moderna provide real world protection? recall long ago, young man age thinks immortal. 40 old. Anecdote, coworker said walk across home without stopping catch breath. There's really obvious reason believe covid would kill 10% population; fatality rate considerably that. Santa Clara County, bay area, California Lol going EXACTLY thought would go. Personally I'm rooting China's vaccination campaign succeed, I've accepted entire world copied lockdowns 2020, pandemic never really end China reopens borders signals world OK. They're probably hurry since government probably benefits emphasizing domestic spending domestic travel. hopefully someday.

I also contrarianly suspect Chinese vaccines bad reputation (they seem not-great blocking infection decent preventing severe disease), though believe case numbers low report, government made propaganda victory suppress COVID almost one else can. enough open accept certain amount cases deaths; really vaccinate way herd immunity -- official propaganda talks herd immunity lot -- might take years several different vaccine updates. Fully vaccinated obtained COVID travel. 1.5 year long planned vacation turned mandatory isolation gf even though symptoms lasted day felt fine ever since. venting frustration :(  Wanted make sure people saw correct headline since incorrect one got traction retracted. 60% hospitalizations among **unvaccinated**.

Their infection concern unvaccinated older people however

I can‚Äôt find stat now, saying full vaccinated 70 year old still greater risk death unvaccinated 35 year old.

Both however extremely low. know, I...shit, ""vax hesitant"" people here? 

If so, condolences vented way. 14 days long end possible incubation periods, average incubation significantly shorter. people like civic duty got vaccinated heavy lifting idiots cowards choosing get shot? Really depends cases trend, they‚Äôre low state rate increase could see NYC week two unless levels Yeah, I've thinking this. first thought political pressure, pressure open Memorial Day, realized new administration, pledged take COVID seriously, complete new members CDC, doubted it.

If really anti-scientific motive behind decision, would make CDC Biden look really bad. option would make sense would science says. assumed behavioral aspects factored decision-making process. bet CDC gonna walk back soon.

Inland Southern California, Pro-Vax coastal counterparts definitely worst. county definitely exceeded expectations    lot idiots protesting vaccine protests mostly sparked announcement need Covid pass access restaurants, trains, etc. need proof vaccination measles go restaurant. Alas, Pasco County, Florida. seen uptick cases recently, little Urgent Care besieged positive cases, worried mothers, husbands, wives, grandparents (not many those, thanks good vaccination numbers elderly). county 49% fully vaccinated. others, I'm afraid 250,000 unvaccinated individuals. 

In Pasco mask wearing 10%. Depends shop. Gas stations convenience stores: .05%, upscale grocery stores: 5-10%. Ask person street pandemic over? Chances are, answer be: ""Yeah. Pretty much. Nobody wears masks, sooooo ... guess, yeah. ""

It's sad situation here, going become sadder. Source Israel? think I've read otherwise.

If want expect best compliance possible, way it.

I'm surprised behavioralists CDC something. definitely telling people get shot lifetime may shorter realize.  crazy thing I‚Äôve seen similar sentiment across sub voted moon. ‚ÄúVaccines *prevent* hospitalization death‚Äù = old normal UK government stupid. gonna end badly 2-3 weeks sure. we've seen movie 15 months. That's mother's fault getting vaccinated, really strong argument.

Even 95% effective rate hospitalization, still 0.95 vaccinated 1 unvaccinated, far 60% number.  Let antivaxxers die streets Hey heads phrase actually ""chock full"" CDC put place mandates, state governments did. CDC said evidence people vaccine low risk spreading getting corona even without masks. governments reacted accordingly. mad anyone mad state, CDC stating scientific truth taught elementary school last school year. Kids person. trouble getting properly wear masks. started world trust issues, got ""better"" come full circle. many people seem incredibly selfish evil. people want put protecting defenseless little kids first? info I‚Äôve come across, although official medical test confirm it, symptoms similar associated Delta variant. Even so, know sure, assume sore throat cough attributed sources infection. meantime, think positively. Stress weaken immune system mess mind. hope recover quickly. long total numbers continue stay small, good shape. Remember numbers almost nothing Israel Delta took over. would expect cases contagious variant, we‚Äôre seeing now. total numbers remain pretty low expect us hit ceiling certain point virus works population antibodies runs pretty big wall vaccinated people infection rate drop precipitously. corrected - Correcting statistic gave press conference today, 19 July. 60% hospitalisations covid double vaccinated people, rather 60% hospitalisations covid currently unvaccinated people. know even careful states like NJ getting rid fully online option. People banned stuff every single day, what's point? know, would think data would provide statistically accurate view what's going. able see now, government conference afternoon. False, he‚Äôs tweeted made mistake - it‚Äôs 60% unvaccinated Every crowd you‚Äôre rest life mix vaccinated unvaccinated people. That‚Äôs reality situation 60% causalities come group, armor's working well.

To continue analogy, 60% like first line attack, given swords whatever. Without controlling comorbidities, raw percentage pain accurate picture. Ask children wear masks? retracted Sir Patrick Vallance 10 minutes ago..

'Correcting statistic gave press conference today, 19 July. 60% hospitalisations covid double vaccinated people, rather 60% hospitalisations covid currently unvaccinated people.' I'm sceptical that's implying, I'm asking genuine question. even comment effective was. I'm purely asking case, knew missing something. Thanks. read Geneva convention true, thanks. I'm sure exact definition think need hospital, tested positive covid. UK 67% vaccination rate track worse January vaccination rate keep making new excuses vaccine needed get corona. literally makes feel ill.  Listen, got Olivia Rodrigo tell people get it. want? Indiana made illegal schools require COVID vaccinations, that's how. made law ‚Äúthe state local unit may issue require immunization passport.‚Äù vaccine passport totally different thing requiring vaccination. like vaccines job.

Because are. Given set data, *always* find interpretation reads disaster scenario. analyze way actually makes sense, like done here, see prior efficacy calculations still much reflective real-world situation.  virus magically respected that. make instrument bell covers. think schools use covers, practice outside much weather allows, best provide arts opportunities staying safe. think purely many vaccinated. 70s fully double jabbed (based last population count) expected small percentage come hospital. 70 there's less double jabbed also less risk, overall 60% might seem high, number way lower anyway.

US avoiding testing vaccinated people though, skews numbers opposite direction, mention pretty substantial proportion infections US still alpha vaccine effective, high use Moderna compared countries likely also provides better real world variant protection.

Bingo. think Oklahoma state really sound alarm number breakthrough infections. Eh, something telling us give context this.

Test negative US 72 hours crossing ArriveCAN app?

What cost PCR testing required 72h travel? free pay travel essential? 

And need tested coming back US? 99% hospitalisations unvaccinated still high look efficacy data elsewhere. Canada UK data put reduction hospitalisation two doses BioNTech Moderna 95-96%, US would give 93% hospitalisations unvaccinated that's somewhat generous given America's relative obesity situation. 

It's possible hospitalisations would drop 85% compared seen vaccines elsewhere without major confounding variables. Also, it‚Äôs impossible know isn‚Äôt vaccinated.

Most teens stood first question also stand second question. far I'm aware things like pollen really blocked higher quality N/KN95 masks cloth masks electrostatic (not charcoal) filter.

That maybe put mask heading out? ¬øImagine propagandizing need polio vaccine? It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs really dangerous. Btw think kids smart.  joking moron part. No!? Yes!! Ohhhh! always focused trying match US.

We're not, we're focused better.

And one reasons US smugness supply issues.  two default news subs part Covid disinformation nexus public health authorities blame increasing death toll. mod support people dissenting views banned. Everyone see blitz anti-vax upvotes even thread 100 people went hospital 60 tested positive Covid-19. 

Which also means 40% people visiting UK hospital, fully vaccinated, tested negative Covid-19. KF94s made kids good as-worn filtering efficiency. aerosol scientist measured let known paper masks trapping CO2 instead isolating? imagine people teams jobs go sponsor work pays bills, maybe much gymnasts. huge waste fun stuff instead. 

I would also imagine routine practice working risk already. downvoted? higher risk used ton nicotine products lungs already gunked up. guys really care logic points towards outcome personally want. Maple syrup hockey road trip! bunch so-called fully vaccinated people said even go back wearing masks accordance LA mandate they've already made sacrifices

And anyone begs differ immediately accused anti vaxer. propaganda/bridgading real. Well, postponed since supposed year ago. guess want postpone another yet they'd run winter. dumb though held country vaccine readily available (if facility it). care?

Is weird people problem wearing masks? Kids enough airflow clear C02, eh? Citation needed. Israel ""outlier"" what's causing it? felt little sick. Yeah remember early days places like Texas acting superior saying ""why lock suckers NYC? virus here, let us open right now"" strategy ever let things go hope nothing really bad happens. problem places get lucky seems work, assume brilliant planning continue thing actually blow face - India great example this. Forcing people get shot going go well. expecting happen? I‚Äôd super happy got another solid month similar numbers. think schools going back Delta pushing people towards vaccine MIGHT possible.  sure... ...Given spreads among vaccinated. unvaccinated going different story. Yeah, let‚Äôs real here, probably would happened lungs already fried. factual.  Tell me, care people spreading germs Swine Flu Zika? Sorry, allow fundraising links. thread day bunch so-called fully vaccinated people said even go back wearing masks accordance LA mandate they've already made sacrifices. massive propaganda campaign right trying convince people getting vaccinated need variant surges nothing worry about. next surge worse first, lots kids going perish. Unfortunately charter schools another left right divide, cyber charter something left like, pulls money local district (fuck republican ass district) He's dicknosin'. observed since beginning COVID though. alway case kids safest virus. reasonable expect change, data seems demonstrating that. think Canada clear 72 hour test crossing required, US said nothing.
Doesn't border closure end 7/21? hope release details soon! Sounds like you‚Äôre mentally ill.

Oh yeah, punishing people wanting vaccine absolutely convince get it. /s people unable take almost certainly close supervision specialist already, probably aren‚Äôt getting clinic anyways, even consulting kind medical expert screening kind questions.

I said attitude like much higher chance reinfection, reinfection may likely pleasant, people continue defend \`hoax\` shit problem continue get worse everyone, across globe. yeah. people reckless clueless.. covid far over. wear mask stay safe man. funny? bet story. overweight? Everyone know said like mild flu/cold. awaiting hate soon come. seen reports *much* less effective vs delta original variants tested against. data outside Israel far seems indicate they're slightly less roughly equivalent originally estimated efficacy.

Israel seems bet vaccine resistant mutations, would mRNA ones, since specifically designed attack spike protein. part virus mutates much, may even hurt us. like afraid. I'm essential worker, I've go work throughout lockdowns. age, got first jab end last month. I'll get enjoy go back work whilst everyone else decides stop wearing masks now.

 said 84 vaccinated individuals required hospitalization (99.998% effective), 31 passed away (99.9993% effective). We‚Äôll see that. kind doubt it. taken number back FYI. flipped. vaccination rates reach 100%, 100% covid cases vaccinated. 

The UK vaccination rates 90% would mean 10% population responsible 60% cases. natural immunity much less compared vaccine immunity comes delta, 1% infections Israel reinfection cases compared 50% New infections fully vaccinated persons.

Not care either way indoor masks come back PA not, things well control here. near 0 percent chance happening here. CDC knew good they'd go back mandating masks indoors. 

They're already making people angry middle-of-the-road, what's matter safe? Yes, Nature article balanced, showing studies show 9.8% vs 1% - think main takeaway studies necessary get certainty either way. I'm saying useless, might actually potential. can't conclude either way  original commenter saying care no-vax people die covid. wondered people feel fat people smokers, directly eating smoking death (not even gamble, outcome obvious). find telling much curiosity upset people (looking downvotes responses got). fat people smokers protected species. üßê think vax / no-vax groups confused vax works. meant lessen symptoms person gets it; prophylactic. read Edward Bernays cite sources post.

If excess caution helps us sliding backward, I‚Äôd rather find dumb cautious left permanent lung damage rushing normal. 

Different areas using different approaches, you‚Äôre cycle lockdowns definitely get frustration.

!remindme 4 months

Whether people agree waiting, narrative shift would still happen. People following rules almost 18 months states. Asking wait another 6+ months ridiculous they've vaccinated 1) data supports theory children high risk 2) vaccinated people significantly lower-risk population.

I'm sorry small portion children seriously injured Covid, putting 330 million Americans bucket 2 years answer. like one kid class acts up, whole class punished. It‚Äôs misinformation killing people. It‚Äôs covid lab leak theory proven correct facebook implicit blocking fact checking every post beginning pandemic mis disinformation. ready decry lab leak theory false information. told came theory, FB fire?    tried post German numbers sub, somehow post vanished. I'll add numbers here, case anyone needs context/detail figures given.

----------

Over 55% adults Germany received shots vaccine, additional 16.6% first shot.

- people 60 double-vaxxed 73.7%, another 10.5% received first shot.

- people 18-59 years age, 43.7% double-vaxxed, 15.4% received first shot.

As reminder, RKI estimates order avoid Delta wave, 90% people 60 need fully vaxxed, well 85% aged 18-59. studies suggest even higher numbers may required.

-----------

As slowdown:

In week ending today (July 18th), Germany given 4 million jabs (1st well 2nd doses); week that, 4.3 million; week 5 million; week 5.6 million.

49.6 million people Germany received least one shot vaccine (as July 16th); since conservative estimates say 52.7 million adult, eligible people willing vaccinated point, slowdown almost inevitable.

Summer holidays, etc., also possible additional causes slowdown.

------------

Rising case numbers:

Incidence numbers Germany much lower many European countries, rising fast. lowest point two three weeks ago around 5 new cases (rolling 7-day-average) 100.000 people. around 10. government speaking 50 55 % rise week-to-week.

Journalists broken numbers bit more, say past two weeks case numbers actually rather stable within age-groups, 20-29-year age group number rising significantly.

In (even narrow) age-band 20-24, incidence-rate rose 10 19 (per 100.000 people), whereas age-group 75-84, stayed continuously 1.

*[note: people assume that, Delta different sypmtoms, might hit double-vaxxed people hard, many elderly people might assume bad cold get tested, think unlikely/impossible virus due fact fully vaccinated]*  don‚Äôt feel anything lose catching Covid, needs change.

Wether anything lose issue,others years lives people could lose (and lost). saying concern worth thought.  get it, like slightly inconvenient get gun. Thanks weighing humanitarian Remember getting covid twice impossible?  gone quarantine... What‚Äôs statement. Stay let people get insular risk shrinks shrinks? You‚Äôre PM - remove restrictions? Things objectively worse usually impact variable make things worse variables important. Someone could easily objectively *better*. Killing someone 70 years *experience* instead 5 loss.

Because might value experience potential. took quick road trip Ohio PNW. got Seattle, almost ONE wearing mask. Things going get bad areas high vax rates. Children probably vaccinated November. looking January children want vaccine get it.   media, really means Facebook. Florida, wife‚Äôs employer doesn‚Äôt think ask people provide proof vaccination, allowing people take masks questions asked. supposed wear mask unvaccinated, turns out, can‚Äôt force someone prove status often lie want. 

My wife fully vaccinated still wears good self protective mask around coworkers. you‚Äôve paying attention, people failing act responsibility societal level, societal levels death, year half now. want whatever want, whenever want, go live shack woods. want hospitals schools roads water won‚Äôt make shit death, rules follow return. Research repeatedly shown vaccines significantly reduce chances contacting spreading virus. Even contract it, viral load also significantly reduced. really much reason vaccinated people wear masks, social distance, etc, outside specific circumstances.

As counter saying, focus maintaining masking restrictions may actually negative incentive unvaccinated. I.e. ""why go side effects unknowns life going change"". reality, vaccine readily available anyone 12+ wants US, way we'll significantly move needle 1) approval children 2) vaccine mandates work school. agree vaxxed. done part. Thank you! time others vaxx also. way out. longer responsibility. I'm saying vaxxed person decides still mask etc., still helping even longer obligated to. blame though being""done it"" going back normal yourself. issues deal with.

You suggesting vaccinated individuals wear mask due immunocompromised people. long suggest happens? Stay home, mask up, social distance, see anyone. That's choice. parents vaccinated.

It‚Äôs unknown. know exactly consequences be.  capacity ability judge who's awful person who's not. get vaccine, contributing keeping COVID era going. live Canada, everyone know vaccinated, anyone social pariah. Way ruin life scared little needle. Interesting. Cancer diagnosis treatment non urgent. Life saving surgeries, non-urgent. Florida Fifth? kidding right? Compare Israel Indonesia say straight face. We've already one ""UK"" variant. says another? barely political that's even emphasis post, relevant. No, they‚Äôll move areas medicine. Concierge services rich growing market, example. think missed point. comenting amount overly peotic hyerpoble sub. original comment prime example.  long transmit immunocompromised individuals ""indefinitely"" Kids beginning die also, know kids massive carriers get families sick. may develop antibodies killing parents. don‚Äôt think anyone talking arresting old ladies sharing ‚Äúnatural new‚Äù whatever is. 

But main distributors extremely dangerous falsehoods (who I‚Äôd bet money trail behind paying so)? Yeah prosecute 100% I'm tired media blamed everything wrong today. humans choose watch believe everything see TV Facebook shoulder blame this?!?! question immunity.

The vaccine trains immune systems attach/attack covid spike protein.

If somebody catches covid naturally could immune system learn attack aspect covid instead?

And would getting vaccine leave sort ""double protection "" virus?  UK gonna cull people then. OK. really need 80% vaccinated get R Delta 1 want back normal

If Israeli data correct Pfizer vaccine 64% effective preventing infection Delta.... can't get 80% protection vaccines alone even 100% population vaccinated. real-world numbers fuzzy. time you‚Äôre trying study large human population without control group, you‚Äôre going get lot ‚ÄúBetween 50% 90%, fuck it, idea get specific.‚Äù couple billion people lot keep track of. obvious biggest confounding factor people vaccinated get sniffles get tested, leading disproportionately high rates severe cases percentage total.

I've thinking exact problem long time, thus name. boat. wear damn thing 10+ hours day 5 days week. don‚Äôt even know mine anymore don‚Äôt plan searching it. quality life improved immensely face covered.  Damn, that's sad. Especially preventable. Fuck people. agree Olympics go forward, realistically, strongest healthiest humans population least likely die. generally young healthy unlike locals, many vaccinated. 

Also, illness death avoidable tragedy individual loved ones, Olympians pretty small percentage overall population going much effect additional waves covid developing countries can't afford vaccinations. 

Definitely avoidable unnecessary, think likely lead many athlete deaths. used hold summer winter Olympics year early 1990s. could done again.  There's drastically reduced flu circulation pandemic. know that's predicted make easier harder predict strains vaccinate against? Could conceivably see greater normal uptake flu vaccines, since pandemic experience strong reminder benefits getting vaccinated? get yours? walk clinic get appointment sent through? registered last week heard anything yet I'm super keen get done.   higher load replicated quickly. 

That make contagious lethal. viral load patients infected Delta variant 1,000 times high. average, took four days viral titers patients replicate detectable levels‚Äîa full 48 hours sooner last year‚Äôs strain. wear mask indefinitely them? It‚Äôs tragic everyone get vaccine masking forever isn‚Äôt table vaccinated.  mother podiatrist (extremely pro-science, pro-vaccine etc) would grateful read comment, used Reddit. thank you! live Isle Man, recently opened borders, course cases exploded. However, full 75% population double vaxxed.

What notable is:

* 75% infections people aged 15-25. 20-24 age group, infection rate *fifteen times higher* 45-49 age group. Many 20-24s 1 dose, nearly (90%+) 45-49s both.
* Almost 1000 active cases, 1 hospital case.
* 2/3rds active cases young men. good evidence sports ball tournament big superspreading event, everyone crammed pubs watch tv beer. (Note: pubs open pandemic unlike UK, closed borders).

I know two people symptomatic, one 25 year old step brother (only 1 vax) although cases mild still pretty miserable (loss taste, loss energy, generally feeling nasty - typical viral infection symptoms). I'm glad I'm football - Sunday night 5 people side bar (the room without TV) night!

At current rate infection, everyone either double vaccinated infected middle August. makes much sense, cannot imagine athletes work doctors pretty regularly would someone around encouraging get vaccine. Exactly way they‚Äôve tracking infections last year‚Ä¶

Someone tests positive 
1. unvaccinated - CDC counts
2. vaccinated - CDC count (unless hospitalized)

Same process without throwing data away study defines 30 days post diagnosis date, date infected. fire crowded theater level stupid count? viruses typically become less deadly become contagious, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs 100% guarantee means. 

Delta example vaccine vs risk long haul covid. people understand. Thank don‚Äôt to. doses sitting shelves end pandemic country second. WTF??? tragedy it‚Äôs preventable ?
Or plain stupidity ? hospitalizations rising proportionately increase infection rates? I'm lazy math imagine hospitalizations rising much slowly infections, thanks vaccine. true beginning top priority preventing deaths keeping hospitals overwhelmed. People necessarily forgetting that, thinking strategy set stone, revised face new circumstances information. Since start pandemic, level concern long term effects non-severe infections (Long Covid) risen significantly.

Also, preventing hospitals overwhelmed always top priority, officials managing pandemic response explicitly said literally *only* priority matters, opposed *highest* priority? Absolutely. Frustrating is, haha. I'll hold bottom line numbers ""they work total"", robust. 

I'm fortunate role I'm asked give specific commentary. This. whole nation sending kids back fall, largely without masks. way uncivil? would assume *every* athlete US vaccinated, though there's probably support staff isn't. athletes field *must* regularly trust work doctors, taking vaccine could cost athletes one chances compete level. saw studies anti vax people spreading argueing ""the protection infection higher one vaccines"".

Now using arguement vaccines obviously bs, like need protection encounters potentially harms even kills you. obviously, body produces better anti bodies knowing whole virus rather spikes.

But point, think - survived covid once, enough protection worst happen, booster shot give big plus. people argue people might dealt easier Corona contracting corona-viruses before. end every body deals differently creates different amounts anti-bodies last differently. mutations like Delta, body needs anti bodies neutralize it. main issue.

Because way Corona spreads massively, multiplies massively. within short time, create 10 viruses 1000000000 something idk, immune system interfers 100 body notice like start neutralizing 10000. 

Now Imagine original corona would need 3 ab neutralize, delta 9 ab. Let's say 500 antibodies first dose corona got loaded body detected 100. 300 ab neutralize virus, reload case. imagine Delta got detected 100 would need 900 ab 500 ab first dose. might get infected, deal better none. That's need 2nd dose Delta, 1000 ab. idk high protection infection is, compared that, somewhere around range, maybe even better ab. Also vaccines, moderna slightly better BnT/Pfizer, probably bit higher dosed ab.

Now made numbers also simplify process really hard. one draw really much understanding handling like include ""almost Europe""? Demand still much higher supply pretty much Europe. Dear God, POS parents true. bad enough forbidding child get vaccinated--now imagine destroying Olympic dreams it. everloving fuck. Yeah, international human right clubbing... kids can't get vaccinated inside School recipe disaster IMO.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I'd swear want foreigners visiting UK. struggle find reason probably also balanced lower efficacy AZ

Incorrect. Analysis results vaccine deployment UK show widely used vaccines equally effective.  never said knew someone intubated. oxygen intubation. 
Also, I‚Äôve completely lost trust CDC data means nothing informed vaccinated person believes science I'm glad did. scared get vaccinated choose believe disinformation fear mongering rather take time research that's longer problem, feel free get infected take chances virus, I'm going live life. Yes! can‚Äôt even spell vaccinated. Pardon question ability come sound logical conclusion. Money talks Reddit hosts plenty anti vax pro covid communities.  I‚Äôm opinion framework laws doesn‚Äôt allow regulation.

We way change that, changing requires people agree ‚Äî we‚Äôre there. Let‚Äôs get universal never discussion didn‚Äôt specifically say don‚Äôt think, I‚Äôd assume are.

""If go shopping, terrorists win!"" People r/Olympics identified Kara Eaker, said vaccinated. knows.

Already worldwide shortage proper respiratory facemasks. Joe public ain't wearing Ya that's thing though, conservatives encapsulated many many many races. could argued conservatives world movement.

Sure, conservatives liberal outlook public eye maybe fiscally Conservative. Weren‚Äôt Netherlands position UK? see saying people vaxxed.  miss that. Money would lost can't that! think full blown lockdowns come back anywhere. cost/benefit really make sense virtually vulnerable Americans capability vaccinated. Additionally, would imagine public support things like shifting back virtual/hybrid schooling would extraordinarily low point. 

That said, surprised see major cities follow LA's footsteps temporarily bring back indoor masking head fall. personally agree sort decision, least intrusive means slow spread large metros COVID-concious parts country. agree too, many thing wrong companies choose monitor don't.... regulated least enact rules consistently across users.  I‚Äôve fully vaccinated since April life‚Äôs much pre covid. county hit immunity shows haven‚Äôt covid case store 3 months. don‚Äôt mask anymore anything sort.

The vaccines work people. work really freaking good too. localized vaccine mandate? vaccine effective mask anyways? mean athletes one anti-vaxx countries higher risk catching Covid, surprised pikachu face. 

And U.S. Olympic Committee required vaccines athletes boot. What's more, hospitalisations UK rising since third week May. like pursuing zero covid strategy prior today. recently looked old swine flu news pieces, everyone mother lined get shot. even people stealing vaccine supplies. happened within past decade? isn‚Äôt cruise ships it‚Äôs beating rest field field Trumps successor.

Delta changing game unfortunately goalposts moved it. It‚Äôs annoying. like masks, vaccines aren‚Äôt perfect delta proven slippery infect lot vaccinated people - 20% risk unvaccinated person.

The gamble isn‚Äôt wearing mask getting vaccinated - safe bets. gamble happen individual become infected - lose smell months, hospitalized, long term lung damage, fatigue‚Ä¶ nobody knows body react *some* risk factors even people without bad time. It‚Äôs roll dice. Maybe. maybe, don‚Äôt midst pandemic. feel people trained butts time stripped away. Ukraine entirely family disinformation real. Russian news especially tells essentially die 2 years taking vaccine. frustrating much worse disinformation campaign general american media charge guy make martyr people dig more. Fair point. 

But given nothing beyond vaccines, either accept things stay locked forever eschew social interactions. Waiting weeks reopen change problem mentioned. give people exit limbo we've last 1.5 years, stretch imagine resentment and/or unrest.  end game wear masks children get vaccinated. people want die business. prerogative. fact never stop wearing mask. life live feel comfortable.

The games even started yet.

Who right mind thought would good idea? 

Would universe implode delayed games 1 sense much protection infection older variant offered Delta? Pretty sure time medical stuff, ethical question, usually volunteer understand risks greater good ethical consideration. let us recap:
On thread, tangentially related ""point"" trying make, point view challenged people, including me.
You arguments, instead resort repeating opinion telling people ""fk off"".

I think characterization spot on, come prove wrong, use data reasoning like adult, dare you.
Also would say one disconnected reality here, much aware implications big delta surge, deaths, economic fallout lockdowns more.
What thinking about?
How face gets bit warm sweaty mask? Oh humanity. I‚Äôm starting come around viewpoint little.  Yo got lot older bosses hate. even say Ukraine except say ""the Ukraine government"" bot bullying me! going delay events due top competitors testing positive athletes luck? got go Tokyo take atmosphere (in allowed anything). relate, sister doesn‚Äôt plan getting vaccinated don‚Äôt get it. watches Fox may part problem. works fast food restaurant fear may passing infection unknowingly. ‚Äúmild‚Äù case COVID convinced never get again.she asked lunch, turned invitation even though fully vaccinated. keep hearing ‚Äúbreak thru‚Äù infection possible. spent year cautious don‚Äôt think lunch worth risk. would like see sister, wrong concerned?  Idk feel like seems throw word misinformation around pretty loosely. Maybe miss world without pandemic lol brussel sprouts less visible walking crutches wheelchair bound. 2 years ago flu. worst illness I‚Äôve ever lifetime. reason English use term ‚Äúflu‚Äù refer run mill cold gives cough sniffle. actual flu so, much worse. can‚Äôt even imagine COVID must be. I'm getting kind annoyed one particular vaccine take, namely ""if get COVID vaccine far likely mild"". I'm genuinely curious backed data -- current data find (especially regard Delta) suggests primary efficacy preventing cases (where 75-95%\* effective so). Breakthrough COVID-in-vaccinated cases appear get hospitalized maybe 25-50%\* less COVID-in-unvaccinated. That's better, upshot ""you far less likely get it, do, moderately advantage"". 

Instead, lot recent messaging largely ""it's supposed prevent cases, supposed make mild"". find disingenuous. mistaken this?

Data: I'm using public UK vaccine-vs-delta numbers shown (note wide confidence intervals Delta still new, that's exactly bring -- we're actually far confident cases prevented Yes live Southern California, masking enforcement businesses generally pretty good first months year here. businesses signs posters put up, general expectation inside commercial establishment, wearing mask, whether customer employee. wearing one, felt like odd person even one said anything you. state affairs took better part year attain. Changing social norms, especially something one particularly wants do, slow, arduous process.

Pissing away huge mistake. 

Worse, now, *are* wearing mask, people think vaccinated! actually weird stigma *wearing* mask current rules.

It's unbelievable fuck up. It‚Äôs gonna interesting winter cases yes, probably lot anti-vaxers continue denial consequences happen them. kids getting sick, reality would hard ignore point. flu changes every year, flu shot changes every year basically guess one going best shot (which sometimes get great success flu shots sometimes seem much) Getting flu one year mean protected next year, think saying flu strong last year means going hit hard year correct...although hit harder year simply people going wearing masks really really low benchmark previous year.  
I'd go far say it'll worse people getting vaccine covid also say no, I'm getting flu shot either. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

‚ÄúNah m8, fell good‚Äù dad polio vaccine available. There‚Äôs old newspaper article picture hospital bed mother standing him. She‚Äôs quoted article saying never thought would happen kids. dad suffered throughout life. He‚Äôs reason getting vaccinated. something prevent pain misery, will. Would safe get single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, 1-2 months, get two shots Pfizer vaccine?

I‚Äôm asking dual citizen two countries request get vaccinated locally vaccine passports/certificates. numbers definitely troubling. [This breaks infections vaccine status age, compare fully vaccinated unvaccinated (so excluding people 1 dose), 91.6% infections 50+ year olds last 2 weeks among vaccinated. That's far share population, would imply little vaccine effect. bunch variables could affect that, can't derive efficacy numbers, still great.

If take numbers [this would suggest 37 47 hospitalized 50+ COVID patients vaccinated, 78.7%. Again, great given vaccination rate age group low 90s, would suggest vaccine effect ~65% hospitalization. 

Again, bunch variables could driving this, hard reconcile idea 90% protection hospitalization numbers, even sample small. 90% protection Israel's uptake 50+ year olds, expect # vaccinated unvaccinated patients roughly equal. would argue flying necessity cover distance cruises luxury mention fly cruise ships location board Gotta love self sabotage. long term effects? none known expected. plenty long term effects known getting COVID. makes zero sense.

It 100% selfish. Anyone refusing vaccinate keeping COVID era going. Simple that. protected, get it, create new variant. 

Mind boggling refuse put COVID shit behind us. like living way? Reddit hub borderline child pornography long time, took mass media attention /r/jailbait finally ban subreddit.

Its Ok people die know them, guess.  Parts covid sub want us back 2020 lockdowns. Long COVID report prolonged, multisystem involvement significant disability. seven months, many patients yet recovered (mainly systemic neurological/cognitive symptoms), returned previous levels work, continue experience significant symptom majority respondents time recovery exceeded 35 weeks. illness, participants experienced average 55.9+/- 25.5 (mean+/-STD) symptoms, across average 9.1 organ systems. frequent symptoms month 6 fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction.

Cognitive dysfunction memory issues common across age groups (~88%). Except loss smell taste, prevalence trajectory symptoms similar groups confirmed suspected COVID-19.   Dying isn‚Äôt issue. Would like long term problems it? makes sense I‚Äôm sure plenty places ignore it. I'm quite sure exactly point is.

COVID risk would also exist athletes next 12 months leading next game.

For athletes less developed countries, access vaccine greatly reduces risk COVID hinged games occurring year. games would delayed, outreach efforts supply vaccines athletes. Yeah, guess intuitively also makes sense due amount infections.

If millions people get infected chance noticable number - absolute amounts - people lasting damage, (coincidental) blood clogging, children ICU, especially variants seem probable infection ratio gets controlled/attenuated time. Can't wait till reach time daily peak weeks close shit ü§£ someone forget tell virus put pandemic hold Olympics? 88% adults vaccinated least 69% double vaccined. 

Over 90% risk I've mumps, one side though, measles know hard measles (rubeola) German measles (rubella) chickenpox. remember mumps chickenpox. Haha, yeah happened wife‚Äôs work too. One loud mouth particularly pissed realized never get away going maskless. loudly proclaimed often throughout year she‚Äôd ‚Äúrather go jail vaccinated.‚Äù Strong words, permanent mask. üòÇ [In fairness banned requirement receive final FDA approval, tacked another bill real benefits

If CDC proactive shit Biden Trump, we're gonna big trouble. question is, fall look compared last decade?

We trying understand risk kids.

It's definitely nearly bad older people. Kids get Covid, died. many. less likely get tested far pandemic, though changing get vaccinated.

Young kids seem spread well adults. I'm worried spread nephew's classmates, I'm worried assistant principal person super antivax. thinking bacteria virus. I'm liberal I'm full vaccinated. make politics. True personal experience vax don‚Äôt really suffer get it. Plus I‚Äôm vax person exposed hours COVID wasn‚Äôt infected Good luck getting kids keep masks on.

I either see going back remote learning uptick private school enrollment. Scotland moved level 0 too.  Even Delta variant, vaccinated people testing positive. Delta variant increases likelihood percent, one reasons need higher threshold herd immunity, since effectiveness vaccine percent lower. want to. Also, it‚Äôs impossible know isn‚Äôt vaccinated. point (again) it‚Äôs simple use guidance one niche profession.

However, US almost never uses alternates Olympics, change much.

The real problem would someone main team (the one Simone Biles) tests positive, either put training pull competition. 5G coverage complete? Unlikely mask mandate implemented hotspots( Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana etc) although it‚Äôs worth try /r/COVID19Positive lot reports breakthroughs (totally disproportionate, btw, cause people breakthrough obviously going frustrated/angry post).

To make argument, links article *The Lancet* disingenuously included Japan South Korea list ""elimination"" countries, even though neither country ever pursued elimination strategy all. used exactly strategy world: try live virus accept many new cases every day, let get control.

Why worked (at least Delta) know; think clearly regional differences easy virus spread, know why. whole problem COVID suppression movement looks country seems well assumes tried harder countries well.

I know places controlled COVID others know case wanting more.

Now go grocery plan cancer screening.Hoping us able safely outside! Israel 0.1 percent positivity rate May. Agree that. ‚Äòtail‚Äô getting herd immunity longer needed due vaccine hesitancy. 

Overall though would equate rising cases making progress. 

Won‚Äôt completely linear literally everyday get closer herd via vaccines + infections. 

An actual mutation could fuck though notes effective 


""They're very, effective, 100%, higher proportion population double vaccinated, inevitable 10% large number remain risk, therefore amongst people catch infection end hospital."" reputation ego may well profit them. always fresh cash dollars  I'm sure that. I'd like think would true, I'm sure would care. Right? feel way COVID already can‚Äôt get people vaccinated protect few.

It looks like 54% fully wearing mask also imply social distancing, canceling indoor events + concerts, non-essential travel, etc., also necessary?  Right likely means virus peaked unvaxxed population. And, sadly, vaccinated population still skews older/at-risk breakthrough cases still likely (than younger/at-risk) severe :/ games couldn‚Äôt delayed again. clear never. Next Summer World Cup.

I think it‚Äôs disingenuous suggest Olympics, spectators attending, kind super spreader event. athletes support staff vaccinated. 

Some athletes support staff would catch covid hadn‚Äôt come Olympics. You‚Äôre hearing cases Olympics coming up. doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre would occurred otherwise. 

If professional soccer, basketball, football, baseball hockey, don‚Äôt see can‚Äôt Olympics.   Come on, guys! chances international sporting body would *lie* us? Delta variant also seems produce greater viral load shed air.... (Wish citation know found least one study broken /r/COVID19 past days)   already delayed games one year. either year cancel completely victim recently. Never forget, reddit. :) It‚Äôs unusual strategy, Cotton. Let‚Äôs see works them. make ridiculous comment like this...kill lol wtf many top professional athlete died covid ,I can't even think one ? UK's lockdown system terrible, know people hellbent defending many better far successful options. ok, so, answer? much doubt unvax‚Äôd going get shot point. so, going what, exactly? 3 days fantastic honestly. 

Without vaccination could've much worse. 

Even die, 3 days could've weeks pain suffering got better. think way. I'm expert hospitalizations seem risen fast cases Genuine question, always see people talk long covid. almost 2 years since initial outbreak, many cases long covid know lasted longer year? Covering whole room poo. Yep. 

Here find Florida IL near top list (not great either us :/) course amazing personally affected, please discount are. Right? That‚Äôs low positivity rate. That‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs interesting seeing countries react low case numbers. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs sustainable. cases. folks aren‚Äôt hospitalized dying high rates isn‚Äôt worth worrying much. True... population mingling freely there's kinds stuff spreading around again.

why lying? lot people still waiting second dose San Diego think 50/50 go shopping, mandate currently.  I'm sure better source, I've mainly occasionally looking vaccine [yellow card weekly state number total vaccines given. recently, July 7th, state  safety update report based detailed analysis data 7 July 2021. date, estimated 19.7 million first doses Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine 24.7 million first doses COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca administered, around 11.6 million 22.3 million second doses Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca respectively. approximate 1.1 million first doses COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna also administered.

That's 79.4 million total doses administered July 7th (we're 82 million now), 31.3 million Pfizer, 47 million AZ, 1.1 million Moderna. That's 59% total doses AZ, 54% first doses 66% second doses.

I think certainly true current *new* vaccinations mostly Pfizer, particularly age group currently vaccinated eligible AZ. overall totals vaccination program still half AZ.  [It's contract IOC Japan theoretically Japan could pull plug unilaterally, really feasible since they'd contractually hook insane amount damages. also resigned Government breaking rules helped craft. many deaths though homie. stage vaccinate move Damn that‚Äôs beautiful chart. knew vaccines we‚Äôre well seeing laid like shows good are. 

This stickied main page everyone see it. Ok, I'm going go limb say something that's probably somewhat going accept covid stay? failed getting enough people vaccinated virus always here. let vaccinated unvaccinated go normal lives? know millions people can't get vaccine multitude reasons enough people get shot (myself included) can't reasonably continue lives? know fair can't get vaccine. agree. fair. life ever fair? fair kids can't get it. fair older immunocompromised adults. get empathize want see loved ones pass away. prioritize vaccinated, children compromised adults need treatment covid people simply anti-vax.!&lt; learned anything 500% rise Netherlands parties everywhere masks?

Yes, learned worst thing happened clubs closed afterwards. Now, hoping UK right thing lets people keep freedom. [The vaccine works preventing hospitalizations even Delta variant. Stop trying control everybody even longer, young people prefer get natural immunity vaccine, let them. Hospitals empty vulnerable people fully vaccinated.  I‚Äôm making separate reply feel separate conversation. 

Yes, politicians evil firmly believe Desantis crassly evil. Even support centrism, never support. shat values lack decency respect humanity, home boy formerly White House. particular guy made wild predictions pandemic ~~haven't proven true~~ happen general public listened say.

Cruise ships far pollution anyway look it.  massive engine propel ships form power generation run systems support people weeks. 

Making comparison air travel cruises plain silly That‚Äôs gonna norm. Time stop even headlines. vaccine working Quick judge ya? Well particularly bad week, seems like US back hovering around 10,000 cases day. 

We shouldn‚Äôt lulled false sense security think could sign things stabilizing again. people UK haven't. early thirties end month earliest could second jab two weeks till fully covered. early. vast majority deaths among unvaccinated.   company must serious lawyer-speech-magic contracts. country seems ever gotten many dosages delivered thought ordered. probably correct. friends ti freaking lazy make 500m get pharmacy book vaccination.... literally 10 mins, maybe less. triggers living s****t position least masks come back hospitals reaching capacity. Maybe lockdowns, especially areas low vaccination hospitals overloading. Ideally, we'd put something place hospitals burst seams there's lag, even line ""95% ICU full"" would impose action maybe drive cases far enough hospitals could catch breath.

That said, expect areas position anything like this. This, unironically. I'm parent two young children live Arizona. governor recently legislated schools CANNOT mandate kids wear masks. addition, 7 day average Covid case count kids increased 97% week week. 

Our kids go back 1st week August.

WTF do? highly recommend lithium you. tragedy kids going lose parents, sick people going die fault lots DRs nurses going go hell.

People dumb and/or easily misled, always been. assholes know doing, care (Fox news, R politicians), vacc'd face consequences people deserve disdain.  Every country cities react strain differently FDA accepted application review, least Pfizer.   want president control information allowed access? case Biden would probably use responsibly everyone forget full control government 4 years ago. want regime like deciding allowed see? delay driven FDA 12 approval? seems driven timing trials waiting data set mature, no?

Fair enough, admittedly uk know anything him. States put children risk defend adults. Young adults choose take vaccine help defend realm. Older adults benefit vaccine directly likely die catch covid. Well worked brilliantly Netherlands weeks ago. suspect similar fantastic results time. Phillies fan sadly players blamed vaccine injuries..... say similar thing flying vs. electric hybrid car. even moreso versus bus rail.

I could go around murder someone time. consequences would rightfully locked up. So, lock up. Whatever means... Go island, found nation hill like-mindes people... Omg no, what, why, how??? UK leading Europe pandemic 

The thing UK trying lead people huge mountain, whereas countries taking relaxed stroll hills. We'll see gets side first fun. reports? site point to? live Florida know single person affected. presented even anecdotal evidence, simply experience. I'd love understand everyone claims Florida bad. I'd also like ask another favor (although I'd still like look data give source) tell Florida ranks compared rest country? frustrating. uninformed parents showing SB meetings demanding unvaccinated kids wear masks.

Also, time let Fauci go? can't guy level experience. He's clearly yes man I'm sure give time he'll saying boosters needed vaccinated people wear masks. COVID risk would also exist athletes next 12 months leading next game.

So, think 2022 situation basically athletes less developed countries, access vaccine greatly reduces risk COVID

For athlete participating, dozen trainers, assistants, translators, journalists, logistics, reporters, photographers, medics, etc also mobilized. justification Olympics least third world athletes get vaccine, maybe vaccine people third world regardless going participate Olympics not. also much athletes competing Olympics third world countries get vaccine.  Yeppers, point exactly. Kansas we‚Äôre much better. correct answer, thank you.

Why dumbasses keep saying over? We‚Äôve entire year filled brim studies this, every single one comes exact opposite conclusion dumbass misinformation insist spreading. 



Stop intentionally spreading misinformation. makes even puzzling would jeopardize children's chance compete vaccine given millions shown safe effective.

Obviously Parliament could change law would controversial.  exact numbers rate long term affects. Uhmm liberal reddit. allow facts here. No. Get whatever offered current place residence work authorities country get accept vaccination there. That‚Äôs fair point. Yeah, definitely

Do think make difference policies? Face masks? Lockdowns? far society concerned, lesser people. vast majority population vaccinated, going see pretty high proportion cases among vaccinated people there's literally nobody else left infected. 

The key overall numbers remain low. Saying 91.6% infections among 50+ among vaccinated really useful stat itself. compare rate proportion vaccinated/unvaccinated/prior infections figure true level efficacy. Jan -June many months majority population considered fully vaccinated. 

I‚Äôm interested data collect July Delta taken hold. Totally see lack logic.

Perhaps highlighting fucked around found get people see vaccinate. Israel seems like outlier compared countries. basing much testing actual deaths hospitalizations still quite low.  

This whole Twitter thread immunologist great job consolidating breaking available information.  said back, got corrected. Apparently flu manifest anywhere asymptomatic severely ill. Part reason spreads well due persons displaying any/many symptoms. I‚Äôm dr, don‚Äôt shoot wrong told. source ""more half"" claim? checked couple weeks ago Pfizer point neck-and-neck AZ, despite AZ available earlier, suggesting AZ relegated supporting role rollout. There's also Moderna too, lowers AZ's overall contribution. Couple thousand versions? 4 successful ones. make odds creating variant highest could be? spread breaktrhough cases have, higher odds ""immune"" variant apearing. really get nothing mentality.   hear 0 medical scientific training/education. mom never even ""the talk"" didnt even take chemistry highschool....and still figure fucking vaccines importance. need higher standards medical professionals humans general.

As far getting positive test ""without actually getting sick,"" think different people mean different things this. thing someone testing positive quite qualifying COVID-19?

All know efficacy numbers broken exhaustively things like death, hospitalization, severe disease, disease, minor disease, asymptomatic cases start. Actually, things, including whether successful vaccine would result vaccinated people transmitting, discussed exhaustively since well start. 

I thinking heard this, especially browsing subs like one, would know main stats we've talked 100% close deaths. short, I'd thought already knew ""without getting sick"" part.

Of course, plenty elements pandemic others think obvious know. case, shame progression expectations happened large, educated(!) portion public:

2) get one, hopefully 40% effective more

3) one, expect 100% recipients never test positive

Isn‚Äôt little bit least Japan? think so, seen UK-specific studies. There's study NORC/UChicago showing vaccinated Americans likely non-vaccinated individuals still wearing mask. every year elderly get boot influenza - get boot Influenza? not, why? Infection versus disease. Here's big issue.... wealthy countries fully vaxxed. Many poorer countries 2023. vacuum sure USA Canada, etc start going normal lives soonish. Olympics brings people world extremely different Sure. Op still wrong. Funnily enough, kids pick cues parents. I'm guessing might set great example them. Hopefully convince everyone get vaccinated! Vaccinations (in us) private info - be. 

Collective health takes precedence.

I‚Äôm tired us thinking individuality pandemic! takes US get it. Singapore , best tracing data planet, shows 0 Transmission asymptomatic double vaxxed individuals. However symptomic double vaxxed spread unvaxxed Every doctor know vaccinated, (n=3) know kids vaccine trials. I‚Äôm sure actually get though. people likely end hospital older folks chosen get vaccinated. 

If wait 8 weeks, 8 months rise cases people choosing put risk. could try vaccine passports- infrastructure monitoring required sort program work insane, plus puts many workers needless risk constant confrontation.

What‚Äôs needed sort real world consequence avoiding vaccination. Perhaps folks get taxed double triple regular rate order pay stress putting health care system. wish right, Ballad health system doctors nurses. agree. I'm concerned re-implementation mask mandates ""safe"" areas, like Pacific Northeast states. Especially places already started *recommending* masks again, like Bay Area southern Nevada.  saying free access vaccine pick choose? Children 12 don‚Äôt need going restaurants, bars, indoor establishments. Parents controlling children go, make sure spend time vaccinated adults. children go grocery store something parents, wear mask. 

Personally, got vaccinated, don‚Äôt spend much time around children. don‚Äôt frequent establishments children, I‚Äôm personally concerned. 

In general, children aren‚Äôt really risk serious illness virus. haven‚Äôt seen literature showing Delta variant worse variants. Ohioian, see anyone around wearing masks since mandate lifted.

I think since I've seen 2 individuals wearing masks since gas station employees. guidance unvaccinated people wear masks. Empirical story:

Am fully vaccinated w/ Pfizer since May, went Vegas weekend. 20% people wearing masks. definitely exposed symptomatic people (sniffles, coughing next craps table). wore masks partially indoors, mostly avoid cigarette smoke. wear masks eating indoors packed restaurants.

&amp;#x200B;

As Monday afternoon, symptomatic. even sure contracted virus. probably get tested days, sure. contagious Delta variant world wide expectations 100% population going exposed coronavirus point. slow spread, improve treatments, get bet vaccines, etc. virus stay. think postpone Olympics again, safe.   kids? Mine (7&amp;4) masked last year great. Every single kid know wears mask without complaining. still age learning ""the rules"" certainly able accept them.

Now, that's discounting challenges kids may developmental physical disabilities, makes important kids masked.

And Jesus got flashback July 2020. hell still argument? condescending dismissive.  
  
Some people work ways truly enjoy methods. Jogging certainly replacement regular resistance training provide benefits (but obviously jogging great too!). oh no

It‚Äôs really hard track.  Poor Kara. trained hard really talented. Even alternate US team huge honor.  That‚Äôs disgusting. unvaccinated terminated  Hell even one trip J&amp;J probably would've prevented this. Well, I'm Spain, live Japan. vaccines vaccination rates 1 2 months behind west... :/ might talking RSV‚Ä¶.. lot people confuse flu RSV going around right said good % deaths overall coming deaths like never said anything excessive deaths atm, tried tell might think people secretly suicidal homicidal. think comes vastly different personal beliefs world works different risk/reward calculations.

For example, firmly believe afterlife that's way better current life, might change view consequences death risk/reward balance lot actions involve risk death.

Or believe there's free God decides everything happens you, including die, people dying (yourself others) God's nothing human matters.

Or believe conspiracy theories, outcome vaccine (in mind) might much worse rolling dice covid.

Everyone make risk/reward calculations, sometimes results drastically different. lot times calculations based skewed false data, logic full cognitive biases, make person malicious. I've talked few. aware. 3 7 definitely pandering people though, least two 3 probably hurt next election, one represents district probably play well. Kind sad.   Even though could get nothing bad/ hospitalized covid, wouldn‚Äôt risk lose smell taste I‚Äôm young healthy. mean, wouldn‚Äôt enough get shot? Ah.... horse high :-)  think we're talking two different groups:

1. Fully vaccinated students teachers (the article linked to.)

2. Unvaccinated people.

The CDC saying unvaccinated people wear masks, since children 12 unable includes them. Lots kids 12-17 allowed vaccinated parents, really fair expect responsible getting vaccinated adult. American Academy Pediatrics suggesting stricter CDC says due (per Reasons recommendation include limited to: significant proportion student population yet eligible vaccination; masking protects vaccinated Covid-19 reduces transmission; potential difficulty monitoring enforcing mask policies vaccinated.

So really think AAP saying, ""vaccinated people safe"" rather, ""so many students can't vaccinated already vaccinated follow masking social distancing rules little longer too."" roommate vaccinated, due age? know gymnasts quite young I'm ages get vaccine US (and realize vaccinated people still get covid, curious vaccinated). Christ wish would States. lot soap either... got lighter? include children virus transmission vectors? Wrong, wrong. Indian saw devastation compared first wave. 

Zero norms followed. Mask prevalence fallen roof vaccinatioms picking up. 

People going vacations. Friends. 

Essentially going much ""third wave"" arrives. Lmao. Tell bedside NURSES!!! claim. claim. He's stating facts.  Save empathy GoFundMe, months medical bills surgery come due - high 6 figures, *easily*. say 50 group 93% fully vaxxed, average hospitalization age around 60 years old, close enough trying convey. Learn write.  trials gone long enough data show concerning immediate side effects established. 
I‚Äôd get kids vaccinated tomorrow opened them. Source? generally speaking, single dose enough give least partial immunity keep hospital. UK 88% one-dose vaccinated adults. presumably 50+ population actually high risk hospitalization even vaccinated. never way verify vaccination status always huge percentage people unvaccinated. brings back original point: what's endgame here? virus won, lost. Herd immunity never happen. Yes. I'm physician. mom works primary care medical office. keeping track breakthroughs Pfizer far. Again, scientific anything something noticed. Florida Delta also control well. Vaccines still work, interesting wish someone somewhere keeping track officially! live, seems like people welcome it. point people forced something - passports, vaccines, etc. Polio would still otherwise.

We cannot keep catering lowest denominator society. people talk getting ""at least one shot"" usually mean first shot second shot?

On related note, J&amp;J want get booster shot Pfizer/Moderna, get first second shot? Happening Florida. Yeah, private schools area known care guidelines contact tracing. want boost enrollment cash. go ahead say bad idea? think they're lying, worded wrong. know people least one dose get kind cold/flu, tested negative covid recovered 2-4 days. Maybe covid shedding enough virus detected? knows. Whatever is, spreading. really isn‚Äôt great headline really doesn‚Äôt weigh fact risk populations would mostly likely hospitalized ones fully vaccinated part. N95s back stock. using them. Go buy today! ( paid spokesperson )  hospitalizations deaths? important numbers Truly??? Must realize nearly hospitalizations 50, age group, vaccination rates 85%-95%. means proportionally, vaccines still effective math. Also need look severity length stay hospital. OP article. right, looks like recently banned spectators initially planning 50% capacity. almost certainly case outside reduces chance infection occurring - know outside air disperses particles efficiently stops building large numbers.

What's likely important ""choke points"" inside external big event.

Public transport, toilets, bars instances enclosed nature spaces lead virus accumulating.

I'd certainly expect drivers infection festivals, course people singing dancing close proximity - even outside - zero-risk strategy, lower risk similar event inside.  way trying downplay severity COVID, mother noted 'vapes regularly'. can't dismissed factor lung issues, COVID dealing finishing blow. dumb.  Actually, one gymnastics team members covid vaccine available her, dealing long haul effects. severe, still present. first arguing car accident victims counted covid deaths. thus inflating covid death numbers. 

now saying excess deaths around world explained by...covid. get skip line, determined going die soonest without transplant. sucks, preventable others still waiting lung transplant well (such cystic fibrosis). have. There's mention vaccinated hospital there's headline posted. Awesome, thanks. Good news there. Seconding. Seeing breakthroughs extended circle. ton enough would say it‚Äôs uncommon. Also know ER nurse seen fully vaxxed young people go ICU, they‚Äôre seeing overseas. wish knew actual numbers are, curiosity. know list possible symptoms post-covid pretty lengthy, good data many people actually experience long term symptoms?

Doubt unless nursing homes want pay workers more. It‚Äôs always bathroom facilities concern outdoor events. 

Not lot air circulation port-a-pottie used hundreds festival goers. OP say that? many breakthrough cases bad cold?

Because I'm ok taking chance means get live life (had COVID 2020 fully vaccinated). Welcome subset human race. simply ignore transmission, that's take vaccines reduce transmission see someone figh COVID without transmission point. Well country already saw serious implications delta 200k cases day peak multiple thousands dying day, sooner later US face something similar already low vaxxed states affected. suspect knew meant multiply avoiding embarrassing comment made. never headline. revisit thread ICUs full Delta hitting younger unvaccinated people States. noted (from article): studies evaluate rates less-severe illness debilitating ‚Äòlong COVID‚Äô symptoms linger months acute phase infection past. ‚ÄúThe low rate severe acute disease important news, mean COVID matter children,‚Äù says paediatrician Danilo Buonsenso Gemelli University Hospital Rome. ‚ÄúPlease, let‚Äôs keep attention ‚Äî much feasible ‚Äî immunization.‚Äù  Everyone definitely learn multiple. sure every athlete fully vaccinated months ago..

Maybe even weighting overall vaccine uptake area Florida sends compliments!!!üëã thenn covid? covid variant? 

look dude, even making sense, sorry say. popular, believe fully-vaccinated person tested absence symptoms. Otherwise *never going end*.

Many UK vaccinations AstraZeneca, know marginally less effective Pfizer/Moderna dominant US.

The UK vaccination rate higher US, approaching 90% vulnerable demographic. 10x vaccinated people substantial risk severe illness unvaccinated. 40/60 split actually pretty good outcome. vaccines work all, we'd seeing 90/10 split. I‚Äôve got even better idea: maybe get vaccine. think year we'd realized masks much bother pull.out promptly times heightened concern.

Only real problem realize clean one. without vaccines? Obviously virus spreads unvaccinated likely evolve potentially produce deadlier variant could affect even antibodies 

However risk still unvaccinated zero protection whatsoever, vaccine proven effective new variants thus far

So honestly, long deaths continue occur mostly unvaccinated, everyone ample opportunity get vaccine think it‚Äôs time get back normal 

I might sociopath seems fucking insane we‚Äôd continue keep locking people refusing vaccine getting virus chance protect consagrado week we're seeing first increase Covid case counts since vaccinations started rolling out.

They‚Äôve open yet middle road per capita deaths despite second oldest  population country. Point is, hasn‚Äôt cataclysmic.  appreciated vaccinated cases going down, really appreciate vaccinated knowing still safe cases go up.

It nice knowing matter cases go delta variant, basically doesn‚Äôt matter I'm practically zero risk serious illness. making assumptions, know even hospitalized 50+yo. lol also things, mask. really understand many lack reading comprehension. said *as much possible* ""forever"" Ramapo College  absolutely. hope gathering 1) variant 2) vax person get 3) long ago Something tells thats even close worst thing happen team.... month ago though. Cases spiked considerably since would expect either confirmation revised numbers one days. headache, sinus pain, slight cough, tired. Tested twice, negative. However experience teach wear mask heavy gardening, think that‚Äôs caused symptoms.. Rutgers? I'm still FML üòÇ risk, live people risk.

Currently strong enough argument so. they‚Äôre minimum age vaccine disqualifying condition.

This like ""everyone time get shot, live choices"" line thought. Yes, got vaccinated want cater anti-vax folks forever, daughter young get vaccinated. groups people relying everyone else protect getting vaccinated.  clearly read said. *As much possible* way = EVER

Also, referring unvaccinated problems continue cause society nearly vaccinated. believe herd immunity going thing Covid we'll dealing generations come. also booked second jab Sweden. It'll relief relax little bit least fall. reason thought spectator thing decided months ago

But vaccine thing called question due Delta, data Israel suggesting vaccines (or least Pfizer) could *much* less effective originally sold? Long Covid basically POTS.

Vaccine rate really consistent. 

The last 12 days seen 7 day rate 245k 278k Total agree! I‚Äôve got 10 year old thinking whether take get vaxxed say they‚Äôre 12. Let decide risk - letting anti maskers decide theirs. would true everyone likelihood hospitalized and/or vaccines given randomly, neither case.

To simplify, people 50 ever hospitalized everyone 50 vaccinated, everyone hospitalized would vaccinated. mean vaccine ineffective. 100 people 50 would hospitalized unvaccinated, 3 vaccinated people hospitalized, really quite effective.

Now, clearly cut dry, gist. cases surging full-blown wave, deaths increase much all. That's delta variant, dominant US well.

It looks like vaccines break link cases severe outcomes... problem actually convincing holdouts get shots. Question anyone may know. governor made illegal schools require COVID vaccinations. University able get away it? something individual schools would fight loophole college? TIA! covid killing kids rate killing elderly medically fragile, people would begging shots.

People keep saying like watch 20 kindergartners gunned school shrug. across board least polio 1 shot booster shots. never end. feeling probably ignore most. One parents rushes \`promote\` child's safety seat, badge honor right passage...to meet recommended safety guidelines.

Looks like 4 Moderna yeah, I'll look doc access to.  conservative talk show host area crowing radio today story. Also talking five Democrats charter flight got sick covid saying shouldn‚Äôt happen fully vaxxed. right really despicable group assholes comes virus. Take loss let citizens athletes around world get hurt. personally mind taking yearly shot much like flu shot meant better protection.  Great job mature adults. You‚Äôll go far. I'm trying quantify risk, compare something I'm familiar with. Colds, flu, covid kill. first 2 keep night. concerned Covid kids? need another year home? Covid current environment seems less risky normal cold season kids. I'm thinking would overly cautious keep home they'll benefit greatly in-person learning. kids call adults improperly wear masks.

Amazing children grown toddlers can't wear mask, children grown adults manage ease. 


If adults could fucking adult. mild case Covid: get participate keep others healthy.

With less mild case Covid: can't participate actually sick.

With strong case Covid: likely suffer long term damage definitely affect performance.

With severely strong case Covid: dead.

With vaccine: incredibly minute chance getting side effects might affect performance.

Hmmm, maybe people taken course logic back school, would've avoided lot issues here. delta variant 225% transmissible 225% transmissible? LOVE IT.

IDK AZ. Ha. US highest level well. fact remains methodology studies absolute fucking garbage.

Calling people random, asking COVID (without actually ever verifying it, mind you), asking feeling find many people *think* ""long COVID.""

But less worthless determining many people *actually* ""long COVID."" either going Britain's ticket pandemic absolute disaster. in-between.

We reported unusually low number new cases today, 39,950. comparison, two days ago pushed 54,349 new cases. Whether blip we've unexpected hit peak already remains seen. watching commercialized super spreader event goal ensure county's hospital capacity tested like last winter. Pre-emptive measures wise best-practices.

Most Hospitals near capacity last winter. 68+52 100 irresponsible unvaccinated people problem, they'll forego masking indoors (in essence lying status).

Not COVID jab makes irresponsible? choose believe everyone whose refused vaccine ignorance political standing? Maybe people want deal side effects. That's plan. It'd suck shows get cancelled postponed. Interesting, know side effects still happen people know nausea something like AstraZeneca Moderna. quite lot pain 2-3 days shots Vaccination spot. Well like vaccines. vaccinated measles attend, provide university documentation received measles vaccine, university require carry card around could show saying vaccinated measles. COVID vaccine requirement similar. could anyone know long vaccine antibodies last point‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry. Feel better!! don't.  see met mother.

I'm definitely going wearing mask flue season year. Also, tube ones keep face warm cold. Masks stay.   bunch studies support evidence wearing mask protects wearer. 

I mean maybe I'm school medical stem field, pretty easy find multiple credible studies. There's even pretty recent jama one middle Summer, wearing cloth face heat waves bit problem. actual title article is:

Randomized Controlled Trials gold standard, difference groups primarily limited intervention (masks eg). population level effect like this, hard do, one study done (the Danish one) underpowered statistically significant result obtained. 


Beyond that, systematic/meta analysis studies (of RCTs far preferred, observational/mechanistic studies often completely excluded) form best evidence. bit bunk covid-19 one RCT, masks influenza like ilness looked at, systematic/meta analysis done respected groups (Cochrane eg) find statistically significant difference without masks:

Well late July sound like getting close filing authorization anywhere, much less US. vaccines benefit longer interval. wonder might start seeing effects - UK ends higher efficacy due different treatment protocol.

We got roughly 40,000 Friday. think we'll get 100k given delta variant? I‚Äôll bite.

 complex calculations show? poor kids. imagine caring kid's health vaccinated population still much older/at risk. Therefore inevitible breakthrough cases STILL likely sever happen sadly. 

I think lot countries see point. serious cases hospital still vaccinated people. Younger decades. Utterly pointless waste click. information, headline statistics, nothing else help understand number, number.

Keep moving, nothing here. Depends much virus receive body takes fighting it... whether vaccinated.

If asymptomatic, likely get affected much. Good thing vaccinated.

But everyone's different. friend early 50s got Covid year ago he's still feeling effects. gymnast, unhealthy either got it. enough info‚Ä¶ age, healthy individuals, vaccine?! Questions questions Well, sadly, right. Someone inevitably think vaccine cause post polio syndrome. specifically worried long covid.

The narrative shifted preventing death/hospitalization concern measure vaccine effectiveness. MUST OLYNTICS EVERY FOUR FIVE YEAR trust Israel lot UK US comes science.   people hospitalized unvaccinated. Rates among unvaccinated mirror previous illness-death trends. 

Vaccinated people get sick likely hospitalized, unless sort immune compromise. say vaccines can't prevent infection, ha! vaccines sterilizing immunity--preventing infection almost situations--does mean vaccines cannot prevent infection some, most, situations.
