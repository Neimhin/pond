(It's like news, though - recommendations available months, least school districts enacted parts reopening plans.) don’t it.  hell talking about? eradicated 1. Smallpox. Relatively recently. There's animal reservoir smallpox.

There's almost chance ever eradicate one. possible became pandemic. time human history could have.

Bummer. looking forward videos Texas Rangers wading rebellious classrooms, beating masked teachers masked students. I’m pregnant got 2nd vaccination back May, along husband. Im 31 weeks husband sort seriously ugly bug going right. We’re scheduled tested Covid tomorrow. turns breakthrough Covid, shudder think we’d dealing right hadn’t gotten vaccine. oh thread 11 hours closed mods yet? nice  Yes Texas, would assume states too. Whether look routinely another matter. Right places Germany infection rate surpasses 35 per 100,000 inhabitants. tests required unvaccinated Germany. numbers rising though. Maybe corona cases October free tests available anymore. change hopefully motivate people get vaccinated. many adults unfortunately far. I’m highly vaxxed state (nj) haven’t seen hospital surge yet. Definitely us, vaccine seems helping keep hospitalizations low now. ~20 vented icu. None back side (surviving getting trach recover) Bc patients… none sent back us yet. Damn. Makes wonder much eat taste satisfying actual physiological need. Good see property tax money going good use.  nieces start Monday.  I'm perfectly fine this, hope really fully enforce it. That’s shit ton people say, got Covid.

Hence word irresponsible. Especially freaking teacher. What’s going do, carry air tank make sure doesn’t get Covid classroom air? 8/1/21 according CDC website, 5492 Americans hospitalized second COVID breakthrough infection vaccinated.   159 million Americans vaccinated.

 
Of 5492, 791 died 2nd Covid19 infections, almost elderly (over 70) secondary comorbidities.   
That makes death rate 0.005%. 

  
Your chance dying lightning strike 0.007%.

 
In fact, better chance hornet, wasp sting, sunstroke, dog attack, choking food, car crash. This. I'm going paste comment I've made couple times threads:

Just reminder may phased introductions vaccines under-12s. That's need run separate dosing trials age range. splits ranges might vary manufacturers, they'll broadly something like infants-and-toddlers, pre-school, elementary school. maybe something like 6 months 2 years, 2 year olds 5 year old, 6 year olds 12 year olds. approval group may happen separately simultaneously, know yet; prepared accept phased roll-out happens. nothing else me, pandemic quite education human nature. I'm glad said it. wish people would speak mind know avoid. Science awesome, it’s people understanding science problem.  Poverty overwhelming cause things computer screens basically flu shots currently? going work US. People follow lockdown anymore; barely following even last winter. stop large events, people keep seeing enough virus keep spreading. like masks, US-style lockdown draw things out.

An extremely strict China-style lockdown would probably work could done, people US would refuse tolerate it, doubt police would willing enforce level necessary.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  scary brain drain medical field is, forcing untenable situation depleting state resources would least force governments take Covid seriously again.  talking another redditor today. kids got sick, survived, said shocking thing I've ever read, ""I really care kids get it, get sick possibly die, care mine immune now."" I'm person replied to! yes, UK showing drop, huge drop (and neither Canada). One confounding variable seen discussed possibility UK PCR tests less sensitive.  definitely bad, goes show bad variant truly is. wasn’t sure disappointed vaccine efficacy, disappointed severity wave general. 

I think mainstream media us terrible disservice say 99% people dying unvaccinated. It’s misleading statistic. 

As far I’m concerned, little disappointed much affecting heavily vaccinated population. live state 58% population fully vaccinated I’m little concerned we’re headed considering what’s happening Israel.   imagine still Bevin? I'm sure 4 million us would infected now. agree. think it’s sensible based correct pandemic metrics fact lot people thread linked seemed say despite regulations people still generally wearing masks.

Pretty much anywhere US clubs bars open. Don’t think restrictions, even hardest hit areas. you’ve pointed out, key differentiator vaccine uptake. However, finally sold vaccine uptake plus *voluntary* continued NPIs. 

Should US follow UK’s lead, yes. maturity takes responsibly open (high vaccine uptake continued NPIs) hurdle far high Americans, can’t nice things without hospitals full. 

It’s like toddler keeps drinking icee fast getting headache. keep trying go back “old normal” it’s time yet, get burned - again. Maybe UK woods - real test kids school month two. hope sake numbers hold. get vaccine after? know, deaths lag cases weeks. deaths we’re seeing came cases diagnosed around month ago. 

And month ago cases roughly 1/8th numerous. 

What exponential colliding political.  Florida august lot bearable June. Also way lets combine memorial day start summer break. That’s brainer So...how numbers get wrong? 

There's got explanation happened. UK showing reduction efficacy Delta? person initially replied found confusing earlier studies showed Pfizer significantly effective 46% delta, earlier Israeli study. 

If UK showing significant drop efficacy really interesting maybe points greater effect length time since vaccination - although studies control this. she’s still breastfeeding exclusively we’re everything him.

That's huge benefit child. small study signs hope Australia hits similar numbers. similar culture UK.  Lockdown let big businesses die instead printing cash thin air,to try keep failing economy open. ""Surely lesson sink time!""  ICU bed, *also* using ventilator?

Or folks beds using ventilators? give fake name, show ID insurance, tell it’s first time assume? happened “Don’t Fauci Florida”? Oxygen unncaccineted people did'nt wear masks. Brazil 560k lost lives :'( one biggest tragedies country ever faced thanks fucked government uncle thinks he’s worst governor country shut downs mandates. Holidays lot “fun”. In-laws LA hosting baptist church homecoming weekend. Hundreds attend. still can’t smell right, often think smell smoke. 8 12 weeks best reopens 50% get first jab.... Enough hate speech.  Don’t think cares actual kids get infected die, course. Every kid go home family adults kids every night, everyone family go interact people every day. Rinse repeat 5 times week.

Schools big societal vector disease transmission long covid came along, nothing changed covid here. oversimplified virus like covid. Since there's significant period transmission victim becomes seriously ill, there's selection pressure really evolve less deadly (a deadly variant easily reach significant number victims less deadly one), entirely random chance either less deadly. selection pressure right transmissible variant, see Delta overrunning Alpha. ""Knucklehead"" tax. going stop people travelling ""to inspect real estate potential purchase"" loophole?  Good idea. enables everyone choose every one safe. vaccinated patients also tested? carry transmit virus well per CDC. together let's make happen together. evidence suggest mrna vaccines SIGNIFICANTLY better real world.

Even clinical trial, marginally better using trial standard. frank, SinoVac's trial conducted third party hostile political environment. Yet true.  understanding testing still required amongst unvaccinated; it’s free more. Best worlds, no?  Right now, number serious cases (this people 60) per 100K 95.4 unvaccinated 16.4 fully vaccinated. vaccinated rate 17% unvaccinated rate. 

The absolute number vaccinated seriously ill (60+) people 216 unvaccinated 86. 

So efficacy still pretty good. nevertheless, number breakthrough seriously ill people disturbing bad enough overall curve seriously ill looking pretty steep right now. (60-80% deaths vaccinated people lately). 

You find info here: Leaders making laws make illegal build defenses. probability highly vulnerable subjects won’t get tested

People actually can't get vaccinated medical grounds vaccination yet recommended (kids?) still get free tests. wilfully ignorant (or lazy) pay. 28000+ wrong. would increase way line current trends. 18000-20000 much believable numbers corrected to. Blue team won. First world privilege something. can't read dispute six-month claim, regardless, solutions propose?  preventable death tragedy crazy. Schools crowded. teacher, imagine vaccinated. would hot mess 90% students face face, school district acting like everything fine mask mandate. True, overwhelmingly delta. ""and weekly testing"" Can't help respect people like this. could easily said ""its control, higher ups said masks"" gone day.

Putting political cross hair backs defying order prevalent topic take job advice experts seriously something world always need of.

The governor taking direction ground dealing reality situation instead instrument flying way things like this. 3 Major Airlines getting business guess.

Damn it. Guess I'm flying United...I **HATE** United... Hey Biden, actually wanna hear blip you, jk dawg haha biggest issue see teacher lunch room (at mask mandated school). school still shoving 3+ classes lunch room putting 3 outside. Regardless three classes exposed 30+ minutes. also teachers refusing take kids outside snack.    sad pathetic situation spoiled rotten Americans refuse wear masks vaccinate. starting near NY peak 18.8k start last year :/ at, may ask? He's vulnerable he's ever *with electorate* Texas legislature would never million years. fan law, support anti vaxxers (I've vaccinated since early march), increase transmissibility virus since fewer people get tested continue going daily lives spreading others, including vaccinated. don’t think so. nursing union freaking it’s part contract negotiated

I’m pro vax mandate btw both? decision unfortunate Shits got bad here. Worse last year sadly needed. medical friends say don’t enough staff beds folks. Yea. Maybe folks reading wrong...

Our family got vax first day could. We've worn masks entire pandemic. kept oldest school year done remote learning. We've done **everything**.

I pretty terrified send kid back school. option point. can't simply ""stick remote learning."" two working parents baby + kid going crazy home. We've bought best masks find hoping best. fucking sucks. Santa Clara County hospitals pay pretty low waged compared rest SCC, retirement package fantastic Meh, didn’t seem problems conceiving shot. Yup. Airlines paying whole pandemic.  yeahhhh buuutttt fully vaccinated people spreading D-Variant easily non vaccinated (CDC's words mine) fully vaccinated people still getting pretty sick even dying (granted small few). already put see another variant outpaces current vaccines within matter months year. However could get 80% population wear mask anytime outside household would see HUGE drop cases within month problem soon got vaccinated quit patient started going concerts (which require masks ) indoor dining. Literally masks could would solve this, vaxed not. antivaxxers want shot mandated wear mask times outside home. One other. China rational it’s going go covid elimination. strategy worked brilliantly it’s strategy shown work. aren’t going change it. ""Unknown client""

 hmm🤨 think last year’s lockdown didn’t go far enough, well, I’ll tell ya, that’s lockdown we’ll ever get here, probably happen again. Honestly, people caring anymore gives lots hope return normal. want everyone vaccinated, we’ll get eventually, I’m tired caring this. want life back I’m sick told I’m anti-vaxxer want hard date ending restrictions. sub silent last year California New York paced whole country stop acting like people aren’t complete idiots? cares original reason was? We’ve given vaccine roughly billion people. Across dozens countries. It’s SAFE. know this. Anyone uses logic they’re distrustful government willfully ignorant best complete moron refuses scientific evidence worst Pfizer reduces delta transmission 39% according study done Israel. got last November, prior moderna vax. Take care friend! Thanks. underlying conditions prevent vaccinated. Thank goodness recall election then. Boo Agree. fear happening south move north later fall. 520 kids died COVID US far, according Forbes. Considering fact vaccine-preventable infection, many child deaths ""okay"" point? Maybe unpopular opinion. vaccines approved ages, 2-3 months stop caring COVID. Let idiots want wear mask get vaccinated get sick acquire natural immunity die. Fuck 'em. everyone care aside kids vaccinated. Everyone chance approved everyone. rest us want get living. They're going listen anyway. Let natural selection thing. Well heat may driving people inside seeking air conditioning. would likely make July/August peek season Florida.  I’m teacher well totally second everything said!  burnt UK bc school let out.  This!  hope thy determine statistic vaccinated people long covid. duty vaccinating, feel safer used feel lot less anxiety, I'm still bit troubled. UK reporting 100,600 25s long Covid makes wonder far vaccines get risk. Vaccines 100% effective lack full herd immunity time soon (if ever) troubles me. sure you’re downvoted. toll must take parents (especially it’s low-income household) must overwhelming. Well pretty blips covid patients. leaders failing much worse. Wake use brain. defense Delta Air Lines. new employees required vaccinated 75% workers airline vaccinated. point people gathering mass everywhere. care anymore. Sturgis one problem thousands. noteworthy issue Sturgis norm. small town 3000 people streets local festival. that's town 10000 people. Sturgis blip map thousands gatherings nationwide.  Hey school district tell someone class lice, covid. indeed encouraging. 15 year old fully-vaxxed, sorta alramed people sub telling protection 1 3 chance long-term brain damage. 

Some people, man... might Tylenol. came remember discussion could people use Tylenol bring fevers, fevers pregnancy harmful developing fetus. could working together. 

Short story: avoid getting sick injuring pregnant avoid Tylenol, needed talk doctor safe dosage amounts treating *your* symptoms. latest data delta variant COVID-19 predicted impact Oregon dire. Labor Day, OHSU predicts state short 400-500 needed staffed hospital beds. means Oregonians able get hospital care COVID-19 I’m 31 weeks along currently got shots back early second trimester doctor telling would 100% get (I’m teacher around lot maskless kids.). told last visit pushing every single one patients get he’s delivered two babies mothers ventilators last two weeks countless others ICU. Exactly. end day still relatively new vaccine developed big pharma lot motivations besides ""good society"". trust vaccine trust covid? **Hell yes, got it.** vaccine hesitant neccessarily equal antivax covidiot. trust vaccine trust covid mean fully trust vaccine- weighed risks me, risks vaccine worth it. Call ask someone fully vaccinated flights. buy ticket. No, first. Freedom speech. government cannot tell cannot ask for. Lawyers already based argument. put feel words. Wow everyone using office spew garbage definitely received vaccine Fear still driving lot decisions despite vaccine people know really effective. hard say unvaccinated people can’t come race pandemic over?

We’re punishing everyone frustrating Teacher loved virtual learning: Part going back physical learning totally parents able handle it, part school many students' meals come from, part is, some, school reprieve abuse occurring home. think right really hoping FDA approval approval kids 12 comes soon. two think see ton businesses, schools etc requiring vaccine hopefully get gap closed much quicker 70%. 

In countries saw delta come hard fast stick around long. think cautious shut things cause panic/outrage doesnt last long. careful balance try send message delta serious everyone still encouraging people get vaccine. see lot ""well vaccine doesnt work get it? going make sick!"" bad logic critical thinking challenge some. Mask forever stay inside, that’ll show stupid republicans! Glad live there! be. think even school change he's saying, anymore deadly harmful original kids, neither change volume cases. think US I'm worried number infections high due school even low hospitalization rate kids still lead overwhelming number children treat already limited number pediatric nurses, doctors, healthcare facilities. can't imagine spread like wildfire ages without vaccines.   hope come support this! two friends done children. physicians. 11-year old, would consider it. God *only* Florida country, could close border. Quarantine it. Yeah people go outside. friends vaccinated really care anymore pandemic. may scummy least number one thing save lives. Eating outside option parts country, all. places I've lived rain, snow, and/or low temps majority school year. Urban schools climates often access sufficient outdoor space campuses, either. they're hoping draw misery, uncertainty, fear covid midterm elections 2022. biden made #1 goal get US covid. therefore GOP make damn sure covid's side. I'm angry too. reason made sense time. expected adult vaccinations would slow spread COVID, kids seem susceptible original variant. already pushback antivaxxers saying (incorrectly) science adults rushed. wanted make sure science unimpeachable pediatric studies.

Unfortunately, FDA design nimble body. able respond rapid changes like this.

They know, all, time vaccine approved kids, late. Many school age children exposed infected. People love pretend trump voters go “super spreader events” like lollapalooza didn’t happen. People need grow get bubble. fly united. Got it. know cases schools mask mandates obtained school, interactions weekend family members, social events happened outside school playdates sports events. Teachers indeed granted somewhat early access. got vaccinated. Now, required get now. seem chaotic me. think people sub assume since it’s safe 12+ must safe kids. That’s huge assumption, children fair different reactions whole range things (including virus itself) hope careful enough? sure. help? think wrong. ask misinformation spouted off? know harmful tread lightly, debated even answering question knew answer wouldn’t welcome. going sink fool? Putin fucking us years point people getting vaccine. got back Hawaii loved it. First real vacation since March 2020. Even Delta, vaccines extremely safe

Not mention Delta could last major wave thanks increasing vaccination well immunity delta. Theoretically, future waves, shouldn’t big severe unless variant evades vaccines even they’d probably still protect least hospitalization 

Dr. Scott Gottlieb says Covid delta surge may ‘final wave’ U.S. side effects? I'm late 20s I'll probably get AstraZeneca months don’t need them, don’t need perfectly, though.

Schools given relief funding improve ventilation. done so. understand many didn’t. Living reality, purchase portable HEPA filtration systems classroom. $300 make real improvement.

Masks mandated. Every school this. Many won’t.

Vaccinations mandated teachers. Every school this. Many won’t.

Testing cheap easy part every district’s plan. it’s not, probably schools worried looking bad cases.

My sister teaches public school, many friends. Many ideas doable. stop paying testing everyone maybe put whole thing behind us. /smh Lone Ranger. They’re gonna spin regardless. comes (I don’t know else word this) potentially sacrifice lives working ‘deal’ prevent even deaths future, give ventilators probably keep sending there’s change Florida’s response.. One local hospitals today presented scary forecast Oregon’s hospitals completely overwhelmed September. think made difference. people swear masks tier vaccines terms protection/mitigation, it’s almost cult like point.

Any US teacher vaxxed now, without major medical exemption, major issues. Ugh nooooooo rate death never percentage point gen pop. prior obese 50 3%. elderly 5%. 

Once hospitalization qualified, survival rate slips hard, that's risk groups.


Let's say worst case scenario, deaths somehow double.  Florida still maintain top 50th percentile non mortality covid

Just cut 2000 days FDA told Pfizer Moderna double number children try accurately gauge myocarditis risk, slowing trial.

Though jokes galvanize already polarized bullheaded facebook laureates. plan quite simple really. short 7 day lockdown everytime detect 1 case community.

It works quite effectively, means borders able open (which looking unlikely NZ borders open 2023) yet recommended stiko Germany. get illness certified doctor. political assholes creating need held account. Starting Abbott. (I'm Texan vote anyone runs fool, loudly support future challenger). Preach   Imagine teacher 40 kids crammed together classroom built 30. trying teach curriculum, whether high school algebra, history gold rush, correctly form words letters. Now, top that, supposed constantly police students correct mask-wearing procedure, enforce social distancing, monitor air quality room? maybe classes go around sanitize surfaces?

Yeah, right.  I'm bumfuck Texas like 3 quarters us. county hit 30% vaccination rates. Ironically seems survival rate 99.9%… properly vaccinated. Going guns blazing  ~16 months ago COVID brand new ravaging NYC Bos-Wash corridor, constant flood stories ""political pawn""?

I mean, honest. Southeast shit creek right want anyone talking *know* they're fucking response. damage control, genuinely weird. I've going 'the truth changed, new variant acts differently response change' dad still get vaxxed I'm sure helpful that's been. least soothe ruffled feathers went back masking work couple months mask needed vaccinated.

Edit: old article. Since vaccinated people unlikely die COVID, get back normal let unvaccinated people take chances? douchebags situation. 


Unfortunately quite douchebags.  Yes, morons want morons support moronic policies. Even though virus going kill supporters, opposing party's supporters. Moronic Ideology Exemplified roots planted past, though life changing fast, wants beeeeee. She’s survivor. Well plenty morons still equate life death issue gray area. live Missouri children's hospitals full despite school even started yet thousands protesting mask mandates schools citing ""low death rate"" kids. parent infuriating. ask id? thought getting funded? Like insurance ventually pays it.?  Yeah feel like it’s 50/50 vaccinations grumbling masks mostly everyone complying. Even parents send kids sick think teachers keeping eye symptomatic kids. family thinks DeSantis Abbott basically saviors….. Read cdc article yesterday stated around 10 month male effectiveness vaccines started drop off. I’ll try find link. would rather die, even though like actions choices.

You're trying use sophistry avoid answering question.

You're mixing whether help person would make decision help them.

I suicidal child. hurt themself to, dunno, pass time something. think stop that. keep taking hospital. Would easier stopped making choice? Yes, course. Would want put much pressure choose dying stopping? course not, I'm still dad. 

What kind monster would refuse care someone, able to? wish could impression death worse thing could happen again. Ugh, you’re right that. I’m Texas. Trust say feeling crushing weight people’s selfish decision making. vaxxed? need boosters. People top things vaccinating early punished. aware of, could one fine print things. fear fertility affecting created first vaccine (Pfizer) approved brochure said vaccine tested pregnant women.

Which true, people pregnant normally sign clinical trial drugs obvious reasons. mean statement meaning read lines. congratulations! What’s potassium tell you? Plus still spread stubborn antivax family. would save lives, even directly.  agree

I’ve bullshit. Let kids get shots move lives. On/Gyn here. Pregnant women strongly advised get vaccinated. wanted make clear. people overall vaccine contraindicated. ""The governor noted number COVID cases among visitors ""relatively low,'' 1 2%. bulk travel-related cases residents returning island infections.""

Sorry Florida, extremely personal decision done research determined cannot them. 🙌 would love see also morbid curiosity bad get Florida winter whether get bad enough GOP something it.  Yes. one group politically biased, another. reality situation consensus. Political divisiveness making public discourse impossible nobody right answer point.

Might even get test faster do. a1c currently middle finger emoji, hope not. Bro, totally get saying. But, really think folks getting vaccine actually getting tested???   use back door fountain. Gotcha 

Look there’s way around saying people don’t get vaccinated need segregated- sounds good paper it’s actually segregation 

Does bother would disproportionately effect minorities especially black people group high vaccine hesitancy? Sturgis spread Minnesota last year started 2 people. Normal R expected would far lower case count happen. That's defined super spreader event. sheltered 10-day motorcycle rally South Dakota attended approximately 460,000 persons, 51 confirmed primary event-associated cases, 21 secondary cases, five tertiary cases identified Minnesota residents.

Regardless company's flight on. going dick, expect beating. observers drama, condemn policy, anecdotal results policy. problem *my mask them* *their mask me.*

If COVID sneeze, cloth mask barely going shit since aerosols thus viral shedding likely reached me. wearing mask however project aerosols near far, social distance might actually work save contracting virus.

I swear fucking virus *perfect* punishing humanity's inability work together, look other, etc. assholes get hurt- people trying right thing too. 

And let challenge bit more: consider poor assholes TX FL. schools can't mandate masks (at least many places- places willing fined). Plenty places limited virtual options. Many kids can't even get vaccinated yet *and they're going marched right school ~r8-10 virus everywhere.* might die lifelong long COVID, might pass adults lives might immunocompromised, breakthrough cases, etc...

The parents cases often choice- 2 jobs work homeless ""you tug hawd enough yo bootstwaps poor!""  live fantasy. far less infectious version disease killed 600k people masks unprecedented distancing measures.

Dude, you’re one living outside reality. Dipshits running around without masks ignoring distancing throughout whole thing. Spreading shit everyone could without second thought. 600k deaths. people realized members community actually followed protocols, number would significantly lower. 

Masks aren’t cure all. They’re another tool toolbox. Texans quit pretending we’re rugged individualists recognize members local communities, need look other, maybe get ahead this. Crying wear mask isn’t going get us anywhere though. many case, definitely see work activities - much portion I'm trying understand ""their"" mindset. short, little brother works ""CORE"" (a group aids vaccination) California experience Van Nuys bit dissappointing. WIthin 12 hours work, screen aided ~ 80 people passed opportunity vaccinated - preferer tested. 
Its bonkers 
1) unless underlining condition, vaccination completely safe protect blunt virus.

but importantly, 
2) already VACINATION location - take free shot scotch free living fair? 

As stated earlier, already line tested degree - believe virus deadly real - stop short? Freedom choice quite frankly matter deadly disease spreading people. also free get vaccines. free go school. free smoke indoors. Well way corrections work, come following days average out. usually results 7d looking like short plateau going back again. I'm sure cases accurate measure given we've mostly stopped testing. Hospitalizations probably better metric lead time indicate healthcare system taxed. least saw rise cases, knew hospitalizations would follow couple weeks deaths another couple weeks. hospitalizations going sneak reactive instead proactive.

We're world hurt come fall. Damn. guess we’ll live then. I’ll still get vaxxed i’ll expect get anyway hopefully vaccine keep dying. Pretty much. think deeper tbh. politicians taking advantage attitudes beliefs inherent culture society :( really. intent vaccination prevent spread. However, mutant variations, getting tougher vaccines losing effectiveness Look change instant vaccines full FDA approval. Insurance companies are, nature, risk-averse. they're unlikely--it's possible may even allowed to, IDK--to mandate something that's still *technically* 'experimental,' case potential fallout later. soon full FDA approved list, want. That's guess, anyway.  vulnerability choice, whereas someone’s vulnerability due medical reasons not.

Leggo eggo.  stop. getting where. debate kind topic people. Well Delta seems outpacing variants.

Also, Delta lethal? hear that? want enter shop get know food. need test shows status. Hamburg already incidence 60. it’s increasing quickly  I've one Pfizer one Moderna. I'm Canada government already authorized mixing matching. first shot got Pfizer got sore arm, second shot got Moderna full flu like symptoms although cleared within 24hrs. Think they’d put mustache 6 year old? 9th island. Sounds like someone actually want lower corona cases Germany.  Well give reason? there’s already variants there. delta variant contagious lethal original. next year there’s variant even contagious one? That’s real possibility nobody accurately predict. 

If stay stagnant vaccination rates, people don’t get boosters, stay open, don’t mask mandates, would less severe next year? 

There far many variables individual make claim delta variant final surge. 

I genuinely want see rationale claim.

Really, mask outside try restrict person gatherings like minded disease. We're point vaccine preventing infection anymore significantly reducing effects illness. going case moment people vaccine could spread like case delta. 'Right' extent, sure. There's pretty widespread agreement protection infection a) lower Delta b) wane time. vaccines actually designed prevent infection, fact (still do, extent) bonus. However, Israeli study 'right' flawed made things look worse likely (it agree studies countries). guys involved explained why; ideas PRISM? unvaccinated opportunity get fully vaccinated place. want ensure everyone wants vaccine chance get fully covered. 6 weeks doses (for BioNTech, least), two weeks second dose full efficacy, recently country finally enough doses available offer one everyone wanted one, combines October earliest reasonable timeframe.

Also, 8 weeks first dose full efficacy, giving 2 months warning plan fair. People convinced get vaccinated go first dose fully covered time takes effect. increase linear, may vaccines losing efficacy time, may simply odds breakthrough infection increase time.

I mean, day vaccination, would zero breakthrough infections, vaccine effective, simply people time exposed yet. incidence breakthrough infections would naturally increase months even vaccine maintained efficacy. BionTech leader, one say so, yeah, stonks around mRNA vaccines performing well companies like BionTech manufacturing vaccine itself. Gut feeling? Yes, likely indeed. fact can't end year (with proof double vaccination US indicated others implemented), surprised disappointed. US least given full FDA approval see various mandates put place children vaccinated left right. Along vaccination rates least countries issues right like Japan, South Korea, Australia etc increase. doubt winter spike bad. vaccines never targeted prevent infections - bonus feature. However, yes, working 'Delta' targeted revised vaccines would likely restore lot transmission-reducing ability, e.g. would tie court system? government ending system rapid tests paid government, tests going €20. Vaccinated people need rapid tests (hence cost applies unvaccinated), PCR tests suspected cases still free. Also, people can't get vaccine whatever reason required pay. There's legal issue whatsoever could even taken court, much less tie all. don’t show immigration status get vaccinated. way wrote could make people think immigration status checked vaccination sites.

There also social aspect much shut protect unvaccinated, tests paid us. vaccinated majority (about 2/3 eligible vaccine - kids currently vaccinated), move adjust lockdown measures needs vaccinated. Right unvaccinated costing everyone money, filling ICUs increasing everyone's risk - especially cannot vaccinated.

The virus vaccine use EXACT spike proteins create immune response therefore protection. 

If get shots days really bad immune response symptoms that’s damn good reason get next shot. live virus MULTIPLIES spike proteins get progressively worse. people reacting vaccine ones ending ICU live virus.

The difference vaccine gave “feel bad booboo” couple days immune response wins… SPIKE PROTEINS CONNECTED CELL STRUCTURES LIVING! can’t multiply grow infection.

The live virus would devastatingly painful people, don’t yet know means would progressed covid “death map” see critical care deaths. know means would “stayed home days recovered”. ones would ended ventilator vaccine. though? Miscarriages really talked experience. What’s normal background occupancy?

I remember people saying UK. hospitals typically run 85-90% capacity. all, it’s efficient lots unused beds doctors sitting around nothing. 

If there’s major even like pile-up, music festival accident etc people get shared multiple hospitals. 

That’s pandemic uniquely stressful healthcare system - everywhere affected time. IIRC United’s policy like that, point I’m actually pretty surprised Delta. (pun intended) They’ve really ahead COVID precautions past year, mandating vaccines employees might give PR boost instead people getting confused variant. Anyone else concerned next variant?  regions there's lot community spread they've reinstated indoor mask order, limited capacity restaurants, advised travel region, shortened time first second doses 7 weeks 4 weeks (it's province-wide policy now). Healthcare insurance co-pay penalty unvaccinated hospitalized caveat co-pay penalty goes hospital. anyone statistics 1 dose vs 2 dose vaccine protection? lack vaccines live, gonna long time next dose. But… we’ve already society decades. require vaccines traveling certain countries via employers state schools. isn’t new. mean Israel already giving boosters. Yeah auto immune technically danger like that's minute danger medicine address point, comment someone made might helpful different point : already ""the next variant"" one one that.

She contracted Delta almost died it. feeling better walking around oxygen machine. I'm sure when/if she'll able breathe 100 percent own.

I understand vaccine pose health risk some, bigger risk Covid, especially Delta? seems like ""maybe not"" genuinely know. I’d agree. Unless force everyone get vaccinated (as government done previous illnesses) entire ordeal continue. wouldn’t mind masking vaccine approved children (I know they’re working one kids young 5), that, let go. sensible decision. I'm surprised healthcare companies added co-pay penalty unvacinated hospitalized Covid-19. Yes, that’s correct. [As August 2, CDC received reports 49 U.S. states territories 7,525 patients COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection hospitalized )They aren’t monitoring cases those. 

Contrast state California alone, reports [21,083 fully vaccinated individuals diagnosed want know mild cases Covid-19 don’t result hospitalization death, cannot get data CDC longer. thought they'd check vax cards. comes it, may that. guess hypothetically possible vaccine safe first 3 shots, trigger lupus 4th?

Practically, there's probably enough data prove 3rd shot safe effective (at least FDA standards). *really dangerous*, I'd expect see news articles bad things happening people vaccines, I'm seeing that. review decided barring vaxxed US citizens despite numbers exceeding threshold. isn’t happening don’t anticipate happening anytime soon. revenue receiving probably pretty sweet healthcare system isn’t overwhelmed. bit light headed, that's all. Everybody going catch covid. Well know fully opening economy lead overwhelming health services adult population high levels vaccination. UK Israel prove that. 

Israael hospitalisation rates rising rapidly. Restrictions implemented however minor. Israel furthermore racing give everyone view vulnerable boosters prevent spiraling death rates. 


The UK reopened hospitalization rates rising. Combined expected crush winter respitory infections we'll less capacity cope covid. NHS knees already, can't cope much back last winters hellscape. Finally waiting backlog 5 million expected hit 14 million. Every covid patient ties resources burdened already. Indian example rubbish 

Rubbish, know need doses. India thought got hit hard. know need boosters. one winter coming. Either roll roll dice hope needed. rolled dice lockdown containment impossible to. UK rewarded procrastination one highest deaths per capita rates world. NHS failed cope, hence massive backlog treatment illnesses prioritising 3rd doses 1st doses humans.


We talking protecting health system collapse. UK populace accept another lockdown doses hand prevent it. options suck sure hell rather one else locks winter UK. Every wave resulted differed treatment non covid related illness. People died could receive treatment told delay. People failed screened cancer symptoms Western nations selfish pressure applied - especially nations already vaccinated population. 


Fact know whether boosters needed. fully vaccinated populations anywhere world. 12s globally vaccinated UK 16 up. know booster required, know time sure late.


It selfish prioritize ones safety pandemic disease proven much harder defeat expected. Hence person charge oxford vaccine saying export doses, give people already protected more.


Ethically &amp; morally easy say send doses they'll good. Politically impossible anything roll boosters. get wrong condeming nation another hammering. professor howl wind like one listening. Fact booster scheme happen, globally roll boosters. without lockdown, social distance, mask get it.




TL;DR

Either NHS takes hit one else doe's. resident United Kingdom rather able complex health issues treated. wait 6 months receive treatment cancelled past due covid. waiting list massive contunues grow, expected 14 million next year. Winter see massive wave respitory illneeses requiring hospital capacity. Covid boosters hopefully ease burden NHS already struggled winter pre covid days. 


If NHS capacity cope pressures would different. NHS capacity anything helps lessen burden save lives. Walk place say want first shot.

That seemed hit home them. me, getting away from, feels like everyone, point getting room actual doctor. 1) point vaccine rate, China (and maybe Singapore) combination mass vaccination mass testing/isolation.

Think way. Asian countries (no China) able control original vaccine problem rt rate 2-3.

Now, delta rt rate 5-7, Asian countries cannot control, China higher vaccine coverage, reduce rt rate back 2-3. that's China control Asian countries cannot.

2) far t-cell isotopes change variants. Sure people get infect (waning immunity antibodies due time variants), far fewer get sick due t-cell protection. vaccine help. Vaccinated people also reduce transmission 50 75%.

The questions whether China control, worth keep strategy. That's lot economists type quote articles. allowed??? son weekend so. drug, MesenCure, tested Rambam Medical Center

Rambam, thank you, ma’am absolutely accurate, graph alone shows Delta variant's transmissibility much closer chicken pox OG strain, even SARS-1/HIV/Ebola. Nah - strange scenarios ""a vaccinated employee (who required vaccinated) gets infected"" ""a vaccinated employee employer vaccine mandate gets infected"" would difference workman's comp eligibility.

That sounds like fictional internet law (along lines ""HIPAA means can't ask vaccine status"" nonsense), actual legal thing.

And think major airline considers fictional internet law deciding whether vaccine mandate. Listen science

Did miss anyone talking schools? soapboxing attention? seems odd. message vaccine came got severe symptoms entirely due immune systems stronger. explained women symptoms vaccines men. 

But you’re saying doesn’t mean stronger immune system, means would/will get bent covid.  guess change vaccines actually approved beyond EUA. 

Tough sell mandating vaccine technically approved. (I vaccinated btw.) issue counting another partially vaccinated individual, skewing numbers America, that's gonna happen GG guarantees discrimination.

And no, mistaken. Almost entire oppostion critical voices, die Linke ove r Grüne FDP. Gross Dude... let. it. gooooo.

Have great day... Jeez. original SARS-CoV-2 virus zoonotic sub-optimal affinity binding ACE2 receptors humans. means virus good job infecting humans beings. Delta higher affinity human receptors meaning sticks us much easily, also gets cells faster easier does.

Yes “viruses become weaker time” common theory epidemiologists agree. end day, it’s still theory. delta still highly transmissible, adds. ""It's probably contagious respiratory virus know, moment."" Yes, can. That’s exactly arrived chickenpox 10.

Yes people become adults, agency responsible growth/learning life, lack thereof. don’t doubt hospital situation completely screwed right find comment evidence it’s slowing down.

According [this evidence rate new cases slowing down, peaked 9 days ago. One would hope *should* start translating fewer hospitalizations soon. 

Of course Alabama schools opening week next whole thing could skyrocket again. Damn, hang there! can’t imagine scared must feel going grocery store even. safe!  Worst automoderator ever. drive around entire city, Murfreesboro Franklin everyday living. definitely case. mom 61 stroke died 5 days later ventilator. march 2021 Yep. kids person, masks, entire year last year. lots rural suburban places like that. actually switched schools year masks. want make sure assets go helping animals, create trust beneficiary disburses funds helping animal (and don’t want beneficiary person caring animal—negates whole purpose trust). can’t bequeath anything animal write leaves funds person intent use help animal, it’s safer create trust.

No vaccination doesn’t cause mutations. Sounds like susceptible anti-vax disinformation, would nothing vaccinating brother anyway. talk brothers doctor believe publicity seeker read online. [Nah, that's Lucky?? month Florida total shitshow gate exists world. Something like 80% global population unvaccinated? Nothing pandemic restricted nation's borders. drop bucket.

Unvaccinated Americans contribute spread Delta, they're likelier create super-charged Delta part world. must [over hundred fingers per then. I'm curious counties Nevada blue completely surrounded red lol that? true, Abbot’s also quite literally killing voting base thousands. say back normal, close been. “I’ve requests across desk. notified that. contact hospitals, I’m personally contact CEOs lot major hospitals.”

Of course he's contact CEOs....he cares money future large donors.

And course aware - Department Health makes requests. need aware, be. He's pure garbage ugly suit. I'd wait approved. think there's enough information possible effects third shot right now.  happened? French citizens required receive malaria prophylaxis traveling South Africa. mobs protest that? supposed keep vaccinated person symptoms? Thats sold last 6 months.   virus far likelier mutate highly populated, undeveloped country one like US. That's science. fair, I'm sure there's direct correlation unvaccinated, people engage reckless behavior catch covid.

That said, yes, vaccine effective. Oh 1040EZ, pulling anything IRS. auto-audited simple. time read W-2 transcribed wrong amount withholding, resulting refund lower been. IRS corrected it, also sent right refund. see, IRS gets copy ever file.

Here's another little thing, owe money, file whenever want. There's penalty late return unless owe money. Since always overpay, there's never chance getting penalized. Even living parents, I'd S-0 take extra $10 week avoid hassle. course I'd get back end year despite parents claiming dependent. work one job, second job S-0 make sure underpaying. employer makes quarterlies really 1099'd paying quarterly payments late, get penalized. know that?

The Iranian leadership staunchly using[any vaccines Americans British part reason they're pickle. Thank you! Best luck :) We're getting close herd immunity areas world, there's many pro-virus people get us way heard immunity. sad, we've demonstrated remarkable capability within year identifying newly emergent virus mass-vaccination campaign well underway. But, bizarre reasons, can't get enough people vaccinated. Appreciate info. best keep distance airport. Hopefully situation like that.

If recommendations food things I'd love it! First time going islands. Source? Surprisingly actually vaccinated others taking many precautions. virus sentient Fascinating. one expect third dose then? When/if become available?

And also, went cvs got Pfizer shot “booster”. I’ll wait it’s authorized curious. haha maybe southern states would get shots gov't said ""after next monday, doses shipped africa india"" LOL remember sadly still extreme upwards trajectory. School started yesterday. asymptomatic transmission baked r0? burden make clear.

Fair enough. Although would say others rather quick issue judgement position. let’s go backwards here. I’ve misjudged intentions, apologize. 

Accepted. I’m glad least arrived point understand coming from. truly believe vaccine mandate, continue assert little concern private health information, 

I care both. want best everyone. get vaccinated get vaccinated. small number people CANNOT get vaccinated, least, deserve privacy sympathy. bring back full circle, protect cannot get vaccinated, everyone else profession mandated get vaccinated. everybody would vaccinated except former teachers, would **no legitimate reason schools discuss private health information, including vaccination status, former teachers.**

No disagreement here, think said still applies even still employed depending strength mandate. want show support teachers longer able teach school due inability comply mandate, write glowing letters reference continue advocate implementation public health measures vaccines masks, (hopefully) eventually reach herd immunity, giving reason optimism vulnerable people unable receive vaccine medical reasons, well everyone else

Full agreement here. mom (65 controlled hypertension stage 3A kidney disease) got J&amp;J last month seeing negative stuff making anxious, still well protected right? third dose (had CoronaVac April) meant booster could travel EU. fair enough thought rarer....10-25% huge. Florida don’t like big govt even they’re trying prevent deaths Don’t forget Gulfeans. finally push reform system prioritize essential education, districts teach critical race theory. Doubtful, booked 2 cars months ago I've done can. Moderna sequence reverse engineered Stanford University researchers, would seem casting misinformation.  expensive treatment. won’t highly available people.

If type tax funded healthcare universally available I'm hoping extensive testing vaccines break spread well, unfortunately seeing time might play differently I'm seeing Covid positives popping across country. 🤣🤣🤣 Agreed!!!! Change pdf regarding test results.

Yellow Vaccine booklets easily faked vaccine batch number etc. recorded centralized register. Therefore rhe pharmacist cannot tell real fake. Yes need get vaccine. Several studies show provides greater immunity reinfection. explanation isn’t desantis worried base killed covid? time ends, who’s going alive vote him? reading long COVID teens day. seem limited adults means. personally know people mid 20s suffering long COVID symptoms. 

Perhaps immune naivety perhaps virus unique ability cause chronic issues. point science still murky don’t really know. likely won’t even able really say yet given knew virus is. don’t blame people one bit exercising greater caution regarding colds flu.

One month ago 25 people hospitalized. Tuesday [yesterday], know majority, vast majority, 75% folks seeing hospital makes lot sense. Amazing. riders. True, meant voter's demographic, Trump's personal demographic. I'll fix that, thanks! Well, fuck it, use data set see beneficial 3rd shot is. Go ask people. Pay time even blood samples whatever. Even optic side things. Federal Government look bad world stage letting people die prevented. doesn’t info vaccinated vs unvaccinated rates. know moment. think need distance first. well controlled relationship alcohol COVID, might need reset, again, could deluding myself. I'd *like* get back couple drinks special occasion, might slippery slope. 

I'm much better spot mentally emotionally things opened up, there's really good chance fit category ""COVID alcoholics"" I'm sure well studied coming years. question whether us fell trap go back way we're gonna label ""recovering alcoholics"" forever. vacation plans Maui March 2020 canceled rebooked September 2021 thinking we’d clear then. way tell it’s going get crazy 2020, worried. whole vacation group vaccinated willing mask whatever takes. would pretty devastating cancel *again*. Per governor’s report 1-2% spread attributed visitors. Mostly spreading among unvaccinated locals. friends went lolapalooza group 10 ppl 4 days. stayed together house. 2 vaccinated, guess got covid. 2 Unvaxxed ppl. friends j&amp;j. Yep, vaccinated allowed endager others 😂😂😂 He's Ivy Leaguer. Unless 0.01%er family history schools, need smart enough score top class workaholic. helps Extrovert well, types extracurriculars get well evaluated social Ivy League schools skew Exxx.

But smart people absolutely play dumb, find useful so. hear ""Covid disappear election"" talking point much days Alabama.  confirm bad place. critics telling business unfriendly EU Novavax want make deal it? Got virus 2019. Ear vestibular system completely fucked. Dying certainly worse outcome virus. Like slight headache woozy maybe, wasn’t bad Nah, everyone can't contribute capitalists deem ""enough"" dead crippled. lot people submit ID's insurance info getting 3rd shot.

Which filter statistically well, fair.  probably clickbaity title mention age vaccination distinction.

These headlines exactly designed get correct information front people condensed form, much meant get heartrate jump bit. Yep, rapid/lateral flow/antigen tests. Buying supermarked testing incredibly cheap, less 1€ per test. social activities, already mentioned, need done buy certified test center, costs money, paid taxpayer money now. lot ""test centers"" opened recently easy way get money state. understand people argue payer taxes soon justified anymore.

Sometimes might good reasons get tested despite vaccinated (e.g. show symptoms visit risk-persons), I'd likely buy supermarked test PCR test fast enough. Ah, see now. Thanks clarifying right. Tests free required. According statista, 349 since Jan 2020 Europe open fairly easy now. haven’t heard much Asia re-opening all, hopefully soon. think there's public information dosages chosen trials began. would bet coordinated effort behind scenes one go high one go low maximize probability successful vaccine. high side effects intolerable, low effective enough. Turned worked. think applies entire demographic. 

By mean Trump? rich people (including trump) overwhelmingly vaccinated. 

Voter base supporters might better term. suggest  way. I'm young good immune system + vaccine. I'll leave boosters elderly immnodeficient ( transplants, certain kinds cancers,etc...). doesnt; Zachery disease. Thanks info ^^....fuck supply rest world. Everybody needs vaccinated prevent variants. might need couple rounds vaccinations. 4 billion (yes billion) vaccinations happened that’s little half world population. 

That said. I’m higher risk months six months Pfizer doses. probably push doc Moderna booster fall. Kicking saves lives. Oregon run hospital beds, year taking patients states. beds full, people need die instead. 

So yeah, kick can. saves bunch lives. well, lack tamiflu, son got medicine supposed “just get it”. better within 48 hours (with minor sniffles left over) sick another 6 weeks. knows damage caused. 

Glad bounced back eventually, tough time. That’s I’m trying avoid getting covid costs, never know body. like chicken pox = could turn shingles. Wonder covid might turn future. ""Herd immunity"" mean eradication/""zero COVID"". means enough people susceptible virus large outbreaks. I'm currently positive COVID, passed need get vaccine? think would need would anti-bodies. Also previous positive test anti-bodies qualify covid passport etc I've heard used instead evidence vaccine? Florida clearly WINNING! wish reporting virus put lot effort hammering words like ""mild"" ""moderate"" referring to. lot people think ""mild"" means sniffles ""moderate"" case flu-like symptoms miss work, ""mild"" really used refer anything put hospital. wonder tons people think virus nothing people hear things like ""most cases mild"" everyone's coming definitions. mean... I'm parent three tell young children crowded school and/or daycare setting actually get sick constantly years immune systems maturing. I've seasons pediatrician every week two stretch three kids kept bringing home sharing new respiratory bugs kept needing swabbed strep/flu, rule ear infections/bronchiolitis etc. Schools run local governments overseen state governments. federal government jurisdiction mandate vaccines teachers. Ah makes sense. Thanks clarification. Yup vaccines already earmarked US based pre existing deals, that’s kind “starving kids Africa, finish food” argument. Prob can’t answered models showing america end vax? see uk 75%, super jealous. Maybe 65 70 best hope us? Seems like vaccinations much good vaccines always hot debate? moved America needed proof doctor MMR shot Tetanus 

Does mean covid anti-vaxxers even vaccinations? Covid spreads better indoors. outside hot FL right people tend gather indoors. I’m north it’s almost always super comfortable outside almost gatherings I’ve outside. everyone wants dine outside. tried give 2 upvotes, tried more. couple hundred documented cases reinfection state yeah it’s pretty rare. talking like .5% vs 1% people here. Wild deer: animals NYC sewage: DeSantis dripping blood aren’t wearing even mask mandates. Hawaii cases since start pandemic. They’re gonna follow rules either way Getting vaccine kids full FDA approval last major hurdles. that, pandemic won’t majority people likely move endemic mentality need find balance living lives avoiding Covid.

Barring variant increased lethality complete vaccine resistance showing up, states actually restrictions likely won’t implement much going forward beyond mask mandates whenever there’s spike cases. Unfortunately Safety Theater.

The proper thing would close indoor dining people got elections win, threw ""safety"" indoor dinning reopened Actually 9 shots 18 holes. Kim good. Got back March, still tinnitus left ear, unpleasant. saves sanity kinda focus silence right ear night try tune left ear buzzing noise. Stay safe people familiar history Germany? School reopenings bring higher reproductive rate, seen steady growth single spike two weeks. ask people figure arguments you? counter-position isn’t strong enough, maybe shouldn’t blindly arguing 

Anyways, she’s right anyways, based age 99%+ chance fine. She’s looking individualist approach, crap “do people” useless. talk long covid, even that’s flushed people think is. 

You could leave alone. Idk that’s idea understand point requiring customers wear masks restaurants states US? People spend time restaurants eating certainly without masks. spread virus always spread anyway. never seen requirements UK: rule indoor dining restrictions. giant foam “we’re number one” finger.

WINNING!  title misleading though, since tests free vaccinated people well. They're required certain public places. every country co-pays. can't believe 20 years since started airing. need timeline compare effectiveness. 8 months post vaccine probably see similar results previous infection. parents school-aged children US, 63% said child's school require unvaccinated students staff wear masks, according poll. 36% parents said schools mask requirement unvaccinated.

Schools require *everyone* wear mask, regardless vaccination status. environment lot people gathering together prolonged period time. Vaccines mostly protect person receives mean can't carry virus spread others. time takes vaccinated person beat virus might shorter may show symptoms. vaccinated unvaccinated kids staff schools wearing mask.

With delta variant going around, best thing (if want open schools) mask mandate everyone. voters voted this. That’s “they”. 

Unfortunately, “they” dragging stupidity. Wish different. Wish didn’t deal consequences actions fraction state, that’s system works. striking thing increase families coming positive, one patient parents positive, siblings positive,” said Memorial Healthcare System nurse manager Anthony Sanders.

These kind parents - likely unvaccinated - rest community required show deference name ""personal responsibility."" Oh, real? Sorry, knew that. Thanks update! Anecdotally, that's we're seeing organization re: healthcare worker breakthrough. large proportion us, included, first Pfizer doses within week EUA. Correct. Risking child’s life also adding possibility mutations variants. happens **ignorants FLUSantis, DingoAbbot straight evil QRandPaul** dictate health policies instead listening epidemiologist experts. end pandemic basically vaccinate many people possible less hospitalizations/deaths thanks immunity vaccines natural immunity? seems like reasonable goal many people, employers, schools focused cases catching Covid 

Just seems like point transition think virus. coverage truly everything Covid negative like it’s 2020 feels like went back time unions work. employers mandate something workplace, negotiated first unions. [FLORIDA PEDIATRIC PROBLEM: 97 Children Admitted COVID go bocanewsnow.com cruise articles see daily amount children admitted hospitals steadily increasing.  university? literally care about. people never want runny nose vaccinated living fantasyland giving anti-vaxxers fuel fire.

Vaccinated people significant chunk positives cases. 12 hospitalized cases, one fully vaccinated. Something like 99.8% serious cases currently among unvaccinated. vaccine makes severe cases exceedingly rare basically, statistical perspective, free serious complications covid. paper no, companies don’t want work avoid running afoul sanctions, effect, yes. signals Israel extremely positive already. BTW vaccine full FDA approval doctor could prescribe label. want keep top also don’t want freaked out. Telling current numbers helpful know previous numbers. article doesn’t give context extent increase. science shows boosters greatly increase antibody levels waned five months vaccinated? agree! know that. large majority unvacccinated people age contract COVID severe case either. 

I get enthusiastic vaccines, using single case statistical conclusions dumb. Statistics based single cases. objections (allegedly) delivery mechanism rather antigen payload, that's also based misinformation mRNA works (which I've tried explain elsewhere). case, pandemic really shown little people know biology.  agree that, scientific fact shows 1 shot+ past Covid effective Delta full 2 dose regimen. 


We known time, though, best practice then.

That's science works. get new info, things change. true, also questionable policy also favours wealthy think actually shows vaccines work. people vaccinated hospitalizations continue rise percentage wise fully vaccinated. 59% NJ residents fully vaxxed 3% hospitalizations full vaxxed means vaccines 98% effective preventing hospitalizations, pretty good! Gotcha, yeah, really feel parents right now. We're sending kids school without vaccinated cases, states even blocking things like mask mandates. horrifying honestly. :( would teachers union consulted public health policy though? Please help talking point sister: main argument vaccine “why would get vaccine 99% chance surviving”? Jesus, people need log get doom fantasies chart giving palpitations outright told friend, heart condition, go get booster. opposed jumping line earlier pandemic, overabundance vaccines booster could potentially make huge difference, I'm fine people getting unauthorized booster.  rate growth slowing still positive, number hospital beds required still going growing slower rate.

Everyone wants push idea delta growth slowing high infection rates population immunity, seem evidence this. England Scotland delta growth went negative school year ended, positive social gathering limitations dropped. US news-media constantly pushing careful cannot help drop reproductive rates. actual number people tested positive died surges absurdly low, unlikely measurable effect population immunity.

Of course mitigation, let lot people catch COVID pretty steadily summer, keep level hospital collapse. Trust him, he's certified (from himself) eye doctor. /s deadly enough would’ve approved long time ago. weigh risk/reward earlier usual approval. risk earlier approval unforeseen side effects public outrage due “reckless.” risk taking time overly cautious people dying actual virus meantime. case they’ve concluded former bigger risk, rightly wrongly. Okay, gotcha. ""blame Mexicans"" narrative became worse people geographically ignorant, racists think 'brown people' look same. cares it’s body. want get covid w/o vaccine stop them. Can’t believe downvotes throw kids school right none vaccinated creating perfect storm virus evolve baby killer. expensive treatment. won’t highly available people. **FOLLOW SCIENCE!**

Or, best all, follow path least resistance, swallow ignorance, roll sleeve get vaccinated.  mean, Greek governments past 20 years ones making rules understand healthy degree skepticism... times since infection/vaccine  infection + 1mRNA better 2nRNA

This research comparing previous infection vs vaccination *only* looks people previously infected. comparing:

About fucking time.  Brutal democratic primary, lack enthusiasm Andrew Gillum campaigned like copy paste Obama. Add election Florida Governor held years Presidential vote, democrats vote smaller rates year elections. 

Oh Desantis ran Trump JR. republicans bought hook like sinker. It’s callous system help recover factors beyond control. hear now: kids lost years school, bad, pick bootstraps. US failed state countries sure programs would place aid recovery Us

I worked kids whose parents literate. heck supposed help kids can’t go school miss two years consistent education? Idk man. That’s messed up. younger one wasn’t 14 months younger 20 pounds heavier 2 inches taller one get vaccinated, I’d take consideration. I’m trying get 6yo vaxxed. kid missed arbitrary cutoff. guess, I'd say peak shortly universities start ...and 40,000 graves. doubt argument going change much. Immunocompromised people always going around, next round vaccine approvals going 0-up, it'll like 6-12. highest vaccine hesitancy US far white conservatives. Say truth. Yes, going ask brother. think virus real (not) deadly. age myself. country lethality rate 0.03% want back normal life without requirements. It’s really way though. It’s really strong mitigation  I’ll don’t need random internet tell do, obviously know people reddit aren’t qualified give health advice, I’m looking experiences people booster make decision own. Worry self righteous dipshit.  Thank thinking pet. Good pet parent good human getting vaccinated. Best luck getting this. Make feel safe possible talking them. deniers, denial defense mechanism. they're defending vary heavily person-to-person, one thing *might* get open real issues make feel safe, validated, seen, heard. painful even humiliating, might say like, ""I see would hard trust Fauci perspective"" even though (possibly) think Fauci good source. last thing want -- probably already done -- argue fight them. confirms suspicion they're safe, go defenses. make feel safe, they'll allow vulnerable, get interesting insight what's going head. treat insight care, refrain using instead going *with* difficult emotions, might get budge little. scariest part, though, done correctly, often find budging along them, hard know direction go in.

This process faint heart many cases simply fail person interest vulnerability. times I've ever successfully changed mind something like this, process. So... he's either liar incompetent. 

I'm smelling intense amount manure coming gov's office. I'm f'ing happy took vacation last week June.  Oh no, no, no, no. plenty people genuinely seriously attitude cannot allow *any* child get seriously ill die COVID. would think people would realize accept simple reality kids get sick die matter measures take — you’d wrong. peeking? look Florida can't see peak right now... Folks say ""well get $100 proactive getting early?"" 

Sure seem fair that's irrelevant, people get shots helps everyone. Similar programs already worked places. good idea knock people one side fence.   wouldn’t eradicated then? you’re saying would handful cases. You’re place you’re saying, every comment slightly different claim. Yeah don’t know…could be. speculation without controlled study though. insurance companies deny charge higher premiums non vaccinated individuals? 

(minus kids obv) Absolutely ridiculous. vaccine virus. Stuff like really illuminating even pro vaccine people actually feel it. thing serious enough threat humanity warrant permanent masking. Masking also reduces risk infection delta.

Get kn94 95 mask. don’t vacuum seal face working out. It’s flu guys get vaccines extremely effective, show card get in, still wear mask…. That’s insane - what’s point showing card then?

The vaccines work, boosters soon, children vaccinated soon, Covid always us. everyone ever vaccinated 

Getting vaccine gets country back normal. includes ending mask mandates hospitalizations deaths die down

Plus like see people’s faces able normal interactions others I'm NJ vaccines site-dependent. wife went Holy Name gave everyone Pfizer went Bergen New Bridge got Moderna. Recent data shows ok. opposed to? dosage  Alabama’s state constitution massive. wouldn’t surprise somewhere. Lol natural end lockdowns

The lockdowns ended. still lockdown? surprised large chunk anti Vax people think ""oh gotten covid yet bother getting vaccine there's point""

Then go hospital feel like big dummies. Shit anti-maskers seem forget: Even virus particularly deadly dangerous kids, still spreads incredibly easily among kids adults... importantly: Kids can't take care themselves. 

Parents need take time work stay home kids, care them, CDC even recommends come plan preventing spread within house / outside... 

So something like one parent deals sick kid parent deals healthy kids, careful use kitchen different times, increase ventilation house, wear masks home except eating sleeping, etc. observing carefully make sure child one ones hospitalized dies... oh yeah, even sick enough hospitalized could still incredibly ill home. *oh yeah*, hoping there's long-term health effects, accidentally give someone health concerns inside family, heavily socially distancing outside home constantly masked prevent accidental spread. parents get - even ""mild case"" still sleeping half day vividly hallucinating half day... sound like fucking fun you? 

No? that's goddamn motherfucking need mask mandates schools numbers still much rise. study question US. Yeah that’s true. act like hospital natural
Resource. People human. comparing spread 50% vaccinated 100. 100% would handful cases year, caused travel countries, manageable level like past. What’s point mandating vaccines go places you’re still going always wear mask. vaccines get us back normal - Covid always going us  lambda! /s little worried I’ll need prove I’m immunocompromised

This! Something tells we'll need ""doctor's note"" rheumatologist PCP something, annoying. I'd rather walk CVS instead set appointment doctor get permission. good luck something really kill requires complex diagnostic process ongoing care.

Many patients US face exactly same, unfortunately. Sign big butt  Yeah. So, like said, people refuse vaccine without medical reason insurance coverage denied get covid.  lost?  barely prove last time tbh i'm worried haha Ya, good guy great boss conspiracy theory stuff got really old really fast. like system exists paper never ever put test.

I admire confidence, doubts. Contact tracing works long case count low far gotten pretty easily overwhelmed. I'm two minds give aways. First got vaccination without need feel kind unfair people got vaccinations right reason get chance kind perks. flip side whatever works get people get vaccinations. can't ""win"" anything terms material prizes certainly win long run terms world going back normal. Read this:
Why Second Wave 1918 Flu Pandemic People don’t get it. We’re seeing considerably less Covid 19 hospitalizations deaths vaccinated people we’d expect see general public flu. vaccine fucking works. idea go need weekly basis asked maybe twice like 25-30 times. go get pfizer moderna somewhere lie j&amp;j shot Copying vaccine card felony Great, scared ducks Texas. Unfortunately you’re never gonna legit dialogue people. observation see talking points shift within sub since 2020. You’re making mistake reasoning conversation person, that’s point coming from. want compliance, opinion, reasoning, sense. mean guy quoted saying “just wear damn thing”. statement coming place forcing control someone. Yeah, that's full Q worldview never made sense tried rationally think could implemented can't release information permission patient, course.

For example, airline companies require sorts medical tests pilots years. 

As condition working, pilot must release medical results. don't, can't keep working..

And good thing. one wants epileptic pilot!

Remember, antivaxxers use HIPAA excuse claim lie medical status impunity. lie. got tested day due days fatigue soreness neck like slept wrong taco'd pillow. already feel much better got results back positive test Well, he's blunt. actually says FB posted got initial post deleted. think people know exactly he's pushing. really added addendum adds 15 people answer back 'what people can't take vaccine medical reasons' got screwed either way it. ""Likely increasing cases"" mean Rt still **slowing down**. Floridas Rt since middle July, easy see spike/increase cases cases lag behind time person infected, becomes sick, reports case, becomes hospitalized, etc. 

The patterns seeing (if many suggesting Rt **highest** middle/end July, data points case) would make sense seeing rapid spike.

I live one states listed ""stable"" chart (NY) Rt also [decreasing since middle July. suggestion ""hasn't spread us yet"" really make sense *aren't* taking vaccination rates consideration. state like Florida sadly horrific state vax rates are/were low, whereas state like NY thwart worst we're going hit 70% (adult) vax rate next week, objectively high.

If click literally state see decrease Rt since mid July little later. Remember Missouri news last week? [Their one lowest country. August still going hard month epidemic widespread hospitals enough resources deal patients need care, looking likely we're seeing worst terms powerful delta hit un/under-vaccinated states. Anything MRNA vaccines 40-60% efficacy rate variants. Sinovac J&amp;J roughly efficacy rates. know that's what's discussed. Stop silly. Sure, agreed, still answer pays weekly tests. importantly, employer *required to* pay them, require employee pay them? American football hardly football.. call soccer give rest world back ""football"" County Judges Texas head executive officer within county. rename county head executive basically got right idea. interpreted South Dakota first thought, chance lol lived Austin. also consider city surrounded rural counties poor vaccination rates. may someone Bastrop occupy Austin ICU bed. issue solely Travis County itself, rather surrounding counties taxing system. media explaining fact well. agree antivaxxers draining hospital resources personnel, providing added context. ONS, collates 1 January 31 August 2020, 52,327 deaths England Wales involved COVID-19. these, 48,168 deaths due COVID-19: is, COVID-19 underlying cause. 12.4% deaths period (389,835 deaths). period 69,781 deaths involved pneumonia 506 deaths involved influenza: these, 13,619 394 deaths due pneumonia influenza respectively (3.5% 0.1% deaths).

69 781 deaths included pneumonia. 
506 included influenza

So, see, clearly, deaths caused ""influenza pneumonia"" includes deaths involve flu. 

In fact, vast majority include flu. Yes good parallel anorexia! ""Mild"" mild clinical sense, layman's sense Same! couldn’t find anything really hope bar owners across country this. definitely would make would far inclined go place knew checking vaccination/test status. absolutely correct assessment. Case counts alpha every non-delta lineage still dropping. knew delta late may, nobody paying attention yet. 

If we're delta we'd 1-5k daily US cases now. wondering thing  Imagine almost half **Germans** didn’t want hope unvaccinated **German** few, apathetic, EDIT: guys think I’m talking Germans, you’re mistaken.

?? Pretend exist next election cycle waiting rest country eradicate you, somehow. Oh, keep insisting social media everything okay.  Ok, old boss thought covid 100% fake, deaths things like gunshots etc, hospitals told count every death covid matter happened. person run car counted covid death etc etc etc. 

He really truly believed Biden covid gone month, would hyped much, would 100% wiped face earth. already myself, point feel hunger anymore become stable mood productivity. impressive see that. start feel euphoria although remains mild, like peaceful good mood today, super excited mood. never went beyond 30h fasting, guess euphoria gets pretty strong 48h given collaborators told me. try successful I’m confused you’re using “slow transmission it’s longer concern” “eradicate” almost interchangeably — they’re thing. agree vaccines would help us get spread manageable level; we’ve already seen direct evidence earlier year US, daily cases ~10K. still, 10K cases day nowhere near eradication.  guess back guy up, womens soccer team offered contract mens team turned down. theyre arms would made money  taking extent vax exclusive places still requires masking excessive. antivaxxers problem here? school 3? son goes LV Day School start 23? Yeah, comment section anything deadline related straight cancer. unless there’s emerging scientific evidence supporting it. Pro-vid Government Sliding Scale:

- Cases low: Covid myth

- Uptick cases: Illegal immigrants bringing covid pristine white communities.

- Outbreak: Blame federal government obstructing it. 35 yo pregnant female. Slightly sore arm. Nothing write home about. Second shot easier first shot. feel like “fights” wrong word. like lay play dead. Agree this. I’m server pretty busy resturant LA area staff aren’t really allowed enforce current mask mandate ￼￼￼without fear repercussions upper management since care bottom line.

I can’t even imagine shit show management customers vaccine checks allowing people dine inside (though think it’s great idea). Also considering 75% income service staff tip based. Forcing unvaccinated person dine outside would likely cause huge loss income night might go next Resturant won’t check blame server denying inside service.

Without incentive Resturant industry ￼to enforce mandate it’s going ignored 80% restaurants. I'm sorry wife, Amtrak allows employees either get vaccinated, free, weekly tests.

Why allow unvaccinated employees baffles me. Probably Pfizer name already familiar with. funny vaccine actually designed BioNTech, company nobody really heard before. LNP formulations different, theoretically Moderna felt like needed higher dose -- LNPs seemed perform worse cell penetration, far recall reading. least Virginia, know state run website query personal vaccination information. central database expect every US state something equivalent. equal side effects though. People got Moderna rougher go average. I'd choose 3 easier doses 2 rough ones. need find balance eventually. Since unvaccinated wear ignorance badge honor probably isn’t good idea. bar completely unless legitimate medical reason. get whole bunch Pfizer front pay bill... Would take Chinese vaccine Russian one.

Though would prefer neither pretty happy double Modernaed up. Immortality baby

For computer copy anyway. get fourth shot (second Moderna)? getting data say means influenza pneumonia inclusive? 

I understand write flu pneumonia death certificates, mean data quoting means that? can't find anything indicate total influenza pneumonia forms pneumonia. 

Most influenza deaths due pneumonia, pneumonia deaths due influenza. Although yes people often get viral pneumonia secondary bacterial pneumonia   That's vaccines work dude, eventually slow transmission much entire diseases longer concern. 

COVID vaccines effective enough eradicate COVID everyone took damn shot. little worried I’ll need prove I’m immunocompromised, hopefully get instructions Thursday.  True ‘dat. wonder someone like who's fully vaxxed Pfizer get Moderna booster later on? like mix &amp; match? I’m single parent child small apartment. Luckily able stay home homeschool, feel sad always social butterfly one person. video chats friends sometimes, online classes video, neither us wait finally vaccinated.

Early on, April last year, pretty much entire Jersey City police department caught covid once. Community spread? Nope, one officer who’d returned Florida. Fucking lunacy. I'm fed this.

The article provides evidence known phenomenon. phenomenon possible past vaccination campaigns, including polio, smallpox, measles, pertussis, rubella, mumps. phenomenon stood way effectively vaccinating entire countries diseases, achieving herd immunity. phenomenon known manageable, existence dissuade us pursuing vaccination efforts.

It also interesting note recent research, relative coronavirus pandemic. around six years old, likely something someone dug Google recently, misunderstood enough details came away thinking “vaccines = terrifying superbugs”. Thanks! Nah got today!! get second pfizer shot 31st. Thanks support. 40k deaths since begging pandemic? think federal government plenty ventilators now. issue enough medical staff support patients. Oh burn... ""Don't reply"".... nice governor Texas' Florida's make vaccinations mandatory that's end it.  sounds good paper, compatible realities US public school system. classrooms extremely crowded, schools short teachers, since large numbers retired moved careers last 18 months. infrastructure commonly ancient, may up-to-date HVAC systems even windows open. Janitorial staff threadbare, cleaning classrooms minimal.

There definitely magic extra classrooms extra staff achieve kind social distancing, budgets big infrastructure improvements thanks many decades tax cuts issues. idea someone going teach curriculum packed classroom 40 students time enforcing mask social distancing rules constantly monitoring air quality pretty unlikely.

I'm bagging ideas principle, talk school teacher administrator likely happen anytime soon. Sorry mate wish like that. ultra doomsday Christian conservatives. Ok well next time think twice saying “nobody ever said vaccines keep getting Covid” that’s exactly president said two weeks ago.

The percentage drops age, even 20-29 group 72% vaccinated. exactly majority? 60%? Asking don’t know. Yep, I'm expecting correction. Buck up, we’ll 71% adults fully vaxed 3 4 weeks so.  incorrect. Original guest list 700 people, scaled back list last weeks. 200 guests. Using kids political pawns. scary part base loves behavior. School also started today. Wow, almost like Florida responsible first wave virus. Pathetic.  That’s infection rate highest since pandemic started. feel like pandemic depression whatever want call worse ever never thought would case post vaccination. hope feeling positive May-June go shit really hard.

He re-elected due state's politics, care. Putting people re-election attempt  Trial participant give got vaccinated valid medical reason couldn’t! Hmm I’ve wondering breakthrough cases infected past double vaxxed. parents situation, even though still careful, it’s still scary thought, getting sick again. Luckily hospitalization rates extremely low fatalities almost zero. thought I'd read 28k today  Right Israel, 350-400 seriously ill people. Majority vaccinated. Officials talking locking next month (third dose campaign proceeding fast hope avoided). 

My point still seeing exponential growth serious cases deaths shouldnt happening \~90% adult population vaccinated. Look post history. mess. It’s shocking many parents don’t care. local school board mandated masks fall many parents furious it. IIRC, FDA requested trials expanded include twice many participants originally planned, mainly detect frequency myocarditis happening adolescent/young males, see happening frequently younger kids.

It's necessarily 3 times longer; would depend recruitment (and would surprised hard time recruiting families this, may hard organizationally monitor many people). recruitment jabs, myocarditis seemed happen fairly quickly, within couple weeks.

In case, Pfizer's planned initial release data later September, least long. ""The adjusted weekend counts show 21,487 new cases Saturday 19,584 Sunday.""

Anyone know happened Saturday's Sunday's numbers?

Just yesterday, Saturday's Sunday's numbers listed 28,000. know Florida said numbers wrong, time see mention wrong actual numbers even are.

So...what actual numbers Saturday Sunday? numbers yesterday wrong, anyone know could *that wrong?* that's exactly small difference, there's BIG difference numbers like 19,000 28,000. click link:

""In states data available, less 2% child COVID-19 cases required hospitalization 0.00% 0.03% fatal.""

No, isn't. sure without knowing live absolutely nowhere sufficient vaccination coverage called ""decently vaccinated"". discuss whether vaccination failed strategy someone actually tries it. People want regardless motorcycle rally. mean shit grand scheme things. According CDC, thus far 7,107 vaccinated people hospitalized (of 1,816 asymptomatic / hospitalized Covid) 1,507 died (316 asymptomatic / related Covid, I’m guessing non related hospitalizations deaths things like accidents whatnot). 

Also according CDC, flu annually results anywhere 140,000-810,000 hospitalizations 12,000-61,000 deaths. data available *thus far*, seems like Covid less dangerous amongst vaccinated people flu. Oh HUMANITY!   Arizona That’s I’m wondering too. two weeks timeline certainly OG, seems things rising much faster.  Get glucose checked make sure diabetes. hows number tests relevant size country? Everytime there's outbreak batch testing used everyone cases isolated, stops never ending cycle cat mouse extremly resource efficient clinical trails sub 12yo happening right discover effective dosage mitigate side effects. label usage pharmaceuticals comes still understanding dosage discovered trials.

This horseshit. reason many kids getting schools back session currently least restrictions motivation take precautions covid we’ve since pandemic started. allowed deny treatment people voluntarily smoked lives got cancer it? people keep eating junk even though alresdy obese? drug users? 

Listen, I'm angry anti vax people next guy, comment absolutely crazy. Hospitals never deny treatment people. “I don’t want stick chemical still get Covid stuck.” 

He thinks MRNA chemical? Geez, it’s part we’re made of.   winnin lots lounge olympics bet evidence” saying something false

I never meant suggest did. responded someone said SIL’s OBGyn told effects vaccine fertility unknown couldn’t wholeheartedly endorse it, causing SIL decline vaccinated.

My response meant convey least one study found evidence concern related fertility/pregnancy *with regard vaccine*, meta-analysis found quite opposite effect (at least respect pregnancy) *for women infected Covid,* suggesting may wise women contemplating pregnancy get vaccinated. 

Perhaps SIL seek second opinion since don’t presume comments taken medical advice someone explain efficacy preventing severe disease percentage means? example, vaccine 93% effective preventing severe disease, mean vaxxed unvaxxed person get infected, vaxxed person 93% less likely get severe case? mean get severe case unvaccinated, vaccinated lowers chance 93%? I’m pretty confident mandates coming. Even three percent fatality, that’s almost 10 million 330 million Americans. mention aren’t able work become burden healthcare/social safety net. I'm afraid reverse tbh. anti-vax crowd way deranged vaccinated individual. God I'm starting like Macron  accountability. dont hold breath AFAIK put house sale, maybe he’s decided make official? Gov.

Wait two weeks Sturgis motorcycle rally ND. vote them, basically going give seat again. want send message, vote them. That's way change this. .4%   know people genuine fear needles, convey one actually hurts less than, dunno say, ripping band-aid? (Talking actual shot effects course). might hold court. mess Texas!  civilization downward swing.

Once upon time eradicated diseases even infectious this.

Now dont political willpower even defeat flu. collapsing empire feels like. Number children hospitalized covid highest it’s since pandemic started. Let sink in. words… sure hope :/ I’ve given hope 2021 normal. probably even first half 2022… Anecdotally, know people Tampa vaxxed got Delta last week. Neither hospitalized.

On plus side, 99.99% vaxxed people dont need hospitalized die. long covid still thing.

Wear N95 indoors crowded areas. Stay I-4 central FL (most deadly highway US) bad time go ER. Wash hands. OK. Congratulations, winner Best Titlegore Day  wish best.  DeSantis’ position right makes sense.  Wait till deaths really kick in.  Dude walls house ceiling cracking…


You better watch out, house may next collapse lol.


Honestly one big crack runs ceiling wall concerning… may present concrete exterior wall well… doesn’t look like crack thermal expansion alone. It’s pretty severe translates many substrates continuous.


You may want get Reddit find what’s happening there.


PS - I’m entirely offended Florida thing I’m here, moved escape New England, it’s great change. biggest land owners Florida made money telling land horrible farming. bought lot pennies dollar. Nobody wants swamp. 


Low behold little reforming water sheet flow via canals, land dries build places like Disney World, Miami Beach. “Those stupid farmers didn’t know had.”


You see beachfront property. sea level rise immediate issue, wouldn’t investment initiative waterfront; business existence long time, plan future. 


You always research, make sure things household taken care instead attacking others. said another poster, confusion here. situation described arguing against. original post first responded teacher REFUSING vaccine poster saying given full explanation teacher ISN’T vaccinated. arguing that, vaccine mandate, teacher vaccinated, probably medical reason vaccinated. don’t think TEACHER school disclose medical condition town parents see. point arguing. Viruses generally don’t evolve way. tend become less deadly time. local pharmacies check ages kids? Dr. Scott Gottlieb

“I don’t think Covid going epidemic fall winter. think final wave, final act, assuming don’t variant emerge pierces immunity offered prior infection least Governor trying day lose smell? capitalized? Nurse Jackie would capitalized Fr jesus Hey thats me. Florida mess right now. small workplace shut Thursday.  Around 8 people tested positive 80 us. weren’t even fully open.  probably 50 given time  Masks 100% required 2 weeks ago. late seems. 

Our ownership strongly promoting vaccination month ago started making increasingly inconvenient remain unvaccinated.  still 20% folks refuse get shot getting really uncomfortable. 

I would surprised vaccines become condition employment soon.  Probably waiting full approval FDA. I’m probably going waste 11 doses tonight. It’s nonsensical argument lol think Pfizer said anticipating many kids would signing expanded trial meet original timeline. Usually it’s time consuming get people signed onto trial one!  ...what? kids congenital heart defects? Kids type 1 diabetes? Kids chemo? Kids cerebral palsy? Kids organ transplant? Ugh, it’s stressful baby right now. Barring new variants render vaccines/infection based immunity useless, approaching level endemic equilibrium.

Covid likely stick around least next years disease burden far less months/years ahead. part of... kinda... federal government thing, could, I'm sure... mandate? ... kindof things. completely understand wanting things normal. hospitals stop filled unvaccinated want things normal. actions vaccinated people still affect actions vaccinated (and non-vaccinated) people ways cause massive harm.

In addition love vaccine. experts agree matter when, variant bypasses vaccine. really rush make new variant occur unless really want go back complete lockdown even quicker.

It's like shut downs going completely prevent everything flatten curve. spiking curve now. going spike even more.


There options stupid. People right could completely supporting local bands outdoor safely socially distance, masked events vaccinated individuals only.

We need gather everyone one place herd stupidity. governors states create crisis gall dictate crisis protocol hospitals played part surges. governors mandated schools business enforce masks; said local “mask mandates” illegal; told people go business without masks; created surge Delta variant. Then, hospitals overwhelmed again, say “Oh, worries, hold elective stuff. Nothing see, folks. Move along now, y’all.”   You’ve seen “purple” voting maps. Everyone’s on-the-ground politics pretty much country mouse city mouse. State politics weird mess historic boundaries arbitrary demographic averages. 

If weren’t grandstanding governors wildly inappropriate powers vested state governments, would reason talk COVID state state basis. colleges open yet. imagine number people campus every single day? mention unauthorized gatherings parties. It'll hub transmission. survive 3 hour trip? enough helicopter flights available get less time? Can't wait vote cripple office. Roll ass Let deal own, want reopen. reopening, get crematories ready.  likely last wave we’re last pandemic, least US? mean, COVID eventually run hosts infect… right? children, did, too. Anything protect them.  disagree. teacher must vaccinated teach particular school, teachers school vaccinated, ergo absolutely reason parent inquire individual vaccination status. parent inquire anyway, response could ""you check protocol administration"" want to, reasons can't fathom, admit socially responsible. FYI many schools California started last week start week. think public schools mask mandates. much time data yet, see masks helping soon enough. come mask required children two?  send masks situation desantis institute mask mandate look population pyramid decade two bar two missing Florida.  whose also selling anti-Fauci shirts home. he, like Hutchinson, admit wrong??? completely agree last point!

Smallpox different. fatality rate least 30%, government involvement survival strategy. Corona looking 3%. huge difference. US, err side individual freedom protect costs. vaccine anyone wants it, next cohort kids approval soon, serious enough government mandate, even though sounds like good idea many us. Oh, sure! full immunity benefits yes, even weeks time benefit some. Thats fair question. personally issue people knowing I’m vaccinated. someone post said wouldn’t mind much. guess still possibility could lead parents demanding someone vaccinated teacher causing issues logistics answer question, problem people knowing I’m vaccinated.  “Because one said wouldn’t.”

You didn’t. HIPPA says wife can't share patients information. talk want. “Because one said wouldn’t.”

You didn’t. FL definitely mismanaged this, population density also contributing factor. populations similar, expect transmission dynamics similar density (of population governor). great day Canada, therefore world. Oh almost pregnant friend’s doctors told get till gave birth shocked. Actually hard tell. looks like mandate requires districts enforce refusing. stick carrot amounts advisory order. guess thinking last year school district determine open fall not, reading article immunity school districts power governor.

Im sure governor authority punish rebel districts hard tell cause 1) recall air 2) newsom intimidating governor anyway. case disease lot worse cure. Vaccines already tremendously safe covid many long term side effects vaccines never have. time caution 6 months ago, need action. We've adjust got kids dying takes month get immune shots... one coworker got vaccine found week pregnant one coworker wants vaccine gotten yet pregnant. think coworker pregnant going get vaccine soon delivers decided get still pregnant. honesty, asked decided get delivers. I’ll say it. can’t blame people scared frustrated new rounds mask mandates. Oregon implemented one zero exit strategy DC says earliest lifting Thanksgiving. get conditions change give people hope well. would still good immunity almost chance serious symptoms, wait make sure long term effects (that observed 1 year, might magically show 2 years). long term effects, would either see already see 10 years. vaccines totally safe measures have. Delaying full approval child access vaccines making covid way worse needs money's Quebec getting plant &amp; probably too. Keep mind people get vaccinated, higher number severely ill dead inevitably be. share categories go well. shouldn’t surprise. shit happened w delta India months ago. Nobody surprised. Note: ambulances aren’t waiting lines outside hospitals w/ vaccinated patients. vaccinated you’ve done part able enjoy life. Unfortunately thanks anti-vaxxers increasingly won’t case fall looking like return mask mandates least. Anyone vaccinated going music festivals judged though. Especially keep going cycle normalcy kind cases rise normalcy threatened. What. The. Fuck.

Ok, I'm out. Enough shit today. got done working local efficacy numbers FUCK LADY.

great, blood pressure spiking. Children hospitalized rates seen yet? Yeah. surge breakthrough infections.

It's unvaccinated people.

I attended 4 days Lollapalooza. I'm vaccinated, tested negative (PCR test) twice.

The vaccines work. I'm surprised parents would test kids, report positive result Yep basically summation. Upon googling looks like several countries already started mixing matching. Interesting stuff.  still around 20s century though. NE epidemic didn’t end 1620, first cholera pandemic didn’t end 1824. Hey. Thank you. day grandma got old drive refused wear seatbelt matter what-after many tickets eventually went far stitching small hook center console right next buckle could stretch seatbelt hook right next buckle-it looked like wearing cop pulled could click walking up.

I always asked her, she’s going trouble, doesn’t click in? She’d always respond rant seatbelts kill people save trapping car Wow. Meanwhile, today first day school district Texas already reports Covid-positive students told front office come school today else would withdrawn removed classes. came school. school thousands maskless students. Things get crazy. Yes clearly meant governor Kentucky. I’m atheist lord help us Since started topic. Ignoring medical conditions, lot issues might due stress trying hard etc. Often helps vacation, time relax, thinking work issues stressing trying conceive. Perhaps procedures helped relax? Live Houston lot people hate Greg Abbott lol Yeah, read (on sub) yesterday. Moderna showing better efficacy Delta Pfizer months. article insinuated boosters backed, encourage get Moderna. ppl died vaccination, ppl died last breathing. Georgia bad well. Kemp blaming Biden vaccination rates tried ban mask mandates couple times now. Also borderline refused lock opened soon could. Idk Georgia always flies radar stupid shit pull. Wasn’t La pretty well vaccinated? Got first shot Jan 5 Moderna, second shot 30 days later. read this, I’m actually wondering it’s something consider.  Genuine Question: people cancelling plans (concerts cancelled, people talking canceling vacations)? still many person events happening NYC. 

I thought get vaccinated, low chance contracting covid. thought realized covid would always around capacity. whats problem?

Am worried enough? missing here?  Scientific decisions need based facts. based ""are yet?"" principal. smaller social things safely (masked, outdoors, 100% vaccinated people, distancing, etc). deliberately creating super spreader events necessary. say someone who's job touring entertainer, who's dedicated life career take till CoVid. live entertainment situations worth it! someone can't live 300 attendance outdoor distanced, masked, concert local city park BONAROOO.. .Then they've lived incredibly privileged life.

The fact people make small sacrifices thought deserved special treatment 50% reason we're shit show we're  ask vaccinated say exactly. I'm sure approve this. 


However, 'think' I'd like see insurance companies fully covering hospitalizations due willful disregard getting vaccinated. 


These folks say choices freedom matters. agree. free - best - Darwin tens thousands dollars. interesting. dates 20s course seem pretty close every one hundred years.

Feels like little prepared let's say 2015 case?

The pandemic might end long time socially highly doubt businesses people country would take indefinitely. Employers mandating vaccines step right direction

Well never get 100% maybe real close people vaccinated, safer everyone sooner restrictions mandates end. 

Dr. Scott Gottlieb says Covid delta surge may ‘final wave’ U.S. school starting pretty bad numbers. Thanks! really optimistic Covid it’s way got pregnant. It’s hard feel guilty plus climate crisis. Parenting times little nuts. feel best protect family. family needs respect that, GTFO. According them, fine! googling info came across article I'm curious natural herd immunity thing. It'll kill lot people, looks like delta make happen. Well, thats odd considering Moderna testing boosters 50mcg (or half original dose size). full 100 prob effective, Pfizer 3rd shot (30mcg) would likely sufficient w/o causing heavier side effects. mentality going US. asshats wear mask, get vaccinated. live Texas, asshatgovenor proclaimed children school wear masks. makes sense, can't believe science denying morons reached political heights.

(Arizona nurse) point US history would politician still career refusing condemn foreign adversary putting bounties US soldiers. Instead, still revered. said previously, clear motivates persistence regarding concern teachers share private health information parents.

What motivates think it’s wrong. Go way back first post commented on. tone comment doesn’t sit well me. person thread talking (not there’s anything wrong that) remained steadfastly fixated upon throughout, 

I remain fixated people keep responding posts making assumptions false completely miss actually arguing for. See 2 core points well. relative exclusion points others (such myself) find salient, like public health pandemic.

I said multiple times agree mandating vaccines teachers. said done part gotten vaccinated. Certainly talk finer points potential decision right? believe agree points (although I’m precisely certain second point since seems worded bit wonkily). 

I want go back said fixated point privacy. We’ve going back forth night (at least am) don’t even disagree core points. We’ve talking past part. responding others thread probably boat chosen call names add insults. imagine frustration. seem disagree mandate means. operating assumption mandate means teacher vaccinated reason consequently unable teach within given entity, therefore seek employment elsewhere perhaps apply disability benefits (obviously different municipalities, counties, states could different, less restrictive mandates). would clearly legitimate reason school disclose parents anyone else former teacher’s vaccination status health information, school entity decides allow medical exemptions mandate, may leaving open liability subsequently shown exempted teacher source infection. far ADA concerned, believe legal requirement “reasonable accommodation”, may require teacher teach remotely, school may choose explain parents said teacher teaches remotely. 

Not much disagreement here. However strict mandates are, know least initially, small number teachers vaccinated. suppose, concern parents speculate reason. would unfortunate, outweighed, opinion, greater good.

I may sound like broken record point don’t disagree greater good. arguing small minority teachers, know everyone’s best interest vaccine mandate fully support that. want show little bit support people would negatively effected decision. thing add don’t think speculation strong enough word worried about.  BC Keep eye Leronlimab (Virologix). tested treat covid long haulers symptoms nearing completion one required clinical trials. Hopefully data show greatly improves long term symptoms far shown adverse effects. drug monoclonial antibody initially created treat HIV. Hopefully receive EUA data compiled presented FDA.

No. already realized America's worst enemy America instead trying stand America military might like USSR did, sow seed distrust instability population. one side political parties happy that, cold hard cash, order cling power. point vaccine skepticism vaccine itself, erosion faith Americans government norms politics.  Yeah. 40,000 recorded deaths. gonna take years get true figure 2020 - 2021? Covid deaths. still trying convince mom (53 years old) get shot. think she'll finally FDA approves. 

I honestly think put crack a(R)mor today asked name 1 single vaccine caused adverse long term effects 6 months usage. already told Trump, FDA expedited approval several vaccines used. Largely red tape cutting historically large volunteer group clinical studies. replied back know consequences 5 years now. asked name one vaccine unexpected long term adverse effect 6 month usage, received silence. Finally, convinced talk doctor. 

Case get lit fire area America 35% full vax rate another 2% (800 extra people roughly) recorded 1 shot.

Our case load already 83 people per 100k, county fair started Saturday. Sunday. crowded like rock concert saw exactly 2 Confederate flags saw people wearing masks. saw 2 Confederate flags vendor's stall see single mask. None. all. 35% vax rate here, imagine county fair mostly going people county here.  county fair probably biggest youth event year, gonna mix everyone together real good time school start next week.

JFC. Fear last year unknown. know testing available monitor it, tool fight it, instead watch trainwreck around me.

We rural car wreck sent 7 people hospital. 13 20 hospital beds full hospital county here, ICU. One border county hospital 3 ICU beds 10 left, different county 3 31 available, another county 8 13 available.

We 1 car wreck away running capacity, and.... mention fair week? shot first two boost immunity Delta least 5 fold. Likely Moderna since dose larger (100mcg vs 30mcg Pfizer we're seeing breakthrough cases w Pfizer recipients). Moderna developed variant specific boosters Beta Delta, unknown they'll significantly effective vs original formula. They're also testing half/half boosters (50mcg) half variant specific half original formula. 6month results soon. US's last purchas order allows ""upgrade"" variant specific boosters approved effective. 
 
Pfizer said they're working Delta specific booster word yet. They've trialed 3rd shot original (30mcg) found increases immunity Delta 5 fold. Israel started rolling 3rd shots older folk. Pfizer also lobied US gov't approve 3rd shots (original shot again) admin balked far....likely logistics messaging. Would confuse people, enrage antivaxers def want boosters would see profiteering, chance kids need shots. SARS-CoV2 infections don’t provide nearly immune response vaccines.  It’s bad news unvaccinated family too. combo unvaccinated parents sending kids school equals LOT orphans. Don’t give ideas … remember show Speaking history, there’s actually pandemics occurred every century past 400 years.

Glad someone realizes Good thing he's charismatic bowl shredded wheat cereal. ""Don't that. give hope."" I’m sorry. think flu vaccine invented? not? Education bad party. shot, 30 micrograms. least that's what's trial. regained taste permanent.

Many have, eventually, not.

Weird neuro symptoms totally unexpected bad viral infection. covid typical, people lose thier long term symptoms 2 3 years.

But long term risks. Spanish Flu, number Parkinson's cases doubled.  Cool know book tickets!  Preliminary data University Glasgow used statistical measurement “years life lost,” estimate average number years person would lived died prematurely health event like COVID-19 infection. estimates account age, sex underlying health conditions.""   first hand impregnated fully vaccinated woman. mean, ok UK. bit behind European countries better US states, that's mostly we've really started vaccinating children. shit never gonna end post daily updates Florida read article, somehow missed it.
Wonder much nurses pocket. NY first big city hit, vaccines little known treatment. Today effective vaccine know lot treatment. fact TODAY Florida bad is, FL gov, deathsentace, ever name idiot earned lately.  regained taste permanent.

I’d cry couldn’t eat mamas cooking anymore. Life would people can't get vaccine one reason another?  bad, didn’t know analogous Canadian (commonwealth, guess?) term offhand OP said information article something worth sharing people think ""but death rates lower old people die anyway"".

If you, like commenter, want translate something else local news article something else counter sort perceived ""panic"", go right ahead, meantime...

The fact matter Delta variant relatively new. impact children, new, fully understood compiled data meaningful way. local news report physician commenting he's experiencing terms children (plural) developing psychosis going Covid infection. think get anything 600k honestly. parents live 45 min away Santa Cruz mountains mom's fairly crappy house worth  Mostly won’t wear them. doesn’t really matter much since Covid mostly enters body via particular type nasal cell extremely young children few. type cell gradually increases age kids nine ten nearly adults. doctor hesitant issues related vaccine vs Covid  think people find alarmist report reporting increased case rates among children. absolutely expected considering fully open last cohort. last year, stayed home. 

But side side comparison demahraphic groups, still really cause concern necessarily. course parent, would obviously still scary, still mask precautions. point ramifications worse. 

You whole generation kids stay home mediocre schooling? know stunted development would be?

But headlines provoke fear. Say had, 1 death last last year, year 10. That's 1,000% increase. sounds horrible, realize small number increased another small number. Malaysian part story complicated. Vaccination efforts still ongoing crony company exclusive distribution Sinovac moving away supplying government wants sell higher prices private companies - basically skip queue program businesses. Malaysian government still getting Chinese vaccines like Cansino. Canada almost double population 27000 deaths  scientists governments really certain vaccinations consequences getting them...

They need start saying unvaccinated point, eligible receive one.. disqualified getting care COVID own. deny getting vaccine land hospital - die. Period. history lawsuits attorney give lawsuit more, less popularity people live state? many dead kids take, specifically? That’s bull shit.

CDC separated flu covid deaths.

And typically Peds flu deaths number 200 year.

If you’re school, good, stop pressing absolute bull shit fact. session yet, soon. no, currently mask optional.  Yea, I'm considering meant said thought never crossed tossed mind...need digest 

This references finally get hell way?  interesting.

Anyone 18 (not 12), parents may forced get vaccine. I’m elementary teacher who’s struggling fertility. Five years 3x shots, side effects, expenses. Due wife’s age running time.

Both us vaccinated.

Sometimes accept responsibility due diligence. "" It'll take 2-3 days change one direction another really impact 7 day average.""

You're right, ""screw up"" 7 day average. couple days worth wrong data *change* 7 day average. previous 28,000 daily numbers Sat Sun correct, would indeed end different 7 day average get adjusted numbers. 

But right, said ""screwed up"" ultimately made *that* much difference. still see wrong numbers reflected 7 day average though.  Good point. similar issue another article last year. Likely something link triggering sucks can't even show source otherwise accepted. Someone wants write provocative title clicks bot whacks despite content worthy discussion. long BC Canada 1/4 population 23 people ICU. One region province mask/gathering restriction “surge”. can’t imagine frustration doctors nurses Florida. right CDC website, new nationwide hospital admits people 17 0.31 100,000....im sorry almost seems like rounding error didnt make good news story, somebody please think children... baby fine. Baby 3 months. Doctor recommended pfizer shot cus time longest given ppl. 

I actually know someone ICU covid. put blood thinners still long time afterwards. I'm actually sure still them. clotting issues common covid? would think current clotting issue would make covid dangerous. tried couple weeks ago 11.5 yr old local pharmacy never went before. IDs stated names forms fudged bday. able locate insurance records DOB, refused give shot. That's funny family works Santa Clara County hospital system. pays well good benefits. numbers *while kids even school*.

Kids accounting 15% new cases U.S. right now. Even die, SEVERAL hospitalized see long-term damage. kind risk want expose kids to? Wow, already can’t take Ibuprofen pregnant might issue Tylenol? sure talking about. believe Israel approved Pfizer 12-15 FDA US did. giving boosters US doing, also don’t see Israel farther Delta wave US. add requirement show proof vaccination negative result lot activities premises asshats would get hit expensive idiot. types care units like PACU post surgical care, they’ll keep ER. They’re already extent many facilities. quality definitely going suffer though.

Last summer Austin opened field hospital convention center. they’re aren’t enough healthcare workers staff it. real problem beds…but staff spread thin can’t give patient level direct attention care needed. least burns memory mind changes way live rest life, girls death nothing Thank god work home whew I’m still nervous It’s here. plant built private interests… Yes Mr Executive, nurses leaving better pay elsewhere, shouldnt they? many millions year salary bonuses go hospital executives contribute nothing real day day functioning hospital. I've never seen patient satisfaction survey ask patient satisfaction CEOs performance. Transporters, environmental staff, nurses aids, nurses, doctors, respiratory therapy, PT OT, etc departments heart beat hospital. hospital systems reap sow, sadly it'll patients suffer (the vaccinated unvaccinated). bloated number nothing executives administrators US health care system disgrace. I’m lot mom groups seen lot women told wait second tri fever risk, like mentioned. didn’t even realize fever first tri bad thing (or I’ve forgotten since son almost 3, ha) 15% us cases last week children, I'm pretty sure that's alarm bell ringing.

Get vaccines people.   Florida numbers today? Yet carry around smartphone EVERYWHERE go… never turn off, collects 1,000 times information “microchip vaccine” could ever record.

I know always risk life. threat dying mamed driving car way see friends always threat. don’t know find hard “get over” idea comes covid. that’s I’ve feeling lately, ever since June. longer true. vaccines first came information - vaccinated women get pregnant still is. also information higher risk needing caesarean higher risk stillbirth get covid. pregnant woman needing admitted covid sometimes needs caesarean intubated. Sometimes baby survives mum dies.

Any pregnant woman choosing vaccinated needs take every precaution avoid covid - Delta difficult Because, unlike US, haven’t done studies hence data. OBGYN give note get vaccine though. ask it. Yeah? And?

The mortality rate far lower *everywhere* spring 2020. Shocking.

I'm sure they're reporting get vaccine back health department, time paperwork done already got shot. Looks like Rose McGowan *The Doom Generation.* Honestly pretty much haha. reads written someone 7th grade. mean tried best though, that's really counts Wellity, wellity, wellity! perfectly normal expected. vaccine never supposed keep us getting sick, keep us dying. time currently look up, recent academic report tentatively linked melatonin disrupting replication sars-cov-2, abundant youth diminishes age. could be, part of, mechanism made kids resistant serious infection early strains. Delta may capable overcoming inherent resistance greater means replication transmission, seeing kids falling ill higher rates. mentioned ""free tests"" unvaccinated people able enter restaurants, bars enclosed spaces (in towns high Covid value.) test centers literally every corner city, used get tested 15 minutes going restaurant, vaccines became widely available.

If somebody symptoms visit doctor, never pay test health related services, universal healthcare system place Germany. 

So little testing vulnerable. choose unvaccinated still want go public places, need pay test, instead paid taxpayer's money. highly logical. that's we're going get nutjob radio host governor.

Yeah, part rational, reasoning, people understand masks vaccines important- Boycott three airlines. Screw them.

Insanely optimistic. great dude. Correct I’m wrong here.

March, May, June. Hope works out. already based argument.

Do cases that? I'd like read decisions really think freedom speech used. so, Obamacare would thrown SCOTUS unconstitutional based pre-existing condition clause insurance companies used able ask information decline insure put risk pool. can't anymore.

Ted's bill violate 10th Amendment taking power states reserved 10th. sure downvoted, 100% correct. people died breathing vaccinations. think hypocrisy age restrictions US. example:

1. old enough die country 18.
2. old enough vote 18.
3. old enough smoke drink 21.
4. old enough rent car 25.

Personally, think 18 it. Bam, adult. drink. rent car. go Vegas waste money, etc.

On flip side, \*older\* person think:

After age 70 face recurring driving tests. Sorry, can't see react traffic situations, driving.

I'm sure many people dementia vote, think truly dementia capable getting ballet box. said that, believe unnecessarily difficult vote. Making old people wait line 8 hours wrong, wrong. Especially gerrymander districts engineer wait some, make easy others. Anyone honest would agree this.

Finally, think children vote. children, mean 18. necessary boundary, fair. takes power 16 year olds mature/informed 30 year olds- line must drawn somewhere. Don’t get hopes up. Attorney General Legislature already taking court mandate removed. Wrong size wallets? Oh, humanity. Proof you’re saying? think would widespread knowledge true. remember United bad guy incident doctor pulled flight force beat senseless. vote ""belong"" anyone, pays little worldly ""the Democratic party follow strategy would followed, therefore stupid""

Again, recall election gain *much* safer primary 1 year? sounds like states keep track. blame people wanting booster. like antivaxers waiting line smart draw conclusion person lines. Indeed, yet there’s many selfish people that’s causing pandemic worse needs live society. Pretty much.

Rral world data always messy. You’re lucky. Oregon I’d say 10% people still wearing masks month ago. medical profession conscript Armed Forces forced work field need quit.
There ways dealing problem Covid - vaccination primary way wise masks social distancing.

I would want looked nurse/doctor burnt forced work.

They slaves. mention many people future would choose medical career happened ? Cases lead hospitalizations, hospitalizations lead deaths. dying streets yet pass south. end month see deaths ticking fast hospitalizations now. Even deaths 1% US population, that's 3.3 million people said done. Bro, I’m going real you. Sounds like ranting coming dark place, I’m sorry see sorry you’re there. 

First off, one’s saying masks replacement vaccines; we’re acknowledging kids can’t get vaccinated yet masks still pretty important. get frustration despair, think take step back, you’ll see masking work, yes, Delta way contagious, science applies. state Delta period dropped masks indoors. we’re masking back cases rising, I’d say 90% people interact wear them. Mind you, know isn’t case everywhere, it, mean it’s 99% people, right? 

I’m sorry you’ve gone it, hope finally get past wave, it’ll last one. I’m tired too. ...they want get Covid? I’m thinking same. got second Pfizer shot back late February, I’m pretty close six month waning immunity that’s thrown around… I’ve beaches Miami, LA, Mass, bunch places between. I’ve never seen anything close festival level packed lol. You’re usually good 20+ feet away next closest group know question may asked before, yet found one ""because they're simply dumb.""

Logically speaking, willing take test - means believe virus real deadly. said, stop short believing scientist studied viruses created vaccine? Utterly stupid policy. want reckless even reckless. Almost smart CDC saying vaccinated people wear masks , ignoring continued asymptomatic transmission. wrong idiots charge? authority coming seeking 3rd shot likely go waste regardless get not? muh freedom   again. rest world scientific communities' research peer-reviewed. Sinovac going count vaccine travel anyone gets it. also Astra made Thailand going recognized travel either.

I'm expat acknowledge flaws West USA tell tone statements blind loyalist China. Like said familiar wife Chinese hear nonsense constantly family members.

Next, going tell virus started USA? I'm torn this. really want see money thrown morons could've gotten vaccinated now, hand, want many people possible get tested find infections quickly. Never mind requiring vaccinated recovered people get tested bright idea begin with, since sterile immunity seem thing Covid. currently running straight another wave another lockdown gamble work people still refuse get vaccinated.  same. also learned state actually keeps track received vaccines when, possible get double juiced Pfizer J&amp;J even wanted to.  I'd guess symptoms avoided vaccination though scared .. 10 year old’s first day school tomorrow. didn’t go school year (online school) .. didn’t want online school anymore .. excited go back school .. freaked school tomorrow ..  events largely outdoors, indoors? Sturgis people hitting bars night long makes worse typical outdoors festival everyone rolling around fairground. couple hundred people packed bar worse couple thousand milling outside. all, still choose pay testing participate hearts desire quite fair. get job done, fair policy. Freedom? /s  sounds like moderate case crummy flu like symptoms nothing life threatening. sounds like vaccine give 100% protection least kept symptoms mild enough end hospital. true.

Having returned article I'm convinced supremely stupid idea even moreso. 

Infections increasing. people pay disincentivized get tested exactly want infections increasing. 

It's bad happens constantly Australia seed person every outbreak doxxed harassed media (unless they're white). people use checkins, get tested hide homes die, infecting families communities. logic exactly this. mean sick person flu ‘visually physically’ got contagious someone didn’t notice got it. Thanks. Deeper go. might still wrong. Cheers. Go get booster then. think much. tests cost 70 cent supermarket. Maybe back pay 6 euros. people care much 70 cent. testing imposed monetary penalty, essentially infringes freedom choice regarding whether get vaccine people habe lot money spend. 

This fair respectable way achieve well-intentioned goal, getting people vaccinate. think people would willing get vaccinated stopped pushing Fauci hard. fine doctors media. Thanks. read already...Was really hoping answers individuals different countries. guess might keep section short then. employees allowed check vaccination status, allowed cases like medical staff. need test thing like going theater gym. Supermarkets grocery stores require test vaccine. Overall strong restriction. 

As Germany developed country, citizens armed either. pull anything thin air? talking facts. took sinovac vaccines right available. peer reviewed paper, don’t know detail suspect trial sinovac’s control done third party. mean western media showed much bias lost credibility. simple example sinovac showed result kept silent slight bad news western media went crazy blow up. improve symptoms?! comes loss smell taste, brain fog fatigue, though. heard fatigue sticks around months. Anti-vaxxers lost cause. Get vaccine arms people want it. Benefits authorizing early outweigh risks.  That’s serious someone different thing post addressed. Cytokine happens prominently acute infection. I’m sorry loss smarter parents. Weird contact tracing like countries...

Or empathy... [Forced sterilization policies US targeted minorities Genuine question: people gone back “hunkering down” Delta, reasons so?

Right little half new cases outside Vancouver metro area. Germany no. That's says non vaccinated people. “no” No, made sure though  Tell don’t insurance think tests still mandatory, pay themselves. incentivize get vaccinated. answers question. New Zealand 26 deaths. I’m using extreme example still managed, need people act society Republican? honest, colleges U.S mandating vaccine. read article headline! sure Oregon, see lot medical professionals saying capacity issues staffing related point. empty beds, bed hospital little good nurses doctors help patient it. lot left profession moved less-frontlines roles ground pulp last 18mo. required visit hospitals, restaurants more, either stay home get vaccinated - pay test. Pretty fair. give couple weeks everyone saying ""fuck, Florida fucked covid"" wonder 2021 driver's gender still considered legitimate actuarial criteria setting someone's car insurance rates, yet unvaccinated (by choice) morons work subject elevated health insurance rate. believe intelligence tests vote

How feel age restrictions then. children able vote? old people dementia? able spread virus, allowed enter example restaurants. privat companies (soccer clubs already started) even let unvaccinated people come, even accept test. Aside whole sexual harassment thing, actually dealt covid state? Well, thing is, tests remain mandatory lot activities Germany, meet untested, unvaccinated people i.e. restaurants.

If can't get vaccinated reason, still get free tests.

It's basically, want life back, get vaccinated free pay test time want leave house.

I think people complain corona restrictions refusing get vaccinated often understand, partially responsible need restrictions first place, okay apply bit pressure. colleague, thinks like stopped even trying discuss him. I'm curious thinks recent development, though...   That’s surprising! district asked us submit proof vaccination May followed last week. School starts next week school staff aren’t fully vaccinated must undergo weekly Covid testing. released statement saying 90% us vaccinated. true. people either stay home take test entering example restaurants hospitals. fucking vaccine everyone nobody pay it. could get pay anything. simply stay home pay. easy that.  true people waiting Pfizer dont want az Um think know, see happening too. getting angry spiteful hear FL TX asking help laughed died beginning ""blue flu."" let festers turns something worse. see people really wish poison heart. doubt happened earlier pandemics extent. human thing, need realize happening stop crossing line metastasizes cancer society. never good thing wish fellow countrymen dead. Yes, indeed, needs research. least country became ""take paracetamol feeling well"" ""take paracetamol option"". really disappointing. I'm somewhat frustrated this. 

It's downright oppose policy. light hospital forecasts, suppose can't hurt. also strong doubts effectiveness due 1) likely low compliance rural, heavily unvaccinated Oregon, 2) almost certain large holes implementation (e.g., lots folks still eat indoors, maskless restaurants).

It annoys heck effective, permanent solution staring us right face (vaccine mandates), reason never gets pursued Sadly not. Stiko given official statement towards it, doctors germany refuse vaccinate pregnant woman. Even breastfeeding women excluded. also autoimmune disease medication suppresses autoimmune system. biggest worry case whether body manage build defenses vaccine. doctors recommend (I'm doctor, everyone's situation different) pause medication vaccine, would opportunity build better response.

The mRNA vaccine (Pfizer Moderna) contain live attenuated virus. contain virus whatsoever. That's believe cool it.

The AZ &amp; JJ contain virus, called adenovirus harmless. genetically modified instead replicating produces information body produce spike protein. similar mRNA vaccine does. vaccines generally considered lower efficacy, body likely produce antipodies coronavirus also adenovirus. makes 2nd dose possibly less effective, body might kill adenovirus anything. us border opening. don't. fiancé's Aunt got covid died 4 days got sick. could see it... combination delta working way unvaccinated population giving ""non consensual vaccination"" afterwards combined rest folks vaccinated might enough give us enough keep virus bay. Okay good thing predictions usually right. /s 40k covid fairly small compared rest population. better way scare anti-vaxxers recover, 25% get long covid 6-8 months including fatigue, loss/change smell/taste, brain fog, headaches, etc. effective Delta, though understand done. said might it, definitely is. There's idea I've seen floating around employer mandates vaccine could liable workmen's compensation employee contract virus. could they're requiring onboarding new hires existing employees. said ""the world looking success"" death toll one worst world, so… feels like Deja Vu. That's true. there's nothing identify patient HIPAA violation. use medical records time case studies that. studies this.

Or suggest hide performance enhancing drugs. sucky thing healthcare workers get punished this, unfortunately. gather responses comment testing mandatory Germany.

I'm it. Covid ruining everything. year half need figure out. 10 years ago working hospital flu season could opt vaccine **but** wear mask. Even religious reasons. us 98% vaccine rate. Wild simple times comparison virus far deadly. see happening parts Southern Oregon. Things pretty bad many people community think big deal. Even though hospitals overwhelmed. many people believe it.  I'm mad decision except that, couple days ago, saying would leave individual counties decide?

What, like rural, heavily unvaccinated counties, surprise nobody, decided reinstate mask mandates (that residents never followed anyway)?  Delta, official Delta Carrier. even read comment. know better.  Yep! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Risk spread outside low people spread out. much higher festival settings people use toilets, crowd tents stay close other.

Outside mean instantly gain covid shield. I'm one American live tourist destination. I'm vaccinated tourists. economy needs boost last summer. Come careful, even vaxxed people getting Delta around :( No, don’t. They’re reckless it’s still going lead anything could rightly call massacre. original antivax thing pushed Russia well  could smell things covid. feel sense smell improved post covid, weird. literally can’t anymore. daughter remote end 1st grade 2nd grade. also baby home well. can’t. literally broken. toll 18 months taken parents pretty insane. don’t give.  That's true, really is. republican-dominated legislature problem. remarkable little show concrete terms last 18 months. One would think deadly pandemic, millions deaths, once-in-a-century economic recession would built fire collective butts led us re-examine lot things society.

Even things narrowly public health pandemic prevention really done great extent. ambitious things, like national health care system US, also strangely table.

One thing happen reassessment idea many jobs could done remotely. sort accidental, probably far-reaching consequences. Another thing seems happening people realizing longer interested returning jobs total shit terms pay working conditions.

Quite wild. That's I'm worried about. already enough people speaking vaccines. Giving hint rushing things without safety followup period previously deemed important, make worse, matter good reasons. Yeah, shit Every beach town country people crammed bars weeks weeks now. South Jersey places lines around block get Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday aware request asked “I heard that, check see that’s true not,” said. “I would honestly doubt that’s true, I’ll look. lot stuff stockpiled last year half department emergency management. requests across desk. haven’t notified that.”

Uh huh.... Solution: say don’t insurance, it’s free anyway Idk people keep focusing events they’re things people going to. Literally everyone know acting like Covid over. Philly. place didn’t see person store without mask almost year one point

It’s specific group acting like pandemic over. It’s everyone Yes. Hearing vax helps long Covid. Good call. Good ole human hubris.  P r e c h! still haven’t approved adult assholes still using excuse get one people convinced horrible kids.

Wishing dad best bro. I've gone steady dieting exercising comfort food sleeping in. bouts un-motivation, experience anger people dragging and, quite honest, people want treat us part exact ones never gave shit whatever wanted. I'm curious sort plans various school districts significant portion student population comes sick.

Last year, early pandemic, things went fully online, *one* person (student teacher) tested positive, whole class would stay home rest week person tested positive would stay away 14 days. *two* people two *different* classes school tested positive, entire school canceled 14 days.

Let's say start school 3 kids come it... going let class continue normal we've doggedly committed in-person learning year? 

The thing school district said ""we'll taking precautions seriously"", nothing plans Covid spreads among students.  FL report anymore Fridays send weekday updates CDC.

Usually wom pulls CDC, sure today. Maybe due issue weekend reporting even true. first shot still help weeks. popular hee-haw part IL, much amongst educated portion population. Levy tax unvaxxed pick tab. we’re nationwide school closures months measles? 1 upvote = 1 prayer That’s better explanation. Thanks.  first come first served.

They triage plans weigh likely get better get better faster.

They'll rip ventilator let die stronger patient needs it. morons going spread America, fucking countries.  Delta

Has whole new meaning name Delta variant. guess delta transmissible estimated. anyone hv read sequencing identify variants effect? Delta plus, lambda? There’s something adding rate transmission effect. Damn. Worldometers today numbers states checked (California Washington) assume getting numbers directly state’s health depts. ain’t north vs south, it’s rural vs urban. Bloody hell. case load rate increase even peaked yet, peak hospitalizations deaths lag around two three weeks. ""Child massacre"" absurd hyperbole. Starting feel like bit viral gerrymandering going especially south. enough people die, politicians schemes work.

Next census interesting.

Thank getting relatives vaccinated. Also, assume forego flu shot too. Know information sources careful.

Now might time seek alternate information sake. thought. think we'd learn let kids vaccinated last pandemic, then. 27 week triplets. three vent. Two came home hospital Trach, vent oxygen first two half years. Son got Trach around 3. Daughter going 7 still it. going bunch airway surgeries. don’t want get sick definitely don’t want anymore vents. Baby b spent 100 days hospital, baby 325 baby c 15 months.

Best luck you. hurdle far high Americans

Only real hurdle given, that's main difference UK US. Look CDC mask mandate change, suddenly happened. ""Vaccinated people need mask know unvaccinated people going mask either, cares cases low now!"" me, shows serious lack forward-thinking preoccupation need vaccination whether need wear mask Target.

All focus masking made CDC completely forget actual goal was: getting herd immunity! Herd immunity supposed 70% pre-Delta even reach that. Meanwhile, UK actual lockdown vaccination campaign, gradually loosening restrictions cases started decline, end goal? Getting enough people vaccinated country could fully reopen safely possible, waiting COVID magically go away without securing high levels vaccination. 

The problem nothing really waiting side vaccinated people group beyond unmasking measly trinkets there, like free donuts lottery tickets. vaccinations actually leading freedom vaccinated people, lot easier people feel like they're part group effort shows everyone responsible making things better everyone else. Whereas states like, ""Heh, I've got vaccination, forget screwballs.""

The problem kind individualist thinking vaccination *not* completely individual act goal reach herd immunity and/or keep cases managed long-term periods. That's say vaccinated people shamed--and I've seen way much attitude sites--for trying move extent done part getting herd immunity. goal reaching herd immunity vaccination treated group effort, easy shift blame towards vaccinated want enjoy lives more.

Those brief months cases seriously declined saying things like, ""Let's continue keeping COVID community, get vaccinated! "" ""100,000 shots day keeps COVID away, come get today!"" things going well, time double vaccinations, hospitals overflowing school year's starting. thank you. real rabbit hole online learning airlines. Maybe I’m completely wrong couldn’t lie say they’re 12 like CVS? AFAIK don’t really ask much ID. Yeah, think lurking back everyone's mind idea covid ""temporary,"" soon going back ""normal.""

This mindset may hampering us taking difficult, long-term measures. I’m saying mask mandates won’t help combat spread that’s already happening. Lmao @ bandana facing protecting one infectious viruses that’s ever encountered level spread. 

You people swear masks tier vaccines terms protection/mitigation, it’s almost cult like point. get you.

You can't see difference company selling information darkweb victim identity theft impersonation. care sell to. could legit board company could Russian mafia. Benefits authorizing early outweigh risks.

Really? Based what? best knowledge, none under-12 trials actually publicly reported results yet.

One cannot claim side science evidence, make claims benefits vaccinating children outweigh risks, actual evidence in.

It's likely net beneficial, based safety profile adults. However, also seen COVID vaccines (very rare) side effects much common younger age groups (heart inflammation Pfizer, blood clot issues AZ J&amp;J). possible (if unlikely) something like may crop heavily affects kids 12, makes vaccine unfavorable age group.

Which clinical trials different age groups prior releasing them, rather assuming fine. government follow constitution laws.

This vaxx companies going bribery corruption, there's virtually chance get since there's longer control group. control group got vaccinated companies sell information, government doesn't.

Sure... guess, companies arrest you, charge crime, throw cage?

Can really see difference here?  seeing mostly unvaccinated unit, vaccinated well?  another example goalposts continually shifting. never going get zero COVID. like flu, like common cold, we're going learn live it.

There's idea I've seen floating around employer mandates vaccine could liable workmen's compensation employee contract virus.

That sounds kind strange - logic it, also employee get sick can’t prove caught work.

I suspect internet rumor, something major airline would factoring vaccine-related decisions. like that, government lost track many becoming infected! Also alcoholic, two years sober now. think people understand sheet compulsion drink they've never experienced addiction. way describe sometimes almost like someone else taking controls making decision drink you. companies sell information, government doesn't. even worse. really care government tracks I'm board, care companies selling information profit. opt (thank EU data laws, even though live US).  Great article Love it.

However immune system difference completely totally benign. We’re Pfizer trial started June. December we’re set unblinded told Jan/Feb target. Got J&amp;J 2020 part clinical trial. clinical trials don’t report state databases vaccines. 

About four weeks ago got Pfizer shot drug store. checked insurance probably state’s vaccine database gave vaccine. said I’d vaccinated previously written pre-vaccine form didn’t go way tell pharmacist I’d vaccinated previously.

I’m debating whether get second Pfizer shot not.

On bright side - I’m state database get electronic record vaccination. 

I reported I’d gotten Pfizer vaccine trial like thanks letting us know, still want remain trial.

I really wish guidance somewhere people don’t need make decisions medical guidance. Strawman. ""The freedom get vaccinated"" never principle mine. Vaccines benefit individual society whole. literally zero reason refuse safe, free vaccinations. well aware limitations ""Vermeidung einer Seuchengefahr"".

 already made case fact conjunction Article II III (3) provides valid concern arising fact legislation may discriminatory, people unable afford tests. I'm set study aboard Japan next spring feel pretty confident that, open students teachers least soon.

Aside that, even manage contain outbreak - looks somewhat unlikely given virus spread several different cities unlike January - another one soon. matter time. toughest measures virus still slip cracks point China still face question go elimination strategy still viable. 5yo trial got first shot June. We’re scheduled unblinded December. Why? furthering understanding vaccine efficacy time variants critical, regardless stance vaccine.

I fully vaxxed Pfizer, first shot within week EUA, data seems worthwhile know. kid’s elementary school already received approval state host in-school-vaccine event approved. scheduled date FEMA van shows vaccinated kids signed up. accuracy, it’s identical spike protein. 

They modify places increase stability. 

But yeah, reason think would dangerous real thing attached virus. 

Everyone get vaccinated. too!! I'm well aware Grundgesetz says, took German citizenship test last month. Right free covid test among them.

What *is* right, however, this, Artikel hat das Recht auf die freie Entfaltung seiner Persönlichkeit, **soweit er nicht die Rechte anderer verletzt** und nicht gegen die verfassungsmäßige Ordnung oder das Sittengesetz verstößt.

""Everyone right free development personality **as long violate rights others** violate constitutional order moral law.""

Also, highly relevant, Artikel Deutschen genießen Freizügigkeit im ganzen Recht darf nur durch Gesetz oder auf Grund eines Gesetzes und nur für die Fälle eingeschränkt werden, denen eine ausreichende Lebensgrundlage nicht vorhanden ist und der Allgemeinheit daraus besondere Lasten entstehen würden oder denen es zur Abwehr einer drohenden Gefahr für den Bestand oder die freiheitliche demokratische Grundordnung des Bundes oder eines Landes, **zur Bekämpfung von Seuchengefahr,** Naturkatastrophen oder besonders schweren Unglücksfällen, zum Schutze der Jugend vor Verwahrlosung oder um strafbaren Handlungen vorzubeugen, erforderlich ist.

I could continue, trust get idea. Stuff costs money. Big deal. either pay, go without. Or, know, take free vaccine benefits everyone around you. 

Alright, fun, arguing bad faith, I'm find productive pastime. People also politically divided around covid US. average pocket costs healthcare much higher US.

It's useful watch positive test percentage. hard disagree him. fully vaccinated, exceedingly unlikely even delta variant would cause get sick. avoidable tragedy... That's one way look it. seeing higher vaccine uptake lot places hit delta. Maybe final push people needed. sincerely really hope so. pause medication vaccine, would opportunity build better response.

I actually timed vax take doses 2 days reinject meds. hope period immune system strongest. It’s age brackets though. Close 100% elderly first, also second.

Younger groups reason seem plateauing well 80% Fourth fifth shot??? Holy fuck. Talk dice rolling I'm getting first dose October. ""vulnerable group"" usually means people can't protect reason. Kids can't get vax, I'm immunosuppressed vax less effective, people vulnerable way are. choose put lives others risk they're selfish, ignorant scum. deserve classified people protect.  told coworker yesterday, she’s like hopefully it’s approved people get like world living in? They’ll move goal post think going get Covid. antivaxxers know, say. They've made long without getting think ever going to. understand different Delta either. false sense security. someone actual vulnerable group (immunosuppressed) get going absolutely not.

The test centers provide PCR tests? bad. Iran sounds like worse Florida, tragic.  Ok article alluded talk private testers. Seems Germany done things differently I'm used here, I'm still locked so...

You would need double em, new jersey.

However issue hand OG covid spread outside, nearly much think did. virus due lock downs prevented traveling.

Florida vacation destination people going getting infected entering hospital home, population density people live states matters.

Subway systems essentially worst thing planet alongside bussing covid OG. New York others got hit early, hard huge wave.

Your examples dumb, UK 4k deaths per million, states 2500.

Population density matters, virus moves matters.

Deaths lag 3 weeks already peaking near deaths wave winter. cases doubled since then.

You guys looking excuse silly.

No, example virus mutating naturally. people took seriously, would less issue since transmission chains would broken instead allowed continue.  Honestly, cause many sub lost damned minds. took long break reading getting vaccinated came back find expectations vaccine, i.e., I'd probably still get sooner later - totally wrong, even though distinctly remember people arguing whether it'd provide protection infection. study Israel, believe, showed protection transmission previously thought celebrated acknowledged mere ""bonus"" sub back January February believe was.

We issues mask wearing, school, last year, nervous year, people purposely disobey case, needs level enforcement.  Didn’t khameini outlaw getting western vaccines?  clear, “another one” mean. Everyone absolutely get original recommended vaccine kids going learn valuable lesson. hope teachers incorporate syllabus! San Francisco also. course designed hope could that, goal always 100% efficacy, that's realistic prediction, hope. realistic idea vaccines would keep people hospital minimum (which mRNA vaccines exceedingly well), prevent symptomatic COVID much possible (which vaccines still well regarding current variants).

*Maybe pediatricians there, admitting toddlers subjecting invasive procedures bankrupting parents denying care kids toddler Covid positive test isn’t sick. Maybe. It’s big universe.*

Your imagination really malicious, though. I’m sorry whatever awful experience you’ve makes suspect pediatricians evil heart. places like Texas, there's mitigation tactics buy into. governor completely tied hands local government.

Social distance for...forever? school public university, would significant first amendment issue allowing religious exemptions though. religions actually vaccinations.

Masks never touted perfect. help protect others. vaccinated going back wearing stores crowds. 

This Delta time. southern red states absolute Covid fire. school even started yet. burn unvaccinated like wildfire. 

Buckle up. Mask up. need rude disrespectful. physician trying answer question. 

Below study citing incidence encephalitis COVID complication 0.215%. cannot give incidence encephalitis due “common cold” bc “common cold” probably know caused several different families viruses. tell physician 20 years training experience developing encephalitis “common cold” would extraordinarily rare. “common cold” virus I’ve ever heard cause viral encephalitis enterovirus. Complication rate encephalitis enterovirus 3% - bear mind enteroviruses comprise less 1% common cold cases. vast majority colds due rhinoviruses, coronaviruses (not SARS covid course) RSV. 

So respond question whether “common cold” causes encephalitis similar rate covid, it’s even Good thing chicken pox vaccine Wow, comment exactly story... always doom thinker, reality always even worse imagined. continues be. Didn’t UK shut though? got back (to CA) Kauai couple days ago. place felt unsafe (indoors, crowded, folks without masks on) waiting gate board flight back. (Flight next gate shared waiting area delayed enough passengers flights gate area time. People without masks theoretically eating okay take masks least one two 'forgot' put mask back after). Sadly, lot people live states made mitigation efforts illegal. South, cases surging, people forced back office like we're surging. There's ""hey guys, getting bad let's work home."" Instead ""the governor says safe make sure wear mask unless sitting desk."" retail workers service sector working businesses require masks patrons CDC screwed mask messaging. one wearing masks! government let us down. people figure ""why listen anyway?""

Thank you. jobs though. people misinformed genuinely worried vaccine. reassuring documentation might easily help 

 don’t lump group crazy anti vax conspiracy theorists still delta. Delta outcompetes everything sheer transmissibility. covid patients occupy beds really long time. kept responding kept Gish galloping. Kids getting sick icu keep making excuses.  That's fair.  2nd Moderna fewer side effects first time. Mildly sore arm, much else. 1st shot badly sore arm, mild fatigue. though, entire classes dedicated ethics, exist harm.

It doesn’t hurt proactive it’s certainly better potentially waiting vaccinated people end hospitals kids get shot matter weeks couple months haven’t heard one, [but one extremely doesn’t well Beta, appears variant escapes vaccines, Beta simply isn’t contagious Delta Alpha gets outcompeted  many, that’s reason citing still wanting really cautious.

Oh, ""more variants!"" ""long covid!"" We'll never zero covid, lot people never comfortable that. Poor analogy. Acetominaphen foreign chemical body (i.e. normally present all) metabolized liver P450 enzymes form toxic chemical directly kill liver cells. vaccines produce inert protein, i.e. made everyday, always-present amino acids, doesn’t anything easily broken down. Well, peak sooner later, then. Brazil already shit load seasonal/endemic viruses one extra. doctors recommending receive booster That's mask mandates recommending masks never worked. fine people wearing masks guarantee everyone would suck wear one. pandemic proved anything can't trust people right thing. what’s really scary fact children don’t really get sick often, they’re actually aren’t many pediatricians since see patient twice year. 

You don’t kids you? Young kids get sick go doctor *constantly*. last year nice it’s reduced normal times it’s one thing winters. kinds childhood illnesses first 6-7 years. make difference need ""real treatment"".

I found recently kids' school district offering online school now, citing FDA's lack progress approving vaccines kids 12. I'm hoping becomes option people, mask mandates can't online schooling, vaccine approved kids soon. 

Even approved, we'd still looking six week time period first shots given kids considered immune, they're targeting beginning September still puts us way mid-October kids would immunity. Even optimistic scenarios think we'll COVID control schools Christmas break soonest. one wants go social event wearing mask already vaccinated. Anyone going festivals accepted minuscule chance getting seriously sick okay risk profile. come cutesy little nicknames groups people I'm adult.

Says guy calling someone else ""cult member.""  MERSA. ?? mutation savvy it’s virtually untreatable. may wrong, someone please tell so. west nashville is. shows relatively, kids making smaller part confirmed cases, absolute, people general getting covid. consistent delta transmissible overall, consistent increased transmissibility specifically among children (as compared overall increased rate). hoping Abbott end giving congratulate mayors saying figured work around policies. high profile breakthrough cases go detail regarding actually constitutes ""infection"". case Yankees, recall ~10 ""infections"" test daily many people SARS-CoV-2 genetic material nasal swabs, 1-2 actually ever symptomatic mild cases.

If someone COVID near inhale viral material, going nose start replicating. vaccinated immune system hopefully starts fighting become symptomatic. could still test positive window body fighting virus, test daily high levels social interaction still likely see positive tests ""infected"", even never get sick. people talking getting third shot people making decisions global vaccine distribution overlap. absolutely garbage countries vaccines, US particular, neglected cases deliberately obstructed global vaccination efforts, literally influence that, pretty easy end conclusion might well protect however can, especially hear extra doses trashed. confirm! I'm Auburn. made arrangements yesterday cat body case survive. 🥺 fully vaxxed, back isolation. Wish luck. issue “the whole world” literally doesn’t vaccines won’t enough years come. Whether everyone vaccinated particular country far irrelevant appearance deadly variants.  That's nice. still want lung scarring, neurological issues, problems come ""long covid"". Plus, still know long term effects infected. example, HPV causes plethora cancers. knows covid years. Staying hospital everything. Yet. got Pfizer try find Moderna booster? really want wait they're approved also I'm nervous waning effectiveness. Someone use extra shots.

Seems boosters would safe everyone. This. Probably smarter 80% people reddit. vaccinated safe. Go fun. reason woukd consider canceling around bunch immuno comprised people cannot get vaccine. I'm planning weekend trip weeks mentioned article, preliminary data countries hit Delta first suggests Delta severe adults. Couple article says kids making proportions hospitalizations suggests equally severe kids. words worse kids specifically, worse everybody including kids. Unfit office  rash, two kidney disorders studied data Pfizer, recommended label changes

They beginning look.  Nothing conclusive yet. Pregnant women get vaccinated ASAP. Defining “long” question difficult. There’s findings reduced sperm numbers quality men Covid, news yet whether that’s temporary, effect fertility. finite number people if, massive load ICU's, severe traumatic medical emergency needed bed also said fuck anti-vax fuckers let 'em fill hospitals die. essentially one fuckers point? fucker can't find bed neither I. dies, die.

Contact tracing absolute joke Germany way. call immediate contacts, vaccinated contacts even tested, people make big stink released quarantine early, tracing upstream infection chain etc. pretty useless compared countries like NZ.  mean, that's kind point. older people likely fully vaccinated -- said young people coming unvaccinated, Delta kind 50 previous ones were. - several densely populated regions

- *fully* vaccinated rate [is State government actively promoting measures, mask mandate prohibitions vaccine mandate prohibitions, assist spreading virus.

- State government promotes messaging support fears anti-vaxxers Covidiots. threads subreddits help argue with/debunk misinformation?

My brother extremely high risk capable caring himself. barely breathe sick. mom reluctant vaccinate thinks vaccine unknown risk react condition prepared dose medications gets it.

She tells men also higher risk myocarditis vaccine. sent something doctor vaccine responsible mutations like Delta.

I don’t know best tactic here. even bother attacking source? logic? don’t energy research explain expert wrong actually qualified.   That’s possibly true. likely country gone insane “rights” misinformation curtailed vaccinations preventable deaths. Well, let know one common side effects COVID loss taste smell let know that's proven due neurological malfunction bc covid. 

Afterwards, tell hyposmia, loss smell, common first symptom Parkinsons occur decade full onset that, lot world already taken vaccine fine, ask really thinks risk catching covid potentially way worse consequences road worth losing job getting vaccine. Anyone else receive Non-CDC vaccination card? I’m smaller county 200,000 people got vaccine county got small business card county public health dept logo. definitely wonder travel, whether people think it’s legit not… gave pause well 😅 San Francisco public health department literally advising that. also prevented never leave house. country gone insane risk tolerance. excellent news!!

I know early weird issues pharmacies - glad it’s fixed now! Love this. major reaction second jab?

The mRNA vaccine instructions cells make small part actual virus called spike protein. Us humans know spike protein harmless can't infect you, immune system gets tricked thinking spike protein real virus, learns recognize fight anything spike protein. Hence vaccine side effects - body thinks fighting infection uncomfortable stuff fight real infection, even though harmless piece protein gets quickly flushed system.

Hope explanation helps! First dose nothing. Second dose felt like got hit Mack truck. Got dose 7am around 6pm started getting chills. 9 worst chills ever. Spent next day recovering then, like that, back normal. definitely take day shot work. One great thing is, never felt nauseous.

Edit. Moderna vaccine. We've using masks decades centuries big fat lie suggest necessary (or, remember, even floated may harmful!). 


A third dose vaccine came existence year ago is, hand, truly unstudied unknown situation. people think already immune, especially already covid came well connected monied family could afford donate building (looking Kuschner), perhaps. But, unlikely Ivy League graduate degrees. Nah, sorry. Even vaccinated, COVID far scarier cold flu given prevalence long COVID lack quality data occurrence breakthrough cases. Especially insanely high transmissibility delta. 

I think it’s totally reasonable worker job done effectively home resist returning office either delta spread subsided science settled. 

Of course, think keeping many jobs remote (mostly remote) possible post-pandemic anyway. reductions carbon emissions due decreased commuting worth it. Good think simultaneous though much slower moving crisis climate change well. Feel free wear mask like. sheer ignorance idiocy incredible.

Even Canada, bad. medical expenses covered public, work? job many sick days. -- Universal not. still ""suggesting"" masking unvaccinated people (both outside inside) everywhere properties. find incredibly irresponsible. (Thanks nothing again, Comcast!)

And...I also trip planned weeks. Still uncertain I'll going. Even N95s arrived mail today small comfort. wonder, look Looks like hospital capacity pretty steady, new cases graph looks little scary. Deaths lag hospitalizations, hospitalizations lag cases. Imposing sensible restrictions probably smart thing given seeing south. doesn’t look like anyone public realm mandate vaccines. look like governor getting *some* pushback. think response determine whether office holders/administrators join push. Considering rising cases, hospital situation, number supporters landing there, would seem like major misstep focus efforts stopping mask mandates. He’s painted corner really two options:
1) back hardline stance get creamed primaries flip flopping. 
2) double enforcing ban mandates, get creamed deaths followed. 

We already surpassed NY Covid mortality. Abbott try spin function population, witness NY ambushed virus left die Trump/Kushner. won’t stop people voting him, definitely hurt numbers primary least. data cumulative though, words Delta-specific. article mentions earlier, preliminary data suggests Delta severe. article also states kids proportionally hospitalized rates before. things true, means Delta severe kids well. equally severe kids adults. Delta-specific hospitalization rate? even know? study article links citing hospitalization rates mentions hardest hit states Delta stopped reporting. States like Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Florida mid-crisis right inconsistent data reporting. might really know good percentages long scientists time dig analyze. know childhood hospitilizations Covid all-time high. know answer hand, know delta way contagious, infecting younger populations.


Teachers fall category ""younger population"" specifically, they're ones locked classroom 30-40 kids, go back home hundreds family members. Yale! man playing dumb, makes much worse. KNOWS better! one county FL held onto orange sea red long time.  Right; evil is, then! I'm Austin sort surprised still see lot people wearing masks around here. brains brawn. Could money. got 2nd shot 1st July caught Covid, don’t think boosters going solution new variant, tbh True, although argue B cell response vary won’t know good response get booster safe. I’d like see specific numbers research, like sample sizes start with, buy there’s really big difference.  fucking disappointed sub. ashamed уourselves supporting this. want fully vaccinated turns something like flu. stays worse flu. Compare death rates flu. 

And without aggressive global effort might mutate something evades current vaccines. headline put bad mood. latest dance craze people understandably worried trying protect themselves. said? Seemed true look uk Netherlands cases rise hard say certainty Lol, well check insurance, got J&amp;J insurance might difficult. suspect insurance keeping better track state. I’m also CA. doctors aren’t recommending without approval. Including CDC FDA Death rate doesn’t need change, that’s point. Even death rate stays .05 cases skyrocket, .05 become larger magnitude compared minor outbreak death rate. significant toll human life one prevented. currently vaccine status affect wearing mask not. affects get covid-test going restaurant. mask mandate still applies go shopping (as would unreasonable test every person vaccination status + controll arent taking mask entering)

so long tests free would incentive fake vaccine certificate.

additionally faking vaccination certificate easy. currently 2 accepted proofs vaccination, old one (used vaccinations since decades) doctor write date vaccine plus sticker information batch came (usually sticker form) ""book"" vaccinations got noted down.  alternatively new ""digital"" version, basically QR-code containing information yourself, vaccination gave certificate. informations encoded way make edits apparent. someone controlls vaccination statsu (eg police) must offical Photo-ID.

So I'm sure gets ""just change pdf"" info from. Nah. throw away Yeah even said shouldn’t boosters least September it’s like it’s one doctor. think need boosters - look study came Pfizer effectiveness Delta United gotten much better last years Minorities young people likely unvaccinated old white people - right head. single good leader red blue hit right states throw medias need clicks views sensationalizing everything. Feels like madness. what’s benefit reasoning behind Pfizer less dose? kind stuff certainly frame knowledge thank you, info helps! would even better delivered one hospital room collapsed tv covid. needs illegal stop immigration Atlanteans put end non-existent pandemic Moderna gang rise got call Astra Zeneca day went J&amp;J trial! 
For side effects Pfizer - slightly sore arm. 
Oh one gave Ron tracking number? /s Didnt Florida Texas kids school last school year though? Okay, back envelope math, let’s see help make make sense. 

You can’t spread don’t got it. vaccinated person still ~80-something-ish percent less likely get first place. 

With previous variants, even vaccinated people get 75% less likely contagious. Delta higher viral load thing, that’s thrown question somewhat, I’d willing bet we’re going find we’re still least *somewhat* less contagious. 

Otherwise healthy children still pretty low risk, comparatively. still don’t seem catching easily adults do. 

So, you’re looking 80% reduction all, unknown reduction risk transmissibility, low risk person. you’re asking go hug niblings, yeah, fo see family. miss you. I've reading US least different official sources reporting different official numbers. Also one knows live spend long time possibly life skirting death long hauler, constantly sick - hopefully lot that. think delta ripping places fast may actually see declining numbers fall. Israel Germany France already authorized boosters... considered high rate? parents really dumb endangering kids.

Latest data saw, 17850 18000 deaths unvaccinated (May 2021) US. Almost fully vaccinated deaths elderly.

Delta ravaging younger population. Don’t worry, anti vax Americans plentiful make sure Delta future opportunity change. Yeah lets forget ""mutations"" inconvenient. travel right, want go shopping? need rapid test?

In EU same, need PCR test around 100€. shopping rapid test required I’m really sorry you’re burnt out. career doesn’t suck it’s hard hear someone like describe like live Brazil's southernmost state (therefore one coldest) we've seeing deaths cases fall week week. instance, deaths fell 42% past two weeks cases hitting levels November 2020, pandemic pretty much control (until gamma came around). 60% state's population already received first dose almost 30% received second dose. Things looking better us right now.  That’s strange, couldn’t first person concerned. numbers I’ve read peer reviewed studies shows 80+% effective rate variant. seems really strange corporation funded study sudden shows half that. top that, even underlying study showing much better results particular article suggesting. feel like headline misleading. No, actually strong immune response runs amok. hypothesized cytokine storms reason otherwise healthy patients prior covid infections severity symptoms experiencing. sure ever proved out, lead theory hydrochloroquine would help immuno-suppressant qualities. Cytokine storms lead organ damage immune system overreacts documented previous illnesses.

As far tickle saying. Yes virus make spike protein fashion mRNA vaccines. uses RNA template spike proteins well host others replicating genetic material construct new viruses spread throughout body outside read 1st sentence wondering big deal actual bears teddies, read 2nd sentence oh.... course - anyone actually believes official numbers Iran, Russia, Mexico, etc bridge sell you.  offer something like daughter signed up. son nonverbal autistic needs different types therapy sessions. hope they’ll offer something classes non-traditional goes school special needs it’s little complicated. Last year sent things home every often mess little communication. don’t think really knew do. daughter nearly 6 son turned 9. daughter's school district sent texts/emails whenever case last year. Seemed like got texts every week, feel like year going worse Delta variant seeing masks longer required Michigan schools. Here’s fun one.

people vaccinated choice, tend downplay role covid, adhere restrictions. makes high risk contracting disease likely spread disease afterwards, since likely know unvaccinated people. Making costly reduces incentive get tested, turn prevents proper tracking containment outbreaks.

I definitely interested history (say, 20 years now) look back 2019-2021 time frame. 

It's probably going look pretty. Honestly think could stay friends so.eone like that. would hard time respect someone ignorant. Right, since kids count people?

/s Texas peak? Ironic reference ibuprofen, pretty dangerous counter drug, reference point. third booster dose almost certainly less risky popping ibuprofen pills week. Ibuprofen related family NSAIDs send 100,000 people year emergency rooms 16,000 deaths. Admittedly higher end abusive consumption it, ibuprofen hardly paragon safety we're talking ""off label"" consumption like third COVID shot. 

If vaccines caused kind carnage, would never approved. say two doses okay third dose untested, may right, idea two doses pretty much perfectly safe third dose potentially dangerous absurd really backed immunological science. 

Here's thing me: society going expect restrictions (CDC testing get back US, workplace testing travel, expectation self-quarantine meaningful exposure positive test), going everything protect myself. worried severe COVID (as fully vaccinated young..ish adult), worried disruption life: getting stuck overseas otherwise ""stuck"" somewhere tested positive. 50-75% efficacy (which probably Pfizer 6 months vaccination) enough protection virus R0 around 6 anyone feel safe life disruption. 

There *is* valid bioethics question giving booster doses people much impoverished world still trying get first dose. candidly think bit feel-good bullshit. Western world constantly spits face developing countries. could much investing clean water infrastructure, malaria prevention, HAART distribution, helping reduce childhood malnutrition COVID vaccinations. reality COVID big killer relatively youthful developing world. perhaps utilitarian perspective, I'm happy donate $1000 contribute causes get ""right"" get third dose, $1000 right causes would save lives single COVID shot. Smoking obese isn’t contagious. letting everyone know... nurses Covid right work fully vaccinated. Many also virus previously. Stay informed, vaccine proving effective right now. tough say, looks like it’s started move northward. southern states start peak i’ll less concerned long term prospects IMO, doses thrown away expiring physically cannot would go elsewhere safe individual, go it. 

These could used elsewhere, government ordering en-mass, it’s demand driving buy. wish first time people opting it, light current state affairs, it’s probably better throwing trash. Yeah that's feel. I'm vaccinated. mask safe really.   Imagine, redditor thinking social isolation GOOD thing. Yeah I'm vaccinated wife. family another country lol key listen find exact source hesitancy. difference anti-vaxxer hesitant. Many individuals realm latter.  


Just facts often enough change person's views, hesitancy stems lot knowledge deficit. mix cultural, psychosocial, spiritual, political, cognitive factors. 
Do know specific concerns are? recommended route motivational interviewing gain understanding behind hesitancy. helps identify exact area concern around vaccines target that. example, fear ingredients breaking down, infertility tackling avenue etc. Simply vaccinated yourself, continuing discussions providing ear likely working towards opting get vaccine. 
Here handy guide vaccine communication Relationships, Social Norms, Emotions Motivations sections particularly helpful gaining insight. nice neighbour share river with.  question would original trials include kids? revolver analogy bad, stats way off. 2 4% vaccinated people getting permanently disabled? 
For vaccinated people healthy immune systems, like 1000 revolvers, 100-round cylinders. There's single bullet across them. say ""let go"" mean ignore let believe want. people far asses insane. seen things post facebook?? losing battle, get vax'd pray vax passports become norm. Absolutely region, flu season 3 years ago good example.   Y’all insurance? Come Dewine. too. worse individual kid catches vs individual kid caught past variants. I’m sure science behind it, I’m also positive it’s science that’s causing “delay”. There’s entire world lacks vaccine access countries like US Canada gobble additional supplies, head unethical territory.

I note opinion we’re advised take third shot, fact. 

It’s completely bonkers people well-vaccine covered areas begging third fourth “booster” shots reality vaccinated incredibly well-protected is. can’t keep pumping vaccine hoping it’ll trick. downvoted? read yes, less mon vaxed. don’t know study terms maturity yet though. Dunno HIV one. original SARS.? Delta *might* peak next weeks cases dropping time come.

But ICU ERs probably still overrun.

I guess come, wear N95 indoors around big crowds. Dont rely Universal keep safe Disney far covid goes (according numerous reports seen). avoid ICUs/ERs. Hospitalization every age group 50 around highest point pandemic. Overall hospitalizations age groups 50 highly vaccinated. good business, funeral homes killing it. pun intended. see data yet. exactly release data timely, today's numbers may make clearer picture. Sg said thing two weeks ago, meh also putting peoples' lives stake. happens patients may need ICU bed non-Covid related reasons beds filled Covid patients?

I like thinking way, feel like eligible vaccine refused take it, lose bed another non-covid related emergency patient needs ICU care. feel conflicted thinking way, can't stand thinking someone else could die someone else's ignorant decision. vaccinated, kids, live close contact someone who's immunocompromised, generally considered low-risk good health, think I'd cancel plans. Let's hope they're right Delta mutate something worst. signs pointing virus already going endemic scenario, like said discussion. scientists also said Delta reign present future variants probably. pretty sure they've till data came in. I've heard nothing top. Stay house count lucky. crippled covid. worse death. Yes, Germany incidence high enough (35). Currently pretty low places, rising quickly. Dito. definitely need robust studies   Actually, numbers pretty line reported healthcare facility work at, fairly close Israeli data well.

ETA: I'm Florida It’s wanting protect yourself. It’s basically turning human lab rat unregistered self trial.

Acting guidelines paranoia fear, currently unjustified. That’s exact dumb behavior laugh anti-vax people. also make things worse, hear. recover won’t.  Well J&amp;J mRNA tech one dose let’s people choose qualities make appealing people. Whatever gets shots arms. Remember initially Fauci said even vaccine 50% effective would welcome J&amp;J better that. basically take headline swap certain states right sub.

There four articles row feed, three headline Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma.  title ""Reba's vaccine works should, preventing death hospitalization, able recover home fine!"" region, people supposed able transferred nearby We're talking health insurance car insurance. Learn read. Yes need prevalent less bureaucratic. 

Like app smartwatch. Impossible that's headed.    Teenagers right make medical decisions, even 16 years older? US federal law state law says this? Natural immunity worth something. know might good vaccine can’t completely useless. I’m hoping Delta actually ends speeding end pandemic

Not drinking United States way harder drinking is, especially us easily develop problems. last 3 months nobody wanted see vaccination status test result Germany understand would use analogy, also think need careful language totally accurate comparison. People already looking reasons discount say, even feels like nitpicking, accuracy matters. That's science works. Every single study includes ""and conclusion"". Whether conclusion true, determined later, results reproduced, preferably study accounts limitations described first study. No, meaning.

Grow up, don’t generalize broadly look ignorant af. state less 50% popular vote. again, exactly they? vaccinated people still able spread delta, unvaccinated test fly Hawaii (or quarantine 14 days still think?). 

To makes sense actually vaccinated people may bringing tested virus getting plane. people speading mostly unvaccinated people.

Yes, everyone vaccinated blah blah, unfortunately not. think fair say residents bringing in. Rather lack testing people, regardless vaccinated status, enter Hawaii

Edit: yes, definitely agrees re: self selection cautious people. definitely happening. gone anywhere since Dec. 2019 lol  talking bunch boomers think wearing helmet freedom. Oh no, reject vaccines. They’ll take free healthcare get. Well thanks getting it!!! :) No, yes Made chuckle :). upvote. Hospital staff breathe little easier…same goes anyone needing emergency care.

You die waiting crash, heart attack etc. Good times all.  Yes will, many countries track reach goal children able vaccinated. You’ve never paid table, even small job?

I straight don’t believe you.    one really knows data Israel. Data UK Canada support it. think exact efficacy difficult assess, especially real time. easy enough understand however compare breakthrough cases ""now"" opposed before, buttload vaccinated people now. yes going boatload breakthrough infections. They're still going X number times less frequent unvaccinated, mention regard severity obvious. FL/CDC data reporting issue weekend.

the long short it, FL reported chunk cases 3 days tune around 56k.

The CDC put 2 day total, put 2 days 28k, put 3 pay period. 

So messed FL numbers lot data trackers. CDC fixed issue yesterday put data correctly 3 day period. Poor Reba. feel bad hope stays strong. really funny hosted ACM Awards. much bet insurance companies America stop paying covering covid related injuries unvaccinated (obviously including medically exempt people)  Iran still medical embargo? *Very* hot get saying contracted 4 months getting second shot. Sometimes inevitable. They… fuck exactly they. didn’t vote this, nobody else know state either. like cocksucker spent 4 years white house, DeSantis state less 50% popular vote. guess felt way national response trump pres? got deserved country that’s ‘we’ voted for? That’s ignorant bullshit makes us progressive Floridians care less people like think. Don’t invalidate got chance score cheap points. Maybe things losing, yeah, know that's case. I'm confused ""freaking out"" number cases vaccinated individuals. year we've known vaccines reduce/minimize symptoms COVID-19, never said would prevent disease. vaccine gives body ability fight disease less symptoms. data shows that. Vaccinated people less severe disease vs unvaccinated.

Why would need booster thing? going magically prevent disease 3rd time around. keep going path we'll eventually booster # 25 years.

The solution seems simple...stay home get better symptomatic. There's need test vaxxed assuming minimal symptoms. Switch traveling nurse. Much pay except travel part fun.

Definitely false information—would re-look sources. children age 12 approved vaccinations. That’s 47 million children US alone. 
The vaccinated still certain percentage possibility infection. infected virus spread almost unvaccinated person.

Yes risk little lower get infected low enough make enough difference unvaccinated allow seperate treatment two groups.

Also vaccinated people also breeding ground new variants, unvaccinated

That's simply nowhere near enough avoid massive surge, unlike places huge number idiots never going get vaccine, fact first shots 72% total population shows buying weeks makes huge amount sense, hundreds thousands willing get second shot. replied comments someone above, (POTS Neurocardiogenic Syncope) I'd remiss try share information case could help you.

Think post-it note cells, that's discarded message acted on. vaccination, regardless mechanism, left immune memory. That's known decades surprises future years. 

But know effect Covid infection could later years. Think viral infections late consequences, decades later:

And im gonna fall moralist ""selfish"" argument anyway. look like backdate cases infected, would take high powered states lessen take whole average Meta analysis incorporated study Dr Elgazzar retracted  joke ;) sneaks you. That's one reason got bad Northeast, besides population density. time realized March 1st, already circulating couple weeks travelers returning Europe. Take NY statistical models, New York City already 600 COVID-19 cases mid-February, many 10,000 cases March 1.

The first confirmed cases across New England occurred March 1 close it. already first weeks playing catch try contain it. already late actually contain it. time hospitals seeing noticeable impact, already literally thousands cases avalanche starts. Makes complete sense. Absolutely. Mask mandates 2020 bought us time wait vaccines. 2021, kick infections road. repeatedly told vaccines way this. Despite this, thanks assholes won’t get it, still stuck.

I part. understand stores, wear mask go gym? It’s extremely uncomfortable. Typically people don’t realize ones don’t go gym.

I believe vaccines effective protect situations smaller, fully vaccinated groups people. Requiring masks vaccine-only areas undermines public confidence vaccines. “Why need mask vaccines work?”

I personally think issue another stimulus check tied vaccine status, digitally verified state databases. None fake card BS. lock 24 years took first vaccine administered declaration polio-free USA? Turns right, suppose. Yea know vaccine needs booster? gonna play craps. sounds like craps got point. yeah posted online could anyone....but lol putting deadline drop-add happen large scale. I’m South Africa currently using Pfizer. What’s likely lead wastage mismanagement incompetence.

that aside, link gave two weeks old louisiana list, unless count NA/NA/NA/NA/NA/NA/NA reporting

but aside ""NOTE: Hospitalizations deaths may include directly caused COVID-19, occurred fully vaccinated individuals diagnosed COVID-19. states collected data breakthrough COVID-19 deaths month included."" wait bit louisiana list. apparently CDC inkling 2 weeks ""decent"" 4 weeks somewhat accurate. point strict rule (vaccination required basically havr life) complete fick move restrictikns arent removed places. mean wear maska social distamce anyway ** vaccine exclusive place** whats point vaccine?

And say vaccinated person extremely favor setting vaccinr requirement *everything* . people seem addicted masks even see comments giving bad light vaccines favor masks, masks werw somehow effecrive absolutely ridiculous. dont understand sub, time ago people werenoutraged vaccinated peopke still wear masks. people seem rooting non ending rrstrictions *even vax exclusive places* hell. France Spain recorded equivalent 150,000 US cases today Yeah, glad grandparents aim 0 people getting polio anything. current place pass 50% total population 2 weeks.

Kids can't keep going like this. kids mental / social growth literally stunted years worth hard isolation sister cope with. live 2.5 acres land least other. can't fucking imagine single children, parents families living small apartments. 

Please. Let kids get vaccinated!  Mandatory vaccines everyone would basically eradicate COVID premise false. nurse acquaintance mine (former coworker wound leaving month apart) got first dose month. held ages would go away I'm sure finally took plunge. I'm glad another person know little cautious. Discussion relevant study here: know right thing do, refer experts safest path forward. Heroes. kind society doesn’t protect children? Vaccines work fine Lambda. Chuckles J&amp;J Why? wear god damn thing. people complain fucking bad things? dude, no. Nobody compared risk single car ride, mortality auto accidents usually compiled year. thing except costs $800 told head. cases blood clotting one vaccine enough people decide vaccine unsafe.

But 94k kids get COVID one week blown many people.  There's also matter college students still exist socialize party even school (not mention work public facing food service retail jobs). Possibly less, obvious much. College students returning concern communities host college, seems less averaged across country. Considering constantly kept revising number absolutely never thought could benevolent lie bit he’s since March 2020 Uptake still high Ireland too, vaccine become widely available last 2 weeks still easy countries like US walk anywhere get it. also started 12-15 year old kids week give another bump numbers. Booster shots risk starting fall. What's unfortunate still high amount cases restrictions compared countries, hopefully ease soon doubt seeing we're heading winter cases expected go up. I'll take hypothetical 50:50, add is, hypothetically, mostly age-group 90% vaccinated. 

That would mean smallish town 2000 pensioners, 1800 pensioners vaccinated, 200 not. 20 people die Covid, half vaccinated half weren't, would mean 10 1800 vaccinated died (= 0.55%), 10 200 unvaccinated died (= 5%).

Which shows 50:50 really mean 50:50 real-life terms. Bloomberg estimating 739,114 doses given per day. assumption, it'd take less 2 days cover 1 million number. definitely booster uptake. “However, one still far effective — Moderna 76 percent, Pfizer 42%. study conducted among 50,000 patients.

It currently known whether drop effectiveness result Delta’s ability bypass vaccine, erosion protection offered time, combination factors.” nice problem have? Fire all. guarantee it. think many waiting full FDA approval.  Valid points analysis ignores evolutionary pressure. non-vaccinated population going create evolutionary pressure vaccine-resistance way partially vaccinated population does. 

The population US smaller we're creating environment likely create variant vaccine resistance, similar bacteria evolves drug resistance complete round antibiotics. 

If happens lot current vaccine stock could either much less effective straight useless. problem variants ""one day"" territory -- Delta variant mutation happened like 9 months pandemic started. end goal, think light Delta variant, getting sufficient worldwide immunity spawning new strains every 5 minutes. Even Kentucky putting mask mandate place schools Quebec oh kids aren’t affected much all. looked many countries. (But clearly one directly south us?!) Intranasal vaccines multiple advantages. don’t require syringes, cutting expense vaccination amount medical waste immunization program generates. vaccine puffed nostril probably doesn’t require health care professional administer it; oral polio vaccine used many developing countries dripped mouths children trained intranasal vaccines — theory, anyway — easier administer children people phobia needles. CyFair chose issue mandate. disappointed read announcement even offering virtual learning K-6. 

IMO, districts banding together taking stand Abbott. declare virus illegal alien deport all. power CCP win. Requiring aid federal government, hmm idk sounds like socialism me.

/s  Wrong. Dead wrong. current vaccines aren’t effective enough preventing symptoms stopping transmission. suggesting 100% population magically vaccinated tomorrow, virus would suddenly disappear become eradicated? can’t position. That’s stunningly simplistic view, it’s almost frightening. 

Also, COVID animal reservoirs continually ensure new outbreaks time. Also, many people cannot vaccine, variety reasons. would still catch virus, spread others, vaccines aren’t perfect, spread would continue. lesser pace, yes, eradicated? No. Also, mandatory vaccines unlikely happen US least. so, many reasons you’re wrong, it’s daunting even try list them. obviously spring 2020. fairly decent last summer too. pain come fall winter wave. We'll see goes weeks schools start here. districts either start week Labor Day week Labor Day.

Shame confidence keep post up. I'd love hear OP considers victory. definitely are, especially states fully vaccinated 70%+ residents. Delta mutation contagious remaining 30 50% pulling hospital system them. Ppl fully vaxxed hardly hospitalized paying price covidiots refusing get shots. We're literally held hostage limbo stage. poor argentinians, vaccinated cat urine  You...can't see type spread could make way states?

The site linked says estimate, taking fact confirms priors? says virtually every state ""likely increasing."" get caught though. Can't ask docs true understand. person would incriminate themselves. It’s cool bar. I’ve there. Hope bars start requiring this. base mass cull much deadlier pandemic occurs.

Covid-19 appetizer.

I know Canada preparing. example, $ Moderna manufacturing plant. Canada wait several additional months get vaccines. Well said.  NY peaked people! NY peaked. click probably start spying  sinopharm know cat urine mean, I’ve wearing mine whole time, won’t deny hate it. hate sweaty makes face, hate remember bring one thing, hate fogging glasses it’s humid.

I especially hate gym- also think it’s necessary sadly. I’ve stopped weightlifting can’t stand it, sticking swimming.

If everyone vaccinated I’d massively less concerned wearing, though maybe moment delta.

I can’t wait get point don’t wear mask anymore, I’ll still wearing it. require students get vaccinated. Problem solved It’s simple get free vaccine pay price mutations change spike *that* much, able bind ACE2 anymore either, rendering mutation rather moot. docs want get talk kidney side effects?

I remember really panicked saw myocardits stuff (dats second dose!) learning myocarditis, long monitored, usually big deal. sounds like could similar: inflammation organ also occur garden variety infections. right here? Fuck, fuck, fuck articles like this. ethical say Delta bad news kids then, article, say there’s evidence Delta menace kids? fuck  15% far total percentage cases among Honestly civilian population places like 17 people don’t stop old hotel literal portal hell. like gonna get from.   Yep. 

Thing serious illness make go autoimmune. Post viral autoimmune disease unusual.

The deaths reported disability enough focus. Plus hospitalized severe go autoimmune especially COVID19 Delta.
In case severe respiratory distress syndrome lungs full shadows. Exactly. antivaxxers throwing around “X% survival rate” make nuts. Survival everything coming unscathed long covid something like woman neurological effects won’t seen years.   great ideas can’t lunch class outside it’s 100 degrees sub zero. think vaccine mandated teachers fda approval. goes kids. Masks mean time. suggestions good ideas may feasible due budget/climate. Btw worked 12-13 year old said wouldn’t get vaccine… point mandated thr 12+ wave set time summer wave set last year receding Sept Oct, saw another pick explode holidays. think wave starting soon make us complacent late fall winter given things went last year unless see massive spikes vaccinations, even need 6+ weeks two doses get full coverage puts us right doorstep fall holiday activity. talk people usually say something like got shots want life go back normal. can't really blame that. Congrats, that's exciting. Could good getting hard times hopefully get easier here.   Shouldnt make much difference, even vaccine efficinecy drops gradual since rollout gradual. sudden drops unless another variant pops unlikely since us vax'd.

I've also realized know way much man need move lol. Wow, first thanks reply incredibly well put. would definitely say hit nail head bringing past experiences. past bad injections also family shot help think unconscious fear there. Additionally, thoughts like can't drive, can't breathe crazy side effect. reading actually thought head lol... working minimizing best work fears causing avoidance. Currently sitting work planning get shot leave. Page found. im sure went wrong.  I'm way trying sound callous, deadly pandemic sweeping globe several years going lot bad consequences. One lots deaths. Another lots crippling health aftereffects. Another economic dislocation lost businesses. Another stress fear. Another delayed education career plans. Nothing going easy painless. 

This whole thing frigging tough. need support much get it. Styx literally played town weekend. Small show admittedly, outside. Well see South Carolina from.. lot people got shots nursing homes government facilities I’d shocked effective way mantainjng data.. could always say vaccinated another state. would seem like question ask one fill significant portion, could lie especially hospital setting, feel like could preached bad choices get 3rd dose? state database, permitted get third shot. go get 3rd shot, check records. even one lies, find vaccination happened previously refuse.

The way figure getting 3rd shot someone using fake ID going overseas. Yes common feel bad 24 hours second dose. It’s nothing though, compared Covid. Congrats getting vaxed. kind dangerous thinking. Impact factor ""sexy"" true unless talking fake predatory journals. Nobody says ""if total synthesis characterization actually true would Science instead JACS"". I'm vengeance, want friends family kids catch COVID-19 someone die. kids catch COVID-19 someone die, direct power anyone. state imposes ""its will"" lot things, lot less dubious impact gun regulations lack thereof, I'm sure fair use example comparison issue. indirect, catch COVID-19 another person Covid. last person die say last breath, ""at least impose die onto others""? Well least restaurants make conscious decision enter like risk level.  buildings designed earthquake resiliency like California. would unmitigated disaster affecting Oregon, Washington, probably parts Idaho British Columbia.

Not mention dams Columbia fail catastrophically ^ Humor time ~~cholera~~ covid...respect... silver lining Canada's disability systems accept post-viral ME/CFS diagnosis, presumably extend long covid extent different. doctors large clueless diagnose treat patients. point _really_ want know compares deaths flu common diseases. agree you, public health officials spent majority pandemic warning people dangers long covid - including telling people even mild case could lead unknown long term health issues - probably many people low tolerance risk. 

It's want us forget everything told us dangers even mild bout covid. That's tough sell. don’t get vaccinated doesn’t make stupid moron. happy everybody choose want get vaccinated stay way. 2 B vaccinated, yet think “don’t enough data”. It’s incredible think it. don’t think it’s possibly helpful thing say? don’t know you’d think that’s something people don’t already realize. “No, Skippy: said got “B” Statistics, “be” statistic!” Appreciate article. I'm trying handwave away - think news articles like one we're discussing disservice real dangers covid.

The Comparison flu makes sense - fact people severe COVID illness likely encephalitis makes calm even more. means children, seeing less symptoms general, able manage disease general, getting severe side effects older obese people are, also see less likelihood encephalitis.

All might go shit schools back session - hopefully masking small bandaid majority vaccinated. counties where's worse requiring masks — allowed state Newsom, opposed GOP governors.

And requirements vaccinations testing state employees, teachers, hospital workers. aware transmission path virus is? simply adding ventilation automatically disperse particles safe level inch mouth? Great. Thanks sharing trying convince wife weeks get (currently 33 weeks). finally asked doctor said it. situation South definitely pushed message lot faster though.

She waiting birth, huge point contention due fears ""unknown side effects"" (yes know). 

Frankly I'm thankful worrying last month hopefully pushes people get it.   post false information, so, thanks?  Ha Vermonter - shy 85%

We love need Canadian friends though. Sometimes wish would get annexed Canada, lol could find interviews? almost crazy bordering parody.  Mine uses condom Can't seem find information whatsoever One way think either staying unvaccinated getting vaccinated incur risks.

Federal health officials Wednesday bolstered recommendation pregnant people vaccinated Covid-19, pointing new safety data found increased risk miscarriage among immunized first 20 weeks gestation.

Earlier research found similarly reassuring data vaccinated later pregnancy.

Until now, Centers Disease Control Prevention said vaccine could offered pregnancy; recent update guidance strengthens official advice, urging pregnant people immunized.

The new guidance brings C.D.C. line recommendations made American College Obstetricians Gynecologists medical specialty groups, strongly recommend vaccination.

“At time, benefits vaccination, known risks Covid pregnancy high rates transmission right now, outweigh theoretical risks vaccine,” Sascha R. Ellington, epidemiologist leads emergency preparedness response team division reproductive health C.D.C.

The risks Covid-19 pregnancy well-established, said, include severe illness, admission intensive care, needing mechanical ventilation, preterm birth death.

So far, limited data birth outcomes, added, since vaccine available since December. small number pregnancies followed term identified safety signals.

Pregnant women included clinical trials vaccines, uptake shots low among pregnant women. majority pregnant women seem reluctant inoculated: 23 percent pregnant women received one doses vaccine May, recent study found.

Dr. Adam Urato, maternal-fetal medicine specialist Framingham, Mass., counsels patients vaccine almost daily, said pregnant women wary exposure synthetic chemicals want solid scientific evidence vaccines safe.

What shitshow. ""Did force everyone go act irresponsible"" - no, never made everyone go back 'normal'. penalizing anyone making personal, healthy choices. Kids teachers still wear masks. Extra credit assignment?.. wear mask.

""Deny getting vaccinated, force kids public schools"", no... no. never stopped people making educated, smart choice getting vaccinated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*    None big rich lunatics still NYSE floor lol, internet trading era I’m surprised Newsom hasn’t required mask mandate bad it’s getting. personally wish would. It’s simple noninvasive thing, entirely backed data. Yeah I'm supposed going month I'm low key stressing. work home able avoid exposing people get back I'd feel guilty still  Holy fuck bad. can’t believe even children getting ill hospitalized doesn’t make anti vaxxers get shot.

If you’re still anti vax seeing you’re straight terrible person, want nothing you. article basically says think protection rather prevention virus - infection. Essentially prevent hospitalizations deaths vaccine also reduces infections, it’s plus Correct, still enough make conclusions. Observational studies showed Hydroxychloroquine effective. RCTs failed show that. We're also forgetting Delta significantly contagious. someone help understand difference likelihood getting
COVID unvaccinated versus fully vaccinated? difference likelihood needing hospitalzation? Thanks really calling 3+ week old post? 

Absolutely. youre going ignore canary coalmine, held accountable posting false information. Hey, thanks reply definitely helps put ease more. know likely rational fear, none less one. agree probably best get vaccinated end day never know covid dice roll seems. Yeah, good. I’m actually career changer, too. got first full time gig. don’t report building though. Remote. Thank god Start position good reason afraid vaccine, even present tense. something past makes worried? *one* past present? Examples: handle sick, even vaccine side-effects? handle needles? strong anti-vaxxers life, feel defying them? careful minimize way; keeping fears away ashamed paradoxically gives power, result kind paralysis avoidance.

You also imagine process getting vaccine, end-to-end. Take every fear hesitation seriously, even something silly like ""What person giving vaccine rude?"" ""What get side-effects fast can't drive/walk home?"" Work outline contingency plan everything comes mind, work follow-up fears far need to. example, worried severe side-effects, say okay, get severely sick afterwards, guess means I'm day two. means I'll couch, maybe even stuck bed. eat? Well, buy food advance need much preparation. can't even leave bed? I'll tell friend may need help advance, call do. miss work? I'll tell manager advance I'm getting vaccinated when. I'm super bored I'm tired anything? I'll add shows Netflix queue. on, longer feel afraid.

This stuff works really well fears serious silly. hope helps you! Sounds delicious. I’ll take half dozen.  Anyone wants run 2024 needs anticipate Trump going fuck around race. need get name public Trump still neutered. dont think Trump run everyone want endorsement going highest bidder. However, Trump going play game really decide going even picks someone dont surprised 180 picks someone else. Well disagree you. guess perfect test would exposure virus J&amp;J Moderna test Moderna completely stopped individual getting infected. 

The study Moderna's efficacy vs Delta several limitations data. would wait longer term results. 

Again anecdotal, work office setting travel lot. Cannot work home all. Recently colleagues exposed several individuals Covid infected. get symptoms never tested positive. Similar lot colleagues. However 2 people test positive mild symptoms. Pfizer think.  exposed way. downvoted yes, talk doctor medicine taking pregnant, would include vaccine. However, bad doctors dont tell get this. Surely dozen; least many word ""Ethics"" title, know read those... *Not paywalled, y'all read lengthy comments easier entire articles.*  

In order best protect students staff California starts school year fully in-person, California Department Public Health (CDPH) today issued new public health order requiring school staff either show proof full vaccination tested least per week.

“To give parents confidence children safe schools return full, in-person learning, urging school staff get vaccinated. Vaccinations end pandemic,” said Governor Newsom. “As father, look forward start school year seeing California kids back classroom.”

The new policy school staff take effect August 12, 2021, schools must full compliance October 15, 2021. Robust free testing resources available K-12 schools the CA K-12 schools testing program. Sadly fear you’re right. It’s going rough. I’ll best, thank kind thoughts.  think they're called ""extras"". Teddy wants Zodiac Killer bad Gross acog gross. 

My wife recommended freaking April wait second trimester get it. got fully vaxxed 2.5 months. 

Such shit. that's case come see lot kids hospitalized covid last year. People denial phase regarding increased risk new variant Missed digit, actually 10th powers delegated United States Constitution, prohibited States, reserved States respectively, people.

Just Federal government cannot reverse FL TX mask mandate ban, cannot ban states making mask mandate. already know Jacobson v. Mass states power implement vaccine mandates. I'm Canada EVERYONE pregnant recommended TDAP flu. 

Your OBGYN really going grain fields medical advice. mean masks aren’t coming back though. vast majority country. I’m Michigan one wears indoors anymore. I’m extremely skeptical lockdowns either (thankfully). sent Mid 20s, vaccinated, probably bars restaurants weekend neighboring, surging state. Definitely intermingling strangers there. nightclubs anything like though. clarified referencing news sources. Ooh, although recent one: posits much lower efficacy.

Whereas UK high efficacy studies significantly larger groups people heavily sequencing Covid cases. Something strange least one datasets.

Edit: UK's study comparison 

&amp;#x200B;

And bonus Canadian study supports UK's study's conclusions: Lol, see, outed yourself. brought politics need to. Go Facebook. find like minded people there. bad anti vax, completely opposite way. Oh god, hope recover, quickly. Sorry Ron, do. made bed, lie it. covered blood. people say shot especially painless going compared others. may soreness second shot needle. Hell yeah. agree more. Dang... keeps getting sadder accurate so, so, sorry. cannot even imagine going that. hope therapy talking someone this. imagine 1 ICU bed time yes. wish dysautonomic responses anyone. I've suffered many years sad others dealing. hope leads more/better responses potentially cures. Standing causes pulse rise BP drastically fall (POTS) miserable that's one manifestation it. Lol asshole.. age/location whether attendees vaxxed up. Keep mind 40 getting covid like mild/moderate cold fully vaxxed. also depends like getaway/retreat, huge raging party strip Vegas. going intermingling strangers, yeah high risk. golf retreat swank resort totally different story. start triaging patients. People severe illness die less severe likely survive. Fuuuuuck.... truth fuckin' hurts. Bet tax payer picks bill long run too. Russia China Concur. Florida definitely winning- top Leaderboard sure. Wait it.... Yeah…should changed conservatives. Thx it! I'm 35 weeks currently, first dose 26 weeks second last week. Baby healthy kicking side effects pfizer, peace mind! Gotta get clicks. Media got reliant reporting Trump tweets instead actual journalism. fearmongering COVID well vaccine rollout new strategy. read article? UK. one early July - although report health ministry hospital worried it’s morgue overflowing, getting refrigerated trailers additional storage, like done NY last year.  I’m picturing Fauci Marlon Brando-Godfather impression makes Florida offer can’t refuse. That’s I’m thinking - wave less bad combination vaccines natural immunity. Makes sense really depends virus unknown  70 cases isn’t you’d call large spike. Tell make own. want dependent federal government! Especially JOE BIDEN! Wow I’ve never seen sub dip right People already lost jobs. Even smallest hotels operating reduced capacity. There’s whole lot tourism jobs lost right now. economy shifted LOT last 18 months. utility fishing agriculture jobs? ones make possible anyone live here? require inter-island travel. We’ll survive without Tim Beverly Arkansas. survive power plant workers stranded quarantine hotels. agree, don’t mean say virus anything personal kids, instead kids vulnerable before.  people getting shot good. Also, still likely lot people variant never Covid. think combination delta infecting pretty much anyone unvaccinated vaccinated already delta could mean future waves could less severe

It’s theoretical though would better case scenario Totally someone actually quoting total number beds isn’t number look at. Dallas area less 100 beds 8 million people right now. Austin think 2 almost 2 million. guess point we’re really huge delta two numbers. Certainly Dallas little better right now, much. situation could easily change time takes move ten patients Austin Dallas. 70 beds 8 million, probably don’t want give 10 admission average 30 day. don’t know Dallas’s is, 30 Tarrant County’s rate days ago Dallas easily 2 3x that. I'm surprised think UK sensible, seeing restrictions gone nightclubs beaches things actually make life enjoyable freely available now. 

We could enjoyed UK US ""individualistic"" actually barely functional government. Ok, Georgia please.   People die. bus crashes now, won’t enough staffed beds won’t enough time send elsewhere, still assuming transport available.

Edit: even disregarding Covid patients requiring ICU care keep coming. short: people die. There's enough us already vaccinated pregnant women confirm safe, babies healthy. data shown well. worth risk it. Third. Missouri deserves place top two opposed Florida? WTF poll relatively recently implied 27 percent 6-11 would get it, 27 would 46 sure. Tents Yeah Sunday Monday numbers exactly seemed likely error made.  Open beds != enough staff. case since long covid, obviously gotten worse. less 15 minutes think considered substantial contact requiring quarantine -- least, case pre-Delta, know changed. could've passed bathroom hallway seconds, suppose.

Asking peditarician sounds smart, though. know can't keep changing rules get new variants new knowledge old variants. real reason believe would've worse without shots? Sure, lower hospitalizations unless high risk group, make symptoms mild?

I'm coming exactly talking about. bad diarrhea Saturday, felt Sunday, Monday night throat felt terrible today feel terrible around, like crappy cold though far nothing concerning yet. Breathing, smell taste fine least.

Got second vaccine June 6th.

Pretty pissed appears got breakthrough infection literally first time high risk activity (nightclub). know test comes guess. even better question is, would anyone post Facebook “Mr. KingGiroux vaccinated” when, result vaccine mandate Mr. KingGiroux claims favor of, *Mr. KingGiroux school staff would vaccinated condition employment, fact would matter public record would certainly conveyed parents?*

Edit: second glance, appears question essentially yours, words Florida needs thoughts prayers. Thoughts Prayers. It’s possible. combination immunity vaccines natural infection thanks Delta could mean it’s last major wave. Theoretically, future waves - less severe immune system know fight virus more. Basically, Delta almost guarantees didn’t get Covid last year, get vaccinated

More people getting vaccinated that’s good thing likely it’s causing cases kids transmissibility, kids 12 can’t vaccinated. Lack precautionary measures aren’t helping won’t help school starts.

So evolving specifically attack kids? No. variant getting people aren’t vaccinated. Kids included population. Big difference.  another Israeli one published recently?

According [article Israeli study conducted earlier year Alpha strain prevalent. data come December 2020 April 2021 — time massive vaccination drive Israel competing surge cases driven Alpha.

I found 2 become predominant strain first case Delta early April 2021."" moms post moms group FB something like this. 

Their kids lost taste sense altered taste. Nothing feels won’t eat. It’s sad, it’s is. know many people I've heard personally went partied Florida came back it. Lots. happens things really get bad rest us states need ventilators? course state that’s negligent whole time gets 🙄 ethically can't deny treatment. mean us vaccinated foot bill. need $10k $20k surcharge covidiots played Russian roulette lost. costing us $$$ additional medical care, taking away needed treatment suffering major illnesses like strokes &amp; cancer. It’s like they’re really quintupling “let’s still go natural herd immunity try make sure everyone gets least once, hopefully once”. least it’ll providing lot interesting data... would good party majority state legislature. data coming Mayo clinic suggests effective Delta. Worse Flu shot. Trump massive rallies peak pandemic vaccine available. masks sight.

Reminds something read 1918 pandemic. young person’s immunity goes overdrive causes die within 24 48 hrs exposure (disclaimer: I’m scientist sources hand). I’m sad say expecting though. Lol, right. [CDC seems like great reason undergo medical procedure. ""dont think, TV said so"" doubt states collect information. might need that. much negative press COVID nowadays… Several states schools open months now.  “As Saturday, 44.4% Texans fully vaccinated.” Sad. handing say ""I'd like favor though..."" honestly hate fucking cynical, bitter, angry pandemic made me. don’t want think I’m smarter anyone level schadenfreude seeing states get burned bad are. I’m angry vengeful asshole, feel getting worse day. Trying adopt James O’Brien’s saying, “contempt conmen, compassion conned,” it’s hard. depends another contagious variant whether remaining stragglers vaccinated (and unscathed Delta) decide get shots. Keep mind South experienced huge surge mainline strain last summer would think would confer degree immunity. cases still piling ER's ICU's there. long periods time maybe, short term? site sources? sounds suspiciously oversimplified me. 3 percent infects, vaccine, total people far, far less. Even one person tragedy, still think worth it. could set us failure next pandemic, though may already lost science battle here. depressing couple years. way You’re protected you’re going get happens ICU beds full? ship patients states? welcome. saw this, think enjoy it; also like me, 1.2 speed better. Prove it? new situation need open minds. could wrong, evidence see week suggests world delta causing high rates cases among kids. Maybe due changing practices, maybe main factor. don’t claim total confidence ideas happening, don’t think either ideas horseshit. virus changes, prefer ‘change’ ‘mutate’ ‘evolve’, sure, pay close attention changes. didn’t really cause spike last time  base getting smaller smaller hope.... would one way encourage people US get vaccinated. districts want masks suing there's stick? malicious intent.  pharmacies access states immunization registry verify whether got shot already? get feeling told wrong building adamantly stubbornly refused believe wrong, continued storm wrong building? COVID patients usually vent 60 plus days? sure average time survivor vent 60 days seems quite bit.   what, Texas individuals happen worse less responsible than, say, Vermont individuals?  Desantis ask vents game works, mean popular Floridians? is, majority Florida approves doing. How? yesterday, new record daily cases today, new record 7 day average cases well. schools state tmk full throttle week, icu beds/staff morning.

Well, last night mutual friend person told passed away due covid, early 20’s.   Closer 4 hours. Texas big state think going somewhat regional...all surges super similar regionally last year. think Northeast surge Fall Winter. It'll less bad surges though. ever run office slogan, ""There saviors, us."" might alienate evangelical vote, plenty positions would eliminate anyways. worship stuff ridiculous prevents anything actually improving. can't cite sources, common theory. Viruses tend become less deadly time deadly opposition survival virus.

The severe virus is, countermeasures taken less successful is. Look Ebola. Zaire strain, fatality rate spectacularly lethal. outbreaks, highly transmittable asymptomatic. tends spread shedding blood, bodily fluids, new-bodily-fluids-that-used-to-be-organs. such, highly containable identified. outbreaks were, many cases, intimate-space funerals loved ones.

He’s gov Kentucky “He’s short age, don’t ask he’s self conscious it.” - motioning four year old claiming he’s 13.  hear traveling nurses right get paid lot more. That's one reason. think nurse doctor I'd last, even huge pay increase. can't imagine people truly believe science deal much misinformation. flipside people want vaccine hospitalized, can't late wind dying. mental health would take big hit watching people die over. can't imagine ever gets really easy normal times. Now? much. True...but US whole never open either...the past months festivals, concerts, bars restaurants open almost every state...all things considered, current surge great also bad considering everything pretty much open. actual fuck wrong people?

In midst global pandemic, things could do, empowered make meaningful changes in, want pass legislation objectively cause harm?

I'm pretty sure I'm wrong though. proof insurrection. Tons conjecture, literally proof. arrested. saying good way rile liberals without needing actually provide evidence.

Edit: never said nothing bad. 

1. Public trespassing federal grounds pre planned reduction security.

2. completely opposite response blm protest something similar.

3. president getting people riled bs claim voter fraud proof.

4. People hurt killed  It’s jobs hotels tours, restaurants small businesses barely getting by. wouldn’t want see people called back job lose due another lockdown homeless.

Also much COVID spread Hawaii locals aren’t vaccinated. needed wave school year. Remember takes weeks effective.

Once finally it, going inundated stories vaccines don’t work kids (or worse, vaccines infect kids) getting sick week first shot infected classmates school immunity built. Water wet Empathy important regardless actions taken others. hard, right. Someone needs tell Rand Paul that. Guys idiot! They'll use hallway space transform wings must. can't instantly increase staffing there's limit do. next step triage people highest chance survival get treated first. Service quality definitely go staff gets overwhelmed exhausted. Yes, lot weird denialism going here. Send body bags like Navajo Reservation. seems really simplified.

Some virulent mask opponents last couple months fully vaccinated, forcefully disparaged need wear masks anymore personally insulted suggested go wearing case vaccines perfect.

These people seem changing tune bit now, relieved see. remember vaccine mostly diluent inside vial. smallest known amount produce appropriate immune response healthy animal. amount diluent really based stability future may less, could more, reason pursue changing unless longer functional. producing covid vaccines find studies MRNA rabies research veterinary medicine. mental room really absorb research like normal interesting. Children get infected adults give kids. younger children around adults time. That's important adults get vaccinated. infected teacher may give student, student infects friends. parents, parents vaccinated, that's potentially wind orphan. many people chosen unvaccinated?

I'm saying pandemic done. I'm saying there's nothing else conclude it, unless get vaccinated. Anything like masking lockdowns temporary stopgap draw out. Hopefully I’m getting political it’s ironic DeSantis thought COVID policies would help run President it’s totally backfired. take public health seriously don’t make yet another thing divides country! hard. hate see what’s happening exposes politicians actually care responsible sensible government that’s silver lining. background, masters degree mathematics.

The metric sensible one. shit tonne problems. probably measures thing youre trying measure best simple test. Remember handed tbe public.

Youre actually right noise issue state. anyone hospital care home get tested significantly average amount.

I doubt get real uptake 3rd dose unless deadly variant emerges scares people getting it. turn tables know rest.  need explain article explains rather well. know simple comforting certain group people blame everything, think outdated thinking.

With Delta variant particular, looks like managed somewhat escape current vaccines. Around 20% new cases vaccinated people, beginning look like vaccinated people contagious unvaccinated ones get infected. Fortunately, current vaccines seem pretty good job reducing severity symptoms, good reason get vaccinated. getting vaccinated apparently end story.

Just blaming Bubba Deplorastan problems neither fair correct. Getting vaccinated pregnancy breastfeeding lot him, I'm sure. vaccines recommended pregnancy already purely protection give baby first day exposed world--it's effective measure protection. remember getting flu shot TDAP last trimester pregnancies feeling happy proud something profoundly protective could babies even born. source doesn’t support assertion Sturgis rally caused large spike Covid cases last year. one hand, don’t deserve free tests. hand, refusing provide free testing increases probability highly vulnerable subjects won’t get tested, creates risk rest population.  ran zoo, I’d provide free testing.

RemindMe! 2weeks. virus infects presymptomatically like covid surely less impetus become less deadly. transmits large degree even sickens host, deadliness factor selection, right?

All reasons viruses evolve along lines seem really apply covid. hard fast rule. Number one, learn read. nice idea, may giving us much credit. We're small state largest elderly population. likely driving vaccination rates. nurse doctor risking life 
Under long stressful hours save unvaccinated People, yea might quit I’m going link it, yes, there’s evidence symptoms much less severe vaccinated. I’m overweight, correlates highly bad outcomes, yes, suspect vaccine helped. I’ll never know sure, odds high. anecdotally, doctor friend Texas says they’ve breakthrough cases stop light symptoms, ones hospitalized unvaccinated hospital. Good. Cytokine Storm ? Sorry don’t houses. enough work. stick commercial.


Next time you’re Disney, walk Stars Wars park. built it, along many hospitals Florida: Cleveland Clinic Mt Sinai Mayo Clinic.

Have great day bud. Hope gets better you. Strawman meet strawman. You’re mess bad logic buddy Apparently said they’re ok paying fine. Could someone shed insight Florida’s cases got astronomically high? I’ve heard lot DeSantis’s leadership, curious ways manifested produce numbers seeing now. rapid accelerated rise unprecedented,"" University Florida Health Shands CEO Ed Jimenez said MSNBC. hospital, 90 percent patients unvaccinated, said. Stupid evil Define “a lot” /u/leaky_wand saying “nurses” total joke. last year - long wait? That’s really sad. Kids go school, catch covid, bring home orphan themselves. I'm waiting covid test results woke intense sore throat someone double vaxxed since June, I'm going feeling pretty pissed got breakthrough infection literally first time something high risk, go nightclub weekend.

Means vaccine essentially nothing perspective. Likely caught first time exposed it. worry, still somehow averaging 43 cases per 100,000 US 38...     
EDITL: note deaths lower .13 vs .17 US Yeah, really put perspective me. roughly 100,000,000 people without immunity, would take almost 3 years 9 months everyone group catch COVID 100,000 cases per day purely group. 

I think that’s mind boggling. 60, 70, 80% immunity sounds great consider massive even 20% US population is. 

Crazy. issue last year could written replaced two years one year. Next year someone going write 3, likelihood covid still us. 

It doesn’t sound like you’re saying take break social life anymore. don’t think music festival particularly extreme. Outdoors it’s probably less dangerous crowded bar. 

I’m fine giving little bit, five years ago would small thing me. Tbh tho, wasnt prevailing ""wisdom"" time? parents used read older childrens books often would watch old tv shows really young, remember kids books movies getting measles chicken pox treated huge joke plotline characters. 

Imagine parent 1970s kid dying measles turning around see sitcom making fun girls face looks like sponge front crush dumb brother give *cue laugh track* always ""acceptable"" level loss society- pretend otherwise denying history. 

Even recently- despite vaccines, thousands die ""regular flu"" every year- yet also joke flu groan ""every year whole office calls sick week"", ""kids germ factories son went one birthday party everyone house looked like girl exorcist week"" ""my MIL tough old broad, flu finally got 101!""- imagine sounded someone lost someone important flu? Like... actually probably accepted loss freak accident endgame persons previous condition, like flu+cancer, old, etc. Eventually, Covid that, too. Lol, 90+% masking compliance last year, 60% vaccinated support it. You’re already losing. Yeah, I'm sure are. half ran OB/gyn Target talked us. told baby’s gender (we found geneticist day before) asked talked kids.

According WBTV, receive recommendation Supposed possibly go work next month, December. F that, way I'm getting plane theory half doctors (who scientists, strictly speaking) saying take jab, kinda makes question narrative ""scientists agree vaccine safe."" Even amongst doctors scientists, consensus.   unvaccinated transferred wfh jobs, right?

Right? failure rates suggest. also failure rates vaccine. rates breakthrough infection much lower ""extra careful"". Sure, know ""long term"" effects vaccine. also know long term effects COVID, we're starting least see medium-term effects. Major organ damage, disability, reduced endurance energy every day tasks. Given vaccine heavily vetted, still go many tests EUA prove efficacy safety, benefits outweigh risks. doctor say otherwise irresponsible.   Thank post! smart knowledge truly invaluable. Keep good fight! Oh man. feel you. Many NICU friends went home vent g-tube. It’s work. It’s something people can’t even imagine. much training. first week home worst. “Is baby desating airway blocked pooping?” many false alarms. much fear uncertainty…and nurses help.

What’s daughter’s timeline trach removal? Anytime soon? oxygen airway support?

It’s crazy, start pandemic good. started giving everything spiraled. still don’t support him. fact still hasn’t figured insane. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* VAERs accept kind report, awful trying look rare side effects allow abused. Notably, there's lot reports drownings car accidents one report somebody turning hulk (that one obviously shed light availability Sinovac vs. Pfizer Southeast Asia, I'd like lay Malaysia's Covid-19 vaccine procurement went along:

Last November, Malaysia signed first vaccine agreement Pfizer 12.8 million doses. time, Malaysian government increased order Pfizer vaccines. January, doses ordered increasing total 25 million. Malaysia signed even Pfizer March, making total 32 million doses. May doses ordered yet again, increasing Malaysia's total order Pfizer vaccines 44.8 million doses.

For Sinovac, January, government ordered total 12 million doses.

Those doses ordered. doses actually delivered?

By end June, 5 million doses delivered Pfizer. However, since last month Pfizer stepped deliveries end July, 10 million doses delivered.

Sinovac? end July, 12 million doses ordered since January delivered. Again, 100% doses ordered January delivered July.

So Malaysian government clearly ordered Pfizer vaccines earlier, Sinovac one actually delivered earlier.

From way see it, now, third quarter year, Pfizer able increase deliveries Pfizer prioritising supply richer countries like US EU early part year. course, US EU rich able place bets ordering vaccines earlier ordering way enough doses populations. What's more, Pfizer vaccine manufactured there. case EU, vaccine developed BioNTech Germany received funding German government. wonder rich countries got first dibs doses produced. goes show hard developing countries compete richer ones.

While 44.8 million doses Pfizer arrived end year, Malaysia's Covid-19 cases, ICU admissions deaths reaching record highs NOW. Malaysia needs vaccinate much population NOW. that, can't wait Western vaccine producers finish delivering Western countries deliver us. Malaysia get many doses safe effective vaccines get NOW, Pfizer, AstraZeneca Sinovac. You’re absolutely point. numbers ridiculous. We’re negative capacity. Every hospital state flexed out, vented Covid patients boarding ER PACU. BSW opened 6th ICU unit temple completely closed transfers. brain bleeds / STEMIs / major traumas sitting ERs days surrounding areas none major hospitals neurosurgery / cath / trauma services beds. People dying treatable conditions god damn unvaccinated idiots taking ICU beds. regulations, need test enter theaters, restaurants etc. can't prove gravity push away earth. Come on. feel like coma, would want get vaccinated.   feel Winter Olympics held China 6 months?   ... wow, Ted. Wow.  one, always intended two. two really far apart kinda chore (not children huge separation diapers diapers makes process irritating/challenging). Yeah makes 2 us :/ Ok convince people good luck argument Like cuomo... totally agree points. dont think parents want kids go back reasons generally...the meals maybe abuse, sadly much. provided logical argument begin numb nuts. Take care— keep helicopters available life death emergencies. side effect observed happening proof doesn’t happen. can’t provide evidence nonexistence, words. no, don’t evidence doesn’t produce said effect since impossible. tuberculosis test worked childcare 20 years ago, teach district years later. try coding editing job job home flexible hours? social distance plane?  Illogical BS aptly describes comments here. Bravo Eventually ICU beds get taken none.  True don’t disagree whole world needs vaccinate still large percentage people still can’t get vaccinated children. They’re likely significant spreaders. welcome best wishes family! Unfortunately, think percentage kids getting vaccinated even lower adults. forget California, migrant friendly border state, isn’t spiking nearly hard.  People fucking stupid. similar thing happen me! nurse giving shot even made give doctor’s name &amp; wrote somewhere made wait 30 minutes instead typical 15. disconcerting.

We’re sinking ship together. short term - doesn’t. rather multiple dragged “curves” overwhelm systems, I’d rather 1 massive spike, let didn’t care die streets like 3rd world countries, comes down, move hospital previously worked antibody titer testing . care vaccine record. either one get job. 

Nosocomial infections real Covid one those. Really shocked health care workers required get vaccine prevent nosocomial infections. mean, part I’m page. think needing reward vaccinated, protection confers (which unfortunately less delta counts) seems uniquely American. 

We dropped ball last admin are, surprisingly, dropping ball admin. think shortsightedness comes politicians thinking general population dumb, can’t trusted truth, needs one thing focus time. time, wonder also many people CDC installed Trump (but I’ll take tinfoil hat now)

Nevertheless we’re current state union vaccinated helps, it’s far panacea months ago. things said would come back slowly coming back couldn’t happened worse time kids going back school much relaxed NPI environment. 

It’s like walking burning building hoping don’t get burned. see coming hoping someone take action, leaders leading there’s collective response.

That’s entirely true many states going back mask mandates, regions live - it’s true. Midwinter!? hell happened!? thought next month. convince let go panic realize covid endemic excess deaths even RECORD HOSPITALIZATIONS sporadic manageable  Honestly boils wanting know peace mind. said done oldest likely need return school unless pull out.

Stay safe everyone. still alive? I’m guessing some, like DeChambeau, it’s purely political. others, mainly Black athletes, understandable mistrust government corporations. 

Anti-vax sentiments always crossed political divide various reasons. However, anti-vax show support political figure new, quite frankly scary.

The latest data UK aligns we've seeing Israel

Protection infection: Evidence Israel shows Pfizer 39% effective preventing infection Delta, evidence UK shows 49%

Symptomatic infection: Evidence UK shows 59% protection vs symptomatic infections

Hospitalization: Evidence Israel shows Pfizer prevents 81% hospitalizations (for years old) another study found hospitalization rate Delta 85% higher variants. However, evidence UK shows 96% effectiveness hospitalizations.

Israel: August Winter? I’m confused. Russia clevrly decided appeal American vanity means disinformation certain sector Americans love kissass worked excellently among them. know fucking sucks vaccines worked regular virus everything fine months Delta came along don’t work pretty much stoping spreading know that’s awful shouldn’t shit like probably ever can’t find good vaccine it’ll worth stops people dying.

""Among total hospitalized patients local hospitals, 80% vaccinated. Fully partially vaccinated residents hospitalized far lower rates, said."", Dr. Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County health authority. Many Louisiana schools already open Let’s say 1000 people

900 vaccinated, 100 unvaccinated 

9 vaccinated people get hospitalized covid. 9 unvaccinated get hospitalized covid. 

That’s 50% split. amount people vaccinated hospitalized amount people unvaccinated, proportion vaccinated people hospitalized much lower. \*sigh\* keep voting Abbott idiots, still surrounded idiots. good thing Covid vaccine deniers fewer idiots vote Abbott rest next election. point I'm ready ""let bodies hit floor"" comes unvaccinnated.

It really really sucks, kinda reality think. ""The hospitals overrun, open everything up!"" people at? believe said news sources. ought be, primary goal still getting shots arms giving people chance avoid serious disease, vaccines still help with. start messaging “sorry shots aren’t good said,” yr gonna give lot fuel “vaccines don’t work, bother” crowd. I’m choosing read lines moves like act accordingly. We're talking two years life. We're talking two years going massive outdoor festivals. areas seeing entire human lifespan cut 10 years CoVid two years mean something 10 years really should.

In theory yes vaccinated people able go enjoy lives. practice however data know huge events like cause hospitals massively overwhelmed next months.

That means vaccinated people need go hospital able get care. means healthcare workers spent last 18 months already quitting droves quit even more. means vaccinated people need care able get it. means people getting chemo treatments delayed chemo treatments delayed unvaccinated people clogging hospitals.

That also means increase create variants defeat current vaccines quicker. when.

You fix bunch stupid decisions making stupid decisions. sick stupid decisions. “Somehow” 🤔 I'm pretty sure stats yesterday 55% non vaccinated, 35% double jabbed. us actually incredible considering points made. Perhaps misinformed 😎 say straight face, forcing schools hospitals prevent facemask.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly, would 90% protection. since majority(!) split least 50,00.......1% means grants max 89,99.....9% protection severe cases optimistic scenario. exactly talking hours, gods sake! think he’s sleeping fine Yeah idk usual daily wage there, id imagine wouldnt hard someone pay people enough make worth time. traveling nurses making crazy money right now. Yes. 

Or stop democracy hold politicians accountable? No, similar issues sleep disorders. Stimulants allow recover kinds fatigues, specific kinds. try caffeine example, non prescription stimulant, likely help much. Okay really ""rough draft"" train thought might mark terms explanation chance help us least process exactly understand...

 think may partially years school, I'm wondering may also sort like overall antivax attitude ""it's choice!"" two distinctions: 

1. sense resentment 2. sense needing control this/their bodies way
For first - even best circumstances, nurses always going beyond. say doctors, techs, etc well anecdotally, times I've hospitalized, remember every single nurse. Even stuck month 4 years ago couple travel nurses covering shifts.

 And, overlapping second - give much (including suggesting use graham crackers PB&amp;j honestly amazing lol) asked more. wonder similar felt pregnant started struggling PTSD new ways. felt like control body, ""used"" speak powerless long carried baby. remember wanting tattoo piercing desperately felt like way control body again, makes sense. nurses, may choosing let needle vaccine dose arm measure control felt they've 18+ months.

Tl;dr: kinda obvious virus asked sacrifice time, mental/physical health, risking lives people politicians did/do NOTHING help going take toll traumatic, ways healthcare workers cope get surge try heal might obvious resentment/wanting bodily autonomy make us illogical sh*t! I'm dating that's small comparison brought political pawn   Fucking again? learn nothing last year??  Agree 100% need use safe measures though keep safe; unlimited resources unchecked COVID wave kids. PICUs almost full South currently large part allowing spread unchecked schools kids.  “That Democrats fault” *proceeds vote recall* “If thought about—thank you, Mary, delicious—if thought consequences one second, you’d realize completely wrong plan is. That’s exactly congressmen think, that’s we’re headed fiscal cliff. see?” I'm happy say 100% teachers teach vaccinated People fit distribution vaccine enthusiasm. usually hear tail distribution. bit nutty. aware that, makes sense morbid sort way. wife, works ICU, complains beds fill fast opened says twisted form musical chairs devil cooked up. definitely does. Ive tracked website number available icu beds always changing (mostly increasing). willfuly chose vulnerable self-victimize themselves

Not confused vulnerable due legit health condition ACTUAL doctors, instead self diagnosis. President's fault? go different place tell receive one yet. easy. medical records can't shared across institutions without consent. friend (we're Filipino) literally saw job ad Facebook that's thinly disguised listing troll farm. confirm No. Texas Florida mostly distancing using masks, Delta infecting vaccinated also (though mostly don’t need hospitalization).

Lack vaccinations, along lack distancing masks lead much higher infection rate. Throw Vaccinated individuals thinking safe high chance becoming “carriers” boosts rate even more. Yes correct, point prolonged fasting, individuals even get euphoric want go back eating, especially since reintroduction eating often painful tedious (you first need ingest liquid meals fruits bites, etc, fibers upset stomach days quite significantly). I'm working lab worked studies professional prolonged fasters. professional fasters emphasized issue euphoria difficulty reintroduce eating major risk experience, one important things monitor fast themselves. Thank sharing! appreciate taking time. best luck raiding little ones!   Typo, fixed, thx. 👍 point bullshit

Are saying Florida *not* 15,000 COVID hospitalizations 3,000 people ICU right now?

I really follow getting here.

Do want people still talking Northeast COVID damage year ago instead Southeast COVID going nuts right now? so, why? North Korea (among countries) begs differ. Also contrary read news, borders (the southern ones least) *are* hard cross. news doesn’t report deaths.

Trump made people believe easy cross, even simply cross, cannot automatically live life here. need food, shelter, money. Anyway, think want. suspect find years road whether China right not. government *is* lying, honestly hope everyone lie involved rots hell. sorry feel otherwise. vaccine fully approved Canada people still use FDA excuse here. FDA approves they'll move onto next excuse.  think latest topic: viral load pre-symptomatic period, viral loads vaccinated people much lower. Also still proven assumption, viral load captures infectiousness well  Or, governments could bought vaccines, busy robbing public coffers think buying vaccines anyone ruling elite. not? shortage shots. Studies show likely boosts immunity provides even stronger protection. number at-risk people it’s probably actually necessary. 

Instead tracking people trying stay healthy, CDC collecting data children pushing FDA authorize vaccine 12 population get kids vaccinated COVID devastates schools. Media hype /s Pretty upset federal government gave free, attached good amount conditions them. governor decited needs make state control group. that? sense taste seemed change maybe sense smell affecting taste, nothing else. 

It made orange vitamin c tablets red wine taste bad. Bless Reba 100% always case, every teacher said ages ago. shut Reddit hive mind actually speaking truth.

Yes older variants contagious, could never say data ever valid before, self-reported, admins schools always going self-report ways reflect well upon them. Oh please help understand much given last 18 months! Surely suffered argument what? Give cases hospitalizations increasing??????? Makes sense

I American given luxuries, missed saying goodbye dying loved ones, lost job.

Your argument weak, friend. discuss politics issue PUBLIC HEALTH. can’t SIMPLY wear mask social distance (after everything we’ve lost last 18 mos) incredibly ignorant. There’s argument here, would worth time. lockdown would get maybe 50% compliance vaccinated 10% unvaccinated. enough police cars block major highways let alone every detour Waze would find, businesses would re-print papers saying they're essential, groups would reorganize text/messenger chains change meeting times. one people thinks prevent pregnancy ""being careful""... know, good middle ground masking kids sending school mandated teachers vaccinate. Long COVID seems real concern.

Also, even small numbers big consequences ( ). we’re guessing current masks distancing rates vaccination effective understand. new variant dangerous. Schools opening? good. least sickest moved lover level care stay ER. someone needs ICU one units (med/surg/tele) would likely stay there. would staff critical care nurses taking care patients. would receive support whatever critical care staff available. would continue space freed downgrading death. would suck. way many ICU cases taste. fully vaccinated people still spread covid. 300 million people around world vaccinated. waiting 500 million people, what?  


Any vaccine side effect happens within six weeks administration. FDA required 2 months safety data EUA. unforeseen side effects coming eight months widespread use. media want it.  Floridas data garbage forever. Well, OBGYN going official positions ACOG MFM academy, I'm sure would trust them. Piece cloth nothing stymie current spread. Band aid gash. nothing especially considering adults unvaccinated significantly likely ignore mask mandates first place. 

You live fantasy. far less infectious version disease killed 600k people masks unprecedented distancing measures. 

Speaking kid lmao, understating child like. “N95s stock!!” 99% population never wear one lmfao. Absolute insanity Nobody expected Spanish flu wife third trimester received tdap rhogam past friday. went get first covid dose week making wait 2 weeks, even though CDC guidelines states vaccines risk all. 

Has anyone experienced well? waiting hit third trimester got covid vaccine. Nope trial even done yet. BTW, data submitted application approval also submitted trial (which conduct themselves) concluded) Strange, also Iceland, cases seem rather low. Federal government says…”Florida who?” Correct, Pfizer even done sub 12yo trials provide dosage be. uncle mother's side alcoholic. He'd get admitted hospital due liver failure every then, get money family members treatment would fall back drunkard again.

Since parents one used money help him, issue me. put care, he'd dead since long ago I'd refuse give single dime moment pull shit 2nd time. part glad delta fucking shit up. Maybe shit actually gets bad enough people who's trust science robbed start understand fucking politics. real.  long spit PCR test. unvaccinated people get nose anal test. COVIDo Barrel Roll19 would you? There's vaccine available free that's 85%-90% effective preventing illness 95%-97% effective preventing hospitalization death. knock bunch antivaxxers labor force, wages productivity rise... Southern Border! one rush job. Everyone throwing blame around idea process actually works. rules procedures followed takes time. smart phone world, average person can't process takes longer week, lol submission removed because

If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus&amp;subject=Removed submission&amp;message=I'm writing following submission: Remember washing groceries? time, thought primary transmission touching things. hospitals *incredibly* overwhelmed new patients *constantly* arriving.

If someone need hospital-levels care, can't get bed, risk someone touches something patient touches - well, risk seems minimal: move patient lesser-care facility, staff wear gowns gloves wash hands constantly, open hospital beds people actually need hospital levels care. many chips go around. /s kidding. city absolutely exploded relined renting housing market. Sturgis SD. :)  Nurses risen challenge eighteen months. ever asked entire time ease burden healthcare system could actually take care ones got sick.

Texas, infinite wisdom, decided maintain distance, mask up, vaccinate. chosen things, *actively outlawed* mitigation efforts. parades protests *against* every single effort lower death toll sick list.

Why nurses continue put lives, health, sanity, families risk fuckheads can't even bothered wear piece cloth face?

And even time, there's going next time. kids back school? Gotta Labor Day parties Friday night football, right? Thanksgiving Christmas Superbowl? There's always going *some* ""reason"" inconvenient help trust us we'll *totally* help future.

Fuck assholes. Get vaccinated. Wear damn mask. Pull damn bootstraps *then* talk.  experts? seen single vaccine approval expert blame FDA. moving faster humanly possible experience, someone actually familiar process. kids 8 up. waiting FDA. clinical trail 8 completed application approval submitted FDA. Good one Sir. said previously, clear motivates persistence regarding concern teachers share private health information parents. person thread talking (not there’s anything wrong that) remained steadfastly fixated upon throughout, relative exclusion points others (such myself) find salient, like public health pandemic. 

If truly motivated concern others, noble, made anything clear, event concern others would misplaced, since believe correctly belongs health students, teachers, general public pitiable rare teacher health condition severe prohibits vaccinated allows mingle close proximity others pandemic. needs many outweigh needs agree vaccines mandated teachers. teacher vaccinated mandate, school teacher owe explanation parents since probably medical reason.

I believe agree points (although I’m precisely certain second point since seems worded bit wonkily). However, seem disagree *mandate* means. operating assumption *mandate* means teacher vaccinated reason consequently unable teach within given entity, therefore seek employment elsewhere perhaps apply disability benefits (obviously different municipalities, counties, states could different, less restrictive mandates). would clearly legitimate reason school disclose parents anyone else former teacher’s vaccination status health information, school entity decides allow medical exemptions mandate, may leaving open liability subsequently shown exempted teacher source infection. far ADA concerned, believe legal requirement “reasonable accommodation”, may require teacher teach remotely, school may choose explain parents said teacher teaches remotely. Leading, suppose, concern parents speculate reason. would unfortunate, outweighed, opinion, greater good. anti-maskers radicalized. It’s sad see. could get put passion behind good cause. one even attend school board meetings anymore idiots fill seats give sob stories kids wearing masks.  We’re grateful Pritzker passed mandate. hoping give school board members second breathe attack governor awhile.  know stupid sound right now? China 1.5 billion people, essentially claiming constantly test them, without fail. logistically 

Not everyone needs tested, entire cities tested using magic pooled testing. testing folks cross border illegally, example?

Unlike America, borders china pretty remote hard cross got lucky.  hear you. think little confused talking about. first seemed like talking blase ""whatever"" attitude number deaths. reacting that. think normal healthy get somewhat numbed we're thick things. happens people wartime, example. 

But talking people getting unhinged hateful casting blame, etc. agree that's good us. I'm curious things happened earlier pandemics. did, doubt level. We've already strongly divided. exaggerating thingsthat already there, media amplifying it. Save partially vaccinated first. better outcome. Nah, think fine. 

Cheers— I've lived world. Americans biggest cowards, one compared peoples... waving figuratively waving junk around ceaselessly screaming bloody tough apparently are. I’m saying started it; I’m saying ran it.  Take fear mongering bullshit somewhere else. flu still dangerous kids. Fully vaccinated older adults still worse outcomes, statistically, kids do. 

This sub ABSOLUTELY circle jerking delta variant children. It’s drive clicks, karma, emotional response. feel ashamed. using adderall brain fog many long haul clinics right now. read article today openly suggested anyone ask Moderna despite previous vaccine was. Interesting. anyone mixed matched? (Aside getting J&amp;J getting Pfizer Moderna, know many done that) 

Tried link article auto-removed comment. youre misreading data. Covid-Net sample group surveillance hospitals collect data report CDC. actual number 2.5M really think should’ve spaced time doses instead three four weeks them.  yes understood. nobody ""i cancer"" card.  that's kinda I'm asking It’s exactly works. positive cases trial determine statistical efficacy faster. Probably herd immunity Delta. Yeah, let's bury head sand pretend covid exist. would stop looking reality, could make believe everything's fine! sentiment toxic, counterproductive, would say traitorous. Shake sense head.

I’d open voting someone else behind name, provided actual progressive, Gavin crossed red line me. problem

Except country's problem, people get ill enough admitted hospital, that's one bed longer available others, impacts country's overall health care capacity.

As civilized country, they're going leave selfish fucks die without care. Sometimes need ICU maxed noninvasive supplemental O2 (from devices called BIPAP Hiflo). may may need intubated ventilator near future. want people ICU nurses docs intubate moments notice. 

Other times also sick infection diabetes requiring special medications needs carefully titrated/managed minute minute hour basis. got vaccinated third trimester earliest could get (Jan 2021) really wanted pass antibody baby. I'm glad did! 

In case wondering: labor delivery uncomplicated. Baby healthy thriving. Breastfeeding going great too. Lol guy brilliant underrated. single mom works two jobs loves kids never stops.
With gentle hands heart fighter, survivor. argument getting everyone vaccinated can’t jump gun. potential give 5 yo five times adult dose end ramping immune system end worse side effects what? end scaring parents vaccine initiative children dead water. 
Do vaccine manufacturers fda need move faster? Yes. safety still number 1. got 2nd Pfizer shot May, 41 years old, knowing we're August there's definitive plan attack stuff people know, imagine people vaccinated January February feel. seeing news Delta, regular breakthroughs, waning protection data that's place, articles dwindling ICU beds area starting freak out. glad hear it. Good luck you! CDC clear guidelines boosters we’d already started giving vulnerable people, folks getting illicit boosters skipping line, I’d angry. guidelines, reports waning immunity breakthrough infections aren’t rare anymore. don’t condone people taking extra shots own, understand it. I’m glad she’s still taking precautions though. people know vaccine also masks precautions. It’s good still understands virus threat. already been! (shipping states). triage use non-ICU beds available. Yeah dog shit person. argument. glimpses getting things like wastewater studies comprehensive testing whole groups, rare. Damn! Poor Reba. Dolly gets shit help vaccines may cry. Nailed People forget US packed sports stadiums open full capacity across country months. wasn’t *one* event.  There’s absolutely evidence latent superpowers show tomorrow. needs outweigh needs many. happen people chosen vaccinated &amp; end icu become class B patients. someone else needs bed car crash surgery gone wrong, class B removed icu. probably die. decision made. I'm sorry made decision. Rusty Shackleford insurance. literally went wedding groom tested positive stuck honeymoon cause could come home failed test. bride tested negative leave without him.

Now? much  effects COVID fertility aren’t known either… not-dead get pregnant. frustration sister’s doc understandable No. Black athletes get free pass here. assinine. 50% country fully vaccinated. mistrust gov't longer valid argument, neither anyone empathize excuse. BLM right? matter cops bad things them? personal responsibility? Athletes access best best doctors. Yep. poke around see people say conspiracy theory subreddits, parents saying teen wants vaccine refuse let get it. Comments literally like ""kick get it"" ""let live ex, start new family, easy."" dogs? dogs spread virus humans? daughter’s school mask mandate (Nevada) someone tests positive, within 6ft 15 minutes stay home 10 days. already 3 cases first 2 days school.  And? Democrats run someone recall, backup, wouldn’t facing risk. party. failure understand kind adorable kind scary well. 

Hell yeah screw moderates! wouldn’t voted Brexit fully support independent Scotland Irish reunification. So, ya know, try harder? think picture grim. sure discrepancy is, work San Antonio market. last night, 0 available ICU beds 0 available intermediate step beds covid non covid patient. 

Half ER beds occupied people waiting open hospital bed. 

Expect much longer wait times going ER It’d hilarious recalled put strongest mask mandater possible. Like, vote recall, vote strictest anti-Covid person.

It’d make “one shot governorship” people go even nuts. I'm convinced Texas Florida hate people. Hi, US resident here. It’s impossible get PCR test live without paying minimum $180-200. get drive Walgreens/CVS tests, nobody recognizes official clearance travel. I’m fully vaccinated, I’ve played rules, I’m fucking sick bullshit. right you, worked home, kids school 18 months. School starts next week, horrified. oldest starting middle school it’s damaging stuck alone formative years. little one needs structure provided teacher, work, cannot home school too. sad upset completely agree you. choice. 

Choosing stick head sand (or ass) remain stubbornly ignorant certainly personal decision. One many consequences poor choice vulnerability. however vulnerability making point, problem. Doesn’t mean making vulnerable. Apathetic inaction also choice. Worse 2020. burnout real hospital staff, people done giving whatever little fucks begin get one dose only, infection 6 months ago Dang. inappropriate ask wife gotten Covid working ICU (at point)? answer. Republicans energized recall Democrats aren't.

We much likely end Republican nutjob office Gavin recalled normal election.

IMO think would prudent vote 2024, otherwise we're risking Larry fucking Elder governorship partner attend birth. believe me, call L&amp;D department hospital delivering at. I'm sure they'd happy discuss protocols ease mind. Well, reference, made around equivalent 500 USD month working entry-level software developer, that's already way minimum wage. totally possible It’s allowing die, it’s refusing financial help towards someone who’s repeatedly proven they’re gonna use help themselves. give money someone who’s going waste it? Unvaxxed people take hospital space people car crashes, heart attacks, sepsis, etc die. He's crippled need another lockdown right. Children Genocide. Joe Rogan clip shits Fauci saying cases going rise Texas aged badly. 

18 months later absolute inability people understand exponential aspect virus works mind boggling. Teacher here. Agreed! fasted past 24 hours I've never experienced euphoria I'm aware of. like helps keep alert normal work hours keeps productive. Eating night = successful hunt, cleaned prepared meal time eat rest. 

I never slept empty stomach. sure pushing past 24 hours would like. Seems like would miserable maybe not. Anecdotal story but: wife thought infertile 8 years. got shots earlier year. Last month found pregnant, first time marriage.

I love faces antivax family jest vaccines fact cured infertility 🤪 Clap clap 👏 deep ❤ Texas clap Clap Bingo. US too.

Ideally even fining people get sick.

And make states pay CARES Act hospital treatment.

Wear mask, get vaccinated, get tested.

Numbers would drop faster Florida manages get up.

That would fix US within 3 months. Pandemic permanently control.

Right 25% America profiting 75% America. Every sick person money sent Florida Texas’s economy federal government. places yes, way higher. But, hospital. Thus travelers coming. Implementing system/more rules tracking people would result way fewer people getting al, unfortunately. point think reach state waves overwhelm hospitals. Everyone says it'll endemic, can't people getting seriously ill large numbers can't care illnesses/injuries well. reaches point icus *this* full, anyone car wreck, heart attack, ill child secondary risk due overload. ideally vaccination/protection rates happening would ""end"". pediatric hospital city full. sad. insurance charge though? Hold accountable voting recall prompted republicans even less stop coronavirus pull recall.

You strike someone would’ve voted brexit screw moderates, let’s go full xenophobe ironically long people sufficient time get vaccinated (I assume given lead isn’t “Scotty marketing” Morrison) reading virus masks protein cell key sugars .

Would blood sugar level affect effectively virus evade immune system? might push right society they’d get vaccinated. many places require least test anything, customers don’t want around unvaccinated, untested people. Please re-read post tell doesn’t strike condescending lol. pay traveling nurses crazy right now. Thats whole thing it. dont want vaccine, fine, f off. sign waiver saying dont want get treated du-as$ wont take resources Well legitimate reason able demonstrate doctor. bullshit reason go argument doctor.  Yes! work school. Ended school year masks full hope. we're starting new year I'm worried much longer going last. live mask mandate state really know expect kids come back. point being? iono rate another varient soo enough que ""mask nothing..this democrat hoax. drop like flies.... texas might flip blue gop can't make midterms. trump might also beg donations well. except lasted almost two days. husband help bathroom first day shaky feet. glad got vaccinated different times down, we'd trouble. 

He Moderna spiked fever felt pretty crummy lasted 12 hours him.  People getting droves live even vaccine. get cold/flu symptoms rather dying.

I honestly would careful unvaccinated.

I thought covid week even vaccine little threat real medical issues huge headache. isolate long time, can't go work, family friends avoid you, etc. 

With vaccine protections rough... get caught without it'll worse. extremely uncomfortable idea jailing people vaccination.  Yeah, post right one worrying numbers pregnant women hospitalized covid. weigh vaccination risk contracting disease, even close. know 7 day moving averages work, daily numbers still screw average they're correct (or almost correct). 

Anyway, added 3 day total came 56,000. Which, I'm correct, previously got 28,000 right? understanding lump 56,000 released weekend got split middle Saturday Sunday.

But add new Sat/Sun/Mon totals still get 56,000. tell, looks like 56,000 actually 3-day total instead 2-day total? numbers seem work out.  Arent people driving faster normal days? should.

You may able say ""oh that's me, live Springfield"". Oh, anybody gets crashed somebody dui. gets burned house fire. workplace accident.

All people also getting substandard care anti vaxxers. FUCKING PLEASE!! It’s tough counter evidence also turns anecdotal quickly. constantly find saying “well Covid take me…” mean, yeah. government supposed work people. Regardless politics. punish sick people state bc governor.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yeah know statistics vaccine got. guess kinda feels like march-April 2020 I’m overthinking.  That's another element concerns - kids stupid. Many know shitty politicians jeopardizing health political reasons

That's lot potential resentment anger building society, exacerbating generational divides geeze, like lying even considered that... 

source: parent 11.5 yo. People illegal stuff time times something bad happens result. Docs treat em street em. er staff time filling police reports called witness. Especially now, live. 

Worst could see kind false statement access prescription drug charge. work shipping department home? think kind garbage could screened beforehand. wonder curve look like Sept 13 right implement enforcement vaccine passports NYC. hope numbers embarrassingly small passport seems unnecessary get rid it. feeling matter numbers are, passport stay. Government never gives powers like this. Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) approves! learned anything pandemic? If/when next one happens gonna better approach? really think so. anyone? mean specific ""take seriously""  went well mean side effects road. Maybe lot people called back tourism work Oahu, Big Island Maui. doesn’t make sense burden locals inter-island quarantine rules funnel million mainlanders week airports. *Everyone going airports.* Either quarantines necessary aren’t. surcharge reminds scene: $10,000, make $20,000, make $1,000,000. Doesn’t matter. doubt Covidiots $10,000, you’re really increasing amount medical debt die (whether that’s year 50 years).

Or borrow quote I’ve seen elsewhere, “If owe ~~bank~~ hospital $100, that’s problem. owe bank $100 million, that’s ~~bank’s~~ hospital’s problem”

Ethically, hospitals can’t deny treatment. hospitals capacity start making decisions gets treatment, anyone unvaxxed good reason low priority. IMO it’s ethical treat leave car accident heart attack patients die. Well israel anyways. protection low. legal term equity, means fairness. saying goes is, “those seek equity must give equity.” often referred clean hands doctrine. Seems applicable here. Oh, let's ignore site we're using... got moderna. morning worst shivers life, could barely stands up, gone 3 hours fine. Far less bad had. best guess still following Trump's goal achieving natural herd immunity deliberately pushing body counts political talking points 2024. states everything protect people others everything backward, yet federal government expected help equally?  Trying convince family get vaccinated I’ve kind run wall parent doesn’t want get *YET*

(I stress “yet” they’re anti vaxx means, want wait see long(er) term effects it’s actually worth taking risks (they’ve blood clotting issues, example, past caused doctor advise might want wait - also gives whole “my doctor said” excuse can’t anything part)

The piece argument I’m trouble countering “just want wait see truth shakes to, it’s constantly changing get data in” 
—ie ‘masks won’t help’ became ‘mask up’ became ‘double along latest example “vaccinated people can’t spread Covid” becoming “a small percentage spread it” becoming “looks like vaccinated unvaccinated spread Covid rate”

I’m tired formulate right response right makes likely say wrong thing frustration

Any help appreciated Send thoughts prayers 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻   understand, numbers divided two days instead three. issue Florida provided daily numbers. I’m sorry. It’s heart wrenching lose child. feel loss. creepy. least using 2019 data quick google-fu, coincidentally ages 0-11 represent 15.2% US population.   bed holds probably largest cause ED nurses leaving, lost less ED setting others lot say too. actually annual volume go last year, despite huge dip spring 2020. times nearly every normal bed full bed holds running daily volume ED hallway beds. nurses essentially taking inpatient assignment, also 3 ED patients. Ok I’ve commented r/sciencebasedparenting (which lot discussion around topic)

We don’t actually know antibodies get transferred breastmilk babies. It’s lot educated speculation. enter bloodstream passive immunity. tell mostly coats nasal stomach bit ultimately digested breastmilk antibodies seem last long you’re breastfeeding. also real immunity benefits we’ve seen studies gastrointestinal illnesses believe ear infections. think antibodies may neutralize germs entering nose mouth much still unknown still don’t fully know long children benefit it. could first weeks, months, etc it’s hard study. Antibodies via placenta way beneficial encourage TDAP flu shots pregnancy instead relying breastfeeding. also start vaccinating babies (including breastfed ones) 8 weeks. 

A cup breastmilk toddler probably digested without antibodies really anything.  Hopefully ED me! Love Vanity Fair's writing school starting. gonna rip kids can't yet get vaccine wearing masks cause executive order prohibits mandates. Cause governor hates kids guess. I've taken calling baby killer. sympathy. *does* feel like we're fighting unwinnable war. Go. vaccinated age, risk relatively low. numbers come days ago saying pfizer 85% effective Delta variant 3% hospitalizations vaccinated less 1% dead? Lol, people die time suddenly everything's blamed vaccine. Statistically, since number vaccinated large I'm sure plenty people know someone knows someone died taking shot (with shot affect). People tend know someone knows someone who's died recently variety reasons. Yeah. school starting soon, gonna get worse. short term memory still isn’t great. Got little better vaccine. DC said possibility Thanksgiving least weeks. Thanksgiving first time.  Agree , long get vaccinated first . unvaccinated already costing fortune hospitals haven’t, doctor said immunity decent plus there’s mixed information getting getting one dose don’t get all, definitely confusing times human. Faafo That’s fear lol Senators? like saboteurs jusst printed 6 trillion giver businesses. could imagined public school america. could used empty office buildings create small bubbles students. Hell, even colleges person nearly much younger children. could sent k-8 students empty high schools colleges. we're slightly better before.

Who's ""we?"" vaccinated way better before. sure population density big factor? aware 85% Canadians live within 100 miles US border? Half Canadians live 700 mile stretch land Windsor Quebec City, Toronto Montreal big part it. rest country total population density Canada useful comparison tool. I'd argue Canadian cities whole denser US cities - there's less (but still significant) urban sprawl. Yeah, let’s lose human decency compassion politician pushing dumb law. Makes lot sense. Geez, I’m sorry. don’t even know process that. 28k actually mistake, 15k correction. Well right. HIPAA is. Also Israel. required get tested, pay. taxpayers pay poor choices others?

Health insurers thing. cover medical costs Covid anti-everything crowd. crude propaganda. Usually try subtle. kind shit Twitter Facebook ban, won't. like leaders quarter people fighting war you. parents unfortunately know quite people little symptoms therefore believe going fine get argument goes one ear other. Can't believe misinformed people are. antibodies reason people protected virus. Moderna Pfizer vaccines shown studies produce equivalent antibodies people beat infection studies show produce upwards 20x number antibodies. effective beating COVID. basically beating covid = 1x, mRNA = 1x-20x. HIPAA is... Talk doctor, reddit. third dose guidance, unfortunately. want doses go countries aren’t getting vaccines. 

I get feeling well dealing pandemic least another year more. say ""yet another"", proffered single study before, would better served saying ""here study"".

This ""study"" N 45, tiny fraction Israel study, tenth already underpowered Kentucky study. 

And study actually assess effectiveness vaccine vis-à-vis getting corona. looks reactivity. 

And look delta, source previous objection.

I get want vaccine panacea -- I. weak effort.  niece beds, ventilated fighting life. going well. 25, comorbidities, unvaccinated.

I honestly can't plea more, I'm fear 2 4 year olds. Please save family heartache get vaccinated. Yeah, thought straight crude propaganda. northeast substantially vaccinated, though.

And talking like November surge (like last year) could definitely looking 5-12s vaccinated that. vaccinated patients also tested?

No. whole point measure motivate people get vaccinated (and save tax money things). vaccinated people advantage, would less effective pressure unvaccinated also get vaccinated. letter FDA American Academy Pediatrics indicates FDA planning wait six months evaluate low-incidence side effects, AAP [urging reduce Waiting 6-month follow-up significantly hinder ability reduce spread hyper infectious COVID-19 Delta variant among age group, since would add 4 additional months authorization decision considered.

Fingers crossed. believed actual infection rates likely much 10x higher reported last wave? that's still true, would mean least million cases day added. hard imagine could continue indefinitely. close Idiocracy.  luck though? There’s almost certainly downsides. Like, one guarantee future, reason believe issues future.

And won’t Covid shots babies perhaps months. Antibodies infants huge plus. “infected levels contagious unvaccinated“ shows clearly dont know youre talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

yes, vaccinated people catch covid, specific delta, contagious unvaccinated. pay attention part 97% hospitalized patients unvaccinated? Really think alarmist numbers everywhere right now. Good luck kids. Hey, maybe we'll finally solve obesity epidemic, junk food brands go business. Silver lining! know intellectually thousands people hospitalized every day Florida, even pre covid. 3,000 people like entire high school ICU once. 15,000 small town. hard really wrap head around enormity it.  Ah, perfectly explains sore arm vax. It’s immune system rushing site. Thank you! Perhaps likely pushing beliefs. One people consider really good friends doctor lord number things comments said choices troubling. also got extremely mad said wouldn’t go gender reveal knew family weren’t vaccinated wear masks (we Texas). I’m seriously point ending friendship moving on. key quote story..

""Almost patients hospitalized COVID-19 unvaccinated partially vaccinated, health experts said"" shit. Russia? could've guessed.

It's almost bad faith foreign actor chance presented kill civilians biggest adversary could ever get away conventional warfare... kind seems like Republicans want people die this. I’m struggling understand benefits politically unless benefits economically they’re invested hospitals something like that. finals? Like 2 3 week ago, delta wave start, like tail end finals. Many concerts right outdoors, mass gatherings tends limit spread.

Sturgis lot people going bars. looking Provincetown type event given happened rainy weekend everyone going bars. gay community takes alot seriously bikers Sturgis, whole.  I’ve taken HIPAA annual competency exam every year since 2007. fact talk patients public liberal discuss previous treatments. there’s separate individual present always ask consent prior discussing details related medical history treatment. China many asian countries successfully reached 0 infections last year. every country that, would over.

The idea disease unbeatable nothing induced helpelessness greedy fight it.  Similar thing happened mine GA. drove 1.5 hours get shot mass vax site nurse see 5 month old car. asked breastfeeding check guidance was. thought needed doctors permission something lead nurse told personal choice. made state okay it. almost broke cus driven way specifically get shot breastmilk. really break sure made wrong decision.

I didnt think malice anything. think first mother she'd encountered. [Is Biden Declaring “Independence virus” article (released *before* July 4 [The president] advisers, eager claim credit virus’s retreat United States, talking “summer joy president] visit Traverse City, Mich., Saturday part White House calls “America’s Back Together” celebration. [His wife] also take road, Vice President Kamala Harris, husband, Doug Emhoff, various cabinet officials attend festivals, parades cookouts around public health experts fear scenes cross-country celebrations — including White House party liberation theme — send wrong message wide swaths population remain vulnerable true independence worst public health crisis century may long way off.**

What kind message advertising “summer joy freedom” maskless gatherings send consumers? one grounded science? Public health officials seem think not, I’m interested take leading example is.  anyone source claim (which floating around sub days):

""vaccinated people good spreading virus unvaccinated people""

?

So far, evidence, I've seen inference drawn PCR cycle threshold graph (that issues).

I may missed it, miss lot things. tradition Fauci Florida. would get vaxxed.

It’s like large changes immune system affect vaccine risk six months growth.

Is school session now? Masks? also improved covid.

I used stressed time work worked close 60 hours week retail survive. sleep well. often suicidal thoughts. never time prepare healthy meals mainly ate fast food tv dinners. obese.

Then pandemic hit started getting unemployment stay home. suddenly time exercise plan prepare healthy meals day. lost 55 pounds. feel stress anymore. sleep better night ever before. suicidal thoughts year.

The thought going back work giving anxiety stress like believe.

I know pandemic hard lot people. greatest thing ever happened me. absolutely love isolation gave me. autism worst surrounded strangers customer service job thrive total isolation. ICU - crisis! r//conservative keep going desantis abott winning tho?! Portable HEPA filters plug like fan shockingly effective reducing spread COVID. ideal solution would course upgrade central HVAC, small plug-in $150 device job beautifully.

For interested picking something like up, personally vouch recommendations Wirecutter: 
  Coway Mighty Winix purifiers work quite well, relatively small unobtrusive. Worldometers still yesterday 28k 4-5 days 20k range. Unless they've peaked, theoretically possible, numbers seem weird. either case hospitalizations concerning.   got downvoted lol fuckin sub logic used points towards saying.

Scientists democratic leaders: ""Hey get everyone vaccinated wear masks spikes. might need boosters every year""

You: ""WELL LOGIC ABOLISH RESTAURANTS SHUT TRAVEL FOREVER""

It's common theme now. hard time conversation people jump bullshit.  seems insane send kids back school delta variant peaks. Hehe. best jokes always downvoted. I'm saying headlines referencing politicians figureheads, remember happening Texas individuals collective choices. Granted, everyone responsible collectively Texan community itself. comparing denizens state. state administered mass vax sites, need worry reading (in likelihood). would track records vaccination would pharmacy. one sure?

Nurses necessarily go temp agencies. That’s awesome! didn’t qualify unfortunately, hopefully soon roll everyone high risk! Yes think money made Unfortunately, think we're half primed overreact next half primed ignore like time. 

You guess half which.  It’s ethically right deny treatment. drunk driver comes ER injuries killing people accident, aren’t denied treatment. Even completely idiotic people bring harm others given need medicine. It’s doctors decide right treatment. take oath protect many lives able. Right, tell something Covid situation ground states *right moment*. thread current upsurge, cumulative tallies past 18 months.

The current 7 day average cases Florida 22,484, whereas New York 3,760. deaths 113 vs 11. Florida New York barely 10% difference population. Nurses manage profession running young ones keep pay high themselves. Nasty back-stabbin' b-words. disagree, improving ventilation long term project. New system, retrofitting what's place, costly time consuming. Hey guys stop cutting Amazon don’t die ? …and you’re unable turn head tell doctor off…

Sorry levity. lost hearing 40 years ago meningitis. That’s kind beside point. original commenter saying people convinced something article. assume meant lot children going die. That’s really case experts said serious illness still rare children. One story news isn’t justification mass panic. don’t anything else world. reason someone would try push narrative desire create fear panic situation isn’t dire compared children. Yes, Covid become endemic, hopefully become less lethal novel anymore...but follow model influenza novel viruses, takes full generation, majority adults people acquired immunity children. 

In real life, deal stubborn people insist ""herd immunity"" magically happen point, keep resisting change long enough, matter anymore. guess that's become sore point. 

Maybe we'll reach ""herd immunity"" 30 years, 2021 '22. They're still spiraling control, what's point? You’re right original reasoning “don’t bother masks” think problem didn’t ‘admit’ much later. 

At time simply ‘you don’t need it’


The “vaccinated still spreading” number came British study think? Give minute I’ll find it. Republicans seeking ""freedom"" Northeast liberals. know few. I’ll see find neighbor tell don’t believe arguing good faith.

Here original tell it’s none business they’re vaccinated? don’t mean rudely either. board mandating teachers get vaccinated. But, it’s fair tell every parent status. school know safety reasons teacher wouldn’t feel comfortable telling whole town medical status, even vaccinated.

You simultaneously claim agree vaccine mandates, complaining *the whole town knowing medical status.* Throughout entire thread complain parents asking vaccine status sharing answer parents, people making Facebook posts it, consistently tried explain vaccines condition employment, would private medical information shared parents, since everyone would vaccinated.

One would naturally assume since claim support vaccine mandates teachers since claim teacher yourself, medical conditions would prohibit vaccinated, reasons persistent concern parents knowing vaccine status entirely unclear. motivated altruistic concern hypothetical rare individual unable vaccinated due underlying medical conditions, noble you, rather forced share medical information parents, individuals may forced (or could voluntarily choose) seek employment another school district another state without vaccine mandate. said that, don’t believe motivated altruism feel language really existed *early early* days vaccine. two friends who's newborns months old got vaccine (they medical providers Tier 1A) back Jan/Feb conversation obstetrician. save half compared using ventilator survival rate ventilator 50%? Typical American conservative mindset got chills reading that. Reminds grim meme: 


We live collapsing times. saying helps vaccinated, awesome would cards displayed blood type well. wonder connect dots … Wow. I’m glad worked okay! That’s definitely severe case ‘masks won’t help’ became ‘mask up’ became ‘double up’

The messaging really ever ""masks help"", public wear masks early pandemic. Why? tell everyone wear mask society typically wear masks, run them. public health policy decision, PPE absolutely needed save lives healthcare workers, short supply. really option public policy perspective tell people wear masks “vaccinated people can’t spread Covid” becoming “a small percentage spread it” becoming “looks like vaccinated unvaccinated spread Covid rate”

I've seen papers information supports 3rd quote. delta variant, there's evidence breakthrough cases result similar peak viral load vaccinated unvaccinated, also evidence contagious viral load shorter window vaccinated. There's also doubt vaccinated individuals less likely become infected contagious overall. 

People seem think medical advice ""flip-flopping"" use c.2000s political term: idea say one thing, ever change say, previously lying deceiving people. now, actually means advice changes public policy needs understanding evolves. criticize experts changing messaging really makes sense -- messaging always change new information resources available. sits general area injected muscle immune system reacts it, like drug that's going diluted thorough blood volume.

There case someone messed injected entire vial (5 doses) rather diluting it. IIRC recipeient fine. fall anything tells want hear. Oklahoma hospitals near breaking point COVID-19
Janelle Stecklein/ CNHI State Reporter
OKLAHOMA CITY — state’s hospital system nearing breaking point COVID-19 admissions climb nursing shortages plague facilities, governor said state emergency needed point.

The head Oklahoma Hospital Association Tuesday, meanwhile, called state officials grant Oklahoma hospitals flexibility given last year order combat latest virus spike.

“Oklahoma hospitals need state regulatory flexibility create additional bed capacity repurposing space within hospital, licensure flexibility enabling insurance department instruct insurance companies waive expedite pre-authorization post-acute care,” said Patti Davis, president OHA.

She called “most expedient course taken” achieve flexibility.

“If state agencies statutory authority move without executive order governor, certainly would like see explored,” Davis said.

""We effective vaccine free widely available eligible Oklahomans, well prepared manage COVID without state emergency,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said statement Tuesday.

Dr. Dale Bratzler, chief COVID officer University Oklahoma, said Tuesday hospital system start erecting temporary barriers taking measures create COVID-19 units “we’ve seen really dramatic increase number cases” within past week. also said media briefing Tuesday another major medical system Oklahoma City, Mercy, announced also running bed capacity.

“Remember, many people hospital things time, tremendous shortage nurses actually would allow us open beds facilities,” Bratzler said.

The State Department Health reported 1,042 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, bringing state’s seven-day average 2,025. agency reported 919 people hospitalized COVID-19. patients, quarter intensive care.

State health officials reported vaccinated residents become ill, new COVID-19 cases among yet get vaccine.

Bratzler said doesn’t see statewide hospital capacity numbers, knows “what’s happening Oklahoma City system, approaching limits capacity.” also said Tulsa area hospitals “very, full.”

But Bratzler said part ability hospitals repurpose beds bring contingent staffing dependent Stitt declaring state emergency.

“If hospitalizations keep going may necessary,” said.

No, really screw 7 day average one day off, 6 days averaged in. 7 day average trending up, guess what, past peak. It'll take 2-3 days change one direction another really impact 7 day average. see hospital admissions really applies deaths new cases well, line 7 day, daily numbers bars. see bars jumping place 7 day line pretty consistent trend. blame Mexican immigrants somehow.  Damn, must rough kid, even tangentially involved, much teacher.

The story common though. Sufjan Stevens song narrates almost identical story. heartbreaking listen to, even though I’ve never experienced situation like that.  thing needles, I'm also one watch shot given. first shot got, takes syringe saw size needle, said, ""that's it?""   “Stopped monitoring”?!?

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Maybe worth travel state go ER available hospitals herd mentality

Their cases people infected once.

Why still thinking herd immunity thing? Anecdotally, friend major clot years ago blood thinners since, believe 7 stints put years ago. Shes blood thinners high risk pregnancy elevated liver enzymes (her entire pregnancy shot) eventually forced emergency c section 37 weeks. got shot around April 2021 IIRC delayed schedule time vaccines. 3rd trimester cant remember week. 

All say...she didnt symptoms vaccine monitored quite regularly. going 2 appts week time. coming 2 years. Good next pandemic really hope we’ve licked covid 2 years Well that’s good. I’m Wisconsin. Thanks.. summary position increasingly significant factor, might better way actually practise? work surgery department California. We’re problems finding travelers. go work hospital state vies masks “face diapers” earn money job state takes pandemic seriously? Oh, NOW, you’re okay Socialism?   Maybe read article. Considering Delta works, think actual possibility Delta run course numbers coming lockdown starts looking likely, they'll get much stricter. girlfriend got CVS test, free, used travel UK. NY state travelled Icelandair. makes think high vulnerable subjects would go test voluntarily?

They don't. never planned to. believe reason numbers high people going vacations European countries. that, mandatory tests need done. 

For starters, concerned. never were. believe virus deadly, flu, per statement. That's one reason get jab. 

Also, makes think trust test facilities already trust health system /government vaccine? That's another reason get jab. go testing say tests fake detecting common flu.

I go on, German government fed bullshit. Let opt-out society, consequences. Good call. can't all. understand voted. right, exactly vaccine does; stop virus entering body, enables body fight quickly minimal adverse effects. Iceland 93% vaccinated also surge similar Cyprus. lot data missing here, cases people fully vaccinated? medical background 400 serious condition etc... Thank you. That's point trying make, bad stuff been, order magnitude worse. zero confidence people would attending. know like average Harley riders around here, might feel different mostly professionals like ride. Sturgis different beast. I'm motorcyclists, incredibly responsible really nice people. there's also set irresponsible guys Sturgis.

Heck town Sturgis even like going really hard turn money businesses there. Even town something, they'd probably still go trash place instead. feel bad them. probably make smaller proportion numbers vaccine tourists fly US get vaccinated. people Japan done that. underlining condition, vaccination completely safe protect blunt virus. 


The underlying condition previous severe allergic reaction vaccine. since two types Covid vaccine common ingredients apart NaCl, means there's practically one can't take it. What’s everyone’s gut feeling able travel tourist abroad next year? (Europe Asia America). I’m asking friend isn’t Reddit. That’s true. I’m German definitely go grocery shopping without test. Yeah... Guessing story load bullshit wife misinformed Ahh. screw ‘em. pay.  scientifically illiterate idiots

Are scientist? fuck around find out. True. might granted entry without test anywhere. test (and pay) excluded restaurants everything people mingle (except private meetings) resolving 3 years less

Um, whole disease around year half. that's absolute max 'long-term' be. mandatory going certain places, like theaters, restaurants, theme parks etc. choose remain unvaccinated, either pay test every time wanna go somewhere fun, stay home. equivalent shooting nose spite face. They're actually disincentivizing people likely infected get tested. get wanting create vaccination incentives mind boggling. Well many black people Germany, really get mentioning them. what? targeting hesitant regardless background. things work right see He's going out. thanks lmao. likely happening, going happen, employers say can't return test negative. cost continuous testing become prohibitive ""eventually"" decide cost continuous test weighs think benefit. Thanks comment. new reddit; informative article that's worth reading. ""tradition new"" thing going reddit point relevent, helpful information gets filtered people want ""new"". Also, issue mixing vaccines gotten exposure deserves. yet see better article one issue. YMMV. many bananas eat. \*Random saxophone notes\* Well Delta variant reportedly contagious lethal original strain. vaccine also less effective variant. We’re seeing explosion Covid numbers (over 100% increase cases average throughout country). Compare number Covid cases last year time (there many now). Hospitals starting overwhelmed again. Schools opening kids can’t get vaccinated. variant seems harsher younger individuals. it’s middle summer, viruses always worse coming fall/winter season. 

So… yeah pretty much taken turn worst. Also lot begging vaccine realizing vaccines don’t work way. honor system didn’t work. That's super weird. I've noticing thing. They're ones lose business due travel restrictions covid cases rise. Right?? get second J&amp;J? I'm boat. 7 days fever issues you. I'm vaccinated, took covid test. 

Did fever resolve? so, many days? kind kind people want vaccine care getting tested first place? People need understand herd immunity goal, strategy. two strategies getting everyone getting vaccines everyone getting sick.  really sad That's lot harder son brother. part isn’t clear? (If say it, I’ll explain every little detail you.)  Thanks well wishes. sure use Texas. I've trying best convince fellow Texans. Even trying fight misinformation here: Welp know airlines never get another dime me.

Thanks showing us are. New reddit? good article, sub (or big sub really) people tend post noteworthy articles within like 6 hours published, later get irate reposts ""old news"". Also, Covid vaccine research particularly fast-moving field moment, 7 weeks seem bit old. Let's get wheel here, gonna get better. ""oh they're dying unrelated conditions"" want add said. 

The original design studies young children already going take longer adults &amp; teens FDA said would require follow-up data. adults teens FDA granted EUA 2 months follow-up data. younger kids want 4-6 months data. 

It unclear also require 4-6 months data new enrollees requested. But, specifically look myocarditis (which usually occurs within weeks shot) may require 2 months follow-up data them. Yay! Also, forget hospitalized people going bit hit insurance premiums. surprise see companies giving discounts vaccinated penalties vaccinated. Alright got pfizer Ill sign moderna booster. Gotta collect infinity vaccines snap 50% covid existence. can’t recall non-vaccinated person *more* contagious vaccinated person, last read vaccinated person still contagious. 

With said, vaccinated people less symptoms, less symptoms means probably less transmissibility aren’t coughing sneezing much undoubtedly increases contagiousness individual. 

Based basic logic, would easily venture say non-vaccinated person would contagious vaccinated person, vaccinated person still contagious (from I’ve last read). Fever? j&amp;j back April, going 7 days fever, waiting covid test result. expected happen last week. looking data, completely warranted order stem circumstances led Texas Florida reach ICU capacity.

I would also arguing time sending kids back in-person classes, risk Delta greater original strain. defies comprehesionable logic.

I also believe without ""end game"" incentive boost vaccination rate, hard pressed convince anyone hesitant go get vaccine already (excepting kids, vaccine approved use.) Masks delay tactic decrease infection rate manageable level longer period time; vaccination tool use end pandemic. cannot get board this, can't friends anymore. symptoms? long take recover? Well, that's truly novel way reach herd immunity unvaccinated die huge numbers.

How truly generous would volunteer die. since choose way better world, respect choice waste medical supplies effort treating them.

huge /s free~~dom~~ dumb US, vaccine paid federal government. people refer free nothing free. . . Insurance companies paying vaccine, cases paying administration vaccine vaccine itself.

Where received mine, filled paperwork one check ID. vaccine events, anyone could likely show get another jab. Man remember seeing nurse reuse surgical mask clinicals thought disgusting. wearing week old n95's 16 hours day I'm like ""damn, I'm disgusting."" makes bit concerned overall vaccination percentage claims. ""extra"" shots accounted? believe so, would likely difficult. Agencies provide health, dental, vision insurance, often times arrange housing transportation. lot administrative work typically falls agency arrange (drug screen, background check, antibody titers), bear cost.  Thanks much! great day!  Thank you! think we're stage pandemic anecdotes helpful one. think happens sometime FDA fully approves vaccines good amount kids 12 able get it. start seeing various different mandates businesses government. 

At point basically anti vaxers need either get shot end situation destroys life/plans. sit back laugh them. go r/nursing. wave looks like it’s going brutal think whoever administers supposed paid old Uncle Sam. ask insurance I’m sure why. 

My hospital tried charge insurance company, said “lol no,” hospital sent bill instead. also said “lol no” hospital admitted mistake took care it. still test yourself, testkit like 80 cents. However, results take-home teats can’t used passporting. Good you, long term effects definitely scary adult doubly young. 

I think lot people scared though, two kids vaccine age possibility łong term effects like memory loss respiratory complications makes understand concern people going batshit crazy. Thank you! wonderful day!  Lmaoo 😂 Sure, got vaccinated. 

So get itchy throat fall want cautious, still pay? bet you’re really jealous “freedom” Florida. Population. Florida 15 million people Missouri. Also, tourist destination. break cases per 100,000 like counties do, there’s plain people visitors, there’s going cases. 

Also, don’t know numbers I’d assume majority reason Florida high vaccination numbers senior population. Florida also high population young people young tourists that’s going offset numbers. work hospital southern California numbers demographics region’s covid patients age spike lot younger winter 2020 summer 2020 spikes young people lying vaccinated going regular events. I’m sure case much worse Florida. Depends beach, crowded festival honestly. experience breakthrough cases among elderly. nursing home we've several breakthroughs among vaccinated residents none among staff. staff unvaccinated gotten sick far. vaccine boost immune system, 80 years old dozen serious problems boost still enough immune system still weak.

Not say can't happen among young, healthy people much less likely. Well surely easily influenced among us fall propaganda reinforces unfounded fears. Antivax really one dumbest takes person have. saved Millions lives saved Billions dollars. pretty simple see Putins russia would want sow antivax sentiments west. Meh. shots getting added vaccine percent new vaccinations? makes big difference. Yeah fellow Kentucky I’ve always considered state much neighborhood Indiana Ohio Illinois “ south “ really think Kentucky considered hick redneck State it’s impossible say name without accent really excited Psycho Las Vegas, canceled last week. EU bands dropped due banned coming (probably intelligently) it’s really terrible idea pack tens thousands people indoor festival right now. Sha Sha Sha Sha. Pocket Pfizer!! Long days pleasant nights Best wishes him! daughter vaxxed, school (by reckoning) provax demographic, I’m hopeful go OK, obviously I’m worried little well. CA teacher adding makes feel safer return original point, would give money someone who’s proven time time they’re going use help themselves? don’t want die, can’t take away free allows kill alcohol. I’d rather save money instead throwing away someone waste it’s offered anymore. Preach! cannot wait go polls smite idiot vote challenger. It'll interesting Health insurers start similar things covered. I'd guess threat high priced unvaccinated care might change minds rather quickly. That’s true person saying close beaches festivals would whole episode peggy comes plan trick thinking vaccine denialism conspiracy. remain fixated people keep responding posts making assumptions false completely miss actually arguing for.

The burden make clear. 

If I’ve misjudged intentions, apologize. truly believe vaccine mandate, continue assert little concern private health information, since everybody would vaccinated except former teachers, would legitimate reason schools discuss private health information, including vaccination status, former teachers.

If want show support teachers longer able teach school due inability comply mandate, write glowing letters reference continue advocate implementation public health measures vaccines masks, (hopefully) eventually reach herd immunity, giving reason optimism vulnerable people unable receive vaccine medical reasons, well everyone else Yes did, felt heavenly! Also around holidays buying (and drinking) lots wine. saw ID required. Still, imagine would crime lie vaccine form. Lots school districts Georgia requiring masks. looks like cases reported actually cases already active first day, don’t know yet much masks work slow spread school. we’re run real-life nationwide experiment find out. exciting. data available months, course late anything with, “I told so.” burning.

And Abbot ilk brought gasoline wieners stick. I'm cowboy 
On steel horse ride… also depends fast mutates. large amount virus circulation gives opportunities mutate. mutations get around resistances previous infections vaccinations. We're already seeing Delta. Don’t forget one room shack came tonight. Hello everyone. quick question put argument rest brother inlaw. COVID vaccine reduce transmit ability people. Comparing 2 similar people. 1 vaccine one without vaccine. get COVID one contagious other. Thankyou Sure wish Governor would same, add lot professions list can’t denied vaccine showing ID. One thing remember, mask mandates never enforced Texas (apart perhaps schools). live Texas, wore mask mandate based CDC guidelines. also fully vaxxed routinely wear masks public without mandates. went wal-mart today, I'd say 1 10 people wearing masks. mandated statewide tomorrow, 1 10 would wear masks. Mandates without meaningful enforcement always meaningless. exactly. Travel live I've got trip Greece Italy booked three weeks. [covidestim · COVID-19 Rt charts show Alaska, Delaware, Kansas, Nevada Rt 1 currently, corresponds past peak. also shows states' Rt values trending downward moment (including close 1), which, keeps up, means Delta wave may 2-3 months, we'll see crashes right winter wave like last year's. Well, I’m going get forum while. Last thing I’m going say here, don’t want get vaccinated, problem, reason happening, reason poor health care workers going big mess deal with, reason grandpa might able get medical
Attention innocent victim dire need help. quick claim healthy vaccines conspiracies hospital, suffering making video much regret taking vaccine expecting sympathy. Yes, it’s body choice get vaccine, actions reason happening. end this, kindly go fornicate selfish piece dog filth. American way Covid setting ""State's rights"" vs. ""Federalism"" round two, CWII closer think majority cc classes started yet One underappreciated side taking vaccine coming terms fact ideas, things people placed faith monstrous lie.

It's small amount pride swallow. outcome anyone exclude point. least, anyone millions suffering faking suffering.

Like said, science still air subject, amount anecdotes replace relative certainty proffered former. Even [Wikipedia article notes studies various aspects long COVID way, January 2021, definition illness still unclear early draw conclusions mechanism.

I would update ""as January"" bit look like we've gained headway since then.

For know, great deal (self-reported!) symptoms may lockdowns covid. find highly suspicious mild cases disease suddenly produce outrageous constellations symptoms later on. Erectile dysfunction cognitive difficulties? can't even. Well proof vaccination negative tests required places can’t exactly go normal lives without testing key difference amount vaccination. graphic, logic extremely simple. Think cells printer takes mRNA instructions print. mRNA vaccines (and adenovirus vaccines well, although additional step) give fixed number cells instructions 'print' spike protein. that's done process finished. spike protein analogous piece paper spit printer. can't anything generate copies itself, is. wanders around bloodstream immune system notices it, learns destroy it, gone. need boosters child vaccinations authorized NOW. need burn piece shit mask already... mean doctor says covered insurance anyways Yup happened covid ventilator what's killing much o2 bad body /s 🤦 month every place germany hit threshhold though october? Pretty sure whole country ne 35 ten days. thought immunity really last long-term said it, within six months probably fine. I’m pretty indifferent West vs China stuff already tell super pro China say shit wife parents say.  Last heard China didn’t release peer reviewed research vaccines. Hell super pro China mother father law skipped went get American vaccine. 

I give China credit one thing good making extremely loyal citizens.  wife parents talk amazing Chinese vaccine flying go get American vaccine. Lmao  get it. stop giving free tests. start mandating must tested. GG. Stiko still recommending j&amp;j 60 year old crime... kids vaccine widely available 3-4 months, full FDA approval comes fruition, pandemic won’t necessarily think country move towards endemic mentality (I.e trying find balance living live avoiding Covid)

Barring variant increased lethality complete vaccine resistance showing up, states actually restrictions likely won’t implement much going forward beyond mask mandates whenever there’s spike cases. would proof previous infection within last six months good enough? I’m told
You comments take breath, never take freeeeedom!!!  work place weekly testing since last year. vaccines become available, first group offered them, started testing required vaxed unless show symptoms, else get tested weekly. 2000 people employed location, less 40% 1 shot, less 35% fully vaxed. 

Hell, county barely 43% California. That's outcome anyone exclude point. least, anyone millions ~~suffering it~~ faking suffering. 

It would certainly better outcome Social Security system swamped point collapse new applications people rendered unable work COVID seek go disability. 

I think likely, many virologists world warning likely outcome appear agree.   Pretty much leaders that. problem something unpopular could create long term damage risking worse replacement. 
 
It's worth noting least half California mask mandate due local leaders, state better most. However, statewide mandate would still help. may result bowing crazies. 

But article speculates, think likely example administrative laziness/lack foresight. CDC (frustratingly) probably never really thought would need cards serve verification documents.

I suppose we'll never know, CDC completely quiet. Whatever reason, however, makes angry it'll make implementation vax mandates much harder needs Simple throw unvaccinated out.   Texan here. Abbot idiot. making harder us vote speak vote conscience

Ok will! Thank you. vote belong Democratic party. democracy. 

Like said, Newsom crossed red lines. absolutely stupid Dems run backup case candidate. stupid strategy. Instead putting marbles Newsom, backup counting Republican vote spliting. win either way. 

The Dems got cocky may burn them. reason, alone, infuriated them.; Stupid unvaccinated asses ruining everything Keep mind percentage vaccinated individuals expected go *up* time. says less vaccine’s efficacy, population sample. 

Say 1000 infected, 100 go hospital, 5 vaccinated. percentage vaccinated patients hospital 5%

Over time, people get vaccinated, reasonably expect infections go down. using reporting standards, say 4 months things control it’s like 100 people get infected, 2 go hospital. 1 vaxxed. Now, rate vaxxed patients hospital 50%. taking measurement low number.   Unfortunately, straightforward question answer.

The good news is, [the UK whether infected people transmitted people live compared vaccinated unvaccinated people found vaccinated people transmitted people live half rate unvaccinated people. study people one dose AZ (not used US) Pfizer, numbers fully vaccinated people would hopefully even better.

The bad news study done April 2021, probably safe assume basically cases Alpha variant. CDC recently announced Delta variant saw viral load equal infected vaccinated people infected unvaccinated people, said think means they're equally likely transmit. There's reason believe that's quite true, instance [this shows viral load starts same, drops much rapidly vaccinated people, even appropriate measure contagious person it, vaccinated person stays contagious much shorter period time. Yes, vaccinated reduce contagious average person is. Things gotten little complicated Delta contagious, mean vaccine effect. less likely contract breakthrough case vaccine average lower viral load (so emitting less virus) infected shorter amount time do. predictions usually right. That’s good call, Hospital Admins typically blow too. you’re dodging bullets.  Ventilators run itself. needs nurses, respiratory therapists, doctors on. learn last year peaks.  bad people vaccination likely flaunt rules hence susceptible get virus spreading it. lambda variant making way around world can't understand policies. need testing continue, masks worn people remain physically distant least another year majority world's population vaccinated sure create continue feeding new variant resistant vaccines. imagine enough employees would call quit cause delays.  want roll closet, turn lights off, lock door. infections general? Delta infects twice number people, logically hospitalized. Oh know, reason pregnant people still get tested free there's recommendation yet. New Mexico 688 cases today. 688! literally checked, still buy food grocery stores lmao. There’s nothing essential blocked, everyone DuckDuckGo see you’re full shit. openly full shit like this, sway vulnerable idiots? That's really fair. need recognize interior massive vacation spot BC AB. people coming region, also needs massive number service hospitality workers interacting people confined spaces. 


Even province-leading vaccination rates, interior would still leading case counts. Delta appears kill faster, although can’t verify that. considering lot stories I’ve reading, it’s like someone got sick, checks hospital, dead 1 - 2 days later. India’s surge also really sharp peak followed shard decline. seems like supremely stupid idea. Starting look like data Israel right along. many people getting breakthrough cases now. We're gonna accept fact every us going get COVID line.  That's happens elect Democrats. Sensible competent leadership. one pay test medical reason. things like restaurants / cinema I'm sure true, can't really blame individual, for-profit hospitals spending money ensure significant excess capacity might rarely go use.

Wouldn't guessed Kentucky places would ahead curve good least trying something unlike Confederacy. Thank you! also 4 year old busy sure! wife got first Pfizer poke last Tuesday. hit 20 weeks nurses said get wouldn’t get (we live Charlotte area).

Scary.  article please? gf’s sister pregnant unvaccinated would really helpful show her. would advise get vaccine.

BTW - MD sounds like hack. Doctors didn’t give assurance taste buds return normal. Abbott. read original article? looking **severe** breakthrough cases breakthrough cases. first big city hit

Again... even 100% current cases die, Florida still ahead New York. bad government response was.  bad, cases lower near 100% exposed Exactly! Florida's governor says media fear mongering anyway. totes room take overflow Arkansas rest us. don’t believe arguing good faith.

Please illuminate think I’m really here. simultaneously claim agree vaccine mandates, complaining whole town knowing medical status. Throughout entire thread complain parents asking vaccine status sharing answer parents, people making Facebook posts it, consistently tried explain vaccines condition employment, would private medical information shared parents, since everyone would vaccinated.

Here believe. 

1. agree vaccines mandated teachers. 

2. teacher vaccinated mandate, school teacher owe explanation parents since probably medical reason. 

I don’t think either points contradict other. know others said parents won’t ask mandate. responded poster said would want explanation teacher wasn’t vaccinated. One would naturally assume since claim support vaccine mandates teachers since claim teacher yourself, medical conditions would prohibit vaccinated, 

All claims true. reasons persistent concern parents knowing vaccine status entirely unclear.

See 2 points above. motivated altruistic concern hypothetical rare individual unable vaccinated due underlying medical conditions, noble you,

That really thing trying say. people tough position deserve business public. rather forced share medical information parents, individuals may forced (or could voluntarily choose) seek employment another school district another state without vaccine mandate.

That’s fair solution. said that, don’t believe motivated altruism

Please tell think motivated by.  15,322

You get FL here: Here’s fact check BBC: — “This theory comes misreading Japanese study. study involved giving rats much higher dose vaccine given humans (1,333 times higher). 0.1% total dose ended animals' ovaries, 48 hours injection.” frustrates ""it's 99.9% survival rate"" folks. hospitals become overwhelmed good luck heart attacks car accidents need life saving surgeries.

Like sound optimistic (God forbid sub), CDC numbers provided actually good thing, right? links sources?

I suspect based leaked CDC slide deck. Fucking Christ, guess shouldn’t wasted time. Yes, believe children protected via things like mask mandates wait better protected means literally horizon.

I think ramifications worth given know long COVID, don’t think couple months school worth potential damage generation. data doesn’t support reckless here. FL doesnt. CDC does. wonder ... ""Is public health policy personal health policy?"" opinion public health policy, important unvaccinated person get vaccine say everyone needs booster believe less people get vaccinated. think emphasis bit different hundreds thousands relatively small area get infected first. That's unlikely scenario Texas' grid state in. One good heat wave, they're done for. I’ll take Delorian anywhere need go still get tested. government footing bill anymore. see there... fighting un-winnable battle least U.S. many stupid people here, think wearing masks attack freedom, instead realizing need work together country collectively stop COVID future pandemics. It’s frustrating. 

I’m even talking anti-vaxxers. It’s fine don’t believe vaccines, least put mask don’t infect others (if COVID) get infected others. 

The part, I’m ashamed many folks don’t even believe COVID real, even year shit. Really? mean, i'm glad got *something* still. follow-up that's pretty bad especially we're dealing variants. we're point states literally throwing away expiring vaccines, it'd nice least let go waste.  Ventilators? morals prevent helping you. /Radical self reliance/ way anyone tasked going still producing sound bites presidential runs. That’s asking far much.

SAD ask research point somewhat effective. Covid-19 builds air, air filtered exchanged outside air, I'm sure is, could work.

Are underlying conditions preventing vaccination saying put higher risk? father two kids special needs. full care. G tube fed. Diapers, bathe bathe them. daughter Trach night nurse 5 nights week sleep 11:00 pm - 7:00. Life hard enough everyone, throw wife deal add options homeschool kids don’t get services get going school.

Though could school wasn’t session yet (correct I’m wrong), would keep spread among demographic lower. science advanced decades. mRNA Adenovirus platform bring effective vaccine much faster.  Thankfully taste smell MIA 3-4 days. come vax?

Another odd thing getting nose feels like breathed pool water, started morning (day 8). number people unvaccinated natural immunity rises, look like vaccines effective.

Now, side scale COVID Delta. want make rationale decision based data available, fear. masks indoors outdoors, know extent it'll enforced. social distancing last year seems gone, possibly door precautions.

Why hard admit worse outcome expected earlier year? dont remember Fauci saying 60% maybe 70% vaccine uptake would give us herd immunity? one’s implying. Im beating around bush using gish gallop. comments based health experts saying Facebook forums. kids going responsible protect things adult would do. okay. flu mutates every year, new vaccine every year, manufacturer doctor ever claimed full stop prevent getting every variant flu- suspected ""dangerous"" variant. 

the idea single silver bullet vaccine covid, yearly shot able target existing variants time trying play God completely impossible. 

Get vaccinated, get Covid 194752-Kilo whatever circulating, sneeze couple days existing antibodies vaccine yearly vaccine then, get life. Ya wrong, immune response thinking antibodies. 

""a substance used stimulate production  
of antibodies provide immunity one several diseases,

As far understand get antibodies Vaccine Thank you. Good luck. hope things work out. Well let correct myself. vast majority children never need hospital care. go pediatrician things like earaches treated medicine home.

Compared number specialist doctors trained treat sick elderly people, pediatricians treat sick children. Last looked approval rating somewhere 60s like 20 points polls challenger. I’m sure people love least think he’s good job. 

I personally think he’s great job he’s given he’s million times better opponent Jack Ciatterelli awful. Depends go. stayed hotel Munich certainly verified vaccination/tests. Again, implying anyone buy worst fever dream catastrophes follower ""qleader"" shows much pandemic psychologically broken you, badly need seek therapy pull away internet. someone socially distanced, masked, vaccinated, etc. follows science small risk kids us q you, desperately need perspective. actually every step way. virus nothing gain killing children. I'm saying impossible viruses tend get milder time, harsher. People trusting vaccines automatically Russian disinformation campaign?

Most people don’t want get vaccines don’t want get ones. Either think aren’t safe, fine without getting vaccine, something like movie Reba Lifetime wore masks part vaccinated. takes pretty seriously great. worked Dolly recently precautions present that's little worrying. sister CPA. know I'm compliance. depends mandates get full FDA approval real... I've lived Northern Kentucky, like within walking distance across bridge downtown Cincinnati, Lexington, I've spent lot time Louisville.

But, family close Tennessee border Appalachian Eastern Kentucky.... two entirely different worlds Kentucky. Alabamian here. fascinating thing lot bumpkins trust anyone, even elected leaders.

Case point, governor outspoken favor vaccines: newest ""leader"", Tommy person lives here, think people dug even community leaders (i.e. faith leaders) likely ignored. really believe person could possibly reach folks would Trump. Always? mean... think couple things might right on... hospitals filling up. Mild breakthrough vaccinated cases contributing spread unvaccinated people, filling hospitals. stop enough people vaccinated risk hospital collapse. We're yet. That's crazy right? point, seems herd immunity quite sight given pace mutation see COVID. already observed re-infection. even vaccinated individuals re-infected thus continue spread unvaccinated.

For herd immunity work, means vaccinated natural antibodies prior infection act buffer unvaccinated population.

Delta Lambda variants show we're nowhere near end. hard evidence prior infection original strain protecting people delta? No. Positive PCR tests deaths.  deths still worse half states.  They've saying Florida shitshow since last summer, yet deaths never support bunch people sub “trust experts” “believe science” don’t like NPR called CDC inaccuracies. Look comments NPR “nitpicky” expecting CDC convey accurate information. instance, Brazil vaccinated 22% population, received 500m doses, population 200m people - meaning even doses received 2 dose shots

No, that's true - much less likely infected spread virus vaccinated.

You absolutely catch spread virus vaccinated, chance significantly lower. Getting vaccinated helps protect others, yourself.  Pay attention people dying behind curtains... anyone know info long term affects covid? still early tell like links say much? hearing fertility also linked saw barely call news want clear things best possible. pure lazy selfishness reason come with. elderly father law walking string Foxnews talking points masks recent get together absolutely incoherent. really seems boil ""I wanna argument invalid invalid."" quite interest respiratory medicine. 

I'm happy help better informed. long since saw post good news flair. way moon every year flu? Mass vaccination educational campaigns also expertise medice it. Lots people die every year everything learn deal it. ok. blame trying. guarantee convinced people get vaccine. 

You pick battles. Objective thinking work everybody.   doesn’t actually show get greater protection. Ask families 600,000 died QLeader didn’t take seriously enough, chance. understanding world first vaccines variant constitute basically different virus. asked Dr delta antibodies protecting lambda, response: different.

Since (the world) taken guard beginning, first worlders might access tweaked vaccines boosters, global vaccine imbalance exacerbates already sisyphean task.

""They different"" humanities person takeaway. must surreal illness kick ass, also realize experienced toned-down version.  Yes, completely free, day 2, 5 8 tests UK cost £200 though :)  17.9 billion doses? Whoa. Well, sure number reaching need short term, let's see robust quantity like half little bit make till December January. It’s coming place anger resentment. family become seriously ill Covid vaccine available. don’t sympathy left don’t care real hospital collapse, even running higher normal case load extended periods time, especially needing wear full PPE, puts huge stress nurses hospital staff. happen everyone can't take longer quits? *real* healthcare crisis spawned repeated waves COVID hospitalizations due selfish individuals. Actually might doomsday - know feel way though. combine vaccinations immunity gained delta prior infections, future wave shouldn’t bad theoretically. Hospitalizations deaths especially shouldn’t worse. need booster shots - seems like especially people originally got Pfizer vaccine 

FDA CDC keep saying soon soon kids also getting vaccine last thing want bottleneck getting people vaccinated Except there's, know, plenty actual studies coming support exactly same. That’s 60… isn’t shortage shots right needing 200 million definitely redirect efforts vaccinate world, quite problem given many dangerous variants develop unvaccinated countries Yeah, situation here. friend mine wants get vaccinated, parents refusing, kid class got vaccinated delay second dose due heart inflammation. 

They’re anti-vax, there’s still ray hope, recently said they’d “get it’s mandatory” mental capacity wear masks come ok won't

Only they're wearing N95s. Masks primarily prevent spread wearer others. anti-maskers shit. They're putting ""rights"" ahead others.

Other that, comment bang-on. I'm Chile system 80% vaccinated. 

We strict system vaccinations, group people age vaccinated specific day signed national registry vaccinated people.

It literally impossible get booster shot without legally allowed. actually big mediatic issue clinic gave unauthorized third dose director. remember correctly resign. Wow got free? heard free PCR travel anywhere. Schools require everyone wear mask, regardless vaccination status
 
The logical path anyone 12 wear mask, anyone 12 fully vaccinated required wear mask.
 
Any fully vaccinated person required wear mask. find data like bit confusing. lot discussion necessity countries excesses vaccine supply donating countries lower vaccination rates. indicates many countries low vaccine supplies also excess. instance, Brazil vaccinated 22% population, received 500m doses, population 200m people - meaning even doses received 2 dose shots, would enough vaccinate population. true Egypt (they dont enough entire population, enough vaccinate half population, vaccinated 3%). also true India. think plan. think opinions differ end wave / herd immunity three days, three weeks three months. vaxxing

lol! Israel offering boosters elderly cause data showed 50 years old, almost breakthrough cases caused hospitalization. important point 20-year-olds clamoring boosters here. That's downright scary. Outside pretty dangerous jobs, little comparable risk exists long COVID, still develop vaccinated. Getting cold flu work nowhere near likely result long term neurological problems. Yeah headline incredibly nit-picky. Look chart Wikipedia page: *almost* contagious chicken pox, contagious rubella. nobody US intuitive sense contagious rubella is, using chicken pox ballpark comparison makes sense. sure, would accurate say ""almost"" Yeah, would probably change.

Though venn diagram people know edit PDFs, willing every time go out, people want get vaccinated much overlap. Yes, vaccinated people recover faster lower viral load find vaccinated people hit breakthrough Covid-19 infections shed virus faster unvaccinated counterparts, raising prospect faster recoveries shorter isolation periods Catastrophizing mutation ""baby killer"" absolutely unfounded doom, need log go outside. implication anything pants-wetting paranoia puts category anti vaxxers covid deniers shows far rails are.

It’s trending transmissible chickenpox blood clotting rare covid vaccines. it’s common. think misspelled ""turning into"" ""already"" That's keep correcting you. Yes. Seems lot steeper last round. lasts long get much worse gets better. reports vaccines thrown out. comments like violate sitewide rules! Weird boyfriend got vaccinated. I’m hearing lot similar stories. Makes wonder breakthrough cases reported officially There’s big difference million thrown away needing 200 million vaccines boosters. guess we’ll see happens, scary tgough  source lol plain misinformation. Moderna [haven’t published Sequencing shows similar (expected) identical - “how vaccines work” argument? Vaccines incredibly broad class medicines. There’s one mechanism. mRNA vaccines new technology. Presently, data supports position. 50, really reconsider. 71% least one dose 63% fully vaccinated. ""As"" ""like"". Big difference adds confusion mistrust. Better transparent present data people make better decisions. worry changing different mask get work wearing k95 somewhat crowded crowded bus ride. know, overkill not? also told overly dramatic January 2020 first case covid-19 appeared Seattle miles away home ordered 100 N95 masks need work thought might become difficult acquire within months.

I also told overly dramatic February 2020 began wearing masks grocery store.

And May 2020 Trump administration saying would 50k dead, told overly dramatic said would like 500k dead Christmas. 

So perhaps overly dramatic, let's come back comment Christmas Day see whether children's hospitals capacity. 99% survival sounds pretty good. think wheel fortune 100 slots, 99 give nothing, one kills slowly painfully.

Do want spin wheel? much would pay spin wheel, everyone family take spin? reasonable person believe government actively tracking know government collects stores massive amounts information accessed later. highest court Germany ""öffentlich-rechtliche Streitigkeit nichtverfassungsrechtlicher Art"". 

I suppose find exact legal bases Wikipedia elsewhere.   It’s probably way late anyone interested read [full transcript update small team volunteers transcribing COVID updates since March 2020. Right!!! People *do* want children can't they're dead Lets hope works. Getting effective treatment would big game changer dealing this. evolve target them. mutates mutation may dangerous them. figuring next. 22nd 23rd century, we'll probably half machine anyways. used tabletop RPGs, I'm thinking stuff like Cyberpunk Shadowrun. Jack computer network neural implant, optical HUD eyes, sort thing. Everyone Europe also jsut show little piece paper (with QR code). Mine looks like something made using mid-'90s versions Word Paintbrush.

You can't make fully digital, would lock poor elderly people society forever.  rhymes Thanks actual explanation go get one!   long family believes baby's father Bill Gates? /s shot 9 mean Ambassador Germany Mandatory Vaccinations right physical integrity. Drivers licenses renewed think. think employers medical work caregivers require proof vaccination. also think seeking way around mandate making hard vaccinated seen critical education preferred option.  sort prove point less worry government ID theft framed committing felony like fraud? got vaccinated February shortly found pregnant. Unfortunately lost baby second trimester. 2 separate family members believed miscarriage caused getting vaccine, hurtful me. Charge manslaughter many testing sites one could check accounting right amount. [Therefore many cases, **hospitalizations**  little concrete evidence; no-one interested shovel amount money wold needed medical research could prove vaccine replaced not.

So, end, knowing German courts, get slap wrist told please again. clear know culture there, think that's mean mentioned ""it make sense"". might scenario somewhere, maybe, here. vaccines first released public, thought announced could easily tweak vaccine include variants. 

This Jan  Let guess, played 9 holes golf Kim Jong Un afterwards? Yeah don’t want patronising actually commit felonies. worst thing I've done civil violation, traffic tickets. arrested kid, learned lesson stayed clear illegal activity. someone going something like party something, left party want party it. may be. great thing *well done* scientific research designed pander particular point view. regardless anti-vaxxers do, think think, science remain truthful transparent. long run help us all. way. Lol, nice world view.  Exactly. I’m assuming data shows million first shots given actually third shots fully vaccinated people. know really gets me? ""freedom fighters"" comes Corona measures! government imposing new NECESSARY measures, mean ""infringing freedoms"". logic could look anything government pseudo-authoritarianism! Bundesverwaltungsgericht ruling something constitutional? Countries sit 70% vaccinated (with mRNA vaccines) experiencing worst outbreaks date.

You control one single outbreak multiple outbreaks time scattered across several regions far harder control, even time round cases go happen again. effective far, long term strategy - Chinese officials said extremely costly might even achieve end result want (zero cases).

Sooner later China abandon current strategy let virus become endemic, like everywhere else world. Ok article make clear all.
My country, inventing fast antigen test, decided deploy even approve it. get pcr brave 3 hour queues testing hubs. little late Ohhh see. Sorry bad. That’s funny, parents pulled kids public school put private last year private schools didn’t require masks person public virtual One thing add here. 

If get positive test test center need real PCR test doctor later. also come (real) quarantine test positive.

real = get registered ""Gesundheitsamt"" (Health agency/cdc) actually send quarantine order (with fines 10.000€ so) ""Ordnungsamt"" (kinda police) enforce it. get registered mail stay inside. includes VITAL visits like shopping groceries - excuses) No, choice 3 things:

1. Get vaccinated
2. Get tested
3. Stay home

Who magical people can't get shot, money pay need go restaurant/museum/concert/whatever? No, here's verdict Bundesverwaltungsgericht 1959:  get plenty warning since know pass law make something illegal.

No done here, spreading bullshit true. said literally happens. want pop credit card info dubious sites winds darkweb, it. That's choice. think government bulk losses last year, $43 billion, stemmed identity theft scams criminals interact directly consumers steal information methods robocalls phishing emails. Victims scams lost $1,100 average, according Javelin. 

And anti-government sites trust much biggest perpetrators ID theft. least legit company like FB Twitter selling beyond advertising purpose ""company"" buy use help build profile actually engage ID theft successfully. would make sense advocate independent judiciary system holding politicians accountable. argue government power tends abuse it, would abandon whole lot things. example abolish police military, starter. GMA ABC, said millions Moderna Pfizer shot recipients went got third shot even though vaccine approved yet. able get third shot own? It’s universal health care, it’s single payer system. Also it’s nationalised health care system. check people got tested way prevent this. Oh wait. symptoms app gives red warning PCR tests remain course free. quick antigen tests get every corner free. finally country earns something idiots illegal things. might know, guarantee commit crimes civil offenses regularity. Everyone does. [Our law-abiding 99% respondents confessed committing least one felony. probably know felony time survey, matter. 1940s; laws struck since then, many books. Iran currently experiencing worst wave yet, record 42k cases today, 588 deaths reported yesterday. there's anything i've learned years : choice believing government believing lizard people, always choose lizard Watch mental gymnastics accept “rushed experimental authorisation” vaccines, given billions. vaccines still *very* effective hospitalization death immunocompetent people. That’s job.

You might get sick work, risk put entire career.

If unvaccinated kids home, others inmunodeficiencies, see would want come in, though. gender ""a mathematical criteria"" shown via statistics influence odds car crash. It’s going interesting see poll numbers upcoming elections. 

Morbid is, can’t wait see shockedpikachu.jpg faces politicians pushed shit suddenly find unemployed. Oh toll! Familie komplett geimpft außer die kleinsten. Die sollen jeden zweiten Tag einen Test machen! Und ich soll jetzt wegen den impfspinnern zahlen oder was?  Narrator: not. soon you’re ready start new bloody civil war enter complete societal collapse. think government going able forcibly mandate people get injected something I’m jealous naivety. asked doctor could get dose Pfizer since got J&amp;J March. looked like 2 heads think there's weird mindset anti-vax people try convince dig in. anxiety!

I can’t believe amount people subreddit acting like third booster shot, unauthorized officially, essentially popping extra ibuprofen. mother person. believes virus could kill cause lungs already damaged. even afraid vaccine.

It’s really frustrating. tests valid day (or so) right now. school district isnt requiring masks (state law) isn’t require sick kids tested, isn’t required people stay home somebody tests positive, isn’t requiring distancing. Schools can’t shut 10% school actively sick governor approves it. pulled kids… again. I’m trying quit job teach home get vaccinated. 
The successes last year given people much overconfidence. I'm clear need 2nd gen vax specifically Delta, tbh. Data countries Delta significant problem show severe, rapid spread followed steep decline. seems ""hit run"" variant time say certainty whether burns out, sticks around. Lambda nipping heels. Since variants likely way life, I'd personally prefer see efforts directed toward vaccines/boosters confer higher levels general immunity longer periods time. walk thing? (Netherlands) make appointment government portal, government knows old are. big surge. many people left infect. NY least r/PublicFreakout salivating. It’ll like last time, even better us vaccinated people going super pissed well, since right thing getting punished. Basically every single person going fuming this, Venn Diagram overlap people take mask usage social distancing seriously also anti-vaxxers basically one. India covid? months ago, news media west saying really bad, heard much recently. GAH. Industrial bleach indeed: he's selling cure gastritis, probably causing gastritis. strong acid environment it'll readily release chlorine gas.

This household bleach anyone wants compare: 2 weeks parents schoolkids get sick Maybe pay extra charge option?

But since COVID-19 transmission less likely outdoors, don’t really need worry whether flight crew vaccinated unless paid extra “riding inside airplane” option. hand, even vaccinated may contract covid. fully vaccinated (2doses + 3 weeks) would like test least week. yesterday, negative.

If schools stop regular tests, unvaccinated kids get test various things (sports, music lessons etc) like before. fuck right co-opting saying til they’re board original cause, anti-vaxxer’s aren’t. burns quick? mean puts people hospital? kills people? mean? btw goal virus mutate spread another person infect someone who's already it. keep testing mutations finds one react antibodies, keep virus going planet Oof even think that. think right way handle doctor peacefully insisting needs flight order get patients beat physically drag plane?

When someone violent endangering others, using violence means party initiated violence clearly asshole situation. get equal treatment. Everyone needs either test vaccinated.  Unfortunately, think might end incorrect one. mean keep ""everyone"" safe carrier (vaccinated un vaccinated) identified prevent break first tine infections. Better safe sorry? anyone know resources good respectfully changing minds antivaxers?

I’m concerned family (Brazil) politics mass disinformation affect choice. I’m hoping find something clear easy understand would also allay fears trials still ongoing? That's government follow constitution laws.

The government follows constitution laws long people power follow constitution laws.

The US government blemished history violating people's rights selectively enforcing laws. Someone r/kentucky mentioned idea ending mask mandate hit 90% vaccination. 


Unfortunately, there's vaccine children yet. think mixing European Court Human Rights. said it’s legal European countries want to. future one pArty takes years. required die maxims. maybe 2 weeks schoolkids bring home already decided pull incoming 3rd grader school system home school her. fact KY county refuses mask distance unvaccinated kids beyond belief. Bravo Governor making call hardly matters. previous mandates challenged court, many counties already said won’t comply anyways. wonder many children die Delta variant idiots school boards Kentucky wake reality. course people won’t vaccinate kids even approved younger kids.  next one make headlines. deadly enough kill everyone gets it, gone long (after killing lot people). one resistant vaccines one give us trouble. wish people understood time let spread better chances new variant resist vaccines emerge. like Darwin's evolution takes thousands years, viruses replicate mutate daily, waiting one 'stick'. yeah I'm kind scared. Beshear 110% blown away amazing been. 


What Kentuckians thank him? 


We hung effigy tree, via noose...outside house angry mob screamed window.

We literally deserve man who's everything keep us alive.  kids 12 need required vaccinated well. know n95 stock yeah? yes, Delta extremely contagious, there’s also matter limiting viral load. It’s on/off thing. amount exposure get also matters, best wear bandana, you’re still something protect people around you. 

Honestly, it’s piece cloth. Watching y’all tantrum year something healthcare professionals literally every day wild. I’d never thought grown ass adults would selfish babies. inane argument lala vax positive test requirements enter asked participants monitor test afterwards  Yes Vaccinated pregnant lady here! chiming one example thousands women healthy pregnancies got vaccine blame friend. terrifying parent right  Dang thinking was:

United

Jetblue actually know it, term also used New Zealand, Wales, England, Australia (not sure Scotland calls theirs).

I think District Attorneys US-only thing. course, jobs essentially same. thing kids' (private) school sent says masking recommended optional, exposure classroom unmasked kids quarantine masked kids won't. yeah. guess instead everyone masking kid vaccine, teachers get single dirty unmasked kids inevitable exposures occur. Weird stuff, man. feel strongly, lie age get done. Pharmacies check kids ID believe whatever say. (Don't) Ask know.     miss word?  anyone expect guys well educated thoughtful?   

The vast majority professional athletes singularly focused sport since they've children. 

Frankly I'm surprised athlete asked something related sport say something stupid.  ""hard date"" publish. Guess frustrated forever.   yea suggesting didn't, trying declutter actual confusion expressed prior comment. Isnt thing true asymptomatic non vaccinated population?

How many people got covid actual confirmed PCR test numbers?

We dont know.

What know serological studies early pandemic identified 10 15 times people antibodies confirmed tests different locations settings. testing samples blood banks. 4yo son came home first week GA pre-k last Friday extremely lethargic seemed like onset cold something worse. gone back forth quite bit sending felt benefit socialization school learning outweighed risks information hand excellent mask wearing/hand washing practices (Hindsight bit pretty hard decision). running fever next morning coughing/sneezing decided get rapid test came positive. decided also test 3yo brother following day one CVS's self administered PCR tests (he asymptomatic time rapid site used tests). wife took said really putting fight easiest thing world conduct. reason bring PCR result came back negative tonight (Today he's running fever/has chills coughing sneezing day).

My wife vaccinated Pfizer shot back late March experiencing symptoms I'm experiencing coughing/sneezing/sore throat. We're quarantining either way school notified first positive result I'm wondering amiss here. We're considering bringing 3yo pediatrician tomorrow get tested he's showing symptoms sure worth risk/effort. guess self administered CVS test performed well enough struggling came negative asymptomatic. Curious think here.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: positive rapid 4yo/negative pcr 3yo/both showing symptoms retest? know three parents now. 9, 10, 11 year old kids. author never heard word “afraid” apparently obviously bother read article portion indicates there's evidence yet Delta dangerous children.  think lot transmission rate estimates also included masking restrictions estimates. Texas (like Florida) lifted restrictions ago.  Well, posted got permanently banned trying ""recruit""...Some crap like that..Just looking help...lol Oh god. Thank much. you’re older immunocompromised otherwise poor health, are, average, decent shape live life. Ultimately, depends personal risk tolerance.    Doesn’t delta variant work faster? Might why. think vaccinated, good whatever. real concern disease unvaccinated people, fault vaccinated people unvaxxed get sick going crowded nonessential place like tourist destination.  5% US still 16 million people. Thats half people US diabetes. even was/is 5%, that’s still lot people. think professors fear horribly written, grammatically incorrect headline fear delta. Delta? Werent ones tooting horn strictest anti covid policies airlines? interesting.... yes, didn't. won't. know that. Teacher like virtual learning. (Primary school, 3rd grade) optimal situation too. We're private school ample access technology, providing student either iPad laptop. Wealthy families could either work home, nannies au pairs stay kids. Tech-savvy teachers, responsive department would even come homes help needed it. 

And still, lost lot ground academically, saw alarming trends kids emotional well-being. Depression, anxiety, kids used love school learning shutting down. One girl's mom met us online said kept trying get daughter sign onto Zoom, would cry even verbalize why. 

When came back campus last fall, hybrid learning students still home, lot mitigation protocols school. Masks required, HVAC overhauled, HEPA filters every class, handwashing hand sanitizing stations over, kids ""pods,"" health screenings every day, mandatory campus COVID tests employees every school break, random tests times, contact tracing, quarantining entire pods case suspected. former CDC epidemiologist task force met weekly, looking local data, new research, adjusting plans learned new info. 

We cases, one hospitalized, deaths, ZERO spread campus. cases picked campus, visiting relatives, etc. spread school. 

Gradually, home learners eventually started coming back. pure joy able see friends palpable. rules masks handwashing distancing - happy follow, complaints all, wanted school matter what. cannot overestimate vital socialization development well-being. 

And teacher, infinitely easier teach person. give immediate help immediate feedback. kids work collaboratively. wait parents come pick resources. Kids raise hand ask questions, instead remember unmute, hoping one else either home school talking time, hoping heard classroom noise ask eventually give up. Kids school constant distraction home learners screen front them, whatever else going home background. 

It much, much better kids school kids, possible safely. represented USA 2016-2020

I think lot people forget this, us foreigners pretty much go ""not president""? wtf talking about? was.

I say naturalised aussie. ScoMo guy picked. Currently living Poland PIS people picked. Neither preference charge.

Was born kiwi immigration keep asking fuck see passport ahahaha

If like fuckfest next time try make sure happen again. What, Spirit? Nice try, Delta variant. even come common things like strokes heart attacks.  clue downvoted. coworker going shit. trying decide whether request flexible work hours risk job homeschool.... take kid school hope wears mask ridiculed it. Pictures bunch kids dressed vintage floral print dresses granny makeup going vaccinations...

If comment smooth young upper arm looks, coach say ""I avoided sun."" isn’t misinformation correct information time. New variants mean new data. vaccine wasn’t tested delta variant wouldn’t information regards efficacy. It’s “bad messaging” current science. bad barring wearing mask store, I'm done living sequestered life? dont give fuck Delta variant, I'm living life. feel like trying manipulate people types actions leads mistrust backfires. think saw people reacted mask guidance told needed initially help shore PPE. always look say “Yeah figures happened there” Delta-wise appears Orange moment least. Mortality statistics place many cases among young asymptomatic go untested/unregistered. Take will.   fuckin bot whacks Also 99.99% survival rate definitely assuming COVID patients get proper treatment. number going significantly hospitals full. also ~~almost~~ entirely preventable.

FTFY honestly sigh relief. Next Monday determine temporary injunction last case appealed state moved various courts. unbelievable come this. Meanwhile Abbott rather arrest force democrat reps present pass voter laws make harder vote. Taking care children fixing grid guess priorities. unvaccinated people age 70, making hospitalizations since elderly well protected. I'm sure trouble believing it.  RemindMe! 2 months 11 year can’t bring virus home 3 year old? already know vaccine won’t prevent spread breakthrough cases vax. 

My guess also figuring right dose younger. heart breaks groups. (white government) screened many times rightfully can't trust us trying help. like killed ruined lives before, past actions again. heartbreaking. crazy world there, approach dramatic assertions assumption they're extreme people making be, usually right. Dig little, quickly find things nuanced reasonable.

(Problem is, nuanced reasonable assertions get people click, drama drives news!) That's exactly did. found names alone, without IDs accurate DOBs specifically stating insurance. spidey senses tingling? know actually proud of? live TN, live TN, mask mandate, people wear masks not. No, perfect, statewide vaccination rates suck. However, south, republican state, multiple officials threatened ban mask mandates, though happened. Despite that, people masking up. can’t get it. 

We VACCINE.

He's trying win Republican party there's anything know previous Republican primary, loudest, divisive, farthest right person wins. might end helping stand pack. means Americans used 99% product wasted 1% new record efficiency. think makes sense them, yes. zero-tolerance countries floundering low vaccine coverage. Vaccines alone can't stop outbreaks make lot easier control elimination tactics.

As article notes, though, virus never going away, question starting bubble long elimination kept up. Singapore already announced plan eventually transition Zero-COVID accepting level spread (and therefore level death). Elimination originally promoted China stopgap reaching herd immunity vaccination, may possible, what?

That's business, obviously; countries get decide whether ""live virus,"" to. countries managed keep lid it, they'll decide long keep up.

I doubt China make decisions Olympics anyway. never Yup, mild fever headches. 2 days symptoms went away paracetamol think Walensky saying we’re variants away 100% escape variant scared lot organizations cancelling events, sent live events tourism industry state panic again.

Also, lot people plainly don’t want go businesses mask up, since it’s reminder virus makes feel like they’re putting families at-risk going anywhere non-essential. It’s ideal it’s truth. wish pay wall ☹️, title really alarming 😬 Yep saw 1999 visited Greece. like going back time 25 years 1000’s tobacco advertising billboards everywhere seat belts come law. Hopped taxi seat belt plug into, pulled seat cushion put on. taxi driver saw immediately pulled told get pushed back seat said “no belt” quite angrily.

He 20 mins later took truck blind bend nearly killed us. swear people need protected themselves. I’m guessing Texas hope get see family well. Would give Tylenol dose child 1/4 1/5 size adult. 

No. wouldn’t give five year old vaccine dose adult either. 

They waiting data vaccine folks guess issue EUA. Mind officially approved adults either. It’s EUA. Yeah think people give much credit places organized. health department messed beginning. 

Told people - gave extra flyer said ""DO CALL US 2ND APPOINTMENT, CONTACT YOU!"" literally announced FB policy would answering phones all. time came 2nd doses everyone started calling/asking social media. people missed original window unless decided go elsewhere. (I think turned better waited all.) 

Also, said right could mix match vaccines take. came would announce clinic dates, stopped saying vaccine was. said stopped announcing part matter one got - even J&amp;J one shot plus another. can’t assume third shot fine though. trials make sure nothing weird happens. It’s called safety. I’ve thought I’ve lot health anxiety lately, don’t want fuck something that’s still tested. guess time decide, six month mark second shot would September 30. yes, various stages testing various thing makes sense  someone cold unvaccinated, cost testing make test.

And arrive local grocery shop, unmasked.

It's probably better keep testing free, imho nah, gotta get past one first  Articles like fuel antivaxxers. know people post sh*t. people's ""principles"" tend evaporate quickly soon become inconvenient.

The irony. Saying don’t insurance people getting (assuming went insurance first time). think many states passed laws establishing immunity Covid liability. always get second job,

Except likely can't, thanks German labour laws. Sure do. always get second job, matters much them. I'm willing bet doesn't, people's ""principles"" tend evaporate quickly soon become inconvenient. Hi. recently heard talk reservoir animals covid 19 maybe corona virus had? Could anyone clarify that? remember searching China couldn’t find linking corona virus. found?  Except German Grubdgesetz guarantees rights worthy protection. Pfff makes think cares. He's expanding kingdom influx souls doubt choice set exactly single option. mathematically makes choice, legally ethically. Well point delta booster around corner, gov't might well wait available. 

Unfortunatly we're going accept nothing done anti-vaxxers. Short offering $1000 get shot, mandated employer. Getting FDA approval help some, least know personally. That's problem. That's interesting, earlier call choice. Miss. (AP) — Mississippi's top public health official said Monday COVID-19 cases continue surge highly contagious delta variant, intensive care beds available 35 state's top-level Thomas Dobbs, state health officer, also said 200 people waiting hospital emergency rooms admitted, problem grow worse coming days. wait times affect people COVID-19 also health conditions.

… Dallas hospital region bigger states. lot empty ICU beds scattered around little towns still able send really sick patients bigger cities recently. bed exists, hospital really equipped handle serious cases.

Take grain salt, that's I'm seeing based fact little towns I'm close technically part Dallas region that's ICU beds. masks gonna go away then? tldr florida reported X, cdc split number across 2 days per usual. florida comes back said hey guys, three days worth, cdc says okay, splits number thirds instead half.

florida came exact amounts three days, end average still mistake fault florida changing reporting cdc without telling cdc (probably) Precisely point. first time long time actually quite happy decision government. Right, vaccine supposed reduce spread (reducing r0 help end pandemic) also reduce symptoms still caught it.  beautiful job Alpha even preventing infection. Ah ok know that.

Guys please would appreciate help, gfs job mandating vaccines strongly it, feels workplace rights violated seeks exemption vaccine religious reasons. help understand vaccine works purpose is?

""Why people still scared covid they're vaccinated"" etc 'points' brings I'm educated enough answer well traveling hotspots take care covid patients short term basis Hallmark Channel every day...sitting watching lol! keep hearing variants corona virus weaken time goes by, basically seasonal cold corona virus. think makes sense, should, however, look studies Delta variant, higher R0 also higher hospitalization ICU rate. that? refusal get vaccinated also infringes everyone else's freedom live lives.

The virus legislation put place combat infringe freedom.

No positive contribution ending pandemic active negative contribution. put another way.. reaction body reacts unknown pathogen. likely react way real virus plus additional symptoms actual virus does. possible symptom list varied different people react differently exactly meant, thank answer!  I'm longer sure even possible. Covid last year little immunity delta. everyone catches delta year herd immunity whatever potential variant shows six months now?

Who could guessed? Russia places. happy I’m Europe vaccination status proven app. (With printed QR code back battery dies) Basically sharpie chart, wonder number, nurses tell everyone number 1 eyes belief, belief think highly reasonable: body belong society.

The existence illness external factor. restriction mandate policy already service toward society within bounds 


It unvaccinated people putting life risk, virus putting life risk. deciding degree society make rules help overcome external threat.

And degree, argue, stop right bodily autonomy. Choices consequences hope nobody tells people flu shot changes every year. got mine April i’m snag 
Pfizer Moderna winter lol get 2 different ones year? pretend understand minds antivaxxers. might believe virus real think vaccine necessary -- know, like idiots homeopathy natural remedies shit like that. might ""chemicals"" vaccine. know type. Idiots. got plenty homeopathic-dumbasses Germany.

But idiots might get vaccine anyway pay lot tests. Principals tend waver shelling lot cash.

As getting vaccine since anyway, testing locations (at least area) administer vaccines, tests. get vaccine need make appointment doctor. blow oxygen tank bed nurse ? like needles got j&amp;j lol hoping best You’ll need card go cruise. won’t accept copy phone either. card given given shot, little folded card. filled hospital put little stickers with, I’m guessing lot number vaccine. 
Had feeling might fly cruise ship called hospital told lost it.
They made duplicate, time looked official CDC it.
The first one didn’t.  Yes worrying. recent rush vaccines may people rushed get February Would doctor guts, one day, reply: sorry, mistake, nothing indeed, free go, please leave premises ASAP? hell wait october?! want people get vaccinated 2 months...  Everywhere California (starting beach cities) bars packed indoors 100s people since March. Even LA. Even right feel like tie court system years. agree, every person entitled day court, regardless view, healthy society work, way. Vermont tiny state there's big difference 537% increase tens patients 103% increase thousands upon thousands them. Vermont also high vaccination rate, something like 80%.

For second point, looking deaths throughout pandemic. Try looking last 90 days - words surge. fortunate west, even freedom choice countries get vaccine, yet many people choose get vaccinated, people poor countries forced get ""cocktails""... fact 100 million ready go logistical success That’s great philosophy. However, need recognize people intentionally set conned. voluntarily put blinders going meet conmen, could see nothing “marvels miracles”. people made sure put blinders children believe like do. can’t feel pity anyone would actively deny child opportunity make mind.   infringe right making choices body

It degree way opt testing. room whoch choices made free room choice anymore.

I agree getting vaccinated dumb, case consequence present priori instead created legislation. legislation without price egalitarian constitutional, become discriminatory.  opinion right make choices body revoked minute „choices“ put people’s lives risk. choose get vaccinated infect someone else - fair?  Anyone else read/sing voice? stuck damn head. disproportionately effect black brown people okay that?  comments said nonessential shopping. Idk consider food pretty damn essential. School vacation ended, yeah that's probably totally uncorrelated.. exactly point. politicians even said something along lines.

But infringe right making choices body. merely means experience (pay for) consequences. pretty good idea IMHO, making vaccines mandatory, would lead lot backlash stupid people (= anti vaxxers). way still decide die early, take fewer people them. win-win book. right bodily autonomy also basic right, one even fundamental many others.

I agree getting vaccine dumb idea, within spirit society values freedom equalilty create two-class society.

Restrictions mandates catefully lifted, lifted citizens equally. situation criteria mandates/restrictions lifted, way situation came about. seem crazy, you. cost approach high, understand letting virus run rampant go-to approach here, seems like variants pose pretty large threat, stopping/slowing transmission seems like best way reduce overall threat communities (which done without shutting everything - must middle ground able contain spread complete shutdown). Identifying cases, treating isolating case, order reduce transmission rates. Privacy usually remaining completely invisible, creating threat profile deciding activities would put risk consider unacceptable.

I'm fine legal residence using computer there. big deal. mean want location tracked everywhere, someone know I'm using credit card, etc... even understand genuine health concerns 16 set. ""you can't get government conspiracy control you. Covid real."" 😬 US trying force people back work schools hiding failing collect data, shifting goalposts, manipulating statistics, sometimes outright lying.

Exactly! also completely screwed everything saying ""take masks, vaccinated"" tried stuff genie back bottle. catered least us (the anti-vaxxers) failed miserably. pisses much Johnson Johnson even included here. CDC forget us J&amp;J folks? told us J&amp;J vaccine good vaccines (surprise: not), make matters worse even include us future research study. undercount although counts Moderna Pfizer shot recipients ignores people may received one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine got another shot.

At start civil war, Kentucky officially neutral state.

Then confederacy broke neutrality took Columbus, Kentucky Union responded taking Paducah, Kentucky.

and youre still missing point ignoring youre told, argued earlier  [Some data suggests Delta variant might cause severe illness previous strains unvaccinated mean, end finding severity reinfection actually equal less vax, paints completely different picture.

Incomplete data isn’t helpful.  Oh, absolutely. data wrong then. communications. We, society, seem think changing information = wrong/fake information, true all. science works, understanding novel virus evolves. need evolve it. age groups? flu kill teenagers give MIS-C.  we've seen around country hospital situation spiral controls quickly, since Hawaii isolated need manage situation much better can't ship patients hospitals nearby states, also can't easily get supplies augmented staff. survival rate dead lungs good. takes 3 weeks vaccine take effect. Get shot, stay home use home delivery instead going out. Lock politicians denying scientific facts rights. right. Stop trying cut corners. family leaving Honolulu today back mainland. beautiful island vast majority folks wear masks indoors outside. really hope total shutdown like last time. think get recall hospitalization rate kids remains 1 1,000 cases death little 1 10,000. estimates put chances death even lower (have seen 1 50,000) account undocumented cases. bet change it’s fully authorized. tidal wave companies requiring join bunch. corporately irresponsible point. I've US since went autoimmune SARS1 Australia.
Don't envy folks journey discovering rearranged life now.
They grieve old self accept new person, many never work again. also doesn’t show severity reinfection. So, chances reinfection higher natural vs vax immunity, it’s possible severity could similar. need figure out.  US same.
Health insurance coverage Covid w/o vax =$0 mask mandate save lives? nothing kick can. They’re going catch COVID regardless. Herd immunity way come this.  problem? opening slow, large group people refuse get vaccinated. 

The ways get normal life back get ppl vaccinated exclude people daily activities. I'm kind similar situation. April got J&amp;J. reason can't find state database. almost *have* get Moderna shot get ready whatever vaccine passport California cooking later year.  Hmm. try avoid rabies shot? guess place! Good decoy.  could well worst Governor early 21st century. unvaxxed want health care workers suffer Seems argument. approved added list required immunizations, right ?  one hand agree spirit decision, however still lot unvaccinated people important allow accurate overview situation. I'm torn this. Ok. People may go hospital minor issues. 

But — story **admitted** hospital. That’s thing, doctors don’t admit patients minor issues. also refuse hospital care get sick. still trying convince mom (53 years old) get shot. think she'll finally FDA approves.

Good luck! hope accepts makes right decision. country we'll never know CDC choosing track vaccinated infections unless person hospitalized. Football apparently important staying alive there. people continue live fetid swampland? here.. 
And currently inmune system bouncing back 9 months chemo, makes pretty anxious.  got asked alot. Even friends request negative test birthday parties fully vaccinated. worried evolution delta worried unvaccinated vulnerable countries

You presenting false dichotomy here. could both.  Purchase equal delivery.

As says important remember purchase vaccine delivery vaccine.

Brazil purchased 510 million doses. mean Brazil received 510 million doses. goes Egypt, India elsewhere well. Yeah, point think anecdotally know several people who’ve breakthrough infections. It’s hard feel really discouraged. Perhaps highlight reporting breakthroughs limited hospital numbers, fairly limited.   enough people die, including family members voters, including children even, that's kind thing people less inclined forget couple years passed. come election season enemies go enormous lengths revisit disaster. even right hurt base, manages secure nomination, record going repugnant moderates would need win general election. incumbent advantage historically hard beat. I'm still hopeful see President DeSantis. surprising people watched Indian TV news second wave. lot younger people (30 40s) affected Delta variants too.    Thank much do! university hospital (Medical center) basically every week inpatient chemotherapy appreciative nurses, doctors, hospital workers. 

I’m really anxious uptick I’m still immunocompromised unfortunately sure virus would affect despite vaccinated. Also packed hospital makes even nervous even serious symptoms. sure going this, thank insight (whatever specifically hospital setting).  Yes mean new clinical context, since we’re discussing medicines safety. course medications, even newest, technically development decades always point past groundwork research. That’s thing established clinical safety technology.   Doubling every week literally exponential. show pool.

At several places asked checked, apparently problem get fine obligated notify me. people vaccinated, better. deaths identical regardless. It’s question when, if. leave odds reinfected natural immunity severe illness get reinfected. talking tiny numbers 2x odds means nothing not?

It’s “left out” don’t reliable data yet, believe. 

That people keeping claiming they’ve COVID recovered without actually proof back up. 

I’m vaxxed background public health I’d love see conversation turn *immunity* rather simply vaccination status but, don’t think we’re yet. agree stronger mandates needed; however unless state mandates widely, much.

That said, winds may br shifting mandating healthcare, would big. could pull getting done healthcare education, would go longer way preserving healthcare resources general pop health mandate. chart shows adolescent cases/hospitalizations/deaths time?

For much I’m reading Delta dangerous kids, evidence always seems doctor saying kids before. valuable way, I’d like see raw numbers. ""does come original ideas own""

...you're criticizing politician changing policy PUBLIC HEALTH urged PUBLIC HEALTH experts. 

Just *you* think personal opinion things makes expert them, mean rest world is, naive. 

I one thankful world run ""original ideas"" every narcissist thinks know best, instead expertise. I’d like know, specifically re: severity reinfection. lot people I’ve talked hesitant vaccination weirded fact immunity levels natural infection ignored. Whether that’s bc they’re trying stop people trying get purposely avoid vax what, something needs change. Especially passports going become thing (for instance, test antibodies place vax compromise severity reinfection similar?). getting voted got point. Lot smug milquetoast liberals board think system fine problem Joe Schmo's individial choices Nowadays media, second someone cough fever, rushed hospital. happened waiting days maybe seeing regular Doctor first. many hospitalized actually needed hospitalized? whole family vaccinated including me, fear mongering get people vaccinated media control. People need see money invested pharmaceutical companies make vaccines. Flu like symptoms require hospitalization immediately. People actually need hospital suffering.  vaccine like seatbelt. won’t stop getting accident, make accident much survivable. Narrator: every election died ripe old age 93  Yeah I’m wondering long send everyone home. daughter sports allowed practice last month everything fine cases. first couple days school positives allowed close practice going start weekly testing next week able participate. mom resigned nurse last week pandemic. decided risk health excessive hours treating people refuse get vaccinated longer worth took early retirement. tells 30% staff hospital worked resigned since last year. Apparently offered massive bonus stay declined.

There snowball people leaving medical profession this. Checking back thread noticed comment. better masks N95, pain breath often vent approved pandemic, however would work fine work, allergies, letter code oil resistence, N, R P order increasing oil resistence, N not, R 8 hours, P indefinite. number code percentage 0.3 micron particles actually get mask.

The KN95 masks Chinese made. KN Chinese equivalent US N code.

Hope helps. yes wear sanding cause like nostils turn particle board. Yep. bet tested people street randomly, breakthrough incidence would much higher. Israel actually quite lot without full fledged studies showing results. It’s first dibs Pfizer, agreed it. probably know third shot shouldn’t really cause issues first two don’t running it. Yeah it’s overall nothing hospitalizations. apologize didn’t notice comment wanted data. wish would release data broken people review. Receiving vaccine mrna vaccines require consistent super-cold distribution system whose infrastructure difficult ensure everywhere America, much less places like global South fewer resources. cities could use them, J&amp;J vaccine much reasonable temperature requirements single-dose application much better candidate export. compliance exactly? funny say that. social media, linked someone vote DeSantis month ago vocally supportive masks freedom. heard peep person since pediatric hospitalizations increased.

On hand, know someone whose child hospital. person vote DeSantis, population-wise outnumbered retirees care freedom children.

I think ones affected (the children) say governor is.

That said, really suggestion good way solve problem.  feel like would best interest lie then. Less cases high hospitalization rate doesn’t much “it’s big deal” approach.

But can’t always fight emotion logic. ignore it, act like world end tomorrow need immediate lockdown imprison unvaccinated. 
It one case. Come back thousand, relevant society. Yuh, uh...it going up. we're even school yet. Stay tuned. See feel two months.   forgot Bill Gates runs international patent office /s  Given CDC's history mask mandates fact countries rolling boosters, I'm highly skeptical CDC acting behalf science. think CDC simply sitting booster recommendation want spook unvaccinated thinking vaccines effective. Yeah mean assessed safe beneficial. I'm two years sober sure would call alcoholic... recently panic attack one wife's friends left couple beers fridge, one cheap brands used drink.

I lot things problem ice cold beers fridge step far me. also reason believe can't happen. delta strain developed significantly reduce effectiveness non-mRNA based vaccines. New South Wales Health Officer telling people converse others outside, really? We’re going back again? 

It’s like we’re back March 2020. Football Jesus #1 #1A Alabama. Yeah would hope so.. guess would whole reason vaccine, since already antibodies armed ready speed conspiracy theory goalposts change, would bet even Trump make public service announcements vaccine campaigns, people would either think stunt double, Trump wants democrats think he's working them, actually sending code words actually get vaccine. Many - - people way far disconnected reality part greater good. it? notice response Qult comment? Aka Q-Anon believers tend lot overlap ""all lives matter"" crowd... DeSantis fiddles Yes heard also, also way. know certain yet, guess. 

But higher amounts kids getting it, hospitalised. danger also lies bringing home variant think read ten times transmittable original dealt with. aware anything going on? HÀ NỘI — Ministry Health reported 8,766 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday.
There also another 342 coronavirus-related deaths announced.

Fourteen new infections imported rest detected community.
HCM City recorded highest number new cases 3,416, followed Bình Dương (1,897), Đồng Nai (979) Long (963).

Of new fatalities announced, HCM City, 261, increasing total number deaths nationwide 4,487.

There currently 489 people critical conditions 21 on life-support machines. — VNS Right, he's really moron. also went Yale. much palatable think dumb though vs accepting he's evil jackass personal agenda. another part article mentions ""less 2% experience hospitalization"" due COVID. school 2000 kids 40 would hospital entire school got infected. That's quite lot kids. someone told child even 1% chance going hospital something easily preventable I'd scared. look prism person talks. 

Politics. Rather telling truth, it’s easier twist turn narrative opponent. 

Public health officials, daddy Fauc Mrs. Walensky going try avoid overwhelming hospital system, anyone doesn’t get hospital needs die.  goes goalposts, we're wanting everyone 3 doses move lives. local news literally published study Mayo Clinic: unvaxxed would sway Moderna I’m also high risk consider what’s best get myself. comment makes sound like don’t want people healthy means possible; want healthy receiving vaccine. Isn’t wrong priority? cure discovered tomorrow, would reject it? consider cult member cutesy nickname? Please offer medical advice please suggest people violate vaccine recommendations. Think figures gave overall population would like add takeup high certain area given majority hospitlisations would vaccinated since would unvaccinated people left infect. Like 90% adults vaccinated would probably start expect majorityof hospitlisations vaccinated. Ofcourse hospitlisation figures though lower area low vaccine takeup. likelihood fully vaccinated person transmitting disease? Like, break me: 
 
The likelihood vaccinated otherwise healthy person getting breakthrough infection. 
 
The likelihood said vaccinated person transmitting disease to, say, unvaccinated otherwise healthy child. assuming endgoal. far news, polls, demographics looking say half US children learned virtually many even seeing live teacher day. 

In August last year 52% US students districts provided option meaning could attend class love maybe less half normal population plenty space students time people masks. Versus masks encouraged students in, already crowded classes, packed together. 

Help see differently. R0 affected numerous biological, sociobehavioral, environmental factors govern pathogen transmission and, therefore, usually estimated various types complex mathematical models, make R0 easily misrepresented, misinterpreted, misapplied whole heartedly disagree I’m going save post r/agedlikemilk We're coming 2 years hearing, ""It's flu."" 

There huge difference comparing covid flu March 2020 (objectively wrong) comparing covid vaccinated people flu 2021 (actually reasonable comparison). 

You really want either them. cause lingering symptoms--this common serious viral infections.  Depending health, *can* kill you, relatively rare.

Ashish Jha--head Brown School Public Health--has explicitly said covid like flu *for vaccinated*.

You continue take precautions want, society going ground halt this. nobody age 12 vaccinated, need mask up. I've switched cloth masks N95 equivalent last year. effective, wear somewhat properly. hard so, there's picture box!!

And, Desantis really push vaccines? seen anything lately. seems pushing back lot vaccine-related issues. ""what least would willing save American lives?"" That's pretty promising, must good shape! thing first one (Pfizer), hopefully 2nd mild. Local news quoting new Mayo Clinic study vaccines vs Delta, suggesting Moderna 70s Pfizer dropped 42% July. Interesting stuff, thought I’d share: say work seeing lot breakthroughs right coworkers families, extended circles seeing good amount. ones dying anything yes shots work getting pretty sick (at home). Hope let us start getting boosters sometime figured out. know lobster comes from. live Ocean State: http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/marine-fisheries/recreational-fishing.php

Do keep up, hilarious.  Pfizer. First dose, sore injection site. 

Second dose, Mild headache, moderate fatigue, sore spot injection site, increased appetite. cured spending day couch snacks Netflix, dose ibuprofen. 

I’d planned next day work anyway, flu shot usually kicks ass bit, wanted prepared one too. really wasn’t bad, though. What’s problem Brother law terrified covid terrified vaccine, person know feels way. gone pretty much anywhere entire pandemic refuses get shot. actually sounds illegal! Hello, Mrs. Spreader misinformation. purposefully posting bad info, spew garbage mouth regular basis? Wow! Never said anyone evil. Hospitals trying stay float lost revenue surgeries procedures. extra funding covid patients help make that. family friends nurses hospitals empty whole pandemic. feel everyone get vaccinated people choice. Getting vaxed choose Moderna Pfizer. Anyone know info help decide 2? I’ve heard Pfizer less side effects Moderna better Delta. truth this? right headlines without much merit Pfizer, bruised sensation injection site, jabs. nothing. 63 yo male. 59 yo wife, Thanks clarifying, shit still pretty fucing contagious 🤦🏿‍♂️ vaccines effective delta another (like may case lambda) lambda start dominate especially higher vaccinated areas. 

And unfortunately variants concern seem increasing transmissibility 2-3x base covid. Buried quote expert:

""This kind surprising finding needs confirmation accept validity,"" said Cornell virologist John Moore.


Also headline, ""WAKE CALL!!!"" surge COVID-19 cases also prompted Brevard County Fire Rescue Chief Mark Schollmeyer urge residents stop calling 9-1-1 non-emergency calls, leave hospital emergency room staff facilities — BCFR crews — handle urgent medical emergencies.

This paragraph took back beginning pandemic NY epicenter pandemic something prevent happening now. Per capita, 5 least vaccinated states 10X hospitalizations 7X deaths vaccinated states yesterday. 10 dose vial becomes 20 dose vial. think things mostly normal kids vaccinated. least, that's light end tunnel me. that, would shocked annual boosters become thing. already get flu shot year, really big deal me.  Yeah dude real idea Skeletor keeps getting office. Maybe take grain salt since live Orlando, liberal city state. major pharmacies clarified they're longer asking ID adults getting vaccinated. time ask ID requiring birth certificate ID showing child's age ensure least 12. 

I also took neighbor get vaccinated Saturday county site. ask ID either. pharmacies it, doubt county site either. Appreciate level headed response. 

What said makes ton sense, seems odd wasn’t effort try get data this. We’ll never 100% vax rate, natural immunity huge aspect entire thing. Africa full major cities infrastructure. plenty locations throughout continent handle vaccines. ignorant ultimately tragic deny vaccines Africans. worth paper compares flu covid children. age group 0-18, I’ve seen sources lowest mortality complication rate covid flu occur roughly 5-11 age group. Uk patients hospital peaked 6k vs 40k Jan 3 doublings would trouble (currently cases hospitalisations pretty flat hard tell happen next). wish focus 'beds', real issue staffing beds. ICU's fill up, overworked staff going start leaving. what? happened Arkansas Texas probably states. Nah, they’ll probably approved smaller dose. worry I'm sure state attorney general fighting travesty justice courts. Let none deny virus' free travel upon land schools. (/s case obvious.) sort good news they're also throwing away voters time. (Taking innocent people though.) course wouldn’t go comments internet, conversation. need condescending. Feels like it? Especially brief quiet period, experts think, barring new variant pierce vaccine displace delta, last surge circulate low levels. Moderate headaches came went waves. started around 22 hours post vaccine lasted around 12 hours. Mildly sore arm well.

Moderna. Alright, thanks. Thankfully I'm still vacation, chill home possibly lay bed day.  Lots 2020 elections south decided narrow margins. republicans want lose another 100,000 voters 2022 midterms let go it.

""Colds"" family illnesses caused 100 different kinds virus. colds caused rhinoviruses. colds caused coronaviruses. would better job this. Even hits meth. He's poster-boy unaware. south throwing away tens thousands unused shots delivered governor’s mansion Biden Fauci. sensible person, ""kids can't get COVID"" shorthand ""children rarely die develop serious complications COVID"". Although presume there'll people take literally. mildly sore bicep. interfere daily activities. Don’t forget: Desantis went Harvard understand need rush things, really comfort Dad dies breakthrough case waning immunity FDA took long authorize booster. mean, long be? year? More? UK *right now* theory car numbers go much higher crashing hard runs people infect. high vaccination rate massively helped keep hospitalisations deaths compared last wave. Would even better could get folks vaccinated going blame unvaccinated never ending pandemic would either stupid, delusional ignore 5 billion unvaccinated people world. unvaccinated friend told getting Novavax soon comes feels comfortable it. basically lockdown then, though. 😭 Killing kids worse, think.  work daughters school, get check throughout day, it’s still unnerving! discussing vaccines year (we also get yearly flu shots due hospital scare oldest) she’s ready. even seen side effects realizes it’s better death covid (our neighbor passed right vaccines rolled out). comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

US laws public health managed different UK though. NHS may managed individual governments one umbrella. US, public health managed pretty much individual states. US CDC advise FDA controls drugs. set state policy though. policies set individual states. 

The two huge policies federal government set making vaccine free (after age state restrictions went away) asking ID. massive population undocumented immigrants homeless. Larger anyone imagine. wanted make sure people think going targeted arrest asked ID people may get vaccinated. rightly so. need everyone vaccinated regardless status. Whether states federal governments great outreach populations different story. necessarily. true numbers perspective sheer billions people without vaccine risk mutations. mix vaxxed unvaxxed creates selective pressure breakthrough variant emerge.

We're created gate half population get vaxxed half not. may there's way evolve past gate (like Polio) testing shit it. There's much discrepancy official covid deaths excess deaths florida countries mentioned, afaik curious. understand correctly, Moderna doesn’t actually contain dead virus, rather instructions combat it, something like that. major reaction second jab? kind expected reaction since got one got shingles vaccine, surprised Moderna shot actually hit harder shingles vaccine. Mind you, zero reaction first Moderna shot.

Edit. I’ll first line third shot need be. I’m big believer vaccines. curious reactions. Barbara Jean's fault trials beforehand, though? whole point prevent infection prevent severe infection and/or hospitalization. sure can't use single case proof vaccine claims do, FDA use Pfizer/BioNTech's, Moderna's, etc. multiple thousands cases observed safety efficacy testing proof vaccine claims do.

Just side note, Houston ISD largest school district Texas, actually cover Houston city limits, there's school districts cover portions Houston, like Alief ISD Spring Branch ISD (I think total 20 districts cover land located Houston city limits). It'll interesting see many follow HISD's lead also impose mask mandates.  mean, downside impressive earlier control measures Aus/NZ region little way natural immunity, vaccine efforts little slower. kinda *are* US EU last year. Yet reason this.  That's extremely limited study one hospital sample size 164 covid-19 subjects 64 flu. also ignores emergent variants since time period March November 2020.

This see people get hung on. Yes, vaccines create sterilizing immunity, work fight infection faster effectively, data suggests reduces infection risk, likely deduction that, minimum, they'll still reduce chances infection, even primary function. I'm curious. number children died? .06% what?  Right but...I would expect case. go home wherever are. sure goes said. 

It'll still far worse here. awful situation Florida right now, lucky happening late pandemic. Right 100 deaths per day awful. reference, New York State dealing 1,000 deaths per day pandemic started vaccines NYS even lower population Florida. Florida middle pack terms vaccination rate I'm assuming ones get vaccinated higher risk individuals might keep deaths astronomical like New York State getting pounded. Florida lucky 10x worse right now. unaware shipment publicly asked for? Trump would breezed re-election did. Knowing delivery you’re stillbirth already hard, nothing really prepare silence. know won’t cry, somehow still expect it.

This part really truly gutted me. sorry loss. Thank sharing deeply personal traumatic experience us detail, people need know dangerous COVID unvaccinated pregnancies, badly affects chance success future pregnancies. 10 lbs overweight, walk 2.25 miles two three times week, drink every day, cook scratch lot, eat fish, shellfish veggies, minimal red meat. low stress lifestyle retired R0 highly-vaccinated societies would obviously lower, therefore easily managed. virus mutate towards killing children people listen reason. least state could've opened vaccinations lot sooner. Vaccinations started falling cliff barely 5 weeks opened general public. Basically new people getting first second shots. 

I remember nurse giving second shot telling throw away seven batches six doses half people never even showed appointments. back early May. said could get third shot I'd sign immediately. Cousin doctor Florida. Coincidentally right worst Covid hit last year gotten offer hospital Boston. timing fortunate.

Well said. Shutting every time also catastrophic effects people's lives terms economic, social, psychologic, etc. ""slippery slope"" argument generally intellectually dishonest logical fallacy.

How many times heard people claim laws things speeding, trespassing, slander, public nudity, etc. ""slippery slope""?

""If government regulates fast drive vehicle, long regulate many loads put washing machine?""

""If legally allowed wander certain properties, what's stopping government restricting movements?""

""Oh, legally required justify accused person nonce? next? accuse someone ""poopy-head"" without potential legal ramifications?""

The people use ""slippery slope"" argument generally fearful cowards lack kind intellectual integrity.

Personally, longer entertain kind arguments. Also employers provide tests create proof used well.  That's good distinction, thanks information.

Personally problem people paying selfish choices. case locking isolation camp accept vaccination, would something need debating, they're denied basics life, food, water, etc. Jesus wept, vulnerable people world can't get one dose Americans talking getting third hell medical advice. point federal government intervene mad king killing everyone? That's serious nitpicking there. good data narrowed range person thinks closer 6, range given presentation 5-9.5. guess technically said Delta variant possibly transmissible chickenpox, again, that's serious nitpicking. Grim reaper loving deaths, heard hes considering moving south. live Orlando.

As right foreseeable future, I’d go hit cancel button playa. would awesome, probably see either. Sucks born was, cusp wondrous technology infancy knowing never see endpoint. got see us move analog world digital world much potential never realize potential. Zoomers though... sort jealous possibility still them. Yeah getting point healthcare workers people got vaccinated early like myself, it’s 7-8 months since second shot entering next psychotic wave. 

I really don’t blame people looking flu shots vaccines thinking holy shit need protect way *do* know illnesses require boosters I’m looking breakthrough infections it’s becoming increasingly common. advice doctor condition “it’s safe think you’ll be” isn’t “allowed advise one way other” welp doesn’t really fucking help. Well thats bit like saying banana water-pistol atomic level. FDA still fully approved vaccines, we've giving since, what, January? 

What's relevance that, FDA need fully approve vaccines approve boosters, approve boosters based data, first second boosters Delta already come gone we're dealing Omega strain

You realise strain specific boosters right? developed original covid. Yes, evidence doesnt suggest benefit boosters Delta, may end waiting really understand taking long 

Because data currently support boosters except immunocompromised, maybe vulnerable. vaccines provide sustained protection even waning, benefit entire population getting third dose may outweigh benefit giving doses somewhere like India prevent omega evolving first place.  Lots mammals catch Covid, deer, cats dogs example *until school starts. Arkansas school begins 16th. Please US!

People sub vote comment criticizes/questions pandemic, laws, vaccines (even though comment isn't) xD, probably read first 5 words xD  point EU pass digital regardless paper phone, QR code contains digital signature guaranteeing authenticity info First, person whose comment deleted American share health reasons. said told need vaccine infected before. that's simply current medical advice says. Hiding comments spreading misinformation good thing. 

Now greater complaint here...I think seeing want to. seen anyone shared actually legitimate reason vaccinated countries without access yet people downvoted that. Heck, even saw article people actual phobia needles comments pretty understanding difficulty.

And really much legitimate reason vaccinated vaccine country access. someone's going online saying world vaccinated available need giving actual legitimate reason convincing others without legitimate reason vaccinated. 

I'd love link comment bring up. I'm guessing context there. gets third shot helping limit spread mutation Delta


This ridiculous, know time frame third booster gives additional protection, meanwhile worried evolution delta worried unvaccinated vulnerable countries. Every vaccine dose mopped selfish people going third, fourth fifth doses expert reccomendstion means fewer vaccines available donate parts world variants likely emerge Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

Now, good day... sir. understand frustration let's pressure organization that's actually responsible it. Pressuring CDC going speed things up. pretending posted good faith. It’s really big deal things accepted. Everyone dies something eventually. can’t eliminate risk death, mitigate it.  need infrastructure check whether someone vaccinated not. Costs time effort. Needlessly. add '/s' ruins joke studies shown vaccinated first risk long term effects well? That's like saying science silent covid vaccines 5 year olds, may well start vaccinating them. science yet boosters, wait is. worried wasted doses, given away countries, incindentally likely beneficial us third doses. next big bad variant going evolve unvaccinated people low risk taking third vaccine doses. Dank Ages Yes difference coding active ingredient literally molecular level come cutesy little nicknames groups people I'm adult. sound like think much smarter are. find one day like everyone else. Ban movie theaters, restaurants, bars (non-essential businesses) untill do. bet get vaxed then. There’s evidence suggest Delta disproportionately effects children previous variants. It’s worse across board, children included. live see it. =( bad want HUD eyes work without glasses mentally use computer instead typing crap? I'd also like go Mars ain't happening either. initial studies Pfizer’s vaccine, mostly widely used US, showed 90% effective preventing symptomatic disease. that’s seen gold miners; half ended symptoms like fever. vaccines may still helped, though. **None miners became seriously ill, even though older 50 risk factors like high blood pressure diabetes.**

I mean, exactly concerned about? virus going away, ever. manage symptoms infection keep 99%+ people hospital beds, stop lobbying shut society every time there's outbreak. really shame author went extremely dishonest headline.

It's time stop looking case numbers start focusing metrics. People testing positive without symptoms, even mild symptoms, good barometer anything. would want pressure FDA fast track authorization? Seems like better idea let science take course, clinical trials actually finish first. Shhh, people care death around here... fuck long term problems long suck air. like vaccine lottery states did, instead win medical care. right, order need test need second shot two weeks prior. knobheads rude awakening realize they'll fucked two months decide vaccinate numbers high again. Alabama Auburn football 3 weeks away Vaccines designed around originally virus.

Delta changed everything Assume don’t feel way people choosing get vaccinated?

Look, don’t people follow recommendations instead trying clever based stupid news articles single studies. Hell, companies running booster trials right now. wait finish? Let’s censor understanding group won’t take vax matter what. ""I bare minimum, Im best!"" still threat public though. vaccinated? friend went back like March, unvaccinated. Universal apparently lot relaxed mask mandates Disney. 

End day - vaxxed? feel comfortable? Go. happens next year there’s crazier variant something totally evades vaccine? what? You’ll never go? 

I’m traveling - masking needed required - living life. understand risks, what’s end goal right now? careful diagnosing mild case, mainly someone unvaccinated. disease kills quickly relatively painless, even checked doctor day 2 could still die week later.

The strange breathing noises give away possibly mild possibly deadly. Shortness breath, despite considered common symptom, needs seen healthcare professional monitored. main concern covid Delta still main concern. positive covid test many could mean going without pay many already live paycheck paycheck (fortunately efund neither jobs provide sick pay want coming transmit covid even mild symptoms). Seems like that's pretty poor outcome. Death going ICU seem like life-threatening outcomes. get scientific writing uses sanitized language, also clearly aimed trying convince laypeople get vaccinated. Ask shall hope report 100% wrong. compassion uninformed, ignorant people decided get vaccine paying price.

I compassion around choice also suffered consequences.

I can't bring feel bad someone made incredibly stupid decision put life/health danger, also around them.

I would never root death. could never that. However, compassionate happens. Anecdotal: wife rode around infected daughter entire day knew ( daughter ) infected nothing wife’s J&amp;J shot protecting her. wife never caught it. like J&amp;J house. scientific means helped wife’s concern reported robustness issues J&amp;J versus mRNA shots. dont herd immunity normal flu h1n1 neither... Herd immunity happen.  agree don’t think substitutions make real difference (although always good run clinical trial sure), words you’re using gibberish. 

I pro-vaccine (would walk street dartgun could legally), think accuracy important anti-vax weirdos good seizing little inaccuracies running them. def getting worse ones soon, ride long enough expect it. ever spent time eastern portion state? hick redneck reputation definitely warranted. Protect queen!!!!! Exactly nice 2019 normal?

What wrong tad less clubbing, drinking, tad remote working? privacy, highly value.

An unfortunate side effect, effectively impossible confirm whether someone actually got vaccinated.

Small price pay privacy. allot testcenter already needed everything spring. worse covid, least average.  Kind dystopian. know studies link vaccination status driving skill. Feel free link some. 

(Non US health insurance premiums fixed % income) Two things infinite: universe human stupidity; I'm sure universe.

-Albert Einstein base triage social media history. you’ve spouting bunch nonsense God healthy body protecting you, send right back home pray workout. Plus crippled life like me. happening America. pandemic stupid spread accross earth. know rhetoric singular source data doctors scientists using?

Could also something personally observed?

Fauchi says trust doctors scientists. mean ones agree him? Hi! One friends anti-vaxer also believe covid much threat. approach this? I've largely avoided talking pandemic last year seeing coming up. think convince also keeps saying things rooted opinion, untrue consensus scientific view.   unfortunate truth. Unless regular people start taking precautions (getting vaccinated, masks, social distancing, avoiding indoor crowded places, etc), delta variant going run unvaccinated folks many southern states. surge Floirda Arkansas Louisiana followed Alabama Mississippi followed Georgia Tennessee etc. politicians abandoned jobs. citizens protect themselves. I've gone back full 2019 normal. people opt mask, go it, get weird looks me, I'm done feels great.

This we're going keep shut down. top that, conducted Pfizer preparing media booster shots. particular article goes nearly current studies vaccines delta variant. smells fishy. Also, pay scale. Yes seems pretty common covid. want brain fog forever. like able taste. Etc moron teaches kid. Sad face. don’t condone getting third shot, also isn’t works.

Like literally exactly same. gaslighting antivaxxers something like known true since vaccines created Pfizer modernas active ingredients literally want create thing one recipe create that. feel like I'm taking crazy pills point. safest vaccines ever created. Hospitals regularly beyond 100% capacity. Sure. talking testcenters specifically. Netherlands get vaccine get tested results tied social security number generate QR code. tests tied companies could test without need tied government system requires many safety rules features. Less bureaucracy, faster results. right here. 

a year ago everyone else masked gave wide berth. six feet, mostly least four feet.

Now person behind line brushes again. Tell always adopt orphans vaccinated adults who'll apparently drop dead months. I'd wager exposure get passing infected person grocery store nowhere near amount would get weeklong orgy. waiting get boosters. seeing many patients aren’t getting vaccinated. It’s nightmare.  Oh please. That’s like saying leftovers could saved starving person somewhere. 

Only, know, it’d never make went bad. clue you’re talking about. 

We’re throwing loads doses trash they’re expiring. people want third one get it. sublime! tough win war two fronts we're fight virus stupidity time. may unwinnable like says. idea quote here. 

They're middle comes state deaths per 100k. far. Insert Homer Simpson meme. 

All last year states getting rocked everyone used Florida Texas ""example do"". ""They mask mandates exploding"" blah blah blah. spreading like wild fire Florida governor fighting feds putting spot light. 

Florida middle pack vaccination rates. Schools starting week. really interesting see next weeks look like. north kids go back till September. I'm curious spreads schools. tons kids sick quarantine little billy sick sat next friends lunch? like watching science experiment play front eyes. Technically that’s considered mild case covid, blew mind. Cases aren’t coming intl travel BC Americans coming mostly vaccinated ones provide tests PLUS take tests track cases it’s something like 0.2% last update tested positive covid, please stop bullshit. Isntead it’s chucklefucks aren’t vaccinated Alberta visiting interior community spread low vaccinated areas. think voting age pegged 18 insulting current teenagers reap consequences climate change regressive taxation. least 16 seems reasonable, honestly 14 sound crazy me. That's age young high school freshman, necessarily make good decisions, they're plenty old enough understand issues they're voting point, supposed actual criteria. Certainly lots old people even meet standard. restaurants public spaces check this. get fine. someone check guests vaccinated tested expensive better earn money. remember TikTok series. Mass media actively suppressed talk potential risks, talked completely utterly safe. safe drinking water.

You can't surprised people lack capacity research, gobble idea risks giga vaxxing.  symptoms pretty universal too-- headache cold symptom work sends employee health. get tested got hayfever grass pollen. really works person honest asked screening questions then, anyone call health office enquire (working hospital). husband construction access rapid self tests anytime feel need them--however Magamentals trades mask appropriately spread virus eats car alone... FL's Rt dropping cases peaking soon. 

Im going week fun... Even though vaccines offer sterilizing immunity, it’s clear vaccinated individuals less likely become infected, contagious shorter periods time, less likely get reinfected. 

And course still offer good protection severe illness, hospitalization death.

Isn’t science awesome??? 
So lucky we’ve found way pandemic :) Florida open business, folks! 

Who would've guessed falsely telling people pandemic (or never existed first place) could've ended way. really shame author went extremely dishonest headline.


Author probably choose headline, usually editor that. Seems way. Far many deaths attributed Covid like far many adverse effects attributed vaccine. nothing informational provide keep moving boss.  took pointing supplements vitamins don’t FDA backing research. vaccine least studied used extensively- one knows fuck vitamin matter hell label says yet people take shit ton those. nowhere near overall hospitalization rates saw December-January, yet hospitalization children highest point. seems imply Delta worse children original variant was. fuck self centered throwing away unused vaccines constantly? 

If people want booster get one. CDC, again, dropped ball given guidance. also asking vaccine something wasn’t designed do. like r/askscience tons vaccines literally thrown away antivaxx counties. Blue Cross billed $16 per shot vaccinated (in TX) That’s awful. I’m sorry loss family rotten it. problem there's lot less general buy-in mitigation tactics last year. whatever protect *yourself*, still vulnerable covidiots abound. There's exception people. Variants almost universally contagious LESS lethal. never runny nose. may never herd immunity.

If thats way guess mostly manage silly pretend inconsequential. lot people around world die lot resources spent would otherwise be. Indeed - Reddit hive misinformation pretty much washes hands real
Moderation. Exactly. what's problem? Nobody ever said completely eliminated. endemic. Vaccinated people catch it, risk severe illness greatly reduced, risk infecting others seriously reduced well.  Agreed. I've gone back full 2019 normal. people opt mask, go it, get weird looks me, I'm done feels great.  Congratulations pregnancy! Yup, sure will.

I behind car morning hand written sign said; ""Forced penetration without consent tyranny."" also picture syringe circle around line going it.

These people freakin' dumb they're EVERYWHERE seems. UAB _lots_ heart surgery. capacity starts getting degraded point stops pipeline, going real bad lot people. No? even close. 

Breakthrough cases common enough youll see social media uncommon enough vaccinated people wont catch covid short term (hard tell long term keeps going around - odds youll eventually catch 10 years sticks around) silly. boosters coming? husband attended indoor celebration (100s people) company later led dozen cases fully vaccinated. didn’t get (along 100s others also vaccinated). better approach get people vaccinated. I’m flight Florida right now… guess we’ll find effective vax I've frequenting sub since March 2020. great source information anxiety. 

My question you: one you? Informative anxiety inducing? leaning toward latter recently, I'm wondering need break.  tread it. really want 11.5 year old I'm really concerned getting caught like that. think found info? wish would start counting reporting time passed since vaccination discussing breakthrough cases. seems like pretty important bit provide full context. Breakthrough counts may increasing, much related long since got shot? it? None it? Somewhere between? really care ""essential"" place like groceries doctor's office. 

But that, unvaxxed people really danger disease, vaccinated people's fault unvaxxed get sick going crowded nonessential place.  People caught covid anti bodies fight future infection. people (assuming here) got sick NY last year FL. 

Im saying vaccination rate reason, 1 reasons. Lots little factors adding lower rates NY FL. 8% people NY full vaccinated - might sound like huge number factors 1.1 million people. reason always stories people dying people recovering. 

There probably ton vaccinated people exposed didn’t breakthrough infection, wouldn’t make interesting story. Plus, good chance vaccinated people probably don’t even know exposed aren’t sick show symptoms, go day. !remindme 16 months texans fucking stupid re-elected idiot? That's one way unify people support government, force force little money /s breakthrough cases supposed 1 1000? Seems like lot celebrities getting lately. It’s one first studies I’ve seen come data reinfections unvaccinated v vaccinated. Infection spread COVID huge concern right now, important info. CDC website gives info straight. I'd walk says there. told wanted Moderna. asked first shot said yes. isn’t illegal get additional dose, I’m sure everyone convinced authorities going drop hammer. pharmacies happy vaxxing, odds 80/20 aren’t causing new vial opened, anything reduces spread demand hospital resources good thing.

I gave real name &amp; birthdate digital vaccination record state shows three covid shots. told uninsured billed state. There's practical way require masks unvaccinated people.  Morons still unvaccinated wear masks either, given opportunity. Thank sharing. amazes emphasis many people kids NEED socialize; give thought children experience classmate favorite teacher dies. That's memory happened all. Failing comply instructions flight crew never okay, whether ground delaying flight 100's people air. refused stand up, physically resisted TSA agents attempted lift seat. escalated there, never gotten point. was, justification was, important believed bearing person openly defies rules get treated. flu kills lots people ever year. hoping avoid that. absolutely inevitable wouldnt herd immunity.

Im sure people pretending big deal. Im talking specifically sometimes feels like people treating coronavirus news like team sport. ages consensus vaccines unbeatable variant efficacy impact variants would shortly herd immunity. doubt many acting inevitable never suggested would otherwise.

Again talking reminds narcissists prayer did, was, that's big deal.

and That’s okay. won’t fly them! looked local free newspaper, front page 6 ads local fundraiser gatherings. Maybe ad describing hospital capabilities, make people think attend events unvaccinated. CDC really disappointed handling pandemic. WHO. need clear messaging. Israel seems leading way pandemic. started boosters vulnerable population based studies. CDC still thinking next.

I personally know two breakthrough infections. It’s worrying. weren’t Novavax clinical trial, would go get third dose Pfizer Moderna. Instead, called clinical site told enroll n future booster trials Novavax.   patents need eliminated always thought message proof working...not immunity ""stronger"". reality, people get real response except maybe sore arm. Due way reporting works, there's dip every Sat-Mon.

You see repeat every week chart, pattern obvious. 

This chart ends 8/9, Monday, course ends dip. might threat others since still transmit vaxxed. doesn’t mean won’t ever threat again. People still dying. changed adblockers. Thanks. Moderna likely effective Pfizer - sweet! I’m glad got moderna. Even better supposedly baby born antibodies! I'm saying supposedly remember reading post woman said given birth vaccinated baby found antibodies end Internet trust blindly doses distributed demand/usage, nothing reduce wastage.

The doses currently throwing away probably tagged distribution months ago near peak vaccinations.

Not really sure one assume kicking waste curb. Especially next batch orders likely able taken 5-12 year olds. Maybe US, Europe verify. also agreement vaccine passport. basically whenever someone vaccinated wants go something like concert, flight, zoo, etc, pay test get in. Even better supposedly baby born antibodies! I'm saying supposedly remember reading post woman said given birth vaccinated baby found antibodies end Internet trust blindly Natural immunity? vaccine rate isnt much lower NY. florida cases doesnt make sense me. Yup. probably going disappointed plays out. ""antivaxxers"" producing variants. Vast swathes 3rd world vaccinated, probably never be.

Combine apparent unwillingness western governments proscribe travel countries fear called ist, continue see new exciting variants pop FOREVER.

As aside, herd immunity mean vaccinated. means X percentage population immune via vaccinations immunity acquired infection. denying recent science natural immunity pans covid? reading correctly? looks like comparing people covid 2020 newly vaccinated people. would completely ignore waning immunity issues. first school year Covid hit child learning constitution got good re-teaching constitutional rights America tell rights given individual person falls back states. States power would require something bigger Covid federal government step it’s power here. may seem disappointing, need remember giving power federal government worst case scenario US citizens. may seem easy Covid shit storm want federal power come take over, give power can’t take back. Biden president forever someone way scarier trump could elected soon 2024 need understand giving freedoms seems “safe” way go.

Amazing one ever protests these. give line bare minimum. masked distanced year (and continued getting vaccinated state lifted mask mandates). jumped line first thing group eligible shots zero hesitation. think unfair say part, I'm done. mask rules come back I'll follow them, I'm going go way live like disease meaningful threat honestly not. makes jerk it, spend years life living fear. florida much cases New york? masks school? vaccination rates close.. sort people know caught COVID year ago still can’t taste people recovered taste large margin. It’s potentially life long. trials children still underway, they’re studying different doses adults. data hasn’t submitted yet (Pfizer says Sept Oct age 5-11 cohort). FDA can’t approve application hasn’t submitted yet, parents wouldn’t children immunized without data showing it’s safe. International travel aside, usually pretty soft requirement since exemptions typically scrutinized much. Following precedent mandatory COVID vaccine probably really result many shots arms since people still unvaccinated would happy dig something up.

Does anyone stories someone know definitely exposed breakthrough?

I feel like we're likely hear former hear latter. relevance FDA still fully approving vaccines seem taking way long approve things time crisis, approval clearly desperately needed. variant specific boosters, heard Pfizer Moderna (not sure others) actually developing specific booster shots specific variants. believe even multiple articles/threads here. start developing soon variants concern identified, understanding. know whether would used standard third shot, believe exist least?

As far boosters immunocompromised vulnerable, primarily talking about. need booster data shows that, that's fine, data showing elderly people like Dad may waning immunity vaccines (a recent study suggested protection infection Pfizer vaccine may low 42%), yes, I'm seriously concerned keep reading breakthroughs stuff every day. mention immunocompromised people vaccines may effective first place.  understand it, data showing people need third shot, giving them? going wait start dying? understand, feel really frustrated worried whole situation. feels like we're way behind ball going wait something bad happens take action, frankly feels like we've whole time, clearly bad strategy failed us miserably time again. terrible analogy. One unlucky shot instantly dead scenario. covid, even unlucky get hit one 2-4 bullets, still unlikely permanently disabled killed.

With covid never completely empty revolver. Zero covid never goal. Except computer ones least can't spread firewall good enough stupid things...

Wait minute sounds familiar. read findings? shows moderate decrease vaccine efficacy Pfizer’s shot (42% infection) compared Moderna’s (76% infection). good publicity Pfizer. study done well known academic institution. conspiracy.

Edit: Even further, link pre-print. say Pfizer mean voted in, reap sow Agreed. Also EUA kids 12   global line. people world able get vaccinated. See hard India hit summer example. US throwing away doses also awful, idea ""we wasted some, let's waste more"" really want be. problem people afraid entire system goes back olden days big bad Adolf... choice, population gets separated even people interprete said times understand people, pretty much exactly that. sad people choose get vaccinated, see doubts. vaccines tested ones date, nobody certainly say anything long term side effects. Plus, many women afraid becoming infertile and/or good reasons get vaccinated. please: want get vaccinated, least inform PROPERLY topic keep mind actively work towards situation getting better, thank you.

The politicians acted absolutely terrible comes anything related topic well, another factor. Nobody believes anything anymore.

I already received shots starts feel like nothing besides burger menu free lol. 15,449 (an increase +280) currently hospitalized 3,112 (an increase 62) ICU August 11th 2021 according Florida Powerball example really hitting home, maybe is. odds winning powerball astronomically low, odds child serious complications Covid. I'd really like see study effects masking children day. way now. possible globally eradicate virus. India 37 doses per 100 people. That's billion unvaccinated people.

People choose get vaccinated better defense, get vaccinated deal that.

There's third option going away. felt misstep day one. still breastfeeding got vaccines January lied form said avoid situation could refused felt (and obviously still feel) right thing health. think week went got mine ACOG said ""most likely safe"" good enough me. 

None healthcare providers supported getting it?? seems bananas.  ever happened DRACO? Broad spectrum anti-viral? Yes please. Agreed. make skin crawl… literally…. sure specific data collected, states record keep vaccination records. vaccination providers supposed provide information state. accurate BinaxNow tests experience? went Vegas week ago slight shortness breath minor sore throat (which could also due GERD/anxiety). tested negative twice home tests. already tell, I'm kind paranoid, travel week want safe. What? 14k people died Sweden covid 1 mil cases? getting looked India yet. looked Sweden read post took surprise see true. making snarky joke flew totally head? so, apologize. bad that's case. Lupus patients shortages too. tragic comedy.   still see much surface transmission talk wish CDC would come stronger it. People still isolate packages sanitizer everything comes house. Wash fruits veggies should’ve pre covid! think covid broke lot peoples brains trauma anxiety conflicting reports it’s going take long time people heal that. Help!!

My brother law hospital. Covid spread thru lungs coma stable position

Here’s issue sister anti vax don’t believe covid real. sister even trying get hospital Bc thinks lying take home make feel better. I’m exhausted explain know it’s becoming nerve breaking cannot hold anymore unleash anger I’m trying keep composure. sister type believes everything heals naturally. think drinking water baking soda heal 

How would deal type without make believe covid real. I’m options. don’t believe doctors science way. 

Please help educate show ways explain real. FYI Turkey vacation originally live Belgium. wish wrong. There's much done either way. quarantine await PCR test. So, unsurprisingly, also liar. It’ll Memorial Day!

Never said year! well put. started first day pandemic spreading disinformation wonder people trust them. hate filter CDC recommendations decide real bullshit. thing May lifting mask recommendations. says 800,000 doses North Carolina alone get pitched. 

This understand outrage people going getting boosters, least ethical standpoint. like refrain going get another shot shipped away someone another country needs it. going go trash.... county fuck all. teacher son’s friend’s school tested positive, entire school still session son’s friend wasn’t sent home notifications emails sent out. don’t care anymore. True think age demographics different states publishing data quite different. could part it, though, yea. TY!  countries still patent protections removed? believe US changed stance recently. think means kids 12-18 says “over variety ages” seems thought process occurs people 100%, might well 0%. See also: seatbelts. commit felony get fired caught. Even Disney cruises look like they're good job. watched vlogger go first sailing Disney Dream like getting Fort Knox. 4 hour process proof vaccination, testing parking garage sitting get results, health screenings repeated tests discrepancies, masks indoors times, buffet style food, self serve drinks, ice cream, anything really, distancing public areas, course reduced capacity general, even Disney parks anymore. It’s leveling off. We’ll masked next two decades you’d like wait that. There’s natural end lockdowns, masks, bullshit that’s path want go.  one chimed yet, wanted thank work pulling together information sharing it. Got stack home.they handy.

Not big hassle daughter(20, fully vaccinated also...whole family is) party.
 
 Kids got tested school twice week anyway.

We bit paranoid since middle daughter positive house quarantine (only asympt.) managed contain (wife nurse once) feel similarly. Admittedly, largely unvaccinated toddler. lot stuff still easy do. mind wearing mask there's limited number people need stand close interact with. 

Totally opinion going forward... think going see vaccines limiting short term acute sickness also limiting long term damage well. Maybe entirely, enough allow risk live virus truly becomes endemic.

Regardless perspective, would say great time continue doing. 

Cheers you. Know alone. would definitely partly explain it. might need try calls. could easily change first rounds school closures bunch kids get sick happen. know lot people waited we're hesitant kids, getting vaccinated school starts. take word it. Last year DHL wrote study vaccine distribution logistics. tons articles written time, read full whitepaper Page 19:

""Currently, large parts Africa, South America Asia could readily supplied scale due lack cold-chain logistics capacity suitable life science products...Feasibility supplying substantial parts Africa remains low due high outside temperatures limited cold chain infrastructure.""  Good question. Nah. all. risks vaccinated people low even infection vaccinated people living normally especially infants. Children 1-10 years old extremely unlikely severe issues COVID even w Delta children 11 vaccinated. 

This crisis unvaxxed extended flu season rest us.  So, Lambda. Threat? next dominant strain coronavirus? predict Covid disappear election, 2100. far can't tell I'm pretty sure it'll thing past then.

Of course humans might point continue way are. hesitancy large part governments given mixed signals whether get vaccinated pregnancy. Back spring, neither CDC ACOG recommending US, though pregnant women *could* get wanted. Doctors often wouldn’t give recommendation didn’t enough data go time. Earlier studies also showed data women 3rd trimesters got women first trimester side effects fever concern fetal development (this specifically stated one study 30,000 women came May). Long story short - pregnant women urged get US weren’t always. got June without healthcare provider supporting decision. countries, wasn’t even available summer pregnant women. think countries (Germany? S. Korea?) may still available them. I’ve seen don’t remember where. 271 100,000 people death every 36 seconds considered pandemic

As 2019, US, value 200.8 per 100,000, 1 every 47 seconds.

For last 12 months COVID killed 1 person every 71 seconds. Kids getting used school shootings drills...anyone child school ever one school okay this. Yet they're selling guns, states making purchasing guns easier. kids going thru stress ever, making guns accessible seems like complete opposite needs done. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Glad kept kid Virtual year! good hear. shows governor may playing politics pandemic, least school superintendents actually care students. ...he's probably also sociopath. Supposedly covid19 jumped bats humans eating fucking them. US already purchased 200 million additional doses needed. wish would reduce capacity again. good old dear friend hydroxychloroquine.

You’ll groups people completely delusional argue strive zero COVID among kids; say that’s probably impossible, suddenly become person “doesn’t care” kids getting sick dying. 

I think addition outlined subgroup, there’s also element sanctimony moral pontification it. Many risk-averse advocates COVID restriction/reduction measures complex minds morally superior, compassionate, responsible ones. Anyone doesn’t advocate anti-COVID measures pathological extremes do, necessarily callous, reckless, almost sociopathic regard human life, apparently. Nothing cute coming fat Fox News watcher.

I feel like reason lot adults may prioritizing getting shot it’s mandatory job. two work maskless enviroment? Inconvenience isn’t thing LIFE, ***** don’t disagree unilaterally. initial argument opened “when stop blaming politicians start blaming people”. long politicians enacting policy goes public health, don’t think ever stop blaming politicians start blaming collective.

As aside, generally place people three groups comes mask policy: 1) always wear 2) wear required 3) never wear. plenty communities Florida could enact mask policies get second group wearing masks again. DeSantis outlaws local mask mandates, tangibly decreases mask usage, harms public health. it’s simple “those will, will, won’t, won’t”. 

The argument point is: blame people blindly follow rhetoric others, blame power knowingly take advantage ignorance? I’m inclined believe power held higher standards general public. can’t let public figures wiggle consequences abusing position shifting blame onto put position. opinion sort fact based argument.

* ICU entries: 9.13 per 1,000,000 unvaccinated, 0.76 per 1,000,000 vaccinated bet states start follow.  many deaths within 28 days flu would better mesure  ACOG guidance says COVID vaccination recommended pregnant women, consult unnecessary may original SARS? gave autoimmune issue?

I guess never hear original one since burned relatively quickly. Tokyo, let alone Japan, nowhere near 50% vaccinated. Terrible policy. ""and"", ""or"".

Yeah, tad deadlier flu. seen type masks kids wearing. Might well wearing window screen mask. mess. Absolute mess. Last year, hospitals running sedative used patient goes ventilator. guess hope pray drug companies ramped production stuff. hope kind mask mandate gets removed vaccinated exclusive places. always, 16 different solutions...

In Baden-Wurttemberg, beginning monday tests needed (if you´re fully vaccinated recovered), antigen rapid tests sufficient occasions, you´ll need PCR-test indoor cultural events clubs discotheques (according plans discussed now). Great way look it, thanks. heck wrong kids? Probably they're sick go hospital.  can't speak entire country, least live NE region that's case.

More point though small fragment population make estimate if/when peaking whole. catastrophic, nationwide peak happen 18-21 year olds partying school (although fair say fall we'll see pockets surges such), wave we're going right due delta quickly burning entire population un/under-vaccinated communities.

As per countries, delta tends move fast, makes sense say we're peak right now, close it. saw someone reporting Lambda variant showing Winter Haven, sources Reddit? think that's reference Aquaman. It’s safe effective. know dozen people past week got covid despite fully vaccinated Greed obviously powerful emotion selfishness.

Make daily dime. friend work called me. got back phish shows past weekend seven friends vaccinated Covid now. :( ain’t ending time soon. students. feeling, immediate future,we will. great thorough thread tweets, people reporting infected COVID multiple times? Reports less severe severe illness. Alberta 280 daily cases (6.4/100,000) pretty comparable BC 395 daily cases (7.9 per 100,000).

You allowed disconnect one thinks happen vs one thinks might happen. Oh feel shame. Good. Exactly. See - figures lot higher. Vancouver Victoria hitting 90%+ population fully vaccinated, even Delta going run brick wall quickly.   think problem motivate people wait reward offer future public health issues. That's concern. care get money, ability family gatherings without worrying worth much money. I've worked COVID workplace program since.. well start COVID.

I'd say we're least 8-12 months away turning endemic (sustained spread low stable levels population), depends lot variables (vaccination rates, mask mandate compliance, vaccine mandates, potential new variants, amount immunity population, amount reduction protection symptomatic infections vaccinated individuals time).

Good. kid going school mask regardless Abbott thinks. going go light walk tomorrow evening friend, would ok? second jab 1.30pm. haven’t skipped hard work inconvenience though. 

For 16 months stayed in, social distanced, wore masks, see family friends, social events, birthdays holidays spent alone .. could go on. 

Then came vaccines majority people participated in, that’s told us remove mask ease restrictions listened. 

So saw people bars good time, shouldn’t knock it. want part crowd vaccinated anyways? 

This beyond me, stage condemn people right thing along wanted go bar. can't always hide truth hear you. Wearing mask gym burden. 

I’ve vaccinated months. liberties vaccinated compromised luddites. Let get sick - know risks. critique approach would penalize poor unvaccinated people. People afford pay tests going affected.

What I'd say nice dude above's first part totally true, risks either way think risk adverse effect vaccine pennies compared risk getting sick, yourself, also transmitting family, friends, neighbors.

I mean people maybe that's everyone's experience. There's still travel ban place US keeping families loved ones apart going year half now, lot jobs still WFH (which fine nice big home family, great live small apartment want keep work/home separated), lot events used person still virtual, Zoom meetings normalized knows cat's ever going back bag (again, Zoom meetings great established career, someone starting building professional network, etc, sure personal work connections make Zoom nowhere near strong ones made in-person lunch meeting), etc...

tell me, highvlevel vaccination end goal, is? masking forever?

If even 100% vaccinated place (a vax exclusive place example) ypu still want mask social distance, might well root restrictions forever.  won´t (now). Main reason: ""promised"" (""There mandatory vaccination covid""), elections \~ 6 weeks...

I dont know suddenly people acting vaccines super unreliable nearly useless masks kind super shield. europe places requiring vaccines *also* removed masks places seeing soaring cases anything result.

Vaccines work, pro-mask craze undermines general trust vaccines US, apparently big vaccine hesitancy problem already. Gay bars Chicago requiring proof vaccinations now.

Either make policy get vaccinated make unvaccinated students pay regular COVID testing. Wearing mask way add difficulty gym experience limiting oxygen intake. Athletes added measure altitude training decades. 

It definition burden. 

Covid last forever - wear masks forever? Lots festive lights, living rooms colorful trees near window, malls packed, Christmas music every store, families enjoying time together, different colored cups Starbucks probably. hope state starts same. Starting back Georgia valid medical reason. immunosuppressed patients can't get certain times needing time vaccine relation treatment. mean can't get it, need time give best chance response. 

If severe allergy component one vaccines, get different one. agree remember people physician physician public good function.

It kind already is.  see letting children potentially lose 2 years primary school education equitable trade even conditions perfect, especially simultaneously worth cost shut bars restaurants prevent transmission. Thank least admitting know yet, impossible know.

What think fair percentage chance negative long term effects Covid 19 vaccine future? chance recover Covid 19 otherwise healthy? 99.7%. unless reason get vaccine, chance recovery lower, reasonable believe chance side effects vaccines opt vaccine.

Want point election (via people)? (and 'over 50%').. still elected. PEOPLE FLORIDA ELECTED THIS.
These people likely anti-mask, anti-vax, definitely covid safety precautions... thus, Florida.

To blame governor ignorant. popularity contest end day.. mainly trying ensure time office. 

THE PEOPLE responsible, election Florida, whole, handling pandemic.

So maybe remove head ground, shovel 'bullshit' there. darkest timeline Ask coworker feel natural immunity. people much comfortable risk getting horrible flu getting jabbed. Bonus points argument they're 55, overweight, health problems. Maybe Trump DeSantis secretly hated Republicans along? working Manhattan height pandemic work two hospitals, sound ambulances sirens nonstop like month, scary time. Dead kids chance catch up. Live kids do. Desantis wants govern pile bones. R0  states publishing similar data? 

and aside that, going randomly pick two arbitrary weeks try prove case one way other, that's dangerous since link baked delays reporting Jesus would like “Sorry, Dad made smart enough develop vaccines. I’ll see downstairs.” hasn’t. Moderna Pfizer recommending based data. parents said took grandma hospital day walked right in, questions asked, one door asking people mask. expected explained article. Deaths lagging indicator. reported 146 new deaths within 28 days positive COVID-19 test Tuesday, highest daily total since March 12, **as impact last month’s surge cases fed fatalities**, government data number new cases reported Tuesday fell 23,510 25,161 Monday - less half peak 54,674 recorded July 17, shortly social distancing measures removed England. Observational study only. There's placebo controlled trial planned 155 patients upcoming completed end year. describing vengeance imposing people. People rights, forcing people take something body violent act.

Should people get vaccinated? Yes. put others greater risk don't? Absolutely. give someone else right force something want to? Maybe, maybe not. force though. enforces violence? state. 

When talk rights often framed individual freedoms. right will, long cause harm another person. vaccinations gets muddier. we're talking action small effect within larger collective toward reducing harm. obligate person toward act? come harsh penalty imprisonment don't? latter, really think does, go road opening people personal imprisonment collective action. imprison white people harm allow happen POC? imprison gun manufacturers debatable nebulous impact others? decides causes kind indirect harm? happens society lock up.

You're talking locking largest number people ever imprisoned history world. That's stupid. might well end society.

I'm vaccinated way.  Oye. Good luck there. Keep safe, fear we're going rough ride school going everywhere. Here's simpler graphic explains news LEAST 1 million people gotten boosters I'm left wondering much counted ""new"" first doses.... Generally speaking, nurses NPs trained critically analyze new medical scientific information, stratify risk, etc. Yes, unfortunately, guidance US always lags. (look mask debacle last spring) Looks like choice either get 3rd shot, increased protection, peace mind comes it.

VS constant worry small chance. grandma gets seriously sick.

I'd know one I'd pick, probably get 3rd one Granny Probably bad I'd love see optimal time booster is. may people wait @5 months getting booster maybe sooner better. seen studies time frame gives protection. wish I'd waiting longer first second shot followed schedule trials. I'm hoping info timing third. anyone seen data someone long-COVID affects chances future infections? know there's research suggesting people already covid +vaccine less likely get infected vs someone vaccine, seen data protection active long-COVID 'infection' may provide. entirety problem. 100% right 

NY flying blind, FL refuses see really calling 3+ week old post?

We likely see boosters elderly immuno compromised weeks. everyone wants go Bonnaroo. incredibly insightful, unbiased post that's based logic &amp; data. really appreciate putting together. Big thank concerned parent! That's incredibly naïve statement. I’m first time teacher summer. lockdown drill never trained it. kids well-versed showed do. It’s still interventional - drug given patient; it’s randomized. Sounds like he's reading ""95% efficacy"" ""95% chance get virus"".

Sadly feels like spell absolutely everything order people understand, problem people like read headlines. happens. fairly certain data vaccinated people going hospital screwed.. would wager big part anti Vaxer would lie say vaccinated, probably embarrassed admitted hospital, using resources didn’t need to.. circumstance think fully vaccinated person lying saying vaccinated. would pissed fully vaccinated would still admitted hospital… also data seems completely based honor system would way fact checked someone lie.. think part reason seeing uptick vaccinated people hospitalized, pressure applied government even hardcore republican governors, clamoring citizens take vaccine got Moderna shots February/March wife got Pfizer shots May/June. *Both us* tested positive week.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone wants pretend covid skip hard work inconvenience.

We keep learning lesson vaccinated and/or get covid. Excerpts: Experts say California’s better-than-average vaccination rates newly implemented mandatory mask policies parts state helped prevent grim governors Florida, Texas states opposed allowing local governments mandate wearing masks, California allowed counties enact orders indoor public spaces everyone age 2 older, regardless vaccination . Data around world county repeatedly shown masking valuable layer protection transmission respiratory viruses,” Ferrer . biggest reason optimism California’s relatively robust level vaccine coverage. According latest CDC figures, 77.5% eligible Californians — least 12 years old — already gotten least one dose, 63% considered fully Florida, roughly 69% similarly aged residents least partially vaccinated, 57% completed inoculation series. comparable rates Texas 64.3% 53.7%, respectively, federal figures show.  Seriously, step away sub go outside youll never know covid exists. thats perfectly okay vaccinated person if/how relates law not. governorxs vaccinate mandate already goes past law, thought. hospitals systems already saying care requiring vaccine anyway (with testing exemption).

But law dumb. ONE place want employees spread infection place decided prevent that? orange person love certain leader country starts R. got fully vaccinated April (Pfizer)

Do think would need another shot effects vaccine wear down? Red good? Also cannot emphasize importance Vitamin more. several studies looking Covid infections Vitamin levels. People levels 40 ng/ml significantly less likely get infections. levels 50 ng/ml almost getting infected all. people levels 20 ng/ml bad outcomes.  

I've supplementing year levels 50 ng/ml. gotten infected even spending week Florida (couldn't avoid travel, vacation).  J&amp;J job involves regular exposure people cannot work home. “Against expert advice”? Pfizer came right said people need boosters. countries. US said risk need too, hasn’t passed around red tape yet. Schools called bluff mandated masks. pulls school funding, sue state property taxes back. pay taxes meant school funds going allocated back. half half last heard you’re vaccinated, leave thread, it’s like 2019 masks low risk catching COVID. 

I come back see what’s going stay updated otherwise...there’s big beautiful world outside sub Israeli data smells like bullshit evey day. 

Delete account. idea reading I’ve said. course need high vaccination rates, spread drop spread decreases need sort distancing masking. appreciate willingness listen differing opinions staying kind.

I've seeing lot people internet bullying, discriminating even calling violence unvaccinated. right continue report comments, however seems moderators care happily leave threats long agree it.

This increased polarisation makes concerned. hope continue listen kind other. probably don’t want spook economy. need people back work need sell public it’s safe. It’s coincidence US agencies news organizations lagging weeks even keeping new developments; hurts narrative. Pfizer companies stopping production October though. They're continue create increased production every plant pretty regularly. vaccinate everyone boosters. recommendation likely hit 6 8 month whatever month deem get it. Plus go pharmacy doctor's office like flu shot. Hey! Yes wife second dose July 31st. didn’t side effects first soreness injection site wife. Second dose pretty much tiny bit sluggish half day still helped brother law move house house. wife hand second dose sweats night body sore following day nothing crazy passed end day. missing like key step. 


You assuming getting virus inevitable. 




I’m saying got Moderna there’s higher chance getting covid wouldn’t even position. 




How know true? 



Again it’s statistics probability 



Moderna far shown effective delta variant. rather small bump new cases.

About that. 3,800 today. Meanwhile, Quebec government said won’t putting school mask mandate place. Oh don’t yell sing, droplets won’t go far. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Please use phrase ""Trump mounted"". realize ways positively interpret words, took disturbing place 15 humans left NYSE floor  never forget sirens April early May. Multiple sirens per minute sitting small apartment. Absolutely horrifying experience. need adaptable. Unfortunately delta situation changed compared month two ago. That’s sad fact. I’m happy either. 

The reasonable solution masking, social distancing (though necessarily strict pre-vaccine days, especially vaccinated), continued push vaccination Delta’s spread check, likely won’t long. think indicates “forever”? Spring ISD, 20 miles north downtown Houston. two elementary aged kids started school today, almost everyone masked up. dropped parked around corner cry, got email superintendent morning saying mandating masks district-wide starting Monday. 

So cried tears (somewhat) relief. fucking terrified right now. 4x higher week. heartbreaking. :( We’re going get Covid, vax ensure survive it. man banned ventilators yet? would need booster thing? going magically prevent disease 3rd time around.

Most vaccines given multiple shots multiple months. stop giving boosters effectiveness gets high enough level think another booster worth it. instance, [HPV countries two doses others three doses marginal whether third dose worth trouble different countries made different decisions.

My layman's understanding intuition behind multiple space doses vaccines initial dose primes immune system look virus follow-up doses tell immune system virus ongoing threat, needs continue ready fight off. gap doses short, register separate instance immune system. gap long, immune system entirely forgotten first instance. third dose, especially initial dose spacing short, signal immune system keep lookout virus long term.

Mind, Israel limiting third doses people expect extra high risk. think needed people. CA to. don’t access state registry long don’t go pharmacy shows you’ve 2, get third, technically. Yeah, said mutates worse version (and it'll probably country poor vaccination rates, like before) might change quickly.

We've kinda lucky far, Delta variant lowered vaccine protection still decent good rates hospitalization death.

Next time might lucky. arguments me. Aunt quite right, suspect.  hear ya. 2 medical procedures coming can't go untreated. Vaccinated praying too. us. safe great post. think parents know never protect children COVID 100%, like risks make sure use life jacket boat, seatbelt car, helmet bikes. 

Its mind numbing think (regardless mandate not) something simple cloth mask help lower school transmission interim child vaccinated even 'thing'. Exactly. People missing point. protection dentist wear? dentists live wear masks, shields, gowns gloves feel pretty safe going there.  belabor point, know Moderna would protected better J&amp;J did? 

If high enough viral load, likely breach vaccine take. vaccine protect severe illness/hospitalization death.

If Moderna/Pfizer much better J&amp;J, seen breakthrough infections them. However, see much see J&amp;J.

Consider UK, least half less efficacious AZ/Oxford vaccine - yet lower cases/hospitalizations/deaths vs US variant?  AZ/J&amp;J vaccines inferior, would possible? failing provide actual data, substance, little context

Is 3k+ daily cases good data? think universi systems vaccinated individuals go class without wear masks. Israel extreme outlier vaccine efficacy studies I'm starting think kind major structural flaw research. 

And theyre 3k+ daily cases.

Maybe trust scientists next time. R0 known R Factor. higher R factor, transmissable virus is, faster spreads. R0 initial covid outbreak spring 2020 estimated 2.3-2.7. person gets covid would spread 2 people, 2 would spread 2 people total 4, etc.

The R0 delta variant currently estimated somewhere 5 8. Therefore get spread 5 people, 5 spread 5 total 25, etc. spreads way easily.

For comparison, known virus highest R0 measles (super contagious R0 12-18).  I've got fully vaxxed 15 year old two 10 unprotected. I'd 6 3 year old pharmacy tomorrow would let me. Hey, careful, woman child. swear every semi-public Facebook thread covid vaccine ends dozen people posting distant relative, cousin's husband wife's uncle whoever, died right getting covid vaccine, also know one gotten seriously sick covid. like clockwork.

There's tiny risk serious reaction even death vaccine, seems unlikely relatives die ***because of*** vaccine. Thanks friend. son 10 weeks old it’s stressful leaving house sometimes. wife vaccinated third trimester she’s still breastfeeding exclusively we’re everything him. I'm curious deaths counted figures apprioriate stage UK... are, I'm mistaken, ""death within 28 days positive covid test"" figure.

What I've personally wondered appropriate metric dealing much smaller fatality numbers (eg especially back 10's 20's) yet relatively high case load. high death numbers barely noise, low figures becomes much significant.

Say example given time wave 1.5% population Covid (I believe figure UK last month one 75 people currently infected example). go basis UK circa 1500 deaths per day reasons, stands reason 22 daily deaths would tested positive given day law averages (ignoring infections demographic simplicity) even COVID nothing passing.... extend time period 28 days (ie percentage population either has, COVID last 28) captures proportionally larger percentage too.

As say dealing higher death figures makes sense easy, fast hopefully reduces chance undercounting. transition expected much lower death rate disease though would logical shift towards cause based death metric? example started counting deaths within 28 days positive rhinovirus test, would inevitably conclude many, many people dying common colds every winter. Everyone healthy enough required, teachers ffs would get internet little bit- Covid ripping right sub become echo chamber risk averse. 

Things aren’t great right regardless delta, situation overall improved USA dramatically. exit wave we’re experiencing right inevitable(with delta without). Covid spread uncontrollably runs naive hosts. Sadly people letting propaganda/misinformation convince vaccination. Almost people contract covid quite die. happens covid become secondary concern people. Delta accelerated process we’re gonna see happen short period. Things look scary it’ll soon. want lose sponsorship deals. I’m sure south worse these. Per article, “Scientists found 99% pregnant women admitted hospital Covid-19 unvaccinated, Delta variant posing greater risk severe disease.” Get vaccine already please. wonder approval ratings currently? church days. fucking liquor stores close NINE lol. dumb Unequivocally D. tried it? subs fear fake vaccine cards strange. Nothing foolproof. People fake ids drink. People counterfeit money. People fake college transcripts. Nothing foolproof, requiring proof still great thing. We've already lost year half COVID. get lose next years stupidity. Basically 8-9/10 cases South’s school calendars also shifted even earlier, three weeks, last 20 years. Southern states beach towns effectively lobby earlier start beach rental season. 

“Fall break” carved another bonus beach weeks (if stagger districts), every years you’ll catch coastal districts pushing nonsense along lines second fall break something. got nothing title. can’t even guess. headline Florida’d brain. Especially sitting members Congress. them, maybe especially them. least also them. also sound great, yes. holding newborn hands whole thing popped crazy looking back lucky done everything hospitalwise lockdown.  

Hoping everything goes smoothly you. US passes 100K cases. well played, hope FB dies lifetime HISD also mandating masks. Maybe Florida finally peaking. Weren’t daily case figures well 20k last weak? schools..... Absence evidence evidence absence dude. like logic 101, come Right Dallas Ft. Worth probably staff open beds. person saying move patients hospital beds staff are. New 1994: Cruz Cramer, hilarious sitcom wacky law office crazy clients. Raphael ""ted"" Cruz seat pants trial lawyer never met plea bargain like. Straitlaced Kevin Cramer, lovable clueless straight man always cleaning problems caused wacky partner. Rated TV14, may contain material many parents would find unsuitable children 14 years age. Amd sent people checks? We're already seeing 10% inflation...likely years come. ask govern us. Well that's fucking rich.  Abbott getting bailed stupidity. closing islands tourists would cause lots people lose jobs unemployment extensions ending September. good hear employer least trying encourage vaccinations. I've seen many business denounce masks restrictions, post nice change pace. Mission accomplished? frustrating since way. wish unvaccinated die empathy waning rapidly. Nearly hospitalized unvaccinated. poor nurses... Well, no, they're EXACT RNA sequence. literally ... ! 


When RNA sequences two main contenders published alongside CureVac sequence, comparisons showed 1274 codon positions, 808 identical across 3 vaccines. 103 unique Moderna, 249 unique Pfizer-Biontech, 230 unique CureVac. could sworn heard (or read) Lambda already fading areas, can't compete contagious Delta is. Thank try tax code. You’re absolutely sure didn’t violate tax code interpretive guidance?

Absolutely, since S-0 W-2 get refund every year. time file 1040EZ student loans claim interest also EIC time. tax forms actually pretty simple care maximize refund. government gets extra bucks I'm ok that.

But carry assumption know me, sort funny. took Moderna days formulate current vaccine receiving genetic code original virus. weeks fabricate first batch vaccine lab tests.

The bottleneck rollout new vaccine versions regulatory, scientific technical. people focusing hospitalizations point. “learn live this” whole concept hospitals run need time change. 

One 2 things happen. Either government keeps reimbursing hospitals COVID care (socialized medicine!) insurance companies start requiring vaccines ramping premiums refuse. 

With lack empathy antivaxxers have, way appears change get inevitably hit pocket books. start happening FDA approval. example, Germany still requires testing don’t vaccine, aren’t paying anymore. talking mild infections winter talking severe infections among vaccinated, two different issues.

Almost evidence dangers long-term effects unvaccinated, breakthrough cases. want good answer, suggest posting r/COVID19 daily thread. We'll learn something. they're vaxxed up, world, pandemic over.

Yes, part 100% correct. Sounds well organized! would guess teachers 90% well. Im optimistically thinking spreadable delta variant is, last one completely tear thru country. Cause unvaccinated come contact unless leave bunker. even reports Pfizer's effectiveness inspiring confidence preventing vaccinated people getting (they safer think large amounts still end getting it). tears thru everyone, period immunity hopefully gives us time figure permanently combat future variants Agree CI's wide. Mayo multiple locations, including Florida, also geography play. fairly robust N, though. Personally, think big picture takeaway seeing degradation protection, particularly immunity standpoint, across board. Likely moreso Pfizer Moderna. protection severe disease/death remains pretty decent. Couple issues:

1. risk variants far larger outside US/Texas inside it. We've got like 5B people living places vaccinations. 330M 60% vaccination rate much less factor.

2. really discussing time variants get spun off. hit herd immunity one way another, going seeing anti-vaxxers getting infected. (With big wave, get now. controlled it, they'd getting next 18 months) thing decreases chances dangerous variant produced vaccinations. delta gotten lot people vaccinated. actually exists argument giant waves result fewer variants. probably pre-delta, it? reason going keep rolling USA eligible idiots getting vaccinated. people like me, right thing throughout got vaccinated first opportunity. 

There simple solution here. People need get vaccinated. That's road this, social restrictions country, especially parts country currently rocked Delta, take seriously anyway (and know d-mn well I'm right that, unfortunate is). According [moderna's data Beta boosters, page benefit new vaccines might pretty marginal - benefit 6-month booster truly massive. deeper problems that. Small sample size single state, small time frame, apparently self reported testing. Versus testing regular intervals.

They point last one out. Admitting vaccinated may less likely get tested all. people want show vaccinations required immunity, that's they'll see. Even study seems deep flaws, may actually show that. hoping larger number deaths?  joke. Everyone Texas outside Austin hates Austin.  misinterpreting graph. 'day infection', many people infected today appear (for today's date) next week two, \*always\* see dip end.

The way I've used graph discarding last week :) No, they'll need to, especially Delta. We're probably going need even precautions one. Maybe case, ""Dumbkopf"" tax? Holy crap, never thought way.  Given perfect COVID exposure, would like 150-200 test positive 1000, many symptoms all. However, there's lot nuance numbers since test lot. likely picking &lt;10% daily infections US point means COVID infecting 1 million people per day. need it. come conspiracy Obama/Clinton/Biden/etc hiding public. vaccines prevent 20% infection current surge infect 50% unvaccinated, we'd expect 10% vaccinated infected also.  (Testing rates may among vaccinated unvaccinated, though. particular celebrities might tested regularly sports movie filming etc.) That’s interesting. I’m Canada show health card get service, I’m pretty sure they’d able see already two doses tried get booster. study mentioned emergence new variants (aka Delta) suspected played part significantly natural immunity waning. rest world even opportunity first shot, lets alone third? lets get ""we both"" argument. Surely agree can, would far quicker give supply countries. interesting moral dilemma. lot people altruistic comes expense.

BTW arguing against, pointing interesting conundrum. Tests protect person tested, protects everyone else around Well yeah, haven’t said 99.99% Vaccinated people breakthrough cases. immune systems able fight new variant effectively minimizes effects. problem everyone getting vaccinated, we’re allowing thing constantly mutate stronger resilient, eventually vaccines longer viable we’re back square one. 

I’m tired pandemic. month ago every asshole saying covid look state things again. is: end first semester, outcomes Providence students attended school person far ideal: 22 percent in-person learners least one incomplete class. number even worse virtual learners, 37 percent least one incomplete. 

You read rest story I'll warn you, brutal. However give kids best chance normalcy falling behind. weight world rest administration teachers benefit kids. Yeah bunch past. know allll crowds haha NBC 1 900:  normal antibodies fade time memory cells remain provide long term protection? antibodies fade one catches Covid, cells kick point albeit bit slower antibodies still present, i.e. get ""infected"" still quite protected. googling covid cases, case counts yesterday get revised 235k 178k? longer filter Florida? Data glitch? guy? I've seen name sub. it? Go back actually look study. Particularly size study, admitted limitations. go way state can't used prove causation, due limitations.  I'd guess right simply due high number serious cases, data that? lot people post-viral ME/CFS covid, they've largely ignored (or gaslit) patient population. Covid bad, possible we're waking bad viruses terms causing chronic illness.   That's love ""I'm vaccinated I'm never going wear mask live life"" crowd. Good luck. Right, local targeted closures seem make sense contain something. answer question, attitude measles vaccine’s debut 1963, many considered measles, still killed 500 Americans year hospitalized 48,000, inevitable childhood disease everyone suffer “Measles common disease mortality comparatively low,” says Graham Mooney, associate professor Johns Hopkins Institute History Medicine. “People problems vaccine nobody closed schools measles virtually everyone got anyways.

So need get Covid vaccine safely work kids. we're going school-close way problem. Maybe? agree evidence, may circumstantial. I'm looking positive test rate [this 1-in-5 tests positive, picture virus murky. know number actual cases much reported, know exactly much.

As for-instance saw Florida DeSantis shut testing centers method suppress number cases reported. take malicious fuckery reduce reported numbers without reducing community presence though. 

I hope slowing down, appreciate want see direct evidence happening. delta turn epsilon delta vaccine won’t work well on

What's basis concluding this? Epsilon already exists shown strong ability outcompete delta. current vaccines continue work well may require boosters eventually certain demographics current formulations. long term effects???

NO STUDIES DONE YET!!!

I'll chance COVID 10 years making decision!! right course viral mutations way looking way quickly, relative forms natural selection, change adapt. essentially mechanism evolutionary advantage, breakneck pace virus. ""Overall, 246 case-patients met eligibility requirements successfully matched age, sex, date initial infection 492 controls.""

""Finally, retrospective study design using data single state 2-month period; therefore, findings cannot used infer causation. Additional prospective studies larger populations warranted support findings.""

Serious question, many people reading headlines like this, actually click study, come conclusions? attribute well crafted lie; false sense security. Unrelated, want point also survived three-day attack graboids.

Broke wrong rec room. Corona-marketing. First masks. medical masks. ffp2 masks. back normal masks (leftover previous cycle). 
Now test pay. zero problem staying home. Bring  far understand mRNA vaccines actually produce immune response attack specific part virus allowing give severe symptoms. hear anti vaxxers claim vaccine all, technically definition create immune response body source statement ? 

That’s pretty strong statement I’ve seen anywhere else software service ceo? Ok.... time say certainty whether burns out, sticks around.

""Florida seems nice, might retire here."" -delta  sort counterintuitive. Wouldn’t immune system get better “read” whole virus one protein? Residents bringing in.

I'm Israeli. wrote guess. crowded, badly ventilated schools (&amp; crowded buildings people spend hours per day w/ strangers)? course orgies sense know I'd imagine viral purposes different. school, office, &amp; cinema buildings nationwide upgraded take airborne spread account 1+ year closed?

\-stupid people, probably type coverage frustrating. No, clusters among vaccinated aren’t killing anything. unvaccinated are, though. 

All headline discourage vaccination create unnecessary anxiety joking? 18 months pandemic, cannot recognize acknowledge covid higher morbidity mortality rate common cold?

We talking neurological complications goober. Please stop making stuff up.

It's like talking brick wall here. caveat - Covid awful, worse flu, needs everyone vaxed, still need therapeutics across globe, we're going need boosters, everyone needs mask up.

Aside protection severe illness hospitalization see point getting “if vaccine kill virus vaccinated people still get spread it, whats point? It’s still going spread vaccinated not.”

Feel like I’m talking brick wall. annoying. Aka ""I'm still potentially spreading shit, I'm unlikely die screw everyone else"" What's frustrating types, even present nonsense argument ""if saves even one life"", something like, logic changes completely.

It's perfect storm mass hysteria, fueled click hungry media, social media amplifying it. extremely tiring.

I keep seeing ridiculous doomsday type articles posts, go look raw data, turns total BS.

The number children dying covid eclipsed people randomly murdering them, accidents. news pushing narrative they're dropping like flies. Yeah it’s like spontaneously generates households like oh, didn’t come outside… Disgusting.

Delta supports delta. think calculation fanbase would rabid rate they're dying.

Plus, would mostly lower income, African American / hispanics, city folks would dying. L’chaim! experience here, plus decently high fever. Worth it! women speak doctors getting vaccine Well mean don’t recommend shots yet haven’t approved it’s entirely wrong True. stuff back inside Thanksgiving Christmas. December January worse summer. another redditor, no, general impression lot reading listening. impression realistic expectation achieving sterilising immunity, indeed - even pre-Delta levels efficacy. However, think expressed poorly - obviously \*a\* goal must prevent infection far possible, primary goal expected achievable. See relatively early assessment; studies vaccinated primates showed reductions pathology, symptoms, viral load lower respiratory tract,6, 7 failed elicit sterilising immunity upper airways. Sterilising immunity upper airways claimed one vaccine, peer-reviewed publication data awaited.8 reports virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 re-infection previously infected individuals, extent re-infection unclear.9 Whether re-infection associated secondary spread unknown. I'm still hesitant I've never scared vaccines. vax's know I'm hesitant guess fear unknown, could also happen getting covid. hardly go always wear mask. anyone give advice put ease anxiety getting shot? personally think hedging bets national name recognition run losses later. negative press still name everyones mouth. Even FL shit bad, ""only"" 1 5 tests come back positive still well protected. we're 'Merica, we're number one! /s wish could argue you. 👆👆👆👆 help avoid serious complications hospitalizations long-term health problems herd immunity via vaccines, many people want vaccines mandated masking effect realized. Natural immunity leaves hospitals medical system vulnerable point people die, complications, etc. think lot us still hope 12s waiters (waiting full FDA approval) get shots, plus schools state/federal hospitals/medical communities mandating shots, things improve greatly point. months, hopefully! saying things happen Sep/Oct... Devore, lawyer, represents Republican state senator southern part state. goof planning running Governor next election well. saber-rattling Darren Bailey's part. give dart gun go-pro, three confirmed vaccinations get back line. Used mostly ex-hippies, 10 years ago “health freedom” anti-vaccine movement took among far right libertarian circles, especially Texas west. influenced Texas legislature make childhood immunization registry opt—in rather opt-out almost every state, prevented vaccine exemption numbers published school level, district level. Dang bro that’s crazy 

I’m sure Alabama take measures control /s rampant, stupidity endemic

I'll borrowing turn phrase, thank you. really would! country people 100% reckless thanks shitty government, half million people died somehow people love vaccines. 
They chosing looks take it, photographing it, posting selfies first second doses thanking universal healthcare system almost collapsed several times. positive aura towards vaccine awesome! right you’re worst problem, every single human earth vaccinated, nobody 100% safe. scheduled J&amp;J shot, got paused, find different shot fell backwards moderna shot. femoral artery says 'Hi'. Completely agree, wasn’t trying say harmful way. incomplete. Like…the person shared acting like definitively proves natural immunity isn’t enough, far study shows. 

I’d like see thing mentioned regarding asymptomatic cases. truly want this, need understand natural immunity actually works vs vaccines. find they’re similar preventing severe cases/hospitalizations, we’re much better spot thought this. 

And feel like need say here: I’m vaccination, trying say natural immunity better vax. want shit end like everyone else find hundreds millions people recovered covid similar protection vaxxed absolutely HUGE. flip side, enough data showing pretty conclusively natural immunity far worse vax, could help pushing get vaxxed. Despite people want believe, everyone hasn’t vaxxed “crazy conspiracy theorist” whatever want label them. let’s honest - numbers almost certainly lower reality. helpful!!

Good response. really bad OHSU predication makes sense would need statewide intervention. Personally, feel like deserves credit setting goals, sticking them, trying move forward integrity alter plan working. think original idea here... integrity admit something working instead pushing forward stubbornly.

Oregon fared extremely well point easy Oregonians continue wonder big deal all. 

Anyway, appreciate response. one cares random rules, internet janitor. stupid forum, calm down. ""isolated adipose tissue healthy donors""

Errh... could mass-produced then? Seems like aimed ultra-elite who'll pay anything saw multi state report put 'unknown' vaccination status unvaxxed data. sure kind difference would make possibility based solely data standpoint Russian disinformation trolls figured push “freedom” anti-vax message spreads among far right. Useful idiots, Lenin would called them. scientists predicting 37 percent chance megathrust earthquake 7.1+ magnitude fault zone occur next 50 years. event felt throughout Pacific Northwest.
 current preparedness levels Oregon, anticipate without services assistance least 2 weeks, longer, Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake well. people two weeks food water ready. found Moderna vaccine 86% effective infection study period, Pfizer's 76%. Moderna's vaccine 92% effective hospitalization Pfizer's 85%.

 
But vaccines' effectiveness infection dropped sharply July, Delta variant's prevalence Minnesota risen 70%. 


Moderna 76% effective infection, Pfizer 42% effective. 
The study found similar results states. example, Florida, risk infection July people fully vaccinated Moderna 60% lower people fully vaccinated Pfizer."" proximity. I'm trying shame unvaxxed Amercians. I'm pointing evolutionary mechanism that's pretty well understood. think selective pressure account time number events. mutations occur wild among counties vaccine rate super low deployed there. infection opportunity mutation. Absolutely. 

Where US different, heterogenous population vaxxed unvaxxed. countries either mostly vaxxed vaxxed all. mix vaxxed/unvax creates new selective pressure gates. There's little pressure Delta evolve past current r0 extremely effective infecting. millions potential hosts infecting effectively. nature run places go that's mutations would otherwise take begin get selected. 

For example we've bunch variants like Eta, gamma, etc take hold Delta effective unvaxxed population. one mutation maybe dropped r0 lot (meaning can't compete w Delta) could breakthrough easily goes gate spreads. worry kind breakthrough variant unvaxxed areas likely mutate competing Delta. US different story. risk partially vaccinating population rapidly mutating virus. when? We’ll always risk variants Shit-shows varying degrees shit. Best explode (if could convince people get vaccinated), better last summer vaccine. 

A large segment vulnerable population vaccinated reduces likelihood hospitalization. Things going get bad, could far far worse. mom registered nurse 20 years brink meltdown since COVID started people unwilling vaccinated wear masks. also absolutely astounding many anti-vaxxers healthcare. called morning said unvaccinated nurse that's worked last 3 nights tested positive COVID keeps saying he'll fine keep working, even though he's symptomatic. Honestly even going people's heads nowadays??? things helped me, couple years pretty much improvement. Nerves slowest healing cells body part waiting nerves heal. part help work on.

Once got diagnosis Mayo Clinic, one things prescribed physical therapy, LAYING FLAT BACK. joke! honestly, could done home youtube videos. theory this: reprogram body work around current deficits taking vertical/standing equation. reteach body properly respond stimulus stress correct overacting heart rate stressing feet even sitting upright.

I know sounds bonkers tedious indeed work. things laying flat back moving arm circling machine. Using tension bands hands raising lowering legs. physical therapist never done anything like winged together. look Youtube exercises elderly, also exercises laying flat floor, see things did. PT 3 times week things like, 60 min 3 times week home would helpful IMO.

I began notice physical therapy body actually started acting normally, like, could standing heart rate would 150. laid flat/reclined work, heart rate reacted normally exercise. Started 80, would work 140, would cool down.

After success, started shifting exercises upright ones standing ones, body took ""normal"" reaction it. 8 months, walking running treadmill 15 minutes issues. 

Here things never gone away, managed: still get heart PVC flip flop skipped beats. still feel dizzy randomly (but figured vagus nerve runs colon GAS lol stimulates it), found low(er) carb diet REALLY helps minimize heart rate skips random dizziness. Staying electrolytes helps especially potassium!

I recall florinef years help stand long periods time, helps increase blood pressure fluid retention. years since needed it.

I still cannot take medicines like opiates side effects lower blood pressure without, know, fainting episode lower blood pressure. weird cause lower blood pressure, given metformin one point another unrelated issue oh man, seriously bottomed blood pressure. Vicodin thing strained back also made faint low blood pressure. 

I continue tips... brother 40s. told contact doctors manage condition. Last time December claims didn’t want get vaccine. told reach responded nonsense.

I want listen real doctors show shouldn’t listening internet doctors? rules require either tested, vaccinated recovered anything social (eat out, go gym etc.). either stay home, get vaccinated pay test.  far early tell FL top at. People really failing grasp much contagious Delta exponential nature R0. Even learned vaccinated vulnerable people, probably going offset sheer volume cases coming weeks. waiting fully FDA approved? originally that, taking long finally got earlier, know lot people still waiting. No, unvaccinated legals letting out. OP's link live updates can't read original article anymore usually give fake information get booster give normal information, say already got shots give you. number found comment August 2020. Regular illnesses still there. flu, cold, strep throat, etc. It’s implied heavily nowadays get sick, must covid, that’s true. got COVID J&amp;J. bad. Texas, black people far least vaccinated, less 25%. Asians around 60%, whites 40%, Latino population low 30%. demographic metric one state, unclear party affected more. evidence prior immunity good protecting delta. UK alpha delta circulating, reinfections delta we’re twice likely alpha. CDC study unvaccinated previously infected people 2.3 times likely get reinfected vaccinated.

Get vaccinated even prior infection. CDC advice along.

Here explanation also ‘lucky’ benefit treatments better figured now. NY would fewer deaths advantage year’s experience figuring help. I’m sure DeSantis find way lose advantage well, claiming superiority. even supply ID got shot. see possible. Chronic conditions make wish died effects. 

&amp;#x200B;

While death never outcome anyone want, saying ""if die fine"" oversimplyfing. Deaths may low, number people long term issues huge. paper came saying 80% covid long term conditions, ranging disabling deadly.

It's like saying ""eat less red meat avoid high cholesterol"" replying ""since lot people die immediately high cholesterol, I'm going ignore it""  Sorry man, even best nations, extremely expensive stem cell treatments usually aren’t available unless everything else tried. don’t know viable treatment be. sure won’t available poor third world nations.

The exception is, commenters said, there's reason concern. Like vaccine mandate. believe said lying misinformed.

I also said news sources I’ve read listen never vaccines 100%. range vaccines effectiveness 65% 96% logically would get sick.

Right different news sources overwhelming majority people testing positive and/or going hospital unvaccinated. truly wonder people feel death bed. wake up? Feel lied preacher?

Good luck everyone, hope many actually realise vaccinations kind weird government conspiracy. way crap Went clinic yesterday full kids getting sent schools. many kids turned away sent urgent care. probably clarified “Moderate Risk” Vaccinated person(s). 

The reality isn’t anymore money. isn’t anymore unemployment checks, small business grants, etc… necessary businesses forced close again. Government already willing/able do

So instead, they’ll keep things going. you’re vaccinated that’s problem. vaccine available sooner later kids imagine sentiment resonate lot people. Cool I’m medical professional, many friends also medical professionals, none us willing relocate work Florida ICUs endure abuse covid deniers matter much pay.

I think issue hand conservatives realizing much health depends goodwill nurses doctors. point goodwill tends run enough abuse. Something feel left children/delta/schools/masks dialogue issue children potentially bringing covid home school vaccinated parents. want kids catching delta school, also want catch delta kids possibly deal long covid, vaccines necessarily protect against. I'm normal BMI. pointing consequences doctors overweight. Sheesh! Tough crowd! Can’t wait Malaysia reach 50% vaccinated. We’re currently 38% adult population, vaccinating rate 480,000 people per day.

Malaysia population approx 33 million people, 21 million adults. usual stories NBCs world, China fact weighing whether abandon current approach Covid. usual stories like this, container much else want say China. I'm pretty sure districts going ""we're staying open unless like half kids hospital"" Good know! care. eyes election three years away one give shit. remember fought libs know stupid sound right now? China 1.5 **billion** people, essentially claiming constantly test them, without fail. logistically impossible.

Not hard understand. come original ideas own? Every time major shift masks vaccines made copies it. 

Why people fully vaccinated need public? Kentucky ahead curve entire pandemic. We've amazing leadership. Also, aside, Kentucky never left union. much common Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia Georgia, Florida, Texas, Mississippi. much so, start pandemic Governor joined Governors midwestern states create coalition fight Covid. weird place. likelihood fully vaccinated person transmitting disease? Like, break me:

The likelihood vaccinated person getting breakthrough infection.

The likelihood said vaccinated person transmitting disease to, say, unvaccinated child.  court system that. rulings overturned judges political party. ISPs filter want long government ask tell to. key thing, however, communications parties would subpoenaed attorneys lawsuit. 

Attempts hide evidence even one party far perfect. add millions people handful jobs ISPs offer, get leaks, jusges *hate* lied to. allowed proper systems place That's works Assuming you’re American, need really understand much people given last 18 months condescending struggles lack solutions. Assuming you’re liberal too, don’t loosen pro-restrictions stance, GOP gonna dominate midterms. read Pfizer's site, chose expand better understand acute myocarditis issue. test free. need official copy negative result, cost money Report haven't..the Facebook groups mean

Vaccination fully recommended leading medical originations Same. feeling end date whiplash good news never ending negative news demoralizing highest order.  goal natural herd immunity even sway them. options could done besides person schooling classroom. could small weekly groups social distanced settings. problem states want spend necessary resources adjust already failing school system.  mean, keep finding weird long term effects kids. guess hospital though cool that. wasn’t long ago teachers begging vaccine controversial wanted get “early,” Fauci saying “we require get it.”

This whole thing total chaos way would ask doctor, internet. wasn’t good, I’d say lasted least 3 months (maybe 6, gone away now) Brilliant! Oh, hello OP, lol.

IDK, going hard compare directly pretty good idea percentage new Delta cases time period studied. one (let's say) average 70% new cases coming Delta study period 85% could still see pretty significant difference results, even trying factor time since dosed. Yeah. vaccine still 70-80% efficacy transmission, issue. combine data even worse drop efficacy infection/transmission, get quite serious cases deaths even highly vaccinated population.

LONE TREE, Colo. (CBS4) – Doctors say patients hospitalized COVID-19 range age, medical history, include genders, overwhelmingly one trait common: vaccinated. people admitted severe illness virus, average age dropped concerning medical staff need increase vaccinations. 
“The danger really breathing becomes difficult, cannot breathe,” said Dr. Eric Lung, chief medical officer Sky Ridge Medical Center. 
Lung says they’re seeing increase patients past week come states. 15 patients noted Tuesday, one vaccine. Lung says cases someone vaccinated, could also another underlying medical condition. age patients moved 30s 40s adults 60s. 
“The question posed doctors, ‘Is anything could done?’ response loved one could received vaccine,” told CBS4 Tuesday. “There’s lot anger denial families that.” 
These patients may go onto need ventilator move ICU. situation similar UCHealth number hospitalized cases 149, across 13 hospitals. increase around 80 patients earlier year. average age 43 predominantly patients unvaccinated, much 95%. 
“It’s affecting everyone across sorts different levels education, religion, etc.,” said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director infection prevention control UCHealth. “There one potentially spared.” 
Baron says unvaccinated concerns, unsure safe got misinformation. says deaths among old even younger adults, cases across state well. hospitalized averaging five days care, visitations limited depending location. 
“People still dying disease every single day. Every single day could prevent potentially get vaccine,” told CBS4 Tuesday. “I think that’s wakeup call, think, ‘Oh gosh, could me.'” 
Her staff tell understanding danger late. says family friends learned impact virus loved ones, choosing get vaccine. 
“‘Can get vaccine now?’ answer obviously, ‘No’ unfortunately,” shared patients asked. “It infiltrates group, they’re like, ‘Okay, wrong, please go get vaccine. Don’t get sick like I’m sick now.” 
Doctors worry people understand concerning need medical care institutions. also say spread comes unvaccinated populations helps virus mutate prolong pandemic, potentially sending healthcare system back toward scenario saw last year. 
“The ones admitted hospital admitted reason, sick,” Lung said. part research process. wrong sub covid questions? Aren’t pro-vaccine here? Wondering there’s evidence vaccinated individuals breakthrough cases testing negative covid quicker unvaccinated? - vaccinated person symptoms covid start testing negative days later? Let Mexico pay it! seem like that. Breakthroughs happened expected happen original strains well.  Tragic hundreds thousands doses thrown away, wasted US.  You’re asking advice, you’re asking people think you. 

If don’t even argument said, disagreeing her??? don’t even counter-argument, aka don’t even know disagree, you’re essentially disagreeing disagreeing shitshow Florida.  They've pushing Florida fucked state entire time.  different. J&amp;J works better many flu vaccines even delta. good mRNA vaccines doesn’t mean good. Please understand unvaccinated qualms vaccines general. childhood vaccines history well-tracked documented side effects. COVID vaccine not. find vaccine distribution menstrual abnormalities blood clotting common side effect vaccine. they're forcing get vaccinated, still choice.

And choice get vaccinated, country choice reduce risk spreading COVID. Stopped coming sub months....well ready doomsday part 2 overdramatic. need separate holding area eligible unvaxed people. We’ll get treat people didn’t intentionally put position.  ultimately know took every available jab shipped Africa, we'd better spot globally.

Both mRNA vaccines need stored consistently -60-80c (or normal refrigerated temperatures 31 days). Shipping entire stock vaccine Africa would mean huge amount spoiled vaccine refrigeration capacity store distribute efficiently. need work building manufacturing storage capacity vaccine countries improve vaccines stored room temperature really penetrate many countries. Thanks reply! Well one thing, there’d way calculate without knowing percentage population vaccinated. start getting higher percentages vaccinated people, start seeing upticks percentage breakthrough cases, that’s statistics. 100% population vaxxed, 100% cases would breakthroughs—that says nothing efficacy vaccine. seems like still indicates 80-90% efficacy pretty good think San Francisco already allowing J&amp;J non MRNA vaccines. understand negate point. earmarking said deals several understandings. One give away choose, already several times. Bottom line shots give away people need, choose. paid irrelevant. Personally, I'd like actually report breakthrough cases entirety, instead people die hospitalized.

""As May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned monitoring reported vaccine breakthrough cases focus identifying investigating hospitalized fatal cases due cause. shift help maximize quality data collected cases greatest clinical public health importance.""  might better adapted future climate power ‘em. Yes. Delta threat, real threat losing ICU capacity due loads mutations occur. virus showing amazing abilities mutate quickly become infectious slightly deadly. 

We giving virus perfect situation develop mutation get around vaccines. Partially vaccinated, young unvaccinated, natural infection vaccinated. could give better odds virus. 

Likely, see mutation next 60-90 days. know starts infecting large swaths population. US testing levels really bad early warning new strain. 

I guess seeing evolution work. mental capacity wear masks come ok sensationaizing. people walking around thinking impervious they're vaccinated. need know act accordingly. current trend continues, infections/hospitalizations/deaths continue rise.

I mean, rocket science, virus spreads unless something stop it, AL least vaccinated state nation next nothing prevent spread. ask people advice?

Delta allowed classroom without vaccinated. None said changes that. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

VAERS 5000ish deaths recorded getting vaccination, though think database reports cause-and-effect. assume people looking it, updating database 'causal' vs 'coincidental'. thought protecting children? asked toys, mentioned toy banned following three reported deaths children. things time protect children it’s part societal responsibility.

I get plenty issues raising kids insane environment, think it’s callous ignore danger know children put things like bans mask mandates premature school openings. you’re akin complaining car seats children make destination unharmed. vaccine car seat determined safe, maybe could considered alarmist. then, cool bit.

Spinning data original vaccines way this. statement Pfizer article appears acknowledge that. say this? talk “constant inoculations” episode Hank stole mower. unvaccinated create evolutionary pressure virus worse variants emerge inevitably infect vaccinated again. one predict what’s going happen. Looks reputable sources understand always right, better grasp layman does. 

It could evolve weaker strain, could straight crazy like Delta. one wants anymore, haven’t handled decently. Every time get test, fail. variants get weaker, susceptible die off. let disease mutate more, nasty one damage, etc. EMA conditionally approved four vaccines safe effective. higher standard FDA's emergency use authorization, authorisation vaccine authorisation temporary use unauthorised vaccine. Europeans confident taking approved vaccines considered effective. 

There hardly medications ""fully effective."" always body chemistry, environment factors, aspects render medication inert patient. holding vaccines standard ridiculous unhelpful. think combined Time Vaccination now. know drops time, maybe 1-2% month.

Look Nanjing, initial outbreak, zero case two last three days. couple cities Anhui one asymptomatic person each. three round mass testing, find people infected. pretty clear asymptomatic vaccinated person, even Chinese vaccine, transmit much.

There's way know going affect get think people surprised initial 95% efficacy symptomatic infection phase 3 trials. much changed since then. virus changed, society changed, etc. Also CDC touted breakthrough infections rare, were. rare vaccinated people, less virulent strains, etc.

I think everyone still board hospitalization/death protection, breakthrough rate sort air hard people wrap minds around. Body aches 12 hours went away sleeping  think general viral vector mRNA booster (esp Moderna) seems ""best"" limited studies far.

Why would ever start testing everyone time??? Even moral qualms, insane number workers would need process many people/followups trials would absurd.

No don't. say do, goes agenda.

Part small government idea means letting state local government control Federal government stays things much possible.

If that's case, Florida's governor ban localities instituting mask mandates? Seems rather hypocritical small government tag line. Orlando resident here, Disney mask mandate go inside anywhere property.  doubt vaccinations helped keep hospitlisation numbers lower January peak considering high cases got thr Uk. Makes wonder though high hospitlisation figures would without vaccines. good example recent NYTimes piece quotes CDC director, Rochelle Walensky. addition making insane claim getting infected vaccinated equivalent getting booster,

If mild enough infection, sort true, sure would said this. agree getting infected prevent infections insane easily disproven looking clinical trials themselves, checked prevention symptomatic illness, severe disease (which secondary outcome).

I agree disproves anything. vaccines designed prevent severe illness, infection. trials designed check symptomatic illness. things true. trials way faster easier--which really important trying get vaccines rapidly. disease always behaved aggressively older folks, that's kids vaccinated yet. entirely expected case rate among children would *much* loser is. they're 20% population, the. represent ~5% new cases.all talk hospitalization death great way ignore chronic issues recovered people often have.

None place ""blame"" what's driving recent surge, may attributable Deltas greater virulence. Blame useful moment.

That children represent 15% infections make 20% population, great news. sign pathogen becoming *more* adept infecting humans. 2020 saw [infection rates among children jump 15% comforting. Perfect time meet let Jebus life. Probably so. think Trump one kind chance changing minds, even then, it’s probably small chance.  22% US population children (defined 18 since article specified otherwise). Children probably making slightly less social contacts right school, still exist exposed day cares, camps, vacation locations, social events clear dramatic change exposure be. FWIW point know 4 friends/family fully mRNA vaxxed got breakthroughs last month. like 1-2 weeks pretty rough flu like symptoms + congestion, another 2 weeks taste smell slowly comes back. point one taste back, others slowly gaining back. 

This really doesn’t feel like cold mild flu feel like crap days completely back normal. don’t blame people wanting get symptomatically infected.  think booster needed depend people's tolerant risk. 
 
If want get infection (i.e. worry potential long covid), want get booster since antibodies dropped due natural decay antibodies certain months vaccine escaped variants. 
 
However, care get infection, get serious sick (i.e. protection severe disease/death), really need one since t-cell isotopes really changed variants. 
 
Antibodies prevents infection memory B cells prevent serious disease.

Personally, think immunocompromised people 65 get booster. better safe sorry high risk group. Florida needs pull bootstraps highly-vaccinated societies (UK, Israel, etc.) risking health care collapse Delta? [preliminary England showing delta actually lower IFR children. side effects Covid ORDERS MAGNITUDE worse frequent vaccine we've ever had. like saying ""A friend died car accident, wearing seatbelt.

Official numbers suggest 59% single-jabbed far. RKI data suggest significantly higher numbers.

Two (known) problems seem combine particular age group:

- fact Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine (popular young people generally primarily used 18-59 age group) requires one shot, easy doctors put registration software. Common practice seems register directly ""second"" shot (to highlight patient fully vaccinated) register first shot. leads underreporting first shots.

- fact company doctors (i. e. doctors directly employed big companies like Porsche Bosch workforce) often able register vaccinations way GPs (as naturally linked databases). workaround problem exists, estmated 50% company doctors using it. doctors dealing working population, problem primarily affects 18-59 age bracket.

Each problems could, theory, lead undercount several million jabs. 

Some researchers saying percentage 18- 59-year-olds received least one jab might closer 69% rather 59%. unless reporting problems resolved hard say sure. month ago everything looking good. Delta hitting hard fast.

First got first dibs full fledged studies there. got priority willing share data deployment numbers depth Pfizer allows easily understand long term efficacy results program. mean ""fuck, Florida fucked covid""? Got checked several times Germany Austria. They're already downvoting you. Well, son hospitalized 3 days 4 due h1n1, happen.  No, Herd Immunity works. Immunity affects R, thus rate change, climate also affects R. Thus, R slowly declining herd immunity, fastly accelerate (a 50% more) winter sets in. saturation level also varies R, get herd immunity higher level winter summer. Agree. UK started hinting age 50+ going get boosters really soon, know there's reason it. UK pretty impeccable comes data collection. think think necessary, necessary. Moderna. First shot slightly sore arm. Second shot kicked ass next day--only slight fever sore-ish arm, dead tired day. know folk remedy legit lot people recommend drinking hell Gatorade PowerAde shot. misleading title. article references CEO Prevea Health, hospital/Healthcare corporation. cite specific studies organizations conduct research.

Also, really saying seek unapproved booster shots, research need dosage boosters going. Even worse, 99 giving nothing. number make sick, number put hospital, number put medically induced coma tube shoved throat, *then* there's one kills also options too. perfect world. someone educator mean they're absurdly stupid pandemic Florida could release state numbers frequent basis, no. weekly Friday update. good system really. Hopefully politicians random nonsense election next month afterwards. 

At least everyone get shot want. even temporary vaccination sites times week even need appointment (Bavaria). borderline eugenic thought.  Florida entered chat. 

Waving giant foam “we’re number one” finger. Delta clearly transmissible withheld short period time recalculate dangers. not. Every place offers vaccines keeps record. There's central database yet. people fear mongering new variants information set. glad science already working methods prevent variants beat vaccines, good updated events. No, 100% transparent data fuels distrust. People already don’t trust public health officials like Fauci they’ve told noble white lies “for greater good”. Cover anything make far worse. realize Pfizer Moderna exact vaccine different doses. Really sounds like running CDC/FDA. could booster shot 10 now! doses wasted solution give countries, permit people decide get boosters. Sturgis half million people packing town 7000. Tell one bar even approaches that. I'll sure avoid within mile radius. help Australia &amp; New Zealand dragged feet. got containment right got vaccine drive catastrophically wrong.


Everyone else placed orders early full crisis mode. Things could handled better everyone impression would take years vaccine. rapid success caught nations guard ill prepared scale rapidly required. Production continuing ramp squabbling allocation contentious.  would region handle widespread geological even like earthquake - well, seems. I’m saying yes, masks distancing yes. delta +, it’s going effective before. keep hearing viral load 1000 fold vaccinated asymptomatic carriers. honestly think we’re heading another 200k deaths shutdown another variant. wouldn’t send kids school right (if kids). damn, thing gonna does. It’s simple biochemistry. Work remote. Btw, get chance, read “Codebreaker” Walter Isaacson, story CRISPR mRNA Jennifer Doudna. work technology. I’ve freaking basically every third sentence already knew this. Stay safe. Sorry bad wording. 

They also run pcr tests go dinner/ social life etc take quick test. pcr needed positive quick test. results slower cant take workout whatever.

A positive quick test force PCR order confirm though. think point mask mandate save lives consists activated Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) isolated adipose tissue healthy donors, found reduce inflammation alleviate respiratory symptoms patients suffering life-threatening respiratory distress brought COVID-19.

While agree fine post, worst reason world do/not anything. nope need 5: makes easier people get tested. turn make easier people spread it. would think there's surplus vaccines could abandon ""all vaccines equally effective"" bullshit nah us JJ fam less protected reasons.  guy “Shapiro conservative” can’t use actual logic conversation. Sounds fancy.  Eh, somewhat tangential, single slide!

I'm completely convinced vaccinated people capacity spread. kids end hospital? then?

On side world (EU), rethoric kid must contracted COVID outside school setting. causal connection seldomly considered, even multiple cases ""suspicously"" coincide school class.

There's also little reporting done public (nor privately parents). individual schools may not-so-ethical incentives downplay issues, main driver political. want sustain education kids, successors, give chance successful lifes.

Personally I'm torn this. understand necessities young generation. goal good. think government address risks best possible way. school system remains similarily resource-starved pre-COVID. Instead paying create safer education environment, general population simply ""pays"" suffering exposure virus spread. Available tax (or relief) money mostly destined short-term casualties small businesses, restauration touristic sector. voices louder point quantifyable existing damage. politicians short-sighted listen them. rarely care invest future, even future 3 months away.  issue delta variant really really contagious 
I know get people vaccinated except make compulsory Thanks! Exactly, media sells Lambda problem papers serious studies say contrary. Sure, next one million also get wasted used boosters.

A strategy aggressive donation needs put place, yes, existence surplus shots clearly isn’t criteria deciding that.  don’t trust doctors giving vaccine.... trusts doctors save hospital get covid... logic fair though, almost viruses potential weird long term side effects small percentage people. uncle ended needing get heart transplant basically cold years ago. Well point, lots children asthma due poor air quality healthcare overall (like friend got getting bronchial infection went unattended suuuuuper bad know healthcare.) complaints. Fits right passport, California electronic record show QR code.    people would upset FDA opposite. theres resource convince thing, aside possibly getting bad case covid learning error ways. sad reality. let go. Yes, here: Adjusting arguments. good question. obvious stop everyone dead crippled virus. Yes vaccine status isn't? Whoever told things backing science.

I'm talking schools relevant policy question involving kids. Why? Maybe that’s reason preparing now. Reddit moment  Damn, somebody sounds super entitled bare minimum help stop pandemic. 


Thanks prolonging shit show! I’m sorry hear experiencing that. hope resolve soon. 


If may ask, get Covid vaccination? definitely cheap given description. even get vaccinated, going take YEARS reach kind big reduction transmission...

Uhh... What?

Widespread vaccination results fairly large decrease transmission pretty quickly. saw handful countries Delta broke out. Vaccinations started creep 60% 70% caae counts fell cliff.

Maybe defining ""Big reduction"" differently am, dealing Delta, areas high vaccination rates would seeing big reductions spread compared time last year. Abbott turning looney. Hope gets ousted next election Blame unvaccinated. authorized J&amp;J specifically?

Here Canada one first countries mix vaccines, almost one J&amp;J, even think administered Canada (mostly Canadian people US). might be, hospitalizations don’t lie.  Good viruses worry then… Even initially rising periodic dips way up. think early call evidence slowdown point. Disney Christmas experience say least.  feel like we're going see alot difference hospitlisation numbers lowest vaccinated states highest vaccinated states. breaks data per state information for.

You see % cases per 100k.

Outside states, 98% (and states still 95%+)  Ok, here's quasi-extrapolated deduction based know far:

While data fully collected yet, see harm getting third shot tolerated first 2. countries pilot programs already. best, giving additional immunity. worse, similar reaction third dose first two (short bout body aches such). Even success, getting mask mandate removed happen overnight every day kiddos Kentucky required wear masks school step right direction. 

Worth noting Kentucky's largest school district, Jefferson County (Louisville) already mask mandate place.  Oh interesting thanks, reason see button tried Good luck! Wish guys well!  HIV isn’t even transmitted similar way Covid-19, I’m sure it’s included disease people heard lot about. People don’t catch HIV sneezes/saliva spray attending something like birthday party, possible things listed (although less Ebola numerous reasons). known yet. got shot Sheriff, got one deputy.

But would get five hundred COVID shots would get five hundred man gets one thousand COVID shots inside store.

Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred variants. Five hundred twenty five thousand injections seems fair.

COVID change variant. need feel fine. COVID, I'm getting shot number 8,675,309. That’s awesome Austin, Whole Foods might better *snicker* hell get flag ad???? someone symptoms thinks may contact someone infected, call GP advice send get PCR test, free. see problem. one object treatment reasons object taking vaccine? limited description given makes actually sound like type vaccine. *The study examine severity reinfections.* 
So study basically useless. Nice. UK completely reopened mask mandate right now?

Can use example UK argue highly vaccinated countries aggressive reopening? Despite high number cases, fatalities hospitalizations remained fraction previous wave. missing something? stupid question: know numbers Florida fudged Bring boosters. also wish heard advancments trials treatments? they’re Yeah, dude someone stand lose 7 IQ points. get it? ask Walgreens previous shots  Kentucky’s Red right? vaccines actually designed prevent infection,

I'm really interested makes say this. I'm perfectly honest, sounds like something got another redditor got another redditor misunderstood quote.

Like, vaccines designed produce immune response. strong immune response determines stops infections merely reduces strength symptoms. Fauci et al may expected ""sterilizing immunity"" level response first generation vaccines, mean designed hope could that. waiting FDA approval. hits federal government probably require it, many state governments. frequent testing proof, hopefully person’s expense. point thank removing genes society.  actually refer original quote, notice stated 'normies', reference 'they tracking us crowd'.

Op made distinction, me. talking level.

If can't see that, I'm sorry, can't help you.

Feel free believe whatever like me... Facts damned.  shouting wind. someone dumb enough ask faceless strangers internet health advice, amount telling to, stop them. going give sterilizing immunity, immune system going thing remember COVID barring doomsday variant keep hospital. Historical example, people think older folks less likely die Spanish flu exposure Russian flu 1889. Read past headline.

9 adults, vaccinated, 1 got infected, mildly symptomatic.

8 children, none vaccinated, 6 got infected, 2 mildly symptomatic (""smattering cold-like symptoms""), 4 presumably asymptomatic would mentioned it.

Conclusion: Vaccines effective, including Delta. Kids severely impacted Covid, including Delta. Good. Enjoy it. going go year, New Orleans (hopefully) booked Thanksgiving Disney Christmas well...despite saving 2020 travel budget gone now. may already enough data make call sometimes hesitant fear rushed. I'm saying rush perception rushed could lead spending inordinate amount time combing data have.

That's fine normal environment normal environment anymore, pandemic. favor vaccine mandates, mask mandates vaccinated people. Californians, remember vote honest mRNA vaccines development since first SARS. luckily framework time SARS-COV-2 emerged quickly develop vaccine specific it. Zero. plan (high school, eastern shore ish) masks…yeah ok cause 3k 13-19 year olds keep entire 7.5 hrs. It’s gonna interesting probably scary.  Yeah early June prior Delta spiking. Thankful went back cases averaging like 10,000 day US compared like 100,000 day. Anyways, everywhere else FL absolutely rules least parks CMs every entrance indoor location making sure everyone put masks. Misread patients initially.

Just unvaccinated ones.... school started yesterday state.

Within 2 weeks we'll see massive, record breaking spike. Fair enough, need realize anyone one 500~ (I'm guessing here) breakthrough cases resulted death consideration, need research stuff. FDA going quickly possible, takes time. 

My uncle died early November COVID. blame FDA approving vaccine 3 months earlier could saved life. mean Ruby Tuesday. 🙃 drug test politicians? It’s normal lie like that. need quarantined vaccinated symptoms. Key time test 5-7 days exposure, test already taken likely mean much. Ok, here's challenge you. sound hear head 24/7. 1 hour. Play without stopping, entire hour. Let know last. make hour, day. make day, week. K? now, get back sometime free today tell lasted hour. sound annoying turned off. idea devasting balance issues, tinittus be. already vaccine mask mandate place, I'm paying full tuition online classes again, fuck shit. kids give parents family.members (unless vaccinated) Right, without knowing baseline I'm sure 90% amazing slight improvement Definitely. doctors said nothing one side-effects it’s working. I’m feeling much better today. strain hour ago gone. hope doesn’t return scary. hopefully fine, anyway. still wish get MRI tests general 🙌 ! Almost everyone family gotten vaccine they’ve gotten usual side-effects. 

My dad 65 usual symptoms. First vaccine - fever exhausted. sister 34 - sore arm first shot. Second shot- usual symptoms day ( fever, aches etc ). Completely fine now. 

 told sister wait baby currently breast feeding recommended. mom severe allergies medications products- she’s waiting immunologist get back order recommend right vaccine.

My brother got Johnson’s vaccine- got symptoms three days later. day. completely fine. 

My friend got Johnson’s vaccine said severe pain. sounded like dying first day. Completely different reaction brother. completely fine thankful suffered first day comparison I’m going through. LMAO

Different people get different reactions. hope reaction anything serious 🙌! vaccinated people come close contact someone COVID-19 tested 3-5 days following date exposure wear mask public indoor settings 14 days receive negative test result. isolate test positive. Fully vaccinated people live household someone immunosuppressed, increased risk severe disease, unvaccinated (including children &lt;12 years age) could also consider masking home 14 days following known exposure receive negative test result. fully vaccinated people COVID-like symptoms need quarantine restricted work following exposure someone suspected confirmed COVID-19, follow testing masking recommendation vaccinated people monitor symptoms COVID-19 14 days following exposure. one talking Florida back March/April/May 2020

You’re going alienate validate anti-vax anti-maskers attitude like seeing people's faces? like sweat breathe hot air back I'm hot yoga? statistical bias current new cases data?

I've wary CDC saying vaccinated people could unmask number reasons soon happened, especially due lack data one way time regarding vaccinated peoples' ability contract contagious amount time.

The current talking point is, paraphrased, ""breakthrough cases low % cases causing outbreak, unvaccinated people"", wonder: vaccine working properly allowing body lesser infection, tests currently mostly administered based discovery symptoms, missing catching large number positive infections vaccinated people gone unmasked, contracting virus, showing symptoms getting tested? lot people absolutely denial we’ll never zero Covid. literally think it’ll gone 202X (2022, 2023, etc), “wear mask wait”. 0 side effects whatsoever Get logical thoughts! made claim ""most universities"" mandating vaccination supporting sources data? point strict rule (vaccination required basically life) complete dick move restrictions arent removed places

Also uncomfortable mask gym, thing glasses on, stop prissy. lockdown would get maybe 50% compliance vaccinated 10% unvaccinated.

So instead saving possible lives eliminating spread virus, settle lockdown saving lives limiting spread bit enough. 

That sounds like exactly sort incrementalism current administration supporters get behind! let perfect enemy good! can't save everyone mean try save anyone, right? 

I mean, 50% compliance vaccinated 10% compliance unvaccinated still 100 million Americans wearing masks, measures would absolutely apply serious brakes virus' spread. saying 100 million mask mandate observers enough justify lockdown, lives would save worth political personal obstacles?

For real though. think people dug even community leaders (i.e. faith leaders)

He feels slightly better yesterday Monday especially sounded terrible. ""oh wow sound sick phone"" mean audibly hearing trouble breathing wheezing. 

He got J&amp;J vaccine FWIW *should* compare risk single car ride. Comparing fatality rate course year catching COVID make sense. given day, protecting kids taking precautions getting COVID would driving car. hahaha oh god people ridiculous!

Im vaccinated murder anyone magical thinking. Shame you. South similar. Pride, white hostility towards blacks, often legitimate often totally inappropriate, genuflect Jesu. treasure household sign picked cares, they're town. reads, "" raised Sweet Tea Jesus. co biz today. One subs closed two kids 18 factory became infected Covid. They, like 80% region, get vaxxed. line is, we're lied to, believe Jesus protect me. Florida population 21.6 million, UK approx 68 million.

Florida average daily deaths 141, UK average daily deaths 87. absolutely dystopian draconian scenario, remove human faces forever indoors environments. i've seen least dozen children restaurants last two months Mine like 6 7 kids, think mine does. No, don't. taling *attempts* shaming Hopefully people psych without Covid. That’s fucked up. get one? cost money? absolutely evidence fertility issues associated either vaccine COVID infection itself. Also evidence menstrual changes, either, although illness insult body throw periods month two. essentially, neither impact PCOS.

Anecdotally many many new OB visits (approx 8 weeks along) last months already vaccinated. pleased see number vaccinated women pregnancy go well unfortunately seeing significant increase pregnant women hospitalized COVID. one 35yo mother 27wks along vent three weeks. never coming vent. We're hoping baby make far enough fair chance survival.

It saddens docs (usually ob/gyns) parrot misinformation.

I strongly encourage get vaccine ASAP. fair, full talking point US media exaggerating nature pandemic partisan reasons would stop election.

And turns out, US media likes sensational pandemic stories matter office :) Yes educated skills needed carry nursing tasks, trained medically. assume infected vaccination became available? Thought end would year, seems like it’ll least couple years rate.  Schools next. don’t even school-aged kids would contribute. Bend least half wearing masks rn. month ago definitely shifting parts central Oregon Universities able stay open. Elementary schools another story. grandkids going back two weeks. That's think going happen: we're going see smaller smaller outbreaks wave ends home state, think I'm going say fuck well get 3rd shot weekend. vaccination campaign slowing significantly Germany, running full speed places like Ireland Spain, Germany going use Moderna alotment first half August (2.6 million doses total). means share EU countries increase choose call doses up. Germany also waived Johnson&amp;Johnson alotment recently, also going EU countries (whereas Germany's Astrazeneca stock going Covax).

Statistically speaking, theory, Germany call alotment vaccine given time-window, share EU countries specific time-window rise nearly 23%. Moderna absolutely killed day second shot, like 40°C fever. 
But man called SPIKEVAX, never felt cool get vacxine  die unnecessarily Schools can’t even get kids follow dress code. Masks going issue. approach peak mid-September earliest. think far dubious cast doubt perfectly good research research poorly presented science journalists. 

Pretty much research related Covid flawed way mean shut wait full understanding whole situation. 

The global pandemic constantly evolving need much date research get. can't afford wait years able draw conclusions develop public health policies. nobody happier Execs CNN. think issue numbers focus Covid 19 delta variant. countries stricter rules school. Delta variant transmissible. Therefore it’s likely we’re sudden influx cases since school opening. 


I predict (and scientist take it’s worth). see number go 500 2500 coming months. point either vaccines need mandated new variant end year. 56 million school aged children. Assuming 50% transmission rate 1/10,000 death rate. Means 2500 kids. Accounting 4 million already it’ll put total close 2500. 


The bigger issue see schools breeding grounds cause virus evolve. Tight quarters, dirty kids, dirty schools, lots interaction. cause multiple variants appear. Yes, although make mistake: Russian trolls push pro-vaccine narrative well. Many far left also involved anti-vax ""movement"".

The goal simply sow division mistrust government. I've say done great job, far. Whats end goal then. know thats kind cop question think relevant can't keep bunkering fear might one day mutate deadly put context, overall mortality rates lower childhood mortality auto accidents).

This extremely misleading wish people would stop it. Kids ride cars *multiple times every day*. mortality rate *per car ride*, COVID compared to. reality, child's chances dying individual car ride exponentially lower kid caught COVID once.

Thank much compilation. outdoor mask mandates mid May. went June grateful mask beach. WA mandate healthcare workers well (which includes long term care -- basically everyone Phase 1A).

OR gave weak side step allowing weekly testing avoid vaccination. Doses going trash USA huge amounts. would agree could used elsewhere.  That’s actually pretty normal festivals like that. I’ve worked lot ‘event medicine’ strep cases usually charts lol.  Dead people can't vote idiots remember name. Unfortunately, lower expectations “normal” many politicians.

 'If die,..."" ""I WANT CAT!"" "" Okay, done!"" super cool cat, I'm surprised.


I long list health problems. chances surviving even vaccinated low. days sure going survive vaccine.🥴 mandate vaccine fight State court. Really that's option state forbids it. Nebraska reporting figures smaller counties. Ignore Nebraska's numbers. could take antibody test time. Based that, could decide think need booster. It'll great way teach kids statistics. Dear G-d, he's nurse, twice, still stupid? 

I share feelings this, anxiety. Ashwaganda become new friend. Hang there. helps, someone knows feel. Yeah agree. can't believe kids going going school person year.  mandate vaccines? Masks distancing won’t end pandemic - vaccines immunity population end pandemic Putting HIV list stupid. So, saying okay move family across country kids wear masks? consider rational decision? mean, personally care anybody's kids talking rational decisions failing see argument offers better solution. ""Let children die"" seems like solution all. four people still trade person NYSE unsurprised announcement. Why? know. Like said, can't decide yet. think I've made decision never daily drinker again, alcohol house, special occasions? know yet. Interesting. realize that.  Also sure lot antivaxxers lying claiming vaccinated.. probably don’t want embarrassed covid vaccinated hospital using precious resources didn’t need to.. Infact wouldn’t surprised half 17% non vax making lies.. however can’t see scenario vaccinated person would lie say they’re vaccinated.. would super pissed fully vaccinated two weeks out, telling doctors he’ll yeah vaccinated.. done I've seriously considered it. got shot back February fairly young age two serious health conditions. I'm also state essentially outlawed local mandates help curb spread governor said state mandates coming matter what. job even considering letting us work home even though live major metropolitan area county 8 ICU beds left. 

If government pretty much telling every day every person themselves, shocked people behave like every person themselves. mitigation coming? mandates coming? help coming? People going prevent suffering. 

On top that, people watching vaccines get tossed trash. Vaccines never going make arms anyone Indonesia. like saying extra piece pizza someone Africa starving. piece pizza would go landfill know it! monsters throw away pizza! Dw, disease spreading places high vaccine rates nobody really dying. places disease really turned flu worry about. Check vaccination rates doctors ( nurses ). figure doctors rushed got vaccinated reported levels know something. Nebraska fucking lying. That’s super good point. Thank insight! delta shit maddening. collect books filled stuff doesn’t know. It’s called library. Hahaha yessss that’s first stop!! Staying Poipu don’t worry get once!  got email doc confirming requirement visits. CDC throw weight behind employers mandating vaccine. Say fully support recommend vaccine mandates workforce 

This along FDA full approval children getting vaccine get lot people vaccinated antivax lax last year half, probably psych ward. anyone getting 2020 vibes comments thread? things feel worse despite safe effective vaccine… R0 rate infectious disease spreads population nobody immunity everyone acting like normally do.

Rt rate disease seems spreading population people before, people immunized, folks taking whatever precautions are.

It's exponential growth matters. Rt 4 means go 1 person 4 16 256 1024 hops. generation takes 5 days, month one initial infection become 4096 infections. month that, would go 17 million, virus would probably trouble finding new people infect that.

The thing remember exponential growth people get sick going get sick part last generation one -- final 10 days peak. longer variants keep mutating, largest chance serious one. Pan-viral therapeutic like Brilacidin urgently needed Nurses basically technicians, they’re really educated much actual medicine simply say “if want football tailgate parties let’s get vaccinated party on”!

There, FTFY. unfortunate kids ones live consequences, sadly. thing prior Covid, Disney rarely ""full 100%"" capacity.  Couple fact several stores, shows, restuarants (are?) closed due pandemic, meant less room spread out. saying capp 75% capacity, still crowded. think beginning REALLY reduced capacity lot help! That's hope go back to. Can't remember % though, could tell difference sure. Yeah shame clearly asymmetrical warfare element here. Desantis literally made similar comment last week Biden intellectually diminished.  cases largely due unvaccinated, lot done try vaccinate people anti vaxxers largely unreceptive, what’s point reintroducing restrictions? 

I 21 stayed almost entirely isolated masked eligible vaccine. take gap year graduation COVID made impossible get shadowing hours healthcare masters degree want. mental health took dive education drastically dropped quality. able participate things brought sliver joy socially based. truly, truly expected go entire endeavor people refused get vaccinated therefore assumed risk? (Not talking people unable get vaccine ofc). that’s case, hope society fun dealing bunch young people killing overdosing. joking. can’t again.

CLEAR EVIDENCE Japanese Chinese studies clearly showed Aerosolized spread Virus early March 2020. also said Fomite transmission (through surfaces) main way virus spread. Asian scientists doctors advocating masks.

Knowing CDC recommend masks people US several months later.  really pathetic, since could saved thousands (or more) lives consistent message masking beginning. friend mine died prematurely giving birth. 37 years healthy lady. gave birth last Friday (via c section ) died Monday. oxigen drop 80% (which already super low) 40% passed away.

This US , vaccine still distributed chance get yet.

Baby nicu covid free far. ( 2 months premature)   see people posting option kids can’t get quality virtual education variety reasons yet live states masks schools aren’t mandated? worked schools last year red district. virtual kids fell far behind expected grade level upcoming year. Issues access, parents unable facilitate virtual learning, kids completely disengaged education etc. honestly don’t know solution kids coming two years lost education. right, didnt know standards internet forum posting ""nearly high"" media outlets days.

Ups sorry data back statement up😲 would surprised Maybe...it's burning UK, kind of, many vaccinated/ immune hospitalizations/ deaths declining steadily.

But places lucky, it'll way costly.

And biggest fear wave might bring worse variant make us start again, that'd truly hideous gut punch. Depends harmful new thing variant pre-existing infection yields immunity, turns mild illness there’s nothing worry It’s really numbers game. Moderna likely protect getting covid-19 first place. Hence there’s greater chance would’ve never gotten covid-19.

Wow, given population density, New England states relatively amazing. 0, realistic number anything there. comparison 2018-2019 flu deaths 477 children 17. 

But past real point discussion base number prior votes shaping question. Note taken. states publishing similar also seen stats varying good bit Louisiana various hospital systems various states, though list handy (I need compile one).

That’s say virus can’t dangerous children, obviously be. risk age groups similar people 18, global death count would closer 4,000 4 million.

Vaccination great, it’s training body fight infection drastically reduce risk death severe outcome. it’s going eradicate virus, best likely outcome relegating SARS-Cov-2 joining 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1 circulating Coronaviruses get us mildly sick every years unfortunately result pneumonia death small population.

Ms Black, Betty..... increases COVID transmissions kids recently, I've seen lots (extremely understandable) worry sub recently COVID kids. Frustratingly, lots articles say ""risks low,"" little actually spell quantify risks.

I think really important parents idea risks COVID poses children make choices right family, I've research recently give better idea ""how much risk COVID pose, exactly?"". expert -- welcome comments -- thought may helpful parents navigate worrisome time. (sorry, too, seen -- I've reposted threads talk kids COVID think important idea risks, feel lots articles posted really topic justice):

**Mortality Risks:** Obviously, there's extremely fine line walk here: every death child horrendously tragic, cannot imagine parent child died hospitalized. good news parents, however, mortality risks still remain low. [Out 74,000,000 kids U.S., 519 died COVID since crisis (as July 28). works mortality rate 0.0007%, 0.015% amongst confirmed cases COVID. (To put context, [overall mortality rates lower childhood mortality auto Again, immensely tragic -- simply put, child die -- parent, I'd probably worried prospects long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below).

**Risks Delta:** Delta new, still much know. However, data U.K (where Delta hit time now) gives us clues. Let's start good news: [based data U.K., kids remain least impacted age group long Despite access vaccines, kids age 5-14 still far lowest hospitalization rates demographic (this past week, 1.08/100,000; kids age 0-4 noticeably higher rates -- 3.12/100k -- though still lower age group). Similarly, chance child would hospitalized confirmed case COVID similar prior waves, maybe even little bit lower.T

he bad news? Well, kids going get Delta account transmissible, particularly areas schools taking precautions. fact we're already seeing big increases hospitalizations amongst kids bad, say least, important note already occurring indications cases nationally peaking 

**Risks Long COVID/The Disease Course Generally:** still lots learn long COVID, Delta new enough current studies really address it. COVID generally, however, earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged third!). suffered immense methodological weaknesses, low sample sizes, parental-reported symptoms, probable selection bias, control groups.

More recent research (which perfect still includes many weaknesses, least somewhat better) suggested much lower rates first studies, albeit risks real. sampling recent work include:

* [In self-reported survey UK, 95% infected kids symptoms lasting longer four [and 98% symptoms 56 (if I'm understanding study correctly, analyzed kids symptomatic COVID, would lower rates infections).
* [In survey UK people COVID, estimated 7.4% children aged 2-11 reported symptoms 12 weeks (this study included control group, albeit matched age/gender)
* [In one study control group, researchers found kids infected COVID Zurich actually likely report symptoms long-COVID kids clear: study imply long-Covid occur. However, true, suggests actual prevalence long-COVID kids likely quite low. (This definitely encouraging study found).

So, what's average course illness children (again, caveat research pre-Delta)? First off, seems \~50% children totally asymptomatic. Lancet study (first bullet point) cites source suggesting 43-68% cases asymptomatic. symptoms, one study found median symptom duration 6 days, common symptoms headache fatigue.

Three final notes:

First, need careful discussing long-COVID differentiate symptoms unfortunate manageable (and resolve time), symptoms debilitating. Unfortunately, understanding, current research really addressed adequately. One problem lots discussion long-COVID sub folks often take reported percentage symptoms endpoint study say, ""Woah, \[X\]% permanent disability!"" ... that's really study says. Lancet study least (first bullet point), common symptoms lasted children lasting symptoms 1) fatigue, 2) loss smell, 3) (to lesser degree) headaches. really resolve question -- depending levels fatigue, example, certainly debilitating -- think something really lose sight discussing long-COVID.

Second: I've seen concerns organ damage like. really seen great studies focusing children (I well may missed some, take gospel). Moreover, studies I've run across adults, there's lots jargon always clear medical implications certain findings are. Thus, really focused -- might exist, expertise really want misinterpret findings.

Third, risks -- even quantified -- hard interpret, people probably different reactions numbers. Let's say Lancet study (showing 1.8% children symptomatic COVID symptoms lasting days) correct. one hand -- child catches COVID -- means he/she extremely unlikely symptoms last long. One hand -- still means lots kids raw numbers symptoms last long time.

**Takeaways:** Building last point: people look data likely come different conclusions. me, look feel somewhat reassured -- there's zero risk (there's definitely not) death child COVID absolute tragedy, data speaks somewhat lower risks impression I'd likely get spent whole day sub. again, I'm also parent. Others may look data (particularly long-COVID studies) still reasonably feel worried.

**In event -- know I'm preaching choir -- important thing protect kids around get vaccinated. happen parent children age 12 who's fence, please get vaccinated, too. It'll protect child truly nasty disease help lower risk around child, too.** ""it's risk hospital collapse"" news sources saying Florida Louisiana collapse within week. preprint Mayo Yes beginning year, October percentage? December? Even town long time hold sending kids back, remote learning essentially March 1. Susceptibility infection yes.

The current consensus changing say may longer achievable.  Leave Iran problems math. 1440 minutes day would need average 720 deaths day hit every 2 minutes. night lights went Georgia see covid vaccines.

Without vaccines, get either mild disease, medium disease terrible disease. any.

With vaccines, get either mild disease medium disease, chance terrible disease dramatically reduced. Jesus, looks bleak really makes feel hopeless. point people stop putting blame politicians start holding fellow neighbors accountable? anything help prevent spread, no. force everyone go act irresponsible, deny getting vaccinated, force kids public schools, no. 

At point need realize big-government acting interest science people's health. end day, putting food families table, trying lose keeping voters happy.

Around is. take pics next time go want proof.  Children least-tested demographic helps. don’t know yet. balance, seems getting Covid orders magnitude worse.

Seeing collapse excuse go shooting democrats one biggest christian fantasies....

Should make difference Correct. many kids hospitalized died that? seriously comparing common cold flu?  “yes” questionable EVER consensus. pretty strong evidence given past attempts vaccinate corona viruses, pipe dream we'd ever see success say polio vaccine.

Vaccinate risk symptoms minimal require hospitalization (or least long periods hospitalization). vaccinate others willing receive it. Remove mandates proceed normal.  Yeah that's absolutely true. vaccine works like vaccines, teaching immune system react encounters specific intruder. difference traditional vaccines mRNA vaccines traditional ones immune system learns react whole virus (which means virus mutates vaccine work anymore), mRNA vaccines immune system learns react one specific aspect virus (which makes also-ran effective mutations retain said aspect). Hospitalizations deaths especially shouldn’t worse.

Hospitalizations worse Florida now. happily deaths not. lol, k always going breakthrough cases, even alpha. Even 90+ efficacy rate, hundreds hundreds millions doses, 5-10 percent people would still get cases. That's lot. Delta increasing that. But, vaccine still keeping cases almost universally mild people hospital case occur. That's amazing thing cause celebration. still cautious vaccinated, yes, story still needs around unvaccinated they're still catching transmitting substantially higher rates breakthrough cases vaccinated.

Also, vaccinated people still get spread virus animals including house pets. Maoism :P We're coming 2 years hearing, ""It's flu."" fucking sick hearing that? Sure, evolved since Jan 2020, still damn thing. 

COVID flu cold. want it. want take risk long hauler paying hospital bills. 

Sure, probably okay vaccinated. Probably okay wear seat belt either.  2nd dose already, please reply symptoms got it. Getting 2nd one tomorrow, friend mine fine day, got nausea vertigo. I'm gonna stock groceries tomorrow, get bucket ready shit. curious symptoms. understanding vaccines target spike protein protein gives high infectivity, limited amount mutation occur region thus vaccines remain relatively effective. Maybe I’m wrong. There’s reason people smarter CDC ones making recommendations *shrug* Yeah. one spike, curve trending upward instead downward.  people pay attention direction curve, go way look it. disagree. I'm anxious children ages 2-7 older two set start school two weeks. healthcare system can't handle everyone catching virus short period time. Masks, social distancing quarantining generally worked, goal keeping hospitals overwhelmed people dying streets (see: India). goals things never eradicate SARS-CoV-2, build exposure across populations slowly enough manage ~6 million people end needing hopsitalized care US. You’re wrong lot people delta still hadn’t gotten Covid first place. they’re getting it. couple vaccinated people, help prevent reduce future waves?

Even Hawaii seeing tons cases despite severe restrictions country Absolutely. breakthrough cases need acknowledged remain safe, even vaccinated, changing narrative something hesitant use reasoning getting vaccine, ie well I'm going catch anyways. Even alpha, 90+ efficacy rate, going lot breakthrough cases. Yes, Delta increasing numbers, vaccine still very, effective set do. always going happen, we're acting like surprise beyond me. get antibodies vaccine. 

Just Google ""antibodies covid vaccine"" get countless articles. Yes, one thing absolutely critical politician, forehead ends scalp begins. don’t really know that. studies done AZ + Pfizer. J&amp;J difference AZ. Ah, CPA sister ensures don’t buy illegal animal products. Weird. recently read article guy finally decided get vaccinated getting Covid second time. Yeah prices ridiculous UK. 


Word warning rapid tests. got girlfriend rapid test travel US earlier year; flying via Germany required PCR even transit (2hrs Frankfurt, didn’t leave airport) get PCR Heathrow last minute. careful flying via anywhere else! happening Texas? 54% vaccination rate.. states still 40%. 

My state second last rapidly filling also extreme (yet).  people continue selfish get vaccinated get tested regularly. don’t know would go far say testing free, public health matter rest us. 

I’m talking people choose get vaccinated. people real medical complications make impossible get vaccinated. Kids immunocompromised don’t choice. without choice need protected. regret either. I'm high risk anything. I'm saying circumstances changed since April, would nice get greater level protection could. safe, appears be. Pretty selfish hundreds millions around world still can't get first dose. pandemic revealed lot ugly behavior. “2 weeks stop spread” work it’s possible vaccinate everyone even vaccine mandates? get numbers sure we’ll never get 100%

That’s combination vaccines natural immunity, get point (hopefully sooner later) Yep, surprised found out. plenty people get mild symptoms continue on. mild also includes people sick didn’t require hospitalization. Ya thinking antibodies immune response. far understand get antibodies Vaccine getting vaccinated != believing virus. 
Problem is, think antivaxxers homogenous group people. 
And every person doesnt get vaccinated anti-vaccines. 
The head parliament (Wolfgang Kubicki) vaccinated, mandatory vaccinations. wishes people get shot, doesnt want force them. 
He believes, every person right go way (which concreted constitution). Every person choose take risk get sick. dont want get sick? Get vaccinated. care? care. 
If get sick fault. 

And acceptable approach this. alcohol, tobacco, fastfood. choose eat that, government keeps that. Millions people die early, choice so. linked article:
 data submitted peer-reviewed journal publication, said.
 
A pharmaceutical company make claim likes. peer reviewed data published, much 
of leg stand on.
 
ETA additional quote one articles:
 data, **involved tests 23 people, yet peer-reviewed clear boosted antibody levels actually correlate better protection, extra protection even needed.** US Centers Disease Control Prevention says current vaccines protect people well common variants. thats way guess mostly manage silly pretend inconsequential Prior covid impression hippies antivax. RFK etc. rare really pay attention them. Uhh, live? case Nashville.  People gotten vaccinated gotten much milder symptoms recovered quicker people get vaccinated. tons stories dying people saying ""I gotten vaccinated"" think also show sister. think two topics discussed believe data, can't help her. good news? need variant less severe symptoms low chance long covid vaccine. Delta endemic isn’t acceptable endgame. Oh man. supposed go wedding Maui end September. booked January figured would safe. looking good. Trump acted way would probably still President. That's thing. surprised this? Even alpha, original efficacy hundreds millions vaccinated still going mean ton breakthrough cases. mean vaccines work amazingly effective. careful, need take precautions, still pretty damn safe vaccinated. It's... door fountain. 

And yes! Great point minorities disproportionately affected. reasonably hesitant centuries mistreatment system, spending outreach education communities. Ultimately, still public safety issue, racism not. ""Unaware shipment"". Glad see he's top things.  people buy fake vaccine results. See also: George W ""hey C students, president"" Bush. Everyone cares run red light even it’s body, car, decision. 

Everyone cares smoke restaurant…

Could go on. Sore arm (dull ache, felt like I'd strained muscle working out) kinda blah/sleepy feeling half day. get great night's sleep. it. Holy hell, maybe dad finally pay attention. loves Reba."
