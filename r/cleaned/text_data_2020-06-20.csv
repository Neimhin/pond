I'm glad hear responsible, despite Stay safe well... whether like ride together.

[Even cases extreme deficiency, there's much benefit injections daily oral I'm sorry feel way then. : / fact numerous medias China already started cover mysterious pneumonia outbreak middle December.

That tells story. Mass protests along factors seem leading us second wave. protesting is?

I fully support BLM, btw. Sometimes stupid. talk back... learning big words I'm proud üë∂ personally think opening stop PEI NB. Intermaritime travel makes sense first step.

I think mask situation really unfortunate. Unlike US wasn‚Äôt really politicized here, messaging unclear federal government lot damage lying lack effectiveness early on.

There positives though. Everywhere rural area live plexiglass up, store capacity managed, dedicated entrances exits everywhere allows it, sanitation really made priority.

It‚Äôs also nice local breweries stepped early hand sanitizer. Thanks there‚Äôs never lack it. good normal stuff? don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs better nothing.

I think we‚Äôve done quite well overall province fair amount fo faith could handle mitigate second wave, arrive. becomes texture thing. pay attention feel things time associate feeling flavor. sweetness come back first feel back mouth. almost like salivating, bit slippery... make sense?

Well depressing. :-( Unfortunately bring zero data percentage severity complications.

Anecdotal evidence great getting views, useless decision making risk assessment. I've following posts since thing started look forward seeing time. Please spend time someone IRL, monster needing it. Spinning saying masks prevent virus spreading, followed saying someone shouldn‚Äôt go public symptoms. many sanctimonious people preaching masks, say ‚ÄúWell they‚Äôre perfect‚Äù. preaching everyone saved wearing mask. CHP also full selfish, mask hating authoritarians. Yes, private hospital differ quality care lot.

My wife lives Kenya there, mom got deathly sick. took regular hospital, diagnosed gastric ulcer, gave anti-acids powerful pain killers. 

When heard, immediately paid MRI done (only $100), found large gallstones necrotic gall bladder. Surgery free public hospital got diagnosis, doctor admitted would dead days without intervention. Said afford run tests everyone.

I noticed ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt die sleep Covid fake news!‚Äù - Orange Mutant Senile Turtle supporter.

Edit: thanks automod... Nobody going wear mask you‚Äôll belittled it‚Äôs necessarily fizzling NYC. it‚Äôs contained moment since lot still shutdown generally sufficient mitigation. still 29k active cases 5700 confirmed last 2 weeks understand difference ""slow"" ""stop""? chest burning

My friend said got pneumonia 2 weeks ago, said pains bad chest crying. he...did Corona? American here. would weep country wasn‚Äôt damn angry. much stupidity. Lord help us all. Oof Trumps wearing mask either. original French study horrible. since read paper numbers may couple, memory:


There 25 people taking drug 13 (random fluctuations large impact small samples). two groups treated different sites different doctors (no consistency). Patients doctors knew drug (so could consiously unconsciously bias results). defined assesment protocol. One (I think lead) authors also editor journal published study. perhaps damningly, 4 people taking drug dropped trial conditions got much worse put ICU, one died - people ignored assessing well drug performed. now, need fussy.  better way put selfishness, greed, cruelty. Recent study showed like 17% chance catching within X distance X amount time someone contagious. drops 3% mask. Seems like work me.  Weeks? get that? charts see say 3 7 day lag. listen anything fuckwit says? Misleading headline.

People still visit small places. even small place would still impact. don‚Äôt live 1620. got flu (at least think flu) late January month later still issues taking meds deal it.

That cause myriad issues. Yes, order usefulness N95 Surgical/medical cloth + filter cloth itself

Try get N95 medical mask possible, use cloth masks + filter get those. Use normal cloth covering else fails. Trump 2020! Keep America Great! Trump‚Äôs failure leadership due self-serving priorities

I definitely agree. Trump is, think, soley focused re-election extent focus seems anything else it‚Äôs probably it‚Äôs related re-election. Finally, haven‚Äôt seen remarkable WH presser Trump floats injecting/ingesting sanitizer somehow treating insides UV light, gotta see yourself. 

Oh yes. I‚Äôve seen it. Trump perhaps worse communicator I‚Äôve ever seen. don‚Äôt necessarily judge wacky ideas long defers decisions people know they‚Äôre seems like obvious speculation private. . Cloth masks weren‚Äôt something CDC prepared offer guidance on

Yeah sure. Initially bad guidance masks media gave pause consider whether masks good bad. also fell line thought bad cold changed opinion became aware data. Still early telling people CDC speaks perspective policy public health. aren‚Äôt thinking us individually, individual protection responsibility. far public policy going conservative appreciate long comes good faith attempt give accurate information. 

Fundamentally agree rant. trying scare public reason? seen experts trying warn public, politicians downplaying pandemic. initial claim ""second wave"" ENTIRELY DUE PROTESTS, NOTHING ELSE.

**PROTESTS** \- **100% increase** cases across many states constitutes people calling second wave.

**EVERYTHING ELSE** (stuff reopening, social gatherings, reduced social distancing) - **0% increase**

You provided evidence yet support strong claim. provide evidence retract admit, think second wave would rise quickly. Millions people protesting lead harmful effects. true, curious activities done safely wondering. Outdoor activities alone one think of. ""We make laws, enforce them.""

""We enforcing law disagree it.""

So it? recovered all? 112? light breeze standards. good way show well understand something explaining ways even laymen understand good source time calculate yourself? Dear Florida, 

Your governor idiot. That's why. Deaths lag several weeks, hospitalization case numbers spiking, yet deaths plateaued Wearing mask good makes better most. It‚Äôs unnecessary partying, protesting, others really get me. certainly part staying home. (They literally say there's evidence) Well aren‚Äôt optimistic. Honestly, think might 250K people start caring reality probably 500K 1M. also depends areas see NYC death levels too. know tell someone vegan? Don‚Äôt worry they‚Äôll let know. much FUD, IFR 0.4% less.

[Daily ass. Death cult mean, it‚Äôs horrible people would rather blame everyone else still feeling guilt.

Yikes! Well that‚Äôs stupid fucking plan Lurked Sweden subreddit bit used google translate read corona megathread posts. weeks ago Sweden's strategy still popular anyone questioned massively downvoted. fair, every country waged successful campaign virus used enormous amount testing contact tracing it. That's literally cheapest, fastest, effective way end thing. ask got information? actually straight-up argument older sister gave me. said we‚Äôre already worst it, anyone risk would already died now, reopen. wish could make up. sounds great, dinner get herd immunity better. people cheered.  practically false positives, false negatives.

I'm sure that. [concerns false positive especially early tests whose specificity could low 83%. seems like multiple tests various sources used place I'm sure easy pin specific numbers specific area. I'm really sure point confident testing results. 

Having said that, doubt false negatives far common far cases current counts would suggest especially we've seen much evidence efforts suppress accurate counts order hide extent spread. That's political doofuses. INB4 lock **purely political comments**. Lmao fuck off. president literally admitted asking testing slowed. Turns covid political. least one party... that's important everyone votes biden Diamondbacks 2021 Yep. seems like South Bay thinks Covid over.

Same people also damn nothing they're drowning entire life burning ash. there's I'm saying likely. honestly know. HIV around. stopped that. 

I'm sure 6 months that, people thinking 3 years? Gtfo!... yet are. watched clip seemed like making joke, testing good results show high case count. almost wanted less testing unforeseen results

(An awful joke, clearly) understand get cause easier talk Florida size Italy gets kind silly talk US generalize statements, goes country size guess normal. tell think, however indoor event zero masks SPONSORED LEADER COUNTRY vs outdoor events least masks different. 


Not exposure worse rally, continues hammer home dangerous message top undermines efforts stop spread spits face people mention. flu, folks. flu, folks. Precautionary principle work. Maybe chance surface spread low, that's established fact yet. Better cautious wrong, alternative. Come dude, even bubonic plague didn‚Äôt cause continuous pandemics, always died years came back century two later. Scandinavian policies like giving birth boy loving entire body.

Unlike US cuts boys penises reason, end buying lubrication taking erectile dysfunction pills first 2 take anti depressants lol. Ladies gentlemen, POTUS

Psychopath United States overall US numbers greatly influenced NYC, look city, county, state data outside NY looks much worse . Completely agree you, would also like point numerous times comment section headline circle jerk one read story whoever posted (including original site headline) extrapolated meaning somewhat misleading.

But, yeah, often fuckstick literally said one dumbest things ever heard. They'll back Cali Arizona soon, bit poorer. Might take customer facing job make ends meet.

The virus approves. Honestly, won‚Äôt long cases go again.. went back work week ago (retail) mall packed (Christmas levels) almost zero social distancing, 65/35 mask usage, masks worn properly, want say 60% nose out, 30% top lip nose out, 10% mask cover nose mouth. That‚Äôs observation generally looking mall, see store, also looking social media, majority people know things socially.. live Metro Detroit area way. exact questions. ‚ÄúFollowing remarkable insight ... let‚Äôs rally‚Äù Please don‚Äôt one them

Definitely plan it. appreciate sacrifice would rather applaud distance cared close. :)

With said, I've experienced careless reckless behavior. week three delivery people masks approached door nothing wrong. becoming increasingly difficult stay safe distance. :(

Anyways, stay safe please try get rest. know exhausting. :( Trump literally making supporters toxic. mean, pretty toxic before, they‚Äôre bioweapons.   straw üòÇ know wanted win again... job. saying. suppose. thing guess politicians think little us get someone popular something people it.

CDC‚Äôs lab contaminated kits. can‚Äôt make shit up. mean new abnormal. I'm slightly comforted crowd confused cheering moment... Fleeting understatement. honestly know that. 30,000+ cases yet numbers deaths falling. Something add up. ask virus directly slow mean clearly joking. think POTUS joking 120k dead around 700 die everyday end sight, warrants condemnation. generally making entire thing reelection odds. There's truth conspiracy testing, though. people get circle jerk politics. Talking government response seems fine experience, becomes political debate topic that's seems rule applies. Profoundly stupid immoral. Well, maybe director CDC lied Americans masks start? public health well? Maybe make sure healthy workers got protection first still awful way decide risk? can‚Äôt remember country (want say either south Korea Japan) pop star sing song make dance wash hands super popular effective way making hand washing ‚Äúcool‚Äù. works works, celebrities role models people good use success help people. mean old people seem dying that‚Äôs gen Z doesn‚Äôt care. living grey age, everything constructed ideal every ideal fought over. shame people see way. twitter absolutely filled hate. perfect?

What fuck wrong (needed protests - BLM anti-mask ones), concert Cedar....and people giving fuck...I think we're beyond saving now. Mark words -- july 4th (give take 5 days) we'll lucky dip 1k/day new cases (for long while).

Makes wonder 90% posts subreddit media negative stories. Funny Trump rally ""case study super spreaders"", BLM protest fine. Look, people stay home stop thinking politics protect corona virus. rally probably anymore dangerous gatherings, gathering right now. Ha! lot tears eyes tonight.

Lol what? least body bags... you‚Äôre still concerned, aren‚Äôt upset protests?

Unless there's vaccine soon something first. confine 100% undetermined amount time.

That's true all. Everyone get flu every year cold every year, take far less precautions far prevalent. Even hardest hit state low single digit penetration, notion ahat ""everyone get this"" utterly unfounded verge insane. CDC never said ""everyone get this"", babbling idiot. Holy shit, didnt know possible trashy. true States everywhere. live India, I'm 20 friends partying everyday ""young people die"". summer? winter Brazil now. LOL, truth! Recoveries massively bloated. I'm Haryana Health ministry ordered release anyone asymptomatic shown symptoms 2 days asked self quarantine. knows cooperating? Yeah, sadly probably right.

Holy fuck sub miserable. It‚Äôs virus, there‚Äôs gonna vaccine anytime soon. R u gonna waste ur life? Go outside you‚Äôll either get later works infrastructure collapses. think coronavirus blown proportion? Sometimes feel everything shut places high concentrations like New York. [Fauci: public told wear masks coronavirus pandemic began:The infectious disease expert also discussed know Fauci admitted lied masks make sure government could buy many could.

This gave big breach trust assured people relied protect loved ones type mask.

[Why need clinical trial hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, zinc news using hydroxychloroquine zinc came recent study Grossman School Medicine New sulfate increased frequency patients discharged home, decreased need ventilation, admission ICU, mortality transfer hospice patients never admitted ICU.¬†¬†After adjusting time zinc sulfate added protocol, increased frequency discharged home (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.09) reduction mortality transfer hospice remained significant (OR 0.449, 95% CI 0.271-0.744).¬†¬†Conclusion: study provides first vivo evidence zinc sulfate combination hydroxychloroquine may play role therapeutic management COVID-19.


So, clear recap

Fauci fraud purposefully lied American public basic safety precautions telling everyone need mask months (fucking top proponents keep moving goalposts, chloroquine work hydroxychloroquine does, take zinc effective, last heard take zinc zpack (wat) effective.

That simply true I've shown New York study saying saw improvement treatment actual data. moving goalposts. No""junk science"" eloquently put it. hard data study.

Damn, think maybe astroturfing around pushing actually pushing narrative there's merit hydroxychloroquine zinc treatment showing merit. it‚Äôs idiot. even know word means? country protect vulnerable? Thanks, UK then. economy gone shit.

Hey dude, free country. remain ignorant want. Feel free stick head ass avoid reality. problem. I'd estimate that, minimal moderate mitigation measures people actually following, number new cases double roughly every week every week; maybe 10 11 days doubling. people start mitigate bit see rates increasing. 

There bunch idiots always call hoax nothing, essentially freeload everyone else's efforts cautions.

Online schooling efficient. time wasted from, cost police, clean, cool, heat maintain school property.

Any remaining funds tax reduction, improved community events put technology fund provide better tech home. Except one supported Trump point form logic. can't made 3 half years without realizing he's worst person possible. 

But already proven rig election suffer consequences. doubt second win, congress gave green light interfere rig election. Shit man, I'm everything old bones can. Fuck 2020. Sweden. Okay, watched whole thing... said joke. ( note voting ) man human telling joke... albeit joke carries weight... lot dead weight sort constitutional right rise type oppression? 15,000? That's getting awfully close American numbers (20,000 daily). trends continue, India seeing infection rates pass America, severe consequences people sicken. Hopefully, India stop things getting bad America. I'm probably minority already adult 9/11 happened. ""new normal"" emerged ir air travel became lot unpleasant people became happy sactifice civil liberties told safety.

It's looking like thing happen Covid-19. Unfortunately. They'd fit right Pentecostal Church then, case... unbelievable man stupid voted office. really shows much stupider voters are. context feels results exaggerated. ""Some kid sniffles, CORONA CORONA! He'll better 15 minutes"". course would require test results forged, he's stranger conspiracies. idiot lmao Use 2A ban people coming event. want hundreds thousands deaths. opened find heat map. Dammit meant like ...it‚Äôs possible make safe. Arizona lacking all. Mostly aren‚Äôt taking seriously start Remember couple months ago people saying gonna try get get with? Yikes. I'm really happy much worry terms spread rally last night, since hardly anyone showed up. rest easy knowing rally probably little negative impact, people there. 

It nice see inside stadium national TV though, almost recognize since I'm used seeing many empty seats. What‚Äôs source that? media - had, guess - responsibility convey seriousness Covid American public. decent job while. protests happened, media cared supporting consistency. media ignored Covid threat posed protests, destroyed credibility eyes many Americans.

The media put question heads millions: ""Surely Covid can't bad, then, since protests apparently okay?"" many people stopped caring much lockdown restrictions. parks, even cities, enough space spread out, parents already taught kids avoid strangers even pandemic started. crazy people feature, bug  can't figure way wet paper bag Ok, kid. 

1. Top 10 European University, top 3 Asian university, M.Sc. (maybe PhD? knows). Throw Google, Harvard, McKinsey CV. you, LMU, Goethe, maybe even RWTH? honestly, probably shitty second tier degree even impress anyone within Germany. Come on, kid, get me. tutored statistics ate kids like breakfast. 

2. IFR CFR converge. talking end epidemic (final numbers), ideally, numbers identical. However, numbers end different, still hardpressed give valuable numerical estimate IFR valuable estimate IFR. testing, IFR becomes CFR. 

3. pretending school anything, maybe reconsider way talk CFRs ongoing diseases. 

4. I'll need charge lessons work time. Article still German (?). Thank information. suggesting cautiously optimistic we're hearing much reason concerned, right? serve local government liberal small town Mid Atlantic state seeing downward trend. General compliance mask wearing pretty strict. allowed begin outdoor dining weeks ago. Main Street bunch restaurants sidewalk tables. Well sidewalks deep enough allow pedestrians pass diners six feet space. member local govt feels problem. recommended options allow restaurants space outdoor dining order free sidewalks. they're setting tables street parking lots sidestreets removing sidewalk tables. walking street unmasked diners either side you, within 2-3 feet. Everyone thinks helping restaurants important public safety residents. I've even heard employees anecdotally takeout business slowed since outdoor dining began, since people feel comfortable walking sidewalks. 

My question is, overly cautious? enforcing state guidelines continue looking way?
Any studies articles supporting either side welcome. 
Thanks! Vaccine testing always starts animal subjects. Give em time instead kneejerk doubting development. dead serious Mortality rate super low. That's media trying focus new infections hide fact virus deadly initially tried make appear. That's called fear mongering Public mask use different mask use operating room. Surgeons operate they're contageous same.

Aren't curious evidence confirming suspicion? studied results able confirm masks' efficacy. can't admit wrong? Wow spicy take early morning. gay bars already uphill climb 2020. fuckfuck... tineline.. cant skip type masks people asked wear protect wearer?  impression protect others wearer.  

Surgeons wear masks avoid infecting patient, avoid getting infected patient operating on.  Likewise gloves. again, dont know anywhere else used America.

Surgeries life threatening things exist, sure. table needed. elective, scheduled.

Elective label made insurance companies avoid paying. wow edgy get point, kinda hard can't afford food part. Sadly seems COVID leads cognitive problems.

Perhaps GOP think make people vote GOP people believe ruling party army people flooding internet downvote anything ruling party government general.

It make sense though post critical India never reaches homepage post praising India reached 20k+ upvotes mere hours.

Clearly looks like manipulation me. deceased family.. specialy could avoided Timely yes,proactive no.It's easy press flush toilet(or case lockdown button),but Modi done time equivalent leaving shit-stains toilet others clean. It‚Äôs like piece equipment like ventilator hard wired wall.

They need unplugged wall patient moved example. unit rechargeable battery inside lasts short facilitate moves. Yep, dumb. Typed bed. event Labor Day weekend. Nah quite sadly think ship sailed people largely made decision. Listen fuckfuck... blm isnr lives matter..

So stfu statistics 17 year old died causes could prevented Apparently latest stufies says bound peak November now.Go figure. Professional sports (which include college football basketball) garbage. Hopefully never come back. like grandparents üôÑ continued uptick new cases, number deaths likely double month. wouldnt surprised see triple end July. explain ANYTHING HURTFUL POST MOVING INFANT DIDNT APPEAR FEBRUARY AGENDA MAKE PEOPLE UNSAFE? would credentials references???? No.. isnt question you.. rethorical help people literally wishing India fail. should. Also individuals disregard medical advise endanger others, unless socialist thinks state nanny like China. you? land free brave kneel colectivist madness. top 1% wants keep 99% dumb poor. keep seeing memes this, big deal? running multiple errands easier taking putting back bunch times, wearing day work easy forget take off. *shrug* Persephone Lol. There‚Äôs apartment building neighborhood called Anchor Bay Club. call Anchor Baby Club. That's fine though. means many family members die mostly deserve it.

No biggie. Sucks suck happens times. would suggest live consider couple past presidencies state bungled may affected family members dying now, understand that's bit far road now. Science almost never certain predictions prove right wrong long run. gifted people understand that.  crime Bronx Brooklyn. gay bars lower Manhattan. hung Masks mitigation measure absolutely cannot avoid around people.

They replace *avoiding* situations much possible. Let's put pieces together then. sources thus sub I'd say:
Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina sure list. Possibly southern states? Pole. Travel risky, stay Poland pandemic over. Ah yes r/chodi supposedly secular free-for-all 'meme' sub-reddit loves circle-jerking Modi/BJP,pro-Hindu posts bashing everything else(including hate-boner r/India). So? everyone can. Normally medicaid pays indigent people live nursing homes.  government set pay lower actual cost nursing homes eat loss since can't charge anyone else difference.   

Typically proportion Medicaid patients small enough loss made profit patients pay more.  already problem total mess Covid made made worse.  

I wish article facts less quotes activist organizations. India Folks provide scam callers social media person information time yet comes something urgent actual use, become experts privacy. like typical Amazon fulfillment center. attest facts happened, before. someone attest facts happen, that's faith, science. 

That's burden experts situations like one, way. help multinational institution power games played. smokers? live country people proud job :) blood starts boil phrases like ""call suspicious"", ""makes wonder"", ""am paranoid?""

You're suspicious.
No, doesn't. 
Yes. That's 0.24%. removed couple offtopic comments, trolling here. did..i much important decide would imagine someone collect data months get whole picture accused making bias data make trump look bad. Ha. 50% lower average intelligence. Yes, allergic asthma took view risk. Good them. Glad see journalists priorities It‚Äôs exactly dream job. would rather work destitute. people eating 6 burgers day without care world would never step foot inside slaughterhouse. see bars LA. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôve eradicated virus Yeah makes sense. plugs labels going forward least boating element social distancing built it, long people boat household, outdoors risk transmission low. Better boating crowding restaurants damn amusement parks (thanks reopening, Dollywood! ugh) Yes allergic asthma havent seen february flu still kills tens thousands people year even though vaccines yes mutates wildly (and still lethal) (That one year (there two years 70K people dead recently) around 75K people died U.S effective vaccine people). 

The problem assuming we're going permanently close borders everyone around world. virus world meaning even America contains (it ) virus still circulating poorer countries still. That's virus evolutionary pressure change; SUPER effective already infecting people killing comes many days weeks infected.

Many people realize virus always CERTAIN level mortality regardless much mutates (unless mutates much new different virus happens) still certain core structure behavior associated it. black death, bacteria infection (bubonic plague)is still actually \*HERE\* even modern medicine fatality rate around 10% caught early. HIV also virus mutates HEAVILY still 100% fatal never treated. Why? even though HIV mutates; behavior core functionality virus still destroys immune system. People think eventually become cold Corona behave like cold viruses. look symptoms causing people. tell structural behavior cold. Yeah first thought occurred. blood clots stroke immediate physical fear had. seems cause vasculitis, burning shooting pain veins. also seems attack scars old injuries inflammation. chest scar heart bypass seems mostly numb, able feel little irritation. little scar left knee, stripped artery heart bypass leg general however, torment. Sugar alcohol make symptoms worse try keep healthy lean proteins, high fiber, healthy fats. heart patient health freak mostly eat way anyway, everyone does.

What's likelyhood scientific paper retracted general? mean people like pollen allergy (hopefully translated correctly) allowed go out? There's still many cases contact tracing nothing. assume everywhere. I‚Äôm hoping vulnerable people self-isolating effectively care homes things right. Perhaps doctors also optimizing care better experience virus. may miracle drug could still getting better recognizing bad cases treating sooner better. also, apparently, big increase pneumonia cases probably counted aren‚Äôt. Plus, deaths tend lag new cases couple weeks. initial peak cases around April 11 peak deaths around April 21. may see deaths starting rise next days. almost china's population eastern third, area India  40% absolute morons Don‚Äôt even bother replying types. want reactions goes nowhere.

Almost Workers German meat factorys eastern Europe,yet still treated horribly , nothing skin color.Its people dickheads  American legislators allow corporations pick every butt hair looking information market point one answers phone more, wonder can't get cooperation constituents actually matters. Dude need stop paranoid, literally started wondering nose ring could transmit covid19 ‚ÄúProbably‚Äù thing needed hear. +2592 cases Arizona 14.76 percent positive rate. improvement? blood I'm curious unmasked diners within two feet either side increase risk.

to who? themselves? (nobody forced go out).

to passers by? negligible. forget.. one factors *time.*

how long within diner's 6ft ""bubble"" walking by? gone bananas? They're really dole'ing out. bunch fruitcakes. living country? Can't relate go saying honestly situations one thinks ""this kind"" say loud. one them. sub reddit general much american dominated that. look sub many USA flairs first page Lmaooo keep shed outback also? use whips beat you? Stop disrespecting actuall slaves dumbfucks. saw commercial day kept using phrase ‚Äù...all benefits copper!‚Äù without specifically listing ‚Äùbenefits‚Äù. seems wrong. UK ~1k cases/day. They're perfectly correct, equate rising cases/day US accurate. got least 2 new cases. You‚Äôre hero people. 

Sometimes companies scum, sometimes intermediaries are, sometimes both. century *The Jungle* written, still unions prevent kind horror. US based divide conquer. Back Jan/Feb sub talking US hardest hit BS here. wrong. No?

Since ""don't touch that"" work children? learn personal experience. adults old children. Approx 56 Go back hole, Trump-lover. contact tracing mandatory. period. People important, already tracked anyway phone. get app good world. device tag. tag tracked. Say today went costco walking around food court. 2 days now, someone costco tested positive contact tracing shows costco time area. get alert saying crossed paths another tag. mean positive know take precautions. means, use science tech help us beat quicker. Americans would rather try herd immunity.  Hi yes I‚Äôd like happy meal please PiNeAppLE! somewhat taken elite interests pro-business (wolves) wear sheeps' clothing (using lingo/facade traditional Nordic social democracy). unless looking closely, outside/at glance everything looks like might expect Nordic social democracy scratch surface, see safety net / concern human health welfare replaced something else entirely.

This simply true, current administration center-left. center-right might funded business community opened private initiatives welfare system, still big issue ideological split Swedish politics. current foreign minister went German TV blamed death toll private elder care homes course zero evidence supporting position ~500 5000 deaths occurred private homes, there's even evidence mortality higher communal elder care homes, matter wants blame something else governments strategy. 
 slams Swedish culture almost religious like faith authorities, many Swedes cannot even begin countenance authorities might betray questioning forbidden strictly punished immediate often forceful social sanction, corrupt elites free please little pushback populace.

This however 100% true. government simply deferred experts, unfortunately ""experts"" Tegnell Giesecke created fantasy world virus basically harmless (~0,1% IFR) extremely contagious. That's Tegnell last months making numbers soon reach herd immunity Stockholm simply discarded evidence contrary, like Spanish study 60 000 participants. Tegnell simply said one can't compare data different countries, virus cares national borders reason, guy thinks closing borders stop virus there's risk going plane since confirmed cases airplanes Europe. Yes, real statements made chief epidemiologist. Baby boomers currently 56-74 years old. they're halfway retirement. I'm terrified going get ugly 5-10 years retirement savings start run out. mah havent, dont care anymore made account contrarian? Trumpsters inclined play Pandemic Games, leave be. Denmark 6 weeks slow reopening - actually tomorrow another step, work place back full staff first time since mid march.

Masks never caught here, friday tested 12.850 (47 positive) people. That's positive rate 0,3%.

Contrast Florida, saw 17.33% daily positive rate Friday. also neigbours, Sweden, never adopting lockdown - currently experiencing positive rate around 12% 1300-1500 daily new cases (but fortunately mortality hospitalization). 

So, can't really compare ""one Europe"". I'm kind surprised even bothered spending time money creating contact tracing program. Judging utter lack compliance area seems program doomed start. ""We open soon economy collapse""

""We can't rush opening, cases never go away there's vaccine""

Galactic brain: So, rush vaccine then. I‚Äôd please happy. speak soon. Ireland's rushing opening phases speak nobody made wear masks. Gatherings 50 ok indoors. Old age people allowed people homes told 2 months limit contact. 

The virus still here, there's cure there's way numbers climb next week's. around Europe. know they're making strain differences qualification second wave, characteristic case flu aides second wave event. be. company report people know they‚Äôve traveling aren‚Äôt wearing mask work. Making unsafe workplace. think spot factors probably significant, instance Poland people wearing masks public indoor spaces. What's really interesting multiple major outbreaks coal mines. much agree 100%. also weren‚Äôt 100% sure that‚Äôs virus transferred moment time. wonder Covid reached Sentinelese people. even un-reached. Covid would wipe out. That‚Äôs great, don‚Äôt think going help cause

Look recent outbreaks SK, China, ect. Nightlife venues people get drunk close talk favourable resurgence virus right now. wouldn‚Äôt call stupid. Maybe myopic. stupid. would highly unlikely people anything low risk. Simply walking someone outside would hard get infected, think it. able get way we‚Äôd wayyyy infections do. Competence would stopping travel‚Äîwhich Fauci opposed. Haven‚Äôt seen single person wearing one live Isnt delivery takeout though? It‚Äôs true safe food handling eliminate risk catching uncooked food, working large grocery market warehouse they‚Äôre working speed efficiency. takes one guy touching face contaminated hand, touching things without gloves forgot touched dirty hands, wearing mask eye guard properly. Cause y'all morons. pleases know y'all date latest teckneeks inconvenient truth alarmists Except president country un-wavering adulation anti-scientific masses. taken seriously, put mask, hammering caution, would different outcome. I'm sitting sidewalk eating walks breathing normally I'd say risk incredibly low.

What risk person walking by? You‚Äôve got people sitting tables masks on, presumably talking laughing companions. They‚Äôre going aerosolized particles hanging around passerby walk through. Freedom. don‚Äôt understand. us curve looks flat. entire fucking goal started: flatten curve load hospitals stays manageable allocate resources they‚Äôre needed once. sudden moving goal posts? people cant listen lockdown another American billionaire putting profit people. Ah fuck. America becoming Rapture Bioshock? read comment that's thought ""I've seen before."" Oh definitely agree cultural. interesting way think STD side contact tracing. lot people see need give us names numbers people they've slept with, especially could ""embarrassing"" they've already treated, course make treatment conditional cooperation. Except majority new cases asymptomatic people even feel sick. feel grateful I‚Äôm introverted homebody. pandemic barely stressed lifestyle. Hard really thrive crowds travel. Phew worried. back shopping. What‚Äôs either things statement? relate well haha take care stop people elsewhere entering county. Block every road, stop anyone entering. normal life barring leaving region need isolation units violent ones non-violent ones live last years peace. sky also blue, knew? Hit em bawitabawdabangybangdiggydiggyhealthcodeviolation know people NJ taking seriously. I'm Bergen county, pretty hard hit. Back physical location work week since March. I've heard people saying hoax absolutely ridiculous. Granted that's 2 people hundred so. also wearing masks. there's another woman said local ShopRite enforcing masks anymore removed arrows instructed people aisle one way. left went Acme instead.

I know snowbirds Florida usually return New Jersey around March/April many think going trickling quarantine eased here? state pretty densely packed, I'm optimistic keep low.  know irony is?

You're capable debate others. would think could yourself? guys discussion without devolving personal attacks. Keep civil, please. inhale nose exhale mouth? 

this way still breathe i'm spreading air everywhere Supreme Court really decided ""the government cannot restrict right travel""? I've seen *state* governments cannot implement travel restrictions run afoul Interstate Commerce Clause. Federal Government *does* power interstate commerce, decision would apply Federal government.  somewhat taken elite interests pro-business

Sounds familiar... Upstate Vermont? like Adirondack Mountains Upstate New York near border Vermont. We've got beautiful lakes, ponds, rivers, mountains around every damn corner, best natural beauty east. lack population density makes easy social distance. eventually want make trip (or trips) NYC, year (and maybe next) good time playing bumpkin tourist. vaccine, guess I'll wait virus burned population mutated benign strain. Thank you. hope so, too. Yea, get it, plenty things entertain home. important make sacrifices old folks people cancer breathing problems.

But get you, keep mask times except restaurants. state already reopened anyways, right good balance. brainwashing here. benefit moving USA lol...why think millions people world apply Visas come USA...

I'm sorry hate life come REDDIT lash make fake realities prove right, like said go take medication watch relax segregate violent dementia people non-violent dementia people. deaths still trending U.S though? Yup, one factory job temp agency. foreman asked big guys slow me(first day, know station all), brain worked right(because mastered station 30 minutes job). beat dude's ass floor, escorted security. drone everyone. feel helpless. like driving roads.. thing worry drivers safety unfortunately :/ way idiots selfish behaving truly slap face rest us trying part Miami-Dade higher population density rest state, like big East Coast city. People drive cars---no subways, minimal use public transporation.  


Gov. DeSantis said increase cases among migrant workers live close quarters work site. that's sugar cane cutters fruit harvesting people? think regularly contact outside world. They're kind confined worksite.  


Is virus hospitalizing people city proper? credibility 'lol' user user name like Thank replying to. stopped interacting kind baseless, ad-hoiminem based harassment quite time ago. good someone points out. There's zero excuse staff members abusing residents.

But hard staff members totally prevent residents abusing residents. think myself, ""Who upset much refuse wear mask help keep others safe?"" whenever see people wearing masks, literally everywhere. It‚Äôs Sunday... numbers expected slightly lower days. Celebrate Virginia consistently less 100 cases like European countries (Switzerland / Austria) similar population Absolutely. cases going up, deaths going IFR seeming 1%. Since doesn‚Äôt fit apocalyptic story line, people create one minds.  comment because, basically UK effective EU countries flattening curve, thought comp chart might wrong, say ""The UK longer EU"" technically true, helps argument US's response pandemic. comes German word, *Biergarten*. Croatia same:/ disagree protesting high reward, unless mean get looting LV stores hear less important politicians impose, important people choose practice hygiene distance. least that's narrative Denmark. population chooses take care makes far biggest difference. OK, perhaps explain expected happen?

As guys often say, strategy slow rate infection hospitals overwhelmed.

Then what? expect would happen slowed rate infection, stop it? Donald Trump camp believed would magically disappear?

If ""widespread infection leading herd immunity"" expected outcome ""strategy"", it? We're going get hit 2nd wave soon, get excited. recently posted preprint r/COVID19 looked potential sewage transmission virus, [a relevant (TLDR possible SARS-CoV-2 survivability transport within rivers could impact drinking water supplies countries rivers reservoirs primary drinking water sources large populations, little sewage treatment, exist close water source, within refugee camps shanty towns.

We're seeing across board. political issue cultural one. U.S. full idiots. wait see November reelect idiot. seems can't help get last word in, huh? 

I debating writing explanation, worth time. keep trying say goodbye reason. hope annoying people person, truly. But....but.... Muh freedoms! takin muh rights 

/s Ok dr chickenman12345678 Well duh perfect system, find way take advantage system whatever system, ready get shafted. Beliefs key word here. Unfounded beliefs probably accurate insane.

How research past 30-50 years whether masks stop spread something? Seems like could experiments week even hadnt. 'Fun' thing is: country need wear masks using public transport. rare see masks public. 

I believe masks decent tool, far sufficient. CDC (RIVM) recommend use masks experts conflicted whether would effectively help control epidemic. argument gives people false sense security; working home (rigorous) social distancing important measures. latter focus.

But wear mask gov't requires you? Yes, course. dick people wearing it, even enforced. met teenagers crowded train start epidemic lady took pictures make fun them. One angrily told lady remove pictures (she did) discussed loudly dick move afterwards. lady. Chinese people use face masks. Face masks people disapprove Trump.

China developed vaccine. Vaccines people disapproves Trump.

&amp;#x200B;

... wish sarcastic, honestly surprised. I'm sorry comment, read now, rude harsh - came tough part US made out, hard places. moved US, live Europe, think lot travelling (former military). 

I imagine might somewhere Eastern Europe* Balkans, find tough places anywhere, I'm glad original country getting better. 

*Just aside, loved Eastern Europe there, strongly thinking living Romania (I loved got really well there). don't? that's basically heard tickets started getting written them, car makers started putting beeping alarms them.

""They cut shoulder."" ""They chafe."" ""It's 80 degrees sweat bunch."" ""They're made fat people."" (Literally, joke, heard someone say that)

Let's real, argument trades comfort *reducing spread pandemic.* uncomfortable used clothing there. like seat belts, wear enough get used it. true life great here, long money keeps coming in. anything ever happens you, money, life starts suck really bad really fast. friend mine went university, got post-graduate degree, living great life. However, developed Multiple Sclerosis, struggles survive relative lack assistance sick disabled people. trust say better are, despite tempting looks here. don‚Äôt answer listen someone leaves voicemail... spam callers never leave voicemails No, one supposed out. nose. Yikes... much love!

Keep safe Thank you! best hope continue see improvement!!!! terms lethality, much stronger flu. think young people flu actually deadly Covid.

BUT lot transmissible cause chronic illnesses flu. American, hope every country puts place policies limit travel United States. would hate see ignorance fellow Americans cause resurgence virus countries. DeSantis + Ducey = DD = Double Douche bags. new split. There's always split idiots non-idiots. Even coming valve exhaled air far less velocity wearing mask. means droplets can't go far. Considering we're middle summer, far outweighs fear mongering. Sure, got original post. question 9 10 states ended disproving theory, time 1/10 ended proving - really good metric theory one state maybe statistical aberration extenuating circumstances didn‚Äôt know about.

Like increases exponentially overruns hospitals 9 southern states doesn‚Äôt one, still going sit back say ‚Äúthe virus doesn‚Äôt increase exponentially don‚Äôt need lockdown down, ignore nine states look one,‚Äù logic got based way worded original post Thats europe tad smarter us understanding everybody thing working like team together helps knock things faster.

Meanwhile USA people start screaming wear mask fuck people besides family friends. Theyve trained young age nobody else matters quite literally something would flag psyhotic psych test. Nah got wrong, walnuts wrinkly. want something much smoother that, like peeled boiled egg person's schtick. Finds states changes daily numbers posts spikes daily increase. Yesterday similar post change Virginia's numbers Friday Saturday increase 100 650. 650 lowest Saturday number 2 months. today drop 100 corresponding use word plummets describe change.

We concerned testing hospitalizations picking random numbers sensationalizing one good.  Interesting people actually downvoting factual information. simply infection numbers; tf would someone downvote that? 

Damn you, reality! disapprove!

*shakes fist sky* You‚Äôre right dude. It‚Äôs easy humans, entirely social creatures, rely others rely part society, live isolation indefinite amount time. That‚Äôs something easy majority people do, can‚Äôt make minor sacrifice they‚Äôre inconsiderate assholes.

Just admit you‚Äôre privileged anti-social introvert living dream right lol. seems like trouble understanding spreader event origin animal human transmission same. get annoyed emotional intelligence. Hell, even normal intelligence could helped here. Oh shoot thought expanded Ukraine yet. working assumption China's data vastly reported also count mortality rate? Well, makes sense, since 350,000,000 people America, million contracted it. Even half citizens contracted it, might know anyone.... Duh, that's self-evident. mah freedum  Take instance Florida, Arizona Texas. states spiking states quick reopen portions economy enforcing masks social distancing. took good month started seeing surge. Also look Memorial Day weekend protests. still seeing surge would expect. People getting sick, since cases mild hear getting sick enough serious cases makes test sites/hospitals.  15 deaths today lagging indicator. even better. 

Just 664 new confirmed cases bad is, wearing wrong covering nose still better mask. take little wins ""Not bad"" equals 120k dead far. That's bad, whether look absolute terms compare per-capita death rates comparable nations.

Ultimately vaccine, effective treatments, permanent change building ventilation people interact other. Americans seem eagerly sought early infection policy. inexplicable idiotic. Yeah they're cheap comes fast. Good tool hand. Sweden didn‚Äôt admit many coronavirus patients. get keep ourselves. say fuck em, honestly. They‚Äôre 10 years old, vaccines often take much longer that, surprise don‚Äôt one yet lol.

I believe one Zika pretty far along. ""affecting less vulnerable"" mean less vulnerable primarily getting infected now, death rates spiked along new infection counts. swedish

Haha yeah guys sure suppressed Well, that‚Äôs surprise! I‚Äôm amazed get expression second dose. Penn. curve? teach one those... don‚Äôt high hopes amount layoffs already occurred long take? think main point states Germany closer counties. states US serve lot like countries EU. States US ton power. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cause we‚Äôre testing more!‚Äù Europe isn‚Äôt testing people well. Yeah I'm canada went liquor store last week... person wearing mask social distancing. People literally bragging social distancing. actually incredibly anxiety inducing, wont go back specific store obviously, seriously...  getting hit hard? Dutch aren‚Äôt wearing masks. flattened curve require public transportation.  RemindMe! 4 Weeks test many people slowly disappear Agreed. I'm Vermont pity poor bastards sweltering major cities right pity us life exciting enough. üôÇ needs criminal investigation company.

I disagree, however, far important figure exactly virus spread. statistically reliable data virus worth much. spread? spread? long spreading? meat contaminated? many people naturally immune? many got infected symptoms today? many still symptoms three weeks? bad incident is, chance make real progress towards reliable answers here.

I fear, much focus criminal investigation now, people answer questions honestly. harm caused lies could far outweigh harm investigation done thoroughly. HUGE protests Florida Texas sure Dole lung damage said things could've done. pussies

Joe Rogan thats quality website...unfortunately seem test data real time Oklahoma. ""study"" actual patient N 80

do actually think bad number preliminary research? sometimes case studies based literally one patient provide significant breakthrough disease understanding I've seen reports possibility often happen? Yeah, no. dude, there's evidence virus originated China, way around.

They silenced doctor said something wrong pneumonia deaths ( [and later died ).


They fired people. 


There huge delay reporting local authorities government ( [""Chinese media said first case viral pneumonia Wuhan reported Dec. 8, local government put official notice Dec. ), want journalists talk virus (same link before)




And, reported COVID 31 December, allowed month half later, February.




Like, I'm saying China fight virus completely wrong way, saying blatantly false facts cool hope going public messages 100x normal amount fall, reminding people get flu shot ASAP. flu season start exactly shot by? I‚Äôve never one. Europe competent leaders United States not.

Vote November 3.  can‚Äôt afford four years nonsense. Hey. Congrats kicking tobacco. That‚Äôs huge! groups outside, reducing chance transmission 19x. People wearing masks, cuts transmission another 60%.

You believe want, far evidence protests significant disease vector. Granted still little early definitively say. We'll circle back 4 weeks. one ignoring data here. Cuomo got problem control. DeSantis not. Sorry facts upsetting run away. cities protests seen greater increase positive tests places otherwise similar conditions? Without contact tracing, seems like best way figure visit Marinette, Wisconsin afterwards Thursday. posted something similar earlier different sub, I‚Äôm worried it. 

We‚Äôre good Marinette county. 42 cases.

With &amp; staff coming county visiting Oklahoma Arizona, along supporters might travel counties higher rates infection, Brown, I‚Äôm concerned spike cases. 

My comfort Marinette largest county WI fairly spread out, it‚Äôs possible Marinette might see rise, much towns. I‚Äôve quoting non-stop really feel it‚Äôs accurate. Europe real lockdown. US didn't. Politics greed. Even seeing happened Italy week two big surge cases NY, upper management refused implement effective measures. 'We'll take action becomes problem' rather acknowledging reality asymptomatic carriers significant time delay infection severe symptoms. They're greedy, hey hundred extra people get infected die, can't prove got infected nothing worry about! Welcome USA, dumbass care ppl die Yea honestly know anyone heard term ""beer garden."" I've lived Michigan, North Carolina, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, Rhode Island. Edit: thought responding different comment Google it, working fisheries industry literally dangerous job world.

It almost 20x dangerous cop. :) don‚Äôt 60 years stubbornness. I've seen great social distancing efforts thankfully though! ""fuck stats data, anecdotes better""

Both relevant.     
If say ""95% sick people mild symptoms"" without talking 122,165 persons died 3 months, biased view pandemic.   
And, matter fact, happened.   
This turn ""15 soon 0"" anecdotal cases 2 millions. party consents giving information. yeah, know mean. came like, ‚Äúwell don‚Äôt like America GET out.‚Äù Lol 
But thank you! hope well. Mongolia, still recognition....

The country 0 local infections, cases people arrived outside country tested quarantine.

There's 5 flights month country repatriating citizens, person getting involuntary 14 day quarantine extensive tests. UK left EU 31st January 2020. think believed crowds would come. Yeah source talking two Secret Service agents? seen articles covid-19 within Secret Service several weeks necessarily looking either

 I've seen article six volunteers campaign workers whatever article never said whether campaign workers live Tulsa Oklahoma work DC travel every location. China larger, widely distributed... No. participants signed waiver get in. sure factor start foaming mouth able blame them: [Newport beach April 25 extra steps guess data numbers isn‚Äôt strength. I‚Äôm gonna stop communicating learn difference 31k vs 3k deaths. Cuomo put many seniors risk long term facilities. That‚Äôs fact. DeSantis isolated places continual testing every two weeks. Big difference. Selling stock That...doesn't matter. 

You sample population idea incidence int population is. 8 days altogether cases 750 doctors starting out, it‚Äôs quite opposite.

Today average student debt medical school graduate US $200000.

And yes, that‚Äôs even average ones debt (paid wealthy family, etc).

It‚Äôs among onerous debt problems there, can‚Äôt generally escape via bankruptcy.

Combine fewer practical business model options increasing competition jobs mega-practices engaging McDonalds drive-thru medicine, it‚Äôs hard world average new doctor today. Good point. I'm US live Germany. wearing masks inside, required. sounda like people much compliant US. numbers reported cases low Germany. crazy . 

I left movie theater. saw movie cinema time. seating limited course lot restrictions. feels like life almost got back usual here. 

Meanwhile, homeland see numbers cases still piling wearing mask somehow political issue looks like government continuing fail handling this. hurts bad feel useless.

If one thing could get anyone living inside US right now:

People really mocked Trump US lot. used hear lot shit US. dissolved. pity. really miss reticle. pity much worse. curve looks remarkably flatter theirs. Lower peak, longer lasting. words, exactly set do, article acknowledges, fewer deaths per capita EU, also fewer Western Europe per capita alone!

Good stuff! people nitwits. wasn‚Äôt equivalent walking around hand-grenade without pin takes everyone within blast radius, wouldn‚Äôt care. do. Oh wait 2 weeks crowd noticeably absent one. That‚Äôs fair. There‚Äôs special place hell people bring newborns bar I‚Äôm trying get fucked up. I‚Äôve bar 4 months so. sounds like incredible parents. problem kids fortunate enough parents willing dedicate much time. needs balance help less fortunate children still opportunities learn succeed. yes. problem cause people meet family go stores. make another outbreak possible. disagreeing, fact even understand issue system functions. typical redditor mindset ""DAE MOAR MUNY FIX IT"" cool 14 year old knows literally nothing bit cringe trying actually real discussion. Let put way: hospitals try charge much possible insurance companies pay think possibly get ,regardless real cost. solution looking system ""Pump money it"" horrendously stupid. There's nothing it. Hahahaha Good weather south? enjoy 90% humidity? German meat industry: hold Bratwurst. 
I mean good numbers recently. Everybody seemed happy went pretty well, suckers decided couldn‚Äôt really held accountable laws, time deliberately ignore laws regulations. Result: speak. recommendation. hopefully people heed it. american shut . . right. Food City supermarket chain yesterday buying groceries next nine days. hand sanitizer, 1oz bottles half size thumb. Supermarket wanted $3.99 shook head disgust walked away. would hope getting better treating COVID-19. 5 months doctors understanding needs done help treat patients. start still learning disease treat it. Also lot people waiting really bad seeking medical attention. people hit sick get tested treated. Early intervention important. 

Even number cases going would hope number deaths level go know better treat.  That‚Äôs extreme double think can‚Äôt believe supporters don‚Äôt see

1) Trump acted early saved hundreds thousands lives 

2) Coronavirus isn‚Äôt big deal need reopen country

How save many lives threat big deal? Who's denying science? results. 1% positive test protesters vs 2% positive regular testing. outside masks generally safe.  Hope okay! big part disdain stems career bartender thinking people bring babies bars worst. incredible vast majority people dying nursing homes. sure else you‚Äôre talking about. article apply this? They're testing randomly, they're testing everyone. Multiple times. wonder think there's lots testing-it's happening there. Exactly, people act like it‚Äôs conclusive fact masks don‚Äôt protect you. simpletons. Also, it‚Äôs obvious people going angry subject law restrain sake others. That‚Äôs Americans are. especially also masks reasons. New York still leads country deaths cases. Illinois less half population California. Flattening curve never keeping people getting disease. overwhelming medical resources preventing deaths would happened that. steroid treatments putting sick elderly people back others, deaths still avoided. end, probably wind exposed virus. not. *decline* even NYC still since protests happened. It‚Äôs spikes uneducated areas south primarily. I, desperately need vaccine soon get one.

If succeeds, maybe end year time frame nightmare ends Hahahahaha hahahah 

‚Äúpolice enforce laws‚Äù. Good joke friendo! theh NFL expects start September? going happen, going start third string players time, players keep getting hit COVID 19? Coaches, 60 year old head assistant coach gets it? feel there. exactly happened Argentina. like 3 weeks worth ""gradually opening back"" go back square 1 evidence newborns catching virus and/or dying? got religion? Nothing nothing. üôåüèΩ lose healthcare coverage job used pay crazy amounts insurance. It‚Äôs harsh sometimes harsh smack better drowning fluids. Florida + Arizona + peaking places seem protest hotspots? I'm saying overall many people tested. honestly know many people exposed you‚Äôre making things up. money throwing research alone isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdoing nothing.‚Äù Someone interviewed article said would feel good sending kids school everyone wore masks, students need eat. Would six feet distance talking enough prevent spread? Ah bummer, thanks perspective. much easier make lot money certain fields U.S. example, software development U.K. new grads around 30k. U.S., major tech hub new grad, getting 100k salary + benefits need. 5-10 years senior software developer making [250k+ really love field go beyond senior.

You can't making kind money software development country. Yea... bit like conserving water taking shorter showers.

Yea, makes difference, Nestle farming use 99% water, conservation fuck provide way us plebs criticize sacrificing enough. Dropping used gloves parking lot magically teleport ocean either. fact, people, even careless, going beach throw plastic ocean.

So must mechanism landfill ocean. Otherwise, problem? reality aerosol generation, however, far complex ""droplet"" versus ""airborne"" dichotomy would suggest, says Marr. People produce wide range different-sized particles mucus saliva. particles get smaller evaporate air travel different distances depending surrounding air way definitions set up, ""droplet"" vs ""airborne"" distinction, first established 1950s even earlier,"" says Marr. ""There limited understanding aerosol science 5 micrometer droplet linger air. ""If air perfectly still, would take half hour fall height 6 feet ground. And, course, air perfectly still,"" says Marr. ""So easily blown around time stay air longer shorter.""

Take look laser illumination cough still air, tell comfortable 6 feet enough distancing protect you. Lol serious ?

There‚Äôs 7.5billion people earth. 466 thousand died, that‚Äôs drop ocean reality think death humanity? Contact tracers identify contacts, also advise people positive stop contagious provide support getting groceries, medications, etc. can't leave house. I‚Äôm grocery store vendor, I‚Äôm 10 every day. last week, I‚Äôve noticed half shoppers aren‚Äôt wearing masks anymore, even though there‚Äôs signs saying they‚Äôre allowed without them. 

Masks really aren‚Äôt hard come anymore. easily buy almost anywhere now. idea people risking everyone else‚Äôs health mask little bit inconvenient. I'd rather trust NIH CDC day. fuck ups, especially fucked initial testing kits, COST THOUSANDS LIVES. go fuck themselves. chew, biggest thing mouth seems healing damage inflicted it. gums much resilient. I've always enjoy hot food, eat spicier stuff I've able enjoy long time. Currently Boston masks pretty much ubiquitous even outside. Numbers way things slowly cautiously opening again. Sorry hear that. How's son now? Measured literally opening 6-8 weeks ago Denmark...

I sure shit hope knows talking about, cause saying simply true. People careless here. maintain somewhat normal life, still generally respectful pandemic. works. Milan, every single person wears mask. Sometimes mine breaks I'm one feels like asshole without one. run home someone yells work closed glass box inside store, pull mask washing sanitizing hands work, dealing publix sanitize wash pull back exit little area. 50 states protests simultaneously send parents nursing home ready die. blaming global pandemic that's affected entire world? want go road, add top 5 current total death counts UK, Italy, France, Spain, Belgium get **145,013** deaths compared **119,935** U.S. no, Europe done better. 

In fact, scientific models predicating U.S. would 2 million deaths point lockdowns social distancing. 120,000 deaths terrible, however, nowhere near millions predicted.

Secondly, main culprit many cases U.S. European travel New York City especially Italy. there, people [New York City brought virus major cities starts China outbreak occurred November 2019 Chinese government tried cover arresting doctors [destroying proof virus December January, World Health Organization claimed human-to-human transmission occur later proved lie.

All I'm saying quit blaming terrible times. 518K tests, 5% positive  Oh jeez percent positive remained 4-6% last weeks. 3 consecutive days 500K+ tests really worry raw number cases going especially percent positive same. can't even stay home. work animal business boss lives county enforcing masks one wears one. wear one work get reprimanded it. believes huge hoax. Hes age bracket would affected got could give less fuck. roommate got tested sick one point wanted come work even know COVID not. came back work got offended worried wife getting it. Trying find new job, hard. :/ true. Politicians used least feign create solutions covid 19 made realize competence interest solving problem since solving hurts thing care reelection chances. figured instead could lie even anyone got wise probably voters anyway. can‚Äôt help think we‚Äôre fucked comes virus. 

I get feeling coronavirus death humanity. might die instantly, time, virus entered bodies point. can‚Äôt even good job containing it, especially US. 

Point being: virus end killing us all. give time. Especially proper treatments vaccine, we‚Äôre fucked. honestly squabbling &lt;10 percent different worlds apart. Amazing could ""deep clean"" surfaces equipment touches food put barriers possible limit food's exposure. Even quick sanitizing surfaces break/lunch times would good surfaces would remain clean assuming workers masked washed hands coming back I'd think. long term careful analysis patience waiting fact manifest drive clicks!!!! notice! :)

But respecting social distancing least! dude believes wearing mask first step towards Mark Beast. cannot communicate rationally them. mainland Europe, mask wearing compulsory. argument irrelevant. lucky one smart friends. soon lockdown lifted best friend, fiance, friends started going eat. I've seen, American public whole little regard whole pandemic. lack mask wearing I've seen city abysmal. city fair bit south fine imposed wearing mask public obviously compliance rate much higher. agree jail time exact opposite answer, especially given virus spreads prison environment. said, needs carrot stick situation make happen. Thats basically.what entire agricultural politics Last 20 years Germany about. enough Monitoring law to.really make difference! You‚Äôre wrong, restaurants options door dash postmates. build ordering system website (not super challenging, plug &amp; play shopping services would work) people call orders. restaurant felt like needed still grub hubs world, could incentivize people call orders offering small discount throwing free appetizer something. really rising cases right whole. percent positive remained 4-6% last weeks. wonder Aguas Calientes like? whole town exists tourism. ‚Äòlives‚Äô ‚Äòmatter‚Äô triggered insert something funny black lives matter. Unfortunately funny. Apparently desperation message sent 2 hours event begging people Shrug. Last time hit coin jar change, buy gas $0.75 gallon. pretty easy look countries leaders acted realize failed extremely hard. Centre County much larger State College. people Centre County care think joke. places go could care less mask not. I've places girls behind counter told me, ""You wear mask here."" Penn State opens back cases going skyrocket. Penn State employees live outside State College. 6-7 weeks since opened things Denmark, yet numbers keep falling. People careless here. respect virus, still maintaining somewhat normal life, actually literally careless. Father's day, state report anything. Journalist newsreader virus transmitted foods? also count stats differently. There'a big variation even state-by-state basis. There's easy way compare stats precisely countries. collecting UI likely can't turn job else lose UI. That's happened me. house almost three months either go back work lose income. Really depends country. I'm one countries europe lot cases covid, 4 days quarantine lifted would see like 1 person 100 wearing mask.

Will see goes. hand there's like 3 new cases per day seem crazy wear mask. Still, high R0 right due single mass outbreak basically already contained (hopefully). Maybe breaks lunches. exactly correct. may well stop arguing idiot. thinks understands works, doesn‚Äôt. 5.8 million. including UK part EU since start virus

There fewer 10 deaths EU-28 COVID-19 prior Brexit, zero UK prior Brexit, first early EU + UK different story

340 per million combined talk respirator makers, interesting pick one strawman instead replying something actually said like Roche.

Regardless though, seem agree people profit this, end day really saying. third world countries seem better job US point Properly disposed garbage magically teleport ocean. Litter washed storm drains end ocean. Properly disposed garbage ends landfill. Yep, here's 


1 5 saw cardiac issues regardless presented lung issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

March 27, 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

Compounded theory people heart attacks economic distress US government better step stimulus support health country keep social distancing orders place, since theory says need make sure people pay bills evidence based article little month ago says 20% infected cardiac issues want cripple nation healthcare costs 5 - 10 years road. Yet evidence shows Victoria state Australia. levels testing USA, besides Victoria yesterday, single digit new cases months accross Australia now.

It's easy get test here, I'm Sydney, called sick yesterday cough, walked hospital, got test 20 mins, results (negative) 8pm day. think figured out, don‚Äôt you? That's really true all.

Train staff better. Remove profit facilities, better oversight. Increase pay benefits staff scraping bottom barrel. Mandate external patient advocates monitor patients themselves, review medication decisions, authority order second opinions. Decrease patients per staff member loads. 

There zero reason can't changed plain old greed apathy. Nobody really cares unless *their* family, patient family advocating them, treated badly begin with. nobody willing admit health care profit disgusting, outdated, damn near evil. 

You could roll back changes Medicaid Medicare decreased availability home health services. could fund county city based programs fill gap. could round volunteers rotate local facilities observe report. could insist licensing accreditation bodies job, make sure they're funded well enough so. 

Straight up, home health twenty years nurse's assistant. work hard, demanding, requires training. something beyond abilities average person. Since family member would train things specific loved one rather general skills able care patient, could fund family caregivers train them. 

Many, many cases involved teaching family needed staff there. get average person speed two weeks one patient's needs learn. month hour day instruction, person could taught safely effectively give care loved one. Then, pay it. option. 

Considering families least economic freedom ones highest risk nursing homes, would benefits too. someone necessary task instead navigate unemployment, working whatever minimum wageslave job get. They'd learn skills would benefit themselves, family, community. They'd engaged loved one, connected way enriches everyone involved.

So yes, *lot* do. There's lot *should* doing. Maryland decided reopen casinos, know right alongside gyms, still movie theaters.

I work casino.

It makes absolutely sense. policies place essentially amount security theater. plexiglass shields face mask requirements sanitizer everywhere. I'm supposed wipe plex glass whenever guest gets shit realistic practically. I'm trying. impossible keep up. guests nonchalant. wiping shields really added burden - theres reason come contact them.

Meanwhile, dealers picking losing chips one player, putting contact chips, paying winning players chips. realistic points contact like seats tables wiped down. Slots set distancing obviously cleaned every time guest gets up. players loooovvee move around. can't stay game machine start losing.

The contamination potential obscene.

But are. Despite promises casino would phase three.

That even touch major failures. promised n95 masks. got thin cloth masks. Social distancing even thought outside plexiglass separators tables turned machines. Players wearing masks noses much frequency. people posed enforce policies procedures overwrought trying already difficult job expected beforehand capacity dealing added burdens.

TL:DR; Casinos shit show proof states care money anyone's wellbeing. too! infection Start Oct 6 Dec 11 seems plausible considering fact need weeks couple dozen cases hospital visits.

And miss diagnosed flu beginning need hospital cases see something new going on. don‚Äôt know border similar one towards Denmark it‚Äôs tell problem cross it. many reasons list get across border, it‚Äôs hard really want to. Sorry, bad. link working. government know who's proximity infected person send messages people using cell data.

Salad plants also outbreaks curious aspirating, swallowing correctly, could lead pneumonia. Okie works restaurant kitchen. It‚Äôs bad. Many parents new borns children out. 20 top table today.

Seriously, shut up. blatant misinformation. don‚Äôt know many losers think give up, reality developed nations facing I'm pretty sure governor AZ absolutely abide. He's shitshow. show data demonstrates common long-term COVID effects? definitely change mind there's data supports claim. though. removing ton symtomatic cases population based severe enough warrent testing diagnosis.

It's going ugly. side town this? Ugh Right, turn coming due fears OK doctor nobody. Yeah sometimes think deeper game remember suggested inject bleach. Well, lot rambling. top 142 pre-existing one say? Keep windows open, fresh air helps dilute viral concentration reduce risk infection, keep physical distance especially avoid speaking close quarters, mask appropriate. suppose motivation local paper put propaganda? stand gain? feel like he's trying outdo Bolsonaro worst president ever, pandemic.  I'd think Oklahoma would one first states Trump asked ""slow"" testing in. 
Maybe even outright suppress numbers days surge comes rally...

...and gloat saying nothing happens hyped people paranoid. people saved wearing mask, one saying everyone. got really extreme black white thinking going here, really immature It‚Äôs even worse upper estimate Swine Flu twelve years ago, calm down... Actually, yes. Remindme! 2 weeks I've heard excuse before. got source stat? course did... drinking Clorox excuse. sarcastic. ""When Abbott announced plan open Texas late April, pointed state's positivity rate, dropped 6%. rate, indicates percentage positive cases reported given period time, hit high point mid-April shot 15.85%.

Abbott cautioned state leaders would interpret number ""red flag"" climbed sustained trend around 10%.""

Insert *So fucking lie* meme crisis he‚Äôs president. whole job presidency prevent stuff like this. failed miserably job. India. lived US while. Trust US better anyday. sub sucks. ""Europeans killed with""? ""diseases Europeans killed...""? 99.9% deaths disease unintentional. Europeans didnt evem understand germ theory point history. phrase shit like talking Bubonic Plague Covid19? put later put indefinitely. happens evolutionary pressure.

In case, pressure. I‚Äôm saying all. I‚Äôm saying opposite. Taking preventive measures important, *all* states them. I‚Äôm saying reckless states invalidating hard work careful measures responsible states taking. health comes first. Even everyone social distanced (they it'd worth actually anyways), still enclosed space hours ac blowing everything around even 6 feet enough. Ha, Cave Creek! one? diving pretty deep mind man give fuck anything says makes sense all. You‚Äôre correct, people age wrong too, response Abbot saying young people responsible ‚Äì I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs outlandishly ignorant I‚Äôm really seeing public. 

Seems like young old people ignoring safety measures live homes. right, possible, 70% infection rate translates 2-4 Million deaths USA alone. That's surreal devastating prospect. happen scroll bit lower page portion tmc says current growth trajectories anticipate ICUs overwhelmed 2 weeks?

Think way 

You clue disagree it* might contact tracing. One person positive work place whole office goes get tested. Maybe another 5-10 positives asymptomatic?

That case watermelon farm supposedly.

Hospital Death data tell us DeSantis lying. ""scientific studies"" don;'t say think do. Keep head clouds, reality would much you. Honestly, I‚Äôm ashamed American right now. 

Think sacrifices hardships people endure order overcome greatest challenges last 100 years.  Take WW2 example; food rations, recycling, manufacturing pretty much entire country pitched make sure war. entire nation forgoing personal interests benefit nation.

Now people can‚Äôt bothered something simple wear fucking mask hang big groups. 1946, people Europe would speaking German right now. could add part 3 post, ""maybe full quote mitigating context."" *Watches video* aaaaand full quote much worse. 

Also... hear audience boo said they've done 25M tests? numbers/stats children? find info?  don‚Äôt think get virus ingesting it. virus still live surface food, touch touch face rub eyes could get it. Nah. 18.7 times less contagious average outside, people protests wearing kind mask.

Awesome! part choosing go social meetup, though suppose would not.

While would suggest it, own. Bring national guard back Hi, could worth trying reflux medication. I've atypical reflux issues since corona cause sorts things describing. Michigan small. Huffing farts long run. Hey, fellow Nova Scotian? 

Assuming so, yes, cases extremely concentrated. matter, 1/3 cases 5/6 deaths came Northwood long term care facility. hope mask wearing picks start opening rest world.

No. can't. Why? health hazard.

They cant have, ""Delta, sometimes theres shit seat"" motto, tell people, ""well, *all* get B without crashing. rules possibly apply us! Aahhhhhahahahaha!!!""

If *churches* get shut safe... telling nothing whatsoever close similar regulation plane?

You may *want* rules simply 'caveat emptor' nothing else. that's simply real world. Where??? friend got sent home job coworker got sick tested positive. screened approved test first. Work let back two negative tests. I'm trying help we're stumped. Japanese people enjoy working hard though. Sure cases over-worked salary man. part people dread go work want bare minimum leave. 80 hours feels worth it.

True that‚Äôs feel too, I‚Äôm gonna let fear virus keep living life (while still respecting people‚Äôs concerns) could drop dead moment number things sound confused. Definitely bigoted though got Adidas masks slide filters into, gonna look cool AF mask suck lol

Seriously tho kinda nice, look like ninja preparing trip South Korea people masks time anyways, one spits it. varying room room Possibly covid also directly damages tissues. far know evidence covid infection creates antibodies target body. Sanitize car, doff. Huh that‚Äôs interesting, thanks source. hypothesis why? first second point:

[Coronavirus seems mutate much slower seasonal *is* D614G produces increased infectivity:

[Mutated coronavirus shows significant boost Encouragingly, duo found immune factors serum infected people work equally well engineered viruses without D614G mutation. That‚Äôs hopeful sign vaccine candidates development work variants without mutation, Choe says.

So wrong counts. Please stop talking like know anything.

Goodbye. Honestly think trump already got either asymptomatic got blood someone recovered didnt get antibodies.

It explains trump keeps insisting problem.

He got it, nothing 'bad' happened him, since concept empathy cant imagine bad anyone else. confirm, resident rural Virginia. one wears masks stores (I course). Huge groups people running around good time nothing different. Even playgrounds fully closed people throwing birthday parties right next signs saying closed due health risks. time mention masks anyone say want wear since Northam wearing one enforce it.  similar dynamics american meat plants: exploited immigrant laborers highly centralized, indoor production speaking hot dogs... remember time BO ordered $65k hot dogs party WH? remember.

I rescheduled lunch friend like 4 times giving. Pissed hr headhunter rescheduling like 5 times duplicate post made google URL forwarder. Read actual recommendation. Mechanistically, masks work that's used. There's faith involved, science-based medicine.

It's also dumbest possible hill die on. I've wasted enough time you. Peru's excess deaths numbers end May, probably 25,000 excess deaths now. per capita basis, Peru's outbreak one worst world.  Almost zero masks go southeast side Michigan, everyone partying thru shut down, multiplied lot shut down. make put bed early. üë∂ Nice! See gives hope.

Doctors even know make know causing it. Better take safer rather sorry one. definitely odd physiological stuff going virus, even caused bodies' overreaction it. primarily issue gives immunity. 

If impression (which many laypeople would be) immunity solely based antibodies, could seem pretty alarming. 

But immune system made lot parts - specifically, even antibodies fade, cells B cells retain memory create antibodies specific given disease. Upon exposed second time, start produce antibodies, means infection take hold. 

Basically, loss antibodies interesting (though unique) scientific perspective, tell us anything immunity, people actually care about.  ... what? know else say seems pretty obvious could catch testing center. Covering erroneous recommendations major health institutions malfeasance part reporters. Entities responsible public health taking dangerous stances ethical newsperson's nightmare one point difference response countries, saw happening throughout legitimate news world pandemic arriving US UK. Yup everything re-opening going back business usual soon Trump conistently retarded conceded; sad Looking state-wide totals Washington misses important nuance.

In April, 6000 new cases King, Snohomish, Pierce counties. 1600 Yakima, Benton, Franklin, Walla Walla, Spokane. numbers roughly proportion total population; almost four times many people live King/Snohomish/Pierce, almost four times many people tested positive COVID-19.

But two sets diverge that. May, see King/Snohomish/Pierce getting better. New cases dropped ~6000 ~3000. Meanwhile, eastern counties new cases rose ~1600 ~3400.

And far June, trend continued. ~1500 new cases far King/Snohomish/Pierce; ~3800 new cases Yakima/Benton/Franklin/Walla Walla/Spokane (~2500, ~6000 end-of-month pace).

If look state whole think ""treading water. really getting much better, getting much worse."" look specific regions, complicated. Things look good - great, good - King County neighbors.

Things look alarming around cities eastern part state. spread halted; even look like slowed much. Yakima's hospitals apparently running beds, starting send patients out-of-county less overloaded hospitals. point fingers-crossed cases double *again* July, would swamp local medical infrastructure. God forbid report stupid shit fuckwit regularly spouts. don‚Äôt wanna hear here‚Äôs idea... don‚Äôt vote fucking morons. (Although probably can‚Äôt help vote someone like you) DNC. There's really jokes made deaths exceed even wars. date today woman army therapist. started talking politics, insisted Trump best know he‚Äôs corrupt Obama.

She learned don‚Äôt count facts, she‚Äôs always right, liked Rural, ambulances helicopters available, get transported. point I'm hoping Trump catches Covid end him, would ultimate poetic justice this.  You... are. ""He joking"" common refrain enablers every time says something stupid. Yeah see saying, agree lot misinformation, lot fear surrounding pandemic, displayed media world. attitude think reasonable people may fortunate enough live area affected, fortunate enough many deaths around related Covid. 

I think arguing numbers pointless, people find information supports narrative, however try rely historically substantiated sources think accurate representation. sure underreported deaths well. 

The thing worrisome unlike flu potentially aggressive pneumonia component seems hit people even harder flu underlying health concern, without health concern. finding quite common people health concern. 

I think something important note brand new virus top ones existing. people dedicate entire lives studying viruses diseases understand them, makes think necessary educate work need know them. world ill prepared hopefully learn misgivings gain preparedness future. man access top medical experts. fully aware testing virus crucial fighting pandemic. identifies infected people isolated treated reduces chances spreading deadly pathogen. amuse said people ‚Äúslow testing‚Äù reduce number reported cases intern reflect badly competence president handling outbreak. concerned public‚Äôs perception peoples lives. sabotaging America‚Äôs responses virus deliberately causing deaths It‚Äôs citizens potentially beyond. Deaths could well prevented testing withholding. 
The way understand this. murder, hell pretty much genocide using biological weapon what? shift public perspective?

I hope stay safe well.. maybe call law enforcement report crime. BBC ran piece yesterday basically saying terms response, Brazil US presidents small club one else seems want member of. feel bad writers Onion. got point. actively managing outbreak all, border testing.   long way go folks

66 million.  

Population earth 7.6 billion. 

Fuck. Yeah case pandemic like this, want everyone taking tests. makes easier figure deadly test easy spreads. two states number infected, one way testing other, one lower test rates failing it‚Äôs citizens. 

It makes sense every state try test everyone president tell everyone country stop testing. independent alex jones left

Lol nope league  hate accepting fact everyone going catch it, huge percentage people going need accept it. Like even masks hand sanitizer world, can't stop virus entirely. still risk going catch it. Also workplaces want workers continue work home, offices great hotspots viruses. despise Trump think complete idiot, child constant tantrums, psychopath empathy regard anybody else all. 

And I'll jump get downvoted you, 100% agree you. picking battles retain credibility, stupid choice. Processing handling. cold chain virus surface packaging frozen ice infectious multiple days. Workers processing/handling exposed touching inhaling (in case aerosol involved). Sexual assault allegations? smoking pure crack rock think Biden better, less worse? Probably, better?

Right, open already act like nothing. crazy! Thanks pointing out. needed lol It‚Äôs also super accurate, give decent idea estimate. Well, Trump point even bad one. Last week Sweden started huge drive diagnose people - week amount infected spiked due newly diagnosed Sweden got slammed worldwide many ""new"" cases. 

So point thing care looking good online. is.  talked someone whose son autistic.

I remember that, years earlier he'd told bullshit story TV show someone works baby got Austism vaccinated, repeated Twitter stage saying 10 years ago.

Then debates told story, prefaced saying happened ""Just day"". He's shameless, can't even help lying lies.  let worlds worst used car salesman tell think. . . Ok I‚Äôm Italian may work differently there. But, person willing gather crowd, advise wearing masks respecting social distancing, even one gets infected, authorities would arrest guy provoked epidemic damages public health. Can‚Äôt ? Yes, event president clearly, can‚Äôt get away *ü•¥*  worst. pretty sure black plague worse also european came Am√©ricas. world would anyone joke that? Lol@ mandatory. 

Meanwhile drive around San Diego downtown Saturday night every single person see wearing mask. 

Bars clubs open street people huddled circles, faces inches away other, arms other‚Äôs shoulders. 

Literally everyone sitting tables eating drinking maskless blessing San Diego county government - - sit down, Covid can‚Äôt infect apparently. don‚Äôt need wear mask.

The world gone mad. Gerrimandering, plain simple. this, USA would progressive government. Shipment returned sender beat within inch life, disowned her, kicked house. Guinness kills viruses.  Ironically countries manage poorly always ask questions like ""how come China making big deal 20 something confirmed cases day, must hiding cases!"" testing enough find many. saying wont many, can't see testing ramping up. Yup, us Indians refuse believe China devil, nation people dreams hopes like reported words, verbatim, call fake news. wonder world thinks bunch fucking yokel dipshits. think it‚Äôs negligent trump point issue **national mandate** everyone wear face mask covering public (outdoor indoor) areas. dare he!!! actually think trying make terrible, extremely inappropriate joke, scary thing people nodding vehemently behind thinking he‚Äôs serious agreeing test less. 

I can‚Äôt believe exist reality. wanted ""funny"" name, I'm surprised use Walla Walla. also believe real place.

You check names Washington. pronounce Puyallup least year first moved there. got Issaqua Hoquiam, plus small stuff like communities schools whatever. Great stuff, love place. would zero problem another year. Zero. mean, 19 time world.

Dreadful disease. two different strains would recommend getting Yeah European forgot aspect us society also said everyone gets eventually, masks distancing everwhere would dramatically wrong. So, could infer giving cause everyone willl contract it. hey, one passive comment another right? Helpful. Thanks.  Perhaps time anything. Here's two close-contacts:

When first started, store exiting, man shouting another man across aisle directly path. held breath. mask bit eye-protection (now wear mask eye-protection times).

Another time, walk neighborhood two young girls coming toward path narrow. immediately turned 90¬∞ right walked bushes, turned back toward passed. USA top Brazil closing hard...

wait.. forget India. speed getting higher! ends American experiment. Trump literally jokes need slow testing pokes fun 10 year old sniffles tested positive Covid-19 he'll 15 minutes. people get died die. He's gone deep end. wonder half country take seriously. one sentence acts like always nothing sniffles takes credit says saved thousands lives. freaking joke. Extremely, sun kills seconds, people likely big house parties, inside likely spreads slower rural area urban due natural social distance.

But yeah exponential growth pick up, things get ugly.  covid. 2 days ago felt like got hit train bad body aches were. congestion that‚Äôs it. Got e-mail local comedy club opening next week. recall correctly seats 100. Supposedly checking temperature door, turning away/refunding people temp 100. fact, decent list protocols website that, followed, help mitigate issues. Masks required though, suggested.

Problem I've already seen first hand business websites make claim one set procedures, go case. Finally broke winter tires removed (stud-less snow tires, anybody gets arms) regular tires put car. Although tire place's website claimed sorts protocols place (customers stay car, drive bays, stay car worked on), instead business usual. walk in, take keys, wait lobby, 1/3 less people wearing masks. Southeast Asia broke out. Everyone started wearing mask fast. Every store ran mask buy thailand.

When first community spread case happened America, already knew going end badly.

Here kicker. brother told Asian community New York started wear mask attacked wearing causing everyone stop completely fear attack. backwards compared Asia. Texas Florida using playbook. work hospital shocked covid patient ""discharged"" go facility patients ventilators going die. stats +1 COVID patient discharged change COVID deaths.  
  
This realized numbers falsified save face. March first started talking cytokine storms, showerthought give immunosuppressants patients hit that. reading threads dexamethasone methylpred seems like they've already made part treatment regimen clinicians, they're appropriate, long time ago. think steroid treatments already mostly baked numbers. hope it‚Äôs higher. I‚Äôm hoping hundreds thousands personally. us needs good culling. Sounds like one pushing ""the narrative"", friend. Jesus save dumbasses point, he‚Äôs holiday. coincides everything I've reading well. lockdown long enough case numbers hit 0. Society didn‚Äôt commit it. 

If go back early April corona virus eliminated mid May.  

The spread never 1 1.  going continue lockdown good reason. ensure spread 1. Hopefully significantly below.  aren‚Äôt willing implement laws / fines / additional closures reason keep lockdown going.  Go big go home. chose go home. Joe Rogan big reason. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* see parents years. see anyone either. That's crazy Yes lol describe us may want watch it? found ‚Äúneutralizing antibodies‚Äù fewer 5% COVID-19 patients,

This can't right either. feel like journalist may misunderstood scientist way (in addition bigger mistake headline mixing vaccine vs therapy).

Most recovered patients neutralizing antibodies, since that's main mechanism behind recovery.

 (peer reviewed)

Only 1 14 patients neutralizing antibodies.

 

Only 10 175 patients undetectable levels neutralizing antibodies. joke supporter president actually wish testing would stop. nothing hurt polls. Keep Covid Quiet get reelected easy. 1 mistake: electing Trump. Kota. Thanks lot this! Wait minute, Dengue fever + Covid-19 + Drama China India + Drama NK SK + unrest US? 

Someone alert Robinhooders, time immediately take everything go long stocks!  got pernicious anaemia means stomach take B12 food body self producing antibody combats function. can't envisage would change pill form.

If pill contains really high dose (1mg example) B12, body able absorb around 1% diffusion, intrinsic factor needed. need 2.5¬µg B12 per day 1% 1mg would give enough B12 4 days. Uhh setups working üò¨ They‚Äôre super high risk don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm paranoid check snap map. major cities west young people bars groups masks. fair ‚Äúpeople need work‚Äù completely valid US unable get results literally rest world. 

A lockdown makes sense long it‚Äôs producing results.  Keeping people home hospitals aren‚Äôt overrun case numbers dropping often still going winning strategy. 

For many reasons US simply could take lockdown seriously enough justify longer.  Even blue states like California numbers flat lined would considered pandemic levels asian countries decided good enough reopen. 

Is really good enough? No. almost Asia shown us government tries hard enough society listens virus practically get eliminated handfuls manageable cases. 

The US reopen trajectories never going reach 0 fucked late April.  targets April corona virus deaths nearing 0 mid May completely control June even worst hit states.  following trend lines set rest world.  May end June. July long term trend lines US show us even getting better today. 

The difference getting spread .9 .8 per person. US never able get spread 1 usually around 1.2. 30% difference difference lockdown effectively end pandemic lockdown last forever. 

Technically US never implemented lockdown.  shutdown businesses never mandated masks, fined people going outdoors meeting friends.  honor system except businesses.  May wasted month - since numbers stagnated even went would pointless.  

I guess 2 choices - double treat fucking seriously complete real lockdown June July open up... president leadership still claiming hoax already declared success disbanded federal response one wasn‚Äôt option. 

The US stalling vaccine saves us proud government broken actually address real challenge. Seriously? Nobody going get offended kid called outlier Dude that's like extreme paranoia personally wouldn‚Äôt risk it. Passive absorption possible though. need take really large dose since around 1% absorbed way. take 1 mg B12, body able make use 10¬µg. That's cool shouldnt ""protested"" looted recently, would less infected ppl. Yeah. RTI public authority apparently.

A called emergency fund nobody knows much money has, donated funds used.

Here takeaway. reason elderly people generally included studies bad science. People protesting, riding bikes, going walks, protesting! Sports used distraction government walk people. Without sports people paying attention what‚Äôs going around them. money driven decision. 

Many hospitals struggle decades recover months cancelled surgery probably Similar boat here. Buying groceries every 2-3 weeks, otherwise going anywhere. even good place go walk - biggest complaint since moving south, everything designed cars sidewalks, narrow shoulder-less roads deep drainage ditches running alongside. could drive park like used times week one taking Covid seriously want close large groups maskless people. Walks around parking lot night enough. finally caved bought exercise bike work pent energy. I'm mentally Covid, wish people would wear damn mask public stop acting stupidly could *actually* get pandemic get back normal life. Come save day üòÇ read study.

The mask finding low certainty. like study rule random chance. Worker's around world need rise this. 

I admit thought worker treatment would better Europe compared US. ""Normal"" relative. normal us would crazy fir great grandfathers, people cultures. also everchanging. world knew exist anymore, better accept it. would happened many wats sooner later without pandemic, pandemic accelerated many things. day day vary aspects (more prevalent remote work, care sanitizing etc, grandchildren mock us insisting getting hands properly clean) important, geopolitics economics taking sharp turn. someone said, past foreign country. sense, events like one like crossing ocean away country. would great bots could start killing contentless doomer comments too. Fun fact: PPE healthcare term. construction site, required PPE may consist hard hat, high-visibility vest, safety goggles, steel-toed work boots. Belgium - one handful countries included 'probable' deaths (covid symptoms, never tested) official toll - like 150-200 official covid deaths excess deaths, total 9,700 official covid deaths. think really ""overestimate"": mentioned elsewhere Italy's overall excess mortality rose significantly covid, distribution uneven. north mortality increased lot, 300-500% worst-affected provinces Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi Piacenza; center south, virus basically spread thanks lockdown, mortality increase provinces even decreased (slightly). think true Belgium countries: national data excess deaths influenced increase mortality worst affected areas, also decrease mortality areas virus spread lockdown actually lowered mortality (less flu deaths, less deaths accidents, like). 150-200 covid deaths Belgium ""surpass"" number excess deaths probably compensated lower amount deaths parts country.

Sweden 500 excess deaths official count covid deaths, 10 %. Yes, Netherlands actually deaths per million inhabitants Sweden, Netherlands one European countries greatest underestimate, percentage wise (9,500+ excess deaths vs 6,000 official covid deaths). ‡§Ü‡§ú‡§æ‡§¶‡•Ä units? True. Everything I've experienced explained either natural supernatural forces. matter choice interpretation, choose view it. Please make sure take Vitamin D3. keep getting virus help symptoms. anecdotal expwrience, hope help you. lived four continents 5 countries. tell things don‚Äôt like America worse elsewhere. racist? Europe racist. polluted? Asia, Africa, South America orders magnitude worse.... could go much people complain America, full package pretty nice. middle year. 1,500 deaths 3100 average per year astronomical higher. CDC usually behind 2 weeks stats know 1 person got protesting. know it‚Äôs 1 person, happened.. Probably symptoms report recognise them. favourite miner claim symptoms later revealed lost taste, headaches sore troat. Asymptomatic ass. Oh. Imo go delete comment. think OP means AIDS, tragic pandemic mainly struck gays, hemophiliacs, people requiring blood products. Maybe end causing medical reform US?

 Nope.. probably not. people = risk = infection = deaths remember times mentioning India probably screwed people definitely raged me. get all. Ummm... read? said experts... duh. Like LITERALLY all.

Next gonna ask 3 year old account started commenting 2 months ago? going ask commented pattern easy one two word positive comments build karma primarily commenting downplay virus severity...? Huh? People RIGHTS, y'know! can't ask questions violate RIGHTS FREEDUMS.

That's roughly 4 years worth traffic fatalities crammed 5 month period, pandemic far over. 

Not sure argue traffic deaths concern. death rate say 1% (there estimates either side that, could lower, could higher, know long yet), reach 60% threshold mentioned, would around 2 million dead. That's almost 60 years worth traffic fatalities... Fevers too.

I‚Äôm opposed precautions keep people safer ffs another lockdown ain‚Äôt happening &amp; virus never cracked beginning. try post daily numbers everyday! homophobe? It‚Äôs fact. uncle used work german meat factory. Awful working conditions. literally people walking around shouting workers slow. might get shouted go toilet often. Absolutely awful hygiene.

Yeah, honestly wear mask socially distance certain places outside get house, good unless place want go packed. inside stuff, still no-no unless it‚Äôs essential place like grocery store.

Yup. Totally scientific. Better eliminate personal agency require masks everybody. Questioning plan makes flat-earther.

The people obsessed masks people thought lockdowns smart play. They're gifted people. (If continue refuse actually fight thing, looks probable)

At federal level, hard overstate degree looked large array tools could employ fight COVID, decided to. Asymptomatic Coronavirus.

People still die stuff. Especially nursing homes.

It lose-lose situation, pretty dire [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/Zy2IB) Thats news works Considering proven 2 meters actually enough (the virus spread that) think lessening distance good idea. island called √âire. Ulster one provinces √âire. real problem Medicaid pay much Medicare. absolutely reason distinction. There's old business joke goes. ""Admitting need make changes guarantees need spend money. Putting head sand hoping problem goes away potential cost nothing. know business people like hear it'll cost zero."" Public health crises always blind spot rugged individualism/libertarianism/Gadsden flag type ideologies. Covid care ideology is, force nature, unstoppable force political terms. seeing ideology death throes can't deal outmoded reality. ideology die, matter much damage done first. 2019 numbers dig individually state. Seeing president control states Lockdown policies little say spread per state.

I guess told Gov. Cuomo put covid patients nursing homes high risk elderly. California worse 2 months ago nurse recently retired. $2000. less qualify Medicaid homes take simply payment extremely understaffed would mortified lack care (my friend works Feds inspects places). Anyone $5000.-10,000 month spend get prettier places lot activities ill, nursing care etc add money. friend paying $6,000 month spouse Parkinson‚Äôs full care nurse home needed sitter prevent ‚Äúfall‚Äù insisted hire 24 hr day sitter tune $4000, month additional. 
The hospitals hand get elderly people fall penniless 1%. don‚Äôt family member cares willing endure extreme stress caring working job possibly taking care kids themselves, own. Soon one every five elderly people ones children/family. 
I witnessed hospitals try dump psych units. Send home alone deteriorate get taken advantage time. personally gone ‚Äúretire‚Äù early caring elderly parents six years afar got bad couldn‚Äôt anymore. father passed moved mother me. Thank god kids grown caring themselves. stress almost killed me. blessing parents money use pay bills hire help need help her. tied house 88 yr old dementia least money. many friends age 58 position. parents leave exclusively home make lost 401k income left job 7 yr early. asked protect future. 
I see many problems long term healthcare policies well pretty much priced reach different story. 
My parents raised telling would get car paid etc needed save ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt burden kids‚Äù.

Presumably selling pennies apiece. offered $5/vial today vials produced inside facility, many could get end August still meeting contractual obligations State New York? area, people parks without masks, close 100% masks. go inside store mask usage looks 100%. numbers low (Pittsburgh). worried lack outdoor masks would cause spike appear case. forgot dogs cats. Yeah I'm TX noticed obscenely low infection death ratio. pretty consistent places checked excess deaths 100% likely deaths actually 6k higher now. Diabetes compromises immune system well. exactly auto-immune disorder, mean person diabetes going fight illness/ailment well person without diabetes. Thank Shia Lebouf. Shia muslims. Shia Sunni kinda like Christians Catholic Protestant, except muslims make obvious hate othrr There's mask order Dallas started Friday. So, kind expected. feel like we're hearing fatalities news. Many people permanently disabled condition. Many people undetected blood clots. Ticking time bombs. I'm sorry loss US divided, large anti-scientific us ever even hope that. No, run course population thousands unnecessary deaths occur. tiring trying pride country. Like Portugal need lockdowns. wear goddamn mask...but apparently politically charged statement.

I agree businesses cannot see closed spaced businesses like theaters, concerts, indoor gyms, bars allowed open public like usual even mask social distancing. work businesses, difficult enforce obey. Might well, let open like Covid. still effect deaths going previous hotspots (NY) new hotspots gotten death stage yet new cases. 

It'll happen. impatient, lol UV buttplug. Let‚Äôs dance around it. dont far idiotic idea anyone came with. find Males tend well condition females. Especially preemie males. science still though. 

The twin test positive mild case. fairness, New York strict lockdowns. Since early major outbreak trend skewed rest country data false sense security. Yeah ok üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Thanks, like odds. would get virus first place, even then, like 0.1% chance dying. Maybe even less since pre-existing conditions. also teach people wrong individuality. tell certain haircuts tattoos make unemployable stuffing identical business attire. Meanwhile instead teach individuality means stepping others get ahead better sets apart. Easy reopening. reopened 6-8 weeks tell real story. fair America really ugly history, amazing history. bad gets less focus text books, all. Vulnerable people able isolate anymore. high risk sole caregiver disabled high risk child forced back work. hoping get someone back exemption can't afford lose unemployment choice work business one top vectors infection. wouldnt say lessen. ensure economy State survive. minds stability consumerism institutions US need make actually lives makes sense, bad legacy software everywhere, need prioritize upgrading ASAP beside type 1 diabetes. Ughh....that called condition. Someone shut entire US already, it‚Äôs going work way Hey, acknowledge could wrong, I'm going swallow unverified videos without considering whether credible. Given know, Wuhan videos not. Masks slow infection 80%. Instead 30000 infections wed 10000. lockdown obviously dependent state in. States initial surge well. coming states surge yet. rights guess reality everywhere same. Factories usually hire economically vulnerable people fight rights violated. Also, factories worked (as teen young adult order earn money) mean social pecking order place. Workers terrorised line superiors also coworkers. US suppressed data, like Florida spoke someone recently claimed contact tracer. said 10% followup calls fine, patient gave updates info. 90% either never returned calls told go fuck themselves. spoke someone recently claimed contact tracer. said 10% followup calls fine, patient gave updates info. 90% either never returned calls told go fuck themselves. Learn cook home avoid this. I'm sorry restraunts, I'm comfortable even sitting around outdoors bunch people know theyve been. feel like people rushing back wanting go restraunts mostly types dont wear masks part. another one add list: many Swedish businesses SE/Norwegian border rely Norwegians coming buy cheaper goods. obviously can't happen Sweden hotspot Norway outbreak well control, logically makes recommend people go hotspot.

Meanwhile, article states involved border trade argue policy leads absurd results Nordby punished region includes Gothenburg, Sweden‚Äôs second-largest city, whereas area around shopping centre low infection us, it‚Äôs difficult understand strategy,‚Äù said Ole Christian Hallerud, deputy chief executive Thon Eiendom, Norwegian company owns several Swedish shopping centres, including Nordby 10,000 Norwegians go Gotland holiday meet 10,000 people Stockholm holiday can‚Äôt see difference going Stromstad Charlottenburg. Ninety-five per cent customers would Norwegians,‚Äù added.

So first off, shopping center less hotspot island Norway allowed travel from. Secondly, even Swedish business, one located Sweden.

It makes think matter time Norway opens cross-border shopping. Mid-atlantic open month, cases/positive percentage hospitalizations steady declined. 

Fear mongers gonna fear monger though. Dutch equivalent CDC. Start looking pneumonia deaths Anti China moron? Pretty hilarious Yes: know thing two SCARRING.

But, I'm reality-denying dolt. test point percent positive tests go down, number tests done impacting optics spread disease. virus spreading testing results prove it. Let's see Europe next weeks.
We started ""slow"" reopening seems people care anymore masks social distance. Ok, thanks explaining. many industries thats case especially non academic labour wage jobs industries squeeze every single minute workers. People get incentives go work sick (often times get bonus year without sick leave) import workers western europe give unfair working conditions many germans would rather stay unemployed.

Also going work sick kind sport germany. sick going work looked upon taking ""free vacation"" weak.

Even germany still lot work gets mindset regarding work. First things imo 

1) dont strive lowest cost food possible a) thats unsustainable b) germans one unhealtiest people developed world.
2)Kill sick weak mindset. Germans need understand fully healthy worker lot productive less risk compared someone work everyday essentially sick longer, alas less productive make others sick too.

thank attending ted talk. Horses went bit trough felt like leaving cents. Highly doubt ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù going get this, especially since it‚Äôs like vaccines thaaat far off, it‚Äôs ridiculous say something like entire population catch first lol agreeing that, see people think person lives like healthy person one time think person actually healthy. goes lot risk factors like smoking, obesity. condition killed YET, mean won't. lot people struggle make connection reason. Thank you! death good people care vs bad people clearly give shit nice strawman. I‚Äôve same. think it‚Äôs fear-mongering acknowledge much easier get test March. People far aware testing accessible. I‚Äôve tested already I‚Äôll probably start working home. quoted first paragraph article. hard say. think much political it. think people appreciating fast spread without precautions.

you *need* lockdowns. wear goddamn mask. amazing things people think make money.

The American business multi level marketing. know ""massive"" compared countries. aging bud? healthy 17 year old get die, you. imagine one people stays denial moment flat line. There‚Äôs also this: Yeah definitely top. Really mod flagged it, commented said like ""When making claim, try link sources"" something along lines. hit NY already wave, know it. Health experts idea treat patients sick. learned, like think better treating hospitalized. evidence claim, articles ive seen noting changed would intubated, seems harm, turned people over, etc.  possible people seeking treatment earlier leading better outcomes? 
I hoping case. Although overwhelm hospitals TX, FL, AZ death rate could spike. Gee wonder could seen coming Yep, see time. feel guilty it, often like way journals report though, think discourages submitting corrections. often see notice one plastered front page, heading, caps, CORRECTION, followed something like - name reference misspelled, meant say figure 3B instead figure 3C, things much less important fact many crap papers published days. live FL problem people lost fear getting sick. first, seemed think got sick would really terrible act though common cold worst. Social distancing public shopping area completely ignored. 75% people see wear masks either. Two months ago everybody made sure keep apart probably 10% people saw grocery store masks. Wait.... think lockdown caused people die?! cant possibly think...  Yes definitely NSFW. made feel sick little bit saw. googling, saw NY times article it. ever find Chen Qiushi? broadcasting information people, especially want wear masks. video well edited dramatic music etc, buy appears footage real. Unbelievable. Take care People's vacations middle Management's egos forcing people backbto offices important lives others. Welcome America. simply true I've shown New York study saying saw improvement treatment actual data. moving goalposts. ""junk science"" put it. hard data study.

It's retrospective study relatively low numbers patients peer reviewed.

Don't oversell it. Iowa +389, VA +551, Md +350 early on. Iowa state watching closely. I'm 55 immune compromised. sister 65 immune compromised. husband 75, healthy 75, 75. sister thinks protective measures overblown, low mortality rate. mask social distance. goes quite bit, blame that. husband abusive. sister husband whole-heartedly embrace idea herd immunity. Let weak, annoying immune compromised die quit burden society [venting anger, unspoken message ""herd immunity""]. 

She says fine culled, I'm not. began, obtained new lease life felt like getting started. 

Here's thing. sister gets upset get together holidays. husband son wear masks presence. asked remove mine. reasoning it; tested negative [three weeks ago]. take mask. get hugs. really dangerous person around. cavalier attitude. emotional manipulation things better judgement. 

Personally, think someone going go ""full Monty"" thing expose completely, mixed gathering like family gathering, think cautious consideration others. wear mask asthma (this true, also entire attitude problem with, wear one plastic visors find work around respect sake getting together family, take precautions two three hours holidays.

Sorry long share. Thank telling story. thought one struggling sibling this. type 1 diabetes obesity significant risk factors. stop calling ‚Äúdebate‚Äù start calling ‚Äúdenial‚Äù?

There‚Äôs nothing debate. German meat factories closest sweatshops. working conditions shitty, pay bad often staffed immigrants sometimes even illegally. Nobody knows virus first came exactly IFR?

International Federation Robotics?

 *Instrument Flight Rules* (*IFR*) ?

instantaneous wave-free ratio? (iFR)

 Institute Food Research (*IFR*) 

Google lot choices. It‚Äôs frustrating lived hell hit us knew dealing with, everywhere else getting hit four months later they‚Äôre ignoring lessons paid blood. many it‚Äôs they‚Äôre ""too cool"", it‚Äôs don‚Äôt want hand anyone government sort info they‚Äôd they‚Äôve talked to. Almost average age US (40 38). Im wondering population healthier whole.... anyone know? Unless immunocompromised, go outside! Put mask, go park, sit awhile, wash hands get back. risk really small one maintain distance sidewalk stay outside buildings. wish would stop insisting dragging long possible, response US every bad word book, it‚Äôs ridiculous. Yeah, got lot Rush Limbaugh fans around parts. But, city 50% non-white. schools named confederate soldiers civil rights leaders.

Jacksonville murder capital Florida smallest police force per capita (of major cities).

Our schools notoriously underfunded pro-charter school mayor. mayor trying desperately privatize public institutions snuggle GOP darlings.

Our dominate industries Health Care Trade.

The event blocks away annual civil rights event commemorating Ax Handle Saturday.

This thing gonna shit show, mention don‚Äôt even enough beds house people.

Nobody wants come Jacksonville frankly kinda like way ;) Sorry, what‚Äôs RIVM? major reason I'm okay moving Nashville NYC August. People morons.

Eventually learn morons everywhere. gets complex try figure out. I'm genuinely surprised Sweden cares little people neighbors.

I expected US Sweden.

Norway tough financial spot. Read article maybe. many parts country experiencing single digit even 0 new cases daily even they‚Äôre right across border US

Does tell land border claim New Zealand necessarily true? Yeap idiots around still mock virus people concerned. people deserve catch see is. u contact trace 34000 people

You president anti-testing test/trace gets 34000 people. remember March outright told government wear masks (although that's excuse attacking someone). Obviously looking back, believing idiotic country hasnt wear masks outbreak decades many many people believed told. gay bar less relevant bar. 

Most gay bars earn highest earning June, Pride month. Heard uptick COVID-like symptom online searches Wuhan summer 2019. UK. left european union. I'd happy please ""It side, side!""

Could babyish? Why? People wear masks Finland, Denmark Norway. countries virus control. also recommended going cruises March 9. I‚Äôve never met Infectious Disease ‚Äúexpert‚Äù would recommend anyone going cruise...unless study floating Petri dish.

Fauci argued travel bans China. keep listing these, btw. assure you, throws word ‚Äúminuscule‚Äù reference coming virus, doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big deal. less China's reputation cheap products (which make sense context) CCP. They're desperate win, know look bad world's eyes, able say got first vaccine allow burnish reputation domestically globally, even months road take flak side effects something else sweep rug forget about. quite bad Broward Co. , county mayor enforcing mask rule shutting places comply. still dependent people assholes, partially successful. think 4700 includes people previously positive re-tested positive...but dashboard labels *new* Well mostly syphilis HIV ""scary"" ones syphilis easy go unnoticed. Legally, HIV, federal database every positive gets tested clinic health department. STDs, state specific. Generally, clinics doctors, etc. legally required report positive syphilis test, that's addition testing ourselves. that, report gets sent department assigned one us (the disease intervention specialists, DIS short), contacts positive case go there. course can't legally compelled give us information, that's part mentioned different comment, find odd I'm corona suddenly one wants tell anything STDs asking sexual partners holes using, people told everything. there, take whatever information gave us contacts try find get epi-treatment ensure get infected. that's pretty much it. Legally, works HIPPA. also access federal state records help us search, similar police would, usually medical info addition that. Go study Japan. Demanding impossible test conditions (a huge completely controlled human test population) ""prove"" point proof all. gray area. sliver common sense required. tobacco guys used argue cigarette smoking could proven cause cancer tests required prove causality opposed correlation ethically impossible. people knew anyway. 1300 cases now. Oh stupid wishing live life would like live Yet european reaponse virus seems coherent US response great quality content old he? I'm sorry say, United States essentially given up. States adamantly said lockdowns occurring many even impose mask mandates. Places like native Pennsylvania mask mandate convenience stores like Sheetz places like Lowe's enforcing all. Wait, Coronavirus develop symptoms less 1 day? something big happening last weeks? Vee shape yo. economy took hit recovery start ASAP. 

All haircut fools anti-maskers gonna drag next year. Masks 100%, definitely helping wearer. Call sick get tested. UK Let people Florida tell it, it‚Äôs hoax........ bad things there, thing could kind slow spread mandatory mask order. Seeing crowded places like Favela is, could much social distancing measures want, probably gonna delay inevitable. US' spread mostly choice due negligence, countries like Brazil India, gonna delay inevitable, though leader cares might help feel better that's all. Things control many South American countries well, there's little flatten curve. Well spreads introduce broader measures dies know crack harder sooner. Everyone think best nobody knowing study linked article does. Thank good health too! fair, feel reported case fatality rate makes sense given reported tests conducted. said, I'm skeptical reported tests conducted too. next time new descease comes around estimated death rate 2-3,4% (which february) hope Sweden go herd immunity directly. happens news Fake. one knows believe. 
Get act together MSM! 

Also, waited days post. one going believe 12 hours event already incubation im waiting someone disparage comment anecdotal. Mask usage need perfect convexity comes play. one saying over. CA bad shape think though. definitely difficult situation. seem like really care though, great. Unfortunately, truly good vaccine/treatment covid, problem remain. Agreed. school next year? county budget? would put banks under? see. Thanks! Republic Ireland... Separate countries administrations... Stands reason news made China end December likely already issue end November. probably part don‚Äôt generally get retracted, case autism one drew even attention article gave anti vaxxers even ‚Äúammunition‚Äù I'm sorry, U.S. essentially given up. Italian here. country wearing mask mandatory many weeks reopening resuming normal activities still hundred cases day. difficult understand everybody respect social distance wear mask? paradox us, free public health, care americans pay hundreds thousands admitted emergency room. feds left states handle....at point dont expext hear much task force unless either reference something big. Chi Chi's canned items e-coli cause entire chain go business? would think would foresight risks taking county 175k people 5 active cases. can‚Äôt stay endless paranoia. point cost maintaining stroct lockdown becomes harder potential reward. think loosening restrictions appropriate? detect sarcasm sir? Resistors fucking stupid detect subtle humor. Good luck you! good points. know could happen me, I'm young healthy take care myself. chances extremely slim I'll suffer lasting complications virus. possible I've even gotten already (a months ago symptoms went away day two) know sure. 

I'm downplaying significance virus, all. wear mask go outside part. tired fearmongering. visit sub occasionally old stories since March / April. People act like Black Plague. Exactly differently? Thank üòä article written someone took biology course thinks know everything. 

I‚Äôm little annoyed wasted time reading garbage. hey dont look way Well usually Germans. 

On pens. US whole fucked, look individual states see. New York example, really took control virus saw numbers go really low. Florida hand keeps spiking up. seasons sometimes feature second wave infections. cases, second wave distinct new surge cases strain flu different strain caused earlier illnesses.

First time (personally) seen idea virus needs change order ""qualify"" second wave. elderly paid insurance premium working years- premium benefits elderly. poor investing stesling insurance payments, complain shortages capital. insurance? Medicare, course. fault elderly running money, fault corrupt, inept, selfish politicians office decades. Thank likewise! May country continue stay ahead virus. ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm actually thinking moving France Austria next months, what's summer like there? enjoy summer Vienna bit quiet dead? need make friends enjoy life post-COVID (I'm 28). purest sense, journalism presents facts, opinions. Yurop politicians provide medical advice, discussed lockdowns physical distancing.

There lesson learned, US. study says immunity couple months. Please stop fear-mongering. wondering compare peak cases peak deaths looking two week lag time. time frame put deaths peaking towards fourth July unfortunately. Maybe bring nation's attention back onto pandemic. bastards. Every time... got plague. Take supplements pretend sick hell doctor prescribed dexamethasone masks look like garbage. certainly n95 caliber

for kind effort see amazon @TenYearsTenDays anyway? wasn‚Äôt pointing finger China I‚Äôm saying trump going point finger China... dialogue predictable. Yes quality facilities indigent folks usually abyssal article claims statement ""your mask protects me"" falsifiable later goes great detail conduct experiment around falsifiable. person even know falsifiable means, doubt know science is. NBA restart would successful took Covid hotspot. Well destroys European dream sold us Americans 20th June Brazil reported 50000 new cases, US reported 33,000, India reported 15,000. don‚Äôt understand people debating wearing mask.

Yes science says ""wearing mask protects others"" dogma provide evidence false.

This exact opposite dogma works .. 

The article provides zero counter evidence.

Do even hear yourself? almost common sense---when five mom told cover coughing... almost know intuitively covering helps prevent spreading germs. Well, ordinarily no. look behavior Americans US states mostly conservative populations. seems like want get it, they're fucking idiots. yeah, we're still reminding people *this joke*. Also lookbacks (not sure long least five years) make sure person didn‚Äôt give away assets person cough cash care. Either means bitching changing tune, mistyped meant crowding.

Maybe publishing numbers? Yeah, don‚Äôt know much states reopened believe it. know NJ‚Äôs currently phase reopening includes precautions like wearing masks, limiting number people places, distanced outdoor dining only, etc.

Salons open tomorrow, I‚Äôm 100% sure restrictions know exist. trying say thing. similar different.

I'm right even know there's pandemic bars beaches packed 99% wearing masks there's social distancing happening still hate Mariners happening play decently, Angels collapsed 11 game lead August 3rd, 1995. winning though, right?  Can't beat football give us good virus element.. posted sick coronavirus even news, partner came back (to Canada) California business said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably going get sick everyone office coughing hacking‚Äù. 

They fly hub office near LA meetings pre-Christmas-craziness get together/party. One colleague confided sick week, cough sounded awful. early December.

We assumed mild flu like virus. I‚Äôm wondering Covid-19 going around much, much, longer. many locations. Feb-May, need update Feb-June get closer end month. also need figure find year‚Äôs numbers deaths coded Alzheimer‚Äôs, stroke, heart attack, etc - I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs lot COVID-related death hidden numbers. likely catch me? likely die it? Europe also got infected true, unfortunately. means lot people die get vaccine. important know Portugal big amount cases, hospitalized going everyday testing massivily every contact. Numbers look alarming, situation pretty much control right now. massive testing, probability lot smaller. don‚Äôt hear anymore determined vitamin e acetate black market/non-regulated thc vaping liquids. couldn‚Äôt blame legally sold regulated nicotine liquids disappeared news. natural origin hypothesis major holes it. biggest high adaptation human cells without evolutionary track record yet discovered nature.

This befuddled virologists. Normally virus jumps species barrier, takes long time evolve efficient infectiousness host species. one appeared nowhere took running.

This would noteworthy anomaly even first appear city 1000 km away caves Yunnan related strains found.

Then stack oddities, fact said city virology lab actively studying strains Yunnan, probability lab escape becomes greater hypothesis.

There logical scientific reason disregard lab escape. confuses people experts observed signs gene splicing, gain function modifications necessarily entail gene splicing. virus altered breeding tissue cultures host species, example ferret tree shrew would viable candidates virus since human-similar lung ACE2 receptors. plenty published research accomplished. fact study influenza strain contagious humans made airborne contagious via ACE2 receptor (in exact way virus is) via passage 10 generation ferrets. study pubmed.

People denying possibility political reasons, fear losing funding virology research, since would likely big public backlash lab origin shown. institutes collaborate internationally wrath would limited China. Programs everywhere would implicated suffer consequences, hence virologists circling wagon ""natural origin, end story"" despite even locating source nature yet... seem scientific. matter? part ""I heard"" triggered rage? 

And never share AMP links. I'll assume never heard that... would argue chose initially issue, fact despite rapid appearance myriad evidence bad choice, chose stay course rather change strategy.

That's ""saving face"" became important ""saving lives"". might be. countries China likely go beyond ""sounding alarm"". likely go full Foxconn model build factories need develop competing product easily make billion of. Meanwhile, US, likely see finger pointing states, private sector, feds blame. cars expensive here

It's cars expensive, poor. Hard swallow. Meh. It‚Äôs going get flat.

Wear god damn mask. everything you. like winter. Stay home. mask shortage, although part it. 

Masks problematic people wear properly. also give false sense security potentially increasing transfer via contaminated surfaces. Last week watched 20 people 30 minutes grab mask (dirty) pocket, put casually, grab door handle. 

We know much COVID spread contact infected surfaces (we still don't, exactly-- lower risk close personal contact). Touching mask laden virus grabbing door handle could disaster-- know time risky was. commit atrocities make Nazi Germany look like Vatican.

I mean... Vatican really shining example morality. Well don‚Äôt pay back 25 large borrowed they‚Äôre gonna break shins Richmond Hey, I'm Wisconsin totally wrong. say Alabama North. say Mississippi North - Wississippi. 

Alabama...sheesh. I'm sorry loss. absolutely way biggest public-health crisis generation.

Obese people shorter lifespan average age someone dying Covid-19. 99 percent people survive whereas close half Americans obesity now. Plus obesity negatively affects abilities longer portion life.

Also seen recent increase suicide, alcoholism, drug overdose deaths. 190,000 per year Covid number gone since shutdowns. number doesn‚Äôt include people don‚Äôt overdose drugs die diseases caused drug abuse. number countless. since kills much younger people average Covid-19, average death takes far life Covid-19 death, devastates young families, affects victim itself, also often young children left without parent period time need most. health, education, earnings outcomes children single parent households tend poor starts chain misery.

Covid isn‚Äôt even close largest threat lifespans. even end first quarter. Less 1% American population confirmed COVID. Double asymptomatic people never show signs 2%. even know antibodies last. fuck yeah...!

Its trump pushed drug, hes also antivaxxer btw posted lot happened due similarities stories China: nypost.com/2020/04/07/retired-nyc-cop-with-coronavirus-symptoms-dies-after-leaving-hospital/amp/

Note April, post-NYC shutdown. Since NYC hard hit shut pretty much everything, it‚Äôs hard know common sort thing would everything open place covid running rampant. guess we‚Äôll find open states, though. :/ would think covid numbers deaths America, people would use critical thinking see limits short-term would help long term? mean, so, health safety, beaches closed till infection rates slow opposed thinking 'noone tell do. right go go beach'.

Just like ""caravans"" midterms everyone, pretty large percentage looks like basically lot people wearing masks social distancing? minority cases may 49%. I'm saying that's is, declaratively say that's case. limited amount data positive - absolutely data runs counter long-term complications sizeable percentage infected. 

Again, enough data make declarative statement one way other, prevalence long-term damage. data worrisome (some small case studies extensive research SARS-1) - case studies, data collected says otherwise (that infected long-term health damage). mean asking someone feel, means CT Scans checking blood/oxygen levesl, etc.

I run stores yesterday almost everybody wearing mask, maybe 90%. increase rate. 

India expected rise much faster USA due higher population much higher population density.

Week 4- bacteremia Thanks, good explanation 4.5 metres people would consider ""close contact"".

TL;DR avoid prolonged periods sharing enclosed space people ever grow 200 cases day 2000 cases day first time? mean chance low never happened first place right? Putting everything back normal 200 cases day spread like even worse becuase first peak lessened lockdown. 

What US 15 cases mean mathematical model (which nonsense) disappeared like Trump said going over.

It's individual chance running someone covid-19 much individual covid-19 spread locally reproduction rate virus. 

If put everything back normal nothing reproduction rate virus goes back somewhere 2 6. Lets take best case secnario say R (reproduction rate) 2.

With ""ONLY 200 cases"" R 2 course one month 200 grows factor 64 12800 cases. 

The way lower R isolate cases testing contact tracing, social distance wear masks (the last two lower chance asymptomatic transmission).

Even precautions place counties Michigan right R 1 (like one in). reason R lower 1 people wearing masks social distancing every time someone doesn;t things raise chance R go back one virus begin spreading again.

I'm saying US well could, average American should, past that, many following advice guidance people they're supposed able trust.

Far many conflating American people organization government bodies power. like blaming ""Chinese people"" CCPs actions. really expect much else site seems heavy hate America literally can't stop talking it, ever. US safety net allows us get sick lose job without creeping towards bankruptcy FWIW, millions us taking extremely seriously. Unfortunately since lot idiots idiot cultures lack education country, they‚Äôre fucking everybody else up. companies forcing employees work firing cutting pay. refusal part legislatures ever created safety net people situation like this, either expose risk COVID go without ability feed children. 

It feels like one actually care, I‚Äôm fortunate live state Governor made masks mandatory. even don‚Äôt care choice. governor also made us shut earlier vast majority states. amazing political party Trump. become politicized country.


But anyway, agree. feel helpless here. American spends time America..

People US need wear masks. TBF Sunday holiday. shocking see lower number today bigger lag spike tomorrow. mean... live AZ, is, without much doubt, worst position anywhere US, quite people still believe we've made mistake. much evidence antibodies stay body 7 months? sounds pretty unlikely would see level spread December, case would need bigger study find it. Well, part purpose counties are. They're local administrations, handle things like public schools, local road maintenance, library systems (though sometimes town/city level, depends county), local courts (parking tickets, traffic violations misdemeanors small claims civil court, serious crimes typically handled state level), mundane things like that. 

They're set never needed prevent travel county borders. state governments; anything, nearly everything past 100 years set make moving states easier, harder (hence massive infrastructure investments interstate highway system).

To add that, freedom movement huuuuuge deal US law, many contentious issues past relating it. example, WWI 1918 enacted ""Travel Control Act"" might require checking passports moving states active wartime. caused *huge* furor outrage, especially lingered 1921 re-used WWII, often brought example tyrannical government overreach. requiring check passports moving states, actually stopping people moving them. 

Likewise, several Supreme Court decisions held government cannot restrict right travel without due process. probably proof 100% perfect 100% time still way better even making attempt. Sunday, reporting always low Sundays. read? cared making look good.  Yes. articles almost always seem centered around ""suspicion"" conveniently discuss unlikelihood true. 


As mention, much understand behavior history virus overturned stories like true. agree. tricky though perception issue sides. Yes, residents feel safe walking street crack enforce guidelines, would mean sidewalk dining, hurting businesses (even though couple tables make break restaurant, increased takeout would honestly beneficial). Slow opening started couple weeks ago. story equivalent private light airplane crashed graveyard, hundreds dead! food shortage. Americans throw away food every day humanity could eat day history. 

There distribution problems certain specific non essential items. caused overly speculative, hyper fragile, bottom line based food distribution network America. consider major threat national security much population would starve death (living fertile farm land -that grows corn cows) couldn‚Äôt source outside state. 

Thousands Americans going die didn‚Äôt need culture lack discipline communal sense good. guess panicking Sara Lee sweet ham us important people. Florida man here, confirm. patients coming clinic wear mask, pull talk even cough (its ok though, smokers cough /s). Like.. that's need wear most?? People think learn history learned history. Intentional sabotage. else new? response feds virus: sabotage make people die. Fuck them. Yeah, he's also scientist, overstated probability success, subsequently blew face, company would lose credibility. think would put high number really believe would work. America see million deaths this. every war 20th Century combined. virus also shuts electricity sends us back 50s? god, worse thought. warning needs taken seriously seems authorities job.

The number cases low easily spike outbreak looks worse probably is. Yeah keep rising catch up... imagine 20 canaries coal mine dropping simultaneously 20 different places

Edit: caution Yeah Brazil *Brazil* world... Slightly different vibe. Thats 7. 

3,87 % Employee 3,78 % employer.

So doubt 14 % total Germany.  It‚Äôs sad, it‚Äôs people live. give people choice, especially EASIER choice... always take it. literally thousands times history show trend.

‚ÄúNot mandatory‚Äù translates ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to‚Äù. shouldn‚Äôt expect people wear them; shift conversation experts tell us doing. Lol like Europe woods lol lol No, weekly UV anal probe light kill virus. We're much better job locking isolating seniors immune-compromised citizens, showing lower death rate. 

States also shifted way deaths reported. including excess death rates, either, nationally running 60K+ normal. would imply true death rate actually like 180K, 120K.

We two days new infection rates 33,000. Things trending worse, shit going drag lot longer needed to. US really lost plot this. LA/OC surging. I'm NorCal, yea probably still safe. Guess I'll wait weeks see plays out. Still actively does.

In places, reported ""pneumonia"" deaths 10 times higher historical averages, yet counted Covid lack testing.

The 100k number, already terrible, also big sham.  specifically related hot spots meat packing industry nothing general public. don‚Äôt understand isn‚Äôt brought conversation more. want compare US Europe, accurate treat state separate country. 330 mil people US. surprising cases deaths Italy. NY still awfully, all. Comparing US whole situation justice Murica. Dick move, feels bit irrelevant sub it? think also didn‚Äôt help came transmission outside wasn‚Äôt bad thought was. People took mean immune outside. I‚Äôm always yelling roommate wear mask outdoors. always wear indoors. Yeah, copy protesters do. cost. Standard living Shit America compared 1st world country first saw headline, brain went go ‚ÄúTulsa Rally HANDS‚Äô Scientists Test Case‚Äù thought... well don‚Äôt really need hand‚Äôs scientist see small are. likely many pre-symptomatic people, would contageous provide evidence vast majority experts agreeing pandemic started wet markets, I'm engaging

Find anything shows pandemic started significant numbers anywhere else then. seen pangolin shit everything else, pandemic bare minimum epicenter wet market makes little sense arguments. 

Anyways, said, hate pedants. annoys fuck me. Goodbye. Masks work. already studies comparing different regions Germany masks became mandatory one week delay one city introduced ~3-4 weeks early. 

It somewhere around 10% less infections remember correctly. much coke hookers really mess life. Yeah think people realizing dire situation Florida. governor still approved budget begins July 1st. We've lost hundreds millions dollars sales tax. Also, Florida incredibly diverse region region vast majority cases Miami Jacksonville areas recall. really awful reopen much state. Think cop even drunk driver tases you, you‚Äôre suppose let go intervene later somehow - cops ain‚Äôt risking jobs jail time Karen chad don‚Äôt want wear mask. Get ready see violence increase reckless behavior due trump making shit worse cop witch hunt making impossible work I'm surprised see big 2nd wave yet across Europe.

We went lockdown mid march til early may...since people started behaving like nothing happening more. 

While might wear mask shopping also meet parks private grillparties i'm really surprised shown much. 

In shops people working even using masks anymore public transporation number ppl wearing one going lot, too

Not sure got superlucky ""silence storm"" CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT INFRINGE HEALTH!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Long short Clorox.

\*No, that's actual investment advice. mentioned rare death, idea many sick? relatively mild symptoms asymptomatic? would one issue think keeping plant open, significant percentage workers sick work week more. I‚Äôm right you. I‚Äôm actually mandated quarantine waiting test results started symptoms last week, contacted supervisor work felt significant enough require testing. far symptoms mild (feels like minor cold moment moving chest), coworkers high risk though work medical office. results come back negative, fantastic overly cautious. positive hopefully hadn‚Äôt exposed enough contract yet. That‚Äôs insane... u said absurd it‚Äôs crazy you‚Äôd even say it. 10k year half taxes (I make 80-90k/year Canada).. tell 2-3k goes health care I‚Äôd say sure that‚Äôs reasonable way half taxes... I‚Äôm saying without knowing much taxes go healthcare. Also.. thinking paying 20k taxes insane... justify get back ""Congratulations! We're allowing get money already earned!"" Yeah, like article grilling dozen teens beach, COVID suddenly exists protests. edit, say things like people, even anonymous Reddit. know it‚Äôs diagnostic could shown levels dropping could call dr ask thoughts. It‚Äôs 9 days since started. went walking close two hours day kids (some neighborhood wooded ‚Äúhikes‚Äù) step outside go half block I‚Äôm gasping. two degrees higher normal twice 9 days.
I cough lot use marijuana medicinally likely cough. 

I wear mask everywhere makes breathing like million times worse always wear it.
If becomes hard breath one won‚Äôt go ha. 
Thank reply. Yes, exactly. Thank expanding :) immoral, crisis shows us much value college football brings universities players deserve cut. Yeah, definitely varies wildly. Sunday, 21st June, number dead coronavirus Ukraine gotten thousand people.  evidenced data published SNBO website.  8 people died past 24 hours. overall number fatalities grown 1002 Ukrainians.  start epidemic, largest number Ukrainians died Chernovitskaya Oblast - 171 people. Lviv Oblast second place - 114 Ukrainians. Kiev third place - 98 fatalities.  lowest number fatalities Khersonskaya (three people) Sumskya (five people) Oblasts.  related news, number infected Ukraine grown morning Sunday, 21st June. disease confirmed 735 Ukrainians past 24 hours. largest number infected discovered Lviv Oblast - 101 people.  also written Cabinet publishing directive extend adaptive lockdown 31st July. Massive increase abattoir. Maybe time COVID, historically don‚Äôt think Israel+accountability two words used sentence lol argument moment - unchecked, coronavirus spread exponentially.

If state spike, overwhelm hospitals, curves, would proven wrong - necessity lockdowns whole called question.

But, I've assured, exponential. happen. typical Scottsdale idiot amount testing anywhere else. critical staying open. news article outdoor dining, particular town. close proximity pedestrians (in violation state guidelines) tables concern, risk properly distanced outdoor dining. I've following since similar report made NYC Gov Cuomo back early May regards younger patients dying COVID showing none common flu-like symptoms. essentially going TSS/ cardiac arrest.

Assuming coroners blood samples remaining dating back late 2019, I'm curious means possibility find antibodies samples (I told 2 labs test blood within 7 days drawn). article basically saying otherwise? I'm asking brother unexpectedly died mid-November took coroners almost 6 months finally come conclusion SADS Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome. went sleep didn‚Äôt wake up- 26 years age, known prior health issues whatsoever/ Non smoker. regards family history, never experienced losing someone young (most relatives sides lived 80s-90s)

For context - spent 5 days NYC November 1 week death. people stayed NYC exposed getting anti-body test April. lived worked Bay Area. 

I visited found multiple reports study SADS COVID-19 published March/April. I've also spoken cardiologist asked coroner's place hold blood samples given I'm finding difficult get touch anyone test this. anyone additional insight would extremely interested get front involved testing cases died mysterious causes prior public knowing COVID. assuming shit, that's typical mental illness behavior, take medication today getting REDDIT?

Also 9 years old moved USA, also realize cut limit experience go mate, relax enjoy football  Nah man, Germans become extensively careless. People barely adhere standard measures anymore, meet privately time... we're still better US whole big bunch, let's feed rumor mills pretending countries struggling thing. NZ absolute outlier. Miami-Dade huge retiree communities. good.  one cares. people empathy. ""Fuck you, got mine."" mentality full effect years now. getting worse. Healthcare for-profit US, gotta wonder that's win many people. dad sent pic church went 'anyone wearing masks? state top five worst cases' goes 'nope.' Contrast US ‚Äúleader‚Äù laughed flu said would disappear June. 

April. said ""by April."" reasoning wearing mask make sense. There's risk overwhelming hospitals told fear.  

We know actual mortality rate (it's 8% 5% like 0.2%), vulnerable, protect them. Eh like üë®‚ÄçüöÄüë∑üëÆüïµÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏èüë®‚Äçüî¨üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë®‚Äçüîßüë®‚Äçüè≠üë®‚Äçüöíüë®‚Äçüåæüë®‚Äçüè´üë®‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüíºüë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüë®‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüé§üë®‚Äçüé®üë®‚Äçüç≥üë≥üßïüë≤üë∂üßíüßëüßì

(for might know, means much greater than.) Obsessed putting mildly. US going suppress people stop protesting. media told 1200 scientists Ok‚Äôed us go outside Yo, can't posting logic like that.

50 teens beach = bad

1,000s people protests everyday = good

Don't see COVID see racism too.

EDIT: oops forgot drop this, /s UT Austin makes $1 billion year sports program doesn‚Äôt pay athletes. Ad hominems probably help address cognitive dissonance. source explicitly disagrees you, that's got hurt. course never admit idiot, evidence us see. Maybe read conversation tomorrow panties bunch. Lets keep way! Hydroxychloroquine based hype science.

Since learned COVID-19 vascular disease respiratory one. Blood clots major feature people severe cases. What's causing blood clots, prevent them? doctors might figured out. Roughly half federal budget social security Medicare. say spend money people bullshit. ""The war Christmas"" Ditto comment. listing best case. soubdike taking possible precautions. keep mental health mind too. think kind think critically pandemic (something Americans notoriously great at). CDC pretty much failed us every juncture.  mean point lock downs? let virus run course? hate shifting goalposts that's happening know well isn‚Äôt immunity, can‚Äôt stay closed virus magically goes away. immunity theory supports US now. don‚Äôt buy it, myself. drugs on? 

Compare random day January year vs. Netherlands. huge decrease close contact (no big events, working home, keeping distance people) huge increase hygiene (mainly washing hands). made us (and many countries) flatten curve. 

And fewer infected people, also fewer people spread disease. exponential curve working advantage. 

If honestly believe current situation luck, bad news regarding level intelligence... HEB partners wear masks, except overnight people people outside pushing baskets. *from understand, overnight people wear near future*

Source: [Am HEB curiosity, forced kick tobacco habit? 

What‚Äôs fancy - smokes? smokeless tobacco (for reason), still tobacco products delivered right door, (incidentally) buying certain items bulk save piles cash. example, make cigarettes (complete attached filter) premium tobacco, less $2 pack, including shipping, they‚Äôre much better Dunhill reds Nat Sherman‚Äôs classics (also red box) used smoke. Takes five minute per pack.

Pipe tobacco (real pipe tobacco) bulk much cheaper, too.

Don‚Äôt get started wonderful snuff is, stuff hasn‚Äôt detrimental health effects associated five hundred years (seriously)! it‚Äôs pretty much mail order only, though, stupid government regulations screwing everything reason, like quarantine. Unless live south.

Chaw dip make friend state it‚Äôs much cheaper, send ‚Äúbirthday card‚Äù. Deaths lag behind cases US beginning upwards trend cases again. Gwen Graham gotten nomination instead,could beated DeSantis? Also, Gillum, think turned dissapointment, think Flordia weird way, dodged bullet. Yep gay hooker drug addict   Good luck efforts make happen.  Also, commented public forum. makes business whomever reads wishes reply. spokesperson Dole said email, ‚ÄúFrom conversations CCCHD maintain plant likely source transmission closure warranted.""

Ah, course! 25% plant testing positive time nothing worry larger sample Ohio 25% people currently virus. Right?! /s  I've there.

Where Chen Qiushi? Well along Falls Road across West Belfast, Derry, alot pubs closed voluntarily coming st Patrick's day. government hadnt mandated closing took precedent southern counterparts. 
The parade Belfast also cancelled,iirc.

I'm pretty sure contributed well cities coped therefore rest province. 

I'm pretty impressed our, usually flailing, government right now. Haha make sense. would need left bit shift, amount money increases number people! swaths US population make sacrifice whatsoever, matter situation. Anything gets way need constantly consume instantly gratified, even consideration. less good absolutely unthinkable them. truly nation. think sounds terrible, incredibly realistic. Qatar badly hit. infection rate roughly 4x higher US (per million population). U right. literally ROFL Tbh, I‚Äôm surprised. something like three weeks, Germans gone disciplined Corona fighters, something like Florida man. May ask why? Yep, walk around downtown Toronto- masks social distancing, although say Sobeys stores excellent job customers employees wearing masks, social distancing, disinfecting carts asking every customer sanitize hands wife done homeschooling, private, online public schooling kids. learned lot faster homeschooling tested higher placement tests.. helps wife good teaching grammar, spelling language arts. mind built numbers.

Online schooling close second available help free time since online schooling takes much less time private public able go outside fun. 

In end let kids pick method want. 

Anyways point is, works well done right. Nothing like forced work. It‚Äôs really shitty America spend much money war second need money people can‚Äôt it. see bit word ""edit"" addressed possibility misinterpreted? Scroll back up, see already pieced little puzzle together. Thank guidance though coder155ml, invaluable contribution Internet stringing together here. lot European countries are. FYI, money monopoly money seems silly *its Thank ordered 4. That's rest group spent whole time corner sucking glue really younger people refusing wear masks? data results clearly show Cuomo taken virus seriously able help state get problem control, whereas DeSantis taken virus seriously, hence problem control. implying know people responding riots? Okay get everyone disagrees clue they're talking about. Grow kid slope starts flatten begin rise late May. time start protests. Imagine that. Enough fake outrage media. Reddit said economy going affected badly affected without lockdown. takeaway never take economic advice biased redditors.

But Reddit said every lockdown countries going crush economy yet Denmark, Finland, Norway better Sweden.     
And reddit said Sweden would save crisis like nothing happened yet they're going ""the worst recession since World War II"".     
The takeaway never take economic advice biased redditors. *its Actually, Cape Town South Africa open testing policy tried community screening testing, ended 2 week backlog means hospitals know patients staff meaning everyone must suspected backfires.

So yea, limited money, expertise, access reagent environment testing destroy Covid response. test high risk hospital staff essentially. works, people get quickly. know prepare things? must another Europe, one live countries rising numbers, like mine. 

Protests, large parties type bs's led this. AZ Texas never really peak first place this. Eh Americans across board make money European counterparts. difference good healthcare isn‚Äôt accessible everyone. becoming reality won‚Äôt change salaries. order beer wings @ hooters important restart economy! Yep, fucked communication big time. NL can‚Äôt tell people one thing point, something else another point. Scientific evidence masks actually work still downplayed. It‚Äôs highly frustrating. need better worker's rights livable wage. care home pay CNA $8/HR, going get lazy people. I'm saying CNA's lazy. hard get good people Target pays $15/HR Walmart pays $12/HR. CNA dead-end job. least Target, advance. Shit, even LPNs make much care homes. know make $13/hr. care homes hire RN want pay them. 

You want good people? need pay them.  wife often says I'm German Germans.

Now get started Geography History.

Your average American find Germany map Germany. :)_ EU population twice size US idiots say anything That's rest group spent whole time corner sucking glue   products spread virus? Dunno UK gets lumped US here. anywhere close perfect response nonetheless death registrations nearly back normal levels UK shows UK manage deal good ol‚Äô america, supressing minorities since birth pandemic Really don‚Äôt see anyone saying second wave US. Wave one even reached it‚Äôs worst yet face covering better face covering, protecting others. I'm sure there's political intent behind post  /s. Open ‚Äòer Up!! - Gov Abbott Yep, that's imo bigger problem. spreads fast gets opportunity so. average. nations? ignoring DFW, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Atlanta*

Is Texas really part South? opinion data results speak competency job. So, say want regards initial hotspot...but data tells far dire story job well done. 

I would fired numbers showed terrible results job. you‚Äôre going fairly judge, look states numbers claiming success. I‚Äôm glad hear that. friend PA, lives state now. Every time posts anything coronavirus respecting wearing masks, tons PA friends going nuts comments, it‚Äôs fake, masks kill people, Governor dictator depressing freedoms. hope type people minority there. 2 months understatement. left school spring break, never came back, I‚Äôve left house maybe 5 times since then. Can‚Äôt believe far down. US isn‚Äôt great, compare us group countries many people dying much higher rate US? Didn‚Äôt black dude really weird stuff? Like gay hooker weird stuff.... app NY? glad university country.

Nothing Columbia nation, can't fly international right now. evidence happening case? really can't say conclusively though. yet come across comprehensive study lays long-term symptoms, commonality, durations, patterns, distribution. 

For time being, safest position assume worst actual data point to. Cases Fairly meaningless statistic 
ESP amongst kids

Herd immunity bust

The protests riots ended pandemic This. Cheltenham - disgrace still held it. still stuns people flying Italy thousand March April, went races three days.

They fucking knew.

There upper middle class ski twats know EXACTLY did.  Lol what? Okay guess 

Was bit drunk commented really dramatic definitely right Donald Pump co. utilizing tax payer money support colleagues, look Munich hiding $600B payment protection programs went. 

but, honestly think testing facilities overwhelmed amount testing flowing them, backlog tests right now, cause obviously test kits important testing facilities... One theory Corona spreads via droplets cold, dry, wind. exactly climate meat factories conserves meat. reason virus spread every employee luckily much outside factory.

Meat-factories (hopefuly) high hygiene standards respect meat quality. is, unfortunately, employee health. far know, meat factory recalled. means, even though quasi every employee got sick, meat seems safe, i.e., ""high hygiene standard"". Wheere Tarrent County, hospilzation rate? Gatlinburg, TN Despite somewhat big number, I'd still say controlled considering cases single area spiking places thing lot believe got flu test came back negative strains. impossible tell truth, one knows work. assessment. say inevitably fail really true, trial data yet. Yes, Trump locked entire US. Ireland tiny irrelevant tax population smaller many cities. subway, little international transit road rail links outside island superrrr immunocompromised. Weeee!! think chance succeeding something increases amount effort thing. two months 

Try 3+ Maine? know is, small restrurants make great food, scale bigger scale, impossible adjust fit change setting. /s flu. Cmon guys ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è evidence side,   going slow testing numbers go down

it's like scene Idiocracy, 4 years ago told friends true enemy Trump voters Enlightenment. stand statement. keep hearing this. get antibody test negative. people rarely get flu mistake common cold flu. flu kicks ass. Last year sitting 104 fever able move week cause flu. healthy guy late 20s. point feels purposeful. Maybe beginning made sense. doesn't. inconvenient, gonna happen.

when said would flatten curve, meant keeping flat stable, decreasing. Schools reopening scares most. identified severe strain COVID hit Europe New York. increased contact schools reopened fear children disproportionately affected Fall. Ain't gonna lie serious, scary shit. Two things bad I'd argue north america also island. said fuck you? person literally said enjoy hugging family everyone downvoted talked crap. said need hugs people downvoted hate it. People idiots. honestly difficult pick favorite two way communicate others without physical presence. kind ‚Äútelephone‚Äù Wow, similar choices!

I UK, thinking moving next 2-3 years. Choices moment Canada, Japan, Norway, Sweden, New Zealand Singapore.

Mostly thinking Canada Norway though. looked Canada seriously though (express entry). Probably happen Sweden without lockdown.

 US hospitals stayed empty months end. 

In fact [1.4 million healtcare workers lost jobs height state? Quarter OC always worn face masks, UCI campus. It‚Äôs learned behavior developed country origin! Selling Eating bats thing country too.

Didn‚Äôt wear mask visited country. Don‚Äôt want virus forcing wear one country.

Was shocked learn (not really) 1 3 first cases CA getting treatment UC med ctr. surprising given OC population diversity rates. I‚Äôm US citizen, resident Switzerland spent three months stuck quarantine San Diego, back Switzerland again.

San Diego whole much better job terms response mask compliance. one anything Switzerland. Switzerland feels much generally ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô livability perspective.

My view long first hand look places dramatic difference impact, intensity places vast psychological gulf. 

Switzerland basically decided return normal. US decided eat alive. Why? LA County one biggest spikes country right now. 0.5% deaths 328 million thousands more, 1.6 million people (although June 2020 120k already gone), imagine could easily even double US due obesity lack access healthcare. fair herd immunity kick around 50-60% population infected drastically slow infection rate. suspect militarised populace inevitably leads militarised police. Better either. AL SC major young people positive increases traced back frat parties bar hopping. .,,, words typical early 20-30s behavior 

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs also related younger people filling lot customer facing retail restaurant jobs. Well lie everyone masks Exactly. politics, play it, play too. governments engaging pissing wars, common people gets screwed. Stop it. sound like trump. buff glasses soap place tissue along top mask air escapes glasses stop fogging up. Yes borders precedent prevent people crossing country country, US made states nothing really stop moving one other. Yeah, quite window type person thinks. major own-goal side post one imo.  Still, 188K deaths Europe vs 120K US. Time look metrics matter, maybe pandemic passed Europe, managed criminally countries. I‚Äôll take living crappy freedom day week anyway Bloody hell. knew bad USA bad. Poor people fight two things once.
The virus president's insanity. Yup. amount folk asking haircut vulnerable category. Vain selfish people. rush fellas bigger issue. still insisting opening things even first wave people already giving up? seems asinine virus still keep chugging along since damned stupid contain properly. recommend CDC become relevant fight COVID-19. foot infection sure, go regardless. fair, I'm old anyway. avoid inside places possible, whatever law says. Outside, I'm fairly confident we're OK here. got source?  Yeah that's what's fascinating outbreaks happening - see locking literal bodies streets even could see saying covid deaths homeless met end.  


So guess get see happens put controls highly contagious virus? really isn't. Sounds like something Americans say comfort themselves. haven't. least UK. Ok fine. protests represent probably .01% virus spread, get much attention seems like spreading it. I'd wager since memorial day people given staying side went full throttle frolicing. It‚Äôs likely simple: median age infection going down, younger healthier populations far lower death rate COVID older/unhealthier populations. People going believe low risk serious illness. young people working ""obsolete info"" here, really think wishful thinking behalf people. Yup, Merkel working morale/image side (she's one national address, though president also one), coordinating EU working recovery packages since that's also national government issue (shared states, though states also stimulus packages). even current stimulus package, really forefront, SPD prominent since managed get lot things wanted. Everyone's job, tbh. 

Lmao yes, though guess city states kinda confusing? Berlin people 22 US states! Bremen Wyoming. way less area lmao. they're still full-blown states let know.  mean expect happen sudden policymakers mainstream media decided social distancing guidelines preventing coronavirus needed take backseat social justice reform, encouraged actions.

You think it‚Äôs coincidence young people coming symptoms 2-3 weeks later?? moved UK US teens. feel like life probably better would UK work ass it. cousins live look like nice comfortable lives moderate work load. Sometimes seems nice think mindset American life point. Okay. Denmark needs solve period comma issues. mixing things up. unit mean another home entirely. different types care home depending need. obvious distinction residential vs. nursing, there's also third one patients severe cognitive issues makes consistently violent. tend much staff rights forcefully restraint, locked keycoded doors etc. 

A resident committed manslaughter would 100% moved residential unit. 

So completely different thing care homes deal COVID. Dr. Fauxi exposed. lied needing masks.  GOt negative results turns foot infection Again, talks government competent. Trump tells is. believe Trump infectious disease specialist. literally range best case scenario experts. 

There absolutely nothing would make happy number in-patient hospitalizations COVID-19 Friday reached 1,938, 368 COVID-19 patients ventilators 546 ICU beds, department reported. Friday‚Äôs count 1,164 emergency room visits COVID-19 also set record.

From limited understanding seeing North East deaths fall rate rest US goes up. looks flat, really large decrease one area large increase everywhere else.

People say *""Look numbers flat!""* places like Arizona started June 20k cases, 50k, trend continues run hospital space July 4th, everyone expects major spreading event. Thank you! I've wearing contacts frequently, generally would prefer wear glasses, especially work. situation getting worse there, better. going put exponential growth full effect country. left shop I'm pretty sure Dad people wearing masks. people going reason keep getting cases. That's cool really want get brain poked.  Sounds familiar Y'all realize delaying inevitable, right? Unless willing world stay Phase 1 3 years (which world's economy food suppoly survive) vaccine developed, tested, administered 80% population, every going get infected it. sooner better. realize hospitals get overloaded consumers basically lock regardless government says? like mine too? Minnesota still declining cases, please stop blaming increase protests bars, restaurants casinos open nobody wearing masks inside love god ""Quarantine lifted, virus still here, masks must"" enforce mask anymore wear them...

Lol, Netherlands seen 10 people masks since pandemic started. I'm North tho never got bad here. could infection arterial walls generating blood clots, travel heart brain cause heart attack stroke.

Blood clotting common COVID, COVID patients clotting [5.4x likely patients without observed clotting. Direct person person infection much common surface infections, outdoor option, try keep windows (a crack good car) open fresh air dilute viral droplets air reduce likelihood infection. Take care fine though. hospitals never faced issues nation did


And Italy‚Äôs death rate 573.1 per million compared US‚Äôs 373.3 per million. Worked industry many years... unfortunately industry operates razor thin margins... Dole closes doors would likely gone business... stay open least jobs stay (along health insurance employees families). 

Produce 3rd world countries made almost impossible American companies compete operating home turf...  doesn‚Äôt help, confirms I‚Äôve saying. acted earlier...against advice certain infectious disease expert. matters. outdoor markets quite good spreading though. Thailand banned reason. Thanks info. IIRC Japan done well recoveries well little deaths compared rest world? it‚Äôs two studies, granted one going peer review. many studies want. 

And strong precedent among corona viruses. early stages COVID. Hold congratulations know congratulated shunned. EU member even exactly feel entire situation. I'm still part people giving convenient interest anymore. fucking insane. recommend want, still going back office. meant geographical south, specific: Southern California big cities Texas New Mexico. good career opportunities like weather.

I mean ""The South"" Texas, Florida, Delaware anything between. It‚Äôs probably horrible idea wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing US corona corona politics Reddit people actually discuss stuff. suppose wouldn‚Äôt popular though since big one. They‚Äôve gotta start minimum letting discussions happen it‚Äôs government statements decisions! confirm them? Ah yes, tests. Therefore, dividing deaths tests ignoring people tested. I‚Äôve keep hearing don‚Äôt enough separate units covid vs non-covid violent vs non-violent, yet every solution hear involves loving patient isolated unit... like magically expanding units never run out? timeline virus, early enough. intelligence agencies pushing China January Europe February. That‚Äôs similar 3/19 New Zealand‚Äôs virus timeline. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* need text. many people never check voicemail Sweden ok, number cases increased recently testing high risk cases started testing mild cases too. may US, know enough comment it. 7 day moving average means data lags 3.5 days. tick worse looks. We‚Äôre Florida, even Florida country. Carelessness citizens yes, people get sick it. However reopening phased measured timed properly everything closely monitored authorities. pretty much European country I've seen impact basic compentence government, contrast lack competence US government.

And doubt European countries reintroduce measures looks like we're spiking. South?? feeling OC never South. It‚Äôs extreme poverty, oppressively humid, part void well paying jobs.

*Completely ignoring DFW, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Atlanta*

Either haven‚Äôt ‚Äúbeen south‚Äù, drove small towns/the worst states used generalize everywhere. Europe stopped testing. workers go home expose families? 

Don't workers go shopping work days expose shoppers?

Don't workers' families go expose others?

For 1000+ workers infected, must significant time original infectees infect family/friends/neighbors/strangers... Thanks dude. I'm gonna try month thing get back me.

Worst case I'm probably gonna move Oakland. Feels like great time start new lease  think steroids used Kawasaki immediately respond IVIG. That's change Anti-Vaxer rally Florence. British people tell they're really European they're island own. think that's I'd call hilarious. Exactly. Except ""failing"" means thousands people dying. Steroids caused bone necrosis SARs patients. great treatment. California got right. Plenty people saw coming. Cuomo alone fucking up, fucked none less. I'm sick people giving pass. 9th grade group project, ended one person. stay night measurements moon write report it. partner work turned pretty much identical work. got got D. Still idea got time later. Hey, know useless wanted wish good luck. sorry luck rely on. 

This situation sucks, wish meet kid sane conditions. I've countries like Bolivia Argentina change scarce gave pieces candy instead.

Honestly, small businesses, I'd happy round closest nickel next month so. prob. put entertaining thank sign checkout. Home Depot better give damn change though. buy calls U.S. cases? Governor state Florida basically washed hands responsibility huge PowerPoint recommended CDC procedures saying individual school district figure want do. basically teachers students start die blame superintendents district failing implement impossible policies. truly going interesting year. Found kid wearing mask socially distancing! It‚Äôs going depend people die well. there‚Äôs someone dying isn‚Äôt removed step certified official covid19 death state level without going least three levels paperwork/offices. 

It may death - doctor - hospital administrator - county official- state official. take weeks nursing home death added official count. Deaths aren‚Äôt reported second last breath taken. 

Hell, grandmother died 1990s, took two weeks get body back coroner mother could bury her. fucking good reason. (Except Florida, follows logic). pandemic made realize people selfish assholes.

I work EMT sick tired remind relatives patients wear masks. always wear masks handle lot sick people including transferring confirmed covid-19 cases thus potential spreaders, us others favour lower risk us becoming carrier.

Employees grocery stores risking health provide us necessary goods services, show respect/compression protect them? people bitching wearing mask half hour bit uncomfortable?

I tried educate people wearing mask valve protect people, wearer, fucking ok it, care themselfs!

Patients blatantly lying symptoms, want isolated.

My mother slowly dying cancer seen since outbreak. I'm really close point say fuck behave like assholes care I? I'm young healthy, catch it'll likely like flu. patients, moved whole ago patients relatives strangers, care? agree barrier could put up, that‚Äôs reasonable thought. remember March, shut standstill exponential growth kept things month afterwards ? 

A poorly thought leap forwards leads much much bigger leap backwards... UK probably chosen since authors wanted compare regions approx. population. European countries selected add roughly 330M citizens, makes easier compare US. course, seen sort cherry-picking. 

I recreated plot, adding Ireland UK list plotting per 328M citizens (i.e. us-equivalent), ends looking pretty similar: almost missed high school graduation ceremony start time wrong work. mom calls ski bike shop worked telling real time was. drive home quickly, shower, get dressed, got line (alphabetically) right going stage. Also, missed rehearsal supposed (I working wanted money going back high school) idea wtf going on. Lol okay fair enough, including UK part EU since start virus, brexit happened recently guess technically you‚Äôre right EU + UK different story Europe isn‚Äôt country. US isn‚Äôt continent. Yes. Let‚Äôs wait it‚Äôs late everything‚Äôs overwhelmed instead...

Our leaders failed us rather hard pandemic. We‚Äôd much better acted proactively cases got rise, opposed reactively it‚Äôs late. Abhorrent stuff peeps, leadership like it‚Äôs bound get lot worse gets better. I've failed countless times. really hope time different. lose hope, hard if/when fail. Shame, embarrassment, guilt counterproductive. Always forgive this. Nicotine advantage; underdog.  really want know Tulsa County sewage system COVID-19 count. That's best way detect local spikes. People State College alright, especially unhappy south atherton sheetz masks employees didn‚Äôt care. ""Now, studies analysis looked face mask use health care, community, settings. observational, gold standard science, randomized controlled trial, would ""very unethical pandemic,"" says¬†Jeffrey Shaman, epidemiologist Columbia University."" Gotta get gram picture... That‚Äôs like pretty normal Florida, though, right? /s possible alternatives. High levels HNP known inhibit activity ADAMTS13, allowing VWF get hand. Something else cleaves VWF, NAC, might fill similar role without colchicine's risks. There's reason school equipped enough pencils paper needs every single student. That's failure leadership giving schools necessary funding order educate children. live MN, right next WI... remember day WI reopened bars bunch people flocked them. lockdown? Yeah sarcasm. Tell people saying second wave many times worse guaranteed. üòò brilliant congratulations them! ray sunshine you're, imagine depressed hell come pass europe. parents high risk and/or age 70+? activities - getting groceries, picking takeout, stopping bakery - sound fairly low risk conducted moderation mask worn consistently correctly. Even scientists like Dr. Fauci others seem agree that. extent expecting parents quarantine long? Right, states opened like 3 weeks ago. expected numbers start getting bad again. Especially jokers quarantine wear masks. No, asymptomatic means symptoms. really interesting stats  tho?  thing? ... Except learn mistakes. seems never do. did, now. Willful ignorance way life here, normalcy bias always prevail, consequences damned. see point. lot people risk taking proper precautions following rules recommendations months still fall healthy young people stop spread. amount old people want go church, go everyday without facemasks etc high. people risk continue take proper precautions, them. one look actively spread it. want go restaurant go right ahead. want buy groceries feel free to. can‚Äôt protect 70 year old thinks it‚Äôs hoax going church drinking communal wine getting COVID. 

I don‚Äôt get got downvoted. It‚Äôs unreasonable expect people lock away months end change lifestyle need to. 

If everyone pulling direction that‚Äôs different story like previously mentioned people see taking less seriously people risk dying COVID

But Reddit everyone feels like epitome moral behavior. interesting article factors consider - billionaire, money market, period. stats surprising. Hell, make 6 figures HYSA that's poor money management. think problem lies average person taking time understand market either contributing 401k participating. Investing open everyone, days need $1 get started. educate rather point fingers believe. Probably not. 400-500% spike ""pneumonia"" deaths certain regions. one compute log10NLR usual blood test neutrophil lymphocyte counts? Yeh. It‚Äôs sad solution simple also impossible. Another comment mentioned examples one might able stay home. wonder 21days increases essential workers still job (actually essential like skeleton crew many countries counted essential). would guess even 1% people stay home 21 days extends couple months. 

But hey everyone bored lockdown guess it‚Äôs time go back normal /s woman left bike doesn‚Äôt nose covered. Yeah, uncertainty hell, would‚Äôve rather hard lockdown weeks end date indefinite crap.

I pray next summer normal summer desperately need schools already planning start, go online Thanksgiving. Rise coronavirus cases brings new concerns Alabama

Why? rising despite every effort ‚ÄúWe extremely concerned numbers. know continue, see hospitalizations deaths,‚Äù Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said.

Perhaps time *do* something.

They concerned they're unable realize there's link (in)action consequences. Ignoring reality mean reality ignores you. New Zealand feels! one hand see articles like thread, hand see articles like really believe? understand normal people politicized this. get politicians using it, normal people thinking someone wearing mask making political statement. caring little goddamn bit people community controversial? back roads, Belgium back roads dumped sea containers border block cars. son young enough still school, there's way I'd even consider making go back. he's vaccinated. exponential growth works. Humans bad math even worse assessing risk. Actually closing borders within Schengen zone big deal quite unprecedented. think happened COVID-19. Bingo, im glad got Pretty sure said ""API"" app. actually worse since foundation support framework close impossible US contain right now, many even follow mandatory mask order. Hopefully death rate continue downward trend. data South Americas important entering Winter, death rate go even goes down, means treatment protocol currently kind working, plus virus weakening slow pace. HOpefully vaccine available time virus weakened like SPanish flu 1.5 years death rate similar H1n1 see today.  part get wrong? I'm trying quit too. failing pretty much. sad is, sanitary service outbreak. Lol

How obvious satirical virus hard contain. New confirmed cases necessarily mean new infections. Imagine many cases would seen March handle testing couldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúOcean filled Covid trash‚Äù like real headline? think sarcasm helps get article clicks? skilled contact tracer generally politely makes suggestion someone checks calendar, phone, social media, etc. jog memories. not-so-skilled contact tracer probably checks person list completed states contacts. Usually chicken factory workers masked anyway gloves on. Atleast u times. kinda factory gets many cases precautions felt unhappy since -17 years old. mask order teeth. Businesses effectively choose enforce without repercussions. Fred Meyer (owned Kroger) already said wouldn‚Äôt. least hair salons taking seriously part. March 16th, brother bunkered up. We're still cooped up. go get groceries mom, finished ratiadion, drop that, go anywhere. friends starting get inpatient started going patios open places cause nice out. really hope get grasp I'm optimistic based I'm seeing around country. higher per capita infection death rate. fuck not. true. Contact tracers ask people spent every single hour every single day contagious. actually think would made much difference different leader. Obama followed competent effectively similar strategy swine flu (herd immunity). lucky much less fatal initially expected. People even ‚Äúmild‚Äù symptoms showing significant, possibly permanent damage lungs organs recovering articles there, good representation virus affecting YOUNG HEALTHY people.)

I‚Äôve even seen cases reported individual symptoms infection, scans lungs revealed significant damage. 

In America, lot people single paycheck away homeless. year ago, nearly 60% Americans surveyed reported live paycheck you‚Äôre kind financial situation, generally choose job health.

No agenda here, facts. plan go work, stay home work. get virus get guess. Let get loan officer lined up. know what's going AZ, since family AZ Missouri, I've watching states, month ago, almost exact cases, deaths, tests, etc. Now, AZ ~52,000 cases, Missouri still around 18,000 deaths changed similarly.

Whatever AZ doing, wrong. ""Only 35 percent 5,347 city residents tested positive presumed positive coronavirus program‚Äôs first two weeks gave information close contacts tracers, city said releasing first statistics. number ticked slightly, 42 percent, third week, Avery Cohen, spokeswoman Mayor Bill de Blasio, said Sunday.""

Some attitudes people interviewed. large portion comes skills contact tracers themselves. really skilled communicate people want good participation rates skill sharpen time. Yup, letting market go down. trading whole shit show mind blowing. Printing money like nothing, monday-fri. can't even make logical trades anymore. feel like whatever happen based whatever event/earnings, bet opposite (granted felt virus, lol). Stock market rallies record setting unemployment numbers. virus first many problems come. mAsKs dOnT wOrK

Seriously people, STOP BUYING MASKS

There reason walking around mask. EU! EU! EU! 

(Is annoying? Fucking rights is) won‚Äôt second wave cause we‚Äôll stop testing! agree there. early March early June, go buildings all, work home go anywhere. I'm Colorado numbers looking better right now, past two weeks I've stores, mostly get mental health. Last week saw friend sat outside feet apart hug anything. invited group friends go cabin weekend declined, feel like smart stay cabin people 4 different separate households. I'm trying mostly solo outside stuff summer like camping husband I. Sure. Give couple reliable sources EU adding 200 deaths per day population 445 million, US adding 600 per day done phone. Good job BLM ya bunch dumb fucks. That's fake news. contact tracer literally asks people spend every hour day. honestly would surprised Brazil ends overtaking US despite 100 million less people Well see tons people outside bars respecting safety distance beaches crowded, good aspect people wearing masks majority takes closest friends (which usually include +5 ppl) China, Singapore, South Korea ran unelected billionaires well, they're competent pandemic response Correct. privatised healthcare private insurance mandatory. UK (London) think we‚Äôre fucked. People throwing parties, crowds parks playgrounds, football matches on. People queue streets coffee. Almost masks. FUCKED. I'm centre county. places go majority wearing masks social distancing. Gonna worse students back. number flights using British skies one day set reach all-time high 9,000 Friday.

Wtf talking about. dont go. 

The discussion miracles Ireland done contain virus. answer nothing much.


Its island road rail links, subways, major transit destination, large gatherings important point two quests mutually exclusive. I'd argue ""race war side quest"", call it, important, so, slowing spread virus. planning toolbox kind thing kid stapler, etc. sounds like see need extra donations year? Well, country incredibly wide incredibly populated. 

We didn‚Äôt benefit empty middle (like Australia) small population (like NZ Singapore). done Yes people wearing masks, really stay home. That‚Äôs way beat virus. Go work yes, *seriously* avoid leisure activities outside house/home. Masks dampen risk transmission way impenetrable. We‚Äôre big state. think it‚Äôs still pretty contained NorCal compared SoCal. least circle, people maintained staying home distancing aside going work. larger amount people able work home also, helps. Certain folks lack ability understand basic science math going hold onto said previously fact. screwed us that. think it'll hit 10m next week so... still accelerating here... neutrophils responsible cytokines storms, prevent reinforce immune system make event less likely?

And also info hitting mainstream media?! fking valuable educational! God, imagine coming flu _and_ covid? would new kind hell. Lol cares CDC thinks anymore. US truly kid special class jumping circles, chanting ‚ÄúI‚Äôm best! I‚Äôm special!‚Äù

The US prime example poor health care, poor education poor democracy results in. 
I cannot understand country rich finance, poor stuff really matter. Well dad works nintendo told there's reason one guy FDA idea going anyone else, especially international vaccine trials. outrage two weeks ago people rioting protesting wearing masks practicing social distancing?   Exactly, think expect longer wait see true results people relying on. lot people simply wait 2 weeks say ""See, nothing happened, we're fine"". think month two, really start seeing repercussions actions take effect. shame, rush open economy back up, people willing wait long careful. pathetic seeing racist dutch people suck americans. regulations enforced working. want suck trump go live america. Hmm. good job say cities then.

Would like go back reread comment? done can't read want make excuses 2 months? I‚Äôm beginning week 15 work home tomorrow... sad quote even understood Americans, even get gun part it.

Yeah, I'm fine. I'm immunocompromised quarantined husband since mid-March. I'm worried health. health community, health loved ones... 

In Montana, good healthcare. People reset broken bones, wait death bed going hospital, generally ""Montana tough"" thing. cases identified, obviously. Thanks Dr Campbell taking 50mcg vitd3 since return US travel obviously risky. get disease I'll update thread let know. 

Into fifth day quarantine fever symptom, lot jet lag lol Sis, Dublin even cluster. people attend London's Notting hill carnival entire population Dublin.

Obviously science explaining states worse other. clearly capable thinking logically. silver lining ignorance meaningful impact.

Dodging question sign intelligence. states massive protests bigger uptick states see massive protests?

It's simple question protests going far longer typical two week incubation period, results available. huge jump cases Minnesota lot protests happened?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ontario extended ban mass gatherings August. NBA likely stay US delayed continuous season. lol AMERICANS SUCK COCK.

(You cry/scream now) mention, gather local spots like jobs, regardless work. Clock-in areas, lunch rooms, bathrooms, meeting areas, still used work despite ""restrictions"" place. Especially hot keep windows open apparently, they've sent home 4-5 employees far already, even keeping track they're okay, even testing positive cases. worrying say least. Really? hard believe organization tasked infectious disease control $1.2bil budget could waffle much simple topic.

We've really let federal response situation. truly sad. deserve better. guys morons compare slavery. well ill say this....trumpers trumpers buddy big trumper..... Coronavirus like ""thanks sharing"" think materialized two weeks, us seeing rising case counts clearly, maybe avoided second NYC. watching closely hoping happen.

I appreciate fact willing put end date - least appear approaching scientifically. Unfortunately that's incredibly rare days.

It's fine say reopening/protests/more positive test results/whatever lead deaths estimate happen, scientific simply ignore results accord predictions bother answering initial predictions incorrect.

I mean look - clownshow. That's science. True. True. think millions people protesting LARGE % wearing masks so.

That lot cases gone here. Well also increase hospital capacity, set contact tracing, get reliable supply PPE stop medical personnel infected virus, get testing figured (In states).  

The states go exponential growth cases didn‚Äôt that. Dude, Dublin filled clusters example. argument rational. Give break, we've done way anything US done lol.  scares me, fact numbers italy clearly settled, stats us going linearly day day. exactly apologize made upset. intention. live beautiful world full diff ideals opinions. We‚Äôre going get together believe. We‚Äôll okay. Didn‚Äôt mean trigger you. got cramp arm needed dole banana New Zealand cool least students must follow physical distancing guidelines face-to-face students. Du l√•ter som Trump ! working class America barely afford live definitely can‚Äôt afford retire. 

I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt believe amounts corporate slavery. Doctors: low dosage Aspirin work profilaxis clotting someone covid19? US advantage economy scale, strong currency decentralised management. US lacks political popular knowledge actually something it, little sad. They‚Äôve lost credibility. increase risk. Obviously. Whether increase ""needlessly"" clearly subjective likely different.

Also speech equal. Political speech protected kind. protest political speech, celebration not.  Coroners average hospital worker.  easiest profession pull people - especially pretty much country working overtime everywhere right now. 

There‚Äôs generally going one person/position end information chain that‚Äôs certifying official numbers collated healthcare workers. usually county state level US.  Unless there's multiple versions you, reminded dared get knob teen fairly cold day, called Rumpleforeskin. guess wear niqap already counts wear additional mask. many women cover faces already, still put mask. mean like almost every country outside Untied State America handled COVID19 months? No, reasonable. Goes show bad things Nixon years boat. borders open I'm gone. Poor fuck. we? cure-all. condoms efficacy facemasks never sex. guess people million dollar bills month-stay respirator, Roche (Trump's buddies) making *absolute bank* for-profit test US ignored public domain one 2 whole months, Moderna surfing vaccine wave way bank etc.

Those things must noy exist guess. Yep, boss pretty much said July refuse come back work pretty much fired.

So risk comprised family slave away corporation? Yeah UK's COVID numbers crazy remember 1/5 population US. Sure they're denser rest Europe. 750 much, would attainable Western Europe. average per capita healthcare expenditure around ‚Ç¨4000. Maybe saying question humans could survive without meat dumb? ton vegetarians vegans humans obviously exist without meat. whatever meant came bit twat. public transport without mask EU countries. bc virus differentiate. Potesting could wait til vaccine found virus spare care cause. 

Unless racism killing thousands per day spreading like covid19 excuse holding protests middle pandemic. league stupid Trump rallies. Employees work large crowds carry home, even symptoms themselves, pass high risk family members. Younger people also affected coronavirus, example:  Places like WDW attract travelers regions, bring virus take back communities, neither good news. Thing is, yes 'only' 1% chance dying it, seems small, looking like 1 5 people recover serious scarring lungs, vascular system, brain damage.

And course wearing mask lowers risk getting it. Even cloth mask stops certain amount viral load (iirc 70-75%). Though right wearing masks best way prevent unintentional / asymptomatic transmission. looks like they're well though. kind mathematical optical illusion. love post massively downvoted. stop virus! India continuous surge growing COVID-19 cases. person dying cancer hospice, one day ceiling collapses kills them.

What put cause death? Why's that? 

When time shit US one seems take time look subdivisions, talk US whole. 

The opposite going true, least me. 

You go ahead compare Iceland US now, I'm gonna discussion. Agreed. Maryland two hospitals yellow alerts currently. goes I've hearing, people getting sick, reported cases data reflecting that. Might coinscidence, hope, zero reason trust data coming anymore. 

There's simply much push motivation open back look like ""part problem"", despite right thing could make huge difference. People still gathering large groups, partying, hanging out, etc. Job roommate works 4-5 people 40 sent home far, business even contact see they're doing, even they've tested positive cases. nuts. I‚Äôve seen articles surfaces like metals 3 days, cardboard 1 day. little skeptical enough virus survived journey China. don‚Äôt know long transportation would be, guess 2 weeks truck 4 weeks rail. suspect China slow spread throughout country bigger outbreak popped up. maybe frequented distant youth. nice place far titty clubs go surprises little. Fined, max, jail timeüòâ president telling people virus doesn‚Äôt exist don‚Äôt test, it‚Äôs here.

Yeah, globally. mandate masks Big solstice guy huh? think nuance offer wearer benefits, greater benefit stopping spread asymptomatic.

i.e. people infected uninfected wear masks infected vice versa. live Miami...the amount people don‚Äôt understand noses go mask frightening... Everything virus hyped death. I'm denying wear masks, course. otherwise, people living much fear virus less half 1% fatality rate people 60.

Three weeks ago, sub clutching pearls Kowalski disease, terrified kids around country experiencing mysterious disease surely COVID-related. suddenly radio silence, why? turns less 50 kids went hospital it, every single one discharged, every single one fine. sub loves perpetuate fear.

There GREAT optimism vaccine front, Fauci notoriously conservative hyping COVID vaccine even starting say we'll end year. yet that's posted sub? 13 upvotes most. bunch comments usual doom &amp; gloom.

If look actual stats, realize nursing home disease. overwhelmingly effects elderly (average age death 79) simply huge concern young. sub onto next fear mongering somehow huge number people experience lung damage COVID. there's simply not. time data comes out, sub onto another fear.

It's insane. mean, think serious too, maybe WW2 bigger deal... admit concerned 2016 say, ‚Äúwell, maybe something. I‚Äôll keep open mind.‚Äù legit terrified get re-elected.

I've known people stories like yours, terrible people know care things cause death serious long term health problems, even young healthy. Meanwhile I'm California people demand haircut, threaten health officials, cry wearing mask continue see rise cases. Honestly best thing California right scenery. people live privilege cry babies never told got wanted.

This novel virus, means entirely known yet extent symptoms may cause. know four months ago, nearly enough dismiss possibility new symptoms uncovered longer virus spreads population. 

While may true local news paper peddling story gain notoriety, given know virus know, particularly smart simply dismiss something propaganda one else reported alleged symptoms yet. claiming know enough declare propaganda, absurdly arrogant. eating. handling likely. Law averages that...  going ignore samples immunocompromised people varying age health conditions, people varying health conditions would affect ability create antibodies? There's reason convalescence plasma touted potential treatment vulnerable people. That's acting like everyone guaranteed exact response, understanding complexity nuance comes dealing Covid-19.

If look actual study link references, literally outline one limitations get proper generalizable sample enough people severe/critical health conditions. can't really act like guaranteed everyone produce antibodies. healthy person, sure. already know Covid-19 comes variability healthy people people health conditions.

None studies disproved saying all, strengthen position. made claim assumption reinfection going ""less severe next ""wave"" coronavirus infectious."" existence D614G (designed ensure sta) contradicts point, especially appear indication Covid-19 weakened relative initial wave. point, researchers find evidence major change Covid-19's virology would affect severity (or lack thereof) symptoms.

So no, person wrong you. made bold claims even backed evidence, made absolutely silly assumption Covid-19 would guaranteed weakened multiple waves.

Furthermore, article Coronavirus slower mutation released April. relevant now? Especially 2 months later, we're staring mutation significant implications mutations appear centered around avoiding detection propagating faster rate before. idiotic saying common cold coronavirus distinct regular common cold. Otherwise, explain wide range physical reactions Covid-19. common cold even close kind danger. data far suggest baby would lower risk you, infants seem catch virus mother's either pregnancy birth, even infants catch virus largely well unless medical conditions. scientist said pregnant increase probablity worse outcome catch Covid. said, given young healthy, chances still excellent ok added risk relatively small one. seem paranoid trust nothing. really hope stay safe see fear friend.

*""But also, protect certain degree, hundred percent, protecting getting infected someone who, either breathing, coughing, sneezing, singing whatever droplets aerosols go out. masks work.""*    
They work less virus ingested, reduce ""infectious dose"", result reducing severity resulting illness. That's need work 100%.

These findings mean long term immunity impossible, much less likely. best far early count possible. Show evidence long term disability/death 

Are seriously doubting infections ability kill people? Considering 120,000 dead Americans (and number believed much higher reported) I'd say enough evidence virus kill you.  

As damage disability there's plenty evidence virus cause siginifigant damage [heart, lungs, liver, might get better enough time, months data clear many people return full functionality many end permanent disability limitations several years rehabilitation healing.

It's nuts people went Tulsa mask on. Saw few, also plenty interviews red hatters still buying seriousness covid19. ‚ö°‚ùÑüåÄ 2.2 million citizens down. 326 million go. 

Literally experts say disease infect every citizen, even went back normal. even infect 1/2 country. umatrix ublock origin, dude true hero please stop reporting now? numbers keep rising, need stop. Where's caddy? like virus shined flashlight, cockroaches came streaming out. Texas mostly open least month. Active infections way deaths not. younger crowd resuming daily routine result getting infected, dying age (and health). Australian, can't fathom americans reacted/behaved covid 19. western Australia followed lockdowns including regional lockdowns state still border closures rest Australia. support border closures pretty much virus free. Life pretty much back 'normal' followed closure protocols. get people concerned individual rights opposed overall health safety community. tend call northern part southern peninsula northern Michigan, far northern peninsula upper, totally incapable dealing crisis astounding Stupid people stupid racists higher percentage country we'd care admit. surprise flee Egypt, extradition treaty us. read wiki page fibromyalgia. symptoms seem similar autism. syndromes, sensory nervous systems seems hypersensitive, leads host problems (fear bright light noise, poor athletic ability, sleep disorder, social problem). 

Could two syndromes variations underlying issue?

(I'm medical expert)  Thanks providing cite. focused Iowa looking kind info find it.

Still, talking ""anti-science bias"" driven ""decades cutting education spending US"". can't move goalposts "" well spending Iowa dropped little inflation years ago."" sources notes Iowa increased spending 68% past two decades. That's well inflation line information provided. 

My point stands. Per capita education budgets gone massively past several decades. outspend many peers. Spending problem education system. system jacked amount spending fix it. Despite sub wants think, long-term effects COVID recovery *incredibly* rare. tantrum. Well hopefully choice make November 3 end bullshit ""An outbreak defined Wisconsin Department Health Services two laboratory-confirmed cases COVID-19 facility associated single event, onset within two maximum COVID-19 incubation periods (28 days).""

That's awfully broad. every single Walmart country outbreak according that. would practically impossible large store classified outbreak. Well, rally flopped. That's good! that's hard feel bad tbh. They've already submitted idea get it, get die, die. They're willing take everybody else come contact with. Honestly, anyone think good idea. 

No shit test something like we're dealing going get cases exist. test, mean there, means people taking proper precautions getting help need. 

I understand anyone, educated not, see stupid idea is. study population 100 % ventilated. 13% mortality whole population among ventilated pts mortality 22% still significant drop numbers stating.
""however, patients enrolled compassionate-treatment program directly comparable studied reports. example, 64% remdesivir-treated patients receiving invasive ventilation baseline, including 8% receiving ECMO, mortality subgroup 18% (as compared 5.3% patients receiving noninvasive oxygen support), majority (75%) patients male, 60 years age, coexisting conditions."" Yeah also wonder telling ‚Äòwho‚Äô slow testing Sheri wrong. numbers real. Rebekah Jones approves message equivalent is, answer less questions exam know you‚Äôll get wrong.. Oh wow. Would interesting see cancer rates amongst kids. Honestly, properly cooking food, threat. virus going survive long kind high heat needed.

Who hell cook pork way? fair, spike south. remain unbothered recovering northeast. slay. doubts. still recall time Michigan one last states first confirmed case ppl say magical power mead. know went.

Who knows, eventually rise debate... ability defend pathetic ideas....

Don't give yet Can‚Äôt talk, busy dying freedom. ""First off, I'm gonna take swab end, another end."" called numbers exaggerated based reasons:

-Adding antibodies positive tests
-Harvesting cases week old 
-placing several days build one two days
-focusing hot spots (contact tracing FL doing)
-Focusing testing communities positive tests come (what FL also doing)
-Suspected cases

But continue hide ur bed cry ur mommy Well. That's really works far right Pink eye commonly reported symptom iirc. like tamiflu drug take get shingles? way don‚Äôt take first 72 hours getting infected it‚Äôs basically useless?  incubation period covid long would make another absolutely worthless drug? wouldn‚Äôt drink water, that‚Äôs whole host parasites, bacteria probably toxic organics nothing COVID. young steel plant contaminated creek PCBs. known carcinogens endocrine disruptors. kids would swim creek. parents told drink water, PCBs travel skin. shit we‚Äôve allowed industry get away truly alarming.   That's Florida! opened asap dealing bartenders musicians getting corona everyone vacationing here! basically full season right typically happens February. normally slow hell now. corvid pandemic.

So we're inundated mass crow invasions?

You must jumping joy right now.

OMG., happy 4 U  need realize invisible enemy (virus) cure yet get infected. vaccination take year's develop responsibility act accordingly. need mental alertness use gloves masks times step outside, reduce human interaction maximum, sanitizing whatever comes home increasing immunity. almost like miracle side merely pro-fetus. womb, good luck Boris Johnson mean?  Chinese restaurants way Wisconsin same. Right, that's biggest concern. idea anything. Definitely ain‚Äôt mad cha that! That‚Äôs initially expecting me, actually. didn‚Äôt think fact I‚Äôd previously worked positions/departments, I‚Äôd stay *all* part skeleton crew. It‚Äôs been...intense. Though again, happy greater good, help keep people safe alive. 

Just favor, friend. noticed frightening pattern people insulated everything working furloughed home coming blas√© reckless. Please don‚Äôt one them. patients precious fragile, sacrificed enough humanity, this. colleagues straining pressure. safe. many times see headline like this, assume ""nah that's probably context"" ""this probably unverified anonymous source"" come comments sure enough direct quote even worse headline.

Don't know keep getting fooled. incompetence knows boundaries. Jfc, comparing actual disease, comparing diseases spread. you‚Äôll end Ontario you‚Äôll drive right place way border. I‚Äôll wave ya. Also may states intentionally fudging numbers. Dude
Chill prima facie bullshit claim right  Yes, think English grammar impeccable. first ones ""storm"" capital precautions strict? thing obstruction public health pandemic? called math, 12.36 percent positive new cases, six days ago 4.36.

Increased testing sould cause positive rate go down, up. let big words bother you, I'm sure fine.. China calling European strain, gives someone else blame.

It's possible trace virus genetically Yep. statement long-term success rules population behaviour; whether currently safe not. peak athlete healthy handle covid mean. bad idea article trying scare Florida citizens stay home wont listen normally. blatantly obvious. 

This local paper,and paper report said symptoms. Propaganda. Sounds Yeah young people get killed virus. /s Ride wave, worry bout coming back...like Brody original point break. Burn hell evil piece shit can't believe we've midst pandemic THREE MONTHS, masks still mandatory country. short-sighted, ignorant, selfish humanity be?

Historians look back 100 years find US's response COVID-19 mind-boggling. That's awesome floored everywhere. hospital county almost full numbers county rising. Meanwhile people flat refusing wear masks even making comments dying natural part life told killing people would anyone post video March 12th? shit ton people sub. least couple years closed Wuhan things gotta really bad there.

If closed Wuhan 10 cases, would hUmAn riGhts abuse right? Yeah, STFU, Zealand, South Korea, Denmark, Argentina, Western countries showed control pandemic without resorting dictatorship.

It's better overreact under-react. South Korea Western country. dictatorship vs democracy debate, competence vs incompetence debate. Nobody besides holier-than-thou white people white countries give fuck monarchy, technocracy, dictatorship, democracy, whatever. Yeah upon arrival everyone tested airport mandatory quarantine 14 days too. Alternatively, probably squad people following around like toddler, wiping things pumping hand sanitizer.  üï†üï°üïûüïì new scary propaganda symptom. people sure isnt propaganda government could print article saying propaganda would think means another nation.  It‚Äôs winter time Brazil! Smh. Wow. thought God helps help something. Put fucking mask, FFS ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

(Or stay home!) say joke...hysterical. 120k dead Americans. Even he‚Äôs joking disgusting thing joke Modoc County 10,000 residents, tbh don‚Äôt think anyone cares sheriff says mutation lack thereof contingent upon knew ""then?""

There evidence. hypothesized based qualitative changes mentioned. can't rule factors. could make virus deadlier without mutation needed, like increase co-infections. icu double cross surge maximum unchecked exponential faster people think don‚Äôt watch plot afraid give life, one would surprised. lot tears eyes tonight. Calling less testing, mocking idea masks distancing. hundreds thousands die. hope. utter despair leadership skip mask situations like that; don‚Äôt wear mask morning jog example. They‚Äôre meant protect people they‚Äôre public appears working. So, everything shut March watch big tidal wave hit coasts started come back (with tight social distancing).

Then hit meat lacking plants, Amazon favorites, migrant farm workers. little outbreaks there, NYC huge population, numbers coming made look like USA ‚Äúwinning‚Äù, really spreading quietly every nook cranny US. 

And everything opened South around May 1, plus Mothers Day, plus Memorial Day, plus protests. now, basically entire Southern US Arizona across Florida North Carolina terrible social distancing, mask wearing habits, Governors say it‚Äôs big deal.  one South lost anyone April May. aren‚Äôt scared like coastal cities are.

And they‚Äôve hit scary exponential curve numbers doubling every week. time see ‚Äúpositive case number‚Äù assume 1% die. Unless hospitals totally full, 5% die. 

So, example 4400 positives today- means 
1 week likely 9000 positives, and
3-4 weeks 44 people die, maybe 200 hospitals full hits vulnerable population.  DAY like that. 


So could say FIRST WAVE, went order: Coasts, Factories, South Lol read couple posts guy gave data , making assumptions I'll see out. saw media people masks. 1 wearing properly. Id want hazmat suit cover germ fest Well makes sense. Withholding coronavirus relief funds counties actually try mitigate damage coronavirus. /s.  Clearly governor taking page king contradictions himself, trump  clear, scientific evidence supportive practice public mask wearing reducing COVID transmission

Look goalposts move!

This virus around half year want data specifically human populations? assume behaves similar manner respiratory viruses we've studied including relative coronaviruses. virus whose transmission follows basic physics. There's way masks help.

You really sound like creationist. So? We've always known people going fine. vast majority _always_ ok. numbers game. percent thousands, hundreds thousands, millions problem. Thanks, bit confusing I‚Äôm glad cleared Comrade /s. people coming corona virus hospital setting things previously didn‚Äôt associate coronavirus may actually be. worse part makes difficult process isolate patients get even worse mix flu in. ever heard Herpes? live Michigan hiking trails PJ Hoffmaster State Park (near Grand Haven). curious decided take trail beach walk north toward public beach access. one social distancing wearing masks. looked like DNR keeping count cars going beach parking lot. 

West Michigan hit hard Detroit fear lot people lulled false sense security. I'm kinda worried odds world population suddenly massive strokes 60 skyrocketed.

People even looking long term, yet. Great test kits /s I'm watching rally right now. course, he's calling ""the Chinese virus"". people wearing mask, probably less 1%. Ego Give three weeks. That's really comparing works, though. would make 0% baseline, impractical. Florida 20% average 15% means Florida 33% more. That's noticeable difference. give dog hugs day. I've said before, u.s.a. hit quarter million.

300k unrealistic.

There ""back normal"". wanted ""normal"" 9/11. denial coming back. ""in time"" now. right now, denial. get tested looked cases per 1M. Then, saw Chile 9th spot. Chile higher number daily cases higher population. anyone know what's going there? ""We friend died Covid, son ventilator, almost died. know real, time know facts are, feel like maybe one side plays one way side plays another,"" man said outside Tulsa venue, screening attendees' temperatures gates.

Too bad something based data available decide truth is... Oh shut up, idiot. close eyes, running red light. That‚Äôs good news trump, since dead vote! hope too, cautiously optimistic. I've shrugged many doctors, starting young age. know ever get better understanding overall. I'm seeing several Cali Sherrifs saying wont enforce mask laws. 

Anyone familiar ""power plays"" play out? options Governor enforce compliance and/or remove sherrif? opinion entitled opinion. don‚Äôt agree. hope that‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre right. pretty sterile environment usually dentist I'm sure shit careful hopefully thorough room cleaning. totally understand. distance requirement typically - 1,000 feet churches, schools, etc. vary community standard usually 1,000 ft.

I turned around left. like buying clothes online, I'll deal it. Lol like 19? ‚ÄúOur families.‚Äù Right. Listen tape. tell wasn‚Äôt big deal worry, Rogan Bros (i.e. phony independents right-wing bros) ""both sides"" insignificance week's time. It‚Äôs literally American Genocide. needs jailed tens thousands Americans dead him.  refunds  That's called ""positive bias"" bother, people extremely anti-modi. agree handling pandemic left lot desired, still better trump bolsonaro. said policies seem heading direction 2 numbers rise. what's spoon plenty doctors say contrary, Massimo Galli, who, unlike guy, actual virologist.

What happening fewer people getting infected thanks months containment effort, detected earlier get better care, thus lowering chances serious complications death. get saying, ""hoping"" \*want\* happen, expect happen? Except based post history you‚Äôre pretty clearly Bunkerboi supporter. Nice ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù save sides bullshit. free Spain like healthcare. However, want go private test virus antibodies, $40!! Curious see real time single person wearing mask Oakland Las Vegas. 

even bars Los Angeles. 

snap map nice tool Dang guys weak doctors there. US actually doctors know job instead whining. god, I'd imagine god would want humans able least stand feet, grovel ground pray mercy imaginary deity never appears face. Would father went milk never came back return 22 year-old son still worships statue? No, would flee far possible nutjob never come back again. I‚Äôll tell why. President fucking moron low IQ. It‚Äôs simple. sane person would ever put voters risk. he's virologist epidemiologist, unlike, say, Massimo Galli, whose opinion different.

What happening fewer people getting infected thanks months containment effort, detected earlier get better care, thus lowering chances serious complications death. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* lowest IQ people country actively put harms way purpose benefit. really surprise couldn‚Äôt figure out? USA USA USA USA first one found 90% C-19 positive patients test positive antibodies. false negative rate range antibody tests have, that's exactly we'd expect antibodies.

Wait, say false-negative rate antibody tests *90%*?? Meaning sensitivity 10%?? Can‚Äôt be! Please tell got wrong... Yes, everyone could well get eventually. global scale pandemic still undergoing heavy analysis. Italy joke. virus' nature still undergoing evaluation; nothing set stone (remember that). 

I would start looking asian/eastern research studies regarding virus. I'm mask supporter well social distancing; think parameters absolute negating virus along potential aftermath possible volatility nature need much re-evaluate gravity situation.

You going presented capable enough understand virus; know place that. set standard, know shit beyond simple, obvious options practice personal-level. amount Wikipedia gonna help understand elements environmental impact virus pose. misremembering intentionally misleading people?

Because that's happened. spat Jones Florida reporting tests potential cases. Either way, nothing deaths. corona pandemic explode June 21 ring Fire solar eclipse. corona pandemic got started December 26, 2019 solar eclipse. corona epidemic Electromagnetic Waves hitting earth time also world blanketed EMF frequencies Satellites also new energy upgrade. wut?

You effect cause going here. Yeah don‚Äôt know that, considering resistant many people simply wearing face masks Stop listening talk radio use common sense source this?

For Florida least, sounds like people irresponsibly sharing theory Twitter without evidence - interested states people come conclusion case. I'm going college Michigan fall, glad hear this. think. Why? watching lot live streams protests west coast, definitely strong majority masks. Yeah new treatment dexamethosone instead solumedrol r/iamverysmart
And FYI, clinical trials zinc works. look forward seeing completed see delusional you‚Äôre being. Japan, Norway Serbia never saw major outbreaks. successfully contained virus, officially hundreds covid deaths months. hundred victims months going impact significantly overall national mortality, unless microstate.

The data mention South Africa outdated, referred country major outbreak, either. situation different, we'll wait updated data next months. 

Data excess deaths show clearly countries major outbreaks thousands deaths) greatly underestimated death toll, none overestimated it. Pretty certain Texas hiding 20 deaths day. aren‚Äôt NY numbers CFR outlier.

The Landmark accusations show hide deaths, also wonder tricks have. I‚Äôve wondered ‚Äúnon-residents‚Äù excluded counts. I'm serious. want Trump win costs. Yup. Regardless, headed total disaster. Economy reopening people protesting anything everything. democrats republicans blame! could see death rate easily hitting several thousand per day 2020 ending least 1 million deaths.

ANYONE playing politics 100% blame. forgot /s buddy years? like days simply case better safe sorry wish stupid sister understand this. keep telling healthy completely okay doesn‚Äôt mean might suffer virus. I‚Äôve never realized stupid , selfish , careless Virus came out. Every single day surprises comes mouth. Yeah NYC hardest hit American city 10-20 % seems rather optimistic. Data excess deaths show undercount countries like Spain, UK, Italy Netherlands well 20%, poorer countries like Peru, Ecuador Indonesia 100% (around 300% Ecuador)... Spain, Sweden Switzerland tried, among others. 5 minutes weren‚Äôt even table? That‚Äôs scary say usually need extended contact (15 minutes more). Man, stuff like scaring shit put me, I'm form India university open around August cases hand, like administration given up. own, people acting fine dandy.
I can't imagine physical capacity afterwards, able run, play, etc. Italy, too. mortality rose significantly north skyrocketed hardest-hit provinces Lombardy, actually decreased (slightly) several provinces central southern Italy, virus never really spread thanks lockdown. impact ""suicides, overdoses, untreated illnesses"" greatly exaggerated want understand nearly excess deaths are, indeed, unreported covid deaths. probably serve court Xi Well, that's true, certainly start seeing deaths surge week.

Don't know remember, 2 weeks ago protests ended media started banging ""cases surging South"" drum. day 93 still many symptoms know population Philippines is? know many tested? government doesnt want conduct mass testing scared people panic know true number positive cases. die without tested, death wont classified death covid19. 

And next time give comparison, use percentage raw numbers.  I'm bhakt putting Modi 3 unacceptable. try ensure lockdown earlier inevitable. gripe instead providing doctors PPEs, he's asking people clap Imagining fuckin retarded. United States ...hold beer actual fuck? unreal. 349 cases. Lol one believes that. TTI I‚Äôm ITP, didn‚Äôt see single soul wearing mask Midtown restaurant picked tonight‚Äôs dinner. Granted, everyone outside, still packed tightly mostly drinking socializing. Unfortunately, plenty people throughout Metro Area decided Covid longer applies them. please go viva la France guys administration already plz People like Trump care human life. I've talked people view Coronavirus. half population US getting infected? cares? 3,000,000-4,000,000 people possibly dying? cares? evolution statistics them. Trump understand risk. care. Fabiflu, India. Antifa synthesized virus distributing 5g network. used Chicken Pox parties mothers would take kids get it. Maybe look Covid version get with. get mail week. It‚Äôs mostly junk anyhow. 

If sign informed delivery USPS email scam email receive day skip days it‚Äôs junk. He's sincere. point thinks he's making people covid mild symptoms need count covid scoreboard because, argues, nations testing much, people end fine anyway. everything, see terms affects ego. Wait, real Dr Anthony Fauci reddit? Well thanks riots least 70 testing centers destroyed.. yeah overwhelming system might help... Straw man much? 


I'm honestly shocked people want pretend virus gone return normal. What's great mass gatherings? What's great giving 3 months? would argue not. wear masks outdoors air disperse droplets easier. run contact tracing covid counties state. far, positives protests. idiots bar hopping getting dinner family. fine, deaths drop Sunday. point like 4000 years.

The Ancient Greeks wrote often pursuit beauty, becoming better, learning better way toward fullness living.

But modern America also writes beauty, becoming better learning better way towards fullness living well understand comment. nice presentation! Trump start test anyone meeting him. Right Presidential historians re-visiting rankings Bottom 3 (Buchanan, Johnson Pierce usually bottom various positions) begin comparison Trump. Don‚Äôt throw rocks glass house Ohio Trump saying ‚Äúslow testing‚Äù there‚Äôs coronavirus equivalent saying ‚ÄúNot president‚Äù he‚Äôs president cleaners often create medical crises Deaths generally occur several days cases diagnosed, seems cases reported still infancy. Vote Agreed.. first announces ""weve done 25 million tests, anybody"" hear crowd erupt cheer.. realize thinks testing decreased, cheer too. dont even know want; believe Trump give  messed would wake feel relatively normal mid day temperature 99.7-101 achy lungs, fatigue, headache. extremely severe days sometimes way lie hours exhausted move symptoms lingered two weeks. may flu something remember sick ever. Really wish could tested peace mind. Curious thoughts mental spiritual aspects told lung‚Äôs take 6+ months recover pneumonia damage Makes sense. Less tests less positives, looks like US isnt completely botching pandemic putting millions lives risk. What's get? snobsdale Ok buddy, compromise give social distancing another year serious concern, instead giving two months?

JFC, people seriously capable understanding need reasonable long-term sacrifice public good. Babies concept object permanence There's nothing invalid it. I‚Äôll take over. super shitty episode Black Mirror need USA virus-related betting. angry understand angry. somewhere unexpected. Salmon‚Äôs best bet right now.

Beijing one secure places China. must taken something weird virus re-emerge there. fully expect increase numbers across states happened riots too. riots rally really bad respect spreading virus.

This particular statement mine particularly coming surge Oklahoma. Thinking competent leader. Well that‚Äôs power give Given resources intellectual capitol mustering half-competent response federal level easy. instead China recovering situation comparable India Indonesia. Guys, guys, joking! did. he's telling truth. Vietnam 1/3 population US. 0 deaths. hard. ask people contact test them. need trace GPS etc.  watched live point seem like joke. independent alex jones left. 

No. even close. again, maybe trying sarcastic. things washed... 

Meat near produce refrigerator. Cutting boards washed well uses, separate ones meat produce. Produce least rinsed eating....

I'm getting kinda horrified seem like common sense. lot contamination risks raw meat involve pandemic. I'm sure relevant discussion president demanding test less people coronavirus order avoid embarrassment administration world standing. would certain rate testing utmost capacity bigger risk bunch people almost wearing mask marching outside.

Are suggesting testing coronavirus somehow good thing? I'm certain would completely entertained reasons care share them. Dexamethasone helps, reduce mortality 30%. Health care workers largely immune NY hospital ever ran beds.

Let rationalizations begin. suspect know story ends. China doing, stop testing blame country‚Äôs military.  true. run group contact tracers counties state covid. used STDs happened. amount pushback get questions ask much questions asked STDs. pushback recommendations requirements.  think meant genocide.

Also fear denialists. 

By wearing masks, we're admitting virus still exists, popping bubble ""return normal"". many countries terrible testing. India one. That's they've tasked past 6-ish months still somehow fucked up. can‚Äôt give cretin benefit doubt anymore. benefit doubt way colonises new political flesh. younger demographic infected Suns 2023 champs way know whether newly confirmed cases already medical examination/isolation due contact tracing?

There‚Äôs big difference case coming onto radar presents symptoms, case already known. Yet none fucking idiots said god damn word massive gatherings ""protests"" last 2 weeks probability covid spread them. 

Remove heads assholes, air much nicer here. Can‚Äôt cases covid-19 don‚Äôt test it.

*thinking man meme people still want admit protests effect. think Texas Arizona. fucking everywhere, going keep getting worse. Please stay home avoid elders everybody. Pretty standard already states STDs CAN'T WAIT

I'm watching seasons 1 2 1-2 episodes per day I'll catching s3e1 right june 27 Guaranteed tweets tomorrow fake panic fake news hysteria coronavirus worse flu that's wants testing slowed down. That's thing think would say this. Right clip video gives hypothetical 10 year old kid ""sniffles"" counts coronavirus case one person age 18 died New Jersey therefore time schools reopen. That's way thinking coronavirus. fucking lunacy. Seems like country split people blindly following president, trying ignore fact president making decisions. 

The ones ignoring president better. even president? Shit 120,000 now?! reality nightmare. already look well current administration. History going find much worse he's office, investigations come crashing in. jinxing say least significant geopolitical crisis happening right now? reason SPEED haven‚Äôt Infection rate started steadily rising couple weeks back. Hopefully doesn‚Äôt deaths tended follow weeks behind infections testing reasonably wide. things US now, there's damn good chance. deserve amount downvotes recieved. dark, low point history. Unlikely. world fallacy.  He's got big abrain know That's dubious. Rebekah Jones Florida fired officials asked lower death count (by almost half) refused. Plenty examples states underreporting COVID deaths. Agree. Hate guy it‚Äôs dumb thing say pretty clearly joke. Posting headlines worst possible thing twist great riling people already hate him. absolutely nothing. wish instead people would pick random 5 minutes watch listen. Nevermind, wouldn‚Äôt change anyone‚Äôs mind either. handling COVID-19 going come back bite ass

You're giving Americans waaay much credit fuck them. 

They said oh locked small apartments houses lived lavish lockdown mansions pools basketball courts etc..

Show us together really are.  Yeah, correct.

Victoria needs deal iron hand, beginning new wave; don‚Äôt control soon, nation plunged lockdown again.

Interesting course events. Cant zeepglorp without zeep Dear democratic Americans:
Come Europe. There's hope.

The rest build Idiocracy. guns stuff. 

It work long. still get back US over. 

A friend. can't quote excerpt President's Speech unredacted, triggers spam filter. watch speach, seems like strategy take advantage effective severe quarantining measures given circumstances. think it, 100,000 people 0.1% population, means average person maybe knew someone died someone see year-ish. He's banking people's lack empathy lost loved one even personally, instead directly affected consequences halted economy. technically he‚Äôs right. He's full frittata. Yakima 90,000. Bruchis safe? Well yeah, I‚Äôm pro *me* staying alive, I‚Äôm everyone else staying alive long doesn‚Äôt impede god-given right cough bus haircut whenever want. 

/s yet...here are. Let‚Äôs assume people aren‚Äôt showing rally they‚Äôre afraid getting sick. would alienate people reminding don‚Äôt give fuck health future? Oh, right, you‚Äôd rather hear ten seconds cheers 0.00002% voters actually winning election. Beijing number infected cases. Well, Professor, gotten F tested everyone! like thinks people watching die hard supporters. Like he's talking best buddies asking help keep shit DL. Sorry, psychosomatic wrong. statement doesn‚Äôt mean fibromyalgia isn‚Äôt illness that‚Äôs best treated solving underlying depression mental issues first. sleeping pill make insomniac fall asleep insomnia related depression it‚Äôs solving issue. knows, care. Fucking asshole. He's shitting America. title actually misleading. use word ""European strain"""". saying virus found new outbreak Beijing similar strain popular Europe. looting fine. losers flip flop issues. 

You losers say ‚Äúpolice enforce masks!!‚Äù time say ‚Äúabolish police!‚Äù 

Racist democrats Omg thanks scaring two ways looking things valid: empathize victims, time stating fact.

Stating actual fatality rate (much smaller initially believed) mean dismissing suffering affected.

Often times, I‚Äôve seen examples one used axe grind justify bad policy (blanket lockdowns) get ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù politician. Policy set based scientific data overall impact society, anecdotes. Depends people vote. Plenty people care goddamn tiring fighting battle talking ass cult following along excuses last resort finger pointing Obama . 

Background : Tired American Fine. guess get that. Yes, obviously frustrating. people social media levy kneejerk, broadside attacks without thinking, simply becomes fodder support Trump, worse, calls question validity Trump critics generally minds important folks: still persuaded one way other. would humbly suggest that's important accurate persuasive vent trolling everyone? mean fuck. Probably US getting flatten curve, leave Latin America become infected super deadly. stating objective relevant truth bunch strangers online, family deceased. Work situational awareness. said something stupid people didnt like it, yeah ya go downvoted Waiiiit thought India control

I guess that‚Äôs happens don‚Äôt come sub couple weeks

Things sure change 2 weeks like we‚Äôve saying crises 100 years.

Um, world war 2? mean 75 year old man  always comment like ""I hate much you"" downplays whatever subject article is. virtually guaranteed. Trump clown ill gonto grave ot understanding touch public casting vote him. said pendulum swings hard left many stories put words mouth taken context even though loathe try defend something hate Trump president propaganda shoved throats, one definitely just... straight forward fucked up. Yeah mocking 100 thousand dead funny. saying work harder pro athlete üíÄüíÄ that, Americans returning REGION ITALY even asked came from, quarantined, tested US border. That's mostly spread New York Rhode Island I'm guy. Explain humor joke. get it. Um, no. accidental disaster badlucked into. administration dismantled decades worth prep planning. directly Trump. ass? dude retarded  US gets flatten curve, disease send away Mexico south Chile Argentina infect Latin Americans. Fly half-staff upside down.  people listen garbage cheer. admits serious disease millions would've died already nothing done, 10 minutes later talks test saw livestream ralley. 1/20-25 people wearing masks. middle global pandemic. World cases peaking everyday. president wearing mask mean people lose common sense stop wearing masks. crazy see. like Fallout: Beginnings Orange City Racing Card Club playing full 9 person tables. around 20 tables going weekend.  Yet aren‚Äôt really seeing general rise everywhere. It‚Äôs still contained particular states primarily Lmao much think sub  leader USA promoted safety instead death mean, he's gonna blame Campaign Manager tonight, fuck could manage man? 

This supposed moment turns campaign around. Instead, headlines are: ""Only 6000 show hear Trump admit trying slow testing Corona Virus thought hundreds thousands would show up."" delawho JFC bullshit POS spews forth. Next highest 16 million tests. 

But important figure tests per million citizens, USA 26th world. denial

A river Egypt? denial

A river Egypt? Good point. I've preaching since outbreak. almost finish line swine office without major event like attack war. Things fairly uneventful point honestly, controversies incompetence anyway, kinda trivial big scheme things. almost passed aberration, no, nature karma something else planned. like incompetent person create lab experiment president actually president surreal. says asked coronavirus testing slowed many cases.

really case, Donald Trump even vicious willfully ignorant incompetent many people realize. positively sickening--and dangerous. totally give rat's ass people's lives, either. WWE? Apparently argument excess testing finds mild cases makes things look worse, something? guess logic, so, he‚Äôs completely missing point He's dealing saying political opponents' fault. working, apparently.   Agreed. I'm wondering long last many things opening quicker planned HIV takes like 10 years progress AIDS mean ignore shouldn‚Äôt political issue all.

Nope, can't that. can't think single thing left turned political even common sense provable fact. Late February last time saw Mr. Fields, man sixties debilitating nausea, bloating regurgitation. (To protect privacy, changed name identifying details.) symptoms made difficult eat, losing weight visibly one clinic visit next. last upper endoscopy ‚Äî procedure inspect top gastrointestinal tract ‚Äî aborted pile food sitting stomach, despite fasted since midnight day before. discussed repeating endoscopy prolonged liquid diet determine holding digestion (a tumor, ulcer, general sluggishness muscle) use information guide treatment.

Then pandemic hit, priorities changed. Friday afternoon mid-March, asked cancel bulk procedures scheduled following Monday. higher up, received instructions review every patient‚Äôs chart, separate emergent urgent routine. Mr. Fields certainly wasn‚Äôt one perched borderline ‚Äî it‚Äôs nature gastroenterology practice, diagnostic proceduralists, know I‚Äôll find go looking. colleagues turned guidance. worried would 80-year-old iron-deficiency anemia? 40-year-old rectal bleeding? 20-year-old unable swallow? question merited procedures, when? Could stand wait four weeks? Eight? Twelve?

What ‚Äúelective‚Äù mean, really? It‚Äôs intuitive think illness varying along spectrum urgency: one end, hangnail; other, heart attack. term also implies treatment also vary along spectrum need, cosmetic surgery cardiopulmonary resuscitation. medicine sits middle, asking us balance potential health benefits potential costs, missed diagnoses, procedural complications or, recently, covid-19 infection visiting medical building.

While country debates whether prioritize reopening economy minimizing preventable deaths, face complicated trade-offs within practice medicine. pandemic logic triage ‚Äî process, borrowed wartime, prioritizing sick individuals according severity prognosis ‚Äî exerts novel pressure system used resource scarcity. Individual clinicians grappling truly necessary urgent.

During first week back work endoscopy suite last month, trouble convincing originally scheduled patients come procedures. episodic abdominal pain, refractory heartburn, unrelenting diarrhea seemed pressing months before, threat infection loomed larger. Alongside clinicians, patients make judgments constitutes essential health care ‚Äî value reassurance resolving old symptoms risk getting sick something new even uncertain.
The calculus quickly gets complicated. weigh patient‚Äôs health physicians, nurses, technicians custodians keep procedural space operational. Concerns infection also ripple patients providers family members might affected. masks gowns protecting one cohort health care workers could always set aside needier cohort later. staff relieved nonessential duties procedural suite could theoretically reassigned settings might greater service.

On side equation, certainly diseases become dangerous left unattended. colleagues cities worry vocally many gastrointestinal malignancies they‚Äôll find routine practice picks again. Less vocally, worry legal implications made diagnosis earlier, wondering they‚Äôll liable pushed procedures hospital settings even federal professional society guidance state executive orders limited elective procedures. potential hazards clinical lag time also hold true specialty areas ‚Äî blurry vision herald impending strokes, unattended orthopedic injuries settle contractures. background unsettling awareness interventions deemed essential one state may elective next, particularly politically sensitive services like abortion.

The line dividing essential elective care always subjective one, risk-benefit calculations tend shift time. past months occasioned especially dramatic fluidity, larger-scale changes also unfolded past several decades. 1960s, specialties began lobbying new interventional environments like ambulatory surgical center, emergency rooms arose distinct hospital spaces managing acute concerns. Meanwhile, chronic disease prevalence pharmaceutical incentives inspired increasing professional interest idea risk states (like high cholesterol precondition heart disease, age gender preconditions breast cancer), turn entrenched preventive maneuvers (from annual physicals mammograms daily aspirin) vital elements routine care. insurance industry overlaid developments thorny questions medical necessity. 

In sense, it‚Äôs remarkable successfully patients avoided clinical settings first months pandemic. Early anecdotal reporting noted surprising drops hospital admissions common medical emergencies like cardiovascular events, appendicitis strangulated hernias, international data begun confirm trends. United States, emergency catheterization procedures life-threatening heart attacks 38 percent early phase covid-19, despite predictions events would be, anything, prevalent viral pandemic. Fewer cirrhosis patients admitted Veterans Health Administration hospitals, according study recently published colleagues University Pennsylvania, admitted been, average, measurably sicker baseline.


The pandemic could put doctor business

Contemporary biomedicine certainly prioritizes procedures financially, also emotionally culturally. Objective observations gathered diagnostic maneuvers like CT scans, tissue biopsies cardiac catheterizations become linchpin clinical certainty. vital confident diagnosis treatment plan and, edged promise life extension, serve kind salve threat mortality. assumptions foundational modern medicine shocking question validity.
Well covid-19, writer Barbara Ehrenreich detailed decision turn away screening tests like colonoscopies, contending delude us approaching death problem solved time invading body point violation: ‚Äúif mammography seems like refined sort sadism,‚Äù notes, ‚Äúcolonoscopies mimic actual sexual assault.‚Äù It‚Äôs provocative argument, easier accept abstract recall patients cancers I‚Äôve found years-overdue colonoscopies. infrastructure high-tech diagnostic intervention seem particularly bloated context pandemic, patients clinicians alike often deeply justifiably invested it.

Ultimately, clean distinctions essential vs. elective care rhetorically convenient clinically reductive. Sacrifices entailed sides, messy work negotiating pros cons persist pandemic recedes. might said all-or-nothing debates pitting human life solvent economy ‚Äî compelling thought exercise, less relevant practical terms. Accumulating job losses leaving people uninsured, example, forcing continue deferring elective medical care picks again. Progressive dreams radical reform notwithstanding, medical financial priorities healthcare system deeply enmeshed, now, grappling either means grappling both.

Every day provides new data, another opportunity reweigh priorities. Philadelphia, work, projected peak end April, first surge covid-19 cases appears crested. Stocks personal protective equipment longer dangerously depleted, opportunities exist systematic testing. developments afford us space evaluate uninfected patients separate, slow-burning complaints.

I recently re-connected Mr. Fields; hope doesn‚Äôt hold interruption care me. I‚Äôm ready pick left off, covid-19 made harder pretend medicine operates vacuum. marvel confidence pre-pandemic therapeutic encounters, often left implicit indelicate questions financial incentives, workers‚Äô well-being, capacity medicine harm well heal. crisis lifts, it‚Äôs hard imagine returning thoughtless certainty. sister's hospital anticipating 1st wave rural areas wave rounding up. Never ever. One Trump's staffers, undoubtably head hand, said Trump joking.

Not true obviously, except considering everything Trump says fucking joke. country built slave labor never great begin with. many die till point?

Just asking proper question Maybe dont joke people fucking dying. Test host disney. Pay up. easily enough families school people staff shit orlando market work right now. realize mortality rate settled science, right?

It debated 0.2 1%, CDC value 0.4%, serious scientist pegs 1%. Antibody testing confirms range.

Do think testing finding cases? even them? Nobody believes that.

The majority COVID cases unreported mild asymptomatic. NY also reported deaths without confirmation COVID death totals along patient died *with* COVID, regardless underlying cause.

You're 2 months behind reading. **^ Volume 28** -He joking

In event, essentially masks reduce particulate spray cause virus spend less time suspended air. Source ? Everything bigger Texas Nah Nov slowest creep back. 4 years trump may agree you. Absolutely ridiculous, acting like virus outer space invented alien laboratory.

It's respiratory coronavirus, means new type virus. 

All accounts ""permanent damage"" accounted post viral fatigue syndrome continuing complications severe pneumonia.

Sterile (please cite shitty testicle binding article Hong Kong)? Daibetes? 

Should stop counting Covid deaths altogether? DONT KNOW CORPSES BECOME REANIMATED ONE YEAR RETURN LOVED ONES!

JFC Glad think 100k+ dead americans joke. even country then? Anything makes uncomfortable political issue. tell sure something Spanish flu back then. even know virus exactly tools detect it. Pneumonia proper description virus caused led death. COVID-19 also causes form pneumonia ridiculous 2020 able attribute specific viral bacterial infection. I‚Äôm going echo everyone say article great! info graphics clear, interesting, &amp; informative. weren‚Äôt summer break, I‚Äôd students read it. Yea knows happens cases increase people don‚Äôt know corona not. here. actually supported thought would make news funnier. 

The news been..... funny dont see joke. Exactly. Trump go back school. Maybe he‚Äôd learn thing two. Fire Trump! Gastro symptoms linked since known cases Wuhan, considered rare.

As someone gastro issues chronic sinus issues know feel. HYPE Charlie Brooker writing/making new episodes Black Mirror--the times dark already. PPE stand for? test country. dont care costs life, going fucking vote. cannot continue, trade life future generations actually country proud it. Assuming eligible vote actually able vote safely, shitshow pandemic response various forms voter suppression... People need stop treating political parties like sports teams. obligated vote party life vote once, change vote show people's best interests mind. watched video. He's saying 'a case sniffles' falls Covid. person lung cancer severe asthma catch flu die, count Covid death. Avoid Somolia. Wow. Never thought I'd see day *less* informed critical subjects celebrated. 

This bit like airline pilot disabling dials cockpit suggest plane developed fault. Quit counting deficits!  Everyone declare war China fault. get random numbers from? Wu-Flu watch clip. It‚Äôs defi joke considering say. definitely could‚Äôve joke paper wasn‚Äôt reality. Remember promised millions test? Watch next minutes, gets worse Logic never factor kind fucking moron. ism beat ism. Sure is. told world testing WAY anyone else, cases. way everyone reeeing. **The key fact Chinese people trust government.** 

The Chinese government locked early spend lot effort educating Chinese people disease would take beat it. people followed, things worked. China started pretty strict measures, got even stricter order eradicate virus. China, like Asian countries, benefits communal culture, blind obedience unrestricted government force. Chinese people believe, they'd sneaking disobeying rules. simply enough police forcibly impose level control 1.3 Billion people.  

Compare America, little education, mixed messages, downplaying threat, forth. American people given little information, even today, lot people refuse follow basic requirement wear masks places mandated. America claims respect enshrine human rights, seen police treat peaceful protestors?

I'm curious, think American police could force 1.3 Billion Indians Chinese levels compliance?  Lmao full shit. Mariners compete! really discernable schadenfreude, though? dumb hell letting Fake news tell think. I‚Äôd really wanted prove superior water drinking strength wouldn‚Äôt used pinky glass support. Rickety old man Would even largest crisis 100 years office? point testing find positive cases. learn nothing meetings past months? He's like apex white privilege. Whined way family fortune presidency. see witnessed Mierda touch. turns everything touches shit! goddamn, calling case ten year old ""the sniffles"". 120k dead Americans think sniffles. Ok, that's hamsters, there's long-term data health risk there's data long hamster stay immune. 

what problems virus going making vaccine provides long-lasting protection people get vaccinated every month so. Even vaccine updated every 6 months going prove problematic. last thing world needs democratic superpower collapsing. 

Fuck Donald Trump 

Vote America. Seriously it. beginning, process getting mail mailbox, throw bin spray disinfectant spray, wash hands. Get mail 24 hours later You‚Äôre dumb hell thinking every retarded thing says joke Well actually hand masks rally, think he's quite denying existence virus. certainly making ignorant comments it. referring specifically way said ""slow please"" could see got idea, started segment calling testing ""double edged may delivered end message sarcastic way, man fundamentally believes slow testing rising numbers bad him. surprising one bit. Actually exactly thought thing is, countryside getting hit like cities are, that's demographic is. Trump‚Äôs still power yes, has. Civil War definitely top 3 imo Unless wanted weekend good pal, Epstein seriously throwing loop sad thing almost certainly right. basically guarantee practicing drinking one hand. Beyond pathetic. Beyond words really. Well,
In country pretty scarce testing kits requirements get tested.
1. feel sick.
2. There's suspicion around someone virus.

We use requirements must need preserve gets worse.

I really know requirements US. 
Maybe thinks anyone wants gets one, even bored. Or

He's asking perform fewer tests knows going get worse wants preserve kits.

Maybe there's little logic behind said. second reason, recognizes threat knows going much worse makes odd reason prevent panic.

No one knows going head.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è fake, care anymore. People die world everyday. Get it. [watch talk dead human capable empathy   
vs 
[] current sociopath ask bizzare thing Trump said true answer almost always ""yes here's video/tweet"". misspelled gained hour watching awesome Monty Python clips. invisible hand free market strangling us sleep. likely true along. people get treatment and/or Covid test before. Unless I'm missing something, IQ normal distribution, mean median equal located 50%. argument even valid. Jesus Christ, can't believe watching this.

Saying there's ten year old boy sniffles he'll recover fifteen minutes want covid stat. mean holy shit, could person narcissistic self absorbed. Literally cares optics getting reelected. I've heard cheats **‚ÄúWe done 25 million We‚Äôre best! testing wooo that‚Äôs awesome!!!‚Äù*

**‚ÄúI said slow uh, wha‚Äî Woooo!! much testing! SLOW DOWN!!! Yeah!!!‚Äù* time try tell people side, start hating immediately due mob mentality That's said, said. saying 0 tests means 0 real cases that's said. said number positive tests go aggressive testing is, true. said scientifically accurate straw manning science denial two completely different things. fake news called fake news. take vulnerable sound bite find hamstring false light muster. Oh, shut fuck up, drama queen.

It's always like this, see happen. anything far less worse.

I even seen firehoses, yet. think time anyone needs point helps mitigate spread others face anti-masker. anyone else common sense would need point argued keeping date trying keep others safe pandemic. 

The anti-masker think virus real big deal is. pretty dark day last line defense hope trying ask someone kill others case wearing scrap fabric. One close aides said, rarely jokes. watched say it. context. could (and probably will) argue joking but, big but, spent next minutes minimizing pandemic.

He claimed 19 names it, people call flu ( implicitly stating worse flu)

He claimed virus really affect kids get sniffles 15 minutes

He claimed schools need fully opened

He claimed left blowing virus proportion vast con spir acy get people obey (specifically people supposed obey never clarified) orders

He claimed supporters refuse obey I'm picturing Rocky like montage Trump training drink glass water....

and still makes look kind awkward. increase cases there's testing happening. *Taps head*

- probably Trump numbers go higher, he'll blame Antifa BLM protests. ""No not,"" said, scooping another dollop mouth. 
""But admitted it,"" continued, though awful smell wafting overpowering, giving up. 
""I care,"" mumbled full mouth. 
""But, saw shit bowl,"" insisted exasperation, ""it's video."" 
""Fake news,"" replied shoving another spoonful past thin lips pale face.
I could hardly believe seeing, much less long I'd trying reason man, final effort made known asked him, ""this can't happening, sit eat literal bowl shit?"" 
Rasping bits left bowl, licked spoon clean, wiped mouth Blacks Trump shirt, said arrogantly, adjusting red hat bald head, 
""I'm patriot."" Nah like election system stupid shit doesnt work modern day America. Wtf lol? virus gonna disappear stop testing tf thinking *Wenatchee remember that*  Lol like homer said ""if dont see illegal"" Spoiler Russian: won't. much alike. incompetence?
He's totally right.
No testing cases.

It's wants show, administration got US pandemic.

In case, end justifies whatever means. Even end built graves Americans, problem.  That's watch video clearly was. important election American history far. People never voted dying vote first time. Please vote. Tests inaccurate numbers rigged!
Most people asymptomatic infection numbers/ fake Covid death numbers made scare us!
There wicked evil people work behind scenes don‚Äôt best interests Trump trying expose them! 


Government media purposely inflating numbers spread fear try make virus look worse is: aren‚Äôt professional guessing people died exposing Elites showing good intentions! leaders used health emergency subvert democracy


Nurse shows people getting false Covid19 death certificates!  sarcastic? really really hope sounds like something Trump Bot would say I'm really curious see many people come rally COVID-19. protests suddenly fine... Nope antibiotics. I‚Äôm RN I‚Äôm aware c diff . isn‚Äôt it. virus attacking bowel hope family positive get minimal symptoms test comes back negative! sounds scary. far far chilled it... Hold breaths hide

Or plague claim us next

Typhoid Karen comes need revisit issue every two months. merely procedural. Try r/covid19positive Wait til gets potty trained! People saying sorts things can't know things back ""normal"". know we'll vaccine/cure, know policitians people change next months, know happen many countries get 0 cases many countries struggle virus. There's way make reliable predictions now. too. stuck inside 4 months took huge toll mental health point wanted end all. Theyre reopening things huge part dont want go outside thought might infect people. Im scared reason people get sick. also dont wanna judged going outside ""stay home"" people zero self awareness. joke dangerous virus? president that? Maybe Philippines Brazil, expecting better United States. Stupid fucks. Trump got way... *My death wont vain libtards* Sorry curiosity idea might caught careful? Federal government shut fuck up. Every decision they've made bad, fortunately state governments uniform telling speak hand. guy asked injecting disinfectant. Im fucking glad disease kind moderate, anything severe would killed us think probably dumbest thing Donald Trump ever insisted saying President. He's pretty great one-offs *amazingly* stupid keeps repeating it. well, maybe something

Well, mean, that. one worse within 2 generations? Explain joke? Luckily I‚Äôm PA, surrounding states governors right way. Granted, mad wanted stuff open quicker, I‚Äôm mature enough understand wrong opinion. live Philadelphia today reported additional confirmed cases. It‚Äôs one day definitely won‚Äôt stay like that, cases always great news. 4 years rapist pedophile incarcerates children can't understand 6th grade science. Wahoooooo!!!! least, means somehow feels accountable number cases. nuts times. I‚Äôm optimistic personally. They‚Äôve using methylprednisone awhile helps doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs exactly silver bullet. pray I‚Äôm wrong though obvious trend: Declining low daily deaths - again.. Sweden? didn‚Äôt lockdown strategy Inflammation, especially chronic, closely linked reduced life expectancy/cellular aging. David Sinclair's work good learning basics.

Politicians allowing people get coronavirus dealing incalculable blow human life lifespans. That's thing people deserve stand stop them. Enjoy. ""fake news""

""here's unedited video saying it""

""fake news"" I‚Äôm kinda proud East Cobb. see masks anywhere else Metro area. Maybe we‚Äôre less MAGA thought? like assume win put campaign effort in. Biden said Charlamagne bad Hillary's failure campain Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan thought fire wall safe. least Mussolini made trains run time. idiot couldn‚Äôt even manage that. Hey silk ties cost money really much throw around, easy playing rich successful.

[Ten Percent U.S. High School Students Graduating Without Basic Object Permanence see tests pandemic over! I‚Äôm gonna tell summer school professor slow testing, see goes somehow It‚Äôs tRuMpS FaUlT think sucks, wait leaves free-agent forces trade later year. first warned world asymptomatic transmission people believe either, expect different time.  Freedom die. videos what? conservative would say say it. Republicunts. Laughter best medicine... Yes, course full year. We're currently 6 months COVID-19, deaths. Guy miles numerous signs said ""THE GOVERNOR IDIOT"" pure Michigan logo. Serious question: meat-processing plants CoronaVirus?

It seems go together mere indoor proximity workers would suggest. cool, dry air inside? something meat?

So many reports like this, globally. mean political way all, person video clearly absolutely vile human being. Really...? That's response. Go away child, adults speaking. That‚Äôs awesome sorry loss :( r/usernamechecksout seem killing less people, hopefully producing mild cases.. definitely seem dying out. SARS, lot severe people infected. 

Unless people evidence otherwise, seems severe cases COVID-19 ones may lingering long-term consequences. mild, flu-like symptoms later worse long-term effects. long-term effects consequence organ damage inflicted acute infection, kind shingles/HPV-like new development. think supposed like ""The Room"", funny funny--just plain terrible.  way doesnt get locked. way ethically dispute lack ethics quote said after. exactly help protect airborne pathogen? audio? That‚Äôs bad read. sincerely hope cadence said joking way, would explain said so. It‚Äôs either kinda shitty joke position holds shitty position stance joke. assuming person buying groceries without mask? even going beach.

The ""everywhere go"" part, saying? Realistically one knows would happened comprehensive federal wuarantine recovery plan. Except would less cases. Everyone agree that, honestly thats enough infuriated got instead. cant. Seem really hit never certain side. Ugh. 30% US teachers 50. Thats going effect. even counting staff higher risk families. It‚Äôs crazy. bad job protecting nursing homes, like lot places. per capita death toll lower UK, Italy, Spain, Belgium, France though. He'd let Russians set nukes Cuba. Problem solved! /u/undeleteparent you‚Äôre hoping Trump knows virus spreads... lol Right? Like want know Timmy's got cold Corona goes gives grandparents friends everyone public. option attend massive protests double multiple times large attending sporting event, concert, play? long get that? Oh wait. advantage never developing object permanence. People like he‚Äôs mirror. Insecure, fragile, hateful, afraid equality put level everyone else. That‚Äôs is. helped states end disaster others. 100% right current executive branch never could done right. I'm saying correct centralized response would best route. Look NZ, South Korea, Germany etc. 

I guess I'm pissed cause I'm AZ many people cavities, slow dental X-rays fewer cavities imagine Trump Pence receive prophylactic antibody transfusions weekly basis. many variables. 200+ countries bound show typical death rates lower death rates. Unfortunately whole, lot excess deaths. 82 thankfully, lost husband 43, last child, mother, days 44th birthday, paid mom college nursing school, got see 2 grandchildren (there wild age gaps lol) get married, lived see 6 great-grandchildren.

She great life. (and destroyed pictures records parents that's wild story lol) Believe me, enough makes utterly full despair daily. almost concept America fucking things throwing tantrums get way. See:

The Boston tea party revolutionary war forefathers fucking stupid understand taxes, logical option throw tantrums fuck things up.

The trail tears conquests Mexican empire forefathers fucking stupid understand generational territory sovereign nations, logical option throw tantrums commit atrocities make Nazi Germany look like Vatican.

The civil war South determined slaves logical option throw tantrums fuck things died battlefield diseases.

The Spanish American war forefathers fucking stupid understand sovereign nations (again) logical option fake attack ship illegally justify conquest bunch islands even keep control of.

I really hate shithole. Can't catch virus bury head sand. introduced start said says means means says Nothing certain death taxes. Fewer tests mean fewer cases certainly death. Ooorrrrr kid gets something similar Kawasaki‚Äôs disease. Rare possibility possibility nonetheless post..direct article well perfectly good ways keeping safe taking vacation time. stay away humans. Masks hand washing reliable ways stop spread. Hes like elementary student trying cheat coloring exam. Hes stupid. article weak shit. Mostly inferences past viruses fear something cause chronic pain certainly take truth. 

Hmm it‚Äôs almost like written by...oh wait! was! It‚Äôs written fibromyalgia group vested interest proving reality long term chronic pain fatigue. Fibromyalgia real physical issue, it‚Äôs psychosomatic disorder probably closely related underlying depression anything. people trying get believe there‚Äôs going millions others suffering chronic issues.  code word guy hole? Like there's guy side like Black Mirror: IRL ""He joking that"" per White House.

This gross. JOKES THIS? 

Thousands people dying Trump wants make funny it. Yes Thank well thought explanation. makes sense now. American, neither I...it‚Äôs pretty embarrassing. gun shop Northern California today one wearing mask. Made really upset. read thought reverse! Back you, Uno. point Trump threat US democracy way think hyperbolic. Pulse oximeter! Sorry, forgot article US. Yes actually agree there. US economy near robust Australia, Norway, Denmark, Japan, NZ, South Korea others able lockdown temporarily, keep unemployment low keep GDP forecasts much much better nations like Sweden.

But yes, agree US numbers grim - US standard nations. forgot original post US, bad *you can't cases test*
A meme became reality Nah, that's 'Heimer's. Actually new cases come large family gatherings. They're still finding cases Beijing, 200 now. seems like lot, consider German 700+ one meat plant. way China responds much faster aggressive countries. testing also increase virus prevalence, percent positive rate larger amount tests would drop. happened areas skyrocketing cases - best stayed states increased. wrong. **a lot** Americans even dumber (or stand profit him). detecting cases better Trump: *Drinks chunky ""chocolate wine""* mean, months nobody could get test unless pretty much dying...  players vested interest. costing too. 

To point though, spending lot time thinking safely bars reopening forcing staff show even though customers wont wear masks. mean Emperor Newsom expressions thing years... see They‚Äôre trying give Fox talking point. 

This reason Trump contradict take many angles one subject, Covid. way, fox stitch together narrative later I'll consider voting Republican moment stop party racist fucking monsters. M8 successful. Orange Imbecile. Fuck 45.  listed congresspeople didn‚Äôt wherewithal pass legislation provided money also mandated states conform specific guidelines (remain locked down) get money. also didn‚Äôt go far enough help specific industries like sole proprietor, non-franchise restaurants bars. 

Congress power purse that‚Äôs hell power moment. got opposite. context clearly joke Well barring vaccine, exponential growth: 1 billion Indians * 70% contraction * .8% fatality 5,600,000 dead. fucking stupid be? mean, really? Really, really? Come on, now. Asymptomatic doesnt mean unaffected Oh. replied wrong comment think Except secession legal constitution invasion fantasy happen, least ""legally"" course.  White House said hes ""obviously kidding"", also go fuck themselves.  tWo wEeKs risk catching covid testing center? recently returned home area lot cases I've started diarrhea headache nowhere. IBS diarrhea unheard me, really eaten anything upset stomach, also much appetite. I've heard covid often starts GI symptoms I'm concerned. 

Anyway, there's hospital testing center walking distance. I'm debating getting tested peace mind. guess main concern is, covid could catch testing center? would really suck even covid gave going get tested. hand, live alone car, get really sick definitely able walk hospital test. work inside casino amount ppl know wearing masks ,let alone ppl refuse wear correctly staggering. believe species much future. you‚Äôre smart, you‚Äôre going avoid damn virus like plague then. 

I‚Äôm right you. 

We don‚Äôt need double dose shit.  like 50% sure told say shit, absurd believe anyone could genuinely stupid. special ed class school brain power this. first time said something objectively stupid makes question reality. heard Biden trump similar policies beliefs regarding politics

Somebody lied you. Except case... would Bernie bro Well there‚Äôs lot points make here. experiment experimental treat autoimmune arthritis. doesn‚Äôt test serum levels prominent cytokines acute reactants you‚Äôd acute illness, IL-6 IL-1. lastly, done mice.

FTFY sniffles caused Covid, case Covid. said it‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong‚Äù whatever people unlikely die Covid tested counted positive cases. second sentence straight nonsense.

Sorry, heard wrong. Please research stances, go back correct people heard from. vote national pandemic stay home orders. Ever thought possibility? largest crises 100 years.

I want downplay coronavirus, absolutley largest crisis 100 years. 75 million people died WW2 confrontation one country openly committing genocide real chance taking Europe. British Columbia, Canada! alright man whatever floats boat. Dont surprised country lets americans next year still make sense countries south equator getting hit, too, even though midst summer seasons. polite ways saying ""OP intentionally misconstruing words upvotes."" serious? think credible forensic pathologist medical examiner would rule covid-19 cause death case? patient severe asthma contracts covid, goes ARDS requiring intubation dies multi organ failure, completely legitimate rule covid cause death. clear change point. incremental. testing, better treatment; 30k cases translate 1500 deaths would take blindly taking ratio death/cases 121980 /2330578=5%. increase cases worrying way gets re-elected make seem like everything fine. Can't keep topping charts week week. Unless children basically isolated rest society, dying higher percentages really help anyone else. perverse incentive standpoint, children least likely able fend contribute economy deaths would least impact functioning society outside long term trends like population replacement keep things like Social Security Medicare funded. 

In New York City, roughly 25% deaths 18-65 vast majority coming 45-65 range. unrealistic expect people dependent children fall 18-55 would still put percentages group likely 10%-20% range deaths. Depending many people children (and many children some), take millions deaths overall end millions people who've lost usually key element support lives, even early adult lives.

Before economy cratered, average age ""children"" leaving parents home [23.5 number likely continue creeping parents even alive. pandemic hit, 18-34 years olds relied parents financial assistance. 

I really can't stress bad pandemic could end even 100% 18 never died intricately woven economic dependancy become generations came Boomers. Unless lot Boomers older kick bucket start redistributing wealth they've hoarding years, could end bunch younger people survived pandemic enter world even drearier economic prospects previous generations, lacking even usual support people dire straights used get country's social safety net programs parents.

That‚Äôs literally picture protest. understand many people would turn protest CCP you‚Äôd go somewhere Reddit. watched iCarly, thought place made up. surprised city really named Yakima. Jersien(spelling?) I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôve handled this. haven‚Äôt seen one person wearing mask. Everyone following rules ones getting upset it. Sure I‚Äôve seen people wear correctly, everyone one we‚Äôve months now. 

However, sections Jersey seemed like death wish. won‚Äôt name names. inevitable ass holes, GO JERSEY! Oh, New York too! study showed cardiovascular effects. front-page news reddit days reported heavily news outlet. led Dr. Fauci speaking treatment several countries either banned treatment outright (France) stop clinical trials. 

But.... several countries said paper suspicious. go it, straight-up fraud. way 4 authors could collected/sorted/wrangle/analyzed health records many different countries hospital systems (and technically, paper said data-collection done 1 person). Plus, hospital systems readily makes patient records available researchers (because privacy concerns)... makes whole study far-fetched. 93k patients, talking something would dozens authors take least year. 

But stop there. groups perfectly balanced 20 covariates (Again, study utilized hospital records across world. Different populations different rates comorbidities. extremely unlikely would balance out). American hospitals apparently prescribing doses well FDA guidelines. Despite utilizing clinical records, acknowledgement patient-protections IRB approval. Oh yea.... hospital systems straight-up said records never released researcher.

It fraud.

Why happened? Well... politics. Personally, think Trump picks conversations regurgitates little tid-bits without really knowing talking about. desire prove wrong everything, people end supporting whatever goes Narrative. situation, well-known journal fell it. political issue, financial one. Follow money think median age covid cases dropping, age admitted patients They‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs possible. proof otherwise? think funny (in very, sick way) upvoted :) debates said was. believe quote ‚Äúlittle babies BIG NEEDLES‚Äù talked someone whose son autistic. Reaching new levels low mean, think lot reasonable demonstrate claim common long term effects uncommon irony username posting article really funny.  dt gets elected it‚Äôll like never ending OT playoffs. heart always breaks Africa. know virus takes two weeks longer kill takes detected? Meaning there's two week lag cases rising deaths rising.

This isnt rocket science. correcting - that's article. Ok. shall see. literally picture protest. want understand many people protest, you‚Äôd go someplace Reddit. Love neighbor. don‚Äôt yet know ignorant. u know

i say right getting worse

people tell im idiot negative asshole

newsflash people LIVING NEGATIVE TIME!!!

Unless course see illness death others positive? 

I dont understand people days, man.... It‚Äôs also Fucker Jake Paul vandalized family went drive local canyon today passed local reservoir people go boating - fucking _packed_. course, barely masks could see. infuriating can't even find proper way express it. People selfish can't fucking stay home weeks. understand lot situations impossible stay home - work, need get things grocery store. That's masks social distancing for. fool proof course, study study example example much help wear mask. people listen? No, slightest inconvenience wear mask go outside. Mix people care virus, people react ""fuck you, can't tell do"", that's end like US. fucking adult something want good general public. It'll go way worse rebels first thats sure lol Hmm, blink ""OK"" twice ""help."" Double OK? I'm packing bags heading over! Red Bird gang No. gonna imagine that. Nope easy mate... cutboard refrigerator boxes everything contact risky guys won't. government call bluff, go forward it, U.S. government tomahawk missile window (insert governor here) pretty quickly,

Good stuff. absolutely crazy. **Yes, case, even kid ""only sniffles"".** would mean counted? pandemic! might mild kid, go visit grandparents non-insignificant chance dying catch it.

I can't believe said that. continue surprised (since surprising Trump). audience gets quarantine... agree with. don‚Äôt issue protestors matter stupid stance want take. still shocking amount people wearing mask rally every single person mask enter building. Either it‚Äôs bunch crazy nuts convention US done really poor job educating people. Care elaborate? Standing ovation. Said used two hands protect silk tie. New Zealand good example. everyone infected? Hell no. zero new case maybe 3 weeks now?

Copy paste strategy countries, really starve virus Also get tested every single time respiratory symptoms, get want know make plans accordingly. Basically real beliefs/values, post whatever edgy cool time. real personality all, whatever get likes/upvotes. That‚Äôs sad. Typical uninformed liberal. first one saw.

The two groups dramatically different experience last months. One always remember time everyone stayed home months, dramatically life changed. other, life went usual, ever present risk getting sick themselves.

This difference expresses people's attitude towards reopening society well. first group much personally fearful, they've successful hiding disease think perhaps everyone hide long possible. group inevitably ends fatalistic attitude. they've never choice stay home, they're far likely end attitude whether get virus control. that's it. i'm never going office again. Hospitalizations lag behind cases. Deaths lag behind hospitalizations. Let's see headlines say 2-3 weeks Wow, feel like I‚Äôm reality tv show stage US, run Trump president show Yes did. said people Africa can't get tested. saying ""most people Africa can't get tested."" That's textbook definition moving goalposts. Gotta make sure kiddies babysitters mommy daddy die economy! stores full people, without masks. 

The parks beaches full people without masks.

The streets full protesters, without masks.

Everywhere go like half everybody decided danger over.

An upward trend? Hold tight, I'm pretty sure we're headed explosion! first thought. rust belt wants dumbass leader fine, rest us so. Good luck you. got tested Tuesday 1025am got result back (negative) around 1035am (in San Francisco - sure whether free insurance covered it).

Please keep great work. together rooting you. Well luckily stadium like half capacity No. Posts like designed trick people believing country resemble post yersinia pestis Europe Cool. percentages many children lost parent. Swing bat.  know that‚Äôs even going happen? Don‚Äôt give death lags shit. We‚Äôve learned much virus treatments since initial onslaught body counts back April. ""He weak. Weak. weakest 17-year old I've evern seen. like 17-year-old teenagers die flu. know. Maybe unlucky.  think weak."" -- Trump, probably. people hell bent contextualizing everything says? I‚Äôve never seen someone constantly receive benefit doubt WW2??? gone down? needs time make assessment....You know virus works slow US stupid extremely uncomfortable many mean enough reason wear one. seems little weird me. wear mask inside buildings, alone car. feel pretty safe car like give mask time dry off. Yah morons. Hopefully get it, die. Survival smartest point. Hopefully infect many people wearing masks such. Texas saw 4,400 new cases today, 100 new hospitalizations.

I want people getting sick, looking like we're finding mostly mild asymptomatic cases, awesome.

In week two, deaths spiked hospitals overrun, put panic behind us. Upward trend cases, deaths. title post poorly done. Remember videos people collapsing Wuhan early days? China three times population Europe, people seems okay saying virus ""came China"", without specifying location. article flared 'Middle East', India Middle East mislabeled Oh. joke? understand what's appropriate joke about.  top closing spring training, owners players can't decide they're going split millions year. months ago talking restarting season sounded like MLB/politicians shared wet dream. still does. complete utter disregard social distancing, mask wearing and, yeah, emotionally charged comment unequal enforcement German police. that's fact take consideration. that? dude batman? remember predicting this. bank thing, ferry thing. got two face help. remember tho article says events like stadiums empty. Sakura viewing outside activity. majority Japanese pictures wearing masks... see point? Going view flowers dangerous, stay properly away Everyone shopping, going eat, working, etc. understand saying. actually quote show father tells daughter matter gone like that.

There level personal responsibility employed others imo. personal freedom care will. last hurrah either way ""If could cut risk getting kind cancer half wearing mask leave house, still wouldn't, masks look stupid.""  Yes speculation point. one things certain either we're going get 70% transmission, get lucky vaccine hit number. That's according Dr. Michael Osterholm university MinnesotaÔøº

The rule areas certainly spared get 70%. live small town big city, disease careÔøº Everyone countries, typically made regions legislative powers etc. 

People Italy, France, Canada, Brazil etc. outbreaks, different regions within countries affected differently total country still calculated headlines/discussions tend focus country rather specific region. virus stay... likely get point next years. 

Just avoid anyman public good. let shatter faith government yet. 


Government organizations work fine properly funded properly staffed. Right government run people whose main objective sabotage - political method called ""Starve beast.""

The goal sabotage government point say ""look work!"" use excuse sell highest bidder.

Be disappointed people voted them. disappointed people interested forcing system fail privatized. turned idea governance actually beneficial done correctly. call weekend arent there. also called foot doctor would please provide link scientific paper stating exact sentiment, people get infected disease magical thing happens?

because, offense, call bullshit post.

There effect deadly disease is, less spread people dead.  something happens one disease, become milder spreads, remains exactly spreads.  want police authority? Hugs aren‚Äôt necessary. reasonable say though, future infections knowledge prior infection spread behind them, making likely someone still spreading larger liability knowing participant. Today 15 915 new cases... Well, actually they're exhume graves free space new ones üò¨

That poor child. lives, pity growing parents put politics basic health. hilarious think people needed taught this. enjoy,  Wearing mask, keeping six feet distance, using hand sanitizer and/or washing hands going store isn‚Äôt normal life. Besides, symptoms don‚Äôt mean person virus. Allergies common colds cause symptoms. there's guy hollering ""Get ice-cold beers!"" everybody's buying it.... reporter idiot. say fever. Boom, get tested. Well people asking roaring 20's come back. Wow Joker predicted moment appreciate take different perspective thread downvoted it. But, agree way early definitive anything, I'm basing claims precise metrics. Jon Hopkins University provides terrific source data including [testing rates look rate change positive tests percentage moving average correlate number tests per number new cases, look good. We'll need wait weeks confirm trend, looks like way greater 1 something constant unless there's change behavior environmental factors. 

I access article linked (probably I'm EU), conclusion regarding according CDC, hospitalization rate coronavirus 0.000945, 94.5 cases 100,000.
is certainly incorrect. real mortality rate 0.3 - 1.5% (0.3 1.5 cases 100) there's way hospitalization rate orders magnitude lower. value provided probably number hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants given area (both healthy sick), number hospitalizations per SARS-CoV-2-positive people. words city population 100,000 95 people ended hospital, would hospitalization rate 0.00095 number people COVID would probably something around 1,000 - 10,000. number one cause: bath salts smart, you? disagree Joe Rogan, ""listening diverse set ideas"" good thing doing. Hopefully get treatment eventually. Hence /s, dude. Twas sarcasm. That's understandable makes sense. think bad look multiple ways government throws throws around war analogies. wearing mask makes piece shit. It‚Äôs political slightest, you‚Äôre brainwashed thinking is. know exactly means. means puss puts feeling wellbeing others. I'm reverse hugging on. ""Hi dad awhile"". understand it... hospitals region direct urgent care less full hospitals. rural hospital full ICU bed needed person question transferred/sent different hospital region.

The problem means hospital beds still technically ""available"" region right day suddenly every hospital full once. affect rural urban centers alike. going pretty happens. Summer? Summer start week? becoming full blown south pan handle now.... people replying negatively sound little jealous # ‚ÄúThink stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.‚Äù

‚Äï **George Carlin** Corona virus affect lungs rest life. want kill feel free involve people fucking narcissistic moron. streets

So day day operations Brazil then? don‚Äôt think so. people found contact someone tested positive, they‚Äôd get test. Like said. Limit beaches locals. Problem solved. There‚Äôs certain point seems pro-lockdown crowed trying take away liberties sort flex. don‚Äôt get it. Nevada wants join Arizona, Texas &amp; Florida gang 3!!!  yoy getting spreading virus stuff from? balance hiding rock rest life venturing out. sure. people goners matter case ventilating immediately killing saved. Plus steroid treatments arising reduce inflammation much better. Used 2200 deaths day half higher cases per day. fucking dipshits keep going beaches fucking Facebook likes. Ok? get live reality. read Fliff Amendment? ""Congress shall make law requiring people wear masks interests public health. MAGA!"" new virus, mean know anything guess time. around 6 months time lot scientific research made learn new things every day.
One thing see scientific research, virus can't reach far infected person. Indoors 3-4 ft, outdoors much less.

That countries world focus social distancing. social distancing minimum 3 feet observed, science teaches us risk getting infected infecting others (it works way ""it's infect others"" thing myth. exhale inhale) low indoors almost non-existing outdoors.

For reason US chosen ignore fact, really fact.

In situations difficult keep distance. bus train. working hospital. situations masks great idea lowers - erase - risk getting infected infecting others.

So wearing mask 4 feet away others, effect. least comes virus. might psychological effect. might make feel like better person others. might make feel OK treat badly. might even make believe ate healthy.
And point mention obesity.  situations, social distancing observed, mask shit comes healthy. obese person claims healthy wears mask, bullshit. level healthiness same. obese person wants healthy, something obesity, mot wear mask.  one gives shit vacation beach people fucking dying hundreds thousands fucking asshat.

Holy shit go therapy. either brain damage fucking psychopath. stay home, damn it.
Or wear mask. Nobody stay home forever. ramifications somehow worse enormous amounts healthy looking asymptomatic folks going bars, restaurants, name spreading folks.

I feel sorry people Florida. DeSantis seems like grade fucktard. Big Brother house. 

idk still going waited bit even tell covid March 30th still interesting. Anticipating ""wild evening"" ahead Saturday's rally, president told Axios recommends ""people want"" terms wearing masks attending.

Leadership finest. vast majority new cases young people without symptoms? getting tested symptoms?? Unfortunately headline today said 17yo passed away Covid complications that's going look sensitive aware. little dramatic isn‚Äôt it? Ground glass opacities happen conditions like flu thought heal completely time. ground glass opacities associated COVID also aren‚Äôt thought lead fibrosis lung afaik - that‚Äôs type lung damage doesn‚Äôt heal easily.

(Not it‚Äôs dangerous/concerning people shouldn‚Äôt worried getting damage lungs... definitely still cautious it. don‚Äôt think say right lead widespread chronic issues years years come.) You‚Äôre risking others continue interact people making gamble are.

This person claims current family interactions. would risking? mean comfortable wear, physical activity makes short breath wearing one, can't understand people well due reading lips. many reasons use mine public would argue we‚Äôre closer 200K 300K. Determining many people die Covid 19 lot harder say, gunshot deaths. example heart attack deaths US. know Covid caused heart problems blood pressure problems patients may missing lot there. also know people avoiding hospitals due fears contracting Covid. could mean people early signs heart attack less likely go ER treatable heart attack becomes fatal one.

Whatever true death toll accept worst viral pandemic anyone outside HIV patients ever faced US. FEMA needs continue making money one way other........... course care risk. dont manage certain instances liable court.

They dont care much consumer risk possibly can, care making money. regulated. Health safety part that. True, mega dosed years ago attempt help Bell's palsy...my face moves might worked might done without it. Either way negative side effects besides highlighter yellow pee. can't quite explain post-Covid feels like. Like, I'm definitely sick anymore, things feel... weird. That's best way explain it. weirdness comes, goes too. may days, BAM: body pain, breath. Yes absolutely can. We're trying save lives fucking idiot. Asymptomatic young people seek community PCR testing sites. South Korea going membership lists cults work places. Florida stay strong leadership Desantis!!!!! Clearly shark attacks, lighting strikes, people blowing hands fireworks COVID. work outside Gettysburg. lot people think way - hit there.

Nearby Hanover populated enough grow exponentially. hospital cannot handle it, does. point, gotta clean entire city... Dallas aint looking good... It‚Äôs feasible think. You‚Äôve got 2 near Michigan city/South bend, 1 going Jackson, 2 eastern side. Mackinaw Bridge. highways there‚Äôs dozen possible sites

Between these, vast majority traffic covered. less trafficked roads allow entry? Yes

But economics there‚Äôs thing called opportunity cost. opportunity cost taking one-lane roads weighs cost staying main road stopping test. Obviously still people *will go way* take smaller roads catch majority people coming that‚Äôs still better less. We‚Äôre never going catch 100% people could test 80% people coming way, inconvenience rest give economic incentive take main road people exist. News 11.

You risking yourself, risking everyone else. get choose people. 10% ~17,000 come last 3 days. Definitely fluke. microphone thing, wonder would taken seriously They're probably US, Mexico shits hitting fan really badly. Like New York level badly. Plus fact quality life good, creates gold mine virus. Remember, masks don‚Äôt protect wearer, protect everyone else wearer. Kids haven‚Äôt shown much reservoir. cases child-child child-adult transmission, far know within household. could see issue schools too, short exposure like would happen grocery store.

Compliance difficult little people. seems like case asking much, see lot families bothering. they‚Äôre already breaking rule kids, it‚Äôs slippery slope adults wearing either. posting article March? Average age Vietnam: 30 years.
Average age Florida: 42 years.
Might sound like lot makes world difference regularly urged Nebraskans wear masks public coronavirus press conferences. time, said businesses encourage customers wear face coverings, **not allowed deny services people don't**.

somewhat misledading headline..... Dr. Anthony Fauci says staying closed long could cause ‚Äòirreparable So...still contagious spreading everyone come contact with? Got it. share link? going rally middle pandemic portion asymptomatic carriers someone going vote for, elderly high blood pressure obesity, I'd damn sure wear mask. could be, politically. Still though. many fans trump won‚Äôt wear mask. simple step help fight virus continues evolve. It‚Äôs really sad. [This type trend alarming They're known ""Trump Tubes"". Dude piece shit encourage go get infected take ass running. mean shouldn‚Äôt underage boy living past 8 years? Nothing weird locals walk neighborhoods, play yards, ride bike, seriously takes minutes get daily allotment vitamin D.

There‚Äôs way one get outside hang beach.

As Swede hope well know never happen. politics decision making works Sweden unfortunately. feel even ready leave country, low expectations substantial change come this. Indian trolls force downvoting... simply true. social distancing preventive measures (masks/handwashing/disinfection) prevent many people getting Covid-19, slow spread disease buy us time study, improve medical response well create distribute vaccine.

Legitimate means ***not propaganda*** ***backed source*****s** cos think know links going send NDTV Aaj Tak 0 deaths believe cases part accelerate herd immunity... close borders let anyone anymore? check aciwnce based covid sub regarding studies. lots learn us. 

I think getting things bit mixed up, maybe eager point finger someone. I'm critisizing shaming people wearing masks. wearing mask makes people feel better themselves, great. mask wearers busy criticizing shaming people wear masks. take look sub. Ah, another collateral damage arrived.

What article mention situation Jakarta. Dengue started end last year excess mortality really skyrocketing beginning here. Everybody believed caused Corona Corona made known.

Our patent attorney Jakarta already stressed January dengue alone. 

The situation became worse affected people Indonesia introduced procedures protect people Corona. one sided protection left dengue patients outside health system. Getting sick later better you. Doctors better clinical understanding treat disease. means, potentially, higher chance survival shorter hospital stay. First problem 30,000 * 14 correct many nursing homes, prisons, group homes situations still sitting bedroom quarantine, time there's undiagnosed cases balance that

Second problem people rally evenly divided every County country would concentrated City, state, region

You never saw media never popularized them. stuff coming northern italy pretty horrific lombardy ""centralized"" information dissemination media stopped showing videos TV. post 6 trump staffers testing positive deleted. Almost anything mentioning name deleted. Posts Fauci deleted, even ones mention latest soundbite contradicts president. 

This sub much less active was, easily see popular posts get removed, see comments purged political bickering. 

By deleting political posts comments, mods breaking rule keeping information quality high. spoiler alert: least 3 years article says nothing Doubtful, estimating one death every four hundred cases, means we're missing almost 1/20 cases anyway Hey, missed two. Without statistics put context, rampant fear mongering. could get terminal cancer exposing skin sunlight 60 seconds, yet afraid stepping outside daylight we? reason likelihood happening tiny, albeit impossible. 
Some initial assumptions- disease, statistically quite unlikely already. need fall another smaller subgroup extreme symptoms required hospitalisation, also unlikely depending age group. need fall another subgroup fully recover.  
I saying ""Don't report this""- seeing reactions many (""This virus fucking terrifying"" ""Don't get virus!"" etc) highlights problem kinds articles lack context. Bunch videos used here, dig they're still there. collapse covid, collapsed covid etc. I'm thinking even entire apartments come sublet market perhaps too? seen these, still high prices. agree, could tough decision making time. groups inside.

Honestly though federal response could worked feds actually enforced plan. State skipped CDC steps went directly full reopen. idiot governor praised it. Leaving decisions individual states allowed this. individual state response allowed injecture politics strictly scientific/public health problem. 

I disagree though allowed certain States response far better federal one would been. country though coming different part country sht hitting fan sucks. 

Rant over. perfect normal distribution. fact, would guess lot things push IQ down, injuries, medical, environmental... things would push (maybe miracle, taking strong action relatively early. Considering China 3 times bigger, means India literally 3 times denser population. cant compare that. Deaths vs. cases cause testing available. start basically unable get test unless critical. Cases likely much higher reported. Ughhh go Kroger? slated go next month think going get groceries delivered house home take avoid it. always slammed, like Black Friday slammed, every summer. condo Palmetto Dunes intend basically ride bikes socially distance beach. don‚Äôt want chance anything else. right, see news stories life great people healthy.

Anyway, they're obviously pretty ignorant people unfortunately spend days killing slicing animals. mean, we've got admit we're part problem, actually take job day pretty warped. got mess mind too, like post office. jobs end messing people's minds bad. can't even imagine desensitized people animal suffering. far yes. also campground 1000 camping spaces staying whole thing. Packed like crackers box.

to date ca. 1300 infected. 21 hospitalized, 6 ICU, 2 vent.

There needs criminal investigation company. Well know survive pandemics People saying 100k would die we're downvoted oblivion ""doomsayers"" back February. Yes, poor wording part. According yes, unlikely, person would considered outlier, would normal become infectious 2-3 days exposure. (Mean incubation period 5 days people become infectious 2 days prior symptoms onset according case studies) Dude, school statistics response tell educate myself? F said heat would kill it...but even it‚Äôs case, hot weather means air conditioning. didn‚Äôt even consider much impact air conditioners could make spreading virus. Every cloud silver lining! damage survivors circumstances new, virus causes state. That's predicament.

You'd shutdown movement across boarders (state included) 100%, otherwise always risk. Belgium overestimated slightly?

Sweden caught almost deaths. According excess mortality, Sweden actually behind Netherlands example, even though Sweden far ahead looking official numbers. So, question bars. Brazil‚Äôs infection rate must stupid high. somewhere around 2.4 million tests million confirmed cases total, almost 50% positive rate almost bad NYC peak, except whole country 200+ million could educate studies European countries figures fudged like US ;-)

Trust data. That‚Äôs says. Praying family. I‚Äôm sorry loss hope find peace. Using various sero-prevalence estimates, infection fatality rates (IFRs; fraction deaths among infected cases) estimated **0.38-0.73% males 0.20-0.39% females non-nursing home population (non-NHP)**, **0.79-1.52% males 0.88-1.31% females entire population**.

Bye fact call wearing mask fetish tells need know. 

Wear fucking mask. they're whole game wife family Peru. many times years. guess, it‚Äôs jobs businesses operate informally. Meaning, government shuts down, next day still someone selling food cart ringing bell street.

Deaths back around 2k per day 2 weeks. guarantee it. need argue, numbers show us. sincerely hope think idiot remember comment deaths shoot 2 weeks. hope best want everyone safe. Remember people wear masks sooner open restart economy. part, America. agree. Still 650 new positive cases yesterday. That's point. faith much incentive good job random person assigned job minimal training, likely inadequate equipment, real connection people use cart probably particularly care safety. modi wants everything open now. experts maybe wanting lockdown cases rise breaking records. tamil nadu (that mostly chennai) wants lockdown. even saying lockdown june 30.  Holy...shit. 

That‚Äôs works all!! Please stop spreading misinformation. aren‚Äôt little bubbles airspace walk get virus hours minutes even seconds later. ever felt wind? Even slightest breeze instantly dilutes whatever air exhaled completely harmless. Earth said purpose?? Even bizarre, virus found salmon's mouth. one began strange association, another suggested salmon sharp teeth. stopped reducing number tests Dump asked too, imagine numbers would be. Japan. probably longer that.

If someone got infected protest two weeks ago, person bad case:

9 days ago started show symptoms,
7 days ago might gotten tested,
5 days ago found covid,
3 days ago sought medical attention hospitalized,
Today they're bed scared struggling breath, still hanging there.
If they're going die this, might hang anywhere 1-3 weeks body loses fight. 

But that's one death, middle this, one death show graph. know people infected person, came contact with, also start seek medical attention. give 5 days infect others point, person infects 2 people, we'd 8 infections one event, staggered similar timeline above. 

You're still going see 7 day rolling average charts. happens, people still die. another 15 days 8 infections turned 64, time see national graph, late we're bound even preventable deaths.

I take pleasure this, hope I'm wrong, simple risky event cases 2 weeks good Yes, good portion infected sick months months. Possibly never recover fully. virus damages organs body. mention 10. Spoiler. earliest person become infectious coming contact virus? person spread virus others soon 24 hours within contacting disease?  bias sub though. likely see problematic cases smooth cases don‚Äôt problems, aren‚Äôt likely seek help internet.

Personally I'd like see employee owned and/or delayed profit stock incentives workers higher ups drive 'long term' company growth instead short-term instant gratification market live with. people like charades. symbolic gesture makes people feel like they‚Äôre responsible. Don‚Äôt think deeply, though, start notice inadequate really is. OK really caused collapse? Coronavirus floor? hit floor coronavirus coronavirus?? floor, would even happened?

/s Shutdowns kill. Functioning societies key public health.

Singapore Indonesia dengue outbreak shutdown well. Latvia, people ashamed look different others scared judges laughed at. Yesterday took bus Salacgriva Riga , around 100km trip. Bus almost full could count 5 people wearing kind face protection, included. boy, weird eye contacts werent wearing any! 

It's sad truth! Thanks yes would make lot sense, it‚Äôs like asymptomatic people dying chance something else Death rate going though Protestor, doubt. would feel comfortable sitting close.  Make take back issue full refund, company. Europeans become careless recent weeks, see massive spikes. 

The US continue seeing even larger spikes. 40k cases day next month so. wear mask continue work, refinery shutting down. I'm longer worried it. take precautions rarely go anywhere outside work home. Wife works home. gets precautions, it. anchor?? hardly. people getting infected thanks months containment effort

And effect IFR? median nursing home patient dies within 5 months admittance, yes, common occurrence. city- frightening, surprising. Nobody thinks virus exists still. It‚Äôs ‚Äúover hyped media‚Äù according people live here. Wouldn‚Äôt surprised become next hot spot. India tests (per capita). much worse already. sure is. doc started gabapentin helped while. Lockdowns bought time slew things. NY surge right South went first, bet you‚Äôd see lot less death NY. lockdowns allowed time study virus figure do. agree death rates never come close April levels (relative case counts). early stick patient vent. vent last possible treatment option, lives saved that. far immunity, even double case count NY, that‚Äôs barely 10% immunity. level immunity doesn‚Äôt help all. Yea that's like stupidest thing I've heard. 

Were attributing imaginary characteristics saying ""what this, scary would be?"" weird. mom passed end February. able say lucked able things lockdown hit. course one dads old friends make scene mess wake time least something. Also better go bad decisions catching covid. way would survived since copd cirrhosis probably would infected others boot No.... losing natives modern smallpox diminishes population. Fuck families send 'loved ones' there. hospital loved ones catch this.

? say takes even prolonged contact positive person outside get disease them. passing street. think risk minimal, perception matters well. grandma died 3 years ago way I'm glad. nursing care 10-15 years 99 years old passed. Couldnt deal horror going nowadays. Dont know would deal passing away, able see one last time laying rest. adding onto friendly scientific reminder: 

Don‚Äôt expect Herd Immunity kick around 70-80% population infected vaccinated. know. bad journalism. Probably respiratory diseases source wild animals. That's every single factory.

Hell used work meat factory, storage handler (forklift driver), damn everyone working lines call drones bit slow multitask perfect level people tell even turn fights.

Don't forget FREEZING temperatures keep meat ""fresh"" warm gloves forbidden one point..

All minimum wage work slave.

And gets worse majority people speak native language can't complain really.. Watch deaths labeled ""pneumonia"" fuck Well, NYS took patients back nursing homes got infected lot patients died. provision kind ‚Äúcoronavirus nursing home‚Äù people critical state‚Äôs public health commissioner that. everyone wore masks matter direction blocked infection, incoming outgoing.   

I thought touching stuff, fomites? considered minor hazard.  True not? looks good Old Dominion. southeastern michigan! young people dying this, people horrible symptoms 90 days must agree Great Culling Human Herd People sub insane making shit scare others. Oooof high hygiene standards even corona?

Yes, high hygiene standard. Watch pork production, even normal times, flesh infectious disease prone, pressure washing tractor trailer every time enters leaves. That's lot wastage resources everything care keep disease free. top taking temperature every hot every morning. 121 millions pigs slaughtered USA alone pigs, add animals. need one mishap corona virus. 

As meat factories? Animal flesh easy home virus without corona.  nothing yelling meat factories, masks. Oh - asked wanted install phone? consent it? 

I think issue automatically roll kinds apis install back end without explicit user permission. lockdowns lifted earlier virus spreading right now. Mid Atlantic opens up, cases grow too.

Of note, cases going hospital death rates flat. Even masks worked (they don't), want spread happen get NY NJ levels immunity.

That's point. Lockdowns delayed needed happen. I‚Äôm going stay home respiratory symptoms, get sudden urge cough public I‚Äôll hold it, idk weak cough reflex it‚Äôs uncomfortable really easy hold cough Places keeping safe avoid getting infected. headline amazing reluctant people unionize. think going billionaires. saying.

Look, I'm way trying suggest COVID deadly taken extremely seriously. seems weird places we're seeing random collapsing vids countries less media freedoms. would suggest either videos coming China false media free is. sounds likely? Yeah. need bring back dating. think healthy. Lmaooo one done thought march. Cost 15‚Ç¨. Looks like flu really bad year - test came back negative. Happy probably lasting damage body, also scary wasnt real deal... hotspots ofc they‚Äôre bad bruh. :-|. Look states. Telangana fucked tho... aren‚Äôt even frikin testing. Others pretty good. Asymptomatic people far less contagious presymtomatic symptomatic people. Little bit doom fine Sunday morning? almost line connection preventing disease contracting disease. good reducing unemployment numbers?

Awesome work, thank you! largely regards unmasked jogger running unmasked walker. sat table together conversation hour without masks, might spread it. walking someone isn‚Äôt enough instantly absorb viral load. long diners aren‚Äôt spitting directly spraying snot, walking isn‚Äôt enough really catch it.

Contrary popular belief aren‚Äôt cartoon villains would deny someone surgery hospital allowed someone days arrange friend watch dog going hospital. 

The connotations word ‚Äúelective‚Äù common language don‚Äôt apply usage American medicine, it‚Äôs label applied exactly described differentiate procedures performed immediate basis versus scheduled advance (even day two advance). 

It means patient elected procedure done certain time place. patient example might choose joint replacement surgery different hospital one made diagnosis cheaper elsewhere hospital reputation better post-surgery care. decisions teeth? said 'could much as' rather 'likely' I'm sure article u/jaboyles referencing one provides good breakdown risk flu vs Covid-19 age.

I would tried link sources given quick heads up. It‚Äôs ridiculous, right.

Exactly. Xi commands. New York topped 11,000 cases daily peak, must dreaming think FL going triple Yeah, saying doomed, 100% virus, I've simply kept eye CHATS throughout whole thing, never seen yellow, even ""bad"" here. People careful really be. areas good, others aren't. also suspicious data now, every state good reason look good, sadly everything seems profit lives. things, worries little. Again, saying certainly horrible, even virus, like coincidence, every time I've optimistic this, I've proven wrong. hope going get really bad here, see really good reason to, like virus going away couple weeks anything, we'll opening eventually. looks like mortality rate lower initially thought even back February/March, IFR number reported probably higher actually was. problem never death rate seriousness illness ability virus spread. NYC learned hard way. 

Some USA still learn hard way. never learn, stupid. (Something coronavirus illustrated.) diabetes reason one might get Covid diabetes cause outcome Covid severe. 

Not mention millions people auto immune issues never known disease begins win attack. SAPHO ankylosing spondylitis might show youth. might even genetic markers might alert doctors issue. clue late 40's. Even without immune suppression medication immune system would see covid attack it. good cytokine storm happens immune system rouge troops called body goes sepsis shock. deaths even contributed covid currently, protesters protesting state declared lives worthless.

Some protesters protest public safety inconvenient.

Don't let media tell things they're equally important.

And also watch police respond protests like vs protests support black lives. Thanks! informative, known people definitely could never paid seemed get care needed. know simple question, follow up, clue driving outrageous expense places? done actual calculations, like child care, always seems fishy costs high employees make little. rates giving wife's grandmother, could rent mansion pay work full time treat like queen, go place (justifiably) disgruntled staff less qualified overworked. 5 candidates developed China. Serious question, new cases rising 30k 2 days row (usually weekend numbers low)... chances us 2nd lockdown?

Theaters reopening. Bars malls reopened states. 

Could get another shutdown theaters? like essential business like 2 months ago? ironic Florida's rush get back business ""lead way"" we'll farthest behind over. Papers receive corrections though. Either clarity fix minor issues dont drastically change outcome. wife submitted correction paper one noticed one particular page 16 frames showing gradual cell changes two frames identical. didnt catch it, none reviewers caught it, none seven research documents cited paper noticed it. least one reported. still original data correction submitted within week so. smart. LOL sweetness started weeks ago hasn‚Äôt improved changed. 100% fee ‚Äúback throat‚Äù working better tongue ‚Äî almost like taste functions primary taste. favorite thing eat whipped cream taste due launching back.

So translate taste work associating foods?

The success I‚Äôve literally smell I‚Äôm eating, trick mind tasting. Nothing else works tho No, that's great opinion carry share others. honestly think that. First, attacking families come difficult decision. Blame put family *facility* acting wrongly. 

Also, there's really strong argument nursing homes many cases. Expecting family give proper care, 24/7, person with, case, Alzheimers stressful. less people giving aid, harder is. easy someone something knowing wrong cause lot long-lasting damage future. Many family members, instance, think *good* thing keep patient Alzheimers bed (the rationale ""well wandering somewhere dangerous""). advanced age, daily exercise becomes *so* important. could making muscles weak later bringing broken hip. family members get frustrated accidentally hurt patient; we're talking group people whose skin sometimes tears rubs wall wrong. hell, family members know correct way little things like give help someone bathroom accidentally drop patient bend wrong way.

I would argue care facilities *super important*. attitudes towards poor though. need held higher standard. many facilities pinch pennies minimal, overworked staff possible use date procedures tools expensive upgrade. holy shit, covering something inevitably goes wrong. Gah! 

I guess point is: provide really important service, judge people need option, know need really mindful picking facility loved ones. Healthy= walking, talking, obviously disabled. That's great definition though. full shit. lack meaningful response US Congress leads believe true. Trumps response solidifies it. Everyone going get eventually

Yeah, heard lines beginning. pre-ordained we're getting shit. Simple, effective, reasonable steps massively reduce transmission get it. Masks, hand-washing, social-distancing. Eventually, hope vaccine, countries right seeing plummeting levels. ""We're going get anyway"" used excuse irresponsible behavior. confirm, annoying allergies known man. person? ""celebrity""? sorry. Lost dad 13 years ago death different then. Stories like wear mask public cure. minor inconvenience. Sending love. aaahh finally things changing... somebody announced something. news happens slaughterhouses obv. everybody whole time ( wanted look it.) Reminder - countries pass policy protects black lives systemic racism protests go away.

These protesters clear attainable demands. asking impossible things.

You agree message tactics order understand really simple easy path forward. mean likely condition well managed impact one's life way.  Death rate decrease doctors learn better ways treat patients hospitals get equipment like ventilators, sounds right. rapidly cases going again, still probably uptick death rate weeks. yesterday NYC. subway, 98% people wear masks. Outside sidewalks, people wearing masks. parks, people wearing masks. think still take seriously even though we‚Äôre opening up. City, Missouri hire enough contact tracers contact trace 34k people.

Might well ramp enough 60k, though. also reports authorities telling contact tracers ask people participated protests/riots/lootings certainly interesting dispassionate intellectual level, sure. human level horrifying, anyway.

It *in*teresting idea try herd immunity, yes, always [extremely risky prone many thought would turn way (or worse); easy see implemented due large amount unknowns much risk. Therefore actually implement always unethical, even *if* best case scenario would come pass. Well, guess thankful *worst* case scenarios *also* come pass, we're left bad scenario. risk far less people inside, keep moving worry Karen's chads refusing wear masks. Exactly. Seemed healthy actually healthy two different things.

If weren‚Äôt, one would ever spontaneous heart attacks strokes. antibody studies. Infection Fatality Rate improve treatments improve. Antibody treatments couple months help lot. fingers crossed you. Life western Australia pretty much normal except social distancing laws... reduced numbers coffee shops, restaurants etc... overall, really good. Probably. new deaths dramatic decrease despite clear plateau cases makes sense Yes. Unfortunately, seemed like carried weight chest/neck. makes respiratory effort greater carried weight stomach/legs. 

We finding obesity risk factor own. Hey China bot Okay, dismiss experience. Guess thing OP described never happened. current curve somewhere @ 7k cases per day next Friday. easily 10k following Friday.

I've come realization thing going force States hand body bags. wash hands touching processing meat. death rate low?

Oxford Massachusetts  Sorry, claiming US deaths similar EU? hear from? Trump thinks kills primarily blacks Hispanic‚Äôs, he‚Äôs completely wrong that. Yeah, literally impossible person keep publications dense field, let alone critique ""peer review done better."" 

Something needs squeaky wheel. Scientists make SARS vaccine currently sitting freezer Texas somewhere, never got government funding tested humans understand means. hoping 100,000 deaths mid-july? hate say it, born 25 week gestation, lungs stellar. Even 20 years ago, 25 week preemies survive lungs developed enough. days, wonder poor kid succumbed coronavirus. 

It appears coronavirus virus exploits weakness cardio-pulmonary system. High blood pressure, COPD, obesity weight carried neck/chest, diabetes, etc.

Condolences family. awful. ... morbidly obese (based photo). spend billions preventing disaster lose trillions nothing? Wage slave rings true. aside, heat map bullshit. +100 cases low metric. Canada, hundred cases day, colour Brazil 54,000 new cases You‚Äôd think could scare bigger sample 35 patients point... Literally reopen 2 months South. You‚Äôre going admit you‚Äôre wrong sometime. actually know lot virus.

We researched thoroughly since discovered late December/ early January things like conditions infections likely transmit mostly done modeling known outbreaks. 

The COVID-19 cruise ships great example investigate outbreaks piece together imperfect knowledge. 

This also peer review studies important. world went thinking asymptomatic transmission occur, seeing German case ""proved"" occur, seeing study walked back. 

As result, lot clarity. good understanding virus behaves different settings. unethical, thank god, knowingly infect people test examples virus strain behaves various settings modeling understand bounds limits (can suspended frozen reanimate, survive baking sun).

And we're constantly seeing articles new outbreaks restaurants, places work, outdoor funerals... see good analysis outbreaks several weeks. 

I work hospital close touch Infectious Disease Department recommendation err side caution (stopping short unsustainable practices). 

They still eat fast food. bring lunches work. cannot fathom taking high risk dine out. still wash groceries sink. go grocery shopping. hang friends. still isolating even though live Florida we're permitted things. 

I know going get lot studies help think could reach local regional experts ask recommendations. wasn‚Äôt healthy, diabetic. Pre existing conditions well known increase risk complications. Ethipoia probably pretty glad got rid Tedros, form covering multiple epidemics health minister. actually know lot virus.

wtf man swallow benzos head checked behaviour sane

i would wish wonderful day something posts makes think feeling wonderful, favor get help That's also bullshit. They've wrong MANY fucking times already nothing done it. run rumors anecdotes. Maryland supposed one states better / well. deaths/day currently x5 EU. Deaths lag cases, going get worse. Canada seems like slightly less insane version America. everything place go backed last minute. Still regret it.

Hawaii also bad handle island life live Honolulu ""excuse me, sir... Would say chances going New York extremely likely, somewhat likely, likely?"" bar cost lives? You‚Äôre trading lives lives, period.

Colonoscopies, EGDs, stress tests, heart caths, list save quite lives every year, aren‚Äôt aware. many areas, performing procedures unless immediate severe symptoms. Well wait see. Looking things progressed far predicting doom gloom seems excessive. Maybe see local events again, chances outbreak detected much easily first wave. simply won‚Äôt blindsided. 

You also see ramifications extending lockdown measures. economically also terms mental health example. single digit new cases per milion day loosen measures  every country division problem, US seems struggle forming effective covid response, clearly societal division cannot blamed. Imagine say ""the US struggles fight covid 19 blue flag"". Clearly that's absurd right? dude seems like real insufferable cunt. Syphilis bacterial infection completely different, cancer virus, chickenpox / herpes return reason believe coronavirus strains properties speculate. easy make virus sound scary start theoretically attributing terrible diseases it, what's point. 

Yes obviously want avoid getting it. is.. kind company work horrible pandemic. I'm Account Manager company distributes 5HR energy, sunglasses various electronic accessories cell phones primarily gas stations. First, get hourly raise like many companies elected do. given 100% audits (which could've got anyway) told call quarter (3 months) would eligible it. 2 months laid 25% Account Managers nationwide expanded territories. managers working pandemic promised bonus call longer eligible finish quarter. territory big I'm working literally 6 days week, visiting 14 locations day, driving 1400 miles week feel like ticking time bomb inevitable catch COVID. pro good money -- can't find anything even remotely close I'm making currently I'm scared death. family, can't go work. hope stays way. Sadly we've seen fast virus get hand states. People need stay vigilant, keep right thing stay safe, getting comfortable giving quick way see numbers rise, we've seen states. Anti-racist policies aimed dismantling racism pretty clear.

It's like, ""Oh charity donate to?""

Think like this. want get friend's house. say, ""I agree go house differ street live."" would dumb we'd agree dumb.

The destination Anti-racism extremely clear non-negotiable.

If know maybe well versed think are. could say large country, people China Brazil Black lives matter!! Protest more! That‚Äôs irrelevant though unless person wears mask 24/7. Allergy symptoms don‚Äôt go away second pollen goes away. finds way getting people‚Äôs houses wake allergies day. Pollen also get eyes, symptoms may itchy eyes. still cause coughing, sneezing, etc. like someone eats something allergic break hives. allergen doesn‚Äôt affect system touches first. around people sick wearing mask putting mask taking mask lot, becomes possible route exposure. 

This chance, extremely small chance distancing, washing mask surrounded sick people. 

You foolish. think keep go outdoor restaurants. indoor places open places keep mask whole time. Even SK trouble indoor dining. Hard agree Masks work applied correctly, Americans smart enough so.


That harsh truth. Yeah except workforce diversified much unionize 

And anyone even thinks forming union corporate factory. would clean house. 

I'm line right would replace people heart beat tried get company work spend 5 million dollars need get AC. work 100 degree conditions 12 hours cant walk away line use restroom. Thats reality manufacturing purpose Whilst probably true, one thing agree government (they're bunch dicks regardless) is, one really position say whether UK far ahead cases compared others meaningful figures released individual countries. I'm saying were/are par efficiency Germany, EU country's figures place omit certain surroundings.

The UK government forced include care homes, home deaths alongside hospital deaths.

The telling figure country releases excess death figures. give people better picture. Also, point deaths covid death certificate included UK figures (may actually still case, idea tbh) filed alongside deaths caused primarily covid. one set figures among many, countries use uniformed approach know. may never happen may never know. mean, look happened Spain, care homes abandoned residents left fend themselves.

Keep good fight! Spread fact common sense, might get someone. suspect ""asymptomatic"" people dropping dead virus induced blood clots/heart attacks/strokes long virus spreading... Agree. I'm realizing start giving excuses like age geographical isolation, really track looking worldwide scale. States germany also lot power (in fact federal government little power pandemic measures) yet managed coordinated response. US horribly split politically. 

When shit started hit fan party lines didn‚Äôt matter anymore basically parties endorsed lockdown. discussion best reduce measures, essentially details know didn‚Äôt slow spread? Slow compared whom? open country going cases closed one...I wouldn‚Äôt think debate that.

How much think underreporting by? so, sorry lost dad. lost dad 34. must hard family able funeral. say grieve unapologetically long need loss sorrow testament depth love, although know necessarily comforting. grieve love. DM need talk Ivan Duque stupid enough decisions There's far far less people higher income brackets lower income brackets, especially Brazil. bulk base poor religious average. Interesting comment either got deleted showing me. Mind summarizing tried linking? bet sub auto deletes links posts. Businesses end giving bribes cops job anyway? Like Atlanta Atlanta Police Foundation gave $2 million bonuses, squad cars, equipment. Makes nice little tax-write business, also helps ""convince"" cops protect well. foundation also built houses cops well, easily look up, google ""Atlanta Police Foundation Donates Police"", see ton examples. Works cities well. yeah, cutting budget affect police departments, lot get whole lot people realize ""special"" donations like this, benefits sides immensely. Another reason vegetarian ... least eat mainstream meat 3 times day. Places reopened virus gone, clear instead proceed caution. PSA: wear masks, wash/sanitize hands, social distancing. None stressed enough. Ugh aunt NICU nurse Vic. daughter also studying nurse due placement end month. supposed come back Singapore visit last month July, Sept (now postponed) wedding. 

I'm really hoping nothing happens especially work. feeling optimistic numbers went down. feel like every time feel bit hope, gets dashed quickly.

This really sucks. good thing got 50% Nandos nurses. Check 1918. can‚Äôt learn shit. fact smart phones Internet doesn‚Äôt help all. still dumb always think 4700 accurate number. Holy shit sub fill doomers, open weeks Netherlands didn‚Äôt see spike see it. ""I become mid-level bureaucrat state health system,"" said bright spark. Ever. Tennessee trending well shown graph. California passed NJ 2nd nation cases. pandemic far over. Michigan great! know who's even better? *Also Michigan* Tbf aren‚Äôt many countries aren‚Äôt EU Europe, big deal context That‚Äôs reports said. also forgo seatbelts logic? Yikes went harris teeter. went beforr got rental cause know everyone checks 4pm heads grocery stores. Kroger fly zone far I'm concerned. parking lot PACKED. Harris teeter much quieter last year though. definitive reason people completely asymptomatic? blood type? needed fuckin experts figure out? Celebrating modest ""flattening"" curve shows US graded curve. Isnt title wrong though? Isnt one specific cause transmission? literally lack proper mask use... fair, European countries competent leaders. use Unexpanded drink bottles bought /s Someone's gotta get karma points still ongoing ‚Äúdebate‚Äù whether masks work. Sorry came across jerk **THE Florida world

FTFY Cant imagine 6k person even spread covid tens thousands person protests country.  really want put Chinese technology western world? You‚Äôd definitely lose battle. good news coronavirus!

From perspective humans, less so. Sadly cases even enough, long machines run will. mind boggling let politics decide science believe. 
The increase numbers diagnosed people spreading other. testing happening people feeling symptoms. PEOPLE IT. 

The idiot chief explained conservathink world yesterday- need slow testing. Yeah, stop virus.

 you, like him, convinced testing virus issue, better start burning labs hospitals. Thank clearing up. I'm old enough remember eating Chi Chi's restaurant old enough really remember closed them. doubt ever everyone life touched loved one dying virus. might take science wearing face coverings less freedom staying alive/healthy. number Thank you! think would leading news. Minnesota‚Äôs numbers aren‚Äôt spike (at least yet), cases going flat rate government simply deferred experts, unfortunately ""experts"" Tegnell Giesecke created fantasy world virus basically harmless (\~0,1% IFR) extremely contagious.

Actually, calculate total number cases known number deaths using IFR 0.1%, Sweden would total 5 million cases now.

Leaving aside whether 0.1% ever reasonable estimate IFR, explains believed herd immunity far away.

The problem comes actually look regional numbers rather treating one national statistic. 2,252 deaths, IFR 0.1%, Stockhom would 2.25 million cases now, seemingly impossible given population region 2.3 million.

With recent antibody testing, estimated true infection rate nationwide around 6%, meaning total 600,000 cases IFR 0.83%, much reasonable number within range estimates suggested numerous studies.

The kicker is, 40% Swedish population eventually infected, IFR 0.83% total number deaths exceed 33,000. appreciate humility shown guys saw 


yeah did, fuck besides continuing wear mask work economy going spiral control again.  Oh dear I‚Äôm sorry going truly tiring I‚Äôm sick stupidity. One day get married kids hope niece nephews turn like her..... No. 

The UK officially left Jan 31st.

Source: UK government UK left EU transition period, new rules come place 1 January 2021. That's they're saying, what's going happen.

For record, I'd love proven wrong. fact takes decades develop new vaccine. never done less year. Maybe first time, likely. Thailand safe long totally closes borders outside travelers.

But unless that, people absolutely bring virus countries, begin spread exponentially nightlife scene. wear car way home dont touch face hands washed. We've tried nothing, we're ideas! Look local producers. home-made ones made glasses users mind, joking said dozen different designs glasses. know DIY designs people insert metal wire top seam mask, push wire nose forms tight seal air escape top part mask fog glasses. found design effective, less comfortable full nose guard. 

If looking online look terms like ""cotton face masks nose wire"" kind design. *‚Äù‚ÄúWhat would call continued transmission flare-ups.‚Äù* - Dr. Monto history wrong! Europe suppressed police killings. U.S. not. kills bacteria. Chcchi e coli lettuce supplier iirc Dealt Indeed, disingenious say killed them.  boots taste? Yeah effectively social distance double teachers build buildings. don‚Äôt really see happening neither say isnt is. read discussions. Fact many people also deny vaccines general mean true create consequneces stay away bats criminally underreported issue pandemic.

I think miss-spelled overreported. Definitely criminally though. saw live.. show showed people calling doctor bunch people fanning someone rally signs got carried out... know report anything Trump stopped talking good minute got carried out. Looked like protest first live maga country (western pa). Last time out, majority people didn‚Äôt masks. pretty common assumption CA. Everyone sick last winter, even people like sister weren‚Äôt, convinced they‚Äôve already virus. dad sickest ever January keep reminding people tested positive influenza A. say flu test inaccurate must COVID-19 time.

It‚Äôs quite worrying. US focusing masks, Europe focusing social distancing.  EU population 515M

US population 330M

Now go look graph I‚Äôve given writing response 2nd wave headlines Oh some, find hilarious KY many people state refuse wear mask simply aren‚Äôt sick.  optimistic think numbers way fall. yet tge opposite side.. hipocrite? ""Supressed"" LOL wonder number asymptomatic cases falling. I'm choking all

But, here, refer notion Chinese accused hiding cases, almost every country fault at

You can't detect every asymptomatic case, comment, mentioned China likely unintentionally hiding cases, like every country

It malicious itself, certainly people accuse China of

So, might still think ruined me, but, still prove China actively hiding cases Aw poor wittle snowflake :( Fits science. Lockdowns effective, social distancing. Masks limited effect good effective ways option deny feel shame.

Meanwhile Trump thing Lafayette Square proud did. America shitehole

Source: live people mad cpuple weeks things wont change 

Maybe pay settlements thats cheaper shutting production issue protests making people forget there's pandemic going on. IDC reason protest, wear fucking mask. Protest must atleast wear mask. Huge amount protesters seen people wearing masks news agencies are. America fucked getting really really bad here. Also: memorial day events mean yeah, we‚Äôre constantly wrestling 40% population rural, less educated, hell bent listening expert matter whatsoever. Yep, unfortunately we're still right mess here, government useless throughout. Starting stopping now? Protesters contributed sure, cause. video that? can't find anything second person mention here. data says otherwise, UK still trending downwards despite beginning reopening weeks ago cases contacts? work contact tracers. Usually nurses interviewing positive cases get contact info contacts take over. done positive interviews I've needed ask specifically they've protest, much way specifically ask they've church, salon, grocery store. ask tell everywhere they've been. time ability go list possible places they've cross off. trained heavily use OPEN ended questions anything. contract tracers following local testing facilities protest sites?

As far I'm aware, one setting testing facilities protest sites? think state's health department would go either personally. I'm imagining talking like mobile testing pods done occasion? can't imagine willing go test near protests, protest. tend done uhh relaxed areas potential danger testers. quite possibly misinterpreted meant question. answer all, I'm sorry. addition, noticing younger demographics mainly elderly?

Honestly over. would say noticeable trend sticks occupation rather age. again, mostly handle contacts question could also mean notice younger older demographics contact people? mean something else entirely? mean he‚Äôs CEO, really think would say anything else? understand, know masks reduce COVID-19 transmission, since one making it, refusing wear mask? aware Europe Italy, right? checking. Yeah, think technically may still ""first wave"" colloquially happen next month two absolutely ""second wave"" require new series overburdened hospitals, business closings, perhaps even lockdowns. guess missed headlines study showing antibodies undetectable several CV9 survivors 2-3 months? Deep Roy every extra. protests, reopening, memorial day - contributing this. country ignore police brutality? honest, opening Denmark slow. visited Copenhagen days ago (the border control joke btw) first friday bars could open. think take Danish numbers compared Swedish never closed all. 

But yes, nobody wearing masks. see single mask night. honest seen many masks neither Sweden Denmark since virus started. 
Social distancing people believe focus social distancing focus masks makes difference virus spreading Europe US. wow! read collapse yahoo yesterday. assumed exhaustion. Finland Nordic countries general also wanting wider personal space begin with? Surely cultural aspect least impact infection rate easily spreads? wish looked individual state basis, Northeast specifically New York 
/New Jersey reached numbers similar Western European countries. Face masks used pretty much everyone too, I‚Äôm proud went infected best set handle second wave. way knowing point whether covid-induced treatment-induced. pretty common taking antibiotics boatload. Canada, take note... couldn‚Äôt pull chance hell. Except shareholders want move country expensive per capita least value cost health care system world? reading headline like ""what dumbasses Trumpistan now""....

....then saw Europe flair. Thanks! I'm US want order something come way I'll see find something similar. know ones specifically designed prevent fogging. handed masks people checked temperature entrance. Nordics all, cant Scandinavian language (in)transparent beginning.

Oh. narrative again. Surely certainly one country (in)transparent till instead. Kinda. mean Italy let everyone die.

No one left get infected. basically everywhere asian countries trained obey law country wear masks Nobody wears mask though. literally approach less states. Stop crying victimizing pathethic DeSantis acknowledging reality?  I'm flabbergasted! mean? EU 30% people denser too. Fewer people solo driving cars living large plots land; people likely take public transit live multi-family units. anything think view overly generous US. I‚Äôm Toronto masks aren‚Äôt mandatory anywhere yet. Mandatory transit July 2 - nobody enforcing rule, it‚Äôs expected... Number 1 baby. Yea /s  Public transportation since weeks saying that? I've seen claims exceeding capacity. Get involved care.

 Nursing homes state regulated one seems take even enough time find out. state dictates input nurses seems ignored. 

 Here's little true story:

The patient elderly lost leg. Sometimes unaware loss attempted get wheelchair walk. course work well one leg. Downright dangerous, fact. 

So family home felt good idea strap safety. 

State inspectors said, ""You cannot restrain her."" 

Family said, ""Safety measures need taken."" 

Home said ""We must state orders shut us down."" 

So family took court. Court decided favor state, course. State's rules cannot bent safety patient. 

This clean, caring community facility. wanted safely restrain patient allowed best. 

I'm sure lot gossip condemning nursing home easier learning facts.

I worked facility. quit. got call go back work week. deal public whole thing freaking out. even virus stresses me, arguing people masks, uncomfortable day work extra pay (masks, gloves hours sucks), boss acting like jumping opportunity work him. Even wife who's safely work home seems giving shit it. I'm terrified corona point still want risk it. 
I like this. increased risk blood clots. also normal blood clots. almost like blood clots major mode disease (that inflammation). Even ""mild"" cases, many presenting signs blood clots capillaries (COVID toes skin rashes clots). knows ~20% population increased blood clotting tendency even know (hundreds genetic disorders, quite common usually require precipitating event cause clot).

There proper data post-viral fatigue percentages high. mean could be, took Feb-March western countries. See one article indicating 60% anyone tested positive NL still breathing symptoms, many others seems less rare me. increasing accounts everywhere widespread issues incredibly long ""recovery"" times /r/COVID19positive went handful people experiencing early symptoms early March, joined, sub like 90% everyone stuck 2-4+ months effects (I realize selection bias looks like standard disease course anyone non-asymptomatic anyway). slowly getting better ""just coronavirus"" since human strains really this, mostly cause regular bronchitis pneumonia worst go away normal way (I know, I've infections multiple times), SARS MERS fortunately STOPPED easier stop that's moot point. average person planet need fear SARS MERS year outbreaks stayed localized. still seemed like standard respiratory distress syndrome effects one baffling doctors much really like those. German unification famously difficult, I‚Äôm US number 1 baby indication happens countries running ""herd immunity"" strategy. Noone wants business economies suppressed anyway ""herd"" scared getting sick dying continue normal activities economy requires. Humans ""herd"" policy crazy stupid. I've following group countries since March; Europe, North, Central South America. Two things become painfully obvious. first countries Latin America, exception Uruguay, unable (mostly), unwilling, (Brazil, Mexico), contain spread COVID-19. Western Europe Canada different story. Moving averages new cases, hospitalizations deaths taken form. grew, reached peak plummeted.

The US exception - starkly regional issue. States, (New York, Michigan), great success containment others appear let things get control. actually aren‚Äôt different Brazil , mean sure don‚Äôt live Favela‚Äôs Americans live crowded households . mention travel quite widely . There‚Äôs way COVID-19 wasn‚Äôt going circulate US. umm reddit news somewhere. I‚Äôll see find. day, still many people wearing using creative ways make look like wearing one officially EU practice, signed main agreements like European Economic Area, Schengen border control etc. homes like that. fix ones are.

And, ironically, many elderly people actually gain degree community they're placed home people near age group. Arguably better stuck home seeing almost no-one. yet main division America urban/rural ofc fucking haven't, addition openign early got aboslute fucktards rioting streets. That‚Äôs awesome

I know get lot headlines school daycare closures worldwide. people forget isolated schools shutting rest continue function. 

Seems like 99% schools able keep outbreak happening lot noisy nonsense. 

Are claiming owners power force players play, anything matter? lot people seem care area. friends family generally older people not. 

Even wearing nose taking talk phone. 

At point try stay home much possible virus going claim many lives wants due people caring. 

I think live stream 24-7 tv showing people going survive virus. Maybe seeing believing people maybe truly selfish. Fuck Greg Abbott!!! someone living Europe, see one big difference: close borders deal problem country country. Italy explodes corona, Greece stop people coming over.

I know US even could close state borders wanted. European Union political entity 27 countries. UK left EU, still part continent Europe. Fuck Gregg Abbott!!! experiment school district school district using incorrect facts paint Black people negative light. fact can‚Äôt see racist shows racist are. even state 95% liberal. recent research shows lack voters 25% conservative, 43% moderate, 29% liberal. false argument/statement part racist culture. Tbf though UKs population density much much higher US Acting semi-repsonsible went window second media politicians said OKAY gather thousands millions protest. 

I yesterday one mask social distancing. Blame media upset this. It‚Äôs exacerbated commander chief traffics division we're reopening, that's matters, right? 

God damned fools. Yea ever since got mask fog glasses find easier leave on. touch face less, van immediately wash hands removing leave entire trip. definition upper class ""earns USD20k/year"". .. right. Sending people homes sit, isolated, malnourished soiled diapers obviously best outcome mankind come with? Great news! live communes. People move away parents and/or live properties like parents. I'm asking question based realities modern life.  Literally everything back normal part California except movie theaters. It‚Äôs like weeks. 

It‚Äôs safe. wear mask like measures, improving odds, perfecting them. Great!  already going many places start. WHO's global pandemic declaration. Since would never admit much population actually never bought shred took shred precaution addition cold season year. So... excluding UK already?? though official leaving date 31st December.... even government, bro? countries spread France Get out. Shutting early isolating workers kills viral spread get back full speed faster full workforce instead crippling business weeks even months, ultimately better country economy. course ""simple solution"" ""no effects"" means even trying genuine argument. didnt wear condom? bat wear hot lingerie? yet. transition period. doubt it. Mother‚Äôs Day didn‚Äôt see surge. Father‚Äôs Day gatherings generally immediate family, since it‚Äôs summer lot outside barbecue. memorial weekend didn‚Äôt wreck everyone Father‚Äôs Day certainly won‚Äôt. People dumb wearing masks stores/crowded bars/restaurants washing hands going main problem, that‚Äôs limited Father‚Äôs Day. ""Suffer consequences decision""? decision?

How family's fault mother happened contract alzheimers late 80's? 

And no, answer. Nevermind family child prior - child lives one-bedroom apartment supposed ailing mother middle alzheimers needs permanent support? Yes now. seems U.S stalling. Politics lives. Yet again. cool. ‚ÄúNo forecast exceeding capabilities‚Äù

That‚Äôs blatantly wrong lol

You gonna ignore fact it‚Äôs possible full reopening without infections rising? paper masks mean surgical masks? actually really good covid. One study showed equal effectiveness N95.

Covid mostly behaving like droplet (eg influenza) like airborne (eg measles).  Italy here: USA badically moronic control country.

You guys saw happened us. big time advantage still managed fuck up.

The fun fact still magic absurd: wearing masks social distancing.

Why fucking hard that?

And even BLM protests.

Really loss words here, plain absurd. lot though , heard fed crime . turned partner last nite said. ‚ÄúI think lost pride American‚Äù. makes sad. much hate giving wings conspiranoia, much think USA brought upon developed healthcare system: *man* good China. initial spread virus intentional, think was, been, genius move Chinese. Yes, they've suffered, knew way, way better prepared USA. acting kind spectator sport? takes village.

We role play.

You're arrogant asshole it, yeah. get billionaire CEOs. Someone tend care village. Cases leading indicator. 

Hospitals overrun lagging indicator.

Once hospitals mess, late. (It's arguably late even now, better waiting another weeks.)

Worth noting people like saying weeks ago nothing worry cases increasing. bad peaceful protestors angry rioters midst. Perhaps were, tear gas would necessary. I'm sorry bud.  honestly nothing guys, fuck ever feel yah. London England yes understand cases going down, simply open flood gates without better controls. takes 1 start pyramid.  goal excuse given incompetent government.

Competence, like new Zealand, means eliminating virus First, issue guns systemic racism. Literally thing mentioned headline talked article. vomiting ""guns"" silly dumb. Guns systemic racism. Systemic racism systemic racism. keep next time. 

What systemic racism? UK police literally arrest thousands per year ""offensive"" online speech. literally report someone police something offended you, police investigate &amp; log incident report gets lumped hate crime statistics. proof needed, based entirely victim's perception permanently logged onto background report employers access. Second 

Did even read article? 

""Ken Marsh, chair Metropolitan Police Federation, said bias among officers factor stop search, crime was. ‚ÄúWhy black youths disproportionately stopped? \[As long as\] want us stop young males stabbed death ‚Äì God forbid, couldn‚Äôt think anything worse ‚Äì we‚Äôll job, think we‚Äôre well.‚Äù 

So certain crime like knife crime prevalent group say reasonable they're searched more? issue parroting shit taking context. Third, BLM UK requested tangible policy driven measures. Literally demands often found protester chants signs. 

Ah yes, mindless chanting signs, happened open debate &amp; discussion? Oh that's right, SJWs capable actually conveying thoughts. corporate backed movement. movement co-opted. 

Lmao sure, corporations opening pushing movement websites &amp; received hundred million liberal foundations. Soros Marx*st Marx*sts hate Soros. 

Pattrisse Cullors admitted &amp; Alicia Garza trained organizers/Marxists, connections Soros' foundation. 2018, 30,3% population lower classes. Middle class 55,3% population, rest comprised upper class upper middle class. disputing fact religious average, definitely *poorer*. population demographics argument, isolated sentence, dishonest hides reality average Bolsonaro voter bigger chance [not poor compared non-Bolsonaro voters. Tough cookie crack agree. see change back smaller packed bars clubs bottle service separated tables happening longer run thing persists. 

Sucks like small pubs crowded bars hate clubs. honestly space king comes covid. honestly think wearing damn tshirt face better nothing, thing actually aerosol based like people suspect. 

It's kinda telling look states high rates positives compared states require masks. 

Florida, texas, arizona mask orders. study found serious side effects low dosages used. Someone already symptoms taking prevent getting worst. Majority deaths due overreaction immune system cytokine storms. steroid reduces that. It‚Äôs absolutely clear COVID19 killer disease thought. 

If would eaten half ass shelter place. 

Countries less resources would overrun type this. 

It didn‚Äôt happen. 

It smart shelter place first, it‚Äôs time get back normal. 

Go ahead keep masks however hate getting cold every 4 months ‚ÄúWith people like this‚Äù meaning exactly? much better options Europe even speak native language. Personally Poland born moved Canada young age, would move Germany heart beat could find job field. ever get answer this? shop town there's sign goes ""your nose goes inside mask. Wearing mask nose like wearing underpants keeping cock out. Yeah that's people states taking seriously fucking around stupid shit cynic wonders wealthy communities likely idiots refuse wear mask. dont mind ""incidents"" ""minor"" rules, long incidents poor citizens. Please tell wrong. answer. Look first sentence.

Not good reading thing, you. meat packing plant county major source covid here. deaths reported outside Northern regions. London yet see many people without mask bus anywhere really. lmao, racist say black people wear masks? fucking moron Taiwan #1 though need lettuce fruit..f''k health. Mostly work sick part. experienced neither people around me. Maybe generational thing Idk.

I agree said industries trying squeeze every single minute workers. worldwide problem. difference countries squeeze little harder others. Floridian, I‚Äôm making sure family self quarantines can‚Äôt trust anyone else to. go out, mask, Publix occasional drive that‚Äôs it. situation August (or, god forbid, worse) I‚Äôm sending kid school. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll exactly, I‚Äôm sending Petri dish middle school. That‚Äôs insane. American here. US fucked. I‚Äôm disagreeing, questioning guy said cases locked again, happen Sweden would bet lot money doesn‚Äôt happen US state either Deaths Per Million Due C-19
U.K. 628
Spain 606
Italy 572
Sweden 500
France 454
U.S. 369
Netherlands 355
Ireland 347 actively trying make happen? hope so, rather staying US complaining terrible is.  Okay, propose a, say, child lives apartment take care surviving parent middle-stages alzheimers, poor mobility? Give us time, we'll get there. We're number one! USA! USA! fly, let's back envelope type calculation.   Staff time probably costs average least $25 per hour higher paid people like nurses factored in.   

CMS says "" preferred minimum staffing level nursing home residents received three hours total staff time per day -- two hours nursing assistant time one hour licensed nurse time. "" $75 per day right there, counting non-contact people like administrators, clerks, cooks, custodial staff.   probably put closer $100 per day people.  Add margin, building equipment, utilities, probably gets $150 pretty quick.  

The better places probably even staff.  probably underestimated costs. money literally issue, wouldn‚Äôt go. Excellent effective, see issue mass production distribution testing system requiring power source. dunno man, it‚Äôd nuts people started falling here. ask, ‚Äúhow might happen‚Äù could look things like blood oxygen levels low, higher stress, general fatigue. It‚Äôs completely realm possibility population hundred million people, especially considering obesity epidemic people shit lung capacity begin with, something like may happen. I'm guessing they're ""slowing testing"" also....  monkey ~~see~~ gets told, monkey ~~do~~ does. Yes know actually think anyone know die it. link them? anyone actually going admit that?.. ... lmao. virus 0.2% mortality going shave 20 years average human lifespan? It‚Äôll interesting see federal policy towards covid dictated following weeks. 

The presidents speech last night made clear covid prevention control priorities federal government. Pretty much. job high contact public saw there‚Äôs good chance could get sick kill them. (We separate states cases area worse there‚Äôs right now) One political group US trying see inflection points, deeper in. That's completely idiotic. Pro athletes make money skills scarce (only 25 people world good enough NBA stars) valuable (sports brings obscene amount revenue TV, ticket sales, endorsements, etc.). say dont deserve money say believe laws supply demand - absurd argument make. Actually, Apple Google's Exposure Notification system completely private. suggest learn read link comment thread.

I wish people took time understand it. comment like COUNTRIES MATTER üò°üò°üò°

Yeah, countries also problems doesn‚Äôt negate real fact America problems 100% division. Well, suppressed Coronavirus testing least. would've guessed? protesters clear attainable demands. asking impossible things.

What demands? think depends city...I friends Rome Paris def wearing masks. I'm looking advice. mom 78, relatively healthy, currently rural location safe, social contact here. virus happened crown fitted dentist NYC, cost $2000. go NYC June 29 doctors appointment (absolutely necessary) considering going dentist crown put also front slightly chipped tooth fixed. worried puts long she'll pay another $2000 crown longer fit, chipped tooth might get worse, leading dental problems could force go city infection rates higher now. afford lose $2000 would prefer course. 

The dentist taking lot measures reduce infection risk, including air purifiers hose partial enclosure near patient suck patient's breath, fogging room patient disinfectant, cleaning surfaces regularly, testing office employees, temperature checks patients. dentist 60, he's high risk category well concerned health.

What would situation, good amount retirement savings money huge issue? US also reopenings even though cases still high gone down. Serious Misinformation Nobody looks particularly close together Soooo protester surge freaking about? r/ihatesportsball Nope strong denial media massive protests civil unrest US could contribute recent spike new cases. Since good cause, would virus hit protesters families? Jesus christ, can't anyone learn anyone else's mistakes? might taking bit extreme, live risk folk. enough space backyard get exercise, past that, I'm leaving house reason groceries rare luxury mealn Lawsuits incoming 3...2...1... I've resigned believe new normal vaccine island nation helps think point it‚Äôs way get cases down. done large countries like Canada too. Canada isn‚Äôt quite yet NZ levels they‚Äôre great job. coworker returning MI Texas week long vacation pretty firmly anti-mask know wear one traipsing around. worried be? silly scared mind? can't shake feeling dread returning. I‚Äôm sorry explanation makes sense

daily NEW cases plateau since basically April last week

Daily NEW deaths continually plummeted despite Shocking... True. Important discussion possibilities point. suspect mask wearing places seeing surge part anti mask. 

The warm weather situation interesting. Many theory hot weather slowed virus. One thing probably say hot weather going slow thing down. 

Air conditioning interesting theory. think that's lot office buildings struggling reopen. We'll see guess.  ass-to-ass dense markets. huge cluster tents/small booths small walkways filled people. California potentially lock gets control. 

It‚Äôs already control. Ah, course three weeks, we've went from

- Going outdoors killing Grandma (florida beaches)

- Supporting protests (its outdoor spread disease, apparently)

- protests Chen Qiushi still disappeared far know. videos never mainstream media far know, either. reason is, imho, reason US told everyone masks work beginning. Avoid panic, keep machine running costs. Stay safe there. drink bleach cure virus. friend passed away 30 childhood diabetes. understand comorbidity, managed extremely well, worked out, ate well, pretty shape build overweight. 

I think many people trying refer people, even condition, weren‚Äôt knocking death‚Äôs door. way would Alex died like hadn‚Äôt contracted virus. 

There seems idea comorbidity means you‚Äôre practically already dying, understand context used saying still healthy. thing across border Netherlands. outbreaks too, also industrial farms also staffed immigrants known poor working conditions. Look picture... sending interviewers surgical masks interview confirmed cases, trace contacts. could go wrong? mysterious all.

There typically lag many weeks deaths start rise. takes couple days 2 weeks show symptoms. couple days hospitalization. intubated, days weeks death. could weeks month start see rising death counts again. states rising case counts anticipated rising death counts course summer. Everyone anticipated pickup Sept 1st everyone goes back school.

 

The dropping death rate function massively improving caseload initial epicenters: New York, New England, Pennsylvania, Michigan. ""Indians like Chinese""

That's true. They're disorganized significantly less progressive. chances us 2nd lockdown?

Literally zero. economy important human lives. data/info widespread use Avifavir/Favipiravir going? helping significant way? first moved town live health insurance. went county free clinic two years, best health care ever had. Maybe coincidence, doctors aren‚Äôt trying live insurance company metrics salesmen pushing drugs them, seems like get compassionate genuine treatment. son born army hospital profit also motive, also great experience. seems lot plants outbreaks. anyone work type plants? I'm wondering type mitigation used try stop outbreaks. worry many hospitals thing. Everyone's got incentive look like next ""New York"", worries seemingly little oversight gathering/presenting data. Especially considering seems everyone hellbent opening soon get away it. Bob Dole makes great Cannes fruit. Evidence seems indicate that's idiots live wonder DC, VA MD going like, since states close together 7 days ago Florida added 1,800 cases.

today added 4,700 cases. one engaged me. didn‚Äôt solicit comment. childish pick fight, get ass handed claim fight isn‚Äôt worth it. better next time. Yes. stupidity exclusive americans, happens everywhere. Europe EU same, wish someone cared simple concept. story. again. results. shut early temporarily. Would less losses lives finances. Beginning understand American companies succeed they're good business generous corporate welfare country provides. diabetes caused jump bridge. I'm sorry! might consolation terrible case bronchitis winter also like took almost 3 months get over. Hopefully better soon! enjoy pancakes. :) Well, hate break you, know big topic lot, people hardly wear masks europe. either weather basic restrictions (keeping distance bit more, massive events) work, combination. masks. failed see stark reality cruelty greed surrounds you. Ignoring evil permeates country make go away. still see death friends feeds selfishness, greed, cruelty. Elective medical procedures - people many hospital tested getting surgery. 2 weeks enough time cases causing spread. cases present symptoms less time.  think trying find information supports want believe. No. I'm frustrated people taking seriously. point death statistics dying kind annoying evil smirk, fall within demographics. However, fall within demographics getting case puts hospital. hear two weeks, now.

That means hospital bill least six figures, possible lifelong health conditions render immune compromised, second wave hits, they'll need stay home, wear mask social distance. surprised. fucks engaged widespread systematic fraud, 21st century, even bother cover tracks. we're ruled criminals. we're ruled STUPID criminals. said majority workers tested positive work company‚Äôs sorting facility don‚Äôt interact customers. One truck driver one mechanic also tested positive, said.    
   company, operating throughout Marin‚Äôs coronavirus shutdown ‚Äúessential‚Äù business, followed stringent safety protocols, according Garbarino. Workers required maintain least six feet distance other, sanitize hands wear masks personal protective equipment, said. basically called child-like immature. trying pedantic claim weren't, STILL it. 

Whatever, think done here. way conversation productive. goodbye nice day. miserable little loser are. 

Go choke words somewhere else. It‚Äôs almost like protest got lot people sick Sweden reported data last days? involve? Drugs prostitution? 

Harboring nazis?

All need glance shanty towns know country shit hole Unfortunately rally thousands wearing masks social distancing. American, yeah good luck getting thick, politically motivated skulls. pandemic suddenly shift this, half world can't even stay indoor wear masks without tearing country half?

What mask usage population scientific research vaccine?

You want know one different?

Well, one, third one. two, much contagious life-impacting. mean? $$$ involved cure. profit standpoint government funding. I'm guessing here, really think put funding SARS MERS COVID research? meant reasonable 0 cases, he‚Äôd enforce would announce it. Idiots Alameda, Marin, etc someone follow say ‚Äúsee? stupid.‚Äù friend Marin doesn‚Äôt care teens catch this. PNAS shit. Prestigious non reviewed. Membership based... fool who‚Äôs member NAS push hard enough get crap published there. Relaxation going weeks now.

4. Subunit spike protein vaccine

5. mRNA vaccine (this one two candidates) diabetic obese (from photo), call poor kid ""healthy"". There‚Äôs less people available covid kill now.

Any positive storm guess. percent positive actually went slightly encouraging. 11.89 still high. pointed someone made stupid NJ joke, might corona thread, got downvoted. People don‚Äôt like facts lol. nitpick vastly different histories actually quite interconnected. Yes win war, wars lol.

I feel lot connection german british french ""recent"" massacre fests, italian spanish old one, basically rest various skirmishes.

I hope Sweden changes course next election. elections become moot ineffective. India‚Äôs text positivity rates never went 10% except couple districts there.... testing high dw find data internet... saying worst hit city India... common, news. news incredibly rare. take extreme cases highlight they're newsworthy. 

Do think see article titled ""Recovered COVID-19 patient completely healthy fighting virus two weeks""? No, 99.99% cases, people able beat virus without lasting symptoms. That's quite newsworthy, it? perfect!! amazing virus. infect people, bats, pangolins, salmon, too. liked pun Why? guy projecting voice mic talking them? Get real! Life goes on! /s Well think many fun. wages quite low afaik. ones eating meat ones causing circumstances, necessarily workers. Scary counting. find funny people would claim death numbers inflated faked. fact deflated basically. people explain extra 4k ""pneumonia"" deaths higher usual annual numbers. becasue owner responsible humane persons. Doctors, hospitals, medical/industrial complex money. one would work medicine pay high act responsibly jeopardizes income.  small genetic variations virus, don‚Äôt think researchers found strains cause worse symptoms.

There evidence ‚Äúinitial viral load‚Äù matters.

Plenty morons NYC Lmao ahh look who's back yeah nice try yet make look like complete idiot.so let school yet dumbass

In light new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings public settings social distancing measures difficult maintain (e.g., grocery stores pharmacies) especially areas significant community-based transmission.

Cloth face coverings additional step help slow spread COVID-19 combined with¬†every day preventive actions¬†and¬†social distancingin public settings.


Use Face Covering Protect Others

Wear face covering help protect others case you‚Äôre infected don‚Äôt symptoms

Keep covering face entire time you‚Äôre public

So kindly suck dick..you want education I'll day dumbass knew functioning societies good public health?

But ya better stay shut disease goes away. better us sure... cancer simply would trust anyone clinic make sound decisions, financial stakes drive decision making. .

It‚Äôs fucking miracle. Psst indoors disease, chance transmission lowers 99% outside. Hello CCP bot down-vote comment nice day spreads respiratory droplets people talk cough, know that. 

Yes young people generally risk dying, read /r/covid19positive anecdotes many people suffering post-viral syndrome due ""mild"" infection. Furthermore, asymptomatic people spread others might vulnerable.

Kinda worrying, especially since there's reports, heard anything would fill reason. Despite that, keep hearing people getting sick, friends friends, acquaintances, etc. Could nothing, like it. Especially considering many people I've seen simply caring all, wearing masks. absolutely fine?

 Yes. Amen that. number cases literally nothing testing. all. Testing spread virus, cure someone. adds 1 list CONFIRMED cases. 
It's like saying check pack eggs cracked ones buy cracked eggs. That's things work pride then. national parks amazing that's it. Thing this, mask mandatory anyone wearing pay fines sad thing make people wear them.

Them lifting quarantine government hoped people understood danger virus hoped use common sense, like wear masks public, stores ect. clearly dint work.

And thing data good everyone wore mask, happen majority think good go without masks? Since virus still deadly infectious. 

It's like cursed circle, wear mask = data good, mask = back step 1. Yeah close 4500 new cases today. contact tracing, anyone know got it? America utterly failed nobody seems care. Businesses already planning 2nd lock fall/winter Europe elect anti science, anti intellectual morons call COVID Chinese hoax America People US need wear masks.

But.. Freedumb!  Ahahah, shit excuses. say that... know single person covid... loading me. link something Facebook that? else started around time? People opening businesses? talking protests people protesting quarantine? can't keep track protests spreading supposedly aren't. Also 2 weeks would bit odd since average incubation time 5-6 days so, theoretically, protests, positives spike one week after. Also, can't discount difference indoors outdoor gatherings. important times like remember corelation equal causation. Again, speak data state and, I'm seeing, people getting sick contacts outdoor gatherings. entire world needs come together collectively shun US ban anyone travelling there. Keep away us. wouldn‚Äôt correlate biggest protests, would correlate whichever cities highest prevalence virus time protests started. means we‚Äôll probably never really clear idea much protests contributed spread versus much reopening carelessly.

Thank check amazon. God, hate pedants. Yeah, I'm willing die hill enforcing guidelines many businesses cusp collapse, WANT anything help them, also think responsibility sacrifice public safety equally important. seems though risk minimal enough allow current activity. Hmm, similar problems Canada. bet way cut costs save money labor, especially given much money city already losing shutdown Yeah, think right timeline.

I remember exact timeline, stat remember 80% people symptoms show within 5 days. 5 days, take another 12 days symptoms worsen. - person ends ventilator ventilator weeks dying, sure, idea lots people cases mild need hospitalization wait 6 days hospitalized true. disease progress like (in cases).

Maybe there's something said ramp up, really think cases translate deaths, happen soon.

Florida, example, reporting 4000 cases day. 2 weeks NY first reported 4000 cases day, 700 deaths day.

Is anybody willing bet Florida 700 deaths day 2 weeks?

Honest question. bet anybody wants action Florida report 2000 deaths week July 6. going happen, happen soon. Everyone knows that, one put money mouth is. Right US trying change that. lot first world countries are. Redfield doubt spending 24 hours day reading Bible determine Gods laws broken bring coronavirus us. fact Vietnam Thailand beaten coronavirus Christian nations must really complicating things CDC. Yeah. Time Time find proud country handles itself. Dear Florida, ‚Äúhope‚Äù strategy. I'm southern state recent uptick younger cases free testing anyone (even asymptomatic) wants test since middle April. 

We seeing increase positive cases younger population. increase hospitalizations age group well. Ireland managed get covid control without masks. They're mandatory people wear them.  Biggest bunch morons planet ever seen. hope international travel starting it‚Äôs places common sense US get shit together. It‚Äôs huge danger countries.  wind sprints point Arizona reported one additional death today, Florida reported 17. seems fishy me. Ya don‚Äôt say Learn correct, least, make ""facts"". I'd rather pedantic verifiably ignorant. think storm beginning... filthy flat rough ride Herd immunity works? Sweden NL well. won‚Äôt everyone says scared stay home need live life NY? see 90% compliance doors. nose mouth. 5% mouth 5% either. Please, keep going. Sorry, provide evidence vast majority experts agreeing pandemic started wet markets, I'm engaging.

The CDC website explicitly says source unknown. someone spent miserable work week paper mask well work-provided mask large anyone, thankful co-worker made really nice (and dare say stylish?) cloth mask. Well, probably helps, cultural aspects like trust institutions rarely living together three generations, like difference Swedes Danes personal space massive. difference different policies. saying social distancing policies work country, think would, can't prove it. Check CDC reports, matches common flu death rate No, police. Again, police meet quota citations arrests every day. screws communities more. believe research. Citations arrests often times lead lose jobs, debtor's prison, evictions forth. It‚Äôs popular, least major cities US. much change consumer decides either pay ""quality"" meat buy meat all.

But hey long supermarkets advertise steak 0,99$/‚Ç¨, working conditions change? look like CDC stats me, still believing china 50 people infected total huh? Lots Americans admire country, might unique generally seems like well run place. Black people definitely racist. Anyone racist think people different race bad. Thinking someone can't something (even racist) bc color skin racist plain stupid thing swedish american way manage produce relevant amount immunity rather high death toll. Even would possible would likely happen late. 2nd wave happens happens fall winter. current rate least sweden something somehow resembling herd immunity next summer. 

And reacting early enough prevent wave. look curve Germany 2-3 weeks warning compared France, Spain Italy (and 2 weeks less US). amounts icu beds used never went 10%. Even considering 3-4 times beds countries still enough buffer. finally realised telling people masks protect you, others, backfired spectacularly, lot people give shit others.

Now try fix messaging finally telling truth, masks protect other, credibility pieces, third advice change regarding masks. Thanks no, literally clarifying facts OP specifically asked info support either side. Unlike politicians I'm receptive new fact based information might even cause change thoughts something. Vienna quiet winter. rest year full tourists.

I would visit Vienna summer though, might get bit hot humid full Asians. Go Carinthia visit Vienna spring/autumn. tell based positivity rate (the percentage tests coming back positive). Let's say city 1,000 tests day 5% tests coming back positive. start 1,200 tests day. would expect positivity rate decrease slightly increase testing, least hold steady. let's say 1,200 tests day see positivity rate 6% vs 5% saw before. would know increase cases related increase testing, higher percentage population starting get sick spread virus more.

This post good analysis positivity rate increased faster testing rate number states give good numbers ponder - instinctively felt stupid. cognizant since then. God, hate pedants.

Stop ruining high. nice day, learn grating. observation, people see wearing masks, women. Sadly seems 'macho culture' play comes guys, though doubt there's plenty women want wear 'because makeup'.

Sounds like net benefit me, think money they'll save lipstick lips hidden behind mask! Sadly, enforce mask wearing without putting employees risk. frustrated HEB realized tough spot. Without state city governments backing them, open door staff assaulted folks protesting masks. grocery store without membership makes even harder enforce. ya go. People already made mind, there‚Äôs changing it. Let‚Äôs forget Taiwan. would thought getting? Fall comedy good, even countries best responses can‚Äôt contain love wearing mask meme taken off- Denmark practically one wears mask ""supressed"" virus. live Austria. becoming careless bigly. keep seeing this. given what? thing trying prevent complete overwhelming hospitals. means quickly set field hospitals need areas large outbreak, PPE, better treatment plans, way ventilators could ever possibly need. everyone panicking? never stopping virus; slowing down. We're better getting cases summer winter flu season hits anyway. COVID-19 still spread ok summer, we'll get cases way sooner later. caused single cluster meat factory. Hundreds migrant workers, housed large groups small living quarters, separated outside world, hard physical labor close proximity one another cold indoor spaces. factory owner abide rules demands public services, seems. Police closed factory, military involved well. call people indoors. always polite manner. time comply. started lockdown earlier also started wearing masks earlier, no? Germany made masks mandatory like month ago. way seatbelts helpful essential reducing auto fatalities. COVID present months suspected long safety measures made, doesn‚Äôt mean virus either far less contagious suspected far less deadly? Genuine question.  stupid thay yeah, think lot people don‚Äôt realize disposable masks (and preferably cloth masks too, that‚Äôs harder) need changed get damp. also lot protests riots. BLM whatever ‚Äòbecause‚Äô seems. Yesterday Stuttgart random riots youth today Netherlands protests again. Let‚Äôs see goes combined less restrictions Maybe forgot, could sworn misspelled liar tempted mock previously. I'm mobile effort look far great.

What experts disagree exactly? originated wet market? cdc say first cases linked wet market epicenter place became pandemic? 50% european US visitors 43.5% visitors. never vaccine never leaving upstate Vermont. Sounds like exciting life. No, Europeans didn‚Äôt become careless. states like TX FL maybe reverted back worst situations close (factoring positivity rates, deaths, hospitalization, new cases). Arizona, though, clearly much worse point. Just, never made part official guidelines. early days, explicitly told *not* to, shortage. true. posted Facebook something importance wearing masks, excuses people gave wearing them:

1. Someone WORKS TECH ER saying anything sick (ok...?), anything unless prolonged exposure, even require little kids ER (Look, realize small children supposed wear realize needed put multiple asterisks post exceptions mask wearing)
2. Someone said forgot sometimes washed billionth time (excuse, I've forgotten mine went back get going somewhere) also sympathizes people wearing work wear one day disgusting breathe air day causes inflamed lymph nodes, etc. say, know sucks wear since know help people, whatever try help. discomfort temporary us.
3. judge people wearing masks might PTSD trigger surrounding masks. (I'm pretty sure average non-mask wearing person gaggle non-masked kids Target specific PTSD trigger masks. could, sure, average person doesn't. tell I'm judging I'm including random, tiny sliver population post mask wearing).
4. agreed whatever help refuses wear mask refuses force kids wear one, linked multiple non COVID-19 related studies mask wearing leading hypoxia. person also anti-vaxxer surprised.

People bringing rare cases excuses someone wear mask try poke holes message people wear masks consideration others. told one think needed multiple asterisks every post detailing possible exception mask wearing. many excuses, enough admitting general population needs wear masks even though comfortable. Trump good idea. Stop testing. took 30+ years PSAs regulations get people wear seatbelts US - 90% compliance now. I‚Äôm overestimating stupidity. Connecticut also done great job  Easier keep masks car. It‚Äôs like reusable shopping bags, keep car you‚Äôre stuck without one. do. Normal worry spreading contacting deadly highly contagious airborne virus time go eat, get haircut, go gym, go movies, etc. I‚Äôll choose engage protective measures whether they‚Äôre mandated not. R sensitive cases low - know cluster get control issue nationally. fact track contained, meaning death rates falling quickly means nothing? Let's see deaths month. Bet Michigan.

And whole point post Michigan New York track contained talked about? ""Essentially infers"" ""claims"" thing. Sorry, wrong things here. point continuing discussion. Enjoy rest day. keep saying vast majority ""claim x"" citing nothing agrees that.

""Those""? one case cited here. clearly lying again. This, one cares amount pain chronic illness/pain sufferers unless it‚Äôs cancer.  large parks nature preserves me, never run anyone, least anyone safely distant. take mask/bandana stuff me, case. considered getting antibody test find out? political stuff

How OP political? idiot leader never fully accepted fighting appropriate response. almost like it‚Äôs designed like that... understand open ended question part. understand draw conclusions re: impact protests spread virus fact asking closed question it? people attended protests decide include information interview contract tracer information accurate complete. Right? Chy-nah. got arrested trespassing? Makes sense. COCK needs BREATHE!! Correlation equal causation though. would love see actual study done. One reason think Europe, a/c less common. Maybe Europeans spend less time indoors warm? dangerous suggest masks important without evidence rules factors pay $500 month premiums $400 deductible plan covers spouse. chronic health issues reasonable deal. employer pays $1000 month (their portion premiums). leave use cobra would $1500 month, would suck.

My experience system excellent, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm lucky, know others less good insurance gotten screwed. people inherent understanding pandemics natural catastrophe, therefore cannot blame virus itself. Instead could try blaming someone intentionally spreading it, people readily accept somehow feels safer know someone wants harm, instead nature throwing fastballs random (maybe people predictable killable something). thus tries blame China, dropped ball briefly early stages virus.

Plus saying knew virus would bad opens lot shit states inevitably fails contain virus. Gotta secure bag Regardless CDC says, half Americans ignore Oh I‚Äôm agreement there. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd use opportunity lower expected 6k showed actually spread around arena safe distancing nope. Let‚Äôs pack everyone closer President leave couple stragglers balcony. 

Thank God 17k didn‚Äôt show that...I still think it‚Äôs going super spreading event could‚Äôve much worse completely packed stadium doubt would happen. 2 really high risk acitivies restaurants/bars (inside) going religious services.

The federal state governments interest going 2 groups. restaurant groups hanging thread religious groups much voting power. outbreaks places large protests? see, spikes largely states reopened quickly lax restrictions like Florida, Arizona, Texas, California. CDC essentially useless point. threw bullshit .26 mortality rate number, offered clear guidance reopening society, always changing beliefs virus spreads Hydroxychloroquine like mixed genetic defect G6PD extremely deadly. G6PD common black Mediterranean people.

This common knowledge, conspiracy junk. 

Hydrocloroquine standard treatment COVID19 WITHOUT screening G6PD. medical malpractice. ""can"" lead inflammations pretty much organ. respiratory system entrance. Meh Europe gave testing weeks ago early opennings. US Trump dumb enought admit it. EU countries right keeping everything fine narrative. cannot really know truth unless huge organistation compile data like government. Check Spain's data even admit report sure truth. Italy keep testing bt keep testing Lombardy. Germany idk testing numbers capped 5,029,696 something while. France erase data enter make up. UK counts test given done admitted duplicates. yea EU much different people feel better without histeria EU certainly sure Economics much important shown German programs(They reopenned 8 May Earliest country so) tow weeks later puppets followed. Hey yall remember kept saying covid disproportionately affects blacks needed protect black much.... happened that? 

They want us get fucked lies.  Thank clear simple explanation! Anyone else read Glenmark think Denmark? much easier need fight racial equality  accurate tho. Sigh... bot needs work. Considering recent mass protests many people didn‚Äôt even bother masks surprising. Every single protestor governor allowed happen responsible surge. Terrible undid hard work like that. working hard identify source they've already found it?

Source animal, place infection occurred.  people infected wet market, makes sense slew reasons. denying it, better offer better answer explanation insufficient. know exact source current outbreak coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), know originally came animal source.

Yes, know specifically animal transmitted it, know came animal linked wet market. 

Why keen defend wet markets much? Hmmm? Toronto example, beaches looking like mardi gras weekend. past 7 days, lot people started give / give assume life normal, virus likes. mandatory masks public either.

Most Canada well outside Toronto Quebec right now. place ever inside since start March grocery store, misses reduced one us goes instead us. Mask gloves trip. Anything else delivery pickup, home time, yard though.

I frustrated depressed, admit it, accept long run, wish lot people could get quickly. ones making them.

I've single store really anywhere requires masks. yesterday festival park near house. Zero social distancing saw maybe 2 masks walked past.

Funniest thing bunch graffiti artists spray painting even wearing masks... I'm like dude.. covid no, shit bad lungs lol Oh visiting while. Borders going closed americans while.  people rally probably went local establishments drink food, probably stayed hotels night. That's lot points possible contact possible covid positive people rallygoers.

I'm sure we'll able separate number got sick local establishments number got sick rally. Hell, got sick locally could brought rally. 70% show fever Also lots animal fluids sloshing around floors, production line, workers' aprons, etc. Lots fluid virus live on. .24% CFR, humanity survive? Well, copenhagers went Sweden Denmark opened up. Let's see leads couple weeks. tiring trying pride country.

Tell it.

About thing think left, American, proud - NASA, Space-X .  Used work journal publishing - rare. Even authors wanted retract, publishers hate anything avoid it. Corrections, hand, abundance. Excellent! US instead? chance widespread mask use slightly lower hitting megamillions. Starting think CV actually magically disappear Excuse you‚Äôre interrupting anti-U.S. narrative, please stop wrongthink right  mean, think comparison care home prison incomplete here. possibly 92 year old advanced dementia pushed resident later died injuries? Beyond moving secure unit? really think everything said somehow erased? means likely lot infected people rally. test much transmits stadium people wearing masks. Truth know long term consequences around long enough yet, there's definitely plenty evidence suggest could scary anecdote exactly contradict saying two weeks right? Lol dumb. wrong two weeks ago, time different? Half kids every day fixed many problems like buses lunch. One kid per bus seat empty eat next lunch class. see students twice per week get everyone caught via elearning Friday. 

I fear rural conservative area many stupid things won‚Äôt even require masks staff. 

And don‚Äôt get started sports. It‚Äôs impossible safely K-12. pros even chance. Guess salad greens shall buying then?

Can genuinely ask, much pay health insurance premium? distancing people believe focus social distancing focus masks makes difference virus spreading Europe US.

Winter coming. People live glass houses shouldn‚Äôt throw stones. policies relaxed Europe US, Europeans seem better understanding key avoid super-spreader events. 

The problem isn‚Äôt much sitting outside dinner - it‚Äôs meeting 3,000 best friends Trump rally in. 

I‚Äôve seen comments people Florida say infections aren‚Äôt bad people don‚Äôt get sick - fully correlating change lifestyle (being outside) summer persistence concentrations airborne pathogens (which less open air well ventilated environments).

Watch happens rate infections doesn‚Äôt drop continued ‚Äúbad behavior‚Äù people - consider effect everyone moving indoors - refuse wear masks (and therefore freely infecting others).

What people don‚Äôt seem get yet it‚Äôs aerosols much breath extended period time. *""Here's bad part: testing extent, going find people, going find cases. said people, slow testing please.""* 

If listen slow testing down, fix problem /s want government drowned bathtub world run unelected billionaires. brag you, states seeing rise cases recently many states record breaking new numbers cases. Arizona already 82% capacity hospital beds. Cities Texas seeing hospitals start hitting capacity.

Things getting worse, paying attention? Yeah late mask wearing, today wear cos forgot, I'm going serious wear every time go out. weird cos since loosened restrictions go walmart like 99% people wearing masks anymore :/ Athens, Greece??? study speculated access healthcare denser areas made increased risk density itself. Likewise Australia +100 average 100 cases one day since early April. checkpoints counties US. move counties without even realizing it. Lots towns border counties, know someone whose house half one county half another. move states without even realizing it, - plenty towns/cities straddle state border (example: Bristol, VA Bristol, TN city straddling state borders). Though usually there's sign like ""Welcome Virginia"" that's marketing enforcement... there's stops checkpoints all. 

The checkpoints I've *ever* seen going California, agricultural checkpoints check people bringing pests banned invasive plants. interstates major highways, still huge webs back roads going state unmonitored. 

The sheer *area* needing patrolled enforce lockdown degree insane. States set secure border all. Hell, even areas actual *international* border Canada hard get through. southern border Mexico secured mostly geography (lots inhospitable desert), yet hundreds thousands people manage get past one even actively enforced... 

I agree much uniform response locking nonessential travel. people way better response voluntarily fuckin' morons, actual root problem. 

But severely underestimating sheer area roads would need patrolled enforce thing, even discussion states may constitutional power close borders. Though legal analyses read (I'm lawyer interested question) concluded would legal long temporary/limited declared state emergency. memory serves correct ingesting twice-the-normal dose vitamin already negative effect, unless body utterly unable synthesize (could easily happen chemotherapy patients). dose would still measured micro-grams. grams kilograms.

This happens time, happens jails too. could've told yall that.. Yes. prefer lemmings. assumption making setting policy, going policy practicable. left qualified said *if young healthy* still go cruises. given cruises barred US policy, advocating young/healthy people do, trying reiterate risk anybody young/healthy people taking them.

Fauci undoubtedly without fault, attempts spin blame towards based isolated statements public, without context admin dealing with, rather suspect. would certainly love see release internal communications deliberations assess admin lobbying one way other. Good. wish well hope helps flatten shit. Well, good hear taken serious there! N95 mask help allergies? Okay think confusing people bit I'm saying. I'm saying, ask closed ended questions, rather ask open ended ones. So, example, I'd say ""tell everywhere since June 12th"" example. ask closed question like ""have protest since June 12th"" time every possible place they've non productive and, line work, trained closed ended questions lead false answers people shutting down. asked ""have protest since June 12th"" I'd ask church, grocery stores, day cares, etc. So, keep track they've been, actively ask specific type location, possibilities endless we'd never finish interview, even gave us honest answers. Ah ok. general markets know Wuhan's different. Still outside enough prevent spread obviously. People done lockdowns. thinking problem states willing bet that‚Äôll worldwide issue, I‚Äôd expect resistance places like Spain Italy example saw spike tried close places down. 

I might wrong wasn‚Äôt studies showing you‚Äôve pretty much got 2 months actually lockdown people start saying ‚Äúscrew this, I‚Äôm it‚Äù? countries already used 2 month period lol  fact still think, data come out, compare flue, elderly immune says all. Literally one immune deadlier complications flu. extraordinary measures taken suppress spread many many would died already. Many died still sick months infection. way early celebrate.

I'd rather stay another year means that. camp Desantis would never rollback openings, cases keep spiking projections remotely accurate, hand eventually forced. 

Hope Florida's strategy thus far. sound plan. California states implementing ""mask requirements"". even called requirement punishment wearing one? relevant Disney planning imminently open theme parks large crowds people middle pandemic. targeting open July 11. Florida's COVID cases spiking rapidly. unsafe situation unfair expect workers bear brunt exposure large crowds risk deadly disease known cure. article silly. mostly: ""let's compare apples oranges!"" bottom apples apples comparison fresh set forecasts Danske Bank Tuesday shows economy Sweden faring worse Norway Denmark. Swedish GDP set shrink 4.1% year, compared 3.5% contraction Denmark Norway, according Danske.**

Hm, aaaaalmost like Swedish strategy huge failure economically compared countries makes sense compare Sweden to: Nordic neighbors. 

Here's [a linkdump demonstrates that, compared neighbors, Sweden badly worse many important economic metrics GDP forecasts, unemployment, consumer confidence, bankruptcies, etc.

Also [thread another sub Reddit contains quite good discussion dishonest compare Sweden countries bulk article compares to](http://archive.vn/xs87o). mean, really, where's line here? next going comparing Sweden Ukraine something saying huge success Sweden better country clearly comparable much worse starting position? saying even without social distancing, Japan things better West social distancing.

Sounds like masks even better then. yes. somewhat right, US, NATO EU certainly benefit existence countries. childless young person one day need go nursing care dotage... find/pick home shit like this? Bedroom community? Well helped medical industry get (more?) flooded, going us... nice... Stop spreading propaganda. Normal masks reduce risk getting infected. effective n95s p99s, they're better nothing. Best luck you. Oregon spikes exactly two weeks protests, still going on. Could stop selective fuel agenda, focus facts? large gathering increase cases regardless reasons. Gotcha. Looking forward watching tick back top graph next week. Really though, absolutely horrifying. 

I remember mid April watching graphs hotspot countries started trending right direction thinking we‚Äôre definitely lagging behind started taking measures way later counties, maybe month we‚Äôll start getting results like that. absolutely shameful. Fucking hell, planning are? stupid waste friday. Young elementary kids could use extra day, need person time. !Remind 30 days Yet they're going whatnot? seems like family gonna fun they're thing never going see them. go fucking rejuvenation clinic Friday get blood test

Rejuvenation clinic? Arizona Sci fi now? Don‚Äôt workers food plants wear full PPE basically ? I‚Äôve walked couple food buildings looking warehouse . Everyone covers clothes , gloves , masks , hair nets .

That‚Äôs don‚Äôt get exactly like climate change, that's one reason right sensitive masks. can't let base get habit listening scientific experts, they? backwards. live one effected counties CA policies enforcing mask literally days ago. opening gyms making illegal go store mask. Sooooooo, it? Like, 2nd quarter, 10 minutes clock? exactly fine USA ""mask requirement"" states? even called mask requirement there's punishment non-compliance? Lead Desantis!!!!! got this!!!! going sound terrible, running African American 2018. election close, rural areas Florida would voted Stalin African American candidate. reddit celebrated promoted getting affects one... except generation addicted numerically-delivered dopamine hits. Chinese response 50 initial cases massive, found 220-odd cases. bad, better letting virus grow unchecked. every expectation China get back control.

China authoritarian single-party state still requires cooperation people. work people cooperate, obviously do.

But correct Indians like Chinese. Indians poorer, less educated, far worse infrastructure, cannot larger things China does. example, could India test 10 million 10 days? Could India build 2 hospitals 2 weeks? Probably not. 

Indians less communal; individualistic, like Americans. seem less willing able follow rules purpose help someone else, rather themselves. appears dominant thing determines whether country stops virus. house divided cannot stand. here. shit gets worse, I'll move better country can. LONG way go we‚Äôd close herd immunity. probably won‚Äôt kick vaccine produced. Masks partisan issue, wear protect others. US great professionals. people care anyone else actually make fun do? nuts. think simple measures protect people beyond folk. Stay safe :) lot people protesting days. going save lives. Ye need listen Cardi B often Stonks go also mysterious deaths nursing homes DC responsible pathogen ever identified around time. hope able find answers soon! yet, Netherlands hand wear masks (only mandatory public transport) fine suppressing virus. answer keeping distance staying home symptoms, asks discipline. Frankly, Americans concerned FrEeDuMbS keep messing shit up. percentage people 18-20 demo? Preparing, that‚Äôs rich Hm. going ask coworkers this. 
I work nanoscale research laboratory part Germany, kids sister reattend next week first time, 2 days week iirc. Yes, Lack PPE!!! You‚Äôd surprised 100% this. I'm UK pisses government seem slip radar we've arguably worst response situation. leadership seems actively incompetent never seem face anything occasional disapproving look (what's word person reports news? newsician? I'm going newsician) newsician USA lead world fighting COVID19 showing could happened. think ""reopen now! "" protest Canada went away seeing US handled re-opening. don‚Äôt understand getting at. say US nothing change. We‚Äôre opening regardless. 

I think people feel safe go catch virus economy would lot better. 

But really doesn‚Äôt matter think. We‚Äôll know answer soon enough.

I faith vaccine provide longer immunity given multiple doses. probably think, "" hurt take minute. I'll put back on."" government want people buying surgical masks concerned shortages healthcare workers. advised people wear masks, many would bought medical grade masks assumed good. Therefore, government originally said masks help.

Now official advice changed told wear masks confined public areas. lmao, paid beverage companies billions trash. glad got $50 calls cocacola expiring august. see future coronavirus vaccine like flu vaccine - intended prevent getting COVID, aimed helping immune system beat smaller proportion population infected requires actual hospitalization. 

Even bad flu vaccines help immune response enough beat flu without complications. Lettuce forget them. E - b. saw one replies clarifying meant!

I know mean, we're basically hub country. lot connecting flights go us. Plus, we're pretty popular destination general tourism immigration, mention like jet countries lot, too. Another thing remember really detached. (were?) regular ferries France, Belgium, Netherlands etc. even though island, 2020 we're connected. 

But, 1 case million cases, country in, matter time spreads bascially. Jurassic Park: Covid-Rex

If felt unrealistic rich would reopen park knowing chance would cause mass death, wrong. browse top week every while. Also take joke hard lol Agreed ‚Äì really like Hamburg Bremen ‚Äì course Berlin (otherwise live here)! football teams, say, husband-to-be Werder fan mentally preparing impending tragedy. lots lateral flow immunoassays (they ""paper strip test"", like pregnancy tests) covid, shit. Really high false positives. get complete compliance. Good them! Djokovic, Thiem, Zverev &amp; Dimitrov partying together. yikes. Covid: naturalized citizen USA now. Teehee community spread COVID-19 France late December, virus even identified China. simple way determine whether COVID-19 involved, test relevant tissue virus. community spread COVID-19 France late December, virus even identified China. simple way determine whether COVID-19 involved, test relevant tissue virus. active obfuscation campaign done local officials want take blame. downplayed danger virus critical early spread. 

5 days lot observe virus acts like 2003 SARS virus. else supposed say? Pretty tenuous. EU little say healthcare. That's reserved national governments. EU coordinate bulk buying schemes (like ventilators stuff) throw money companies collapse that's pretty much it. Lockdowns like control national subnational governments country living mandated masks also gave free public transit think right 1600s. Fact UK gigantic hub passangers (I think Heathrow biggest passanger airport headcount) gets weirdly high number tourists. visit London always takes remember 90% people listen speaking language I've never heard of. island makes difference. You‚Äôll see problem pop-up party you‚Äôve seen pictures:  
  
It massive. bad news nothing news single vaccine failed stage 3. nowhere close anything usable heard? lOcAl iSsUe! country living mandated masks also gave free public transit It‚Äôs sad you‚Äôre right Trump delivered expected. failed tremendously :) beer... Source: live outside Philly, everyone knows beer garden is. say U.S. can't afford it? trillion spent social programs like spending happening lmfao Far people US wear masks Europe.

NOBODY wears mask Europe. done well Montana closing shop early. Phase 2 reopening plan second highest increase positives since early days pandemic.

Going getting groceries (curb side pickup), saw 1 group people approximately 100 people masks on. Watched people leaving store entire families, even small children grandma, one 12 pack Coca Cola. entire family go get 12 pack Coke? Watched many people touching face smoking right leaving store. complacent lockdown first stopped. alarmingly complacent.

What do? Vietnam smart people charge stop recovery virus. Along population willing cooperate get sick die. US things. I'm truly appalled poorly US done. US death figures faked. Many states hide coronavirus deaths pneumonia deaths. Everyone wears masks city cases haven‚Äôt dramatically dropped. factors play ? No, i'm simply confusing facts feelings like silly children do.

Why increases States huge protests?

""Alabama, Oregon South Carolina among states biggest increases. Alabama saw 92 percent change seven-day average, Oregon‚Äôs seven-day average 83.8 percent South Carolina‚Äôs 60.3 percent. Hospitalizations risen well. example, Arkansas seen 120.7 percent increase hospitalizations, 92 cases 203, since Memorial Day.""  remember 2 months ago everyone said would never like Italy. want like Italy. Right couple million bucks buy literal castle US. London would pretty nice flat city. money goes much here. That, according RIVM, official death toll currently 6,090 may understated 30-40% people previously tested included reported figures. lot deaths , especially elderly homes, recorded peak times March April. recently, RIVM said it‚Äôs like 30% - see [link countries, like Belgium Sweden, also count cases weren‚Äôt previously tested. done anything combat virus. It‚Äôs become prisoner‚Äôs dilemma. everyone cooperated it‚Äôd best, part others don‚Äôt get worst (disease still hella rampant, you‚Äôre stuck home forever), nobody cooperates disease gets hand. 

Idk solution is, damn, I‚Äôm getting hella bored living alone nothing months end.  Excelsior! Oh yeah fines then. right

How get Americans wear masks? Yea? percentage? virus around long enough determine people permanent symptoms. Texas hit record high hospitalizations 12 last 13 days. Can‚Äôt second wave don‚Äôt test.

*taps forehead she? Better careful wording things sure love food meatpacking plants! Like every single vaccine trail far fail stage 3. vaccine. hope. subreddit huge fucking echo chamber Europe good, US bad. 99% chance die virus. Fucking relax. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm wondering. I‚Äôm pregnant people mean well giving advice like ‚ÄúGet lots bagged salads it‚Äôs easy vegetables baby born.‚Äù Well, there‚Äôs way really clean Covid salad. can‚Äôt microwave bleach anything. Unfortunately one really cares people... want kids hair miss things. Jeez man mean died it, mean virus. possibility certainty died virus. It‚Äôs person call something ‚Äúrecord jump‚Äù go +0 +4 cases. peaked, havent. U wait..... Instead ""flatten curve"" ""lower curve""? graph shown website Reddit ""new cases"", ""current cases"". 4k people still getting infected every day Europe way see it. term, ""flatten curve"", first coming vogue, great amount misgivings. Now, feel increasing distain it.

People ran basic calculations, based ICU bed limit, figured curve would flattened *years* order COVID-19 infect enough population stop. assuming immunity long-lasting, constantly questioned. People ran calculations term coined, wrote articles it.

Then, practice, patchwork severe lockdown measures implemented, none sustainable. Now, end sustainability, re-opening can't politically practically rolled back cases. social safety net U.S. sufficient. people paycheck-to-paycheck, evicting major fraction total population cartoonish prospect.

The better term would use obvious reference South Korea (which many times replicated since early phases), work beat it. focus, itself, wrong. don‚Äôt care trump estimated. 

The fact experts estimated 100,000 2 million deaths. 120,000 deaths now. might get 200,000. 

That‚Äôs still extremely good result excerpt

The Hadassah team studied 700 blood samples 80 patients admitted medical center first peak coronavirus outbreak Israel. results show alpha defensin speeds blood clot formation, cause pulmonary embolism, heart attacks stroke. addition, blood clots form alveoli, whose function exchange oxygen carbon dioxide molecules bloodstream, lead respiratory distress eventually intubation. Jesus Christ people. one saying protests contribute. least see people wearing masks staying outside. I‚Äôm taking bets US death toll November. takers? Much likely children perhaps still likely.

The people actually likely die 80s even group majority survive. would love to! Anywhere mountains glaciers everyone bicycles there. hate driving cars lasts 15 years. It‚Äôs also one highest well being/satisfaction. 
Finland, Sweden, Norway. Goals. Apologies need learn countries though. I‚Äôm uneducated swine.  reason lies blatantly seemingly without regard appearance outward image outside Sweden matter. Literally nobody outside keep power matters, rest party synonymous corruption, hunger power narrowmindedness.

And yet Sweden can't get rid party keep weaseling way back power like cancer can't cure. like every American hope never lose job! going hard claim see anyone careless, careless yourself. Following rules mean careless, conflate two. People NYC wanted escape lockdown went Florida.

People LA wanted escape lockdown went ?  Sure count Mexican immigrants, picture suffering, illegal labor. looking them, also look nationalities paint opposite picture welath, education opportunity. still suggests immigrants choose line education, particularly stem medical fields, tend high degree upwards mobility, compared immigrants typically less qualified. 

I believe US, capable studying hard you‚Äôre young get good degree, least bachelors, pretty well regardless race. Generally read pretty safe. symptoms + masks + distance + outside ideal mix conditions. high risk maybe consider well. already 2 weeks since mass protests started. huge spike that. think supports hypothesis outdoor transmission difficult. Hello Toronto, I'm dad. feels like one understands,‚Äù said Chloe Kaplan Washington, D.C., works education day 78. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people aware middle ground, knocks feet weeks, neither die mild notion cases mild brief bolsters belief sick elderly need isolate themselves, everyone else get infected done it. ‚ÄúIt establishes framework ‚Äònot hiding‚Äô disease looks manageable sensible undertaking,‚Äù writes Felicity Callard, geographer University Glasgow, day 77. pandemic discourse turns talk second wave, long-haulers still grappling consequences first wave frustrated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve concerned friends family aren‚Äôt taking seriously think you‚Äôre either asymptomatic dead,‚Äù said Hannah Davis, artist New York City, day 71. ‚ÄúThis middle ground hellish.‚Äù

There reports damage/strain COVID-19.

Thus importance social distance wearing face mask. US hospitals waive cost you‚Äôre uninsured unable pay emergencies. idea healthcare expensive comes hospitals upcharging insurance companies cover losses. It‚Äôs weird convoluted system horror show Reddit makes be. ICU care extremely intensive survival chances old frail people horrible, even start healthy. remember though prioritization changed since even corona patient ventilator denied one.

So, really, following line thought. ECMO devices everyone survive even put ventilator? keep someone ""alive"" even though body deteriorating really long time! Unlimited paid sick days. I've got job can't remotely, stayed home 3 days last week got cold sore throat, mild Covid-19 symptoms. Covid-19, self-isolation would prevented spread.

Another one helpful Swedish Troll Brigade starts pretending 'herd immunity strategy' one posted article: supports position mostly, ALSO analysis boils ""Sweden pursing herd immunity calling since term unpopular"". I've saying *weeks* now. quite overjoyed happened look even dishonest usual pretend case since [a source one says lol. neutralizing vaccines thing? examples?

Wouldn't call treatments still catch vaccine? Deaths lag right? MD people seem taking seriously masks. numbers continue great. US great EU citizens wants make ton money, safety net home lots opportunities US Pretty important remember California like everywhere else flu cold season. Pretty usual office building pass around cough winter. NZ travel ban march 19 Iceland march 20. situation US. virus nontrivial numbers talk widespread travel ban. Momentarily disregarding content news report, Brit, anyone else tired hearing news-reporter‚Äôs opinion American news?

Gives us news, think it. 

American news way commercialised dramatised. pretty sure multiple cases thing states counting every negative test person tested completely different person time. people get tested repeatedly work like Yep, saw too! It‚Äôs like virus magically disappeared last weeks ‚Äúfree‚Äùagain. 
In last couple days increase new cases Germany. isn‚Äôt remind everyone social distancing wear mask correct way. 
Also don‚Äôt understand government anymore. numbers rising last days, isn‚Äôt medicine let‚Äôs open more. lockdown soon we‚Äôre understanding virus still active maybe time people understand wearing mask keep distance isn‚Äôt bad think is. I‚Äôm talking companies work home insisting people return crazy reason 

And others needlessly gathering hangouts People like need psychological help. even opposite political sides. opportunist else. risky way end pandemic sept oct, best believe support it. that's called well known number herd immunity kicks at. Try googling it. worse terms deaths new hospitalizations. yet Italy significantly higher death per capita guess doesn‚Äôt count amount people I've seen wearing Masks nose uncovered insane, bother wearing it.  gum issues already dentist since reopened another appointment tomorrow. hate go get nervous time, take seriously take extra precautions. I've heard outbreaks stemming dental offices. think question I'd ask is, problem going cause infection pain taken care promptly? answer yes, would say needs go sooner rather later. Dental problems get hand quickly. i‚Äôm uk. seeing triple figure deaths 4 digit cases normal now, pains me. that, yet successful mRNA vaccine deployed infectious disease. flu thousands Americans December every year. Covid to, most, handful. chances covid vanishingly small. Provide link.  about, course people meeting privately indeed okay. Germany Bundesl√§nder way careful big gatherings (apart BLM demos still many people wearing masks even though them)

extensively careless? sounds like youre hyperboling dont even know oh, no, no, no! dont need negativity pandemic related subreddit! gotta wholeheartedly support every treatment ""cure"" possibility come mouths overbought micro/small cap biotech companies, especially never released single novel(new, ya didnt get that) product almost infrastructure produce vast quantities demanded products. 

but hey mRNA vaccines look promising, considering there's DATA back effectiveness safety using mRNA vaccines, cause never used before. closest thing compare protien inhibitor/indentifier treatments used treating certain types breast cancer, used treat(not prevent) breast cancer beacause high tendency patients developing auto-immune disorders increased risks standard care treating patients solid tumor breast cancer presence proteins markers cause breast cancer. full text clinical trials, ranging chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, gene therapy, bottom utilize extensive genetic therapies, like mRNA vaccine mRNA/protein modifier, those
in dire need beacuse benefits outweigh side effects. case using mRNA vaccine general use, sounds almost absurd sink money something that, yep, might work, could potential side effects outweigh benefit. 

i get wanting find solution crisis quickly, shouldnt throw away standard practices, got get normal really fast.

and really ponder this: ethical clinical research company, release kind status trial trial's completion date? new information underlying effect efficiency medication, within trial better outlook outside trial? parameters used rate effectiveness medicine fair, fair rate patient ventilator ""2"" rate hospitalized patient without one ""3"", kind effect result have? That's tests, that's confirmed cases. normal, papery masks work, putting glasses bit eyes top mask keeps fog down. (Except cold areas like grocery store. glasses fog without mask too) government. retarded administration times responsible pandemic spread USA. Hell, claim superpower, yet still masks, cleaning supplies available us stores. maybe could start treating fellow americans equals would incentive protest. instead listening concerns people US choose way strife. one government. Covid might actually solved someday (vaccine). America really solve gun violence stops allowing 99% population handgun. Without getting rid 2md Amdt nothing change. state orders lockdown, state pay bills. lock down, pay bills. 

Guess one they‚Äôre going do. So? mean get US government incompetent, claiming ""things hard"" fucking weak.

Just say it: less competent Europeans, Taiwanese etc. number cases ar rising exponentially. Hey, dumb question. haven‚Äôt seen visited friends since March 3rd things state got crazy. started going back work May state reopened always mask wash hands.


My question I‚Äôm wearing mask friends wearing mask, would safe visit hangout awhile? would table spaced apart too. first concern alabamans living Alabama. strangely best anecdote I‚Äôve heard care home - saw problem, spoke family, figured solution, tried implement it. didn‚Äôt succeed give up, don‚Äôt like that, I‚Äôve heard aunt long term assisted care living.... still positive nursing home story I‚Äôve ever read.

Baker, Professor Public Health University Otago Wellington, said term ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù dated back 1918 influenza pandemic, three distinct waves parts world, second generally severe.  said likelihood second wave would vary depending strategies countries used.  example, came lockdown cautiously virus-free country, cases could start fresh outbreak,‚Äù Baker said.  countries Asia also containing virus similar way, \[we\] expect see many cases reduce lockdowns.‚Äù  contrast, US, several states coming lockdown experiencing large rises cases still lot virus circulating could start new chains transmission, Baker said.  lessons could learn first round tackling pandemic, Baker pointed importance face masks reducing transmission, well ‚Äúthe need testing high-performing contact tracing systems‚Äù.  important, according Baker, ‚Äúgood science, good leadership, responding rapidly pandemic. containment elimination approach developed Sars era also works Covid-19‚Äù.  one worst hit Sars, adopted stricter measures second phase dealing Covid-19, installing 24-hour security checkpoints local communities, closing schools advising people step social distancing.  said risk imported cases starting fresh outbreaks would remain main threat China, swift vigorous response would needed contain outbreak.  response\] highly likely successful, given China‚Äôs demonstrated experience control measures,‚Äù Baker noted.

Tokyo confirmed 41 new coronavirus infections Thursday, marking third time week capitallogged 40 cases day. brings total cases Tokyo 5,674.  Kazuhiro Tateda, president Japan Association Infectious Diseases (JAID) member committee set government combat spread virus, many recent cases Tokyo traced back city‚Äôs [nightlife  said even though clusters easier control linked traceable parts city, always risk localised outbreaks.  know lower risk transmission summer months, means chance second wave ‚Ä¶ October onwards,‚Äù Tateda added.  guard second wave, authorities drawn series guidelines nightlife industry encouraged abide by.  Yoko Tsukamoto, professor infection control Health Sciences University Hokkaido, said hard businesses follow rules staff needed close customers serve drinks light cigarettes.  realistic expect keep two metres apart, government stuck done shutting businesses down,‚Äù said.  said authorities might choice reimpose state emergency Tokyo cases rose 100 day.  Tateda confident happen, government, health care professionals Japanese public would better prepared react far swiftly.  gained lot experience do,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWe respond quickly effectively apply lessons learned.  government increased budget fight disease doctors nurses better prepared deal virus. ready second wave come.‚Äù  Zealand‚Äôs coronavirus-free streak ends two new imported cases  also looking well dozens new cases recorded past week, majority Victoria.  Wednesday, state recorded biggest single-day increase month 21 new cases, prompting Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews warn pandemic ‚Äúfar over‚Äù. Another 13 cases added Victoria‚Äôs total Friday, bringing total 1,792. Australia 7,409 cases overall.  second wave virus would look like, many experts uncertain. Oh yeah , old population main cluster Lombardy region I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre getting downvoted suggesting lying doctor symptoms. Seriously, comment needs removed. many factors Europe much better US thus far: 


1. Europeans generally thinner, much lower obesity rate US. Obesity proven major factor cases, complications, deaths
2. Europe much decentralized place US, consisting smaller countries took action much sooner US did, bumbling bureaucracy. early action made huge difference long run.
3. Masks may minor factor. many countries Europe enforce mask wearing, seem still much better US.

There factors I'm sure. think may overlooked. Keeping people quarantined tanking economy also cost terms lives, unfortunately. would ideal people could allowed resume somewhat normal could trusted wear masks socially distance, seems going well. Canadian poor, worry going bankruptcy medical procedure. can't say comment wrong, there's definitely degrees ""money necessary"". Yeah heat might kill directly since everyone hangs inside there's AC 100+ degrees pretty moot point. get sick. UK that's fully covered everyone. Deaths massively lagging indicator. take average 19 days someone COVID go infection death, processing time death certificates lengthy. People don‚Äôt die COVID end report next day. According Georgia dept. health process takes six weeks, averaging two weeks. I‚Äôm assuming similar lags states. Put two factors reported deaths lag infection times 5+ weeks. look deaths peaked lockdowns backs large lag time. I'd love see numbers people moving US EU vice versa. I'm sure still people moving US wonder ratio changing. made implied point easier get money US UK, actually. Read book. LabCorp offers antibody test $10 insurance billed. doctor's order needed, though. search see reliable test is. Exactly this.
Did groceries yesterday (France), 4/5 people stopped wearing masks. freaking irresponsible. Considering amount air travel moving country every single day, fact we're island much benefit people think.

But government currently receiving lot criticism closing access country sooner. simply false. 

The reproduction value Netherlands example live 1 quite time. Norway, Denmark Finland good examples believe.

Germany big local outbreak recently probably screws r value.  correct. Trump used give daily briefings it. want everyone accept fact life hopefully November, nobody care. Good hear dude.   supposed reach 1,300,000 cases may. almost July 400,000 cases. say lockdown worked ? yes yes yes. important shocks people complacent. think also exponential growth problem. Everything looks fine suddenly not. People understand exponentials all, even quite happily work mathematics abstract situations intuitive understanding something go nothing huge quickly. latest CDC estimate saw 0.2-0.4% mortality rate, couple times worse flu. that‚Äôs likely overestimate. blows mind Cheetotards California. looking bright side, votes absolutely meaningless compared state. Ybor City known anything, place catch virus. groups tens thousands people getting together crowd nothing spread? Sure. London rich non-English speakers tourists. many places outside London too. One death 

Cases meaningless prepare holding campaign rallies? Yeah. Maybe burns - like worse gets states - maybe makes NY look like pre-game show - something between. hard know right 'cause plan. actually know this. haircut protestors? sub's responsability? Uhh, excuse me. embraced virus. 

/s Imagine two weeks. Well mom Texas got it. worried NYC obviously things changed recent weeks. Going like running fire head back there. like saying along got lot shit saying. something blood causing people worse symptoms others mild symptoms all. one thinks rather take actions first wave still raging trough US rather prepare second wave that's propably still months (if much longer) away? luck another large group showing up. Scientists bummed though. us id say already forced back society. Staying home something us afford do. Unfortunately, us risk life, others, families lives order provide, stay home, starve way pay rent (which already struggle area) topic safe rich, there‚Äôs country executes billionaires China. idea is, become billionaire corrupt means, would‚Äôve scam steal *a lot* people, punishment proportional sheer number lives households exploited ruined.

Scam one person. Jail fine. Scam millions. Death penalty. things done. think weren't? Europe test much reduced cases dramatically Idk feels like copout. crazy time live in, someone walking around close others mask different someone walking around town brandishing deadly weapon. Sure might kill anyone, also might.

We manage enforce letting people endanger others lots scenarios, also enforced. Ticketing people crowded areas without mask would good place start would probably quite effective. Possibly, either way, curve flattened here, runaway like see several US states EU countries.

Our healthcare isnt strained all, fact easing allowing elective surgeries go ahead cruisey low number cases. all, avoided worst. ultimately, maintain manage low numbers enact stricter restrictions societal governmental backing support need be. tories know kills minorities suggest people wear concerned also colleges open up....a mess. worry, economy great! There‚Äôs one country whose economy looks set fare better others comes fallout Covid-19: Sweden.
    
""The others""? ""the others""? Oh, US, France, Italy UK. 
What coincidence compare similar countries like Denmark, Norway, Finland and, know rest Europe...   ""Meanwhile, fresh set forecasts Danske Bank Tuesday shows economy Sweden faring worse Norway Denmark. Swedish GDP set shrink 4.1% year, compared 3.5% contraction Denmark Norway, according Danske.""

Maybe coincidence all.       
Sweden's economy actually worst Denmark, Norway, Finland many *lockdown* countries journalist reason decided countries ""others"".        
The cool thing works context : ""Our economy much better others. Like Sierra Leone Syria.""    
     
Anyway, mean ""doing better""? hope worth sacrifice elder ""save economy"" put it. So, good is?      Even so, Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson last month told countrymen brace worst recession since World War II, GDP likely contract 7%.

That's call ""better"". worry weaker export-demand make economy suffer here,‚Äù Bloomberg economist Johanna Jeansson.

No sh... Sherlock. ""To help stem future outbreaks, diagnostic testing must widespread frequent. tests need rapid easy use field,"" reads bit like ad, I'd wait second source validate getting excited. reverse also true. People behaving like morons going life nothing happening avoid catching happen area virus currently present. virus different strains, already know current Type C strain DG614 mutation stiffens spike proteins make far infectious, strain earlier int outbreak lower R0 mean now.

What say sure virus without DG614 less infectious, means Type B outbreak China original Type virus likely spread lower rate current strain.

If trend held also means original Type strain indeed far less deadly current strain, means US could easily large Type outbreak without noticeable uptick hospitalizations.  Screw nyt paywall. covid tracking project Source businesses weren‚Äôt wearing masks. first time back last then. bad, loved places pandemic. misunderstanding question?. referring advance team SS showing positive Tulsa rally. LeAn BuSiNeSs MoDeLs Cuomo got caught flat footed like rest country unfortunate position NYC initial outbreak took hold.

But look they've actually responded crisis, clear Cuomo done far better job. ""People like this"" implied people give shit actions affect others. Roughly 80% Americans live urban areas per Census. doubt is. That, bitshift right (effectively /2)...but really work context ;-) Dead on.

Even worse legislation shifts insurer policy swing way makes sense like looking outcomes quality practice compensation base factors, etc., seem swing right direction, implementation always perverted way diminishes value initiative screws physician. Israel never catch break. Absolutely right. UKs numbers appear accurate US. US seems reporting covid deaths variety different reasons.  person kids gets bad I‚Äôll put misery comes that. *There Coronavirus US.*

*It's myth*

*I condition*

*The government trying control us*

*The Flu kills more*

*I'm outside can't catch there*

*My immune system healthy believe vaccines.*

Remember folks, rona US. 


Edit: Forgot takes one person eff everyone, mentality dumb. People want blind it. understanding caused outbreak recent protests partly blamed, don‚Äôt seem enforce social distancing, least wore masks (Dr Fauci warned protesters would spread COVID), unlike lock protesters, wore masks date sweepstakes?  masks need catch on, Denmark's government prevented virus getting far first place. fact they're needed US points governmental failure.  posting articles February it‚Äôs June? It‚Äôs simply testing. We‚Äôve tested many more. know 4 people positive symptoms. ""Can't lot new deaths count them.""

Seriously, rate new deaths compared new cases US ridiculous Russia.

Or believe Russia really 8000 deaths? aren't. US system punish get sick loose job. places much. Still 300 new cases day several weeks since reopening. We‚Äôre second worse situation moment Europe. Sweden first one. exponential growth like that. sucks, given many challenges mitigation many locations sadly surprising. live border province Sweden, nobody care this, please stop trying make thing.
Open borders mostly trouble, people riot streets open again, please let's stay within borders. true... got tested twice, march april, based symptoms sore throat transient fever. We're definitely one progressive states comes governance pandemic works too.

I use public transportation simple protocol go/arrive home. prefer regular hand washing sanitiser dry skin even start bleeding cracks that's even less helpful situation.

So I'm frugal sanitiser try avoid touching stuff outside :/

And hope corona get better next winter there's much dry skin cold :( Sick tired virus Nobody anything, nothing change. people's fault putting much corporations. NL, lots connections France. mean, not. 

You think insulting me, really letting know painfully aware partying high school good life ever going get you. That's sad. China censor much.

Fuck, believe me. visit whenever can.

The collapse video posted mean anything. busy hospitals, people spraying facilities, people street fighting. believe anything read China US media. science says women elderly low risk. understand that. mean, thought Cuomo okay coronavirus got religion, definitely ways response could improved (including stopping stupid beef stupid mayor,) DeSantis‚Äôs strategy basically strategy let virus go crazy.

I‚Äôve said elsewhere, but, ain‚Äôt way I‚Äôm planning trip Florida five years vaccine developed. forced back society next week. Put life hold 2 1/2 months hiding thing end exactly before, risk factor far higher went quarantine. Exactly trying say. We've getting haircuts Netherlands while, good numbers, guess possible. mask mandates, hairdresser ask client health situation making appointment.   Happiness quality life general population. I‚Äôd imagine poll, taken afford America, would similarly high. Wtf MNBC mobile website suppose be? 1 million jump record time really come surprise. Tuesday friday marked new record daily confirmed cases day friday alone almost 1/5 1 million. Oh yes, phrase ""you're bright"" oozing much originality. barely noon 10,000 cases reported. wrong people? Living European country never mandatory masks, tell magic key. everything control without even Clubs reopened already. fucked immensely closing borders then.

[States can't close borders. That's labelled European Union. Tyson Foods. meat flu! correct. I'm Netherlands 2019 total tax rate around 40%, part income 52% bracket. Next 6% healthcare tax around ‚Ç¨1300 private insurance.

But amount people love taken care that's cool. exactly, US definitely behind Northern Europe terms quality life ahead developed countries (UK/France) even par Canada think part problem. million-squire foot facility easily one employee contact dozen dozens employees daily basis. Even proactive, issue someone maintenance staff become asymptomatic carrier. 

Keep mind, assuming get masks necessary run. Many places know simply get them.  love insulting Americans American platform. Ireland, 0 cases last week. county got 7 total. 3 town. Quarantine excelled. Hope America same. China control information tightly. mislead US state propaganda. identifiable specific era, thus used study trash movement decomposition. Yep. kind flu/cold Feb, massive headache. weird thing ""can't taste anything"" syndrome couple days.

That prompted get antibody test. came negative. common cold/flu. 

&amp;#x200B;

I assuming 90% people thought March, probably case bad common flu. remember many medical scientific community saying clinical treatments would probably come vaccine. think small things make big difference (not masks distancing, pure coincidence). many scenarios possible spread it, even committed people may catch spread it. Gun control causes gun violence Well I'm American. I'm Canadian, that's scary Trumps stupidity influenced people countries, also stupid. 8?!?! Lucky! get least 2-3 per hour home, sometimes around 9pm night. nothing change every country imposes quarantine US travel 2 weeks ceases outbound travel USA.

On top that, every State taking virus seriously must impose 2 week quarantine anyone traveling land air sea states festering disease.

Anything less 1 &amp; 2 together means America incubate virus export globally. still possible came contact virus, showed symptoms/fought develop antibodies though, think. boyfriend Labcorp antibody test came back negative, close direct contact someone tested positive antibodies. places like South Korea almost deaths cases yet people US seem okay another 150,000 deaths! Honestly, may well.

The CDC base nearly entire pandemic. dangerous activity picture? haircut outdoors, masks people. hope people careful *and* businesses observe precautions, responsible reopenings possible. (Not responsible.) think visiting European countries anytime soon long President. got test results NEGATIVE explore avenues  That's I'm referring to. porous borders without approved travel.

I realize UK big aviation hub must always economical consideration. vector, vector. fact is, countries made call they're hardly backwoods tiddlers. Ultimately UK end it, absurdly late.

IIRC original justification scale, advice make much difference. statement unbridled skepticism. CDC essentially useless point. threw bullshit .26 mortality rate number, offered clear guidance reopening society, always changing beliefs virus spreads

Rhetoric like often comes people oppose research funding public health emergency. It‚Äôs sit down. want somewhere grab go try Sauce Side, one near 44 curbside. decide go regular fast food it‚Äôs going totally depend franchise owner far masks :( get control. Governor refuses take steps may make look weak eyes decayed orange. Masks mandatory (first time AZ, suggestion) that's moot enforcement either non-existent biased target specific demographics within state. better looking half works sizable hospital chain (she's one ones handles DME patients) ICUs already capacity. gets work exhausted drained sheer volume cases popped last 2 weeks. bringing nurses NY assist now, see happy ending us unless lockdown again, see likelihood happening Trump taking knee BLM. Except European countries curve pandemic wearing masks. 

But hey, ever gives guys reasons yell feel superior guess. Leadership matters, knew. (European) countries parlamentical system multiple parties agree discuss issues.

In US Red vs Blue issues clear divide without agreement possible. 3000 workers 390000 cases let‚Äôs see carry one dot dot dot okay 130 worker seems reasonable Anosmia ageusia common symptom all. They're half common fever. 

Anosmia/ageusia *specific* symptoms. many diseases commonly cause anosmia, anyone symptom days quite likely COVID. Im surprised u are,even U go supermarket bigger city like Breda, people polite, make way patient.

Then whike work constantly evade people forgotten covid...

A good reason wearing masks might remind people tgat still vigilant John*s* Hopkins shit DeSantis talking April early May. lol 


And remember thinking matter time b4 things blew b/c numbers low-ish b/c anything he'd done. RiGHtS Okay, that's real study. seems like 5 month median might closer half-life. question nursing home residents (and really everyone) whether surviving covid affects life expectancy afterwards. number in-patient hospitalizations COVID-19 Friday reached 1,938, 368 COVID-19 patients ventilators 546 ICU beds, department reported. Friday‚Äôs count 1,164 emergency room visits COVID-19 also set record.  *any* employers sports leagues randomly testing employees Covid? Cops firefighters get paid they're people good unions country. Brb going nano sponge cleanse. here, week Thanksgiving, feel like telltale symptoms. REALLY sick 3-4 days better within week, that's I'm sure Covid not. recent Italian study Lombardi region puts number 64%.

But varies age, younger are, higher percentage asymptomatic earn ‚Ç¨60k Netherlands pay around ‚Ç¨5k healthcare tax private insurance combined. next income tax. That's actually pretty normal number, European countries 8% 14% income going towards healthcare form tax, insurance, copay, deductible other.

So $10k US tech job sounds like much affordable. also halt foreigners coming taking virus back Country origin. 
I would hate see too. US's response political, seeing political alignment dictates federal state guidelines are, also dictates section population adheres best practices. belong per mod's rules. Reported really simple ploy get rid obstacles prevent deforestation example? pretend there's problem, people hit hardest ones standing way - Even lose political office, business thrive 'blows over'. Well, skeptical COVID causing people collapse, posted link NY man collapsing street dying COVID. comment article comedian COVID collapsing stage.

Like, understand certain amount skepticism, seems like might leaning far ‚ÄúTHIS COULD NEVER HAPPEN HERE‚Äù direction. Like said, since we‚Äôve reached uncontrolled spread multiple states governor vowing ‚Äúno shutdowns,‚Äù we‚Äôll see COVID collapses become common. possible vaccine ready everyone January ? mean virus likely man-made people would suspicious available public January number study around 10%, entirely within realm false initial positives...that‚Äôs even considering fact study made lot assumptions ‚Äúshould have‚Äù exposed, initial test not. Well looking original commenters point again, seem suggesting real spike comes within month spread spread speak. People caught rally one thing, spread another. They‚Äôve got sound point there, true full effects given *single* event often take long show up. 

I agree cases *directly* rally show 2 weeks, we‚Äôre likely see even start showing within 1 week. spread take longer likely near impossible gauge considering people gathered different states event. mistake. precise. ""V√¶rtshuse"" (boomer bars ) restaurants open since mid may. Nightclubs, music venues government calls ""natteliv"" (night life) still closed August.
Friday week several bars Copenhagen previously defined ""night life"" changed status could open. dumb don‚Äôt work again, vanity important safety US  states taken using Sundays tout well doing. Texas Gov lot - ""Oh look we've lowest day (insert data here) today! We're great!"" 


With said time gone think everyone mostly stopped processing deaths weekends. week double-digit deaths weekend comes 1 2 - lol. Sunday Monday's numbers basically useless point. Protests aren‚Äôt helping either. That's worst part. many friends US cocooning home two months it'll potentially nothing eventually get forced back society. symptoms 37% COVID-19 nursing home 2 (20%) asymptomatic (had symptoms) hospitalized

Like, what? Either error, need word headline much clearly worse that, job literally nothing, stay away people, safe...and rest group even simplest things. Canada dm new normal That's crazy, think would big difference behaviour. shows absolute lack understanding plumbing. apt/house reek poop 24/7 P-traps working NOTHING coming way. literally barrier water separates rest plumbing. Every time use sink/toilet pushes old p-trap water replaces it. smell poo p-traps working.

Literally way stuff get ""black"" water flowing sinks/toilets, toilet exploding poop water apt. think pressing concerns.

Your advice may heartfelt true. Please stop spreading facebook level misinformation people! seem contributing factor, though. People outside many wearing masks. named favipriavir/Avigan. talked bit March. Indian paper report March 20, 2020. came HCQ craze. thing Italy could actually enforce rules fine people. can't really US. English person, England still fucked. follow example.

Don't know status Wales Scotland Ireland though, bet they're lot better. might ok dying, ""I've long life"" etc, realize they'll dying alone, none family allowed visit hospital? Even though nightclubs back open Madrid? know, I'm residing Denmark. switched 1m rule instead, unless singing believe. Doubt That's fair. Trump's speech bleach, elected representative graced us knowledge uv light kills covid, inject light cured... yeah claims sun kills covid instantly safe outside large crowds bunk science hate Sweden much? seem spend lot time reddit focused spreading negative articles place. **only one ninety centers across country** selected participate trial. Maybe aim ensure everyone gets infected we'll desperate help? \^\^ this. even tracked company owners caused it. sure Australia ""island"" relevant? Australia 1/13 USA's population less 1/1000th death toll. hubby wants live Canada. really need learn countries places decide. Probably Canada Japan. like said it‚Äôs visual aesthetics haven‚Äôt researched enough know actual benefits experience. Sweden. I'm guessing part Trump's policy part campaign. He's basically saying: ""If want lockdown, vote me!"". [Comparison number Italy psy ops don‚Äôt see scenario summer isn‚Äôt excruciating based spikes we‚Äôre seeing across south right now. would take lot elected officials pull heads asses ASAP. I‚Äôm afraid prove stubborn anything double idiot stances masks, opening full throttle, etc.. I‚Äôd argue 2 types lockdowns, de jure type de facto type.

In de jure lockdown, government restricts economic activity control spread Coronavirus.

In de facto lockdown, citizens restrict economic activity realized get critically ill, die hospital waiting room doctors bed them. government won‚Äôt protect citizens, citizens protect themselves. 

A de jure lockdown bad enough, think people would stunned destructive de facto lockdown would economy.  thought going read police enforcing public mask-wearing--pleasantly surprised police this. Nope. police agencies enforcing requirements mask-wearing. WTF? Checks out. freedoms.  ICU care extremely intensive survival chances old frail people horrible, even start healthy.

Even chance 1 1000, would still several lives saved treatment denied them. Instead ICU beds kept empty stats looked remember though prioritization changed since even corona patient ventilator denied one.

False. proven false many times. major way test immunity. actually matters bit whether inside outside. top proximity, air circulation important factor Covid spreads. Bad cold/flu season + bad RSV going around thought COVID. research 

Research costs money. past 30-50 years whether masks stop spread something? Seems like could experiments week even hadnt.

You ""could"", dictatorial regime somewhere, concept ethical review safeguards human experimentation. Yeah, credit ruined. Although imo that's still better outcome debt U.K., example, bailiff comes home starts taking shit. bad U.S. is, least debitor-friendly whereas countries like U.K. historically creditor-friendly.  Going step further: symptomatic means able tell else (e.g. medical professional) feel unwell. Patients Alzheimer's disease late-stage dementia reliable narrators medical history.

In English moved Seattle Amsterdam feel like learned first world country Thx sharing insights.. Dude american going entire year gone, lost months. Minimum. Seeing Ireland sadly. small uptick mask wearing seen. vast majority still wearing them

I think government need make mandatory, prevent 2nd wave.

Honestly wearing mask mean get back semblance normality, people still refuse wear them. retarded. choosing ignore record number cases?

Are choosing ignore science *outdoor transmission*? 

[Transmission coronavirus 20x lower outdoor settings, viral load lower droplet aerosols poorly ventilated spaces SARS-CoV-2 Nah, masks great second-best thing have.

#1 Social distancing, really works!! Whenever possible, awesome tool have. GOLD MEDAL!!
#2 Masks! They're really pulling weight, even iffy ones making real difference! SILVER masks!
#3 Additional PPE care like gloves, eye protection, washing hands, changing clothes, taking us even further. BRONZE PPE care practices
#4 Everything else, like trying make loud noises ""s"" sounds indoors, little part help. medal keep good work! Kids wipe ass inflatable pools? world doesn‚Äôt stop spinning. ""We tried hard got far, end even matter."" try googling.

Depends area. Provincetown, last week, open restaurants, offer outdoor seatings, tables spaced isolated transparent panels, menu available online (QR scan table, give single use printed one needed, QR heavily encouraged), pay fully online, etc. far away ""as virus gone"". outside people seemed forget masks (they looked uncomfortable without them, guessing accident rather deliberate decision), everyone wearing one. don‚Äôt think idea yet. Spain hit much harder parts Europe lockdown measures stared ease.

I live Austria. Lockdown eased 6 weeks now. People still wear masks, even situations mandated. People still distancing still prioritizing home office work.

Knock wood, relaxations show similar responses. mean, does. mean transmission one person next 70x faster US, 70 infected people US every infected person Ireland. course assuming spread densely concentrated within small part country (which isn't).

Look ""BLM protests 2020."" see seas people wearing masks yes, concrete difference BLM protesters kids lockdown protesters. BLM protests tend ask attendees adhere guidelines prevent COVID spread course - protests protecting black community going needlessly put attendants risk. course COVID risk still present, fundamentally risk exists large gatherings. Tech/startup culture toxic, weather south horrendous, people often aren‚Äôt friendly don‚Äôt conform views. 

The nature food good though. two girls bikes ok also guy left group three guys. two guys (the one lighting cigarette one mask hanging) respect social distancing.

The two girls drink seem might far enough respect social distancing rules (1 meter = 3.28 feet). 0 deaths North South Ireland today, 3 new cases South. tend bit lag weekend, 22 new cases yesterday South.

Things seem steady couple weeks now. still think far people wearing masks, seen small tick last week, something.

The thing worried people seem complacent. see groups far large household social distancing, kind thing could us stuck back inside careful. People need take seriously, even numbers improving. Ah, ok. read positive it. Sorry. comment think responding to? said way, shape, form, blind praise? person characterized success luck, stated truth. luck, COVID nowhere near lethal thought was.

The whole idea flattening curve preventing everyone getting it. develop vaccine, chances people going end getting it. goal prevent collapse healthcare system, which, far, did.

To criticize NY government adequately preventing spread virus neither cure vaccine, particularly government done best job country far mitigating spread best ignorant worst intellectually dishonest. Jo Jorgensen 2020 work senior care home besides work getting gas, haven‚Äôt near anyone else since Michigan got first confirmed cases early March. go park one else around, that‚Äôs it. Haven‚Äôt seen mom months, friends. It‚Äôs worth facility somehow stayed COVID-free despite epicenter shit state, see chucklefucks big ol‚Äô parties walking around without masks... ooh pisses off, thinking careful coworkers day day out. 

So many coworkers kids daycare, go grocery shop, etc. general public fucks things increases risk catching passing onto residents. frail are, we‚Äôd probably looking 50% mortality rate. people want whole thing go away they‚Äôre going stick heads sand. howmis area relevant factor? well aware dimensions Us.... cops would teargassed like actual blm protestors. quarantine I‚Äôve eating healthy working best shape I‚Äôve awhile. Figure eventually get might well give body best chance beat virus. Seems silly eased anxiety COVID somewhat. funny - comments favour blm protests, also completely political, allowed stay...
double standards much?  Drone gruel freshest. Lol people fuckin obsessed America rotting brains. Insufferable. Plants open still seeing cases. Shortsighted. band hs performed graduation every year. time graduation rolled around sick them. least high school class small, 150 people. College graduation *brutal*. wants die weekend? That's best part week! Better die Monday get reported Tuesday, Mondays awful anyway. live Bay Area/SF definitely curbing COVID-19. Hospitalizations down, cases down, deaths down. Overall, far better lot European urban centers. think comparisons much fix anything, fair question European countries far quelled exponential increases

That 100% reason article posted know it. They‚Äôre outside though it‚Äôs ok. masks except one wearing scarf, go inside covered. asshole wants please master Washington bad, he's willing kill us all.
And mayor Jacksonville, too. healthcare isn‚Äôt overwhelmed far they‚Äôre successful.

Thinking country handle 30k cases/day long period time optimistic. Currently procedures rescheduled outright cancelled. sustained strain healthcare sector wear personell material time.

Let alone fact high incident rate, tougher contain hot spots thus leads cases/day overall.

But hey. Good luck you.  exactly again? Polly want cracker? stopped looking effort combat COVID19 experiment human subjects benefit mankind. sure tbh locking later, shutting borders. replace talking actual contact tracer phone! contact tracer apps effective majority region uses that's nowhere close case United States.  live beach,‚Äù student body president said.

Well, got point. /s can't speak Europe Belgium one wearing either. Yes, 3-5 inches shorter Trump. goal small biotech company bought larger biotech company infrastructure carry production bigger scale. wouldn‚Äôt make size company issue - make good point whether actually anything vs trying hype up. 

As far complaints mRNA vaccine, don‚Äôt really get mean. Injecting mRNA similar injecting antigen matter don‚Äôt know whether severe adverse immune response triggered... like vaccine doesn‚Äôt use mRNA. That‚Äôs entire point testing, identify potential side effects determine whether mitigated. also don‚Äôt get mean protein inhibitors since mRNA COVID vaccine afaik. Hey, suppressed plenty DATA coronavirus. count? Considering removed post almost immediately likely automatic removal... means used banned political keyword.


Try removing specific party names specific politician names post again. Yeah except fact Italy average age 45 years life expectancy 83, USA 38 life expectancy 78. 
Almost 29% population 65yo Italy. Covid hit harder older get kills mostly people 80 (at least here, know rest world), yeah: higher death per capita really count. pretty encouraging *only* 6200 people showed up. Even though huge propaganda machine right trying downplay virus, encourage people go ""open economy,"" supporters still wary enough avoid going convention like this. COVID place would packed capacity. 

So many people stupid enough go something like pandemic thought. see media specifically social media, thought way willing risk it. Portland Oregon sewer hole right now. Miami daddy üëå I'm conflicted. one hand, least White House acknowledging Coronavirus still exists. hand, we're pretty much fucked regardless. problem culture anti-science US. corona many issues. Let add list companies I‚Äôm boycotting response Covid then. don‚Äôt care workers, certainly don‚Äôt care health. I‚Äôm north east times I‚Äôve I‚Äôve barely seen anyone wearing mask, maybe 1-2%, certainly near 10-15%, still far low, around parts half joking question, touching face real risk prompting need hand sanitizer washing, would suppose stands reason touching infected salad potential risk. keeping distance/ going much big impact. 

I notice didnt answer 1 5 claim. still got fault). That‚Äôs hilarious. sure deaths even reported accurately? think reasonably hope second wave handled better doesn‚Äôt rise fast. information least, masks common, useful rules distance followed people. said really expected people‚Äôs behaviour change longer actually make second wave unlikely Seriously - it‚Äôs strange people trying justify elimination ‚Äúoriginal goal‚Äù even goal bringing New Zealand - US tiny island nation!!! also NZ resurgence cases opened back bc let two people attend funeral. Elimination feasible goal shooting for, people tu quoque thing saying ‚Äúyeah flattened working eliminate NZ it‚Äù must living different reality. Well election though. Sanitiser plenty of. iirc make much booze actually exporting raw ethanol product elsewhere. really small portable ones tend go stock though, thats people idiots hand sanny shortage atm. brief moment march panic serious, things levelled arent real major restrictions.

Same applies wipes, know several stores perfectly fine levels stock panic over. think May onwards fine since.

PPE harder gauge, N95s hard general get anywhere, cant really tell professional situation is, normal face masks still good supply plebs day day, perfectly adequate slowing spread essential runs. Yeah 1500 chromebooks end life year. getting replaced instead going back service 6th year. I'm hopping make through, rough shape beginning last year. Especially 7th 8th grade. 

Yep made tons cuts here. lay teachers also replacing retired. Yo se parcero :) Europe also large gatherings thousands people really tho isn‚Äôt true, you‚Äôre obsessed Yes, cherry picking Italy. better compare whole world, Europe. Italy bad, Portugal much closer Italy American states across country. 150 people dead million. Italy suffering much. learned it. Europe double population size States, 187000 death, america number 122000. America catching Europe, way ahead. That‚Äôs simple naturally social creatures. get feeling Redditors naturally withdrawn ideal ... know?? 60 million rural areas quite bit using per capita Yeah large gatherings hundreds thousands people us. Fabric masks provide much protection n95, incorrect say provide protection. study read showed cloth mask stops 75% viral load.

The higher viral load, likely contract disease. Fortunately me, feel like paid dues back 2008. hard time us, work baby way. couldn‚Äôt go anything watch every penny. husband work almost two years, managed cobble together contracting work, though rate lower used making. made through, barely, can‚Äôt imagine again. It'd nice aware anything outside himself. pregnant women US decide going back work high volume store reopened staying home without pay baby arrives. stayed home watching new case numbers steadily break records news every day. crazy place resuming operations trumped safety. knows long safe baby born. R Interested well guess virus control relative, opinion would countries begin open cases go down. social distancing lockdown critical flattening curve. WFH, social distancing encouraging people meet outdoors much bigger role fabric masks. 

Also mask usage hardly widespread Europe, countries like UK non existent still continuing drop cases 50 deaths day, still dropping, despite easing lockdown restrictions. really believed safe, campaign would offered cover coronavirus medical costs attendees 2 weeks rally.

About that.. gonna happen. registration page rally. that‚Äôs Sorry man, pains see country way. potential much better. state everything control principle phased reopening (our largest county ended lockdown week) mandating masks, orders teeth. latest grocery store chain literally come said won‚Äôt enforce mask rule. businesses likely follow suit since there‚Äôs repercussions. Yeah exactly, don‚Äôt pay cost customer employee healthcare, environmental disasters, oil spill cleanups, hurricane relief, etc. it‚Äôs factored business model. Don‚Äôt buy large companies avoid it! say ""too large"". Canada geographically larger, well. China larger population well. 

I think right divided anti-scientific part, though. think even contact tracing side. 

If John gets covid health department asks within 6 feet minutes, know first last names every kid sits around? Especially school going back full capacity. Potentially 8 kids (one side plus diagonal desk rows columns) times 7 class periods = 56 kids, plus lunch, plus kids bus ways, plus school staff. 

That lot exposure kids may able name John‚Äôs mom sends school day doesn‚Äôt feel great temperature 101. 

That also disregarding air flow issues shown contribute cases.  

Also, plan exposure? kids staying home 14 days? middle high school 1000 kids, two teachers get 150 students, potentially 300 kids, 30% school. everyone going come school still going hope best? Jajajaja sabes de lo que hablas guey. reported failed consider high odds virus came another country, China. Take Australia example, cases Chinese students visitors, came US Europe. Another note also mentioned, Chinese new year festival time. anyone know big event is, everybody China goes back home hometown celebrate families friends. includes students workers overseas. Therefore, people flying China flying it. population international students workers China also much lower. Unfortunately, unless want euthanise older frail people get certain state - there's nothing do. get 3 minutes holiday year though?  Hopefully peaceful protests don‚Äôt cause numbers rise. White House gone daily. 

They think that's safe thing people going work. Mouth breathers‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll ruin teeth.  Wtf.... Never heard source really depends live. compelling argument opinion already hold. None info article US Govt garbage selfish wants economy strong. US human farm rich. middle lower classes don‚Äôt matter majority country cares haircuts ‚Äúgetting back normal‚Äù hope vaccine found people aren‚Äôt stupid enough think it‚Äôll cause autism... hate country Looks like uk moving 1 metre plus official advise. Technically official guidance 1m though. curious, supply sanitizers PPE Australia?

Currently US, can't buy N95 masks anywhere unless business willing buy bulk spend lot money. supply alcohol hand sanitizer irregular. supply sanitizing wipes nonexistent. point ‚Äúhaving virus control‚Äù farce. ‚Äúunder control‚Äù. really doesn‚Äôt matter US European country right.

Even New Zealand can‚Äôt go back normal. genie bag. 

Either let virus spread crush economy. option kills people? Hard tell. 

Plant garden. Stay away people. historic time getting started. Laughs Greek Who‚Äôs ‚Äúwe?‚Äù That's good. Except officials already spent last two months telling us mAsKs dOnT wOrK ""Great"" meant *sarcastic* manner. could live exciting life anywhere days rise technology internet. Physical location overrated. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è hope realize error ways without anything permanent, incurable, death. Thank you! It‚Äôs possible headline saying is, people lots virus, show immune response likely die.  (boomer bars )

Lmfao.  think point common knowledge CDC made misleading statements effectiveness mass concerned medical workers would run them. I'd really curious know anyone could project many lives saved medical staff masks versus many lives lost general public wearing masks. imagine would fairly difficult project, however, even guidance wear masks people refuse wear due identity politics. health lost freedom?!   live western PA vast majority people wearing masks stores. Today local grocery store, absolutely packed. Every single person wearing mask, happier community. Texas childcare centers see sharp increase coronavirus cases months relative last name towards end alphabet get it! Damn, hated part. same, EU 326 deaths per million, US 369 remember Anti-EU people banging can't control borders, despite fact, close good reason so, member states actually lot leeway good enough reason. New Zealand 95% back normal. friend said went see band bar everyone sweating, drinking, social distancing all. thing still different capped venue capacity lower pre-Corona Texas childcare centers see sharp increase coronavirus cases months relative America Man #Guess who‚Äôs boycotting Dole?!?!?!

üòÄ. Considering EU clearly bigger population landmass even half big US one, makes EU look even better comparison. U.S. essentially given up. Oh wow I‚Äôm dumb hell don‚Äôt know didn‚Äôt occur lol takes people die it. Don‚Äôt impressed- government pumping money fast can. dont think guy intention getting anyone else sick, did.

I hear saying believe comparison bit different. flu likely contracted passed novel virus, even perceived clear present danger Im 100% you, differ one ""harms"" another.

I believe see might aligned principle think. believe personal responsibility. right live life see fit. responsible successes failures. means fully responsible, liable, rewards / damages cause.

If free wish, assume liability actions. example, drive car (this damn analogy again) recklessly high speeds run pedestrians, held liable damages.

Same could said covid. behaving recklessly amid pandemic, assume risk actions. means get someone sick traced back you, held liable. 

The difficultly contact tracing permit reckless (negligent) behavior. willingly resisting appropriate step mitigate risk infection, assuming risk actions. you, infect.

You can't demand right potentially harm others impunity. Trump kept touting France (where first used), Italy, huge number countries denounced it. big international survey studies showed entirely ineffective caused deaths. weeks ago, came specific report faulty data. 

Ironically, big study shut trials, point French Italian data March, American University data April June investigating medicine. 

...the American research corroborated earlier studies, came data exaggerated, conclusions line every know test case hydroxychloriquine. 

Basically never proof positive effects, doctor say might help denounced home country, overwhelming evidence work. fact, still seen causing deaths taking medicine -- though less chloriquine, potent version. Credit really goes mentor, Boss Hogg. sunlight ailment. fib. science guys. article states ""some"" could experience long lasting lung damage. goes onto say risk severe bouts covid (ventilators) , heavy pre existing lung conditions. yet get it.

My uncle caught MERS 80 shit ton comorbidities fine 2 weeks. quit trying scare young n healthy people who've lingering sick months. sometimes takes good 6 mo beat pneumonia lets chill F out. fine. let redditor go back tom cave legitimately concerned true. ‚òπÔ∏è  Truth show vote.

""Just it!"" Probably. living lives following rules governments guidance is. always like put perspective main reddit. Loud minority views drown attract like minded people go whatever push. 

California 2 days ago put mandatory face coverings places hardly saw anything negative come it. I‚Äôm sure loud bunch upset somewhere generally people like okay sounds good. Well 20,000 people even show up. hindsight, correct. Wow I‚Äôm sorry. feel like doctor saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù makes sense that. C-SPAN rush transcript tried paste quote context got automodded, nm. quote ""01:01:43"" subsection) doubt it, still people wouldnt believe unless impacted directly. doubt ever tipping point. Imagine everyone decided call Trump Virus. must due increased testing...s/ Morons good Scottsdale one rich suburb metro area everyone hates see cops specifically. many mayors, governors, city councils, etc. addition sheriffs refusing follow implement mask requirements. surprised Trump gets re-elected. Biden strong candidate. Lots interstate travel planes ferry‚Äôs. lots outbreaks right issued warning community spread. 

Seriously though aren‚Äôt protected. wouldn‚Äôt believe number non resident infections popping up. I'm starting get impression silent majority America quietly handling better they've let on. Deaths still falling might mean cases seem rising better testing. Apparently Trump's Tulsa rally pull great numbers starting look like protests never big media wants be. Mask usage great, maybe people staying home now? might getting small, reckless cross-section full picture look group people spend lot time outside. Maybe us seeing bullshit seems. Right you. I'm fed assholes. Fuck them. better crowing hospital loved ones catch this. go outside food, etc... sure wear mask bar restaurant.. that‚Äôs places remain takeout only. better saying people wear masks actively saying hate you. shame...i went Florida 10 years ago loved it.

TIL Governor Whitmer department. ""no politics"" rule funny considering government responsible covid response fabricated negative results continue able discharge patients make space new admissions avoid negative publicity oversight would result positive COVID-19 results disclosed,‚Äù lawsuit says.

Hey, what's really important keep butts moving chairs like cheap restaurant. Paid bill? Great. time talking, get bus reset next customer! also 80% people show mild symptoms, i‚Äôd say they‚Äôre minority 20% 1% unfortunate people don‚Äôt survive. Lancet credibility left far i'm concerned virus AZ control. another example continuing. What? issue would packaging. certainly worried catching food plastic-wrapped refrigerated meats. Well, Alaska. state isolated nature cities. Sure can. Seems like indoor dining restaurants is, time again, proving bad fucking idea. ""we rehearsing play...."" antifa provocateur think two ""sides"" consist of?

The two sides see people hiding homes past several months, nervously venturing groceries periodically, people never stopped working jobs. Truck drivers factory workers restaurant cooks plumbers, never stopped risking getting sick, can't work home.

Those real two sides. sane world, DeSantis would thrown jail rest life put FL citizens danger pandemic, advance political agenda. But, 2020 - Trump probably create sort medal Actually, mutations disguise early detection, spread increases, normal evolutionary behavior.

But much efficient ways optimizing spread - causes dry hacking coughs, sneezing, wet coughing, bloody coughing. well confusion restlessness. Like guy falling skyscraper window. Falls past 3rd floor: ""so far good!"" Obviously not. 40 infections population 60 million. friend 30 fared pretty well overall Covid also still doesn‚Äôt taste back 3 months later. told could permanent.  wonder many rally longer alive 4-5 weeks now? reflect Chile recorded deaths per capita USA. rate outbreak going, seem likely deaths per capita worst European nations soon well. I'm proud you. important give credit develop thoughts. ü•∞  Spinning getting worked useless bullshit. Wear fucking mask! work! They're perfect! shit's hard understand. add bonus one beer Corona... Lol, Fuck impact, need coin. picked great year suck. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll see deaths Texas 20 today. They‚Äôve high case numbers while.
New York 800 deaths day peak. ask something else going on. saw someone post random tiktok video claiming people Brazil going hospital claimed thousands covid patients entered half ass construction room (don't even show entering sort hospital all) 0 patients. video evidence covid fake propagated world leaders. Yeah, husband, son, cat got sick early February, along 2/3 people work. weeks since biggest protests, seen spike cities major ones held. Masks stop aerosolization outdoor environments provide much ventilation. pretty safe. said done couple years, epidemiologists find death toll 10-20% higher official numbers. Lmao, one made claim regarding rarity. seen anyone else talk common sub. Jesus. Just...like...head meet desk. Sounds like it‚Äôs alright! /s That's not.....how works....

I guess capital state boonies along lot cities. shadows NYC. Hell even boonies NJ ain't boonies guess rural AF ain't NYC ha  Saturday too, usually day lower numbers. Well banning travel China certainly hurt. Fortunately hunches regarding virus cure turned fine. Oh wait... complete total piece shit.

i honestly expected start warning ""2nd amendment people"" ready, democrats coming steal election. coming. Finger licking good. Fuck. headline makes sound worse encourage communities take precautionary measures mandated Governor‚Äôs office prevent spread Covid-19,"" Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said. ""However, enforcement efforts include encouraging said department ""simply resources conduct mask enforcement"" continue focus attention ""on crimes criminals impact public safety.""

I know get great compliance tell people writing tickets, honestly im sure would want police looking tickets write wearing masks either. least telling truth Yakima? Heat damage mask time, since virus cannot survive mask much longer 7 days, recommend passive disinfection method afford wait, either hang mask promote ventilation-faciliatated viral decay place paper bag (not plastic trap moisture keep viruses alive longer) small children around might touch hang mask. Pretty sure Oxford one potential fall. others pushed back 2021 quite bad, serology says would lot worse waited longer. really good article, unfortunate title means something completely different (or, arguably, ambiguous).

0.47% Segovia 0.24% Madrid (community) dead. Compare 0.30% NYC 0.58% (limited data) Bergamo (province). Agreed. live decent neighborhood La. rich...not poor...most everyone wearing masks. what‚Äôs point slowing testing smaller numbers? He‚Äôs basically saying don‚Äôt like looks make harder people get tested. It‚Äôs sickening. remember said anyone wants get tested can. Test, contact tracing wearing masks. That's needed squash pandemic. give up. I'm going hide bunker mess over. play VR I'll get socialization way.  Roscoe P. Coltrane. think two ""sides"" consist of?

Democrats somewhat likely wearing masks Republicans are.

If want know real two sides are, people hiding homes past several months, nervously venturing groceries periodically, people never stopped working jobs. Truck drivers factory workers restaurant cooks plumbers, never stopped risking getting sick, can't work home.

We‚Äôre [1000 new cases per still falling, still track reopen restaurants July. Although still 100k total confirmed cases. Interesting staying home proposed you. Since would fully absolve whole fear weakness problem. (And without projecting incompetence upon others.) 

No, go straight telling everyone else cannot do. admit caring people even lives, primary interest everyone obedient. 

(Do see connections here? mean fear weakness resulting need accommodated order people around? think explored. 
Scientifically.)

Since smart went college totally ripped off, perhaps learned studies impact fear anxiety upon immune function overall health. Surely did. 

Yet projecting fear anxiety right now. demand everyone else feel incompetent incapable even like go store, organize amongst themselves. (You particularly concerned organizing amondst themselves, lol.)

Sorry honey things sort give away.  think ruler universe, yes, going patronized. first corona fight wifey 3 months self quarantine. shits gonna get bad gets better. figured issues know lot decent relationships going go shit cabin fever. life dude.. always thought ww3 going end. dump like trash. ran nursing home would dump like trash. I'd dump like something better. brainer right? deluded? don‚Äôt plan get high risk pregnancy. pregnancy several reasons turn high risk. Everyone needs getting best classes masks can, even better best surgical masks find. There's certainly chance anyone could get infected virus still develop antibodies recovery. Europe big generalize. Madrid (Spain), like 80% wearing correctly. Also mandatory public places, social distancing hand sanitizer shops.  read post? another go it. Oh don‚Äôt worry. second spike EU coming. latest easing restrictions made EVERYONE flock together. Since last week I‚Äôve seen many large groups together, it‚Äôs like people trying spread damn thing much possible.

AHH shit Ihave out! got shove Vag back down, give sec want dick slip in. Words meaning. dont understand ur question. Please clarify. live Europe seen one person mask there's real need see there's videos people going mad reddit first cases Europe early December. saying early November. What‚Äôs point here?

The science clear: transmission disease exacerbated lack masks people close proximity one another. can‚Äôt understand insist ignorance. see trend deaths goal ""not overwhelm healthcare system"" slow rate infection social distancing initially gradually remove polices immunity gradually increases take place social distancing without overwhelming healthcare system. life goes back normal.

Not exactly rocket science figure lot people seem intentionally misinterpret ""herd immunity"" sort binary variable something grows time. 

As end game disease might die enough people immune get vaccine probably years away. http://access.tarrantcounty.com/content/main/en/public-health/disease-control---prevention/coronaviruas.html?linklocation=departmentcarousel&amp;linkname=Public%20Health:COVID-19%20(Coronavirus) suppressed though. I'll keep wearing one.

The go shop number see wearing masks going up. Could purely anecdotal coincidence. feel like people seen wearing more, becomes common see people wearing them, people apprehensive wearing might start coming around idea.

Also they're still damn hard get think. I'm lucky wear work grab extra couple week shops (work fine people this). Looking Florida. curve cannot stay flat. It‚Äôs scientifically impossible.

Also hospital/ retirement facilities/ emergency personal workers tested often repeatedly. like happened one Arizona case, genuinely hope coronavirus teach one lesson well. Chinese propaganda January: wear masks, quarantine, virus bad. Truthful propaganda still truthful.

Forcibly locking entire population homes, threat arrest/fines, undeniably effective strategy containing virus. surprise numbers much lower countries locked down. would actually shocking numbers much lower, especially places imposed draconian measures. 

What misses actual core issue lockdown first place. order effective long timeline, would need place way danger completely subsided. instance government closing forms transportation incoming blizzard, hurricane good use power. event active shooter, terrorist situation contained, excellent time everyone shelter place authorities neutralize situation. 

Why apply here, Sweden correct strategy, threat neutralized. closer type cure treatment today, March. 

Anyone qualified speak realistic timeline vaccine being:

A:discovered 

B:deemed safe peer reviewed human trials 

C:deployed scale never seen human history inoculate large enough percentage population make meaningful change. 

Is optimistically, best case scenario 18 months away. interviews virologists read seem think even number fantasy. 
 
If anything appears inevitable ever CV run population eventually, every country who's media constantly throwing shade Sweden simultaneously easing restrictions, fast pace. 

Most Sweden march within weeks now, far policy goes. opened things up, best practice suggested measures gradually lose teeth, come terms futility trying stop economy order contain virus.

No nation would ability sustain lock even half time March 2020, day vaccine widely deployed. Perhaps Norway Emirati nations, could burn entire sovereign wealth fund universal basic income, would come time civil unrest would boil over, populace would demand let out. 

Sweden ahead curve thinking long range. hilarious disingenuous articles posted every day irresponsible Sweden was, entire world quickly shifting following lead. 

Basically thing lockdown countries achieved pushing time line two months road. 

As open back up, two months now, many envying surprisingly low numbers Sweden experiencing. I'm sure since forgotten, righteous indignation have, bricks throwing glass houses. finding cases coming elective surgery without symptoms? source statement? might say lot illnesses. rural areas like Culpeper, front royal, Warrenton , travel northern va, DC Md work.

Leland went tiny little grocery store didn‚Äôt see single person without mask. even saw people wear masks walking side road. think rural towns care think. fear repercussions though oniony enough

nothteonion mods course EU strain know know one released look like one ehh takes 7-10 days positive test admitted hospital, another week die. seriously think people catch immediately drop dead, you? WTF WRONG DUMB FUCKS!!!!! Sad thing people downvote probably never even saw Craig. think twice long fly.

Live life. 99% America diagnosed CDC says 99.6% chance survival. (Regular flu 99.8%) elective surgeries open coming things put asymptomatic carriers. Explains cases ""hospitalizations"" going deaths stagnant going down. wrong feel bit of....idk vindication? would never wish chronic pain / autoimmune conditions another person, ever since I‚Äôve diagnosed, notice people really can‚Äôt relate realize much struggle function every day. may look healthy outside, promise 95% time, barely focus I‚Äôm concentrated pain fatigued. That's science. That's unprepared officials lying public try get favorable outcome. 

Many people died.... WHO, CDC fauci guilty murder. disguised different symptoms. That's good people need self quarantine. There's mention covid-19 less severe people high-risk get it. means younger people getting transmitting it, symptoms outside norm. someone stomachache fever practicing social distancing, they're likely infect others telltale signs. They'll finally get treatment becomes much. mean infect experience severe symptoms.  They‚Äôre routinely testing people covid Florida hospitals all. 

In New York nobody gets admitted without test. due respect federal government could intervene, override state government based interstate commerce grounds, make reopening safe way.

The problem federal government? One Donald J. Trump let that. trough people states surge locked down, states decided surge restrictions whatsoever. lot people going die. neighborhood? Probably not. Walking around city, should. Somebody tell Brazil virus getting weaker. live WI 2 hospitals support basically whole western edge Waukesha County. ProHealth facility like 88 beds Aurora facility probably more. Aurora hospital though, also consolidated general practitioners lab facilities 1/3 actual beds. I'd guess total 200-220 beds 2 hospitals probably primary hospitals 40k-50k people. area sees surge, we're probably fucksville. New England shutdown around 2-3 months still fully opened back like Florida. long time get control. Saw guy giving man street comment CNN reporter, close paraphrase was: ""I'm worried, know get it, even get like cold.""

Smh. combination would love chance suck Trump‚Äôs dick, gets closer chance. strongly dislike governor. assume every person see covid... would encounters change exiting high risk environment... 

Any person could could carrier. already wayyy deep community spread... doesnt matter see people store trail. could picked door handle. beyond contact tracing usa. Im saying everyone go back pre-pandemic, new normals need arrive at. Craig Kilborn funnier. said it.

Louder please. 

A lot us kind look viruses ""you get don't"" binary way thinking works (in practice) number viruses, we've seen COVID, that's case. 

If someone influenza they're contagious, thankfully, know it. They're miserable, leaking sorts fluids, signalling obviously ""I'm sick avoid me.""

COVID, many people reason forget, pre-symptomatic period (and hell include 100% asymptomatics extent here), shedding virus showing symptoms. 

This means people share car with. Someone spend hours next stuffy office. People increasingly-concentrating viral cloud also breathing .

***

Doctors inadequate PPE - think stories heard March April otherwise healthy doctors straight dying COVID. simply got infected - viral load high they're going patient patient paper mask. doctors might pre-symptomatic stripped down/dressed together end/start shifts. 

***

With decent social distancing compliance coupled luxury summer (where overall, people spread out), coupled whatever effect UV light sun may virus (I've read every report goes ""Only UV-C kills it""- atmospheric UV, ""All UV kills it""). 

We outsmarting virus way, get infected light viral load. also bought time free resources get cytokine stormed treated hope better outcomes. 

***

With said, cold weather terrify everyone. going US end October? *this* what's prompting widespread testing? past 4 months??? I‚Äôve shown plenty compassion. never said advocate letting virus run rampant also don‚Äôt advocate scaring entire population shitless giving young people
Anxiety issues they‚Äôll struggle shake rest lives virus probably wouldn‚Äôt affect them. Well cant put price life offense knowing cases spiking going anyway reckless irresponsible.i dont blame quarantine kills yall relationship wasnt you..I cut girl talking refused wear mask property manager kills kids always around folks older dice pussy isnt worth life It‚Äôs stepped though making shit up. Well lockdown supposed buy time order ramp testing, tracing, hopefully find new treatments overloading hospital system. state looked happened Wuhan, Italy, France, UK, Spain, New York essentially nothing lockdown time, postponing inevitable. think people realized pretending virus gone actually make virus gone. That's good point contacted could explain would get tested even felt fine. police mask laws simply feasible would drain resources. *‚ÄúSome people coming really sick others aren‚Äôt sick all,‚Äù said Patricia Diaz, nurse University Hospital Tamarac. ‚ÄúSome come abdominal pain something else assessments, come positive.‚Äù*

*When novel coronavirus first surfaced South Florida hospitals March, patients elderly medical conditions made vulnerable. Symptoms obvious: cough, fever, shortness breath. virus infected younger demographic taken stealth nature Florida continuing remain highly transmissible.*

*‚ÄúWe two patients week appendicitis turned positive,‚Äù said Dr. Margaret Gorensek, infectious disease specialist Holy Cross Hospital Fort Lauderdale. ‚ÄúWe took appropriate precaution surgery, went COVID floor.‚Äù*

Perfect. mutating disguise itself. I've following website yet really shown big uptick hospitalizations.  But, sure seems like lots new cases lead lots new hospitalizations. I'm assuming lag. I‚Äôd argue don‚Äôt know true not. get it. people whose \*whole\* job responsible well citizenry. science masks helping mitigate spread. Yes know politics, yes. come on. love. would not, no. Nah I'd say we're end first quarter No, saying coming appendicitis simply COVID19. new symptoms. Regular sickness stop. ppl hospital COVID19, COVID19. It‚Äôs showing pervasive general population. funniest (saddest) part they're dumb selfish completely incapable recognizing someone else ""other"" them, ""other"" person.

So...yeah...even masks protected ""other"" people...guess what...if everyone wears mask, ""other"" protected. 

And even think everyone wear mask...they'll go around shaming attacking others wearing masks. Pure ignorant tribalism.

Even animals like cats dogs capable recognizing work together achieve common goal like opening door escape. I‚Äôm defensive Reddit‚Äôs constant spreading cherry picked data make United States seem like hell-hole compared glorious utopia Europe. Clearly find tons stats make Europe also seem like hellhole, don‚Äôt it‚Äôs helpful. sub many others, every highly upvoted content biased, blantantly misleading, spreading ignorance. people eat without examination nuance. every right defensive saddened stupid Reddit is. Maybe everyone required wear one? I‚Äôd don‚Äôt you‚Äôll get ticket fine? think that‚Äôs reasonable. first tennis player tested virus. Pray okay. fully functional? write bunch rambling nonsense nothing anything said. said one thing: capable understanding sentence wrote? US kind left care homes themselves, extremely shameful government give two craps young people, let alone old folks. grandma grandpa locked home since April, pretty stressful high risk zone now. pray well seniors around world. Fuck chart can't possibly true, since Europe cases us point chart daily cases higher us. Thank God Forza Italia. Jesus websites keep getting worse viewing?! 1000 case outbreak Germany? According CDC, masks don‚Äôt really make difference. science, according CDC, says surgical masks won‚Äôt stop wearer inhaling small airborne particles, cause infection. masks form snug seal around face. CDC recommends surgical masks people already show symptoms coronavirus must go outside, since wearing mask help prevent spreading virus protecting others nearby cough sneeze. agency also recommends masks caregivers people infected Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Illinois ton protests percentage kicking ass. NJ percentage dropped lot *believe* beaches open.

Of course people groups making things worse general think they‚Äôre blown proportion bit.

Nursing homes took absolute brunt virus. Obviously death rate comes largely due occupies also goes show nasty thing spreads indoors.

Since restrictions eased me, I‚Äôve seen maybe 2 / 30 people wearing mask inside apartment complex. companies opened doors 100s people masks optional. That‚Äôs much terrifying people outdoors generally taking precautions. 

But yeah general don‚Äôt really still, hate see people blindly blame one piece large complex puzzle. Agreed. fine campaign stronger worker protections almost offensive pretend anything like suffering inflicted actually enslaved people, past present.

Keeping covid campus one thing, trying protect students impossibility.

But people going work you, science come! fair, everywhere ramped testing (and therefore found cases) caused utter hysteria sub. ""Look flowers, Donald"" free protesting would nervous get test peace mind History look kindly lot years. Human nature pretty messed catastrophe brings worst people.

Thanks lot. Sooner later wrong person trying safe going lose someone, they‚Äôre going snap gloating, selfish assholes. compare tests done state? Currently argument florida spiking michigan isnt. kind nailed explanation. Well prepared next millennium lupus cases.  Coincidentally, pneumonia deaths 400-500% states. Odd... America sham.

Covering death cases. cheats way office November.... practically false positives, false negatives. Overall testing 80% accurate. 20% testing negative actually positive. Maybe even 2022 assuming vaccine come play dumb American I‚Äôm embarrassed. friends Japan skype every weekend. Explaining Americans don‚Äôt want wear masks stay home. Man hope auto-generated. feel sorry anyone type Trump‚Äôs grade 2 English. Unfriending hard way huh? know want true, it‚Äôs something people suggest? Factor deaths didn‚Äôt occur due lock downs. Traffic accidents, murders etc. Deaths due covid even higher 97,300 time period isnt hard figure out. one says wanted keep testing rally. generally take kn95 mask/respirator leaving grocery store, careful touch front mask, ear loops. still wash hands getting home. people recovered lingering symptoms

There may lot 'lingering symptoms' think. Idiocracy instruction manual huge differences countries.

In South Africa Serbia total number deaths actually declined compared average.

In Japan Norway looked numbers know anything going on. We've climb La Crosse weeks now. ridiculous. can't encourage people save themselves, save one. sure odd sense humour... funny man. /s Hopefully help medical providers open counting issues happening elsewhere. Knowing real data essential localities manage citizens' rights know. Yes. essentially echoes [tested except 30% higher.

The original transfer (from animal bat) occur China. every time virus replicated there's chance virus copy RNA properly. happens time! enough time, diverge , giving rise many stains. There's tens different strains around world. there's major ones, asiatic one. That's original one spread around Asia, spread Europe. However late January, believed skinning lodges alps Europe, europe strain developed. strain higher natural R Asian version. spreads far quicker harder control. european strain main one Europe Americas.

I've disabled 19 years virus caught late teens (was perfectly fit, active healthy beforehand). horrible.  I've lost everything - career, friends, ability start family, social life, independence - story uncommon. hope starts raise awareness gets funding treatment people post-viral syndromes completely life destroying swept rug decades. rural area live, absolutely one wears mask outside. Literally one. Inside, may 50 percent best, I'm certain go inside many places because, well, people wear masks. mutations, odds mutates something doesn‚Äôt anything dies Sounds like enough tbh. Travis County (Austin) increase 418 cases today, double previous high days before. places showing hints exponential growth... üß±üèóüè¢üè§ 30 something thousand today. Still saying this?

That's added 3k deaths count today. sure countries Chile 0 excess death Peru 14k Ecuador 16K excess according BBC. also says banning travel China saved millions lives. Also little flu. Funny exact opposite 2 months ago New Yorkers fleeing Florida. Lol fuck Masks mandatory pretty much everywhere here. want go kind store, ride NJ Transit, etc. wearing mask refused service asked leave. you‚Äôre business owner fined and/or prosecuted violating mask laws ordinances. Gov. Murphy attorney general serious shut places mask violations. seems wrong? Giving weight least credible responses? amplified variance estimate Compared NYC big cities, sure Except people North go South. Thats Florida check points make sure one coming New York couple months back. 

People selfish matter walk life come from. don‚Äôt understand trying say? Well kinda deep nose test done early Feb said flu time. Also I'm living someone flu corona idk hell get it, still mind-blown that. like everyone got virus going around late January/early February think may Corona cuz timing. doctors saying, ""Yeah crazy everyone got sick last week two, we've people coming kinds stuff packed, really weird shit"" worried too. know someone driving solo 90% time, leave mask I‚Äôm running errands. It‚Äôs uncomfortable it‚Äôs one less thing fuss with. I‚Äôm driving places 5-10min could car isn‚Äôt worth it. Also let‚Äôs sanitize hands get back car shopping second time I‚Äôm going leave car wanna put mask again. People hate hideous appearance, hate respect yourself. Whilst working close protection President, ever thought slightest bit danger we'd heard car backfire, idiot rushed cordon, would shout ""Down Mr President!"" Nowadays say ""Donald duck."" So...? takes time cases start increasing enough there's noticeable uptick deaths.

We could helped one better listened CDC, WHO, experts shut sooner, harder, necessary, longer.

We could continue better enforced social distancing better masks more.

We could better PRESIDENT ROLE MODELED PEOPLE DO. 

He failed us. failed us happened. reads little odd. Total cases period 1161. Active cases 7.

Probable cases make rest. fucked. side wearing masks trying go life safely can‚Äôt accomplish unsafe side.

mass protests fucking safe cunt  Ol' china strategy. good percentage East Cobb probably friend relative actually works CDC, mention front lines medical workers sure Hell confirm virus. doesn't. invalid criticisms simply diminish credibility critic (as should). Better honest accurate it: Trump seemingly makes light hundreds thousands COVID deaths joking slowing testing Slaughter houses remained open, opening country literally nothing it. legs swelled well.

I‚Äôm commenting else be. 

I‚Äôm voter. Rooting change. Expecting nothing I‚Äôm numb. get here. even fucking anymore? good read. fortwaltonbleach pretty much hit major points would said, including mask usage one.

To honest... mask usage first back February. May end, Mom died CoVid rehab center sent dad home with, saw new studies said ""Mask usage cuts transmission 90%!"" came side ""Yeah... requiring masks reasonable new data!"" subs get popular, need bring new mods.

Most people apply going alt right trying force narratives. Arizona heading straight boulevard full blown NYC March levels death infection idiot opposed masks? WTF  Can‚Äôt gloat never see post crying beloved mom dad got infected? friends wouldn‚Äôt able say, ‚Äúbut thought like flu, think maybe gave wearing mask? bet did.‚Äù

I know it‚Äôs shitty point look forward see results willful defiance. six days go. design #A White House official later said president ""obviously kidding"".

BBC News - Donald Trump: Tulsa rally fails draw expected crowds amid virus He‚Äôs going surpass Polpot. Shit, hope makes it. They'll pass pneumonia related deaths  Sounds like presymptomatic. Small important difference wearing masks quarantining TYRANNY work front desk cancer clinic, boss tested positive covid. got exposed Saturday last weekend, interacted two days realized fever left wednesday. saying worry getting tested unless I'm showing symptoms, even safe? masking policy clinic know I've gone back talk office wearing mask. I'm close personal patients, interact every single patient comes check in/out. I'm less concerned contracting personal level, concerned spreading patients. 

So far, there's motion close clinic. I'm medical professional think argue professionals saying, even right play? feel like need close get staff tested reopen again. feelings warranted, overreacting? Lie sweeping dirt rug. crazy! think genuinely hard time separating ""bad everyone"" ""bad me"" mind. ""retirement"" mean speedy trial jury peers hopefully finds guilty sees sentenced spend rest miserable life prison prostituting country family's gain . . . 


Then hell yeah let's get guy retired! wish would meet ""the 10 year old sniffles"". It‚Äôs shame weren‚Äôt able start side business due COVID. least CARES act help offset lost potential income. Your'e disgrace. wow... people compliment literal murderers killed millions trump ""killed"" hate him... absolutely pathetic Sadly, no. come 22 countries without proof they're carrying it:  Deaths counted covid person isnt tested they're still alive, brainlet. waste time money corpse. Lol area actually triggered got told do. Cuck time, flu season people, get Holy fucking shit hilarious Poe's Law strikes made mandatory, county refuses enforce it. *cough* Tehama County.

Lots covid idiots refuse wear one ""muh rights."" kinda sounds like war drugs. kept going decades. think he‚Äôs trying (and colossal failing) say recent upticks cases COVID due increase testing rather increase actual cases. IE pandemic isn‚Äôt getting worse we‚Äôre testing more.

Which, may testing more, 

A) testing doesn‚Äôt encompass recent cases use hospitalizations ICU beds metric going too

B) saying stop testing makes look bad, even looking bad illegitimate, makes look even worse ""The reports 17 year old died CHINA virus FAKE NEWS! person ANTIFA THUG killed embarrass great governor Florida(who tremendous job) myself. SAD far far-left THUGS go damage me! ramp fault walked awkwardly! #FAKENEWS #ANTIFATHUGS #MAGA #RAMPSFAULT"" Oh God can't stop laughing TIL: Women aren‚Äôt actually pregnant take pregnancy test. Devil's advocate here: dropped becoming POTUS said people get vaccines. colossal anti-vaxxer one point well documented, dropped big way.

THESE HARDENED CRIMINALS JOHNSON, TODAY REEFER, TONIGHT IT'D MURDER. Outliers sad still outliers. contact tracing? fuck kinda dystopian shit that? trouble walking ramp West Point?  That‚Äôs China flu. Literally don‚Äôt test don‚Äôt report cases, zero new cases makes better. scary think thought process powerful person world. Depends hard shut down. Nyc took 2 months lot people following guidelines well Cancer = Cured -8 GDP nothing... believe financial crisis -3 -4 percent. sure better numbers regard. last heard fairing bad countries, seems bad thought. better grasp damage next month numbers come April may. 

Looking it, seems like staying open good decision them. harder time economy heavily based trade. since everyone else shutdown, affected anything. corona politicised India too? Incorrect. number 3million deaths. 1% population. enough every1 know someone died. guess takes ""muh freedom"" crowd believe science.

You think point?

Was slurring metaphor failed kenysian economics? Trump literally 3 year old, mentality ""What cant see doenst exist"". seems like everything needs explicitly said nowadays, 120,000+ Americans died. something joke about. retarded joke. joke believes based truth. genuinely believes high number cases due number tests. lack nation-wide measures mitigate spread, they're testing countries. genuinely believes true. That's indefensible. 
 
For stupid people there, cases unconfirmed, mean exist. disgusting believes this. Bolt move assume able write something without mouth open slightly, licking lis lips... parents weren‚Äôt would left elected. he's joking, what's punchline, though? slowed testing, know avoid kid sniffles, who'd go infect others, people would die? Yup, man ever read speech teleprompter attack anyone hour keep airing personal grievances day ""Liberal"" main stream media would given pass past (massive) failures character applauded growing job.

How many times try say ""today Trump became president"".

Yea, fucking deaths lag brick.  building math models, take account everyone gets tested, whether asymptomatic stay home symptoms gone, rely ratio positive/negative tests make estimations many people actually it. sheer number positive cases particularly useful number scales relative factors like aggressive testing is. think that's point was.

And reason look kindly upon them. telltale covid symptoms, especially 99 F fever. 
Alright, asked. know I'm probably minority opinion here, atheist almost twenty years virus. traumatic event turned spiritual story. I've massive fatal heart attack landed hospital heart surgery four blocks. shake atheism. type materialist core, in, absolutely refused consider anything outside natural world remotely possible. raised Christian got away teen years explore philosophy. 
Once virus symptoms really set in, would consider second wave symptoms, escape conclusion judgement. Red painful hands feet reminded crucifixion. Burning heat would flash across skin, fever within surface. would smell smoke there, even coming mouth like inside me. feeling dread much lay sick like possibly going die led wife feeble prayer salvation. next night experienced, would consider hazy, half asleep type fever dream state, appearance two demonic entities room, along wife reporting similarly demonic experience dragged called another realm. dream well tar like substance stuck lungs prohibiting breathing family mocked me. wife missionary Africa two years experienced would call exorcisms possessions, dismissed earlier relationship nonsense, subsequently led disbelief well.
Well, I've changed mind now. even, nights ago dream gave temptation sin, find confronting terrifying thing literally ever experienced, awoke terrified, calling Jesus. 
Some people know would call crazy, that's fine, there's going would even considered four months ago possible. History care. ""1 100""* drops death this. 

*People drop death hospital overfilled included, long time damage.

Sadly country (austria) also went back normal, sure 1k cases 1million skyrocket soon again. Nobody fucking cares, money money money. There‚Äôs still hope, remember falcons 25 point lead Super Bowl patriots third quarter, realistically US pull comeback vaccine ready November...

Or Man. Fauci must thought convincing efforts testing social distancing total vain now. Here's hoping get encore. Anyone acting like unnecessary lol company fulfills contractual obligation provide 4 million tubes, receive total $10.16 million. 

The tubes 3 cents alibaba. Someone turned $120k $10M. 

 Yet everyone wore masks, things wouldn‚Äôt great, would least become worst. might still get worse generally, masks wouldn‚Äôt stop 100% everywhere, least could buy communities time vaccine hits. 

The virus running unchecked throughout workplaces economic damage lockdowns ever did. Welcome America. Johnson always known lightening mood situation room Nam zingers. TURN POOP WINE! TURN POOP WINE! Judging whats happening seems like government people dont care all. caught guard several hundreds thousands die anything happens. Depends whether oil not..

He‚Äôs got sniffles. He‚Äôll recover 15 minutes. That‚Äôs case, add it. That‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs case.""* 

Yeah context fucking hilarious.
No wait, bad fucking delusional nonsense dangerously unhinged nonsense. Covid19 susceptible gas lighting November USA see death tolls make current 122,000 dead seem small comparison, Trump thinks science, masks medical personnel trying make look bad. they??? maths wrong though. 

If assume fatality rate 0.2% given current US death toll 121,980, would equate 61,000,000 confirmed cases, almost 1 5 people USA virus.

Assuming 0.5% makes maths little better giving 24,400,000 confirmed cases.

Either way 10x -30x higher current cases. would shown testing numbers way off....

Assuming New Yorkers 100% infected lowest mortality rate get 0.37%. half infect rate jumps 0.74%, 20% infected rate jumps 1.85%.... 

If want better estimate mortality rate I'd look countries done really good job testing controlling virus, like Japan (5%) , South Korea (2.2%), New Zealand (1.45%) Australia (1.3%)

All countries listed never overwhelmed great health care. rethink mortality rate. Thank sharing site. helpful data worldometers doesn't. bookmarked it. really think through, huh. determined pull ""Gotcha, libtards!"" 

Just showing us great example divided are.

At least r/politics ban opposing opinions, unlike r/conservative. course theres info yet, long main point highlighted.

I way qualified give information complex topics new covid-19 therapies research lot learn. 

However, give insight Acetazolamide used prevent altitude sickness. 

When high altitude situation body compensates breathing faster, (hyperventilation). good bringing oxygen lungs also spells CO2 body. causes something called respiratory alkalosis blood pH rises becomes basic. turn causes body's chemoreceptors sense bad thing going stop breathing fast. 

A natural fix body expel bicarbonate kidneys compensate rise pH called metabolic compensation, take days achieve. 

**Acetazolamide** works increasing bicarb secretion kidneys help compensation. turn stop receptors acting keep breathing increased allowing body take oxygen reduces symptoms high altitude illness.

Remember happened koolaid Jones Town. don‚Äôt know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è stupid talk. dangerous. wait till start carpet testing people rural areas virus less likely already spread fiddle numbers lower positivity rate states open people return work, companies looking guidance keep workers safe infection. experts suggest looking may seem unlikely model: adult film industry. survived different pandemic ‚Äî outbreak H.I.V. infections late 1990s almost shuttered multibillion-dollar industry.

‚ÄúWe actually learn lot safety guidelines listening producers porn,‚Äù said Perry N. Halkitis, dean School Public Health Rutgers University. ‚ÄúThinking back H.I.V./AIDS crisis, adult film industry learn keep workers safe.‚Äù

He recommends following lead using calls Four Ts: Target, Test, Treat Trace. adult film industry uses nationwide program called PASS, Performer Availability Screening Services, requires performers tested every 14 days H.I.V. sexually transmitted infections order cleared work. worker tests positive, he‚Äôs treated, partners traced.

‚ÄúWe get information coming porn industry,‚Äù said Dr. Ashish Jha, director Harvard Global Health Institute. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre trying get economy back, major component building confidence engage regular activities going restaurant, getting plane, going back work.‚Äù

The suggestion using adult film industry model reported Stat News May. course, incubation period coronavirus means it‚Äôs possible people could negative test results indicating it‚Äôs safe travel contagious time get plane.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs foolproof,‚Äù Dr. Jha said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going see testing make decisions lives.‚Äù

The adult film industry, largely shut since March 15, released guidelines get back work. Mike Stabile, communications director Free Speech Coalition, adult entertainment trade association, meeting others industry Zoom twice week discuss proceed get greenlighted open back up. consult medical professionals regularly.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve looked coronavirus testing, temperature checks, wearing masks sets filming, couples live together work together,‚Äù said. coalition created web page Covid-19 resources adult film industry.

For H.I.V. tests, Mr. Stabile said, ‚Äúwe use highly sensitive PCR-RNA test, detect virus within seven 10 days infection.‚Äù said frequent testing ‚Äúand controls used performers, sex outside tested performer pool using condoms so, minimizes risk H.I.V.‚Äù

But Covid-19 transmitted droplets via coughing even breathing, rather sex, said, ‚Äúthere million exposures work set come contact testing positive? Everyone‚Äôs happy comply testing one wants work set get infected.‚Äù

If infection occur, production would shut down. Everyone set ‚Äî infected tested negative ‚Äî would work. people adult film industry independent contractors; they‚Äôre working, they‚Äôre getting paid, incentive keep working high.

Back 1998, H.I.V. outbreak adult film industry. Marc Wallice, adult film actor, falsified H.I.V. test certificate infected handful actresses. H.I.V. tests, time, printed paper could easily forged.

Sharon Mitchell, former actress doctorate human sexuality training taking blood samples, formed Adult Industry Medical health care foundation year, formalizing protocols would eventually become PASS.

‚ÄúWhile acronyms organizations changed, testing improved, general principles same,‚Äù Mr. Stabile said.

The system brought major shutdown 2004 two shorter ones 2013.

‚ÄúI perform sets PASS system place,‚Äù said Maitland Ward, adult film star three Adult Video News Oscars former star sitcom ‚ÄúBoy Meets World.‚Äù ‚ÄúProfessional porn follows strict guidelines regular basis,‚Äù Ms. Ward said. production resumes, addition coronavirus testing, ‚Äúextra precautions place sets, temperature checks social distancing among crew members,‚Äù said.

‚ÄúHealth screenings norm us. think adult industry far prepared mainstream‚Äù film sets businesses. ‚ÄúThis one thing need cautious vigilant about. Honestly, think mainstream looking adult industry handles standard-bearer comes health safety sets.‚Äù

Dr. Jha agreed. said would like see database much like PASS program people register online show tested coronavirus. ‚ÄúIt run nonprofit private business, government,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm opposed government it. It‚Äôs lot people would comfortable government running it.‚Äù

In adult film industry, people get tested get negative result, get green check next names. test positive don‚Äôt take test, get red X. That's spirit! know, ""as long they're seated"" mask required.

Fortunately news supporters finally figure much dumbass lol Jonestown slow motion Trump point, America able get office, deserve everything freedom experiencing. wellllllllll small place. 2/75 Ranger there, popular bike rack company puts massive stickers products, tons great hiking/cycling great historic name. exposure suppose.  whole country watching Victoria closely state daily (and growing) community transmission.

This critical Australia also reason state borders remain closed. 

On plus side Victoria massive testing program team contact tracers 1000 strong.

As country really need succeed. watched part speech kept thinking ""why fuck would people voluntarily watch bull shit?""

It boggles mind. This.... THIS!!?!?!? entertainment someone. What! meowing fluff! seriousness. nice seeing supporters stupid enough go rally. know better. know better. sad part people go look like walking pre-existing condition. It‚Äôs Yes, people world. person supported segment society. probably thousands millions infected seeing...cool cool cool cool. really hard time walking. Tonight daughter came home friends house told us ""the coronavirus lie."" 2 months ago, ran leave leave job. haphazard things say news getting heads kids. video saw looked like limited capacity tables least 6 feet apart. Definitely masks though. Unfortunately. Sounds like toddler 'hiding' closing eyes covering hands Guys...I mean...Jesus Christ. guy shitty person. doesn‚Äôt make better. hate much you, obviously sarcastic here. Suggesting otherwise diminishes legit criticisms (of many) u/undeleteparent  think we're already cases caught and/or written ""natural causes"". course can't find source recall seeing natural causes comparison previous years tens thousands higher average. also possible since added COVID deaths saw least month ago. Bruh, add part FOUR:

""Oh, got anotha one ova here!"" retarded accent. ""There's 10 year old kid, he's got sniffles. HES ANOTHER CASE! Calm down, he's gonna fine fifteen minutes.""

It's like understand infection covid infection. infection harms someone. GOT FUCKING KIDDING  Make Rome Great Again! USA actually fucked lmao whole statement perfectly clear...context not. wants tests slow high number cases looks bad.  Watch bilateral visa agreements burn. watched entire clip said line, context hear idiotic statement. stats reports changes fatality rates, eg using change point detection ? doctors better prepared prevent death covid 19? We‚Äôll know weeks since usually lag infection possible fatality. That's Buffoon Chief. lol stupid WAY THATS IMPOSSIBLE CASES COMPREHENSIVE TESTING

I swear fucking God can't wait guy office. grew calling snotsdale wife laughs watching it, ancient world fascinating like Puma Punku Nasca lines. could've guess? words censored (ironically word censorship well lol). $1100 crazy. buy facility Texas going rate $100-150. Doesn‚Äôt stop half America thinking thanksgiving legitimate holiday peaceful dinner Europeans native Americans actually say that?! seriously doubt that. mean look George W Bush. Reddit basically deep throating guy 9/11 anniversary. protested psychopath. Yes bad China stopped updating cases Get fool office! textbook case abusers behave relationships usually end spouse abuser dead.

They'll never admit anything said, either joke, lying. Except deaths decreasing. Today‚Äôs weekly average 636 lowest since March 31st. weekly average consistently decreasing nearly two months. I'm wondering long term implications be, might one events discussed entire century done probably guys probably dead. I'm curious history books movies going showcase end born whole pandemic. guys think worse 1918 pandemic maybe perhaps worse political divide US least... America.... Jesus fucking christ mean COME FUCK SAKE Right? day said, stopped testing fewer cases, could argued talking confirmed cases, numbers high Bc we‚Äôre testing. It‚Äôs kind dumb make point, even it‚Äôs making excuses inexcusably high numbers.

But this? Next, going ask people stop dying coronavirus. well! Yeah, full virus. don‚Äôt know yet.
Great idea spread regions.  letting many people back country. read German media, already got it: dry cold air, workers standing closer, many workers abroad staying premises sharing small apartments (one proposal worker would need room, slaughterhouses refused), little possibility sick leave. video outdated point I‚Äôm removing post. they're attractive middle road voters acknowledging potentially context. instead looking context, trying invent context head see agree come with.

I save step: piece piece transcript rally.

Spoiler, context make better. instead making assumptions, make informed voter. take much effort. Trump: can‚Äôt cases there‚Äôs testing rally goers lambasted, counter-protesters praised?

To think 72 cases traced anti-lockdown protests, social distancing wearing masks like Tulsa. point let states reopened pretend there's issue. pretty sickening literally. Wow. Even animals better reasoning guess. Texas deaths start hi 2-3 weeks. Death slow lagging indicator covid. hope I‚Äôm wrong. certainly treatments now. Welp guy obviously give shit ""friend"". friend's kid ventilator he's trying extra hard ""sell it"". Ugh. deaths triple current levels, realize make lockdowns deadlier reopening, right?

Lockdowns us 2k dying per day. 1k per day 3 weeks now.

If deaths triple, reopening lockdown wash deaths, deaths need triple even start discuss number lives saved worth destruction caused lockdowns.

There's situation lockdowns come ahead point barring nursing home mismanagement Cuomo/Murphy level incompetence. That's unlikely. anyone talking Japan's version drug?? could massive treating virus. East Cobb tends educated R‚Äôs vote R tax business reasons. hold noses R social agenda aren‚Äôt stupid. would listen (I hope) CDC politicians health. Regardless, point deaths infections. 

My whole point despite shutting down, economy suffered much places shut down. matter shutdown not. economy suffer continue to. Can't blame - 1 900 people active Covid SF, plus risk catching walking outside negligible, doctors said New England Journal Medicine: health authorities define significant exposure Covid-19 face-to-face contact within 6 feet patient symptomatic Covid-19 sustained least minutes (and say 10 minutes even 30 minutes). chance catching Covid-19 passing interaction public space therefore minimal. many cases, desire widespread masking reflexive reaction anxiety pandemic.  actually feel sorry Americans fear dear long god Modi there

Bolo Modi Baghawan ki jai! proponents new lockdown fanatics.

I'd like bring goal post back please. definitely scary timeline live in. feels like never ending episode Black Mirror. Maybe doesnt care?

I couple sure dont. hear theyre posting stupid hoax shit internet Boomer Remover gets less disinformation world.

Personal responsibility, member? Freedom matter dead. sure, compare Obama actively deployed teams around world stop outbreaks ebola, local testing education chasing every thread could, even called worst president ever Fox Trump cases reached US soil quickly handled. Meanwhile Trump firing pandemic response teams, firing initial team went Obama transition pandemic training, calling hoax. he's demanding less testing cover up. Oceania always war Eurasia. good way take quote context, like he's talking paternity tests finding kids hookers. saturated bullshit hard stay angry time. horrifies think things won‚Äôt admit to. context. Trump campaign White House said joking.  considered high crime misdemeanor? admitted said ""slow testing down, please."" words, admitted knowingly endangering American lives. Would considered form indirect manslaughter? I'm legal expert, alone seems like impeachable offense. wins second term, impeach (among things). smart. can't see it, there. (Can't believe place better safe sorry) /s  UPSes beep power outage. power outage good reason beep audibly. stop forest fires? Get rid forests. odd indeed He's trying solve pandemic. He's trying protect stock market. show numbers say infection rate low, market panic, cronies lose money. give single solitary fuck live die. know, tried watch Trump‚Äôs rally tonight. quit said this. I‚Äôve seen clip. I‚Äôm going nightmares sleep. Guaranteed. heartless stupid? He‚Äôs Fauci (I love Fauci) giving science lessons months, yet uttering absolute rubbish. 

I can‚Äôt imagine must feel people lost loved listen ridicule minimize covid. mention fact kids getting Kawasaki-like syndrome dying.
Not mention people without masks sitting close together forced exhalations (yelling) inside building extended duration. 

Grrrrrrr. president cracking jokes even nobody dead USA warrants condemnation. stand comedian. job presidential. even USA unaffected, still global pandemic. Previous presidents expected maintain certain level decorum times. Even world A-OK, behaviour be. Trump shit people's standards bare minimum slipped remarkably even he's still failing Griffin provides clinical update COVID-19, including analysis dexamethasone trial, discuss two Ebolavirus outbreaks DRC, clinical virological aspects asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, age-dependent effects transmission, answer listener email.  apologies. \*swishes cape walks away\*  could actually socially distanced made arena look full so. lol one hand it‚Äôs believable another everything going might well another shitty journo piece stretches things unbelievable extent make sense want to. can‚Äôt even imagine November gets re-elected. think it‚Äôll fire brimstone does. can‚Äôt imagine anything else Lmao tf went got u/DrAnthonyFauci post r/Coronavirus Yeah let's undo lifetime carelessness lack critical thinking joke, unless outraged - joke calm down. 
 
I feel like America whole needs get kind support group / counseling people abused narcissists. literally impossible country 100 crore population handle pandemic easily lmao get too, scam. I'm guessing Waco McAllen, unless Amarillo Midland issued mask order missed. Waco 7 ICU beds now, cases relatively low (compared big four cities). Michael Spicer needs Next Door one. Conservatives state loving it. know next fucking nothing pandemic, think Douchey fucking savior. friend mine told one coworkers died 30. far knows seemed healthy know risk factors. Bless case tragic, whether 8 80 year old. live era someone would near impossibility. Shit, probably list saying that. gobsmacked. Remdesivir Damn. thought worst Duterte. slow testing. that, politicians rich people priority.  Well everyone around tested immediately wear masks except People cheering. Wow. Seattleite here... place apples come live tv, like understand bringing back room talks, throwing ideas there. spitballing press conference? Fuck. vast majority people wearing masks (I‚Äôm talking 99.9%, least am) makes huge difference. long article, uses thing called science refute you‚Äôre implying numbers shmumbers video want

we always, *always* want, thank you. ‚ÄúWhy still here, suffer?‚Äù know post dumb quote said mass gathering, right? Well, even small country (5 million people) forbade testing people unless serious suspicion contracted coronavirus looong time ago. Can't imagine much strain healthcare system testing everyone country big US would put.. Wait, trying say lockdowns causing higher death rates? know death rates high lockdown due people got sick lockdown right? declined lockdown yeah? best part people still care. Everyone Quarantine tested hence new cases last couple days

Plus people arriving citizens permanent residents every right come home. already would come right said it. See nothing. everyone comes vicinity tested wear masks except him. already germaphobe this. feeling may claim already anyway later like claiming take hydroxychloroquine  know couple folks basically never stopped stuff can't believe I'm reading here. complete cunting moron devil's advocate, day age... *why*? K. Fuck fuck NFL. Anyone text article? know, Arizona, Texas South Carolina significant protests? biggest protests north east we're seeing spikes yet. think Brazilian president gets ideas from? Trump Administration successful terrorist attack ever committed United States, beating every terrorist attack combined every American casualty WW1. Following long standing Presidential tradition joking national tragedies. know, like Bush zingers 9/11, FDR's classic comedy routine Pearl Harbor. wont too. slide easily unfortunately. doesnt want supporters afraid virus still vote, working. black guy got office got Donnie's racist panties bind. look you, pandering masses manipulating vote. They're going real happy figure done one going shed year decent little golf course. No, outlier, article fear-mongering headline subreddit eats up. 

17 year olds virtually risk COVID-19, sad was. Sounds like perfect time reopen! Well, mean, could well true.

Doesn't explain hand shaking like crazy grabbed glass hand. this, genuinely believed 80-90% general population understood basic germ theory. 
 
I think probably closer 60-70%, not-insignificant portion people *just learned it*. It‚Äôs food per se. It‚Äôs chilled environment, combined moist surfaces high densities infected people around it.

Turns freezers keep meat fresh. It‚Äôs also county. wa inferring fact probably family China sort knew bad thing instead idiocy protected themselves. Deaths won‚Äôt go much we‚Äôre ahead testing point go snap map, visit Oakland, LA, Vegas. 

lots young people, masks. distancing. What's punchline? know someone covid march. declared cured still looks sick tired doctors can't pinpoint why. remember active infected. something definitely off. virus behaves unpredictable ways. careful. paywalls. dont disagree would much better off. point thst disagree would crisis. Instead one worst 3 countries would maybe one worst 20. huge improvement. makeup country inability effective contact tracing (which dont think president could implement country due peoples obsession privacy bothered strangers asking questions) would always left country issues. much much less  Christian you. joke joke doubt Brazil 30,000 new cases day, dark orange. It‚Äôs Donald Trump, stared right eclipse. Idiocracy Salonndot com article. Delete yep, fuck it, dont care. Anyone says Biden creepy ignoring trumps disgusting persona fucking lunch. problem Biden anyways? smelled girls hair shit? sounds worse Pizzagate Marsgate COMBINED. first half. wrong too. what? ""And know me... trail dead.""  point, speaking jibberish. like warm speaker rally today. said cure chinese virus (yes still calling that) call rally protest instead. even know came idea, big joke. agree you, masks vital Cool joke people dying something could controlled lot effectively! funny! reopened way soon closing again. People arent gonna listen twice, especially people barely listened first time day use hands drink water. No, Trump directly. sure take earned downvoted voted correct, protests endanger lives families across nation unnecessarily. nation going hang Trump bridge? Korea Japan argued way back March. Japan says, less corona virus cases Korea. Korea says test virus cases. It‚Äôs giant pissing contest world leaders Making every possible attempt shift blame. historic low. ""It must JOKE IDIOTS makes DADDY look BAD, unless think makes daddy look GOOD case MEANT JESUS christ INCARNATE."" Oh you‚Äôre right! forgot fact cares economy human lives. time live leaders think way üòê Solid one, totally fits Dotards mindset. literally stupidest President time, country, possibly biggest imbecile homosapiens. Bigly cafeve estupido really bad timing telling truth. Keep fear mongering tho, one 17 year old dying news posted. I've seen people discuss tracing strains outbreak Beijing. expert epidemiology myself, I'd like someone knowledgeable tell contradicts research done institutions. Yeah, probably was. probably heard one scientists talking parroted him. think knows much science would remarkable dumb luck managed nail math perfectly. see laughing? realize 120k dead due incompetence funny. said seriously like way says dumb shit says. He's fucking stupid. Can't poor look balance bank account! fuck people support blabbering idiot. Yeah, oppressive regime kind works shut country fuck down. 

They also lie lot. 33k yesterday 32k today. Well comes first wave. think point we're null-world country. BJJ = Big Johnson Jerking



I looked know describe feeling UK government fucking loser delusions grandeur.

I'm embarrassed ridiculousness would amusing many people died incompetence. actual point sarcasm. behind sarcasm point. Please explain point was. Honestly, point I'm surprised anything Complete utter breakdown institutions. That's how. America disintegrating. argue anything know change mind, matter facts dunno man. grandparents died relatively young (50s/60s) maybe parents kind jaded? They're also Christian believe time, time. kind get. Lord knows they'd upset happen die COVID 20s. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Since Trump got elected I've addicted seeing people defend stupidest shit. 

A lot non-sequitur, like ""Hillary lost get it"", todays top response ""it obviously joke lol"", intellect need support Trump guess. 

Since the_donald got shut there's less circlejerk sort-by-controversial, guess becuase less resources collectively get today's talking points straight. No, said cannot afford testing. Also, I'm obviously referring top 10%, inferred comment. half comment said one country reporting 0 cases, obviously acknowledging countries confirmed cases (tests done.) Lady, here's video *you* standing 10 feet away said *your* via loudspeaker. 

""I trust press."" legal use position power manipulate statistics global pandemic? 
 
Everyone mad China allegedly lying/covering extent virus began guy goes live TV admitting messing number cases US nothing happens? ...yes, would. harden fuck up. 

if greatest sacrifice you‚Äôve ever make, consider lucky. Beat it. lot religious people vote based 'principles' like abortion homosexuality. care about. since Republicans 'God-fearing' 'people' share 'principles', religious vote them. Words fail went assuming every citizen infected yes, guess theres reason test, clown thinking lets stop testing body considered infected Death Winning Didn‚Äôt trump announce one person 18 died Florida speech today? seven day trend line AZ looks wrong. trend end?

Are using old data?

This past week 4 record daily highs, yesterday behind highest reported today second highest. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM *~Deep heart Texas~* That's exactly watching. empire disintegrating real time, WiFi. 

This Chernobyl moment.

The U.S. finished. question long plays out. can't even respond fucking pandemic. can't even agree happening. can't hold criminal responsible crimes.

This complete breakdown failure country. first press release May 5:

""The GDP indicator early compilation quarterly national accounts based limited preliminary statistics."" freedom protected health crisis? Asking friend.  can't see you, exist. - 1 year old. lots things possible reality I'm gonna surprised US' death count become higher ever he'll said ""this corona, diseases"" also forbids doctors test covid victim. Resulting zero covid 19 death. 

Brilliant. brilliant. 

#Trump2020 Def post-Madonna era  Sweden, go lockdown, suffered 15 times many deaths Norway, did. Sweden suffered, make mistake. Ah, finally US decides ""bring freedom"" long countries. heard anyone snapping cigarette companies loved one dies lung cancer, unlikely. Vietnam democratic case notice.  best got - George Carlin Idiot 20 new cases day local bar, hoowah! know sound crazy, friend, know mean best, appreciate it.I knew posting probably drops credibility some, honest experience. would laughed beginning March. rough time, feel worst wife dogs. seemed exhibit symptoms well, dull discoloration white part eye, flare ups symptoms, one even seizures. almost make seizure Friday. come clusters now. stopped breathing moment. Reddit admins need strike hard users wishing people get COVID19. Absolute sickening. awkward campaign lower numbers stop testing. people fall this? one check facts anymore? countries think dumb US is? comes time decide values ones worth risking life for. 

Our economy recover, things rebuilt, people chance prosper long alive so. people killed virus people killed police never chance prosper make lives better. cases gives us however slight chance save lives completely preventable deaths. 


As things hope make best decision possible based best information have. audience spent lifetime fearing tests got confused. makes think places would want you?

Love always thought future expat rather immigrant. Must American exceptionalism talking. Third world country iPhones.

How stupid misinformed country get frustrated too. pretty sad people understand something affects personally. guess best argument testing though faster economy open? 

That mentality old people conditions dying okay really gets most. Like everyone acting like parents grandparents? Yea, sarcastically. I'm numb idiocy spell think that's spell I'm going assume yes  pandemic Ba-Sing-Se Suns owner decides trade players picks cash. Fake news. must everyone else. honestly care future country, vote. costs nothing. Midsummer holiday friday. holiday longer solstice evening friday closest it. Thanks solid write up! Massholes Unite!! üòÇ wanted say fellow Masshole 120,000 people dead America split two. Let finish sentence you. 

Option #1: Supposed leader free world stupid understand science.

Option #2: Trump says asked coronavirus testing slowed many cases screwing last chance ""Hail Mary"" re-election called shooting innocent Americans innocent protestors tear gassed photo OP hate even for, got punked national T.V. campaign rally.""

My dog pissed learned spell treason.  say, ""Look much lower numbers are."" matter much higher actual numbers since showing paper. like politicians refuse resurface streets say, ""Look much money saved."" numbers they'll campaign based numbers. thing vote presidential election show person demographics voted. state overwhelmingly one sided vote matter except winner losing popular vote loser winning popular vote. Everyone says vote, really mean is, everyone swing states vote. know bad effects either, choosing live fear. Cool. I'm upstate near Vermont Canada, going anywhere near NYC get vaccine. Considering trump thinks tests equals Corona virus think say even understands basic math. Genuine question I'm US. traffic laws none criminal laws? mention contaminated. 

Was production facility polluted Sars 2?

Did accidentally pollute pure water ""sanity test""? Shit brains. Fucking shit brains. stupid person planet. Well, apart supporters. fucking stupid must be?!? daughter died misses her. actually emotions people. watch video seem like joking crowd though. hey, guess modern journalism. problem kind thing even twenty years ago remember seeing scientist tv programme saying think humans ever hug kiss associated risks; life normal. start asking scientists opinion we'll things like go concerts embrace others again, that's happening, opinions get skewed kind sentiments. kind sentiment looks cold mathematical facts rather real human experience.

Of course we'll go concerts meet people shake hands live life without worrying again. I'm drunk fuck think checks whole making sense deal Maybe, Bernie's candidate more. Let's can. supposed determine president United States saying sarcastic not? might obvious think kind thing decide he's joking not. That's really interesting experience, I'm glad shared even though sounds personal intense. I've share fever induced dreams feels like brain another dimension. Coupled exhaustion trauma current events potentially facing death, see could change perspective life. think good thing living deliberate, fulfilling way. found wishing would get worse could go hospital. family get sick (presumably, mom minor symptoms could've anything) felt isolated would doubt even ill. nurse told phone ""technically fever"" get tested help mentally. Anyways got dark headspace awhile. Sometimes best sit yo ass stay home. listen follow advice doctors scientists Lol ok. Care share source? fact idiotism widespread infuriating. \#proLife? Idk definitely watch it. National Anthem type shit, blackmail. ""If see, problem""

Just clown still president, EU country would jailed incompetence mention things... Thank you. believer tests well faith many places/materials used.

I friend lab business he's told total free shit show standards, supplies, especially getting reagent. oversight ton $ made rushing though things simple packing swab bag assembling testing kit. tend optimistic think hospitals larger businesses sourcing tests better quality control place knows. guess it‚Äôs ‚Äúover mind‚Äù people getting sick dying must fake. Please please help get out. Nothing else matters. Got love #1
U.S.A. U.S.A U. (Cough) S.A family used go state fair every year Although second wave starts September...oh well  ""HE'LL RECOVER 15 MINUTES.""

Who fuck gets cold (let alone Covid) *15 minutes*?? *stupid* guy? live Iowa. Literally one town cares. I'm one people still wearing mask go store. 

The pools county open Monday. going one giant covid stew. Didn‚Äôt say didn‚Äôt fuck up. politicians zero. excuse might flown said like twice before. bright side, Goldman Sachs predicting sweep WH, Congress Done bud ""They called me, said job doing... Here's thing...""

Who called him?? always ""they're saying"" ""they called me"". Fucking full shit. Luckily he‚Äôs expert epidemiologist great medical education. Oh wait, he‚Äôs fucking not! thing is, numbers become facts. that's lot people care about. So, number Coronavirus cases low, that's people believe.

It's kinda crazy back March, Trump said person wants get tested get tested. real test available. Now, he's said hold testing numbers going higher. contradict said March, he's actively trying get people stop getting tested. need learn read news bed Australia? saw whole speech. Particularly enjoyed right clip went ""little Timmy, sniffles, fine 15 minutes""

Guess forgot multisystem inflammatory kids already live rural area Canada. fuck surrounded goofs. people still dont even believe thing. finding new cases concerned bad thing?  There's nothing logical all. I'm glad ok. Watch family friends symptoms, guide experience need be.
I awful person this. personal belief deserve happened me, thankful worse. saying anyone gets covid deserves it, did. feel changed better. fact, made Reddit account effort try help people virus. way giving back life leading. arrogant, stuck gym rat looked obese people sympathy others. able workout since March due sick, hopefully may able lift weights soon. truly sorry used be, hope able help others now.. Maybe people believe less testing actually = good, it‚Äôs poor taste joke testing you‚Äôre president US many sick dead  guess so, places needed (US Brazil) gonna buy all, so... Anyone ever cries pro life crap support nonsense get bent Man, city? I‚Äôm chilliwack uptake closer 10%, that‚Äôs mostly older people.  clearly joking rest remarks. provided plenty context joking. remarked stupid people mild cases count case get tested. joke. maybe joking literally asked less testing. really matter, rest statements showed thinks less testing COVID bullshit. Eh mind. stopped wearing mask weeks ago issues. media really fear mongered nothingburger virus. could argue quote context;

Trump always, ALWAYS, worse context. don‚Äôt know NY ran beds not. know run places put dead body‚Äôs morgues run use freezer trucks store bodies... shut problems could prevented source saved whole world problem. fucked period.  sure did

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now what... sure data yet, additional lag cases initially discovered death. always assumption testing would lower mortality rate asymptomatic caeses.

Some theory's/assumptions people making 1) know treat cases better now. catch early provide therapeutics medications help prevent death. clear studies come year promising treatments everyday catching cases earlier months ago. Also virus may mutated less lethal version.

2) new cases younger age thus lower mortality rate. lockdown people strict. Bars restaurants opened younger people started go back out. Part states excuse cases predominantly younger people, meaning high case count impact terms death.

It still significant impact elder vunerable populations. Also address potential long term side effects virus even lower mortality. Watch video kindly fuck off. started crying this. fucked up. It‚Äôs disgusting. It‚Äôs fucking health crisis. can‚Äôt even right. 

How expect real movement equality can‚Äôt even deal virus doesn‚Äôt care political party fair, every country waged successful campaign virus used enormous amount testing contact tracing it.

Again, Sweden. Goodbye US guess. New York, New Jersey, Texas New Mexico confirmed can‚Äôt use Fillakit tubes. Three states told ProPublica received Fillakit supplies distributed testing sites. FEMA asked health officials several states find alternative use unfinished soda bottles. 
  still trying identify alternative use,‚Äù said Janelle Fleming, spokeswoman New Jersey Department Health. 
  owner Paul Wexler acknowledged tubes normally used soda bottles otherwise declined comment.

For 2020th time year, r/nottheonion overflowing Yeah 120k dead Americans fucking hilarious protest balance? Guess asked lol second wave first never end. No, easily, China size, seems fine now, despite current outbreak totaling 220 confirmed cases. They're anti-sex outside marriage, they're pro-sadism anyone *sinful things.* I'd bet bad testicle gold medal mental gymnastics rationalize exact shit condemn people for. never spend time around young kids. people fucking dumb. Trump means says fake news. It‚Äôs clearly sarcastic fucking comment. watched say it. context. could (and probably will) argue joking but, big but, spent next minutes minimizing pandemic.

He claimed 19 names it, people call flu ( implicitly stating worse flu)

He claimed virus really affect kids get sniffles 15 minutes 

He claimed schools need fully opened 

He claimed liberals blowing virus proportion vast conspiracy get people obey (specifically people supposed obey never clarified) orders

He claimed supporters refuse obey Yeah know he‚Äôs piece shit needs voted out. Still trying find upset downvoting facts. Angry internet mob attack! Counties dont unique names county 'xyz' could exist dozen states. rude nobody favors Random thought: teachers maga fans influencing children logic. 4 years (8?) Trump, deal trump aftermath affected education many facets life. Imagine president little regard public, joking 120k people dead ""no big thing"" worse still, sign ""winning"". intentional. want testing. would explain Virgin Mary.  
She never pregnancy test, therefore never pregnant!

 Truly, miraculous birth. felt really guilty too. sucked. internal struggle üò≠ coronavirus first started, realized Samsung health app phone ability measure stress level. also gives blood oxygenation level I've using check levels. super handy. different theory this. know massive death toll April May came mostly New York New Jersey let Covid get retirement homes caused high death toll. seeing Covid spreading general community more, infecting far young people thus cases way CFR significantly down. knows exactly he's doing. knows he's talking shit, knows followers dense pricks caters them. game literally guy interested himself. sicko But.. but.. invented zero. OK, India buy Chinese-made KN-95 masks, mean rest world? changed dollars. Lite. Literally elderly King Joffrey watch drive! 2020th time year, r/nottheonion overflowing again... drank two sips... literally threw rest glass water floor? neither say test less look better. Wait thought satire joke though? Oh he‚Äôs soooo tough too. threw water like real man.

Still ... hesitated got extended anus- like mouth. It‚Äôs like purse lips make sure cup hits target.  image, damage control blah blah people less explicit reasons call stupid lump super stupid people Sure secession done, illegal ""country"" promptly invaded made part union again, we've already seen movie before, much stronger actors. won‚Äôt happen tests privatized. much money COVID testing.
Republicans would never come big diagnostics bottom line. Trump dig grave.
Thank fucking god. hope doesn‚Äôt get re-elected. Holy shit. Trump literally retarded. here. When? serious? fucking stupid? Roflmao! When?........fucking Moron. don‚Äôt think understand going today. People like you, ones think opinion heard? Remember nicely nice Shiaaaaaaaat 2016 tried actually explain sway stupid fuckers like reality BunkerBoy actually was? TV dipshit racist barbaric fuck? days over. it‚Äôs wave fuck you. see plethora choices available keep head ass. longer care. right wanted war. It‚Äôs got one.
Fuck you. joke? 

He's 15 weeks late retail tests. everyone building sent get tested? Inb4 claims test causes virus   well... expert. friend happy ,hard working ,planning working another 15 years hit him. quite involved healthy hobby requiring lot hiking. hobbies intellectual physical aspects. Planning workinging toaward advancing hobbies interests. pain problem..having crawl around house times hardly able get bed cause pain. tried drugs.but lryica? spelling gave relief. went back interests hobbies immidiately still so, unless gets flare up. one experience makes think mainly physcial illness truly it.  ""It's pathetic Trump said reported Trump said."" 

You're cult mate. original peak cases April 10, peak deaths April 17 21. 


Texas Arizona record hospitalization rates.  


Florida 1072 new hospitalizations week 992 week before. despite cases getting younger Florida, signs increased hospitalization. strongly believe someone tries show protest without mask, told GTFO.

The thing is, activists Minneapolis telling people wear masks. Nobody condoning people showing unmasked. Understanding March April artificially inflated death rate. virus actually become less deadly.  tried quercetin? Yes, cytokine storm lungs antibodies over-reaction. erode lungs' tissue permanent damage limiting lung capacity 30% survivors. thought operating ago, thought death counts consistent now.

But even counting pneumonia, long consistently since start pandemic, think pattern still largely holds.

Random side note, saw maternal grandmother's little brothers death certificate 1920 ""pneumonia"", know actually died spanish flu. absolutely surreal see Depends suburb. Richmond probably 80-90, Langley probably less 10 Honestly curious incompetent important job world still employed, meanwhile get fired wendy's coming dollar short end night. Yes is! Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre biased. anything one side makes feel fuzzy, side thing, call arrested? think that‚Äôs bit crazy...like, real mental issues. fuck cares says. even know virus many people already infected. Passing covid symptom. asymptomatic doesnt mean immuned. never hit you, eventually lead symptoms lost hour watching Monty Python clips, thanks said it, plenty people arguing taken context saying growing number cases testing stating correlation removing testing would mean tests.

Again:
1. Trump says something dumb
2. conservatives leap defend saying meant
3. Trump doubles says exactly meant
4. Conservatives continue move goal posts change subject.

Is anywhere bet pattern next dumb thing Trump inevitably say? Would love pay mortgage. madness fit bill  cases less deaths good news. let anyone tell otherwise. testing we've asking since beginning. somehow everyone shocked would get cases. Chasing chubbies cluster.... Hopefully got big box. There‚Äôs intermission shit show. Technically state's responsibility. way legally that. Mild means die absent medical intervention. No, perfectly cromulent. social distancing buy time hospitals overwhelmed need bed.

That's one several reasons people locking social distancing. also giving companies time increase production availability PPE hand sanitizer, also giving scientists time learn new virus spreads, also giving doctors time develop treatments protocols improve outcomes patients catch it, also slowing limiting spread virus protect everyone including vulnerable. 

In beginning, primary fear overwhelming hospitals (something continues concern hotspots develop) often talked early days outbreak US. reasons still talked well, seeing exponential growth knew beginning healthcare system prepared pandemic important. 

Right we've managed reach point ICU beds ventilators meeting current needs PPE still widely lacking medical professionals essentially unavailable general public could still easily see hospitals get overwhelmed (keep close eye TX AZ seem asking it). 

Even assuming everyone planet catch virus eventually (something case Coronaviruses like SARS MERS) people *much* better catching virus later rather sooner treatments information become available. work haha. secede, would efforts shot hell succeeding haha I'm sure saying thing Florida big outbreak March/April. 


You're likely gonna see serious uptick deaths 'til July. uptick looks like largely going depend much current outbreaks continue grow. understand it. know possible probable case. Otherwise would occurred highly doubt virus mutated there. definitely optimistic person me. 5 million vote swing California still amazing. probably exactly reason small states wanted electoral college back 1700s lol.

My comment actually something DT said, basically ""my campaign strategy (in 2016) based electoral college. popular vote, I'd Califonia, New York, Texas, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin.""

I'm electoral college fan, letting Cali excuse fucking awful HC's campaign 2016. knew rules, bother protect ""blue wall"". 100% put effort win way knew win thought would take care now. Bet stop writing speeding tickets busting teenagers dime bags. fucking idiot! think meaning CFR yes technically. 500k+ tests 6% positive rate still isn‚Äôt bad. IFR rate discussion hasn‚Äôt changed much though looking generous .04% negative 1-2% range. Chennai locked crowds social distance mandate mask wear? Dave Chappelle bunch southern states classifying hundreds deaths pneumonia. Pneumonia like 400-500% places. know deaths lag. There‚Äôs need state it, nothing comment. Actually, entire reply nothing comment. Deaths going month, states opened month 2 ago, never closed. Hospitals opened elective surgery testing everyone coming in, say needed back surgery, go test positive asymptomatic, listed COVID19 patient. Explains hospitalizations keep rising deaths stagnant dropping. think people going pretty low tolerance ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù. Especially death rates keep falling. New Zealand great job, also advantage remoteness/lack land borders. I‚Äôm Canada personally, many parts country experiencing single digit even 0 new cases daily even they‚Äôre right across border US (mainly Atlantic Canada prairies atm) He's stupid. Yes lately observed many people downvoting posts share news articles contain facts. Sad see Blind devotees BJP stoop low. *secede one shows article could well wrong. However, seem understand, virus novel, seemingly contradictory information simply dismissed hand fit already know. idea reported symptom reported before, automatically make invalid. one point, thought children spreading coronavirus. know, spread it, also become ill too. may true article reporting. Truth is, know scientific inquiry validate invalidate article describing. don't. 


Tho states low enough numbers contract trace cases relative ease staff place. Moron. kept shows this. get fucking deserve. countdown ""he joking""....haha..get everyone!! hilarity 120,000 americans dead 3 months....guffaw WWI. possibly Great Depression. Civil Right movements... I'd say maybe tied Vietnam? depends test talking about. 

The nasopharyngeal swab PCR test - amplifies pieces genetic material (RNA case) virus. positive test means pieces RNA detected quite specific SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. coronaviruses). false positive rate swab thought low, particularly patients compatible clinical features. (Note test could conceivably also detect fragments dead virus, there‚Äôs real practical way know sure individual cases without able culture virus, i.e. see grow cells.) false negative rate test, however, relatively high. test thought somewhere around 70-80% sensitive, meaning miss good number true positive cases. may due number factors, including test performance (uncomfortable, easy get good swab), time illness test done (better first days symptoms), viral load. Basically positive test likely represent true positive (and risks believing treating negative high), whereas someone negative test pretty good chance COVID could well still disease evaluated carefully clinical context. 

The antibody test (serology test), hand, detect virus rather antibodies body makes response virus. tougher interpret. Antibodies show somewhere around 11-12 days symptoms begin (in patients symptomatic, is). don‚Äôt know well yet degree cross-reactivity ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù coronaviruses (thought low I‚Äôve read, hard know sure), false positives possible. also know whether detectable antibodies means immune, level antibodies confers immunity, long response lasts. test also tell someone actively infectious. positive test means may exposed SARS-CoV-2 past (or potentially coronaviruses, fairly common), determine immune. negative test means likely exposed recently exposed developed antibodies yet. 

Basically, testing - interpretation thereof - complex! know what? Lets go Martial Law get shit im sick lawless belligerent behavior sides. 

Its disgusting ruining country helping way.

This goes cops problem killing perps reason......dont get started. Oh got saying. Countries recent autocratic governments well well countries current autocratic governments.

Additional examples: Spain, Iran, Chile, Russia, Brazil. Deaths lag new cases 2-3 weeks spread keeps death tick up. Death lag (whether want hear not) hospitalizations. mean 2000 deaths day eventually numbers go people keep getting infected. state Victoria terrible. Make America Great !!!  Cases slow country flattening curve. 1,509 total cases past day. X rays can't show shit thing is, *the right* (Reddit let say C word name think) even need find alternative context this. They're already anti testing. believe number COVID-19 cases fudged doctors hospitals form gain. they'll claim Trump 100% right case; ""why count 10 year old COVID sniffles?!"" parents (bunker boy supporters) outright said care data statistics, refuse get tested want ""another statistic."" think ""number cases"" something dirty lying left using ammo poor Trump. So, yeah. Even direct fucking quote, can't convince hardcore Rights Trump idiot. flat denies that‚Äôs collapsed.

The problem is, celebrities say ‚Äúexhaustion‚Äù usually means much alcohol/drugs. I'm sure post cross 40 upvotes.

Well.. kidding. can't happen there's entire downvote army country want world know facts. miss hugs, need them. Physical affection reduces stress calming sympathetic nervous system, times worry releases damaging stress hormones bodies. one series studies, holding hands loved one reduced distress electric brain pathways specifically dedicated detecting affectionate touch,‚Äù says Johannes Eichstaedt, computational social scientist psychology professor Stanford University. ‚ÄúAffectionate touch biological systems communicate one another safe, loved, alone.‚Äù

Isolation scary thing. truly need other. agree, totally fine criticism. parents adamant going. made rules going stay within them. I'd really rather home chilling like been. power family, since basically dragged here, veto place look safe. I've already veto'd shopping areas ok that. 

Is ideal, no? selfish? yes, family trying best despite others obviously less impact stuff. 

:/ oh well. ""plan""? see plan. obviously plan intended save lives. mean plan pay many people unemployment? That's prove right! WHY!!!???? Philippines: 1140 deaths

US: 120,000 deaths rising.

The Philippines control way better US. He'll pay dues one way another. intelligent people dumb people. That's world is. Nothing else say he's part latter distinguished leader. certainly achieved self centeredness. Thank God left governors, least unlike federal government brain, trump moron would kill us without blinking eye make sure rich friends stay rich. People see factual knowledge, confidence, good looks think that's smart. 

Intuition, ability see things going, important. Unfortunately politicians overestimate intuitive abilities thinking perfect even though garbage tier. watch show Survivor see good looking highly educated guys someone like Boston Rob running circles around mentally. everyone wore masks would possible, Japan less fine despite government‚Äôs response shit people wear masks Hahahahahaha Please tell joke fucked electoral system let's someone 3 million fewer votes 'win'.  Interesting cases rise, death toll continues steady decrease. would expect uptick deaths week now, pattern interesting. feels like headed ice berg people saying let us hit it.

Free ice drinks BBQ weekend. Texas 4,100 cases 5 days ago. 2,500 cases 12 days ago.

When spike deaths hospital overload supposed happen?

How long need see action ready call mistake? 2 weeks? bit clich√© point, say 2 weeks?

Imagine protect elderly infirm get virus go, deaths stay lower lockdowns. embarrassing going lockdown proponents? Destroyed global economy, created civil strife, *and still* worse taking normal precautions. scandal would monumental every country Sweden lost minds. enough protests Germany life opinion two unequal enforcement. changed stance weeks since comment bit, one forbids become bit smarter (to paraphrase Adenauer).  became symptomatic quickly floor rushed meet him. genocide - purely indiscriminate killing unless account class. case, yes, continuation abuse less wealthy poor happening since forever :| Protesters.....did test yet what? new cases. Deaths catch another ~10 days. Politicians law order laws orders like. Fuck 'em. ironically. Old man screaming clouds won‚Äôt mass burials. It‚Äôll steady stream dead people he‚Äôll able ignore. Wow. Extremism it‚Äôs finest. agree, sarcasm necessary situation like this. comment poor taste.  /S?JK Im sorry know this. Poor guy....You dont know shit really infects you



and im trying cute rhyming asshole....

This shit random shit people..../ strict lockdowns? mean half-assed lockdowns merely temporarily throttled spread? Yep let's see continues cases people passing nowhere rises. I'm sure people take seriously then. Yep. That's true. title poorly worded, agree? Today FL 4049 cases. couple weeks ago 1200 day. governor seem care I'll probably teaching Aug.  Fucking idiot got home week ago today. fucking shocked blatant privilege display. stayed beach condo week went bike rides dark everyone else went home. Don‚Äôt bother going restaurants gift shops, even harbor. yet, still show work one busiest tourist destinations world. Love that. yes no. Deaths increase cases increase, that‚Äôs definitely true, think guy point. (first) peak US, adding 30-32k confirmed cases/day. recently, trend decreasing 22k confirmed cases/day. means cases decreased 68% peak value.

Looking deaths, peaked around 2,200/day mid-late April. since declined steadily current 650/day. means deaths decreased less 30% peak value.

Maybe we‚Äôre testing significantly ‚Äúpeak‚Äù value was, that‚Äôs definitely possible. well possibilities. regardless there‚Äôs denying past 1-2 months cases/day stayed relatively elevated daily deaths dropped pretty sharply. 

We see rise deaths, hopefully meteoric. 

All data Moderates attractive right progressives. Take Hillary vs Bernie example. Yes, that's detailed tracing testing actually found. 121,980 deaths, point? Wait, video clears this. making joke, guys miss that? got really sick 2 weeks back April doctor's office think needed test. Anyways around day 10 joints got sore legs swelled ached ~12 hours. Really makes wonder kidding, Arizona's bursting flames rn  point? mean, going places, too, contributing problem. correct. silent symptom covid lower oxygen levels blood. What's thing goes finger test oxygen levels. r/nottheonion jfc ""if cant see there"" Dude needs removed office immediately. make November rate. Personally think anyone protesting right either. hypocritical. Like me, everyone shit Trump-bozos like keyboard home. stupid title makes look like passed covid-19 course. doctor said dehydrated. happened getting haircut actually one time, got dizzy got up, went bathroom late remembered waking up.
You actually sitting wrong way blood pool legs cause pass out. Dr told zero explanation happened, could sitting wrong way.  They‚Äôre reason we‚Äôre going fucking insane every day quarantine families danger. separate politics? Genuinely curious. going say like watching ship sink, feels like we're space heading towards sun. set game plan happens someone household tests positive COVID? confine room, wear mask? Tape vents closed? Seal area doors? Leave doors windows house open ventilation? He's obviously joking watch it. Redditards critical thinking Well least 2k+ deaths/day fuck? Democratic party already conservative conservatives anywhere else world.


The 'moderates' people look Nazis everybody else say can't see difference. support everything bad country willful inaction. 


Why hell would claim Democratic party needs *more* moderate? Correct. Burnie progressive though. many people vote anyone him. Waterparks follow Regardless word want use, trump tossing poorest vulnerable among us wolves. 

But doesn‚Äôt care never cared them. putting logic any. most, logic ""that person actually *need* test, they'll recover fine"" (the example kid sniffles). means understand infectivity, means wider context community transmission. feel like Yossarian Catch-22. Everyone around fucking insane I‚Äôm sane person. alway figured would expat one day cannot stay here. America dangerous doesn‚Äôt make sense stay safer note socially minded educated places live. feel bad Oklahoma wonder many cases result rally people (insert biggest bad word here) brother wife grandson tested positive I'm going go get tested tomorrow.

 sorry butcher words English second language voting Trump. lot ways, looking numbers America aggregate. comes virus, response categorized ""50 nations trenchcoat"". Everywhere different. don't. went window mid-March. virus necessarily need mutated order potentially cause something like this, reported. would take case Covid related appendicitis rare, previous persons it, going undetected. Yep, begins! And, outside. mean also civil rights movements going legit talking like he's either high drunk. know nothing new holy shit. Don‚Äôt call person outlier. someone‚Äôs baby. parents dreams wishes hopes child they‚Äôll never see fulfilled. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, people want boil ‚Äúoutlier‚Äù statistics. Learn fucking empathy. Sounds like long life. Exactly this. People want make kinds excuses try explain someone unqualified dangerous could president reality simple.

This America is. Head Florida Man Florida things. hoping longest deadliest wave believe refer Pyrrhic Victory Arguing one two shitty situations worse help. They‚Äôre still shitty. infections rates spiking are? sure. depressing grandmother died pneumonia 2000 probably caused influenza. year's main influenza strain, guessed it, H1N1.

Yup, making Spanish Flu, grandmother went later version fucking flu think fact governors control helped some. ones right thing lead states well. Imagine federal government dictated everything? America: Hold Bud. tf test many STDs country?! Don‚Äôt know test STDs, number cases STDs find go up?! 

I tell people, slow testing down, please! can‚Äôt many STDs country. need keep America great! person know girlfriend truly believe wouldn‚Äôt weren‚Äôt together wasn‚Äôt always talking doesn‚Äôt read news. wonder Bolsonaro sees qoute next hours thinks ""Hey, that's bad idea. 15 seconds looks properly presidential. Specifically, part mouth closed. 

If could stay like forever, would fine. fuck-tard beyond words. Devil incarnate comes mind... light, bringing light inside body KEY component. Lol, soon see us negative votes.  joking, forgot smile audience forgot laugh.  Titties too. trust guy manage sausage stand, again, gets better boundless stupidity. Reading words like looking rainbow that, somehow, made entirely bile shit. sound like could exist, is. argument ""He clearly joking."" No, I've always known virus could spread 0.2-0.5% fatality rate. That's lockdowns stupid policy - postponed inevitable.

Well, July 2 weeks away. lockdown got 2,500 deaths per day. We've 1,000 last 3 weeks. 600 today (I know, know, weekend lag). need *triple* current daily death count 2-3 weeks order *equal* death count lockdowns purported ""save lives"".

Want place bet strategy going prove deadlier? I've it. Vitamin D3 helps inflammation, seems driving force virus. European scientist refuse claim  taking? 3 times per day. got better taking quercetin antibiotics May ask source read it? sure got downvoted trying understand tests currently available. 

This whole corona virus thing fluster cluck beginning US government screwing up. hard faith government information get sometimes conflicting. 

Dr. Fauci initially told people need wear masks masks sick. reversed asked injecting bleach ok, whole debacle waiting SHTF declaring pandemic. 


Given ineptness government get hold situation maybe understand cynicism. Thank sincerely explanation though. parents grand parents. Aunts uncles? baby likely fine. r/facepalm Yep. diabetes. think world leader would require standards nope. pulse seems thing need charge hundreds millions people. dunno maybe people date get know 

Honestly, think would better everyone's mental health happiness. seems like longer actual connections. true connection would wonderful this. would lot better casual sex. 1 lakh = 100,000 4 lakh total cases 

I'm sorry, many cases? i'm lakh-tots intolerant... need wait see long antibodies last. News say last 3 months 33 confirmed deaths participating Picu‚Äôs covid dashboard, include deaths ED, regular floors, home. also doesn‚Äôt include every PICU, numbers interesting [covid dashboard county state opposed county another state?  I‚Äôm saying won‚Äôt see death toll relative case counts saw April considering progress we‚Äôve made learning treat virus. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. never got tested. Ias bartender, got sick Later decmever Yah mean technically pneumonia nail coffin lot medical issues. Lung cancer...pneumonia. Covid...pneumonia. Autoimmune diseases...pneumonia. Well Legionaires bad, sorry hear friend hope ok.

Legionaries usually found HVAC cooling towers found large systems. (Think HVAC buildings rooms) guess could found window unit given unusual sets circumstances. 

But even so, Legionaires appears different beast Covid19bin way it‚Äôs spread.

I‚Äôve spent much last three months reading, pondering questioning effect HVAC systems could spreading COVID19 virus. Frankly, IMO would take someone coughing directly return air vent small HVAC unit (think mini-split evaporator, maybe wall unit preferably without filter) aerosolize infected droplets. again, could also happen fan, gust wind. HVAC unit won‚Äôt grow incubate virus. distance could travel.

I‚Äôm actually worried toilets without lids. Someone sick eliminates flushes lid up, waste aerosolized throughout room. main concern moment. tested asap, get isolated contact traced.

In fantasy land yea happens One outdoor masks, not. thinking pre-nuclear age.


Any territory nuclear weapons claim control absolutely secede. Even worse transitioned 10 year old comment kids great immune systems, open schools. It‚Äôs like doesn‚Äôt understand. Even every grade school child got sniffles still coming contact parents, grandparents. Dude truly clueless understanding risks associated really anything make sure vote. requested mail ballot case able make polls. Almost like he‚Äôs leading another group confederates losing war. Confederates England France back racist war still lost union. live alone, unless whoever cohabitates also diarrhea. C diff stupid contagious. mean Joe Biden considered moderate is? centrist candidate besides Amy Klobuchar all, graduating sippy cups quite accomplishment. I'm glad wear mask. certainly important thing need doing. Lost hope US functional nation simple thing... guess term ‚Äúawash‚Äù relative. don‚Äôt think Reddit done nearly enough expose CCP‚Äôs actions HK protestors.  king among morons, king morons. died 4 decades ago Reagan era politicians removed barriers media conglomerates. probably get used fact people won‚Äôt accept ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù. I'm right you. Put life line less money can't wear mask? I've worn one since February 12 hours day. again. Close down. call asymptomatic

Isn't collapsing stage symptom? u contact trace 34000 people ratio similar cardiovascular diseases.  


.77% cardiovascular deaths 35, 


.82% COVID deaths 35. Thank third fourth nights nationwide Floyd protest Utah rally. 

 anti facemask rally hills country singer. 

 I'm selling food people week- less 20% wearing mask. Two weeks ago working high school graduation. Speaker mic'd set invoke Obama negatively 4 times. high school graduation 2020.

*Oh, we'll need them* I‚Äôm sure answer question thread without getting comment deleted, overall consensus going US last 4 months are? terms COVID, mostly. interested outside perspective. covid handling Canada disappointing. thought would've pandemic playbook ready, considering large sars outbreak. started screening passengers alot sooner did. BC little bit ball most, otherwise, numbers would closer USA imho. Doofus Pleaaaase click usss autocratic governments ***present past history***

They ***had*** autocratic governments past, right according press democracy index similar Taiwan.  normally would agree. however friend contracted Legionaires, window unit held primary suspect. Acton Dewine great job, course, ""kentucky"" part state fucks lol.

We'll keep thing cleveland  autocratic governments ***present past history***

They ***had*** autocratic governments past, right according press democracy index similar Taiwan. huge rise florida states sering lots hospital increase/deaths? mortality rate gone initally thought? goes full circle... becomes shakespeare obviously sarcasm. media keeps willingly misinterpreting statements (although really stop giving fuel).

In instances, he's *praising* number tests US doing. Read quotes article‚Äîit's literally right bragging countries' comments US response (questionable ways, that's beside point).

The point is, he's saying numbers higher countries we're better job testing. media took obvious statement twisted sound like he's suggesting tests cause cases. absolutely moronic twist publication goes ashamed.

Again, whether agree he's really saying separate issue. He's saying media wants think, anyone 2 brain cells sense humor tell viewing original videos. Oprah says ""you get Covid get Covid!"" work grocery store, people along ignoring/skirting safety directions. incredibly frustrating. I'm glad see Michigan fairly good place, I'm worried even people going start behaving like pandemic over. Haha yeah, think that's good idea. I'm guessing given lines like ""HIGH SAVED HUNDREDS OF"". actually surreal people type speeches exactly spoken. bad enough listen to, reading somehow become even incoherent. I'm protests month, we're definitely seeing consequences now. along states' half-assed attempts reopening. Oh, okay. thought watching campaign rally stand comedy special. find comedian funny. possible worker notice. ???

Nobody celebrating 

We want taken seriously avoid death

Get head outta sand anyone informed Trump viruses can‚Äôt vote? That‚Äôs wear mask.

And it‚Äôs really easy take in-depth precautions without going OCD mode. Don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs something effortlessly. attitude. New York kicked ass smart following recommendations health experts. US whole could reduced hundreds good leadership, psychotic man baby charge Fox ""news"" megaphone fucking up.  u contact trace 34000 people That‚Äôs people initially worried areas strictly locked social distanced cases plummeted. Contact tracing becomes viable eradication strategy point, especially people keep simple things like wearing masks indoors public transit economy start open again. protestors wearing masks? Really? yes, protesting legal(not burning community down. know, justice best severed stealing Jordan‚Äôs.) don‚Äôt actually get mad trump wearing mask, time pretend okay people packed one large group? really dedicated online personality? think there's truth it. think straight-up lie rather joke.

I believe second joking. He's not. He's lying. potted plant couldn‚Äôt beat Trump 2020 problem isn‚Äôt Biden American public. Except, know, coronavirus subreddit. Oh yay county made coronavirus sub. 

Up week ago lived couple family members Santa Barbara county trying tell things going get bad need take seriously social distance everyone thought overreacting. result unwillingness quarantine move stay sister another county permanently planning moving away. wonder still think I‚Äôm crazy. Doomers doomers, either way happy cake day! state people protesting lockdown told dooming state? No, keep telling ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù unenforceable. Humans became top use brains tackle problems strength cannot. virus care tough think are.  couple months ago downvoted saying wasnt going thousands deathsz hundreds thousands deaths. several countries avoided crisis. competent government could avoided it. joke idiots. may still needed it. regardless goof. 95% patients coming symptoms need ventilator, give ventilator. Oh okay. worst 3 years. can't reason people bruh. Think you‚Äôre funny ya? ancient power believe you, can't hurt see humor it. Gallows humor, still humor. Come someone PLEASE stab guy eye fork!!! think referring social distancing stuff like that, upcoming economic depression. Yeah, happening LONG time. watched video, 30 seconds line, context. thinks numbers make look bad want testing. stats see sides remind ridiculous ones (American) football commentators make mid-game. ""This third quarter true freshman side Mississippi got 6th assist using right hand!"" That's entitled. According BBC, one high-up staffers claimed Trump ""obviously kidding.""

God bless poor soul still clinging damage control strategy. can't imagine worked well far. US: 20 new cases minute Neither Cilnton Biden progressive. know, asshole, people taking vacations right part problem. Nashville, Tennessee, I‚Äôd bet comedy shows taking place states restrictions. love seeing corruption leading charges hope sends clear message wanted. Honestly agree. friend Minnesota started opening prior ‚Äúpeak‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard know predictions change due changes protocol tend agree you, esp areas feasible people work home-they give income long, may well counts. see, that's part problem. get it, nothing real bad, spread around bad someone else, maybe even die infection... American culture individual freedom long, we've forgotten means act collective interest mind. something spread extremely easily, would less concerned others do. However, irresponsible people create many, many infections... 

Being careful taking proper precautions require OCD freak out. Damn, sad say, Imagine deaths start catching new cases. family dayton concur . OCD world harm start taking level precaution.

The thing is, committed staying home I‚Äôm longer contagious get it, don‚Äôt see getting COVID super dire scenario. Ive heard stories bars seemingly back normal there. Bands, shoulder shoulder shootin pool. 
 
I love state, good luck North East. never succeed, absolutely not. statement 100% prove US mentality disabled president, hopefully long. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs actually *this want*. southern states less month live New England id say August ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù, old normal coming closer every day, look window. order sadly going enforced, it‚Äôs simply impossible. LA takes roughly 30 seconds leave home bump someone without mask. make sure people allowed exercise first amendment rights wear mask get back work. one scary things virus think people giving much notice of. generation *extreme* germaphobes. Seems like could quite dangerous population level. many kids growing world potentially unhealthy level hygiene worry immune systems. Same, case numbers northern ohio look great.

Our dayton friends however can't get shit together, unlike us, UH Cleveland Clinic Like calls hoagie sub, sure. opinion one phase. Open fast possible. like yes no. couple states tried early pretty much told stop shit. states debating not, insignificant would ask sister could provide proof claim. don‚Äôt anything saved master list topic. Mainly think 1 2 states tried it‚Äôs shitty argument make. 

What sister could say based deaths per whatever European countries far spread initially believed per confirmed recorded cases. Like Belgium absolutely wrecked virus relation deaths pretty chill minimal mitigation measures compared European countries. Pacific Northwest already tending towards possible secession, travel trade agreements completely different culture rest USA.

Honestly suprise cascadia /california becomes country century, especially way independence movments going Texas, Alberta, Quebec general support PNW independence. don‚Äôt fade pandemic threat, continuous pandemic historical precedent really doesn‚Äôt seem like plausible scenario based diseases actually spread IRL Depends what. think time next year really thing back international travel.

Economically could feel quite ya ya ya, always saying, wait next month /s 
 
for real, believe theory deaths take average 26 days person infected. 
 
I also think average person run get test first sign symptom either. People shrug mild symptoms go weekend BBQ head dinner drinks friends. 
 
I bet stats worse NY peak scary feels like headed ice berg people saying let us hit it. Serious question‚Äî 

Having seen reports many town era attending rally, knowing symptoms take 3-14 days appear; able verify exposure linked rally, then, able track number cases result rally? comment replying removed? Trump awful President however good hanging around bluffing. imagine Biden gaffing debates. see lot inflammatory extreme comments subreddit, often accounts months old, I'll give benefit doubt assume hyperbolic. Secession already much established option US state reason. Lots people lots opinions that, they'd off-topic distraction here. Moron. kept shows this. get fucking deserve. Please hold protests indoors, tight spaces yell loudly. Taco Bell? many stupid people dying hill. absolutely ridiculous, yet are.

Turns 2020 humans less intelligent 1920 humans. costing lives. No. NY NJ disastrous spread already widespread immunity. Helpful essential crush curve. someone forget medication? Sorry I‚Äôm wimp needs rely anti depressants anxiety meds get daily life \^\^\^ ground, Outpatient facilities usually run weekends, contracted labs probably shut also weekend, .... would think hiring staff kick 24/7 mode would justified ... ""business usual"" far work week goes, United States (world?) weird like that?, half way want assume asian countries went 24/7? ""weekends"" unique west? Yup. scary part it‚Äôs likely going get lot worse. Marietta &amp; rural Georgia common...? No. actually quite simple makes perfect sense supported evidence link provided you.

New York averaging **1,000 deaths per day** peak. Elevated corrected death rates noted Massachussets, New Jersey, Connecticut, Michigan. places major drivers initial mortality. look data link see dropping. major driver drop mortality. Total cases probably grossly underrepressented beginning pandemic well, since testing people going hospital.

It helpful think United States uniform entity. initial epicenters improving. rest fly-over country starting see major outbreak beggining. rise deaths coming months, although probably degree due differences total population population density. happen course summer since death lagging indicator. clearly documented link above.

Worldometer point predictions terms mortality. I'm confident predictions. Public lives actually matter them, political lies. told closing again, maybe desantis national guard run venues everyone works sick work? big corporation half assing think small businesses Here's actual seven day trend looks like AZ yesterday: going difficult American people even want help contact tracers job properly help eradicate virus. hope that's true, 500k confirmed cases deaths/confirmed cases 1.4% (compared 2.3% South Korea 4.7% Germany) simply find reported number deaths entirely unbelievable. Even vaccine come along, could take 3 years. increase testing thats causing increase cases US taking seriously whole. right complete free all. states own, counties own, sheriffs saying enforce laws state makes.... u give substantiated response per-comment wage offer stop popping timeline? still part statistic? heard Friday. help laugh, lol. challenge find single case mass spread COVID-19 everyone (95% above) wearing mask physically distancing. get Reddit, Europe amazing, USA bad. bet reddit 50% European. Reddit IP adress flags countries posts. really clear.

The BLM website list policy solutions organizers well. reflected signage decided ignorant of.

And please aware systemic racism saying n word.

You're replying outside range could easily disabuse ignorance. know I‚Äôm not. throwing away final year college, sorry. You‚Äôll arrest want social distance long they‚Äôre asking. Governor mandated masks huge start. states seeing surges likly mean divided like Europe divided 30 languages? many different religious sects? Vastly different histories?

Are 50% groups grossly anti-science, low IQ, fully ignorant? not, it‚Äôs apt comparison USA‚Äôs situation. Yeah, Brazil catching US terms infections, Latin America probably become new epicenter weeks. I'm sorry dealing this. sick since March, ran trained 5-6 days/week. I'm also getting worse, better.

May ask autoimmune markers found? positive ANA, one able identify autoantobodies (even weird ass panels sent Mayo).

I hope recover able return normal life. God knows miss mine. Website unavailable Europe. 

1.000 cases lot though, hope slap hard fines stricter regulations people start caring food animal workers welfare. Sure get sick ... stay home use hospital bed, ok? Whats reasoning? Would nice know many people successfully recovered course not, I'm town time. stating see. CNN published online article days headline:

If read article, find doctors discovered teen previously unknown Type Diabetes see, obese (morbidly maybe). also born preemie. May rest peace. Plant located Springfield, OH. Host *relevant* medical conditions. mean, yes, information masks clear beginning. said though, personal responsibility thing, people need use it. Everyone's quick throw blame around, act organization told everyone ""don't wear seatbelts, cut blood flow"", great idea blindly listen without research, asking professional, simply careful anyway. agree, tried saying masks work definately share blame, everyone's actions responsiblity. 

I think people trying shift focus blame others mask issue trying feel guilty putting themselves, family, friends risk. see someone say, kid, seeing someone TV say ""shake baby calm down"" blindly accept that. commonly known masks work, otherwise doctors (as said), construction workers, welders, painters, people use masks time simply wear them. really rocket appliances, there's wealth information people research they're questioning it. said, everyones health responsibility, blaming someone else fix that. spoiler alert: life currently going back normal eyes, least America Ah cool, didnt realize that. guess places hit harder may careful. live amsterdam, enjoying spring full swing (also slightly worrying), maskless, going well quite time. heard friends elsewhere EU. wear public transport, place really visible. hope keep that, safety well helping keep people forgetting covid thing flying around. ""Well, see, Merica, drop cousin's girlfriend t~~hinks~~ KNOWS phd holding Epidemiologists,Virologists,Politicians local family practice doctors lying us""  (\*points quotation marks effect)  Careful step sarcasm... fucked world, losing hope. \*cries. 99% said dumb wrong stopped parroting start critically thinking, spotted mistakes looking like asshole.

You climbed wrong tree hit every wrong branch way down. higher income, higher support Bolsonaro. known since 2018 presidential elections. poor people vote him. Man fucked new infections graphs aren‚Äôt much different shape death graph. seeing eye? 

Anytime anyone comes online says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm seeing perfect compliance!‚Äú think walked one block, saw 4 people. offense black lives matter, even ones pushed grandmother stairs! way see us, still check point counties.

If president rest idiots run counties could enforced borders closed travels, likely slowed spread virus, see stupid majority people something like possible country that's ran money idiots. political!! that's POLITICAL!!!! can't say subreddit! Well could both. said sly small laugh whatever want call it. know anything staff damage control heard video myself. said thinking he's funny probably dead serious too. joking matter serious. Haha US multiple instances number tampering. Especially Georgia. Also, 'free' press attacked arrested police multiple times protests. Doctors nurses told talk media face termination. seem implausible anymore. Why? taking long recommend this? think time waste. ""welcoming"" study urging caution results, even cautiously recommending extreme cases

People IVL 50/50 survival rate already, coin toss!

Just like warned travel bans early stages virus, specific Trump's China travel ban, waited March call pandemic. Yikes, Soros conspiracy nut. think hit record 12 downvotes ten minutes Yes. Also parking laws stone drug laws.  ""deep cleaning"" plant like really good preventing spread covid?  mostly spread air? surgery considered ""elective"" even though brain tumor causing seizures. seizure since removed. ""Elective"" though, right. hear saying (even though agree harsh insult), supply demand real concepts. would hope event like pandemic would allow us society readjust perceptions really important, works carry demand. 

We idolizing vaccine scientists others making positive changes country world, athletes celebrities. 

I realize sounds idealistic. many people die realize actually important? Western public health officials seem demand excellent evidence even basic healthcare measures like masks, studies still make sense.

While East Asians seem internalized NPI since early 20th century, seem 'rediscover' it. perfect storm, open everything, Karen's chads wearing masks, mass protests. Good luck that. waaaay many dumbasses country. Honestly probably need discretion. Smart people take necessary precautions idiots listen get weeded out. gotten important points.

For ChAdOx1 vaccine, major limitation: get one dose. Ever.  virus (the chimpanzee adenovirus) display SARS-CoV-2 proteins surface (it carries genetic code surface glycoprotein), patient develop immune response ChAd SARS-CoV-2 protein. patient administered future dose ChAdOx1-based vaccine, patient antibodies vaccine vector prevent infection work ""booster."" Moreover, future pandemic virus, anyone ChAdOx1 able get different vaccine based system.

However, VSV enveloped virus. rVSV-based vaccine, surface glycoprotein VSV replaced glycoprotein virus want vaccinate. new modified VSV causes infection (albeit mild one) generates robust immune response surface glycoprotein. future dose given thing, presumably modified virus bound antibodies, that's OK modified virus displays SARS-CoV-2 protein surface boost immune response.

Moreover, future enveloped virus emerges pandemic potential (Say, SARS-CoV-3), vector (rVSV) used changing surface glycoprotein, nobody immune new vaccine.

It's really great system enveloped viruses. limitation next pandemic non-enveloped virus, significantly challenging. Yea, unless testing continuously expanding/increasing, don‚Äôt think has, there‚Äôs something else. would‚Äôve predicted death rate hospitalizations least trending upward now. Can't enter second wave first wave end Repeateder: NOBODY wants disease. Yes What's needed keep cases low reduced transmission virus. 20% population immune, achieved result would reducing social interactions 20%. doubt 20% comprised largely maintain sufficient distance. Masks increase distance reducing radius spread (literal distance). 80% runs assumes unmasked business usual, rest assured achieve 50 even 70 percent infection (assuming durable immunity). ironic thing would restore high degree freedom save economy (masks) become bone contention freedom folks. part capturing virus globs mask reducing velocity human exhaust hard understand? Maybe start proving Newton's Laws again. could changed, right? one else conspiracy theory Chinese put 5g nanotech vaccine give world. Track control everyone. 

Joking course. üòÇ. Sorta ü§î don‚Äôt U.S. either. would say small minority dedicated wings. It‚Äôs pretty scary. kind test would great getting kids back normality school September. hope it‚Äôs successful. who, shut hell up. said, taking vitamins can‚Äôt bad immune system! Definitely cure all, good preventative (not saying PREVENT Covid, obviously. vitamins good you!) never gay bar.  there's reason gay bar, bar. obviously chance 2/35 infected dropped dead two week period, even nursing home residents. agree. general opposed higher taxes believe enough need do. It‚Äôs policy failure, lack resources many cases, $$$ often leads failure fix policies. Policing exhibit A.

We don‚Äôt need 7 aircraft carriers don‚Äôt need highschool football stadiums cost $10 million iPads every kids hands.

We much crossover federal state local agencies it‚Äôs asinine huge waste want $$$ it‚Äôs easy answer.

The problem throwing money problems making someone look like aren‚Äôt paying fair share politically expedient. long immunity last? see reports couple months? ""I got groceries""

""It's bagels, expect do, prisoner?""

""Mind business, you? took every precaution, wore mask everything""

I love social food aspects restaurants one things miss pre-pandemic life.  I'm scheduled surgery, later year.  


I live NYC area. restaurant opening phase starts Monday outdoor seating. Normally, I'd give 2-4 weeks see goes COVID numbers rise. even things go well, that's going cutting awful close surgery date, really want risk delay surgery.  


I'm getting preventive mastectomy (BRCA gene mutation) reconstruction. really want get surgery done start healing recovering.  


I sometimes restaurant meals delivered get tired cooking. live alone, miss social part. I've done video cocktails nice, person friend.  


I'd also hoped long weekend pre-surgery brunch friends, that's going happen. I'm hoping things better enough post-recovery brunch.

Please insult us Leftists including SJWs ranks.  UK definitely care masks never thought rest Europe better though. deadly numbers countries make out.

I've always thought lot people UK official numbers fun. profit.

I've admitted many times, never room like described. Maybe need better source prejudices?  Yeah, first peak northeast's numbers would take breather weekends pick earnest workweek. fact weekends posting record numbers bode well rest week America? no. many think ""shutdowns"" hampered meat, mass infections deaths among workers. leadership decided staying open critical need defense country, deaths damned. Meanwhile US record exports meat. pay often bad middle nowhere workers live together car pool together too.

The workers also foreign workers, paid little, housed together small spaces.

It's paradise virus general. know leaving lot younger people debilitating health problems right? Gonna real hard get things think entitled health goes shit catch partying. Call dad today.

The CDC already recognized [policy based they're unreliable.

Sadly, stopped states using tests make decisions reopening. N.Y. seen large scale protests weeks, yet lowest R0s country. almost everyone protest wears mask, protests outdoors. Upvoted A&amp;A Mr. T-Virus  Apparently stop testing fewer cases virus go away /s Things already going back normal, country reopening likely lockdowns unenforceable. pandemics. difference responded them. ebola emerged West Africa, USA sent doctors help stunt spread outbreak stage left West Africa's borders. time ebola reached shores here, medical personnel facilities prepared.

The reason compare 9/11 society's desire ""return normal"" mimics desire normalcy then. wanted simpler time Sept 2001 then, want simpler time covid now. ""going back"".

Yes, new virus. ""statistics"" extremely limited scope. like preliminary data. idea long term effects. literally know. sterile now? increased risk cancer heart disease? become diabetic? happens second exposure- symptoms become worse? don‚Äôt know. Contact tracing never going effective America though due Americans obsession privacy, fact americans hate unsolicited phone calls Americans consider diseases stigmatizing. CDC tossed certain tests false positives low now. thing need worried super-spreaders tested negative false sense security they're fine. NY Michigan massive spikes cases early on?  Respiratory infection triggers pretty much possible issues. protests outside, protesters wearing masks, protests essential (in various free countries, right protest held up). understand far optimal happens systemic racism also deadly, get it. Jesus christ need let reporting agencies start showing statistics percentage tested patients positive. we're testing 1,000 people day 300 positive ""30 percent infection rate"" sound measure ""only 300 new cases per day"".

Or even better, percentage increase per day like stock market. ""Covid infection rates 600 percent may June"" might get point across despite orange moron trying shut down. ‚ÄúLiberal‚Äù ‚Äúwinning‚Äù mutually exclusive. fact, they‚Äôre pretty much strangers. people wrong means feeling crappy week going back normal, maybe medium term respiratory issues like Polio level. someone like who‚Äôs 25, it‚Äôs worth taking every possible precaution, I‚Äôd rather feel like crap stay home week two go legitimate OCD mode (yes OCD) become unhinged it. No, again, absolutely tried, would thoroughly defeated would disgusting.

Also hell would go west, area Ohio shit together pandemic, ya'll Water wet, US fucked think people agree summer life less return normal, social distancing becoming less prominent people hanging friends. Total ignorance. wish guest list everyone trumps rally. trace two weeks, thousands may come contact with. Arizona nurse already posted massive amount new infections nearly beds full.

I'm glad rest country diligent distancing, president gets override hold massive gatherings. bad outcomes short dying, know.  Like life-long lung damage starters.  What‚Äôs sad number people unwilling give even small amount comfort greater good. really believe anyone boycotting mask use would change tune second someone loved got hospitalized COVID.

In terms using popularity tool, pandemic isn‚Äôt first time government used tactic def won‚Äôt last. everyone well versed science viral load droplet spread isn‚Äôt effective motivation people. need John legend tell wear mask, say give John legend.

It‚Äôs unfucking believable That's certain testing methods recently tosses CDC. false positives exceptionally low right now. Idk is, Walmart, Food Lion, every major grocery store masks. go Lidl, half people masks, pretty good neck woods. democratic hoax? thought guy China? It‚Äôs gone yet? Neat. Neat. link outlines CDC says *when already situation wearing mask,* guideline situations wear one in. CDC recommends wearing mask ""in public settings social distancing measures difficult maintain."" grocery store one settings, park, unless extremely crowded, reason link says keep entire time public extra risk transmission gets added touch mask face process.

I'm brightest bulb box man, virus really brought home half population average intelligence. deeper look data deeply negative. Many states going 30% week. project many weeks see difficult choice wearing masks, staying home indefinitely, 0.5-1% population dying. sure ain't gonna wear masks. Yep, statement kid getting sniffles testing positive falls line saying. conspiracy bs. concerned people wouldn‚Äôt follow mask mandate California, today saw 95% masks about. think needs symmetrical benefit. benefits others 66%, benefits wearer 33%, wearer still gets 33%. concept infectious dose relevant here. (I think closer 60%-40%)   official source, like Italian government website, post age statistics? Maybe that's Italy then, odd. definitely case states. 75 group makes 48% deaths here, 15% genz mellenials, boomers genx make 20ish% give take. 

It's us dying, fact could die, extreme complications covid matter age one knows affected others.  would probably depend death rates. would suspect death rates keeping trending staying down, people whole lot comfortable go back normal Every democratic candidate pretty much ever moderate. also idea long term effects contracting virus. second exposure worse? Sterility? Long term organ damage? one knows. long take figure chicken Pox causes shingles? gov gives cervical cancer? ask DeSantos wants pose kids Covid-19 unknown future effects? bringing public like campaign commercials? taking playgrounds, see parents? Get fucking personal. put kids play start- ask aren‚Äôt public now. 

&amp;#x200B;

we yet. official report several locations show positive result virus. Somehow media choose emphasize salmon. real source clear yet. Work healthcare arizona confirm, many people taking seriously, even colleagues, scary Everyone reads stories exclaims ""these cases rare, aCCorDinG StAtisTiCs."" 

What statistics? estimated 2-4% population infected COVID. new virus. takes time assess long-term effects new pathogen, years research. 

Also, think people contract endure mild lung, kidney, heart damage bother go hospital. I'd willing bet pretty fucking high number, especially many afraid go hospitals now.

You people need stop playing God. humility. truth is, none us state conclusively widespread permanent damage yet. It‚Äôs likely primary method transmission. 

But risk probably 0. don‚Äôt see harm taking precaution hear we‚Äôre going slow testing numbers go down. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è think Trump win. sickening thought is. He's got many rusted supporters, Biden meh, can't see energising motivating enough people get arses vote him. Really good argument disbanding police. Crime rates immediately drop zero. one took seriously first all. felt another Ebola wouldnt effect us all. How, even joke, saying disrespectfully 10 years old ‚Äúsniffle‚Äù case? many people low age 21 died covid usa far? insane. worry, 99% tickets went teenagers TikTok Kpop Stans harassing Donny boy Klandemic Coronapalooza.

It half full, one outside, way safer people thought. Same, state along pushing 3000-4000. Right now. 6 months (at best western culture), clue.

We know long immunity is, know get different strains, know lot dealing yet. Yes, rats fleas equivalent ‚Äúasymptomatic carriers‚Äù.

And people acted lot dumber back Americans now, didn‚Äôt even know germs were, thought foul odors causing it. sounds quite high me.

Fuck, imma need least week get house cleaned order. It‚Äôs safe sanitized, fuck ain‚Äôt neat pretty. keep telling it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm people anyway. 

I understand. Social pressure making hard. It‚Äôs easiest keep tone light, quip short sweet remind people. quick look history see could find comment, I'm assuming one ""all kinds reports"" long term issues.

That sub strict anecdotes posting claims without sources, turn fear monger sub like sub. mentioned reports post links, show meaningful data statistics backup claim long term damages.

Not saying agree ban all, seems harsh. that's probably got banned. Don‚Äôt give up... struggle well ... laws changed help people like hard times. Stay positive share concerns people care help. lot people want help more. Keep talking/writing/sharing. Read article. Doesn‚Äôt look like yet significant improvement treatments patient care. misleading title. 

Mostly patients need hopes prayers aren‚Äôt among unlucky. yeah still need lockdown ... little possibility sick leave.

Source? sick-leave Germany? Social distancing. dont know hard concept grasp people. mmmm delicious koolaid FFS. entire country full idiots!!! Hahaha, project much...online personality. shit show. Get fucked disingenuous liar. Thank Yeah did. one disputes that. say purpose make numbers look good later idiocy  article claims around 1500 Florida.. CDC always WAY behind actual sources... check CDC now.. saying 3100. So, several thousand normal, even probably outdated empathize much. autoimmune issues I'm bad flareup, bad enough doctor insisted get lump checked see cancer would explain I'm falling apart. part almost wanted cancer, way would clear plan path ahead instead falling apart without anything diagnosis believed ""rare, unnamed disease"", like that's really useful I'm trying get treatment others understand I'm going through.  restarted season Canada üá®üá¶ someone paid watched webinar read set instructions mean they'll good it.

Until point, day day battle exterminate virus.

Cool. Still ridiculously small. Don‚Äôt know getting downvoted. wouldn‚Äôt let trickle people countries still infected, even NZ citizens. country duty quickly allow everyone back in, even attend funerals. Sucks, second outbreak takes priority. 

Not NZ least bit upset able visit. fault President stupid. That‚Äôs test random sample population identify clusters. Also high exposure groups tested every week.

There's occasional asshole people seem taking right actions protect other. hope means keep moving forward reopening without cases surging -- really want believe Well Hmmm ok 
In Germany 4.7% death infected.
To reach herd immunity, around 70% get infected.
So unless get eventually vaccine, huge improvement treatment, around 3.3%, 70% get infected probably. People downvoted thinking virus denier. dildos talking pathological physical disorders associated confined home, lockdowns. testing increasing. subreddit doesn‚Äôt like talk that. massive problem I'm UK well. lot paitents taking hospital beds covid across country clinically well (aka they've got virus mild need stay hospital) care homes refusing take back. disgusting. places supposed take care elderly final days, instead rinse life savings dehumanize So, idiot video wearing ""chin strap"" face mask? wearing face mask!

(What way set example... training too...) virus incredibly contagious spread 70+% population unless vaccine shat fast.

Tell me, dickturd9000, get tidbit from? good, peer reviewed citation hand chance? need downward trend badly schools try open normally fall. idea prepare happening. Sadly Covid-19 one many diseases spread event. Yeah! might backlog come Tuesday surprised there's bit uptick then! said looking good! March, overall outbreak doubling size every 2.5-3 days.

An increase 50% course two weeks glacial comparison fast progress without effective countermeasures place. asked another old person that's leaning way bit - nearly stubborn. serious, come much news athletes getting it? They're peak shape young. 

I've using excuse biking. There‚Äôs literally news article written young people dying. aren‚Äôt news articles old people dying? trying hide that? Yes, everyone could well get eventually. 

Only 2% NYC got vaccine likely possible within year. people highly packed NYC 2% population get it, I'm gonna call bullshit claim likely get it. mention countries like new zealand. going presented capable enough understand virus; know place that. set standard, know shit beyond simple, obvious options practice personal-level. amount Wikipedia gonna help understand elements environmental impact virus pose.

Wow, talk condescending making assumptions. know person replied Ph biochemistry. protesters main source infections. danger infection much greater indoors, shops.

That's say can't get infected protest, especially police thug starts spraying tear gas around, risk shops.is simply much greater.  picked sheetz day, less half customers wearing masks, staff wearing. Even signage stated need mask enter. Smh.  [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/u1Q9F) Good luck Malaysia! it. Rooting you. get zero, don‚Äôt allow people countries raging pandemics like US, UK, Brazil, etc. Damn positive tests keep declining huh craziest thing read thought minks getting infected covid, people catching covid *minks*. get covid mink, bolsters concerns places like dog parks. Dogs get covid dogs breathe much harder face mink, worries hell me.

What blows mind much CDC try downplay various vectors animals despite fact virus first came wet market. jumped species start, give break animals potential vector. I'm sorry dad. Hope today peaceful day. different everywhere... Novi last weekend almost everyone wearing mask stores... even liquor stores. Clare weekend almost one ...in part seen little C19. goes Fox News articles. comment section always disaster website. u gave pass 100000s protestors, choice give passes everyone u look like hateful hypocritical idiot. Yep. people like whine complain. It‚Äôs reason many people obese unhealthy. People seem think god-given right never little uncomfortable. 

Cloth masks don‚Äôt restrict breathing all. homie can‚Äôt grocery store 20 minutes cloth mask on, Probabaly isn‚Äôt healthy enough public. Think long surgeons wear masks time. I‚Äôve seen absolutely crazy argument lately ‚Äúco2 poisoning‚Äù wearing masks. people saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm healthy wear mask‚Äù also saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm healthy enough wear mask‚Äù don‚Äôt get Well influenza still around 100 years later, surprised Covid going different. Good thing 98-99% survival rate basically anyone already going come burden medical system. Perhaps get going reparations plan China. starters China needs forgive Debt countries. country keeps causing pandemics recourse. time pay. look Japan pearl harbor. would say China done far worse us parts world. ""Too fucking stupid"" lot work post. recommend reading this:

 True! understand make ""temperature checks"" holy grail ""we're well stop spread."" ignores issue asymptomatic carriers completely. post racist fuck. Holy shit. he's playing PGA, really say he's taking seriously? really drop APPARENT mortality rate. early stages, confirmed 5-25% Covid-19 cases. Sorry, big error bar number since don‚Äôt accurate true mortality rate. knew badly undercounting since people needed hospitalized could get tested earliest times limited tests. 

Now, people want get tested get tested. think somewhere around 10-50% detection rate. Hence apparent mortality rate drop 50% that. probably bit better treatments minor factor compared diagnostics. 

Still, America fucked. part Axis Incompetence: USA, UK, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Sweden. Perhaps members, leave poorest nations resources deal pandemic. misinformation?

They discovered evidence noted link. going refute it? watch scary. masks, many huge manly bellies gray beards.  foresee interviews convention organizers say, 'we handed masks. can't responsible threw out.' sure point trying make? says died COVID 19, unheard of. Yet never saw videos people New York collapsing like Wuhan. Oh no. Oh fuck. I‚Äôm sending every good vibe spare way. I‚Äôm crossing fingers colleague. 

Is positive test enough local health department shut down? That‚Äôs terrifying. 

The claims anyone ‚Äúsafe‚Äù infuriate me. Hearing experiences patients ‚Äúmild‚Äù cases enough make react strongest ‚ÄòNOPE‚Äô muster. 

That said, I‚Äôve got colleague another facility waiting test results‚Äîexposed graduation party. Sigh. One ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù country. Thanks. Yeah they're patients wait waiting room, they're taking straight exam rooms. Report HR poor people. They're instructed specifically ask protests. still ask were. ask leading questions like ""were grocery store, salon, etc."" can't every possible thing protests one those. time resources ask specifically know around 6 minutes time, time ask leading questions get every possible location they've too, way going ask they've rallys either.  Exactly. workers (often hired east europe) forced live terrible housing situations. 4 bedroom flat filled 16 people max profits... Lots people cough aren‚Äôt sick. asthma main symptom coughing (as opposed wheezing). Masks trigger asthma make breathing harder start coughing.

Typical American social program: step one, allow corporation rob blind, step two, throw bone. General Naird would say...""MOTHERFUCKER!"" Bah. meant median, mean... new record high Sunday? good sign sure.

Wonder we're going break 30k cases Sunday... First, past half way year terms outbreak started. second, aren‚Äôt ‚Äúnear top.‚Äù massage numbers however like, doesn‚Äôt make accurate. People wear masks stores public transport. wiat see spreads further. far seeing cluster outbreaks superspreading events really surprised ""weekend death slump"" maintained throughout well, would anticipated weekends would less observed got worse, apparently not? Accidentally got crowd today couple people know. wore mask tried stay fuck away everyone. acquaintances (no masks, distance all) made fun told I‚Äôm stupid, useless waste of... yeah, don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm wasting protecting everyone, get idea. 

Berlin, was, rising cases again. wonder why... bureaucracy incompetence always surprise me. thought medical professionals would racing figure instead creating hurdles. sadly affect yes, EVERYONE. nuanced. friends Prescott saying, much better there. Another concerning story. 

When done dusted realize much unknown COVID one big questions come time governments took risky decisions based presumptions danger understood well all. You‚Äôre complicating Things

A new case new case. Whether New York Georgia. 

If new case takes 2 weeks sickness another 2 weeks hospitalization , another 2 death, sequence events independent geographic location sick person 

The fact new cases haven‚Äôt dropped new deaths significant cannot explained reasoning job get elected. happens make policing popularity contest. get people waaay unintelligent job concerned re-elected. case someone got Sheriff simply person applied. honestly see that's part legal system, really elected cops, happens. dentist super careful would say risk minimal, dentist would masked mother would infection likely go diriyou fear, dentist obviously willing take risk. cancel appointment feels unwell all, even bit sore throat. make sure distance well waiting room, don't, would leave cellphone number wait outside. rich won‚Äôt allow think people think it. There's move government mandate even encourage them, apart public transport.  That‚Äôs true! suppressed actual numbers quite substantially thank much! 
/s Mitch McConnell =/= Congress

Flipping Senate blue also entirely within reach, get vote! attacking families come ~~difficult~~ cruel decision.

FTFY

It's absolutely attacking families. Ice floes humane care facilities.

Our society normalized abuse blacks police. Ample evidence showing society institutions place enable ongoing abuse. okay turn blind eye, forgive enabling abuse?

Read paragraph again, swap black elder, police old age home.

It's every bit fucking bad. systemic, enable it. People busy chasing career bigger house, bigger vacation, bigger truck. Got family members issues? Come together family support them. fuck come ok check abuse center Deathtrap.

I know hard is, I'm living it. care family enough rearrange life, sacrifice career progression care aged.

People sign elders lifetime abuse every bit bad cop killed Flloyd.

Our society says ok. not. Full stop.

Now stop apologizing people support system predicated abuse, something improve lives loved ones. Cancer heart disease 1.1 million put perspective. CA keeping steady positive test rate, plenty room hospitals, largest state country far, lots cases disastrous. okay. phenomenon rare, occurs many viral diseases, remember it‚Äôs 4 months since started. idea ‚Äúlong term‚Äù prognosis is. I‚Äôm pleased happy. That's perfect excuse Bolsonaro finish burning Amazonas use media hide carelessness Brazil. dentist visit add much risk whole endeavor feel. Seems like crap together. months road even infections gone ton, might less concerned populace increasing risk. point benefit shutting down. country whole said done corona. Stopping starting next year nothing. Everytime hospital reports case US, get grant pay it. report everything get money even comes back negative. Sure, bet numbers high high.

Before everyone calls conspiracy theorist, virus killed great grandma nearly grandma grandpa. joke. Wash damn hands sanitize shit regularly. Especially phone. meds take? Armodafinil? Adderall? opposite never regretted it. slaves animals okay Yeaaaaa, masks. 
I'm Maryland hot, like swamp heat. use air conditioning, open month protests. 

I'd say 99% people use masks here, numbers steady dropped since april. 

Hospitalizations, infections positive percentage. piece shit are. 
Indigenous people legacy America, contrary stupid point, America CONTINENT populated people got raped, massacred, mutilated, enslaved Spaniard invasion.
At least show fucking respect piece shit, idea talking about. idea drugs prostitution social problem live bubble.

I hope ot bursts face reality hard way.  safe willing accept risk going go eat. Using mask help us return close normal pandemic without locking bunker months. black white mask adherence going win battles almost impossible 100% mask adherence day long. could end less-than-ideal situation like anyone else. azithromycin 3 days I'd give information contact tracers asked. trust would get message through. Like you, I'd reach people call stores I'd (pharmacy, grocery).  help! one job flat refuses wear one boss sucks won‚Äôt implement . mask policy. don‚Äôt want math:

58,768 deaths flu/pneumonia reported 2018 U.S. People agree problem differ solutions.

But means call everyone disagrees racist. surprising really. money might guarantee best care guarantee survival healthy even make it... Let infect stupid people make change mind virus Disney North! Build motherfuckers! Nobody wearing mask Netherlands. Paris. Things opened people wearing masks distancing, people still working home can. get either. mean, totally understand people getting protest-level angry lost job due employer close work job high risk infection even they're stuck home kids forseeable future. Life know disrupted even people fortunate end spectrum kind sucks.

But get taking cheap easy preventative measure triggering people ""OMG UR STEALING FREEDOM!!!"" seems like really stupid hill die on, metaphorically literally. Yeah, guess sanitize stuff like bathrooms/doors/railings/equipment people touch. soon employees come back - touch anyway. 
     
CDC guidelines say:  
  coronavirus occurs much commonly respiratory droplets objects surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops, keyboards, toys, etc. Current evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable hours days surfaces made variety materials. Cleaning visibly dirty surfaces followed disinfection best practice measure prevention COVID-19 viral respiratory illnesses households community settings.
     
But really sure accomplishes unless workplaces completely shut wait employees tested. workplaces done others shut day employees keep working waiting test results. live Europe? pulling ass?

I live Germany. sister mother Italy, father Spain.

No one careless. about? Bc stupid shame there's way people can't choose register ""I'm stupid wear mask"", put lower priority. Would ethics hell likely, I'd problem that. Idiots dumb things, least prioritize people actually empathy people, self-centered make small sacrifices life. virus probably areas much ruled virus. Probably ruled flu pneumonia. chance reset? Yes.

For better? find difficult pass anti-racist policies racist. ,,l,,(-_-),,l,, agree. also living Netherlands regulations strict impossible spikes.

The difference USA Europe rules, people.

And / job cut dry. disagree view but, man, convincing... Sheesh. Looks right. May blessed quick death home then. believe happened, vast majority people experience parks. manage contact tracers state counties. odd everyone blaming protestors without much evidence so. They're outdoors mostly wearing masks. data covid cases state. majority food processing plants long term care facilities. places frequently run adminstration wanting work rest health department every turn. ""No employees need wear masks"" ""no employees need stay home even though contact"". sure enough, days later, everyone testing positive. I'm certain blame protestors came but, evidence see, lot you, them. people gathering INDOORS. focused heavily fomites early especially important, within reach individuals address. Droplet transmission got less attention airborne transmission got almost zero attention. include UK western Europe? least people lacked immunity.  chance reset life couldn‚Äôt content Yeah, found hydroxcholoquine makes things worse, remdesivier helps, cheap steroid cuts death 1/3. comes 50% reduction mortality. hope unknown underlying medical condition . I'm also deeply shocked Sweden's behavior. would never expected Sweden 

The dark underbelly neo-liral (add b 'i' 'r') regimes delegitimized concerted state action public affairs reduce society sum private individual actions. example, Finland never sold cold war-era medical reserves, sweden norway auctioned 90s quick money. 

The rot west contained US, country follows US economic model eventually reaches point state gives trying nothing state exists shovel taxpayer money private corporations. always deep end, pandemic laid sociopathy bare hopefully tone deaf among us begin see.  people cant even cooperate nations, across borders then? profitable say, would anyone cooperate risk losing cure?

No amount funding overcome impossible. yet impossible, done reputable virologist claims anywhere close possible.   way optimistic. Try 300-350k end 2030, 750k end 2021. i'd consider lucky shitty political leadership federally also state local level! 25 IQ test maybe fucking stupid? I'm serious. realize higher numbers infected lowers mortality rate, right? arguing stupid fucking point saying minimal cases count Covid. FFS I'm goddamn tired goddamn incapable critical thought fuckers are. Jesus Christ sad infuriating time. ""trial"" would take longer get going us going voting booth November 
Legitimate question, think one work one does? material difference here? slow, full intentionally obtuse bureaucracy dissuade involvement, often internally corrupted point inanity plain view. Everyone see it, news stories every day. Kentucky closed one polling places Louisville, county 600 thousand people, majority state's black voting population. really coincidence? keep acting like voting best option political climate, kind story keeps happening, over? - would say point. clock struck 13 Nice! Everybody know wasn‚Äôt kool aid Jonestown. may truly healthy known risk factors worth keeping mind people share medical history coworkers. thing is, teachers tend select second Tuesday November person left wing party teachers getting sick dying net win him.

Yes, know bit verbose automoderator tumescent anal cyst north border watching like ""we knew guys problem education science, holy fuck never knew bad was"".

We're still social distancing even health districts **hundreds** cases, even thousands.

You guys cities higher number infected entire country usually could use population argument but... even that.

Its incompetence frightening level. sincerely hope Canada builds wall makes America pay it. say joke...

This routine defense Trump supporters since 2016. Praise saying something agree with. says something even can't get behind ""Hey, joking."" There's arguing clowns. Highest second highest = downward trend? Probably many. great, it, 3 hours long so? 10,000 people? 30,000 cumulative hours indoor exposure.

Back napkin here, 330,000,000 Americans, lets say 5 percent go hour dinner given week. I'm sure way higher that, let's pretend. That's 16,500,000 hours exposure. saw footage... would say context would fucking, huge, gigantic lie.  remember looking one particular girl walking like zombie almost collapsed

Crazy videos circulated people still decided take lightly stupid? course white house defend Trump. Trump choose represetant... Wouldnt dump say bad things boss? Rofl. Open eyes bud... know get mad see people back cheering nodding heads said ""slow testing"" Hey part speech sarcastic? link sarcasm? uncommon especially virus first crosses different organism virus lose unnecessary genetic material longer necessary new host, especially post extremely prevalent easy infect like humans modern mass transit high population density civilization.

It could die completely, would guess probability mutating toward Leslie fallity becoming kind another common cold like common cold kill small percentage population. lethality likely drop unknown rate one way other. However think reliable effect bet really change need vaccine treatments social distancing masks.

It's theory coronavirus's zoonotic viruses general. Sorry maybe closest relative humans die amazingly rapidly. seen data show virus anything like that. would lean towards probability sticking around likely losing lethality becomes minor threat. might still really infectious people get fairly rapidly RO still decline. hand hospitals close confines change natural mutation stimulus toward unusual potentials could always get mutant strain especially hospitals lot exposure potentially multiple strains viruses mixed big soup genetic probably. settings lethal versions might prove also much long-lasting evolutionary advantage. 

It help long record well studied Corona virus data. really know virus capable plagues human history happened hundreds thousands years ability truly document meaning records human virus plagues seriously incomplete. one's we'll know lot least. :) like know... *PrƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma practice breath control yoga* admit expert this, read lot.

Fuck, turned around *fast*. swear, last week, 20k. Oh, keys like *right* next other. Give'm break! Well, ummm. think... eh. Fuck boggles mind. please system reset 2020?!!‚Äôb none American, actually thought someone might take inaugurated. True story!  That's works That's works bad hijack plane fly onto building... ""gov gives cervical cancer"" interesting typo. feel like brain turning mush Mind blown 30,000 new cases daily 1 August Florida, nothing worry about. Donald Trump. tons support groups actually vote, go reddit wouldnt see that. Bad bot

And fuck America sunk to: standard President drink glass water one hand. It‚Äôs funny bracing hate well. Heaved sigh relief...: great community. beaches bit wind (giving clean air), hot (bad virus), UVlight (bad RNA). understand completely. wants less testing looks better. That's it. 30,000 daily new projection Florida 1 August. China then? 

Imagine had:

1. population placed community individual, 
2. country really trusted government, and
3. government actually works people.

That's China had. China asked lot people locked Wuhan/Hubei Jan 23, rest country Jan 25. numbers pretty small time, China acted quickly seriously clarity fast COVID-19 spread, dangerous was. China lot education awareness, constant, consistent messaging. 

If go back late January / February, lot Chinese people griping restrictions Chinese social media, still followed almost uniformly. addition, disinfecting daily (virus lives 3 days hard surfaces), deep tracing testing, setting non-contact systems minimize contact exposure. Much ""stay home"".

By March, clear Chinese approach lockdown massive case management testing worked (Reff &lt;0.3) eradicate virus, could reopen real. Since then, Chinese government sorts novel things maintain control, starting isolation quarantine infected family members, recent mass test 10 million population Wuhan. afraid go big, they're getting results. 

China ""best case"" result worked really, really hard people. Germany broadly comparable, eventually got serious control things. he's joking around 120,000+ deaths watch.


What shitty human being. Yeah, testing problem! Like fuckin ostrich putting head sand thinking he‚Äôs invisible.  Maybe? told 20 years ago. honestly don‚Äôt remember well described illness caused it. mind focused able taste smell getting sick! Oh wait two weeks again? He's sundowning. assessment one? dunno, I‚Äôm alive right it‚Äôs fun.... Biden strong candidate. lot support Hillary time 4 years ago lost. Joe Biden Barrack Obama Bill Clinton. one commented, I'm guessing know. positive lyme test result (ELISA and/or western blot) followed 3 week regimen doxycycline insufficient fully treat cases disease progressed undetected (ie, cases?) 

Lyme patients, lucky enough diagnosed all, quite literally partially cured lyme disease guidelines treating disease written scummiest ppl imaginable ties insurance companies.

So I'm assuming commenter diagnosed, treated according guidelines, still feels sick never treated properly. amount ignorance around virus absolutely appalling. guess going get massive number deaths collapsed economy deserve. Americans obsession privacy,

I‚Äôm like ‚Äú job it‚Äôs ...what? know going say amazing cut find insane. believe many Covid deaths result co-infections. example, get Covid, chances going fine. get flu Covid time still recovering Covid infection, rough ride.

This time year far less seasonal diseases. worry fall get things control then. Nah, hear he's joking. Officially. many states also reported 500% increase ""non-covid pneumonia deaths"" year too. like 200,000 According OP's article, noticeable difference presenting March presenting now.

*""When novel coronavirus first surfaced South Florida hospitals March, patients elderly medical conditions made vulnerable.

Americans manage politicize hard?! staffers? USA back 30k probably keep going now. fucking stupid? 

How many stupid fucking supporters? 

Jesus Christ. 

It‚Äôs mind numbing oh dumb he‚Äôs President United States. Fucking hell. Covid sucks. scare frail elderly 1 6 infected dies. Kids die covid rarely one dies makes headlines. latest CDC analysis shows 46 Americans age 0-19 died covid, 71,110 covid deaths. comparison, 179 hospital reported flu deaths Americans age 0-19 last flu season. diseases suck kill many.  Bad bot. blend together while. must hard watching country descend chaos. Well, seeing Australia media, looks like America chaos anyway. Sad China wings pushing agenda America seems looking inward itself. Also didn‚Äôt even die, he‚Äôs crisis actor pretended die Nothing looks presidential. He‚Äôs overweight orange burnt slob mental decline. Smell Corona rally last night. _üí©_ Ok. Thanks giving goosebumps low blood oxygen lack common sense. hell performs highly contagious pandemic? Idiot. smart, funny idiot, like many others. understand intelligent people ignore science. Hospitalization rates wouldn‚Äôt dramatically case. Fuck Trump can‚Äôt fucking catch already man. Unfortunately, watched say live. wish could say taken context. turned TV said kids would recover ‚Äúsniffles‚Äù coronavirus brings 15 minutes. There‚Äôs much stomach. like wild fire spread keep seeing repeated conservative opinions facts isnt true. Like all. Protestors knew risks they, wore masks. saying pandemic hoax wearing mask means dislike Trump. 

Even cursory glance anything isnt editorialized opinion piece would show that. Even cursory glance peer reviewed research would show masks effect. cant either things, maybe keep head ass least dont spread virus anyone. Dumbass mouthbreather. Michigan decent job.  wonder what's different there? 

&amp;#x200B;

Actually, kinda do. Like, rural Michigan different rest rural Midwest, gettin levels Covidiocy. wonder effective there? absolutely matters. state climate, one (determines likely people go outside). again, America literally set bunch states bound together federal government. much split Germany is. First China. 

Later, stupidity. I'm people great CT, states breaking stereotypes stupidity ive seen news NJ people may walking around masks going about. Flirida different level theyre partying like crazy clubs packed people seem giving rest. Yup, went bakery yesterday open last week, sign door said closed due covid issue I'm sure spread protests, city tell mask wearing probably close 95 percent more. seem completely ignorant older people degrade point where, unfortunately, simply need round-the-clock professional care. would good perception brought line reality though, rahter trying bring reality line perception. Apple doesnt store movement profile mother also works one ‚Äúnursing‚Äù homes. They‚Äôre absolutely terrible told me. 
She went inside one resident‚Äôs rooms find passed floor. literal hours. Upon asking coworkers help, took long enough someone finally take peek room help out. It‚Äôs disgusting. 

Also know soon die one rooms remove body room. even week later already another patient bed waiting thing. care making profit dying body ready send next person room died who‚Äôs sort health issue well. 

She told gets old take nursing home. knows damn well coworkers treat patients like shit, she‚Äôll get exact treatment. Far 80% shoo absent moderate symptoms. Double walking pneumonia fever 4 months would still qualify moderate. tell this, department play role standardising SOP pandemic response country? coordinating shutdowns, lockdowns reopening? distributing medical equipments supplies? past four months following news, literally see zero mention department. know far back, considering nyc situation would pretty obvious. suprise though already December though. Unless vegan there's reason to, since can't contract flu like symptoms intestines Particularly ones South. also part problem. Okay, propose a, say, child take care surviving parent middle-stages alzheimers, poor mobility?

What do? who? themselves? (nobody forced go out).

There scenario taking risks Corona effects you. None.  Unlikely. we‚Äôd seeing correlated cities/states largest protests. US hasn‚Äôt stringent lockdown. US started lifting lockdown measures without quashing first wave, making lockdown fairly pointless noy dragging whole thing Man wish could get sister board science.

She's still convinced fake virus test run New World Order see far lock us revolt REAL war coming! I‚Äôd take parents. Even though would lose job (sole income, live alone) unlikely get another easily passed, whether three years twenty. Dad pension could cover mortgage groceries live together.

Many people don‚Äôt option. they‚Äôre struggling pay rent little savings taking parent means quit job? Many, many elderly people conditions require hours care time per day near constant presence nearby help. can‚Äôt spending 65 hours per week working/commuting/taking care needs. Especially don‚Äôt live many-person household.

I‚Äôd take parents. one form dementia soon require constant professional 24/7 supervision due possible violent episodes impulse control escalating mobility issues five foot tall physical strength assist with. option works us local care facility visiting often assist monitor.

This country‚Äôs euthanasia laws unbearably cruel. allowed option choose peaceful ending instead years slow painful terrible decline. know parents want, they‚Äôve talked it. üßì think might UK new cases sum European countries combined. number cases overall new cases I'll check heard radio. Europe took seriously. America continues treat like joke threatens people's liberties. Take seriously guys virus taking America seriously friends bringing newborn baby beer gardens, uh, stay classy Oregon. youngsters really need hard data many people wear masks wear correctly I‚Äôd also like know view sweat evaporates differently different environments.  idiot mayor took responsibility away organization experience sort thing gave another entity, reasons never deigned explain.

Living NYC makes want scream. No, pleasure true, honestly, location China, China, Italy. Every location plenty warning could see unfolding areas. im disputing that. Bolsonaro wants run riot. Kill indigenous leaders, take land, rape forests. leader shrugs shoulders says ""What want it?"" (direct quote Covid 19) know hard time. 25 year old adult born US, want go U.K. live. went restaurant yesterday contactless ordering. Basically scan barcode phone view menu, order pay phone. thought brilliant reduce workers risk. Oh yeah? Where'd hear that? Breitbart? sounds excellent. catch? also cold there.

Also pretty much everything open germany. mass events aren‚Äôt happening Yeah, it‚Äôs easier whack one two moles, keep control rather thousand moles popping literally everywhere time. Duh weeks ago reopening Amercian south tagged good news. Amerdica üôä similar thoughts first, kind bad choice words headline ask me, realized it‚Äôs EVEN AMERICA... still good analogy, nearly inflammatory there. true all. Viruses need living cells replicate. unlikely get sick food. need masks public transport England lower average age infection may prevent retesting prior highs.

Do evidence case? I've seen governor two say without giving us actual data (like DeSantis). would seem looking explanations virus getting worse there, see meat would spread it. Practice good food handling precautions cooking properly kill anything. 

Unless wet market situation, would make sense china. governments took risky decisions based presumptions danger understood well all.

Because 'muh economy' people happily reelect even caused thousands deaths cause 'nobody could known'  remember vaping hospitalizations occurred last year, hear more? often wonder could related. Go vegan goodness sakes. Enough nonsense. easy vegan. virus Come from? important factors, keeping distance. course helps, effective step.

Less 5% wears masks Denmark, never recommended. Many densely-packed places massive public transportation usage done relatively well however, like Seoul, South Korea San Francisco. 

So there's obviously LOT that. lot ask. Everyone wants debate specific science, selfishly. everyone takes bunch little precautions, adds effective response, hard, makes feel good contributing community solution. 

I'm sure place still takes flak their, ""well lost business"" tards. Obviously... hope yeah, fall numbers way everyone thinks thing gone. January february march again. Anot nobody locking again. country safe, countries safer US. It‚Äôs weekend. That‚Äôs reporting works. Every weekend reporting delayed starts back Monday Tuesday. Actually institute studies ME/CFS fibromyalgia (nor psychosomatic illness). know lot stigma disease. stigma strong post-covid patients also told head probably anxiety, despite fact healthy people getting along life fine hit. said another comment, common almost everyone ME/CFS.

So main symptom (that also seen post-covid patients) post-exertion malaise - basically body freaks get onslaught symptoms much. much could brushing teeth, taking walk, going work days (depending severity illness). 

This actually makes easy rule depression, depressed people usually lose interest activity, don‚Äôt push crash cycles see ME. people overdo good day desperate get back normal, pay dearly afterwards. 

For example, last crash happened little better tried exercise bit. very, gentle stretching (all seated reclined) made 10 days decided throw low impact core-stregthening exercise. 

That night, woke around 4am severe tachycardia, chills, low grade fever, severe body wide pain (in sick get bed fainted trying get bathroom). resting heart rate 95-105 24 hours, took week feel somewhat ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again. month ago acute symptoms disappeared, still well attempting daily exercise. 

Does look like depression you? (or millions patients around world) could simply get better diet, exercise, talking therapist, taking antidepressants - don‚Äôt think would have? 

Sorry writing long comment, misinformed ideas illness patients facing decades, post-covid patients face now, really change. matter one bit video conferencing far states apart compact country is? fact compact country arguably worse containing keans probably can‚Äôt isolate clusters easily denser regions. true long time. Pick recent big story go read different news sites. bias shown depiction ""facts"" disgustingly obvious. Every mainstream media org took sides long time ago. dont see another shutdown happening unless hospitals fill up. Like actually fill up. trucker came napkin rubber band middle hold face. Except left part viruses unusually long incubation period fact deaths happening two weeks longer exposure. 

The fact cases rise again, long enough deaths hit. wait longer get data increase cases affects deaths. No...like weave small gauge wire fabric. I'm going link fuck them, I'm giving free exposure, almost certainly YouTube. fine. people cautious regular summer nobody's hiding inside. less people it‚Äôs easier manage maintain still dumb people everywhere. Give another 2-3 weeks. super spreading events reopening economies bring new deaths. unfortunate truth. Lol stop travel scare everyone. Obama Ebola. People cough sneeze can't really help distance going help spread it. That's real govt looks like. Must days old, we‚Äôre back 30k new cases day. 

The difference measured competent, national level responses. sort response somehow offensive one man‚Äôs ego. ""firmly believe"" things absolutely zero evidence for. unto others Metro areas include cities though? article doesn‚Äôt say, addition fact old people die whatever, could died something like covid induced heart attack know possible, link wasn‚Äôt made cause death. It‚Äôs probably mix larger population. Interesting use Good News flair Hawaii, everything shut people taking lockdown relatively seriously months. Recently, went back city coast living months spend nights friend there. Bars back open, restaurants dine-in service required operate something like 25%-50% capacity social distancing, they‚Äôre still OPEN.

I‚Äôve watched Instagram stories friends still flocking bars there‚Äôs single mask sight. I‚Äôve career bartender last seven years I‚Äôm done permanently reckless. disconnect people think end world good excuse drink WhiteClaws karaoke never greater

How become political issue again? It‚Äôs criminal. 38 states go, +8618 day.

assuming 7500 come Tx CA 16118. 35 average 400 cases 30,000. no, healthcare professionals recovers patients described mild symptoms 


-Fever common. fever often (but always) high, reaching beyond 100.4¬∞F. last many days, few. everyone spoke fever, though. 

-Tiredness weakness severe. People report unable stay awake sleeping 20 hours day. 

-Loss appetite, loss smell, loss taste common symptom. Many people say force eat drink. 

-Nausea, diarrhea, both, often experienced. people symptoms once; others get whole time unwell. 

-Muscle aches, especially upper body neck, common. Headaches, too. 
Some runny nose sore throat. 

-Not many folks mild (or early) COVID-19 cough shortness breath. 

-It often takes full 10 14 days feel well again, sometimes more. Wearing masks one thing, stage I'd like see people key states actually accept virus real thing appropriate precautions need taken. article heavily involves animal agriculture That‚Äôs conspiracy theory dude. Arizona counting antibodies tests. Florida contact tracing hot spot testing. Texas one day half cases came prison. aren‚Äôt conspiracy theories. cold hard facts fail see don‚Äôt fit narrative [Yes sick 2 week January. Severe shortness breath ( felt like couldn‚Äôt climax full breath always felt like fighting air) mild cough fever 102. Lasted 7 days.

Iv never flu shot diagnosed flu. migraines younger Iv never sick. Sick enough miss birthday stay bed literally 7 days. really think early January live Mississippi. dorove street city thought narrow sidewalk packed. go near there. something similar late November feel like maybe weaker strain evolved Covid-19 noticed identified. boss follows mask policy implemented halfheartedly. Like wear desks we're stationary sneeze guards coworker cough sneeze station cover mouth okay says allergies. mean stop pandemic country like India

By proactive. Ramping testing facilities feb, people saying can't stopped india due population density, ones take actions time situation started get worse. government saying early march corona threat india. pandemic always big threat India, population density thing. People US need less selfish. life, lives others too.  one hand, Covid deadly virus


But other, know boring stay home nothing access world's entire library knowledge entertainment? sure people surprised everyone given cautious:

What u think would happen MSM politicians told us perfectly fine gather 100000s protest? kind message u think sent MSM still reports protests caused much spread. course people going see green light whatever want. masks cause hypercapnia severe medical effects. UK worse coronavirus right US. TBH, know ""education"" lack thereof problem. discipline. People want wear mask inconvenience them. ""it work"" tell sleep night.

We saw thing seat belts kid. education much making violation go without wearing one, just...people getting used it. talking suppressing virus itself? concept idea virus? US world leader latter. get older looking person go undercover around places. Document treatment big issue lot people, mainly healthcare, know bad people refuse listen anyone experience it. Lol it‚Äôs pride US moment, point starting equate US flag hate it‚Äôs almost always accompanied trump flags around (welcome Ohio). closed house week ago first thing take American flag. moved Europe USA love every single day I'm Funny say Mikhail Prokhorov ran mines using slaves let dude owner while.

But yeah shared private prisons use slave labor.

Some part investment firms fund slave labor around world.

Some like Devos scam artist.

But massive amount power capital NBA owners collectively have?

Are claiming Billionaires make ownership circle power? Oi, look. There's bloke again. 'Ere,' eave 'arf brick at' I'm. Let's real, New Yorker, probably wouldnt made difference. annoyed realize conspiracy theorist. really Europe different America. Good know people suck everywhere see dr every three months due medication take course vitals visit. oxygen always 100%, last visit like ten days ago little more, 97%. 
I episode recently took kids walk alway do, whole time huge struggle me, hurt every muscle, chest fire, couldn‚Äôt get air, kept thinking ‚Äúam medical emergency heat?‚Äù otherwise good shape.
Finally got home husband checked fever erratic heartbeat.
He cooled kept water full stuff got bit better, still feel effects that. Harder take walks them, stairs laundry like marathon, hard time breathing outside could humidity get weather every year don‚Äôt get like this.
I want call inhaler, like mask five min gasping air.

So oxygen thing concerns me. buy one things? dont want go doctor get checked time I‚Äôm concerned.
Corona normal me. still remember goal ""flatten curve."" goal, course, overrun hospitals. seems like we're panicking (expected) increase cases, despite hospitals wholly underrun now, forecast exceeding capabilities. No, memorial day weekend week followed it. expect see even larger jump cases week next protests. Ive seen takes average 3 weeks sde true numbers (june 14 3 weeks Memorial day) up

who? Disney, NBA? Sweden? didn‚Äôt lockdown strategy

And ended worst mortality rate continent. Nearly worst entire planet, despite previously comparatively healthy, we‚Äôll-off population robust well funded universal health care system.  

And gave us grand champion hall fame statement never want hear public health minister: ‚ÄúWe surprised deaths.‚Äù  Honestly there‚Äôs nothing do, people crowded together social distancing measures delay inevitable. Even everyone trying staying home, super crowded scene streets filled crowds. tried strict lockdown even grocery shopping crazy packed event like lining amusement parks. China, least mass majority people isolate properly lock imposed. possible India. best hope treatment, vaccine try save economy covid cannot stopped anyway. Everyone wins one covid-19! experiment proposed impossible carry statistical significance. guest try making claim. Good lord dude... Well yeah...we need our...fuckin...pineapples? grandma. sometimes directly listen. people, genuinely hope get it. least Britain, BLM's policies ""protect black lives"" seem almost exactly policies left wing Labour party campaigning course several years, comprehensively rejected general election last December.

And includes lot things ostensibly race, ""dismantling capitaIism"" (replacing what?)

BLM UK seems Jeremy Corbyn Momentum again. time even emotional blackmail accusations racism anyone disagrees.

If can't win democratically, suppose hold country hostage putting us risk deadly disease get want. Dude, go outside. little Vitamin good. using pandemic excuse skirt ""phase 1"" trade deal obligations buy american agricultural article completely ignores question reports China's action without critical analysis.

It's SCMP, ""loyal opposition"" outlet CCP tolerates report CCP considers western line without reflection thinking. point wearing mask protects others unverifiable claim cannot proven disproven thus science. surgery"" completely american term.

Not really. Germany, postponed ""non-necessary"" surgery. included potentially life-saving cancer treatment. bet nobody complaining ""freedom"" Maybe weren‚Äôt kneeing people‚Äôs necks virus wouldn‚Äôt spread again. No, that's correct. Again, *is* Dept. Health Human Services, right now, job properly. That's Department existing. MLB pulling spring training there. team go back city. Ditto AZ spring training. mean know everyone getting infected seems dumb. seem par original goal I‚Äôm hospital social worker unfortunately cases time. 

Want add houseless/poor people actually qualify Medicaid funding placement long term care home. qualifying physical needs high needs, able go toilet without assistance another person, able eat food set another person, ambulate without help another person. I‚Äôve countless patients poor houseless desperately need placement meet high standards. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs different different states, state quite liberal good Medicaid insurance coverage. 

Most folks end either struggling readmitting hospital can‚Äôt care themselves, relying heavily family others free care, getting worse falling lack care. also tactfully ignore anti-mask protestors argument earlier. yes too. American got back living Europe:

Not wearing mask public fined Yeah, Americans starve without pre-packed salad. moved UK US. hate politics I‚Äôll admit like higher salaries afforded excellent quality life.

That said, I‚Äôm fully aware it‚Äôs built house cards come tumbling moment due lack safety net here. Hypercapnia risk wearing mask could lead death. children educated? thing often times people unable provide care parents need without sacrificing jobs/family. lot elderly folks dementia 24/7 needs - can't bathe/eat/go bathroom own.

&amp;#x200B;

Not defending either side, think cut dry may seem. Yes. US, politicians made mask wearing political issue cases actively suppressed medical advice professionals.

So mean, choose, I'd probably choose getting medical advice politicians, assuming means *step fuck way allow medical professionals speak*. also hit US way later europe. plenty areas US already suppressed virus. heard that's US testing much. No, mean pretty much bunch different countries bound together much weaker central government. fact, even used refer ""the United States"" plural (e.g. ""these United States are..."") rather singular used today (e.g. ""the United States is..."").

Over time, Federal government gained power country became unified, even so, there's still times coordinating states also coordinated responses doesnt mean exactly response everywhere

Coordinating response 50 states timely manner would require Federal government act overseer. I'm sure seen yourself, current president interested this. He'd rather pretend there's problem help reelection chances. sure people surprised everyone given cautious:

What u think would happen MSM politicians told us perfectly fine gather 100000s protest? kind message u think sent MSM still reports protests caused much spread. course people going see green light whatever want. Actually US media owned one company deeply tied US political agenda, nice words. take throat swabs suspected Covid deaths send lab tests nasal swabs. result guaranteed negative. Ok what's new excuse? Im sensing pivot towards ""only young people getting die"" last two weeks people die. Lmao already furiously backpedaling bullshit nonsense.

C-19 deaths per million:
628 U.K
606 Spain
572 Italy
500 Sweden
454 France
-
369 U.S.

Oops...facts match media narrative. Right, said, US Ministry Health, effectively making state separate country context pandemic response. People literally saying 2 weeks last 3 months paranoia, brain adapting considering things never consider before. Look IL. Massive protests, spike, high mask compliance. People falling randomly plausible, consider anything took place Wuhan. 

When videos started coming Wuhan real outbreak elsewhere, certainly something keep open mind about. entirely reasonable assume could symptom COVID. COVID 19 hit everywhere, countries far deaths Wuhan, far free social media. yet sources happening sketchy videos early on, repeated since.

Yes, could speculate might happen, plausible mechanisms. ignore fact evidence outside Wuhan happened. feature even minority COVID cases, seen evidence outside unverified early videos now. Yup people going regardless manage risks based Well leaders US trying suppress virus ignoring &amp; hoping goes away  Two weeks huh plot twist, gets mugged everytime hes london Low cases begin with. Social distancing far fetched. Also far epicentre. sure China Finland emigration like, bet lower European average? Wow. person argued stopping travel would bad thing.

Amazing lengths you‚Äôll go order defend Fauci. yes people need wear masks here. Unfortunately think ""take care first others come next"". whole situation makes embrassed american president goes TV says racist, absurd, crass, sexist comments remarks makes. He's reason people wont wear masks. recall seeing public mask on. blame falls completely shoulders blundering pandemic fucking bad. need rules enforce masks fucking bad. AmeRiCAn ExCepTIoNaliSm think idea bogus s/o shows paper abt SARS-CoV-2-protein excretion urine. Depends person‚Äôs immune system. 

I COVID-19 February. got antibody test month came back negative. Either antibody test lame longer immunity.

Sorry workers us us boat Lmao yeah, cause you‚Äôre totally qualified handle someone dementia, Alzheimer‚Äôs, extremely difficult diseases elderly suffer from. 75% America lives paycheck paycheck yet shit people trying make living. Wildly dumb superiority complex got. 

And yeah, life important. career, goals, money. long gone I‚Äôll still dealing repercussions. Ding ding ding! winner Bob, tell what's he's won! Absolutely worrying. Even Health officials government got fired putting science first. Alright drama queen answer question. obviously oppose care homes outright. I'll ask again: propose a, say, child lives apartment take care surviving parent middle-stages alzheimers, poor mobility? always told. never said getting infected. Everyone supposed get infected eventually, today. find ""doom,"" think that's reasonable goal. Finding ""tamiflu""-like equivalent would save many lives, actual possibility, whereas vaccine much difficult terms process, provision public, etc. lot hope something minimizes impact virus. made deadly, actually ""sniffles,"" eliminate danger. Buttery males. fun, short Juice Media video found excellent also,  Good. need bananas. maybe come diffrent experience. Happy discuss. see diffrent do? Well there's huge outbreak North America meat processing plants china serious containment unlike US. leave stone unturned risk adverse covid19 Enroll system profits abuse neglect customers, obviously! 128 cases lombardy 53 identified blood tests. Many regions adopting blood test screenings communicate many identified using kind testing.

It worth note ""identified blood testing"" means people tested positive blood test successive mandatory swab. Could climate related. Alaska US get nearly much spread, cold there. u would care look graphs see virus-induced rises excess-mortality. dont wanna look find yourself. Thats problem ;-) interesting see saying European Union include Ireland. sadly stopped pride American years ago. love country, imagine like parent drug addict loves child. agonizing watch, there's much without destroying well.

I hope figure someday soon. said plant shut time mass testing event test results began come days later ‚Äì leaving workers tested positive COVID-19 job possibly spreading virus employees.   personally pull three employees floor tell results positive.  
  proper thing shut place tests came back,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúKeep positives home bring workers back.‚Äù  also upset plant didn‚Äôt shut deep cleaning results back -- 230 employees total tested positive, quarter plant‚Äôs workforce.

I mean .. come on. Jesus, Rat Utopia experiments playing real life.

They everything need survive, choose die anyways. diabetic jumps bridge, cause death still diabetes? People dumb. change. Remindme! 2 weeks defend argument. Go read thread. don‚Äôt need defend multiple comments article. that. first called names wasn‚Äôt true moved goalposts said insulted you. 

I didn‚Äôt insult you. spoke truth. Children need guided told look things read. looked beyond comment replied to, would see defense. fact showed patience child immediately jumping conclusions without reading everything funny, ironic.  can't, plan.

We can't lock everyone down, food supply chains, economy would completely break.

We've months prepare open safe like countries done threw time away. on/off switch US need dimmer. That's different Chinese vaccine, Ad5-nCoV2.

Phase 3 start next month Brazil 9000 volunteers. Certainly. that‚Äôs place Spain hit much harder parts Europe lockdown measures stared ease. Especially Northern European countries hit less hard, people careless. keep hearing name. George Soros. probably look up. U.S seemed really lost plot here. 
As child wanted move U.S U.K. USA really doesnt want beaten brazil increasing infection effort Trump rebrand own... Hard know true mortality rate actually decreased. around 0.5-2% highly age-dependent. Certainly higher fraction infected people getting diagnosed. far tell, major reason apparent mortality rate drop. Chinese products ever known inferior? Even Chinese buy things overseas don‚Äôt trust products. Plus secrecy makes less trustworthy. would pay bills? solve problem people gonna stay home. going work cuz fun. &lt;!--INSTRUCTIONS
Replying Stresshead2501's comment:
 |Not seeing anyone careless live Spain.


Yesterday wanted smash maskless kids Euskotren. Possible, actual evidence yet. Plus, initial reduction movement wad correlated politics, mask wearing correlated politics, observing relationship increases movement COVID may suggest minimal relationship politically-related mask-wearing COVID.

I know driving factor here; primary commonality surging places warm weather locations hit hard initially. Maybe increased use air conditioning could something thread needle.  many people wearing masks Ireland yet we've still managed eradicate community spread. We've much severe lockdown US judging I've seen TV, shops opened last week bars, restaurants, hotels etc still shut sports, events gatherings still banned. 

The US half assed lockdown gave half way through, that's main difference even get that. compassion, remorse, sympathy dead them. statistics ignored long ""economy"" strong. US leadership explicitly takes responsibility murders citizenry. diseases also come back - syphilis, cancer, chicken pox comes back shingles.

The point given know little disease might good idea err side caution, commerce. ER tax. Hmm like week 20 states 10. I‚Äôm assuming 10 states gone back normal then? Weird. state allowed it, local government. rest town decided look way allow restaurants operate without following guidelines. actually two weeks, enough time see effects. Additionally, tables added gradually, really week sidewalks packed. 6k Tuesday plan exploit crisis nefarious goals along, like 5G microchip surveillance... NY deaths per million = 1600
Extrapolate 325mm population USA =500k deaths. think good?
NY worst outcome 50 states. killed thousands making executive order send positive cases nursing homes killed people. Cuomo failed. bad level vigorous analysis seem applied HCQ debate. blocked pretty similar far, no? Though probably change soon People dumbfucks. +3494 cases florida.  asthma.  find depends humidity. humid, easy wear mask, problems. harder humid.  


That said, I'm going stores, wear mask. find air conditioning, pretty easy breathe mask. medical testing doctor's appointments.  


I public transit yet since masks advised. next month doctor's appointments. wear mask.  


I get groceries delivered. wear mask get things delivered.  


I try get daily walk move around get exercise. Sometimes many people around. times, may share sidewalk.   
 humidity low enough I'll leave mask on.  


If humid, take there's one around, put back see I'm going cross paths someone. Though usually I'll walk street cross side that's option. Deaths deaths, matter country heart stop beating. ^^^s/ Yeah. Vitamin C seems miracle cure certain gullible crowd. Starting anti-vaxxers, homoempaths, econuts.. ending with, well ""covid19? flu""-folks. Floriduh many sacrifices necessary satisfy worship Mammon. friends deaths necessary Trump allies feed economy. one town? Pretty sure state new cases. posts also hilarious dumb people look! :D  


ie 'Wearing mask helps contain virus like 2 year old helps fixing things around house.' they'd probably fixed better kid help üòÇüòÇ United States Europe better American version? Increased testing time real effect ratio detected cases infections. need grow up. everything need spelled people act like adults use inference?

You insulted reason, properly defend argument. Make America Wear Masks government lied masks start. Yet anyone two brain cells could put two two together simply thinking critically asking: ‚Äúwhy doctors wear masks don‚Äôt work?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy countries Asia fare better US masking sick social norm universal masking policy pandemic?‚Äù Living NC, worse. Gov. Cooper constantly belittled slandered civilians want believe things like covid racism. Cooper fantastic, worth anything nobody listens I'm European live US, far got friends family one wearing mask, mom goes grocery shopping friends go don't, everybody pictures don't. confident yet Europe. hand California least half people wearing masks, least we're trying guess :-| Nah, we're putting 5G towers that.  First all, agree people wear masks. Netherlands, live, one wearing except public transportation mandatory - really everyone doesn‚Äôt. Apart that, don‚Äôt see stores supermarkets well frequented, terraces full, etc. guess overall people cautious fact large events remain cancelled lost people continuing work home works moment. 
Given lack mask discipline I‚Äôm worried second wave may hit us harder countries people actually wear wear. America built fight pandemics. People cool wear masks social distance. worried rights lockdown dumb leadership place point right direction. inevitability succumb it. architect Swedish policy admitted failure point least failings. Incredible public trust placed individual decided take spin see could evidence free way. 

By large epidemic experts leadership positions US like Fauci better. Fauci also lied thru teeth protect ""little people"" reality masks important early ""little people"" buy masks first responders needed. Problem lot people buy mask thing. devastating efforts control thing going forward. 

Mistakes made, dude. worries didn‚Äôt get asking. I‚Äôm saying New Zealand good job, aren‚Äôt best example compare countries they‚Äôre remote island big advantage. mentioned Canada say it‚Äôs possible even country bordering covid hotspot someone successfully created vaccine, company likely license companies mass produce we're reliant one manufacturer supply world. Swedish troll herd force downvoting again. get it, already achieved immunity - reason facts... would believed opened states seeing surge California seeing spike protests really prove protests consequences. Texas, spike happening major cities protests age groups participated protests.

We went people playing golf going beach kept mouth shut protests. look way protests big part spikes??? Well different cultures government borders. handled better US though. tell did. authoritarian psycho int white house. ok lol sorry Pssh, crazy scientists trying make connections using logic ""numbers"". 0 cases Easter , trump right along. ( Easter 2021, millions needlessly die). Agreed..instead outright lies said protect without not. need make sure healthcare workers equipped actually jobs. federal government really bad theirs...  Greed, cruelty, selfishness. persistently identify traits groups. consumed lies morality bankrupt. Congrats completely missing point. don‚Äôt know ins outs believe Medicaid Medicare. Hopefully someone knowledgeable chime believe 5 years can‚Äôt house name believe hiding assets. Many times older people reluctant sign house family member. time comes suddenly need go nursing home one wants give family home also can‚Äôt afford pay grandmas treatment either. think older people illusion adult children take work take care time comes children think find loophole get elderly person financial help still inherit family home. watched happen husband‚Äôs grandmas. don‚Äôt fault anyone uninformed works, observation. ""I love low information voters!"" Don‚Äôt take athlete. Take owner. amount athlete makes pennies owners. Wait, name call you? Yeah young ppl smokers. don‚Äôt smoke, remember 20 year old got lung transplant? lung black side, cause smoked... hope Reddit go take anxiety meds coward bad hospitals get overwhelmed rather proper response, call names?

Is simply can't defend saying?

Here, I'll add one thing here. Look headline. ""7th day upward trend"". shows still early upward trend. lot deaths. give time impatient. ""elective"" c-section insurance still paid? UK police even guns &amp; I've heard one many times officers afraid even arrest person color EU fear slapped racist label. protesters even know want either, places want abolish police. like climate change! shut control. quick tests (there ones developed that'd take 30min) incredibly powerful. test anyone entering state. Ugh, hate giving pearls swine especially like adamant remain ignorant goes. [Read learn]( stay stupid, show facts. believe them. Sorry. People keep saying happened NZ possible countries countries land borders. assumed that's saying. seems like saying less extreme version though. Gee, guess fact 3 vaccines stage 3 testing almost 0 bad news means nothing. disappointed come November released? Perhaps relates blood clotting cardio vascular issues ? don‚Äôt disagree one bit substance you‚Äôre saying, except say individualist, recognize collective good individual good odds. individualist, desire freedom happiness recognize society empowered cares other. 

These people individualists, informed ideology, driven coherent ethics, they‚Äôre happens infant psyche remains adulthood.

I blame parenting. still don‚Äôt believe asymptomatic people infectious symptomatic. would imagine catching virus asymptomatic person considerably less likely. 

I‚Äôm interested figuring makes someone asymptomatic carrier. Viral load? Immunity coronavirus infections? Partial
Immunity vaccines? Genetics? Blood type? Luck? Acceptable sacrifices right ancient god?

I suppose science trying figure too.  like people says ""mske america great again"" yet support guy lef country rhus shitshow made America joke eyes world. America , country used epitome expertise efficiency managing worse many developing countries far worse msin geopolitical rival. seem little odd ti you? Maybe slightly uninformed? breach trust China, mainly (in)transparent beginning. Even many frown upon fact china tries pin new outbrakes back west.

From scientific standpoint enaugh honor making vaccine sell west aint form trojan horse

in end would benifical like 2-4 diffrent vaccines everyone reacts diffrently diffrent medication also would make fast sustainable production saw poll recently 60-70% Americans would participate contract tracing. fucking doomed. 1. They‚Äôre still open. Anywhere still open getting outbreaks.
2. It‚Äôs packed people working line. 
3. machinery loud yell.
4. pay often bad middle nowhere workers live together car pool together too. city like new cases still won‚Äôt go gym wont b surprised doctors nurses first responders quit. listened ems calls cus hubby fireman voicee sound burnt out. county trying cover covid cases call heart failure fainting spells lately. using summer heat excuse ut total bull shit. haave many calls people falling r normallu healthy people. tellibg u area covering thhe truth. first responders probably catching lags make hard track. I‚Äôd try identify date mass exposure may begun start looking increased hospitalizations 21 days increased deaths 30+ days out. doctors Pittsburgh come said it. Also doctor new Zealand hope find injecting bleech putting torch ass also useless covid agent orange defund medical research want contradicted anymore. LOL Fortunately, live Spain UK. speak much. Bill Gates, 5G Judy Mikovits, gave basically. numbers still growing, super anxious seeing people already going reopening shit calming. pandemic people seem think means short term issues. speculate take years get rid it. feel like full opening cause go haywire. come greedy failed medics allowed make ""over top"" claims?  doctors, busted ass books 10 years, finally land job decent pay, gonna throw away idiots. Young nurses, yes might reconsider it. helps track number shoppers store, promotes physical distancing. know surfaces high risk, would ideal clean people close together indoors much worse. me, too! contact tracing us? infected people really people contact notified? Make sure getting enough vitamin d. Super important. I‚Äôd love see statistic number people called work months leading known infections Maybe anxiety issue Hi. future. Half million 9 million vast majority...? 1/18. Lets scale up.... 120 million would 6.7 million dead. fucking acceptable. many individual lives can't traded ""muh vast majority fine"". Sorry leaving restrictions something academic would advice yet it.... work. noticeable hit lungs HARD. Normally don‚Äôt get sort build lungs time tons mucus one day gone. pre sickness stats hadn‚Äôt returned gyms closed American culture worships individuals, free thinkers, vigilantes, personal power community spirit. decades celebrating ""you're boss me!"" attitudes, outcome. saying countries Western countries known free press ended controlling flow information tightly China? Sounds little implausible. heading Orange Park towards downtown left? I‚Äôve lived short time- sorry! one marquee-looking ones anyone rent say whatever want weeks. cold environment, virus alive really, really long time. Right. Unverified rumors wthout video Seattle, videos Iran, yet another country context hard verify. videos countries relatively free media. given number cases. need cite statistic healthy 18 year olds die covid? reading anything this? basically almost 0% chance death due Covid  feels like society ""moved on"". Wtf? still serious issue imo. people think? Same, think there's chance people taking serious change realize full scope aftermath here? Surely people able ignore scale it? -.- sucks everyone who's joining shitty club way, obviously. Go tell ur colleague Wendy's. take off? lol seen protests riots? Always knew app precursor 5G surveillance... simply calling home... :-) use time unionize. understand nothing don‚Äôt see necessary. thirty day shut mandatory masks everywhere stay home order would nipped pandemic bud....but Americans stupid medically correct things. media went hard originally went away protests they‚Äôre unable get people back never vaccine. best hope treatment turns hospital visits stay home cases. US can‚Äôt far behind either. Traffic fatalities aren‚Äôt concern larger effect lifespan, even though fewer deaths. Illuminati know setting is, disable it. grandmother got sick. Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia. would randomly drive places forget was. take car away. 
It death sentence older independent woman. eventually put home give constant care needed. 
She pushed aggressive resident, hit head went coma. Never came out. 
Of course place completely lied covered up. 
My mother found year later friend also relative mentioned grandmother pushed hit head. 
Fuck scammy places. Explain cases south west rising alarming rates mid-Atlantic (with mask mandates) seeing cases steadily trending downward. Right, seems likely coronavirus hastened demise, even outward signs infection. Android iPhone I've read lot assumes social distancing masks. I'm curious unmasked diners within two feet either side increase risk. Well.. that's great, thanks! It‚Äôs conspiracy. Big Collapse Industry moving Corona. Great idea send patients back nursing homes like Cuomo... important question remains.

Roma Lazio? Already happened twice (see Death Total Graph one June 16

The recent one clearly visible since linear scale earlier ones around May 3 May 29 Kind vanish) like people really try hardest look way front deadly pandemic, much break necks trump supporters, better. wrote page long lecture india stuck past, yada yada yada. And, support modi, person whose propoganda hindu, muslim. party suggest urine cure brag past. irony Post-Britney bitches way better correct. paper masks even good really. kind mix things person.  touch surfaces constantly touched public care. washing hands much. hobbies speak of, main goal getting back eating restaurants.  sent Erin Bromage link specifically mentioned airflow restaurants portion - almost zero interest. people merely passing diners, don‚Äôt see problematic. addition outside transmission extremely low, minimal contact two people also drives risk. one study University Utah found suburban areas riskier COVID-19 urban Darwin never contemplated idiots like these. growing control, again.

Great example: [Geniuses Charge Like flatantly touted refusal enforce quarantine, . . . . *drum roll* . . . . diagnosed Covid-19 Yes Yes although moment, encounter, believe fever. temperature never rose 99 F feel feverish moment. natural explanation scenario would like night terrors awake. looked (the demonic entities) face looked me. understand sounds people accept supernatural. would personally laughed claim happened. world seems illusion choose interpret. Everything ambiguous enough offer choice explanation. personally gets timing events, again, interpretation understand makes sound some. Hahahahahaha.

I disagree assumption masks mitigate spread virus Hopkins makes, I'm glad recognized study utter nonsense.

Scoreboard still reads:

*Studies proving efficacy masks general public: 0.*  problem statistics nursing homes people generally health longer allows live own, without form assistance. There‚Äôs long list things could contributed deaths, even something simple losing press given bleak things look perspective. Thots Players I‚Äôm impressed Campaign decided ignore good optics big crowd opt responsible, partial capacity venue. truly fight COVID-19 together! know collapsed yet. seems strange place find random collapses unverified vids Wuhan. Yes. scary, unfortunate won‚Äôt spread virus committed wearing face mask, getting tested respiratory symptoms staying home pending results, staying home 2 weeks test comes back positive.

So factor decision making assessment risk. don‚Äôt feel risk level high enough go hyper OCD mode over. tear gas pepper spray hit crowd whole lot people feeling soon. averaging like 20k cases day like what, week ago?  plenty time see Fourth July Events go, Nascar event 15th July Labor Day. find hard imagine event size able happen couple months considering bad things going get many states going refuse lock wear mask pollen gotten first place... appears low. four 10,000. ""This free country! told wear mask want wear them! rights must respected! cannot force me! Hey, guy wearing mask! Get him!"" Someone make bot default response everytime thread like pops up.I swear seen exact comment couple posts/comments. No..this dangerous infections scale, going see young people die. mean risk level changed average young person. Olympics committee announced day trading added summer games. ""6.7 million dead beer buddies acceptable me!"" race revive ssi correct. loses effectiveness there's lots people wearing masks.

At time, help keep touching face... helps getting sick bunch stuff accepting infected individual essentially death sentence rest people care.. fact pushing agenda thats dangerous OFC? da fuck would fight imbeciles?? aint showing irl truly appreciate country gone Australia response 19 new infections: State Emergency.

Murika response 30,000 new infections: Grand Reopening Denny's! think mean we'd fall exact model switch meat plants, higher demand plant products would require way bigger production volume (think 20x packed spinach processed, ready cook tofu/chickpeas/etc)

I 100% believe there's logic behind plant-based/less carnivore lifestyles, also believe society ready it. mean can't/won't get there. can't fix consumer habits we've developing 100 years one year even one decade. think it‚Äôs generally proven odds catching walking someone outside astronomically low. hi! Huh?Don't spread false news talking ass,people like reason one takes virus seriously.Delhi example positivity rate 30%(high positivity rates found many districts even testing rates low) .Our positivity rate whole spiked 4% something Maharashtra also positivity rate 13.7%.  ""Common sense"" dictates traces. traces found protesters, generally cognizant social distancing usually wear masks, main focal points new infections.

But guess Common Sense beyond someone using CavemanLogic.  Yes. tried finding place near (in Major US city) get tested options sim since symptoms, Dr. referral, I‚Äôm 30‚Äôs. shouldn‚Äôt difficult get tested. disagree, look latest numbers RIVM really seems control. testing 11000 people per day 0.9% positive. 29% peak. words jam sentence less makes sense generally speaking. wrote substance. looks like cobbled together bunch phrases heard regarding topic. Here's Alabama's latest chart cases deaths (from CDC tracker leveling here. defend Americans bit here, insurance company billed 1.1 million. person question likely pay couple thousand that, may even covered federal Flor said he‚Äôs hyper-aware somebody paying million-dollar bill ‚Äî taxpayers, insurance customers on.

To give comparison, grandfather died sepsis hospital six weeks. regular care, ventilator anything laying bed sleeping getting fed waiting either get better get worse. total bill insurance company ‚Ç¨100k. pay small deductible.

I'm sure grandfather needed intensive care ventilator 60 days would've gotten bill hundreds thousands euros. yea shit. news? 'muh masks' virus ran course EU, hence pretty high death count. Nobody wears mask netherlands, goes uk, france etc Ahh glory years Mariners. Wish could least gotten world series back then. year probably single greatest season Mariners. wild see anyone could think positively handling this.

It's actually really easy see. take word everything. 

If listen preferred news channels, travel ban saved millions! (Never mind, 40k US citizens allowed back in, never min applied 1 nation virus care borders...)

He'll tell he's great job. He'll tell people would worse. 

And trust he's team, hes one voted for, must true! I‚Äôm embarrassed living US hundred year pandemic travel bans? Insignificant isnt math.. opinion... dont you.. completely Tbh wanting move U.S U.K. Ik guys also lots political problems though moved US Germany love boat. think would worthwhile spend time reflecting salaries Europe lower despite better, average education infrastructure. 

One thing harder start business Europe regulation. However, think biggest issue still fractured market, especially consumer products. biggest contributor imo multitude languages. probably crazy thought many, think need consolidate that. seems radical, hey I'm totally different country believe large part that. wife speak German, Germany want option call salaries much better here. think unifying language would go long way addressing also prevent brain drain fact night bring skilled workers Europe learn language would likely learn school spoken countries.  live die hard trump town California. went local place last night pick dinner, PACKED. social distance, one mask there, except mine. expect end outbreak. People (UK) straight mostly refuse wear them. afraid looking silly fitting walnut-brains they're prepared risk life.

The thing cool lying coffin body temperature. - New cases tests administered 1-7 days ago: +2,409 (92.9%)
- New cases tests administered 8-14 days ago: +71
- New cases tests administered 15-21 days ago: +20
- New cases tests administered 22 days ago: +92 

Current peak 2,729 last Monday manually tracked data ""Confirmed Cases Day"" tab AZDHS site. Graphs second tab.

I added trend graph PCR positivity third tab. **We gone 5% positive cases month ago around 17% now**. Toronto bad yet. wish people wore masks stores TTC still empty things arent opening.

The beach things bad least thats safest place expose one‚Äôs self. Actually rather worse even looks.  
New York places initially hard-hit achieved degree control comparable Europe numbers masking near exponential growth states. present infection rates, example, Texas Florida run ICU beds two weeks time. reasonable expect large spike mortality. 
I would guess late anything stop spread states rushed people back ""normal"" heading horrifying numbers casualties. We'd totally clear we'd test less. guarantee cases drop dramatically know stop testing.

Never gon' stop /s-ing, though. said perspective infectious disease ‚Äúexpert.‚Äù sound medical advice perspective even pandemic happening.

And spare ‚Äúcontext admin‚Äù nonsense. still job. He‚Äôs openly disagreed President number times. even somehow lying ‚Äústay position,‚Äù good do, anyway? We‚Äôre still are.

No, Fauci opposing travel bans, encouraging cruises *anyone,* discouraging masks point saying cause *more harm,* calling threat minuscule well freaking trade advisor intelligence agencies begging President something ‚Äúisolated statements.‚Äù actually points incompetence. Yeah, where‚Äôs click bait truth? Journalism 101 baby!!! link literally says first infections linked wet market. dont know certain, said, that's experts think.

But cool, condescending prick it. think restricting interstate travel necessary states act somewhat coherently. germany also restrict interstate travel fine. 

The european union kind power generate response include stopping interstate travel. little union Here's Texas chart cases deaths time. Note 7-day rolling average deaths, really come down:

 clusters reappaering there. Nothing worry according authorities virus indeed still there. 

As soon lower guard (which LOT people doing) there. 

Don't think supressed. Keep protecting others (for next year maybe). Oregon horrible testing almost impossible go anywhere terms tests. mostly impossible get test unless significant symptoms traced back confirmed infection. 

And now, Oregon horrible social distancing going escalate quickly. People good month they're done giving shit here. People wearing masks, bars following 6 foot distancing guidelines, etc. happening Indiana Kentucky. shop early little possible. people truly scare elderly seem either welcome death believe happen them. US also highest job losses.as well.

Performing worse economic health metrics. says someone live India .

Okay watch youtubers Melbourne understand big deal things different awhile, behave accordingly. feel precious rare see rational response basic facts. political tug-of-war Americans turn everything embarrassing.  Shhhh, media isn‚Äôt used *not* able push false narrative true. 

They‚Äôre still figuring objective reality clear day look new case count graphs states surging. never big spike mar/apr/may. remove state lines look new case graph entire US clearly looks like acceleration first wave defined break inbetween.

'do live europe? family one careless'

'you can't use family's anecdotal evidence say nobody europe careless'

'you can't think talking family'

Uh derp derp derp - can't say 'nobody' Europe careless based fact family members live Europe, weirdo. get called exactly posted derp acting like people can't read. Stay Reddit. America large country different local governments. Italy suffered 57 deaths per 100k, Texas 7 deaths per 100k. 

11/50 US states worse/similar numbers Italy. best states America handled virus pretty well far, reason rude. Texans run migrant working conditions get us every time.

How many cases caused? someone know gets really sick/dies. they'll listen beg others wear masks get vote. Elementary schools open 7 weeks here. Restaurants limited seating 3 weeks. Masks never focus (Netherlands)

Cases still falling (positive tests, hospitalizations, deaths).

People work home practical, distancing  so-so public get impression us limiting social contact few.friends.ot family.

I'm curious happens fall similar behaviors place, cases increase fall think support reintroduction restrictions.. Maybe vaping? /s render unelectable immediately. reality nothing happen.  Well here, wering mask political statement, hear something constitution nonsense. ""it's law""

 let take US deal idiots ignorance there, hell yea itd good ass reset. see lots masks spain italy. Besides countries, wont see them. netherlands, literally nobody wears one Coronavirus big deal monitor hospitalization headline pretty stupid read article. Maybe personal interpretation read like Texas set record either number hospitalizations day percent increase day. record number people hospitalized. kind stands reason record going broken every day week patients released. like looking amount active cases. I'm 50-60% full train Switzerland moment seen exactly one person wearing mask. really? people say line good logic? 

More cases means much worse thought handle properly. headline doesnt sell That's believe little something called Freedom here. virus free go wherever wants. tread virus. Fuck knows undeniable truth downvoted still asking people participated protests? mention article. Sir, chicken allowed grocery store. also keep protesting , holding huge gatherings, lot recuse anything Gov directly tells Especially 70  dumb? Ultimately everyone infected unless vaccine developed, take year least unlikely. case fatality rate much lower initial predictions, bad. everyone presents fever. one going cold flu symptoms, period. Yeah Texas daycares day camps going place. social distancing (I mean going stop kids playing other?) masks (except sometimes teachers) haven‚Äôt heard one outbreak attributed them. Brazil's pretty I'm hard time finding now, Trump speech last night someone crowd passed taken fanned people around using campaign signs. wonder similar situation.. Trump really got excited ramp story Around (south Jersey) never see anyone without mask people know still staying home much possible. said... I'm sure helped somewhat affluent suburb people able work home, larger houses yards kids play in, etc. kids living apartment driving nuts I'd pretty tempted take park/playground too.

But mother somewhat compromised due age pre-existing health conditions, lives Wichita, KS. People actively flaunting political statement. firmly believe thing saving totally wiped damn spread everything is; pretty decent size city (over 400k metro area) nothing *feels* like city. Also nobody takes public transportation stores huge land cheap, social distancing happens accident rather design. Plot lost moment Trump got elected, although perhaps symptom deeper rot. Still, things seemed Obama's time office. take month. least. everyone infected goes public events. though. they‚Äôll infect people won‚Äôt know infected symptoms mild. people go infect others follow pattern mild cases. ones serious enough symptoms go get tested take time grow take month see surge. hear ones sick enough get tested. take longer first generation people get sick event. Surprise! Trump notoriously cheats golf, though.

He wants reduce testing, probably less testing means fewer confirmed cases. wants lower numbers, actually better. seems he's *already* treating pandemic like golf. Y'all better pray every state South decides lockdown.

Because even one doesn't, gets same-shaped curve lockdown states, jig lockdown. Many people seem think quarantine punished, something. really understand care real meaning locked wearing mask. Now, reopening, really counts everyone's responsibility common sense, i'm afraid we're fucked up. 'phase 1 reopening' means Covid gone, need wear mask, bars crowded! agree, it‚Äôs sad point people decided upon return normal it‚Äôs hard stop them. attitude people almost bad disease. government soft, learning close nothing neighbours south. follow along little bit slower. 

By factor population density faring better thus far. attitudes also suck, even without strong political ties trumps BS, surprising. People want normal badly without work it, we‚Äôre also cutting corners actions people..and know ends.

We‚Äôre slowly starting reopen wherever I‚Äôve gone, people heavily complying wearing masks, I‚Äôm hopeful case numbers continue stay low. think insurance companies denying necessary treatments fun US constant basis, you‚Äôre misinformed.  

It‚Äôs reality. closest thing seems like you‚Äôre describing old ‚Äúpre-existing‚Äù condition clause many insurance companies used deny claims trying say condition needing treatment already existed signed policy documents. That‚Äôs gone decade now. 

Nowadays claim gets rejected it‚Äôs usually relatively easily fixed clerical error paperwork hospital submits. Like submitting claim open heart surgery medical history submitted doesn‚Äôt show person ever heart condition diagnostic procedures performed would indicate need surgery. situation like course they‚Äôre going respond back questions approving couple million dollars reimbursement claim doesn‚Äôt add based data provided.

The negativity little mind-boggling. ""You don't"" bunch crap. it, need enough people.

Now, Texas Florida going employ enough it? Doubtful, thats different question ""How contact trace 34k people?"" 2 people probably perfect example covid died something else. live UK one 22 countries.

A ""symptom"" something perceived patient, headache. asymptomatic mean unwell, means *feel* unwell.

As said, damage life threatening still occurring, even patient feels perfectly fine. Someone showing signs disease (a ""sign"" objectively measurable indication disease), high blood pressure, without ever feeling symptoms associated it. Localized outbreak meat plant. Lots foreign workers infected. previous low numbers spikes R factor extreme. rest country numbers still declining. virus spread uniformly country. Lol please don‚Äôt overestimate stupidity American government. saying 9 southern states get bigger curves states locked (I mean, US never lockdown like European Asian countries, strict states shelter place best, states even close that) 1 state get big curve disproves everything 1 state. ask: would explain 9 states bigger curves states locked down?

Nope original study:  numbers mess question. person hospice really count COVID death? sound callous person already dying hospice.

Here's thing, vast majority experts think that's caused covid outbreak? cdc essentially infers given that's first cases found spread majorly there. possible covid given another person somewhere else somehow virus didnt propagate much? Sure. pandemic caused wet market best tell. dystopian age, people rather look good ""filthy"" fabric mask faces ruining make up.

I guess living safety made majority people underestimate dangers real world something like ""flu"" can't seen bad shown tv there's always Facebook oils heal conspiracy.. rate things going things predicted come, see schools colleges going online fall?

I'm curious precautions Disney taking ,other guests waive liability. Yeah, Germany main goal flattening curve get R0 1. Angela Merkel actually explained TV R0 means important 1. that's we're trying succeeded (at least now) - slowly open things back again, we're trying keep way.

The thing is, consistently 1, keep new cases steady amount, they're slowly approaching 0. would awesome. Well, Western world, no. remotely industrialized country penalizes working class making pay double countries pay healthcare, subsidize higher education (knowing number engineers scientists produce actually effects economy, preposterous bullshit stock market), safety nets experience sudden job loss health incident.

The mask point genuine criticism, applies public health agencies throughout western world. Saying Fauci ridiculous, particularly despite change advice point still admin refuses encourage use. mad Fauci masks, apoplectic trump, perhaps importantly mad pretty much every western official involved covid response.

Travel bans stop virus b/c (a) virus spread bans get considered (as know absolutely case), (b) can't ban return citizens, bring virus (c) would need universal. buy time, partial restrictions China matters something time. Trump admin nothing get ready weeks followed restrictions. 

The ""minuscule threat"" threat another disingenuous claim, I've already addressed.

This transparently deflecting blame Trump. fair, go happened Wuhan Italy. Scientists clairvoyant, best information had.



 easy point fingers high horse. Yeah gonna say, may totally different cultures, lot idiots. Oh. Canada probably easiest transition then. I'm glad he's okay. Seat belts however make sweat face especially summer country we're places AC easily high 80. Florida doesn‚Äôt give fuck never arr. Paris like 50% usage outside. Good see, although I'd prefer 100%. go work infect others responsible that. Call sick go get telehealth visit. Ffs can't mad got work one breath, okay spreading coworkers next. getting better now, I'm guessing live USA idea rest world European visits US often, people wearing masks problem US.

Mind you, live UK, can't really talk advise people what's best. still think masks problem. Statistically relevant though. 16% needing ICU compared 8% without treatment? overselling it. That's pretty significant can't dismiss ""junk science"" really - already sold doses needed vaccinate US Masks mostly pretty great cost/benefit ratio. go without one study comparable benefits shutting schools restaurants. 

Pretty much everything limited effect. combine enough keep cost much possible. dad seems think way cases counted hospitals incentivized over-diagnose get ton funding. think he‚Äôs talking ass also says states get tested several times counts multiple cases. could truth denying it‚Äôs brutal virus though according it‚Äôs ‚Äújust bad flu season‚Äù. MUCH interactive foreign populations

You'd think UK island massive advantage department, let slide. 

The stats Oregon huge spike 2 weeks protests started. talking coworker last week (over Zoom, thankfully), that's exactly feels. thinks US can't better culture geography (""NZ Australia islands""), perfectly content US numbers higher anyone else.

So prediction. current. Nordic countries awesome I‚Äôd love travel there. truly baffles people compare small European countries US. context different. needs sell vaccine one, can't sell does't work, certainly hope work tho. I‚Äôm scared death people escape Florida come NY. also many snowbirds move south winter come back summer. I‚Äôm especially worried long lasts surfaces, ONE sanitizing shit, even adamant mask users. 

One good bit news, US we‚Äôve testing protestors 1% tested positive ‚Äî that‚Äôs multiple large cities. much lower number expected they‚Äôre thinking must due outdoors.  That‚Äôs absurdly high. NY screwed beginning--they thought could handle localized lockdown. Luckily, Cuomo hard U-turn took control albeit lot deaths. 

A better example would Washington State even there's people counties like Yakima believe it. Sometimes feels like I'm part group project part work, still end failing.  Correction: meat factories high hygiene standards PAPER. work inspector, albeit different industry, bastards bastards everywhere. 
 
I'm sorry burst bubble, lot companies absolutely everything cut prices drive lower lower. means cutting corners wherever can. there's one around act counterweight, shit get hand. People people everywhere. 
And going complain? low-cost workers skirting boundaries labour law? plenty saps came from.
 
And mention people position means offer counterweight scrupulous. observant. even knowledgeable.

Money, alas, still talks. everywhere, time, good us. Well said yourself.. they‚Äôre making masks mandatory, data must show doesn‚Äôt need mandatory.... otherwise would tell you. don‚Äôt need mask go outside walk spouse either- lot people mistakenly thought going every store. 7% employer, 7% you. Simplified bit.  Estonia fully open month now. Nobody really wore masks tho, today, zero new cases many people get multiple DUIs?

About 33% repeat offenders , per Google study? made too? Grosssmann School Medicine New York making shit observable data?

Sorry hear. helps any, thoughts you. Please stay safe! moved here, can't really vote eitherway :/

(But No). misinformation? fact part? Sure. rest correct. I'd like citation part I'm wrong, burden proof rests you.

And call someone ""lier"" asshole. also extremely pedantic. keep saying wrong wtf talking dont disagree? first covid infections linked wet market vast majority experts agree? Yes yes. Thanks! It‚Äôs long road. Keep good fight government printing funds, cutting middle men transactions, control hard earned value. really do...

I able see American girlfriend 4 months can't travel there, can't travel here... nba comes town wait till july 4th won‚Äôt. We‚Äôre fucked. don‚Äôt know infection prevents reinfection meaningful amount time. 

We don‚Äôt know long term non fatal consequences. idk everyone sensitive person stating fact company promoting product. like, jeez... get people might offended slight jab made, companies literally operate stay operation revenue (cause surprisingly costs money make things, provide service, basic microeconomic practices, go figure)... hard understand? That's I'm saying - EU US similar size, EU restricted travel countries hit badly. reopening borders. US never restricted travel places cases April hotspots Nah we're taking lot seriously countries. shit Yay! We‚Äôre fucked  [Title particularly corresponded major population centres, it? Wales notably par.  it‚Äôs 33th amendment. think general thought testing lower positive % be. testing increasing positive rate increasing, transmission also increasing.

If testing higher number cases, % going could argue testing.

I think that's probably good rule thumb, probably many confounding variables involved hard take strict truth. rate things going things predicted come, see schools colleges going online fall? Alot colleges already announced person classes, really dont know cases rising recently. Maybe certain states?  scapegoating? delusional? pointed study act idiot. guess know want talk tough science back up. Well yeah, several thousand people shoulder shoulder, cases gonna spike. 3 months quarantine gone.
It transmits eyes too, forget safety glasses people troubling. Almost one wearing mask outdoors, everybody wearing mask indoors, mandatory.

Also lockdown reduced cases small number stopped lockdown 6 weeks ago. masks outdoor seems work far. 14% income split employer covered everything.

You sure that? Austria 7.5 % Runners receive gift certificate good one (1) antibody test. Also six month supply hand sanitizer! easy, stop testing number confirmed cases go /s That's bad, bad news. US (..) anti-scientific

This interesting thing think about. Honestly think every country share morons idiots, reason US group exploited almost organisations parties benefit misery. Whether gun control, tax system, climate discussion, lot issues framed like benefit people, reality really; interesting thing due framing lack proper, nuanced discussion get camps.

Here NL definitely people think voting rights, Im glad country ruled competent people basically say people 'we hear we'll best ridiculous stuff like leave EU'.

Why? one wears masks Netherlands except public transport virus good gone. looks horrible don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs covid. Hope gets CBC differential . yep rhetoric disgusting internet tough guy wanna losers echoing hear front page karma points. pathetic hey - that's Reddit! So, sudden spike 2 weeks protests started absolutely nothing right? end. even beginning end. may end beginning. thing don‚Äôt get could easily go way, ramp fear pandemic blame everything parade hero. ‚ÄòThe reason economy bad pandemic‚Äô ‚ÄòNO ONE knew pandemics could bad *except folks, except me*‚Äô ‚Äòthey said could kill million, two million people said no, corona, you. Will. Not‚Äô

But wouldn‚Äôt work blame person, clump protein DNA I'm guessing compliance hovering around 100%. U.S. not.

Gee, wonder why.... Give UK miss move Sweden instead. Get well soon DL! rural areas hard hit. Something like 1/3 America's deaths stem urban, 'educated' people NYC. Large cities spread outbreaks, blaming rural people problem accomplishes nothing. 

Also, BLM protests seemed take place cities fond of, protests definitely spike coronavirus cases.  Someone needs draw Fibonacci lines see US covid stock go moon One husbands coworkers passed away Covid someone would label ""at risk"" fairly healthy (a bit overweight obese). late 40's early 50's left behind wife 2 teen daughters. know someone else got covid healthy woman early 40's, sick dog. leave hed days speak full sentences days. Luckily recovered. healthy 39 y.o. wants avoid catching this, understand try mitigate risk? Feel free read link research yourself. told DATA yet US countries one tracking it, *is* article NL bothered read it. would play safe rather sorry virus LOT still unknown flat ain't behaving like known coronavirus infections. Think many family members infected. damn, sounds like US someone explain could contract virus, isolated far away outsiders? Someone brought virus there? stores require customers wear masks beginning June 22.  
   
Two weeks ago San Antonio: [Customers longer required wear masks shopping H-E-B, still currently going back normal eyes

While sub calling politicians stupid allowing it. Alright buddy. You‚Äôre delusional Yep. hard pride country government ran greed reason.  even want wear USA shirts usually sport around Fourth. issue plant workers. workers close knit cultural group practice safety time

This kind attempt racist also way protecting companies liable employees safety. 

It nothing fact factories designed make social distancing easy factory owners making necessary steps prevent thier workers spreading it...it's workers fault ""a close knit cultural group practice safety own""

Blame victims rather understanding circumstances, huh?

Real nice dude.

(Edit apparently claiming party one denying science behind virus bannable.) said ""fact"" came wet market. Can‚Äôt sleep anymore beach... think actually going stop covid tracks point? It‚Äôs going move population slowly surely even lock everything every single human planet earth wears mask washes hands.  Sounds like Rome. plenty vitamins body knows deal excess of. instance, C believe A, piss isn‚Äôt absorbed. 

I don‚Äôt understand anyone could issue someone taking vitamin....god DAMMIT I‚Äôm done internet today. someone pointed below, huge personal benefit mask usage touching nose mouth, perhaps common way get virus. certainly need wear one car, I'll mine around neck I'm going anywhere easy put on. become attributed increased testing. Even hard get test, hear becoming easier. recently donate blood, bloodwork, get injured get tested states automatically. That's always case. San Francisco, I'd estimate around 75% residents wearing masks even walking outside. Mask wearing pretty strictly enforced businesses.

Yesterday, California 4,216 new cases. Los Angeles 2,027. San Francisco 1 new case. I‚Äôd throw countries well. Places populations masks weren‚Äôt made political abide wearing hell lot better states pandemic moment. 

It doesn‚Äôt 100% stop spread, nothing does. studies indicate mask wearing stop spread 85% though, still pretty damn good. Another disclaimer it‚Äôs yet *technically* proven Corona, 100% proven stopping spread much well known viruses. People US need wear masks.

we're wearing masks Denmark

Things looking decent here, overall And? Nobody talking European union, asked Western Europe one? people war masks chin level, ready pulled up. U wot m8!! ;) used test sick people. Older people likely sick enough get tested 

This seems like artifact testing availability inherent viral change Europe still locked down? know many places going green people going back work full time. see pictures Tulsa rally people didn‚Äôt though. Everyone crammed close could Trump left upper decks empty. don‚Äôt think question suppression, much US inflated numbers.

I know lot doctors talking incentivized covid deaths (you get 7500 11k person dies covid).

Since hospitals essentially business, they‚Äôve claiming cases covid death wasn‚Äôt warranted (someone dying stroke, labeled covid instead).

A lot doctors criticizing practice (and justifiably so) it‚Äôs skews data, doesn‚Äôt give accurate picture what‚Äôs going on. 

I think better question would many cases mislabeled covid not? source one? heard anything since whole bunch caught weeks ago need quit wearing masks vent hole size quarter. doesn‚Äôt protect sick. Why?

Let us ignore fact tests conclusive first place, since know many recovered people show antibodies time.

Even test always accurate, people would find better use money. REALLY felt it, put it, worth time money confirm it?

What changes them? 100% agree live California, taxes higher better minimum wage (still enough obviously). would love things move towards Nordic model social democracy. We‚Äôll see. ""Symptoms 90 days!"" sorry say someone believe one time, leads towards man-made Bio-weapon. Full stop there. Smh. average 10% I‚Äôm trying say. Maharashtra Delhi hotspots average rates because... well they‚Äôre hotspotsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. said Telangana cuz high test positivity rate isn‚Äôt considered hotspot cuz don‚Äôt test much overall low number cases despite high test positivity... smh could‚Äôve said remarks nvm... I‚Äôll let superiority complex alone... wanted say volunteer NGO collects data covid... ofc won‚Äôt facts right? Smh. Don‚Äôt bother replying without respectful please. Please don‚Äôt waste ‚Äúsalt‚Äù. Lol thinking anyone Europe wears masks. propose ban posts bad news US? Taking vitamins ""preventive measure"" senseless could even negative effect. Look clinical trial, involving multiple decades large amounts people.

Sole exceptions Vitamin certain B group vitamins (B12) follow vegan philosophy.

Of generally (Europeans least) smaller larger lack due getting enough exposure Sun.

B12 would mostly get meat. Vegans, well, don't. Yeah are. entering bus train without one.

Additionally, do. ‚ÄúAsymptomatic‚Äù didn‚Äôt typical respiratory infection symptoms like cough fever. It‚Äôs shown asymptomatic people still abnormal lung scans suggesting there‚Äôs damage lower blood oxygen levels. Ah yes, forget internet, everyone refers google back arguments. Well, rage justified. googled everything I've ever thought despite keeping local state action officials. local hospitals laid workers fighting survival. yea... Someone, somewhere web said something hear.

Trigger on, triggered. remarkable software issues always happen new records set one other.

And fact children (and many parents younger age) essentially 0% chance dying must taken account. can't stop critical components society this. think trying say leadership can't faulted know virus transmission different measures like mask wearing.

This pretty good, particularly since debate efficacy mask wearing early on. (And note, masks, esp n95s require knowledge use etc.) However, point know transmission take place thru water droplets close proximity. amount virus one needs exposed infection take place likely found indoors, close proximity infectious person. role surfaces play seems lot smaller-----one bring enough virus onto eyes/nose/mouth. Going back beginning, learned public health benefit mask wearing identical individual's protection mask wearing. Much debate focused narrowly well masks filtered virus user, ignoring importance keeping virus inside mask, prevent infecting others.  friend walked restaurant holding mask rest us wore ours. Sure friendly people

This seemed change past couple months. know people cooped COVID definitely everyone, seems like people want chew others' asses anything everything. would argue probably stems current shitty politics. Biggest outbreak wa state Yakima around meatpacking.

Outdoor exposure unlikely. indoors recirculated air prolonged periods primary route.

Out they've also wearing masks.

I've seen putative cases linked protests states. risk zero. factory jobs especially meatpacking 100x worse. answered question yourself. trends slightly downward yesterday slightly less day before. Yeah, did. want admit it. True, like always extreme example happens Middle East. However, European can't help look salaries side pod much higher cost living much lower \*\*laughs english\*\* Yes eu many substates mechanisms preventing migration countries, us doesnt. That's actually said, necessarily accurate. point right mix skill, dedication luck, US afford highest rates pay. There's huge systematic injustices, time countless immigrants upwardly mobile people would confirm US really land opportunity... land free??? question. opportunity spread fairly? No... successful regardless color skin come from, although certainly challenging others. Someone must given homework basic arithmetic. gives ample space socially distance, instead packed shoulder shoulder Lol thanks. 99% countries planet works possible, instances seems angry man grudge sweden

He seem way me. even was, would change merits arguments.

Ad hominem logical fallacy. Whether angry not, whether grudge not, whether Swedish not... none things bearing whether arguments merit. There's flu vaccine every year. yes.

That's probably way it. Let's use Big Brother (Google/Apple/NSA) something *not* evil we'd storm city hall city it

True. kind martial law would imposed. Sadly anything curtailing rights/freedom/privacy unwashed masses\* would never removed.

I suspect screwed next revolution. There's lot fix it'll big one.

\* anyone millionaire better. Londoner, tell (approximately, count) 5% people wearing masks area. refuse follow pack still wear mask I'm shop inside space. confident I've Covid already think people wear masks peer pressure force others follow suit.

This pandemic shown selfish reality many people many different countries. possibility reducing regular flu numbers well Covid. Masks. Asian countries wearing masks pollution, circulating flu virus accepted. laughed at. Americans it. though ridicule common sense. virus one thing, event companies going bankrupt next several years unrealistic think *""Here's bad part: testing extent, going find people, going find cases. said people, slow testing please.""* 

With mind, probably told ""Piss Off"" 

You want ~~Truth~~ Testing, handle ~~Truth~~ Testing Also MD combination things. People wear masks also likly social distance. Indoor activities opened harder hit areas still chance things go up.

I hope current upticks based mainly people stupid. Many employers right forcing workers quarantine leave home area. Without information would worthwhile check employee handbook whatever covid updates given Yeah CO2


/s mostly many people make ""wearing mask"" political. tf everything turn politics? guess that's important distinction. Berlin also feels like one wearing masks. walk streets maybe one ten actively wearing one. almost everyone carries one around. enter store public transport, vast majority people wear masks. 

And ask enough. really need wear masks walking around outside keeping distance? Would probably better so, outside likely much less issue indoors. 

It seems work. sell novelty gift, like ""I love NYC"" magnet things get airport. fault, I'm trying attack anything, fact possible earn much money many us getting shafted. low taxes minimum wages directly equate others getting paid keeping more. Again, blame individuals like taking advantage this, facts undeniable. Half posts US failed. going talk that, going political. going talk effectiveness drugs masks habits, leaders telling us different things political reasons. completely enmeshed facets outbreak there's way separating them.  include Sweden settling lawsuit cheaper lost revenue 10 times seems WAY high. buy half infections may asymptomatic, nowhere near many. Take testing entire Italian town Vo, found 43% residents tested positive act like US country fuck up. Every country except maybe NZ didn‚Äôt take seriously suffered. US also lot decentralised compared every country. suggest instead generalising entire country read states precautions taking. handling based country wide rulings, it‚Äôs state county. ‚ÄúMoronic control‚Äù exaggerated typical anti-USA reddit rhetoric jesus christ. I‚Äôm shocked seemed mention Europe region suppressed epidemic headlines. Asia? Pretty much every European country different laws deal virus thought border closed Swedes unless worked there? work live opposite sides bridge? You‚Äôre right, sentence gibberish. think local reporter trying make article relevant local readership. study concluded connectivity dangerous pandemic density. found mega-regions lot travel central hub leads transmission density itself. live Connecticut masks required indoors places can‚Äôt effectively social distance. contrast family lives Florida insane damn stressful. silly question sign clinical trials? live 90ish minutes away Bethesda, Maryland want participate vaccine trials. went clinicals.gov website couldn‚Äôt find sign info far VA goes Fairfax got still getting fucked, Loudoun isnt far behind it. Richmond isnt great either overall lot state pretty rural west awful. biggest concern college campuses sticks (VT, UVA, Radford, etc) since closed pretty early shit along I-81 isnt badly (as far know, please correct I'm wrong) Coughing elbow might wise also, even masked. way smaller droplets still flung, end elbow someone else. also: vote Faucci he's taking away rights Remember Biden criticized Medicare referring Italy's treatment virus? fool Oh. course. True 1rst wave get suppressed 2nd wave, like COULD happen Europe, still way better nothing first massive wave like US. That's blatantly false. quick search shows Germany parliamentary system, US set know germany country quite bit younger United States America?

How relevant? highest single day new cases today. believe saw someone pass get carried Trump rally last night. chances infected? literally front row standing crowd I'm guessing fact UK 8 times densley populated MUCH interactive foreign populations, probably affect slope graphs. I'm expecting USA slowly get worse. data basing on? Masks seem critical flattening curve statistic EU. Also people say A,erica generally mean US. like Europe commonly used refer european union miss part Norway opened Gotland, Sweden?

The border closed would like think, mate. limits many people building public places/shops need guarantee people keep 1.5m distance there. China, Singapore, South Korea done brilliant results.

And official model.

But reason, many countries seem political desire extent necessary. find someone went restaurant potentially infected? state says contact tracing, information never made public. ""potential exposure X restaurant date Z hours"". Never seen it. imagine businesses want information there. Oh bug chasers there. People weird. Like flu? Polio? TB? virus modeling here? too. get others would leave car it‚Äôs hot whatever. 4.1 lakh = 410,000 Serious question - exactly believe plot? expecting comply end coronavirus outbreaks? thought flattening curve cases spread limited resources overwhelmed. evidence exists actually beat virus? actual history something taught. stands, *history* something actively consciously hunt for. unrecognizable phone number shows phone, pick either. got many marketing phishing calls. Even pick up, chances answer personal questions low. Again, know person phishing con man? 

Taiwan uses infected person's cell phone locations identify cell phones proximity. track people. rely infected person's cooperation. unlikely person remember people came contact given Taiwan lock down. Many could strangers restaurant.

If number people huge, send alert message emergency notification channel tell people self-quarantine. 1 case (Diamond Princess), Taiwan's CECC sent alerts people came contact DP passengers. possible they've relied manual tracing.

Not sure could get cell phone location info here. We're ok let private companies like Google collect location data, would storm city hall city it. Yep still better Maybe crying? less likely. Otherwise bother even evolving symptoms first place? symptoms meant help spread. hang mask ear. near already reminder. Highest Sunday 3rd highest date. Weekend numbers usually lower, bad.  Yes quite liter germany set up. know germany country quite bit younger United States America? Yes, aware that, maybe unclear wanted point blatantly stupid blame virus country, like Trump does. Especially given one deadliest virii 20th century originated US one best hygiene standards time. That's huge surge within 24 hours. horrible industry part conditions surprise me. but......that means numbers go up.....They'll great number us shopping center less hotspot

Probably. differentiate shoppers people coming away? need kind checkpoint, doubt Sweden going let us (I'm Norwegian) make checkpoints *inside* Sweden. possible checkpoint already border.

That‚Äôs basically eliminate disease: figure doesn‚Äôt, separate them, keep one it. one things need determined Phase III clinical trials humans. level autoimmune reaction expected occur. influenza vaccine already gives Guillain-Barr√© syndrome 1-2 people 1,000,000 doses, autoimmune reaction attacks myelin sheaths nerves. That's better contracting influenza though.

There probably similar autoimmune reactions coronavirus vaccine low level. also difficult pick correct coronavirus vaccine absolutely minimizes reactions without giving 10,000,000s people creating problems. One vaccine might cause bad reactions 10 people 10,000,000 another vaccine might cause 100 probably know time rolls out.

Once *relative* safety shown Phase III trials, though, vaccine 100x 1000x times safer getting sick virus.

The risks vaccine zero, neither driving supermarket. I'll certainly take chances vaccine virus. reminder touch face convenience going multiple places. lost minds long time ago; covid exposing see. Sweden aiming herd immunity, actually. ..but they've shown long term immunity ... plan vaccinate everyone every three months indefinitely? Yeahhhh There's plant like near similar scenario, shut temporarily... issue plant workers. workers close knit cultural group practice safety time, plant reopened, even strict measures, employees still got infected work hours. telling single Yuropean drank bleach kill rona?!? worked seniors' homes, sad fact is, assault another resident staff senior reported, police claim hands tied. generally press charges, assume elderly assailant dementia condition precluding responsible actions. Even cases multiple assaults one resident, police charge them, tell home's management must resolve problem. way start long slow eviction process requires mountain documentation, stymied resistive family members. often see serious assault coming months advance, cannot much stop it, short physically blocking fragile residents violence. can't always get time that. üòû Wow. checking data tuscany recorded 0 deaths second day row. always least one daily death since beginning emergency. Billing rates typically double triple staff get paid business, cover everything else - facility expenses, heating, lighting, taxes etc. That's right, EU 100 million people much culturally diverse yet work together fight virus... less I'm glad taking seriously hope stay well.

Well beginning trump say much better ‚Äúanyone else world‚Äù Naw mean would he? would know we‚Äôre midst global pandemic featuring highly contagious virus? 

2020 honestly feels like episode Twilight Zone Fascinatingly enough, I've seen maybe 10% people public wearing masks Europe. people seem make that. numbers still dropping without real upticks months, think 50 severe cases across country right now? doubt numbers would could go anywhere near US seeing see next months. 

It's masks, also sheer stupidity people. generalize, course there's many, many sane well-intentioned Americans, nobody protesting virus. ideas breaking social distancing still much sane theirs, I've seen. gtfo pathetic piece shit human. don‚Äôt want people like country can‚Äôt even admit wrong perpetuating racist culture. Please leave. course is, player's rep? Despite diagnosis, Pinal County sheriff says still plans wear mask public enforce future orders requiring one so. Fortunately rich old feeble. also handled virus significantly worse despite ‚Äòfree healthcare‚Äô act like it‚Äôs 120,000 now.

Watching real time like watching shitty movie. It‚Äôs awful, it‚Äôs utterly hilarious. Uh talking about? false news. studies showing wearing mask helps minize spreading germs.

And wear mask 100% block transmission likely helps reduce spread. 

That literally definition science. üòÄ scary, found days ago one friends TX COVID-19. admitted gotten little lax still wearing mask time using hand sanitizer. good person cares commiserated together months ago people take virus seriously. it. hard live environment everything reopened almost back normal let get lax.

He sick. Yes, viruses spread quickly densely packed cities there‚Äôs preventative measures place. one knew extent going around NYC weeks people continued take subway, worked packed offices, went home packed apartments, etc. 

No one knew much spreading February one anything, think that‚Äôs poor time period evaluate. Current numbers relevant; know ton virus make conscious choice something nothing. Big cities actually pretty well environment numbers decline. Rural areas surging they‚Äôre choosing inaction.  IMPORTANT EVERYONE GET TESTED!! it, told job, (four weeks ago), asked anybody gotten tested yesterday ZERO people went. Wishing good health, DL.   agree sentiment think 4th July along lines predicting (between massive gatherings parties *and* protests). I'd wager around 18th see shit hit fan exponentially American doesn‚Äôt leave America anymore.....yes. Luckily Grandmother (Florida) able see dermatologist last month mole. one patient allowed whole office along mask requirements.  
Unfortunately, diagnosed melanoma half face partially removed requires hyperbaric oxygen therapy five days week. said facility careful, that‚Äôs good also high-risk conditions.  
   
I glad didn‚Äôt put off. people need food, people get sick people ultimately get sick could possibly less food. would say prepare worst much can, right? Stock much can. Grow food, it, freeze can. there's people sick there's greater chance getting sick know get sick bad you. getting groceries delivered, bunch people get sick, could effect getting food could harder longer wait times. people get sick there's greater chance encountering go store etc. Russia exception, think. life gets difficult money. article pretty bad throwing percentages.  really prove much. might case would got control far quicker wearing masks. president simpleton, expect? fault him, fault believing could anything more.  Teen doomers Setting checkpoints every state border would logistical nightmare. without stats background, quick translation.

They used linear models. basically looking one thing another. classic example ice cream sales drowning. ice cream sales increase, drownings increase. Ice cream sales cause drowning. increase third (confounding) variable; temperature.

They ""control"" confounding variables. Like population size, social distancing, etc time.

The US 500k tests per day. wondering compares EU. difference USA Europe rules, people.

There plenty differences US lacks: leadership, coherent strategy discipline majority population (ignorance). 

I guess extreme level political division US helping either. California. Masks help there's much done several hundred people close proximity several times week. No. many protests NY, NJ, IL compared GA, FL, TX. Look state's trends: entirely function states opening early mandating social distancing / mask wearing. LAPD officer complain GM told employees going help without mask on, crazy enforce want friend basically stuck home gone. gone dog park times there's nobody gathered donations elderly church home. left apartment otherwise can't even move boyfriend he's still working. slowing testing thus destroying second wave! brilliant!!!  cleaning bunker? Well selfish prick Canada/US border closed truckers delivering loads. mutual agreement. expect remain closed least next year. probably case rest world. Nobody allowed enter leave US hot zone. healthcare option costs $10k year covers everything without extra payments 

That would cool long get sick longer work, savings happen insufficient cover $10k/year (after basic survival expenses).  Fine, studies done ""years ago"" Coronavirus transmission specifically literally appeared **late December last year**. Hence, understanding effects, transmission, behaviors evolving till catch up.

Trump still eschews mask wearing suggested point political posturing wear one yes, helping claims masks dumb, unproven medications cure it, UV radiation drinking Lysol whatever fuck mind goes know.

No dont. talking about. Austria stopped enforcing masks supermarkets Monday. Nobody except wearing one shopping today. like nothing ever happened worry we'll back square one weeks less. That‚Äôs reasonable. I‚Äôm advocating people abandon sense security. However there‚Äôs lot pretty aggressive rhetoric asking people keep isolated. Anecdotal: friend‚Äôs roommates (all young healthy) forbidding meeting friends getting haircuts despite fact city (Chicago) one successful flattening curve, allowing gatherings 10, moving stage 4 reopening. seems outrageous, people speak 5% death rates can‚Äôt help think trying suppress others satisfy hysteria. CHINA!! Social distancing big thing Japan. Pretty much impossible large cities, wearing masks great idea. 
Few cities US Europe situation comparison really make sense. insane people think lie way pandemic. What's terrifying reveals common is, apparently, solution problems. Lying become endemic (it seems one political party particular) that's ""solution"" dealing well. Yeah think along realization many people detectable IgM IgG detectable IgA t-cells means serological studies lower bounds number people infected. Thanks this! We've known while. Immune systems going ramp virus quickly defeated innate immune system. Plus antibody presence decreases time everyone. Oops! Can't tests equipment fucked never even set up, anyone leaving voicemail 2020 just... isnt touch reality probably wasnt important anyway antibody tests data I've seen based give false positivies, complaints possible get false negative even people think  aware of. Trump adminstration creating second wave rallys. worry much. probably packaged days bought keep days fridge safe. chance still enough active virus make sick incredibly slim. bought packaged salad kit Friday June 19 says best used June 27th. likely packaged 17th, possibly well before. Sun valley tourists? Right California also even require masks high risk areas days ago, Illinois New York required many weeks now. three states large protests weeks ago. Europe also outbreak first. said, there's reason believe US suppressing time soon. said team en route solution: administering drug colchicine coronavirus patients.  approved drug used prevention treatment gout attacks, caused much uric acid blood. 
Higavi said completed testing colchicine mice found successfully inhibited release alpha defensin. Now, waiting necessary approvals test human coronavirus patients. 

If works could prevent death hundreds thousands people. lol Israel showing accountability admitting mistakes? 

Go ask Gaza protestors feel statement Put prefix 'nano-' front word drive room temperature IQ conspiracy boys nuts. easily see shortage that... Yeah bad people responsible accord. really need react reality people behaving make masks required. mind blowingly simple! glad see California finally crazy took past week.

On one hand frustrating people can't responsible own. hand empathize well, normalcy bias really powerful thing that's hard humans overcome. We're used living world individuals need make hard choices daily basis protect lives around them. We're used thinking anything legal less ok do. need really think carefully likely lose control car highway crash, know keep safety inspection date go speed limit. need learn lot biology decide whether family might get food poisoning food not, trust refrigerator keep low enough safe temperature eat expiration date.

So hell decided dangerous let people choose meat safe eat hope make smart decisions, surely make legally mandated precautions disease become number one cause death country affects individual making decisions everyone around them?? That's exactly it. spike 1,000 infections meatpacking facility. That's double daily infections last couple weeks. control. difference USA Europe rules, people. 

How many Dutch people guns demanding reopen everything fully seen? USA incompetence, implement herd immunity? fact large % USA is/was infected going help, correct? wrong Portugal really? picks up. compare that, US still higher number cases per capita. proven work, die choice there. Even New York City majority people infected. Certain areas sure, areas not. Lombardy towns majority infected, region whole stopped lot spread.

So, yeah. There's long way anywhere world significant enough size run potential infections, exceptions along lines smaller towns, specific city blocks, prisons meat packing plants on.  Yet deaths going down. BCG vaccine too,and there's study it, could potentially prevent severe forms covid19, like BCG prevents severe forms tubercolisis/meningeal tubercolisis Phenomia deaths? much higher normal? GO DUMB GO DUMB USA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ""I understand US many deaths China doesn't, must lying, that's explanation!"" tells education system sucks. would respond lol. honoured accept invitation. pretty much describing really expensive PPO dental plan. current health insurance costs $40/month thr max pay 4k including premiums. sad part joke needed read first 4 words know said :( still move, UK US Europe. handling covid abhorrent civilized/modern country Why?

It's masks. social distancing.

Anyone, I'm sure people happy Europe while. Good them! They've lot. We've coronaviruses centuries... common cold mers, sars, covid-19. vaccine centuries data, think unreasonable unrealistic people think ""oh we'll get vaccine soon"". might shadow vaccine soon... anything reliable effective vaccines like mmr/dtap etc. food shortage... distribution problems...

What call lack food shelves? matter Thousands Americans going die

Yes. every single one tragic. rate, even need July 4th. fake news, overhyped, both. brought people would say 'Oh virus bad everyone's saying, flu. [Insert thing] kills people per year' feel superior means...the US botched response covid. Mask wearing one many ways curve virus. non lo e' per legge praticamente ovunque, qualsiasi supermercato luogo pubblico chiuso ti chiedono di indossarla repliers responsibility understand commenter saying replying, I'm happy guy found huggable people life, defend talk shit anyone anything selfish say it, yeah, I'm going call weirdos caring much going ""boohoo family wish family fuck you."" family either. ""BuT FrEe. THeY'rE pAyInG eVerYoNe ELsE's hEaLtH!"" 

- Americans who'd rather pay tons money pocket Yeah get don‚Äôt want brigading everything, feel like we‚Äôre criticizing government official‚Äôs words/statements/public health decisions least lenient.  Everyone tends think I'm crazy tell really dark potential timelines.  What? thought US greatest country earth. Can't US fault. Chinese definetly played part there.

Jokes aside, sorry People US caring other.
I even want paint enemy picture people part Anti-restriction-movement.

I wish world understand big part US deep cultural ideological issue.

We know thinking Philosophy impact global problem.

Ignorance &amp; Arrogance towards others idea. Believing hard idea. That's almost root societal issues world.

Hope one day fighting root. believe so. believe people die die masses, die tragedy, really start think differently.

Never different. HoAx! 300ish cases every day, 24k US.. That‚Äôs good nasty time Something consider would people infected sars typically took 5-6 months fully recover. covid patients long lasting effects experience permanently. Looking Japan, masks hygiene seem huge effect virus.

They might able stop virus own, difference Japan European countries fast virus spreads huge. talking 1,000 infections meat packing factory. Outside 200 infections entire country. US 35,000 new infections yesterday? man allowed governor?  still employee, fairly well compensated one. I‚Äôm still part worker class that‚Äôs getting fucked corporate overlords, don‚Äôt get wrong. Definitely rich. earning enough better quality life would back home. first peak drop basically NY/NJ/MA states. numbers dropped new increase areas opened think covid flu No, they'd get moved different unit. Btw, probably go unnoticed, like. living apartment complex, love gods entities ever existed world, cover toilets flushing pour water drains 2 times day. virus transmitted sewage system since found human feces. Basically they're setting ridiculous parameters argument disregards overall health, demographics, Hospital size, population density, quantity certain industries, amount mask wearing, natural disasters complex situation becomes binary hypothetical reasonable chance coming true variables above.

What old sayings, broken clock right twice day blind squirrel finds nut every awhile really need get sticky link sidebar collection scientific reports consensus stop spread shaky (mis)information spread sub.

The genetic research team, Nextstrain, understand comprehensive set viral genome [data analyses publicly available basically evidence support folks North America spreading virus via community transmission back December 2019. fact, evidence strongly suggests happening. know happening late January, though.

This implications stories like LA Times piece here. piece citing ""mysterious"" deaths took place California late December early January, meaning patients would needed quite direct links/interactions travelers China.

While interesting consider, important caution people odds strongly cases/deaths COVID-19. public misled believe people already antibodies virus wildly different behaviors science suggesting, weakens collective efforts reducing spread via mask-wearing, social distancing, etc.

In words, ""mysterious"" illness prior February, odds overwhelmingly strong COVID-19. mysterious illness February? Odds still quite good COVID-19, unless hotspot like Seattle. March/April? still probably unless hotspot realm likelihood I'd probably interested seeking serological test. Im state Victoria, population 6.36 mil, got 19 cases yesterday, significant uptick 5. week since eased restrictions due persistent single digit rates looks like going go back continue harsher restrictions July 22.

Thats bad end things. look US, fucking madness full steam ahead many cases relatively fragile healthcare system. lot ‚Äúthe heat kill it‚Äù talk going around around time stay home lifted. Also talk AZ spread won‚Äôt able spread like NY big cities. think people really bought ideas didn‚Äôt take seriously general anyway.

Also I‚Äôve heard reports lots tourists CA came stay home order lifted that‚Äôs cases came from. sure true is, people CA usually healthy disdain AZ. That's really discouraging. There's anti-science bias happening country right re: virus pushed top down, sides aisle. messaging inconsistent incomplete people confused know believe. think people interpret re-opening mean virus less threat. whole thing big mess. surprise, latest major outbreaks Germany happened meat factories staffed exploited eastern European contract workers horrible housing working conditions. 
Those things change, since existed first place. case Corona cause, symptom much bigger problem. long, suspect second wave Europe enough quick.

Here Belgium: noticed people simply stopped care... Today supermarket everyone maskless except person working checkout.

And btw, HUGE party outdoors hundreds people partied last night.

If enough people build immunity second wave coming. general hospital beds, Italy better 3.18 hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants, 12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 inhabitants.

USA: 2.77 hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants, 29.4 ICU beds per 100,000 inhabitants.

So, ICU beds, Italy's average number worse. keep mind worst outbreak *Northern Italy*, much much richer Italy's poor South, one best health care systems Europe.

Reality complex might factors play. Northern Italy huge meat industry lot antibiotics used. possible antibiotic-resistant secondary infections made situation Northern Italy bad. still, ways virus damage lungs far well understood. Uh, weather fucking terrible south. mean? No, that's median length stay death moving out. Skilled nursing facilities also used rehab.

I guess 6% mortality 2 week period possible chance. information larger sample size needed. you‚Äôre saying get keep whacking residents until... what, violent one dies? opposite safe secure elderly care homes whole world would shut properly eradicate thing once, could get rid virus, virtue comparative economics, could also recover healthy market.

The reason countries rushing reopening keep pace others, ready, science there, it‚Äôs actually safe.  guys religious are. evangelicals especially dangerous here. people smart enough wear correctly. lied working worries. Thank you! Exactly that! Italy, 99% people around wear masks Currently Key West, people saying ""If weak emotionally need security blanket mask, go ahead let people know controlled irrational fear. let controlled fear."" Cans park lads You‚Äôre missing point. scenario happen often it? studies accurate randomly select hundred thousand people monitor monthly get sick outcome. don‚Äôt trust meta-studies. One reason think otherwise they've never produced vaccine kind, product before, 10 year history. hate say Americans stubborn &amp; independent play follow leader. would've NEVER adhered lockdown 2 weeks. Plus, there's social safety net compensate work, mortgage &amp; rent forgiveness done regional level. many ways we're like 3rd world country, bifurcated economy white collar professionals shelter home huge swath working class peons either starve, get evicted head covid-infested factory, retail &amp; distribution jobs. far europe hit US. Deaths per capita relevant crisis over. incurring huge cost though. cost may necessary. Thanks, nothing add. said perfectly.
Unfortunatly, lucky people problems, cannot understand that. People think oppressive somehow despite Asiatic countries wearing many years. heard common age group onset dementia 75-85 next 10 years get interesting. possible, however, Germany acted quickly strictly early phases reduced overall available population likely infected?

In state US, mandatory mask mandates well. enforced, knuckle dragging 30% view kind sign weakness places wearing masks. know many european countries reopened schools ago o.0 Netherlands. stay 1.5 apart, wear masks needed curve down. Sure virus still around, hand washing distance keeping working. Nice.

Countries populist leaders like brasil us messing foe rest us. Turning global pandemic political thing sickening. still mitigate lives lost. One life lost many renounce defeatist stance lot people taking Uh, correct. least totally correct. Back Medicare set up, expect people live long retirement. Medicine come long way people living longer much frailer health.

Many people nursing homes would alive 50 years earlier. survive heart attack seventies (that would killed parents) live eighties develop dementia. way places herd immunity. Sweden arguably done worst. would want live different strokes all. good one. said UV leading cause melanoma, far UVC causes .... 0 cases melanoma every year. Also far-UVC penetrate skin reach nucleated cells. Except America 3rd world middle class lower. least Europe collective bargaining holidays etc. Yes. I've seen lot places. talking 3 nurses 2 aides 40 residents. feasible way able take care many people. average probably worse. burn turnover rate enormous places too. happens. basics get done, medicine gets distributed meals given. Anything else crap shoot basic care like bathing changing clothes/linens aware something happens patient like fall change condition.   say April? Oh, agree you. adding additional information, know ""exhaustion"" celebrities means. There‚Äôs behavioral element testing well. confirmed positive, people know hadn‚Äôt stay home self-isolate least two weeks. don‚Äôt get tested may think little cough (if lucky) carry on. fucking fault. I‚Äôm one gathered large groups protesting. It‚Äôs fucking fault. Sorry that, i'll keep thinks topic weeks later

BRASIL CAMPE√ÉO MUNDO!! might die unnecessarily, least we'll utter idiots it. long virus survive refrigerated produce?? MSNBC clickbait fake news. Disregarding kind conspiracy theories roughly 200,000 people US died year previous record. bad flu season four times worst flu season since 1918 right return, country duty slow return speed allows maintain zero new outbreaks. 3 2 1, keep flatlined beautiful zero. 

I wouldn‚Äôt allow Americans country vaccine effective treatment. Countries survive year without tourist dollars nation. it: think happen them; think already back November bad case flu. taking Chloroquinine believe immortal. revel appearing strong kicking weak down. happiness lies suffering perceive enemies, anything make suffering happen worth it. change mine every day, thats fine Sure. better comparison last Sunday numbers today better last week. Like stated below.

Not celebrating anything want people see holes reported. post Sundays! can't really help walking sidewalk sandwiched tables cars sneeze comes on. People didn‚Äôt much listening even lockdown. far soft never gave us foundation move forwards of. sucks. tone sub really changed since February must already rich not, workers get proper fucked ass us. Pay much lower much shit pay heard really interesting interview Allie Bell guy Lancet morning. guest first cautioning idea vaccine all. bummer hear, said many viruses tried develop vaccine failed. said best circumstance, vaccines always 100% effective, cases 100% population actually receive given vaccine. people young old, kind pre-existing condition make vaccination dangerous.

His basic concluding point remember vaccine vaccine, going back ever way things were. even vaccine, virus going us long time, sooner accept going change approach daily life include wearing masks public time, going continue United States see infection rates grow. sobering. also refreshing, hear unvarnished truth. think concern virus wet meat spreading chopped (like already detected virus Beijing market's chopping board), getting elsewhere, including onto customer's hands. trump manages kill pre existing condition protections Obamacare fuuuuuuucked. haven‚Äôt seen that, link? Fuck would‚Äôve loved see Many Americans care freedom wear mask fellow countrymen guess cnn update headlines wonderful Europe handled covid19 gonna ignore daily deaths going huh? deem risk low faculty staff then? Teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, custodians etc...? saddest part isn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt take much suppress virus first thought. Mask wearing moderate social distancing trick, long term, full-on lockdowns aren‚Äôt needed.

But that‚Äôs STILL good enough people. wear mask avoid bars political rallies 6-12 months, still
have functional society. US, it‚Äôs apparently akin slavery mandate mask wearing, we‚Äôre opting eventual collapse health system 1 million deaths.

It‚Äôs insanity. $$,$$$.¬¢¬¢ Fuck off. know factor dumb fucks wearing masks country deserves gets electing first time. Try once... covid stacks deem risk low faculty staff then? Teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, custodians etc...? &lt;insert american comment showcasing inability grasp think pop density way it. Naaa, totally fine US. Rememebr many people united states. NEARLY 10X POPULATION ITALY. Also, grow move parents house become adults Italiana cant bad economy multiple generations living home. Young killing old home, actually sad. Severity decreased. testing more. ifr dripping predicted llnl start. 

The strain spreading ny parts us perhaps infectious deadly original Wuhan strain. """"Live let god"" I've told strategy. Disney sucks Oh great. always thought scariest part movie kitchen scene towards end. know person New York gets mugged ever 30 seconds? bet he‚Äôs getting really tired that. There's going magical new evidence proves go back time live way pandemic.

The southern states stay open want.. 911 stops working, people dying hospital hallways waiting treatment, people going want go restaurants bars.

 one willfully halts economic activity, done alternative pretty. also true people wearing masks, less likely hands would come contact whatever people exhaling.


And fewer people wearing masks likely someone spewing Covid19 everything. 

Sure may touch mask, wash sanitize, touch something. that's much smaller spot may also touch. Forget wash sanitize, touch face mask. probably way less likely walking cloud Covid-19 settling surfaces 6ft radius may touch. Mortality isnt thing watch specially covid could reinfect person years time eat mortality becomes thing talk about... wont let coward push far, opening country seems going going down, hospitalizations do. getting better identifying infected, containing further.

Friday: US testing anywhere else, imagine confirmed cases we'd see testing much countries??

Sunday: US cases Europe!

Gotta unsub here. place whack. wear mine get house, wash hands properly right take put mask directly washing machine instead carrying it. can't exactly close food plants without much larger issue, find food causing transmission fucked. blame anti-science anti-government culture. divert money police military healthcare? Yes sure lot people make distinction. Curbside Takeout much preferred delivery passes fewer hands process. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 54,000 new cases Brazil single day?? understand point I'm getting downvoted? restrictions lifted. see people following rules, what's problem? Imagine that, people neither doctors virologists taking advice nations foremost experts instead making go along! Sweden done worst what?  pandemic pretty much - look deaths. NL.  deaths noise. 

Meanwhile US, Canada, we'll wearing masks sheltering place indefinitely. percentage positive tests. test 5000 people 500 positive, got positive rate 10%. test 50,000 people 500 positives, rate 1%. surface may say, well means we're tests rate goes (or down) accordingly. true. thing statistics is, play long game data have, likely accurate. 

A figure gets thrown around lot days Texas 4000 positive tests per day. figure meaningless unless look many tests done compare numbers back March, example. here's example using **made-up numbers**: Texas 4000 positives 20,000 tests. Back April 500 positives 10,000 tests. testing doubled positives quadrupled, therefore virus widespread then. Again, I'm pulling numbers ass make example. hope made point understand test numbers positives meaningless without comparing numbers previous dates, testing important. actually going visit Canada next year! I‚Äôve watching lot vlogs it! Recently strategy preventing going war, using Swedes build travel system mountains/slopes. Im still learning country make visit/decision move there. really appreciate rapid transit systems kinda ashamed America hasn‚Äôt made switch money greed. lot Americans chase wealth rather pursuing happiness. Oh god please stop calculating death rate like that, stupid. Check CDC's report infectivity death rate see matches common flu.

No calculate dividing tests deaths. like say ""only 10 people common cold last year tested 10 people""

Antibody testing revealed huge chunk population already it. Go back school sweetie. matter. experiment whether acting (masks lockdown effective) vs acting effective (control group) think I'm ok part control group regardless outcome. I'd rather react outcome underreact much worse outcome.  Death rates decline though, new hospitalizations mostly steady. government taking responsible approach

There's problem. US, try apply word ""responsible"" government. Stop holding government accountable, also enjoy high case numbers.

/s doubt that, think groups want best spot possible Rare Well Tulsan never really shut all. get traitor chiefs rally, protests, juneteenth celebrations, gun show, home garden show weekend. cases rising drastically since ""fully opening"" memorial day weekend. I'm going wearing mask forever 1 20 wear masks Oklahoma. Fun times alive America. uk, think schools feasibly reopen autumn? (september) read voice Frankie Muniz. speak soon easily come back moral superiority virus protest can‚Äôt get infected ü•∫ü•∫ Thank you! That's pretty damning article. Masks outside make little difference. Masks shops protect staff anything. Masks work places social gatherings make big difference. quickly read paper listed. stopped reading said ALMOST legions formed human tissue. legions all, I'll take instead. Schools going wait last possible moment announce definitive plans, unfortunately. understandable want make announcements prematurely change plans, certainly frustrating. prediction going lot schools offering person classes option students concerned health live vulnerable people opt online equivalent. Worldometer isn‚Äôt great accurate numbers tbh. Try went Arizona buy car found way cheaper anywhere around (Ohio). Currently en route back Ohio. far it‚Äôs mixed bag COVID responses. arizona, Lyft driver told us ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wear mask‚Äù didn‚Äôt want to, wife ‚Äúdid research‚Äù felt like everything blown proportion; ‚Äúfriend COVID said worse cold‚Äù. Cool, tell person infect self-centered ignorance. 

As soon got New Mexico, signs face masks required everywhere. really late hadn‚Äôt eaten fast food places even open. Good you, New Mexico, taking seriously. Considering Arizona neighbor hotbed, don‚Äôt blame you. 

Upper Texas Oklahoma 50/50. general public people wearing masks, staff witnessed least masks, toll booth operators masks gloves. 

We‚Äôre currently Springfield, Missouri I‚Äôm completely gobsmacked level disinterest masks social distancing. Stopped travel stop. single staff person wearing mask, convenience store conjoining Subway Taco Bell. We‚Äôre hungry decided forgo getting food. Many weren‚Äôt even wearing gloves. cashier, older woman, actually *sneered* checking out, assume wearing mask, friendly otherwise. single person wearing mask, save couple stopping gas drinks New York plates. Everyone passed inside convenience store stared me. don‚Äôt get it. COVID nothing political hoax Missouri? Absolutely astonishing. We‚Äôll going St. Louis, Illinois Indiana, see anything else like I‚Äôll update. Hopefully St. Louis better I‚Äôd like eat something hot overpriced gas station food. Letting Darwinism play isnt plan? How? 

Are hinting conspiracy afoot produce lethal viruses make money vaccines hospitalizations? honestly dont think hospitalizations money maker, since many people arent showing treated diseases elective surgeries. Vaccines different matter. 

As viruses happen, thrive bat bird populations viruses, way are, cannot transmit humans. But, pigs pangolins viruses. also catch bat bird virus. within rare pig specimen, bat virus recombine pig virus create nasty SARS type pathogen, transmitted humans. 

Yes, possibility exists scientists could deliberately recombine viruses lab. dont see would even to, since SARS1 came wet market already understood epidemiologists matter short time SARS2 came along pathway. want accountability, start opposing animal trade, especially pigs exotics. like bacon hate get SARS2. Unlikely ways. grandmother. assets either liquidated transferred family members eligible Medicaid, picks bill long term care. way would bankrupted parents, retired themselves. system set family members way better financially everyone dies suddenly age 75 linger around past 90 expensive debilitating illnesses. It‚Äôs pretty serious problem people living much longer retirement assets last. think coronavirus mutating different strains. travel mostly shut down, going see quite variants opinion feel like police acted towards protesters emphasizes right gun(s) important. 

If continue suppress freedom speech/right protest, without weapons could people do? Read quickly thought T-Rex contracted coronavirus. Online/updated..

Education behind part progress used pro forma situations like this..

And lockdown would last 6 weeks.. thats life shattering.. thing is(fear) hope it‚Äôs negative you, hope it‚Äôs mild heal quickly! Thanks responsible! Glad work reasonable too, know people risk losing jobs it‚Äôs easy circumstances same. great history respiratory illness, dad major risk factors going anything risky. Oh yes 100%. hoping might able get see flaws logical pointing issues argument, knows really change anyone‚Äôs mind reddit... way convenient poop test I‚Äôve doing. don‚Äôt think civilised country would want US fail. I'm homebody too, work bunch people embarrassed wear mask flat say fake...and youngest history lung issues. He's finally started breathing normally past three four weeks. He'll one next week. Scared death I'm going bring home him. Honestly fall scares most. we‚Äôre seeing right 100% continuation first wave, bring colder weather well people ignoring pandemic regular flu re-enters scene? Definitely potential good. Thats good. Pepsi never accused worrying Chinese workers' lives production. 

Seems like Chinese government told shut down. post about? western Europe tell Bavaria Texas Germany!!

I'd say Austria like Texas. supposed reach 13 lakh cases begining May. nearly start July 4 lakh cases. Italy‚Äôs death rate 573.1 per million compared US‚Äôs 373.3 per million. Leo literally doctor though. seeing recently. I'm wearing mask consistently now. kinda weird going local shop wearing one one though. government dithered masks point one thinks matter. Europe's gonna take hit economically lack American 
Chinese tourists lol, sure. It‚Äôs much worse peak people aren‚Äôt taking half seriously middle March. Fucking mind blowing actually ton discussion going within appropriate fields, example: . Outside air ventilation always % recirculated air. air outside hot hard mix 15-20% maintain indoor temps. Work done recommendations increase well strategies improve air quality reduce transmission inside spaces USA still ~750 deaths per day. 

UK ~100

Spain ~10

Italy ~50

I think get point can't even get people States pull pants. expect get wearing masks? thought Germans good taking orders blindly? Hydroxychloroquine*. someone reads decides drink fish cleaner ‚ÄúChloroquine‚Äù laying around. are. Though Brazil seems catching quickly.

Whether something **want** number 1 another question. honestly faith America point. cases going mean over. one telling stay inside anymore, hard wear goddamn mask? Coronasaurus Per capita tests good indicator except guys burn 5G cell towers cause cause corona selfishness stupid burns. hope infect anyone family. brain comprehend fact far UVC (222nm) special properties penetrate human skin induce eye damage like 250nm UVC???? Read papers spreading misinformation. recluse live comfortably minimum wage US don‚Äôt live major city like NYC SF  I've heard plenty HEPA filters opening windows.

I think reason font hear businesses renovating thei places increased airflow prohibitively expensive.

I'd also imagine unknowns there. imagine possible air flow could greatly increase carry distance done wrong create dangerous area. happens something happens job?

That's massive risk, health insurance tied employment thought (The US) decided herd immunity new new strategy protesting important US suppressed smoking tobacco. Europe not. Can't suppress virus? suppress testing. Croatia great lockdowns, civil awareness/compliance numbers reduction soon news shifted upcoming elections('funny' simmilar things world) quietly opened border 0 fucks suddenly given EConOmy SUmmeR :O Monday typically lowest number week Florida represents data/tests process Sunday less people working. see big jump back Tuesday. think Chinese scientists understand well anyone else actual risk incredibly low. They've importing food months without single case linked last week, countries like Taiwan/Vietnam/NZ also importing food completely new clusters pop result it, they've tested 100,000+ food imports found zero positive results.

Like mass testing Wuhan, believe large part restore public confidence. degree Americans underreacting COVID, Chinese somewhat overreacting (compared rational risk reaction be). News COVID found salmon cutting board (not even salmon cause) caused Beijing consumers avoid buying salmon *overnight*. 

In reality, seem finding good test, trace &amp; isolate program, new outbreaks seem infect somewhere 100 - 1000 people worst case get suppressed. theory, completely rational adults, new cluster every month completely acceptable tradeoff. fact, clusters better allows us learn surgical treating cluster less economic impact (eg: Beijing switched finer grained, neighbourhood level risk management vs district level &amp; city level used Chaoyang/Shulan/Mudanjiang etc.).

But course,the human brain work way overboard level ""virus fighting theater"" useful help reassure 1.4B people across China even temporarily causes economic disruption people targeted. defense, saying phases started. They've honestly quiet company. press releases seriously mostly announce new phases trials.

It especially noticeable started actually started testing people Oxfird, Oxford dominated news.

Apparently, Moderna significant amount cyber attacks, though, staying quiet could seen one way protect themselves.  thing remember cases happening Maharashtra Delhi situation control. places, cases low enough contact tracing.v Numerous places ""No referral necessary, bill federal government!"" testing. Even boonies. understand problems getting tested. never said I'm leaving house. traveling dense urban areas while. area perfect going socially distanced mini-road trips. Especially right summer. Education nonessential one gives shit anymore. Businesses can‚Äôt take another hit everyone‚Äôs tired staying inside. USA split smaller divisions? hope he's right, he's exactly unbiased source information.  surprised all, Americans notoriously bad following instructions Wrong. One cause behind every single surge: many people close other. actually pretty fucking simple. Sure, cough likely symptom virus. might sneeze week, definitely could cough day clear throat. look curve Germany 2-3 weeks warning compared France, Spain Italy

France, Germany Spain almost warning time. Germany ICUs begin with. US country, small European countries also countries. difference context? US bigger mean better living conditions lower class citizens /everyone make piles cash. magnitude problems really incredible. UK one worst death rates world. Almost like there's pattern this. Oh, thought would shut whole ""bUt cDc NuMbErS!"" line, [here go, went ahead ran math numbers, CDC says rate *worse* - 266 times deadlier. context cultural/political nonsense US. US ""small"" countries choose spend money bombs guns instead houses healthcare. two people ICU due COVID-19 Australia zero deaths month now. Unfortunately positive cases still coming Victoria states including NSW seeing overseas arrivals managed quarantine new cases. Mater time comes back, theres already reported cases small uncontrolled virus spikes Scotty ‚ÄúWe‚Äù society ‚ÄúMe‚Äù. Rampant individualism conducive successful public response pandemic. work unionized manufacturing plant. company keeping mouths shut, citing hipaa. way anyone knows what's going union page. Ok , Italy 3900 total cases per 1M USA 7000 

Also italy current active cases 20000 compared total cases 238000 , US still half total cases active cases. Yeah people keep saying make feel better... Unfortunately, think AZ hosed. If, Ducey's IQ compassion levels tripled somehow, he'd realize dire straits state order lockdown. However, Ducey still Ducey he'll react way late prevent lots unnecessary sickness death. matter much inside not. People gathering = spreading disease. either dumb lying think otherwise. honestly energy states (at least town MO). agree public places social distancing struggle, masks on. Everywhere else seems grey area consumer traffic certain areas always possibly significant bit due virus. start going people currently gung ho economy finally get hit Covid death family fall ill themselves.

I feel stage we‚Äôre life like school comes back. true tests begin ‚Äúkids can‚Äôt die this‚Äù ‚Äúkids essentially carriers‚Äù theories play out, latter probably worse kids love spread shit around, possibly even knowing they‚Äôre spreading around. alarmed, everybody. 

It's working way disappearing. Experiment (which tried): wear mask catch eye someone wearing mask. *always* avert eyes. know wrong! South Asians concentrated cities seeing covid impact. LOTS mixed generation households. isn‚Äôt ever mentioned, lot US citizens Obamacare like family. don‚Äôt really pay anything get sick.

The town live 2 deaths, 20 positive cases 40,000 population. live one least affected areas Spain. think I'm careless, that's you. world 200,000 deaths extremely good result.  not.. seen global cases, deaths? bad enough there's people like understand science, ones criticize others wearing mask really drive crazy. last thing need judgment ignorant imbecile we're trying protect loved ones people even know.

Fuck guys like that. taiwan didn‚Äôt test much, took measure similar japan‚Äôs I‚Äôm go tomorrow first times months since lockdown took place. never really worn mask pandemic. What‚Äôs correct way wear someone glasses would stop idiots (Karen‚Äôs) pulling mask down? Super nervous idiots know I‚Äôll fine Yes! upvote, upstanding citizen!

Translation : dumb understand single thing everything selfish fuck ready kill people god know's read conclusion APPEARS testing needed. good luck. Checkmate! Idk man Disney World pretty badass. ""minimal use"" public transportation. Every bus train rode packed. India hardcore lockdown beginning unsustainable long run. Given population density conditions live in, find basically impossible keep control :( I‚Äôm interested 1% speak of. Arizona deaths always low weekends. It'll show mon/tues USA 7 10 times population 7 70 times new daily deaths? right? think indicates US quickly catching deaths per capita San Francisco we're 16 cases day last 7 day average. That's population 800K+ 2nd densest city US.

Most people wear masks outside everyone inside. hard. People gathering protest = people walking park. Right, way could win one huge straw man. Think part U.K. there‚Äôs hordes people going beaches protests cases still dropping, they‚Äôre shrugging point. Yep. live around area hardly anyone wears masks. do, get borderline ridiculed. City buildings openly said requiring masks, etc. It‚Äôs bad. CDC fundamentally good organization populated lot highly trained talented scientists. Unfortunately, Trump administration wrapped impenetrable shell incompetent political hacks. get Covid, get Covid, EVERYONE gets Covid, yay!  Paid what? senior party. people celebrate last year high school college. paid endorsed school. think so. company could ruined work out. They'll lose shit ton backers, that's company runs on. Ma'am Wendy's I'm going make major adjustments lifestyle held directly responsible it. virus suppressed ... sub dumb They'll get stable that's it. They're going treat cancer anything serious, make sure still alive release you. 


Poor people able get check ups dentist appointments eye glasses uninsured absolutely shitshow. Finland practicing social distancing since beginning time :) I‚Äôm frankly relieved testing agree wholeheartedly masks, claiming Qatar freedoms really evidenced reality. [Freedom gives state 7/40 political rights 18/60 civil liberties, total 25/100 ""Not Free"" rating. 

The state's [Democracy 3.19/10 ""Authoritarian"" ranks 136th worst 167 nations. metric features standout scores like 0.00 electoral process, 2.2 political participation, 3.8 civil liberties.Democracy equal rights, excellent indicators other. 

In [Polity data series, Qatar scores 0-10 total -10 ""Full Autocracy."" hope well mask process, good thing national unity something like pandemic defense, mean rights equal even approaching states. ‚ÄúPatients mild symptoms low concentration alpha defensin,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúPatients strong disease symptoms high levels. people die high levels.‚Äù

This vital information. Elsewhere article Doctor says over-the-counter blood thinners aren‚Äôt effective blood clots form different mechanism normal. Finding good alpha defensin inhibitor would help quell many lethal symptoms disease. Canada whole (pop 35M) peaked 2,000 cases per day, reporting 300-400 per day. Arizona, 1/5th population, reported 3,200 new cases yesterday. going really bad get control. Agreed.

But regardless attraction isn‚Äôt*** Good luck. That's what's destroying us CFR low. even close. Yes Americans think coronavirus ended like months ago. states pretty well. mostly Florida, California, Texas Arizona bringing numbers up. post worthy news every time one gets COVID? they‚Äôll learn herd way. lot dead morons first. get ‚Äúit first friday bars could open‚Äù? open since mid-May Denmark. Except case neighbor roof also taps house garden hose spraying full blast gutters True L.A. County real problem California even close. added 19,320 last 14 days alone. surrounding Counties (San Bernardino County, Orange County, San Diego County, Ventura, Riverside, Imperial) cumulatively 10,161 cases added past 14 days. LA County nearly half *all* California's cases. Masks may red/blue issue (which stupid -wear goddamn mask) worst spread blue parts state. someone talks population density, yeah shit, I'm one brought red/blue. Per usual L.A. needs get shit together. don‚Äôt want people like country 

typical racist think really depends state. situation fluid. Regions hit hard March/April seeing marked escalation &amp; spread, difficult say whether it'll subside August. Another factor budgetary pressure private schools. USC hotzone LA announced they're going full steam-ahead in-person classes. institutions probably figuring certain percent student body &amp; staff get infected &amp; potentially hospitalized, they're willing deal fallout. think cases public pressure surrounding community force go online. hate say general consensus under-25 collegiate demographic really wants return campus &amp; resume classes despite risks. ‚òÜJeff Bezos agrees‚òÜ least go Disney die though. Good you! ""I'll taunt huge guy, could go wrong? Oh yeah, physically exist...""   Where's data showing acute spikes protests?

There any. live SW Florida people (except 65+) never acted like virus real. Almost one wears mask public forget social distancing. Cases Florida rose 3,000 day, multiple times week alone! 

I taken thing seriously husband compromised immune system. go to, always wear mask. However Governor best friends Trump continues ignore signs opening state further. false sense security means people going spreading faster before. ""harm kids"" cases kids almost asymptomatic.

There outbreak daycare center live way back in, iirc, March. Long started testing anyone sick enough hospitalized basically. Given this, everyone linked none kids tested one member staff 2-3 parents got it. 

I would hazard guess one reason widely reported happened US military base. hear often Texas, can‚Äôt say anywhere else. 1.476 Americans per European. Lol what? Spoken like someone use system.

They send debt collectors, tank credit.

If lucky reduce bill provide payment plan low interest rate. But, United States stops testing anymore COVID 19 cases /conservativelogic case ""things hard"". interstates roads go across state borders never set crossings able monitored. live 20 miles two state borders cross either one via dozens different streets interstates. realistically achievable. borders countries, fewer crossing points one set appropriate level volume. Yeah...like what??

I think Bernie's M4A plan 4% tax employees 7.5% tax employees? $10,000 per year health insurance premiums insane problem fighting right now.

Also South?? feeling OC never South. extreme poverty, oppressively humid, part void well paying jobs. really understand people wearing mask. hurting I'm it. killing hospitalizing people. consider freedom harming others. Also worth noting EU 100M people US, it‚Äôs even worse numbers seem. No. That's means. making numbers assumptions nothing what's going on. Something like 40 60 percent deaths originated tri-state area. Deaths b/c Notheast bottomed well states experienced early outbreaks. 

Deaths happen immediately - almsot 30 day lag add lag deaths infection plus documenting happens actual death reported. 

Most likely scenario deaths reach lowest point end month begin tick July. unless current outbreaks get NY levels bad probably see anymore 2000 day deaths. Population size

USA ~ 331 million 

UK ~ 66 million 

Spain ~ 46 million 

Italy ~ 60 million 

What missing here? lot? Lol different feel quality life individual working minimum wage able go doctor they're sick, vs waiting letting something get point emergency fees mentioned could waived? Healthcare America *is* expensive. Yeah I‚Äôm dead typing comment. 2 brain cells appear flickering out. Sorry loss. Thanks. personally, ""all"" mask reminding people we're pandemic makes us keep distance. good. wear one. might overgeneralizing Europe. I'm Spain I'd say 80-90% people wear masks outside pretty much 100% inside. went large department/grocery store first time yesterday see single person inside without one, hundreds people there. mostly see groups teenagers without outside, even usually them, pulled pocket. saw protest (if even call that. vandalizing businesses) city 95% people weren‚Äôt wearing masks social distancing. Coming family lot high risk family members, aggravates people stopped giving shit virus people bitching minging beachgoers church goers people think gathering huge masses across country a-ok. much cost dental check ups shit America also? I‚Äôd curious vet bills aswell, get shafted vets uk Cool... us lost insurance tied jobs couldn‚Äôt afford insurance declare medical bankruptcy....? still spreading FUD face-masks? subreddit pretty set going outside unnecessary stuff. things need do.

How much actually necessary? That's idea. many ""need"" do's groceries. visit bars required.

100% unnecessary adding onto future issues fellow countrymen. exactly mean following rules mean careless. Well, technically vaccines, they're still testing phases. ""produced market"" best answer.

The company actually 10 years old, know normal timelines vaccines, that's shocking. looked quite bit start pandemic.

It's pop company pandemic, definitely motivated prove create viable vaccine. Zika vaccine, believe, also phase 2 testing right now, 1st vaccine they're testing. probably true; among developed nations, US probably longest tail far. Possibly, unique nature large widely distributed population. locked Trump says purposefully told team slow testing. Why?

""This thread locked due purely political nature responding comments."" Mod

This subreddit fucking joke. I'm glad stupid peasants dying place. quite funny. work office Copenhagen masks...but makes sense due low case count. Like new cowpox?

Forgive I'm wrong - time - people would inoculated smallpox? Nah man put belt turning key ignition. Get ready drive, drive Yes. injected polio vaccine prevents disease, infection. Israel polio outbreak years ago one got sick. detected virus raw sewage, found vaccinated kids recently infected. USA BAD!

Karma please! Asia, people wearing masks since January, Asia far better control virus Europe does. Thailand particular barely real outbreak lockdown. Excellent! I'm eager this. Hoping good news Aah. I'm Canada hear enough news churches continuing services, packed beaches bars, governors/mayors cautious others mask usage, etc. Let‚Äôs hope they‚Äôre responsible make transition new administration smooth. words describe administration, responsible isn‚Äôt one them. Preparing elude responsibility. Northern Italy I'd say close 100% possible exception littlest kids babies. 

What worries restaurants opened up. need masks inside eating gets crowded. went friends dinner regretted it. probably last time while. Uhhh yeah that's things work China. 4000 counting...its like american citizens involved great experiment.... I'm sorry :(

I think lot people intentionally trying confuse everyone thinking safe. packed together assembly line. It‚Äôs travesty become primary care.

Those guys ones readily made hospitalists important pandemic response we‚Äôve destroying relative earnings decades monetary emphasis procedures. despite well established notion high quality full scope primary care top field medicine comes overall health longevity.

Some smartest guys knew wife‚Äôs time medical school went primary care, make fraction worth work incredibly hard.

It‚Äôs awful. never said was, I‚Äôm explaining one reason Americans don‚Äôt see many sick people hospitals news twitter like China Italy. People went claiming Bolsonaro nothing lost control outbreak believing he's mastermind behind it. idea pull testing data Oklahoma? five weeks 4th July, school starts again. Governors serious pressure open classes, even cases spiking, parents work. bad it‚Äôs been, fall season potential much worst. Wow irony. trying fun helping economy getting back call selfish? Meanwhile aren‚Äôt helping anyone businesses staying locked basement. sounds much selfish me. get want play video games day getting called hero subreddit rest world moving on. build field hospitals keep asking everyone socially distance one cares. 

There 2 YouTube channels based Mumbai Delhi, 2 worst hit cities. semi-freely roaming around. educated illiterates behave like that, can't expect much. Hate break French selectively wearing masks. I've seen Paris smaller city. masks quarantine even though mandatory wear mask out. We're also less tests even US Turkey. Macrons rhetoric getting rid COVID becoming self sufficient, feel like we've done almost nothing improve situation. Except Trump, may ass backwards south one yours. Couldn‚Äôt said better simply streaming classroom time kids class. course switching back forth individual kids class whole cases come go.

It's zooming Fridays. posts here: ""That's potentially great! ...now let's see theory proven.""

There's much attention paid vaccines, might years off. Almost good would development treatments turn Covid fairly minor inconvenience. No. rising AZ gets tourists CA? I'm lifelong Arizonan that's news lol get upvotes don‚Äôt understand people either. Wearing mask lower moment start spreading air + droplets. That‚Äôs walking around empty gun put magazine point people talk them. strawman argument, Nextstrain data populated using COVID test samples, entire problem early suspect cases / death still could get tested.

What know Nextstrain 3 main types virus, current dominant one Type C DG614 mutation, Wuhan strain type B, prior Type that, recently, found equal numbers US Chinese samples.

Until recently, Chicago cases type shit hole country currently true, from. Lol sure guys! Nice joke, considering even prepare first one! Yeah, 'Murica. ## Exactly! ##

Feels like high school experience again. took decades people figure things stimulus loan, pay back take it. take thinking fun money. Wow, I've never heard before. sound like font fresh original thoughts. thought gone moved on? /s would result huge number lives lost. American levels. like imagine there's better way fewer deaths. and.. perhaps lot idiots. GTFO. Stop denying science. protests absolutely going contribute cases. 

People calling others science deniers literally forget science virus case protests. want point multiple governments working together flatten European curve. Literal MULTIPLE governments multiple leaders come different cultures speak different languages, yet still worked together suppress covid. 

Our one, unilingual, single-leader government US needs get fucking shit together. news, sky blue, politicians corrupt cops racist. moved London. master's company sponsored visa. selfish hypothetically taking bed plenty avaliable? logic fear mongerers like get make trials humans. Let's pray works. Really sounds like best breakthrough since beginning illness. Let's take look...

If use stats above. completely unreliable source course. let's try sake argument:

USA: 750 331,000,000 = 2.26^(6)

UK: 100 66,000,000 = 1.51^(6)

Spain: 100 46,000,000 = 2.17^(6)

Italy: 50 60,000,000 = 8.33^(7)

I'd say US close Spain. UK ahead Italy way ahead according data.

Now course Italy experienced serious pandemic wave (1st, 2nd, 3rd whatever) good month reported countries. we'd expect ahead like this??

To me, ~~this data~~ stats show Italy ahead three nations.

edit: mentioned data unreliable. fair they're indicators approximations anyways. Risked lives?

Lol. consuming much US state propaganda.

I watched video. people decontaminating, street fights, busy hospitals.

China isnt think is. brainwashed. Take visit whenever flights open up. still license plate long take responsibility everything problem. Basically motorcyclists. Today press conference didnt even know, many workers missing... That‚Äôs experience driving Italy CH DE etc totally unimpeded get fun parties anywhere. 4% + 7,5% close $10k per year lot Americans. mean something else? Thats good question. also article 5 days ago. Lol exactly. Luckily he‚Äôs moving 10 days. wait end isolate rest country. Build field hospitals etc ""the CDC limiting California ‚Äî state 39 million people ‚Äî eight 10 cases week."" almost like want know. Stay school don‚Äôt afraid stand right. Whatever takes. I've wary U.S. news articles Sweden, since many conservative news outlets want use Sweden say U.S. shut down. news articles vague, look statistics turns Sweden well. Yep right here,

europe total given lot tests US (you count countries want get full score whatever much US checked per million european countries listed even though lot shown tested more, sum 2x [Georgia, College town toward northeast state. Damn r/COVID19 discussion widely endorsed scientific call retract paper claimed airborne transmission dominant. paper lot problems. edited epidemiologist virologist. made plenty unfounded assumptions.

This say masks important. are.

So handwashing. largest effect I've seen reducing respiratory disease transmission CDC endorsed study handwashing (5x day, 45% reduction.)

Wear mask whenever public. Wash hands 30 seconds. PPE shortages may screwed too, weren‚Äôt provided supply company ran out. 

No essential industry spared. state used live sister needed hire biohazard clean company brother passed April. called 4 companies, 3 told didn‚Äôt PPE effectively closed. Nevermind important business would middle pandemic people dying home infectious disease, along causes services may required... state gall seize PPE hands companies needed **less** (although still needed it!) hospitals. 

My job couldn‚Äôt get N95s months (even it‚Äôs spotty; going get KN95s China) despite presence known hazards job. Yup. Good thing learned math without numbers mechanics(physics) it‚Äôs really helped far get variable shock umm, what? nobody involved studies antibody testing got antibody tests? 

what world talking about? That's true all. Ok cool. think agree then, confused way worded first comment post wanted clarify wasn‚Äôt meant. interpreted said one southern state buck trend prove lockdowns don‚Äôt work. 

But yes south good test exponential increase (bc increase peak somewhere). Unfortunate experiment cause get sick die. everyone else measure see ohow much spreads reaches peak starts fall whether hospitals able handle type surge HIPAAs fault, weird take. \[Oprah entered chat\] Bullshit. Well Europe less infected US everything started one month before. second worst country Brazil. can't say they're good job. Many people do, people don't.  No. principle, agree wearing masks mandatory mandate enforced. However, issue enforcement. Specifically: going enforcing? Owners managers businesses afraid try, fear safety. Afaik there's hardly cases around Pompey. Queen Alexandra hospital within couple miles live think way past worst. lot deaths peak gone right down. supposed see doctor recently appointment videocall instead, thought great idea long use tech. everyone able to. Saves going hospital though. 

Hopefully second spike. That's main thing. really sucks üòî places get away shit one cares enough go visit. people visited saw conditions, shit would changed years ago. ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äô George ‚Äòpersistent covid‚Äô too, according final autopsy! It‚Äôs wonder could breathe!! Hope officers didn‚Äôt get it. face mask??! 

The protests &amp; looting shameful &amp; destructive. Change rules limit holds everyone. Get job Go back work. police enforce it? supposed enforce laws government enacts? don't. 

That's thing freedom. know much pay per year, depend 100% free healthcare, Argentina divide taxes insurance free healthcare go hospital preference emergency denied treatment worry getting terrible debt hurting yourself. almost like Canada system corruption ‚Äçü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è guess depends normal sensitivity is? take estimation answer yes, overly sensitive making comment? live estimation. 

To explain thought process, hackles raised saw German slaughterhouse + Romanians + ""people like this"" ... thought might addressing Nazi. guess get sensitive around Nazis...but whether level sensitivity qualifies ""overly"" really eye beholder. fauci recently said lied help secure enough masks hospitals such. Pretty scummy that's government you. do. think he's thrilled prospect Werder vs HSV relegation match either... Anyone think intentional Bolsonaro‚Äôs part? wants let poor, indigenous, underclass die Fauci's original advice February reversed mask recommendation admitted making recommendation wanted hospital staff get dibs N95 masks true nordic countries all. South Carolina 16.1 percent increase. little change previous day 16.2. Perhaps data backlog (wtf anyway)... 

but real stat... 50% hospitalizations last 7 days, around 2200 3200. People returning work jobs open back up. even workers required wear masks general public 9 10 times not. matter time workers get sick spread parents grandparents. Don‚Äôt forget kids, New York City‚Äôs d√©cline cases basically responsible bulk decline see here! They‚Äôre hard do, pulled off, outstanding.

Both Us China trying version. Hopefully work riots. Happened. participating bad faith discussion? Natural selection. problem care, happily spread anyone else inevitably get it. 90+% survivability...why people still shitting bricks this? Go live life. Don‚Äôt let fear mongering media hounds scare living life. Well there's already massive improvements treatment, ""inevitable"" happens tomorrow death rates lower.  doesn‚Äôt help president, supported half population voted, shrugging off. Trump said anything coherent, anything encourage population wear masks, would best thing could possibly do. People listen reason. wasn‚Äôt god damn idiot listened people like Dr Fauci, would made much progress. work close people cause it‚Äôs small shop he‚Äôs floor heavy machinery no, don‚Äôt yell although works group foreigners used yelling instead talking lol (tho I‚Äôm country people yell get it! Louisiana: uh, already turn!

(3000+ deaths) Yes places safety net protects people luck either unemployment benefits free healthcare. Culture change takes least years. Americans used litter everywhere. lot still far less common compared 50s. going back public stay home order lifted selfish jerk?

German site doubt identify seeing eyes black white picture. really dangerous right now! R value already risen, people laying routine. mess up, entire shutdown nothing. South Carolina go store less 10% people wearing masks. parents, even kids age, allowed request elearning. provide normal job, much harder due COVID.

So admin knows find way shorten time week students person (take Wednesday Friday two local schools discussing)to allow time provide quality distance learning. pay us hire new people distance learning (the hiring discussed, right worried HUGE funding cuts). can't even right.  two months now

Luck little it. We‚Äôre #1! /s  Anyone believes Trump wants reduce testing would transparent coronavirus outbreak last fall delusional.

China detected virus first performed genetic testing abnormal pneumonia patient samples, minimum done US things equal China would detected virus first.

Good care expensive. Literally needs space, one one supervision round clock. Unfortunately, many families can't afford pay that. get substandard care lower fees.

Thats important decent sized pension. pays good care. can't expect children, bills liabilities pay, shoulder care bills old. Lead Desantis!!!!!! got this!!!!! Tell like is!!!!!! tracing movement everyone big western countries. general authoritarian act easier contain virus like this. That's better COVID 19 itself, much puts fate vaccine hands scummy corporations. stopped wearing mask saw protests. lot people around here. I‚Äôm going continue shelter place wear mask two sets rules, one mob one rest us. fuck it, don‚Äôt care anymore. link contains video? anything collapsing street? post right link? It‚Äôs report someone dying covid.

I totally believe shutdowns, things happened overseas happen US. collapsing thing supposedly happened China (the evidence sketchy videos) places covid outbreaks. case something happening Wuhan didn‚Äôt happen elsewhere, happened all. fact believe testing/sampling accurately reported scaled correctly ignorant.

PPE still problem, testing starting fit acceptable standards, tested negative indicate prior. know believing 2% experience research methods execute critical thinking testing process valid based time-line reality situation.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide I'm Norway. Besides boyfriend, I've seen 5 people wearing masks.. one last 2 months so. Well lot people (at least Texas) followed governor‚Äôs recommendation leave house, go lives testing positive.

If people don‚Äôt wear masks don‚Äôt social distance, assume eventually get go dining in, grocery shopping, mall water parks. parts PA shitshow, though. live masks 50/50, totally unenforced run risk getting yelled *wearing* them. insane :( seen numerous people keep masks chins long time . suppose get participation trophe bringing mask even use it. set foot commercial building since early March. We've grocery delivery. forced kick tobacco habit, there's that. hurt personal level, feel terrible people work. I'm Illinois, bad traditionally governance, we're pretty well compared rest US COVID-19. really hope nothing, overrun hospitals anyway people got bored nice out. *you younger.
Whatever man. get idea. Article 5 days ago. revolutionary think would gotten play now. depends numbers say. watches need synchronized covid, behavior mentioned safe, long numbers decreasing, we're contact tracing, testing virus antibodies, etc.

Given many states are, best, bare minimum required far testing, idea risky activities are, therefore assume risk high. way US normalized drug overdoses. Remote learning work five year olds way fifteen year olds. No. come worse every aspect.

No environment. health. arts. economy. social. freedom. justice. joy.

Forget used know get used never forget, today last best day rest life. first time hearing this, thanks. would make sense people criticizing words, statements decisions.

Instead, people talking president drinking sippy cups, potty trained, fondling porn stars.

Which every single one threads ends as. DeSantis seems surprised. be. agree, extremely important reopening.

I mean, something would strange go 100% back normal numbers spike. US ever gets healthcare option costs $10k year 

... country, universal healthcare costs us $750 year. fuck would anyone willing pay 10k year??? That's like 30% individual median income US. wonder able pro sports. Per million fair representation, ireland 70x less population america mean covid spreads 70x slower. bro even know saying. seem arguing defensive pacts allow countries Scandinavia divert spending away military. that's completely irrelevant fact US could spend money health care instead spend weapons. Scandinavian countries attempt metric personal happiness instead stocks go economy good. first wave end? Workers ride together save money. Oh really?! didn‚Äôt hear narrowed one company. Last heard narrowed chemical responsible, damage done. news stops following stories solved don‚Äôt report nearly enough answer/cause problem was. It‚Äôs news it‚Äôs problem. law certain organization reported conjecture caused something put forth equal effort correct incorrect equally report solution discovered. accurate get either. former co worker HIV positive, drinks right wing koolaid, posts FB time refuses sacrifice rights wear mask. 

I tried reasonable cause honestly really nice guy. ended blocking posts come conclusion cant reason people. put mask, act removing contaminate it, hands, anything mask touches.

So let's say three errands do: buy groceries, banking, buy tool hardware store. parking lot grocery store, put mask. buy groceries return car. keep mask driving bank, completing bank business, driving hardware store, making purchase there. Yeah right! nicer way look it. I've since day one, glad know gone mad. Bezos stone's throw away becoming trillionaire.

Uhhh... No? serious analysis, could (and should) adjust things. I'm mostly arguing notion consider EU countries separately US states. problem places like UK made mandatory. went Sainsbury's yesterday people wearing masks thebperson cleans trolleys Make great deal money. Save all.  Set things lawyer/guardian. Preferably choose place need it.  Visit it. Look around. Yeah, dude. difference leaders told us utmost importance spread virus, selfish murderer went home. Yet protest happens support sudden mouths shut fucking pandemic raving 3 months taking away people's rights, many cases unnecessarily.

Hypocritical leaders reason this. can't blame rest us saying ""fuck it"" leaders give stopping pandemic SAID dangerous stuff like protest, work, basically anything else reason. 


You want put food table? important enough. want massive amounts depression, suicide, drug overdose? Get it. want keep business worked whole life? matter murderer. Protesting bc rights infringed on? Protesting dangerous. protesting bc police brutality? Go destroy cities, spread virus without even trying social distance, kill innocent bystanders zero pushback, bc that's important anything else ever history Earth.

Now understand difference?

I support people protesting, whatever want. America. Mandatory lockdowns legal begin with. bother me. bothers hypocrisy. part, sudden leaders decided longer mattered. course I'm going continue staying home. Loooool fucking hilarious one wants acknowledge protesters' fault blames masks. really think masks would 
stop virus thousands people squashed together? Idiots. Oh, you! setup selling non sterile versions buddy white house! We'll go them, kthxbye. 3 degenerates walk bar... understand cases go CDC. faulty test kit screw-up this, 'According agency emails, county pathologist checked freezer tissue send CDC, discovered samples ‚Äútossed,‚Äù along tissue everyone else died prior March 11.'

WTF?! willful suppression evidence public knowing.

""If stop testing right now, we'd cases, actually."" - Donald Trump Well dad works NASA told there's reason one guy Nintendo corporation idea going anyone else, especially international vaccine trials. Oh no. provide medical advice

What kind sad, preventive measures. CDC guidance comes says masks prevent getting virus, doesn‚Äôt end mask debate? mean, people won‚Äôt wear really matter long one on? never said that. problem. literally said let's PRAY brings confirmation trials.  I'm done talking you. Go preach people drinking Tide. wasting time particular thread. So, big problem. Yeah I've spread whorecruxes there. rumple/rumpel, fore/4, etc. 

It'a always fun 'spiderman pointing spiderman' moment run other.

We share memories, describe speaks Depends Walmart not. someone please tell Governor DeSantis, Florida, effective way stop virus spreading require masks. argue sides though. one hand, keeping people needing health care good lead large resurgence. keeping manageable treatment reduce risk resurfaces future we‚Äôll resistance. 

On hand, people getting exposed potentially deadly virus bad could prevent it. 

I think deciding factor fact science seems tell us see virus rest lives way see common cold. keep infection treatable rate essentially mild amount future proofing compared preventing getting everyone first place. can‚Äôt go living masks 6ft apart forever. Sadly, it‚Äôs sustainable. 

Not mention virus‚Äô change mutate inevitable resurgence virus could worse majority population still hadn‚Äôt developed resistance USA president rally tho... attended well everyone attend sit real close pictures.



So got going them. There‚Äôs issue actually developing one works (already skeptical due us already trouble making effective vaccine seasonal flu) also able mass produce distribute global scale. community spread. can't find source. Also, today, seen widespread protests, multnomah county biggest increase cases today like 44 percent got approved phase one reopening last Friday. Mandatory mask wearing public go effect next week per governor mandate Don‚Äôt rude. Yeah that‚Äôs nice all. Rona.... I'm week 19 working home, grateful I'm able to. lockdown starting ease slowly things starting open definitely can't complain. believe medicare pays long term care anyone.  pay rehabilitation.   Medicaid pays care use personal assets half joint assets.  Medicaid pay much, BTW. Yes closed bad Shahob shut nothing like like countries course though Arizona here. niece works bar. haven‚Äôt wearing masks. Several coworkers sick tested positive Covid-19. niece continued work 2 days symptoms ‚Äúthought sinus infection‚Äù. test pending. exposed everyone bar. idiocy Arizonan‚Äôs. cocktails public worth getting sick over, risking huge hospital bill potentially killing family member. Wow! Unbelievable, they've known virus since mid-December, sooner, coming updated recommendation masks SOON. 

Can't make stuff up! Great. opening borders? Nicotine nicotine friend!! know someone got cancer jaw that.

Your dad‚Äôs moron RemindMe! 2 weeks can't it, it. coworker saw lady pull mask down, lick phone screen wipe mask. Hahhaha

Let's add Japan Swaziland we're it.

Bye now, I'm done here. see post US started Europe. deaths lag several weeks new cases. think gonna die first day catch virus... cant compare per capita populations countries without also considering comorbidity rates countries. US huge obesity prob, leads COVID deaths. co-morbidity rates comparable, heart disease, blood pressure, Type 2, etc, would much better actual comparison.  guarantee it? *guarantee* you‚Äôre wrong! clearly don‚Äôt work analytics anything requiring second level thinking, that‚Äôs absurd shockingly facile. I‚Äôd happily bet much $1,000 daily deaths don‚Äôt climb 2,000 point end August. effin‚Äô way!  

You clearly haven‚Äôt done homework, I‚Äôll lay salient points go enjoy remainder weekend. 

First, you‚Äôre wrongly making big mistake drawing consistent correlation case numbers today past case numbers tests scarce rationed. April median age covid positive tests high, per states actually provide info, 70 years-old enough tests prioritize at-risk people *severe* symptoms. median age 30s often identified return-to-work rules, hot spotting, contact tracing (mild symptoms typical case). Due *severe* age stratification virus, likelihood new case results death *dramatically* lower previously was. would take many, many multiples old case numbers ever produce daily death numbers two months ago. basic. 

Secondly, you‚Äôre wrongly projecting deaths forward large case spike, accounting falling deaths trailed equally large case numbers past. late April early May daily case numbers higher percentage people tested testing positive. means people nationally virus catching small portion infections. Yet 3-6 weeks 30k case days, cases consistently fell. Whether product better treatment, kind harvesting effect, combination factors, point argument can‚Äôt right since cases fell trailing wake massive cases numbers last time high now. can‚Äôt apply system thought one direction fails even work applied backward, direction. 

Lastly, something else may occurring globally virus don‚Äôt yet understand *attenuate* risk. Deaths Europe fallen dramatically (at downward slope quite similar one US) Italian virologists doctors claimed viral load seems weakened significantly cases they‚Äôre seeing now. may well occurring here, too. direction viruses almost always tend move - less lethal time. What‚Äôs more, you‚Äôre betting giant reversal MASSIVELY CONSISTENT global trend daily deaths. happen, something way beyond mere cases rising need occur - I‚Äôm seeing - virus would rapidly mutate way would make *extreme* historical outlier. 

I idea ‚Äúdo part America‚Äù sign mean, I‚Äôll tell wear mask I‚Äôm careful hell. let‚Äôs stop vapid virtue signaling online. It‚Äôs intellectually insulting infantilizing. There's many ways dementia patient die misadventure. Dementia terminal illness horrendous quality life. Yet families squawk demand miracles. 

In perfect world, patients would personal caretaker spacious room facility. know perfect answer current environment feel like family frequently realistic. live London, appauled bad poverty homelessness capital city. really bad.

Then visited New York. problems London seem pretty mundane comparison. Geez thought NJ bad 12%. acceptable? People outraged. Right, target USA economy, already isolated global pause. EU won‚Äôt need second wave propaganda deception. USA‚Äôs program continue thats it‚Äôs isolated vulnerable. 

But sorry, saying things allowed look source later. tell wear mask Wear mask. likelihood spreading drops dramatically. tour masks catches much prevents traveling far. likelihood catching diminished further. Thing may know two weeks. wear mask case. everyone works. healthy people almost 100% safe. living rock mountain ranges run North/South, scientific model flattening curve travel East/West get mountain. Americans decided run North/South mountain range. Good news US hospital capacity still within ""safe"" limits change Fall trend continues. Yes. Definitely. couple days old. Besides, newborn babies much risk kinds diseases anyway Corporate greed = carelessness.  apart EU, Norway opened travel countries like Denmark. think travels US (or sweden) allowed time soon. That's news me, live Denmark :)

It address lack affordable healthcare, affordable education even something basic proper unions, issues noticed living US. Let's add Germany mix, it'll water Nordic Model little, we'll end 110 million people better access healthcare, education social safety nets. husband able work home, got laptop, kid already homeschools online. We‚Äôve lot time together great, although excessive baking added pounds. 

But, weakened immune system, worried affect faced back public. Many friends recently gone back hanging out, I‚Äôm one left out. Yes least Kentucky you‚Äôre due hi risk documentation doctor still get UI. Well we‚Äôre starting see consequences protests now...  fucking slavery spices violates ‚Äúmy rights‚Äù! I'm probably going crucified saying idea but, US ever support local farms good excuse eat little healthier save meat Packers lives. 

Avoiding meat little harm. I'm meat lovers would rather stay healthier case come disease. Belgium bars forced close 1 now...

That sure stop virus. already posted Reposts removed Masks help infallible, Florida summers joke. Good luck getting people keep 98 degree Florida summers 80% humidity rainstorms. already issues people balking wearing masks now. People comply, also absolutely horrible employees work wearing day weather. 

As temperature screenings, EVERY SINGLE PERSON would come contact central screener area, either employee guest. putting one temp taker risk plus EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE GUEST CONTACT DAY. Temperature checks also circumvented. Pop couple Tylenol bring fever down, poof! Trip Disney World saved. Never mind smearing germs over. Also, people develop fevers later day screening done? plan testing people way OUT. bad idea around. need postpone reopening. numbers seem saying otherwise üßê accepted exist Lol, didn‚Äôt. Ireland laughable terms ‚Äúreins‚Äù virus. see Lidl full face mask still. Similar NL. Masks mandatory public transport shopping.

Since reopening trend clear: back normal people behaviour. still difficult large gatherings actual limited capacity bars restaurants (30 people max till July).

Numbers really good would surprised stay low, would mean virus contagious exact opposite experts think.

Let's see happen. We‚Äôve learned enough virus know isn‚Äôt lot risk unless old unhealthy begin with. Talking virus like misleading best dishonest agenda worst. 

As far family, quit job really don‚Äôt want it. Yet one quitting won‚Äôt either. Maybe isn‚Äôt don‚Äôt want catch super bad illness, don‚Äôt want work compared staying home. How‚Äôs view Prince Andrew‚Äôs rectum? Right are, Harry! post Sundays. ""Nanoparticles cloaked human lung cell membranes human immune cell membranes attract neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus cell culture, causing virus lose ability hijack host cells reproduce. 

The first data describing new direction fighting COVID-19 published June 17 journal Nano Letters. ""nanosponges"" developed engineers University California San Diego tested researchers Boston University.

Your dad's moron Yeh swallow anything ventilator face.   American lives Canada visits Europe often...people US need to:

* wear masks
* avoid crowds unnecessary gatherings
* willing call people first two
* stop believing/participating psuedo-science social media groups
* get news reading instead watching
* consume less editorial content factual reporting

And that's even touching bigger socio-economic issues. right wrong - people can't afford work, government can't afford give away trillion dollars month make shortfall. Even Trump corrupt cronyist asshole is, would still lead runaway inflation, cure worse disease.

People work. Like not, that's presumption system built on, much wish would change...trying 3 weeks middle pandemic happening. risk simply unavoidable, social safety networks would needed help otherwise. 

But people assholes. kid working counter Starbuck's wearing mask, literally costs nothing return favor. mom handing masks Wal-Mart job; take put on, spare political rant. Etc. frustration primarily focused says volumes you. including 30-40% included official statistics

What mean that? Apparently Canada spends $5k per capita health care. 10k/year family would actually cheap approximately equal US spending per person health care anyways. basically.... I'm already paying 10k/year taxes health spending getting nothing it. 

Also 25% marginal tax seems fine someone making 3x+ minimum wage. cautious prevent catching disease degree. food? Ordering frozen food doorstep? People Chicago half ass everything numbers still down. states seeing spikes filled people trying get sick. people already dead, know it. Continue useless life. politicians kill well. Alright, raining week restrictions removed sunny today, local pub put sign saying opening June 29th, premier league back wish rugby gaelic games would start back sooner August, overall happy out. exponential growth seeing? No... literally means flatten curve, bend curve downwards. whole point qurantining extend virus's length keep cases lower, manageable amount. can't change definition something. *reins Feel free come Netherlands. like living Listen dude. Spain ultra tight lockdown, literally $600 fine outside without reason. streets deserted here. kids never left house 9 weeks, wife once. 

Only left house groceries 9 weeks. Everything sanitized came home. now, little risk here. time start returning sort normal. risk sitting outside, 2m someone else? Yeah, guess so, small justifiable. probably chance car crash here.

I'm sitting home vaccine. wanna that, knock out. Maybe that's best option, necessary currently. becomes again, that's I'll do. close friend girlfriend Vietnamese took advice becoming obvious going pandemic. (In Vietnam pandemics epidemics toast).

Doing might - continues - somewhat inconvenient but, everyone else done same, would far fewer 65,000+ extra dead three months.

Instead, Government, manner half-arsed, unenforced even unenforceable ‚Äúmeasures‚Äù cobbled together sides arrogance (fake) self-confidence.

The good thing come even people girlfriend‚Äôs parents‚Äô constituency (which ‚Äútrue blue‚Äù - Conservative MP since 1885) hammering Government incompetence. seem blind loyalists USA crawling with. Slavery? Slavery? That‚Äôs amazing. 

For us Canada, it‚Äôs almost like sheer proximity USA makes us second hand stupid measures. know anything medicine, me, sounds like important discovery far. Yes lol that's true, generally good understanding viruses infect respiratory system sequelae. preliminary data showing infection confer immunity time points thus far. 

There long term systemic morbidity associated every respiratory infection. Laypeople realize overblowing various symptoms hearing places. Masks required temperature checks guests employees, distancing markers signage, hand washing stations. That‚Äôs Disney springs. parks aren‚Äôt open yet think 7/11. ""protect black"" ""affect blacks""

Not one mention black *people*. realize they're human beings, right?

Keep dog whistles yourself. dgaf effect anything black community. can't even acknowledge humanity. There's system called COBRA essentially pay existing coverage find new job. 

You also buy private insurance linked job all. kinda pricey, unattainbly (like car payment).

It's terrible system living paycheck paycheck working minimum wage type jobs. really something ever worry professional job. could get Trump wear one tell supporters well. That's what's missing here. I'm server subreddits happening lot. What's worse half time employees get it, seems management tries sweep rug avoid closing days deep cleaning notify customers. read post restaurant things ""right"" way, met IRATE customer base pissed restaurant potentially exposing them. personal responsibility seen. talk effectively Italy controlled outbreak success South lower quality medical care seriously impressive live? Delft seen behaviour describing. people keeping much distance possible. 
1) seen groups 3 people grocery shopping (and even groups 3 rare).
2) People queue desinfectant entering store
3) circles, nobody even visited clothing stores. order online go supermarket.

Even city, busy, people try best keep distance others outside household.

In general, there's huge change behaviour since lockdown, I'm expecting potential second wave hit much less first one. Besides, people start hearing second wave, better prepared know do. go carnaval, that's sure... Malaysia boleh! expand upon this:

cc: /u/chaddaddycwizzie schools reopening.  Let guess... two weeks, right? virus spread food? yes many people Missouri believe democratic hoax, flu, even it‚Äôs worse flu things somehow better now. would say view less actual city inner ring suburbs rural areas. I‚Äôm hoping education experience gets visa UK Germany crap goes south US. CA bad shape think though.

lol right, everything fine. big push since started get liability protection companies. started get protections, interest shutting ""to protect workers"" vanished.  flu nasty year California. girlfriend's family Hague laughing us wear masks sounds right üòã really though. main benefit masks prevent infectious people spreading virus coughs. Covering mouth definitely important part. Covering nose adds benefit protecting wearer better others, already marginal benefit best. Yeah that‚Äôs exactly point. 20% US population, 60 million people, live rural areas virus shouldn‚Äôt spread easily, land mass spread cities means they‚Äôre much less dense EU counterparts. example, NYC half dense Paris. Barcelona 4x denser Chicago, Milan nearly twice dense Philly. 

Per capita ignores density. It‚Äôs ignorant leave density talking virus requires people close quarters spread. true. Belgium, cafes open untill 1 believe. people yesterday got kicked 1 every cafe? held fucking party hundreds people centre city ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm southern California, cases I've heard people know, baby boomer parents getting it. go store every one two weeks, always generation mask wearing wrong. get like low-level lead poisoning growing up? Canada? made choice nation prioritize prevention economic disaster maximum life saving.

So data certainly expected ""My immune system good enough."" - White American Trump Rally. hell mention anything protests? dense, mate? incubation period - testing getting results back etc. take 3 4 weeks happen everything shows numbers. 2 4 weeks probably good barometer use. Europe probably less people think kind hoax... hard u.s government get serious months? Masks required actual lockdown place  still do.  Ist country Led Frank Dux? Ouch! definitely nasty virus describe going aroubd CA Dec Jan tons people got I'm pretty sure Covid-19. was, would antibody levels similar New York/London/Lombardy even LA we're nowhere near close.

Flu affect them."" teach class govern state real coordination national government Mother Merkel sit video conferences heads state/state ministers NRW's Laschet Bavaria's S√∂der fight entire time.

Excellent summary Merkel past months! I've long puzzled people refuse accept Germany's political system really federal. example, translating term ""Land Berlin"" ""State Berlin"", I've heard people say ""But they're really states like USA"". Yes are. really states. live Denmark literally one wearing mask... that‚Äôs okay, masks don‚Äôt help much compared social distancing. Stop looking raw numbers

OK, let's look percentage tests coming back positive. testing = less percentage people infected, look that. percentage remained steady month even though testing increased 4x. 

Not good. Fair enough. Small country small population though. island. Well different cultures government borders.

Same US states, ones implementing coronoavirus countermeasures. Curiously, respiratory disease deaths US skyrocketed year. mean American Atheists good go collateral damage? case since April  watching DW News Tulsa rally, simply could believe callous attitude America towards pandemic. read demonstrations refusal use masks. Europe it‚Äôs always biased. spike especially absolute increase foreseeable figures information could get online. Source? almost like idiots protesting wear masks that. least BLM something matters. ""Political posts take conversation much"" - Mods

So. Fucking. What!!! Perhaps read great rise Covid due protests. don‚Äôt recall seeing much social distancing then. Rally goers braver me, one way. US divided

The EU literally comprised different countries speak 24 different languages historically war one large

The EU ~450 million people, compared ~330 anti-scientific

That's large part it.

The one thing I'd add we're way individualistic. idea ""my mask protects you, mask protects me"" rings hollow many Americans, think ""I give fuck protecting inconveniences slightest"". Well like U.S. spent billions billions billions re-building Europe. like U.S. spendng military made Nordic countries to.

If every country goals spendning Nordic countries large bad actor (China, Russia, etc.) could literally sweep Europe within weeks months nobody would anytihng. Like would Sweden realistically China Russia become hostile? They'd hide like child behind U.K. France Germany U.S. existence countries possible *because* behind massive shield funded countries. surprise. personally CoVid could tell 3 days ago, let alone 2 weeks ago. imposed strict lockdown early March lifted May. Even now, range restrictions remain August earliest.

Though, keep mind Ukraine coronavirus tests March either, even 10k per day, [a spike ""pneumonia"" level mortality unfortunately accepted. Flattening curve social distancing mitigate keeping hospitals overloaded. Diseases lead morbidity mortality. That's simple fact novel disease always going result unavoidable amount death. fortunately progressed treatment wise especially there's evidence showing dexa effective. 

I disagree there, strains coronaviruses vaccines developed confer long lasting immunity. inevitable strain different, vaccine guarantee. positive test vast majority people, symptoms bad. Many people even show symptoms. really develop long term immunity Covid-19, might taking vaccine twice year.  wonder people 20s days drive numbers? careless? number children also two parents involved lives 100% framing arguement misleading.  exact opposite claim COVID deniers make? I've told quite co-workers family members hospitals are, nonsensical reason, paid ""code COVID-19"". claim article makes basically opposite: hospitals claiming people actually COVID-19 actually COVID-19, money(?) European living America depressing. C'mon lads! wear masks scared type world people like create. hurt someone else, obviously *should* charged crime. think lawless country, what? 
Reopened day care centers shut several states. Here‚Äôs Alternatively, younger people first get exposed result re-opening. They're front-line workers, waiters, bartenders, enthusiastic patrons restaurants bars. initial ""age"" infected skewed unusually low bit, infections move demographic deeper older population. 17 actually significantly higher previous Sunday tally. looked rise cases deaths states deaths typically came 10-15 days cases rose. would say June 13th started Florida's significant increase cases, deaths start trending later week. 

Today's death count actually lead believe seeing first hints increase. TIL legal, least states. whole industries devoted preying elderly. CHATs system publicly-accessible? Also decreasing cases, less 50 deaths day 7 day rolling average still dropping. 

Polar opposite America. Pulling better pulling out.

Furthermore, fully reopened everything. least Ontario there's restaurant eat inside, large gatherings people inside things like movies concerts/events. know Israel. Swedish Public Health Agency even [advices think strange decision. becoming everyday thing right? showed FOX-addled in-laws claimed could explained US getting different strain Europe got. also think version coronavirus going around right less deadly. something actually said media?  yet despite reopening seen huge spikes, much disdain fear mongers doomers front house today open air baby shower courtyard food balloons. Ah, also 12 adults 6 children without masks form social distancing hand washing. Everyone lived 2 buildings go past party. know anecdotal, personal experience Berlin, lot people give damn baffled number cases still low. Yeah, causation vs correlation. Always issue early research like this. Cheltenham think hugely responsible lot case Ireland. really think heads need roll one. course speaking State country.

I described US situation as, quote here: ""fucking madness"".

There one state Victoria US.  9 million people visit Ireland every year. 

If like it, one them. There's plenty countries miserable in. NY surprisingly good? numbers aren‚Äôt reported? I‚Äôm seeing everyone going beaches group meet ups every day mask fear. Meanwhile literal rest country world reporting insane numbers. this, right here, left nursing homes. bad comment makes seem, *it's worse*. last time worked nursing home mid nineties, still nightmares. That's hyperbole, exaggeration, literal nightmares it. Nightmares wake crying, worse.

That's nursing homes are, nightmare factories. They're filled death, pain, fear. That's good ones. get wrong, worked many skilled, caring, honorable people. fellow CNAs best, nurses. system behind good staff breaks down, like patients. either flee, end jaded burnt out.

I'll beat ever living crap anyone tries put parents one, I'd eat bullet allowing put there. Again, that's hyperbole. would rather die quick, terms face fate. Let's hope best would strange second wave. !RemindMe 29 days Businesses stand chance 50k infections every day. quarantined, know like used diseases killed hundreds thousands people left many hospitalized and/or permanent damage. problem lot people wearing masks correctly. people covering mouth leaving nose exposed like woman NYC likes wear mask underneath chin like necklace. I‚Äôll interested excess mortalities year now. Confirmed deaths easily juked stat. *freedom intensifies* auto updates on. forced update. I'll see pick clue store. Enjoy authoritarian reach.

^\s like sitting ten minutes. wish stronger person is. cry little monolingual :( guess, I'm lucky understand culture friends many different origins.

People understand good USA compared 90% countries world wide isn‚Äôt sport way test people ahead time (before they're infected virus) see immune system likely reaction? would good info have. think going regionally dependent political nature obviously. paraphrase George Carlin, picture stupid average American is, realize half country even stupid that. That's Trump's base. Well boss shit luck. Either abides federally protected leave company gets sued every penny have. I'm glad NM finally something right once. started getting ass whooped governor shut shit down. still anti mask reopen crowd majority seem taking seriously. Hopefully nothing AZ TX open lack restrictions. Reopened Mid May? Nah Fabric masks protect others, n95 masks protect you. 

1 5 what, cases, hospital admissions, icu admissions? Huge distinction depending is. parents make wear helmets.. soft heads. Funny, happy take shipments April Trump ordered must stay open China's benefit. part happens rains hot? People go inside. Even still, 6ft apart rule still applies US pass baton stupidity. would never thought ever.  imagine US start large unmasked protests soon too. pass sidewalks usually 75-85% range wearing mask indoors it‚Äôs like 95%. Hopefully people keep up.

Simply good enough. here. I‚Äôm keeping eye things far seems increase numbers tied increase tests. know testing much accessible KC metro advertising heavily. businesses area confirmed exposures required negative COVID tests employees returning work reopen. 

The lack mask use concerning though. would feel lot better stood masks socially acceptable.  It‚Äôs verbatim title article praying over. didn‚Äôt say said anything. Solely saying article without backup scientific merit point. *""We want grad.""*

Masked every time without fail. got positive test result back yesterday selfish, maskless, mouth-breathers refuse acknowledge GLOBAL FUCKING PANDEMIC. Honestly point trust redditors organizations. They've fumbled incredible amount times leaving us swaths population think masks work r/Masks4All Inflatable pools new toilet paper. Anyone else small children get this. Capatilism evil. Even extreme use ""positive rate tests"" comparison Germany... see tons people wearing masks mouth covering noses...

 


Not sure better none... Macchu Picchu thinks: phew Sorry, can't remember exactly ones. one Taiwan's officials interviewed English media. recent one long interview Audrey Tang gave BBC's Click. Google it. can't guarantee that's got from. read/heard many news/interviews Taiwan lately.

Even source cited, mentions ""cell phones proximity"". know proximity sailors use cell locations? someone reading provide summary article language resembles English, please. Yeah like important shit like this, would paywall it? That‚Äôs suspicion well, trend I‚Äôve noticed still holds Put another way, (correct) metric percentages, since we're dealing exponential growth:

1m 2m = 5.47% average growth per day

2m 3m = 3.4%

3m 4m = 2.4%

4m 5m = 2.0%

5m 6m = 2.0%

6m 7m = 1.7%

7m 8m = 1.8%

8m 9m = 1.6% is, though. know countries bon Earth, right? countries got thing time bad. countries opening back real stopped virus social isolation face masks. 100% long man. Ugh. hungover college graduation hurt! Haha. entered Phase -3. Activate accordingly. Agreed. Black lives fighting exist. entitled kids wanted celebration. comparison. use BLM loophole party, outrageous. tangelo purresident thinks Yeah heard huge gatherings people population centres, people packed tightly together, complaining someones death? Strange times live What‚Äôs difference catching COVID protest catching COVID social gathering. cause righteous doesn‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt irresponsible. think money you‚Äôll save, much longer you‚Äôll live enjoy it, pay butt health insurance portable oxygen tanks - plus won‚Äôt deal jitters. It‚Äôs quadra-win! 

It‚Äôs also kind me, haven‚Äôt smoked weed much since January, except friend comes while. Sure helped stretch savings haha. read somewhere one Trump organizers rally handing masks even wearing one himself... makes wearing mask political issue.

America, half guys pretty fucking stupid. Deaths time low covid. basically strong cold Hi close is. here. visiting back home every 2 weeks like clockwork. Silver bullet suppose. source this? need 2 month long country-wide lockdown severe rules afterwards too. Nazi meat plants. That's honestly best way put feel this. got lucky fuck got green card here, that's I'll never hate Bill Clinton one main reasons family got Oh great, devolved insulting mental capabilities. endeavor ""try see someone else's point view,"" someone else's point view conflict science hard data. unfortunately, math math, math can't lie, unlike people. limited testing, people supposed prove made withdrawal due coronavirus? used never get sick one fall/winter bad cold symptoms would never go away.... thought maybe allergic something, turned severe Vit deficiency. got put high dose couple months amazing difference made. probably similar U.S. - ny got rekt first spots (Arizona/Florida etc) getting chance glory plan taking precautions hopefully catch there's vaccine (and available, whole different story) effective treatment.

Full isolation feasible course, basic precautions reduce risk perfectly doable, right policies put place would much much effective. true... italy law requires masks open air 1 meter social distancing respected. apply people living together (they assumed ""close contacts"" anyhow).

Masks mandatory public transportation closed spaces exception bars restaurants (only customers table).

These rules effect since may 18th, almost businesses reopened lockdown actually lifted (except movements regions allowed starting june 3rd).

In general see people 30 masks needed whenever enter shop line walking usually wear properly. might something masks uncomfortable breathing 90F. hand people 30 usually wear masks even there's none around. Well .. one personally throwing oceans. throw trash ... ends way.

It using .. personally throw them. pretty much relevant plastic end somewhere. Respiratory system. Super unlikely get tainted produce. people complying point going change behaviors anything less direct personal tragedy. one safest places country. 200, Montana 717 cases. already protecting curbside, fuck everyone else protect YOU

what do? accept things cannot changed, change power so, realize difference two things. live Oregon coast. weeks ago ghost town. tourists back big way see masks. large

I wish guys would stop using excuse. got nothing COVID does, actually help you. dark ages. Telephones exist. People get infected can't get news. get infected lazy protecting themself community. Now, maybe would also lazy work 50hr weeks shite pay. also consistently vote neo-liberals.

tl;dr: large landmass mean shit. Ya'll lazy fucks, that's issue. mad? Lol RN responsible dozens patients. wants work kind caseload? Small percentage? spring breakers, churchgoers, anti mask protesters... adds up, exponentially. I‚Äôm guessing majority Floyd protesters taking virus seriously, protests important enough take risk, took additional precautions afterwards. Sweden didn‚Äôt lockdown... Incorrect. throat/nose test looks specific RNA virus. I‚Äôm confused. not?  guess Americans insufferably stupid all. think might want reread comment, highlighting relatively poor performance USA social mobility. I‚Äôm saying politicians great. don‚Äôt get blind praise NY politicians effectively failed containing virus.

Sure, would worse didn‚Äôt take measures did, seriously think fact virus probably spread New Yorkers nothing current downward trend? Agree 100%.

Disney reopening nightmare making. wow ever recover stinging comment... I'm sorry retarded. Easier said done. get food, water? can't let people raid stores prepare that. Maybe need urgently see doctor. do? people need every single day able live next one. wealthier population impossible, poorer? Also, people unable wear mask indoors believe everyone would stay inside 3 whole weeks? Plus late, everyone wants go back normality another major lockdown (am talking Europe) would unreasonable. don‚Äôt live us. sister corona i‚Äôm extra careful I'd still play safe. I'm Southern California still real threat yet lot people treating like big deal--even mocking people taking seriously. kind scary. can't wait done crazies. Oregon, bars closed midnight.

As second meat factory Germany big coronavirus outbreak, working conditions meat factories finally got lot public attention. surprise future meat factories forced employ workers directly. intermediaries allowed anymore. put workers better negotation position, though working meat factory likely never nice job lower working caste. lockdown started easing back may nearly 2 months past dramatic increases. Social distancing, people working home proving enough keep virus suppressed, add better weather encouraging people meet outdoors etc. vaccine now. exists Apple phones, too, least you‚Äôve connected phone car‚Äôs Bluetooth (I think - please correct I‚Äôm wrong!).

Pew pew pew I‚Äôd say major cities, 50% (indoors) 20% outdoors sidewalks. 

It‚Äôs mandatory public transit grocery stores, government level, individual businesses get decide thus trouble enforcing it. 

The real issue people ‚ÄòAmerican republican type mask pride Toronto, makes sense I‚Äôm sure comes from. guess gave us much bad info masks early, ‚Äòmasks bad‚Äô ingrained mind stupid. there‚Äôs lot stupid people testing deaths per capita. Mask wearing endemic Asian culture. seem problems. 

I'd say people complaining nitwits, they're straight pussies. would gain huge chunk benefits checking interstates 

If assume population hostile need 100% crazy hard. assume population OK unduly bothered even 80% huge help? 

Whole different scenario know everybody‚Äôs different, test isn‚Äôt bad quickly. feels like water nose, stinging, kind weird. us hell lot people effect numbers Wisconsin state Supreme Court struck governor's order close businesses stay inside. ranks number 30 50 states terms deaths per capita. 

**Wisconsin stores, bars, restaurants open since mid-May.**

Wisconsin COVID death rate 12 per 100,000 population. New York, highest COVID death rate, death rate 149 per 100,000 population. deaths New York metropolitan 


Half COVID deaths occurred three states, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts.

The current estimate CDC mortality rate COVID-19 virus [between .25% orders magnitude early predictions possibly 6% mortality rate.

Wisconsin follows Swedish model, media strives portray failure comparing Swedish death rate Denmark, Finland, Norway, imposed strict lockdowns. European countries strict lockdowns deaths per capita Sweden, Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium, recently, France. I‚Äôm immunosuppressed I‚Äôve home 3 months now. live myself. go grocery store week. haven‚Äôt in-person face-to-face real conversation since mid-March. idiots need stop fucking everyone else. trampolines. Amazing. break economy, unforeseen repercussions. Go figure. waiver mean it'll hold court.

However, current administration, surprise find way get around it. think though accurately show well country dealt cases, course easier covid spread america definitely skews results lot. mean transmission one person next 70x faster US, 70 infected people US every infected person Ireland

What meant 700 cases per million ireland america would 70x cases america. Saying countries dealt equally well true true must 70x harder spread ireland america. Per million great seeing likely citizen get making assumption dealing virus cases per million higher accurate know people belong risk group right? Austria, lifted restrictions wear indoors like shops. borders reopened! would remove mask wearing time?? Would great. Except officials told us universally 2 months ago ""mASKs dOnT wOrK""

Their credibility shot. Hello, northern neighbour Canada here. suppressed too. Research shows almost cases BC came Europe US, Asia. overload health system... understand virus stop spreading form immunity achieved, right? UK citizen living US last 20 years. I‚Äôd leave I‚Äôm sure jobs could get American law degree Yes Taiwanese govt send sms messages based proximity, there‚Äôs indication contact tracers used data actual contact tracing. tried verify claim contact tracer able access location history confirmed patients internet, couldn‚Äôt find anything. 

IMHO, think edit comment (if claim unsubstantiated). paints Taiwan authoritarian reality Taiwan achieved possible anywhere world, including ‚ÄúWest,‚Äù good governance. narrative serves Orientalistic views Taiwanese citizens care privacy allows state intrude lives. There‚Äôs really good [Wired this. two cents. lived Germany 6 years would say it‚Äôs well taken care infrastructure is, organized/timely public services are, high social floor is. 

Having lived US 20 years, differences palpable. There‚Äôs underlying tension US always seems exist. Germany doesn‚Äôt foster mindset That‚Äôs February Due working medical field know colleagues tested positive covid-19.
Sadly two tested antibodies weeks later, one low count, antibodies ever.

Haven't found statistics regarding immunity far, sometimes wonder herd immunity table covid-19 stay.  joke. say hurt feelings? quoted stats sure remove post doesn‚Äôt meet narrative. Sad group can‚Äôt debate facts stats anymore. Absolutely nothing bad news this. However, vaccine still prove efficacy safety Phase III, far biggest hurdle. crucifiction. I‚Äôve cut way back, go way

Suppressed strong adjective, we're mess yet. Netherlands way spread outbreak damage. week ago surprised much countryside often driving long get next village. Cant compare germany everything way dense. Gators nothing us horrified see happening US. almost people want see virus expand kill more. actions many pretty much guarantee going happen. Leadership conceals data, people cannot get good information, sorts mixed messaging, simply bananas. Since 70‚Äôs started. Wow.

If get texts political campaigns asking donations sports teams asking buy season tickets, there‚Äôs reason contact tracer shouldn‚Äôt able text me. 

I think wrinkle probably tied federal regulation makes texting cell phones without prior consent illegal (and thus expensive fines levied), could fixed competent government. 

Either federal government could carve exception state governments could find way get people opt texts local health departments specific purpose. also give health care workers time resources actually treat fall ill. we're recession, there's way anyone going invest money needed rebuild energy infrastructure. They'll continue rely fossil fuels infrastructure already there. local one offers ""Anti-viral IV"". countries back normal? Back pre-pandemic normalcy? started back work last week. Started feeling sick weekend. Got tested today. nervous. Europe would improve massively mandatory English lessons age 10. Trade would easier, tourism would easier. supplements herbs inhibit alpha defensin deaths even account way higher number seriously ill need rehabilitation many never fully recover. 

It also account massive damage scenario would healthcare, mountain delayed surgeries treatment fractured work force somehow catch to. impossible without major healthcare spending reform. crisis over, many healthcare workers take sick leave resign, especially get little recovery time summer. Well ppl attended rally won‚Äôt get tested, consider hoax watered flu. know start causing collateral damage, fucking euphemism century. American, simultaneously worrying comforting us dumb.

We're still pretty dumb though. seems huge, long actually deployed? article mentioned studies rats, imagine least several months still. Nonetheless, looks promising indeed! think I'd rather listen ""The who"" band rather WHO. record, dislike band. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ mean people insane drive save face would never ever fudge numbers save face? country? Maybe China afraid test people. grandmother German govt took father‚Äôs medical license. That's right! lot people making stupid decisions. protect yourself.

I‚Äôm 100 days quarantine prospect 3-6 months feels soul crushing. B E C U N R N H E W R L tell store right testing positive though! Growth linear exponent 1 still break records. think rest Europe needs ban English, get act together. still Covid 19 hotspot. couple thousand luckily vocal minority, unfortunately dangerous Well yes actually no. Europe surge new cases people assholes can't keep minimum 2 meters open even wear masks. staff always damage control says dumb shit. (This damage control didn‚Äôt take place event btw.) goal always explain away ANYTHING makes look bad. 

Otherwise agree you‚Äôve said. president... middle... people yelling projecting droplets everywhere. guess stop apologizing America's stupidity now. Might cheaper send holiday ever Bolsanaro lives. He‚Äôll appreciate influx economy, they‚Äôll happier find leader thinks like them. 

They stay long term too. Less burden health care system too. true. Maybe village street live in, city public transport, lot masks. lived Us life well Netherlands Germany, say reason people two countries would never migrate US. It‚Äôs like night day qualify life loudest voices typically loudest, I'm starting get impression silent majority America quietly handling better they've let on. Deaths still falling might mean cases seem rising better testing. Apparently Trump's Tulsa rally pull great numbers starting look like protests never big media wants be. Mask usage great, maybe people staying home now? might getting small, reckless cross-section full picture look group people spend lot time outside. Maybe us seeing bullshit seems. Guessing guys, get fat birds? Murder freedom. inconvenience holocaust. Come Alaska. little mask wearing really social distancing. Folks large gatherings half hundred people watched COVID. Plague released world one breath 15 minute nose sniffle next.  extended family surprise birthday party 78 year-old grandfather **next weekend**.

Fucking idiots, lot them. think doesnt exist America coronavirus? Like brainwashed. gain it? Money views. America much worse.  Everywhere since pandemic broke out, doctors said patients presenting classic covid symptoms come in: fever, cough, anosmia, shortness breath, maybe diarrhea. 

Right, interesting initial diagnosis appendicitis - implies diarrhea type cramping, different cramping bowel inflammation. Screaming directly face gets aerosols going Start second DW... wear mask, free spit face! dare you. headline sounds like title Sesame Street song. SHOWWW $$ would‚Äôve thought average Trump supporter would succumb Coronavirus higher rate supporters groups.

Aren‚Äôt Trump loving states significantly poorer, fatter uneducated left states? That's happens vote based religion rather policies Mostly brother sister transmission guessing. WTF saying. Population 10M

5K dead . 2500+ Nursing homes. 

Their economy untouched. They're far away closer herd immunity. get vaccine way quicker US. 1 loss life much, understand ""Sweden"" failed posts. really can't see logic? 

the US failed.  failing. Obviously 10M people, could never Sweden did. Legal weed road work, right? Trump order Feds in... Alaska beginning find out. you? one making claim rare. research done families, take look Table 3 would guess risk somewhere ""close contact"" ""household"". long spend long periods room ok. must shared rooms together, try keep distance open windows possible.

Acute GI symptoms - anything cramping, acute focal pain. 

One good reason proper contract tracing, know risks probabilities. weak Benjamin Franklin? steal someone else? going say this. shop live A2, pretty much everyone wearing masks. I‚Äôve noticed people openly staring, Meijer go to, people aren‚Äôt wearing masks. Amazing anecdotal experience. pointless objection made. American's response Covid-19 epitome getting participation award. get pat back worst possible job still get recognition. SMH Journalism died decade ago dispute risk rally is, also hate much bigger deal protest, yeah, pick people media believe mask people do. Afraid that's wurst. Someone actually told ""they're one brace ones"". Really? spreading like wildfire here. failed adapt ultimatly got eradicated due it.

Thats point. Either adapts proliferates dies. covid continue endemically either reduce severity clinical significance culled gene pool.

This gradual process doesnt defined point happens. NASCAR zero fans since returned plans bring back really great article! Orange County: Welcome club! I'll take 600 expected much. world pretty screwed right now. Wouldn‚Äôt make sense say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think masks help, could well wrong it‚Äôs really minor inconvenience. ‚Äò latest IDEXX partnership increasing Maine‚Äôs testing capacity 4x, it‚Äôs one states CDC considers appropriate testing volume population. state needs focus improving contact tracing staff, it‚Äôs largely ahead states‚Äô ability test virus.

Jokes aside, even successful phase 1 trials disappointing phases.  problem American Federal government stopped interstate travel, American States stopped local travel. Asymptomatic / paucisymtomatic infected people leave outbreak areas, bring disease them. That's China, India places stop travel locked down. means get tested may positive, since know, go work church elderly relatives.

And risk infecting unknowingly killing someone, possibly good friend relative maybe complete stranger.

The reason real numbers might hurt reputation bad optics charted?

Just thought lives mean little leadership makes nauseated disgust.

Judging see here, need get #dropthecurve trending way #flattenthecurve beginning. Make sound cool stop transmitting. I'm centre county 200 found cases despite higher population count given penn state. compliance I'm noticing. couple charts track total well daily hospitalizations age group:

 Yes correct. 

I paid Medicare since inception. Yes, old working life began 13 (before inception Medicare) continued past 71. 

I forced using Medicare 65 insurance contnue covering age didn't. 

BUT continue Medicare payments long continued working also pay supplement insurance time. 

Nearing 80, still pay supplement health insurance supplement drug insurance. 

I resent told benefits welfare paid family paid decades died reaching medicare age. 

I resent told I'm drain economy.

 resent people never paid pay nothing supplements now, yet crying benefits worked life get.

If monry handled properly instead allocated political gain given right it, would funds paid in. Nice AZ least, new hospitalizations decline while, possible peak around June 1. scientist though field conjecture, seems Arizona never really first peak first place terms cases (so second peak), though hospitalizations deaths seem peaked decline. Deaths peaked much earlier June 1. Guess we'll see weeks, trends data there. Florida first wave right now. small wave, plateaued, seeing large spike like northeastern states saw back april. delayed first wave. think Toronto's ""mandatory"" system decent, masks required, someone enter without mask, policy give mask instead asking leave deny service. helps minimize conflict since people wear masks peer pressure usually enough diehard cases. Obviously strategy would work less well areas mask compliance low. Please correct I'm wrong, based everything I've read seems drugs suppress bodies natural reactions fighting infections triggering severe auto immune response seems working.

Dexamethasone based sounds Alpha Defensin mechanism body triggers fighting something foreign, key suppress body going overdrive trying fight it, seems allow virus create issues.

Is correct? Michigan. terrible, I've visited hundreds paramedic last 15 years. horrific. pay nursing homes take care family members, pay quietly kill grandparents watch. 

Folks use take care elderly family members, hence mother law suites. generation ago folks real, personal encounters aging death manner. 

Now, elderly viewed inconvenient placed amounts human factory farms concentration camps. staff care replaced foreign nurses barely speak patients absolutely care one bit. staff that's duty visiting hours way reflects staff night. Night staff nursing homes absolutely care all, basically unofficial policy 'drug ignore' patients.  

An ems call nursing home always results in:

 ""its patient"" 
""I got here"" 
""Their nurse break, know called you."" 
""I'm new.""
Or ""they fine 5 minutes ago"" 

There serious agency report violations to, agencies owned nursing homes protect nursing homes. Imagine suggestion box shreds burns everything placed inside. file, lost. make many complaints call company get banned premises. follow complaint lawyer call allegations harrassment. Residents often silenced, quiet desperation rewarded narcotics, emotional desert downward slide lonely death nursing home results in. 

Classical aging America results following, specifically designed drain every single drop money have. 

You move 55+ community things great, like expensive social club anything else. lasts 15-20 years major injury illness. 

This things get slowly shitty, like frog pot stove folks usually notice bad late. 

Now move assisted living, allowed personal belongings compared lifetime stuff had. Maybe 5% belongings. get small apartment, nurse two visit 20 minutes day make sure still breathing. There's cleaning crew, meals provided. like Martha Stewart version prison. bus takes store 1 hour 1 time week, oh there's bingo. someone checking like library book get leave premises. charged everything possible time, absolute trap ever open charge account food drinks activities. Like cruise ship hold hostage. get depressed, health declines. 1 5 years moved elderly home. 

At elderly home amounts hotel room, get bring 15% belongings assisted living facility. Maybe favorite blanket two, 5-7 outfits clothes, personal pictures. start suggest family need cellphone tablet computer things provided recreational area. Theres bingo, movie night places serve alcoholic beverages. Trips go shopping month accompanied tech *(think lower cna, basically $9/hour scrub wearer training)* pushes around. get go trips wheelchair get leave wheelchair. world becomes like zoo million times. methodically carefully disassociated society. control compliance. lasts 1-5 years funds run family gets smart starts moving assets name. 

Now moved nursing home. One depressing, scary, dirtiest places America. Nursing homes use way find good one small town still try. follow guidelines, writing guidelines years ago literally sought input facilities house take care lots needy people... prisons. literally used basically guidelines department corrections setting standards living. nursing home get bath week.
Your calorie intake controlled. 
You drugged complain. 
If complain much ignore get sick. Usually UTI first. use reason label bed confined ignore days time. 
If family still involved point, annoying family worse treated. remain either B happens. 
 A) die preventable disease process, medical malpractice, medication issue (to much/too little).
B) run completely money.

In B) moved Medicare/Medicaid facility. would extremely difficult describe unimaginably horrific places are, basically slow conveyor belt casket. Rape uncommon, medication theft norm, neglect standard. Bathing becomes monthly event lucky. Disease rampant, suck money state die. 

That's aging America nutshell. I'm making up, I'm particularly jaded family member go this. I'm simply paramedic dealing nursing homes daily basis across America last 15 years. rest US waking going elderly population thanks covid19. good thing pandemic light shining aging America. hurts think I'm unhappier I've ever 50 years. Especially since I'm far 50 years old yet. expression- means started taking seriously Prime example irony. enslave animals also enslave impoverished means compunction.

Please tell unemployment system problems fantasy adventure. fair wearing mask still doesnt really lower risk getting it. lowers chance spreading others. fact almost certain survive contract means they'll probably fine. course still want wear one protect others, likely wont see negative consequence selves. state come fall guidelines one them. teacher staff lounge also closed, classes keep groupings much possible reduce excess mingling, staff wear masks, kids tolerate (ie, preschoolers kids special ed serious sensory issues). word yet whether staggered schedules hybrid systems, I'm guessing likely. honestly shit fuckin horrible. haven‚Äôt close family really long time that‚Äôs cool. pulled ol N64 played brother like back good ol days Put travel restrictions us muricans try visit countries? gonna fly bud, muh constitution muh rights! /s Next door Dallas county, home Fort Worth Arlington. Meh. choice made. It‚Äôs also big Taiwan, OP wrong, Taiwan didn‚Äôt that. feel like numbers getting lower due earlier measures making people think okay whatever want. people seem think ADA disappeared Covid hit. CDC guidelines put place allow NHs discriminate anyone covid. Issue people getting calls running homes understand would take care patients allowed disease run rampant It‚Äôs blocked. someone post contents? hard pinpoint one determines source actual increase, I'm trying get people insisting thousands people close everyday hours barely effect cases. best part people also criticize people going beach parks. south never even first spike, seeing first spike now. NY, PA saw another spike, would 100% second wave. 

Right arent seeing rise even reopening past month. ran money recent offering lol I‚Äôm Sorry, clear north end Boston GOOD example this. importantly, denser population areas countries compared US. US settled long Europe afterall. Taiwan doesn‚Äôt contact tracing tracking cell phone locations. blasted SMS messages proximity, one access individual numbers. Contact tracing still relies traditional, non-digitally-pervasive interviews. Don‚Äôt know got information from, it‚Äôs wrong. suspect people cover mouth mouth-breathers. remember, Burlington's amazing views west courtesy state's mountains./s 

To fair, get pretty nice views Greens side lake. guys get gawk Marcy, Haystack, Giant, etc. get glimpses Mansfield Camel's Hump.

It‚Äôs amazing little you‚Äôll see death rates mentioned media. want talk cases. Another secondary? Thank you, captain obvious. Why? doesn‚Äôt take majority people 3 months die. Look worldometers: there‚Äôs steady drop deaths past 3 months despite massive upswings cases. give uneducated armchair expert opinion would say grievously weak people hardest hit states already died we‚Äôre seeing healthy among us getting sick living well increased measures protect oldest weakest still standing.

Good luck life friend u need alot watched many hours live streams protests saw shitload people without masks.  Everyone preoccupied masks. Social distancing matters. see lot photos people wearing masks hugging other. Dumbfucks. Waves Canada. We're I'm glad borders still closed... now. thought talking Italy? deaths per capita US middle road better much Europe. course could better. view we‚Äôve handled significantly influenced reddit important metrics.
Per capita relevant statistic, total cases means little. majority people taking virus seriously. We‚Äôre country 330,000,000 people. course there‚Äôs videos upon videos people idiots, course could significantly better, it‚Äôs hell hole reddit depicts Anybody read whole article? treatment? Bullshit. whole hype based study France showed astronomical recovery rate. Read lot like honest Im fairly sure actually data bigger sample size. anyone say ‚Äúnursing home slaughter‚Äù presented facts back down. EOs northeast based CDC guidelines basically said Nursing Homes tell hospital couldn‚Äôt care patient bring back.  link helps. NJ NY well lot states deaths per capita NHs. 

I‚Äôm NY resident hate people try blame Cuomo governor northeast NH deaths. Fuck Dole. I‚Äôm boycotting businesses choose profits health employees. surprised. drove Lake Oswego days ago shocked. Everyone drinking Patios sidewalk. social distancing, masks, long haul. It‚Äôs like virus suddenly disappeared. Well, sounds right. beginning pandemic people wore mask. would mask gloces, would notice people treating differently - cautious. less cautious towards people act nothing up.

Anyways, Finland havn't even recomendation general population mask usage. logic is, general population uses masks, enough actually need healrhcare elderly.

In emphasis social distancing.
Despite restaurants close take-away only, schools distace leaning, never actually closed shops. Wanna go shopping Ikea? Go head, remember keeping safety distance wear glowes.

This actually worked significantly well.
Now bars open untill 23:00. We'll see restriction lifted. ride train, bus, go Schiphol, go shopping Asian stores, guess? LOL. America people left Europe.

Its also protests...

But everybody acts like thats thing.

But tbh, protesting way worse wearing mask.

I've damn tired sore. 

I antibody test done yesterday, doc really resistant told can't take mental wear anymore. Either I'm new low depression wise covid lasting much longer ever thought possible want know info test could possible provide that. doc told prepared either scenario, said positive doesnt mean I'm clear future scenarios negative mean might make feel worse mental health. took week think went Friday felt another ""wave"" coming on. feel like I'm disintegrating. walk stairs sweat heart races, muscle cramp twitch like ran miles. I'm grateful live California, actually common sense majority population actually educated reject scientific research. lot tantrum stamina, muscley baby!

Don't worry, kindness heart. know generation doomed without help. Im youüòò saw article says cruise ships refusing visit US least mid Sept massive lack containment. would suspect longer testing deathly ill. Many governors urging protestors get tested, young, healthy people testing positive.

Also, nursing homes better lockdown procedures. requiring nursing homes take Covid patients in.

I would also suspect treatment generally gotten better, I‚Äôve heard ventilators used absolute last resort, since often harm good. 

I‚Äôm expert take say grain salt I‚Äôve gathered several articles. protests took place couple weeks ago correct, 20,000 covid-19, much higher that.

Those confirmed cases, real cases probably several times higher (we know soon, serology survey already begun). yet. fair new cases deaths seem increasing since mid April.

I'm sorry. seen protest pictures? social distancing ton wearing masks. stupid argument. People complain credibility loss change stance. totally get it. CDC hiding? keep changing minds? lying us simply incompetent? Regardless, either scenarios means probably listen CDC.

But people get. Remember called novel coronavirus. means started, KNEW nothing it. guessed things it, assumed things it, KNOWING word used describe something slighly less ABSOLUTE. KNOW evolution exists Mendel's fly experiments, THINK human evolution exists would evolution exist one species others. course, fossil records.

With said, virus new getting new information go. thing using information find truth windy, linear straight forward. may information X makes take position P1. introduced information Y, may change position P2. position change back P1 get information Z next. large part happening here.

CDC governing bodies also need conservative say. Pandemics cause mass panic one form another. likely withheld information certain enough first.

So go oh everything say true decrease credibility. Let's treat properly said mind. likely best source information. infallible. new ground touched. going rocky ride. information certainly reliable yours. talking man? literally recommend general public. thing Brazi, extent Sweeden. think two ""sides"" consist two sides see people hiding homes past several months, nervously venturing groceries periodically, people never stopped working jobs.

I saw another post someone speculated number staffers per attendee scaled 6 infected staffers 120 attendees. me, seems high I'd expect staffers higher prevalence gen pop. 

Anyone else wanna take try? know unfalsifiable, fun math. genuinely one scariest things virus criminally underreported issue pandemic. One reasons people taking seriously see estimated (extrapolated) mortality rates 1% high recovery rates.

""Recovered"" mean end things affected. ""Recovered"" means ""tested negative"". That's literally it, terribly, deceptively misleading. People need shown bad survive. Surviving barely matters surviving, can't get bed, quality life shitter. media needs focusing on, constantly. watching rerun? I'm outside Pittsburgh also.

THIS FUCKING FLASHING WARNING. IT. **LITERALLY** KILLING PEOPLE. live California. One Facebook friends said refuses wear mask hopes many Californians same. also said separate post glad see lots people wearing mask today. can‚Äôt believe sheer ignorance. make sense.

This comment otherwise seems like discouraging testing. Deaths consistently month US. new cases asymptomatic mild.

Love you‚Äôre picking 0.0001 percent cases lol One aspect wrong people involved testing. federal government CDC fully ignored pandemic entirety 2020 except two weeks March. States CDCs (hopefully CDCs now) testing, people. *Okay! Hopping back Florida luckily still cheerleading costume yesterday*

GoooooooOOOOOOOO Texas!!!

See ya tomorrow!! Aspire mediocrity. reach always exceed grasp. Nationwide assume? Texas 9% now... Sharknados common time year. Hopefully test kits couldn‚Äôt infected anyone example, colonizers  smallpox-infected blankets sick wards native populations  systematic effort eradicate them.

They horrible. question here. 

The question is, colonizers' civilizations way advanced native populations? happened way smallpox blankets. Get test done. Everyone needs test. matter it, thought it, think it? Get test done KNOW! can't emphasize enough. states never locked down, many opened month two months. Deaths trending worldwide America month. European strain far infectious one. would less wasteful. Instead getting positive result 1 would 5 test get positives result ever test. people state... Ugh... No, better yet hit hurts. $$$ budget. listen state guess priority county budget comes out.

Many call virus, is. Many call flu. difference. think 19 20 versions name."" Misleading headline. OP's fault headline trying imply there's something new infected patients. nothing different Florida's patients. 

Everywhere since pandemic broke out, doctors said patients presenting classic covid symptoms come in: fever, cough, anosmia, shortness breath, maybe diarrhea. That's typical Covid admit. Nursing home, recent vacation, essential worker, etc.

But there's also regular patients. Someone comes car accident, CT? Covid+. 19yo man comes cough, fever, chest pain, CT. Covid+. man's grandfather comes abdominal pain diarrhea, *no cough fever.* Send GI observation. 2 days later develops fever cough! Boom. Covid+. 35 staff GI quarantine 14 days use isolation protocols department someone diarrhea abdominal pain, *no cough fever.* 

This going on, story everywhere months. I'm Chicago stories come from. get click spend time site, good them, got ad impressions. story interesting new ""new kind patient.""

I believe state health departments reporting demographic info snapshots current situation/cumulative cases, seen much allowing comparisons cases age/demo across time. deaths continue rate (20% every three weeks), we'll hit 225k Sept.

Carry on. Good info thanks intel. believe enough, it‚Äôs lot pressure remember best end day. It‚Äôs us do. Im 100% you, differ one ""harms"" another. Obviously, quite people infected others gone infect ever people. certainly people knew sick chose go out, even stayed self quarantined likely passed onset symptoms. highly doubt anyone wanted sicken anyone else...but did. 

I got flu season... im pretty sure got still blame myself. came contact me, still decided shake hands talk guy winter holidays. dont think guy intention getting anyone else sick, did. Thx looked half full, best. plans address overflow crowd scrapped.

I honestly think bunch people requested tickets troll him, intention showing up. snack hungry baby Long Island everyone seems diligent mask wearing. become norm truly believe saved many lives. hope California takes seriously well. Also circulating 8 months, 2.

Oh, ok, 8 month evolution. saying coronavirus evolved changed, clearly 8 months ago.  clearly 4 months ago. evolutionary change occur,  previous version  coronavirus go away?  We're fun flu season. slowly hard tell. lost ability taste jaw broken 16 years ago nerve severed lucky things started work learn taste again.

Unless there's vaccine soon something first. confine 100% undetermined amount time. 

Not advocating go like nothing wrong, many understand. studies showing public mask use works?

Because there's disease severe enough warrant masks, people also alter behavior. difficult separate two.

But wealth evidence controlled experiments include animals masks reduce transmission 1918.

Yes, yes have. idiots sabotaging public health measures. revisionist history see? plan, time, stop growth novel disease. course idea get decreasing rates infection downward trend. Flatten curve easy say slogan. know that? Asymptomatic dont get tested dont know right?

I'm still amazed got it. wonder staff family staff prison spreading here. Mom Dad getting tested Monday. got tested last Tuesday. looks good big 3 ( gm Chrysler) pay offs make money seek. Huge economy boost car companies stay open. Trust know work them. yep they're calling covid-induced chronic fatigue syndrome. Schei√üe! Trump‚Äôs gonna lose guy! Lol Henderson said. Nobody's saying want kick door lick face. want believe get things back resign society everyone stuck home next three years. Let's least try. Yup many conservatives losing minds. least country, numbers using correct. past week we've 0 1 new cases, max today 6 also said one US needed denied ventilator. NYC! sneak odd times work yard lest neighbours try walk touch me. years stayed least six feet away weird. Now, sudden hug patrol. Human tribalism insane.  rate going now, probably not.  last week, added 4,204 dead (from 6/13 today).  ""Only.""  Yeah - that's LOT dead people.  peak, records, week 4/18 4/25, added 16,591 dead.  number dead per week steadily declining since then, every week less previous.  trend continues, even lose 4000 next week.  

Bottom line, assume 4,000 dead mid September, gets us 170k.  

I know reasons numbers dead declining much.  case numbers fluctuate good bit, clearly going (this last week actually pretty bad).  death numbers going way down.  mask wearing?  people outdoors more?  better treatments save lives?  know. 1. possible. Hell! law would deter people.   

2. want overly police people.   

3. Let guess? You‚Äôve never heard varied nuanced opinion before. I‚Äôm much favor mask usage indoors. Outdoors pointless.   

4. News flash. hospitals overwhelmed right now. reason lock anything threat it.   

5. We‚Äôve multiple months now. time move forward now! many people think end testing positive coronavirus Trump's rally Tulsa? someone knows COVID walks around infecting people infected people die, murder? rally 8? Organisers tested positive? Mask higher, glasses lower.    ""People keep talking second wave. We're still first wave."" - Dr Anthony Fauci No. Read comment. search sources, really happening. mean epicenter coronavirus?

California actually took seriously much lower impact NYC wtf? whole pandemic rural places proven place though. virus issues taking root sparsely populated, naturally distanced places.

The cities much harder hit overall. governor made plenty clear we're shutting again. made bed, we'll sleep it. elected officials using religion guide policy choices.

It's pandering idiots sociopaths. state reopened early can't walk around nude?

Aren't freedoms impinged upon?

How let injustice stand!? think many reasons that, mostly function testing everybody beginning. real peaks cases back March April would probably looked much different would able test everybody instead strict criteria could get test also tests widely available. 

We gained knowledge treating Corona, don‚Äôt think prognosis substantially different months ago. even cases surging amongst young now... cases eventually make way age groups. It‚Äôs really hard insulate old people.  I'm surprised one mentioned Darwin Award regard event. Great. wife Michigan (lifelong resident) everyone knows (including family) hates her. Thus, source information. Frankly, I'm happy well loved...but recall? happened almost nothing known virus, wich means treat like worst disease ever cause never know. remember feel good videos news people showing love healthcare workers? think meant cared I'm sure yet known. indications better You‚Äôre annoying I'm seriously tired defense people use really piss someone something serious try walk back. learning disability need inperson environment learn, plus many others majors require person learning via labs went watched clip comment right. read without tone inflection could joke. certainly wasn‚Äôt though. followed giving example testing ten year old boy ‚Äúsniffles‚Äù. gets tested it‚Äôs another case. much sincere bothers due much testing. Sometimes genius almost frightening- Donald Trump surge comes rally riots? alright sure lot people laughing joke! ‚ÄúTell Gorbachov build wall ten feet higher!‚Äù think WF compliance? South Korean supermarkets live US places hospital clean. 

Everyone gets clean set gloves door, questions excuses. Product touched ungloved dirty glove hands, though main vector IMO. They‚Äôre telling half truths. Yes it‚Äôs transmission rates go 1:1 hospitals don‚Äôt get overwhelmed. slowly reopen adequate testing contact tracing long transmissions rates remain 1:1 okay sure getting numbers, India around 400k confirmed cases, suppressed numbers. 12k closer number recorded deaths. Source: Indian living India. recently discovered anti-inflammatory cut death rates 30%. postponing already cut death rate significantly. Also, hospitals better prepared many emergency workers immune now. Flattening curve working saving countless lives, every week get better techniques better prepared.

Is worth economic cost? That's lot debatable. personally think richest country world live paycheck paycheck able easily overcome months off, especially almost every country (i.e. competitors) thing. again, part question two sides. flattening curve question not, save significant lives. guess White House said joking. never understood meant-the White House said. Vatican. buildings can't talk. shorthand reporters comment can't officially claim person said wrote? inauthentic posting really getting desperate, especially new throwaways testing capacity higher NY time, likely would posting 20k new cases per day. peaked 6k testing symptomatic cases. It'll take lot texas level shit hitting fan. Hopefully turn things around though trending direction. Yeah, maybe he'll stop crazy tweets...

...after all, quite *pissed.*

;) crazy is, probably one scientifically accurate statements ever made. Haha 120k dead (most likely double considering ""suspect"" 10-fold increase pneumonia whatever) haha funny lmao someone gets corona gets ill instead meaning body susceptible virus could also mean stronger strain(if makes sense) virus? also I‚Äôve kind stopped paying attention new information virus, figured get twice yet? Oh okay, thank God he's slowing testing. also slow rate cases go back wearing masks attending rallies again.

Idiot. oh risk people riot protest?  CARES act badly managed filled fraud, places follow guidelines probably norm rather exception. studied available outside japan/india  something he‚Äôs least verbally implied hindered purpose creating better numbers American Coronavirus reporting.

While it‚Äôs undeniably political, it‚Äôs also undeniable it‚Äôs true instructed could slow testing he‚Äôs effectively done damage dataset. seethe harder No, CANT. Don‚Äôt bother giving molecule doubt. abominable mess. can't believe would debate whether helpful test kid novel deadly virus, even would recover soon. kid contagious others! people become contagious! trace them, test then, quarantine them, might prevent outbreak could otherwise cost tens, hundreds, thousands lives, mention illness long term consequences still know about. feel better?   Multilevel sales (read: pyramid scheme) vote him. Thought ""whats worst happen? Let experiment begin guess""

God happier days. Underwhelming. I'll say 7 year old account, secession definitely table west coast. Imagine Washington, Oregon, CA secede together...it cuts rest US Asia controls trade east.

Not hard believe, recently made COVID pact page politically Please. Go. Vote. Don‚Äôt let dumbest people best country make next 4 years annoying hell hole. said arena tried fill many people possible pandemic.... Link? I'll say 7 year old account, secession definitely table west coast. Imagine Washington, Oregon, CA secede together...it cuts rest US Asia controls trade east.

Not hard believe, recently made COVID pact page politically Yeah know. votes know I'd offend many supporters. Guess say anything nothing nice say damn. ""stuck""? We're stuck... Oh, wow. That's scary. Hope okay. True enough. friend recover. wholeheartedly agree would expect something got past inlet filter would get trapped cooling fins. brings things back increase air flow currents drier air allowing transmission travel accepted 6 feet. see hard he‚Äôs concentrating too! 
Such pathetic excuse human. Holy Christ....this difficult watch standpoint human. wrong, statement true. slow testing less confirmed cases. statistic cares about. amount people die irrelevant him. wants look better election time.   he‚Äôs straight anti-vaxxer. Here‚Äôs one MANY tweets subject: Yeah know. votes know I'd offend many Trump supporters. Guess say anything nothing nice say damn. That's point. see, though, misinterpreting misrepresenting says/ does/ means hurts cause? China won‚Äôt report anything. number skewd it‚Äôs insanity even look Sounds like cooked virus lab wizard oz ..Illinois checking Chicago protests spike... hmm looks like may something else.. wonder Wow last seconds stupid pucker thing lips Alec Baldwin SNL. didn‚Äôt realize Trump Actually way something water. Seriously, can't support BS IQ higher stained mattress. Biden's best route winning election comparable ""Luigi Wins Nothing"" videos youtube. Ok hot take here: He‚Äôs idiot. actually, directly killing people. Cool. *We survived Obama; survive Trump*

Didn't age well, it? found salmon: say, first case Wuhan also wild meat imported seafood? first accused Chinese eating wild animal meat?‚Äù asked user called Mydad Chinese microblogging site Weibo.

At least come together recognize world's dad's lead misinformation vectors. matter color nationality, dad probably talking bull. would idiot to. obvious tone, context, fact federal government control testing. Yea- PLEASE FUCKING NO. hell advocating shit mortality less .05% ???? Fuck off. 

When really smart people taste power- danger  That's changed address Florida. thinks avoid federal prosecution charges NY understand federal means he's still fucked. Sarcasm defence. makes worse honestly. CINDY KRISCHER GOODMAN üò≠ copy/paste...IM SORRY understand, kind asshole Listening dumbshit rant also accepted Idiocracy real. Nice üëå good job guys/gals. CHOICE WEAR MASK NOT. #thinblueline Went hip Pho place. Like line door till 2 place. installed window, cut corner building waiting area covered, added overhead heating, separate fast window delivery drivers normal window, touchless sanitizer dispensers. like bunch monkeys watching first monkey figure cup works That‚Äôs comparable situation first all. Lol. wear mask don‚Äôt go out. üòÇ sports organizations circlejerk raw trying figure spare bottom line, players power. Ah yes that's want world leader. hack stand act joking pandemic that's currently taking nation . imagine teacher's strikes federal government pushes schools reopen early? Teachers know better easy kids spread germs. gotta idiot actually believe sarcastic. Frankly supporters matter beyond, ""he told thing guy, boy strong"" mentioned many people seem portraying level education guy even have? surrealistic Oh my. Hospitals overflowing well, bound peak September. know plan handling it. Got one moment Reddit said three months ago Why? Nah, definitely popped Ambien. Big brain time Lol wondering thing. think commenter got confused post defending Trump on. Duterte taking virus seriously he's trying use Trojan horse bring martial law. happens he's taking title. Evil worse incompetence. ??? context joke. get people's attention fact done 25 million tests means logically cases. Wow Nothing see folks! That's gross misrepresentation A) ratio positive tests negative matters, absolute number tests, B) people symptoms stay home test confirms it. I‚Äôm hating Trump people saying ‚Äúcovid wouldn‚Äôt issue except Trump‚Äù plain wrong. Like yeah countries like New Zealand avoided crisis it‚Äôs small isolated island(s). US one biggest countries world center global commerce weak central government (not necessarily bad thing IMO true specific issue). always going problem here. However definitely agree problem wouldn‚Äôt nearly bad Trump. Still voting Trump November. Yeah, is. People want talk young people barely affected virus know insignificant portion deaths going one maybe even child's parents addition older folks likely someone's grandparents. lot survivors even people never catch going carrying scars rest life, even they're physical time said done. inject disinfectant joke too? refuse watch clips available? 

It sounds like pulling ostrich plausinly deny it. That's point. criticized for. Suggesting literally impeded testing, however, disingenuous U probably grab slurpee overpriced candy Yeah said closer week ago I'm sorry can't hear sound freedom. coughing upper respiratory infection. Mostly coughing. Yes, freedom sounds like coughing. shut fake news libtards. What's story here? flippity floppity? right means

But even account that, handled best way. almost 3 months now, yet facilities ben made resources allocated

And, top that, like US BLM protests, 'distracted' tension China footage funerals martyrs, clearly see, regulations followed Sorry, who's author? catch That's provably false. NYC example, 66% hospitalized patients understood contracted virus home. Cuomo, Mirphy, Whitmer, worried hospital capacity, put COVID patients nursing homes. Yes, lockdowns killed people.

States reopening 2 months relatively flat cases *declining* deaths despite elective surgeries resuming. 3 deadliest states deadly panicked, bad decisions caused people die needlessly.

This increase cases accompanied much smaller increase hospitalizations increase deaths. night day compared lockdowns. Lockdown panicked response breeds fear confusion. That's kills people. fans hypocritical people ever met.They claim corona thing stay home refreshing coronavirus sub like facebook. well reality. Okay, fucking hate Trump, rest clip ridiculous, part actually sound like he‚Äôs making joke. Obviously terrible one bad taste, he‚Äôs trying make point cases high they‚Äôre testing much, quoted line actually joke. choose ignore save life means necessary! Yay Trump! yay Foxnews! Instead suggesting others test get accurate numbers, he‚Äôs suggesting slow testing? joke. It‚Äôs first time he‚Äôs brought up. suggested before. He‚Äôs joking. boat here, 600 sq foot Brooklyn apartment. I've recently started using gym basement mask wiping things (and since one seems using all), man brutal. outside since March 11. can't listen speak anymore, really can't. said ‚Äúit‚Äôs making look bad‚Äù. dont look problem, there's problem. Confederated Tribes Bands Yakama Nation would like word. say... mean, inhuman sociopath, statements like seem odd. weird us normies. worse? 

I'm American living America. care China fudges numbers President telling he's cutting tests looks bad accurate numbers? 

I give shit rumors China I've got confessions face. part guns microscopic organism? That's matter. **The Palm Springs Washington.** tests = cases. Hah watched video. He‚Äôs typical speech would describe boisterous improv. pick slight irony, doesn‚Äôt sound like joke. means saying may well actually ordered slow testing. There‚Äôs video article. he‚Äôs done things stupid enough believable wish journalists didn‚Äôt ask take word work like Jimmy Dore youtubers always post video they‚Äôre talking about

Thanks reactionary downvote Like Bible types pick choose want believe Constitution suits them. sleep night knowing difference joke serious statement

Holy fuck guys offended literally anything Something president making light hundreds thousands deaths joking doesn‚Äôt sit right me. hand shaking tonight. looked multiple times. He's drinker know killed brother. He's always speed freak. *Daily* deaths falling two months. Yes, point, cumulative death number never fall... that‚Äôs point poster - really anybody talking Covid deaths - making. Right, I‚Äôm saying fact clearly one lay eyes huge problem. However, previous poster suggested immediately huge loud voice yelling ‚Äúpower outage‚Äù immediately. Usually vents beep back power (no idea model hospital using), medical equipment also beeps it‚Äôs generally kind alarming beep immediately apparent someone room/near room/paying attention patient should. Again: problem clearly healthcare worker paying attention showed president 25 year old greaser trying bullshit way work. Donny could great Fonz impersonation tried. Yeah, nowhere think we'd none, could avoided one much better. lot people, we're going lot cases lot deaths, even great job. could done LOT better. Maybe kept hopeful 20k deaths? 30k? 50k? know. I'm expert this. certainly, I'd hope, 122k climbing 13.3 million unemployed. I'd hope pandemic playbook would economic policy well. 

Mostly, I'd hope we'd much healthier country. Biologically, economically, politically.  think known disease is. ,for many people responds certain meds. would indicate psychosomatic. read long term effects covid, even mild asymptomatic case. scary. large human population whole world might able live like normal infevted, even Daniel Griffin 1735 Covid encounters patients since beginning pandemic. Averaging 20 patients COVID day. stands edge Rubicon legions proudly pisses it. Agree decorum part fact utterly lacks it. come on, Presidents crack jokes it‚Äôs often seen endearing. difference jokes want lose faculty hearing. it‚Äôs I‚Äôm thinking of, mayor actually opposed ruling council overruled him. Trump fucked next campaign he's gonna pay people make Biden look bad 180 actually run country properly huge percentage ""Spanish flu deaths"" caused secondary pneumonia. rest caused cytokine storm.

The death certificate likely accurate. seems specific joke Give day two, White House press secretary come bullshit ‚Äúwhat trump really meant‚Äù. I'm going say blame goes undecided crowd vote. think really saw shit show Trump could really be. know vote they'd definitely go back time try stop idiot elected. Goes show voting system needs change we're dealing lesser two evils. promised us 15 weeks ago retail testing could ever need 2 seeks ago. Watch language horrible disease badass name? cheer literally boast asking slow down. measures say easier explain justify drunk hermits like well It‚Äôs oh well now. 

She end getting food poisoning most, traveling places food poisoning common. routine Japanese companies expect employees work 80 hours week? Honestly ordering delivery awhile far expensive, things considered, whole foods. make less record. Yup, live regime alright lol hurt brain blatantly wrong? a) technology changed drastically 20 years


b) never major need coronavirus vaccine. amount funding number teams working find cure unprecedented. one go food/essentials shopping? think food essentials produced distributed right now? electricity utilities? Magic? Transport hub basically üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±

Please spare respirator plenty sets P100 filters. Like said, 12 hours hell. Especially I'd wear entire flight, breaks eating drinking whatsoever. 

Would probably pop sleeping pill. However, know I'd feel asleep/unaware surroundings flight pandemic. I'll thoroughly think things through. wait 25,000 students hit campus. could go wrong... incidence (of coronavirus, ed.) reduced. interpret epidemic peaking fewer infected April peaked, says, according Aftonbladet. 

Of course, pure bullshit. number confirmed cases doubled since end April... You‚Äôre right - bars liquor stores must exist cities either... /s Irrelevant 

The pandemic ended riots protests Denial seems come thats work someone Lupus stuff everyday sounds like autoimmune issues. Rachel! downvotes sustain Didn‚Äôt think Whole Foods. closest 30 mins maybe I‚Äôll try out! thought governor said everything control weeks ago ü§î block though 2 weeks we're still 1k deaths per day, admit go back normal? Says person lives regime allow people form opinion based multiple sources. Absolute freedom never existed United States, order nation state exist guidelines people can‚Äôt perpetually ""Pandemic Day"" weeks massive protest crowds too. Joe Rogan says fine. detract anything, state California higher population Canada. population density Canada vs US also pretty significant. saying. Go shop Whole Foods. EVERYONE, mean EVERYONE, wearing mask there. bit pricier, yes, worth chancing increased risk exposure elsewhere. Ironically Ponce de Le√≥n thought found fountain youth gator pit fucking infuriating. union sucks. Bigger better! I'm currently wearing mask sitting alone apartment none stop Got hope still play whole bubble thing, since Disney workers stuck bubble players pretty high chance least one workers eventually brings rona bubble. happens virtually spread like wildfire really understand could work man really wanted see Lebron win another ring 2 :( Wearing mask mandatory pubs. That‚Äôs probably one except staff. know mean. public transport it‚Äôs like 50% would say (in berlin). People don‚Äôt mind anymore. I'm careful brink insanity catch virus.

Today nice Seattle went walk sun. Wearing mask course, despite people (at least neighborhood).

So I'm taking walk feeling great person walking towards wearing mask decides sneeze TWICE right I'm cross paths them. Great.

I _think_ wind blowing would favorable direction drive droplets away me. _hope_ mask blocked droplets. Still, next two weeks filled anxiety üò≠ know, seem think I'm defending bullshit? I'm not. think crowd around 9k wish could recover sniffles 15 minutes... 10 year old vector infect whole church school bus locker room grandparents parents pre-existing conditions! rest world exists... also wants lower numbers personal reasons, incompetence. Could evil intentions manipulate statistics. Fuck Donald J. Trump either way, shit gone way far absolutely flabbergasted accountability still around 40% approval rating. People really retarded, turns out. cut drink drivers, time stop DUI testing then.^/^S virus became political current administration decided nothing prevent spread. country like India 1.3 bil people 12k cases? fully verified...

supports him. ok this???? president doing. importantly, terrible right wing anti-truth media bubble economy fell behind like every European country.

What I've read Sweden's economy remained relatively flat throughout compared Nordic countries. MUCH TESTING!!! (receives TESTING ANYONE ELSE!!! (receives BAD!!! (receives LESS TESTING!!! (receives applause...)


It's cult. 

He talks cheer, says even matter them. would hilarious wasn‚Äôt fucking real Yeah shot past 100K quickly, wasn‚Äôt week two ago? it‚Äôs 119K Don‚Äôt worry Tucker Carlson think one r/nottheonion crock shit. state going secede, tried they'd get fucked up. think USAF, Navy, Marines, Army going split up? election result? freaking way. It‚Äôs seriously much worse context. Usually verbal diarrhea can‚Äôt even really figure he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs pinpoint accurate he‚Äôs saying context actually goes *further* headline. He‚Äôs basically saying they‚Äôre throwing harmless colds positive cases. delaying infected cruises allowed deboard wanted keep cases us down. Life cheap country u think voted in?
I think point lot world lost faith American population making rational decisions. 
Doesn't bode well future.
It's Trump time, could someone far worse Trump next time.
Hopefully America wakes learns hard lessons this. Wuhan - fish market.

Beijing - fish market.

So yes, meat packing plant would issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Seems wet humid environments allow virus stay alive.

Also interest - Italy found Corona Virus sewage mid means around earlier suspected, especially enough volume detected then.

Wuhan likely convergence bad luck, vs source.

I'll bet testing goes countries (US I'm looking you), they'll find prior cases also. 

The International Mass War Games held Wuhan October likely spreader event.

Will interesting see eventually unpacks. Lol! 100,000 dead Americans. funny. leadership could see wires pulling glass rafters. Thank you! wear mask gloves store. gone protest(we small population tourist town) see videos park right across house. learning treat illness every day, helps death rate tremendously. 
Plus, could lag potential upcoming death spike due multiple weeks takes virus resolve/kill host. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs believable. one new case per hour. Pretty good ratio ask me! SEE LITTLE KID RUNNING AROUND, GREAT IMMUNE SYSTEM. PIECE IMMUNE SYSTEM? EVEN KNOW THIS.

Um, hell getting here? both. far Ive seen downvotes get ‚Äúyou much‚Äù get bombarded comments cant reply.

Its weird form censorship. yell silenced.    NM, opened outdoor seating seen spike couple weeks in. seeing one yet limited indoor seating either, thankfully. 

A little pissed mayor's talking alfresco dining shutting streets dining them, seen happen. genuinely excited it!

We high mask compliance, helps. Y'all good, stay safe!! Really tho number deaths recorded inflated count deaths people died Covid necessarily Covid get saying. comprehensive federal quarantine issues states may follow it. saw Trump wanted open everything up, States control make decision whether so. even different president Florida Texas etc could still made choices. know meant say ""absolutely anything"" ""absolutely nothing"", reminded [this 12 days WoW/SWtoR Christmas made laugh. Uhm...

Whaaat?

A person dumb, doesn‚Äôt even understand, stupid sounds trying share rot-brained logic justifications.  Everything bad someone elses fault, literally never takes responsibility anything negative. course anything good due him, whether anything it. He's narcissist. Aren‚Äôt supposedly ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù already? Je. Sus. Christ.

This man needs go trial genocide. r/technicallythetruth guess?  Plus, look something like .01% risk, look bad, run millions kids... (all Americans) are. always was. Modi declared lockdown kept giving people cringy tasks show power :

1. Come balcony clap. Entire country obliged.
2. Shut lights night light diyas (candles). places people turn lights beaten up.

He hosted 3-4 8PM televised sessions less kept praising well India handle crisis. continues (look recovery rate, etc)

Then declared 10% GDP worth economic ""stimulus"" marketed 4 days giving details actually turned &lt;1% fiscal stimulus unsecured loan schemes budget allocations future.

Also passed directive forcing people install app phones track COVID. pressure forced make open source version play store different one repository. they're outright malicious plain incompetent. looks like latter.   many cases,didnt hear overlord Trump? Fuckface Population goes up. Advancements techonology go up. 

This comparable past. We're communicating globally instantly. 

The problems always same. Racism. Classism. People changed hundreds hundreds years.

he's moron. effectively admitted gross negligence? Thank posting this. well written thought out. Hes used smarter people helping stay office benefit. thought Saturday holiday, didn‚Äôt report data also Friday. good news, second wave usually deadlier. Can't second wave still first one way world long time, virtually guaranteed multiple crises would come American president handle. reason largest crisis 100 years allowed so. was...literally nothing... i.e. fire pandemic team, sit back let experts handle relay experts recommending. actively did, continues do, exact opposite do; Whatever make situation worse, that's does. ignores expert advice simply can't bring someone else says prove he's smarter, impossible matter pit against. 

This terrible situation almost expected something bad like would happen. along way put children cages, fucked taxes, nursed white supremacy back health. First one, Indians pretty jingoistic, admit like stereotypical American proudly loudly loves country, Indian.

Indians love brag rag past, advanced western world ruined them, simultaneously giving single fuck current problems

Right now, due high tensions India China, bet people tell buy china-made products, local markets dictate china fails. end result buy less local shopkeepers stuck Chinese goods can't even sell refund, next big thing comes up, everyone forget happened continue life usual

I love country, jeez, stuff like infuriating put amber like mosquito call good. Hid initially, probably lost control could track later. IFR 1% undercounted cases 5X. Going every joke tells makes us look little hateful imo leader keeps saying issue created enemies stop excuse failures, admitting that's he's incompetent know fight back take control situation. probably much alcohol drugs, mixed wee dose Rona  SaRcHaStIc

Covid-19 spread easily ventilation system. must tape vents closed cover magnetic vent covers. weather get extreme open window adequate ventilation, use portable air conditioner. may good expose sick person outdoor weather summer. Room air conditioner infected person may best option especially since mainly pull air room, reducing much air leaks room rooms. definitely keep windows house open get ventilation reduce viruses get out. Use Skype call app always needed communication infected peasant peasant self.

Wear masks goggles comfortable long-term wear infected person's room near it. Masks exhaust valves fine actually may ideal. infected person also reduce viral load mask valves, wear sealed mask without valves since virus particles trapped within mask reinhaled. Shower put clothes washer frequently, immediately going room weaponized peasant committing germ warfare.

Vitamin C high dose, vitamin 5000 IU day (do exceed without doctor greenlight. Overdose fatal), multivitamin K2 inside, calcium magnesium (take one hour apart multivitamin), elderberry concentrate, bovine colostrum, berberine, true Ceylon cinnamon, rosemary powder, melatonin 5mg (only take night. Puts sleep drive taking it). peasants household also taking since higher chance getting infected bioweapon. Try get dexamethasone prescribed doctor early show recent study covid-19, definitely try get infected person needs hospitalization, deteriorates lot, prolonged symptoms.

Place plasmacluster/plasmawave HEPA air purifier medium speed room infected inactivate viruses. I've known studies effectiveness deactivating coronaviruses decade laugh ignorant people things life. help reduce viral load peasant keeps coughing virus particles air try reattach peasant lungs. ideally one air purifiers throughout house people spend time bedrooms living rooms, hallway outside infected person's door. Use high filtration HVAC filters 2200 MPR higher 3M Filtrete filters. Yeah seriously, pick one. Depending point he's trying make easily flip flops two. Trump: ""says something stupid""

Supporters: ""Na bruh, got wrong, joking""

Literally every time opens mouth, tweets something, posts facebook, something else that's facepalm moment, guys rush defense, joke taken context, etc. 

If say went killed Pence say murdered half congress (say republicans/conservatives) would still defend say joke, would finally figure give shit America wants attention? I'm honestly disappointed half country stupid enough vote him.

Really scary know people dumb, frank. need hugs social interaction I'm super happy. Sucks gotta bring guy minimalist. And... AND... wear mask increase risk likely socially distance. Then, go business, unmasked, higher chance becoming infected extra spreading virus. 

It makes angry public space person wearing mask. one smoke indoors second hand smoke concerns (which take years decades manifest), can't mandate people wear mask public order curb transmission virus kill within couple weeks exposure. 

Fucking stupid. stupidity America right terrifying hate everything. Knowing healthy Americans are, possible many get sick.  really, really hoping we'd get 4 years without national (and international) crisis Trump's time office. mean happen least election year actively hurting him...but people dying orange fuck continues think him. can't even, literally can't.

That‚Äôs beautiful great little ice cream shop street put Facebook post today saying one employees ill gone Covid test (had even gotten positive result yet) notifying customers closing days get rest employees tested clean. ice cream shop. Omg fucking cancer clinic? know job holy shit need notify people, could easily get someone killed. get feeling relies much data information provided rather going finding information themselves. Given people work composed people world, including Europe US, doubt collusion agenda China. skeptical every country validate information independently. Works 40% population, though. brain washing effective. anyone see stream? Packed stadium could probably count many masks worn hand. watched dude, went many tests U.S done compared germany, says bad part tests find cases... well shit thats them, stop tests still sick people, dont know die. Giving question benefit doubt, goes hypothesis. EU lockdowns generally disciplined tight enough actually work. 

Outside NYC, US really lockdown. white collar class stayed home (though far many ignored too), 'essential workers', aka much service industry, largely forced keep working unsafe environments. Yeah two contexts think are:
a. thinks sick person tested exist, much like babies think head gone hands front it

b. thinks test people unless show severe symptoms, non-severe cases important track document.

...so yeah, wrong either way, like said.  never said give up, virus spreadzs quick highly contagious. Plus, still know much survival rate surfaces.


Health officials saying gate, preventative care flare burn time... He's correct, spread hospital occupancy load focused research, remedies severe symptoms vaccine.

Like chill, truth hurts... put way much bias response even register said. That's fucked up. inside meat fine, since one touching inside, medium rare matter. also still exposed high heat, long.

Health risks aside, I'm going lie, idea eating raw ground pork makes want vomit. guys keep that- think texture alone would much handle. Nope, ""exhausted."" drugs. comedian type need alarmed. work peasants.

The level excuses people make deny severity disease knows bounds. read Sweden lately? deaths, economy fell behind like every European country. makes sense. implying deaths remain flat decrease people become infected? like saying less car accidents people drive roads. Playing devil's advocate here, would worth looking new cases become hospitalizations deaths next days. places past first wave, cases counts growing up, deaths going down, suggesting virus might turning infectious less deadly. would interesting holds true.  small towns Georgia new cases that. think so? suggests deaths going even though dropping 6 weeks running. poor people working local gas stations stuff near wearing masks chins. walked walked right saw Hahahaha. people brethren. *Trump voice* CHI-NA could...but still wouldn‚Äôt able craft masterful comedy errors last months America. would crisis matter president right now. much much smaller one. even great president US vast states much power ever coordinated response. mean reddit awash tending posts cruelty Chinese government's crackdown Hong Kong...if controlled site degree least think posts featured heavily. Cool HIV retrovirus STD, different type disease Coronavirus respiratory infection. plus side, end teenage pregnancy making pregnancy tests illegal give 18. Problem solved. Wait, someone named Rona dealing long-term corona effects? That's double cruel cult.

I mean, really, point Arnaud Amalric moment... Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius. ‚ÄúWe got ten year old here, he‚Äôll fine, that‚Äôs case!‚Äù

I mean yeah, you‚Äôd prefer family doctors know Covid? example shouldn‚Äôt tested? Jesus waters severely muddied turned prominent Lancet paper dangers HCQ turned based totally fraudulent decline level gladness LOL! worry, one moron soon push number much higher rallies. midsommar weekend right now, pretty much one working. They'll play catch next week. asked how. want know I‚Äôm voting probably bash rather answering thing. pretty solid Sanders unfortunately are. I‚Äôm undecided really fan Biden unless anything change mind. Maybe 3rd party, don‚Äôt know much Jojo I‚Äôve seen see getting behind that. worst part nobody cares anymore. show someone hundred videos saying absolutely care. Nah, heard theres others. one Chinese Biotech saying ready fall. Japan already studying itit treat corona. Japanese pharma discovered first flu repurposed it. Glenmark knocking molecule indian market generic. really think we'll forever state continual pandemic virus burn find cure/vaccine/treatment? fall mental trap. Comedians new York 9/11 wondered comedy would exist again. People always think present forever. not. GYNA They're exactly wrong. However pros outweigh cons situation. 

C02 bacteria still real concerns . automatically mean people going get sick. we've solved every respiratory diseases there? would say closer 1 month, people basically resuming normal activities now. feel you. supposed meet someone Boston week everything started shutting down. Probably able go week even everything handled well, there'd least chance could've visited summer fall. stands now, I'm hoping miracle I'll get see end year. They've using dexamethasone (a steroid), seems really lower fatality rate. Yeah, misread part, think . . . info provided confusing, first looked like 150 miles thing RV campers. looking several different versions info, concluded meant 150 miles *all* next counties?

Umm . . . no. 150 miles reaches across 2 state lines. 150 miles includes Atlanta, GA; Chattanooga, TN; Birmingham, AL; Montgomery, AL. Montgomery happens current ""hotspot"", concerns hospitals overloaded.

The store work full out-of-towners today. know tell? ask find things, say ""Sorry, I'm around here."" Right sneeze hot dog buns. :( Unfortunately, one cares. people immediately dismiss stating ""you must old sick, happen me.""

I really appreciate people like sharing story, wish masses would fucking listen. Hang there, hopefully permanent. Best wishes. goes away weather gets warm... agree international travel, doubt much back within next year.

As societal memory, people sub, yes. think americans, given death toll, view annoyance ruined 2020 way grandparents view spanish flu ...catastrophe

I wondered too. can't blame one church despite badly want too. protests, anyone common sense knows spreading everywhere. Haha. Wannabe statistician pissed one belives faulty unsourced lectures. Lol. Made day. far killing people fucking world read gay bears. spending much time Wall Street bets. point everything said correlation. California protest California spike =/= protest caused spike. many protests St Louis, spike that?

Young people getting infected =/= protest caused spike. happening across country likely part due expanded testing.

Yes likely virus spread protests, documented. based Minneapolis mass testing protesters also data mass spread.

Correlation causation point article situation much complicated tracing everything back single events. (Same argument made Memorial Day well) ""I need hugs fuck need them""  Never??? love u too. obviously never wore proper mask. Pollen can't pass them.  Yeah, people like drones. 

""Wear mask quarantine"" ok

""Quarantine lifted, virus still here, masks must"" enforce mask anymore wear them... Hey, goal flatten curve they‚Äôve done that... unfortunately appears back rise thus far goal overwhelming hospitals accomplished. 

I think everyone‚Äôs concerned weeks American health infrastructure may overwhelmed though. 

Personal responsibility leadership seem sorely lacking USA. Austrian (Middle Europe) here: stopped mandatory mask wearing week total infected number 500. medias job tell one important almost 0 bad news them

Lol Multiple factors likely. I'd caution reading much though still deadly/damaging virus. Anyway, best guesses are:

1. Deaths lagging indicator likely start rising next 10 days.

2. There's anecdotal accounts virus quite deadly currently. Could temperature humidity help patients recover. one knows sure.

3. Hospitals gotten better treating it.

4. testing more. account recent spike alone, could help explain fatality rate lower. Wear good mask avoid much possible. coworker get back PCB also anti mask know went everywhere tear gas certainly help  US didn‚Äôt cohesive response, part problem. NY NJ hit hard early managed slow transmission dramatically. NY NJ done great job, real struggle packed ICUs lot dying people, get control. 

Other states like FL, TX, AZ somewhat response half-assed, didn‚Äôt really lot cases spread think somehow lot states thought would spared due lack density population place like NYC area. kind grudgingly imposed lockdown restrictions never took seriously. course wouldn‚Äôt spared, ‚Äúreopened‚Äù soon great response anyway they‚Äôre seeing high increase cases. 

Now NY NJ better position rest country, tables turned. states responded like better shape well, it‚Äôs 2 states, they‚Äôre notable imo. quote much worse headline suggests. Presidents giving public speeches never cracked ""jokes"" like this. put jokes quotes jokes funny. isn't. not, I'm incredibly sorry came off. meant absurdity statement seems like something would come satire something world leader. Even figure seems optimistic. twist fate? crisis *because* charge. Well here's context you, "" 1 new case county. female 40s"". thank god hippa act that's relay. Good thing helps know come contact one ""zombies"" chance. looks like India surpass USA month two. cant melt steel beams  Considering obsessed Americans idea wearing face masks outside could mentioned part mask mandatory shops public transport literally one wearing mask outside. Trump: Slow testing down.
Crowed: *audible confusion* Bad bot part SAVED HUNDREDS THOUSANDS LIVES. GET HIT LIKE TERRIBLE. DONE VENTILATORS, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, TESTING. TESTING DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD. TESTED 25 MILLION PEOPLE. PROBABLY 20 MILLION PEOPLE ANYBODY ELSE. GERMANY DONE LOT, SOUTH KOREA DONE LOT. HERE'S BAD PART. TESTING EXTENT, FIND CASES. SAID PEOPLE, SLOW TESTING DOWN, PLEASE. TEST TEST. PEOPLE KNOW GOING ON. YOUNG MAN 10 YEARS OLD, SNIFFLES. HE'LL RECOVER 15 MINUTES. THAT'S CASE.

What part sarcastic? American, can't wait see Bidens campaign ads. Please tell they'll use clips Agent Orange saying stupid stuff? Bad bot We're lucky Europeans ahead development, selfish Americans. Trump would use vaccines USA giving single dose rest world. Fuck uou automod *was* peaceful dinner, though. Native Americans pushed region King Phillip's War, three quarters century later, still-independent Plymouth Plantation basically nonparticipant. History filled lot rotten shit, genuinely OK things well. truly scares messed efforts contact tracing. testing slowed ppl infected continue spread it. NY reopens Monday hope doesn‚Äôt spike. 

I already done tiny amount restocking event surges again. Trying stay positive it‚Äôs hard.  i'm sure line ""Trump defense participation award""

keep up! Ok bad assuming 2 brain cells rub together.

If test more, CONFIRMED cases, ergo look like bigger outbreak. believe China stopped low 80K confirmed cases? concerns exactly second reason avoiding virus. Speaking someone younger, likely had/has (still mild breathing problems chest pains), doctor's office hospital half dozen times since March. seems young show ""severe enough"" symptoms, they'll soon test everything else possibly imagine except COVID. guess reasons, sure great job hiking medical bills tests, even though I've never heart, lung breathing problems sort entire life March. even doctor try test tobacco use I've never smoked entire life. Getting test young dealing symptoms absolute nightmare right now. timing seems PR related. like many things, really knows truth anymore. article alleges measles outbreak, part thinks would arguing anti-vaxx side office. could bias speaking. 

He either saw light speak information knew existing vaccine would effective outbreak, strictly PR still feels anti-vaxx ways, giant experiment going American people. Anyway... little mental masturbation. idea new land colonists filled diseases.. Can‚Äôt wait Davis kick lol remember comment It‚Äôs much worse reading Imagine Shakespeare wrote plays now. anti-Vax might ok get elected, it‚Äôs also national security threat, don‚Äôt want measles running havoc army general population. Ah yes, Ruins aliens come upon Potty training hopefully stop shitting Constitution further. know used sit history class marvel stupidity people past, seeing obvious right thing thinking, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd never THAT.‚Äù yet, are. History show took lot longer took ridiculous turns necessary us get back track, killing people destroying things ever imagined. concerned turning syndemic. does, suspect mortality rate jump. Even though ebole 90% mortality rate.

Shit never regarded lightly. dont know dumbass president surely sucks politicians

Good, they're responsible, economy hurts much more... 

Because comparing heavy industry pharma middle pandemic going biased all, nope.  user banned.   forgetting current manipulation voters voter suppression GOP enforcing. pandemic could really work Trump he's able put many people voting possible. He's already trying anti-mail votes rhetoric. hear audience boo said they've done 25M tests?

Your boos mean nothing, I've seen makes cheer. think that's get cherries 100k+ americans dead funny you, even country? ""You're taking context. cherry picking.""

""Dude, played entire speech."" voters voting Biden voting Trump rather Biden given much Trump screwed everything year think enough. think Dem primary candidates would TBH. immediately slapped forehead saw Google news, reminds one gif [I‚Äôm dying they‚Äôre chanting like performed miracle something üòÇ 

what universe this? simple act drinking water really make people hard?? 

‚ÄúThis tiny water. hell come from??!!‚Äù üíÄ Personal protective equipment least Hillary idiot. racist bigot. far good choice, certainly lesser evil. Stronger candidate support Trump. Dont spread nonsense. U don‚Äôt need boss‚Äô permission go get test. say go get one ensure health &amp; safety family.  one knows anyone claims know isn‚Äôt trustworthy. think President United States get dumber transparent corruption, get proven wrong.  Jesus fucking christ.

Him audience stupid even realize point testing testing significant capacity. There's reason SK many tests... 4 5 months ago quarantined infected 2 million cases 100k+ deaths.

I feel like I'm watching downfall America's position international community real time, we've proven without shadow doubt nobody authority capable rational thought, due diligence, listening advise. History? We've got optimist here. swear... Onion couldn‚Äôt even make shit up... Biden incredibly popular groups actually vote, wont see much support Reddit. Trump win, even GOP concerned obliterated point they're stupid. mean choice 9/10 people 50 make, 2/10 people age. matter hard things get, much rage build, one 50 ever turns vote. hope I'm wrong time, like clockwork.  answer pretty disgusted Sweden, terms handling pandemic constant flip flops, down-playing statistics outright denial regarding serious situation also denial even herd immunity they've purusing months!

Because unless read Swedish, getting 2nd hand shitty information. Worldometers **sucks** comes Sweden, despite pointed people using data, change, people using data change either fits message huge amount deaths every day. Reminds this, obvious reasons Nature didn‚Äôt give care gene. Silk ties get wet. even dry clean them. Also, sooo many billions dollars, could probably even replace couple. children great immune systems either, he'd know he'd ever done parenting.D testing WAY anyone else, cases.

You understand reality works, right? 

The number cases change depending much test. number cases absolute. Closing eyes make magically disappear. want lie others now? Christians really Insha'Allah mentality, even self-righteous YOLO phrase go along it. What's joke? Damn Benjamin Button! well voted him, 2 choices big election. hillary. Costco.

Also, microcenter clue history Brazil? How's curve coming? Still gone August? Country matter seems. whether white people charge non-whites get conditions. correct. certain businesses going hugely negatively impacted. fault pandemic....but open makes things worse. gotten point numbers large, nobody cares anymore. Deaths longer seen tragedy, everything statistic now. That's true all, however putting protocols place, getting enough staff along ppe costs money. lot private care homes would see unnecessary cost. manage contact tracers state's health department couple counties. true. even text monitoring app sign people pushback amazing. We're using national guard contact tracers. Normally job similar STDs. swear getting people tell slept hole, much easier getting people tell fuck went dinner.  timeless classic days come, sadly don‚Äôt know ins outs believe Medicaid Medicare. Hopefully someone knowledgeable chime believe 5 years can‚Äôt house name believe hiding assets. Many times older people reluctant sign house family member. time comes suddenly need go nursing home one wants give family home also can‚Äôt afford pay grandmas treatment either. think older people illusion adult children take work take care time comes children think find loophole get elderly person financial help still inherit family home. watched happen husband‚Äôs grandmas. don‚Äôt fault anyone uninformed works, observation. Ok america testing people alot used tests equals confirmed cases San Francisco second-most-dense major city US, done pretty well. 

Seoul, South Korea dense NYC people, they've hundred deaths. 

It's population density, least much. Lol comment subreddit nutshell, it‚Äôs kind amazing. probably degree mask wearing. We'll see trump pageant show plays terms spread. carbon copy guidelines. It‚Äôs almost exactly CDC guidelines. CDC says: least 7 days onset symptoms least 3 days declining symptoms last 72 hours fever. yes mild cough fine, long respiratory symptoms improving trend. unique Sweden countries similar guidelines don‚Äôt really understand fuss about? much do, human labor expensive, euthanasia answer. didn‚Äôt hear? Coronavirus over, mask-less lady grocery store coughing told me. Mods please remove. states took time opening better prepared immunity protection states opened 30 days ago part lesser restrictive lockdowns back March NY/NJ/PA? Yes, lot elective surgeries medical reasons, cosmetic. even cosmetic surgeries important people's morale emotional well being.

I found late last year BRCA gene mutation significantly increases risk breast ovarian cancer. Pre-pandemic, ovaries/tubes removed scheduled preventive mastectomy later year. Mammo MRI looked good, afaik, cancer.

My surgery scheduled go ahead scheduled, several months knowing would. women support groups participate surgeries delayed.  


I get would hope best mine delayed. stepfather brother thought nerve set boundaries abusive mother deserve know family BRCA risk. found accident. there's already year half delay that.

Women make different choices this. opt screening. talking breast surgeon, primary care, FORCE peer volunteer friend doctor, well lot research, think best bet surgery.

I wish gene mutation increased risk, need surgery. given do, want surgery want get start recovery. Infection Fatality Rate; basically death rate. Wait, thought COVID-19 hoax? tracking hoax? ü§™

Also, Apple Android add terms service EVERYONE accept one reads it. mean divided like Europe divided 30 languages? many different religious sects? Vastly different histories? Fair. California potentially lock gets control. right cases rising, deaths steady. Hospitalizations ticked up, still far capacity.. Unfortunately that's hits. going along fine then...Wam bam. initiative set aside hotel rooms people tested positive isolate families popular. Though city rented 1,200 hotel rooms free use virus patients, 60 80 rooms occupied recent weeks... 1,000 virus patients instead asked support isolate home, assistance grocery medicine deliveries, preferred remain families...

I simply understand this. People prefer expose families infection rather going free hotel stay? know people die. thought saying something different need grow up. everything need spelled people act like adults use inference? This.

Is really safe eat indoors restaurants? Well, unsafe enough require mask seated eating.... suddenly safe remove mask eat? lost job serving brought boss. What? don‚Äôt get you‚Äôre saying, New Zealand actually secret land border? land borders isn‚Äôt actually advantage? 

Not land borders definitely big advantage preventing covid, mentioned Canada show it‚Äôs possible even without advantage. many feelings. cut back social media. Force exercise daily go walk too. helped try find joy everyday. One day time shall pass. know shared anything profound experience feeling like describe helps cope. Hope feel better soon. Yes, lot elective surgeries medical reasons, cosmetic. even cosmetic surgeries important people's morale emotional well being.

I wish gene mutation increased risk, need surgery. given do, want surgery want get start recovery. YET keep borders closed countries...cemented closed... /Rant Totally agree. think rest advanced world thoroughly disturbed. like intentional. pulled Brazil think WHO, CDC well trusted organizations hundreds worlds best researchers doctors employed better equipped judge risks here. least I‚Äôm going trust recommendation 7 days declining symptoms 48 hours without fever. basic recommendation countries follow. unique Sweden. Welcome American family raw one. percents make absolutely sense. Go solo job. gym. know that‚Äôs even going happen?

Because that's works. Thinking magical thinking caused people think ""it effect country"" reason back February. surprise nurse worked hospital many years. Within last ten years bottom dropped out. goal goal get pt in, test bill everything insurance, get out, next. nothing actually finding treating might wrong. billable. New York locked put covid patients nursing homes?

Thats logic?

No, causes panic getting caught guard dangerous pathogen know much about.

Cuomo makes decision regarding nursing homes regardless lockdown. Almost ten local restaurants town closed due Covid positive employees past three days. work restaurant ton tourists Florida surging states. Employees required wear masks none customers do, obviously matter time one us gets it. It‚Äôs unfair situation, forced go back work lose unemployment. pictures suggest spike cases coming young people going beach. couldn‚Äôt farther truth.

If case among young people, aren‚Äôt catching beach. sheriff relieved command replaced. Initial surge never happened early lockdown? lockdown lifted experience care homes UK simply means that. I'm also deeply shocked Sweden's behavior. would *never* expected *Sweden* places. 

However, done tremendous amount digging sociopolitical situation recently, I've done last months explain quite well: somewhat taken elite interests pro-business (wolves) wear sheeps' clothing. unless looking closely, outside/at glance everything looks like might expect Nordic social democracy scratch surface, see safety net / concern human health welfare replaced something else entirely. 

This slams Swedish cuture almost religious like faith authortities, many Swedes cannot even begin countance authorities might betray questioning forbidden strictly punished immediate often forceful social sanction, corrupt elites free please little pushback populace. 

Although said public support *finally* starting crumble (support strategy [63% ), becomes obvious Sweden's strategy failure seriously harmed Swedish people. Pittsburgh population 300,000. 

Philadelphia population 1.5 million. 

There‚Äôs bit difference (500%), compliant philly versus Pittsburgh two different scopes. 30% states population philly 3 directly surrounding suburbs, land area covers 3% entire state. !remindme two weeks necessarily. places made covid-only wings staff supposedly works patients. pro sport wanting return needs markets aren‚Äôt Covid hotspots. NBA going Florida right bad fucking idea. NHL hasn‚Äôt announced anything, many people suggest Las Vegas one hubs... feeling what‚Äôs happening California Arizona soon bleed Nevada hasn‚Äôt already.

The NHL hub cities Canada, specifically Vancouver Edmonton done well limiting cases hospitalizations NBA look at... don‚Äôt know. Anywhere Florida, Texas, Arizona state isn‚Äôt exploding. don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll able get Canada seeing one franchise players Canadian, lot arenas Canadian non-NBA markets could maybe host teams games.

But bubble talk needs actual thing. Players teams need area they‚Äôre tempted leave bubble risk infecting others. Vegas Disney aren‚Äôt that. it‚Äôs club think is, pretty small. Like many comedy clubs, people packed like sardines. unlikely, may bit safer (Via 6 ft social distancing) cut attendance 60%-75%. ...no offense isn‚Äôt healthy looking family. Welcome ""rolling lockdown"" matey. 

Nothing going shutdown locked way. small weekly bi-weekly closures.  Theaters reopen little bit, they'll roll lockdown soon. America cant blame anymore. saw happened nyc many states administration ignored it. choose reopen states prematurely. laughed ignored like nyc deaths it‚Äôs fact believe people right put dangerous situations long doesn‚Äôt endanger people consent it. want go jump water bunch great whites cage tell foolish it‚Äôs choice. treatments doctors account much, much lower death rate? reason old people vote often disabled people surprise. worked took seconds.

Doesn't help people wanting feel absolutely safe though ü§∑üèª post exactly I'm talking about, look middle link, tons slavery apologist articles, tons propaganda Thank you! Yes based guidelines available research. It‚Äôs similar example US CDC guidelines. CDC says 3 days since recovery / 72 hours without fever. is, however, one important confounding variable. much rural areas. words, there's things do, rural areas. People still want things, especially everything opening. places go, much likely everyone town able interact everyone else, they'll going 1-3 locations hang together. So, even one person town go hang friends, there's good chance singular incident could get good portion town. Nothing private. whole thing back February super deadly contagious virus that's everyone arguing lockdowns. testing know way people (many never even knew it) means contagious even close deadly serious illness initially thought overwhelming majority population. time open everything let people get back work able provide families. media continued push ""new infections"" selectively apply groups shame try shut result hope everyone reading see completely wrong is. twice many. states testing less may. It‚Äôs crazy amount liability especially after-hours. far take it? Escorted guard everywhere go? gonna housekeeping housekeepers?

And frankly, NBA players general, given general age... rather low risk. handling current spike Germany (Tonnies --- meat packing plant) create impression we, Germans, become careless. impression rather mix of
- corporate greed
- optimistic policy choices
- dealing coronavirus easy; particular, one notice outbreak late (1000 people already infected)

that lead outbreak. One hopeful measures suffice, outbreak bad, contained.

I wonder lessons learned, outbreak size Germany again. high impact journal, low. well known one public eye Wakefield paper erroneously linking autism MMR vaccines. average retraction rate medical literature every thousand. Fanduel leaving $$$$$$$ table speak Good news terns recovery number news cases everyday still worrying.  No, pleasure Anywhere find Europes testing per day numbers? I'm part 70%. government FUCK OFF. Yeah makes sense haven‚Äôt left house three months, didn‚Äôt realize deaths skewed copper? cut cups bra redesign face masks? realize USA Ministry Health equivalent countries, effectively making states separate country context pandemic response. flattening curve landing spot healthcare isn‚Äôt overwhelmed far they‚Äôre successful. 

It depends goals Since Medicaid state program state rules. Frank Reynolds approves. Ideally, start manufacturing vials syringes now. new talking point shifted 'increased testing reason new cases' 'it protesters fault.'

This distraction important point, indoors safe without everyone wearing mask. Restaurants open dine unless outdoors. goes bars. safe, cause cases multiply. Well jave send people there. need freaking many people think that's option unfortunately. Management really believe masks semi enforces look like we're following guidelines set board. I'm sad can't people learn effective measures people works. eg. China recommended mandated masks day 1 confirmed human human transmission, China one best stats per capita terms covid-19 cases deaths. stop eating meat pandemic pans. good :/ Every nation **DOESN‚ÄôT** division America has. 

Literally nobody said ‚Äúbecause blue flag‚Äù kind argument that? countries well ahead America human rights. 

The level division America unmatched developed nation. China know virus food supply don't? scientific basis thinking virus infecting food supply? It‚Äôs interesting see fast people change tune granny dies covid.  
Source:My coworkers... You‚Äôre right. funds pay care almost money apply Medicaid. also pay couple grand attorney they‚Äôll help apply. It‚Äôs lot legwork getting bank statements several years back selling property. 5. viruses bacteria multiply animal cells Honest question- you‚Äôre wearing plain mask protect others wearing mask triggers asthma, wear mask? There‚Äôs usually medical exception cannot wear one? (If you‚Äôre wearing N95 type protect yourself, disregard.) Flattening curve flattening curve. general term slowing rise point rise constant (flattend curve) turning rise downwards trend. reach flattend curve 40.000 new infections 2.500 deaths per day that's point happy results. That's point numbers need go down. Fast. OP, Germany, quite careless. I‚Äôve seen quite people public transport either mask wearing completely wrong. Facts almost always inseparable bias.

Even reporting facts, facts emphasized facts omitted reflective article writer. Whatever else goes on, mama nursing home, would want covid-infectious patients returned home. consenses seems patients infectious whether case severe mild.

Look nursing home deaths caused politicians' demanding infectious cases sent nursing homes New York. huge percentage home populations died. national disgrace would want replicate.

The hospitals prepared infectious cases nursing homes geared staffed elder care.

So unless hate Mama, Grandpa, Grandma, might want covid-infectious cases nursing homes. local haircut place northern Michigan requires everyone wait outside car appointment. Employees wear masks &amp; face shields. Customers required masks denied entry. It‚Äôs safest haircut place ran. Got badly needed cut week ago. This! competent government, I‚Äôd hope would prioritizing safety reopening schools way prioritized safety medical facilities. order keep schools open, mass amounts PPE tests fast results. home tests would amazing unfortunately, I‚Äôve heard little this. long ""prolonged"" exposure? 20 minutes? hour?  could utilize phone location data surveillance people are. obviously huge civil rights issue.

Aside hard lockdown probably order, feel like see cases spiraling lockdown realize countries Europe governments part single country, right? Norway 244 deaths. Sweden 5,053.

45/million inhabitants vs. 505/million.

The pandemic virtually stopped Norway. wide spread Sweden. border stay closed vaccine. Really. slave owners? Lot vaccines fail stage three. antibodies need prevent infection cause ADE. seems many people develop antibodies fight covid tcells. Semantics are, opinion, purposefully construed lean toward reopening rhetoric. may seem innocent enough slightly hint toward idea it‚Äôs 2nd wave, masses people start spouting like fact start spreading around. makes people feel comfortable large enough amount people aren‚Äôt stringent cautious, becomes almost herd mentality. virus never fully dying rising again; it‚Äôs constantly popping place leveling other, careful others not. viruses bacteria sure grow well meat. stop eating meat folks, least close breeders I'd move Sweden time given opportunity cough two months year due allergies. stay home two months post nasal drip tickling throat? part process certify company GSA contracting schedule, based kinds evidence supply *beforehand* prove experienced qualified perform kind work sought, company founded seven days prior getting federal government contract NOTHING FRAUDULENT. think it, WHOLE continent able suppress yet, country able least decrease rate infection ‚ÄúWell talking arbitrary metric feel important death rates.‚Äù website full morons. ‚ÄúConversion‚Äù interesting see economy US, Brazil, Russia, India virus every country bans travel to/from countries.

The way we're structured, production office (PO) designates inventory global marketing office (MO) based demand local laws. example, smaller contracts Indian government, failure deliver incurs direct fines. US, that's case, global PO may prioritize Indian MO North American MO. regional PO's exist countries governments prevented us exporting supplies utilizing version Defense Production Act. factory Europe may allocating 100% supplies EU whereas American factory still trying meet global contracts Asia, thus limiting supply North America.

I work North American MO, receive allocation inventory boss needs designate much land US. need step try secure much region (which US northeast) feed larger direct accounts (like FDA NIH Intramalls), well 150 distributors sales reps interface directly individual accounts (like local hospitals). sometimes borrow shift inventory regions, always go well. might able talk counterpart Toronto ship supplies hospital need NYC, government stops export, there's nothing do. flip side, NYC dragging feet paperwork one week April sent part inventory allocated Connecticut instead. point goal help run many tests possible region per day, still think would better kind government coordination (Jared Kushner never called say anything go, would involved maximizing profits basis? would differently normal increase production capacity?

I think missing key point - less profit unavoidable manufacturing bottlenecks. money world conjure additional molds instantaneously (though might help get line faster). 

Also, keep mind testing effort significantly shifted volume specific items. make 500 different types lab plastics. might sell tens thousands popular skus worldwide per week prior pandemic (just guess). Post pandemic, we're selling hundred thousand pieces per week three skus (enough roughly ten million tests). converted could, increased could, trying expand much possible quickly possible, again, money necessarily problem. 

The article linked touches guy says 200 orders hand mask printers. make masks, we're one companies line get molds made better fulfill contracts. mold manufacturer charges us $500k mold, that's fine, pay $1MM get mold two weeks faster? $2MM get three weeks faster? That's starts get way head, comparison, Thermo Fisher spent $40MM increase capacity million tests week three months. They're lot bigger us though, whereas think probably need wait line bit more. compare EU, there's much difference US Since many nations shown drop transmission rate incredibly low shown entirely contain possibly eliminate virus, probably goal, instead going death toll high score.

Maybe someone needs explain Trump it‚Äôs like golf, lowest number wins? mean yeah, post misinformed disproven 30 second Google search. We're beginning learn long-term effects might impact life expectancy. America place wearing mask somehow equated attack muh freedumbz? Cars expensive taxes, market unpredictability, bigger profit margin compared countries people dumb enough pay it. Look actually really fucking hard do. clearly didn't. know numbers work? risk supply chain workers restaurant staff. job stack frozen meat day, wash hands handling piece meat? can't really compare ""One US"" either then

But starting suspect early January Southern California Covid-19, cheap, reliable way proving it.

There questions accuracy anti-body tests, thought seem better many tests - especially recently taken market complete junk.

Then question cost. health insurance checked they'd cover anti-body test showing symptoms now.

It'd nice reliable test could home say $50. I'd willing spend much verify suspicions. seems people care anymore masks social distance.

At least Supermarkets Germany people still wearing masks around here. collapsed covid, due covid!!! Issue case is, many workers travel history, checked upon re-entering country. might picked Virus way introduced factory.

That problem Virus, one person travels infect many others, even careful good hygiene standards. Yet. It‚Äôs weird something obvious mass gatherings catalyst downplayed incubation periods even over. It‚Äôs like, politics somehow involved.... small handful people masking dangerous 100,000 people shoulder shoulder city streets (I‚Äôll generous) 60% wearing masks?

Why lifting Sweden fucking high pedestal? posting history seems like completely obsessed Sweden. 

We unique. Holy shit. patients ""took back"" contracted disease nursing home first place. already spreading ""forced"" accept back.

The nursing homes trying dump patients need hospital-level care couldn't/wouldn't take measures necessary mitigate spread themselves. Even women....? wonder Sweden would graph Perhaps one school expand successful? (although sure parents would feel guinea pigs) AHAHAHA holy shit.

Im even shithole even know Minus UK is. least moment PA seems alright though. disturbing hear, doesn‚Äôt take long virus spiral control hence precautions so, important. live also well since reopen, time goes gets hotter starting notice people wearing masks less often. Still minority it‚Äôs growing minority people throwing PPE window realities modern life include giving us option dump 'loved ones' system suffer abuse.

That make good decision. We're talking law. random bullshit invented cover tiny penis. First, past half way year terms outbreak started 

err... sure would say that, Jan20 countries started reporting cases, 5 months ago. Dec31 Wuhan reported cluster pneumonia cases, 5.5 months ago. second, aren‚Äôt ‚Äúnear top.‚Äù 

deaths: 467,817. far closer 550k top 150k bottom range. 

anyways, quibble minor aspects numbers day, havent addressed real point, covid19 numbers numbers ENTIRE WORLD SHUT DOWN.

You're comparing swine flu numbers WITHOUT lockdown covid19 numbers lockdown, saying ""see! they're pretty much same! even lock covid19 since numbers same"", just... dont know there's even word dumb is. Maybe something that, 

"" *So said people, slow testing please.* ""

That's quote repeated lot next week. Do...do think Asian markets middle America? Local mall reopened last Monday. Four days later shut revealed dozen employees COVID. Wife's friend manages store there. Said July 1 they'll reevaluate reopening then. really wants make difference could follow guidelines. Always appear camera appropriate social distancing taken account always wear mask. Talk it. Make normal part daily life. People naturally mirror leaders. recording around 1-3 new cases per million per day several weeks, make sense keep everything lockdown? never cared. stopped talking healthcare workers second BLM protest/riots started. Yes, ultimately manifests states. states rural areas become red states. ones urban areas become blue states. looked map Florida Department Health puts showing many counties icu's already full? thought starting slightly better Minnesota surprised see us OUTBREAK ALERT list. I'm Portsmouth everyone masks bus.

They letting people without unless there's medical reason.

Shops mot many masks. You‚Äôre talking MASSIVE doses. found typical supplement. Florida shitty data - New York. quality data USA pretty terrible around. Florida story, though, mischaracterized think, New York gotten bit free pass shitty handling shitty data reporting.

The Florida 'Covid data scientist' bit narrative sell gofundme. claims Florida undercounted deaths 90. Meanwhile New York told undercounting deaths almost 6,000 'working it' get fixed. Seriously though, (unfortunately) go walmart today 10% people wearing masks nose out. great news. also seen one report, even states currently spikes cases, outbreak daycare similar facility. think happen would pretty widely published. Harm kids something gets downplayed way elderly nursing homes does, teens ""irresponsible"" going beach. number children 2 parents die COVID statistically insignificant. Maths, feelings.

Southern USA not. Big difference. üó£Ô∏è Well half Russia numbers don‚Äôt really mean anything  Must nice government actually shows accountability admits they‚Äôve made mistake it. see maybe 1 person mask day Denmark. Pretty much everything open, limits amount people together hand sanitizer everywhere. Usa needs stand Israel one sounds like end life anyway also happened COVID-19. god! really need check getting information from. check type mask many hours continuously wearing cause hypercapnia actual reliable source. Stop spreading false information casually. America really sound like 3rd world country I‚Äôve experienced opposite, much stronger sense camaraderie That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. It‚Äôs bunch things. Maybe bias protesting outdoors heat isn‚Äôt environment virus thrives in. People absolutely getting protests experience, protestors generally cautious wearing masks. I‚Äôm far concerned people packed indoor nightclubs wearing mask. don‚Äôt understand sub tries remain apolitical simultaneously posting political stuff. It‚Äôs really annoying. things get worse though, it‚Äôs even important people surrounded corpses months end day every week. 

The paperwork wait Mondays. I‚Äôve few, including DC estimated ~200k people one day. Mask hand sanitizer use higher streets DC anywhere else I‚Äôve been, every corner people handing free masks hand sanitizer.

Granted, anything brings together thousands people hundreds cities going involve risk almost certainly spread people, people outdoors, conscientious, properly wearing masks &amp; reminding everyone else to, touching strangers, even social distancing limited extent helps mitigate it. might different story protests, I‚Äôve northeast, IME people pretty aware concerned. see that's reason, since wearing masks keeping distance independent. work healthcare support NYC, seeing many deaths hospital system (2000+) way hell go without mask. last months would wear N95 public transit many people wearing masks.

Normally I'd wear N95 patient room ventilator virus could aerosolized, number people close proximity makes must.

Tomorrow go next phase reopening, I'm watching numbers infection rate hoping best preparing worst again.

Even walking around outside I'm seeing gatherings people hanging without masks, drinking smoking etc.

Unfortunately feel like going learn hard way. Well expect people backwaters flyovers told/brainwashed thinking ""Anyone speaks DJT DJT hack!"" r/holup like, ‚Äúthey died organ failure, covid?‚Äù lmao, I've conversation hundred times. next tell I'm black tell black people racist too. gtfo loser going tackle ""systemic racism"" need really specific exactly going going needs backed evidence.

Collapsing due low oxygen levels definitely known symptom though hell saying asymptomatic. Perhaps pre-symptomatic...until symptom presented. America first Never thought would envious Italian ability follow rules competent government. offense, things Italy famous for. turns USA comparatively incapable things.

So moronic control sounds right. forget arrogant. Everyone looked Italy disdain (including government officials) sure anything like Italy. right - we're much worse. think makes sense terms spread sure. think dense areas still risky, density people go day day True.

I find crazy people saying ‚ÄúI sure March‚Äù ‚ÄúI sure November‚Äù.

You probably right, someone feels way assume resume normal lives. teacher want mandatory masks staff students, half kids every day Friday full elearning. one kid per seat bus, exceptions. Germany, France, Spain Italy require masks shared inside space going reduce spreading cases lot. Danes congregating closed spaces without masks we're going resurgence. let's talk Sweden. mismanagement borders mass murder. Even Tegnell said herd immunity ""main"" goal.

When qualify statement like that, admitting least one goals. case simply unvoiced part ""strategy"".

They say ""we want slow spread hospitals overwhelmed""... what? comes that? They've slowed spread, stopped it... expecting happen?

Clearly, expecting virus spread enough people become infected ""herd immunity"" kick bring epidemic halt. That's monitoring it, making announcements it.

It always obvious conclusion ""strategy"". US death rates lower Europe. I'd attribute difference graphs result higher rates testing US (my wife tested 3 times now). Though uptick US cases/deaths get much worse due protests. Ok? graph posted says ""Western Europe"" excludes UK - one hardest hit countries. Unless there's shitload tectonic activity last two weeks, UK still part Western Europe. state reopened 6-8 weeks we're fine. Sweden one worst affected countries, even social distancing measures, widespread early testing bans things like gatherings 50 people. also pretty good contact tracing isolation infected individuals.

It without doubt possible contain virus without lockdowns. Masks, social distancing, large events, aggressive testings/tracing/isolation, etc. states US problems this. acting like business usual, causing uncontrolled exponential spread. comparison Sweden curve Arizona curve. Evolve death?

Now we‚Äôve got confusion that. Imagine initially came actually transparent, saying something along lines cloth masks recommended public save medical grade masks frontline workers instead 180 pulled. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve tried make thing worse times lol, unbelievable incompetence Please check data. US country badly, one worst. Brasil even worse, that's something proud of. young people long term complications CoVid. pretty much back normal parents died it.

No, 'give parents'... father brought home rehab center recover rehab coronary bypass got scared heard ""3 cases CoVid!"" brought home Mom, sickening killing Mom.

I blame Daddy... blame rehab center Daddy symptoms reputable reasonable doctor would said ""CoVid test needed!"" Suppressed key word: kinked hose. happens release kinked hose? It‚Äôs really simple. people catching protests? Absolutely, protests largely outdoors saw many people wearing masks. Also states like Florida aren‚Äôt massive demonstrations cases surging. There‚Äôs whole mix things including protests Memorial Day weekend. I‚Äôd actually inclined credit indoor restaurants, bars, clubs operating normal capacity states like Florida Arizona. teachers parents much likely die it. argument like governor Florida. Typical racist comeback. keep living head sand part problem. Good luck life sir. wanted Brexit not? Yeah, bunch people see disease political issue. Fine, place vast majority experts believe originated from. apologies. ""patients"" appears title... probably poor wording. Nope, good catch, typo! 90% did. false negative rate around 10%. Actually handled COVID19 quite well. ‚Äúthe best‚Äù possible result. 

In late March facing close 2 million possible deaths point hospitals got overrun. ‚ÄúThe best‚Äù possible result told 100,000 dead.

We sheltered place it. 100,000 dead. 

No hospitals overrun also confirmed many animals reservoir species.... ""Traditional UV-C light, however, cannot used humans present.¬† short wavelength light (between 100 280 nm) absorbed dead skin, exposure UV-C light cause reddening skin and, eye, conjunctivitis. reports link development cancer.""

This article dumb inconsistent itself. 220nm 100 280nm. UV light leading cause melanoma. say ""some reports link development cancer"" ridiculous attempt play truth. 

Bottom line something damages nucleotides (e.g., DNA, RNA) one organism like virus damage nucleotides Humans well.

UV-C light role play sterilization, Humans around. fuck whatever happens afterwards.

If dude gets re-elected country deserves gets. comes wearing masks, greatest chance infection occurs either put take mask.

It's point good chance touching face hands, could transfer virus hands mask. fewer times take off, fewer chances infection.

Ideally properly sanitize hands every time either putting taking mask wearing clean mask time minimize risk, even safer keep between. Covid showing keep people sick months. Also permanent lung damage, kidney failure etc... I'm pretty sure would suck dialysis rest life starting age 17 feel like article especially headline showing misconception term ""elective surgery"". opposite ""essential"" ""urgent"".

Something slightly uncomfortable dismissed despite safety reasons common throughout world.

I mean, even laws place people still often bother wearing seatbelts. nice username lol girlfriend currently Michigan Colorado. staying parents sister seen several friends met new people meals (indoors) without masks. returns day move new apartment wants friends come help.

Social distancing beach admirably observed. main worry tourist coming next week things, especially entitled English (disclaimer: I'm English) . There's sign people sensible months suddenly stop that. almost organising mass demonstrations political gain could detrimental pandemic  55 countries americas yet say america mean USA Would nice know numbers patients recovered, Dr. Christ doesn‚Äôt want release numbers reason.

My guess: Arizona never tracked active cases far gone there‚Äôs way put strong estimate.

Another mistake add wave incompetence plagued Arizona virus. course might helpful, might help flatten curve, disingenuous state critical flatten large parts world using much, still flattening curve. can't critical case. home country must awful Oh, thought country size big budget sort control, yeah guess vastly different imagined. It‚Äôs mind blowing, always felt need wash hands using public transport even COVID. Can‚Äôt imagine going bus/train without mask now. Hey whatever want believe guess. guys keep moving goalposts tiring keep No, think missed antibodies aren‚Äôt immune response bodies use. grounds impeachment Exactly. 2nd wave matter cases? Gonna respectfully disagree one. Incubation period 1-2 weeks such, typically see rise given event *in terms diagnosis* 1-2 weeks fact.

Now hospitalizations death? 100% agree month range. It‚Äôs rolling thing that‚Äôs tough pinpoint science it‚Äôs different everyone, say 2 week buffer phases. Diagnosed within 2 weeks event, hospitalized within 2 weeks diagnosis doesn‚Äôt get better, death within 2 weeks hospitalization. There‚Äôs delay process feel don‚Äôt understand, especially crowd pointing current hospital rates win current diagnosis rates...doesn‚Äôt work way. cases spiking indicate surge hospitalizations near future, hospital discharges today indication case numbers weeks ago I‚Äôm willing sacrifice karma righteousness. History judge nevertheless  studies quantify percentage ongoing problems 'recovery'? I'd admit protests 100% definitely contributed rising cases. Scotland here. How's goin Ireland &lt;3 trying make happen.. that‚Äôs also none business. article 17 hours ago.. rally. Cases rise event even took place. find one 3 weeks see whatever Canadians recommending.

Good idea Um, no, said ""fact"" started wet markets. ""vast majority experts"" agree. Sorry hurting feelings pointing misinformation.

The first known infections linked wet market, yes. still repeating over? make said correct, I've already said multiple times disagree. Make sure antibody tests FDA approved. lot used reason. Tulsa's chart cases spiking way up, reflected (yet) death rates.  Lmfao, I'm Croatian, family fled Yugoslavian war, went Germany, Germany came USA. fake?

I bet still salty World Cup loss ya

Edit never said Europe country It‚Äôs make point I‚Äôd rather anywhere ‚Äòhere‚Äô... America lol. 

Starting believe we‚Äôre stupid. Even myself.  Well, even matter anymore? There's large gathering people everyday weeks now. next even wearing masks. say goodbye old people people cancer breathing problems. Thank asking. 

I broke foot here, NHS fucking amazing despite underfunded decade. wonder much less tax would pay back home, much health insurance would pay.

Wouldn't change tho. National healthcare works cost effective. agree, fall winter around corner, lets talk next spring. course hope. everything shut vaccine found sensible plan. simply know find one.

What need lock bring numbers level contact tracing feasible solution use contain virus low numbers.  Correct, much way can't 100% trust people church tell haven't. what's called ""epi linking"" cases assume case infected based symptoms timing. know case came from, indicator too. However, important note, asking closed ended form help like (they easily lie say too) many studies show would make likely lie. generally based experience/research STDs, process pretty much they're us lead we're ones experience disease tracking prevention like this. 

There many tactics use elicit contact information lot training goes it. short, there's two ask, closed open ended. evidence studies far show get lies far likely closed ended questions. Personally, feel neither method working well using computers track cell phone data handle contact tracing. is, quite frankly, much us. team like 5 6 people one city STDs we've spread across state help numbers much manpower. honestly, absolute scariest part is... I'm normal job right now... one STDs.. people going suddenly stop sex pandemic. now, department instructed handle syphilis cases pregnant women partners. numbers new syphilis cases starting look scary one taking care now. pandemic going lead many pandemics busy this. Sorry tangent. else wants life go back normal fucks sakes think miss-spelled overreported. 

Huh? figure? Almost nobody media focusing long-term health problems people having. death rates recoveries nuance. Ribbed, pleasure Germany Saturday nobody wearing mask Monday everyone became mandatory (without fines). done television optics. Note goebbels: don‚Äôt let people bring cell phones cameras. understand word ""symptom"" means doctor:

 

A symptom something subjectively perceived patient. headache symptom. sign something objectively measured. So, high blood pressure sign.

Asymptomatic meas patient ""feel"" different normal, even signs actually unwell. reason doctors talk asymptomatic patients usually symptoms cause patients seek medical attention, much less likely diagnosed symptomatic patients.

Being asymptomatic mean can't harmed disease. mean, there's becoming lazy preventative measures, there's making political point actively fight measures like US doing. won‚Äôt. many people get multiple DUIs? Unless it‚Äôs mandate, won‚Äôt get people see light. helps know avoid person ""close enough"" mentality irritates. countries history begs differ, lmao.  like people arguing without even asking chose UK.

Small things like Lack respect parks sidewalks distancing, people coming pet dog part without asking, ect don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going get worse places legally congregate close quarters.

With stuff opens comes social responsibility, less. That‚Äôs troubling part. It‚Äôs lack critical thinking, it‚Äôs people different priorities. Protesting high risk, also high reward. little hard keep watching people like president America say blah blah blah bullshit bullshit bullshit, people like well Americans give shit keep saying scam maybe is?? Flipping ridiculous, horribly selfish. said going stop slow data they'll ""less"" ""numbers"" ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è lmao would news said ""chances success low"".

My husband works cardiac surgery, 80% caseload deferred beginning pandemic, ""elective"" cases. close 100% cases covered insurance. Germany also set number states bound together federal government?

And also coordinated responses doesnt mean exactly response everywhere  Sweden tho... read article, know answer money interruptions treatment delivery (e.g. mosquito nets malaria).

Disgusting. US large divided. Europe many different countries... seems like something lining well here.

Maybe reason US divided... also problem wandering residents - probably biggest issue matter many degrees separation PPE give staff. confused Bill gunna wander Edna's room 3 doors away 4am, there's nothing do. would seem comes HVAC systems moment.

Also, live AZ friend nutritionist chain hospitals around state. says hospitals packed (I'm sure ones not, still). odd Denmark well despite seeming taking many measures. I'm Dane living Canada ten years parents confirm saying - one wears masks.

I'm rural area 1 corona dead (93 year old) 93,000 people county. still wear mask every time I'm store. Seems like responsible thing here, feeling help much look countries like Denmark...

Not sure think this... Maybe pride whole problem. Every time somebody 3 functioning brain cells tries create lasting change get told fuck ""un-american"". 

Pride comes fall. I'm 27, moved US UK year half ago. Things bit better part we're 'US Europe.' Boris blubbering idiot virus deaths high. least worry getting tear gassed peacefully protesting though mean think takes project droplets even aerosolized virus look people walk people seated eating seems like risk. 

Add wind sunlight hitting aerosolized particles risk goes even lower. 

Like I'm sitting sidewalk eating walks breathing normally I'd say risk incredibly low. 

Now shouting me, coughing/ sneezing general direction within 6 feet I'd say risk higher.

But population good distancing dicks coughing people enjoying thier dinner sidewalk think fine. 

Id bet 99% time person town walks people eating sidewalk look straight ahead, breathe thier nose, probably even talk. That's passing people sidewalk. nod keep walking. 

So I'm spreading thing think respectful behavior extremely low risk. Probably, currently incompetent moron running executive branch such, Federal departments handicapped. Ahh Texas.

Here Washington state we've visited ER several times nasty immediate immediate stuff like possible appendicitis, cellulitis ( fever, redness, though might flesh eatting bacteria ) etc. Possible whooping cough. 

And weirdly enough seem extra charge vs immediate clinic, walk in, etc. bills 'American Expensive' stupid expensive.

I think Texas hospitals price gouge valid vaccine yes, vaccine taking away distance requirement = bad news.

btw predict replicated American schools is, clear, extremely bad advice. dexamethasone steroid, tones immune system hurt overreacting serious covid19 cases. could dangerous early cases need immune system respond quickly effectively. That‚Äôs virus hoax!

I‚Äôm talking theory, general? immunity, mean regarding reopening? think know answer, hence reluctance respond. It‚Äôs ultimate Catch-22 isn‚Äôt it? us sweden took similar approaches first, chose herd immunity. believe sweden switched tunes though careful talk ""spikes"". Increased testing going lead new positives. 

Anyone goes hospital going tested virus. ER vist? COVID test. Scheduled inpatient surgery? COVID test. employers requring testing condition return work. there's contact tracing. 

But people, like D.L. Hughley, could sick all. 


And seem know asymptomatic people contagious. First are, day we're told aren't, are. 

Sick people matters. I‚Äôm coming conclusion might better reopening, infection rates increase point concern particular state‚Äôs hospitals overwhelmed shut state again. don‚Äôt think another actual closure nationally. People won‚Äôt go it.

In addition, laws won‚Äôt allow it: can‚Äôt force people allow tracking contact tracing, don‚Äôt force people wear masks (loophole medical conditions customer doesn‚Äôt prove), wear masks don‚Äôt correctly (protip: you‚Äôre nose mask, you‚Äôre helping one).

Soon many mention 'I can't breathe' hospital beds. Shame non-mask believers. Natural selection. weakest already died. right New York City mostly careful, start relax, density still going there. avoid 2nd wave? Yes, sure, everybody keeps guard up, hopefully will. things start slip, slip fast. Exponential growth likes crowd. death sentence move New York, risky riding smaller city town. Well expect? social safety net obliberated Probably???

Great, thanks opinion. Multiple reasons: Short routes wear wanting take meantime (masks touched) driving alone.  Moderna starts Phase 3 trial within 2-3 weeks. yes it‚Äôs possible approved vaccine January. Thank god Yeah actually locked tested something Trump minions refused do. yeah, completely locked seven weeks. Completely. time, could go grocery store pharmacy within 0.5km home 18. it. left house week get groceries two blocks away. Everyone wore masks gloves point, people allowed inside time, even larger stores maximum number people low.

After seven weeks, region went three phases, minimum two weeks each, restrictions lifted slowly based meeting certain criteria. First phases still pretty strict, could basically exercise certain times day go walk, it. Restaurants started opening 3-4 weeks ago.

Today end state alarm, regions ""new normal"" foreseeable future. Social distancing mandatory masks indoors transit, limited capacity still indoor restaurants, festivals, concerts, etc. Mean Mexico people taking page Floridans claim everything alright trucks filling bodybags hope like - people do! didn‚Äôt realize curbside :) Source? measures work see sense nothing happened... police literally built fence around building, lot people live check people, quarantine leave. quite folks north AC wear masks, even store owners 70s selling masks wear one themselves. Jared buddies getting plans ready thieve PPE testing supplies? getting downvoted article specifically says infected use restroom. actual article: ""Cameras premises show infected contact washrooms elsewhere could led transmission virus."" walmart, expectations set high agree this. Masks nice, top social distancing, big events held, working home, self quarantaining sick etc. Masks dont really much still go huge gatherings. Netherlands managed reduce spread without masks too. still going really well people keeping distance. second wave still something fear, masks biggest way prevent it. extent preparations made pandemic, none preparations coming federal level. really claiming start something, I'm holding breath. Problem threads turn degenerate whining infests r/politics Reddit. People whine thousands comments politicians bad purely political nonsense absolutely zero coronavirus.

Be honest yourself, many people talking Covid19 threads? one. frustrated americans hate leadership whining. gets locked. they've conditioned see everything touches muh freedom way slippery slope. think agree wear mask one day, it'll FEMA camp next week (or whatever weird conspiracy theory scaring right now, always something). No, don‚Äôt facts, evidence. like people don‚Äôt walk around saying stuff evidence.

Youre defending saying something say right back you. accept made dumb comment move on, it. really. wear long still detectable given normal masks. Also normal rules applies driver can't recognized speeding camera pictures etc.

At least according ADAC. 50k? Surprised. hit 100k two weeks. Nice job (sarcasm). half people act like it‚Äôs big deal, ruin efforts half actually trying contain it

I remember seeing simulation **1/6** people ignore precautions, efforts others insufficient stem pandemic (get R0 1). University Flordia's fall dorm move date August 20th!

Spain country willing flu devastation, thus flu named it. Nothing US. Absolutely nothing. told would math assume would international land travel Australia, via boat plane? mean think would stupid argument since international land travel within US probably much less problem plane, reasons done much worse everywhere else nothing international travel anyway. sounds like shit people would say. think we'll see actual rate / next couple months; people acted like 'staged reopening' means 'ding dong corona's dead' running around maskless, parties, generally things want people to, virus riding mist people's breath propagate. meanwhile, I'm going keep staying indoors much possible wear p100 respirator (Bought year corona) go out. Rural areas seem think immune

To fair, live near people, nothing ""feel"" like anything late. Earth King invited /r/LakeLaogai second wave. drop cases May due imposed shut-downs. relaxation rules causing current increase. virus never let up. stuck choosing extra cautious?  workers go home expose families?

They tend live shared accommodations factory workers, way many small apartments. families typically Germany. would cost much live here. 
 workers go shopping work days expose shoppers?

Days off? Around here, they've wearing masks go shopping. have. can't go grocery store without one. they're personal quarantine, food delivered them. companies work fucked too. 
 workers' families go expose others?

The workers families still Romania Bulgaria. 
 1000+ workers infected, must significant time original infectees infect family/friends/neighbors/strangers...

Not really, eat, sleep, work, particularly time year high demand meat grilled good weather. Many men working 12 14 hours per day, 6 days per week also completely illegal.

There news report couple days ago company management even address 1/3rd employees, means workers probably registered Germany, probably registered health insurance, probably paying taxes, probably paying pensions social funds. Employers also pay funds, based employee contributions.

Managing directors meat packing companies probably facing huge fines, even jail time. Well, looks like modest, like Remdesivir, means USA already drug, keen: (The discussion seems informed) Great!! need one pharmaceutical firms find cure lying like one 4 dozen others far. File ""Good News"" call day. Surely time ploy gain exposure. I've noticed line perfectly every day end result work out

It's almost like cases get backdated even aggregate sites  like blood sweat Amazon, real blood. surprising too. guess saving grace people actually infected low simply must risk contagion anymore. People still wear fucking masks though point I'll die. care anymore, part one else does. fuck fuck closed general tourism. everyone‚Äôs focus number new cases? Confirmation total cases means virus less deadly originally thought. makes denominator case fatality rate (CFR) calculation bigger.

Our focus fatality rate. cases means fatality rate continues decrease. That‚Äôs good thing. Yall. American here, living South.

It insane. Every day curious mixture sadness, confusion, rage. Somehow, COVID turned partisan issue. Somehow wearing mask wearing mask turned political statement. friend mine aggressively cornered berated guy church wearing mask services. husband went church, one two families (in moderate sized church) bothered wear masks. INSANE, seriously worried future healthcare system.

I want go somewhere people rational. I‚Äôm sure best place family anymore, hurts say almost everyone know love here. I'm sure either, thought was. think realize vast majority transmission happens people already US. mean vaccine help hurt? I'm jealous, wish Japan would this. lot people taking masks reopened think ""over"" stroll right wearing mask wash hands disinfect accordingly. want accept science that's them. war attrition point want play one arm tied behind back, well that's them.

What's 'double ivy'? ok go socialize. ot worst way possible going crowded parties. understand person spoke risk reward?

The fact understand going risk-reward decision means they‚Äôre logical.

Not everyone risks peoples‚Äô appetites much risk accept varies. yet one would turned away wearing one, keep spreading misinformation.

This sub become nothing politics hate matter impossible need microshowers Huh? entire world's still reeling pandemic, economically. report numbers weekends, deaths get reported monday-wednesday next week. Usually offset one additional day via reporting delay.

Colorado data [listed day well reported day, allows compare discrepancies.  everywhere trying make data visible every possible way, probably would lot better containment. Depends Whole Foods. South liberal conspiracy wearing mask sign fear. Went Whole Foods like maybe 20-30% wearing one. third largest country world explain cases tests. Worldometer ranks USA 26th place respect # tests per million people Bullshit. 32,218 new cases reported June 19th alone, 0.0097859%. Go new cases day, show data day-by-day. 

But single day‚Äôs new cases represent total number actual work cases, virus active day. 

Pensacola news journal 1,513,135 active cases.  0.4588424% population. come run world? LOL. wrong, know person they're responding medical professional? say literally anything online back anecdote - make true. 

If read something different actually sources, there's reason *not* say engage conversation - information found wrong, that's good know. not, interesting discussion. 

Like, right fairly useless links provided. kind hate idea can't question shit read comment person posting claims sort medical professional. tell I'm nurse 39 years agree /u/veganpizza69 first medical professional, happens then?

You always research, aside. Doctors experts, yes, learning much issues impacting possible irresponsible. infallible gods. it‚Äôs regrettable people felt need protest pandemic number environmental differences **do impact** viral transmission outdoors vs indoors sunlight, heat, humidity, wind. 350k? said that? source? ive seen people [Rusted Root Yeah. attribute lot towards fact working-class area still lot people working places like grocery stores, manual labor, shops, etc lot still ride buses, require masks. people work home 3 million house get fresh food delivered? think shocked irritated inconvenienced usually don‚Äôt deal sorts things. Wear mask stay away everyone.  Since US absolutely nothing prevent numbers going up, find hard believe  Social distancing way effective masks good idea social distancing option (for example hospital work, public transport etc.). sounds bit like dictatorship tho? sheriff elected county. sort system propose one person gets eject office filled vote citizens? slap booty. outdoors definitely helps prevent spread. Educate yourself. didn‚Äôt really work Sweden. hope vaccine soon seems obvious. age range new infections occurring shifted downward time, measured IFR CFR decrease timt. Yeah that's definitely happened! Haha. bad! open strategy seems somewhat softened blow economy, growth shrinking much less Denmark Norway first quarter.

Was paragraph based initial press release actually contracted, based second press release went back adjusted figures 2019 seemed like actually small amount growth?

Here first press release May Sweden‚Äôs GDP decreased 0.3 percent first quarter 2020, seasonally adjusted compared fourth quarter 2019. 

 

Here second press release May GDP increased 0.1 percent first quarter 2020, seasonally adjusted compared fourth quarter 2019. 

And pulled magic trick (from near bottom Non-adjusted GDP growth revised compared publication fourth quarter 2019 February. first quarter 2019 revised upwards 0.4 percentage points, second quarter revised upwards 0.1 percentage points, third quarter revised downwards 0.2 percentage points fourth quarter revised downwards 0.3 percentage points. GDP full year 2019 remains unchanged. 

 

See there? left GDP entire year unchanged, adjusted first half year upwards, second half year downwards 0.3% decline turned 0.1% increase.

Genius.

It seems fiddling COVID numbers, they're fiddling economic numbers too. wrong, answer clear cut. Researchers never found single answer explain variability H1N1 InfA (Spanish Flu) responses. multiple waves would go severe mild severe, vice versa. Researchers assume partial herd immunity H1N1 InfA played role, still explain variability Waves said earlier.

Source: fact thousands protesting without masks everyone freaking spreading virus. course came headline ""72 got COVID-19 large event."" ELI5... increase part wave first round? Like slower wave hit first waves hit washington, cali New York? wave another go round. florida went finding 4 percent people positive finding 12 percent positive. would actually need try though find information.

i help need it.  think this? noted New England outbreak massive masked states trends. least Texans still freedom!! That‚Äôs reopened early right?? middle class Central Florida community balking restrictions since lifted end April. Parents hosting play dates parties we‚Äôre weird ones attending. Mask usage extremely low. Parents can‚Äôt wait send kids back school August-most households stay-at-home moms, it‚Äôs even practical issue many cases. It‚Äôs depressing. watched documentary Wuhan BBC reporting.. honestly scary, virus measures taken. didn‚Äôt show 
ANY footage hospitals.

They megaphones playing voice essentially saying, lie symptoms aren‚Äôt responsible face jail time.. know who‚Äôs lying not? would allow one person household apartment complex‚Äôs city per day essentials only. guard monitoring this. people literally choice.
If suspected covid symptoms authorities determined couldn‚Äôt quarantine home without spreading family could remove put temporary ‚Äúaccommodation‚Äù.

How much willing sacrifice this? Everything ? say Typhoid Trump better, article China. Wow. care usa... really are... less intelligent. Moaning trump rally social distancing entire country full riotsüòÇ social distancing there? ban inc 3...2...1... cause ofc üòÜü§°üåé that‚Äôs small part it!

That said, saw (on Twitter think?), there‚Äôs board outside Amount Coronavirus deaths Trump responsible ~70000. even approximate that? anyone else concerned Covid Cases reported ""new"" actually ""old cases newly reported.""???

The data super dirty / mostly useless, used state &amp; local governments trends decision making?

i.e. CDC mixing (PCR + Serology). 

As Data Analyst I'd throw out, seems we're consuming like somehow useful. would focus Hospitalizations don‚Äôt need talk that. Strap people, ride. India low death rate high recovery rate compared countries? scariest part entire shit, agree. It‚Äôs annoying one mentions this. end year many recovered report feeling recurring shortness breath chest pains etc. Ever heard false positives? would lovely Since numbskull population seems know better wear mask, let's wait couple weeks see number surpass 40,000...

Do WANT locals deficient vitamin D, social health, general physical health die inevitably get COVID?? thinking profound bad way. information coming spread limited outdoors already, think people shouldn‚Äôt go beach?   

Next lets ban everybody hiking mountains Colorado! Let‚Äôs ban people outdoor recreation EVERYWHERE! Seriously. end? want read something scary, check out: seeming likely significant number people long term health complications acute stage virus. need rethink recovery means virus people thinking they‚Äôll bounce back perfect health causing far many people blow off. days ago also article sub detailing even many mild asymptomatic cases appears permanent lung damage. feel bad people uninformed inevitably catch caught guard effects. I‚Äôve seen suggested may generation‚Äôs polio... underlying problem failed spot way decide rate mutation particular virus described ""rapid"" ""slow"" unless definitions standards established ""slow"", ""medium"", ""rapid"" mutation rate.

In words, earlier new studies could consistent except mean different things ""rapid mutation rate"". Australia Sheriff elected position county level.

The implicit deal electing enforcer laws locally, locals get local discretion it‚Äôs handled.

The way, outside criminal corruption, fire sheriff vote different one. great news. asking cases attended protest? contract tracers following local testing facilities protest sites? addition, noticing younger demographics mainly elderly?

The way theyd shut someone died think I'm NL 23 ¬∞C today.  much us greatest world, huh? Just...sad. agree purposely concocted shitty situation good answers.

It's average situation.

It could woman 3 children suddenly deal father declining physically mentally, home built facilities needs (ie: bath, washroom, small wheelchairs). prioritise children? give whatever work might do? completely upend home, move another, 'elderly' friendly home? afford this?

Or two late-middle aged children suddenly finding 93-year old parent needs full-time support. older children entering retirement themselves. want become effectively full-time carers? parent may well heavy require lot lifting. Would okay completely destroy backs trying shift mum dad around without proper equipment (know average house hold hoist?)

Sometimes ailing parent *refuse* leave home. kids move in? EU tests, check numbers worldometers. cannot disagree more, work outlet centre people waiting lines go stores really keeping 1.5 distance.

What u say strict regulations complete fantasy!!

No one checking rules given rivm correcting people bad behaviour guidelines.

1) shop mostly alone; people always groups 4 8 people impossibly household
2) desinfecting hands regularly really joke,people desinfect immediatly clean hands jeans sweater rendering useless simply refusing desinfect all
3) try touch less possible ask employee show items; people touchinge fitting clothes/ shoes hundreds touching face

U go wil ranting, short: netherlands covid spread less acceptable NOTHING regulations sheer luck climate 99% allready infected immune ( im virologist )

Now stop making laugh strict regulations pipe dream [The main - Jfc.

I really hoping India would fare better.

Ignoring migrant working conditions get us every time. That‚Äôs fair enough parents elders caring home? likely yes. However without two party system people opposite sides political spectrum agree things. Second* seems masks differentiating factor. spikes California happening places mask compliance abysmal (Orange County, SLO). numbers Bay Area haven‚Äôt gotten hand counties mask mandates like one Newsom put place entire state. plenty protests well. New York didn‚Äôt flatten curve overwhelmed hospitals result. Florida SunBelt states continue manageable epidemic, one appear worse New York, chaos unpreparedness ‚Äî steep peak ‚Äî wiped lot people beginning. Let‚Äôs remember flattening curve really about: preventing NY Lombardy. Read: ""the US great money"" think that's case. China telling people get infected washing meat fish. Something splash created water drops meat. US MEAT, say meat. people begin sentences ""the governor..."" complain. Nonsensical describes perfectly I've got meat please Trumps political rally. Calling virus hoax. Encouraging folk back work. Knowing it‚Äôs dangerous. 
Then getting fuckwit flag waving Fuck Trumpets sign waiver rally. Really ? fuck wrong brain? Meanwhile, Florida breached 4,000 cases per day continues climb higher. literally live across street theme park opened back (I'm Florida resident)...and neighbors waved bye morning left week long road trip within state. - New cases tests administered 1-7 days ago: +2,409 (92.9%)

Current peak 2,729 last Monday manually tracked data ""Confirmed Cases Day"" tab AZDHS site. Graphs second tab.

I added trend graph PCR positivity third tab. **We gone 5% positive cases month ago around 17% now**. Both! options choose from? Vaccine, herd immunity, ... death epidemic? resolve health issues, researchers Columbia University Center Radiological Research (CRR) developed far-UVC light. wavelength approximately 220nm, far-UVC light cannot penetrate eyes dead cells surface skin. can, however, penetrate kill viruses air.

Couple ways go that. close proximity people know would easiest call positive patient ask information everyone around, anyways every positive, notify people contact positive case need quarantine. Another, much complicated method would ask business share records knew there. can't force though thats part problem. people want give us info can't really legally make them. that's definitely part going well country. Sweden hasn‚Äôt, much worse US. died deaths labeled pneumonia chinese pledged share vaccine world. Sharing way make vaccine also takes nothing away fast chinese vaccinate population mandatory Paris since long time see 99% people respecting it. Outside public transportation, street like 20%. good see people respecting transports shops requiring it. Norwegians already able go Gotland, Sweden holiday, think dream total control already. thought media hyping everyone scared stay indoors forever.

Which it! problem seem virus, people's autoimmune response virus real, would able see talk it. That's obviously political trick. invisible thing kills people? Foolishness. let see Bible says this...

/sarcasm still remember goal ""flatten curve.""

Yeah Florida gave there. ignored goal posts went right ahead reopening half hearted effort. someone recommend ""more effective"" cloth masks sale online? Many ones see t-shirt material, less effective quilting material, correct? masks mom made want more. need ones kids, too. Guarantee China foresight stockpile whatever need deploy vaccine. US capable that. we? Surpassed 50,000 Finland Nordic countries got decent number imported initial cases North Italy Austria skiing holidays February. Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland used various combinations social distancing test/trace policies first wave over. Sweden another story. considered 3-4 days ahead Finland March.. Fair game work/sick thing.
I made experience last workplace. Mostly people 50. Since work way younger company mindset completely way around. start get progress better. still something exists.

Thank fair discussion! That's people step take precautions voluntarily. didn't. enough anyway. I'm sure related COVID-19. see massive spikes. 

Let's see month two massive spikes whatsoever. Well matter factnis West hit much harder China epicenter disease video informative captured key moments past months. interesting mindset US pandemic. breaks ""well can't that"" lead now.

South Korea, Taiwan - cultures different ""individualistic"".

New Zealand, Australia - that's small island country course contain virus.

Italy, Spain, France - .... noticed last days people 30 much mask wearing anymore.
But law clear: mandatory masks closed areas open areas enforce least one meter distance.

So worrying following rules. Thousands? Hmmmm let‚Äôs wait see. think number may low. Trump doesn‚Äôt care people, cares himself. Let‚Äôs see happens next months election. 


Ps- SOMEBODY PLEASE ASSASSINATE DONALD J TRUMP. ASKING SOMEONE ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT UNJTWD STATES know good news everyone France since we'll see happens Plantation owner still believes power keep darkies check. So?

Oh wait that's stupid fucking idea Yes, might little overestimating european wisdom (we crazies esp European Union target people wackos survivalist free citizens), fact main parties cant agree color sky impressive ! Gulf Shores, AL packed tourists US, one wearing mask, local restaurants open back capacity. fucks given gulf coast local worried hurricane season, see summer 2020 excruciating. Sure, doesn‚Äôt mean people aren‚Äôt going live past 60 anymore. Let‚Äôs reasonable. vast majority people either mild asymptomatic infection, long-term organ damage unlikely.

And ppl bought it... know  Hell no..

Maybe US measures might possible, country masks, unless public transport virus well control 

Masks bring nothing extra table, unless relax rules (we told keep distance, stay home sick, many people enclosed areas), wear masks unneccesary thing, let alone fines wearing one. say outside filtered atmosphere. high drunk going down.

And nice Grandpa Romania deaths could pushed later year lockdown pushed. pushed later, less people would die.

I wonder...

We know Swedish denying treatment elderly patients, instead simply offering ""palliative care"" ease suffering die.

Even pushed virus back treatment available.... would actually offered treatment majority people died? grandad died Xmas pneumonia, went bed looking forward getting home Xmas dead 3 days. convinced COVID19 drilled head goal flatten curve. urge US looks pretty flat me, someone explain I'm wrong? Testing really low Delhi earlier though. Went sainsbury's week ago staff even wearing anything anymore 10% customers masks I‚Äôm proud it? say that?I‚Äôm surprised largest, populous countries aren‚Äôt well pandemic! one first countries get it, yes made mistakes fixed it.

American excuse. saw coming denied it. Somehow became political issue people take offense people wearing masks.

It's fine. like widespread economic stagnation inability break generational poverty tiny group elites prosper ever led situation populist demagogues able rile people drag planet one level hell another. Exactly. added bit onto [compilation Swedish officials Tegnell Giesecke admitting herd immunity last night finding tidbit:

Quite interesting timing there. advice keep wearing masks live states gonna see death rate rise next years every flu season sure till cure comes ever Dude, Brazilians poor. paid almost 10k BRL moving US job pays slightly better minimum wage better life (and better car) Brazil.

I work essential job utility company largely work outside. weather started getting nicer area (early April. Still lockdown), would see hundreds people walking around (I stopped counting 350 2PM), playing basketball, picnics close proximity groups; masks anyone. grocery store place saw majority people wearing masks.

People largely never changed behavior outside working home kids home due school closure. see restaurants *packed* outdoor patios masks all. behavior seeing still safe lots Americans doing, even 2 months ago. right, clarify. Houston Austin great I've several times, I'm sure cities well. outside areas worst, poverty stricken areas country. world rural areas hit hard? Remove New York City New Jersey numbers sudden look hell lot better. Big cities driving spread. Yeah. Students head exams wearing gloves masks literally every year.

Wait, what? Boycott products. think want people end lives due hopelessness. Swedish people don‚Äôt culture rebellion resentment attempts influence behavior.

For lot Americans, telling someone something it‚Äôs best interests makes *less* likely want prove don‚Äôt need help everything themselves.

[Incidentally, antibody Japan says 'Boy guys slow stupid'. think Japan's numbers counting, still shows everyone uses maks infection rate significantly lower. First sentence, ok good question

Second sentence, fuck off. lot people died Covid-19 symptoms, never tested, get added official statistics. especially case nursing homes. Hundreds thousands. Let's remember, we've 120K deaths yet experts guess we're maybe 5% infection rate nationwide. Even manage cut ratio half we'll still close 500,000 dead time make 40% infection rate, last guess saw we'd need closer 60% 80% herd immunity test /s happens leader* country calls hoax best divide country solution.  show one deaths new cases Yeah make sure cook meat least 140 degrees, almost every type meat 160+ can't get infected, besides covid19 viral bacterial. safe side Die F√ºhrer... I've seen multiple studies place number asymptomatic cases multiple alarmingly high albeit different projections.

And we've seen enough studies know asymptomatic transmission occurs. Asymptomatic people infect others although degree remains disrupted. 

This always dumb every state's reopen plan ignore asymptomatic people. China repeatedly told countries that, order save lives, isolate asymptomatic infections. Originally, gently encouraged people self isolate enough compliance rate mandate it.

Other countries OK deaths China found low compliance rate sufficient.

I also think time adopt new distinction asymptomatic cases people interpreting asymptomatic mean disease free longer know that's factually correct.

Edit: works Boston. Ridiculous US even chart consider population densities. People completely ignore looking per capita data, it‚Äôs disingenuous. like, 4 weeks late? True. matter course action taken, moral principles going compromised. situation US, decision made would potentially save lives. 

I know elective procedures able save lives. There‚Äôs debate there. Hospitals make make large portion profit elective procedures really don‚Äôt want stop unless absolutely necessary. Healthcare systems need re-allocate resources areas novel virus ability rapidly escalate seen New York City, Italy, Spain. Surgeon General recommended elective procedures stop national emergency.

The patients receiving procedures also putting doctors risk exposure thus compounding issue stated above. infected doctor ability super spreader people least able fight disease.

And I‚Äôm saying Covid cause bodily damage without symptoms also affect heart. haven‚Äôt seen data says heart can‚Äôt damaged asymptotic patients. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs possible. long know whether prediction right wrong? Answer: aggressive, medicate stupor cannot move.

Full stop there. aggressive patient uncle former nursing home.  Well, hand, started lockdown earlier. They're coming little bit. Scotland's okay.  Edgy comment bro.  ""mysterious"", really? Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt lose pandemics, wins them. quits them, unfair. Look Hong Kong almost zero social distancing, shutdown, WFH everyone wears masks. Denmark 23% less population 10 times cases. It‚Äôs opposite, masks important, ‚Äúother factors‚Äù listed almost never widespread lot places Asia

Other examples: South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam. Agreed OP likely focusing people wear properly, chin yeah going help. number probably lower though realize (we overestimate we're looking something).

For great technical thread convexity applied situation: I'm wrong, parents Denmark free send kids class many did. I'm looking number kids single middle school even every day half kids probably make one kid per seat buses. think great idea, again, child's grade school could easily, bigger schools struggle probably able make work. Never mind overall shortages buses drivers area.

Sports non starter. Let's give year move on. Gym class well unless outside. need screaming shouting heavy breathing enclosed environment. dexamethasone approved treatment safe say Sweden's policy complete utter failure. deaths could pushed later year lockdown pushed. pushed later, less people would die. That's fact based effectiveness dexamethasone. Sweden really fucked people similar way US Brazil. one world want open borders countries. reap sow. still bad America, incompetent lockdown properly destroyed economy barely keeping cases rising temporarily. someone working co-op throughout lockdown period, that's true.

Also stats seem confirm experiences...

57% people surveyed (1st June - 7th June) said never wear mask, 43% say (rarely, sometimes, frequently always). quite 50/50 close. Either way, far ""almost read, 'salaries us higher' first crest new cases April happened ~20 days shit got real places started issuing shelter place orders. first crest daily deaths occurred 17 days first crest new cases ~40 days shelter place orders issued. think part video show bad virus also exposing 'legal' system China looks like, people pulling van dragging inside, perhaps never seen anyone outside 'system' again. flood gates, open cautiously weeks observation, like Denmark did. mean places locked down. Times Square New York empty weeks. Even places like Atlanta empty, seemingly back normal one gives fuck more. Yes, LA, why? No, saying happening now. Pull head ass UK id say 10-15% people wearing masks. Mostly older people. seen anybody 30 wearing one. agree critical thinking gone window. 

Although add state atleast top epidemiologist famous university known medicine came tv said ""blm important covid"" ""protesters minimal risk contracting covid completely disregarding fear instilled us. 

Yes right critical thinking gone also help proffesionals lie. honestly assure time able get oximeter, already know corona not. going help likely become source anxiety buy one. diagnostic device detect corona.

Wew Nah, mortality rate 0.26% would crazy react like it‚Äôs Ebola it‚Äôs nowhere near bad . Thanks, thought so. Knowing this, feel safe way proceed school reopening. Kids take masks eat, heard rumor kids taking breaks wearing masks- disease spread taking break. Maybe countries able keep pandemic kind control open, areas infected open schools, certainly communities spread running unabated. *should* be. Yep, confirm. I‚Äôm Melbourne, last week we‚Äôve seen ‚Äúspike‚Äù community transmission cases, 10 day total. People freaking like it‚Äôs end world. look whatever hell going America I‚Äôm like damn glad here..  can‚Äôt get whack mole situation without vaccine may years found all.

Well, least there's hope vaccine front. Though we'll wait see effective really are. It‚Äôs absolutely shocking people countries see what‚Äôs happening US think they‚Äôre exempt that, like virus somehow spare likes Europeans better? Well shit There's also denial. *I* go home. Around Christmas workplace sounded like plague hospital library. remember distinctly. whatever co-workers (and must asymptomatically) seem last long COVID, people even hospitalized despite lot elderly workers. seem like bad enough COVID, either. week sick people. Holy shit, spot on. I'm sure knows point return already passed. least surge. Even every single floridian holed houses starting today, new case surge continue accelerate regardless here. moved four years ago glad did. Netherlands

The Netherlands strange one pin down. Dutch friend loves friendly English people - varies massively country. value check North West England, Scotland Wales. Ireland - talk agree lovely! time countless immigrants upwardly mobile people would confirm US really land opportunity

The USA fairly middle road comes social mobility, Lithuania Estonia rank higher. certainly compares well developing world OECD countries, bottom good üòê you‚Äôd hope people would see it‚Äôs going places like Florida act accordingly apparently that‚Äôs case. sorry hear that, stay safe there! honestly couldn‚Äôt pay enough *any* crowded area right world going divided, countries virus control, countries not. never twain shall meet. lies lack critical thinking taking place. When's next vaccine update suppose be? thought read something mid june would results phase 2 chadox vaccine. \*Most US

Some States actually really good job suppressing virus. Examples want (A little eh side (Also little ( state :) (Still suppressing sign large spike) \- exemplary state really well suppressing virus despite initial catastrophe

[North More, tired. countless immigrants upwardly mobile people would confirm US really land opportunity

We actually count them, number years ago net migration Mexico zero below. 

Wages stagnated since 70's, Gen X Millenials first generations poorer parents.

I left US take opportunity paid off, speaking ""ex-pat"" community harder ever. I'd really think twice said lived opposite heard many stories. believed too, experience changed me. xd Maybe seatbelt saved car wreck two years ago, way go without now. left's massive protests directly responsible numbers. reason can‚Äôt open live Athens, Greece. People told thought another conspiracy theory laughed wearing mask. Would someone kind enough give synopsis. even clue many people it, let alone many recovered. Holland using ostrich approach. I'm interested defending wet markets. I'm interested pointing lies, either caused ignorance intentional. link directly contradicts claims. I'm well aware came animal. know exact source current outbreak coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), know originally came animal source. think country (Austria) see large spikes fall. 50ish new cases per day, population 8m. Contact tracing working, tourism health care workers tested thoroughly. Social distancing reduced multiple steps 6 weeks now, numbers stable. Come fall, change, people meeting inside regular seasonal flu, might get mandatory masks remote work again, moment, I'd say fone country be, especially one island. flattening curve landing spot healthcare isn‚Äôt overwhelmed far they‚Äôre successful.

The goal keeping many people possible needing healthcare first place. It‚Äôs big cultural shift that‚Äôs decades making. another note, link sucked. click find article video. video starts playing ad first too. Fuck that. Come Ireland. Nobody wears masks. Sorry know something everyone else doesn't? 100% 3 major vaccines developed antibodies nobody trails developed got cornoavirus. 2 negative news stories I've even seen, one blasted monkey insane amount coronovirus directly lungs monkey got cold like symptoms, one stage 2 trails guy got bad fever getting vaccine. like sitting roof house steady rising flood neighbor, roof, yells ""Don't worry first wave over!""

Meanwhile town leader decided stop measuring water level water rising. Absolutely. frustrating part vague symptoms really ""cold flu symptoms"" know since virus affects people many different ways. Like weeks ago, monster headache scratchy throat. symptoms covid, also history terrible migraines last week sometimes get sore throats sleep mouth open. hard know truly need cancelling appointments staying in. People could take tests home. true, worn mask Netherlands 'smart lockdown' example. either kids chills body aches? 9 year old daughter came fever 100F =/ multiple theories.

Enjoy day! american please love chocolate chip cookies help us Exactly. Two good analogies used next step: performing mental gymnastics necessary convince oneself numbers somehow prove US still Number 1^TM doubt we‚Äôll get vaccine, time soon. took 30 years get Polio vaccine, there‚Äôs vaccine HIV, vaccine SARS. People expect vaccine next year could well shock. Sounds like myself. Lived Germany months years ago loved it! Told wife move another country I'd love live Germany. Unfortunately also super idea leaving life Texas. college student, I‚Äôd take next one two semesters resume studies vaccine out.

Vaccinated December? Return Spring 2021 semester.

Vaccinated April? Return Fall 2021 semester.

I‚Äôm glad something like didn‚Äôt interfere college experience. must really suck current undergrads. went stages testing passed all. time ready released longer needed. base Moderna vaccine.  28,772 cases June 1 thru yesterday leaves 23,618 cases three weeks ago. I'd guess maybe 80% would recovered (or recovered enuf longer test positive) that's 19k recovered. graph 7 day rolling average understand low population density usually means lots empty uninhabited land people still live cities, right? can't now. chance beginning. :/ sucks US kinda blew it. Also constitution designed create shittiest nothing government possible $2 wages make like $20 hour tips easy Unfortunately think take people take seriously again. HIPAA, news rarely film inside flooded hospitals, seems lot people literally need see death way get it. That‚Äôs China Italy bigger effect, actually saw sick people body bags/coffins. lot Americans seemed understand severity saw refrigerated trucks hospital ships NY.  don‚Äôt know get bad many people take precautions again. Atleast admitted increase testing. I'd say he's reached stage 1.5 point, hopefully actually start something soon. can't google Moderna Oxford vaccine? I've lost faith CDC. administration completely marginalized, politicized, gutted world's premier infectious disease organization. They'll come kind watered milquetoast reccomendation, like: strongly recommend everyone wear masks public, however health reasons, religious reasons, heck feel like (you know can't properly color coordinate someone YT FB told too). wasn‚Äôt 100 year pandemic asymptomatic carriers. I'm confused we're hearing ventilation. 

We know outside significantly safer indoors, possible improve indoor spaces technology?

Every gym/restaurant see opening bragging they're cleaning surfaces like, ok, that's main problem here. worst part life risking. Since you‚Äôre openly lying effort focus hate one man, don‚Äôt know else say.

There zero evidence Fauci ‚Äútread‚Äù anything. He‚Äôs still employed. He‚Äôs openly disagreed President. administration‚Äôs policy cruises nothing people going cruises‚Äîcruises exist outside US. That‚Äôs ridiculous claim.

And no, ‚Äúminuscule threat‚Äù statement statement ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt going see people US walking around masks‚Äù comment cannot ignored, matter badly wish hadn‚Äôt said it.

Travel bans seemed wonders Iceland New Zealand. Please don‚Äôt act like aren‚Äôt effective‚Äîif enacted trade advisor pushing (January 15 China, February 20 Europe), would completely different position.

Trump got excellent advice respond threat. come Fauci. Trump‚Äôs response situation failure you‚Äôll never hear say otherwise. greatest failure listening wrong person. positivity rate gone significantly states. cause increased cases testing, positivity rate going would help president actually advocated even wore mask. There‚Äôs much could help prevent this, it‚Äôs frustrating he‚Äôs not. went visit family Alabama last week lunch. Everyone state wore mask one else did. cousin stop talking conspiracy. daughter works ICU nurse also refused wear mask. I'm surprised cases higher are. People pretty dumb.

It's also defense mechanism deny re-evaulate facts realize mis-informed. Less brain energy. replace word ""beach"" ""protests"", bet alot people hate article instead. Let's trade then. wish people would try *less* friendly stay indoors here. 

I trust people, small talk friendly banter uncomfortable. states US appear mostly suppressed it. - makes difference Yeah, seaside town packed today. Hoping best. would pretty naive think protests don‚Äôt huge part play this. 

People lax rules Memorial Day, almost every city protests thousands people close proximity. 

After everyone started praising going protest, week ago people weren‚Äôt able attend funerals loved ones, people weren‚Äôt going comply quarantine rules anymore. protests 100% timing awful.

Reopening fine use masks, protests definitely weren‚Äôt part plan reopening. really made things worse, unfortunately protesting one death cause thousands more. Austria. German Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung 14,6% 14,0%: Meanwhile Sweden: what‚Äôs slow? üòÇ  popup party stupider bar? apart noise pollution, course. least theyre outside! r/raisedbynarcissists I'm Arizona, son's school starts back early August. already 50,000 cases here, that's expected rise 80,000 mid-July. Recently we've seeing daily increases upwards 2500. 

My son's school K-8 around 1000 students. district yet announce reopening plans, can't see they'll able open safely all. Schools badly funded anyway, teachers often rely parent donations hand sanitizer disinfecting wipes get flu season. know teachers care kids lot, would best keep everyone safe, seems like huge undertaking. I'm hoping distance learning option I'm really comfortable sending back yet, things control here. Euthanasia. Queue Sinn F√©in lads comment went park, even though allowed so.   political decision, based assumption death urban areas among non-white populations, November Trump's base able reasonably say ""I never knew anyone got sick"". cant deny cultural sea change, important conversations considered ""political"" mainstream happening everywhere Sesame Street breakfast aisle grocery store. Amsterdam tourist back since last week. masks much social distancing doesn‚Äôt bode well... can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs unconstitutional, mention entirely impractical due sheer size country webs back roads. Officially borders closed. politicians say appear stern tough. reality borders never closed. list exceptions long anyone wants cross border without problems. Actually drug exists forms human consumption Good you, context conversation income Bolsonaro's voters. simply say everyone poor debate all. need compare incomes people inside country. truth is, country poor, poorer others. 10k BRL housekeeper anywhere country - Europeans would say rich. That's perspective. Possibly mandatory shops soon non essential shops (with outside entrance) open 29th. damn think impossible high wages adequate safety net? Hard disagree. Emergencies probably major case people going bankrupt. even then, cases it‚Äôs emergency it‚Äôs probably late. 

There also plenty examples US people getting kicked hospitals insurance refused pay uninsured. Lots hospitals bare minimum. 

Also, hospitals cost healthcare. get cancer won‚Äôt get treatment period. get COVID you‚Äôll die risk. 

No first world country allows that. Pork roll Taylor ham know....went bit 2019 early 2020...that do. ‚Äúcurrent best estimate‚Äù means nothing word ‚Äúscenario‚Äù next it? rate, many people even going left Covid infect I've started seeing friends lunch outdoors every often again. no-risk situation, course, probably safer going grocery store beneficial mental health perspective. think perfectly understandable people begun seeing friends loved ones distance, especially outdoors, again.  Northern European countries nobody wears masks. They‚Äôre fine. Pretty good even. 

I live Netherlands. masks here. Unless use public transport. R value 1 quite time we‚Äôve easing restrictions quite time ago now.

I don‚Äôt know increase weeks though. People traveling seeing people again. 

Me... distance others. I‚Äôm good that. tech already exists lot android phones (least option settings), though think widely use Canada (and assume US). 

Its good idea though. seems like pretty big infringement privacy. US terrible *don't* money plenty countries that's true. Meanwhile US........


[A Utah meat plant staying open even 287 workers got plant shut 230 workers test positive Yes new hospitalizations lag nearly much. think second peak primarily affecting less vulnerable society. Thanks link! We‚Äôve devil time finding masks don‚Äôt fog glasses cost less $25 each. ordered three, reviews definitely make seem worth wait. Say want Boris, he's still 100x competent trump. It‚Äôs getting knarly Phoenix. Lines 7 hours get tested, can‚Äôt keep up. demand skyrocketed last week. quarantine exposed active case job, go fucking rejuvenation clinic Friday get blood test covid timely manner (expensive job reimbursing). urgent cares drive thru places booked thru Sunday (today). Deaths lag, area way worse. We‚Äôre capacity. We‚Äôve never reopened. Thats massive compared potential risk covid killing families. might negative effect later elections. better others type situation make good points.

HEPA filtration open windows used ways reduce spread virus. 

It costly business owners increase outside air keep comfortable indoor environment. one, air conditioning system likely would need replaced larger one handle additional heat humidity. Also add higher level filtration (HEPA necessarily worth added cost, I'd expect MERV-13 become common) fan likely needs larger would typically used small commerical grade unit.

Increasing air velocity may actually increase mobility virus air, would result increased outside air. simply increasing amount ventilation building's air conditioning system, still keep total airflow velocity. careless? drive around car, contact anyone, things need do. visit supermarkets wear gloves masks. visit bars required. Sanitize hands getting back car, wash thoroughly getting home. careless exactly? Uh I've lived US money health issues quickly led spiral debt. waive cost, sell collection agencies pennies dollar. problem anymore. know asymptomatic pre-symptomatic. 

We knwo DeSantis says - since contact tracing really thing Florida right - yet answer young people getting testing symptoms. many 20 year olds know gonna get tested experienced symptoms yet? many Americans spoiled brats, they‚Äôve elected biggest spoiled brat world ever seen lead them. course aren‚Äôt going quarantine properly. American, many Europeans cold seems like they're offended dare speak them. Seems like like get north hit Isles people friendly fuck. shockingly different attitude anywhere I've Americas.  Scandanavian countries disagree. Huh? choosing ignore record number cases? Also 3rd week since protest started. Get ready increase licence plates for? seems little odd, since touching mask face multiple times recommend. putting removing home safest. Many models estimate US another 1.2 Million deaths said done. americans hanging out, pool parties rioting. Simple. government think fine.


My entire family putting much pressure keep studying, leave country especially tough us terrible allergies. cough runny nose itchy eyes skin year. like lepers must stayed away (and understand why.) I‚Äôm crying guys talking free healthcare here. [The actual doc based document planning scenarios. PLANNING PURPOSES watermarking every page. *not* report disease; wargaming potential scenarios. must kidding Parts are. USA quite big. [fascinating paper came (caveat - preprint) suggesting SARS-CoV-2 introduced **1,300** times UK, mostly Spain, France Italy (introductions USA China negligible).

Aviation vector - people flew country travelled within it. something facility thinking about. outbreak c.diff recently even juggling covid precautions stretching seams infectious disease protocols. imagine us handling something infectious flu many similar symptoms covid well point without major changes outside isn‚Äôt option? 

Would symptoms + masks + distance still good mix? Distance might problem first considering they‚Äôd picking always wipes sprays point hope Europe bans travel US completely, sort shit alone. one city. military base though kept pretty quiet. Yeah, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, UK... 300 million people. many lmao injected polio vaccine. No, treatment given acquiring infection. God fucking hope good studies well infection control measures, like masks work medical scientific setting. certified PPE utilized according directions, demonstrated self-protection infection control.

The issue public. Poor compliance well-understood phenomena wider public.

Saying someone protected wear mask going counter-productive someone wears cloth mask nose hanging ear (and treat thing like fomite.)

It's difficult thing study mask protectiveness among public, they're practicing normal behavior. Observing someone, itself, change behavior. Personally, China sent lot broken PPE faulty tests lot places - cannot believe anything China antidepressant consumption per capita. Work one out. say there's 2 countries life great rich? strongly disagree. There's example several northern European countries case. No. That's means. forget studies say 20% people responsible 80% cases. patient 31 exploded South Korea's outbreak.  


What's likely case virus takes seed - people regular activities likely spread lot people - however get super spreader super spreading event BAM - got huge outbreak - also time - left unchecked grows exponentially without super spreading event.  


It's ol' lilypad equation - takes 29 days half pod covered lilypads one day whole pond covered. That's virus does. Hold onto golden idea don‚Äôt let Syfy see it. allowed protest certain time.

That's honestly pretty low country 40 million people even ""murderous"". simply rational conclusion comes believing elderly already near end life delaying inevitable expensive without offering much return.

It's want people die, see benefit society general taking active measures prevent it. Swedish government operated throughout epidemic.

This chose allow infection spread general population, knowing full well would cause many deaths among elderly. elderly minority simply sacrificed unduly affect younger majority.

In ""Star Trek"" terms, ""the needs many outweigh needs few"". cold-hearted calculation, *is* rational. American quite odd see woman USA sweatshirt standing around near cars Dutch license plates...

Right now, Sweden worse. US could still top Sweden deaths/hospital admissions...but catching get there. doubt recognize anybody pictures wears mask. quality seems really bad + angles . would risk it. Gladly - cases definitely growing, severity decreased knowledge around best treatments definitely increased. 

Overall, positive trend except case count. good news, especially people still careful.

We expected wack mole situations, prepared effectively it. control, we're slowly starting schools again, etc. second wave really start, bet ass we'll close schools instead ignoring problem like US apparently is.

As someone lived Australia, I‚Äôd say cultures remarkably different. Australians work live, whereas live work. Additionally, country far left US many ways advanced. There‚Äôs reason happiest people best cities widely found Australia. And, NYC NJ politicians fair share corruption callousness towards needs constituents, part ones currently power willing let us die appease wealthy donors. hopefully impossible. like 4 contacts century, 3 ended disasters. Also need covid die- use diseases like measles, Polio etc.

Those people like proto-stone age. surreal Thank you! I‚Äôve trying ones nose wires never quite get right (had better luck pleated one setting glasses out) look like good prospect. feel like rest world would end becoming ideal place live meanwhile US still closed severe conditions tiring trying pride country.

It's not. Panicking costly economically, extra baseless anxiety lifelong consequences. Well, yeah Well see day day, guess within 43%, rarely/sometimes category. group people see consistently wear masks Chinese overseas students.

Not even people working essential service wear masks.

I guess we're done here. know cluster is. care expensive.

Good care less *profitable*. brought price good care, would still expensive poor care. People running nursing homes want increase return investment; nothing else matters. profit medicine poison. mean actual borders? Yea...we actively suppressing it. People need realize, Covid care things, covid wants spread wide possible... Absurd perfect word it. always makes laugh someone goes way 'prove' they're intimidated. intimidated, feel need posture. Look past vaccines, taken 40 years, 30 years, 9 years.

This completely different vaccine developed affects DNA. Realistically don‚Äôt see safely get vaccine fast Thats expected protest riot every week really really wish worked way. even slightest idea you‚Äôre suggesting terms county/state border control?

The sheer size it? What‚Äôs long term play here? 

There long term play. might also helpful items ... sterile. Yeah FUCKING THROW WHEREVER WANT TO! via due process

2nd amendment still law. Anyone trying take people's guns tyrant specifically ignoring due process. shitty leadership, unemployment, protests riots, fking biased mainstream media lack responsibility number fellow Americans; really blame them, would pretty darn pissed too. 

Hang America, good people, get we'll look back know wrong future commit mistakes. links That's pulls from. get better. O.o 

? saw friend commenting struggles breathe mask due asthma, he's fairly genuine guy think he'd make up... probably people can't. like say, striking coincidence many people sudden 'a condition' means wear mask.

Corona stay, opinion can‚Äôt wait vaccine try safe possible understanding spread. everyone stayed home 21 days, would end. robes necklaces could accident hahaa gets even worse realize schools expecting 10 25% reduction budget next year. even normal much less budget. Honest question... eating something virus pose infection risk?  get respiratory system? Florida think going collapse medical system.. Yeah yeah.. xD

Very good comparison indeed. 

Bye Felicia. Even still that‚Äôs way low number believe. Appears though we‚Äôre going fucky, dishonest route comes stats right starting really rise. 

Not good. Transparency one keys beating thing, suppressing truth really Reading, went Tesco day, 10-15% people wearing masks could see, mostly people colour. Think saw 2 elderly white women wear masks though. one's saying bringing deflection tactic. Let's wait Phase III Coronavirus given lot numbers play with, inspired actually start decades long goal ""learn2code"" (Seriously, ten year old ambitious trying learn C++ knew CSS neopets myspace. kicking sticking it)

i'm C programming course youtube figured start lower level language idea what's actually going on. starting learn arrays useful data.

lol i'm starting arrays probably get point making games covid still relevant easier goal :) Yeah, got tired decided would better pretend doesn‚Äôt exist. 

It‚Äôs really disappointing. politics intense man, guys like Trump Bolsonaro literally control way supporters act, everything would different used full powers contain virus.. that's simply objective Coming fall theater near you. Covid-19 VS Flu number new cases dropped point lockdown could eased, it?

The lockdown Spain sounded like one strictest world, people even allowed exercise. Seems like reduced spread virus, masks one tools try stop flaring again. would characterise England US Europe _maybe_, Scotland government nothing like US. Can‚Äôt second wave first one never ebbed.  general population. cant tell metaphor not. it‚Äôs definitely overreacting, overreacting always better reacting pandemic think make really good point lot people may miss. lack safety net exposed ever. people collecting unemployment making money working full-time somewhere else (or equivalent thereof multiple jobs). lazy welfare sucking people right paint economic parasites. people work hard still live paycheck paycheck. country's economy definitely house cards. top heavy matter. Come US, get rich, go home retire without worrying medical expenses. Seems fine me. US gets skilled labor taxes work, home country receives retirees financially support may higher level spending otherwise. 93797 number yesterday floridas total. 

today number 97291.that includes 2152 non florida residents.

97291-93797 = 3494.

the data shows 4700 new cases. Oh  work food processing facility well-known brand engineer. facility million square foot, small definition word. yet outbreak we're proactive. soon get past security, temperature taken issued masks. High temperature = entry. also wear mask times facility. Social distancing done best everyone's ability. cafeteria every seat trash-bagged. 

People also work home allowed so. Meetings, daily otherwise, done zoom everyone home/their respective desks. Extra custodians hired higher sanitation.  Look Iran happened flattened curve.  R good measure outbreak. strictly meat factory fuck-up. industry faced way little regulatory scrutiny long time, ideological commitment meat. nothing openings. general Germany still fine. Yeah see lot well First everyone needed adapt military mindset make sacrifices get economy open. lockdown. 

Now things opened up, people can‚Äôt even bothered put mask ‚Äî people calling sacrifices made screeching horror audacity simplest tasks help mitigate spread. sacrifices me! 

They fail grasp actions affect others. maybe know don‚Äôt care. Given current environment, I‚Äôd bet latter... narrative new cases caused increased testing true, %positive number coming down.

In Florida jumped 4.6% 8.2% last 2 weeks.

On top 250% increase cases 30% increase testing. Holy cow article incredible... contradicts popular debate, critics mitigation strategy often argue prioritizes material well-being human lives.  think criticism mistaken. FHM clearly believed would prohibitively costly suppress spread virus long enough period reiterate, FHM‚Äôs strategy result putting wealth health. 

So ""prohibitively costly"" ""putting wealth health""?

Really? 2 negative news stories I've even seen

The problem apparently filtering coronavirus vaccine research news media. 

If research little know genome particular retrovirus, think fact never coronavirus vaccine developed before, picture changes quickly. government currently busy interacting large gatherings that's going everyday. Hey, direct quote from? pretty sure another sheep repeating rhetoric heard. Reality (at least NY) lockdown almost 3 months started reopen recently infections hospitalizations went way down. stumbles beginning testing think entire government effort state federal level fight virus, sir complete utter moron. localised outbreaks,primarily meat packing factory far 700 confirmed cases. Schools closed area sept entire factory workforce quarantine (around 6k people) 

I think handled well although outbreaks meat factories before. wonder places perfect covid spread? Doubtful. western country got virus control faster (in terms R overall deaths). add New Zealand group countries well. 

The reason americans care masks become culture war thing. People hate Trump love masks, people love Trump hate masks. ridiculous. science masks actually inconclusive. measures far know anyone CA convinced virus. think experience ""common"". really need mindful people sure. Dont wanna wear mask, go to.places requirement. Yea sure. Either way sounds plausible. Here‚Äôs pales comparison subway systems trains East Coast cities though. There's reason South Florida traffic bad. 

Like L.A., everybody cars. still careless man. justify trying support local businesses mean careless. attitude exactly virus spreads quickly. takes people going normal lives spread hundreds same. 

I disagree supporting local businesses, accepted take risk mean careless. look much besides headline, talks removing 2meter social distancing rule UK? Yeah, I'm thinking back care facility grandmother lived think would physically possible even implement there. 

The whole thing set resident apartment (minimal care needs basically ""normal"" one-bedroom apartments kitchens, severely ill/disabled people medical equipment etc), around central courtyard. whole thing set encourage social interaction sense community. 

In words, design making social distancing difficult... outside pandemic made pretty nice place live (our reactions visiting pretty much ""when move in?!""), imagine makes worst possible configuration pandemic... since literally apartments, furniture etc. owned residents, easy move people around either... fortunate enough job throughout whole pandemic currently work office setting. even lost close co worker things started open up, ppl seem care. one leaves mask office. day someone told shouldn‚Äôt long I‚Äôm breathing carbon dioxide I‚Äôm hurting brain...? said get annoyed see someone wear mask car. don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm trying catch shit. It‚Äôs even care get sick. know get it. take shit home me, loved ones won‚Äôt safe. can‚Äôt seem wrap head around fact people act like immune started go party bars. (New York btw)  got sudden urge watch Erin Brockovich again... üòâ Yeah, also pretty much every meatpacking plant US affected, banned Smithfield, much larger outbreaks, owned Chinese company.

My feeling need make sporadic announcements appease Chinese citizens meat source, localized transmission. Otherwise, would literally stop importing meat. like BBQ one best choices St. Louis Salt &amp; Smoke. recently opened taken seriously. far rest city &amp; county... mixed bag. Many times go store 15% people wearing masks. wife's family type people go lengths protesting least thankfully wear avoid getting problems. biggest complaint comes confusion surrounding type masks actually help prevent spread. sources say N95 masks best say aren't. Surgical masks good sterile environments cloth masks suppress you. lot back forth general misinformation, imo. biggest thing regardless mask, proven states countries wearing mask helps. government asking wear 24/7 rather public. sucks people work 9+ hours day, people would worn masks get go, would less issue now. slowly reopening anymore fear virus, see bunch kids/teenagers elders ignoring completely social distancing measures. Plus remaining 20-50 years old respectful measures conspiracy boomers. weakening. Weakening weak thing, appears finally viruses becoming weaker like SARS others Arizona Italy saying weakening. would trust view. wonder thinks pregnancy tests cause birth rates rise Austria almost completely re-opened already cases steady since one month (first wave re-opening started May 1, around 10-40 cases per day maximum).

It definitely done strict opening measures. Maybe cause mass protests? Borougho market. Like 2 ppl masks Lots executives take companies short term personal advancement. Yep. know.

The factory living place usually mechanism circumvent minimum wage. combining role landlord employer ask high rent thus end effective lower minimum wage. illegal require seasonal workers rent place factory farm usually can't rent apartment nearby local landlords want ""loud drunken Eastern Europeans"" neighbourhoods (not words) usually rural conservative locations.

The seasonal workers mind living conditions relative high rent still earn ton money send home. large, Pennsylvania PEOPLE good job following rules. think many scared PA would turn NY NJ.  corporations job probably scared confrontations customers.

 Unfortunately, places rarely extra space staff segregate people, also huge problem pandemic. owners want hurt bottom lines space/ staff/ resources generating profit 100% time. Hence PPE stockpiled. isolation wings. staff part-timers jobs healthcare settings. *Glares French, Italian multiple dialects German* honestly think way. Leave voicemail/send text.

I would happy coordinate contact tracer way would trust scam would call back number listed County Health Department's website! Agreed LA needs get shit together too. point wear goddamn mask matter people aren‚Äôt multitude reasons different areas including limited ignorance, stupidity, selfishness, politics. health issue. Wear mask. offer pay cash payment plan they'll settle cost similar sell collection agencies (a bit higher make opportunity cost). I‚Äôm still shock Canadians don‚Äôt get fact lockdown actually made sense compared we‚Äôre seeing south swallowing issues?  can't read article behind paywall. see graph, would exclude UK cherry pick? would bring deaths double western Europe. article say daily new deaths western Europe? Seems little disingenuous.  much unpack there. court consider scenarios order, written, would cause undue harm infringe rights.

Striking quarantine order represents competing interest court consider. state's existing legal orders cause low infection rate compared neighboring states, quarantine visitors cause undue harm violate rights safety residents state. 

Hawaii one example, may havent court challenges. infection rate one per day 1.25 people- low. People coming states represent public danger without quarantine.  reading much virus did, maybe information date, based numbers second-week crash reported on. remember seeing number places, here's way worded weird, understanding 5 days show symptoms, people get bad cases crash sometime week that. 

I really want place bet, kind morbid I'm hoping wrong. think people willing still really sure what's going happen. Nowhere else world trajectory we're United States, know of, guess we're going see. I've happily surprised Georgia see spike reopening, think definitely avoided, rising case counts preceded rising deaths everywhere. hope different, numbers work encouraging me. 

I think materialized two weeks, us seeing rising case counts clearly, maybe avoided second NYC. watching closely hoping happen. epidemiology, case fatality rate (CFR) ‚Äî sometimes called case fatality risk case-fatality ratio ‚Äî proportion deaths certain disease compared total number people diagnosed disease certain period time. CFR conventionally expressed percentage represents measure disease severity.[1] CFRs often used diseases discrete, limited time courses, outbreaks acute infections. CFR considered final cases resolved (either died recovered). preliminary CFR, example, course outbreak high daily increase long resolution time would substantially lower final CFR. 

In words, CFR accurate measure, *once outbreak over*, cases rising, substantially lower final total. ask. Veggies would turn fast. Can't virus survive surfaces five days? salads would publics hands they? refrigeration make live longer? I've seeing fewer fewer people wearing masks public. Last time saw one person mask on. seriously feels like people wore masks two days forgot it.  course, none countries match lows America (speaking primarily Western, developed countries course). see American inner city ghettos anywhere else Western world. know countries adequate safety net high wages. Maybe Canada. confirm it‚Äôs common belief throughout Central Valley well. horrible flu season here. Taiwan, Japan, South Korea populous enough you?  Yeah, country. country test people blamed games. people shut up, started testing find cases, people pretended notice.

Seems people still around. U right.

Edit word Hard make citizens take seriously president doesn‚Äôt. Well, expect wipe run coins? salivating though dead Americans feed crazy inferiority complex. really turned Europeans . Smug attitudes sick American fetish. love anymore. Well course... *if* afford People still believe who? ü§°üòÇ That‚Äôs point don‚Äôt get: know exactly happens reopen without proper measures. many places world reopened way better statistics are, looking scale back (see news Israel today, opened 10x less cases per capita Ontario, insane testing contact tracing, looking take steps backwards). 

To ‚ÄúSee happens‚Äù costs lot lives, especially we‚Äôve seen many examples elsewhere...nevermind lack mandatory masking, shitty contact tracing, limitations testing (it‚Äôs got better it‚Äôs world class yet either). appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  name city. title means went hotel appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Sweden far nothing terms locking  can‚Äôt imagine hard pregnant bullshit, let alone bullshit plate.

I hope family safe. kind destination people go vacation year? people think second wave. read it, thanks. Petition create border wall California/Oregon rest US It'll likely take vaccine completely rid US COVID. state different approach handle virus. causing spread intranationally allowing travel across state lines. states mandatory masks don't. Neighboring counties differ one another precedent set governor. far I'm aware, opposite European countries government's centralized. would they'd infect us families. Chinese government power, money, time overly safe kind thing. UK teacher here. think effectively get rid social distancing schools schools reopen students. 

I also think Government very, reluctant close again. 

It depends though national picture is. infections/deaths start going like before, thing happen before: parents stop sending kids in, vulnerable staff stay away many staff members end self-isolating. force schools close, happened last time. local outbreaks may well see schools chaotically closing reopening.

It‚Äôs going really disruptive don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve quite yet reckoned medium-term consequences this. thought talking Soros :). Less 6 days, per Worldometers  Oh god embarrassing... Kentucky enters discourse Would people know difference, wonder?

Coronavirus feels like really bad flu according American newscaster‚Äôs experience watching. (Chris Quomo think name was.)

Unless people actually get tested see flu, would even known actually covid?

Good know though. Maybe flu - hopefully. doctor opens I‚Äôll there‚Äôs way tell ever it. I‚Äôm even sure tests use antibody tests. Countries like Thailand wearing masks since January, third cases Finland, Denmark Norway. single specific person, people would be. Lets remember CDC first said wear masks almost everyone participated. good, testing people per day, still seeing decrease since counties yellow even green several weeks now.

In last week Average daily cases decreased 20% testing average increased. Good lord website sucks mobile. constantly moving things around new ads pop Terrible. sadly surprising, many parking lots covered tossed gloves masks. 450,000 dead...

And know, disease reputation serious long term damage (blood clots, holes lungs, inflammation heart, kidneys, liver, causing Type 1 Diabetes, amongst things). please, tell great *MILLION* cases world wide (that confirmed, anyways). high level care closed memory professional nurses 24/7 cost minimum $10,000.00 month plus expenses. Medicare pay level quality care anyone, need pay yourself. great private nursing homes there, long waiting lists charge fortune. Dressing GI Schmoe protesting able get haircut month order magnitude shameful. didn‚Äôt think toddlers allowed guns, TIL...

Edit: CFb, season, really think buckeyes win another NC year honestly think get flu shot early summer.

The primary care docs seem happiest opted insurance together. don‚Äôt know Americans whole ready DPC.

I‚Äôll certainly say 24/7 access doc amazing. I‚Äôm sure Americans ready subscription.

But think really good primary care physicians gravitate towards model, seems like better model care. Governor Tom Wolf today announced 12 counties move green phase reopening COVID-19 pandemic 12:01 a.m. Friday, June 26. counties include Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Erie, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, Philadelphia Susquehanna. 

Lebanon county stay yellow cases skyrocket.

Philadelphia County met criteria move state‚Äôs green phase June 26; however, local officials maintain additional restrictions July 3.


‚ÄúWhen 12 counties move June 26, nearly every county green,‚Äù Gov. Wolf said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs testament many residents businesses sacrificed past three months stay home adhere guidance state provided protect lives livelihoods"". FYI, advice scientifically supported CDC. Read up. science, according CDC, says surgical masks won‚Äôt stop wearer inhaling small airborne particles, cause infection. masks form snug seal around face. CDC recommends surgical masks people already show symptoms coronavirus must go outside, since wearing mask help prevent spreading virus protecting others nearby cough sneeze. agency also recommends masks caregivers people infected CORONA VIRUS  Europe's cases continuing go downwards USA cases going back up, deaths lag behind cases expect deaths go back sad. really can't idea germany set guess? never actually chose herd immunity US. states left devices chose 2+ month lockdown. lockdowns ending, we're screwed everyone acting like kids got grounded (going bars, clubs, parties, etc) addition many people (but all, varies highly region) wearing masks, social distancing nobody enforcing safety protocols. Herd immunity never aim. Oh wow could be???? SARS-COV-2 racist virus. fact joined protests. Europe much worse death toll coronavirus. U.S. not. hear often, intend think media biased anywhere. least hope....unfortunately hope squished.

Bet fun parties. Thanks. Hopefully sticks. longest I've ever quit, lot. Yeah shows way less deaths europe  politically, size wise states equal counties far imposing boarder restrictions size area looking lot closer county US.

The German state North Rhine-Westphalia populous 5th top state terms population, would third size California(our populous state) terms population.

IE: largest German state Bavaria would 41st smallest US state.

The entire country Germany would 5th largest US state terms size. think Maine misleading. They're already starting low baselines increase looks bad. Europe also continent, double population. 

On state country basis, worst American states far worse per capita toll similarly populated countries, deaths countries higher population. Why?

No, implemented rolling lockdowns. southern states waited began see surge close things down, people would take seriously now, states would avoided getting hit hard NYC.

I mention click link study hamsters colleges area announcing reopening plans. honestly dont want go small crowded classrooms people state (and potentially country). dont know they're sticking online hybrid format atleast. That's surprising. /s One factor seen mentioned yet EU counties locked forbid travel to/from... Well.. Pretty much anywhere. Travel states US never restricted.  Trump banned people traveling China one time! ramped testing (about month late)! won‚Äôt necessarily bad thing. whole purpose social distancing overwhelm healthcare system, bring cases zero....all takes one person slip cracks place like New Zealand cases rage control again. 

The Freedom US citizens demand lead higher infection rates, turn eventually lead herd immunity.

Like said, I'm staying away it, least now. forced 2 weeks ago. Shit sucks saving grace I'm one three semi competent states. ireland I'd say 1 20 people wear mask that's generous 1 20 probably like 1 100 live. could possibly reopened way result continued spread virus? way see wait cases get low enough wait contact tracing get ramped enough virus could continue kept check. never way going either things happen time reopening businesses would still able reopen people became mentally unhealthy long term isolation would mass non-compliance rioting. 

Another concern contact tracing itself. yet convinced done way lend abuse government, favor all. could used round anyone government sees ""threat"" public health anyone interactions person.

I've recently learned even hospitalizations necessarily mean much.

Elective surgeries restarting every patient tested. go get surgery, test positive, COVID!   EPL, Bundesliga, etc resumed Europe (where virus control) we‚Äôre totally deprived sports anymore least. Please tell however advocating life normal ""less vulnerable"" severe damage done bodies well infect family members. implying are, comes way. know China‚Äôs videos released mostly illegal. Italy seemed let quite reporters show public reality situation, don‚Äôt recall seeing NY wouldn‚Äôt expect happen here. I‚Äôm curious differences laws, nothing else privacy issue seems partially cultural. steal asinine rebuttal "" say pump money it?"" understand system works, I'm saying change system.

No, quite literally said spend that's completely irrelevant fact US could spend money health care instead spend weapons. matter convenience balance. saying masks work, (when used properly, 99% Europeans know to).

We, European, used masks. therefore experience rather invasive.
People Thailand (or Asia matter) used less disrupted.

So inconvenience weighs reduction illnesses, (most of) us, doesn't.

I like mention flu, different, (you) wear masks disease, wearing would also save lives.

So yeah, maybe masks help reduce less 10 daily hospital cases even more, populace seem find worthwile. THEY

Can‚Äôt follow posts? Mostly article written UK paper, talking top UK pediatrician fancy London children's hospital. wanted go little rah-rah sounding ""Children's hospital reports good results treating covid-linked inflammatory syndrome treatment similar inflammatory syndromes"". suspicion dead wrong kind thing foreigners conclude dozen seconds thinking problem. 

Firstly populace isn‚Äôt militarized; one isn‚Äôt police officer ever committed crime $300,000 Lenco BearCat armored personnel carrier, instance. People aren‚Äôt police officers commit shootings, stabbings, arson, robbery, crimes, chain command seeks defend territory carry special operations. police military that, hence, ‚Äúmilitarization police.‚Äù

Secondly police don‚Äôt buy $300,000 Lenco BearCat armored personnel carriers prevent stop crimes happening, buy police departments insane amount money military-industrial complex succeeded expanding market domestic law enforcement. managed excellent lobbying. Hate break dude, still need voicemail. medical group used work would exclusively call people confirm upcoming appointments reschedule. 

Texting feasible. starters, professional settings still use landlines send texts. bigger problem huge chunk patients 70+ years old, even email addresses. Would help term limit thinking people voting Ugh I‚Äôm worried this‚Äôll soon, parents live Texas I‚Äôm NJ. April dad said could head things got bad here. Welp. Kind of. Many first world countries treat people rich well. That‚Äôs social welfare systems are. Maybe better way say US kind crappy place live unless you‚Äôre rich. countries introduced lockdown mandatory use masks (Italy, Spain, Belgium, France etc) less control. Meaning, masks probably irrelevant. saying evidence for/against masks inconclusive, recommend general public. Haha. love Reddit. parents making dinner little buddy? Two months? jersey 4 months now. Things looking tho Shocked many patients ground glass opacity. Absolutely devastates lungs. long term effects resilience effects quite important public health. [COVID-19 Hospitalizations Set Records 9 Days Straight Texas Surpasses 107K sure trying flood hospitals. states seeing record hospitalizations well, I'm lazy bother looking them. absolutely evidence ‚Äúupswing‚Äù statistically significant. Also flat curve doesn‚Äôt preclude occasional small upswing, long countries medical resources don‚Äôt simultaneously get stressed everywhere. absolutely isn‚Äôt 'affordable'. could money time world care ailing parent. want spend 5-10 years life nothing that, reconstructing entire home miniature care-unit (or move parents home there).

Thousands ailing elderly people literally cannot ever left alone. Take care homes, insist family someone building 24 hours day. guess post picture two differently-colored lines, abandon semblance critical thought, pat back. Jesus, people fucking brain dead. Houston located sure lot BLM protests nobody mentioning anybody something negative BLM labelled racist. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh yeah, missed word ""randomly"" there. right, one got tested every day would assume much testing. nice. awesome, i'm proud you!!!!!!  nice tasting stuff, it?

So far biggest weirdest thing sinuses discharging 15 years worth boogers; know that's gross really accepted bad breathing sinuses lungs!

as wheeled military emergency room four people moon suits said myself, ""Yep, seems like good moment"" Wasn‚Äôt contact tracing part plan? You‚Äôd think checklist activities people might done basic stats work could lead clarity... Lol thanks assuming positions. steal asinine rebuttal "" say pump money it?"" understand system works, I'm saying change system. mean that's underlying argument right? Govt paying healthcare means we're using insurance anymore, rendering whole ""tHiS WoRkS"" explanation moot. shit we're paying way system. That's govt run damn thing pay taxes. insurance companies can't leech profits something almost inelastic demand public good first place.

But nah, I'm horrendously stupid... there's way assumed views, attacked even viewpoint, personally attacked me. Fuck kid. shitty thing would able safely start going people paitent  Could reasons? called contract tracing masks. bring known cases near zero trace every single case pops up. way EVERYTHING reopen keep cases low level. Oopfh. That‚Äôs dense midnight. someone care simplify it? Haha supposed lull first second waves fucking pandemic politicized, keep rolling breaks. cringe whenever think bad fall/winter be. ""Europe Murican't"" headline breaking news. would without sub absolutely isn‚Äôt. Majority healthcare profits come non-essentials (elective surgeries, etc). Covid means *cant* those. shall see. it‚Äôs long, world far problems virus wrong, virus apolitical everywhere except US, things work right? Afaik lot americans think sort agenda, might something right? saying many people US mentally incapable basic common sense? /s 

It hurts me, literally hurts me... apparent outsider, suggest careful jumping conclusions see news. I‚Äôve travelled large swath world learned withhold quite bit judgment countries since portrayal TV runs contrary experiences. fact Italy‚Äôs death rate 5.8/10,000 people 50% higher rate 3.7 indicates may judging us accurate light. US really good suppressing scientific consensus virus. little late...they waited 31,000 cases per million, country world require face masks?! mean country test people cuz muh Olympic Games?

not hard better operating like this... difference good government inept one. virus came source dramatically different outcomes.  develop antibodies, never recover it. Either never it, he's past stage would active antibodies (months typically). memory b cell test needed, think available yet covid 19. Would answer ‚Äúzero times?‚Äù someone U.K. go debt health costs? figured kinda done with. flattening curve, suppressing it. Europe created problem drag out. case made angry read it. requiring masks customers CASINO. ARIZONA, expressed worry higher ups told could drive golf cart perimeter security outside. changed mind told work door.  
   Washington needed job Lone Butte casino. **The health benefits helped pay insulin, daughter said, paycheck helped cover rent life insurance.**  
  
And fucking shitty health insurance company. Take look percentage tests coming back positive idea state doing, reference,an area well (many regions Europe Canada) 1%, countries extremely badly (like Brazil) 30%. There's currently good affordable option. rich folk live caretaker teams hired look families. rest us screwed. rephrased American big 4 sports allowed wear mask carrying sporting activities, cycling running even you‚Äôre car. It‚Äôs stores require wear mask you‚Äôre walking destination required wear mask. police Qatar stop see without mask hanging around people, almost never you‚Äôre yourself. It‚Äôs silver lining right now. year terrible parents, dad got really sick, travel plans ruined, favorite nephew push back wedding.

But hey, atleast fucking virus hasn‚Äôt ruined retirement plans yet Shoot think ever *stopped* hotspot. good news tests found less positive cases previous day. I'm aware evidence differentiate whether people get reinfected, whether disease relapse remitting persistent infection people's immune system fails ever fully clear. I'm honestly sure would worse...

The one good thing cases, instances relapsed patients infecting others, despite testing positive - Korean contact tracers looked them...  Probably cuz got bunch fucking idiots gathering huge crowds? we're definitely headed towards people different political ideologies never interacting, even public spaces. 60% us going shop mandate masks, 40% shop do. Ask around area. good ones. mother RN worked geriatrics forty years. got sick, chose move last home worked in, took great care her. (My mother assertive woman. care par, would heard it.) 

But, anyway, ask people know thirties, forties, fifties; likely older parents kind situation. (Above fifties likely parents deceased.) opinions homes parents living in. Tour whole bunch places get lay land. want looking clean place (try visit mealtime see food looks like, too.). Ask talk current residents see think place. Visit times. friends house last week showed full PPE bodysuit wears handling meat. clear, flexible one piece plastic suit completely covers neck feet.   
I'll tell .. friend Hannibal knows craft. It'd moving goal posts ever flattened goddam curve, see upswing? look flat you? Ya know hospitals gotten better last 3 months right? fact they've gotten worse. less supplies, worked medical staff, sick medical staff. moving goal posts, idiot. It‚Äôs sad say American, culture entitlement selfishness. wish could afford take gap year, home situation definitely let me. I'm fully prepared senior year fully taken away coronavirus that.

The biggest school area attracts students around world going online thankfully, seemingly every one announcing reopening plans. college system sucks man. Yep, ""law abiding"" gun owners forced turn guns via due process funny habit shooting people came take guns. States really need stop naming cities states R number Germany shot 2.88 apparently trump administration joke. France here. really think suppressed virus all... Things bit better weeks, careful enough anymore, feel like weeks, we'll bad numbers again, unfortunately March 12th. quiet? Vienna anything getting cocky. certainly bored unless we'll second lockdown. ....yeah. tiny road rail li is, little international transit, population smaller many cities.....

Did stutter?

Or want points island? Well done. must taken ages make. What's difference protesting systemic racism pretending protest systemic racism? someone answer question you, going understand anyway. can‚Äôt stop giggling train üí© water. Well sure, look whole picture COVID-19. Covid kicked economic downturn that's way now, cops power trip, racial divides widening, bills getting paid big corporations getting bailed elites run country (it's really corporations run btw) Internet outrage wildly control reason EVERY topic politically charged opinion subject slightly different someone else hate without considering conversation it. top that, real information getting harder find since msm twists stories make hate group people insert opinion feel think something. seem also waiting WW3 alien invasion whatever next bs event surprised happens. Naughty Dog ruins Last US Part II crap story.

Sorry rant, I'm want live hills somewhere hermit group dogs call life. interesting pov. dumb comment? Oranges apples. Nobody excited drug trying. excited possibility may understood mechanism leads forming clots.  hype actual N nothing it. actually know technique used.  hypothesis probably tested independently. Negligence. would walked right out! Like bratty children anything forced do. happened couple weeks ago meatpacking plant near hometown Colorado. COVID sucker meatpacking plants guess. better go hiding loses election. seen average American? We're great self-care improving disability-adjusted life years best times. information available daily NHC report. get info drill local HC level, local daily report info. bigger deal course. lets see happens Biden wins Trump time November January lame duck president whatever wants. 

At point surprised started war declared martial law keep president. Putin would Putin idol.

Trump knows point fucked protection presidency keep jail anything stay jail. 

WW3? keeps jail start it. cares nothing himself. Dave Pastor ... I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre small dick k*ke. could full national stockpile. could non-disbanded pandemic response team. could [slashed CDC personnel much more. another everything going might well another shitty journo piece stretches things unbelievable extent make sense want to.

By means, watch video walk us alternate explanation. list causes death go full year... sure Dec 31 still far ahead? 

On claim 7% antibodies, assume going report shows 7% Stockholm antibodies, regions Sweden much lower rates ""4.2 percent Sk√•ne 3.7 percent V√§stra G√∂taland."" would mean far less 7% population Sweden show signs antibodies. 

It's strange argument having, similar global warming seems one group people hell bent denying truly problem another group repeating cause devastation. main reason deny Covid-19 major global problem despite mountains evidence collaborating statements every expert field? thumbs aren‚Äôt tweeting, too. He's hurting right people I‚Äôm also entirely impressed ability ignore fact much death come hands decreased medical care COVID. Truly remarkable. Ahhh yes, that's logic use I'm done shower scream showerhead there's much water coming out. Well, like he's involved raising children probably realize. look closely that‚Äôs countries hop snap map check Oakland. 

Giant crowds young people, social distancing, masks. 

Shooting fireworks twerking. Yakima County, WA one hospital, worst per capita outbreak three West Coast states, they‚Äôre track surpass number cases King County (home Seattle) has.

So yes, rural areas fucked. foolish wearing mask driving alone? feel like it‚Äôs unnecessary, walking dog there‚Äôs one nearby. wonder what's take Schrodingers cat then. Players brought fact Walt Disney World staffers reside NBA campus‚Äîincluding hotel housekeeping‚Äîwill subject coronavirus testing, sources said. One mitigating factor cited, source added: many surging cases areas Orlando.""


Our current clusterfork situation guarantees rich living bubble cannot safe unless lower income people serve access healthcare contact tracing. 

Also healthy NBA players afraid getting virus, people still think flu straightout dumb. looked IMHE projections? shows slow drop deaths next weeks, slight rise followed leveling August. big spike September. Projects 207000 change October 1st. Either way, we‚Äôre find out. Seems America decided go it. simplify mind, I‚Äôve taking mathematical view waves described.

Nationally, looking deaths, US still first wave. first wave peak trending downward. order mathematically define second wave, would need see deaths increasing US week week. would think getting close given case spikes large southern states, although testing increased dramatically.

We‚Äôll either never see increase death (which would wonderful near impossible), we‚Äôll see increase next two weeks, increase comes back fall school goes back weather cools. cheap. lot people better uses $200.00 people defy principle instead actually making informed decision makes sense. food essential now?  That‚Äôs America nth amendment , shall wear mask, there‚Äôs amendment, economy worth couple hundred thousand lives. USA USA! That's usually plan, rarely easy decision make. binary. get peaceful Dorothy raging, angry Andrew. think cares bonus package more. coworker saw someone take sneeze, so... *so far*

I hear argument time, mean open everything back without discretion still meeting goal. Don‚Äôt buy products, you‚Äôll get covid giant assholes
To staff. Corona manufacturers Dole leafy greens/packaged lettuces etc right? 

Sure, like places ramp production right days weeks. Especially wanting extra careful covid.

At point ensure food supply personally think skewering company delivers leafy greens bit overzealous. coming antivaxxers really ironic considering hydroxychloroquine natural.

""Natural"" disguise politico-economic gripes have. Probably initial cases hit high risk populations, like nursing homes. spread general public, seeing true death rate amongst ages risk factors. Oh, sarcasm obvious enough you? dumb enough believe nonsense? Maybe spend seconds searching information..

This stuff announced April major feature iOS 13.5 update. never secret, conspiracy, nothing T-Mobile outage last week.

No one rolled anything without user permission, either accepted installed 13.5 accepted enabled automatic updates. 

Get fucking clue. He‚Äôs actually scientist, he‚Äôs businessman owns 9% multi-billion dollar biotech company stands make significant amount money drumming quotes raise share price people mostly employed factory ""leased"" another firm. 

This pratice banned 2021 meat plants Germany. term actually originated Germany. I‚Äôm surprised haven‚Äôt heard them, they‚Äôre pretty popular Northeast too. Idk got downvoted, look Sorrento therapeutics, Moderna Laymen say too. Well yeah eu coordinate efforts eu nothing uk / russia. think particular context makes sense include countries. mean, packaged salads/lettuces. Leafy greens several rungs essential ladder beef, imo.

At least shutdown would cause short term shortage loose bulk lettuce. vitamin supplement 125mcgs (5000 IU‚Äôs) that‚Äôs higher ones I‚Äôve seen. take 1 pill, 5 time week. 

A gram vitamin would 800 pills. I‚Äôd say consume 2 grams vitamin year. kilo would 800,000. even going math one. You‚Äôre arguing sake arguing, point. I. conversations need remember vote. trend rural hospitals closing consolidating going decades pandemic prime example isn‚Äôt good thing necessarily. Yeah think continued first wave. end taper off, start back places really second wave.  Cause state leaders like Arizona‚Äôs Doug Ducey literally said he‚Äôs NOTHING city mayor own. 

In world people like continue power aren‚Äôt removed, stand chance. interest tow rope everyone else. stayed home two months, barely left house all, wore mask did. Washed hands hand sanitized fingers practically bled.

But seems much ask people. sacrifice naught.

So fuck it. age, risk dying suffering severe complications low. Sorry older, fatter, sicker people - even think blaming me. happily part, unless see much higher participation, I'll never again. miserable. reproduction number rising fast right mandatory then? Stay safe - let idiot neighbors infect you! Yup. Sounds right. Tedros Ethiopian? guys got big brains sending dude away."
