This disease contagious deadly circulating worldwide December, would seen massive death spike Christmas travel complete absence prevention measures. mean, like Coronavirus itself.

Heart inflammation arrhythmias may kill you, enough put someone work physical labor job comorbidities. enough keep kids school young adults college first jobs. even 5% society falls category, we're bad time. already strained healthcare system astronomical unemployment rate need stress. 

It's enough push already tense society edge.

I told ""fear mongering"" back February stocked groceries toilet paper. I've worked healthcare - specifically elderly long-term disabled - knew coming. now, even fraction new information ends true, problems plague nursing homes - critical lack funding, inadequate standards care, underpaid barely competent staff, patients advanced illnesses kept alive family refuses sign DNR - problems creep younger younger populations, like already thanks obesity epidemic, bleed society general. 

I dunno, me, I've seen 55-year-olds dialysis liver kidneys functioning 50%. still imagine smell antiseptic use clean places, makes gag thinking it. smell hits like brick wall second walk door - door rarely ever staffed, stand waiting 10 minutes let in, minimum wage employees give shit. 30 patients given time attend to. 

I'm taking chances.

Most people never seen inside dialysis center clue portable heart monitor looks like. Covid might change that. [You don’t understand Please stop spreading misinformation. going hop say people cooperating exhausted overlap people flaunting public health measures whole time. Nah, moderately wealthy use poor change leadership. Chinese history full peasant revolts, successful not. always wealthy person swapping another wealthy person. Oh I'm voting. person to, even care. I've never felt passionate anything since Obama got elected first time thought killed racism. would say wait 14 days safe side especially high risk live someone high risk, covid tests 100% accurate always chance false negative. According CDC, people might test negative positive several days depends several factors sample collected chance false negative.  People believe whatever want believe. wear mask indoors (as required businesses) &amp; really hang close friends family.

Everyone going care different extent information on-hand, whether science bullshit read facebook. friends afraid leave house &amp; friends think hoax.

COVID going anywhere, need learn live somewhere two extremes... ""STAY FUCK HOME"" narrative &amp; fear mongering news articles predominant sub reddit. People dying streets. Hospitals run. know 2 people sick. thing fucking farce. People conditioned follow orders report neighbors. Elderly dying alone. Schoolchildren loosing good education. flu bug. scared first too. eyes opened. Well lifted lockdown. Here's another question know bother looking into. cases per capita lockdown compared US time. Hm? need someone talk to?  Completely agree. point masks distancing (when possible) make lockdowns unnecessary. Still attempting justify incompetence incompetence others? Wait...im alcoholic? drinking gone quite bit since March. noticed starting drink almost every day week, I've trying dial back drinks weekends. slowly slips back though (drinking week nights), alcohol sneaky one like that. lot us worried too. Scary times ahead dude. Keep head. make sure vote. Tell hemorrhoids.   
But speak softly. point accept case spread? goal never stop that, overwhelm hospitals. Go Governor Walz’s YouTube channel listen press conferences since mid-March. That’s message here. “lockdown there’s vaccine” message LA County. Dept Health provides information briefings seeing spread also website. It’s gyms salons it’s restaurants space tables enforce mask rules capacity rules. It’s bars college campuses family gatherings. around 5% positivity rate acceptable. don’t want need government continuing shut businesses. Start penalizing people won’t wear mask. Stop punishing businesses follow rules. paying people’s bills? You? Certainly feds. need care economy. Mine requires $500 direct deposit month avoid fee. used problem, hours reduced pay split hours left unemployment, short requirement. boyfriend gets paid checks works small business direct deposit, count far understand. lol. Someone's re-watched ""An Inconvenient Truth"" many times. Whilst completely stopped workplace, still see lots people bars, restaurants etc. idea how. entire country counting barely faith handle anything. I'm afraid people going think Trump ""back normal"" candidate vote based that. love low IQ crumb eating gamer live parents basement gets big chest. Go watch Anime like single child are. hate Trump country lot problems it. we're past point federal action.

It impossible track trace. Region local action critical now. focus NY individual states dumbass. state centrism.

You think Gov. (do even know means?) Focuses quarantine policy based STATE people visit from. Ya, sick joke. keep comparing Sweden, paid sick live extended covid (no questions asked), universal healthcare, living wages nearly employees. that's capitalism! drastically re-work system working system. 

The worst part is... people can't even strike economic freedom even so. could always try unionize willing put risk fired asking fair pay (yay freedom) Cases raising bit unspecific, let's better talk number daily new cases. specific really important number.

The number new cases rising recent weeks, seems plateau right again. recent development linear growth dangerous exponentially one. keep way winter, good.

Everyone though worried winter negative impact positive development.

For anyone wants see number, check dashboard   Main stream dems rep agree whole lot let on. buddy buddy cameras off. Fucking pro wrestling type acting get people emotional.  well sounds like fun........ guys think happen next month two? think get really bad situation March shut again? France several countries reporting increase cases, france particular reported 10,000 highest since breakdown started eventhough months ago thought controlled outbreak recording really low numbers. wonder gonna happen US approach winter, live Texas one cares virus anymore, people partying gathering like over, would like hear opinion, gonna get really bad? Well small buisness closing restrictions hurts, theres always starving death. hear fun. I'll take vaccine long approved multiple reputable governments (Canadian, French, British, German, Indian, etc.) means top scientists combed data. 

Truthfully take vaccine USA approved it. empathy limitless people see every day trying right things, resources begin with, constantly put risk people like you...who couldn’t care less anyone affected anything long get comfortable time.

Good thing you’re one world dealing mental health issues too...good grief post difficult fall winter basically poster child so. cynic seems right. likely OP saying nice sounding apologia system. 

Just World Fallacy still fallacy 

Follow money use head. leaderps pushing hardest schools reopening know anything care less proper childhood development. shown constant defunding education. whilst UK reported COVID deaths

The country heard might overreporting Belgium. assumption nearly every country underreporting unless testing every dead person comes morgue doors. Duuuuudes. someone worked F&amp;B years take serving position stay afloat.....I say majority restaurants amazing covid really stepped up. Alot even getting checked health department law monthly sometimes like restaurant every week someone checking following guidelines. many places shut doors can't follow simple rules get greedy. would say main issue larger parties people coming eat.....who seen eachother months come different places. Usually one person covid gives others. Last night table 8 college met yearly. live 8 different states, families but, refused cancel friends meet.....seriously people....don't feel like shit dragging back family. can't skip year? believe me....I get tables like nightly. restaurant....just people. Dude. come headlines.  getting pretty cringe point. higher news cycle find highly unlikely COVID circulated 2-3 months deaths started spiking, especially videos people dropping dead streets started coming china towards end Jan, lines pretty well late Nov - mid Dec initial spread event. 

My wife respiratory thing back late Dec/early Jan, also tested negative flu strep, took 3-4 weeks get back normal (even though initial cough &amp; fever lasted 2 days). study read way back march talking another coronavirus (known strand) going around flu season last year particularly nasty last cold/flu season. born ""even"" day, poop ""even"" day.  
If born ""odd"" day, poop ""odd"" day.   
If born leap day, shit outa luck! I’m entirely sure formulated serious plan yet. can’t restaurants remain open indoor seating? 

Because evidence logic say following rules state haven’t case spread. 

How even know certain?

And key word ""following rules"". 

It's hilarious blatantly absurd expect people that, clearly don’t allow least 50% capacity close. can’t gym open? 

Because people *dumb* cannot trusted, that's spread gyms city. 

On whose fucking data? track businesses unacceptable. 

Oh, really going call narcissist I’m afraid livelihood mental health? Screw you.

How calling narcissist?

You're mis characterizing I'm saying: everyone narcissism inside them, people _healthy_ narcissism.

I'm calling human being, nothing more, trying give advice. That's all.

Take leave it. context here... work liquor store major US city lots cases near college. tell someone buying party, happens little less often even say uncommon. actual number going much higher two reasons:

1. Right mystery vaccine. People project worst fears onto (it's gonna cause side effects! Government rushing through! needs testing! omg!) vaccine here, we'll able tout positives vaccine. well tested, experts created it, science behind it, many countries world-wide examined data support it, etc.

2. see SOOO many people say stuff like ""I refuse try brand new vaccine right door!"" actually like...even wanted to, couldn't. Lmao. time average American's time get vaccine, we'll able see hundreds millions people worldwide gotten vaccine perfectly fine. first going essential workers unhealthy, months later Joe office worker. anything anticipate people super impatient wanting get ASAP.

F.D.A. Regulators Publish Rare Self-Defense Amid Rising Vaccine Pressure

A group career scientists Food Drug Administration vowed work would continue unimpeded independent political influence.

The F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, praised statement Thursday, saying authors “took initiative independently express steadfast trust expertise commitment organization.”

WASHINGTON — President Trump continues suggest coronavirus vaccine could ready Election Day, top regulators Food Drug Administration issued unusual statement Thursday promising uphold scientific integrity work defend agency’s independence.

In opinion column published USA Today, eight directors F.D.A.’s regulatory centers offices warned “if agency’s credibility lost real perceived interference, people rely agency’s safety warnings.” mention Mr. Trump political leaders, context appeared clear.

“We absolutely understand F.D.A., like federal executive agencies, operates political environment,” wrote. “That reality must navigate adeptly maintaining independence ensure best possible outcomes public health.”

They added, “We career staff best public health decision makers, arriving decisions based unbiased evaluation scientific evidence.”

The pledge career scientists federal government came amid mounting concerns role White House played emergency approvals coronavirus therapies, including convalescent plasma malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, agency later revoked.

A day plasma received emergency approval last month, Mr. Trump accused officials F.D.A. part “deep state” — moniker career civil servants believes betray agenda — deliberately slow-walking therapies vaccines. Top officials agency, including political appointees, frustrated recent weeks comments Mr. Trump made contact pharmaceutical companies efforts speed progress vaccines, giving impression White House playing regulatory role.


The statement USA Today written large part fears political influence F.D.A., including White House, according senior administration officials familiar effort.


Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, F.D.A. commissioner, praised statement Thursday, writing Twitter members group “took initiative independently express steadfast trust expertise commitment organization.”

“I wholeheartedly agree them,” said.

The specter political arm-twisting vaccine approvals grown several drugmakers entered large late-stage trials summer. Mr. Trump told reporters Monday “we’re going vaccine soon, maybe even special date. know date I’m talking about.”


That timeline, framed around Election Day, widely challenged administration’s top health officials, said vaccine approval early November improbable. Nine pharmaceutical companies issued joint pledge Tuesday would “stand science” put forward vaccine thoroughly vetted safety efficacy.
Coronavirus Schools Briefing: It’s back school — it?

Brian Morgenstern, White House spokesman, said statement Thursday “President Trump, administration scientific community dedicated delivering safe effective vaccine quickly possible ensuring approvals based data thorough medical scientific reviews career professionals independent review board.”

“This false narrative Democrats media advancing, suggesting politics influencing approvals, unconscionable dangerous,” said.

Polling published Thursday Kaiser Family Foundation revealed 62 percent Americans concerned political pressure administration lead F.D.A. rush vaccine approval. Four 10 adults said agency paying “too much attention” politics reviewing issuing approvals therapies.

The F.D.A. still defending decision issue emergency use authorization blood plasma event president, Dr. Hahn exaggerated effects treatment misleading data walked back day later. White House officials repeatedly pressed senior health officials issue approval.

In interview Thursday Economic Club Washington, D.C., Dr. Hahn said “totality evidence support authorization.”

“I want reassure American people, revisit decision data justify re-looking it,” said.

Dr. Hahn also refused commit particular timeline vaccine, saying data clinical trials would first evaluated independent monitoring board. F.D.A. reviews data, “cut corners,” said.

“I don’t crystal ball here,” said. “It would really inappropriate speculate, because, again, haven’t seen clinical data.”

Asked whether F.D.A. commissioner independence needed law, Dr. Hahn promised agency would “independently call balls strikes medical products” would lean career scientists.

Dr. Hahn also publicly committed vet vaccine approval advisory committee outside experts, typically review clinical trial data new vaccine approved.

Dr. Peter Marks, F.D.A.’s top vaccine regulator one authors USA Today column, reiterated online event Thursday sponsored Duke University’s Margolis Center Health Policy emergency authorization limited part population would first go advisory committee."" mean, shit feels REAL again. time I've getting money making working like, drop extra $600, get $200 week...

That's over-reaction. Netherlands people wear masks except public transport. Experience shows outdoor activities one maintain good separation (the Dutch standard 1.5 metres) require masks safety. similarly case indoor activities contact fleeting, supermarkets. Shops Netherlands maximum limits number people allowed one time, distance mostly maintained.

At present evidence also implies indoor dining safe provided distances maintained. Several bars/restaurants closed make enough effort maintain distances. mean infection never happens, uncommon. become clearer coming weeks, weather deteriorates.

Overheard dinner night table German business people hotel conference saying business travel back normal. Except cancelled deal worth millions impossible business Canada send anyone Vancouver. look online versons board games friends video chat playing 👍 we’ve hunkering since March

I seen evidence even majority people US ""hunkered down"", mobility data supports that. I’m sure shining ray sunshine along shortly tell us lie, somehow doesn’t apply US, otherwise terrible news. Give hour... Lol, another dumb trump cultist. long term solution. 2 weeks enforced areas affected, however, combined measures; 2 week period enough handle virus essentially remain unaffected. 

30$ day enough convince selfish, helpess, stay quarantining adopted en mass proves extremely helpful. Everyone hunkers down

Yeah, US kinda skipped part go. Singapore ran successful testing contact tracing program. also benefitted multi-generation households success preventing nursing home outbreaks, fatality rates almost entirely function age infected. Current estimated incident fatality rate UK:

&lt;1yr,1-4: 0.00052%

5-14: 0.0013%

15-24: 0.0045%

25-44: 0.031%

45-64: 0.46%

65-74: 3.1%

75+: Correct im wrong shouldnt winter better contain spread virus since everyone stays indoors cover more? wait 2 weeks.
sorry, forgot put /s Holy crap get $30 day? That's like 5 Stimulus checks American. We've one government fucking around wanting give us second one. 1000 times worse disease Lol, smart. Comparing pandemic killed close million worldwide flu...yikes. honest it’s sad Sweden didn’t go elimination strategy. there’s need worry go bars, clubs activities would restricted, dangerous, countries. That’s testament countries took seriously. That's ~25 000 people flying Wuhan every day average. 

(20million/365/2) That's difference laissez-faire countries like US stricter countries Europe: virus response supposed issue personal preference moral conscience. Wearing mask lifestyle choice optional accessory. official guidelines dictate mask must used, businesses allowed operate conditions etc.

If going café harmful country's virus management strategy expect government close cafés. Obviously populist leaders like Donald Trump far cowardly take difficult decisions live government shy away making unpopular decisions (hopefully) best interests country. Well course, we’ve got prioritize *with degree*. Ya know, like teachers seem feel certification means shouldn’t work (but day cares day camps fine) Disney area nurse vehemently disagrees. stoped poor. make 6 figures. It’s mindset change think money money flows in. mistake. thought may joking Trump UV light used internally kill virus. Hang there. rough place sure. give relief break. Take care yourself! ban new children lock existing ones rooms. /s Soooo, small question.

Every year, strains flue vaccine chosen guessing relevant strains be, looking infection data. work, good infection data, due social distancing? 2021 flue vaccine essentially shot dark, data sufficient give good shot? Sweden attempt flee illness, people spread it. since least 5th century BCE. Maybe they're testing much alcohol system rendered immune.  Yes, it‘s fault!  It’s misinformation call term - flatten curve - placed ads YouTube Pandora Spotify also informational brochures etc. buzz term people remember - that’s get people comply 500 different ways saying easy remember 3 word term. Regardless intent - sales getting info - falls umbrella marketing. Probably depends them, whether hospital testing center.

My one testing center good. See wait car, that's biggest exposure part.

Even pre-covid pretty limited exposure. MRI, pre-covid testing center, contact people waiting room nurse showed get changed/took machine room. think briefly spoke operator too, another room, could avoided -- shout music want glass.

edit: good luck dad! Maybe haven’t noticed, US making decisions based rugged individualism. don’t feel like getting sick, sit home, god 1/3 population wants line streets breathe spit other, better let spit you, you’ll infringing freedom. dummies making real decisions - reckless idiots ones perpetuating pandemic. See study many people Covid dined restaurants two weeks got it. golfing trips one instance. Pandemic money going churches fight legal battles. want oversight disbursed funds friends. parties Go sleep think, China prepared for. countries, China saying, let show world it’s done. Boom, it’s gone. billion people averted. It’s grandma.  modal coronavirus fatality 80 plus, frail living care center cannot take care themselves.  vision grandma presented totally false.  bet redditors never even visit grandparents nursing homes. watching stock market investments go comfortably working home

The one's sell ""panic"".  Yeah, work :/ Yup, ever since stopped drinking absolutely interest restaurants. dont want pay extra listen screaming child staff singing happy birthday third time since got there. used cook restaurants, good reason go anymore. unless data widely accepted neutral authorities issues like open letter thing absolutely cleared up. credit union open anyone living working county. open people working given industry, offer membership relatives current members. bad can't cure/vaccinate stupidity.

there one, used called Darwinism. however go make *warning labels* thing so... u/gojennyo feel sadness. message anytime! feel helpless also would like know anything us east coasters you? Okay sour patch kids change recipe something last years? sour patch kids first time since like 2015/16 soft kinda gross. remember like gummy bear texture. Thats one awful one kind virus.  Chiefs Jags allowing fans. Everyone else isn’t. 

""The Taiwanese government also provides support put quarantine. Local village leaders bring bag basic supplies like food books quarantined individuals. Since quarantines enforced, Taiwanese government also rolled welfare program provides $30 daily allowance affected quarantine two-week taking seriously. Also important mention severity dropped lot. ratio severe cases / deaths really lower compared spring outbreak.

&amp;#x200B;

It may summer, sun, vitamin maybe. Maybe better treatments. Nobody knows. feel need justify either cases deaths. think sad seem stuck black white idea willing literally anything stop virus instead thinking bigger picture. quite sure neither fruit growers orchard workers would agree **only** matters. 

Was case last flu season too? 

Yes around 200 cases day now, 1 daily death. imagine numbers NZ would closed down, yet are. imagine future could walk onto kind hill pick fruits

that would glorious wonder much Americans pay vaccine. Lives Money want learn! Please educate expert opinion totally-not-anecdotal experience Facebook mom group leader hard evidence long term effects. 😂 Yeah. Israeli government full incompetent morons. fewer enjoy it. UK (specifically England) *was* reporting deaths they've changed Enclosed safety glasses help caught eyes. 

It caught outdoors chances much lower. think figure Wuhan put 2%. 30 dollars day supposed mean anything? mind extra 30 day thing keep anyone home. Serious question, flying fuck happened ""flatten curve"" narrative? fucking scam point disgusting Sorry, survival would socialism. Speak yourself. I’m still waiting piles bodies streets promised 4th July. Fingers crossed! Thanks answering. I’m sorry found situation. hope neither come anything. realize everyone racist, right? minority.

God morons numerous...

""We victims!!! outnumber you, Zimbabwe time white asses!! gonna learn tolerate race. racist white devil gives free food shelter!!!!"" what? Aren’t hospitalizations deaths way down? Rule 1 YouTube: Never, ever read comments pretty mush always toxic cesspool.

Edit: leaving spelling error kinda fitting. That's true. first introduction message Ai Fen December 30th. one who'd met people virus, patient found 'suspected SARS'. shared information colleagues, spread medical circles reached Li.

It's suspected Li caught virus working 8th January, week post leaked. substantially due increased testing? thanks. stopped caring real statistics told 94% people dying already dying something else. sick people need learn live sterile environment, wear N95 mask, learn take without making sick. rest us need resume living life normally. links posted also many cases reconciliation death count since past months.I can't personally vouch every state,but fully vouch Karnataka underreporting cases also death count.In fact u living Karnataka right got tested 90% chance positive carrier covid antibodies.  people work still think real. ignores fact wealth disparity fucking insane right billionaire, may well destitute.

Everyone billion dollars needs money taken them.

You accumulate GENERATIONS DRAGON GOLD means exploiting robbing working class equity afforded labour. oh no, whatever without approval Australian neckbeards?! Republicans* sit around whine Reddit.. Got it. watch much CNN True, generally mandatory big cities. admit way blurry towns least wear concentrated areas.

That's like 6% population; definitely *most people*. Gdp trash measure Flu, RSV, covid... interesting. realize youre racist, right? fail understand believe they'd that? common air conditioning systems Netherlands public places? biggest issue south, masks necessary.

It’s college chicas.  Cowboys teams though. probably listen tRUMP **There *was* policy ignored actively fought efforts combat pandemic. guess people already forgot that.** Yes. Yes, did. Sound like MAGA Yeah, thought bullshit since February/March. Like seriously, respiratory illness causes coughing sneezing spread like every similar disease? I'm ashamed even took long clue in. \*shakes head sadly\* Right. wouldn’t say: “If Rich_Cartoonist8399 keeps showing school close person learning students go permanent online learning” reason decided threaten kid Well going script again, time start slashing TV interview appearances ASAP Yeah dudes crack Let's also remember Twitter password ""Yourefired"", discovered 2016. amount people made political

You mean lefty media DNC? Gotta love condescending Reddit users 0 clue can’t imagine leading expert infectious disease fucking reality tv star tell don’t know shit, bunch GED wielding morons tell same. definitely. Kids little balls germs. parent I’ve kids turn heads 2 inches face open mouth cough. never ""Fauci political actor"" crazy team statement starting concern me... another world? looking data?  Netherlands advise wear masks obligatory cities. Also traveling always obligated wear mask public transportation.  

You're right Sweden, they're exactly successful strategy compared Germany, example. 10 times densely populated.  math instead 9/11 black people killed police. That's numbers reported CDC anymore go directly DC. Gotta get numbers election. go anywhere, there's treatment cure vaccine. Every state almost fully reopened. anything, numbers exploding considering everyone part let guard Goes show kind person is. Lets use proper names giving blame?

The Trump administration dropped ball hard. started wearing masks think end march honestly seen decline people wearing masks time part Germany. I'd say least 90% people wear masks indoors noses peaking out. really see many people mask all. can't speak long distance trains, I'd guess people would consious it, goes late night trains drunk people them, mask adherence probably lower well. Luckily trains ventilation systems seem pretty safe travel even everyone wearing one. busses basically everyone wears well.

We fair share people complaining bitching first months, think point every one used big deal people it, since well rules luckily like 75% understand great enable us live together well rest hate forced wear social pressure (this hypothesis)

I can't speak Germany though, I'm pretty well small city area. sure things different bigger cities like Berlin Article said ten inside . republican standpoint 100% incorrect. ""exercising rights"" means risking lives *other* people, longer able exercise right, within reason scrutinized regulation.

*Most* people things like go grocery shopping work (if still job). fellow shoppers co-workers constantly ""exercising rights"" going bars, parties, large gatherings, putting others forced around risk.

And like look someone store go ""oh yeah, he/she definitely lot, better stay away."" creates almost false illusion time world screwed appears news negative 99% time.

The recent coverage leading corona vaccine candidate pausing stage 3 testing investigate ""mysterious illness"" great example this.

These pauses happen time. mysterious illness mysterious all. Tests resume within days. reason news people hoping praying vaccine media saw opportunity go ""LOOK LOOK VACCINE FAILING CLICK ME"".

The discourse virus whole seems devolved fear mongering. Maybe different US never stopped first wave, country media like ""CASES SKYROCKETING! SECOND WAVE??"" actually look numbers ICU occupancy 1/20th first wave mortality rate 0.6% (2 daily deaths, vs 22 car accidents). number that's big infection rate that's number media hit head with. Re-election? Exactly. dozens most, millions infected first place. even register statistical margin error. almost like national strategy would good idea. voice reason. Well said. Gone days personal fact checking. simply decide fact based personal preference. Unfortunately US, fact often decided based political allegiances, means issue exclusively US. really easy understand run products happened: media malfeasance. made absolute FUCKLOAD money keeping sheep state panic fear.

They need held accountable, surely political capital squeezed COVID. Spanish flu pandemic end 2 years never vaccine found it? Could covid-19 pandemic end way? Yeah. Romania great start considering country aspects, people somehow became crazier everyone thinks virus government made countries affected badly , even calling covrig 19( direct translation = pretzel 19 ). kinda first wave us. Well agree something: way handled definitely election instead us lives. That's smart tactic. Can't get second surge never get first surge. Even so, surface exposure main way virus transmitted. mostly person person masks social distancing important. I’m ignoring it, follow guidelines. people think everyone stay home months go groceries aren’t realistic. need thankfully state can. people souls avoid Trump. TA stands throw away. I’m 27. complain losing youth? Kinda hard people pushing ""it's big deal"" thread people went demanding open could get haircut vacation. Thanks states able kick service industry people unemployment support shops opened early. corporate bailout, one bars.

lol States rights!!’ /s Well socially distancing since began, yes, like supposed doing. 

What many, many others failed accept world lived pre covid gone. beginning something much worse sooner like accept sooner work solution instead shitting other. nationwide rules, it’s localities make even strict. US set baseline rules nation, every locality wants. state California operating way described, everywhere  believe word traditional Chinese statistics. 0.4 percent us caught Rona, sort rate anecdotes useless. think personally know anyone caught thing. 50%? LOL. full capacity 80% Florida couple months now. Could someone advise government won’t consider 50-60yo+ lockdown (+those younger health concerns). people living elderly vulnerable lockdown too? way healthy don’t put life pause work improving economy? I’m politician open told wouldn’t work makes sense me. I'm saying someone becomes homeless disabled, instead government getting taxpayer money decades make spend, government gets little. 

If person makes $0 rest lives, mean LOT less tax revenue (and economic activity general) make $1,000,000 rest lifetimes spend it. 

And no, talking about. talking about, relevant important. Money spent saving people ends money government LATER, lots times far, far money. working worldwide higher education. pretend Biden sort perfect candidate Trump perfectly-unqualified there's contest. Using aforementioned criteria disqualify Biden candidate would disqualify Trump. That's lying part. 100% believe even Trump could led us pandemic followed plan place Obama exactly strategy Biden likely employ. 100% agreed. actually need something panic about. vast majority population realizes much exaggerated non-deadly is. We'll look back time think, ""Wow let media politicians ruin nation glorified flu..."" coalition like minded umm, let’s call states. group states, holy fuck, united group States America!!

I think we’re come thing. Definitely. live Florida wife school counselor really curious thing county's school back session 3 weeks now. Yet, districts counties away either going back, still fighting delay opening mandatory virtual longer. lot inconsistency across board. initially told us 5% death rate expect millions deaths. 

Trump get credit lowering 0.2% 200k deaths.   It’s literally opposite though. 

He’s one MANY knew coming, facing lone idiot power chose ignore and/or fire all. almost like states America unite somehow common, competent leadership might helped... wonder he’d hunkering ran money food took 5 seconds read explanation. Heir doctorre couldnt said that? 35%-45% people never exposed COVID19 showed cell reaction virus (blood donation samples 2015 2018), popularity theorized due exposure seasonal coronaviruses common cold, believed provide reduction symptom severity COVID19. However, crossover protection *not* enough prevent infections altogether, least two studies proven that. See  Actually let’s hope is.

S8 began heading towards utter catastrophe, ended big threat overblown defeated single night, capital ruler leveled inexplicably deranged daughter previous ruler. basically happily ever after.

I’d welcome fate bad writers inexplicably pull 180 us. also missing fact know virus confers immunity (beyond months) every infection. ya'know, disregard history people instead working makes sense.

Another point missed thing mutates fast. also factors second waves reinfection. Yesterday’s positivity rate 9% Firstly.

The people Germany want Swedish model don’t understand relies upon, don’t appear either. 

Secondly,

the people Germany want Swedish model sure hell aren’t browsing subreddit. would absolutely turned Swedish model TenYearsTenDays spent 4 months fearmongering pretending lack lockdown would lead corpses streets ”in 2 weeks”tm.

Third.

Maybe test capacity million day, million tests day definitely isn’t something happening. wouldn’t 0.8% positive rate million tests day like 1300 cases. 100k-200k reasonable. napkin math based numbers ourworldindata puts somewhere around 163k tests per day, almost exactly par Swedish testing adjusted population.


I want take look cases/100k Europe past 2 weeks tell Swedish strategy isn’t working HERE. I’m encouraging Germany anywhere else, wouldn’t work due cultural factors don’t believe switching strategy willy nilly. I’m saying 5800 deaths achievement either, massive mistake authorities. also massively pro-lockdown pandemic began, still would wanted something similar lovkdowns Denmark, Finland, Norway etc.

Brigading comments posts massive linkdump generally asshole high horse isn’t going make difference Germany. government competent knows doing. authorities Sweden exact same. weird since Trump administration transferred case data quickly reported cases dropped. Even holidays. another source use gauge really is?

EDIT: missing point. data correct, coming wrong conclusion. 

Yes declining, end first wave, businesses, school districts, etc. try return normal numbers rise again.

It’s still super deadly there, lot people looking mortality rate. even people survive COVID cases permanent internal organ damage.  dog CVS day. worker asked could pet him. said no. people go work. Oh wear fine. mean like want keep wearing it. dude cuts check says wear it, wear it.

But cant pay enough think dumb hell. insane level logic. deadly, dont ban driving save lives we?

We ban drunk driving. call deadly taking 10-12k lives, call COVID deadly taking 191,000 lives shorter amount time? Oct 2019 April 2020 CDC estimates 24,000 – 62,000 flu deaths. wear masks then, distance shut things down.

There flu shot significantly decreases risk catching virus; COVID vaccine. COVID also much, much deadlier flu. flu typically leave life-long health problems behind either; evidence every day even asymptomatic COVID infection cause severe permanent heart damage.

Young, healthy people dying virus. stupid. find new hobby NOW. way something new do. Also try find create events/things excited every days, weeks months, depending needs.

Its helped times able stop depressive thoughts like ""oh yes that's coming up. Awesome!""

Not perfect sadly helped.

Edit: sad individual actually downvoted us lol.  civic culture dumbed far faction ""Trump"" ""not Trump."" crowds assemble either, would vapid chant ""U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!"" meaningful rallying cry rather display Homer Simpson's cognitive deficiencies. Yes, ""not Trump"" would professional, setting better tone organizing coherent responses federal agencies. think includes implementing big boy health care policy even straight shooter danger despite pressure kingmakers Wall Street, got dangerously unrealistic expectations ""not Trump"" team. This. worst part. Every fucking coworker talked thinks hoax constantly harp first started, masks said useless. useful now? 

Its mind-boggling. lot rural folks travel big cities work, go back small town boom, cluster. folks live town 3,000 seen played town many nearby ones. Worse yet, lot people like retire area older folks going big city doc appointments, since often consumers Fox sources bad information may think hoax, take enough precautions, bring back.

To certain extent flexibility needed, hand people demonstrating whole we’re horrible dealing shades gray, critical thinking risk management. sucks, socially may need universal rule. ain’t getting now, time long past... are. interesting thing you’re exact thing without realizing pretending flu big deal. 

The flu kills hundreds thousands year, think it’s big deal point use example something big deal. 

It’s honestly incredible get clear example hypocrisy you’ve given. can't tell post low effort, low IQ. Oh wait, one natural result other. I'll give couple years figure comes first. Man, I'm sorry think significant amount people U.S. buy every single thing Trump says, believe sent money, forgive fucking thing, moron. First said masks work enough masks.

I figure said people hoard n95s hospitals still enough them.  Cases per day trending months. fuck talking about? see case rate Springfield? Unbelievable! That's kind get. Like, things legitimately scary OK scared them. Polar bears. Tigers. Deadly viruses. problem specifically people scared be.

Being afraid mean nothing either. means take proper precautions, exactly like said. Fuck, frustrating. report attributed 21,000 of excess deaths lockdown

Oh, mean ONE still unpublished, still peer-reviewed, working paper?

Though favorite source blog run Biscuit Factory author. Plus article author is, seems, primarily photographer, researcher, discernible science background.

About high-quality reading material expect u/etre_be job offer direct deposit, paper checks.

I give ATM check every Friday yeah count November cure COVID. Yeah, legitimately insane. I'm smart enough see nuance, understand cdc's early statements made good reason, cross reference sources going forward. people like grandmother watching fox news 30 years? shit I've finally managed convince Trump actually one acting badly. People seriously underestimate amount conditioning Republicans done anyone listen them. percentages Germans wearing masks supermarkets mar, apr .. aug? Q buses/etc.. things get better, drop guard. time chance mortality work 100% people would stay home borders closed. Hilary bad choice go someone like Trump. much country still sexist already hated Clintons. fact know people voted Trump still think good job makes scared. failed every measure used prior presidents ever. think there's disconnect County Health Department, trying implement policies based evidence &amp; best practices, Board Supervisors, responds pressure various constituent factions. That's Barber backtracked Trick Treating ban, could well push County Health revise policy in-class resumption early November. competing voices &amp; motivations that's seems absurd, really democracy action. Really? don’t know you’re country ravaged pandemic sure seem be. 

Yes. NYC really bad, put bunch measures place, including lockdown, they’re much better. see works?

So that’s one state. Great. 49 do. It’s almost like entire country needs lockdown together beat this, like every country world daily cases control. 

You 38,000 yesterday. 

Fucking r/selfawarewolves Give 2 months Hm. reminded me, need get next paycheck. Think I'll still beat wave. (Hope?) Yes sure, really understand what's unpleasant enough let people die tiny little bit inconfort wearing mask. Personally bought reusable Kanuk version(28$CAD) really confortable passes flame test, maybe need mask? Really third, that's little comfort they're spread allowing game system created people still lived farms. niece virtual learning, every Friday go take test. Guess ? got rona now, 5 kids class room also. What’s real crazy 7 kids class room spread 6 foot apart. sister said 35 mins. Since obviously think corona isn’t big deal sign substitute teacher really think safe person risk serious illness virus get plane full passengers? really think little bits cloth protect them? lockdown wont work anyways. police essential workers work...so virus survive reopen spread. US topping 1000 deaths today again, we’re going American deaths last 3 days 9/11. Nobody seems care talk though, completely numb ignorant numbers believe perpetrating hoax reason? reported independent review panel concluded July M.S. case unrelated vaccine. ive seen really smart people find credible, lets certain wrong conspiritards believe it. France's low death toll intrigues this, tracking 0.2% puts far closer nasty flu 2-3% seeing china italy March.

People say death rate lags france least 3000+ cases day last 14 days, death rate stayed constant 20-30 time.

Which makes wonder measures france taking protect vulnerable people covid treatments using, seem pretty good job blunting impact this. inbred comment I've ever seen. Read Letters American written Heather Cox Richardson. leading American political historian summarizes days news sites sources. It’s right there. Even refuse admit yourself. no, anything numbers inflated currently Women less likely taken seriously doctors research also showed women 50 per cent likely men initially receive incorrect diagnosis experiencing heart attack.

We likely die heart attack this. don’t talk cervical cancer referred “poor women’s cancer.” reason called ie poor women less likely able see doctor. that? women’s healthcare always getting cut. reason women’s healthcare become political. Planned Parenthood (where lot poor women get Pap smears) frequently target smear campaigns. 

Let’s talk reaction mandatory HPV vaccine. mandatory girls, society fit. Women’s sexual healthcare still taken seriously. 

You shove “breast cancer month” bullshit. Hey, let’s talk society SEXUALIZE breast cancer. “Save boobies.” “save women” ?

Let’s talk domestic violence NFL covered up. province Canada thing too, federal government seem providing assistance. people voted Hillary Clinton, despite likeable, etc. real way win pander rich racist, win via electoral college process. contradictory stuff there. 'It didnt like followed...'

Then also points lift restrictions cases climb Europe.

Contradictory. meant gradual turn completely back normal. It’s going take months see effects things gradually completely back normal. still go restaurants stuff want, long proper restrictions depending are. since post talking usa, i’m talking usa shit, really?

They one three conference schools vote cancellation, head coach advocated playing regardless decision wrote letter commissioner asking reverse, state's attorney general advised OSU sue conference force season. would like could sign substitute teacher since don’t care catching corona wait enter pods school teachers lounge recharge? absurd, numbers change streamlined reporting process, look hospitalization rates also declining everywhere except minnesota South Dakota, 5 people South Dakota now, declining too. can't. won't. That's true. 

The increase deaths multiples new cases turned deaths. Florida, Texas, Arizona California big jumps deaths increases cases. 

And ""waves"" apply US. many regions getting hit hard first time. 

And one last thing - think getting confused something. southern part country getting hit hard, number ""cases"" similar northeast got hit months earlier. ACTUAL cases even close that. northeast getting hit, little testing. 

So 30k ""cases"" April 30k ""cases July amount actual infections. number ""cases"" fewer deaths. make mistake, increase cases fact convert increase deaths. Second said ""wear protect others"". 

Repblcans / Trmp supporters: ""Protect others? hate 70% country want die reason, wear one."" collect side effect data (and one already approved acceptable side effect/risk profile). compare side effect frequency two. Would definitely cleaner read true placebo...but we’ll find COVID vaccine common side effects Meningitis C vaccine (pain, redness, swelling, fever etc...), new rarer, serious side effects. 

Ex: multiple sclerosis (MS) occurs spontaneously. big enough sample size enough time detect cases, 2 new MS cases placebo arm 6 COVID vaccine arm, conclude it’s real risk. small sample size don’t give study enough time difference may difficult detect attribute vaccine. smaller sample size bigger difference need statistically significant difference. shorter study time less likely pick rare late side effects. large sample enough time equal number MS cases arm study, you’d conclude wasn’t unique risk attributable COVID vaccine. True causality pretty difficult determine.

Sorry long answer I’m sure I’ve completely answered question. thrown yet another strawman deflect. 

I'm married teacher who, bravery put test, duty students.

Now spit next garbage deflection. Agreed. including hospital also bonus irreversible damage lungs thanks covid never lol. subreddit problem reddit fairly upper middle class depending thread upperclass. lot people site barely smallest concept poverty would different kind poor decision. died last year. sold old home bought new one two years ago get bigger house could split sister/brother law kids would place live close family got old. zero inflation year due COVID. Im sure inflation makes difference 1-2 years. lived budget, comfortably.

Tons family still live there. Mostly tradespeople making 55-65K per year. live tight budget needs met.

This true. Im bullshitting here.

I absolutely idea someone could claim $57K STARTING wage insufficient NYC half NYCs residents make less that. see 50% people streets starving there. 


Edit: Thank you. suck. Alot.  goblin always bitching tv guys always sucking nuts Ok. NYC epicenter America great. But, keep going. either idiot malicious. 300,000. Probably closer 400,000. 

Last 5 years, average number pneumonia deaths per year: 50,000

2020 pneumonia deaths far without counted COVID-19 statistics: also know many people died due COVID-19 tested. It’s appropriate can’t safely follow extremely simple precaution wearing mask find another way travel. Idiots often ignore facts  We'll see said blind man kids lost parents? Jesus! whole family die things get catastrophic families? high school kids work put graduation risk support family. gotta look beyond number deaths see causing major toll whole world depressed. whole different kind great depression. Even Biden wins, would 3 months takes office. We're around 200,000 official deaths right 6 months in; 4.3 months Jan 20, expect 300,000 - 400,000 official deaths (there's probably going surge cases coming months red states completely reopening). Well considering shit death I'd say no. Haha sucked. Best bet vaccine works.

I agree people eventually quit following restrictions....and could lead 100k+ cases day. Maybe inevitable that's route need go? hospital capacity.

There mixed messages throughout this. Remember lockdowns keep hospitals overwhelmed. Pretty good good brain, colleges studies money. That’s type journalism make US deserve Trump. sometimes wished Europeans could vote America's president too.

But realized, rules like that..china would really rule world sooner later. Wrong. Taiwan going 150 days now. Thailand went 101 days. Vietnam went 99 days. Laos, Cambodia, Mongolia gone months well, zero deaths. countries 20, 70, even 100 million people it, couldn’t Sweden? mean “non-sequitur” referencing casualties specific disease teachers attempting avoid? It’s becoming increasingly clear hate teachers whichever ones couldn’t even impart basic comprehension thick skull. Sad thing it’s obvious wasn’t even fault.  pandemic caused respiratory infections. can’t safely wear masks carry spread virus. I’ve always said, Western countries Sweden playing long game. won’t know it’s correct strategy over.

At least picked strategy sticking compared US fuck  Honest question, wear mask restaurant? Distancing effective measure think restaurant since remove mask order eat.   Logic wrong government steal money, right get back. got back whole foods one respite

WHO, accept ""new normal"", stop using phrase. go back normal pandemic over. saying, people die, means additional deaths prevented? ""no additional"" deaths, many millions (without mitigation, would many, many millions extra, preventable deaths)?

Ok, let put way: views outside mainstream ethics morality. Sure lot assumptions me. Sad thing generalize everyone meal restaurant. 

When go grocery store wear mask. work, since Late April, wear mask. generalize want support local businesses (and employees) opening SAFELY. someone (non alcoholic, drink) liver problem started, I'm aware lack treatment damaged organs. truly horrifying virus do.

""It morally defensible decry publicly-funded scholarships, Social Security benefits, unemployment insurance turn around accept them, Rand argued, government taken money force (via taxes). There’s one catch: recipient must regard receipt said benefits restitution, social entitlement.""

There second wave ongoing, infection rates close half peak climbing, action taken _this_ time primarily hits young, resulting whopping 0.6% death rate nationwide (2-3 daily deaths, compared 22 traffic fatalities).

In Sweden, ""official"" lockdown people staying home social distancing anyway. Memes Scandinavian people keeping massive distance best days legendary.

Thank God Mississippi. London though? Hit really hard, would expected maybe bottoming out, - cases rising exponentially again.  
They've confirmed R 1, high 1.7 regions. 
Maybe bump curve due relaxed social distancing may level initial up-tick?

People would died flu season died Covid already 😓😓most flights i’ve seen 2-3 stops :( it’s hard find n95 masks days It’s temporary. real possibility caused vaccine, it'd naive push possibility completely mind too.

Literally sentence after. blatantly said real possibilities. Cali, Newsom done believe best addressing pandemic. He's made mistakes I'm sure. he's pretty honest taken full responsibility. numbers finally coming flattening. ""phased reopening"" pretty conservative. Counties need show certain metrics progress weeks go next phase. Hope works. best do, folks.

I disagree point, best currently done. Highly unlikely official death toll ever gets high admin charge. look up, ankles. talking global deaths, many causes kill millions people. Disease happens. generally worth sabotaging everyone's mental health work lives ineffectual attempt control long horse left barn. 

The Hong Kong Flu killed Americans covid (adjusted inflation) economic catastrophe seeing today. fact, Woodstock. taxes, military police. think thought through, although doubt ability anyway. Yeah get it; sounds like Trump trying alter numbers make look better himself, anyone offer backup, like even circumstantial, crackpot tin-foil hat conspiracy. Considering every western country battling second wave US stuck middle never ending wave...I don’t think anyone criticize Sweden anymore.

Should protected elderly vulnerable? Yes NY/NJ receiving applause handling crisis.

Maybe Sweden played long game here. CSU system already cancelled person classes spring semester well. it’s possible job (i would go later time pressures) point emergency measure control outbreaks


That's literally flatten curve means. soft reset.


What reset? still first wave. reset. August 8th 11.6%, August 15th 11.4%, August 22 10.6%, August 29th 9.5%, September 5th 9.3%...

wtf ""Muaddib""

I get joking, first mention small business I've seen so, hello welcome TedTalk

I'm small business owner, hair salon, I'm financial crisis right now, I'd totally support another lockdown.

People trying convince let take masks appointments, asking discounts, bringing food kids telling restaurants bars they've visited.

I'm seeing clients social media traveling, hosting parties, kids sports masks.

My boyfriend tested positive (asymptomatic) covid quarantine 2 weeks, two clients asked could sneak kids hair 'weren't shaggy go back campus'.

It's insane little people care. ones coming salon anymore, either- even assholes money can't even really afford stay open.

Another lock would perfect opportunity say fuck done. I'd rather work overnight stocker point. 

Sorry rant. 
I'm overwhelmed life business put dog yesterday - seeing pandemic even worse fall made worse. vast majority people won’t pay government back. 

That's incorrect. People pay back time lifetime taxes keep going homeless getting sick. fantastic return investment, actually. replace people children school... unsupervised overweorked underpaid teacher. Probably good idea /s left WF 10 years ago. crooks. Take others advice, go local credit union. “Pugh said thinks coach James would wanted district play football even virus there.”

Fuck superintendent. OK, asked guidelines, are. know airborne disease, know restaurants spreading it, gyms involve lot breathing lot people enclosed space. Fauci changed mind gyms still indoors lots heavy breathing. 150-250 cases Sweden now. precisely, 171 cases per day, on, even increased testing, fewer confirmed cases absolute number week compared last week.

As matter fact, even sure mean small uptick, best week Sweden ever since like March basically started spreading. absolute numbers share tested turned positive.

Just refrence picture last 9-10 week taken link posted left

Week, Number cases, Number tests taken, number positive tests, share positive. laughingabout that? What's wrong you? shut already. 1.) 574 federally recognized Indian Tribes U.S. different. *racist* generalize diverse group people like that, especially done disparagingly. 

2.) Many tribal members *do* struggle poverty health issues. necessarily relevant though. UBI making situation better worse? many factors. 

3.) never suggested ""model"" society Indian Tribes. said studying per cap could useful understanding UBI impact people societies. **You put words mouth could create opportunity disparage Native Americans.**

4.) bet even read far. ""verifiable facts names"" present? blasted generally broad vague statement. birthday end September.

""The interesting thing that, yes, we’ve 100 hospitalizations [of children positive test], look across country, almost half COVID.” even fucking close. masks slow spread never stop it, even eradicating virus. Thats impossible point. 

Masks not, lockdowns not, end herd immunity. Natural vaccine induced. Corona mirror reflects Americans’ selfishness self-centeredness. are. literally can't.

Lol, much fucking sociopath downplay 22 deaths *per day?*

Fucking christ. try therapy.  That’s great idea. Like partition temperature. I’m guessing mean plastic vertical things use markets?

Anyway, house small. It’s open-concept kind space. two bedrooms, dining-kitchen, living room, divided hallway storage area bathroom-toilet. place small enough close doors heat/cool room we’re in. like movie 12 monkeys. Everyone forget outside. Grab hazmat suit go. (I joking it’s funny optic) Vegetables take shitload dirt space. I've experimenting upside-down veggie growing; single tomato plant takes minimum five gallon bucket dirt. tried growing cherry tomatoes one gallon containers, got ten tomatoes per plant.

Tomatoes like worst thing could chosen. use tons dirt compared crops huge resources drains, requiring ample fertilizer, water, sunlight. much output nutritional/caloric output. Also poorly plants bad gardener, sorry break you. Fucking pointless “Racism OK CCP it.” would blown brains out.

Or found nearest person infected sneeze face root problem afraid communism? good answer.

What defending against? We've already open students couple weeks barriers, temperatures taken, ability social distance classrooms (per superintendent masks required social distancing impossible). I'm pregnant nervous I've leaving home since March prenatal care doctor's advice go back work can't give health coverage month giving birth. know people professions gone lot earlier generally risk factors mean get accommodations anyway even doctor's notes, still nerve-wracking adjust to. lol personally would wait till airlines go way down, Costco sounds good tho It’s 1% death lmao. It’s .1%  Good luck contact tracing hundreds events majority people protesting government asking present. whataboutism. complete safety? researchers also found 71% adults Covid-19 74% tested negative reported always using face covering public.

Except time restaurant. Masks work fine even N95s offer 100% protection - especially poorly ventilated space high viral loads present. Masked restaurant workers risk exposure entire course shift patrons sitting unmasked eat/drink sit inhaling contaminated air. Apparently two weeks flatten curve turned wait vaccine.

But people want vaccine take time.

But also won’t take vaccine.

But going wait it.

Two weeks

It might ready 2020. 

But maybe 2021

Two weeks flatten curve Well, rely evidence anecdotal information, can't we? 28,000,000 people worldwide diagnosed infected. far reinfected? I'm hearing Joey Cleveland, Bobby New York City, Billy Dallas. words, far, lot reinfections. virus carried long enough bit reinfections antibodies wear quickly. So, 6 months seem issue. Next stop 1 year. 1½ years. ... Science god ok no, fuck guy already. 🏈 &amp; TIME SELL 🏟️🇺🇸🖕🤷 fucking scary see talk knowledge even scientists admitting time. shows willing admit able think ""Asian people problem"". Hunker Down? long? Why? end goal that? I’m gonna hunker unless absolutely need again. weeks. terrible mental health, lot main hobbies gone, played sport love playing last 15 years since February. yeah. Hunker down. came knowing people would die. great job city keeping rates level hospitals could handle. started let’s flatten curve try save many people possible “hunker down” nothing you’re devil. Either provide us facts, data, processes, plan let us live. I’ll wear mask stay away risk people. hunker down. I’ll go life, social distance can, wash hands, wear mask, live. believe discrepancy reporting, Germany reporting people died pneumonia/cancer/etc whilst covid died covid, whilst UK reported COVID deaths.

Germany’s reported Covid-19 death number much closer amount excess deaths compared UK. people vote comments like mine clearly don’t understand care mental health ramifications situation. else new? country thinks depressed people suck up.  Sentinalese. saw tee title thought might got contact people another tribe. get sentiment, kinda supposed work way far living conditions. human race progress linearly almost history. 

So saying yea things better comparatively past matter relative present U.S example woefully underperforming potential, especially compared developed nations. Biden promises another stimulus check I’ll vote him. beautiful young lady touched lives students sorely missed. Heartbreaking story. Good. We'll herd immunity like Sweden run course would anyway financial support bars recovering NC?

And yeah, president isn’t social distancing anyone else. need to, little sardine oil floor opponents take care problem. Actually states congress make laws respecting religious institutions. easy way would limit religious institution cannot within walls. Active malice haplessness. It’s intentional violence. rich great making poor fight instead banning together bars. dinner Auntie's house. *sigh*  rely Facebook remove approve opinion even it’s stupid one. Use common sense decide believe reject. Yes, isolate edgy people getting permanent mental health damage social isolation.

Huh? thing even exist? guess therapy's right everyone emotional/mental capacity stay home another year. designed live like this.

We *designed* all, evolved.

And yes, we're social animals, better social animal needs little time readjust disaster dead social animal. eaten government issued food? I'm pretty sure would considered cruel unusual punishment breach Geneva Convention. Damn easy lately shame give agree. turn wait vaccine?

So see don’t want hospitals overwhelmed don’t states/cities seesaw it...hospitals start fill up, put restrictions/bring field hospitals. Curve flattens, end restrictions. refuse believe could fully eliminated time found March...our government could set effective test trace contact system mass testing didn’t.

It’s pandemic contained. lot people going die. That’s it. appreciate calling dumb.

OVIEDO, Spain

After tourists cleared first week September, charming coastal town Santoña northern Spain problem.

Authorities detected 64 active coronavirus cases town 11,000 – around one every 171 residents thought infectious.

Unlike areas Spain high infection rate, officials acted fast contain spread. Sept. 2, region placed 14-day lockdown – bars, restaurants hotels closed. one allowed leave enter area non-essential reasons.

But even week town locked down, primary pre-schools opened doors first time since March.

“The whole situation frightening. two ways enter town —one concrete road block police permanently other, stopping everyone leaves enters town. It’s like something movie,” Davide Lacasella, father three school-aged children region, told Anadolu Agency.

“If things bad, would government want us send kids school?”

Although Santoña’s schools opened Monday, turnout first day dismal. 805 registered students, around 30 showed up. Lacasella joined majority kept children home.

Parents keep children home consistent basis risk breaking Spanish law, requires everyone ages six 16 attend classes. Lacasella’s case, homeschooling online classes options.

“My wife teacher, know aren’t many safety measures. windows don’t open way, buildings old classrooms small. Everything organized last-minute. parents respiratory problems…It’s difficult situation. don’t know do,” said.

Though Santoña extreme example, illustrates Spain’s enthusiastic push get students back physical classrooms despite one highest known rates COVID-19 infections world.

‘Schools safer’

Over last two weeks, Spain confirmed 110,000 new SARS-CoV-2 infections. per-capita basis, daily detected infections higher Spain hard-hit countries like United States, Brazil Peru.

Yet South American countries, schools generally remain closed education moved internet, televisions radios. US, hundreds schools reopened doors, many places, including large cities, instead opting online education, least infection rates fall.

In Spain, power hands regional governments, almost every school set open physical doors students month – pre-schools universities.

When asked last week return school would safe, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said “yes” without hesitation.

“Zero risk doesn’t exist terms epidemiology, one risk remove – risk social exclusion due unequal learning environments,” told radio station SER.

“I believe parents, children teachers sure much safer schools places.”

The measures make Spanish schools safe vary slightly within region. rule, students must wash hands frequently, six wear masks. Mixing classes groups discouraged class sizes slightly smaller. Likewise, schools told ramp ventilation disinfecting measures.

Some high schools universities opting blended learning approach, classes in-person others online. exceptions, full distance learning options exist educational centers weren’t already online-only.

Until scenario “uncontrolled transmission”– threshold defined – students obliged go school, although individual classes groups could forced confinement case infections.

Yet leading international bodies still say opening schools high levels community transmission dangerous.

“The reality virus spreads easily. Opening without control recipe disaster,” said World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week press conference.

“If schools reopened areas high levels community transmission, major outbreaks inevitable deaths occur community result,” said Zoë Hyde, epidemiologist University Western Australia Perth paper published science journal Nature.

The suggests country cannot consider coronavirus control less 5% tests come back positive. Spain, rate positive PCR tests around 11%, Spain’s chief epidemiologist Fernando Simon said Monday.
-

“In way, Spain’s return schools big experiment. Perhaps we’ve rushed would wiser wait. I’m saying forever. want see children back school, worst scenario reopen soon close many outbreaks,” Dr. Daniel Lopez Acuña, former director WHO’s Health Action Crises Recovery Transition Programmes professor Andalusian School Public Health, told Anadolu Agency.

He insisted viral spread Spain homogenous risk considered based density viral spread community, particularly acute regions Madrid, La Rioja, Basque Country Navarra picking across country.

“In places high incidence, measures, like masks, may enough.”

A squandered summer

Although Spain’s plan return classroom sold government safe way achieve social equality, others suggest result poor planning.

The Ministry Education crafted bulk back-to-school guidelines June, Spain managed push infection rates exemplary low level months strict lockdown.

“The Ministry Education regional governments planning scenario totally unrealistic. end August, issues high rates infection obvious. problem is, beginning September late reasonable professional planning academic year,” said Fernando Trujillo, professor language education University Granada, led study education Spain pandemic.

Educational guidelines updated Aug. 27, leaders reconvened summer holidays, fundamentals remained same.

Despite influx money pandemic response schools, Spain recovered consistent investment education pre-financial crisis levels, according latest data 2018. Trujillo suggested exacerbated problems terms hiring teachers, purchasing digital devices reducing class sizes.

“The pandemic is, sense, pedagogue teaching us important problems society. one important problems – educational system obviously underfunded. far countries Western Europe, limits capacity respond important problem like pandemic,” told Anadolu Agency.
-

According Trujillo, last-minute planning scenario high infection rates major source stress educational community.

“Without instructions norms, can’t adjust issues like building timetables curriculum design. lack planning provoked worst emotional situation parents teachers could – teachers totally depressed parents totally worried.”
-

Trujillo said worst problems related digital gap, caused many disadvantaged students Spain fall behind online classes last spring, could addressed mainly ignored due determination return business-as-usual extra safety measures.

""The pandemic could real turning point Spanish education... regional governments worked improve, others seem like they’re waiting miracle even want get bad point fingers central government,"" said Trujillo.

""Education politics may complex, viruses rather simple – give opportunity replicate open schools bars, that’s exactly they’ll do."" charge nobody would died

Fewer people would died made fun people wearing face masks, that's certain.

I also think initial failure test anyone take threat seriously huge outbreak happened New York City, probably would better presidency. Wow. born raised US, Texas culture shock me. can’t imagine exchange student. Let us hope end half bad GoT Season 8 Literally said Russia bad lmao read See, that’s better :) Outdoor protests least likely transmission 

Indoor church singing likely want see fuckers responsible dragged street end this. hit critical mass (chain reaction point) start killing large numbers. Thats must controlled. No, actually worked Spanish flu recommendation experts. know, people actually know they're talking about. Sorry we're listening neckbeards yourself. need shut whole year. needed enforce social distancing mask wearing possibly shut certain businesses (like bars). decent society would support businesses forced shut down. according logic people (GOP) preventing us getting relief bill get voted power we're less likely get another stimulus check? Please tell I'm misreading comment. think two major points are:


* people indoors areas get cold winter, increase transmission, therefore increasing amount people would die it.


* Fall/Winter flu season, get flu COVID one time, making risk serious complications death higher. They've trying kill middle class. dead already. MURRICA HUNKER DOWN, NERDS!  dropped Chase reason. capital one now, debit credit. minimum set checking/savings get interest back 2 months ever got chase 5 years. Exactly! sick doctor doom. say anything get TV. basically deaths higher normal time year, lower flu season, weeks flu season begins really fucked. Especially think much people cough sneeze cold flu season overlaps end fall allergy season beginning spring allergy. Cold Flu season also takes place colder weather people cardiac, vascular, pulmonary issues tend much higher death rates. “Should be”.

Then outbreak occurs he’s scolding us nightly news. 
I actually like guy need better guidance “should be”. recently learned Germany different states/Länder responsible well. However, people seem enough consistency people following recommendations.

Similarly Sweden always gets pulled anti-lockdown success mandate. However, people followed best practices safety voluntarily government made easier people symptoms stay home.

How much US less due political system topic politicized, especially president? Freedom kill grandparents result misinformation read Facebook opposition expert opinion pretty much every epidemiologist world.

Truly, American way. get flu shot, get $5 spend CVS anything prescriptions. I've thinking range resistance COVID population. people get ventilators worse. get sick like flu, get better without hospitalization. I'm told 40% symptom-free. imply people total resistant.? seems big. needs independent voters win everything power force away True, spread don’t see much hurting, don’t care. Makes sense NYC got things control went though. Umm, no. stuck loop rolling lockdowns quarantines.

Meanwhile, Sweden, pandemic almost over. 🇸🇪 Oh yeah, since believe 48 different genders

Which one you? underestimated 2016. can't naive make mistake twice. Biden currently leading substantial numbers. No, magical news story exists /u/BarcodeIlIllIlIlBoye 's computer. one else read it. Even comment thread illusion. exist, man! There's dying? global death toll almost 1 million almost 200,000 US alone. Thats 2 months 9/11 happening every day 2 months. Give head shake mate. many idiots America shown amount excess covid cases Yeah there's concerted effort part information transmission institutions last 40 50 years expressly uneducate radicalize vast swaths country. actually nation exceedingly stupid people right now. fault, relentlessly anti anything resembles accepting real. That's non-starter. There's way fix system within rules system stands.

Edit: apologize op parent comment, used word 'but', misunderstood truth value statement we're totally agreement.  map us colleges universities Yea elite weird child abuse rituals added weird pedo art people think satan behind it. reality pedos pedo shit. Diplomatic travel still allowed. International trade hasn’t affected. I’m NZ another country took seriously yes, means welcoming thousands deaths sick citizens, sustainable long term. buy plastic face shield/visor? Since virus travels mainly air, droplets blocked travel gap chin right? Sorry bud, orange apple. grape blueberry. agree fruit beneficial, also completely unnecessary sugar like banana. proven things necessary stop mitigate losses. Instead America try tank damn thing.

Our lives dont matter country. Return investment = Busy work? drunker people, better socially distance. something like really, reopened schools 10 days ago exponential growth cases since mid August Yeah, speaking quietly? Americans doomed. That's good joke, true. Discount prices encourage people buy more. people good time buy more, buy extras, tip better. Yeah, literally can't. play sports teams 24 people can't go groups 6 people? fucking lunacy. Governments even know they're doing. Old fat people stay home. Indoor growing way complicated making be, growing food indoors new thing. dirt need deep enough roots space grow also need enough space plant grow tall enough.

Then can't use normal light's, need full spectrum (admittedly get away using LEDs produce spectrum plants use), people lying around. lights need vast majority day least going cost whole lot power run them.

Then need load water plants grow, there's reason vertical farms usually hydroponics setups, that's also going cost money either need lot work water constantly setup whole irrigation system. decide go hydroponics (which although use half water use 0 water suitable lot plants) that's entire cost, plus need make sure water right acidity crops growing, even using soil need check even complicated hydroponics there's natural nutrients, need know nutrients add yourself.

Then there's power heating, heating room expensive insulating entire thing also entire project own.

There's way people already struggling feed afford this. extra water electricity costs alone, let alone infrastructure. course renter's allowed rental agreement let run indoor farm, potential water damage alone enough stop you, there's way even coolest landlords let permanently specially insulate entire room.

Even afford even they're renting there's issue still going least 2 months anything come up, potential crops failing(which likely, probably first time they've grown anything). need able grow enough actually feed themselves, bigger problem think, feeding family winter takes lot space do. people room big enough. Even people grow vegetables hobby rarely eat grow, people happen farm(and willing grow variety crops) supplement grow buy. 

Then there's fact police 100% assuming running weed farm, house suddenly bought stuff need grow weed, uses several times amount water normal, uses lot electricity normal, got entire room specially insulated suspiciously hot room. Expect least knock door worst full swat raid. Wow you’re true pos pandemic, cute postcard enough. deaths don’t matter then? Look US compared 35 deaths Vietnam. WOULD ""a weeks"" start, GOVERNMENT TOLD US wear masks.

I get it. needed preserve masks healthcare workers. told us ""too dumb know wear N95 masks"" said masks useless. officials KNEW failed contain virus, put burden people. us (where live, least) we're told. we're still able contain it's... literally impossible.

People angry really know who... look things news virus. feel like drives culture war way things do, that's thing want part time like this.

If anything angry person charge this. two months change that. Good follow damn rules damn father brings racist card well definitely profit new found fame. see book deal future? undoubtably much gain staying public eye I'm American, European. take whatever vaccine country approves widely distributes. General Kenobi! good thing come year, skipping holidays agree awesome situation anyway cut it, reporting heard briefing attended. I'd hope teachers given resources can, I'm wary happen You’re right whole place whack downvoting common sense anyone fill what's happening Pakistan? new cases positivity rates dropped considerably since peak, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, etc cases still rising? Yeah, feeling??? also find virus canals Europe Spring 2019 something?

NO  testing Second wave starts Europe 

In parts europe caring mean. Germany still well. really appreciated reference Socks reading thread. rightly shat posting unsubstantiated rumors like dangerous messed Facebook (a money making corporation) decide censored. decisions impact society huge scale zero accountability.  Somehow people urge travel pandemic Complete safety. Pakistan also deserves nuclear weapons, Jets protection Pakistani terrorists International sanctions mention China shamelessly dragging Kashmir UN Security Council agenda every month shamelessly telling countries meddle Hong Kong, Xinjiang Tibet  France, 10 000 cases daily, college still open, one teacher got virus yesterday, still open, classes mandatory, need physically attend them.
Sigh... Sigh harder... Denmark Finland shown acknowledge heavily improved Swedish infections situation. 

Meanwhile Norway: open Värmland - close Värmland - open Jämtland - close Jämtland - open Värmland - close Norrbotten - close Värmland (etc). 

All 22/100k new infections 14 days, compared Sweden's 24/100k. definitely tricky situation there- options appear pretty bad. So? People support Trump still work  Almost forgot leading infectious disease expert country 12 year old socialist /s family seems intent still meeting grandmother's usual Thanksgiving. Three families traveling across country different locations meet tiny condo eat together 91 year old cancer survivor.

I love grandmother relatives God horrible idea.

The worst part even object go everyone else still could end getting number sick may never see again. True. least 8,500. looked sugar content grapes? fruits created equal. XD Fed puts trillions stock bond markets, investing class gets richer, ordinary working people lose life savings trying survive... time little schools rest friends, i.e. 500 billion loans businesses. despite reddit circlejerk schools major vector infection. far likely result holiday makers throughout August anything else.  Australia here. really sure general vibe there. saying Trump actually chance winning? 

If so, please explain? audio leak sealed fate loser already?

And yes answer. Australia take Americans... long covid free. even jab free vaccine upon arrival prob. never find body think son god.  matter lot. go detailed discussion Corona thread. spent last six months wasted Canadian govt assistance, liver trying crawl asshole. went 20k person concert NYE Louisville, kind concert people come around country share water, joints etc... people community forums right lockdown started claiming got super sick event, put ventilators etc diagnosis. hindsight thought covid. Tbf one knew personally enough people thread. would make sense though. It’s contagious long incubation period healthy young people surviving time first probably idea. 

I also coworker whose 45 yo otherwise heathy uncle randomly died desk back January, wonder could covid too. many questions still. referring active case count Worldometer/coronavirus, graph totally wrong misleading

The ""recovered"" case counted France actually count people leaving hospital. never admitted hospital first place, never leave never ""recover""... makes graph totally broken.

This people seems never recover. artifact wrong interpretation data.

The french governement tracker : green number ""retours à domicile"" mean people went back home hospitals. number total confirmed case - retours à domicile number active case Worldometer.

So basically way counted number active case never go down.

I agree points though. actually open question. genuinely know impaxt school closures spread (but early studies suggest little), however lot evidence massive increases children need, huge decrease referrals social services children unknown long term effect learning, development mental health.

It's simply clear closing schools right decision moment probably never clear. Oregon! Washington!

And we're going Washington DC take back White House! 

Oh wait, wrong context. maybe fits 2020 too. hope? Lol shout Sumner! HELP. ...and axe? need cash deposits, open fee free Ally account fully waived atm fees pretty high interest. get married parents siblings now. big ceremony next year. Welp work Finally Weird included stimulus check August proposal believe Germany far icu/hospital beds per capita countries. know Spain France etc large part transmission UK happening hospitals, early youd imagine Germany would fair lot better small decrease r0 makes large difference cases near 1 already North Germany checking in. kissing beforehand Corona. Completely different France Corona. I’d like know differences approach contact tracing testing. think also big factor. Maybe churches give back money took?

Ba-hahahahah!!! 7 months since covid. still can't breath right. Short breath time. Can't walk shops without feeling like ran race. 

I'm really getting fatigued stage. Eventually big word. Everyone i've talked said get vaccine...they want wait see... know. would call local health department see resources available. would also check see local group therapies available. Many times, places like Planned Parenthood help - even male. PPH isn’t women. 

I also shoes. I’m reaching out.  worry man escaping need quit eventually. Republicans want stimulus checks all. That's Democrats agree plan. 5 hour delay fetching comments.

We _have_ accepted it. nothing acceptance. everything goal never stop that, overwhelm hospitals. 

No shit. can't stop thing vaccine Governor Walz’s YouTube channel listen press conferences since mid-March. That’s message here. 

These claims made:

* spread gyms city. 

* following rules state case spread

_How_ fuck watching press conferences supposed prove either points? **Do even direct reference** show “lockdown there’s vaccine” message LA County. Dept Health provides information briefings seeing spread also website. It’s gyms salons it’s restaurants space tables enforce mask rules capacity rules. 

Judging spreads actually happening frequently locations less obvious measure (e.g., gym salon) requires far many resources time actually produce meaningful study with.

Provide direct link supports claim.

The department health's goals politically aligned institution, ergo _agenda_ hence argument littered uncontrollable bars college campuses family gatherings. around 5% positivity rate acceptable.

Rate per what? Day? Relative what? city population? State? many city? What's density? asymptomatic cases? many people tested don’t want need government continuing shut businesses. Start penalizing people won’t wear mask. 

Holy fucking shit like I'm speaking teenager. actually _knew_ 
how ineffective shown bother suggesting it. There's tons reasons punishing businesses follow rules. 

Sorry, world operate way. needs many outweigh needs few. 

Quit pathetic whining. going help close you.

The latter implies _capable_ looking world perspective promotes agenda operates interests. Every damn time.

Aha... no... wins, take us want experience past four years next four years. That's moron speaking like moron. nothing left lose chains. There's also sub long covid: r/Long_Covid.

Don’t hold back Instagram. 14 days x nt$1,000 per day = nt$14,000 US$480. Different cost living, government also offers foodstuffs. happy entertain explanation might this. Odd (not really) try offering one. go pound sand, Fauci. psychopath thrives terror putting fear us lowly plebeians. Bollocks pre destined “2nd wave” bollocks lockdown (which conveniently benefits tyrants power).

Gotta love bystander greatest upward transfer wealth history, destroying small businesses livelihoods, thanks unelected official’s word subject change whim. Bollocks WHO, CDC, Fauci, tyrants power toasting drinks laughing suffer. true pandemic. handlers? that.

Rather, humility value others yourselves, looking interests interests others. deadly, dont ban driving save lives we? Oct 2019 April 2020 CDC estimates 24,000 – 62,000 flu deaths. wear masks then, distance shut things down. around 18,000,000 – 26,000,000 medical visits didnt worry overwhelming hospitals, called people selfish going contracting flu we? Maybe part flu chain one point killed grandma? deadly pre existing conditions elderly people Don’t listen biology teacher, teach physical education long you’re working mind body soul fine. dumbest thing Trump President probably could gotten whole nation board national policy. Clinton, Republican states would told eat dick. Trump, Republican states worship much would done anything him. Democrat states already implementing policies. Honestly, “surge” 6 months long, hospital systems ICUs aren’t overwhelmed, we’ve actually done damn good job dealing virus. Yeah, they're straight wrong. Growing rural America half social interactions restaurants, churches, walmart. That’s bingo We’re literally depressed, dude clearly talking two different set demographics. seem forget people very, used seeing handling death. funeral homes thing, people would display dead know call ""living room."" quite aware point, however. 

People shut know cope. Coping mechanisms come learning situation in. people decide that, due immaturity/ignorance/lack education, yes, happen, however everyone. emotionally immature/ignorant/or less educated far likely that.

Hey, stating something ""sound nice,"" people make make untrue. unpopular. 

I know plenty people fine following best practices. fram special unicorns. However, one them, general, took time understand reality ramifications 1 100 year pandemic back January-March. people that, usually reasons already outlined. lockdown, cannot second wave disease relative immunity achieved. Jesus Christ people parrots actually get investigate virus learn much authorities (Fauci, CDC, handful mayors, etc) lied us. already know Fauci lied. already know states lying death rates, already know testing abysmal inaccurate many false positives.

I'm guessing actual, real death rate 50-80k range, 85%+ last year life. agree happens lot. Someone sees study report narrow finding people jump extrapolate mean something incredibly broad game changing. I'm German. annoyed US constant ""fake happiness"" small talk. can't enter shop without employee rushing towards smile. always tempted take step back say ""Lady, offense, I'm buy shirt, make new friends."" would super rude, go ""Oh, great, you? =)"" roll eyes finally leave alone. riots stop now? yet inevitable appointment backlogs fuckwits local community facebook slagging health professionals lazy workshy accusing long holiday much thanking NHS. stupid ungrateful public are- Thank service think clear cut that. Last heard Astrazeneca one pregnant women trials. Pfizer lesser extent Moderna probably problems solve storage distribution. Pfizer two candidates picked tolerated one phase III that's encouraging. Good thing told us wear masks.

And come DiDNt kNoW mAsKS wOrK. never believable first place, totally untenable since Woodward tape proves administration knew airborne early February. weirdest thing painting black +yellow = green. Yeah, case phase movie ""that one expert"" already assembled rag tag Team outcasts assumed control. I'm talking fauci. I'm condoning thinking right experts make one hero. That's probably worst Hollywood trope ever. one supposed care cuz president (r d) administration usually take advice account addressing situations. since someone decided downplay publicly trash talk Fauci anyone going along lie, attention brought name others. Fauci job normal. fact he's listened 180,000 dead noteworthy Well that's going happen let's move states handling themselves. completely misunderstanding point scale things happen even comparable NYC metropolitan areas. add this, listed, probably 1-3 establishments rural American town. NYC one block. 

You also glossed point towns rarely people going out. cities hit hardest either travel destinations hubs travel. COVID didn’t start fucking tool Literally nothing said lie. ignorant Biden's history?  reaction President downplaying severity. consider may worse upplayed it.... fun fact: spamming message make right, makes violation Reddit's rules. Seriously? seeing nearly everybody expressing gratitude measly check? Believe want. Belief powerful thing. suddenly care mental health schooling. That's know know BS. western world gotta live 9 euros per day moment since got laid off. Dirt cheap ass. send million thank cards hanging there? reddit political thought ever made. parody.  You’re absolutely correct. Ty updating me. checked couple weeks ago saw literally every single country flat month+ assumed stay way. Unfortunate. Fuck idea.

-The Zissou Society  Yeah value states rights extreme detrimental whole. certainly one cases. 50 states operating like little countries front. Make stop? man White House making jokes, tweeting videos, quips, even saying press White House lawn deserves two terms? almost flu COVID hardly even distinguishable different illnesses...  Fauci needs get head examined.

The reason 'prolonged' 'surge' happen states/cities once. First Northeast, 2-3 months later Sunbelt, Midwest, followed plain states. fall see additional surges cities/regions hit hard yet.

Each place gotten hit hard though saw similar pattern: cases went back 2-3 months. process first implement modern concept human rights previously existed minds philosophers created one freeest successful societies human history. Shit intentions want, take away did. people never received said money, I'm still waiting. still trying compare two?!?!?! bullshit 

.. mean global pandemic that's killed 1,000,000 people? surge?? someone fire guy? trying hard keep job? funny every state case number declining it’s almost nonexistent part country. He’s making us fool one them? grand rounds interested ship sailed. excited. know honest IFR less 1% bunch 18 like 0 chance dying, young people 35 seldom die. 

That means death rate people 35+ probably much higher 1% young pull average history teacher, children ruined. tell gives ruins rest life paying nursing home. old people actually selfish this. live Mosc-... mean Missouri. Sadly, always ""what if"", we'll never know. would probably better, trump ignores Fauci..... yeah mean models assume candidates seditious don’t want take word it, take CDC’s. Although always recommend checking everything yourself.


They say “Provisional death counts weighted account incomplete data.” sure, don’t want check yourself, take CDC’s word it. Although recommend following get feel it. fucking cases plummeting!? Hospitalization rates talking 1% per day. GTFO. need money most. told you, begging food troll.   
You ain't getting none! Apparently heard children lingering life-long heart issues asymptomatic covid infection. listened ""recovered"" patients still enduring many neurological symptoms respiratory issues.

At point think confident assume feel hit you, OK. know enough disease yet, know sneaky beast keeps dragging infected lower lower, even ""recovered"" find got lifelong issue aftermath. follow myself. confirm increase wrong act like doesn't. already showed see point again, clear actually care facts respected ""lockdown flatten curve"" 6 months, I'm signing ""lockdown get vaccine may may ready end year."" I'll keep wearing mask socially distancing, I'm going back living normal life. art compromise chance Trump gets re-elected. Meh, can't worry every grain sand might work way underwear. I'd rather enjoy life. Right? whole sub like bizarro world.  Positive tests trending down. They're relative April/May, percent positive way down. understand states mask requirements. crazy me. elected billionaires afford pay enough election officials make look like fairly.

That's just... dumb. electoral college system legally rigged favor rural areas. I’ll admit use one I’m working outside, let’s still promote normalize I’m nowhere near anyone 100 degree heat. proper masks indoor close quarters. used listen news radio every morning became thing every day listen podcasts. Every morning topic coronavirus (and we’re handling properly), trump, racial injustice, protesting, people work. know things already, longer felt like “news”. Well Michelle Obama tried pushing schools healthy nutrition plan. pretty good plan. people complained already normalized kids eating sugar pizza rather vegetables fruits. 

Oh, nutrition plan got started. current Administration reversed earlier year Michelle’s birthday. Yesterday.... realize dangerous political whole COVID thing is. Pelosi get hair salon owner's fault exposing her, fuck criminal grandma killer wants get haircut!

Its over. COVID over. Nobody cares anymore. Nice try lies deceit damn obvious, combined fact basically bad flu we're authoritarian bullshit anymore. study come last week thin neck gaiters actually worse wearing mask is. issue people works with, vast majority people he's telling ""hunker down""... Well, fucking can't. agree. know government expect people stay can't provide. People need survive go work. get coming from. feel too. continue stay home, go necessary mask vaccinated know fact cannot spread it. me, fact could unknowingly infect contribute infecting vulnerable person ends ventilator dead. Whatever overall death rate, contributed even one serious fatal case could prevented, unacceptable me. lot parents can't stand around kids full time certain ages.  saw party dozen walking birthday cake restaurant. Selfish fucking pricks. sound like selfish, self involved person around good luck guess bad anyone get sick along way. Generations paying inflation lack purchasing power. Currently getting “thank you” pay, puts around $20/hr. Definitely grateful, still isn’t enough live own, certainly comfortably. 

Thinking going work. I’ve taken days honestly, shit never gonna end. buddy took three months starting April, expecting somewhat settled. people retail heart conditions nightmare. isolation ""hunker down"" imply you? Yeah, common knowledge France one worst world anti-vaxx likely medical misinformation well. hear ya, short term millions around world jobless now. Way long term symptoms. easy answer but, focusing disregarding huge segment population that's go broke. seems like scale off.

Edit: say certain life long effects covid rare. Asymptomatic mild symptom people 98% covid. literally talking .5% people get lingering issues still give fuck countries acting like months now.

France Tour de France fucks sake. Germany everything still canceled foreseeable future.

I know accurately recoveries tracked France never brought active infections *really* down. France never went 50k. Germany came around 5k active infections. 
France lock hard long enough mask mandate came way waaay late. rocket science really, predictable **preventable** five biggest countries Europe -- Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Spain -- less 100 deaths per day combined. ten times more. Poor countries like Vietnam Thailand single digit *cases* per day, rarely record deaths. 
 
Countries shut cooperated great. 
 
You guys refused cooperate, saying stressful exhausting cooperate cooperate six months ago. That's extremely disingenuous. ones dishonest here. Actually twice Turkish culture. believe Switzerland three times. far know- immunocompromised...and i'm telling stay inside.

so- completely different. many dead? many seriously ill? assuming said shutdown forever? lack logic baffles me. 

The solution bad reopens redo correctly. Shut down, actually reopen measured way masks, social distancing, testing, contact tracing etc. Many parts US haven’t done anti maskers France indication, country may screwed reopening too. article... tribune, India, data spread general U.S. population range 0.05% 1%.

With another gem Also, Dr Anthony Fauci earlier estimated fatality rate coronavirus 2 %. 

Here actual data extremely page last updated Thursday, September 10, 2020 03:52 PM EDT.

Mortality Analysis, John Hopkins University Medicine. would say reliable source tribune india concerned data US.

Here's excerpt interesting Guess beer party? incapable containing persuading nefarious comply.

I think two issues - could contained first got (but even act like trying), cannot now, put burden citizens and, despite majority supposed to, continuously get message we're apparently enough people comply. blame us something that's fault. Same. deep freeze full enough supplies 6 months. France Spain look right now? locked they're still spiking.

I'm proud NYer. right, reopened right. Fauci might right rest country care. care home. That's NY

And states borders moron. Agree entirely, numbers see published accurately represent cases (positive negative), number tests, number deaths even WH took over. Now, absolute joke. Baltimore Sun article written John Hopkins calling Maryland's Gov fabricating Maryland COVID numbers; unsurprisingly, wanted re-open schools person, naturally ya gotta make sure parents think overall positivity rate 5%!? Welp Hopkins said, YEAAAA, no! positivity rate slightly 5% bit. can't trust numbers longer. self isolating much possible. point I'm ready let people die get with.

It seems want! life hard stressful care everyone else everyday seems world care me.

I'm sorry. I'm happy world anymore. supposed feel? guys feel? Fear substitute education. understand need close listen guy speak risk infecting hundred/thousands.

Because people give less even still attend gotta make money. think problem never got majority even course first place, working. Forced isolation??? fuck living? Literally nowhere locked forcing people stay home. Stop melodramatic. LBUSD , virtual learning least January 28th. like I'm afraid flu, I'm afraid getting corona girlfriend teachers aid school LA asthma. They’re making come person menial bullshit (even though kids virtual) unions aren’t really shit protecting long run. T2 diabetes gets sick, god forbid, great risk. wife teacher I’m honestly scared death everyday. ready delivered two different things unfortunately. America, money can't made it, happen. That's happens government literally bought operates like boardroom corporation.

🤷🏻‍♂️

People gotta start voting man get it, long term effects. Less 1% fatal...less 1% serious life long issues.

This literally new disease. months data can't say certain lifelong effects rare. *There long-term studies.* know people recovered displaying serious, concerning symptoms may long-term. keep eye that. meantime, get sick.

I've person twenties sitting cardiologist's waiting room people 3 times age. good time. That’s Floridian! right current state COVID. 

IF hunkered places... we'd still COVID, bad is.

We can't nice things bc people needing exercise ""freedoms"".

I'm this. What? even related anyone said? Millions unemployed going hungry. sounds like someone likes hide explosives shoes would say! tested 48 hours boarding flight Schengen Area U.S., least last checked. little chance roommate catching COVID plane. forgotten this. understanding though applies cases? Still better nothing. 5.5 million people US, two years *is* rest lives. Ahh yes, international symbol idiocy.  teacher 25 years. took medical retirement five years ago due cancer. able go back, couldn’t. extremely high risk. think around 60 teachers died spring NYC. data collected, it’s hard accurate. confusing IFR CFR. article posted thing. IFR CFR thing. CFR number deaths confirmed cases. IFR number deaths cases. keep saying ""they revised number down."" That's wrong. CFR reported 2-7% range that's data cases, testing poor. 
 
Here study way back March 13th estimating IFR (""death rate"") 0.66% China. reason year instead ""a weeks"" live society people refuse right thing. *would* weeks months everyone wore mask, followed rules, kept parties bars short time. 

There rationality here. People predictable, neither pandemics. fluid events things change. means love it? don’t. would anything go back office. may get part time job get house. everyone. I’m sorry want can’t always it. like telling I’m selfish wanting kids someone else can’t them. talking asymptomatic people spread virus without knowing ? maybe reach heard immunity faster think can’t imagine shopping Whole Food’s food bars this.

The entire country pauses 28 days. Every household would get food delivered National Guard Postal Service. Everyone stays home, kids learn home, parents work home get to.

The others cannot given 2,000 month. Place burden companies report ability WFH prevent fraud. Hold accountable.

Nearly every business shut down, everyone stay home, everyone eat, survive. foreign travel banned. air train travel paused. Line vaccine country track win.

In 28 days, take case load next zero minimal impact country slowly return normal life. Maybe vaccines usually take years testing approved one seems rushed! You’re talking reddit, bots socialist 12 year olds idea many people would give anything work home? Esp healthcare workers like myself.  mean...wow. worried ""lost generation"" kids miss educational opportunities -- equally worried ""lost generation"" elderly literally die result schools reopening?

And losing parent/grandparent/family member covid WAY traumatizing missing another year school. Let's real here. faced two really depressing options. want choose one keeps people actually alive. need keep schools closed, safe reopen. Fauci says: “Corona virus spread soon”.


Y’all praise tf anything Fauci says matter obvious is. point bragging state proves point disorganized rabble country never full national lockdown like civilized western countries done. guys like insane exhibitionist wears hat one day next wears socks day wears mittens. crazy witness. states lock give shit time like wtf doing? guys interstate borders. joke. I’d gladly give next two years means won’t permanently damaged rest life.

Some y’all never given freedom shows. India's population U.S. Brazil put together. India 3,600 cases per 1M people U.S. 16K per 1M people. Somebody asked go birthday today I'm like well thanks asked why. Like? *gestures wildly everything* say, seriously considering moving Northeast (right mess amping up, actually). Setting aside crazy housing prices (even obviously low-income/low population areas) fact radiant heat seems norm (I guess natural gas hard come by?) huge detraction. less efficient, much expensive, dangerous (forced air vents likely cause second degree burns).

Worse heating oil option, (as priced it) least half expensive natural gas pay now. heating costs housing costs, I'd hard pressed move without excellent paying position relocating. Bernie's home state (which suffering deficiency younger, able bodied workers offers state grants folks relocate there) prime example.

To avoid wholly digressing, issues country really fall back greed. can't affect much lasting change effectively eliminate ""benefits"" greed - aka power, privilege, profits (monetary otherwise) extreme greed offers rewards. 

We can't take greed mankind. best eliminate benefits thereof human civilization though. suggesting working? I'd argue that, economy mental health suffering addition us ""no strategy."" people 30s 40s dying, mean random. individuals made die others symptoms all?

This ""stay course"" mentality bullshit causing lot problems needless suffering. wish want people would like do, happen. different strategy needed. $1,500 AUD per fortnight, paid Federal Government via peoples employers. 

There impact hours/income eligible. 

They also increased income people looking work, removed 'activity test' (i.e. actually applying jobs moment). 

These slowly tapered March next year. would call idiot deny you. Florida: ass wart America. Imagine privileged moron can't even conceptualize damaging forced isolation people, especially previously vulnerable mental health issues solution shut down, remain shut down, never stop shutdown? 

That definitely seems better 0.05% population dying, much less protect weak elderly.  death rate shockingly continues go it’s less even half percent.   
   
If told get room 200 people told us *""one going die""*, well that's game want play.  Would you? Biden smart, begins planning shut entire country month February.

First start creating society individualistic assholes care themselves, muh property, muh rights. obvious solution problem. Like Texas girl showed party covid🤣 mental exercise, grocery store shut today, opened 2 weeks, almost amount edible food? Sure, produce meat good - can't live crackers weeks? go bank many branches area Starbucks. SOMEONE paying branches. Good them. pass opportunity watch defending super bowl champs mean November 4th? world Trump, don’t know?

People always going die models initially provided. Listen keep day, actually providing sources actual logical conclusions ""it's really bad, buy things!"" mentality. 

And speed responses, kinda glaringly obvious reading it. 

SO! basically compelling evidence

Just literally means vikingprincess knows exists, screams LA LA LA LA plugs ears. 

No compelling evidence

WHAT FUCK compel you, Karen?  can't complwte safety anywhere home. maybe point resturants main place masks removed. 

also wondering future lawsuits employers ask see credit card statements see ate possibly contracted there. would add vitamin D. research keeps coming favor Vit supplementation given immunomodulatory effects. [what Short answer: There's consensus yet. Experts bit confused. course. Republicans made sea could blame Democrats compromising? great news wish use Covid push agendas. Hhhhmmmm,



My experience poor takes things around. poor Country fear rich saw Last recession. 


Not mention mentally entire Country has. 
 

Eat rich nothing lyric song. poor hungry soft. 


Just look comfortable members Congress afraid leave DC. Last checked still 200 cases Sweden every DAY, compared zero NZ Vietnam well. think enough workers pick fruit justifies one highest death rates world, well, I’m sure tell you. Check link recent comments normalized graphs. *want* pirate! Link full study here: whole thing way powered. made okay start (\~2k participants), pull weak. result, cuts small make meaningful conclusions. Paired aggressive controlling, really good restaurant point. wish asked indoor/outdoor restaurants, I'd love see difference.

The rest enough data make meaningful conclusions. 

The bar/coffee shop question also weak. Uncontrolled numbers 13 8 (sick, sick). Apparently 5x many people ate restaurants (107) went starbucks, seems ludicrous. guessing including bar scared people giving honest response expect coffee shop mix meant mask drive honesty, came backwards. Add P-hack 21 bar/coffee shop patrons come something significant shame.

We really need study x50, could get good stuff. Still, great went tried. Good call pointing difference obesity numbers overall hospitalized, you’re assuming healthy weight people obese people (particularly morbidly obese people) identical activities exposure risk... don’t think accurate.

Many morbidly obese people mobility problems, practice limit social activities. Think highest risk activities catching Covid right now, ask morbidly obese populations represented there. examples, would argue represented. YO mean happysauce?? know , kids get Covid super spreaders.Also , still know long term effects kids.Hospitals New Delhi , India getting back kids recovered Covid getting sick weeks later Kawasaki syndrome .Also, survey taken May showed biggest rate infection age group 18-45. 10 transactions month avoid fee eliminated. droplets small sucked breathing, move around shield, like dust particles. large droplets simply fall ground, vulnerable small ones. Face shield recommended additional masks, alternative them. However, unable wear face mask, shield better nothing. No, insane think lockdown 50 years anything between. 4 months lockdown resulted 20.4% GDP drop UK 2008 recession 2.1% get head ass  guess Germans compliant rules social distancing. Check recent comments link normalized graphs Sad thing tou avoid restaurant people shopping grocery store could coworkers.

Mask laws important. Uh, yeah is. sounding alarm friends. country would much worse condition Wal-Mart, Lowes, Menards etc. required masks. Luckily retailers common sense tRump sycophant Kim Reynolds lacks.  kid's school reopened person despite ""science based"" reopening plan positivity rates 2.5 guidelines reopening, quickly approaching 15% CDC says require sitting schools. 

We're fucked. Yeah fair sorry 🎊   privelege

Otherwise, evil wins default system degenerates corrupt, dysfunctional oligarchy, we're living in. really think guy meeting small groups friends following governments restrictions guy need guilt tripping? Dude saint compared lot countrymen ""high ranking man gives obvious advice yet again"" Remember said could shoot someone fifth avenue lose voters?

Also theres way america going give citizens anything close jobkeeper/ceno work German company chatting team, seems spiking like everywhere else. Maybe bad, still concerned. main positive less people hospitals COVID. also testing lot aggressively asymptomatic carriers getting found adding stats. 

Compared utter disaster UK, similar numbers way less testing... nonsensical. say live society people refuse right thing. officials continue give contradiction contradiction, evidence shown dramatically overblown measure taken bound cause far damage locking who’s say what’s right thing? people want virtue signal online. People attempting shame others conforming nonsense. don’t know anyone even knows anyone who’s sick since least June.

Lockdown must continue vaccine found, distributed proven effective.

It matter takes 5 months 50 years. mean without yearly 2+ Billion US$ military aid US? isnt social distancing going even easier winter people time? OFC! Facebook even removing ""wear masks"" posts fakenews makes lot sense. 


This joke BTW. Knowledge probably painfull well, better care. indeed, never get house. would accept candy hundreds strangers pandemic?? walking around costumes probably matter. candy constituental right ~~when oppressed~~

It's right regardless Look population 95 Million 35 deaths.

The US way better 

&amp;#x200B;

/s sad Lawyers going busy next years. Interesting! lots Austrians take vacations Balkans every year, signicantly year? Balkans Covid hot spot vacationers went there? 

Good luck schools, Austria 🍀 community spread still ongoing. magically go away country 1.4 billion people. That's argument beginning. Yeah that's issue, cause currently 3 4 vaccines final stages trial now? They're likely one first, wish whoever found first would willing share globally. mass agreement produce vaccines passed effective, every country/company capable producing took part we'd mass distribution time. that's pipe dream  America American people would survive WW3. Mental fortitude, naught. Next thing know, managing Russian hedge fund Cayman Islands. find place world. - recurring first wave. I'm personally type anti-vax way, shit rushed politicized hell, general populace get it, I'll wait month hunkered down, continuing best practices social distancing/sanitation etc. everything going smoothly vaccinated people I'll hop queue. insulation suggestion pretty nonsense, happen already thousands dollars worth grow lighting hydroponic equipment, great idea use winter. Electricity costs counteracted heat produced. While, yes, gas heating definitely cheaper, 1000w lighting produces exact amount heat 1000w space heater, good winter increases AC cost summer. increase humidity also desirable dry winters though bad summer. 

I've half stuff set running low power summer largely something do, cools off, I'll definitely everything going full blast trying grow much fresh produce possible (along finally able turn oven bake breads) make bulk stock trips store fill chest freezer cabinets instead buying greens bread least week. 

It's terrible financial advice suggest someone spend last bit savings starting lettuce grow op house, great time happen equipment put good use. still banks Wells Fargo? guys crooks supreme. hardest part half world shutting down, rather disease itself. shut effected personally coronavirus. barley getting industry reduced almost nothing. Thanks lot guvmint. Always looking best interests. /s 'until need anymore' far nebulous - waiting effective vaccine? might another year (or could still never). sure pro t.rump bias like exposing news stories put negative light. 

Lol iv'e seen 50% capacity means remove one two tables. wife also three kids - need work continue live... ain't much easier here. Sure, plenty countries selfish idiots. America lot per-capita compared countries.   Soon. Way go Zuck, another hands leader, let lies spread.

You could least flag lies (and potentially save hundred thousands lives).

Kinda like throwing gasoline fire. People honestly believe allowed go, must safe go. many people faith fact live reasonable modern age things like pandemics thing past.

Well, could be, eventually. rate at, though. Whats current cases cases daily?  Please report comments. rely heavily reports. sheer number comments day needs support users reporting comments. Watch German meat packing industry. got hit hard, likely get hit hard again. officialy herd immunity thing right? essence saying true. sounding alarm peers looked like SARS outbreak, something rightly made aware of. yep read comment veteran said given kind army couple years back flu everyone unit developed bad upper respiratory infection. removing it, promoting it. period. 

let's call mark fuckerberg.  Aachen calling. Learn dance. Tango Salsa particularly good.

I walk tango salon know within minutes wants invite dance evening, yes is/was (pre-corona) lot kisses involved. adding info third party:

For China travel shutdown, travel really shutdown Chinese nationals. American nationals still permitted travel (which certainly pros cons).

Also lol never heard airport shutting US. Certainly barely anyone traveling, never shut down. come wierd definitions everyone. didn’t get hit hard peak- would another peak? They’re much safer they’re rural.. that’s strongpoint, low population density means disease struggles spread. top aware back March-April. meant eradicate without vaccine. people seem think locked long enough would go away without one. Complete isolation table point. We're going need let kids see grandparents - outside. We're things unnecessary; restaurants, in-person retail, gatherings, etc. - cannot continue keep immediate family without going completely insane. don’t know much hunkering do. mongo ones absolute favorite can't find anywhere even one, tiny, actual example? Color surprised. based. basic. Sad true. don’t get vaccine October-November, don’t think we’ll see whole countries shutdown like did. shutdown like winter would almost certainly nail coffin economy along would come mass poverty huge drop quality life~ guess worse covid impact wise.

Covid isn’t March. understand lot more, cases deaths ratio dropped greatly we’re better treating protecting vulnerable previously. flesh burning UV-C bulbs really give pretty color though. People forgetting virus mutated around February far contagious variant - strain spreading worldwide right now. think far mystery surrounding virus people realize. could certainly see spreading form earlier even November. source easy say MAGA idiots, everyone backgrounds idiots - MAGA crowd vocal it. number people wear mask properly seemingly feel silly amazing; people nose out, wearing one stupid spandex neck things see mouth through...

Restaurants open mask requirement staff general recommendations spreading (without max capacity restriction). point would safer stay home since dont need go cafe. sitting table mask, even though allowed, best decision start use sign language? know 1 sign however often orange hair old fart. Even then, could fall stairs home break neck. Italy really bad stopped mortgage payments. Correct. bars restaurants open massive contributing factor. Common Sense: indicates complete safety possible anything. I'm making funny observation manic media headlines. like they're giving us monkey paw squishie machine pitch. visited hospital last week, issues whatsoever. regions urging people put hospital visits.

So, personal experiences hospitals? must bad one... Gov pocket Big Death didn’t say everything done point unnecessary. accepted limited lockdowns stop hospitals overwhelmed, accepted masks CONDITIONAL reopening (wear mask ALLLLL over.)

We locked down. wore masks. There’s risk cases overwhelming hospitals places. still people going “Ah yes can’t open there’s vaccine,” treating every minor case increase crisis justify they’re acting like there’s mask compliance. is!

And argument, incredibly, seems “ok yes area extremely high compliance everyone wearing mask supposed someone low compliance area flies in?”

Well, fucking hell, that’s standard you’re going locked forever, lot lying whole time.

“Oh it’s two weeks, oh it’s bit longer, it’s curve flattens, oh it’s mask, oh it’s reopen....oh actually we’re totally lying someone might fly Mississippi can’t go anything there’s vaccine. Sorry that!”

Yeh piss that. Absolutely still order magnitude difference two terms death rate.

Florida average age 42
Calgary average age 37

Definitely different still 5 years average. everytime watch movies remind pre covid scenes characters club large group makes uneasy, i'm like ""oh wait safe 2007"" lol It’s boring badly written 

And don’t dog way 
Dahlgren know sucked

Hell atlas shrugged bombed movie watched [this excellent videoconference Dr. Fauci (my all-time FAVORITE voice throughout whole pandemic) Harvard Medical always, Fauci makes lot good points. Hopefully time watch entire hour-long video, don't, best bits:

* Fauci attributes resurgence cases many states, including California, Florida, Texas, lifting lockdowns early. predicts midwestern states, South Dakota, might next.
  * true many European countries seeing resurgences.
* solve this, advocates *real* shutdown: strict sustained lockdown *until vaccine available general public*.
  * ""What would like see is, keeping lid it, keeping baseline (of cases) get vaccine. believe we’ll likely get vaccine end year, beginning 2021. think need hunker get fall winter, it’s going easy. know every time lift restrictions, get blip. It’s whack-a-mole.""
* Yes, *will* last 2021. Yes, *will* spend Thanksgiving Christmas lockdown.
* *have* way, alas, foolish Americans screwed pandemic response, are. followed directions *first* time, maybe still boat September.
* U.S. try imitating Victoria's coronavirus response lockdown again: **a real lockdown**.
  * ""They lightest influenza season memory. They’re things … wearing masks, physical distancing, washing hands, avoiding crowds."" neither Fauci said winter gotta hunker so....I dont know human error made people charge though. Hence ""hands we're dealt."" deal fallout ineptitude entirely own. requires taking things hands, including, necessary, bending perhaps selectively ignoring public health rules. Coronavirus like theme-park rides? scientific breakthrough epic proportions. Maybe prescribed go Flight Passage test positive C19. like start pandemic people joked getting virus gave urge fly another continent attend big party. 

Most people got spread far afield first wealthy travellers. friends ironically refer Trump Bux. Speaking of, where's next round Trump Bux? called Spanish flu Spainish news one first allowed report it. spread throughout Western world WW1 soldiers. media allowed report cause governments censored news outlets keep morale high.

And course started China. 1/7th world population lives China 1/7th India. pandemics going start there. Simple probability Yes, according reddit, women also penises. Daily deaths continue decrease, Fauci wrong again, guys ramp fear mongering unprecedented levels.  Dishes. answer dishes. Especially cleaning kitchen entire family. possible way downplaying good thing. Give one good reason. expect happen without sufficient lockdown protocols enforcement safety regulations social distancing. US absolute mess we’re still first wave Palliative means patient diagnosis end-of-life care built treatment. hospice treatment work make patient comfortable possible end. said it’s 8 months we’re still we’re at. can’t beat thing partial participation. Everyone participate can’t half-ass either like March/April. 

If something 10% effort, don’t expect accomplished anytime soon. Wow... Italy definitely much precise prepared us ! sound terrible live like 2 weeks least clear guidelines. mom quarantining half rules. 
But worse us begining.. 

Better paranoid catching it, worse, giving someone. 

I hope family stay safe. hear saying right? would say different case. Cuz right, many things world cause premature deaths. Covid something went 0 pandemic quite quickly response it, could kept either Wuhan, Asia, let cross oceans, way till reached we're at. things affecting world, affected every day lives economy much. Whether one important whole convo, least short life encountered anything made us stay affect every day life dramatically. That's view anyway


Edit: I'll also add even people believe lives affected tough express get better get shit together people even believe existing. Older people financially secure. Google it. number surveys show mental health pattern describe true. deaths per population past week relative UK, France, Spain? think 11X estimate?  get caught death % total dead either looking things going. People dieing less find ways treat COVID serious long lasting damage done people hospitalized know long term damage be. brave virus incredible. global apocalypse pictured. damn missed whole bottom section....younger folks dying faster older, 3 weeks death reporting average 45 quartile. wow People India never truly respected social distancing norms cities, want care. Also enough real estate places like Mumbai, Delhi proper social distancing. Work travel happening again. people want/need see family take vacation. you’re wearing mask following rules planes don’t see issue. Karens refusing masks ones spreading this. averaging 65 cases day. 2 weeks opening schools we've gotten around 200 daily cases rising. 

The real issue schools opening rather lax mask rule. Students keep mask class. 30 kids room masks windows starting close temperatures rapidly drop. New Jersey. Look up, new cases deaths low flat saying can't go park - stay away people it. one saying can't go hiking - stay away people it.

Then missed point. I'm activities people. safe, healthy way socialize. encourage people feeling bad would, dopamine rush pretty good making forget worries bit ones getting payed. ones paid. ""You either dupie duper"" Frank Reynolds.  news Sweden keeps getting worse WHIPPIES CURE COVID!!!! fuckin knew it!! Feeling totally validated refusal eat since March. You’re horrible person. Go Pakistan. crazy world bullies deserving empathy victims told real problem? Especially Catholic Church. Call email airline patronizing, ask ahead time policy is. would use piece surgical mask tape onto exhaust. that, explain ahead time circumvent possible issue, hopefully issues.

Besides, bet plenty others wear surgical masks, fit loosely sides allow air escape. So, honesty, modifying mask, actually protecting others better someone wearing loose cloth surgical mask. Wth? 
""Im dying can't breath sure, I'll pull one science!""  Nope, hoped days record infections behind us.  cares, get vaccine, I'm done. dont want get vaccine, get virus die. *At least aren’t dying infection though amirite?* -average r/Coronavirus user Tl;dr able understand ghetto meant, simply unable spell order try insult me? I'll try find study, im going trust study anecdotal evidence. ""Nevertheless, persisted.""

Tough talk melting face slightest adversity. alternative plan disagreement point. take offense people who’s emotional reaction shrug rather outrage, anger channeled legitimate action. 

The “playing hands we’re dealt” analogy doesn’t fully work situation implies random causation fate, that’s certainly case since largely avoidable result human error. reading footnote, weird 70+ age group excludes 80+ folks, one would think listed 70-79, right? Thanks study, people would willing listen come rude.

Edit: Also, study flawed accounting majority cases mild symptoms. well first case US January. think it’s hard say proved anything. I’m saying spreading wildly, earlier Jan/Feb time. wear mask, believe sheltering place. However like news about: EXTREMELY DEADLY death rate dropped LONG TERM EFFECTS.

I'm disputing science, hate 95% information get bad, doom, worse. virus affecting us alarming rate, isolation, depression, stagnation, poverty, social inequality us in. 

Coronavirus make numb coronavirus, numb everything. Well he's running man barely complete sentences(sentences prepared people) Schools already opened several places they’ve got people getting infected spreading virus. dude thinks area they’ll open schools November doesn’t correlate Covid November. &amp; hopeful things get better won’t happen magically, people don’t take proper steps make things better they’ll get worse fall schools either remain closed people get infected people die. !Remind 3 months bottom page two powers ten off, assuming using newest CDC data can't fire someone requesting FMLA. multiple courses action someone take fired that.  cut them. company makes based tutorial researchers Texas &amp; $30 day like nothing. even day federal minimum wage work pays double, minimum wage many places higher. make $15/hour already pay rent insurance, getting quarter income hunker feasible “People tired spending months home they’re stepping despite knowing could get infected,” said Subhash Chavhan, surgeon Satara district. “They’re longer taking coronavirus seriously.”

It's everywhere. probably thing since beginning time. human nature. certain segment population requires immediate gratification ignores warnings danger.

It form natural selection. population decrease certain amount. would think civilized humans, could rise periodic pruning collective shrubbery. always, patience motivation conform strategy, spread disease everybody else. one West wants admit ""China bad"", China country hit ridiculously hard managed fully contain pandemic within months.

People read think kind monster, nothing crazy read it. Wait. What????? 24 hours fever? change that? definitely possible people could still infected? Well.... incorrect statement.... surge past fires pre-programmed. Evidence politicization health crisis. Oh god no. I’m exact opposite. need 193 mil tests month according recent data. respect Iowa north, anything west like Tennessee group They're fine *you*. know many places - anywhere - US cases low enough opening back actively recommended health professionals. Outdoor activities like mentioning, riskier would comfortable with, considered lowest risk activities do, I'm sure point is. Nobody saying can't go park - stay away people it. one saying can't go hiking - stay away people it. Don’t already though? chest weights. worried ""lost generation"" kids miss educational opportunities -- equally worried ""lost generation"" elderly literally die result schools reopening?

No, already losing parent/grandparent/family member covid WAY traumatizing missing another year school.

In short term. something every kid eventually deal real here. faced two really depressing options. want choose one keeps people actually alive. need keep schools closed, safe reopen.

I prefer one ruin life 75 years left, one keeps someone around extra 5 years present. still lot lose. poorest people know still smartphone, Netflix, smokes, booze, weed, usually sort game console. first wave ever finish? mean “did win”... problem. turn competition, working together. 

This global pandemic, affects us, including China, USA, Russia, Brazil...etc. borders still important this. But.. Thanksgiving, Halloween Xmas coming 

/s I'm sure exactly, know getting plane people Jordanian passports. American. expecting Americans smarter Brits. America breeding ground anti-vaccination skepticism?

That statistic definitely lower UK, like 1 2. fuck Mitch McConnell Nancy Pelosi. eggs bologna today Thank comment. posted something similar another thread. I’ve lived situations covid now: single, living SO, single again.

Isolating away world much easier relationship. missed friends normal life, often distracted another living human being.

I taking risks mental health matters more. kind risks? Going gym periodically operating 10% occupancy strict reservation system. Going rock climbing outdoors friends wearing masks. also brave storm going local pharmacy get flu shot soon.

I hate covid done me. Prior this, extroverted person knew second last ex. shell person. idea reaching people stressful. Social situations seem scary tough navigate. legitimate anxiety leaving house would say 90% time I’m able it, days pop bare minimum take dog out.

It soul crushing. feel less alone knowing people like there, weathering storm solo, also learning evaluate manage risk sake sanity. someone explain death rates falling every day case numbers climbing? mean ending, less? Yea want pussies man! finally catch video games anime. That’s going happen rich control guys guns given authority use them. USA yesterday overtook Italy COVID deaths per capita.  6 months since last stimulus fk congress doing? saudis kind thing? Somewhat.

Look, essential things need do. them, wear mask. 

But there's reason risk life anyone else's non-essential business. Everyone coronavirused out. one really looks hear people gloss everything. going get bad winter. scenario overseas tourism foreign students could continued viable way. 

Foreign students heavily China. virus need quarantined (they've exported cases countries despite official figures) costs money capacity. virus come.

Tourists came heavily Australia China. Australians allowed leave country. virus like Sweden allow travel bubble, us virus allow one either unless took unquarantined flights do. internal politics behind unaccommodating towards New Zealand. Chinese quarantine return flights constrained. Return travel China problematic meaning going tourist overseas right now.

The best thing tourism industry domestic tourism tide something happen virus going like countries New Zealanders would stop unnecessary domestic travel. What's wrong Texas? (genuinely curious) Remember Biden holding ""15 days slow spread!"" signs? joke. homeless two weeks get stimulus. ""hunker down"" forced use wall-mart bathrooms every day. Im dead serious here. No, every state declining. Florida peaked July 13. state gotten even near NY NJ daily deaths. Play  nearly lost apartment December 2017. feels like distant childhood memory point. last couple years long. Yeah. know people always spit face talking? Avoid costs. family member mine got married back December. Many us experienced flu-like symptoms afterwards. mother catarrh since think may too. Someone work also whole Christmas period pneumonia.

Recently, someone attended wedding invited participate Oxford trial found already test positive antibodies. thought originally contracted virus back December.

A theory is... could one first people UK contract coronavirus. However something could prove antibody tests generally unavailable. get pizza, ask staff undercook (to whatever extent can). receive box gloves on, box never comes inside. throw box recycling bin sliding onto cookie tray. Bake kill virus, voila! Enjoy! beginning caught flat-footed like everybody else, deaths hospitalizations never got bad France Italy. good luck younger people tended get infected vacation. still mysteries. example, French Italian parts Switzerland stats similar France Italy...the German parts Switzerland look like Germany. government, response... Yes, consider wearing mask make love Could Autumn anything it? Cooler temperatures? Surely virus different cold flu? short term? they're smart. long term? they're fucking stupid.
Until one fully tested approved nation continuing history abuse cutting corners, stay fuck away. Every day I’m hunkerin... They're cheap things like buying cleaning products. Changing air flow expensive might get people back inside door! They're banking ignorance. concluded point, hope vaccine, anyone taking reasonably seriously (like wearing fucking mask), really give shit themselves, people around them. Im going take precautions family accordingly, im blessed lucky work home meantime. simple: half state pants head fucking stupid. put much stock that. week two ago telling states prepare begin distribution November. already bumped back, trust anything says it. aim must amazing ‘shoot kill’ tiny virus ...this last resort... 🎶 People pretend immune system basic one level defense viruses shows signs slowing down, “PaNiC NeVeR GeT aWaY PlAgUe!” predict rural areas states US haven’t hit hard yet get hit hard fall. Bigger cities already hit won’t bad, though see increase cases Italy 24.3 cases per million average last 7 days.

To name few. I'd say cutting world sustainable long term. makes sense wonder long manage. ""Well Fauci said okay. believe Fauci says.""  Calling now, Zoom hell till winter break.   gods. We’re alone. try limit deaths limiting gatherings worshipping false deities? graphs sent show yesterday Germany cases Italy Chill, hysterical. buy rental property margins tight? Serious question. Absurdly, unacceptably high runaway pandemic anyways Asymptomatic funny word use testing still hasn’t rolled wide basis US. number people moderate symptoms unrecorded unknown likely high. 

Plus, you’re still talking long term effects brand new virus. yeah, there’s lack data. know viruses live people decades become worse (HIV) - lack data isn’t positive proof everything’s clear. Caution rational here. it’s reciprocal? It'll easier summer. There's literally reason I'd want leave home winter except go work. want pay bills pay food months I'll happily hunker (still super jealous anyone got quarantine). u. 🙃 That's think need better job with... communicating people worked hard best interests mind. they, too, want fight virus get back normal.

So many people distrustful people ""smart"" believe use intelligence good, major problem really see work addressed. can't deny unneeded deaths become convenient tool politicians. Makes total sense Covid then, could even started rather China.

No fucking done Seattle Flu Study group first detected SARS-CoV-2 United States.

Their scientific results published spreading widely would detected. I'm American tell every easily: MASKS! Tokyo greater population density NYC 378 deaths locked wore masks early still wearing them. rocket science need vaccine. Trump put national mask order February enforced fine jail like Australia does. 200,000 dead people right now. thats protest about, infact something inst even thing Australia here. good, one state second wave. started get bad (nothing like US numbers obviously, bad comparison almost zero previously). went strict lockdown, extended another weeks, we're 50 cases day around 750 day month ago.

Does suck really locked down, yes. necessary, yes. working, yes.

There dickheads like always is, protesting ""rights"" infringed, believe masks whatever nonsense, thankfully many people, vast vast majority right thing.

Our leaders also right thing, main point here. US hope hell, going need Fauci's less Trumps. doubts that's ever likely happen rate things going, hopefully get sensible leaders soon people actually start listen needs done instead fighting whole time. weiightlifting mask - it’s hard since aren’t really much heavy breathing. cardio though kind understand able mask That's right work Union busting last 20 years? US #11 deaths/1m ""sky high""  issues contribute high death rate USA. Would death rate covid lower we'd contained initially? course. would also lower population made obese people? Yes. old, fat, sick ALWAYS weather disease worse healthy people do. can't control old sick. can't control public policy. sure shit 200lb overweight, blame fat lie individuals.  see it.

It needs go deeper current: “shot magic, make scary virus go away, hurt” quit FB five years ago. understand, saved heaps heartache int’l flights stopped.

No didn't. International flights restricted certain countries, I'm pretty sure even inbound talking average US person’s perspective, mine, also experienced airport shutting entirely

That ""all flights offline."" time air traffic US ever grounded exactly 19 years ago today, September 11, 2001. false comment? 

Literally everything. wear mask public. masks work? proof asymptomatic people issues afterwards...which yet dont. damn wish large freezer. think maybe past could done.
People immediate-needs oriented. We're used stores open 7 days week til late night, McDonald's open every day, run need something.

Back even growing up, things would really shut around Christmas time people stayed close family. Fast food open, grocery stores open, sure stores similar Target Walmart open.

Now feels abnormal shut everything down. We've backtested respiratory samples looked wastewater found positive samples 2019 USA. [The rapid flu test also fails detect influenza 50% time (high false negative negative flu result halfway worthless. Where’s billionaires too!?!? little help time need well neighbor? Remember thing?

Everything risk budget spread society. Policy ensure spread kept within budget. might mean closing restaurants order able keep schools open still stay budget. 

If spread low enough, maybe schools restaurants fit within budget. mean either two ""completely safe"". Someone play Plague Inc hard strange people claiming success failure results look back epidemic.

If cure found soon hard lockdown countries got right, takes years years (or never) managing healthy people getting sick point right course action. exacerbate problem, poor quality education also prevents accepting assistance advice, truly trying help them. scammed taken advantage much, simply lose trust . would still crop back month would completed destroyed half remaining small businesses country delay something equivalent flu population. healthy people go normal life social distancing wearing masks fattys, old people, people preconditions stay home much possible keep safe. thing gonna new flu isn’t much vaccine herd immunity reached. People like much less 1% chance dying need ruin lives entire economy thing. Keep risk away population, that’s thing do. Everyone else needs go lives social distance wear masks. It’s partially protect also partially protect them, since lot anti mask even want go office? understand. Today Macron (France's president) going talk something Covid-19 related I'm assuming we're gonna take action. looked USA's numbers always thought could happen (France). see people without masks everywhere, MIL SIL wear one properly say vaccine going poison us (Jesus). oh get this: schools reopened last week.

Fortunately guys, weeks number 1 we're already number 1 daily/weekly cases deaths. know much helps, hey. Pericarditis inflammation around heart. It’s incredibly painful bad cases liquid around heart feels like getting stabbed every time heart beats. wonder many COVID deaths are/were miscategorized regular influenza hospital reporting data CDC. would explain discrepancy. I'm saying that's happened, intentional underreporting COVID data regularly occurred, surprised one methods used. goes trials US safety proven US sure. would go step claim revolutions like russian french never happen western society. times different -the government wasnt organised, rich werent organized. even see today every protest dispersed fast possible issues introduced distract people. Even manage organise somehow could send army pacify us come new disaster attack distract us. much culture head state. issue country (US) like little European countries, size massively underplayed. odd thing is, one main drivers nation's media, say, culture right macho bravado American thing always theme America No, they'll never ""get it."" number deaths crossed intuitive number human brain statistics territory months ago.

200,000 something something see counting it. people understand think abstract. change numbers grow larger. I'm sure get homeless subway riders follow rules now. /s need pay stay fuck home. Nothing change. Ever.  starts ""Operation Warp Speed"" way current administration seems interested getting something out, instead getting safe effective vaccine out.

It's really hard believe system corrupted, understand vaccine important, want feel reassured properly tested/vetted take it.

Vaccines scare me, I'm date vaccinations get flu vaccination every year, really lost trust institutions supposed make sure protected.  

It currently looks like front runners west going process, corners cut try speed process up, right now, still trust companies non-gov't organizations working developing vaccine therapeutics.  

They understand get wrong, end paying price either company/organization industry, I'm feeling pretty confident release and/or say vaccine safe effective they've done adequate testing. 

Bottom line, trust, personally trust current administration appointed head various gov't functions.

If American qualified vote, please go vote!  Make sure voice heard! poor before, poor now. much changed. agree. reasons might be: masks lowering initial viral load, earlier detection cases (so deaths trail cases detected late) younger people getting infected (which also delay deaths since first infected infect older people too).

I expecting happen Spain. month daily increases new cases, deaths fortunately still low. requiring negative PCR test travellers Sweden (24 cases per 100000 last 14 days) France instance (131 cases per 100000 last 14 days). Pot calling kettle black regards reviewing 'unfair' decisions. Season flu much rarer stronger people think is. People call anything makes mildly sick ""flu"" hundreds viruses there. way I'd want flu again.  get flu shots people!!!

Yes also dropped 50 pounds since outbreak started. I'm still determined reach healthy life style end year (if covid kill me). Food worth life. 40, 1 10,000 get infected.  US average 750 Data previous pandemics show cities countries locked faster harder ended economically better (which sounds like everyone wants). 

Some important takeaways studies:

Cities implemented social-distancing public health interventions 10 days earlier counterparts saw 5 percent relative increase manufacturing employment pandemic ended, 1923. Similarly, extra 50 days social distancing worth 6.5 percent increase manufacturing employment, given city.

Study: ""Pandemics Depress Economy, Public Health Interventions Not: Evidence 1918 Flu""

“We find evidence cities acted aggressively public health terms performed worse economic terms,” says Emil Verner, assistant professor MIT Sloan School Management co-author new paper detailing findings. “If anything, cities acted aggressively performed better.”

“It casts doubt idea trade-off addressing impact virus, one hand, economic activity, hand, pandemic destructive economy,” Verner says.  well, issue then. sorry say it. revolt happening? Completely incorrect. 17,000 vaccinated far. I'm curious going answer long term damage children may incur getting sick school. know hearts lungs yet. CT strict lockdown people actually obeyed. We're splendidly back borderline normalcy couple months. mad, bet like big strong man put mask you.

I charge hourly though. American, don’t know live another 4 years shit. I’m terrified win again. unfortunately looking like here, What’s opinion doing? I’m American nyc we’ve shut long time. Seeing cases rise everywhere seems elimination impossible. want one PaNicKiNg?


Unless RNC ranting raving about. Don’t put cart horse. Iirc three people. Either way, practice preach. Yeah theres virus deadly need test know it, guyz invulnerable""

Of course exceptions, rule. anecdotes.

To put perspective, diseases also cause long term damage. Take pneumonia, UK average 220,000 people get pneumonia every year. 1/3th respiratory viruses. recover pneumonia three weeks, takes months. found subreddit people I'm sure would see similar stories they're recovery, mucus clearance respiratory tract deep inside lung important, otherwise impair gas exchange,"" says Harihan Regunath, M.D., Pulmonary Disease Specialist University Missouri Health Care. ""Basically cough spit else dissolve white blood cells engulfing digesting clearing it. It’s slow process.""

Just try put things perspective bit.

It's sad wish best also ask putting much spotlight average 1600 people die every day UK? shows strict lockdown answer. Spain imposed incredibly strict one approaching US death numbers per capita per day. responding ""it work"" work comment. indeed work approved indication, no?

Science generally incremental. likely find silver bullet treatment approved indication getting hospital days earlier pretty significant. That's lot money, misery, ventilator time. Nicole doesn’t carry basic conversation. Aren’t Fauci? Jeff goldblum jurassic park That’s totally it. Makes perfect sense. People **are** taking seriously. But, like Nordic countries, masks never recommended, make virus magically eradicated. Social distancing recommended start, (including bans mass gatherings) latter trumps former. It’s working pretty well us. least currently. 

If flare ups locally, masks may well recommended. is, would seeing close everyone wearing day one. 

So, think current news Sweden positive. Wearing masks wouldn’t help people died April... make possible remove restrictions. Covid's Broncos Fan. OP making fun logic that's commonly conveyed people fall camp taking COVID seriously seem simple.

I simple. People general fundamentally simple. stupid ones associate complexity intelligence.

Of course, also seem think sarcastic remark value ""funny, clever, new"".

Do smell bias? Unless you’re homeless bets off? kidding wish could experience firsthand $57k year living NYC gets you. guess wrote mostly american point view, remember US big place. bet find system imaginable, least place.

But back subject, thing confusing teachers classes.

A typical US high-school would say 7 periods day. First 7.15 8.05, second 8.10 09.00 on. many schools 7 subjects, order, every day. classes unique group 20-30 people. means bell rings class total chaos everyone going new classroom hallways. lunch breaks, 4 slot-times essentially sprint across school cafeteria stand line forever.

Which means, system essentially setup maximize number social contacts, really line keeping COVID bay.

This also junior high Texas ran, idea even younger though. Americans could fill here.  I'm sorry I've already written anti-masker idiot somehow arguing ""nearly everyone"" wore masks/locked (again still true), garbage strategy work yet acknowledge well NY reopening (you continue say locked down, not, restaurants museums open ffs) compared states shitty take seriously.

You also attack semantics, rather substance arguments, acknowledge facts around you.

Too bad charge.

Now wear mask ya big baby. OC almost always near top list new CA cases though, despite relatively small population.  hope you’re right long game. live province lauded example outstanding COVID response. one point 1 case per day. we’re second wave, 139 cases yesterday, reluctance reimpose restrictions, children starting back school week. Could possibly get ugly fall. Hopefully Sweden doesn’t join rest world experiencing another outbreak despite low numbers right now.  Per capita way get clear picture. God dumb LOL hang around reddit day trolling Trump. actually work living. pardon reply instantly

Remember Russia loves introduce conflicting information confuse people make withdraw/shutdown news overload. Hi, average fitness 25 year old, that's reduced getting winded 200 feet walking, almost 3 months post infection. 

Yes true young people less likely die, mean we're able quickly recover former health. people know go visit Grandma sick, I'd suspect flu outbreaks nursing home setting come people can't take time work feeling good, time realize flu, late. Someone tell Fauci go away. Stop hyping glorified flu FYI teachers unions Texas almost zero power, state stripped us teachers that. collective bargaining, right strike etc. Glad see this. Lol lol Population per capita widely skewed metric. want look population density. virus would stand reason densely packed population is, higher likeliness infection would be.

And yet 2 countries extremely high density values acted early proactively, Singapore South Korea, extremely low death rates. That’s read this. OC almost near top list new CA cases population ~3 million versus LA’s mean... this. get trying do. trying say nothing yields bad result saying Sweden nothing pointing current (or rather historic) numbers. happens result Swedish strategy yields OK result (I personally doubt it)? case put fuel fire says nothing might OK long run. mean, know Sweden nothing. know know people pointed numerous times. stop spreading lies might aid idiots claiming ""doing nothing"" OK future. 

Numbers currently Sweden, people already pointing saying ""Look, nothing works"". wrong, course. stop feeding fire. Shortened hospital day really impressive. time standard care protocols improve. haven’t grocery store since late Feb. echo chamber fancy term circlejerk? people lack empathy intelligence desensitized this. 

I care it, people either stupid selfish care. thought people Netherlands supposed well educated people believe science follow rules laws set government? “What happens countdown winter reaches zero?”

“...checkmate.” study article. hypothesis. sure studies proving it. Wow, mean humans social. hence need push product quickly. demand dries up. know theoretically transmitted aerosols. still reason believe type transmission common. Social experiment. know much quicker virus spread many people get infected die restrictions lifted. Nebraska our... put ,for lack better comparison: ""Racoon City"" Resident Evil... three countries around them, also similar population density. makes much sense compare UK France. matter Covid coming Flu season schools open Nov. 4th Dec. 4th. Whichever language makes sense task hand. thinking Haskell/F# rules around tax code. I'm still surprised Northern Europe low death rate numbers now, considering countries kept behaving really make sense numbers decreased much. indicates really know spread and/or immunity situation really is. ""legitimate point"" make?

You seem simple. true, kids humans. would lift shift whole IRS system once? Upgrading system would mean breaking systems different domains starting migrating single domain keep moving there. Seems already path like website taxpayers pretty decent use built top legacy code base I'd impressed.

Building website ontop legacy backend difficult seem think is, especially performance major concern.

What's background? sure you’re downvoted, since clearly true. vulnerable care givers live broader community. care givers infected vulnerable follow soon after. think reasonable talk countries surround Sweden talking well Sweden done? shift goal posts. Wtf good Nebraska anyway? Al grow corn fatten America high fructose corn serp. Let kill we’ll build nice park it’s empty. Orange County opened level restrictions SF. Despite reputation (and beach photos), cases per capita well lower SF too. 

No slight SF however, OC far spaced out. born dirt poor homeless, streets, 17 20 addicted drugs. Didn’t finish high school.  dumb luck referring to? who’s making assumptions? Lol make me, powerless little cunt *shrugs*

Saved summer holidays? know live, Sweden, summer holidays April August. spread going steadily long time. country visiting Italy

Nope. describing way Swedish people Italy getting really serious there. Norwegians, example, tend keep mountains. 10% country already travelled outside country started become serious. lot could've done better, exaggerating quite bit. changed apart people holidays, going work, going school, on

You know... literally point strategy. Measures meant kept work well long-term. Link? Take look deaths per capita. mean...it’s proof enough take grain salt considering never successful vaccine corona virus. seems like big maybe across board reduce viral load (the size infecting dose) may reduce severity disease infected individual. ""quietly vaccinated"" sounds nefarious. get corona! get corona! EVERYBODY GETS CORONA! Leadership matters. idea shit show response led Trump causing outlandishly awful numbers idiotic. far herd immunity goes - see what's causing say this. mean think there's actual herd immunity? No. there's couple examples played way might expected early pandemic everything exponential growth.

- Sweden: Infamous lockdown. Yes, people taking precautions, many things still open here. poorly virus, one day numbers started dropping got really low stayed low ever since. cause that?

- Connecticut: got hit really hard NYC did. Reopening indoor dining gyms mid-June. south west also reopening lot time saw major spikes shut things down. Three months later CT okay they've opened schools students hybrid learning.

- Arizona: one worst outbreaks country summer. state quantified study worst mask compliance 50 states. spite this, numbers started going one day steep curve. staying low now.

One explanation I've heard may happening different places involves couple factors coming together: 1. obviously places lot cases reported - let's say around 20% people antibodies, 2. chance people may immunity cold viruses coronavirus family last years (maybe another 10 - 20% population), 3. many people wearing masks social distancing staying lot - people also likely get puts map infected (again could another 20 - 30% population).

Add equals tenuous not-really herd immunity sort herd immunity. everything returned 100% normal places people went concerts sporting events spread would probably get wild enough time. enough people infected, people possibly previously immune good enough part population social distancing - seems hard hit places slowed virus crawl. 

Now theory true? idea, look curves admit something going places certainly we're seeing elsewhere. think need keep eyes happening see learn virus trends. It’s listed 10 sites Russia also seems interesting choice. I’m sure drug approval process like there. I’m sure drug even slightest wiff working Putin heavy hand approve mind USA close election. says collected semen, guess scientists gave hand jobs ( wearing gloves) insults. Interesting. One thing say Covid Enthusiasts: CLASS Becuase abundance masks tests knowledge exist March.

If .05% workforce essential jobs, staying isolation, wearing effective protection, that's totally different scenario March grocery stores open nobody masks on. Sweden one highest death rates world, six months later, people taking seriously wearing masks still live life restrictions. Except thousands who’ve died course. don’t see bad news, don’t know tell you. part country way less 1 100. Don’t think I’ve seen 5-10 people wearing masks entire summer. first thought wonder vaccines backed people financial interest politico.  fair, shut due 1000 different things, least probably school buddies saying ""nahhhh dont worry it"". Lol...theyre far top. even close Vietnam Germany. Theyre right mix rest countries handled like shit. mean- US shit show, really 'pat back' better us. West Australian checking in. instigated lock measures March. back nearly normal lives. thing tells still pandemic international arrivals 500 week (and immediate 2 week lockdown) sports events 50% capacity. Nobody wear mask more. way since July.

The recipe getting known. country still covid lacks leadership make happen. COVID-19 Death Toll Rising Much Faster U.S. ~~Sweden~~ Almost Country, Fewer Deaths Per Capita go California’s county data page, show recent per 100k rates 2x LAC 4.9 vs 11. time, LA unfortunately far ahead cases deaths vs population.

Edit: looks like different weeks however, silly California.

Not want defend OC here. Ha many sheep reddit echo chamber Dont need numbers polls. need look history. polls accurate means. like one US citizen responded fact Twitter “I’ll care France win super bowl”. I’m kidding. 

This little statement says much problem. Yes government utter shit right now, large percentage average citizen fucking moron doesn’t know help (I know it’s percentage, guys smart, lovely people). 

Shit still absolutely blows mind many people US ACTIVELY FIGHT better healthcare. absolute fuck that. feel bad fauci. watching country loves cares completely disregarding facts listening politics. want take get cup coffee give big hug apologize stupid people. You-n-me doc. Cuz Americans largely morons. hope future. Like Rome burned, leaders (and followers) fiddling ... Aka, mask-complaining &amp; covid-denying. Cautiously optimistic recent audio Trump admitting lying start help people catch reality, thus lowering transmission rates. Test more, find cases. That's is. sure people missing that, data right there. Wait, we're STILL first surge? Unfortunately Rush limbaugh, Hugh Hewitt Howie Carr think we've passed curve everything golden out!

I feel bad conservatives get info conservative talk fox. like get lied accept EVERYTHING head. Sweden’s deaths causes average now. Yeah best see existing measures extended, see restrictions eased out, made stricter. We're bunch frogs boiling water. first case (Hong Kong case) asymptomatic re-infection. second case (Nevada case)
had severe case re-infection. See put evil us, Ricky Bobby. eat fast food. government actually gave fuck health like claim would regulate garbage allow put body. issue far far far far far bigger America. Watch social dilemma. thoughts hold dear even own. Even benevolent. really aren’t even “sides”.  Believe ready throw computer window read that, think he's making educated guess, there's plenty instances even experts wrong y’all still her? Nobody wanted anything trump, fuck we’d vote dog somehow made ballot, long it’s fat fucking dumbass.  keep saying China test asymptomatic people, sure getting information wrong. 

Also point Auckland reinfections state China avoided them, also wrong. several cases reinfections, Beijing went lockdown, xinjiang went lockdown reinfections. Shenzhen new cases, managed avoid lockdown due fast managed test trace. China continue reinfections. Wish places would this. medieval rituals ridiculous. Virus gunna virus, can't hide it.

Not that, know deadly. Time move get back normal. necessary.

A second presidential term way kill Trump.

Go look history: white supremacists live *forever*. hatred keeps alive.

If strike Trump's presidency now, become powerful possibly imagine. empire expand outer space millennium-long subjugation races galaxy begin.

Every thoughtful critical thinking, moderately intelligent hate trump, idiotic know better.  depressed terrible leader lied everyone severity coronavirus.  watch livestream yesterday. nothing dosing control group dependent variable dopey German here, ;)

Good news first: browsing global data, seems like people dying much anymore used February/March/April. still need deal long-term issues, though, simplest way keeping bay ... working keep virus spreading. 

looking US outside, seems like way many people kind-of powerful positions US concerned everyone else thinking (from high-level politicians Sheriff Offices bitchfighting amongst other: ""we'll mandate enforce it"" - ""yeah, may get state-wide mandate state's Chief Sheriff, I'll tell every local sheriff they'll face disciplinary measures found enforcing mandate"").

When governors sheriffs openly quarreling (1) issue concerned about? (2) measures taken? criticizing/supporting President, supposed work effective strategy ground level? 

Given international relations democratic standards, though, something Americans work own... Well, girlfriend new teacher NYC nice apartment, computer, tv, cell phone, pretty much things see struggling.  


How much make year claim fighting wages teachers? teacher? Similarly Sweden always gets pulled anti-lockdown success mandate.

Not sure even thing. They're #11 deaths per capita (disregarding San Marino Andorra -- population less 100,000), USA. horribly. It’s likely true origins SARS-CoV-2 never known. still don’t know origin SARS-CoV nearly 20 years spent studying it.

Also, situation already getting worse even without easing restrictions.   Currently NYC, make 57k month, almost landlord let rent apartment yourself, even studio. need make 40 times rent, nothing available 1400 month. one people burning cities ground blacks dying gunpoint police, number hovering around 12 blacks since last year 13 million. 

We've sicknesses within last quarter century make Covid look like single grain sand beach. You, person going back forth with, never gave two shits. procedures stay indoors fear mongering then?

Blacks killing rate 10,000 times police killing gunpoint. You, person going back forth with, done jack shit; protests, cry better communities, cry people charge kicked office, etc. 

You're fucking joke. didn't. polls roughly stayed same. blatantly misleading information. didn’t read article. Yeah, actually lockdown thing useful past certain point number infections. toolbox fighting shit goes something like -

* Almost spread: contact tracing confirmed cases quarantining contacts

* Little spread: heavier testing identify areas budding outbreak implementing local response

* Moderate spread: mask mandates, heavier restrictions gatherings, shut major spreaders like bars clubs

* Lots spread: close schools, close risky businesses like bars/restaurants/gyms/theaters/salons/churches

* Critical spread, healthcare system overwhelmed: full lockdown, shelter place, essential business reason leave home Gfd much wrong sport anymore. people delude thinking they’re legit athletes win cost attitudes? worthy athlete understands winning comes proper preparation, luck timing, rarely occur time. Yet still people teach kids there’s people look to. Hardly. big deal then, coronavirus gone, let’s open bars. Florida bar owners: full price 50% capacity? Fuck that, it’s 50% drinks 100% capacity. math works out, right? People won’t care unless goes abouseltey haywire Many weren’t even teaching. None directly tied schools reopening.

Edit: downvote brigade likely asked question indicated hadn’t actually read article attached headline.  Yeah, started killed Soliders.

Everyone know dangerously depressed barely able feed themselves. Something done besides telling people ""hunker down"" Flu incubation period 24-48 hours transmit without symptoms present. need wear one exhibiting symptoms. would love people would wear mask they're feeling well future. sounds like made poor investment. can't handle costs, sell property. arrived Europe..... asked felt sick hot flashes. said concluded with, ""Ok, try stay inside much possible 2 weeks wear mask go out"". That's it. temperature check, nothing. I'm still baffled. Compare many countries even let board flight unless negative covid test. way US administration giving slightest fuck keeping citizens safe mind boggling. normally like this, they’ve implemented lot changes since Covid. Every chair piece tape across can’t sit it. also lots televisits aren’t many people waiting room. Sorry hear isn’t conscientious.  Exactly. another poor attempt downplay pandemic... wanna blunt it. need senate get butts pass relief help people pass bills HOR already passed.

Yeah, I've barely spent time Miami, instantly unrecognizable rest Florida. international, cosmopolitan, lots cultures blending, energy city. Florida diverse people think, Florida Man stories come over, nearly homogeneous people tend think. bit like NY ways, lots rural living, plenty suburbs, small cities, big one hunkered south, affects local cultures also cause lot intrastate conflict. also high number immigrants, legal illegal, high disparity income levels. different states ways, maybe helps illustrate it?

/s We're going wearing masks forever public. like people 1918 pandemic ended. peaked April. NH opened restaurants end June. makes sense. example mitigations impacting regional spread.  Probably hatred towards face coverings needed smoke, mostly. Can’t inside Paris. read article? Fauci said looking brightside ./ pretty much science is. process. learn middle school? Wut? Remove useless bot FFS. Whaaat...? way..... Bubble wrap. vaccine come two months. even about? realize herd immunity reason New York flat. governor took intense efforts curb spread. can't even go movies yet indoor dining. need go clinic, always nightmare...we typically wait hour appointment, people sit right next open seats everywhere, etc % mask wearing looks less see French TV Hella surprised considering many Ubers tell packed bars are, since middle August could foresaw this? much normal life terrible is, least together. wish Fauci said instead ""we need hunker down"". ""Dont look rosy side things"" know feel parents' parting remarks. would positive outcome (or moral basis for) encouraging child defy safety policies global pandemic?

Which, fun fact, pronounced Cyrillic “sorutat.” great! Keep good work, this! agree hot! lying.  Pfffft, like leapords going eat face? Yeah right. whole Travis Scott meal promotion strange.... 10-15 years citing presumably reading first article pops google ask long vaccine takes develop see without even opening article. Right? says process “often lasts 10-15 years” “usually”. really isn’t standard isn’t standard disease...not mention ridiculousness comparing vaccine development today vaccine development 1800s. Though unprecedented circumstances created unprecedented speed development, still close timeline initially given. said 12-18 months February. experts said that. speed surprising worrying experts. 

And no-the vaccine developers aren’t lazy, absolutely different level urgency (and funding) covid disease modern history. isn’t reasonable comparison. Hand masks fines.  vaccine probably three four months away,

Maybe you. 60 million Americans already virus- thus immunity- another 5 10 million get Thanksgiving, another 10-15 million front line medical workers get vaccine November December...

75 million people 330 measure immunity mean R value gonna plummet. Where? mean many parts world things almost back normal. upsetting me. people area refusing wear masks travelling. half hour one store lost 22 customers covid. source?  *You*...*decided*?

Well, I’m glad we’re listening experts look graphs lately? result nothing, countries start nothing, haha. yeah no, measures still taken. Sweden quite bad compared countries really good, general, look excess deaths current development, look bad people make be. Especially considering Sweden (especially Stockholm) hit pretty bad early people skiing Italy Austria. talking like over, not. Yeah, done initially, happy going pretty well now, infection decreasing since \~April? job epidemiologists ensure best outcome *in end*. said start COVID-19 stay, therefore done long-term strategy, ensure people grow tired restrictions start become reckless, such. Whatever helps sleep night, pal. Spot sir. you’ll never get anywhere people. both, brother. accept certain level risk every action. risk increases, behavior alter mitigate increased risk. instance, employers require workers drive inclement weather provide non-essential services absolutely terrible. parasites kind thing host, making behave ways ordinarily would not. virus inducing desire socialize impossible. Though would call far fetched without strong evidence. time stop restrictions social distancing. strange me. Can't stay home? Can't wear mask? Must go restaurants? research ""recovered"" means, ""long haulers"". DELETE FACEBOOK way keep contact friends, they're friends. makes say that?

Spain’s numbers resurgence started younger people ... it’s older people. It’ll happen. wait. No, applied whole population. Excluding 80+ results .54% IFR. yeah get you, got sick cold back june told parents started screaming covid lol. still tho, prolly hurt get test That's issue. think always temporary. guess Patriot Act temporary too, War Drugs. Loss Freedom usually temporary. even follow hypothetical situation, think happen leave box six months? family automatically saved? long? Would locked box another six months two weeks left? longer worth it? 200,000 dead teachers?  didn’t know COVID19 today, patients symptoms walking clinics hospitals, would classified ILI’s? (Influenza Like Infections)  Lmao, literally started it. Holy fucking shit. awful person. Immunity may last three months. thing discussed people know viruses. majority people take vacciene help create 3 month herd immunity virus dies apposed rotating cycle people getting sick. 


Old people ones risk. Young people develop pneumonia potentially need ventilators well. mention people may compromised immune systems, otherwise healthy. get decide right live jeopardy people scared poverty.

Once im advocating lock downs, im advocating people go little possible travel across country. Im advocating people wear masks keep distance keep hand sanitizer car. us know there's consequences care. 

And never said wear mask time, I'm going place requires masks I'm obviously going wear one. comes social gatherings friends don't/none us care. Indoor dining similar reopenings 50-100% capacity. People setting aside caution favour wishful thinking.  College students facing dilemma country right now- I'm positive. friends positive/ heavily exposed recently. party?
Nobody thinks right, mean come on, they're college kids Shaka, walls fell. metric people FLU allowed travel either. FLU kills 650k people per year. every year. vaccines. make sound like children died. haven't.

There still 1 person age 20 died covid-19 Sweden. small amount children high fever need hospitalization weeks sad, tragedy.

As parent two small children lot things frightening me, one those. None economically feasible, extrapolating Fauci saying here. no, fine software engineer, recognize number things live comfortable life shrinking probably take problem seriously.

edit: also fucking gross brag much money make time many people struggling. know proud callous. Name calling too. See nobody wants guys. McConnell looks like Kermit frog, like Kermit frog. Yeah man got som insulin cheap cheap? I’m gona go Walter white pay PPE classroom Canadian insulin problem is, COVID actually dangerous, people’s lives actually risk, actually need stay inside help beat - groups would profit. 

In event real, reaction would look exactly now. two related, likely end vaccine.

This absolutely false. could be, 2nd case, likely not. hell wrote even check anyone knows subject? really fear mongering lol It'll quick 2 weeks! Tops! Everyone wearing masks afterwards taking precautions Christmas. Don’t try reason delusional bud scumbag. Instead empathizing people enduring natural disaster, immediately start insulting saying people like them. Fucking ridiculous. Lol ooooo someone grumpy day. Yeah cause sitting restaurant annoying kids sounds really exciting haha People. specifically stupid ppl. 4. comparison March, there’s massive social distancing measures better hygiene care instilled everywhere? scientist absolutely nothing it. science say lockdown? 

Does science say anything deadlier flu must lockdown? kills hundreds thousands year. Heart disease kills more, yet science okay that. Hopefully get better future side. 

Our kids, age 5 8, hybrid option New Jersey we're using last weeks we've seen lots sports practices, scrimmages even softball games school property single parent mask distancing.

It became pretty clear driving district's ""need come reopening plan"" point decided remote both. Thank GOD Governor intelligence empathy require kids remote option. feeling correctly saw he'd putting parents minds ease reduce massive anxiety sending district like where, let's say, seems 30% town proverbial tail wagging dog.

My wife lucky work home freelance gig ending weeks it'll tough, nowhere near difficult must parents go work, want help kids keep safe, see bs going around school.

Somewhat ironically, right demand organized sports start (with almost zero reciprocal following guidelines done), school strict people around without masks distancing. actually good plan place keep students moving around windows open, upgrade filtration systems, etc., imo, goes window organized sports going weeks zero measures bare minimum parents kids likely engage behaviors could lead contracting virus.

It sucks... cause lose end. government much concerned short term viability. would care vaccine’s effects 10, 20 years? current leaders office won’t around deal  Oh look. Another article citing “White House official”. Suuurrrre let’s believe actual words democratic governors video. 🙄 AstraZeneca paused Phase III trials one participant Britain showed symptoms consistent transverse myelitis, rare neurological disease caused inflammation spinal cord. Obstacles like one unexpected vaccine development, experts say. fact AstraZeneca pausing trials investigate, point out, good thing—a signal system working should, drug companies taking safety seriously, scientific norms politics hasn’t trampled. No, see someone terrible reading comprehension skills would think so. point say nobody go back normal lives cases zero. fact, replied encouraging people hike go parks. Plenty socializing done, even person, maintaining safe distance. Refusing nothing pure selfishness. high schooler insults people calling high schooler.

That insult. statement. Anyone fully formed adult brain would know that. 

Anyway, real adult job, get back work now. fun getting virus. fuck lmao Nebraska even great. They've [treading water ~300 cases/day improvement. Less 2 million people live - would like Pennsylvania rocking 2k cases/day said fuck yeah, time end restrictions (PA 7-800 day, btw). Cannabis known anti-viral, already proven heavy cannabis users lower risk COVID-19 infection severity. 

This honestly awesome news. wish posts like here. blame them? Covid really affect average 30 year old person. Close proximity, self contained recycled air plane, food/drink supplied crew get close passengers. like cruise ship less space passengers. Well guidelines ISS (the italian CDC) none going check home. right verify time least bedrooms bathrooms separated. happen like say better paranoid catch it. case confirmed case person quarantining traveling back. far ok month ago.

How situation France? schools reopen? Fauci said maybe end next year. Ha! Quote said something mail voting giving extra 600 week unemployment though, thought nice..But stopped that. 😂 look many babies triggered. people want pandemic; makes lives little interesting. There’s pandemic every election year twats Yes, France extremely densely populated hit early. Compare Norway, Denmark, Finland warning, similar population density area 3 countries lockdown similar France much lower death rate Sweden. Sweden 5th deaths per-cap EU, France 5 times highest neighbor  Man fact people like californians moving states. Maybe take look consider ruined state instead insulting somebody even know. really Americans though. Looking many histories, tend upper class background, go Ivy League, become lawyers, later enter office. 

These differences superficial thus irrelevant context. Oh man, wish concrete answer this. 
Unfortunately mainstream media complicit, social media censors, workplace politics take effect, everyone around opposing viewpoint keep themselves, it’s hard label individuals crazy. get started, would look stands profit. government officials socialize costs fill pockets? pharmaceutical groups make 1000% higher profit margin vaccines generic drugs, can’t held liable harm? for-profit media subsidized external influence? thumbs get tired provide acceptable answer. Big pharma funeral services banking Cool? Like point tour comment? fucking moron lucky ok wear mask? completely free peace mind! don’t need false security like around people. content life. lot growing friend.  Surely “people” mean NFL players named Josh Bellamy, implying black monolith wire frauds PPP loans daily. Paywall. really bad logic. Also high schooler insults people calling high schooler... played yourself, fool! Internet bad? Sounds like town Georgia. They’re hosting indoor concerts events festivals downtown, it’s basically business usual Detroit schools reopened option person classes. Right positive percentage around 2.5% superintendent said anything 6 they'll go fully remote. I'm dumbfounded places double digits think opening schools good idea. [This Wuhan: Lift lockdown community cases 2 weeks, mass test everyone flush asympotomatic cases, enjoying mass pool parties

Europe: Lift lockdown ""only"" hundred community cases daily, mass testing, enjoying second wave.

I never understand logic behind cutting parachute land could started protecting elderly LTC facilities, governmentsubsidied, voluntary quarantine people risk groups. PSAs importance exercise vitamins. Generally encourage outdoor activity. Inform people safely low risk activities banning broad swaths safe activities (like closing parks beaches). Yup. season fat Texas comes celebrates shitty football teams. course. alone invalidate he's saying though. mean I'm wondering maybe agenda here. Maybe.  go back normal? masks, rest covid significantly, etc? I’m exhausted all. FHM's recommendation March 19th. advised people unnecessary travels within Sweden. Numbers rising Sweden well. important factor probably pick airline good mask policy, Delta example known strict. flight relatively low risk become airplanes good air exchange systems flight filtration systems ground, would avoid taking mask (i.e. drink water) plane flying, filters less effective air exchange. people talk near without masks on, ask flight attendant moved. airport, try physical distance much possible, stay far people talk without masks on, indoor transmission documented occur across 14 feet more. Fml link appreciate... Hopefully we're closer herd immunity lol Bet lots yelling, too.

Guess we’ll see. socializing outdoors. go indoors so. Winter gonna rough one. wonder deniers panicking ""lockdowns"" 'MuH RiGhTs!'

I hope none delicate snowflakes meltdown offer masks like patriotic tough guy Sesame Street theme park months ago punched kid working there. can’t support notion armed revolution foreign government’s special forces come onto U.S. soil enact change want. treasonous counter Constitution stands for.  Entirely unacceptable Hmm, know buy once. US daily cases dropping pretty consistently months hospitals full I've seen. joke thinking thing!! We'd still people deliberately ignoring defying pandemic response, we'd exactly position. remember month two ago reddit PHDs claiming HCQ protecting everyone Kind ironic Trump today attending memorial 2600 killed foreign agents, yet 75 times amount dead ineptitude president - person.. lost popular vote 3M. margin victory 70k voters across 3 states. Dem candidate high unfavorables, lot folks assumed would win. Trump none advantages time around.

But unfortunately advantage power entire system behind tries pull election fuckery. underestimate impact cheating. want THINK majority willing take would feel pressured taking too. Yeah completing census, last one 2012. assume something updated still date updating it. checks sent deadline census, thus 8 years date. everything conspiracy get trump office.  practice social distancing gone heavily recent weeks. Many people, especially young become tired Covid-19 wants life back normal even there’s increased risk infection. main factor behavior low transmission death rate. still wearing face masks using public transport, relying keeping distance avoid touching face unsanitized hands. 

Bars, gyms restaurants open there’s still law people inside 50 big crowdings allowed. Every day routine inspections authorities make sure bars restaurants follow rules failure could lead shutdown establishment. working hard oblivious. small risk. literally eat Covid. cannot survive stomach. problem makes assumption Americans opportunity governmental stage, even close true. believe it. Here’s video absolutely one wearing mask packed subway people hugging other. sound really confused. I’m sure you’re asking clarify. wondering people make dumb decisions spite best interests? 

There many different people choosing wear masks. many people don’t trust science scientists government. Lying help this. 

I’m sure look articles behavioral science understand better. wonder population angry, ignorant, hateful, unstable individuals armed teeth would truly believe dear leader unjustly overthrown. sub full bunch doom gloom antisocial neck beards looking excuse never leave mom’s basement again. cool story India never done 1.2million tests day, 7-day moving average 1.06 million.

But yes correct figures cited wrong. JHU dashboard little bit misleading; figures all-time averages.

For current 7-day moving average India 77 per 100k per day Spain 175 per 100k per Exactly never hear people talking rights rights others...it’s always MUH RIGHTS worked directly types scanners. see naked all. 60 million people infected. top advisor stated publicly 2019 everything wrong. said fact people didnt die disease rather response. think making mistake thinking voters well-informed making rational choices.  take this. American part like change feathers ruffled. grew family parties, going movies, ball games cook outs. American way. proper idea family time via zoom meeting wearing masks standing 6ft away relative like got plague. natural normal people. happens people like something? awhile rebel. saying good bad that's happening. see 8t over. think alot Americans point care anymore would rather take chance getting sick. sad say reality. glorifying actions, wear mask to, opted keep kids home remote learning know work home well. living sad, sad times gonna get better agree... different states regions, based population density alone (although factors) must different policies. can't expect Manhattan Bismark, ND behave way. (and should) consistency across country. Simple things like masks driven home national level. Measurements data tracking standardized across country. National guidance could given states based ranges metrics states could applied differently based local data. feels like Bojos got wrong though

Feels way too. can't run schools teachers get seriously sick. expose teachers high risk now, enough teachers run schools vaccine available. That's think used wrong tag lmao first surge almost entire year cares anymore. Find something else alarmed think actual ramped testing, tests readily available nation wide, faster test results, we're somehow getting less accurate picture things are? metric matters pire cases per population. dont die still facing long term illness possible lifetime organ problems. go tell 32 yo permanent breathing issues great shes dead yet Fauci career hallmarked stopping community spread two viruses could control wore condom mask aka mouth condom. 

He gonna die, go heaven tell God humans ain't worth it.  Wtf... realize fully understand coronavirus first learned it, right? needed run experiments find spread, infection rate, on. Whether likely passed surfaces, perhaps others (soft vs hard). facts evolved, experts changed recommendations masks American public. still learning more, like likely reinfection happen.

That *doesn't* mean Fauci trying deceive you. learning works. Canadian I've talked many fellow citizen U.S. yeah, sorry guys one. YEH MUH STATES RIGHTS 


/s think earlier greater vaccination too. Still WAY fucking high unsafe international travel right now? (thinking going US europe) grew virginia said pledge high school He’s polling better Ohio basically swing states. Hell, he’s polling better NC AZ, usually break conservative. think indicative Ohio becoming republican state anything else. all, check name ballot? person show ID hard falsify big number. someone sends ballot behalf half town population, checked? Another article another country guessing sweden. Sure, people might look wearing mask see seldom. nothing that.  case, LA county Health Director. Troll dungeon!! Entitlement dialed 11. googled “Should children 2 wear mask?” every site including CDC repeated said. covid deadly never satisfied I'm depressed too. part get Trump 60/40 advantage Biden *Hispanics.* guess 'legal' immigrants follow 'fuck got mine' mindset. rest world though. reason known Germans also generally healthy. Lower obesity diabeties rates US Can’t second surge first surge never ends 🤔 No, happens actually start testing decent rate. took 6 months. explain 260k excess deaths US year compared normal year?  Sweden actually poorly first, one major city rest country sparsely populated. went Stockholm cases deaths right there. comparable US, large country many densely populated areas. Sweden also much healthier thinner country, near many risk people per capita compared US. Even then, still one highest deaths per capita world.

Also misinformation Sweden took action dangerous misleading. still ban gatherings 50 people prevent superspreading, left ban place fairly late. also advised public take precautions, public since Sweden fairly obedient easy going populous. also capacity limits restaurants, bars, shops, etc... many officer workers still working home. Offices huge place transmission. 

While Sweden never official lockdown (we US either tbh, business restrictions states, actual enforced lockdown) shutdown, lots safety measures place, large percent population still took precautions. People twisted ""Sweden nothing they're fine"" fit narrative. dangerous misinformation. many reasons noted.

And yes, virus kills less 1% overall, death metric measure virus in. QAL greatly decreased way 1% cases. Even missing cases assume least around 5% hospitalization half cases ICU cases. ICU cases definitely suffering long term damage. many hospitalized. 1/3 reported cases long haulers. Studies showing even mild asymptomatic cases cause heart inflammation scarring among problems. Lung scarring normal C19. They're also seeing damage kidneys, pancreas, liver, brain. Organ damage occurs much higher percentage cases influenza cold virus. studies suggest 50%. doubts long term damage end high, even 5% likely probable, low ball guess, detrimental American public. 

Trying measure damage done virus damage immediate deaths fool's errand. first many metrics judge by. Spanish Flu caused bacterial infections afterwards killed many people virus itself. C19 causing heart complications already seeing recovered patients dying strokes, heart attacks, etc... months clearing virus. unsure much could problem future, information there, smart error side caution.

On top looking confirmed deaths, plus excess deaths, inflated pneumonia death total (like 4x average yearly total already) looking around 300k Americans dead already, maybe more. ways go. Spanish Flu three waves killed roughly 700k Americans considered deadly pandemic modern age. back lot medicine medtech like antibiotics example existed too. limited ways treat respiratory infection back then. COVID already half way century later. definitely ""nothingburger"" stretch imagination. numbers mitigation too. everyone running around recklessly would surely close million deaths. 

Between possible damage high death count, risks virus real. think sub skews side ""omg world ending"" huge overexxageration. take bad. C19 bad worst case scenarios first presented, still catastrophic event worldwide going disrupt economies either way, event ended many lives needlessly. 

There much beyond deaths virus immediately caused. Hospitals spend time funds treating COVID patients makes others get worse care. world patients coming car accidents, heart attacks, etc... probably could lived, instead die ERs ICUs overtasked.

I could go on, get picture. Trying judge disease immediate deaths (which lot still close 1000 day average US alone) like trying judge cake based top layer frosting. lot cake dissect it. might something there! First thing German dad enters family home open windows. matter cold outside. almost ritual him. *selected Yeah, making big assumption Biden win. I'm already mentally preparing worst.

Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc respresentative voting actually play out. internet likes scream terrible is, terrible, mean get votes beat Biden. 

Way many people assuming he's gonna lose, that's last time. America: best one wave entire time. Still hour work minimum wage even enough Big Mac. live US, people register? visit office person check ID? yes kinda goes convenience vote home. no, check person actually register someone else mass? backlog 2+ weeks Yup, Bumfuck Louisiana (population 1850 people, 6855 wild dogs) immune virus. odds? Cdc updated death count accurately depict many people US actually died coronavirus serious conditions like 90 years old. like 8k people something like that, 8k lot speculated poorly judged ventilator treatment people like Cuomo touted much early on.

In otherwords completely disingenuous. Kanye pulled basically votes Trump times he’s polled. It’s hard claim third parties primary cause outcome 2016 election third-party voters *did second choice* would stayed home preferred candidate dropped out. 1) medical training have?

2) Since area longer outbreak (care reference source claim?), must over. even finish school confidently make statement? 

3) 'sensationalized' media professionals, probably close way career, warning everyone since March, people like kept parroting opinions form yourselves. know death toll.

Now confidently tell medical professional wrong without using hurt feelings opinions? used live started frightened friends Henan health care bad really really want move back Henan. Meanwhile, countries enjoying freedoms sucked wore masks months social 

Which countries those? Australia, one biggest states currently draconian lockdown? New Zealand, also currently level 3 lockdown? one many European countries seeing record number cases increased restrictions? way year gone, I’m going assume 2020 going last another 4 years. Maybe preventative measures Covid-19 also reduced spread flu? Fear monger sub backlog, fact data see test results 2-7 days usually. happens deaths.

Today's jump 12k, cases day. work delivery service iowa true every single bar go into. got words always get side eyed. Yeah, really frustrating competent person room. know dude bites tongue, honestly. I'm trying understand afraid unafraid relying consensus scientific community. think unprescidented times, okay err upon caution. 

Saying second wave NYC known matter, numbers produce account variables matter. must agree else shame scientific pride.

I scientist. arguments literally equally lacking amount scientific rigor response ""I act impunity believe know variables literally way possibly get bad NYC.""

I'm calling respecting whole picture. clearly idea talking can't handwave away statistic. many? rate? seem fake. read letter 5 times disbelief. go walk outside USA dick hanging end jail. second part comment basically true. Swedish strategy much closer herd immunity without vaccine - Tegnell confirmed supported - countries listed, countries world even. Sweden lost lot citizens due this, much countries listed, per capita sometimes even raw numbers.

And despite tiny country 70 kids severly sick due covid related syndrome (compared 700 much, much larger US). Yeah you’re right, won’t much it. I’ll wear mask like everyone else listen anything that’s enforced, fuck else want do? SHARK TOOK MAH WIFE. FUCKING LIBERALS US among last western nations legalize sex marriage.

No wasn't, completely arbitrary pointless criteria.

Switzerland among last legalize women's suffrage, thoughts quality life there?

I walk shop buy cannabis half US, meanwhile completely illegal ""amazing"" Germany, Denmark, Australia etc. dem apples? It’s personally. speak yourself. were. stay home, they've properly quarantining, people present actually already tested positive... that's lot 'if's; seem gotten point missed it: stay home, yeah, that's problem - considering actions - exactly makes think they're going stay home properly quarantine? problem. Please explain 250,000 excess deaths year. Dude feel fucking much. 


If anyone tried talking anti-masker - - civic duty try also fully comprehend absolutely malicious buffoonery it. Exactly this. Lack cohesive guidance created mess. Hopefully new president change that. half alive state continue perversive, rapid free tests vaccine. 750 deaths day thus far things still pretty awful. future say masks effective, wearing dont believe them, even though people knew whole time masks effective? really hope majority voters smarter that. wouldn’t believe country tried hide virus info less year ago. full body scans underpaid security people look naked.

what ?? happens lot rural Midwest spend time working. heard people much patience essentially zero quip back pretty harshly. clients get pretty upset it, comfortably retire tomorrow want to, eat ass far I'm concerned.

Are Clorox choose longer hermit wear mask social distance public.


I get frustration, shit like flying going Cancun hardly seem like necessities. Ah ICE, can't get job anywhere else law enforcement can't pass lie detector, ICE ya. Yeah, that's gonna work.  article fluff. Kind interesting read, speculative meaningless. editorial based single excerpt Rand's journal, quotes Paul Ryan, Justice Thomas, Alan Greenspan, along plenty ""translation"" author, doubt read Ayn Rand novels. understand coming from, even know fact herd immunity achievable virus. Take look Sweden went herd immunity approach. exactly call effort (or lack thereof) success means. Bush's FEMA actually went way deny USFS help douse fires New Orleans flooded electrical fires happening place, refused USFS help identify damaged trees resulted removal thousands bald cypress hundreds years old hurricane blew needles, refused deliver medicine refugees refused deliveries medicine intended refugees vendors approved FEMA, 91,00 tons ice (at cost $100 MM dollars) preserve food medicine never appeared resources sent early expired unusable, licensed doctors came volunteer given mops people around died FEMA declaring non-FEMA certified people generated much liability, FEMA blocked 50+ civilian aircraft dozens Walmart tractor trailers came help evacuate civilians, etc. etc. etc.

Not really sure would getting downvoted above, I'd guess Republicans people politically aware Katrina. quick overview: gone far suggest response Katrina 2005 straw broke camel's back Bush's support similar things J Kush did: mismanagement Katrina generated internal refugee crisis million people displaced southern Lousiana (this approximately half number internally displaced Iraq Iraq War point, instead taking 2 years constant bombardment took two months FEMA refusing ameliorate situation): high talkers? correlation there? oh whoops typo. meant trump. confuse two time lol I'm sure, think tbh, think so? deaths aren’t going nearly rate back March April

yet. 

you lack foresight, point probably qualifying disability pension point reaction covid 100x 9/11. little far worse much. can't prepared. 

Your son-sequitur hunger argument reminds cool internet guide saw once:

**How make straw man argument:**

**1) Ignore real argument:** ""Did know 9 million people die year hunger?""

**2)Create pretend argument:** ""Is acceptable you? ""

**3)Defeat pretend argument:** "" sit hands people starve everyday generally live life?"" 

***4)Claim victory?*** proof that? hospitals saying ""they're lying we're full"" cause hospitalizations down. what's proof schools drastically spiked infections, done way increased hospitalizations deaths?  Lol! meant end first week august. First day august really reflects July lol ur insane plane cabin that's actually risky unlike restaurants high particle filtration &amp; high recirculation inside plane. However, waiting HOURS inside enclosed terminal/boarding area connecting flights. takes one super-spreader removes mask eat/drink. opt travel, get N95's, KF94's, KN95's, keep times! see terminal outside smoking section sit &amp; wait layovers. everyone turned Covid denier today? know getting downvoted buddy. Take upvote. Considering every country battling second waves US middle endless wave...I don’t see anyone criticize Sweden anymore.

Should protected elderly vulnerable more? Yes NY/NJ/UK. 🤷‍♂️ Italy, Spain, UK Belgium deaths per capita. country report. Looking excess death data Portugal Netherlands deaths well. Excess data pretty good measurement.  Chinese Americans started January since got play play relatives. know say without getting removed, I'll leave link would like learn Looking post history, think may sarcasm (they appear fan Tegnell). speak much passion speak much! fault language! Last time got confronted yelled ""but supposed suck freedom's dick mask on, man?!?"" best Randy Savage impression fucked off. Probably helps I'm bigger dude. Im chef. Since may ive suspected this, known, people go dine restaurants unprotected come hell corona. makes feel im part problem providing people place make problem worst.

I never considered another career now.  I'm Southern European living Germany and... must living different Germanies. severe measures (not lockdown never place here) tired seeing people streets; supermarkets always find people wearing mask nose completely loose; open areas full people? mask, precaution; young people? Barbecues riverbanks even worst moments, groups young drunkards every weekend, teenagers running around summer long... neighborhood super pissed Christmas markets cancelled.. summer biggest concern go buy ice cream.

Of course long term hurts cancer turn expensive treatments simple biopsy. Someone downvoted you’re absolutely correct. Livesoylence unscientific fearmongering. wonder nobody trusts so-called 'experts'. Lotsa packed bars up'a nort'e. I've noticed bunch dipshits Minocqua lately too.

### State reports 56,000 tests one day

Currently, IDPH reporting total 257,788 cases, including 8,273 deaths, 102 counties Illinois. age cases ranges younger one older 100 years. preliminary seven-day statewide positivity cases percent total test September 4 – September 10 3.9%.  Within past 24 hours, laboratories reported 56,661 specimens total 4,632,382.  last night, 1,619 people Illinois reported hospital COVID-19.  those, 359 patients ICU 155 patients COVID-19 ventilators.   

Following guidance Centers Disease Control Prevention, IDPH reporting separately confirmed probable cases deaths [website](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19).  Reporting probable cases help show potential burden COVID-19 illness efficacy population-based non-pharmaceutical interventions.  IDPH update data week.

\*All data provisional change. order rapidly report COVID-19 information public, data reported real-time. Information constantly entered electronic system number cases deaths change additional information gathered.  Information death previously reported changed, therefore, today’s numbers adjusted.  health questions COVID-19, call hotline 1-800-889-3931 email [dph.sick@illinois.gov](mailto:dph.sick@illinois.gov). saying someone comes along point glaringly obvious, pushing agenda disagree with?

But, let's play game second:

1. lie.
2. apply US.
3. great news.

All factually correct, however leave important context. Chief among Germany virus much tighter control US. US achieved level containment Germany enjoys, could reopen schools SAFELY well. However, painfully obvious US yet. argue otherwise lunacy. article great news means safe reopening schools possible GET THERE.

There's group (I assume) conservative pro-T posters like act like bunch Negative Nancys, reality simply speaking truth difficult times. choose ignore freight train bearing us claim tracks perfectly safe. freight train wishing differently wont make go away. react suffer consequences.

We want disease go forever. want return normal lives. also realize get point requires certain measures, include wearing masks, social distancing, enforcing social distancing locking metrics set experts area met. would much less prolonged process bunch people choose ignore reality actively sabotage efforts. do, something taken month two dragged four.

You want get back semblance normal? put big boy boots, man (or woman) up, f--king follow advice experts know talking about. Yes, always right new novel learning every day, right way often wrong WAY often political pundits ignore them.

Look, plenty pieces good news, thousands people world DIE every day, quite bit bad news. groups political agendas spreading false hope, significant need look good news critically. real hope found, blindly believe lies saying everything fine, things continue get worse. Ah yeah you’re right *just* printing money, also government tracking via phone arresting you’re predetermined designated grid. Flawless plan, really.  2019 university Minnesota made articles pneumonia china. point assign blame climate change find solution... merely argue capitalists politicizing it. lockdown strategy depends vaccine. vaccine mass produced public Dec/Jan okay. takes till Spring/Summer 2021 full lockdowns bad strategy. 

The thing EU didnt turn masks lockdowns. think Germans still care social distancing. clear: schools told parents would give information pupils tested postive. suddenly hit probably can't give confidential information pupils health status.

Very poorly handled Uppsala, nothing Tegnell, part secret plot achieve herd immunity. pretty much many Asian countries already doing. stats normal flu season infections in, say, Japan vs US/Europe?

Edit: spent minutes Google Scholar trying answer question. luck, [this interesting, surprising: face mask usage associated behaviors reduce risk, like frequent hand washing avoiding crowds. well-designed study looking flu infection rates mask usage would account behaviors. Stop thinking critically resume consooment media lest hive downvote you!!! Sweden currently fine propagandist. eating restaurants problematic, think represents-- people taking risks disregarding risks (such eating restaurants) big picture here.

These people also exposing larger social circle, bringing people homes going people's homes, going maskless, keeping distance, etc. honestly think poor public health messaging mixed selective comprehension. pretty easy see going long-term lifestyle change COVOD treatment vaccine back March, message communicated public health experts. People seemed think flattening curve short-term campaign goal allow healthcare facilities capacity treat sick. governments coming little two week increments, people heard arbitrarily declared date, would over. 

There's national mitigation strategy, hodgepodge local health departments trying influence states, states compromise politics science. public hearing many different messages, selectively hearing optimistic ones, getting frustrated accusing scientists wrong lying. France done anywhere near amount tests US done, even per capita.

Why think European case numbers now? much testing. know communication back, White House hospitals, asking bypass CDC report data directly HHS, know came that. flair “Europe” “European Union”.  it’s correct one use. rights stop other's rights begin. least work.

Otherwise lowest common denominator, since highly populated country, 1 person make hundreds thousands miserable making choices.

Last checked, there's thousands laws rules America. act like first time ever told collective decisions. 


I mean, say yourself: ""Follow CDC guidelines, uniform"". PM annonced little bit ago consult specific regions case case basis proceed. far plan shut down. asked people take better personal responsibilities respect sanitary obligations asked mandated. Half country locking inside house weeks?

going 6 months east coast. :/  government leader

No don't- random un-elected bureaucrat talking something unrelated, evidence taking actions limit liberty citizens based upcoming election

Sounds like hysterics send chill spine.

lol no, tend get scared out-of-context media clips Yet death rate fraction first wave

Before someone says “it’s testing” show facts, see doesn’t come close explaining decrease sad, lot people care!!! lot good points. agree lack preparedness countries really understated. 

Taiwan’s success mostly preparedness.

Bill Gates telling anyone would listen decade needed prepare this.

Lockdowns, masks, testing, tracing, none work vacuum without others. holistic system solve problem. far Taiwan done it. don’t forget head next BLM protest!  Criminal. yet almost nobody dying, what's problem? didn’t get hit hard peak- would another peak?

It's amount fuel burn fire. Bigger cities already burned brush. Rural areas Mexico, Argentina, Spain, France would like speak you. cold people go places much. areas matter hopefully get cold winter force people inside. disgust. passing anything going break, even voting house bill also making focus nation. isn’t story every single day every democrat office beyond me. 

However, don’t think cutting pay wouldn’t get change beyond whatever takes get pay back. wouldn’t create nearly level hurt concern millions facing. Cut pay staff, maybe they’d hear we’re talking people generally could go years without pay got truly bad (not watching savings dry good items weather storm sure).

Now find (magical) way make live unemployed essential retail constitutes make, forced random roommates own, going outside work zoom every day without family weeks... think astronomical number people remember free money wasn’t enough. so? bad popular vote doesn’t matter close race. Well said! le opposite expectorated... shutdowns since march mid september Katrina hit 2005 lost everything whole world came together helped. much 2020 He's pushing clean energy, progress climate change, progress healthcare, restoration international alliances, acceptence science, lot traditionally democratic policies. 

He also ignore Russian bounties troops, ignore pandemic, pilfer funds 9/11 first resoonders. 

There whole ton differences. Pretty damn sure Dan's going try cancel elections. really give damn progress United States sure hell would support candidate continue hold free fair elections. would think allowing GOP four years rig elections Across Nation would way help progressive agenda? That's even touching issue Supreme Court, entirely necessary Trump prevented appointing justices. MERV 13 better furnace filters.

cut up.

&amp;#x200B;

.... viola. N95 grade filter Per capita? don’t. Add that, schools guidelines either. districts addressing hvac. ones open hvac changes requiring masks outbreaks. ones require masks nothing address hvac/ventilation immediately outbreaks.

At point, know fact hvac adjustments bring fresh air wearing masks times school building absolutely works.

What really sucks feds funded upgrading hvac schools summer. Schools already designed state federal assets military disaster purposes. designed withstand distasters. Every school built since cold war era. feds could added air quality standards schools used disaster shelters, ventilated enough avoid spreading disease.  common sense add guidelines govern school construction. translates 50k US. know, REALLY BAD NUMBERS hard imagine needs said world pandemic transmitted people breathing. create system pay income, sales, property ownership money available times like this.....oh wait..... they're giving megacorps pay also stock market....FUUUUUk . OMG said it. thinking thing. seriously confused ""right"" thing do. dined restaurant yesterday since want take back home. Like makes terrible person now?? thought helped business chose spend cash eat there. also order delivery lot since thought helped restaurant delivery dude, apparantly also ""wrong"" like wtf?? Idk what's right wrong anymore, wanna eat man that's it! Huh? I'm saying going shit show everyone act like pandemic Thanksgiving. 


You're agreeing me, unless I'm really misunderstanding comment. Uhhhh, really. 

I accept may wrong. accept study vaguely remember may remembering incorrectly. I’m willing change mind. 

Hell, first statement “you may right”. No, not. Germany decentralized system states make decisions regarding public health. Merkel little it. Probably half kids currently school would never return standard. American revolution started ultra-wealthy oligarchs literally afraid slavery, source wealth, going banned colonies. George Washington literally moved New York Pennsylvania avoid losing slaves laws started changing. even get started Thomas Jefferson child rapist. amazing many people seem understand founding fathers over-privileged scumbag oligarchs like Trump. work first time, work 2nd time. Honestly everyone takes proper precautions wear fucking mask could beat many selfish pricks. Essentially, want avoid anything causes inflammation. Sugar that. happened 6 months ago, get already. know overlords lost millions economic stalling, okay billionaires. common people get cardiac disease, pulmonary disease chronic fatigue Covid, ones going pay. Except comes avoiding public bathrooms. described scenario China much lying. read? go vegan folks! planet thnak it, immune system. SBA loans forgivable loans. Meet X criteria pay back.

Your second sentence missing words clarify going pay back UI. Employees? Employers? scenario talking about? leadership would wonderful isn’t case many people don’t use mask don’t want to, imbecile « I can’t breathe » shit 

Boomer hard time using young people don’t care lol 8x testing. half? Fuck that's good sounds like antimask's hopium. they're though. Sure, occasional 1/10000 is. people try isolate preexisting conditions age, can't 100%, pay price getting sick people spread virus. credit union requires live area. still use cards outside area fees, home base here.

Ive never paid single fee. Well 1 overdraft fee years ago, called forgave instantly. questions asked. also really decent interest rates savings accounts. =D obviously running view point filter life experiences can't really blame you, experience neither rare, norm. everyone poor falls vast judgmental grouping. fructose fructose matter came from, exact molecule point wasnt saying anything liver. Fructose extract plant fructose create synthetically exactly Wasn’t like overwhelming majority tho 55/45 add brexit, European Union labelled reason reject independence remain EU (what happened then) way uk government performing pandemic...... Ah ok. thing saw shared day said Fauci. found odd said ready election like two three days later. anyone be. Here's idea. *you* look up, *you* math, *you* report back findings. right - whether realize - trolling tactic used right pursuit ""it's hoax"" conspiracy theories. mean stadium pretty big 5000 well placed may cause problem Panacea Omg satanic crap coming sudden?? place! Lol bitching bars? literally everything else still open?  Crazy day cases peaked also day CDC forced stop collecting data cases. Seems totally legit! lost faith US government, CDC, FDA, still faith nothing “sway” Dr Fauci recommending approval vaccine unsafe. Really grasping straws here, huh? guess people can't stand lose argument. McConnell walking around Chinatown San Francisco late February telling people “Don’t worry it”? maybe NYC mid-March telling people go daily lives. don’t know thought cold killed COVID-19 :( germans count deceased way? thought I'd heard something testing deceased elderlys, wouldmake great difference, since big proportion french's corona toll. ...or know, social support needed take drugs poverty literally denied lobbied rich folk...but yea, fuck dem poor people! know smoking Reefer turns violent BLM/Antifa RiOters!!!!! think liberal cities buRnInG!!!

Yeah let vote one two old white fucks understand doing, don’t research debates/interviews, don’t believe science, facts education tell people “I don’t work you” public servant. 

We’re voting color tie president wear next 4 years point. 

Can’t blame voters turn still two bullshit options. think placebo evened phases...otherwise point know taking placebo someone shown leadership, told everyone take precautions... dad works restaurant every time comes home we’re paranoid I’ve always said anyone dumb enough go dine right type people don’t take pandemic seriously 😔😔 Meh government done nothing pull chain around. dont care everyone dies. past 6 months I've probably spent equivalent 4 months alone tiny studio apartment. got apartment place eat sleep spend time working exploring city. whole industry shut exploring I've able riding bike past bunch closed shops bars.

I one friend city, cousin person I've kind regular interaction past 6 months despite seeing maybe week. I've found falling deeply love despite knowing full well really kinds feelings her. pandemic fucked mental health ways never thought even possible.

I even get bed 1pm, apartment complete mess zero motivation anything it. feel like I'm constant downward spiral. Wish American would get guts same. Snoopchoot Coronavirus care constitutional rights. certain group convinced poor poor temporary, poor keep supporting certain group. I'm afraid happen. see, country soap opera government system. present us 3 options. polar opposite parties stay foaming mouth attack infringe upon other. maverick weirdo party sides point laugh extreme ideas. 
Basically served us much division inducing propaganda dumbed us point we're happy take dump company time. Last year death rate 7.3 per 1000 people.

This year, it'll significantly higher. Exactly. Sure someone might die Covid someone who’s felt increasingly hopeless might end see way anymore. Dyor get it. stop spreading misinformation fruits bad liver.

 already seeing cases spread schools around Texas teachers getting sick. College probably count statistics, US college outbreaks first week, 31 clusters, amounting 150 cases, novel coronavirus schools, according Germany’s Robert Koch Institute. least 41 schools Berlin reported affected first two “The important thing keep number community low,” said Huebner, also head infectious-disease department Munich’s Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital. “This United States problems.”

 Ha.. Community cases low.. Texas.. everywhere... sound like free-pass children schools, confirmation low community cases make general life safer. Piss off. Seriously. reopening sacrifices made, stop acting like baby, NYC one worst hit going act like wasn't.

There's shit ton people country done thing mitigate virus since beginning, yeah, I'm pretty fucking comfortable saying ""not everyone hunkered down"". stop selfish worldview bullshit.

I dont want people fight battles. cant fight without putting innocent children risk. Read article please!!

It says ""Covid INCIDENTS"". incident father calls son may something (if son 0.3 extra ° fever example).

Please think Covid serious stuff reacting, help.

I read Reddit weeks ago people seemed think US would reach 100k day soon, 200k, then... guys better right now.

Some people asked Covid going reach 1 million cases day, globally overall months ~less 300k.

Pandemic going end socially soon way vacines anything act irrational pure negationist.

(I'm spanish direct examples ""incidents"" moment). One symptoms flu increased desire social interactions. kidding.  ever go. school. Nothing much different except also forest Kindergarten waldorf schools normally outside much time. China first useable vaccine fuel conspiracy rumors. biggest myth pushed around.

The pandemic would ""over.""

Everything currently US would still done sitting 3k 4k fewer cases per day.

Why?

Because basically go down. X level socialization corresponds level growth (or decline).

Israel double digit new cases daily. today? Locking again. 

Now, get wrong, area curve matters spent May, June, July better would much better place schools started opening, would still need keepbars closed, wear masks, limited capacity restaraunts, quarantining get symptoms, etc.

You also risking family. may kill them. wonder mental health happens?  believe did, article 2 weeks ago stating KC brink national hot zone thing making outdoor activity safer indoor particle dispersal UV light. Seeing morbidly obese man 50 face shield proven help virus actually increase risk without use accessories absolutely exercise hubris. hope everyone tonight's game fine I'm wrong. close schools close offices probably eliminate 50% flu transmission right there. I've COVID deaths 40/50 - always obese person, seems common. usually kinda overweight borderline overweight/obese, usually quite obese. Yeah knew. Look woodward tapes, trump knew aerosol transmission February 7th!

That's waaaaaay declared it. shit who, shit us sharing earlier. Who’s enforcing this? fucking NYPD? Fucking brownshirts. read studies. lock friend. 6 months ago, advised wearing masks could saved many lives stopped exponential spreading virus. admitted wanted prevent shortage masks. That's use dental dam. Cool I’ll stop paying bills. sure choice either try work survive hunker eventually happens mortgage payments, utilities.

lol tricks kids mean...hopefully works better last time started celebrate worst Covid Nah, I'm good. Honestly, thinning herd point seem like big problem. South Dakota, example. I'm fine it

PS: smart wonderful person SD, Godspeed. Stay safe dummies dead; much nicer state anyway. I’m you. deaths went 0/1 per day county several million people decided trashing mental health wasn’t worth it. mean I’m afraid meet friends small groups eat outside, etc national vaccine injury program already reality. corona vaccine would covered it. 2006, October 2019, $4.2 Billion awarded. lot injury.

And vaccine needed hit 50% efficacy absolutely would take longer develop. would go back mod adjuvants get better immune response. trash study publicly correct penn state FYI Yeah even couple cans BigStuff strategic spots make lot difference.

Had drafty apartment you’d get frost bottom wall near balcony winter.. pulled trim sprayed foam, made world difference website links directly medical article. think even clicked link. inability even understand dynamics situation

I understand perfectly. leadership chance something, instead decided stick ""it's going go away"" line, ""We need hunker get fall winter it’s going easy"" healthcare workers still hard pressed obtain PPE.

What exactly understanding, ad hominem got? it’s really hard keeps seeming like virus isn’t even bad thought was.

200,000 people dead, 1,000 every day. restrictions COVID brought resulted families locked home, family happens abuser fairly apparent what's going happen"" Meanwhile country opening everything ever existed nearly 100k cases/day. 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️ let em. science. ""I wish way know good old days actually left them."" Yeah 1% death like 10 times rate flu. shape pandemic would look very, different tiny study true. Far higher death hospitalization rates, increasing rather decreasing get farther in, orders magnitude greater number known reinfections.

Don’t usually say emerging research, quite obviously horseshit. Shut outside inside tent? headline misleading leads people believe caught virus teaching, false. Rest Peace beautiful soul, dangerous headline. I’m anyway. Get test advance, that’s every time I’ve stayed them. cannot alone Christmas. Ur assuming live family Sad existence hating people supposed closest to. wonder got point? interesting people die

Give us dirty laundry! You’ll drive crazy trying avoid family members. you’re home family social distancing isn’t necessary. Let’s hope real President Same! cough around end dec middle January. I’m convinced COVID bc wife everyone ranch December similar symptoms Totally agree. 

I'm 100% wearing masks public, social distancing, contact tracking, quarantine people infected. 

But seriously heck happened let's flatten curve? there's weird impossible goal zero infections. That's absolutely impossible long term, completely reckless economically. Test came back negative (specifically said ""not found""). share centralized HVAC, debate back forth whether run AC unit(s) earlier summer proximity window units. finally gave ran top floor unbearable them. Oh look, forgot Taiwan again! Funny Oh, thought meant unemployed. realize still working.

I wish data math skills chase little thread down! lol situation here. really unfortunate time move new city. one hand, we're lucky jobs right let us WFH lockdowns. other...living alone new place without social connections. like isolation x10 worse it.

Honestly...how much longer person live like this? We're social animals. want ""small government?"" Well looks like folks, government. Freedom would nice persistent dry cough... least bar ""I linked directly numbers. 7 day average clearly peaked Aug 30 31 state.""

That's claim. stating states clearly reached peak. qualify way indicate fact ""peak"" may highest they've yet reached thus temporary. waiting week declare worst (which peak signifies) acceptable, could narrow next day instead? yesterday 100 cases highest record today 99 cases, declare peaked yesterday soon? 

That's pointed different ""peaks"" state reached since pandemic began apart peak declaring. looked past 10 days reported cases particular state reach conclusion, likely make faulty assumptions. Wtf course realize that, mental? state’s got second worst governor nation. You’re fool running inferences Test came back negative (specifically result ""not found""). Good know bacterial infections - I'd never heard before. Current best theory related smoke wildfires, odd thing seemed like started particulate levels area started going up. Thank you, yeah wild ride her. Bartending. make friday Saturday alone that's way unemployment  goal UBI, left-leaning STEM workers less enemy than, say, Republican.

I agree government give aid. US far behind developed country terms covering impacted individuals... really sad. Hello there. Even I’m wearing condom? really seems like Koreans saying back February - aerosolized, reinfection possible, probably worse - Reddit shouted anecdotal entirely true, finding covid virulent Asians said towards beginning year. Arizona, sunbathing 116 F practical.

The evidence vit lock, harm chug 6000-8000 IU per day. That's right, teachers obese, 80+, several comorbidities. forget November 4th. saw headline ""cottage party"" **definitely not** thought going death rate people 40 literally .1% lol relax happen everywhere. name calling thing hurt feelings?  Maybe, particular case downvoting ""US self hatred"" rather inability realize problem complete failure US federal government control spread within country. That’s point all. even sure come conclusion rereading comment.

It isn’t judgment all—it’s truth happening. Obese people dying higher rates.

I’m sure fact make evil? mean loans paid back full? patience anything wear mask, social distance public, wash hands. work home alone day hate it. Kids go school can’t go damn office? cannot survive winter don’t leave house. cannot handle gym closing again. need human interaction somewhere. Enjoying patios summer lifeline. need see family. trip somewhere happening everything closes am. can’t another lockdown. cognitive dissonance must exhausting. mean work home? fuckead company said come back, use kitchen, go eat, basically sit cell 9 hours talk anyone No. true (a huge caveat, 20% recovered patients vulnerable new infection within weeks we'd seeing different case curves many documented reinfections now) means one form natural immunity work well hoped. Vaccines work ""shock awe."" replicate severe infections, meaning strong active immune response, large percentage population time. take population quickly herd immunity, even temporary, cause virus die far back. vaccine (including successful time, polio) eliminates virus completely. ruining economy save bunch fat diabetics going die anyway?? know ton people got covid symptoms. Quarantine weak let everyone else live damn lives. Theres vaccine unless force everyone stay home 1 month straight, nothing going change. going stop virus. stop destroying businesses peoples mental health. fat fuck that's going die get covid, stop leaving house complaining others. Carlin said best talking people complaining government. us. 

""Garbage in. Garbage out."" Lol maybe I'm Plus exposing health care workers illness someone exposed needs treated. know many health care workers worldwide died treating illness significant. Wrong. disproven simply checking CDC website. dishonest you? USA gets bunch military economic allies approve it? Like Canadians, French, British, Germans, Indian, etc ??? Dr Fauci we're much winning say Merry Christmas again! /s know of, school far one. guy deliver pizza mess? 

We live vacuum, dude. actions affect others - that's we're seeing, Americans straight care people. Lol, neither. get paper coupon kind of, wait need something CVS (can’t use toward prescription, it’s redeemable anything else carry). I’m sure expiration date; I’ll need keep eye it. Tell dumb college kids I’m surrounded keep pandemic parties American, rookie numbers. Dennis Quaid Day Tomorrow That’s like....exactly tried beginning Young people tough spot.  Imagine basically take years 21-23 life.  either.  easy older people, including millionaire doctors, say everybody stay locked homes years shut up.  realistic. pandemic response account fact humans recognize finite nature lives, value mental health, generally willing take many risks enhance life maintain mental health. Oh hear? see STATES fault cuz decide everything, can't blame national leaders apparently.  bars opened (with food), well ones Tampa. difference even bar (that serves food loop hole system) still patrons seated table, can’t walk bar, order drink, stand walk away. 

Some bars SoHo food, granted many patrons eat there, allowed remain open closure. still, act bar, seated, frustrating want walk order drink, guess that’s point, reduce number patrons walking in, raise question safe sitting bar table, still remain safe bar 50% capacity ? Viva La France keep changing rules. I'm small business. Paid employees 1099, gave bank applied. approved it. spent 100% payroll. 1099 payments longer count forgiveness. sound bank, lot people qualify forgiveness. Translation: it’s necessary eat front people insisting could kill illogical weird. Eat home year. 

Or car. would argue even moreso states. Look Florida's unemployment system completely failed people. Selfish ignorant stupid Americans ANYTHING want regardless doctor tells them. 

Because “MuH FrEeDoMS!!!!”

Americans lack empathy ever living questioning anything go someone need “what’s me?” 200% correct least live knowing tried best. saw adult daughter first time 6 months. commented pale look. limit long person stay isolated alone. think I've reached it. 

I allow take order every Friday same. Even favorite restaurants' food taste fresh flavorful time get home. miss dining out.  Sounds like area Good sending mail free? slipping habit too. keep drink bottle packed iced water times make sure buy alcohol midweek (I willpower it’s house). 

Yesterday crap day last night thought “man want sit glass (/bottle) wine distract myself”. Thankfully lazy go shop, morning feel 1000x better drinking bunch water instead. 

Maybe could try water thing? iced - won’t drink it’s room temperature. usually try finish bottle 3-4 times per day (it’s ~700ml). It’s made skin clearer feel less sluggish crap general. Youre gonna multiple surges. gonna blurred together. Good lord many times need told recent weeks incomplete? fooling anyone bullshit. odd saw number necessarily downplay say ""oh, that's it? pffft"", think ""good that's pretty low"". Seeing comments made realized desensitized deaths I've become living large city seeing multiple times numbers death per day, yet think kin sociopath. would agree saying something like first example someone may say would come sociopath type person, point defense mechanisms preventing lots people registering every death tragedy now. least, would incapacitated grief rest life, even defense mechanisms pace tough function normally. US doomed landed Trumps presidency. fool makes entire country look foolish using power president mislead, deny obstruct implementation policies practices inhibit spread deadly virus. leadership cause situation find in. way, shape form say president blame things bad.

What said was, good president, really think things would gotten truly *good,* even while? Like saw France (which unfortunately second wave), we're seeing China, South Korea, etc.

I know could handled differently. still could, even now. I'm wondering is, make sense rational people say ""oh, better president, we'd fixed United States""?

It's big-ass country. big groups people really, really determined think act way, regardless government tells asks do. surprisingly COMMON take I'm right now. co workers use least day. Trump person ^(it's animal), mindset. Home antigen testing going difference failure not. someone explain ELI5 COVID deadlier Fall/Winter opposed Spring/Summer? Oh okay bad, hopefully I'll able weather astronomical tomato bill 60 days Trusting government make right decision boooold fucking gamble, friend. Czech officials attributed rise sharp increase testing. also insist new cases mild among otherwise healthy young people. 168 cases traced party Prague nightclub July.

The prime minister, Andrej Babiš, told World Health Organization “keep quiet” voiced concern reports Czech officials planned reduce contact tracing testing many new cases asymptomatic.

It's shit everywhere company exactly super critical employees. split groups brought campers told sorry, can’t leave campus. numbers good state aren’t anymore. Sadly country fully embraced 'herd immunity' whether we've called strategy not. I'm pretty sure we're past point return point anyway. ""Too little late"".

The hardest part stomach run full course we're probably looking well million dead Americans. 

Really leaves questioning values... No! kids need Halloween! least that's everyone screaming facebook. know, like can't buy kids fucking candy stay home. Florida? Italy, would've charged homicide earlier year. new cases area months grand total 3 deaths dozen cases total yet somehow still first wave. Yeah ok. Also, think attached wrong comment. Intended reply one yours. :) appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* I'm literally dreams I'm public without mask panicking it.  soon enter store time limit head counting down. line long put stuff back leave. worth it. Mostly never set foot supermarket, prefer local butcher meat international markets produce. spent 100% payroll. However, I'd always reported 1099's that's approved on. 1099's count. forgiveness application, provide proof paying payroll taxes last year, happen. guess pay back? Hunker doesn’t mean stop trying make living people, sheesh 😒. 

I live major city people wear masks. drive mile rich suburbs guess see? Tons rich people wearing masks. also traveling? Rich people. 

Look demographics see dying large proportion, ain’t rich people. Florida? that's America's wang!

They prefer ""The sunshine state."" understand tempting almost inevitable disillusioned current state things, different president could prevented deaths. 

1. could rang alarm bells followed pandemic protocols Obama put together soon first heard virus. far back December 2019. 

2. Trump GOP general pushed division unity last four years. fact something like national health emergency politicized. deserve blame that. Democrats much likely bipartisan republicans. That's proven fact. 

3. still national strategy guidelines. state handling response way. states coordinated mediocre success, imagine states coordinated. 

4. states bidding federal government supplies. Another problem competent administration would avoided. 

5. Kushner Trump's unqualified son-in-law fucked initial response. send aid states Democratic States, also put unqualified people positions fucked important responsibilities. 

6. manufacturing capacity develop enough tests test American semi-regular basis. Trump power force private companies manufacture testing supplies doesn't. 

7. important, attitude matters. That's leadership. times crisis, leaders lead. Even people apathetic Bush rallied around words days following 9/11 attacks. underestimate power eloquent, impassioned speech someone position power. 

There's more, hope see competent leadership could huge impact US. Let alone leader preached unity division last 4 years. depressed to. amount people made political dumb cant talk wearing mask without talking rights selfishness protect people, ""they dont care catch it"" Stop letting media idiots ruin life. Half people know gotten basically symptoms. Theyre pharmacists MDs guess what, we've getting bottle service clubs going oazarks summer. even went Mexico san diego bit last month. 400 pounds diabetes. Stay fuck home. need shut everything save fat fucks cusp dying anyway. whole thing bullshit. Quarantine weak, everyone. Damn, screwing school openings shut whole country. None years listed excess deaths summer. Right gave handed election Trump.  leader, negotiator claims be, would incentivized states bringing Congress together provide funding available followed national recommended guidelines.

Note: would required plan. day, still plan.

So STFU ""this that"" nothing between. many ways lead national response states would gone along. that. STILL that. He's fraud - charlatan. He's deeply incapable leadership unfit. still strong mask mandates, dunno countries.  Good them.

Just know, happening everywhere. Americans (and people general) it. one wants shut life virus 99%+ survival rate. 

With amount people living lives, virus half deadly originally thought, amount dead would skyrocketing. not.

If problem we'd talking many dead are. always, 'Cases skyrocket! cases! many cases!'

But there's dying lost sight issue.

Anyway, enjoy living holes, everyone else back normal. solution isn’t realistic. I’m precautions can’t shut nation entire year.

Easy say “we need cure Covid” I’m one searching cure. mean sense lot public health data people don’t avoid plague, that’s really interesting didn’t know last year.

So experimental perspective good thing WVA showed everyone things wrong it’s shame schools needed run simultaneous trials though. life long food service employee (BOH) want thank putting welfare employees priority. post touched hit close home. know lots restaurant owner who's motivation profit oriented, though blame business look after. care employee truly astounding wish nothing best business ❤❤❤ upvotes real life hugs. oral sex.

Take fucking responsibility. proposed late March still waffling intended trying figure could accept least amount blame; also blurted comment publicly media without consulting Cuomo himself.

You exactly right: leaders lead example communicate robustly others downstream chain-of-command, effective communication bidirectional top-down avoid siloing. basically exhibits every single one worst possible traits leader current era decentralization.

Groupthink, siloing, quashing punishing dissent, utilizing top-down communication structures, reliance meaningless metrics without context gauge progress often doctored public consumption... employing leadership tactics learned sucked Vietnam Iraq early 2000s. say that? Irrelevant.

I know sensationalized media garbage enough already. 250k people died year last year number changes much year year. ask simpletons explain huge discrepancy statistic. pandemic cause? 250k extra people die because.

Back claim otherwise us favor shut fuck already. French living France here:No body since coronatime. seen outside done twice best since March 2020,Please note ""la bise"" bit cliché outside France &amp; mostly men &amp; women: that, common interaction lot women hate strangers.In North Africa least Morocco, kiss cheeks even grown-up men ""my dumb beliefs right everyone else wrong""

Gtfo Yep. too. honesty shocked got 1 check. Western European countries significantly worse Germany moment (France, Spain, UK, extent Belgium Netherlands) ones pandemic never really control number active cases already trending beginning summer, restrictions eased holiday activities (travel, beaches etc.) starting again. 

Of course really answer question countries able bring situation control. especially puzzling Spain fared much worse Italy despite similarly harsh prolonged lockdown measures. also live Taiwan. /u/Porkstew correct: people ""hunker down"" received stipend government. rest us not, well, get anything. Why? government actually effectively dealt pandemic. worries businesses closing.

Meanwhile covid-ravaged countries, worries trying bury dead, fighting tin foils, businesses closing, etc etc Lmao yeah guess took quick peek. face neck look like melting candle Dali clock. happen don’t mind asking? I’m 27 random chest pains always scare specially doctors can’t find anything wrong leaves wondering fuck going on. think meant reply someone speaking wedding. No. honest. Read post.

You end realizing he's asshole someone really want work social life thus honest - meanwhile including work environment like feel power stand to. 

He could person work with. 

It's strange people think understand far understanding. school important. Countries shut parts society \*so that\* keep schools open, without total spread society manageable level.

This say schools closed. closing schools much spread different closing \*all\* schools much spread \*some\* schools. testing incredibly low. Maybe 150,000 200,000 tests done Tokyo. you’re saying vaccines don’t work? haven’t eradicated diseases them?

There 100 vaccines trials dozen phase 3. Well... planes fly Asia West studied long-haulers systematically, I'm sure cause symptoms cure would found. everyone busy fighting pandemic. keep treating poor way see ending well ending really. We've living nothing almost 2 months. Consider criminal anything sort run ing options slowly fuck happening beginning Maybe you’re selfish one trying keep people living lives? Food thought. Well yea would using leg car crash. gonna get car? Fuck science! Doesn’t feel like year. I’m seeing light end tunnel it’s really disheartening. unironically. Useless statement. Wanna stop life ? morons huddle tagline run it, plastering parrot drivel every street corner billboard? US... Age group suseptability doubt part reason. But, purely speculation part, wonder summer (for northern hemisphere) also helped suppress fatalities natural vitamin production, less viral load due better ventilation &amp; greater natural social distancing also contributing factors? Depends, got anything drink? Darwinism always wins. 12 new cases day per 100k control!

You keep stupid things wonder people say stupid? Seems like lotta sacrifices virus 99.5–99.9% chance surviving. actually ""pneumococcal"" vaccine Streptococcus pneumoniae (well 13 23 serotypes anyways)

This pathogen common culprit several types bacterial infection, including bacterial pneumonia. So... Trouble ahead then, right? 

Should expect hospitalization rates South (which mysteriously hit ceiling right seemed overflow imminent, e.g. Houston)... skyrocket anew worse fall, particular directly compared hospitalization rates summer, similar numbers cases? 



And likely complacent, uneducated skeptical public doubt risk right dangerous? It’s pretty popular excuse, idea someones meanness justified due “honesty” it’s usually passive aggressive jab. 

That said give honest meanness fraudulent smiles day. ever see someone doesnt want smile trying smile? creepy. &amp; Knuckles Still feel weird think clothes okay mask lol German here. what?? Hugging, yes, time. Kissing th cheek: Nope, cannot remember ever seeing that...

Everyone serving customers operating restaurants right blood hands. Anyone decent intelligence tell SARS transmit We’re doomed 37 million people, 22k cases?

Seems low. could ripped band-aid true 90 day lock down. Instead bandaid perpetually slowly pulled - over.

Orwell definitely underestimate power *educated* poor. sure downvoted.

As understood, deaths lag cases 18 days so.

This parent comment strikes soft propaganda, instead actual query. UK basically two ways reporting deaths, daily count public health agencies delayed count statistics office.

The daily count reporting death basically cross checked list people tested positive COVID died. changed (including retrospectively) 28 day cut testing positive dying.

The one looks states death certificates higher daily count. still excess deaths though. article:

As example, I'm part one used sign ups open local teachers, students, family current members...now open whoever. u seriously think Fauci fortunate u? Imagine work load responsibility whole pandemic US. might well single alone.

I dont understand Americans. Almost everybody else world facing much tougher lockdown. Americans whine most. Excuse me? paying taxes entire adult life money meant benefit everyone paid multi billion dollar corporations pay little taxes yet received majority covid relief funds.  People trying survive becoming increasingly difficult due corrupt control federal government. Also depends school. know someone teaches private school, paid well technically gets summers off. really 3 4 weeks rest left preparing next year. Teaching hard work especially strive fun great teacher. Everyone already knew Sweden fucked Yes, cheek two pooper.  Unfortunately inevitable :c science background work science. posted information supporting contention consensus science lockdowns. Nothing garbage that.

Even epidemiologic consensus, social ethical harms strategy make non-starter many us. something argued numbers, boils human values.

Which fork road here. can’t make agree lockdowns human horror show, can’t make agree aren’t. one physician follow social media put it, different moral tastebuds. mean... least know epo shit like good rona... That’s different trial started enrolling pause. 17k prior trials 8500 vaccinated. says statement posted above. rubbed one out. Test &amp; Trace basically. cases quickly found, isolated traced moment. Cases increase, dangerous level moment. agree play devil’s advocate smug attitude - learn cook. make 90% make restaurants taste good, barring specialized equipment like pizza ovens (stir fry doesn’t need real high heat). Talk lazy entitled takeout. Better fake sense community protection actual real help. Makes sense. flu different virus every year. infects 10M 50M people US per year, kills 10,000 60,000 people.

Do think lock like every year prevent flu deaths? not, difference fatality rate (Covid 6x deadlier flu per infection basis), infectiousness (you'd expect 20% 60% population infected compared maybe 15% bad flu season), something else?

I'm assuming reasoning ""COVID-19 likely kill 10x many people moderately bad flu season"", draw line? 5x deadlier bad flu season? 2x deadlier? Every time get bad flu strain, decade so?

Or impression flu basically bad cold big deal?  U buy lot hand sanitizers case u need booze Daayeg? Yank dala gothijji maraya. I’ve also seen fit healthy people become obese sports injuries

Replace obese addicted painkillers sentence sounds   angered airport. entire place dine-in restaurants. Yes understand placebo mate. 5,000 appears (it's 2:1, 1:1). 17,000, twice many likely received vaccine vs. placebo (saline). 10,000 already vaccine likely (assuming similar protocols US trials). Phase I/II also 1,000 people it, 2/3rds got forget high median age low testing rates. 

But science based approach messaging top notch (focusing indoor spread three Cs said, even back March UK recommending handwashing despite non-existent fomite spread discouraging masks)  Butt guns. we’ve going us. Kanye devastated people try large family gatherings many die.

This needs suppressed costs. usually touch outside elbow face. Anyone dying bad american apathy killing nation  feel bad...should stop seeing therapist? beg differ. It’s going much easier hunker down, weather miserable outside. Yes, think reasonable avoid taking risks. point live country rigorous virus management plan, certainly free take extra precautions *you can't criticise others taking precautions*. follow official regulations letter accept people telling I'm wrong go out/travel/eat etc activities allowed. 

This fundamental difference place like US (and lesser extent Sweden Netherlands) onus individual citizens decide behave. national leader could create policy guide coronavirus strategy... Jeff Goldblum Independence Day Someone tell Fauci total deaths causes recent weeks 3.9-7.7 percent average time year, almost 12,000 per week fewer peak 2017-2018 flu season, declining week week even things continue go back normal. I'm therapist, work role emotionally demanding people expect clear answers. hard know expected provide emotional support world events simultaneously experiencing yourself. ITT: Easy work home supposed work hunker down

What took saying full-on self quarantine (I mean, can). like, stay home weekends work stuff. stay home much possible. So, leave house work, leave house grocery store...and thats it. So, go restaurants, dont go gym, dont go visit friends/family, go events, dont go trick treating, dont Thanksgiving dinner, dont go Christmas/New Years parties, go fucking protests... Americans socially distance quite well compared countries urban centers wear masks pretty much Europe par japan. cell phone data, imaging polling Maybe taxes? work 35 hours week. company opted tax deferral anyway. Given fact first thing posting ad hominem comment assume meaningful contribution therefore point view safely ignored. Spot-on correct. experience watching personal close friend family member die alone hospital this, or, hell, even fight tooth nail lives weeks ICU, remains abstract numbers game. successful enough flattening curve that, far many people, entire concept COVID-19 seems foreign them. happen *me* \+ everyone *I* know mild case = obviously hoax.

No.... don't.
Can't wait next pandemic come factory farms. Oh boy I'll pass prison colony /s clear concerned soapbox actually solving problems, good luck anti-vaccine website disguised scientific one. Read caution. better yet, find different source. cases rising matter anymore lots countries testing like HELL now. ""cases rising"" matter much before. people dying cases matters, far..the death rate overall global level gone up. actually gone down. actually good news. cases rising deaths actually GOOD episode realer Irrsinn school? saw similar story I've worked 13 years construction put mask 10 hours per day working furnace room. There's reason small tissue mask causing issues except childish caricature men. Stop bitchin kiddo Actually, people use masks, save feel bit ill anxious it. vast majority not. know, wanted wedding, moved hopes maybe able 50, looks case, it’s wanted keep July wedding date coincided first started dating. don’t want court house wedding, I’m traditionalist ways like actual wedding. also find weddings lot fun overall. Who's predictions?

Large spikes infections 1 month

I admire Fauci's Canute-like attempts. Different countries count Covid deaths different ways. look excess death per capita instead Covid death counts, US ranks much lower. least kids mostly honest lol People follow guidelines though.  Mississippi disaster zone. They're currently 87.89 deaths per 100k population, ranks 8th country per capita deaths.

Here's latest case/death news cases deaths trending down. Still better India. India never seen decline virus since start pandemic Why? probably could better.  Trump personally politicized wearing masks alone exacerbated situation.  Executive orders could signed get tests PPE hospitals. 

But, yeah, probably going always bad country size US. bad though. can't find credit union, try looking small local banks. work one two branches. screw customers first time life feel like I'm screwed employee. things hear banking working big banks make blood run cold. Banks business like other. give money Wells Fargo. Support little guy. even paint. made want learn paint, truthfully, there's better time start now. Obviously going happen since Govt taking half measures re-opening events/businesses/schools. national lockdown get us first surge, fuck anyone think sending advice ""hunker down"" going do? goes back leadership obviously good job getting us it. People forced back work unemployment benefits ending/lessening one measly paycheck $1200 6 months shit.

Fauci depressed, goes back government leadership. believe discrepancy reporting, Germany reporting people died pneumonia/cancer/etc whilst covid died covid, whilst UK reported COVID deaths.

Can shit finally die already? lie Italian media came with. RKI always said follow guidelines, excess deaths supporting numbers. far, less people died 2020 period 2019. Even height pandemic, mortality actually down. fuck right wing conspiracy theories. Winter coming. Enesta Jones, spokeswoman agency, said understanding links air pollution COVID-19 “complicated process take many years.”

COVID-19 elicits NF-kB driven cellular immune response. response causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced, order kill intracellular pathogens. destructive ROS hydroxyl radical (OH).

NF-kB activation, causing ROS production, often occurs absence infection, due many genetic environmental factors. becomes chronic, cells damaged ultimately killed, leading various non-communicable diseases.

Chronic, aberrant NF-kB activation initiated factors mimic downstream effects NF-kB driven immune response, ROS production.

A great many chemical pollutants enter cells bind cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor, migrates nuclear membrane, chemicals metabolized iron dependent cytochrome P450 enzymes. causes OH produced, activates NF-kB. 

People living high pollution areas therefore high degree preexisting NF-kB activation, cellular damage, additional stress cause NF-kB activation due infection intracellular pathogens, SARS viruses, likely cause severe illness. anybody know Bolivian orchestra stuck Germany grounds haunted castle wolves woods ever made home? I’m assuming must really wanna read update can’t find past original reports end May. google- fu failed :/  Spreading virus kill people.

So who's stopping living lives?

Oh, mean people can't party couple months. mean people freaking die. I'm remote learning right now. weeks I'm done school, difficult. think definitely harming children's learning among things, probably necessary. Regardless early studies, seems like easy vector virus spread. I’m sure u live, you’re western world u great purchasing power. Electronics, clothes, everything dirt cheap. sure schools bit emphasis fresh air ventilation Germany due immortal fear Schimmel (mould.) rental contract 4 page part properly vent house, long, at. Daily ventilation encouraged pretty normal even winter (not day course enough refresh air.) live southwest, summers hot long winter cold. restaurants cafes big doors windows open even sometimes removed flipped shop front fully open. sure happens winter hate cold fortify (regularly aired) flat. AC thing despite regularly getting hot places. Good design, outside shutters ventilation keeps bearable despicable piece shit proving pro-lockdowners used coronavirus excuse abuse people. elementary school Florida challenger. went outside watch go up. Cue confused kids sobbing teachers. not. stop saying stuff like please. germany good, efficiently set system states govern still collectively listen come together need be. like U.S mentality ""i w/e fuck want""

there still collective ""country"" feeling. internet full absolutism. sad ppl worse equally sad different degrees Civil society means taking care other. means looking ""weak"". get ""sacrificing few"". got improving living conditions everyone. society ability take care everyone. resources technology make happen. Selfishness greed reason anyone goes without world always increase Wednesday / Thursday / Friday, probably due weekend backlog. go weekend. look overall trend, still decreasing since peak July. Every restaurant around packed like nothing happened. Even Bob Evan’s packed full retirees. interesting news interested talking much death been, rather much currently happening.

Total death causes recent weeks 3.9-7.7 percent average time year, almost 12,000 per week fewer peak 2017-2018 flu words, he's Fuking POS liar...great thanks! Thank you!!! areas hit hard early see exactly situation Sweden.

A lot worse, stop virus. simply slow down. point lockdowns manage hospitalization, somehow people measuring success eradication effort. never purpose.

We discussing claim US halfway point. 

Besides, I'm actually middle really strong lockdown, Melbourne, Australia. 6 weeks, reduced daily rate new cases tenfold. aim get point new cases contact traced, far, we're track so. really harsh, works. sterilization part would bonus me. bad zombie effects? already feel like I've zombie year... admitted to. truth could far uglier. Biden shit shit. 

Note: fuck Trump El Paso improving overall however. Here's latest case/death charts, running 7-day way down. Deaths noisy also trending down.

Overall county 55.57 deaths per 100k population. That's slightly US per capita average. good audio quality. Unlike options there, crapify studio-grade microphones.
 bit hard use IMO, ***THE*** communicator power users. forget however China Communist country controls information, Communist countries do. know know, I’m trying say issue worse ppl lost jobs, gotten covid19, ppl lost loved ones covid. I’m sad that’s all, feel allowed sad situation also even sad ppl worse position I. need ask Canadians aka free folk help us Businesses reopened, dead can't brought back life. well, want zombies procreate, would you? Hey look, another fat teacher dies coronavirus may may contracted coronavirus school Thats fine it. think country even come remotely able run act like you. need open mind bit try understand people need society. got lucky good path saved 400k 30. Society even run people that's dont berate others act like elbow grease. America run country people took path. involves college extreme amount frugality period time. invested tho live paycheck paycheck spending cash still saving average middle class american. reddit? years ago would thought great many actions would made impossible candidate. However know enough fellow citizens realize third us going vote *no matter recorded saying.* think nobody getting tested Germany? realise dumb sounds? interaction different different social groups. close family would use WhatsApp chat calls. friends seen 10-30 years I'm really going call them. We've got families living lives cool see families to. passive news feed perfect that.  fact kiss cheek pretty often I'd imagine that's slowed now.

What? pretty much know anybody that. I've lived country. Maybe seen families get together since july pubs opened 🙃 schools opened kaboom. normal conditions kids bringing sort infections school even worse. Covid 19 85% likely 85% topics conversation omg totally flu that's really truth time now, worse average flu. That's it. Plain simple. corona  I'm planning going back sheltering October onwards anyway dumb positive attitude real danger. People choose. covid something people pick choose read
Its dumb that. 2 surveys. One direct, one Facebook. better source mild case long term follow up, please share it. risk Applebee’s. stopped worrying Ebola outbreak Zika outbreak Yep, absolutely correct  Well...I'm going get Constitutional law argument here, suffice say agree interpretation. beyond that, can't say ""the goalposts keep moving"" never actually achieved original goal first place. Google mobility data showed reduction US around 55% high-end, whereas Italy, Spain, France, etc. 85-90% range. half-ass first step, can't complain six months later nothing gotten better. quote mean think means.

More context global pandemic known corrective actions.

Rather, smart thing punish seeking lie, abuse, otherwise co-opt moment personal gain. white holder pretty real bud cancel flight partially?  Praise Nurgle \\o/  guess took precautionary action then. everyone US north wall too... So, there's that... I'm certain agree. History laden examples US bullying countries policy decisions based dependence vulnerability. admit...as someone lives New York State facing 1,000 day peak, also first reaction. fucked got bad 22 deaths feels like nothing us. That's sad whole thing is. need work reading comprehension. specifically said hates people like poster, listed reasons even though op comment said nothing social lives, regular human contact could literally mean room another human. 

He mis-interpreted comment, opinion mean context. kind dick say ""hates"" people like poster info. Gotcha buddy, case study used prove disprove idea. Indian model would disprove UBI viable way structure society.
But name calling. Kinda typical really. care much make, saying loan needs paid back, reason needs paid back circumventing system work taking advantage people. Original comment: ""We're fucked we?""

One many ways we're fucked: Climate change

Nice attempt invalidating reddit comment, though, suppose? matters. Fauci said, ""Don't try look rosy side things."" means little donnie trump's way. Jim McDonald's spending 7 hours day people, though. Sustained contact (according city's Department Public Health, that's 15 minutes CUMULATIVE) dangerous brief interactions. That's library check books someone, spending 20 minutes helping computer allowed. Elementary school teachers spend 7 hours day 30 kids small room, often much closer contact typical retail food service worker. Neither option good, one clearly dangerous. reason stock market time high Fed propping low interest rates quantitative easing. shit overblown hilarious. want get mad, get mad Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, etc, seen net worths almost double time, small businesses tanked. Remember senators knew destruction would cause massive selloff stocks stock market tanked? one goes real enemy, shit distraction. another way poor / middle class evaporated rich continue accumulate wealth. Yup. I’m Portland air quality rated mid 400s right now. I’m scared even let dog outside. almost like he's referring entire country small town? Imagine triggered misunderstanding something elementary. Panic opposite. Sooner later people look around see isnt deadly resume life really stupid, think saw happened toilet paper made quick decision wound bad. Regardless, six months ago guidance improved much. said, there's excuse anyone anywhere public without mask on. pure selfishness stupidity. would mandating masks affect rural people unreasonably versus urban area populations? still vote vote might carry power yours. Absolutely - that's I've trying tell everyone listen.

It sucks leadership/messaging country fractured. seemed everyone life totally convinced we'd lock it'd over, keep correcting them.

Like said, we're done get herd immunity via vaccine, could take considering much cluster government response virus far. good'ol hockey enforcer.

I dont like treating 19 year old star rookie, take fist sandwich live Texas actually gets cold winter. Way colder ever lived coastal California. hope fucking kidding. Jesus נו פרובלם, חביבי! This, plus pay people consistently stay home, like every successful country did. way people survive, feel pressured put harms way, money spend come economy tank. everything wrong, furious day die. could anytime thanks GOP.

Edit: spelling way lol, think people underestimate amount people swayed bill gates 5G conspiracy theories Seesawing pretty fucking terrible idea. virus take 14 days show symptoms show lot people area blatantly lot restrictions. hospital starts filling means bunch people hospital already passed along there's ton infected people showing symptoms yet. like ant problem time see ant theres whole nest. area lot people dont care. mandated wear masks, lot wont it. numbers going up, people less careful   Neither vaccines funded Gates, dumbshit. sane person whole administration that's opinion? Lol, let guess... agree. wish could recall her, can’t Iowa law. able recall someone whose actually competent keep us safe. Lol. know you’re trouble internet dimwit calls new account 😂 

Anything else add? hand, could made sure would win handling pandemic better. Give people money, shutdown economy drum success story elections come closer. would 100% guaranteed success. 

But no, fuck up, lose (probably) long term short term gains (stock market). could easy.

Trudeau thinking calling election Canada. know what? may even get majority wants, since handled pandemic decently. Doug Ford Ontario, completely despicable person, incompetent corrupt, yet handled pandemic admirably (less schools, fucking hates education), get called polls again, may get second term.

And nothing. delegated listened experts. Easiest job fucking world. Ding ding ding. No, government protect individual rights. government nanny. Maybe legal punch non-mask wearers face would start understand the...impact thing flattening curve never going anything keep hospitalizations point healthcare system could handle them. Implementing system like talking would required strict, nationwide lockdown many weeks (which for) get cases maybe 1,000 day less. would given us chance testing contact tracing. 

But said, fuck done. U.S. NEVER really good plan, even best plans fail actually implement them. cafés open government's fault, fault.

Why pointing fingers whose fault important safety?

And btw, ALSO fault anyway, something unnecessarily dangerous. Wow France failing keeping cases now? HI SUNSHINE! 🌞 exactly mean? Obviously they're going Spain Italy Latin American countries, different really? here. haven’t gotten depressed yet say fuck die die... definitely days feels like easier answer.

I think I’m finally resigned, fatalistic portion grieving world used know... say election using reference date? Spoiler alert, will. interested studies said done explain waves virus spaced more. agree, Bars restaurants shut down, taking incomes thousands, another shutdown would destroy remaining small businesses big box corporate stores remain. see impacts virus people visiting mental health? 6 months since many saw families doubt suicides increase progress deeper hopeless situation. Im saying drop restrictions open surely middle ground least give people semblance life worth living. dont think 'new reality last long rampant shutdowns businesses, New Yorks restaurant scene even hotels screwed. cant open straight after. Sooner later people weigh risks living life vs living misery. idiocy gets upvotes, crazy world live Gates funded vaccine Coronavirus vaccine, really going trust it? Except there's pretty much way lose... hell Biden getting state even likely imo, knowing America   Exactly. People keep forgetting Trump large swaths right-leaning independents disliked GOP thought Trump guy would change things DC, consequently voted large groups Clinton. Trump nearly commanding lead group Biden, mostly he's longer untested outsider may bring change Washington. independents see Trump another politician trying get power like feared Clinton was. Yeah, we've loosened outdoor hesitations, still indoors.

I bought projector outdoor movie nights/bonfires friends hope make use soon, Winter going tough. much oof... make stop. Oh apologies, realize referring election...you're right -- Biden wins, they're riots. Trump wins, they're probably riots Excellent. need young people(0% death rate) get virus order build herd immunity. HELLO SUNSHINE! 🌞  clarify, time limit Covid infects certain amount time inside store? you’re fine you’re store 10 minutes, 10 minutes you’ll catch Covid? similar symptoms also fever. How’d test go? States make rules govern fed.

Your comment ignorant ""mask protestors"". like children want follow bedtime ""good night's rest"" means nothing ignorant little child.  uncivil obscene gets people banned forum. afo shirutim? Sheli ivrit lo tov beseder. There's lot states. handle equally. issue stay home much later. Enforcement awful. president's power limited, tough convince large portion population stay home president spitting bullshit Twitter whole time. nothing saying right things would gone long way. Yes, understand malfeasance. Kushner aidded abetted killing Americans.

America two sides: seek death suffering Americans seek defend American lives. nothing COVID-19. Stop spamming crap. idiots think him

There seem quite them, unfortunately. fucking terrible, sometimes wish virus deadly people would take seriously. Maybe could done now. need Quint ever...and fair Spanish ladies. forget government help people. American government won’t help us who’s power. lockdown step one step two never came Yeah, agree completely.

Can imagine reaction country would something blew city 200,000 people? 9/11 changed fabric country, something like would shred it.

Meanwhile, we're nearing 200k deaths people searching reasons believe despite evidence have, protesting bare minimum protections.

Honestly, I've got little hope us getting better country. We're broken hell. Happy early birthday Checkmate entirely support Trump Republicanism become cult dear leader told hoax. Trumps politicization entirely 100% reason we're right now.   anyone still listen person says?

Seriously. Go away already Fauci; one cares. Imo he's got literal free win good shot red map Oh yes, flu season + coronavirus. even Jesus want resurrect grave dumbasses around time around. China even 5K dead started whole mess. shows government gave zero fucks. yet fact remains would exposed dozens school. Good fucking job completely missing point. remember Labor Day may go  Well, college kids party. I’m stunned. would’ve thought would irresponsible. 🤔 LA County Health Director spilled beans got caught tape saying schools would reopen ""after election."" many supposed virus measures zero virus everything getting people vote certain way.

cool conspiracy theory, bro I'm back check in... Kinda happens let virus become endemic 6 months crisis try tell people kids immune known since month 2

Trump: Young people get (in March)

Also Trump: Kids know basically immune (in August) someone could interview tell authorities! I'm aware, graduated rival school. People would (and still do) wear shirts around campus say Muck Fiami Plus, viral load important. Getting drunk lowers immune system doubt outside whole night. Maybe even smoked? things make worse. Continually spewing virus eachother without masks would make objectively worse. kind heavy-handed Federal supremacy exactly mask protestors resisting. He's dishonest doctor. I'm sick hearing people praise him. letter laminated stapled tree outside. piss every then.   Im going grain here, American's large cities seem grasp concept rural America completely different day day life is. country completely different culture, living standards, etc. NYC handling differently small county Midwest.

I live Michigan, Whitmer getting sued left right for, saying, overstepping executive boundaries. federal leadership call shots NYC well town 500 people seems somewhat illogical me. 

To add this, executive branch absolutely implemented strategies- argue disagree strategies, strategies strict enough. Can't second surge never leave first.

Had wife died, likely would've attributed pneumonia sort organ failure, perhaps flu run actual test, went based symptoms. Even died back town saw doctor, doctor connected way, I'm sure would've anything listed symptoms cause death.

There test COVID back rationalize testimony USA death curves?

The COVID death count line excess death count, leading many believe deaths COVID official counts suggest. flu far weaker less widespread thought end 2019, assumed died actually COVID disease?

Again, ***I want emphasize, think highly unlikely COVID around back October***, maybe something else was. unlikely COVID around back then, unlikely two us genetic relationship, got flu shot, always gotten flu shot, tested negative flu, got sick symptoms mirrored COVID, severely impacted it. Normally get flu shot, even get flu, symptoms much less question this: New York deaths spike April everyone getting across world Oct-Feb?

I know. NY spike April everyone getting across world Dec-Feb? right... really sad often redditors ignorant judge post merits resort character attacks. anyone real intelligence understand, true value comment rests upon properly executing strategic placement crying laughter emojis, art science thereof unmistakable signature someone whose opinion taste nuance, backed cold, hard facts reason. possible unconstitutional so.

Doesn’t surprise guy thinks Sweden good job.  Bars city (45 minutes south Tampa) many others found loophole serve food open quite weeks ago. Winter coming!  Holy crap, they're finally going admit it? CDC finally going get serious controlling spread? close restaurant dining rooms now?

The reality activity requires one remove masks outside home strictly prohibited, especially applies bars/restaurants. curbside takeout delivery since March. many jobs businesses food/drink service industry, apparently important keep revenue operations open. Remembered sex ed funny guy Whoopdie frickin'  terrible example, dividend paid Alaskans averages like $1200/year, quite enough $$$ make good case study opinion.

Looks like know I’ll going winter break post inaccurately cited vaccine development timelines compared Oxford scientists developing vaccines trump taxes meant encourage healthy skepticism, sincerely apologize.

AND GET FLU SHOTS SEASON. But, dance? warning months. November+ virus harder contain.   Kristi Noem sociopath, JFC must poor leadership failing control virus!  isolate 5 months I'll end blowing brains out. Sorry truth hurts Yea show corona. Forget death rate; think permanent injuries survivors. 

Yeah may live, worse - year social contact lifelong heart lung condition (which starting see supposedly “recovered” patients?)

I faulty electrical circuit heart, trust - revived emergency room fun. Neither youngest person waiting room cardiologist’s office wearing 4-lead monitor month afterwards. Maybe people hate solutions actual solutions?

Insulation thousands dollars, plus place able things like insulate. 

Indoor veggie gardens take lots money supplies - US also require artificial grow lights winter angle sun (expensive buy use).

25lbs dried beans won’t last family even month.

Space heaters WAY less efficient heating still need heat entire house enough pipes won’t freeze. Also, solution people stay inside time it’s literally freezing indoors (except one expensive poorly heated room).

Maybe solutions aren’t thing. Authoritarianism rules! crowd claims ""anti-fascist"" sure cheering good old fashioned fascism now. Daddy government, please force everyone stay home! Yeah, thing scary traveling part.... see happens point. we're disappeared? winter bad recovery. Hang there. it. think drastically underestimate desire return normalcy. see. church kid ""open air"" services. like drive-in church. Everyone parked stayed car. dad sister loved mom seem care listened.

So point, say let em. woman take it? Men much luck. read article again. retroactive test traced case November. mean knew Better tracing program. cold October-November deep cough told bronchitis. sometimes think job required meet vendors Asia. However, one around ever got sick like did, sure!  Deaths rise soon. Nowhere near much first wave, ~100 per day definitely possible. Unless offering free food drinks see assume allowing open = packed. Brb making fishnet masks $30 It’s already happening Morocco. Fuck university students, spreading without blinking! 8% actually, domestic tourism heavily promoted. think would trade 100 times number deaths like Sweden has? Use brain. Que wave number 3 None us going live forever. people getting permanent mental health damage social isolation. ideal everyone emotional/mental capacity stay home another year. designed live like this.  Sacrebleu!

That's spots really. that, small time parks, golf courses local events like Christian music festivals whole lot cold winter them. Thats plan. Next week get paycheck we're going make couple appointments decide new bank. Get local credit union. Wells Fargo trash anyways. Many local banks don’t fees. won’t many bank-specific ATMs, many branch locations, it’s worth it. MUCH better customer service, also 1-800 number putting hold 45+ minutes speak someone immediately put back hold another half hour. real risks closing schools, real risks opening schools. We're faced terrible choices. I’m 100% this. mental health come first now. word wrong since I'm shitty android n texting quick. meant since workers getting unemployment anymore (the 800 week) us workers forced back work n assclown politicians tells us ""hibernate"" fuck happen work pay Bill's Early 90s...  Yeah see going. Looking Amazon full-body contamination-prevention suits now. wanna beat rush. earth read taiwan giving $30 day people hunker lmao. vouchers handed 120usd.

Things okay wasn’t lockdown everything stayed open normal hours. lost work Find local credit union. universities (e.g. Indiana University CU), unions employers (Washington State Employees CU, Partners Federal CU / Disney). 

Rates usually better tend kill fees. least find local/regional bank. nothing Wells Fargo give Truist Keybank can't. False, take eating outside allowed. don’t understand indoor restaurants haven’t bought tents clear parking spaces place tables chairs outside tents free breeze parking lot.

But yes, indoor anything without mask allowed! Problem need health care workers go work. need public transport personnel cities car mechanics suburbs. need police fire go work. least city maintenance - can’t leave trash 2+ weeks. Someone feed health care workers make sure grocery stores stocked lockdown ends. means farmers support, truck drivers transport goods. Gas station attendants, truck stop employees, etc. cafeteria workers hospitals. Janitorial staff, etc etc

In words, HARD lockdown reddit really wants terribly difficult unless you’re willing people die hospitals anarchy people emerge empty grocery stores. People kill prophets. No. It’s people another subreddit found comments. coronavirus subreddit filled people obsessed doom shaming people. love blame everyone what’s going world zero empathy. moms husband died january bugs go restaurant like twice week. caved went twice, one time inside. time ate inside people felt like jackass. ate outside people, everyone 50. stopped really caring saving elders honestly, care least. 5-6 months strict isolation start seeing friends fault cases rising, edna bob mary literally done anything differently apart complain masks. Yyeeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh! call are: Traitors America. grandma ‘pneumonia’ January-ish. point I’m pretty much covid, makes much sense. percent people, regardless party, also believe wearing mask harmful health, Start now, don’t wait. Stalin said? vote hold power, count vote hold power? something along lines friends Sweden, confirm. Life pretty much back normal there. everyone laughed him

Maybe reddit, real world. real world people grateful actually flopping it. delusional talk lost 2016. isn’t claim. CDC’s data. say site “Provisional death counts weighted account incomplete data.” sure, don’t want check yourself, take CDC’s word it. Although recommend following get feel it. failed mr fauci im sorry think like that, becomes reality. must walk line continue support idea voting. else kind destroy it. small study included indoor outdoor dining, didn’t distinguish two. seem likely indoor dining problematic, maskless outdoor dining poor air circulation might great either. Bro politics sub automod delete post need adjust population...

There's technology medical advancements we've made since likely prevent hundreds people would died Covid 1918 dying today.

There's testing tracking capabilities get better measure numbers actually dealing also back then.

There's dozens factors consider.

I merely making statement kills 650k, deaths Pandemic US history. President could put fucking mask lead. One nice thing treatment get approved ""dire"" cases much easily. vaccine basically perfect released. sped save lives people severe cases. That’s necessarily true, used properly studies show sanitizer effective. It’s even point micro lab worked couple years back, professor charge banned sanitizer 20 years believed wasn’t effective, convinced change stance readily hand. one gives fuck they're blatently spreading communist propaganda lmao Thats well articulated way pretty clearly censorship. severely obese. perhaps news casters would listed likely many health ailments interested reporting truth vs. painting picture Covid discriminate...when clearly does.

95%+ people dying covid country 70+. comorbidity studies shown rare covid issue people facing.

Old sick people dying unfortunate, fact life. can't pause 7B lives fanatics reduce morbidity rate negligible zero. Can’t second wave first wave never ends

#Galaxy Brain Complete idiots Yes, you, attention. God, sad must childhood been? carries pathetic life. feel that! extra $600 life saver. helped pay health insurance pocket, supplement boyfriends lost hours work. Thankfully saved little bit cushion bills even though get per week you, make slightly less owe every month...before groceries! waiting final word job (which want leave) gamble boyfriends health new one (technically high risk covid complications, moreso)

What disaster. hope find something good time comes. Country* US exposed loose cooperation 50 countries similar EU. Youre right, advantages time around base dug in...i dont want it, would bet money get another 4 years Trump... Stay fuck inside. Unless gotta go like work something, shouldnt problem. I'm sorry isnt fun anymore dont get sick following rules putting others danger. fantastic! Dawg, cynical, depressing outlook life. Take deep breaths.

Its gets better. fair americans wouldnt listen task force anyway

people pig headed stupid. look around. over. people literally garbage humans purpose NY follow. Hopefully ""astronomical""

yeah admit tax cuts political hit job? nothing improving economy? late January napkin math told mom we'd 200,000 dead Americans end year favorable scenario.

We've almost already passed that. can't people panicking now...  Italy, Britain deaths per million USA Sweden. Look numbers. “united states” oxymoron none states unite right thing system failing understood, us. Mask wearing SARS new problems. never spread west this. get angry. much precedent mask use effectiveness stopping respiratory viruses. friends Vietnam India basically parents telling wear masks make cloth back early February. understand logic let's wear masks N95s available. way protect making dent exponential process, especially early on. like starving person saying eat food prepared master chef. Makes sense.  Fauci given death penalty handling pandemic better. much misinformation mouth year decades prepare this. people wear masks said first need to. poor stop enjoying benefits wealthy society much do. poor willing give electricity, running water, easily accessible food, medicine, physical safety. None y'all willing actually really good. convinced bad keep comparing even richer people. Spain, France UK show second wave infections coming, low quite time. 

People get complacent starts going outside, ignoring dangers. Fauci yoyo. 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot!  Like NJ? They've good response right? Last saw, Desantis approval rating 47% 

This voted approve tri-state area

I’m still looking right guess forgot ban one. Add growing list censored media sub.

Like it’s right there. least movies 2.5hrs. live horrible mess real time. Oh meant US population 330 million. global population 7.5 billion B telling. really dense?

If something starts 10, goes 8, 7, happening?

Decline! Sure, twenty hundred, *one*? we're discarding crumbs we're giving every crackpot equal importance majority. mean like 50% america obese 

Although i've seen pics doctors died china, pretty skinny that's way making strawman arguments!

The time limit limit potential exposure. risk mitigation, magic rule.

That said, wonder cutting losses short worth it. fail buy need, essentially wasted exposure time shop redo shopping future. Spending 20 minutes shopping one 'sitting' necessarily worse spending 2x10 minutes quick succession. Pacing probably crucial here.

And yes, severity scales viral load. viral particles inhale, risk are. excess deaths also within couple percent. However isn’t fair comparison since flu season every year, lot flu deaths built baseline average measuring against. knew disneyland opened lol

apparently good time decency Thats thinking Texas experienced surge June. Deaths eventually increase month later. Mortality rates still much lower before, deaths eventually start increasing Nah, accepts global warming real state water 10 years figures kills half population state bad. Thankfully, like fascist state one person power. prevented second wave stopping first. saying don’t actually pay back money, instead pay back roundabout way future spending? Meaning government gave Person 15k, aren’t expected pay 15k back, instead 15k keeps alive keep spending rest life? 


That’s talking about. banks automakers paid money back paid back future spending. That’s government bails businesses, it’s better investment. hypothetical isn’t good it’s it’s done.  
Link full poll That's result pretty much every state sets hard deadlines lockdown release starts opening everything virus eradicated.

Also help many states like ""We it!"" ramp testing tracing, absolutely necessary keep everything control. can't second surge everyone dies first get play Fauci inevitable Covid movie? guys fucked state bad fact fleeing states upsetting people live underrated comment see light day. think post history hidden?

It’s not. well guess epidemiologists tell us months. Idk man... 25k? NY alone 32k deaths went full lock down. Nothing anyone could done differently would caused NY mass infection States care knocking thing need rent giant video billboard trucks see outside conventions. Drive around big cities looping images people hooked ventilators ICUs Covid. putting images effects smoking works cigarette packages foreign countries, maybe reality images people hospitals Covid would scare people. No, tried lock new York, federal lockdown. scientist knowingly misleads nation goes along whatever current trendy thing say balancing saving skin. movie good side. comment responded removed mods rural citizens go restaurants, bars churches? gather indoors ever? Get grip, homie. Time leave basement find girl. something right doesn’t mean it’s necessarily smart. fully support message protestors, time protesting primarily 2 deaths we’re looking 200k dead pandemic scientists pleading people follow guidelines seems like misplaced priorities. Fake News Yeah, got Life stranger fiction sometimes Speaking paramedics major midwestern city, informed confirmed cover pt since july. Ok.  lock basement rest life.  I'm stopping you. It’s private platform though. one use Facebook. someone doesn’t like regulations private company made social media, find new platform. People honestly expect company bend change demands reason so. People need use common sense. Right best looking vaccine Pfizer. Paul giamatti San Andreas Ya man, I'm fucked.

I get seasonal depression pretty bad, shit semi-normal days get really short, I'm sure that's gonna work. Miami Ohio confused told us wear masks. remember, articles read make clear why. don’t think happy anymore. sanity. Expecting people “ hunker “ almost year end sight inhumane insane. *shrug* meat factories. lot industries think required could survive without weeks.

That said, lost shit power week I'm big whiner, I'm really best leader Team Sacrifice. theory possible. problem even state others people still travel back forth. need nation lying us whole time ""not airborne"" then. probably dont want freak people Depending media you’re tuning into, reporting COVID optimistic minimizing virus along 😣 eradicated diseases them?

We have, took 37 years vaccine introduction eradication measles, think.

We eradicated anything 2-5 year timeframe restrictions keep hearing talking about. coronavirus anyone assist you, get tested social distancing.

I saw someone online counties begging assistance got tested positive work 3 weeks. one bring groceries, making money embarrassed asking community help her.

If forced quarantine, state providing people supplies make quarantine go outside. Wow need Africans accept medication countries aren’t racist Europe sure America out. kids cages acceptable? Since Remdesivir reached shores LAST WEEK death dropped 4-6 day 1 every couple days. Iowa schools forced Republican sycophant Kim Reynolds least 50% class learning w/o ppe social distancing mandate. classroom cannot accommodate social distancing bad you. Des Moines school district ignored suing state. BTW Iowa top infections per capita.

WINNING! (not) rich get richer poor get poorer. least austria seeing rises tracing infections showed almost 70% brought virus back holiday balkans (croatia, serbia, bosnia...) back August. Partly holiday visiting relatives there.

Now schools opened (summer break ended week) infections probably go up. Schools already preparing home schooling better structured last time April. didn't. Case case basis city. Yes. icu beds open though dont see problem. Many hospitals working normal workload feed trolls little buddy, everyone knows that! Aldo where. Ain't needle getting close balls. 200k one estimates last day lockdown. 4 hour delay fetching comments.

Why would though? become goal, anyways? even without virus going around, never ""complete safety"". want wear mask? Fine! make 10 transactions month? also Wells Fargo that’s another way waive fee. also Wells Fargo awful it’s still good idea look around new bank One Tail also pericarditis years ago. really bad day, admitted hospital, prescribed anti inflammatories felt much better day two later (though obviously finished course ant inflammatories). rarely exercise save walking possible could struggled something strenous. even close. essential worker 401k watching retirement plan fluctuate go work help sicks people. still less 1/2 deaths NY state has. honest. huge number people work order society move forward. fact life. Everyone cannot hunker down. work healthcare really option. Grocery stores, utilities, store provide people good work home, teachers online learning, banks. 

It huge ass list people work. amount people hunker big like think is. large scale industry think bars restaurants. fast food since many areas country lack grocery stores close peoples homes rely fast food. 

This way complex lets give everyone 30 bucks day stay home. economy complex Taiwan. really hope responses focus robust strategies tolerates import cases easily rather trying keep passing borders still community spread. Numbers low months lockdown.
But everything opened summer holiday travel people bought virus beach parties club.
(First wave bit tied apres ski partys winter holidays) Nice puffy shirt! that's part reason shrinking middle class problem society.   closing borders way keep virus affected countries protecting citizens.  Girlfriends sister. family well, GF model. saw one else bothering wedding stopped well. went GF expected there. would understood go, what's sence around one thinking disease control, I'd likely get anyway. Didnt expect bad. Makes sense want convert middle class pandemic lower class. interested one thing that's food table

I mean name, *eat* rich. put Facebook last page phone haven’t browsed week. think mental health improved. ..stop poor? There’s guy knew work going college. halfway Engineering degree. friend told guy going Engineering. immediately responded doubt would make it. friend responds “Oh will, he’s smart. Blah. Blah. Blah.” Seeing likely steroids, anger management issue (which attributed literally rage quitting one day), showing real sign “smart” was, still doubt.

Cut 2 years later, pass campus. asked doing. told jumped Engineering going Business, typical move guys find can’t cut Engineering. positive test rate around 3% right now.

Half month ago. rich people money invested stock market. it’s scary time non-wealthy people savings stock markets. may crash really f**ked. forget German also impressive industry biotechnology first validated covid-test world (juste China remember correctly).

It helps lot huge existing infrastructure mass produce testing kit. Lol, everybody says covid last year. Ooookay Super corona time boys bartender Paris. amazed still open. bars disaster.

The worst thing happen France Lyon PSG getting far champions league. 2 games week month, everytime French team scored goal people would jump scream hug wearing mask.
It impossible control, turn tv PSG game sat down.

Those games finished 2/3 weeks ago. Almost every single person know taking seriously doesn’t give shit now.

In March/April isolating brother wife work. stocked groceries week literally leave house all. sister laws parents sisters deal. So, Easter rolls around know we’re negative decided get together.

My best friend ripped new one. unleashed holy hell me. awful.

Fast forward past two months she’s like 7 different states. road tripped south there’s ton cases. took like four flights last week half. We’re worse March she’s shit 473828464x worse seeing isolated family holiday.

I even see healthcare workers know - N U R E - going indoor restaurants, parties without wearing masks, etc. Even people lauded heroes 6 months ago don’t give shit anymore. 

We’re fucked. Thanks. I'll able start leave 2 weeks I'm due maintain health insurance. need make then- hoping couple n95s everything started plus face shield enough. understand this, applies post replied well. remove Stop poking border create distractions media

How's related? get infected uncleaned table. infected person dripping drink table infect it. that, take much person realizing touched table part eats.
I agree though, infections mostly airborne. End day, much larger effect anything else. Order take-out. family even box UV lamp disinfect anything get outside. Stonks decent caring govt could make work. discipline, seriousness, positive peer pressure, aware importance individual society.


We alsow know dark side traits. realy tricky regions small. small outbreaks Umeå I-20 military facility closed boarders Norway pushed us something like 20.5. rest population almost infection. real story lot people getting fed safety measures. They'd rather take risk :-(

Now 90-year-old mother-in-low despite leaving house since Christmas... could create ""quarantine circle"". single friends kinda pared visiting eachother rules pre arranged. work restaurant, I've seen picnics parking lot,too, properly social distant. weird, we're learning deal. 

I totally get holidays though. That's...gonna mess, can't really say shit. *have* company, even 13 year old. know memes now. Seriously, great. hope US remains lockdown forever. I'm enjoying Americans country. March? Someone couple months late party. Yeah bathroom thing dumb pointless.

UV light fake, unless buy actual hospital grade one burns 3 seconds touches you.

/s programs designed help seasonal workers stayed NZ net exporting country anyway. I've Germany times since Corona came. (I live 5 km border) generally pretty disciplined following rules advice government. look cases per 1 million USA almost twice cases India yesterday ELI5? Cause ppl work virus it’s likely we’ll get money govt massive health care changes. Neither party wants universal healthcare Yup, alcoholism taken turn worse. plus side, casinos closed successfully kicked gambling bug. That’s weird way saying bailout package big business struggling hard times.  Following study story UK elderly patient contracting Covid-19 December 2019, theory such:

 spreading among young/able back Nov/Dec - mean generalise statistically, older people likely home/indoors colder/winter months. Young people work ""partying"" Christmas period ramps up. Nobody tested point even know existence. Hospital admissions however EIGHT times higher UK normal leading Christmas ""flu like illness"" ""respiratory symptoms"". 

Eventually reached tipping point virus seeded vulnerable community simply exploded resulting sharp rise hospital admissions death.

As lock-down implemented progressed, virus eventually ran course vulnerable community fizzled back transmitting among young able again. Remember epic fail swine flu vaccine? still didn’t. irish bartender paris.

People kiss thing lot less, however, bar pub, nobody wearing mask unless going bathrooms Maybe know since I'm position. smoke particles air inhibit spread covid acting ""filter"" enable available particles latch to? I'd interested seeing studies done good news flu basically nothing year. southern hemisphere, flu factor all.

Because people following rules. got lot dumbfucks US everything get sick spread disgusting germs. Wow sure spend every waking moment defending US response Corona. r/Melbourne seems really like you. really depends. kissed step children since spring, I've seen people take masks kiss hello.

Wtf ಠ_ಠ getting 100k number from? UCB tuition non-resident around 47k

Read National Post article want, don’t read don’t want. give up. I’ll me. Nobody gonna enforce this, health theater. rural lots commuters Portland. dumbass reopen schools cases rising.... average age Floridians vs Calgarians different, too. Can’t catch Covid going fast! task force lecture safety measures? Borders best. really rough times. ended getting tore foreclosure could limit fixed bills. sure would suck CSUs high commuter populations people still living parents. reason lack coordination refusal support people displaced jobs lies squarely one side this. earth people falling shit?

There's way ring fence people like indefinitely. earth would work? ever tried something like &amp; succeeded? Well thing winter virus spreads cram everybody inside like happening now. reason hospitals good many places reached peak lockdown measures economy destroying feel good measures much anything prevent spread, anything prevent deaths. There's probably gonna sort rise cases winter, mean locking gonna solve problem? contracted COVID-19, chances got infected engaging risky activities re: lack social distancing, meaning type people get infected likely continue activity initially got infected. hope people forum take cause nuts. won’t take vaccine scared shadow time got real problems Covid One way help shorten lines years come work institution health. throwing caution wind. greatly appreciate essential workers, realize privilege work home. 

But work hospital, saying going take precautions protect patients. profession. thing called hippocratic oath. Impossible, Covid-19 exist back then. Covid-05 hand... It’s Friday  It’s Trump, IMO. People hate want mad reflexively oppose everything.

If Biden wins you’ll see major shift sentiment.  Yeah...he does. tagged Good News. one even wears mask public. see people violating 1.5 meter rule time. wear mask laugh He's reddit thing people cry people them, system broken people simply agree policies want enact. No, therapist's place decide boundaries lie feel comfortable with, uniquely experienced position insight training recognize red flags. I've told, therapists therapist well, even notice they're overextending themselves, typically someone else confide recieve professional advice. 
If concerned though, definitely ask therapist it! venting you, there's nothing wrong mentioning saw article asking see therapist. 

Source: I'm clinician. mental health, ethical issues cross over. Plus I've weekly therapy decade. time, therapist gone issues explained usually works. Exactly. went overrunning hospitals one ever get virus ever Nothing new sky. mean, think COVID problem facing world?

I’m saying isn’t problem. think response problem proportion threat it’s absurd.

There tons problems affect people’s lives. Many problems cause premature deaths. don’t care those? That's surely backlog long weekend. Numbers come quickly next days. sound like type self diagnose. Imma doubt shit. tiny fibers breath in? Like whe cut damage it? time read filters say dispose cut torn. could wrong. understandable wanted save supplies health care workers. said messaging wasn’t great. CDC suggest april people wear cloth masks. ""Flatten Curve"" never final goal. immediate call action help make sure hospitals collapse. Somewhere like Romania, Albania, Bulgaria exceptions countries mentioned article - things actually worse first wave. Far (actual) infections, hospitalizations deaths ie, worse. 

I family Bulgaria partially true. Bulgaria handled first wave well, fact, better countries. almost full lockdown, limited travel cities, police points set up. went month so. point, people got fed staying home summer season coming (Bulgaria big tourist destination close proximity Black Sea), government caved pressure people opened slowly. Now, end summer season, pretty understandable see rise cases. probably another full lockdown month so, would expect.  Might artifact higher testing? Deaths risen London area despite increase cases. voting biden essentially voting Trump.

And spouting false equivalencies two turn voters fence, needed defeat Trump far understand it, reason R0 useful measure contagiousness 2.5 coronavirus infections spread much longer period time 1.3 flu infections

Precisely that. HIV higher R0 flu, measure explosive contagious is. accounts, HIV poorly transmissible poorly contagious virus. 

From another practical angle, R0 really capturing ideal spread naive population. population exists flu (except pandemic, perhaps). effective reproductive number (which sometimes called R0 anyway) kind amalgam 1) innate transmissibility contagiousness, and; 2) population immunity.

For time being, know differing contributions. might immunity rise find contagious flu. going apparent get longterm struggle SARS2 settles normal seasonal niche even dies out. entirely dictate SARS2 public health impact years coming. currently know that. news, people 100x likely get rained outside sure politicians care, unless shortage firefighters. hospitalization rate among 18-22 year olds marginally low Jesus taught you?  guess dreamed time burnt 193? Anyone know answer questions?

* (M23) live girlfriend (F23), one us contracted COVID-19, odds would? live small apartment building can't reasonably avoid it. I'm wondering is, we're around time, basically 100% certain would transfer one us other, would still unlikely contract we're young?
* odds young adult asymptomatic? vary age group? I'm finding, seems like 40%. So, answer first question one person definitely pass other, mean either us got COVID, there's 16% chance we'd wind asymptomatic? 

I'm trying figure meaningful difference would one us getting COVID test us getting COVID test. thin herd. Yes want end. doesn’t? adapt point. life problem, yours. I’ve taking precautions seriously. Don’t go gym (which miss lot that’s probably unsafe places open along indoor dining) social distance, don’t dine out, masks, etc...   sorry! Isolation reminding us much simple connection means. I'm glad got see daughter! Take care!! need make flu shots mandatory unless there’s health reason recipient can’t get it. they’re seeing rates high 90% Covid prisons, need whatever takes vaccinate flu. 

Surely cost medical care inmates flu Covid would far exceed cost flu vaccinations.

And article correctly points would worthwhile larger community people passing jail vaccinated, too. Airlines industry lobbyists want know that. oh redditors probably love bad news sensationalizing article Guess I'm tonight? Eating inside restaurant! again! Gasp! Guess I'm tomorrow?? friends house! Oh no! Guess last week? Went actual amusement park!! Oh dear lord! Next week...get this...i going shopping REAL LIVE STORES!!!

WE GONNA DIE COVID!!!!!!! Everyone stay home bring Depression!!!!!! seems happen, think good example athletes lost lung capacity yet never felt sick. Cardiomyopathy another thing happens small number people. America, wealthiest country world, like guy joins special olympics win something. "" working populace affected insane restrictions deaths"" 

That's literally lie. going long, hard winter. Stay safe. well. Seems like social media network news, Americans focus (mostly? completely?) numbers cases deaths COUNTRY. global. one world, living one pandemic. Thoughts? Well is. play hands dealt. what's alternative plan people financially struggling avoid ruin? worthy sacrifice elderly Boomers hang little longer? Again, struggling come science-based arguments. NCBI resource slight improvement.

But ""the lockdown difficult painful"" different ""we it."" already surrendered? POSSIBLE excuse could pray nation?

Especially nation?

The worse prayer needed.  part solution, part problem. Cases tracked protests made significant impact number cases? typically wearing masks social distancing. 

The spread overwhelmingly coming areas people wear masks, refuse social distance, go bars, events, rallies etc. 

Goes show easy COULD get pandemic control. We’re finding lot cases earlier pandemic. shame - says coronavirus. Lol, even going about? 

### Objective

To investigate presence viral RNA human semen patients severe acute-respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evaluate presence relevance semen parameters.

### Design

Pilot cohort study.

### Setting

University hospital.

### Patient(s)

Thirty-four men distributed as: 1) patients convalescence (patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection pharyngeal swab according reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction \[RT-PCR\] antibodies); 2) negative control group (no antibodies); 3) patients acute infection (detection SARS-CoV-2 pharyngeal swab).

### Intervention

Semen blood sample collected individual.

### Main Outcome Measure(s)

Analysis semen quality according World Health Organization standards. Detection SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR native semen sample density gradient preparation. Confirmation immunoglobulin (Ig) und IgG antibodies blood.

### Result(s)

Eighteen semen samples recovered men obtained 8–54 days absence symptoms, 14 control subjects, 2 patients active COVID-19 infection. RNA detected means RT-PCR semen, including semen samples two patients acute COVID-19 infection. Subjects moderate infection showed impairment sperm quality.

### Conclusion(s)

A mild COVID-19 infection likely affect testis epididymis function, whereas semen parameters seem impaired moderate infection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA could detected semen recovered acute COVID-19–positive men. suggests viral tra Lol pretty clear bench mark. sadi thanksgiving instead would mean theyre keeping schools closed appease pilgrims? 


The story nothing literally quote anonymous facebook comments get bias without directly saying it. Ford handle better US counterparts? Stay tuned! IFR 0.26 according cdc, 94% comorbitiyy, also according cdc... don’t understand you’re downvoted. legit concern. I’m sorry dealing this. 5 million now. New Zealand silently deluged infected returning citizens infected others R value 4-4.5 short window March. Yeah fuck another year.

Distribute vaccine nursing homes that’ll enough people ass resorts name calling. ""evidence"" says PROBABLY effective. July August worst months since start pandemic. one ""Well count NY California"" people? Lol May taxpayers refuse fund salaries well? exactly right, saying forcefully push anything short Martial law.

But correct, Cult Personality clings every word they'd embraced masking would advocate. what? Sacre bleu! God sucks, I'm glad he's able live relatively normal life.

I'd completely okay paying government back meant could guaranteed losing fucking apartment food table till get even remotely safe vaccine shit. wear mask, social distance public, wash hands. taking seriously?

You mean intentionally, right? I've known along... expect there's huge overlap anti vaxxers. get people seem grasp possibility might this. Japan remarkable success story, though. They've ~1,400 deaths population ~125,000,000. 1,400 might sound like lot, per capita they've twice number deaths New Zealand (which 24 COVID deaths). elbow touches make little sense say cough elbow,so great idea either... can’t restaurants remain open indoor seating? Restaurants following rules state haven’t case spread. don’t allow least 50% capacity close. can’t gym open? Zero spread gyms city. Closing businesses unacceptable. You’re really going call narcissist I’m afraid livelihood mental health? Screw you. Great government needs pay us  People Reddit unfortunately don’t like facts  man wish Americans like point state level, maybe even county level, need start listening epidemiologists economists tandem. needs balance economic health country public health. point mitigation risk worth say 30 percent unemployment, mass homeless starvation? factor mental health.

Dolt 45 help us. Fair. It’s starting weigh more. Especially I’m seeing friends go I’m trying get r others sick  Enough internet you. Take breather. \*spits tobacco beer bottle*

Sounds like communism us

Nobody taking seriously even cases beginning pandemic Jesus! Calm down! :) GameStop tried make essential I’m surprised US right. right. 😉 I’m sorry break bad news, you’re probably never going leave house. Since records began, never DAY US nobody died flu. vaccine flu, covid deadly. unless find CURE covid, you’re probably never going leave house ever again.

You alone. millions right thing quietly. 👍🙏💕 Yeah think spike likely everyone going vacation coming back. almost guaranteed happen. schools starting again, question bad going get? Everyone wearing masks everywhere many still working remotely, day day life like contributing factor, although still blows mind many people see restaurants day day. verra... How? people money barely surviving. governing body helped us times like these. got H1N1 nasal spray younger since scared needles back then. Crazy think can't wait get vaccine now. Mental health important physical health.

Not quite. can't mentally healthy you're, dunno, fucking dead global pandemic.  can’t breath outside smoke. 107-110° “very hazardous ” air northern California concussive even going outside house all! actually France lock-down, got kinda stuck boarder closings flight cancellations. rough, 2 months able go store 1 hour exercise. fill form time date went out. first buy tabac shop made mobile version. caught anything form 130 euro ticket, 1,000 2nd time 3k 3rd time possible jail. Beach closed, little take out, could visit friends family unless disabled. weird sucked, number cases dropped almost nothing. Unfortunately lifted almost restrictions time holiday period, high again. Anyways point Americans never go measures strict, takes drop cases. continue highest death toll going rough winter. Take one look pussies reddit react broken windows lol. People double ever think shaking chains necks Snag game system mate Yeah, used rarely talk siblings live different countries WhatsApp really connected us better Facebook ever did. cousins never really chat unless something interesting post passive feeds like Facebook good that. work colleagues 20 years ago happy keep touch watch feed really chat unless major milestone comes up. last 2 scenarios, WhatsApp really fit bill. totally get mental health aspects pandemic. hits closer home many Americans. 

But fuckwits stop acting like everyone going die? part problem. Enough fear mongering.

COULD TAKE FUCKING SERIOUSLY ACT LIKE 3RD YEAR FUCKING DOCTORS CLUE.

Don't believe me? Read comment history replete sources galore.

This virus destroys heart tissue. virus destroys lung tissue. virus destroys vascular system brain. FUCKWITS 'stop fearmongering' ""teach controversy"" bull shit HELPING.

**Take fuck seriously. Wear fucking mask. Social Distance. absolutely fucking mandated nation wide.**

 **WITH FINES BACK UP** cases started rise well schools opened. even seen impact yet, surely uhh great. Perhaps shoot virus Also leading medical professional America 50 years. know like amateur. Notice even mr ""your fired"" get rid dude sticks around like soap scum. little off, cdc spring said 0.65, still significantly lower 3-7% originally thought.

Edit: wrong ig article supports original half percent, though say experts debating estimated around 0.2-1.5%.

Still, it’s best 2x lower originally told, worst 15. No, we're going tell you, responsibility deal mental health issues, like everyone else responsible mental health issues. There's thousands mental health issues every day anyway grow up. shouldn’t protests trick treating Totally agree there. difference think Trump, even people expecting get rich, vote hate people does. I'm living work healthcare. worst worlds. working exposed general public entire time coming home completely alone months end. I'm really lowest point life right now. know I'm going make winter. one cares us ""heroes"" anymore. Never got hazard pay proposing. I'm mentally done choice keep going work every day dealing thanks compensation additional risk. one oppressed stop sensationalizing, ""protesters"" middle class white brats get go home mommy daddy.

Hope next Purge. airlines flew middle seats blocked, country flew required negative test test arrival  ""Collège"" France middle school first year high school US. TIL AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine :(  let wipe middle class, then... oops long?

Until winter passes optimal conditions spreading COVID Why? end goal that?

To reduce number death coronavirus ya big dummy. rocket science.

It's obvious selfish twat puts happiness health general public using excuse ""mental health"" cover ass. ain't gonna mental health dead 'rona. Get yourself. rhetorical question thanks 'splaining - they'll like elbow touch nothing all. Found American worth mentioning homes designed air leakage air replaced steady pace. mess anything broken.

This goes homes ancient. thought europe much better US. happened. [Web MD Space article news places weirdly enough Daily article Poop particles air u flush  u googled IFR flu within demographic? go, head first fall. choices?

Essential businesses still see plenty traffic across country, obviously.

Many restaurants remain open serve takeout.

Bars establishments need shutdown.

The issue people clearly can't trusted follow rules. marginally better economy moment worth cost significant uptick coronavirus activity, _guaranteed_ people take seriously.

The economic benefit _think_ going get keeping businesses open hilariously thought based entirely inability process stress losing job.

What experiencing normal, healthy narcissism. Unfortunately interests apparently going falling line interests country much less risk.

The best thing get comfort zone change direction better position.

If possible, I'm sorry. already lost generation. many lifetime economic collapses... never strong effort entire world though  whether **you** die.

It's whether cause someone **else** die.

But wastes oxygen usually can't grasp that.

If regard civilization, kindly escort ours. Interesting. anxious find handled. stressful knowing right now. Thanks response! Oops! used naughty word...trying again...  True... comment probably sounded flippant. calling unknown redditor ""good."" right, could know that? saying office worker done good realize. domino effect small gestures (a smile, etc) positive effect people see. Even they're a$$h0le, biggest a$$h0le comments behaviors others inspired great things life. No, obviously vast majority opposite you’d call “cultured,” rest us aren’t idiots would like leave country getting fucked. trying election, bought tickets Ireland everything couple months back, saw Ireland tightening restrictions travel American citizens specifically. don’t fucking blame them. Canceled tickets. Waiting citizenship application now. think dual citizenship way til least December unless wanna end another COVID hotspot. Ignorance bliss, right?

*Spoiler Alert*

Sir Billy Conley speech message true believer like yourself. one wants come anyway. good thing, get wrong. = free education. lot community colleges state schools offer free reduced cost tuition state residents. 

What many ppl know majority cost attend classes schools tuition, ""fees"". sure applies (didnt read article, going to), thought it'd worth mention either way.

For record went community college UMass felt like got pretty solid deal education. ""no tuition exorbitant fees"" thing leave bad taste mouth. likely faced choice risking life becoming destitute school like many republican dominated states mandated person instruction. What's actual justification here? Agreed. garden really fun spending time fucking around it. apartment.  really say, “and don’t try look rosy side things”? Wtf? Great message us mental health issues. myriad reasons, rather one believe. don’t culture France/Italy/Spain tend touchy other, rule thumb tend less ‘rebellious’ (poor word open told do) UK, additionally they’ve tested lot less UK.

Also mediterranean countries France hugely popular tourist traps, maintaining low numbers economy heavily dependent letting people visit hard.

After believe discrepancy reporting, Germany reporting people died pneumonia/cancer/etc whilst covid died covid, whilst UK reported COVID deaths.

But yeh, sure lot reasons contribute countries numbers differing. Good you! really suck personally , would choose live lockdown country 26k cases 700 deaths US 6million cases 200k deaths. 🤷🏻‍♀️ think anyone saying can't visit family things friends. last six months hard creative weather garbage. even creative is.

Hunker mean see friends family ever. I've gotten takeout, visited family outside, parents visit outside, taken walks talked phone texted extensively, helps. 

Married people forget Single Person's Lonely really fast. know why. right, make sound easy. easy. know hard single people. I'm extrovert lived alone many years quite painful. 

Talking phone substitute visit friend helps lot people think. want call friends? Probably force to. 

This going forever. smart person, creative thinking skills scaffold way side. lot people really great problem solvers simply listen recommendations can't figure live Terrible life pandemic. get Covid give others.

It's hard single people. single people know things make situation better introduces new challenges want deal with. Lol coronavirus 1 million deadliest things ever.  scared. Well said *almost* anyone. coming from? T-cells: joke you? Die hard Sox fan. heard that. Wow. keep open let people 10 ft restaurant order behind barrier masks on.

I'm glad taking proper precautions. Thank keeping customers safe. restaurants, gyms bars this. ventilate all. anything close windows turn AC people eat indoors. likely closing end October curbside letting staff collect unemployment cold outdoor seating. 

You may want research HEPA grade air purifiers. Getting might help keep restaurant open relatively safely gets colder. So, start wearing masks flu season, too? seem bad idea. I'm India believe chart deaths reported. One significant precondition covid obesity (which courses heart issue, lung issue, blood pressure issue, diabetes, etc), major issue there. check data East Asia, SEA South Asia death per million, numbers one two digits, consistent. India currently reported 55/M, higher neighboring countries Pakistan (29) Bangladesh (28) according worldometers. I'm sure completely went every single scientists head. 

/s/ ^just ^in ^case Ok. haven’t really traveled either. airplane travel hasn’t contact traced outbreaks. I’m hoping mandatory mask usage matters. Every bar around open month. went got food license could reopen. Bars already open here. I'm glad restaurant work still takeout (afaik we're restaurant city fully reopened yet) strict mask, service policy  Lol, waiting rest world start calling ‘Murica Virus. Irate foreign nationalist start calling “American Cheese” plastic freedom cheese thing spite (maybe it’s Americans who’re dumb enough pull “freedom fries” stunt). Haha, look up. use similar propaganda technique homeopathy people used. Misrepresent paper, extrapolate things paper say, make confident unsubstantiated assertions push agenda, spread misinformation real news. There's real science underlying cross reactivity, nobody really knows means practically yet, definitely mean drop restrictions let Covid burn population. know Mental Health - it’s important family. would without physical health. know someone unwilling give socializing guess - got Covid-19- spread 7 people. idk went. 7 year old extremely bored, I’d say attitude better most. Right?? received many job offers, even two weeks ago, many positions wouldn’t otherwise considered first year teacher. stay home. could go wrong!

...


*Its^Only^2020* Last time looked, things seemed vary LOT Australian states. still true? That’s true either. know plenty people want come can’t. I'm sure need ""men""tal??? health advice. coming understanding this? Common sense dictates can't eat mask exposing occupants building. one seems grasp 6ft distance equate shit limitations cubic space aerosolize virus floating place. said week worst. We're what? Day 3 think? initial thought ""all them"" brain kicked said, no.. can't close them. One seems kinda low.. like close block least? Air tight logic. It’s almost like one clue everyone jumping conclusions comfort clicks.

Shocking know. Look crowd Trump rally. think people travel internationally anyway? Ban Muslims might terrorists? Yup. 

Screen people might spreading pandemic? Nah. everyone lives grandma and/or socializing others. live multigenerational households take necessary precautions make personal sacrifices? put requirement risk? first economic shutdown absolutely necessary flatten curve. it’s flattened. people want keep everyone safe Covid - it’s stay though. Time change strategy. 

Edit: removed emotion 1000 occurring? lot places consistently ""lulls"" weekends (sometimes Mondays), followed ""bumps"" Monday Tuesday. That's test results weekend piling getting reported later.  Usually 2-5% depending testing Cases going 6 weeks now... 'Complete safety' never thing begin with. actually OK without, opted take it. Part time gig covering everything far. Total annual expenses low, though. Yeah insurance gave discount basically driving last 6 months haha  real? virus pauses waits everyone finish lunch put masks back on?

TIL virus Breath Wild monster. headlines garbage.

They meaning pump us infer happened school.

In four weeks headlines might accurate right they’re bait.  Cases function testing. Fat people dying? Shocking. misread: ""we're stinking..."" Australia app found anybody contact tracers found interviews. panic app. UK testing terrible start pandemic seems decent now? They're 0.74% positive rate 400k tests per day. believe closer 10%, much higher.

However, similar, COVID-19 less virulent easier pass around. get severe disease C19 pretty much got SARS. similarities severe disease caused similar, SARS-1 large amount mild asymptomatic cases driving IFR. mention medtech medicine improved lot since start millennium. I'm Quebec 
My kids' schools mandatory masks 


Am missing something ?? yeah brah go live woods land nobody work misinformation Civil unrest.. don’t think country could handle another lockdown. definitely seems though bojo cronies planting seed Christmas without family already. Frankly, don’t think COULD afford lockdown nation winter current economic state. Well, US take almost anyone. *want* come. NH recently stacked bunch infection spread catalysts top other, I'm real fucking excited next 3-4 weeks added bike week events column may want look much greeter Walmart decreases shop lifting.

The simple deterrents work keep honest people honest.

It’s going stop Jason Bourne? No. It’s gonna stop dingus mcdumbface even attempting go thru airport know somebody “looking”  someone exposed known case covid-19, positive test result next day? take days positive test result might happen?  Nice wrapping bias ""you'll excuse believe assessment"". course, preferred sources accurate. way off-topic. Dang gig side job. need find house.

For people know DD. Typically pays drivers ,$2-4 per delivery.
Driver get restaurant, wait order x minutes drive house. 
DD keeps biggest piece fee, drivers hope 1 dollar tip. Wasn’t article day saying exact opposite? roller coaster never ends. tell do! Muh freedoms! Cant paying much car insurance gas arent eating working. Silver lining least. 400 pua kicked yet? live bay area. One good friends mom's viral pneumonia doctors seen before. hospital ventilator weeks. Fortunately recovered got sent home required oxygen several months pneumonia. friend developed cough lasted several weeks months. 

They never figured covid certainly makes question long here... screening sort half ass would miss half active cases better nothing. I’m Florida, time Miami felt like big cities extra Spanish. Rural Florida felt...much different. job gone never hard lockdown US, people bitching imposed staycations still picking food go, shopping groceries, booze (man liquor stores busy early ... quickly learned bottles whiskey good long term solution moderate drinking without taking extra trips suffering serious anxiety) big box shops. everyone fast food industry lawyers classified essential workers anyway. stupidity flying domestically America back America another country ridiculous. Australia, screen aerosols old school metal detectors domestically. keeping liquids tiny bags separate everything else. fly America corral section airport allowed leave ahead flight, good luck need bathroom, food drink.

LPT: freeze liquids bring cooler America. size limit solids. Duh plenty restaurants open right now. state goes Phase 3 tomorrow. 

There plenty people using ""COVID"" excuse low-effort dating (aka house hangouts). ignore them. plenty do. someone tries ask them: ""if worried COVID, inviting strangers house?"" way, know still idea 6 months quarantine 3rd wave still 2nd? young gonna get sick? places offer require contactless delivery... like, open door leave.     

apartments kinda scary still, reckon.... could set somewhere outside come down. Really America would admit this. dentists office managers taking temperatures it’s bit nope go work. Ah yes, EUA+, new streaming service FDA Yeah u wear mask. Try stand next window. AC vent. u're front fresh air. eye glasses. Also try avoid bathrooms. locked everything forever cases would go down, isn’t realistic possibility. Brilliant!!! Lets reclassify activities “meal times” virus choice stop! Good luck argument here. sub rarely cites statistics, like without preconditions 50 impacted. UnKnOwN long term consequences RuN HiDe!!! Please...studies show specific subset society high risk. can’t argue people thread won’t happy eradicated. That’s going happen short vaccine isn’t going happen anytime soon let alone one everyone take. Economic shutdowns including restaurant closures harm long term. Im loss there’s critical thought solution lock inside. I've become much better tipper since ~March/April. People need earn income need eat something aside shitty cooking. Win-win. job scans employees entering yet still least 10 cases covid job. 🤷‍♂️ Good point grocers. get summers earn half pay. Fauci messages seem alternate optimistic pessimistic depending whether day even odd.  ""We similarly investigated change hypertension hazard ratio (from 1.09 (1.05–1.14) adjusted age sex, 0.89 (0.85–0.93) covariates included), found diabetes obesity prin-cipally responsible reduction (HR 0.97 (0.92–1.01) adjusted age, sex, diabetes obesity). ""

Though drilled age - ""with hypertension associated higher risk age 70 years lower risk age 70"" Looking footage, think know what's coming. .... would saved pandemic took aggressive measures beginning.     

but, can't put toothpaste back tube... vaccines hope Would love see say one faces .you hide fear call others children rofl!!!!!!! talking main stream media, striking fear hearts beginning. Except Fox “News,” pushing guys agenda downplaying detriment us. Yeah, 6 feets apart hour eating without masks gonna safe. Anyone who's ever sneezed life could make own. 6 feet ""you're standing line pay store seconds"" ""you're walking near someone sidewalk"" distance. 


But taken ""those actually 0ft, 6ft ""you're safe without mask forever"" distance. Nopenopenope. Awesome. live relatively expensive well-populated region cost live high. Less costly paying mom's covid health care costs funeral got infected kid. Unfortunately United States, give certain freedoms, never give back. Don’t blame people scared give freedoms. read history book? Doesn’t matter many bodies dropping streets. People America give freedom. remember “science” funded people want control research results. studies coming permanent damage due Covid, don’t forget advertising revenue, research grants, billions dollars floating around anyone claims helpful information pertaining COVID.  Pandemics kill lots people, there’s getting around it. lot mistakes administration containing spread virus matter president is, America country equipped deal extended lockdown. 

Some Americans turned major assholes refusing wear masks caring anyone else. guess call numb. rest US keep social distancing mask wearing there’s vaccine. There’s really nothing else then.

I speak myself. I’m sitting house tears every single day another 1000 Americans died Covid. done keep safe that’s anyone point. love virus makes lazy fucks resort “we need communism”. 

Get job. Don’t fat fuck. Go outside little you’ll ok. #Summary

**What already known topic?**

Community close contact exposures contribute spread COVID-19.

**What added report?**

Findings case-control investigation symptomatic outpatients 11 U.S. health care facilities found close contact persons known COVID-19 going locations offer on-site eating drinking options associated COVID-19 positivity. Adults positive SARS-CoV-2 test results approximately twice likely reported dining restaurant negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.

**What implications public health practice?**

Eating drinking on-site locations offer options might important risk factors associated SARS-CoV-2 infection. Efforts reduce possible exposures mask use social distancing difficult maintain, eating drinking, considered protect customers, employees, communities. Also, CSUs tuition quite reasonable. $3300 semester plus fees. complaints me. glad making science based decisions. Onsite accommodations exist lab based classes. Well case, hope beach person are, Australia nice beaches... far I'm aware, state U.S. (with possible exception New York) full lockdown. I'm talking ""you can't leave house all, except one person, week go grocery store"" kind lockdown. Everything I've seen US half-measures, people wonder ""why goalposts keep moving"". strawman would require actual argument taking place using false dichotomy oppose said argument.  refuting anything argument. least now. Lol gonna happen Wow. many votes asking question genetics. I've seen genetics frequently mentioned popular media since beginning possible explanation variation individuals disease severity. I've somewhat skeptical idea think factors probably play bigger role variation individuals. still seems genetics could play role. believe conclusively ruled scientific community. even studied much matter. Liar. Thia man belongs r/imatotalpeiceofshit  know issue facebook. Plenty people sub throw around 'I'm anti-vaxx *but*' excuse whenever someone mentions vaccines *other* Oxford ones. wow... wow...

""Remember said could shoot someone fifth avenue lose voters?""

WTFFF DERANGED MANIAC SITTING INSIDE WHITE HOUSE CALLING SHIT??? 

I thought Tony Abbott horrible, got rid within year something... think parties somehow necessary prevent “deprivation collapse”?

You know also affects economy? large number workers ill, kids ill can’t work, post viral complications like post viral fatigue make working difficult impossible. Honestly think ubi easier sell right half country single payer Healthcare. one know uses email social anymore. use SMS international costs way much. imo biggest indicator March 2019 sample false positive nothing subsequent samples end year.  That’s bad. go outside, gonna get stepping out. I’d concerned effects mental health tbh terrible brain pain reading post won‘t wear mask I‘ll continue partying indoors💗💗💗 school kids told get jumper (sweater) occasion. everyone party already positive exactly endangered? things well live less half said needed daily. school job opportunities require things too. smart businesspeople get real degrees, BA's Business. I’m using government’s label. don’t believe aren’t essential. again, everyone sub constantly act like going die. 30, chance extremely low. know lot people would wear masks lazy care little get one themselves. public mask dispensers something like imagine would raise compliance, limited resources might issue. dont see cant mask production overdrive point though  think Facebooks job determine legitimate take action it. Like case, yah obvious people posting wrong. sets precedence Facebook edit content dissenting thoughts. good me. need 'social support' realize three others beat 12 year old kid lolz; piece trash humanbeing.

I care million dollars, make minimum wage, live hut 3rd world village without running water.

My family poor somehow managed avoid this. low expectations seem have, rich people supposed generous, poor people excused destroying vandalizing things communities... America - “hold beer” isn't. Google+ best chance match FB failed noone uses friends family use it. There's currently alternative offers FB does. trust Fauci things corona, article 2 months ago. I’d nervous going gym 2 months ago well. 2 months data gyms. can’t really find anything significant problem going gym. 

While yeah CDC main source virus info, they’ve flip flopped much get. New info new virus comes constantly, Trump leading country fuck all, I’m hard pressed believe 100%. Like I’ll still clean groceries even though CDC says surface transmission low They're going visit buy's 4th home. ventilation, windows occasionally open. Flip flop Fauci trying cover ass. time. feel too. I’d hold gets approved EU countries Australia/New Zealand, somewhere else don’t think compromised US is. hate home alone want office. people don’t want home anymore. Netherlands still 1 2 deaths per day double population. NL wrong compared Denmark Norway? People still getting sick ... People still die flu Coronavirus. Sweden declared ""won"" rising infections

Nope, allegedly: maintains grip Denmark: number hospitalized rises:  registered infected last 24 hours."" I’m sorry hear that. frustrating. deaths hospitalizations continue higher even March. Although they’ve dropped peak early august, they’re still pretty high. Positivity rate isn’t meaningless, it’s arguably important metric determining spread. Definitely relevant case numbers overall, it’s significantly impacted testing levels almost everyone right calls socialists socialists....
Im certain policies would work US, work across Europe all, diverse larger population compared US.

How many actually elevate propper socialists nations?
A thousand US? total.
Its easy find large group echo chamber.
Just like conservatives far right groups.
The reality kind people rare.

And listen defend russian/chinese, mostly either nationalists payed defend nation...
Just like people still defend need travel far. Go local DSA meeting 85% subreddits.

I know kind loopy world live in, mine... concept always bothered me: Fighting hard keep companies billionaires power much money literally skew outcome entire worlds economy think they’re winning capitalist game. reality could MUCH BETTER. businesses, getting bailout. They're private company. restrictions measures, though depends federal state.

Here northern Schleswig-Holstein:

Every time go restaurant, give name address, cases tracked. Many people avoid restaurants, want give name address establishments used handling private data.

Restaurants establishments minimum distance tables limits number simultaneous guests. unusual see every second table restaurant blocked off.

Non-essential shops limits number simultaneous customers allowed store. Often tracked forcing customers carry shopping baskets none available, wait customers return exit.

Shops public transport require masks. People avoid public transport avoid wearing masks long periods time. Travel definitely reduced. happen? No. course not. Cause matters country making money people scrape survive. would one thing heath insurance wasn’t dependent job. pandemic, health insurance question. go work, get sick, repeat. say things improving.

In saying there's still plenty outbreaks active infection putting police officers hospitals interact public.

Restaurants bars full capacity lead outbreaks. 

Infections one thing. ""Oh went visit friend got sick,"" infection. ""125 people got Covid bar michigan"" outbreak. Outbreaks enemy, facilitate exponential growth.

Especially population dgaf, wear masks, think politicized game. 

There larger picture death, hospitalization, often permanent disability factored ""what bars can't stay open."" math ask many bars human life worth. number, calculate admit trade numbers instead hiding behind vague ""but better now"" language. That's honest thing do, facing truth saying *exactly many bars restaurants* willing trade much human suffering, remembering type death people Covid. peaceful often quick. slow suffocation. integrity consistency take consideration stand numbers.

But one wants that. Everyone wants stay fantasyland think numbers calculate externalities, think bummer life disrupted. Accept trade show numbers stand them. ^(Got it. Thanks you) u/MSGTiger discussion going circles. Next time Scots vote, matter live, plus 16 years old get vote.

It close win next time. quarantine two weeks safely interact families.  Sounds like better plan driving whole planet deprivation collapse. Thanks racist, dumb rednecks forced stay inside longer. need complete lockdown 2022. open. indefensible declare children safer thought good news? already knew could vectors.  way humanity deserve childhood cancer Lol k. without mask distancing baseball game. happening group republicans refuse spend one red cent help anyone, way. ideology reducing government services zero taxation got here. White = bad? Charge reckless endangerment something. Talking players coaches, drunken idiots. game man. know who's blame lack leadership relief. 

Our government failed us. led 3 people.

1. President lied us severity still nothing.

2. Speaker House - Passed $3 Trillion relief testing package.

3. Senate Majority Leader - Refuses pass relief thinks need $1 Trillion big businesses go bankrupt need liability protection priority small ones survival.

-#1 #3 ones trying help majority Americans. belong Party. GETS control? feeling US control months... Literally, government still talking they’re working hard reduce people’s reliance government, i.e. going help anyone state eight weeks. state setup here. act Congress would happen lockdown nation. would never happen right now. Florida opens bars Monday 50% capacity 😂 house.gov

Ah got man, let reference couple .ru’s say he’s totally innocent ;)

You don’t want “real source” I’ve given multiple. guys predictable nowadays man, algorithms need get better Putin’s gonna upgrade hardware... :/ trust them

they saying september vaccine ready emergency use Second wave come... looking data Canada vs. US hospitalization rate children significantly higher US rate, however, ICU admission rate 20% lower US. completely unscientific based current raw data, seem better job identifying early treatment. Part reason likely health care system part better control virus. Also death lags behind. takes time infected dying. problem saying (not I'm saying problem) way get rid extreme lockdown, minute let ANYONE surge cases again. Look New Zealand, locked thought beat it, loosened little bit infections. 

No one wants hear ""lockdowned"" indefinitely seems that's measure we've got vaccine eliminate this. going keep muddling vaccine, us. stating fact definitely work duties. said factually wrong. different article, trying spin way. self quarantine 2 weeks get tested negative, visit them. Follow guidelines. Looks like people still dying...
What Sweden wrong compared neighbors (who allegedly rising infections compared Sweden now)? hundreds schools Florida alone cases FL. key metrics like hospitalizations deaths dropped? Positivity rate meaningless statistic. Yeah, much go makes sense me. They’ve saying spread asymptomatic people would get tested regardless. seeing stupid still spread it. makes sense. 

My friend kind picks chooses follows does. still says it’s flu, half ass social distances wears mask to. I’m going quarantine life 14 days since he’s getting tested.

Should’ve mentioned before, FL majority people know think friend. give credible sources, reddit post campaign website? We're supposed believe wild accusations? actually want real source. always sad see another 14 year old lost racist online community. maybe one day get absolute shit beaten acting like this. never happen, know type. even think saying shit like someone's face. someone racist upper-class white male friends high school lunch room, is. would certainly make full, day. outlier all, people eat fast food frequently much likely overweight--not way around. 

My caloric goals usually 1300-1500 day, would leave calories rest day. FWIW South Dakota's case/death charts look deaths trending 7-day charts. overall state 19.69 deaths per 100k population, well US average.

South Dakota ranks 41st terms per capita deaths, death rates  says everything mindset. fact think can't positive news regarding virus must buttressed b bad news pretty sad. another symptom state subreddit in. wife teacher, 2 months gets summer well earned opinion. school year works full 8 hour day 30 kids plus 1-3 hours home almost every night either grading papers, prepping next day/week. MF nuts Trump dgaf. pressures world leaders dirt campaign opponents. main protection trump pressuring countries vaccines approval processes sufficiently independent someone trump call up. Ohhh okay thank clarifying! Spoiler, wont. Surprisingly, I’ve seen conservatives board UBI public healthcare also younger people persistent neurological problems mild cases. something works another country honestly, appears work another country, mean work here. US unique size diversity. 

Again, people love use countries examples even though socialist, people die incredibly large numbers everywhere else. 



Oh think ? People routinely hold water Venezuela, defend Soviet Union, China , North Korea like. 

You need travel far. Go local DSA meeting 85% subreddits. Everyone under-counting, difficult know under-counting more.

Not true. countries like Belgium Norway certainly count, hard check comparing excess mortality. actually go work living? Sounds like good plan white collar workers sitting biscuit, never risk it. Yup everything North Dakota fairly alright everything considered sturgis county 30,000 people almost 1000 cases thinking ""Man, remember got evacuated fire couple years ago......wait.....when again.....OCTOBER 2019? HASNT EVEN YEAR?!!?""

It seriously feels like last year 3 4 Holiday gatherings happening Zoom? No, they're happening. can't deal political discussions. There's also lot denial BS work against. know we'll ever get control. reason believe won’t similar amount cases added yesterday months ahead? actually drop, look like lag reporting? see issue clearly distress ? like peoples mental health suffering badly enough already.

I see issue trust me, people die left right distress going disappear. point?

Because COVID, *more* dying every single day. Stop hitting play game every time get car drive. Life risks. waste! doubt saved lives vigilant have! Thank that. logic: 0.0000000000000000005% people dying let's get back normal, virus worries overblown. Millions millions people getting long-term damage, cardiac problems, pulmonary problems, neurological problems, meeeeeeeh. There's going significantly suicides murders covid deaths long run due government destroying economy people losing businesses jobs. next five-ten years going economical shit fall, especially trillions dollars federal reserve printing assess agree too... purposely given money stayed home, closed everything (airports transportation. Given everyone 1 week warning), tell people strict curfew. wonder many people would recover almost completely stop spread virus? bet much money would saved long run. Seems people recovering catching again, isnt good sign. takes least 10 years create one Lose. Loose set free; release. I'm commenting made mistake before. someone hook sister text article please? There’s paywall Sweden's goal herd immunity herd immunity yet. goal take measures needed health care system could handle burden. primary metric whether able provide health care everyone needed it. 

One keys Sweden's strategy health care system controlled funded central government. gives lot control flexibility divert resources need go. 

Sweden also really different culture ours. high voluntary compliance government safety recommendations, 50% households single-person homes. 

The US would able successfully replicate number reasons. We're vastly different country. Italy btw. France rather „young country“. brings conversation data, too. Collecting selling become insanely huge, totally unregulated industry. Facebook users platform's customers, they're product.. I'm Facebook marketer actually creepy precise get ads. “Complete” safety isn’t possible anything. Walking front door poses risk hit killed falling object sky. Everything calculation risk vs. reward order balance desire safety human needs physical mental health. hard wait til corona taken care of? Many, many people still less affected regions. Spoken like someone zero concept much skill, space, luck, time investment required successfully grow enough vegetables even small amount sustenance. Yeah, can't get past either. say even scientists know virus airborne back (debatable...) even go tell everyone RIGHT THEN, knowing government's response happened month later... said something then?

If get re-elected (and posing ""back normal"" candidate, I'm terrified will) deserves THIRD impeachment this. hope certain US leader bully countries approve vaccine increase chances getting elected. totally see that. Fucked ain't surprisin We're mostly covid-free, city really stuffed hotel quarantine process. 

We've got control now, come big cost. I’m sorry POTUS lying? Cries India 96,000 cases single day. worry FBI killing decades. screwup reopening? keep opening getting couple hundred cases time forever could let happen achieve herd immunity like Sweden.  It’s deadly, lot old infirm people caught died ago? pretty rude I'm done you. Well... deal. family started hunkering early March. Aside walks neighborhood mask on, I've house five times period. Four essential doctors/ dental appointments. Use Chime. I’ve used almost year I’ve never charged cent fees Why? Universal healthcare majority support talked decades. UBI still new idea lot people.  Haha, ya, comment specific Sweden UK, idea governments cautious right bad sign. feel like know better now. look facts logic, sweet summer child. 150,000 people die every single day globally causes Part reasons French revolution massive inequality inflation exacerbated debt caused poor taxation system poor grain harvest caused food prices skyrocket making food unaffordable majority peasantry. choice starve revolt choice pretty obvious. modern US nowhere near conditions needed revolution. think people hold back nothing left lose. Lol, viruses give two shits ""civilization"" Um, secret vaccines ready lined up. cut corners clinical testing harm trust vaccine uptake reduced. Schools neighboring orange county open late september. La County gotten red zone. can't open. move red, wait three weeks open. math. school open November? predict elementaries week go back November. January probably likely schools LA. lol lol lol bro, put rules place, someone breaks them, get arrested lol lol lol Happy Cake Day! We've done Door Dash pick up, support good local restaurants. fast food since March except Panda Express once. miss eating all, either, especially fast food. cooking's improved I've lost pounds, LOL. much better now. Plenty educated normalcy proponents lining present obfuscating arguments using statistics say open up. weeks later watch numbers skyrocket. Salt. Grain. data carefully controlled. people prefer hate US numbers really sign good testing rates transparent data. easier permanently triggered think critically though. going see max corona do

I, one, welcome new COVID-21 overlord. Agreed. things I've heard cases claustrophobia, sensory issues, severe burns, something else. rare cases I'm sure would make sense exempt, that's it. debunked countless times masks make harder breath? Go local one! you’re worried virus, go one outdoor seating. 

A family run business family. they’re open, they’re likely struggling degree. You’re going help emotional/social health, help too. Yet UK had
‘Eat help out’ scheme 50% bill first 3 days week ran 6 weeks.

Genius “You guys refused” dishonest well. people cooperated made others cooperate. IDK image head people couldn’t see loved ones, flights offline, events venues, restaurants, public spaces, masks enforced police months still are. Even middle Indiana. basis Americans anything different countries, anecdotally. Sweepingly, highly enforced respected. Oh write first. airbnb printer, French handwriting horrid took minutes write out. Tabac shop like 5 2 euro something, big deal. Huh, it’s actually dangerous put children young mask. Fuck dude. We’re it. Deaths decline since April. School back session month students teachers died auto accidents way school died COVID. It’s marginally worse flu lot infectious, reason it’s obvious we’ll get herd immunity vaccine comes whether like not. accept reality let’s move lives. Hell yeah!! Can't wait really due good winter northeast!  Quebec trip likely question since border closed.

I hope try fuckery skiing. Like already wore masks time, outside everyone keeps distance. thing see thats issue gondolas least less crowded can’t anymore. Stop telling people weeks, months. It’s six months they’re moving goal posts. treatments? it’s stop infections? Get real. hospitals aren’t overwhelmed stop massive restrictions. People losing homes lot more. absurd non essential shit like sports get rapid testing day healthcare workers frontline staff can't get test places downvoted? Lol Thank you. I'm anxiously awaiting return therapist maternity leave. Even telehealth! Oregon! wish piece shit would tell dead family member grieving grandmother. attitude right problem. People acknowledge 2 things. Yes, done keep virus spreading. one ever going argue that. acknowledging obesity massive correlative precondition height stupidity. fatshaming. one making fun fat people. stating facts. feelings hurt that.... need cope yourself. say are, that’s true. may say doors entering, get inside? one cares enforce it. dine masked? npr mainstream enough you? don’t deserve Bernie 😢 works New York City. Ya sick terrible heart pains..almost went rhe hospital end decided time it. took many months healing I'm finally starting feel like again. Please ppl stop underestimating virus, I'm 35 years old might serious health issues rest life, please please wear mask go indoor spaces others unless absolutely necessary. safe everyone love fellow humans feeling sad right now, things get better. Hoping comment check back hear answer 😊  Alter, für eine abgefahrene Stadt. Every country aim slow spread much possible. one think stop spread one day another. I've reluctant WF customer years heard anything increased fee. believe waive fees three linked accounts though. Checking, savings, mortgage credit card common enough. Look least. Dude even need go extreme. got ambushed NY put proper measures hospitalizations deaths low months. Even schools go online hit certain markers. 

Some neighbors doin great there's reason can't. state already limits many people allowed church fire code. falls thing. exact reason people inviting restaurants. First don’t make race . People races refusing . cops refused anything . forbidden monitor make arrests slew criminal behaviors . see United States year . Covid killed officers cause . De blaziio fool hurt city Fauci idiot connected gain-of-function research US China.  This. People insisted children couldn’t get virus, including doctors. Fact is...this new virus way taken seriously since there’s much that’s unknown it. it’s better safe sorry. know it’s frustrating, people shared mindset need work together treat actual threat, would much better position rather dragging top leading country deaths infected. Vegas slammed bunch jerks past weekend. Wonder Fauchi told them. pretty amazing single company responsible possible collapse USA. Oh humanity! Mao's entire ideology boiled peasants driving revolution. schools Spain open? I'm excusing feds all. hate Trump. search entire history.

Since I'm grown man watches cartoons I'd say made farther you.

My point federal governments fuckup, way control investigate spread virus attack state county level. 

That's huge emphasis state metrics surveillance. state centrism. complicated.  US, hunker means mentally prepare worst can’t anything You’re internet, sarcasm satire treated fact Total lockdown period time essential workers allowed continue jobs. Would probably take 2 months reduce cases almost nothing, comparitively, personally? place gong blood bath come winter Soon already replaced schools. I'll admit I'm smart enough know answers are. see lot of, well, perhaps disingenuous language lot parties days. take covid seriously wear mask everywhere. I'm also essential worker. also see lot people politicizing fear mongering honest discourse. feel stuck middle vast sea forces I'm smart enough make sense all. kinda opposite city Mangaluru, Karnataka. rumoured authorities reporting deaths - even non COVID related ones COVID deaths. Everybody said stuff Hitler. ""You're crazy. overreacting."" live fascist state, look back regret insouciance. Yeah, care kill people long get go get pizza feel better myself. post something find relevant. community. choose post things too. Ah true state/city level definitely different story, meant country-wide level, yes examples great. wasn’t problem one step fix it. Screwing reopening negates shutting down. 

It’s different someone diet. exercise burn 200 calories, eating 500 calorie burger doesn’t mean exercise didn’t job. What? can't, like, therapy way basic human need socialization togetherness. Wildfires makes sense. Maybe especially sensitive?
Regarding bacterial infection, episode American Life covered I'm lazy find it. Probably somewhere April guess. congrats negative test result. middle class succeeds, become new rich everything power prevent anyone else usurping 6 figures isn’t shit . scale wealth top need direct anger.  Well, like enforcing \~ 150 million. rest would willingly.  point generalizing America defeats purpose post. Since bright, NY whole Country, part country handled virus differently. like generalizing EU. way Sweden handled virus Norway.

If understand, suggest r/explainlikeimfive need help. I've thinking well, chance find interviews/recordings made. info public?? graduated Master's Counseling spring, got employed community agency soon licensed state, working &lt;2 months nearly 60 clients I'm expected see regularly 30-60 min sessions. clinicians 75-90. 

Demand high. Working remotely exhausting ways really confusing people settled ""#WFH vibes"" roles. average office job.

I love job. love people want work toward recovery. miss able best work, truly showing every person sit with. Right surviving, clinician person. Right we're looking around .5% mortality rate

This estimated IFR way back late February / early March. confusing Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) Case (CFR). CFR 2-5% that's data confirmed cases. Doctors epidemiologists extrapolating something 0.5% range infections since beginning. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* regions united states have. Northeast (New York Boston especially) insane first wave, locked hard lowest cases per-capita country. Seattle similar. Settle there, buckaroo! rely 401K plan can't draw yet. patient. I'm sure eventually money left. shit show. 6 figures even dent cost living decent life. (Obviously, I'm smarmy alternative depressing.) Maybe takes months virus running totally unabated reach level severe? various polls seem settle around 30 % Americans comfortable traveling. Throw many tropical destinations closed restrictive American travel, 30% lot places go warm weather winter. 

Key West busy weekends Florida drive crowd weekends. Disney parks capacity Sat &amp; Sunday last weekend. 

It boggles mind! Rural areas problem, don’t seem care all. what’s issue extending peacetime emergency? federal emergency still place. Last week 120,000 par even better EU average. even look URL posted?

Denmark tests like crazy. 

So yes, comment incorrect. wrong. experience wife works ""large Swedish furniture retailer"" US. experience happened January year. whole store (REALLY BIG SWEDISH FURNITURE STORE) got sick time. like also gotten flu shot months prior got sick well. sick weeks. one worst coughs life first time ever sickness shortness breath. remember googling worried. January even think illness named COVID-19 yet nothing coronavirus related even search engines yet googling symptoms. search results came back looking like could flu. eventually closed store late march everything else shut stayed closed month. far one store gotten Covid.....They see 10k+ people day busy day. seems unlikely one gotten sick it, yet whole store sick January. sickness never effected either two children (5yr 8 months time). course part wishful thinking, odds alone seems highly improbable literally one close 6 months they've reopened gotten sick Covid-19....either inside outside store. wife manager someone get sick she'd know. think also important mindful, get away seeing people outside lesser risk compared seeing people winter wont outside inside. Yeah, greeeeeat. 


 [restaurants 50-50 COVID-19 compliance - Sept 10, 2020

and miss

[Gov. Tim Walz extended state's peacetime emergency response corona­virus pandemic another 30 days, triggering fourth special session Minnesota Sept 9, 2020 need looking different strategies. economic mental health tolls hurting badly. 

There different strategy. We've known fight pandemics centuries. stay away people. That's it. protect vulnerable?

Everybody vulnerable. People 30's 40's dying. Well, did. Force Bezos liquidate $100 billion help pay people stay home. like 50% going go straight back him. find telling western countries consider ""civilized"" EU. Well, least American like knows countries even exist besides beloved US. whataboutism hear? 

Back The_Donald you.

Oh wait... :) Bumble beta males hangout since women make first move. I'm thinking live peanut butter sandwiches 2 weeks. mister President? Say, think could score tour White House? Fires west pushing thousands close proximity...seeing pictures places masks. hoping make parents' place leave. wait till people start eating say...... cafeteria Deaths lag cases weeks, treatments prevent death (but complication) better understood, age groups getting infected skewing younger Insults personal opinions have. data facts. I’m gonna die going outside. follow guidelines put place local government. always wear mask. live house don’t shame insult people bc scared. Finally Well shit us. countries people too.

But we're getting titanic crash day. 9/11 every 2 days. pearl harbor every 2 days.

If hindenburg rated 1 humanity loss, we're losing like 50 humanities per day. Sounds like someone skim article first we're looking around .5% mortality rate, lot early projections showing 2-5%.

0.5% mortality rate still staggeringly bad virus infectious. Furthermore, many patients left debilitating potentially lifelong complications. course won't. Facebook stands evil stupid. Taking anti-vaxxers goes mission. American here.. wait line vaccine long Fauci scientists say it’s safe effective. believe experts.

I little leery anything comes Election Day Trump pushing for. man can’t trusted. guy said hydroxychloriquine effective drug Covid, suggested UV light Clorox help Covid deliberately lied us seriousness pandemic didn’t want create “panic”. Anything recommends ain’t touching 49 1/2 foot pole. topic, checked local library days? lot expanded streaming &amp; digital checkout options. Even borrowing physical items pretty safe, long they've got proper ""book quarantine"" system set returns. facts, data, reasoning stay put inside...

Again, save lives. hard understand, unless trying understand. point. Paid stay home! could better inventivize people stay home legalized recreational weed across board. Many us would paranoid walk mailboxes much less go bar restaurant. Wow know NY whole country. new yorkers trying secede form northern confederacy now? Jeezus craziness keeps piling higher higher guys. believe corporate socialism 🤣 Yeah, America politicians actively trying get ride healthcare used millions I'm endlessly grateful therapist helped realize quarantining diligently actually verge clinical depression. I, too, fine four months crossed mark rapid mental decline. love living alone, too! really clear need human interaction thrive. That’s kinda ridiculous comparison right? Finding vaccine compared “world peace”. World peace sought literally long civilization  We're fucked. god man, temporary. Get grip. Denmark good also starting schools again. months later, Denmark worse opening night life. definitely spreads via poop. There's case china contact trace neighbors leaky plumbing. rains created puddles neighbors stepped homes. answered opinions, real solutions, insult. one listen you. Give facts, data, reasoning stay put inside I’ll so. mean Iowa lately (averaging around 1,000 cases days we’re still forced classes. It’s asinine. Oh please. vast majority young people risk serious mental health consequences continued lockdown far outweigh risk serious covid complications. can't physically healthy you're, like, fucking dead mental health consequences. Holy shit, CDC accidentally let loose shit storm Virginia. 

You’re telling respiratory illness kills 3 infects 50 days later CDC shuts lab state?! Also nice small island. 

I’ve played pandemic enough times know pathogens hard time reaching island populations airports seaports closed! Yup. There's point keeping bars closed dining rooms open. farce.

Even joke, Texas, TABC (Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission) simply rubber-stamping reclassification bars restaurants long ""serve food"" -- quotes serving food easy selling packaged food easily obtained number actual restaurants re-sold bar.
 
There's point shutting things done half-ass manner actually control spread. hurt economy. benefit? Economic hardship real lot people can't simply login VPN job home. quebecer enjoy irony :') people getting permanent mental health damage social isolation

Lol. soft group pussies generation is. Imagine difficult thing y'all endure sit home watch TV browse internet months. I’ll take chances. reason reduced social contacts reduce spread community. chances getting bad case covid injuries suggest way low stop seeing people one two years. much government paying citizens ? wondered actual support government Well obviously case okay. saying problem people genuinely hang others positive 3 cold storage trucks parked behind every hospital. what’s answer then? Shut every business down? state determined gyms could open, I’m going gym. don’t want to, don’t to. problem poorly educated, they're old. dad highly educated, almost 70 bit drinker. ""REAPER! says click NOTHING'S HAPPENING!"" school thought revolutions one group oligarchs finding cause remove existing oligarchs.

Basically, center power/wealth shifts group political power, tends revolution deposes old guard funded new guard.

For example, US revolution fomented rich colonial merchants - average colonial farmer. lo, look came top afterwards.

Power share throne. Different cost living helps. probably gov’t assistance president even jokingly mentions bleach treatment... pushed federal departments act without oversight past.. promising polls open.

Oh.. reason. Except everyone hunkered down, everyone wore mask, continue so, are. solid maybe.  often feel guilty really hate job, thankful get work home everyday. zinc magnesium. don’t want teachers die, either.

In area, lot teachers retired end last school year. Maybe putting off, lots eligible decided retire.

And at-risk age group? highly doubt volunteer substitute teach.  I'm American, want vaccine I'm worried long term affects done wrong welcome go Governor Tim Walz’s YouTube page watch various briefings discussed head Dept Health. over, state, said main issue bars family gatherings. stated keep restaurants open follow rules zero cases traced there. gyms salons. Yeah scale says it’s risky, doesn’t mean every state city it’s problem. Well shit guess stop paying There’s “new” created place outdoors local NBA arena that’s spaced outdoors “way fuck apart” eat at. Order pay via app, make non contact possible. Tables like 15-30 feet apart. seemed pretty much “human-free” except human brought food take bag. understand statement correct, need understand clusterfuck Israeli system education. separate education systems Haredim secular jews. Haredim go back Kollels 1 Be'alol, first day Alol month Jewish calendar. August 21. identified mechanism virus' spread. saddest part they're right, bad still bad many worried could be.

Right we're looking around .5% mortality rate, lot early projections showing 2-5%.

We could looking 400,000-1,000,000 dead number infections.... Two weeks flatten curve!

Just kidding waiting vaccine!

Oh don’t want go fast vaccine!

But wait it!

Two weeks.

Two weeks. mean, really hard take food go? Yeah honestly need go get one weekend, probably hit CVS. Bingo spread already locked houses. Hey France, get shit together.

- Canada   Exactly! shame Reddit policy dictates can't wish violence incompetent leaders. sure daily weaker strain reported news outlets last month one hit Europe US northeast Mar/April. Ontario calling too. Last heard Doug Ford got super pissed irresponsible idiots holding huge backyard parties massive wedding ceremonies called fines. Sweden never closed schools, happening ? state took time get hospitals ready surge we’ve never had. told us that’s for. fuck small businesses states like Florida can’t get shit together? Unless Trump loses don’t see even happening. hope loses. Good dumb comparison. Like, really dumb. delete it. You’re talking long term effects virus learned about. point absolutely stand. won’t last. People skeptical, seems many groups showing there’s mistake deadly virus is. Couples succumbing it. Multiple family members perishing close time. Police, died virus cause year. Police jobs dangerous, can’t ignore get sick, leave job recover, die return. we’ll get bunch teachers. lot potentially high risk people jobs require around whole bunch people. continued tragedy going rough. people die get lifelong chronic illness restaurant lose money? seem like staying open right right priority. everyone worked together right thing beginning, would much different better situation right now. might even like Vietnam Thailand zero low case numbers! wonderful. zero cases let kids go school without wondering family lose members semester, get haircut that's done spouse, even eat restaurant without social distancing worrying air circulation! fuck too. went coin star today sofa/car change biggest hangup... kind ridiculous people absolutely **must** eat middle pandemic?

Our society sick, COVID... seasonal flu 0.1%-0.5% don’t take measures

The seasonal flu nowhere near deadly. Americans even worse following guidelines, sure, could even worse. I’m sure point is, note diversity. countries old, sick, poor people too. know healthy multi-millionaire 50s died COVID; wealth doesn’t necessarily spare someone either. Interesting different countries different situations regard Covid containment management.  Singapore we've restaurants open (reduced capacity, spacing, group larger 5 people, moving tables, etc) since June 2 number transmissions reduced time (there are, average, 45 new cases day city/state 6 million people).   


Everyone wears masks out. wear mask restaurant food served. put mask back finished eating.  servers/staff wear masks times. I’m comparing death rate. comparisons. stated above, true death rate high thought. find $60? I'm behind rent living food stamps ""taking chances"" may expose someone else virus kill them. probably know that, selfish care. are. Slow roll. Dude never said work social life, insisted coworkers friends. He's implying social life human interaction work. Interaction strictly mean friendly socializing. cashier store, polite wave neighbor, hell, mugging, interactions. Depends come from, Europe USA last year Aussie dollars go far! Exchange rates great coming here. We're going 2nd wave, too. going worse 2nd waves countries Americans fucking selfish. possible engage good faith good sources. posting essentially scientific garbage. even barest hint scientific knowledge education, know bad are, think know exactly - propagandizing truly concerned science. 

Why else would think worked past would suddenly, magically, stop working now? get percentages right? 60% higher asymptomatic. Less 1% severe cases...my point still stands regardless ""novel virus"" COVID going anywhere. difficult get many people many opinions agree plan put action. life now. Alright hard feelings, fun hamster study obey paedophile leaders. voting better people primaries?  I've 6 months, I'm complaining once-in-a-century pandemic necessary. isn’t evidence. people protests tested positive doesn’t mean protesters testing positive higher rate gen pop.  would much worse general disregard. You’re forgetting variables like age, immunity, income disparity, int’l civilian pop, etc Ceci. People stop everywhere, far actually... Region coronavirus really present still it. Yeah, global pandemics suck. flaw 1,000 people going get treatment cough due COVID, would 10,000 people probably infected Feb. absence change human behavior clear exponential rise cases. case would led exponential rise cases 1,000s early deaths. would still samples cases able back test (which Seattle Flu Study did). So, show excess deaths, show exponential rise cases, go backtest samples find actually positive early covid cases. Go test wastewater samples Dec show they're positive COVID. Go find data ""a lot coughs"". unlimited. vaccines look like they're going early 2021. cases much much higher government still testing less Hey sure drop hospital weekend remind Covid patients mental wellbeing isn’t hindered fact 200,00 people died. Brazil? cases per million US, going conveniently ignore them? USA war telecom company called Huawei kinda losing lol. Oh hey, where'd go... room made group similarly aged people similarly healthy condition, no. real world, 200 includes Grandpa Last-Legs Morbidly Obese Matt, even pause door. Obesity isn’t contagious. yes, get point banning manual driving, that’s great point. transport isn’t leisure automated. 

The dismissal preventable contagious death forms death exist severely dim. grandma said would expect businesses close protect her. She’s 85. terribly sad people died cannot disregard people’s livelihoods. lockdown kills jobs. makes sense person two years less live stay isolated rest lives order die covid. Yet almost 2 million Americans since spread started, case. heard virus automatically figured would 2-5 years modifications, including mask wearing researchers tried find vaccine figured multiple approaches including therapeutics would pursued. public discussion point still whether masks helped not. Sometimes look situation come estimate.

22nd century. Humanity won’t make far. France either 2, 3 4 depending live. question common cold. could, theoretically, make cold extinct. practically speaking, won't. There's always vector. can't keep many people isolated long. attempt would would reduce contagion. that's good economic cost huge action would staggering. Yeah, there's much understood coronavirus hard get bead expect. 

That said, I'm optimistic, cautiously so....I kind want keep expectations grounded...less likely become let disappointed course events. 

 Interesting article. Thanks.  sure moron can’t divide difference eating death choice infected deadly virus dumb fuck thought good time go Walmart sneeze produce.

There goddamn solution virus, one wants get one board think American entitled world class idiot. got solutions eliminating traffic accidents shit bud? countries second waves nothing stop vaccine. Even lockdown.  keep everyone 65 years home 1 months and
let rest get virus ?
Do people 65 want act responsible ? Thank Congress that. US ability whether storm. coffers closed.  getting flu shot nearby pharmacy. make appointment advance, there's waiting go middle day weekday, there's barely ever anyone there. Listen saying... want increase risk spreading deadly disease sake ""normalcy"". ""low"" mean null - means least people **die**.

When Americans become fragile little buttercups? Nobody needs eat restaurant... Get take out, tip well, eat home. Arrested wtf kidding me? childish pride defending US say anything nationality? Wow God lack critical thinking here. Truly, iq lower age. literally admitted right terms lockdown effectiveness US vs civilized western countries. looks like US less cases now??? Hm wonder recently happened absolute joke FDA CDC? Huh? Fudging numbers testing asymptomatic people principle surely nothing right? fact death rate still regularly breaching thousands despite cases ""apparently"" falling means nothing right? God Americans hold ""best country"" world attitude end. funny tragic sad. VACCINE.

How mention word without feeling like moron comparing flu? DeSantis allow restaurant dining rooms reopen capacity restriction early May, followed **bars early June**. 

and closed bars late June state began see resurgence infections.

So they'll probably need close bars mid October. actual proposal? going back normal isn’t strategy. everyone vulnerable. risk death young health risks well 0.1%. I’ll take chances. 100k day incoming. India practically driving daily increase numbers. India’s State Maharashtra also hit 1M cases knowledge first single region within country hit 1M cases. Can't get views bait. Media tiring ""shush, Mr. Fauci. People might panic, keep dl man."" think going feel find direct cause someone's death health issues keep taking 100% seriously? People gathering together refusing think wider well-being virus still grinding us down.

Most people probably suffering kind mental problems right now. society experiencing collective trauma. think people choice go line fire every damn day serve heal others whose lives cut short made harder people's universes expand beyond boundaries heads.

Edit: word  never got slip got contacts office. box prescription apparently that’s enough, need verify wrote it. Convenient leave rest exact sentence. anecdotal indicative SWEEPING general disregard. Yeah. “Some”. I’ve 6 months. Doesn’t matter.

Unless everyone gets board, doesn’t work. Maybe it’s strategy that’s flawed, works fabulously every country world. Maybe it’s morons aren’t part “some” problem. Many Christians quietly complying health ordinances months now. feel ""overblown"" ""attack liberty"" I'd encourage consider two points:

1. simply grossly wrong understanding science. John MacArthur himself, gifted Bible teacher way medical expert, demonstrated ignorance falling social media ""the CDC finally admitted 6% deaths listed Covid actually Covid"" nonsense. promoted concept... pulpit great chagrin large number us. anyone unfamiliar absurd notion, revolves around fact 6% Covid deaths comorbidities. MEAN 6 100 people got Covid died Covid! means CSI team investigating sudden new mass murder spree town able find murder weapon 94 crime scenes was, despite best efforts, unable find exact murder weapon 6 100 times! Probably overwhelmed point body count. Anyone pushes 6% nonsense embarrassing clearly lack understanding difference comorbidity pre-existing condition. Covid often takes advantage previous weakness like diabetes, also \*causes\* new ones like pneumonia. Please, Christian, STOP PUSHING 6% ARGUMENT. embarrassing rest us.
2. Far worse, even adamant wearing masks actually correct science (and not) bigger problem flat refusal meet outdoors wear masks profoundly... unloving... towards outside church honestly despair prospects sharing Gospel many people long long time. say ""I put piece cloth face duration church service simply want to"" really wonder earth could possibly imagine Jesus Christ making statement? see Jesus insisting ""rights"" way? neighbors family members DIED want invite church? church told ""we care enough neighbors inconvenienced MASK hour"" crisis? yes, get it, mind crisis. Fine, again, let's pretend right hoax. (You right, hoax, let's roll minute.) WHAT? absolutely real people neighborhood outside church! told love enough cover mouth hour, want tell Lord loved enough give life them?

&amp;#x200B;

The name God blasphemed among Gentiles you. Romans 2:24 lot like managing morale war. time big offensive everyone supports enemy ropes. Covid chugging along tired fighting it, doubt country would listen government told lock again. People stopped caring. 



My sourcing work hotel that's sold every weekend months now. plauge rats love here. yup...Villages india even proper health infrastructure ,so covid19 deaths happening getting counted poor testing facility. literally test (even severed symptoms) , reason deaths non-covid. really pretty obvious. one countries effective contact tracing testing program. Probably large part Merkel scientist born middle class family got job via sheer competence rather nepotistic silver spoon politicians leading everything countries.

And obviously large healthcare system helps, plenty countries large healthcare systems getting rocked covid, that. Give month. another shut down. risking kids ? Ottawa opened school week already 600 cases... Source? ""There's point shutting things done half-ass manner actually control spread.""

I understand saying, absolutely point. continuum activities unique risk benefit. two activities equal risk mean shut time. Even things equal risk / benefit profiles, prohibiting one better none contributes lower R0. agree you, I’d like point *in theory*, one defining differences conservatism liberalism, traditional conservatives believe government isn’t responsible helping us. 

... obviously, modern US conservatives nothing like text book example above. Right, it’s largely unpreventable. people online pretend idea what’s going CDC admits 50mil Americans could already infected?

And int’l flights stopped. I’m talking average US person’s perspective, mine, also experienced airport shutting entirely. 

What false comment? infection rate bad. direct correlation public’s respect quarantine. all. Btw — basis equal evidence. Evidence weighed variables like immunity, age, location, healthcare, etc Many friends dinners elderly parents people drinks time now. decided them. infuriating depressing. seen another human person outside wife guy brings groceries yo car curbside pickup months. feel like extra careful since many anymore. fixation preventing ""panic"". Fucking what?

You take unsubstantiated claims kindly place ass.

You THINK going suicides due economic downturn KNOW FACT 200,000 people already dead disease.

Why gods green earth worried possibility something rather actual threat actually killing people?

You guys manage blow fucking mind every day. country imbeciles selfishly care well nobody else. certainly wasn’t guy Japan early diagnosed COVID went bars purposefully infect people there? American thing selfish instead human thing. Quit unnecessary generalization. Thats problem, even though make enough every month, paper checks. get long term effects

You know novel virus right. don’t long term data. Data shows lingering impact. honest discourse everyone political agenda. hope ends election regardless wins. Bingo. sign poor decision making got point sitting indoors restaurant unmasked patrons eating middle pandemic. Everyone patron restaurant made poor decision. making poor decisions there, making poor decisions elsewhere giving higher chance get exposed point. USA mouth spews propaganda year around. Yeah, except I've yet see reasonable cases area. Nearly packing tables in, often even closer 6 feet apart, well ventilated outside area. indoors really make SHTF. 

Someone posted, another sub, worried caught outside windy day woman, 25 feet away, coughed. OP wearing mask well.... 

I like: No. breeze like cat 5 hurricane virus distance disperses pretty much completely instantaneously. 

The problem indoors... Bloody thing tends linger. think active socialization group pandemic like one smart? one’s saying cool, fun. sucks, matter slice it. need react intelligently it. throwing hands air saying “welp tried” isn’t intelligent. crazy thing Chinese jail safer place US school today. NTD1k day, however many days quarantining. Comes NT30k month, roughly starting wage college grad. Herd immunity contextual. people practice social distancing, threshold herd immunity lower. reason “stay course” isn’t working ONE GOT FUCKING COURSE BEGIN WITH.

Why fuck always economy that’s mentioned near 200,000 deaths country alone? they’re strangers don’t know them? grandma die matter?

We don’t need different strategy, need actually first one, one actually works. basis Americans anything different countries

You mean than: 

* people proclaimed virus hoax 
* [A giant motorcycle researchers believe seeded thousands cases 
* [Literal protests wearing masks 
* [Packed pools 
* [A government repeatedly said virus would go 
 
You disingenuous attitude put us mess.  frightening scary? It’s sad. That’s like saying I’m frightened fires America live side planet.

Why would frightened morbidly obesity caused death Corona I’m morbidly obese know obesity one biggest predictors death. Ill definitely concede say articles response receive clicks. Hell disaster/shocking circumstance seems pull related stories orbit. Sweden might right strategy. one awhile. Yeah lol wtf? Pretty sure every open college country absolutely exploding cases already. clear point transmission. 👏 👏 👏 exactly 👏 👏 argument 👏 city also takes break 9 pm establishments serve alcohol, close 9 Covid come play. know leading cause death first year life SIDS, primarily caused suffocation. reason infants young toddlers made wear face coverings. cannot relied upon move mask trouble breathing. 


This sub mistake. else say? role advisory advice ignored. You’ve got credit honesty says gonna rough. Delayed luggage kept socks underwear days road warrior. Get site bag delayed? hit local store another pack socks underwear, credit card insurance's dime. make valid points, possible OVERSTATE risk well. LIE people overstate risk, end people digging heels in, resisting. So, asking friend - think curbside take-out delivery dangerous? fuck talking Nope don’t know death rate look like winter. Also Spanish Flu killed majority people one bad month, relatively mild first wave. sure, place toxic. leave weeks come check it’s type articles responses.   

They love type false articles!!

Edit: forgot upvote you! 👍 tell people go work. talking things people optional - going restaurants, going bars, socializing people outside immediate household bubble, anything really necessary. go stores unless really need to. Make trips possible outside home. start wrapping head around fact holiday gatherings going happen Zoom. 

It possible everyone stay home, possible, everyone everything do, avoid catastrophic fall winter. Eh, carryon also bit pain, especially larger person clothes take space. (I'm 6'2"", 230lbs... can't really fit week's worth clothes toiletries (legal) carryon bag, one pet peeves people try bring oversized carryons onboard. Plus, half time I'm carrying tools, checked.

That said, real key status airline, bags get priority handling. airports, time get belt, bags waiting me. negligence killed probably quarter million people. US reacted pandemic sensible way, many people would still alive. Wish professors US would this.... girlfriend pays $1000 month apartment campus state go class one day every week school makes class mandatory every week... could home pay rent ONE CLASS absolutely person?

&amp;#x200B;

Having apartment means rent $1000, utilities $80, parking $100, internet 50$ month fucking 100% online. Instead 99% online. ridiculous. could apartment different state without costs, except ONE mandatory person class. actually adds spread virus classmates go home weeks come back one class.

&amp;#x200B;

How fucking greedy stupid colleges be?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: professors office hours... sounds like frustrated well administration likely working home keeps going understanding toll financially mentally teachers students. told student went ask question one class professor freaked said get away me, 6 ft. guess anything justify 50,000 year tuition right?? await paper showing 260K new cases due Tour... Oh shit somebody seems like got called out! bullshit. fact pretending worth full price joke.

Also, get real graduation next Summer going lose it. ""Some people went hospital really sick""

Wow! Glad study tell us that. Clever doesn’t cover bullshit. feel like read article every day week. depends overall strategy. 

Countries like China, New Zealand etc.. went ""do once, right"" approach, strive 0 cases, basically banned foreign travel case case approval, strict containment foreign travelers, super proactive strict contact tracing+area lockdown stray cases discovered. 

Countries like USA, Israel, Japan, Europe etc... went ""shutdown slow down"" approach, know already past point return strive 0 cases, shutdown needed, slow spread. shutdown super strict, example currently USA impose nearly restriction foreign travelers, ""14 day home quarantine"", monitored checked. hoping vaccine come fast enough end ""perpetual shutdown loop"". sample size really small draw true conclusions. many infections able better. Yeah kind wild actually one people. 2001 worst year life. Even 2020 matched it, certainly putting effort. Don’t studies suggest around 70% less likely catch virus taking vitamin D? Doesn’t fit first definition better second? Genuinely curious. almost like media picks every non peer reviewed preprint publication sensationalizes unverified results. That’s racist. focus keeping families together. That’s way important privileged people attending school think bc part says ""healthy 28 year olds nothing worry about"" stupid. 

Healthy people choose pre existing conditions like asthma, nothing worry about? perfectly healthy without pre existing conditions, gets covid low lung capacity knows long? government get money stop economy long?  print it/add debt like do?  virus fake. Spread disinformation lies elsewhere Could we? Sure. *Would* we? think so. people would willing hunker leaders provided adequate financial assistance directed (and that's huge 'if' many leaders likely won't) virus-is-a-hoax crowd diminished much, many cases louder aggressive ever. We're pretty much waiting vaccine point. Absolutely. table since beginning. never even attempted true lockdown. FORCED people stay houses 2 weeks straight pain prosecution smallest strongly-enforced minimum like hospital employees firefighters shit allowed outside, cases would drop cliff. There's question. 

There question, though, ultimate value would be. point clear virus really going ""stopped"" vaccine available, see even best-managed counties still serous struggles keeping level they've established. going truly ""gone"" whole world vaccinated. even probably eradicated long time, ever. nagging question probably makes difficult leaders take decisive action. worries, guess discussion went well past originally said lol. What’s point? He/she pointing grown-ups pay bills. Or, Canadian, Nexus gets access Global Entry well (and TSA PreCheck). understanding outdoor different indoor? Let explain, indoor inside building. That’s place four walls roof. 

How spreads indoors versus outdoors well known understood point. You’re willfully ignorant try make dumb political point. Russians Muslims? hesitant answer truthfully knew would well received TBH

Just situation. May work everyone. looking anyone...take need it. got Covid attest symptoms legit. 🤣 “Multiple doctors keep telling I’m anxiety attacks *know* it’s covid!” pay attention Reddit, would think age 60. 5 listed, youngest 28, oldest 62. one 30s, 40's, 50's. 17 people died Covid-19 today within five mile radius me.

I left house except food medicine since second week March, won't, number deaths reaches zero stays several weeks.

I know people doing, certainly made high priority ending pandemic. Colds predominantly caused Rhinoviruses. Coronaviruses, several, account \~20% common cold infections. bit worry hand think danger high. Recall 300 super long term asymptomatic carriers found Wuhan full population test. None samples produced viable new virus incubation experiments.

This guy could another case, given length time involved.

Nevertheless noticed today noticeable jump number people medical observation, probably case they're treating seriously. even talking about? testing two months ago (or even April). positivity rate even lower, colleges opening weeks ago haven’t even affected daily case numbers. must hate science Cfr ifr. Cfr useless statistic. told great job Europeans compared US?  this? 

What's real story?  Osterholm narrative, basically soon lockdown lifts pandemic comes back vaccine somewhere half us get infected?  Maybe need hope warp speed thing comes something usable reasonable risk. course agree point, however strong lockdown orders June, kept numbers pretty low, considering 1.3bln people there- movement severely curtailed, things looked like going well, however June, like US, getting worse due reopening.

I’d hazard rural areas probably less affected villages (like China lot Africa) fairly insular, little interaction beyond trade- lack cars, distance etc probably cause rather lack testing.

My point I’d expect countries employ sort quarentine rules India would Mexico, Brazil US. That's actually fast peer review journals Maybe get job... /s Thanks explaining. understand logic behind this. media, political reasons. makes measure sound like deliberate attempt Trump administration infect Covid many Americans possible. really America ending measure completely ineffective getting likely everyday virus originated US China. it. Haredi give shit. Social distancing gets way minyans. Don’t mind meteoric increase cases SD neighboring states week event, that’s coincidence. /s

The way really answer question get accurate count proper contact tracing. I've traveled 4x internationally since started, unless they're passive remote monitoring, never temperature screened airport. covid form fill airline gave plane, pen got agent ask it.

So announcement amounts absolutely material change. simple Google search states Subs contract workers. fact teachers benefits provided employer leads believe fact 1099 contract laborers. Thanks knowledge. UK protect Greece. big difference intentional stupid trying impossible. believe DeSantis secretly hates people enjoys idea suffering. make fine demon goes Hell. $$$ always highest priority. Yea still averaging 1000 cases day. 1000 fucking cases. vast majority countries. It’s r/coronavirus, expect. want go school, gym, anyplace fun? Wow you’re piece shit. I’m sure canceling Thanksgiving going go *VERY WELL* population Except China never tried cover anything up, transparent international experts day one even streamed building 3 hospitals 10 days social media. never said wanted it. Lol, so, really argument? virus around long enough us verifiablely document long term damage, that's technically impossible? So, point exactly? evidence far suggests definitely possible, suggests cautious approach treats possibility know more. ""Complete safety"" goal posts moved now? original goal buy time overwhelm hospitals whole topic used political bludgeon authoritarians got taste power abuse name complete safety. keep testing positive delay schools opening indefinitely? asymptomatic case Nanjing bit schools reopening. take poor begin eating rich?

Now mention it, feeling bit peckish... everyone afford expensive ass delivery services difference indoor social gathering indoor school office? virus care. 15 people... pretty soon it’ll zero herd immunity strategists say now? really does. fav. “Sand won’t save That's fast. Hate say timeline matches death household (but 5 think instead 3) - declines someone FAST. knew february also getting second time increases chances heart attack 50 percent mah pitom? ze article b'ivrit!! got massively downvoted last time posted this, but...

My wife Switzerland got sick last week October. say Switzerland, saying China, Chinese tourists place holiday week. Everything packed.

Both wife flu shots (as always do), well pneumonia shots.

We went doctor, tests done. flu, ""some virus identify"". symptoms similar COVID, really knocked us asses.

Now, know make this. Flu shots 100% effective, us still get flu, get bad, test negative seems unlikely. thought COVID around back last week October seems unlikely. 

Maybe something else going around?

I'm looking forward getting antibody tests we've strict lockdown since February. closed elections then. coincidence. would heart stopping. dad trip NYC planned would've air time got postponed weeks beforehand. can't imagine fear had. worry America, one wants travel country anyway. true Lol UV lights family bathroom come foil hats extra? mean sub supports specific narrative? could be?  nearly much long Trump admission has. media focused particular doctor photos sick, making look like mistreated CPC.  so.. anybody wanna pay plane ticket outta here? provide peer reviewed research case? not, please miss emotional, uninformed bs. What?! Impossible! tHeR FrEeDoM?! someone missed ""at"" one sentence.

journalism dead, everybody friend back May hospital week small amount inhaled smoke car office made unable breathe trip ambulance. lungs recovered I'd curious know percentage dead hospitalized anti maskers. it’s sign leader‘s course fanclub, claiming it’s fake refusing wear mask Everyone under-counting, difficult know under-counting more. go confirmed numbers deaths. Unlike March/April European countries reporting 10% case fatality rates, now, seem getting 1% less. Numbers better everywhere due availability mass testing.  basti short austria, made party back opening borders germany breaking every social distancing rule came ""the mask ruin hair infavorable looks"".

2nd somewhat lockdown incoming austria. Mr Orban hungary already closed borders austria, germany might follow soon (or least limit again) go credit union aren’t member group? Like, I’m group credit union. mean go River Boat Captain Credit Union open account? comes land under, women glow men plunder Yes, entirely. Follow money trail. it’s anything like show, it’s episode deaths.  mean mean judging different ends wave. whole, america lower deaths per capita many european countries. feel like wouldn’t bullshit situation joke administration listened FUCKING SCIENTISTS. 

I blame ant-maskers, they’re breed idiot. Trump enabled every ignorant person America. *SARS-CoV-2 high quality advice. Canadian, borders pretty fucking important. hope stays shut long time, frankly... neighbours seem lost collective shit. ecause rich good deflecting blame

no, truth ~97% people inherent followers, 40% people closer iq chimp people work for. cold hard facts, know comforting. South Korea Japan  Americas testing probably better though. Darling, ""upper class"" ""1 percent"" sometimes refer us - call great culling. many bottom needed way thin herd. Remember eat first!

 Best luck! think it’s likely all, everyone party positive? think that’s bullshit moron threw party said? u ok. tracker 1point3acres Maharashtra 967,000 cases growing 20,000 per day. two days time, Maharashtra first sub-national entity reach 1 million cases. Sao Paulo state second. 874,000 cases growing less 10,000 per day. California may third get eventually. yea swedes travelled lot. part reason huge outbreak begin with. Especially considering vacation earlier neighbors spring, started locking spring travel began. wonder many “essential” employees succumbed COVID? didn’t Home Depot employee make Reddit? hell makes teachers special? Deputy research director state-run Gamaleya institute Denis Logunov, study’s lead author, hit back suggestions data could falsified. confirmed Thursday original data well “full clinical protocol” Lancet’s editorial office. stay building long time, exposure builds up. day office, two hours restaurant significant risks lie. Although apparent infection rate householders suggests it’s far done deal even somewhere long time. worse year social contact, leads lifelong mental/ptsd issues. Vote. make sure everyone know votes. matter what. important election lifetime. Take action. hope available country. I’m arguing America good handled virus properly.

My point it’s uniquely American problem people around world suffering inept government civilian response pandemic e.g. France. before, now. probably reasons california. Deaths low early on, rose time went on. much hardest hit places. probably younger healthier people getting it, also maybe masks usage lowers viral load people spread it, making less deadly. Better treatments protocols prob make difference too. Well makes sense numbers India correct, let's consider got point. point french lockdowns cases back up.

Delaying inevitable bringing misery destruction plain stupid among would willing take Russian Vaccine soon available? live close border hate go state.   happened much schools opened (which recent) Well, Spain's population 46 million, India's population 1.38 billion. Spain getting 10,000 cases day equivalent India getting 300,000 cases day. Worse, Spain Western European countries already 600 deaths per million people first wave. India 55 deaths per million people far. saying Covid serious India, different order magnitude. India large numbers mainly population. Adjusted population, Western Europe, USA Latin America 10 times worse. getting utterly pathetic now, world suffering mass pshcycotic episode mass hysteria One hundred years now, children asking greet touching elbows. surely giant degrees difference even US. Difference obviously rushed govt vs everyone, including Fauci coming saying good.

And btw, Moderna/Pfizer mostly trials US that's they'll get approval first, do. opening general. inevitable dont closed borders, really high mask usage social distancing.

Lockdowns delayed inevitable. Curve flattens, end restrictions.

Curve flattens, end lockdowns. Vaccine gets here, end restrictions. That's always been. cake lie. haven’t seen friends since March go twice week groceries. I’m starting feel like I’m crazy I’m one still taking seriously... Mass death event... natural causes least. winning Except vast majority people won’t pay government back. don’t want straddle people debt. Think you’re saying second. Let’s say gave everyone 15k hunker down. know long would take minimum wage worker pay back? I’ll tell long, never. can’t sign people debt. 


They bailed banks auto manufacturers cause knew pay back. People seem leave part out. Also companies would created massive unemployment vanished supply chain.  r/unexpectedlotr Even middle class shrinks much, change real problem: rich people know best way stop world eating rich attacking divide people smaller smaller groups tell ""no, no, really want give this, let us"". Then, realize poor keep fighting furious people group they'd gladly let hurt long promise hurt group too.

Hence real catch-22 causes problem: people willing rise rich ones dedicated identity politics intersectional politics fall right rich's trap. Less 7 billion go Grass greener really think it’s fair say rough everyone ways. Hell, parents kids home right now... sounds insane. think parents work outside homes kids insane.

For people solo... think comes chance quickly opt out. can’t escape grandpa week hours. you’re playing rules fully live alone never casual face face chat home without mask, hugs, high fives... six months going year.

Then again, put house relatives six months I’d rather talk walls. ya, nothing seems good. another vacation coming up, make 200 Grand year can't send measly 1200 dollars twice worst crisis we've since WW2. easy popping vitamin pill me, perhaps iodine drops vitamin C. it. ""Florida Man"" takes whole new meaning. use groups. facebook cancer. dont need updated. trust me, yoi get info want share like marketing. make group, ask information, present, closer. stole Clinton's emails leaked wiki leaks. Even Russia, China, Iran trying subvert election proving points attack connected politics candidates.

I dunno left would defend Russia unless sympathetic communist past. Thank right thing. God bless union odds exceedingly unlikely and, anything, popped early likely _higher_ 1/15K.

Anyway - that's event confirmed caused vaccine. started going much schools opening poor start political party called Eat Rich policy change 100% tax 20M assets, even need violence work. 

But apparently, able organize that, means either people want elections fraudulent. real need google local food bank. give box food. What's amazing much failure government, failure society fundamental levels.

A bunch extended family decided family reunion alaska couple months ago, fully aware virus control. got covid. pointed cousin selfishness may caused strangers get covid, comprehend criticism. didnt understand would matter. They're family, care get sick?

This kind Ayn Rand style individualism luxury middle class people see class marker, ideological indicator upward mobility. genuine crisis, especially pandemic, CANT AFFORD luxury. literally leads mass death, always lie. unnatural, cripples society's ability withstand even minor challenges.

What need solidarity, community organization, rejection sociopathic ideology we've drowning in. ideology completely obliterated almost every community country, atomized us, made us behave shockingly selfish ways. many Americans, concept ""sacrifice community"" seen way taken advantage of, sign weakness.

We created society isolated atoms, wonder atoms refuse work concert. We're never going make progress country, learn value human life own. death rate shockingly continues go it’s less even half percent,

The fuck talking about? case fatality rate US 3-6%, half percent. 13% people 65. it’s even easy transmit originally thought.

Seriously, getting it’s really hard keeps seeming like virus isn’t even bad thought was.

It’s currently leading cause death US. Why? He’s earned money company Amazon done incredible job helping bring resources / supplies people staying home. Sure money knows with, it’s his. ask liquidate 30% worth give out? vaccinate, yes. See, that's problem polls. mean sh*t. That's believe polls tell Biden win sure. Agreed. good website statistic? Lmao don’t (at least Paris) salute meter away. 
I la bise close Friends family  Blocking second stimulus. 30 day vacation course. “You wanna see real speed?” Well know now. change cycle then?

The whole point knowing history repeat needlessly. Otherwise learning appear smarter others. Let's save blame poor people.

I grew poor, sucked, biggest fear lack healthcare. low quality education getting. bank fees. I'm sure bothered parents little too, biggest, immediate concern was....

Other poor people.

It poor people smashed window steal dad's car radio. poor people bother teach kids kick ass, could. poor people stole new Casio watch Grandmother gave me, convinced never show owned anything nice ever again.

Everytime people talk low income housing, I'm sorry, lived there. awful. family six two bedroom apartment, poor people around us. Drugs, violence, anti-social behavior, parties 4am Tuesday night, police complex weekly deal another domestic abuse call.

We taking violence powers be. taking people stealing need food. 

You buy house south side Chicago cheap. Even large, newly renovated house, cheap. know 99% us won't?

We know living would awful people already live there.

Poor people happy attack destroy poor people virtually direct benefit themselves. attack destroy communities too, complain rich people ruin everything.

That might true, poor people sure help depends who's getting Covid. young people, death rate 0.1%. far, seems Europe's second wave due holidaymakers young people. skeptical 10,000 new cases day Spain France without big outbreak eventually finding way vulnerable populations. Well *we* know that... Can't wait job get even harder ups long government isn’t making possible us hunker don’t know expects. everyone hunkers quarantines working class people laid means pay rent, buy food, etc. without another stimulus none helps. 

I’m fine quarantining long don’t help rent food payments I’m going mask supporting local businesses I’m glad others job make paying bills possible. Indian tribes well, let’s follow model. Good idea What? mean Biden takes magically over? high what? ... oh wait.  



/s yea America always way. get vaccine so... Still works Positivity rate steadily increasing, 5.4 % (although get thata might joked, Germany gets 1.4k per day &lt;1 % positivity 20 mio people, France's situation scary) got covid extremely careful, symptoms weren’t terrible(I’m 26). boyfriend basically symptoms 29. Two coworkers got moderate symptoms they’re 35+. friends really close friend died covid ONE week, 27....Super healthy newly graduated MD. fact matter is, don’t know WHO’s going get worst it. THATS what’s scary. thing could think sick “am going die tomorrow? Next week?” It’s exhausting. 
At point it’s really individual, hate fact elderly parents could randomly get covid someone supermarket. also don’t want suffer runs it’s course.
I agree you’re saying, believe taking precautions + going life. I’m still worried small percentage though! think things would different people cared others anything. Yes. think also politicians took seriously. saw badly going Italy became concerned. point kill virus mitigate infections.

Jesus C. many times repeat this......... Half measures half effective. people give fuck probably give way people since they're rich health care they'll fine. However, people luxury going get hit hardest we'll see stock portfolios doing. Georgia releasing state level hospitalization censoring state site linked relies on. Try again. Comeon man us. general backwardness ignorance among Indians killing us. Even people extended family understand severity it. one could stopped India, told father (my parents comorbidities) call February inevitable, sooner later gonna reach doorstep prepared. say confidence, PREPARED SCARED DEATH virus. wish everyone was, shit gone far way probably. Thanks, Nance.  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Nothing?

Spain 60 deaths per day. (Rolling 7 day average).

Italy UK small, noticeable amounts.  Probably others, too, good place get unified data ""Western Europe."" agenda super transparent negative response government handled initially. people (citizens) came together help government. basically good credit start getting SBA loan. Red Cross helped us lot didn’t qualify SBA lost home. also get FEMA lot people did, wasn’t enough keep home. Japanese right along. must bow. I'm saying I'd like sense proportionally response. like ignoring every problem world face coronavirus. shutdown response estimated put hundreds millions hunger, example, expect huge numbers starvation deaths. Yes. like comments saying posts like this, warn us virus wants people work, schools clusterfuck, people gradually getting sick restrictions, businesses run cliff...there needs least sustainable solution policy. else man screaming top mountain. strategy? saw 10 cops block street Montreal last week incident, 2 wearing masks. BLM protests barely remember pictures cops masks all. honestly think even care much. 

To get ticket wearing mask seems like particularly dumb it.  death numbers Nebraska 8 months pretty much statistically insignificant. guess South Korea New Zealand aren’t countries. 🤷🏼‍♂️  Good know they’re okay financially fucking students economic destruction goal this, never virus. got conned. thing blame Russia disbanding USSR. neoliberal ghouls thought end history whatever, incentive provide us anything. need communist superpower compete again. China doesn’t count, they’re capitalist now.   Oh, talking things could easily make flu deadly? cheek cheek. every place I've ever worked gone. get it. People keep going I’m pushing back masks all. camped summer several weekends

I mean think people right would kill that. wife home since March newborn. 


So thing left world exciting enough lose mind go vacation Mexico? trying judge, really, point may need re-assess privilege.

""How gambling options make downplaying deadly virus good?"" 
never said that, said hard knew coming started act accordingly paid (+400%/not options thats dumb/risky).
Optimism good ended hurting/extending pain like Spain really gloat much, testing regime pitiful compared US'. entire sub fear mongerers practiced critical thinking enough see really virus anymore. Okay thinking two steps ahead here.

If tell people buy masks unprepared market, literally everyone would hoovered masks like soap toilet paper. secure personal stash, others try profiteer.

If happened medical professionals PPE working, would significantly higher risk work environment contracting dying exposure COVID. 

More risk healthcare means less healthcare everyone, would make pandemic unstable already time still learning best practices adapting treatment businesses it.

More people would died everyone went hoard supply. guidance self-isolate also mitigate spread anyways. know want look ends justify means perspective, literally commercial healthcare triage national level. Sure. It’s choice. pointing Brexit reason rather nonsensical, pointing out. middle schools! (college, fancy accents, middle school France) think hold whoever made allowed virus propagate responsible? well botched response? well destroyed small businesses like (mine too) riots encouraged media? less contagious. popular misunderstanding.

Edit: walk back language bit. yet know contagious. popular misunderstanding I'm referring (and got carried away with) R0 measure contagious agent is. Pedantry means coming years below. No, haven't. stay shelter people volunteering help country. giving money, housing, supplies food water. Also greyhound busses people go move different states people inviting families move homes. Churches opened doors house families too. Even Cuba trying send us money government refused it. sad, I'm sure could prevent them. 

That mean change course provenly effective way contain spread deadly pathogen.  aryans better everyone else. dont get it? One feels matter time deaths catch Spain France posting case numbers like every day. far, deaths associated second wave low, explained people getting young, much testing ever. even new cases young people, still hard fathom many cases without eventually finding way vulnerable populations. Spain, low fertility rate \~1.2-1.3, also one oldest populations world. 213? Geez I’d thrilled daily counts “low” Michigan. 

Now universities across country reporting cases per day entire Canadian provinces... cv19 0% mortality rate, aids like 30-60% days. people get covid ""asymptomatic"". even notice it. comparable. 

We also lie aids. CLEAR alternate cause death. covid pass away included category... Dr. Ezike explains mean virus caused death **BUT someone test positive covid dying classified coronavirus died CLEAR alternate cause covid time still listed covid death...

We'll ""save"" thousands deaths covid simply honest cause death. wonder many coroners stepping forward disputing official numbers like him... Ya that’s nice pre existing conditions make covid deadly things like asthma diabetes pretty common pedestrian things people manage live fully normal lives well, guess find we? isn't. Flatten curve means maintaining effective reproduction rate (Rt) ~1.0. means case load constant, ie curve shutdowns lowered Rt far 1 means reduce total case count.


lol again, literally flattening curve means. FLAT CURVE, flattening prepared pandemic. shutdowns supposed buy time get ready bring cases low possible try adequate PPE, testing, etc.


We still never properly addressed first wave either. Everything means two things now. Meaning comment means 4. Wait, 8. 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc See bars! Lol point made mechanic leading could imply less accidents based interpretation OP's reasoning.

That’s it’s illogical immature every single comment thread sub consist almost exclusively bashing America response there’s countless nations also terrible. never forget laying hospital bed heart rate 288, nurses shoving largest IV needle arm doctor stood saying ""this worst thing ever feel life,"" feeling ice pumping veins chemically restarted heart.

this kills plans fans back next month tho Bernie lost primaries. guys elitists refuse listen people different opinions. everyone wears masks even 50% effective, combined effect two properly masked individuals 75% reduction transmission virus, less severe cases people get infected lower volume virus particles mask wearer exposed to. simplest math. But, math sidelined impassioned screeds governors refuse ""open states"". 

We could starve virus hosts really wanted to. Instead, horror shows like 5,000 person Trump rally state yesterday, damn aircraft hanger, almost entirely maskless.

Nope. I'm good. Friday. 

I seeing kind child would post this.

Apparently insecure one. 

Enjoy hating world. must beautiful little bubble protected in. I'm sure bad sounds first blush. Social distancing guidelines still enforced rest park lines ride, longer keeping empty row groups guests ride. Strangers still seated next row.

Due length given ride (in terms time), exposure window small masks still required. dangerous working office might within 6' coworker two minutes time. ventilation much better (being outdoors).

In short, nothing see here, really. That’s listen scientists. countries go along it, (thanks Trump pulling obviously first line this) still getting it. I'll ignore disparaging comments make one last attempt. 

If goal stop spread Covid, science theoretically tell best way it. 

If goal adopt strategy that's best society whole, science cannot give answer, DEPENDS THINK BEST (a value judgment). 

Sheesh, pretty elementary. beginning look like wilfully obtuse. I'll give benefit doubt, though.  What? incentive would Indian government falsify vaccine results? opposed Chinese government, known authoritarian regime virus started first place. know India medical powerhouse? Yeah, never self-diagnose. See doctor. could number different things wrong. President can't order governors much without military control country. 

Do REALLY want that? Yeah, may vaccine all. There's reasonable chance he/she control group.  singing shower then?

The vast majority people expected curve came down. open shit up. It’s hard. goalposts shift, again. 

The virus isn’t disappearing, aim slow (not stop) spread stop hospitals overwhelmed. Job done, open up.

And lockdown/mask things nothing beyond supposed to. Lockdowns stopped hospitals overwhelmed, kept going it’s pointless yes nothing. exactly aim? 

Masks work begin reopening stop too-aggressive spike high risk areas — people wearing masks outside going walk. Useless. 

And NYC, people can’t go back work, restaurants aren’t open schools basically shut. We’re still locked down. minor little gestures count “reopening” guess that’s occasional “Karen grocery store” video online counts mass non-compliance.

We repeatedly lied I’m stunned people like go it. 100% people mask forcibly glued face you’d probably go along “oh wait vaccine” shift goalposts they’re already gearing for. think America better job countries? Maybe happening people interpreting “flattening” “plateauing”. UK Birmingham surrounding areas Reported like nurses healthcare workers, protesting.

NEVER eliminate Covid-19 lock downs. NEVER point lock down. lock figure going on. never live world without Covid-19. would taken (we meaning entire world) extreme action beginning, 100% travel ban mandatory quarantine. realistically possible. even think China could done much virus insidious, confusing symptoms long incubation period. Basically, time know something wrong late. 

Many countries low case rates, last effective vaccine. Mask wearing going become norm rest lives. hospitality industry permanently devastated. Employers going turn towards automation machines get sick. UBI going become necessary. people want go eat, think allowed to. personally may never again. Especially Trump supporters excuse say common flu killing people COVID-19. They'll spin reality protect leader's fragile ego. little orange snowflake. Wouldn’t greater chance mortality anyway without Covid exposed air pollution time? I've tons people try get go patios refuse (even though work restaurant.) need something involving contact it!! article kinda misleading.

The Civil War got people thinking nation single nation federation individual states...although I’m sure people South complicated viewpoint that.

Lots questions lots answers linked article. [actually he's Citation needed. Still trying push football start asap though. Tbf there's hemisphere earth give us idea it'll go. 

We'll ok. real-time Covid related deaths reached 911 today. 

[Worldometer Covid Don’t remember read this, there’s difference epidemiological end pandemic social end pandemic. hope social end pandemic happens time widespread distribution vaccine. That’s reasonable way end- staying vigilant vaccine without prolonged, unwarranted restrictions. course, assumes widespread vaccination happens end Q1 2021. that’s case, don’t see people following restrictions past beginning next year (saying independent whether believe shouldn’t happen). Either way, it’s gonna end point. world watch one “News” organization get view situation change another “News” channel get entirely different view exact situation, find completely understandable side fence. Pro trump. get it. Anti trump. get it. Pro Biden. get it. Think virus fake. get it. Think it’s scariest thing since Black Plague. get it. arguing divided coming “News” media, banned using word news.
Point is, really side armed different, likely misleading blatantly false, information. 
Let’s hug turn focus constructive direction. direction is, idea. dumb. I’m hoping one it. Lol Check Chernobyl HBO... basically part plot. Except leaders actually wised up, accepted massive problem fix, fixed it. Trump even acknowledged there's problem. reasoning matter bad tragedy US long things getting worse elsewhere, anywhere, we've done better? C students rejoice! Yep also happens Wisconsin. border. “You know don’t wear mask right?” always flip around them. “Yeah well I’m coming Chicago don’t want spread anything guys”. like even countries. think yesterday day France posted highest amount new cases single day, like yet Biden refused express confidence Fauci. He's gonna lose keeps shit amazing comparisons. Proper grammar, please. Trump *grifter* employs *shills.* thinking thing, especially looking students living campus, likely return living campus next semester. could substantial enough herd immunity won’t repeat fall Risk what, mild respiratory illness &lt;0.4% death rate? know, right? Good counterpoint. I'll take living Bay living NE day. locked less hard kill tens thousands grandmas terrible policy. Cuomo Lamont circlejerk way ⌛ ⌛ think it’s important note nationally still first wave locally that’s case . States like Florida , New York, Maine I’d imagine many ones know sure clear first waves Florida even coming second wave . Except hard, three weeks quarantine almost long term effect reducing spread virus. increase deaths really significant though. we're calling saw US second wave, although cases first, deaths per day second wave higher first. think unique case though. maybe Lol one said ""make me""

Projection much?

😂 Imagine actually living it... got source Ur Statement ? Ah, read article clickbait title. Thanks. public news everywhere, one knew real would make decision Dude, conflating ""Total, 100% protection environment absolutely flooded droplets hospitals"" ""If everyone wears people whole lot less likely get it.."" 


The early messaging making sure hospitals enough supplies. mistake? Heck yes, hindsight. time goddamn clue high initial spikes going get fast going able get PPE. 


Its frankly delusional think election November.  


For one, cases seem go pretty much hand hand lax mask usage. alone pretty solid indicator effective. countries require significant cooperation mask wearing less gotten whole mess control not. rest world gas lighting us influence election. 


One thing see come belief accompany usually ""our testing getting false positives disease bad people say"", inconsistent itself. 


This year far US, \~200,000 extra deaths. number people die every year roughly constant, compared years 200,000 people die. 


If believe look CDC stats, look data collected compiled entirely third party counting obituaries.  


Because thing different year really COVID, pretty easily claim COVID caused deaths. 


So, 


(Total People Infected) x (Average Fatality Rate) = 200,000 
(Total People Infected) = 200,000 / (Average Fatality Rate)

&amp;#x200B;

For entire USA, 6.28 million covid cases confirmed CDC. Lets give COVID really low fatality rate - lets say 0.1% 


(Total People Infected) = 200,000 / (0.001) 
(Total People Infected) = 20 million people 


So COVID deadly say, whole lot people would infected CDC claims, less. situation CDC would able report higher number deadly anyone thinks. 


So killed 5% people 


(Total People Infected) = 200,000 / (0.05) 
(Total People Infected) = 4 million people 


But case \*\*definitely\*\* dangerous heck, even reported. 


That know nothing election year. verify general shape magnitude CDC fauci says even without looking tests. Lol. WA voting mail like 15 years. rampant voter fraud. signature match, send back resign correct signature. still match, get counted. purge voter rolls delete dead people regularly. Stop stupid.  Spanish Flu 3% IFR, COVID 0.4% IFR.

They’re wrong. Thanks! sure got downvoted saying truth lol. matter many people every state testing. also need rate infection put number context. country's CFR 10% US 6% US infection rate double, US objectively worse job. Doubly infection rate actual control of. He’s saying want hear— get him!!!! Why? economy reopened back 90% people going normal lives again... chance heard immunity point?? going rough time think that. Yes continue trying stay healthy a) vaccine widely available/safe/effective, b) job market comes back venture new career, c) shut due state outbreak (inevitable). fiance also industry completely lost job. Bartenders hired right now. need income. thanks government expecting everyone get back normal everything fine. Yes, control employed unemployed homeless. I'll take former. part guidelines even. voluntarily playing fire. Common sense tells still get people sick might been, party. still get people sick way party, unless teleport there.

Playing contact sports outdoors? Grey area.

Indoor dining 50%? Grey area.

College kids parties know advance good amount COVID? Nope, that's definite black area.

I agree concept saying, disagree specific case though ""gray"" (grey?). 

Don't know? None matter anymore. SAVE LIVES. ////ssss

It's goddam joke. taken ride right amazes fucking stupid everyone become. going follow president's advice vote twice?  idea others don’t rights outlook different exactly here. even opinion.  Peru ""full lockdown"", economy people going crowded markets every day buy day's food led massive spread virus.

Conversely, Sweden ""no lockdown"". plenty mitigation measures, unlike US, people actually followed rather deliberately sabotage them. also much better healthcare system country like Peru US, number cases would expect much better result there. even need far there. far fastest produced vaccine, tainted politics/Trump. I'm taking it. I'm still amazed saw last night Kansas City. care reduced number people 17,000. still super spreader event! Especially considering would attend event likely also anti mask. we're still first wave......smh America. -from American going follow directions Dr.Fauci think hes become famous? misinformation given? prez say , last night campaigning , US ahead curve . heard morning radio news station Calgary Alberta course not. LA County schools would used proof positive children safely resume in-person schooling thus revealing distance-learning measures nonsensical. California already lunch, many battleground states (like neighboring AZ) would take message heart. mean, blatant lie.

[There video readily plenty people along roads, still hundreds hundreds people crowded around beginning end stages. they’re dangerous given gear go help put fires, gives shit them, let sleep floor. actually part solution, let earn freedom... fuck else want people do? long need lock time? Tom Green actually good explanation - believes since toilet paper packages generally large aisle clears much faster items. example, one aisle toilet paper may 50 packages TP, aisle noodles could probably put 500+ packages noodles, 200+ boxes cereal, stuff like that. would also explain water paper towels went fast too. aisle clears faster everyone buying one two packages toilet paper prepare hunker down. items stay shelves longer even though everyone buying one two, trucks send many packages TP, water, paper towels, etc larger. risk overall epidemic growing.

That's ""indicating risk"" *actually* growing. Right living covid, gonna go away vaccine.  That's makes angry it.

I live AZ one last states officially lock non-essentials. tourists southwest come play golf shit state.

If country locked weeks whole, we'd much better. one state locks another doesn't, borders open, absolutely good. Yep.

if Biden wins gets inaugurated, Fox News immediately start launching much problem deficit is, Trump blew up. 

They start claiming unemployment numbers said good Donald Trump bad Joe Biden. 

and economy continues suffer everything Donald Trump try artificially prop essentially eroding solid foundation market temporary delays, they'll claim Joe Biden's fault. adjusted last week New York. case second week tends close final figures. Yes. Here’s archived link read article  Vote wallets, too. 

I specifically steer dollars away trump states. PA suck big fat dick.. used get auto parts switched different distributor. Also gave Yuengling beer openly supported fucker. 

It takes small amount research know brands, goods services originate from.  rewarding selfish fucks money. Reminds economist realizes first time model works exists perfect world... need change votes. need people sat 2016 show up. winning margins swing states incredibly slim. 90% America rate changed 3 weeks 2 weeks automatically marked recovered.

And yeah, matters state 50% population literally thinks ""fake news"" everything try hide minimize people impacted. I'm one thinks so. 

Regardless, I'm telling you, that's lot trust there. keep changing definitions. also extremely reduced amount tests they're limited hours free testing offer state health department four hour window. didn’t say said never got cases way knew national emergencies could complicated art trade sausage gets made masks prevalent. Let’s hope stays way. hope it’s fucking cold even idiots want stay inside.  American... coronavirus hoax  locked the

What fuck about? state locked up. called schools shut end month, looks like we're right track. mistake ever reopen them. Yeah right.

People get choosing pretend attempt lead normal life potentially (indirectly) leading deaths fellow man. He’s part problem. telling everyone March wear masks. Thanks info! private gatherings problem? America there's lots private events going on, parties 5-15 people especially, even weddings, authorities really bother breaking many local cops want social distancing police. would point tried national policy told authority. 

Some policy ideas terrible, still attempts national policy. true, concern past 4 years constant indoctrination prepping loss. He's said ""The way going lose election rigged."" base convinced mail-in ballots terrible (but absentee, except Florida that's ok reasons).


I'm seriously worried happen even loses base riot guarantee it. think blm riots valid they'll use excuse riot trump Let’s assume Biden it’s over. really don’t wanna become complacent It’s like buy red car notice red cars road. Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, also known frequency illusion. 

One person probably stared completely unrelated reason think everyone staring mask. Indeed. ""Americans outsmarted virus. can't second wave first one never ends"" - wont go away new leadership Whouse like tobacco smoker comprehend appreciated others. Stop awful excuses continue using Facebook. gross. so... virus getting schools, school safe

incredible Republicans: Coronavirus hoax made dems make Trump look bad

Also Republicans: Stop politicizing everything   seems like opposite what's happening tbh, cases mother's hospital almost non existent business resumed usual. I'm NY btw besides nothing open yet people thing mask on. following Tour, concerning see. get groceries alcohol delivered. go pharmacy meds controlled can’t delivered.
I take kids outdoors only, outdoor done every weekend.
Social distant family visits week parks.
Husband works outside home public heavily protected.

So sure that’s isolated not. title misleading then. laugh thanks him, able upgrade gaming computer :) called racists 30k daily new hospitalizations doesn’t seem like “good job”  Thankfully, one near closed. mean truly, expect reopened everything? genuinely expect virus piss gotten bored it? tried warn you, seems like hellbent learning hard way. don’t listen cuz hair messed glasses crooked keeps dropping papers Dr. Fauci Tells Americans Ready ~~To 'Hunker Down'~~ Economic Depression Fall Winter death counts weighted account incomplete data. However, data recent week(s) still likely incomplete.

This misleading. says weighting make incomplete recent weeks sentence. 🤦‍♂️ coward worst sorts Good. like anyone would teach covid. 

Trump worn mask Feb March instead politicized mask. I’m trying downplay virus, I’m trying correct fear-mongering misinformation. People 200k-people-dead-some-40k-more-to-follow-by-year-end alarmed “holy shit virus going triple lethality next three months” alarmed. nothing statements political looking science speaking that.

Again ask please put thought behind comments hitting submit. may hurtful general discourse Tbh isolated small group outdoor activities too. issue. fun! seriously laughed loud comment. Imagine deluded.

American culture fault, politician save ass. None care you, Trump without filter it.

Other Americans also care others either.  people fair amounts distancing (working remote, bar hopping, going packed sporting events, even eating much,etc) ask OP u/FredoSosa provide article full length. Please. Oh meant summer love lots sex drugs good Euphoria go around mean practically impossible people US isolate way able Europe. gave one measly check, increased unemployment benefits bit. get laid off, stop working. can't stop working, still need send kids school, daycare, school care. many ""essential workers"" (read: cashiers) afford stop working matter at-risk are.

And top that, lot places unemployment benefits impossible get processed due volume claims. Many people still received unemployment benefits stimulus checks.

It really lot complete failure government run deficit (federal) support people staying home. course, Democrats *tried* increase benefits. Republicans blocked it, made easier big companies steal money, refuse anything help people all.

100% fault lies Republicans. kinds, Trumpets moderates alike. Thanks! According inbox last message pretty pissy, still damn source, I'm surprised lol Around 1.400 new cases per day average, 25k-ish active cases. actually read long post someone used work basically came ""he downplayed protect us."" They're never snapping trance in. biggest fucking joke day conservative sub posted 9/11 never forget time supporting traitor killed 190k counting Americans....but know whatever guess. one wins base alone. least democratically. biggest concern undemocratic election, normal. also falling beginning june shot back again. currently daily cases mid april Name one useful thing Fauci told actually requires medical expertise. He’s underratedly worthless. Turning 24 October. gotten laid since March. met anyone new since them. I've interacted handful people since then, nothing do, job prospects, dating scene abismal, one wants meet new people.

Yea, shit sucks flu season soon

So many people say this, measure used prevent Covid spreading also prevent flu spreading. easily easiest flu season (in terms normal flu) we've modern history. many free masks available Quebec. bunch states refuse follow federal directives. Lamo fuck Americans dumb worries. poor reading comprehension part.  gah, 2.66 times deaths. care catch it. That's valid excuse. still wear mask. nose. leave pecker hanging out! took forever finally ""bite"" projector. tough balancing something that's portable something that's good, suggestions online indoor setups, portable. need anything phenomenal since we're mostly using campy stuff/stuff need best fidelity anyway.

We ended settling Anker Nebula Mars Pro 2 - good mix decent quality portability needed. We've able use hour moment, got rained first movie night weather shitty since, performed admirably projected onto sheet haphazardly slung photo backdrop stand. put whole White House hiatus Jan 20 2021. mean least nothing get worse.  lol think Germans disciplined people also scientifically aware... attributes need hour tackle pandemic. first problem every state lockded mid-March. second lockdown merely kicks road unless accompanied putting proper contact tracing testing place suffiecient PPE stock lockdown taking place. Would feel way one ones died? sometimes living worse. starting find chronic problems follow virus. Remember polio? Brilliant! /s law, merchants getting fined, individuals. got voted recent post saying US still first wave lol. clueless people parents voted him. They’re voting Biden election. quote dad, Trump “damned fool.” wish realized 4 years ago I, like many others thought joke, true evil try burning $20 would cost restaurant?

I can't understand someone wants pay 4x much horribly prepared food. gonna need bigger ICU Yeah exactly. goes everybody. Saying virus 99% survival rate relevant statistic incident. party involving college-age kids, survival rate would actually dramatically higher 99% specific group (ie much closer 100% 99%).

I suspect nature reddit fact anything said coronavirus panicky sensationalized gets downvoted post get downvoted, unquestionably statistically accurate. Happen time. Rock n roll, barecode, internet, ogm, RFID, plot NWO. be.  [Trump made kiss  makes even staggering think 25 million died Black Plague. 191,000 US far (confirmed) already feels incomprehensibly large me. People itching hand freedoms, kind ridiculous. get hard wearing mask? Well, get hard staying home. Better stop driving too, age 65, odds dying automobile accident far greater dying coronavirus. Japan/Korea/etc SARS, although 12 years far, 'forever' simply means max capacity anyone time reduced. correct many restaurants may operating point given time, restrictions allow exceed threshold. Ultimately, think allowing indoor dining moment recipe disaster. However, reducing capacity least lowers risk (because many people potentially infected fewer people potentially infect others once.) live Quebec, big merchants give mask one. open box sitting entrance along hand washing stations and/or hand sanitizer. fact elected scientist probably says lot country whole, even leader alone can't said responsible response.

I mean, can't imagine day elect scientist president US. Sadly. Source 3% mortality rate:  !remindme 8 weeks One top doctors nation said US still FIRST SURGE still flu season coming. happened past 7 months makes think going keep getting better? still hang friends safe. feel like many people subreddit take things extreme. don’t throw party something able hang 1 2 friends park something, unless immune compromised. Umm.... yeah... words. Innuendo Studios called it: ""[Angry Jack Jack BBQ eating ribs offers someone else say ""no thanks I'm vegan"" Jack gets angry, why, like shamed lectured? fears judged, person went vegan probably pretty strong moral reason it, Jack acknowledge moral reason might grapple fact willing put moral argument aside something enjoys, lashes out.

Same masks, deep fear us wearing masks ""right"" maskless wrong struggling wrestle that, easier get angry us. Fox News lending credulity Trump 2 days ago. Mr Self Preservation probably comfy week latest clutzy gambit.  hang together hang separately. Americans sure like honoring sacrifice spectator sport. easy find fallacies reasoning credible knowledgeable matter, without resort ad hominem. Go White people! happy it. Part trouble Fauci sole voice reason. almost try alone. Trump reinstated pandemic response team like said would. Could Fauci getting backed Rear Admiral Ziemer field well many others. Instead policy jack shit blame China. spend lot time rural Midwest hearing things like ""this gonna magically disappear November 4th"" words like ""Plandemic."" wear mask EVERYWHERE - including clients offices they're back 0% WFH. Every time someone makes glib comment mask taken responding ""your/your grandma's funeral"", depending age. shuts people pretty quick. probably get trouble soon. Hey, worries! put foot mouth week ( put lightly) I'd misread someone's comment; apologize 'eat crow', speak.

I definitely trying help! (hope did) *Spain France entered chat* Canada much relaxed US. live Canada many properties US, feel FAR likely get picked secret police US Canada. cops look like military there. teacher, I’m getting forced (In South FL) 3 feet distance whole workday asymptomatic children. matters lot! well, wont get wave 2 wave 1 ends Ostensibly could say one guy got downsized Toyota lost job girlfriend blew head Facebook everyone made TikToks lost life because.... waitaminute America never actually locked down, heavily enforced coronavirus measures, uhhhh, anywhere?

So wasn’t “lockdown”

It mentally suffering people easy access guns. Man fuck captain hindsight. He’s sayin whole lot shit get go look still are. Trump take blame deaths, guy. I’m average joe don’t know details exactly guy suspect it’s somewhere along lines getting paid top dollar supposedly keep Americans safe. 
The thing remember guy absolute refusal saying protest gathering crowds increases likelyhood catching Covid 19 court. 
Fuck fucker. Someone put jail. Well. border Canada US gonna stay closed lot longer. Canadian I'm okay this. 538 also constantly insisted year much better Biden 2016 Clinton. multi-point polling leads Clinton basically entire election cycle. Spain, France Italy early, fast outbreaks caused lot deaths therefore made news lot. actually relatively positive tests (thanks part harsh lockdowns). None 12,000 positive tests per million, France Italy way that, despite lot testing. contrast, Florida currently 30,000, U.S. whole 20,000. 

You can't suppress virus (unless perhaps isolated, wealthy, island nation). affect timing cases. Perhaps Spain lot untested cases farther along looks, probably based positivity rates. They've got get big surge things get better. almost 12,000 per week fewer peak 2017-2018 flu season

Just curious trying compare peak flu season week late August/early September. Sweden’s death rate could easily drop lower 11th place list countries record deaths Covid-19. point. Yeah without walmart greeters there's civilization. fucking dumb end. That's extremely disingenuous. We’re depressed I'm poking fun reddit here, consistently ""corporate bailouts"". Tegnell harm refuse lockdown. lied, downplayed forced parents send children school knowing safe. Kudos posting today! perpetual self-inflicted infection cycle we're stuck taught us anything, never underestimate number idiots country. mean I'm expert. Hell, I'm even doctor scientist. obviously word mean much. But, would believe first surge anymore. Illinois around 500 cases last week shot 10fold. Literally. Seems like second surge.

Either way, that's probably minor detail. care first surge 10th surge, Fauci 100% right feel depressed can't get coronavirus cases down.

In beginning, ""well countries smaller course they'll less cases"" bandwagon. But, since jumped that. 

If remember correctly (Don't source, might one there) , take Europe compare U.S, Europe would larger population still significantly better place at. Thank reply.

You guys close-to-the-chest research, getting small slice fact add big picture.

I'm assuming IgM IgG study specific epitope looking for. would able measure total amount IgM IgG, would immunity floating serum. probably frustrating know getting small part picture, frustration scientists would understand

Perhaps antibodies tracking, protect humans Coronavirus. previous linked article nih. rule out? mean, people already kind panicked. Remember toilet paper? I'm confused rant. alternative working there? control yourself? Why? think through, man. Nobody would listened them. Masks would instantly depleted. Come on. Also possible go get antibody test randomly done? mom May COVID19 November, fits criteria symptoms wise almost hospitalized it. doctors never able pinpoint making sick, lungs severely attacked Iran? hard understand merit weakness argument lie primarily content argument itself. 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! Taps head: can't devistating second wave f first wave never ends Javla svenska idioter Umm... Exactly. Well, since China seems better handle virus point, would I. cold flu risk passing someone passes someone passes elderly person ends dying it. What’s different this?

I mean.. go I'm sick. I'm home trying get better working remotely, sleeping recovering. 

Where would going I'm sick except doctor? 

""Hey y'all, I'm sick contagious, really wanted hang anyway."" kidding? I’m depressed Fauci didn’t say anything useful late pure cowardice self preservation ask democrats managed convince India play along. traitor majority, maybe that's country is. Republicans party projection. exactly lead 2018 midterms. manufactures carvan boarder required army send troops illegally. narrative evaporated second polls closed. thats operate assume thats everyone operates. county Republicans Democrats collect ballots count ballots. did. it’s 06 morning coffee hasn’t hit. Mea Culpa.  Basically point entire segments population trust work bodies sharp objects entire countries fine masks, there’s little worry about. (I'm responding opposed initial response me): 

If person making argument credible subject they're arguing, perfectly valid discredit argument based that. country WWII. base MUCH smaller think. obnoxiously loud minority.   Trump able secure “new” voters. hope make sure close 100% base turns vote lesser number voters discouraged part system vote: scared virus, enough interest politics, mistrusts USPS. 

Trump can’t hope convince anyone wasn’t already rabid trump fan, Biden voter Bernie backer would ever throw vote trump. 

So he’s counting race close pretend declare victory bull way re-election. He’ll write impotent executive order saying powers past January won’t happen there’s LOT people would super happy part team dragged like petulant toddler White House choose stay there. Trump administration flew immigrant detainees Virginia summer facilitate rapid deployment Homeland Security tactical teams quell protests Washington, circumventing restrictions use charter flights employee travel, according current former U.S. transfer, dozens new arrivals tested positive novel coronavirus, fueling outbreak Farmville, Va., immigration jail infected 300 inmates, one died. comparison, US done 90 million. everything morality. really see this? Science give us facts figures, cannot tell us them. That's moral values. example, society values safety freedom react differently facts figures society values freedom safety. science, different policy response. 

If succeeded hepling understand moral dimension pandemic response, perhaps links help. National Post article explains particularly Agreed. think reflects type people drawn politics country world. Performers love power. Humans trusting nature people meet daily lives sociopaths narcissists, good recognizing it. trump must eyebrows russian bounties now. Regardless, he's STILL anything know. Saying outcome worse desired would changed information *found later* hardly surprising. hope that’s people position 90% countries saying. Hindsight 20/20. think really, really, really likes 15 minutes knows nobody give crap he's milking worth. mean see InStyle magazine cover? guy media darling loves spotlight. sure people paid mind blundering HIV/AIDS. gives people much hope spotlight much anymore mention political party anything sort, individuals chose ignore science/think know actual experts. understand political part lines beliefs intent here. generalized response individuals comments like claim Fauci wrong yet infectious disease experts themselves. I'm 19 years old

Btw, refunds history surrender all.. No, that's works. They're credible epidemiology public health; literally outside area expertise. valid argument, others making (or collaborating them). valid argument, perfectly acceptable point lack expertise guiding factor toward incorrect conclusions.

You're wrapped idea somehow going make point screaming AD HOMINEM overlooking fact posting *cryptofascist propaganda expertise trying undermine entire public heath field largest health crisis lifetimes.* Yeah, outdoors risk much lower. embed doesnt work, follow link instead, work. wear mask see people wearing masks every day never stared seen others stared at. Stockholm. Makes wonder many lives could saved year applied lessons we've learned coronavirus. Certainly need go full lockdown, increased social distancing + mask usage winter months could save thousands lives. Remove traitor White House, start directing ship federal level utilizing science logic.

Because Republican mismanagement arguably going expensive recovery endeavor. Trillions lost, take trillions more. 42 almost certainly died coronavirus, it. Suck neckbeards. Saying since March

If article says “may” “could”

It means it’s junk science worth getting happy worried about.

Wait someone complete actual science Dude. Cases trending since July. Deaths trending since end July way since initial surge April. absolutely better handle there’s evidence cases going back up. flu present may present specific complications people Covid nothing spread Covid.

Edit: fully board wearing mask times public, keeping schools businesses closed long necessary, providing economic relief need it, etc. misrepresenting reality helps one. ayn rand selfishness. America psychopath nation. that's science works. Einstein's theory general relatively could correct. proven mathematical sense, best fits data. 

But ok, go ahead, tell think likely killed 200,000 extra Americans since March, pandemic? 

Say it. it? researchers look whatever is? second choice interesting point; thought that. 

In Wisconsin example Jill Stein's 30K votes outnumbered 20K vote margin Trump by. stands reason least *portion* would've held nose voted Hillary. Would enough? Maybe. Who's going hunker down? people charge said there's going lockdowns everything back open. Omg, obviously heard people say it'll dissappear April.... heat.


.... 2022 ""WhERe MoNy COme FroM??!!""

Meanwhile they've negotiating 300 billion 3 trillion dollar package months. 

People idiots. assumes 1) identify isn’t risk (we’re still figuring out) 2) segment supposed “high risk” populations “low risk” populations proving impossible since people don’t even want wear masks reduce transmission ~70% little trade off. 

That’s actually change approach all, it’s exactly we’ve trying failing do. Turns need universal policy strict enforcement best guarantee effective compliance. lot people wearing masks aren’t welcome shops otherwise. capita infections.

Again, European countries testing much. Less testing = less cases. funny people forget teachers people too. Alive people get sick, like them. Imagine that. deaths going much? someone explain? think know intent headline here. killed million DESPITE response. 

It's like saying need umbrella rain get wet using one. shitty thing family Student here.

I saw coming back December... Nobody listened me. still think I'm overreacting I've shut entire year them. work research. 

Back February/March, assumed it'd short time advised start making cloth masks. Because... duh. know masks work. know N95s help slow spread airborne disease. Plenty hospitals around world still use cloth masks.

And then... no. That's happened. US Surgeon General saying masks may likely cause harm good. CDC saying sick people needed masks... already knew asymptomatic spread... one seemed putting two pieces together.

And trying figure fuck sources things.... none. Especially cloth masks harm. one study comparing cloth surgical masks widely interpreted mean cloth worse nothing, paper actually said cloth worse *control*-- also masked group. honest staring feel like crazy person, hell say ""I think Surgeon General full shit"", hand research living able find even one thing back ""expert"" opinion?

It frustrating watch. science back initial advice &amp; statements experts. experts seemed missing basic steps logic common sense. gave impression really know nothing masks work, true. Wow, big outbreaks European countries sure look like ""under control.""

Spin want, cases rising like US last months.  


And here's article Donald Trump extorted governors cheap political points pandemic. there's election coming up.  One prime reasons Victoria, Australia, suffered corona disaster workplace culture intolerance workers staying home unwell remained unchanged despite circumstances. Nope. reading comprehension issues. exactly, referring general political landscape US, especially elections coming up. think Fauci dishonest though. course job make sure people healthy. job properly, would acknowledge effects health isolation, doing. could even argue mental health problems, strict covid regulations impact overall health disease itself. think might used inderectly media democrats push certain agenda, think manipulating data, dishonest health effects covid long term Isolation. know, one exception cases listed somehow Biden's fault despite drop power? protective actual President? think so. Much drop CFR related younger people getting † estimates based age-specific estimates infection fatality ratios Hauser, A., Counotte, M.J., Margossian, C.C., Konstantinoudis, G., Low, N., Althaus, C.L. Riou, J., 2020. Estimation SARS-CoV-2 mortality early stages epidemic: modeling study Hubei, China, six regions Europe. PLoS medicine, 17(7), p.e1003189.

But actually extrapolate 0.73% positive rate? false positive rate tests? physicians requiring patients come taking extra steps keep covid bay. They're often skeleton staff, PPE. allow patients sit waiting room, instead waiting cars receive text. safer going Costco local supermarket. far R95's P95's, according contractor buddy industrial respirators filtration N95's never certified medical grade. fine. Yeah front loading deaths really clever seeing massive improvements treatment options since beginning. Good job Sweden!
Or really think Nordic neighbors catch you? exactly people lying? 

The CDC, Trump administration, Dr Fauci. Pay closer attention, some.big secret. see much changes next week. won’t nearly much first week. Talk then. thing sad comment. name Scott chance? sound [like giant 𓀐𓂺 Maybe, maybe, summer outside, big gathering holidays gone now, won’t shit like Sturgis Spring Break attract multi-states stupid.

Awful clickbait. Poor attempt Zuck slander people need die idiots get it.

Many, many more. Nobody die really bad. worst point Obama years.

I can't wait get back normal life, may well continue wear cloth mask, wash hands religiously every hour, avoid hugging shaking hands GOD hate shitty, drippy, miserable head cold.  stopped International screening going full-blown coronavirus school holidays. Sadly incapable leaders branches government. shitty options.

1. hunker get nothing, eventually get evicted die starvation. 

2. work take chances getting covid. getting 1k+ deaths every day right now. happening evenly throughout country.

You need mass graves single city predicted number become reality. name Maverick. irony. one highest death rates per million population countries, sure they're longer top 10 still outside I'm sure equals vindication. Good call. reminded another: Zen centers holding sitting meditations talks online is hope, it lies proles Yes worry boss I'm already hunkered hunkered down. Again, write paranoid?

But, head executive branch U.S. said *his* FDA control ""deep state"" bases vaccine approval medical scientific criteria.   

It's nice industry willing self-regulate. But, reminded Boeing allowed self-regulate software believed responsible crashes two 737's.    

President Trump may developing vaccine. setting timeline. FDA CDC (I recall which) told states prepare distribute vaccine Nov 1st.    

I think might hearing pitch vaccine may approved late October.

Perhaps jobs, minimum wage rediculous compared even Canada, factory workers aren’t paid well.  Unless technical skilled position wages aren’t high. get high paying jobs need gone expensive schooling lot people carry student loans. 


So. born wealth family really well. aren’t struggling along time. first read closing billion brain shorted second. China question wont answered, sadly. Critical context understanding going restaurants, especially desperate survive US zero appropriate state support speak of:

*Hygiene Theater*

If encountered term yet analog *security theater* similarly means think: over-emphasis exclusive emphasis performative rituals actually provide hygiene, security; reassure participating organization/whatever ""taking appropriate precaution,"" hence, *everything fine!*

In instance find fascinating, pint world ends sort way, oldest deeply felt/maintained rituals around *ritual cleanliness*, necessarily correlated *actual* cleanliness. house kitchen sink sponge wonderful example, employed also ""clean"" counters etc.

Now, pint. go please. Shut I've seen restaurant table door outside food left grab go.
Stay away people. simple.

Read can't clap one hand. You’ve clearly never seen bottled water 30,000 feet. complicated. TSA finding 10 close doors? mean we’ve already seen industry lose one leg. Doesn’t seem fair take waste now.  plan stay home binge drink...  LOL. Exactly. Record!!!  Nobody shake hand USA Canada anymore either. aways thought shaking hands dirty thing especially people meet know well really anyone honestly know hand lately. could wiped picked nose, could fingers mouth even could picking bum touching private parts. shaking hands dirty thing ratio Infection Fatality Ratio. 0.0067 deaths per infection. number CDC uses pandemic planning packet. Multiply 100 get 0.67% fatality rate used seeing. America cant afford hunker down, best fact washing hands, wearing masks, social distancing also helps flu protection air kiss alternating cheeks French people greet people. USA’s fault imagine everyone farting time eat.

That's COVID looking next meal.

P. S. COVID might farts too. statement stand 30 seconds much “ pay much?”  400$ per month? What’s co pay? deductible ? much dr network network hospital. 


Sorry. health care plans lot companies supply costs lot cheque screw get sick. Hey now, whenever get screened, proudly ask American grope. 

The TSA agent like ""I wish call that."" People eating drinking don’t wear masks. could would safer. indoors without masks big risk Nice 17 day old account nothing comments trying downplay COVID Ironically, CHINA still labeled “high risk country/region” community transmitted case. France must horrible leadership. school back open phucked. right. Probably inflammatory, I'm honestly disappointed contributing vitriolic discourse permeates sub daily basis. family includes blue collar workers POC sucks watching hemorrhage money right rest world criticizing people like going back work. ... rights students diminished SCOTUS. school act speech disrupts learning environment. course, think getting COVID-19 much disruptive, really really unclear hell advice would good for.

People lot overhead need shrink expenses income short supply may continue several months. like that's small group people. Unemployment double digits. heaters way expensive run furnaces, electric worst way heat space. waste $60, gonna colder winter pay (why?! god would this). Even slightly cheaper, veggies gonna grow freezing cold? living bedroom too? Also, frozen pipes gonna cost fortune stop heating house.

Mine thermostat it. close door sleep leave 65° run needs to. 

As opposed using existing central air system redirect everything bedroom. That's less efficient case. could show power bills YOY comparing central heat localized space heating. much cheaper situation. take shitload dirt space. I've experimenting upside-down veggie growing; single tomato plant takes minimum five gallon bucket dirt. tried growing cherry tomatoes one gallon containers, got ten tomatoes per plant. using enough dirt, get fruit speak waste time, effort, water &amp; electric. project anyone small house could undertake, let alone someone renting room. mention, pretty hard limit number plants indoors moisture becomes issue, walls ceiling start mold. really need significant prep grow op, including special paint special insulation special ventilation. fucking cheap. Growing outside free dirt free sun containers cheap.

I use space buckets LEDs. need empty buckets, aluminum foil, LEDs. LEDs enough UV light grow plants. Everything already would really cheap local harbor idea much insulate walls?? even recommended unless walls literally uninsulated; best insulation bang buck attic (both monetarily losing heat). That's cheap either (at least terms penny-pinching suggesting living dried beans), least look around see state/country subsidizes you. one might pay back within couple years previously minimal insulation, since labor costs cheap since access attic since, again, place likely losing heat. probably gonna make back money blow siding removed replaced extra wall insulation, least within next years.

[See comment good advice get dried beans. even then, gonna cook eat beans, wasting money. Although practical tips here: cook beans lot salt couple bay leaves, they'll better flavor. also make large batch, freeze 15oz time Ziplock bags, makes convenient use ten hour prep time use beans.

Get stocked soon can. prices getting jacked preppers. It’s actually hard believe people like still exist. living? Pippin: quarantine? Masks indoors? Social distancing? Contact tracing? knows them, he?

Merry: count it.  US developed nations enough resources support people lose jobs steps take ensure public health.

Well, US resources systems place. classic cruel US story applies: many people, losing job means losing home. Got link? Can’t find it. uh, lunch?

Well know... muml adjjwejwe jfdjdjd.... *slowly walks away* wear mask wont wear one again? choose die guess It’s *very* likely correlation **not** causation. Healthy people higher vitamin levels (more exercise, sun exposure). already knew day one sub r/politics focus covid. hard tell sarcasm ‘US bad guy’ circlejerk happens. pipes burst?  400+ deaths reported Florida last 48 hours. Stop posting bullshit. Sometimes depends define certain terms. instance, many distinguish children elementary age kids children middle school high school. Suck obey Karen! Republicans trying bundle covid lawsuit next relief bill? Yeah I'm fully sure dynamics situation work seems like could spread pretty low death numbers blended background late Jan/Early Feb.

The whole death lagging indicator thing real here, much death lag infections. Don’t worry. won’t. Flu horrible last year, worried year too. flushot tested positive influenza B Thanksgiving last year. sick hospital told came back I'd need hospitalization. Thankfully, flu antivirals helped get it, cough shortness breath still around March. evaluated lung damage soon. :/

I dread catching COVID. mean flu like 100%=COVID bad. caught pneumonia July tested negative COVID that's fun (actually going get antibody tested soon make sure really negative coz left while). lungs good shape. one accepted 50k tuition though? satire? even begin would massively increase food &amp; supply production &amp; stockpile months advance. countries successfully locked able stay supplied countries didn't. knew things going get worse. Time put last six months planing effect. great think US similarly light flu season. bet COVID deniers twist say COVID cases actually flu. Calling now. long lasting immune response guarantee won’t get reinfected. you’ll least head start fighting virus second time around. hope 2 years. Give us plenty time vaccines. Yeah, that’s universal basic income would achieved But, comparing country continent... Time keeps slipping slipping Stop idiot. entire quarantine dorm filled sick students, many dealing obvious symptoms. mean, TSA busted them? [shoe foiled flight passengers. What’s like literal piece human trash? Trump admitted Covid deadly tape. virus deniers free accept real. Someone needs tell this. 16000 KC game. Crazy? Could LOL, ""Duh"" first word come mind me, well. gone restaurants since started. can't imagine could safe, unless outdoor seating plenty space masked servers. much around here. Compared where? much better destinations choose easier refugee claims free health safe landed limited cases COVID.  American dream dead. idea become anything want america fine since 70s,80s. 

You become successful us wiped healthcare costs. Pretty sure Lincoln County bigger Brown County too, it? count rainbow color orange? really, want see them. I'm wrong I'd like know. Every single one jackasses I've argued months refused give sources. supposed know I'm wrong without them?

Are even listening yourself? essentially saying people would've died anyway, fuck them. perfectly ok died slow painful death make life choices think should've.

At least share degree know background. know much experts study shit living, prove it. Give sources show fucking expert.

If can't, might time grow fuck admit might've mistaken. may mock. Go ahead. cannot stop you. one would like see better world. Blah blah blah catch every case. 

There real IFR. la bise? Disagree. told February world would shut 18 months would panic attacks month. Hope wonderful thing. US cannot # thanks WH, GOP, Anti mask wearing fuckers, great orange hair grumpy old fart. Fascinating report, thanks posting it! 

Too bad 13 states responded CNN. would fantastic able read every state every week. window different state are, virus-wise, choices they’re making. 

I idea (and relieved) fed virus task force closely monitoring colleges/uni’s, specifically. 👍 bartender well. rough especially job fall back on. doubt surge largely due travelers arriving France. Also, two countries still taking citizens returning overseas, albeit prudently keeping quarantine 2 weeks. know UK also this, case France? civil war wont happen separated states politics. anything coup d'état might happen I'd hesitant FDA gives approval late October clearly political stunt. timeline I've always mind Memorial Day 2021 (in regards vaccine). would mass production multiple vaccines 5 solid months data behind went first (along added months phase 3 individuals). know one working one not. that's nearly 50%, right? talking Sweden cases deaths significantly higher every Scandinavian country. Finland reversed travel ban Sweden. Who’s tasting semen?
I mean, testing... That's hoping for. rest us live reality. really see bringing going help. made decision. can't control others keep safe. respect bit skeptical breathing fiberglass close face. see would work pinch going stick proper face coverings offense way going it. also quite bit studies say good idea, trying helpful.  First off, ignore commenters mocking. legitimate question people (Im Canada) taking level precautions you. Secondly, clinic/office appointment clear processes place (all Canada - like wait car called in, mask up, sanitize hands entering, maintain 6 feet, touch use shared items like pens, etc) employ combo hand sanitizing, mask, physical distancing duration visit. using 193 nm photolyse carbon bonds something that's done? oh wait minute is.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* asianherald.com makes scoop. seriously doubt it... voices drowned Swedish nationalists Tegnell worshippers. society sweden COMPLETELY setup people already social distancing majority lives. know housing situation sweden? live single units, shared units like italy, france, u.s india. soooo spread big landmass. guess what? 10 13 million people WHOLE country. so...yeah Oh no, likes that... it’s new health fad... splata! Flu shot too. um hello ... *mistake* !

I actually watch stupid boring tour.

I thought shit together, apparently not.

Ha well, trash taking out. islands small populations basically locked travelers... bad. Guess statement couldn’t applied 100% population US’s poor performance COVID blamed entirely one man despite disliked people. November comes, United States reborn anew everyone abide CDC’s guidelines. evidence idea viral infections cause sociability early stages infection viral loads high symptoms bad yet? everyone following restrictions governor says cases still aren’t going start think what’s point.  Who's currently leading total deaths daily new cases FAR? Cryptofascist propaganda lol.

HiV/AIDS taken 30 million lives. 690K last year supposedly control. That's largest health crisis lifetimes (no italics needed) lots different doctors made lots different determinations way errantly immaturely act like sort unanimous medical concensus virus around half year perfect summation really about, definitely safety.  Stay prone man! Republicans straight care anyone themselves. 

I never vote R rest life. Hopefully someone WH election dedicated beating virus instead lying make safer return. 


Also, comments appear politically motivated based facts timing country expects numbers cases point opening schools makes sense. may wishful thinking, would really like able study friend mine possible, would like ask: would sitting opposite ends 6-foot table wearing KN95 masks (which airtight faces since ones sell stores super solid structure, pass water test) open garage outside feasible way safely? yes really. cmon man..i liked obama kept pandemic response unit intact, dont go around saying shit like ""ebola issue obama dealt it""

ebola WHOLE DIFFERENT VIRUS compared covid. contact bodily fluids blood somebody knowingly sick symptoms ebola get it. hard transmit Coronavirus: love rides now! Phase 2 50% enrolled already US. We're talking weeks, months Today marks 6 months since pandemic declared. Time flies! Yay! evidence, finally...Oops, heard splat. anyone fall window? 😒 Lockdowns shutdowns long studied ineffective measures respiratory pandemics. Yet threw known logic people became afraid one. I've dining past weeks small groups friends. Almost everything re-opened exception bars/pubs. really issue people wear masks dining follow social distancing guidelines.

It's unfortunate, would exactly position leadership took outbreak seriously far fewer selfish people living US. Umm... publishing said evidence instead threatening publish it. then, another conspiracy theory. There’s reason Chinese practice take positive testing patients homes field hospitals. Why? Theyre “kids”. Theyre full grown adults reason spread hasnt stopped. And? much ask credit? 🙄 Get bubble homie, Trump lied you, it’s tape. knew serious downplayed it. USA pretty much living Covid. really doesnt matter anymore. scared it, stay inside, dont care go out. Oh agree 100% one originally claimed made PLA lab months ago? obvious question arose, would Hong Kong doctor know that? People Hong Kong allowed serve PLA. Many many times people die way virus itself. Hope that's worth panic crowd. optimistic plan actually taking action combat covid? % rate Cali 3.5% dropping. Hospitalizations also dropping. Good signs around. Thanks globalism, thanks EU forcing us keep borders open, thanks government letting hundreds infected people idiots went skiing pandemic could return home. Doctor order test. gave steroids allergy medicine.

I better tho damn Everyone much information/news coronavirus non stop months, people fed it.

You forgot misinformation and/or direct lies it, coming sides. I'm fed with. Cruise ship airport, say. I'll note got ill early January (we traveled Christmas) couple days got home. far family, mother home, dad first became symptomatic driving see NY, got back home state, stay away her. 

Again, said, seem somewhat unlikely one else would've caught along way (which makes doubt myself), can't help wonder given fever, cough, extreme fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, low oxygen level, etc. mass vaccinates Fauci gives approval.

I'm sure Trump would TRY shit, majority country (even Republicans) would take anything Fauci approve Who's generalising? Going restaurant riskier staying home. Nobody bad go restaurant. likely engage risky behaviour. 

Where live outbreaks restaurants. person likely catch covid restaurant waiter, table across room. friend meeting lunch sharing table with.

Most outbreaks live private partys. blocked seating like restaraunt. People sharing chip bowls sneezing guacamole. masks, distancing. ""hey know we're safe""

However large outbreaks restaurants group friends spread amongst day long house party. went restaraunt, spread patrons continued partying next day went another restaraunt spread too.

Infecting several hundred people. No. I’m one people knows time works. level new cases daily seeing back levels first saw April. telling people wear masks pandemic better? Use resources government get masks / make sure sent right places.  knew (those paying attention) mostly airborne transmission back January. USA! No.1! Beware India though. Really? Nobody saying that. issue virus though given it’s effectiveness transmitting see hospitalizations start increase area, could literally fucked two three weeks exponential growth behind change make starts improve situation. states trying manage opening strategies carefully. It’s good covid cases start crowding treatments people need states get position could overrun patients. problem see beginning increase, don’t know end. Yeah it’s madness Thanks! still think india going get hit absolute HARDEST virus. ive saying since march. starts there? STOP think far countries tried failed broad lockdowns compared tried surgical targeted ones. There's annoying binary thought, like options lockdown nothing, there's big swath middle largely unexplored. Well yea, Fauci says masks harmful, weeks later says arent harmful... agree also first amendment pretty iron clad.

Of course is. NOTHING 1st amendment. one, single person, suggesting John MacArthur allowed SAY exact things always said. effort restrict SPEECH. government simply saying ""those LISTENING him, within 6 feet someone else, need wear mask. listening outdoors."" incredibly reasonable trivial accommodation Christians make show concern human history crises used curb personal liberty.

Honestly, hypothetical reductio ad absurdum / slippery slope nonsense makes us look paranoid. Fauci Antichrist. Masks Mark Considering politicians picking choosing gatherings okay...

What even talking about? mass \*\*indoor\*\* meeting \*\*hundreds\*\* people Los Angeles permitted right now? Please, love mercy, bring BLM protests marijuana dispensaries ludicrous ""examples"" heard. situations mass groups people sit next extended period time confined space. Oh thats great know phew!! Scientist #1 Top Secret COVID Testing Facility: Hey Karl, milk tastes funny! 
Scientist #2: Got dammit Steve! gotta conduct whole new test! 
Scientist #1(finishing drink burping loudly) Why? Herp derp.  -13 votes need income, probably people secure job give fuck lose job. saying....we shouldnt done anything? lockdowns shutdowns? 

there would MANY deaths.....  asking you. ranting Aussie. like fauci much next guy, reality we’ve never made successful coronavirus vaccine. better hope fauci right, he’s people pissed, say least. ""people time, means let's nothing....and let happen, way life""

you people make fucking sick want want Well, yes, except happened 75 years ago /s Alabama adult obesity rate 36.2%. it’s impossible get everyone comply, country 330 million it’s impossible. Especially people need work. Losing job business probably pressing Scientists saying months likely going second wave virus fall. people 4 months ago would coming alarming news saying wearing tinfoil hat believe pandemic less point.

It's vaccine approved, mass produced distributed worldwide, likely happen January 1st. argument. last thing need new wave anti-logic. brings valid point trying abdicate need form valid retort vague assertion anti vax sentiment okay. understandable degree, nobody expected would failures thing would dragging on..

But still, take moment sometime October, look numbers head poll. 200k dead Americans cannot forgotten admin cannot forgiven. Dangerous yes, extremely?...not you’re 60 (statistically, idgaf anecdotes lol) That’s shit it’s measly excuse garbage strategy didn’t work.

I live NYC, place near total compliance you’ll reasonably get. People over-comply. wear masks exercising alone middle field, wear shields, people scrub groceries like OCD extremist.

I can’t remember last time saw someone wearing mask grocery store. busy NYC streets still empty weekends. 

It’s months since told “if wear mask reopen.”

We “just” wore masks throughout baking heat, pretty much everyone. curve flat pancake yet reopening crawl — even threatened officials local idiots eager close infection rate rises even little.

Don’t pretend “not everyone hunkered down.” did. it’s “ohhhh well EVERYONE, better wait forever.” Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, arent poor countries?? ever travelled there??? Even richer countries like Argentina, Brazil Costa Rica poverty multiples higher Europe US. course wealthy areas spots Chile generally outlier damn TON poverty people can’t quarantine months sort reasonable fashion Latin America are, sunshine! 🌞 never been, luckily I’m now. Why, factually incorrect there’s social distancing mask wearing schools there?   eat anything prepare four months. figured could get takeout week. OK. prefer pandemic taught lot things thought would lost without really important much impact overall well-being. 

My biggest miss casually hanging friends.  must really unlucky always get order wrong cold. experience, never got order wrong cold ordered doordash 50+ times atleast. mean, Spain right yeah cuz getting ""im hero"" sticker legit psychos sooooo cool rewarding... Uhm pardon me, it’s always question: worry cold flu?

With common cold, much. contagious deadly.

With flu? Fuck yes! nuts? ever actually flu? People keep acting like flu big deal. week vomiting, muscle aches, high temperature, generally feeling like shit.

If going flu selfish asshole, like taking COVID seriously.

And that's top of, can't really compare them. there's vaccine flu, people danger dying get vaccine. flu contagious show symptoms. much less dramatic friend said day. 

She claims Canadian government arresting anyone without mask, grabbing streets putting secret undisclosed locations. thinks stay locations 'cleared'.

Swears saw legit article it, find send me.

She got mad said needed least start fining people refusing wear masks agreed secret maskless prisons bit much.

She also swears Covid 19 'released' allow secret Satanic end time group take habit questioning her. 

She bit nutty. Definitely. incentive would help rather hoping people comply sticking medical bills.  I’d love know it’s like living fantasy world pandemics like happen every year. Maybe fantasy world Sweden doesn’t one highest death rates. Boris broadcasting company?  Fucci Mane wouldn’t able afford work. barely savings since I’m school. need help Covid-fatigue.

Everyone much information/news coronavirus non stop months, people fed it.

In earlier days, smaller numbers deaths people outraged. tragedy. many countries hitting 30,000 dead, 200,000 dead, 60,000 dead people see think, ""Oh okay interesting"". massive numbers dead people become yet another statistic history. mention flu season start holiday shopping season. I'm walking corner store now, I'm totally buying bag feel bad used work downtown area city would go lunch frequently coworkers. would Happy Hours Thursdays go hit bar get beers Fridays would go grab team lunch together. It’s sad businesses thrives lunchtime office rush. haven’t set foot downtown months haven’t spent single cent restaurants, know I’m one thousands people hunkered away WFH scenarios need venture downtown parking limited. Coronavirus really shook society it’s core. serving &amp; bartending always one jobs seemed like would always there. Like luck don’t degree ? least wait tables serve drinks. nightlife dead. bouncers, bar tenders etc. bars closing, clubs closing. going send us really deep economic depression. Literally whole industries work. I'm defending them, like /u/salahelbat said, think say Trump's he's Russia downplays it. worse that, he's shown countless times innocent moron understand (the interview said downplayed willingly, example) - he's literally directly caused hundreds thousands deaths political gain.

IMO, that's much worse ignorant puppet blindly follows orders. Get fuck here. You’re yelling people mostly isolated failures government. you’re angry someone saying feel exhausted it. Guess shut turn feelings, right? Ahh see quarantined people only. understanding wasn’t everyone quarantine though usually money would’ve gone towards hotel fee since can’t quarantine home here. Regardless good thing Germany 10x population state number new daily cases. thank covid deniers keeping us spot countries moving on. Croatia Italy top summer vacation destination people austria germany reached car within decent time nearst sea beaches.
Wasnt usually though afaik many stayed austria 
Then many immigrants came work 90s relatives (all countries used Yugoslavia), visit stay weeks. Camping Steve anybody? could go wrong? CDC estimates around 61k influenza associated deaths 2017-2018 work part time? that’s 40k full time. last time Austria? ""Reports exposures restaurants linked air circulation,"" authors wrote. ""Direction, ventilation, intensity airflow might affect virus transmission, even social distancing measures mask use implemented according current guidance.""

So schools totally cool...right? says would shorter? Places enforced strict guidelines early enforcing cases spike up. 

The lockdown wasn’t meant short. wasn’t “go inside two weeks go away.” point flatten curve would last longer cases wouldn’t spike unmanageable level. Lockdowns don’t cure virus. Actual plans, testing, treatments vaccines do. 😃 i'd warmer fuzzier assistance trickling bank. I'm sure goes outside yard can. gets grocery delivery instead whatnot.

Poor gal video calls Drs special clinics several times trying figure what's going symptoms still having. - loss trust Federal Govt respected agencies weaponized political tools. Anything comes election must met skepticism important keep revenue operations open people earn living. everyone sit home monitor email collect. Hopefully uvc masks prove effective Wtf covid?!! Go spam reddit US’s Dr Anthony Fauci said lockdowns won’t necessary long people comply pandemic public health guidelines: masks public, social distancing, wash hands frequently well, avoid crowds. Germany cases rising since July still 10 dead per day.

Barely anyone dies anymore. husband decided back July *if* school person learning we’d pull oldest whose kindergarten I’d home school him. We’re fortunate I’m stay home mom anyway used teach elementary school really good position so. Luckily school hybrid didn’t send him, they’re mostly online. 

I’ve got friends posting first day school photos like “so excited Johnny gets go back school!” “Cindy can’t wait tomorrow gets see friends teachers again!” amount people know acting excited kids going back, despite horror stories news, staggering!! It’s one thing family absolutely cannot afford make distance learning work. unfortunate actual problem need address. excited sending elementary school student *back* school midst deadly pandemic??!? feel like don’t actually know people thought knew anymore. 

It’s exhausting try take things serious possibly see people around me, people used respect, flippant life death. makes want shut talk anyone. Yes, MOSTLY. Yet people still deal shit like wearing masks school social distancing, talks going back restrictions next week. original point still stands.  Even stable genius president knew virus extremely dangerous, are, still living denial. Someone updating database added something wrong field, instead creating child instance updated parent class.

When dealing large databases happen sometimes, doubt one ever happened website, due messed up, blown proportion. 


And even wasn't, covid-19 test kit RNA testing kit, even though called covid-19 testing kit, kit used test many diseases, therefore course existed covid became thing I've never life known anyone died flu. guy 2 blocks buddies parents died covid. woman gf used work lost father law.  talked 37 year old guy november. february vent week.  could keep going. Never ever pretend care mentally ill people EVER ignorant insensitive person!

You know what? You’re right. haven’t grown up! got sick 18 PTSD tried kill 3 times 21, need grow up! I’m still therapy 8 years later, needed grow up! 

I hope never someone shit struggles like this. I’m sick anyone coronavirus, can’t see that’s feel justified talking us like that. privileged neurotypical asshole don’t understand concept invisible illness. Get empathy. You’re understanding I’m saying. It’s still lot comforts say “ok let roll dice everything bloody revolution”. nowhere near “the worst things could be” therefore people simply aren’t nearly desperate enough actions. Put another way: aren’t leading armed revolution wealth distribution it’s obvious move? Three linked accounts??? That’s dumb think China controlling it, I've got bridge sell you. Wait two years protect coronavirus infection though? That’s important question Yes see downvoted comments.

The sub WANTS super deadly killer virus, know one degenerate fetish. Complete safety impossible standard utterly stupid strive for. never try involve coworkers extracurricular activities all. job architect software solutions teach younger developers write software principled mindset. requires communicate often. 

When switch jobs, job different people. We're going second wave Victoria numbers going 8 week lockdown winter over.  rough signs promising. Aren’t human ears unique human faces? commend staying inside know long-term contagion, brave responsible. 

On hand can't help wondering (as layman, medical professional) staying indoors quarantining long time could worsen long-term symptoms. need fresh air vitamin fight virus feel rested. Doctors used send chronic disease sufferers mountains ocean would feel better. 

I exhausted sometimes lockdown healthy individual, feel fully rested sunbathe, run, swim, climb outdoors before.  shutdowns especially contribute must political came change goal flattening curve max capacity Heath care system, attempt eradication.

This still popular post sub time, longer mood around here. Thank you, disease dangerous, shouldn’t lockdown forever, two friends already lost jobs, I’m doubting I’ll able get another I’m uni, Sweden didn’t lockdown low infection rate, IFR would’ve even lower didn’t let spread care homes like idiots. German city live ~~23~~ 30 active cases today.

Edited today's number. Honest question: worry cold flu? Please don’t say “you can’t compare them” don’t need exactly compare them. cold flu risk passing someone passes someone passes elderly person ends dying it. What’s different this? certain percentage risk death you’re ok risking people, decide it? guys need clean forest floors /s  good come destruction Amazon. Thanks clarity. Still great response government. Beats knowing thing far deadlier flu downplaying waiting absolute last moment react. there’s need worry go bars, clubs activities

Couldn't agree more, I'm glad neither dangerous restricted point. sure agree would ""dangerous countries"", sure places risk group. Remember, infection fatality rate 70 &lt;0.1%, point consider ""dangerous"" means Comparing pandemic killed close million worldwide flu.

[*Up 650 000 people die respiratory diseases linked seasonal flu 2017.

Do mean say one worse, one count? would certainly black white. point making comparing pandemics happen year, since lived happily unrestricted last year year before, good reason panic make one worse trying eliminate it. provincial government policy I'm joking about. family Quebec love province, especially Saguenay region. trumps version scorched earth tactics case loses. Shit place let Biden clean mess. Putin manages get installed another term Fox News got covered. Win win Trump minions basically. many people think dying per week right US right compared peak 2017-2018 flu season, hazard guess? uncommon homes small shops/bars, large shops, offices public buildings one.

The issue air-conditioning discussed quite lot. position Dutch medical authorities transmission mostly via droplets, aerosols. Air-conditioning expected problem normal systems, seems problem powerful systems found industrial plants. guess possible average systems places like Texas could use higher air velocities here, maybe could problem? Oh, late? knew US care, assumed western countries mask laws etc. now. Dr Anthony Fauci said in-person school reasonably safe places virus well controlled. Well sure terms x district pays district clear reading contracts hourly rates districts seemed pay less actually higher hourly since contracted hours fewer.
But know mean. Fuck mcrapey. hes cunt. absolutely discriminated against. Everyone got told fuck gatherings. could still zoom service Let’s hope actually works time scheme also work delivery apps? i've getting lot food delivered recently drivers seem super good social distancing zero-contact delivery. something November, seemed like walking pneumonia. almost fainted work. March, believe COVID four weeks, symptoms similar. tests available time. Uh oh, looks like troll getting hungry begging morsel, teeny tiny morsel.  
Sorry little troll, begging, bad troll! [Yep, completely totally unheard See edit. Sorry confusion. style lockdown

That boat sailed long long ago, afraid. Attack Titan Lots folks vaguely suggesting White House forcing hands this. Let’s talk that...

So assumption hundreds, thousands doctors administrators spent lives defending public health bend political pressure release something unsafe?

Good lord, ever trust people? trust November they’re willing now? Viruses also don’t give two shits feeble attempt control locking everyone houses.

See New Zealand places “eliminated” virus dealing new cases again. Hamburg (and states) school since beginning August, 2 weeks stick elsewhere ... I've seeing shared lot. Pretty incredible. thing surprises even surprised this. But... I'm voting Trump... want win again. Yeah think way, another 4 years shit, also burgeoning engineering, , infrastructure real-estate market couple hundred thousand US citizens decided vote feet.  really leave house shop lived place directions peoples' houses often include ""then turn paved road"". day someone reliably get order ice cream door cheaply run town, I'm gonna go hermit. feel same.  feel like Harris president within 4 years Biden wins...and like it. That's likely makes vote go there.

Dems needed new blood. Hillary strong base...but lot dems simply back her. felt like last election battle 2 awful options...so many said hey.. let's try something new. election much better...but many saying would rather try old way He’s getting downvoted Fauci like god sub CDC reporting single digit daily tests Feb,

...your wallet.

You thought going say c""your Character. Look white house. Character matter, silly. Emergency use group high risk exposure. 

Of course want vaccinate people don’t virus. 

Phase 1/2 trials results focusing dosage safety profile already published. 

Phase 3 ongoing results determine whether vaccine approved commercial use. 

The phase 1/2 results already published. I’m stunned heard it. 

There always balance risk benefit. absolutely spot psychological standpoint. brain like told wrong accepting wrong. It'll come different reasons actually right everyone else wrong, order protect ego. Hi damn Trump wave fuckimg magic wand already racist piece shit Speak state. Okay libs lost outraged must something eight Good luck. I'm fucking done country wins.    (Pasco) bars could open outside. also helped served food; one allowed inside. Schools open here, dozens kids sent home tested. 

Fact matter: eating drinking enclosed environment ensure get COVID someone already infected. means customers well staffers. 

Result: see spike cases 2 weeks, first Labor Day festivities, another week out, bars. urgent care closed treating anything COVID testing patients. Testing go 2 days week, 10 days. People panic, bringing entire families clinic. Schools may shut down. God knows, I'm sick stupidity. We'll get right... there's small enough population US it'll impossible infect another person. That's herd immunity right? 

/s Also, think people “staying outside more” reduce cases. need stay inside avoid people best cases going mate. wild type (i think M) spread China. That's good answer! idea..............nah, that's crazy talk.  want complacency bank people showing polls. Every time see report far Biden want thrown window. isn’t anything. People need vote, doesn’t fucking matter favored is. India, states right enforce, center give guidelines, state chief ministers went zoom, made agreements taskforce 2 days discussion national set guidelines agreed follow. 

Authority political power leadership well. lol.

Americans: ""We've tried nothing we're ideas"" here. That's know. NFL fine 12k fans opening night chiefs-texans game /s  worse leader calls hoax suggests people drink bleach. One thing people need consider Sweden social distancing already kind part culture. 
There's joke Swedes can't wait corona 2m distancing end go back usual 5m distancing. 3 trillion dollars would like 6 grand stimulus. agreed stimulus can't bill stimulus? media done poor job reporting states highest numbers infections rather highest rates per capita. surprise populous states cases reporting mostly really misled lot people smaller population states rural areas think coronavirus something happening somewhere else.  too. specifically would doctors convinced forsake oath? give realistic idea thing happens, maybe I’d concerned hell catch cold masks social distancing? literally close impossible could right now. would highly recommend trying get Iowa. returned Colorado unfortunately graduated jobs. used Colorado even tho things open, everyone wore mask everywhere. It’s really awful surrounded level stupidity point don’t feel safe leave home groceries states feel safe normal everyday things going store. It’s sad Iowans turned going grocery store unattainable luxury refusal wear masks. Imagine spent whole life trying save people get big middle finger face. Seriously. I’ll miss tradition, stoned ass floor playing nieces nephew dogs... part won’t miss hubbub bad attempts idle chit chat. Florida fun? Yes. accurate, read scientists believed mutation happened Italy, least first detected. definitely made way across Europe. time social media shows well received internationally dad died last year. born, worked, lived till death NYC. peak made $55K year. owned home, new car, raised 3 kids kept us fed, clothed, entertained salary.  


You kids need learn budget is. decision doesn’t affect you. You’re choosing put others risk. CDC website it, google excess deaths cdc pop Yeah mean generally trust guy, contradicted quite bit pandemic even big time frame.

Like thing, it’s like suddenly vastly new information distributing vaccine likelihood people take make change stance “summer 2021 latest” “probably end 2021”, he’s record saying things. *University Snowvid-19 Moms forties. That's super young. Hah, mine disowned let slip got rumor mill particularly enjoy Fox News blaring TV Christmas dinner. never imagined good Christmas dinner could taste without well bitten tongue. knew man Nantucket ... commute gotten much shorter, thanks Donald Trump /s asks anyone else Covid, student responds, “They it.”

Well, maintain house bubble, guess house party. [only 4? staying indoors - gathering indoors, family events indoor dining. Indoor environments 19 times riskier outdoors. conversation outdoors mask distancing *still* safer indoors conversation mask distancing. don’t 6 months wearing mask around ppl then? Immune system working?  limit food intake I'm poor. True sir true Trump outpacing previous 2 presidents bombs dropped, walked away allies bolstered Russian strongholds so, really fallen flat promise ending wars.

Sure...no new active combat though. Yay...i guess  time. Coupled inflation, property taxes ways city / state hits much profit margin days. can't even sell without buying another rental property take even bigger hit taxes, can't even sell profit despite fully paid off. Illinois run criminals. AZ US NIH said much. related, minimum current vaccine tossed. Well, correct I'm wrong, impression live food well pass ingestion. remove everything take-out containers door, go straight trash bin outside, include utensils napkins use own....I think we're pretty safe there? mean, look woman’s inability wear face mask correctly article... First time depressed general stupidity Americans? Welcome club. numbers surprising anymore... infected spread anyone else already validated. Keep safe! VOX intention describe China suspicious way. USA ever get numbers down. nation people like told do. Govt take control either. Throw towel let things run course Yes grocery stores make food free help hardships too. Also cancel car payments it. Oh right cool. like tape anything. Yes think majority people wear masks. much. went gas station day. 13 us there....I one wearing masks. Everywhere go significant numbers folks wearing masks, social distancing. need higher level compliance get control. know getting downvoted, said holds true many whether skeptic hardliner Isn’t Jan 21, 2020 COVID gets cancelled? Nov 4? Florida human being, would /r/FloridaMan think revenge French supporting 9/11. Never forget freedom fries. think getting back normal largely political decision It'll take least 3 month lockdown order cases reduce, reality speaking. lol sorry

At point, people *will* stop putting shit going lives, won’t able stop them. They're still researching exactly works, here's pretty solid research paper profoundly anti-inflammatory impair many Ca2+-dependent enzyme systems central inflammatory cell-autonomous antiviral responses. viral-induced host responses lead immunopathology, seen rodent model multiple sclerosis, TMEV-IDD, persistent infection central nervous system caused non-lytic virus, BDV, cannabinoid treatment beneficial.""

That said, admit cannabinoids also detract health certain viral circumstances, need time figure out. sadly election change leadership day after, got wait months grown ups charge. circle jerk event contributes making echo chamber. echo chamber surounded circle jerking coming (if all) angles. Uh, no. cancelled season. ""The best yet come!"" US like one kid whenever gets told something, goes “I don’t wanna 😡” family blame. tried get take thing seriously dont deserve tbh, Americans smartest continue prove time time again.   must get vote out, matter outcome need get busy trying make things better, stop. executive branch deciding. 10th amendment. Comments like really show undervalued education political system is.

In essence, whatever given Federal Government constitution left States. That's we're called United States America. Responsibility political focus state leaders criminally underrated. 

Don't get wrong though, Federal government still role play. seems many people see simply Trump's fault. Thinking like fix problem. voting power due electoral college state level local officials. Cuomo moving elderly back nursing homes great example important. gonna pretend something like I'm sure. thing used destroy country Trump, history books forget that. bars got food licenses around open month. Social unrest one factor's Trump failing at. include seditious candidates even hoops must jumped think LA county would voted R virus control measures. virus control measures state piss half people like overjoy do. like someone say ""damn, hate governor so, he/she right virus thing. think i'll vote him/her next year"" see national polling well, people like president support virus measures, like disagree virus measures. we’re lucky closest shithole country Newsom, leader nation-state California. isn’t great, either. *am* challenging assumption that’s I’m asking credible information idea CDC this, may worth read you. case isn't, symptoms COVID-19 flu similiar, COVID-19 cause blood clotting. Further, COVID-19 ""more contagious among certain populations age groups... [the virus] quickly easily spread lot people result continuous spreading among people time progresses."" COVID-19 ""has observed superspreading events flu.""

COVID-19 spreads quicker, dangerous, fewer methods treatment flu, yet vaccine. Despite similarity symptoms, COVID-19 dangerous flu. still can't believe deny covid... yeah, we're fucked rate. :( one highly propagandized countries history, well one spied upon. intense divisiveness design. given corporate bailout, unless would need stop trading. Otherwise, employee furloughs would stopped starving becoming homeless *and* ease burdens company's keeping payroll. kidding, they'd fire immediately without furlough much burden. not? almost intentionally downplayed ravaged areas coincidentally heavily populated political rivals.. 

Now made way base, suddenly cares *a little*. sent check back, would dishonest this? many people think would honest it?

I know grandma think would. makes think everyone else would be?

How many people think would honest... people? people chomping bit risk criminal charges vote twice country 330 million many instances voter fraud states tried smaller scales. want jump nationally think work?

Ah yes, ""many instances"" voter fraud people always bring curiously one ever elaborates demonstrates widespread capacity. seen like one town New Jersey everyone mentions.

What's stopping someone requesting absentee ballot dead person thing? Nobody ever issue suddenly sending ballot mail awful method even though literally president votes. 

This baseless, silly fearmongering. really think people sending ballots dead people widespread thing that's going change election?   Go literally site tracks numbers. Click 7 day. Now, realize letting hate Trump completely blind facts.

Just like accuse others doing.

Edit: Here, I'll help you.

[14 day change, 4th, 7 day moving average 42k new cases. Now, 36k REMEMBER NEVER COMPARE COVID FLU UNLESS FITS NARRATIVE! lol dude you’re going say said something least able show proof empty stands wife. Plus probably gets tested every day. Good, know study correct cherry picked see nearly repeat infections are.

That takes cares whether lying ignorance malice. malice way. least admitted it. respected ""lockdown flatten curve""

That point shutdowns. emergency measure control outbreaks, buy time, allow soft reset. 

Flattening curve mask wearing, social distancing, working home, closing high risk businesses, etc. prevent massive outbreaks.

The problem current measures working large parts country going sufficient winter. Interesting, (and expected) weak really. 
Its lot guessing. mean Trump closest real world Jay Gatsby. reminds Dr. Valery Legasov, character/person HBO series Chernobyl. real person, tried warn everyone scale severity disaster literally charts, needed responded such. Stop asking stupid questions already know answer. States getting better completely shut borders states. 'NO! say?!' - Nicolas Cage meme, comes mind, again. *All left* personal fact checking, since certain side political spectrum successful getting people lose trust government press. dated March.

 Germany 8

There enough evidence prove wearing surgical mask significantly reduces healthy person's risk becoming infected wearing it. According WHO, wearing mask situations recommended create false sense security might lead neglecting fundamental hygiene measures, proper hand hygiene.

 USA 6

Centers Disease Control Prevention recommend people well wear face mask (including respirators) protect respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.
US Surgeon General urged people Twitter stop buying face masks.

 1

If healthy, need wear mask taking care person suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Well maybe telling people mask back Feb/Mar could stopped thing back instead going national TV telling people masks aren’t necessary. Go tracking site. Click 7 day average. Look data. 

It matter one, trending almost 2 months. means, tell me... correctly prescribe guidelines problem requires information developing research? discredit guy, least say would overcome challenge. Second wave? government gets money back lot more. People pay pack increased taxes time. 

That argument, point.

It's return investment. like government ended money national highway system cost build. return investment. would ideal situation - infect everyone endemic cronoviruses. (Un)surprised isn’t ‘thing’ guess there’s much money (same using phages antibiotics) Already babes. means support Doug Ford, listen experts, stood people country. hoping starting turn leaf time legitimate candidate Ontario. would good consider Europe single country ""central european government"" US results countries 12k cases single day others 1000-2000. Italy can't tell France act covid two different countries. 

US, hand, single country central government could direct strategy covid reduce cases and... yeah, that's working. isn’t. See: Sweden Hey dont call nation phobic slur! messaging could ever get people don’t wear mask Trump told to.

The day heard rally making fun Biden “have ever seen someone loves masks much?”

It’s utterly hopeless reason cultists, avoid like plague beg loved ones same. Positive thinking Reddit even remotely representative country. Nobody likes Biden he's terrible candidate, Trump closed poll numbers upwards 10 points recently (God knows how) liberal echo chambers anecdotally make seem everyone hates Trump, chances election close Trump good chance repeating. Americans dont favor 1 term presidents. Wondering I'll get downvoted daring bring lol. good chunk passive current ""I want guy gets someone infected"" also noticed uptick since grocery stores stuck large signs outside saying masks mandatory like august's end. Hahaha fuck that? He's fighting get establishment candidates elected lining pockets....

You need SERIOUS reality check. Yeah, feel area live opening Schools person learning cause much worse situation. blame solely lie Trump. think many states many uninterested cretins want pretend there's virus. way, much excellent other. Honestly though, expect country makes money sick people. understand. must 1 month plus ago, unless I'm misunderstanding.
If one cases dropping, fits 1 cases rising. Cases rising while, possibly going 1.  Sounds like work Italian research lab honestly. Scientists supposed assume worst, point scientific method. people writing grants probably do.

You mentioning ""set point"" titer, yet admit openly know nCoV's properties. arguing socio-political policy, instead sticking strictly fact, instead ""expert opinion.""

Stay lane please. Another factor strain virus circulation. one US early started west. strain hit Italy contagious one hit New York. spread fast comparison. Thank you. trying get many points across Church. seems like sharing Gospel point brought matter many. 

I trying get ""my"" Church (I seriously considering finding new church, around like that)to see showing love Christ. brought many Biblical points pastor even give straight answer why. arguments like ""but go back normal eventually, might well go back normal now."" pushed came essentially ""but perfect, cant expect always right."" showed pastor knows wrong continues anyway. That’s problem, people haven’t locked half year, we’ve selectively shut parts country state state (and often county county) basis nothing slow stop spread. never mandatory 2 week quarantine like countries, never controlled spread disease. Hell, people around country even went vacation fucking spring break partied, we’ve locked slightest. thought loved “personal freedom”

As ""I personally freedom whatever fuck want consequences"". Yea people complain idiot America, CDC throwing points zero riots though  guy maths Thanks telling something already knew, thanks! Fair point.

CDC guidelines many things. 

They feel targeted individuals businesses rather part national response. 

I'll concede point though. guidelines. 

Which pisses even means needed leadership enforce/promote adoption. Exactly, around anyone, issue go vote person.... That's true though. know far many people personally engage politically thanks media defend trump regardless negatives. I’d quit he’s tried reasoning crazy administration. really commend trying. Trump re-elected November honestly give up. Biden means candidate need he’s candidate lesser two evils. AOC run 2024 god hope wins. need AOC. Yeah. Also, think since long distance travel really option Europeans decided travel regionally. know France really popular tourist destination, Paris Cote d'Azur. 

I think we're also starting experience lockdown fatigue. I'm New York City, lot family France honestly seems like normal summer many people there. Hopefully see many deaths. death rate France pretty bad (Yes know US citizen one talk) still. Herd immunity going happen everywhere eventually, that's basically vaccines for. 

Also, whole ""Sweden's going herd immunity!!!"" basically myth, unless also think Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China, South Korea going herd immunity route well. Uh huh sure I'm sure knew without doubt say cover party imagine that? Challenge assumption.. something makes think case? previous experience something? widely misreported misunderstood. comorbidities included things like pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart failure. would caused virus cases.  6% cases covid thing coded death certificate. watched Contagion last night. could literally documentary Covid. blame depressed honestly poor guy sane man madhouse filled monkeys high nitrus oxyde.

And people listen monkeys hin. see two little humps. waves.


No, aren't. describing shape first wave, every country due long incubation outbreak events. waves even measured death rate, measure new cases. even looking right data spread misinformation.

A complete wave would show tracking extremely low new **cases** extended period time crest. 2016 party valued lulz leadership.  interested see whether that’s still case months here. Child Like Eyes? Try Cuba, ya imbecile.

This make sense. saying Cuba ""control information""?

Are really gonna claim communist countries ones manipulate statistics? really much baby? Unfortunately US big different weather. hot AZ us going outside unless early late day. excuse piss-poor attempt leadership slightest. Nice try. 

The CDC already telling people wear masks beginning April. Trump first wore mask July. late mid-June, Trump still adamantly masks, claiming people wearing masks show disapproval him. Behold, *un*reasonable. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  Lol insulted 90% reddit  sent check back, would dishonest this? many people think would honest it?

And many instances voter fraud states tried smaller scales. want jump nationally think work? appear strategy lol problem Trump's devotees vote people complain sit election too. so, spread would delayed 1-2 weeks (until gets passed parents/grandparents). Given school started month ago, know sure (at most) ~2 weeks... dont think real danger either exploding worldwide pandemic. could wrong. US still failed handled Yes. “Oh, wearing mask?? Scared covid everywhere huh??” “Hurhurhur”. Rural Wisconsin. available evidence suggests Covid deaths actually under-reported. 

 

Get ""mUh 6%"" nonsense here. work hospital. Yeah, care. Every competent adult does. lol yeah? Ask Sweden going without lockdowns. Extremely well.

By way, that's right. 28 million reported cases. There's probably tens millions reported. virus massive nothingburger. 

Also, world population 7.5 billion that's 0.37%. less 1% die.

That's afraid of. Better brave moron like they, though? doubt it. Sorry, gotta give trillions banks corporations, nothing little peasant They're still weeks away reaching point one person died every thousand population. countries Europe go second wave. US never ended first.

Also, US MUCH higher per capita death count compared European Union. even ballpark really. European Union (including UK) 360 deaths per 1 million inhabitants, US sports whopping 588. God love you. Awesome reply Definitely Russian one. Willing try Oxford one, though. Lots people die blame Fauci, despite warning everyone right happen.  actually never given formal name it, told set symptoms caused single defective nerve. closely resembles WPW. It’s complex it’s true. Currently far COVID response goes they’re beating us everywhere.

As point out, entitled Americans trying sneak around rules isn’t helping view us all. even trying say comment? ever deny lot people died? didn’t even mention wasn’t relevant saying. Compared April, yes. Compared month half ago, no. rise real yet nearly bad spring. Yet. cut salaries know people govern going through. fear enough money pay rent, internet, phone bill, car payments food feed families. desperate begging help, EXACTLY us. Say ""Oh scared family home? bad, fighting like children right busy name calling finger pointing, figure yourselves""

Let's see fast move.

Never life disgusted disappointed government. overweight person contracts Covid 19 teaching home. Article fear-mongering mean ""superiority complex"" statement? context, nearly countries handling better US pissed paddling backwards. ""complex"".  Czechia, seen smaller outbreaks really schools , instructed wear masks yesterday hallways still major outbreaka weird way say then, seemed imply option dining masked.  

But yes, agree you.  Looks overweight, curious know diabetes conditions would cause this. CDC state people likely die virus comorbidities  Remember Trump suggested issuing federal Lockdown New York said authority &amp; would sue?

Such relationship Federal &amp; State governments.

If endow said powers, imagine shitshow complaining way too.

He cANt tHaT!!!! tHInk eVErYonE sUFFeR nAtIOnAl LOcKdOwN!!!!!! thinking might something fact almost everyone Sweden vaccinated swineflu-vaccine couple years ago.. pandemic disappeared though. mention boo’ing moment silence unity. Fuck every single person game, knuckle dragging morons   However, way easier get excess fructose processed foods raw fruits 

So likely initial comment Let guard one freaking time since March went family party. family sick gotta get tested. Paywall. party goers know they've exposed? Without fully understanding possible permanent long lasting debilitating effects would argue reckless unwise knowing expose oneself virus potentially cause life altering damage ones body. anyone thinks 20 year old make responsible selfless decisions beyond me. Exactly! I’m hunkering down. Sorry! Crossposting mind fitting image here. doomin gloomin depressing projection? need go things huge winter sports person experienced short season year really want outlet again. Well record least happening recently 30 years ago Romania. communist, middle class, poor people. Essential foods rationed, groceries stories mostly empty (not would've matter one money buy anything). dad showed pictures grocery stores time haunting see signs produce shelves bins empty. people revolted 40 years shit. dictator Ceausescu gave botched speech military finally decided join Civil protestors, lead Ceausescu successfully tried sentenced death crimes people. time countries also going revolutions own. stop close idiots Maybe psychotic deplorable. Narrator: mistake Lmfao right concept 24/7 news/social media real true lurking problem much society: school shootings, growing division country, everyone kind accepted. get overload information, harden brain like said. last decade, every single depressing thing able spread quickly diligently next big depressing things get spread around thanks things like Twitter Reddit. possible things like newspaper. print media, used collection stories country day (that sometimes negative positive) till next day. regular TV news, even 24/7 first. get information 9 PM 3 AM. creates almost false illusion time world screwed appears news negative 99% time. People discuss year worst year ever, hell no, humanity way worse, 24/7 media creates illusion bleaker appears report positivity (it get clicks likes). People talk example, crime way worse 90s today. people like say worse ever been: no. worse information everything single detail crimes around country spewed 24/7. People arguing police worst today? HA, criminal justice much screwed 25-30 years ago compared today (which yes still needs lot improvements). Yet another illusion 24/7 media. Social media negatively made us adapt. statement get downvoted, question would happened coronavirus occurred say 10-15 years ago? feel like entire country maybe entire world would treating differently (whether less restrictions it'd vastly different). Virtually nobody discuss true issue 24/7 media, we've adapted using daily. indirect root much malice, paranoia, division country. also everything politicized becoming involved aspects society that's 24/7 media spewing point. people like, share, follow, yell like blind robot. Conservative, Republican, Democrat, Liberal, matter, 24/7 media machine pulling strings.

This statement kind scattered know social media/ 24/7 news small blessing major curse world. sure second surge unless happen half 100 million Americans willing wear mask spread alll place like butter - omg that's exactly like America. Huh. thought pulled serious information hat. Canada taking slower pace mask thing second wave us already 40% less likely happen Reaaaaallllyy says trust her. 1% death rate 10 000 cases, 100 deaths end. 

We almost 30 deaths per day France, bit low incoherent daily cases numbers registered 3 weeks ago. ehhh i'll wait study literally country Eat ground glass weaselly POS. Justice coming, count that. Confusing though said London one point cases apparently back rising exponentially r rate 1. 
We got hit really bad ""first wave"". reflecting now, surely offered us protection/padding. 


Everything's confusing official exist Jan 20 2021 Soooooo ratchet...... Usually Simpsons future-seers one South Park nailed. 
*Giant Wall Canada/US border Mountie top* 
""Sorry, boot Canada closed eh? Kindly fuck off."" Apart click-baity, seems like ""good thing.""

You public health guy bemoaning fact tests accurate enough. seems like kind thing worried about.

Fast inaccurate? bad

Slow accurate? better, still crappy

He wants fast, accurate test. won’t country selfish assholes don’t give shit anyone us. Save “BeSt CoUntRy wOrLd” bullshit one thing painfully true last 4 years especially year, it’s we’re country full nationalist narcissistic dipshits ignore basic science instead choose radical internet conspiracy theory’s Facebook posts. eating home cooked food since March. worth socialising eating get sick He’s already it’s working. I'm hoping masks measures cold flu cases hopefully way year. favorite thing world refusing let people ambulance without mask. Call 911 3am wake wanna try bullshit way dilaudid loser junkie, bothered wear mask give you? Fucking CYA! power trip, care.


That and, earlier gym today someone came lift gloves gown on. People extra shit. Yesterday someone p100 on. That's happens executive branch decides anything leave states different strategies. ever need centralized leadership now. he's failing us spectacularly. parallels parenting striking, telling. Nah seem pretty pissed people keep sneaking saying they're going Alaska end Alaska. think safe say superiority complex American means own. think things could gone differently. Better communication intentions would made big dent slowing things down. Obama wasn’t expert- delegated lot experts, almost fault. 


Donald’s February March messages accelerated spread. April messages set divide entire country- politically, socially, industry wise. 


Trump put burden responsibility governors- sure they’re responsible they’d appreciate federal guidelines. got point NY threatened war. 


Donald socially set patriotic, realistic, strong, antihoax fight. attacked experts learning. 


Donald also butchered industry knows business. 3M, Honeywell, others know failure cheat always been. isn’t spreading much among us, I’m glad isn’t. 

Compared germany Sweden deathtrap comes Coronacases/death count.

According to[Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource **86505** (11th September 2020) cases Covid and

**5846** deaths.

Doesnt sound much, realize Sweden population 1**0.3 million (25 per sqmile)**, thats lot.

Atm **0.84%** swedes got virus **0,057%** swedes died. also **6.76%** deathrate count got corona aka 6.76 100 sick people die.

&amp;#x200B;

Now look Germany.

**259137** cases

**9348** deaths

population **83,17** millions (232 per sq mile)

**0.312%** germans got virus **0,011%** died. means 3,61% got sick also died.

Germany **8** times larger population, almost **10 times higher densitiy** population way fewer cases corona deaths comparision size pupulation.

In fact, death rate sweden almost doubled. Trump finished culling expensive health insurance liabilities. leader would need say exact opposite needed done chance people it. Ehhh hunker say?.....Yeah people area acting like pandemic over. False alarm.. everyone get life, business usual. 

The local highschools getting ready homecoming, planning game day, parade dance, know parties kegs. still plan annual fall cider festival. community groups organizing Halloween parties community trick-or-treating events. even get started community Thanksgiving dinner community center VFW. Also, Helen planning massive Christmas eve party place.  conclusion draw data? That's sad :( worked..? terrorist attack USA ever since airports/planes full morons certain side political spectrum believe science, wear masks, etc. dopechez already said really rough time us California. Ok - many days? work 250 paper - like 260 count forced unpaid overtime discretionary unpaid overtime.

If she’s unhappy job get another one. anything numbers worse(accurate) if/when Biden office initially, unless successful vaccine then. Went Mexican restaurant 2 weeks ago get go order. 3 tables occupied, one tables elderly couple probably COVID. repeatedly coughing, loud hacking type coughs. Yet sat eating chips salsa, completely ignoring “If symptoms please don’t enter” signs. want become zombies.

In seriousness, I'd bet majority people vaccine want sure safe effective. Basically Germanic countries clean civil. Got it. Thanks. That’s odd way write way “forty 100 people” looks odd fuck as. problem ignoring pandemic. Even reopen every business full capacity, enough people like us go. Businesses going experience around 50% loss demand regardless legally open. fair, Fauci power authorize something like he's kind odds people point. No, doesn’t sound dumb perhaps simple minded people like you. Getting tested voluntarily think kids care symptom two? mandated every kid gets tested every would completely different story. Thanks. Rare serious side effects usually characterised 1 10,000. 2 10,000 would considered borderline.
I would think ‘1 10,000’ general, also don’t know whether directly related medication vaccine. hardly ever possible prove cause effect like this. rely statistics. I’m sure enrol people pre existing conditions only. Proud champ. wonder - even Obama someone else utter joke leader charge, ever actually shot getting things relatively control month two, whole country?

The best shot would relatively reasonable *Republican* leader like Romney type. repubs would listen guy, democrats would listen science. 

There's way right would listen Obama Democrat president, obviously see went Trump. husband lost parents cancer snd brother died lung problem 2017. past years sucked ass. TOILET PAPER!! /s Schools opened Germany months ago. one ""oppressed"". purest form hyperbole. appreciate family vaccinated agree maintaining critical thinking avoiding blind trust important always, especially time.

I want note Oxford vaccine developed employees Oxford Vaccine Group/Jenner Institute..they necessarily Oxford grads. prestige comes program’s history, affiliation university. taking side want point things.

If guy saying “let indoor dining stay” come back “no” something better fire “how know certain?” say goes reason. Provide something comes belittling argument someone else making. 

Same gym. saying spread data you’re saying “yes huh” data way it’s coming off. Tbh I'm pretty sure people actually thought remember Brody last one standing well. clamped beginning. instead fucking around downplaying actually listening advisors. prolly could kept fairly decent control. wealth inequality, healthcare, minimum wage. 

Do How's Trump....oh countries fire, 200k dead him, we've never divided, debt...... 

I health care nationality. care happens rest you. brought charges.. sure fitting intentional endangerment / attempted mass murder seems appropriate Yup pretty much. see positivity rate mostly augus

Literally showed Also, first major spike “useless timeframe”?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Camp Fire 2018 live Chico. devastating. I'm ready move I'm poor there's pandemic... got downvoted brought fact still 1st wave like month ago.

I presume gets death threats normal :/ Depends live. Hunkering Chicago easy winter ... it’ll damn cold. We're conditioned unfortunately. taught American dream real, free country world, imperialism ""fighting freedom"", voting important (which isn't), failures work life(mental illness, addiction, savings, etc)is 100% fault. 

So still lot people still believe country/system blindly support whichever party chose. candidate keeps getting worse every election, yet they'll continue preach important vote guy bad one. top mainstream media properly report lot people lost. still better places gatherings allowed almost everything open. Yet another thread Australian saying kinds incorrect things make sound awful. Austria well better most! We're numb human hardships. remember earthquake disaster devastates country area would unite would donate help much can. minimum victims knew many around world caring struggle. 

The overload news hardships desensitizes us, human. look covid death charts get less emotional look financial chart shows us losing 10 dollars.

I ashamed myself, wtf happened, someone able shed tear disasters like stone cold robot clicking story story. wonder excess deaths look like year? Must crazy high. response non-anecdotal facts though? stupid fucking argument one stuff flu fucking imbecilic. anyone good link explains Germany much less impacted virus? scoped fave restaurant yesterday. outdoor area actually looks pretty good. soooo tempted. look cases/1M pop deaths/1M pop India near #1. agree raw numbers India country # cases, infections, deaths etc etc.. theres also many people living there, even compare countries? know unbelievably bad even therapists falling apart. Yeah. honestly struggle accountability social media companies is. Obviously anti vax shit cancerous hard time still. social media space replaced town square essentially public forum. Facebook deciding allowed scary. I’m glad Twitter much much lesser extent fb calling provable lies. much combat misinformation. perspective, that’s 9/11 every 3 days.....and two 9/11’s every week.

Stay strong people know still distancing immediate family (parents, sister, in-laws). leeway we’ve made pandemic loosening indoor hesitations immediate family members know aren’t anything risky. still limit hour, stay outside it’s nice, keep distance possible. agree, want make complicated. Or: like Finland Denmark. trump downplayed it, administration fought blocked efforts combat STILL IS! kids school hired daytime cleaner goes around school day high touch surfaces. Also kids wipe desks arrive leave. kid sounds obnoxious hell.  Whenever someone provides stat don’t like answer also claim they’re lying. works great kindergarten attend. never mask. Social life pretty much dead. rest world?  thought trump telling states ready November vaccine?  
  
  
Edit: yup, trump.   
   
  
Fauci saying differently: 100% support message, may true depending live.

In Iowa, example, Republican governor small government advocate Kim Reynolds overrode local school districts' ability make decisions regarding reopening in-person schooling.

You know, really demonstrating fucking hypocrital psychopath represents member party. US numbers likely due less testing. Plus fact thr US leads world cases deaths think current measures maintained indefinitely.  can’t compare death count Covid flu methods counting two differ much.

No doubt people US died Covid past, talking current situation terms counting deaths causes per week, way don’t problem using different methods counting Covid flu deaths.

The flu also cause long term complications well, lot people know that. It’s 6 months now. FaceTime zoom hardly replacements human interaction. thanksgiving Christmas people get together it’ll mean much year. Given two possibilities, that’s going happen. government finally says safe wear masks anymore, I'll still wearing mine least 6 months that. Except recall list hand sanitizer made wood alcohol. stuff blind you. incorrect reading authors' findings. [read see p-value question 0.86; words failed significance testing.

That means failed find difference, ""masks effective."" However, authors *did* make Among 107 participants 
who reported dining restaurant 21 participants 
reported going bar/coffee shop, case-patients less 
likely report observing almost patrons restaurant 
adhering recommendations wearing mask social 
distancing (p = 0.03 p = 0.01, respectively).

Don't spread misinformation.  US, week got free flu shot CVS $5 gift card 👍 study covers masks found percentage similar control. also asked person small indoor gathering recently found number similar. I’m 25, parents (inadvertently) trained hunker due parents’ fears ADHD impulsivity (I kept home life, that’s developed distinct personal cultural identity formative years; basically got pop punk internet then-undiagnosed autism solidified identity second). 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I’m used playing video games stave boredom anxiety serve fulfill instant-gratification nature happiness, and, I’m used talking friends online (as IRL interactions quickly burn out; I’m rocket jet airliner comes sustained IRL social interaction) best time plant tree...

But yeah, venn diagram covid deniers people strong safety net probably close perfect circle. Socialism objectively wrong. kids back college spreading like crazy, younger kids school, everyone know taking seriously finally weddings, taking vacations, eating out...I’m really surprise numbers Worldometer low are. Either virus become less virulent, numbers longer accurate. like fauci. man dude always coming bad news. Doctors never tell u good things. get it. all
The time fauci STOP FUCK worry, dear leader grace us another stimulus check last us rest year despite barely covering one month's rent. Look much people didn’t follow prohibition despite law. act like every country amazing. New Zealand, ever praised model lockdowns back lockdown cases, South Korea faces rises cases. dare exhausted?! psychopath? basically Hitler feeling completely ok situation, I’m hero calling social media it. /S Chronic pericarditis develops slower tends devoid sharp pain. Dull, achy pain instead, according Google. Fortunately, pretty benign, miserable. I'm obviously expert position pain cannot attributed organ. scoured 3D model thought lungs initially, lung test came back fine. Additionally ""not leaning back"" action puts strain pericardium honestly painful thing do, rounding back.

I feel like heart attack many days though, flares. amount times googled heart attack symptoms past six months high. Aspirin made feel better made stomach hurt, stopped caused worst flare up. There's literally evidence back up. Covid killing far people. complete bullshit.

The economy going recover covid gone. People going go shop eat feel safe. That's fact. people fucking grew dealt reality instead fantasy could gotten worst now. That’s exact opposite what’s happening. many deaths enough you? He’s skewing results favor though, plus Florida higher pneumonia deaths year/ last year year &amp; likely could attributed COVID-19. area, waited see happened elsewhere deciding whether push kids schools. gave parents choice school, homeschool, mix.

After seeing virus spread kill schools elsewhere, they’ve announced gradually push kids back schools.

In area, don’t like mask mandate, nobody enforce unless kind business specifically named one would fined. wanted wait see even got bad enough worry about.

With elders dropping dead like flies hot summer day new cases skyrocketing, they’ve announced won’t enforce mask mandate.

That tough fall winter exactly hoping for. Trump’s people figured it’s genocide long admitted it, they’re still part help get done.

These people morons. sure Covid worse 2017-2018 flu season, peak, right now? talking total deaths, methods determining number flu deaths Covid deaths different. Yeah I've cancelled gym membership year. Therapists probably feeling acutely, one unusual aspects pandemic everyone world dealing time, there’s nobody clear-headed enough pick emotional slack anyone else. usual healers overwhelmed stressors causing trauma people need healing. That’s usually works. Yes holidays, lot population movement.
The situation surprise all, spent time french riviera August, went restaurant once, waiters mask chin owner going table table mask all. Also streets would say 50% people wearing mask. saw went first time. loans meant small businesses went millionaires instead.

And Congress approved more. There's 134B still pot.

If needed loan, could get one. Texas bars open sell food alcohol effectively became ""restaurants"" 95% people dying Covid 70+ pre-existing conditions. Old sick people dying happened pre covid continue happen post covid.

The reason people freaked covid new phenomenon. 3M people die US every year one bats eye 200k old sick people die covid bozo wants lock us indoors 2 years. thanks. What's ventilation situation German schools? know one person died flu, 0 died COVID. Anecdotes fun allow conclude almost anything!  lot poor really fucking dumb really fucking racist happily blame immigrants brown people average much poorer blaming billionaires money could spend 10 lifetimes.

Sick political correct it. blame bunch poor people lack resources go around billionaires, dumbass. racism making it, vast majority them, racist dumbass. feel zero sympathy you. take genius realize maybe blaming people everything makes sense blaming people nothing that's do. They'd rather blame people look different. Gretchen Whitmer, sold soul devil. doubt that, viruses mutate once, happens virulent strain appears becomes common. way likely we've got better treating covid patients discoveries drugs treatments work better. would nice documentary made show schools Germany, methods using avoid spread. 
What would even interesting, would compare schools across globe. Perhaps bits pieces various scenes could used help others. know one size fits all, start Germans follow rules closely. specifically greater proportion Germans so. Plus better organised, test earlier contain earlier generally efficient preventive measures Sweden extremely low contact culture everyone intelligent enough wear masks, widespread accessible healthcare, more. 

They're need lock far lower Next weeks story, ""Los Angeles megachurch held indoor services anyway, one anything it"" 28 days economy ravaged even poor people worse place. Small Businesses closed big box corporate stores remaining. virus come back you’ll blame whatever scapegoat find. Redditors believe HARDER lockdown better. may delay cases many suicides occur? Cancer treatment delays? harm people it’ll save Rationale give single consistent message across UK... Despite Scotland different policies laws, different NHS system, different government.

The BBC really mouthpiece days. probably 100 years lobbying propaganda brainwashed Americans thinking public healthcare workers rights communism. still listen him. Listening mean agreeing, means paying attention. Like not, says still going affect us, makes sense know said rather everybody says said. Lot's parents pieces shit care kids. predict EVERYONE reading past month seen parent walking children, even parent mask on, kids not. help get mad inside wondering selfish piece shit parents. Russia said vaccine going give 30k people. words anyone else would call phase 3. turned phase 3 marketing basically. Fucking insane man. People policing everyone else’s feelings make sure don’t say anything “unacceptable” coronavirus situation. idiot journalist Twitter yelled scientist using data making comparison flu. “Mr. Scientist, you’re trying make nuanced point, stop (as someone none qualifications have) I’ve told completely unacceptable use word flu sentence word coronavirus.” what's call gyms nowadays? I'm excited start going again, following guidelines. actual outbreaks gyms everyone complied guidelines, wore masks, sanitized constantly, etc? 600? I’m sure number. Ontario less 200 day. old days, leper colonies. Soc bleu think extremely concerned school starting flu season, people convinced get second large outbreak. could pin letter top sub (and facebook 😣) Yeah it’s tough. two kids. activities cancelled, swim lessons, birthday parties 2-3 kids isolating. told flatten curve hospitals won’t get overwhelmed. wife work I’m trying manage 1st graders education work. agree schools closed I’m exhausted. Luckily lot camping hiking kids isn’t same. 

I’m also extrovert. used meet friends 2 times week get together neighbors 1-2 times week.  It’s getting old. We're waking up. Nah, opened $400 bonus incentive. reason keep min thought Indiana was? Man really get it.

The flu makes sick contagious. feel bad give people. true COVID.

The flu vaccine. get every year, coworkers family. true COVID.

The flu cause permanent lung damage heart damage. true COVID.

Comparing COVID flu fucking ignorant. know 3 people died COVID last 6 months. know ZERO died flu last 40 years. Austria definitely locker Germany would call Germany harsh either compared Canada Australia etc Or, know, *not* die since almost everyone recovers virus. idea testing process absolute shitshow.. really. Germany open borders France way better. said follow-up tweet reason suggesting people worry there's nothing it. botched bad. CDC put changed guidelines said contact positive person symptoms need test....but that's decried scientists researchers etc already know 40% people asymptomatic people spreading virus social distance, wear masks ""because feel fine""

.....and testing group people close contact someone infected, ""feel fine"" anything, attribute feel seasonal allergies ""normal"" chronic issue....then people spread virus unknowingly...possibly someone vulnerable love dies. Time make switch weed, liver thank you. Interestingly, live Switzerland (German speaking) already felt like people give much fuck May/June. pass law get people wear masks public transport July so...and amount bitching hear blows mind. started requiring masks shops supermarkets Zurich like three weeks ago. still see lot people caring numbers going again.

I work research institute planning in-person CONFERENCE November. friend mine physio, lots home visits older patients, says even even seem care. anecdote, surprised me. Anyway I'm gonna give conference hard pass.

Cases surpassed 200 per day July (yes Switzerland tiny), really increase hospitalizations deaths, small increase positive test rate. know average age people testing positive though. deniers large part it, sick pay paid leave.

Yeah, covid deniers Senate us favors either. give masks free. least shave mice first? took job 2 weeks ago four star fine dining restaurant. abruptly quit couple days training even safe. go eat unless absolutely to. 100% safe place be. Trying next Nick Sandman.  [Here's slowcook Excel tool little hard read, portions ""ct used"" field, UOMs 1st column description. Presoak beans overnight water plump up. 

Add everything chicken pot slowcooker, cook low 10 hours, add chicken cook another hour, done. base powder needs addtl water well, follow instructions that. Tastes great served tortillas. 

I've got slowcook recipes really cheap too. Hit PM I'll share more. going use fines, percentage income, flat rate. 

Otherwise disproportionately effect poor, might ones reason mask...(unless pass course)

Level playing field the. We'll see takes seriously. Live downtown Indy. know allowing fans. Guess going anywhere awhile.  Who’s amok guess question matter? Right. 

But honestly feel like much faith them. impression they're type latch technicality either break safety regulations make things unsafe others general misplaced sense pride. Exactly buddy police officer there. says ongoing outbreak jail. People working active infections. call sick show positive test takes 4 days. first vehemently mask wearing engaged bullying suggestion masks necessary. tough-guy enough guess? came around while. gave officers thin neck gaiters looks way cooler wanted everyone wear thing.

A handful officers got sick last week. heard least two currently hospital.

Apparently *no lives matter.*

Fuck place. good person double check link? Dying concern virus. Plastic wrap! sell home improvement store, know Target (cos MN company gets cold fuck). won’t believe much it’ll help. lockdowns worked flattening curve 100 percent, goalposts moved eradication clearly worked.

Even countries worked, like NZL clear method eradication failed. virus way widespread. we've seen, significant percentage Americans goddamn obsessed spreading virus we're kinda boned.

Never thought I'd see many people willing risk death eat microwaved noodles fuckin Applebee's. County Second Biggest outbreak Massachusetts borders NH people living county allowed go NH still numbers stable NH. feel like consuming high fructose syrup hit limit though. felt way way work started back person(teacher). still wish could. understand feeling normalcy routine again. gets easier easier make extra trips. We’re still strict don’t know students back want see parents time. people packing bars, weddings, beaches, Disney. get. cases start rising school opening events starting cold flu season it’s going wild holiday season winter. reading, 28 year old teacher school week student meet-your-teacher appointments. school district MN thing middle schooler. go person 45 minute meeting week. Let guess... NYC transplant NJ? nailing it? Oh god, personality living NYC it? JK went post history confirm. Sorry. 40 years fucking working people we’re still blaming Russia?! Please stop nonsense. country collapsing late stage destructive capitalism. world power. totally screwed profit, growth, excess. It’s first time, may last. add social media mix.. like Facebook ads.. control poorly educated people I’ve several doctors appointments last couple weeks (several kids) honestly it’s place feel safest. serious precautions everyone wearing mask. get flu shots. recommendation would go get busier. main reason cases seen increasing people getting tested, back top pandemic tests available public like right now. probably lot cases reported.

This fear maintained media stage. What's chili kind sir ma'am? means support opening up, prefer open forced starve death. That's limited options.

Sure every developed nation supporting many people stay home partially opening least got choice two shit options.  Eh, really wouldn't. Presumably that's major reason never happened, even came close. We'd make HUGE changes something like could even attempted US. impossible, call realistic. 

Definitely prisons though, theory would heavily fined.

Of course since we're talking fairy tales here, also unrealistically speaking, could issue national order stay home everyone would right fucking thing instead thinking rules apply facts matter. course would never happen, going full Wuhan authoritarian closer reality expecting Americans fucking behave responsibly couple weeks.  least pretend try stay subject ere We've strictly isolating since March, recently ventured outdoor malls, parks, beaches, leisure such, still catch restaurant. Worked many kitchens, chains mom pop, know bad industry keeping sick servers/line cooks restaurant. many servers would flu vomiting actively kitchen tables still serving customers, management shitty letting people go home/call sick. pandemic, Bob Line Cook work 4+ months desperate income. think he'd call now? way.

So that's personally. indoor restaurant absolute last place I'd want right now. I'll look outdoor, distanced ways get house. There's couple places struck list: indoor dining, movie theater, gym. Anywhere I'd sustained indoor spaces people mask enforcement.

I try get takeout local spots support business enjoy good food. live FL weather nice enough keep eating spending time outdoors. Anywhere gets cold winter going rough time, get takeout dole good karma tips. think people saying babies can't get spread covid, people saying that, regardless covid risks, babies required wear masks, wear danger babies.

That said, babies brought places require masks unless absolutely necessary get spread covid. either choose “flatten curve”, did, come back stages kill economy locking completely. Don’t act like perfect solution this. mandatory class buses hallways also used cell phone data show attendees Sturgis dispersed 65% US counties week over. That's lot spread. Fauci going full Ned Stark : "" Winter coming "" Yeah vaccine, fucking deal maybe die, least ruin respiratory vascular system rest life want taco. Can't, open movie theaters Time dip trust fund, Father pleased. Exactly. unemployment. Bartender here. 12 hour shifts, dogs walk n take care em. Dog park etc...

“People complied. didn’t overwhelming majority did.”

I’ve shifted goalposts one bit. wrong Americans. Absolutely zero empathy others. Go read german states operate largely autonomously. US states well state based govenor’s decisions Trump’s. Actually German states even independent US states. adults, fully grown, mentally. think critical decision making 18 year old 40, 30, even 25 year old think may mistaken. either masks work, make worse? Okay... Oh bars already open weeks? May hop flight go California. Well really. may drive instead avoid possible 2 week quarantine passengers incoming flights back California. joking. going drive there.

edit - even restaurant bar since March 19. I've deliver food apartment. bars closed unless serve food counties acceptable color code virus risk. 

Btw California color codes yellow, orange, red purple purple highest risk meaning county close indoor dining among many restrictions. immediately close them, county 14 consecutive days purple code color restrictions put place. rescinded risk goes lower. principle airlines operate flight delayed. ""It 30 minutes, need get crew board... ok 30 more... 30 more."" 4 hours later, find flap broken repair it. came right announced ""yeah flight delayed 4 hours"", everyone would demand change flights. 

They know plan awful half assed one actually comply it, lie. It’s correlation, causality. common misconception.

It’s like saying “people Rolex watches 5x likely millionaires”. Damn, someone give man ice burn. Lol mad.

Wear mask big baby thought among European countries, Germany United Kingdom supposed fat ones? Imagine calling Jets NFL team. Plenty young people /r/covidlonghaulers would strongly disagree ""invulnerable"" claim. Absolutely seems like behavior driven culture. SF one first distance makes remains serious it. Despite news protests burning man, comments SF friends whole level even see parts Bay Area. 

SF also perk fair amount open space cooler even summer (except last weeks, yuck) suspect significantly helps keeping mask compliance versus say LA can’t imagine sitting outside long. I’m sure house gatherings people pushing riskier moves clearly happens less. 

Finally, people leaving. it’s percent overall, I’m sure part people looking space less rules (see comments every Tahoe local). Self selection. 

Of course push back impact growing see things continue. Karaoke banned? Well, least something good come nightmare. Man hope bad side effects. TIL Committing genocide = lawfully arresting people enter country illegally.

They violated laws entering illegally. legal method entry. thing ""basic human rights"" pertains national borders, executing people. It’s consistent logic all. It’s hypocritical excuse. I'm sorry. really am.

But folks comfortable financially also promote policy ""zero CoronaVirus cases allowed"" care you.

They don't.

Dr. Fauci group. LMFAO!! Good burn! Nice. Well guess call God's waiting room nothin. value judgement, clear values right place. cost lockdowns high, true. decided cost human lives worth it. I've decided is. used POOR science back opinions. Yo mama, sure care bout skoolin', boy! approved data showed shortened hospital stays severely I'll covid patients several days. new data showing otherwise? Airplanes recirculate entire air cabin many times per hour mean write code ... generally frowned upon industry exploits ... go jail that.

Apparently “why can’t stay home” crowd doesn’t qualify. selfish person wannabe-totalitarian punk ass. Demanding everybody else cater stupid power trip epitome selfishness.

Thank god worthless, powerless little shit authority anyone anything. they're not.  Whether Dr. Fauci likes not, going happen.

Russia finds loophole almost everything regulation wise wouldn’t put body life depended it. pedant me, congratulations You’re one crying stay home months. Poor baby weak morally correct thing 😢

History doesn’t remember people like well. Fuck you. There's growing evidence quarter third testing positive Covid (including cases mild hidden symptoms) left appears lasting organ damage (heart, lungs, brain).

That complete BS number threw there. data says 1/3 covid patients lasting organ damage. Exactly! think there’s widespread misperception life continued usual Sweden, whereas social mobility statistics actually show similar, even lower, rates social mobility compared Nordic neighbours. didn’t need government mandated “lockdown” achieve it. Orange County’s got one lowest rates incidence populated areas state, trending downward fast Even that's true take yearly vaccine. great investigative reporting *ProPublica* — thanks sharing! bulk transmission church I’d like mask wearing become norm sick..... think that’s good take away entire pandemic almost like viruses spread one person another. Uh, cares? makes legitimate point? ITT: lots circlejerking without actually reading article Totally expected despite trumps lies contrary  CBP also appears hire bottom barrel Removing gloves properly 1 minute video. really get growing shortage medical grade gloves healthcare workers laboratories need use. need more, still gloves ones food prep public use nurses doctors ER not. learned anything US masks, sure get short term gain supply deceiving public, long run sows distrust public health experts. Another reason reduce dependency cars. SF also chock full people work home - even essential workers work city often live outside insanely high cost living. also retire there, reason, making fewer elderly people. 

Even still going grocery store (which lot be, also money order groceries in), exposure minimal comparison exposure people working grocery stores, restaurants, even distanced working place like factory, nursing home, meat packing plant. places see massive outbreaks. surprise SF escaped relatively unscathed. Planes filled thugs dressed black boxes gear -DJ Trump Essential businesses only, 'click collect' stores take away food still available. 

There also curfew 8pm - 5am night admit point nothing conversation? Weird ok.

Lobsters claws. stop saying :) Bold strategy, cotton. thought would vaccinated Election Day would finally recognize president hero /s Holy smokes bars still opened Canada? making stuff point, clear politized mind.

At least agree everyone locked down, everyone wore masks, way move goalposts. Remember trying flatten curve? That's he's talking about. Niece likely got way. send kids daycare ended Corna back July. Kids great all, nothing dirty germ ridden kid. fault, they're kids, can't ask careful spread anything because, again, they're kids. like saying less likely get burned house fire. think accomplish think. accept certain level risk every action.

Yes, do. hard sub understand? combination factors:

1. Much higher testing (than Spring) larger fraction cases caught lowers CFR enormously

2. Better treatment: estimates deaths 2x-4x less likely kind patient/severity.

3. Deaths lagging cases 2-4 weeks

4. likely, different demographics. nursing home get outbreak once.. doesn’t work. effect marginal. funny clever new? Yup literally said judging downvotes one wants hear it. think spring things could better, completely going back NORMAL probably toward end next year. things open? grocery stores also take out?  Thank finding letters full text! Im glad actually qualified faculty pushing back scientifically delusional disingenuous man. 

And worth reiterating case anyone missed — **Dr Scott Atlas qualifications infectious disease whatsoever** still think virus sooo fucking mysterious? nobody knows.... Kids mix breaks, outside.

That mostly younger ones. Starting 7th grade stay inside breaks do. mean ... yes. Outdoor, passing contact dangerous prolonged indoor contact often testing every student? That's says ""nearly"" ""completely"". county Lincoln U N keep restrictions. Yeah worked fine country. stopped early exponential growth, back know good treat people.

We're wrexked either. making new restrictions almost daily now. time smart restrictions, touching things need messed with.

I understant mean much weaker position? Still getting it. Seriously!

What’s bad news coming out?

People don’t **need** wear masks socially distancing rate infection really low
Not big public gatherings people running care homes common sense keep infections low, no?

(BTW: care homes allow visits, carefully prepared staff held outdoors) Trump pretty much sealed fate thousands upon thousands people started signaling base anti-mask meantime learned more. know contagious thought. know spreads aerosols large droplets. know long-haul recoveries. know serious permanent organ nervous damage even among asymptomatic. 

Are looking forward four months hospital, six weeks medically induced coma ventilator, looking like years rest climb flight stairs? Spiegel interview also published got COVID bat died bucket. Ok keeps warning us actually gonna anything? Lol looked. use Filtrete 2800 Healthy Living filters rated MERV14 use fiberglass. bit scare reading comment, still appreciate chiming in. See link...that data Canadian government. need? Lol virus, stay away people. fires Oregon least, killed less 10 I'm aware of, virus killed many. run fire, can't always run virus.

Really made think. Also telling expected would want try lie someone calls it. Compared rational response aimed preventing spread communicable disease (you know, job epidemiologists supposed do) strategy exist. nothing.  I’ve thought. Yes shouldn’t cut short trials testing, unfortunately every attempt mitigate pandemic failed miserably United States. winter coming, don’t think it’s quite sinking people fucked are. economy shitter, small businesses can’t reopen indoors closer capacity fucked, educational system tatters.

And haven’t even mentioned pandemic killing 1000 people day...but is.

Nobody stares wear mask. like inaction led normalization mass shootings America. Maybe there’s something wrong Appreciate it. look it. Omg wtf? Ok Himmler never locked seems getting it

 Sweden actually poorly first, one major city rest country sparsely populated. went Stockholm cases deaths right there. comparable US, large country many densely populated areas. Sweden also much healthier thinner country, near many risk people per capita compared US. Even then, still one highest deaths per capita world.

Also misinformation Sweden took action dangerous misleading. still ban gatherings 50 people prevent superspreading, left ban place fairly late. also advised public take precautions, public since Sweden fairly obedient easy going populous. also capacity limits restaurants, bars, shops, etc... many officer workers still working home. Offices huge place transmission.

While Sweden never official lockdown (we US either tbh, business restrictions states, actual enforced lockdown) shutdown, lots safety measures place, large percent population still took precautions. People twisted ""Sweden nothing they're fine"" fit narrative. dangerous misinformation. many reasons noted. Iowa going fight hard already pointed they're still experiencing new cases new deaths daily.

You said dumbshit. Jeez see friends many examples countries doing:
1. dogs/cats get infected, govs: cant
2. reinfections confirmed, govs: nah weird case wont happen here
3. permanent brain heart damage, gov: nah super weird case dont worry
4. wind carry it, gov: dont talk wear mask fine

in resume: going apeshit public bad news That's said, swedish media made sound like. that's was, diplomatically said, ""surprised"" medias reported way. deaths population 10 million basically nothing.

Unless one people love one five. devastating...

But fuck *them*, right? You’re right, needs discussed. Reddit subreddits better suited discussion one though. hardly played role like usually does. point Merkely scientist zero due current handling situation.  RemindMe! 6 months Never said he's good, care less wants do, fact shows system worked everyone convinced would magically become dictator could wanted idiots. want people smarter progmatic democracy works, instead stuck reddit idiots think everywhere US sunshine butterflies chart uses data, I'm even sure trying imply. sound numerically illiterate though Strange. I’m sure there’s sort explanation. London’s case aberration daughter met 2 grandparents yet came town this. We've done basically nothing since March. Give break. Yeah 200,000 Americans “slight adversity” go covid deaths older 70 90% last checked declined 89.6% now. include 60-69 97%. 

My point still stands - old sick people dying part human experience. condone isolating 7B people home 12-18 months - need consider tradeoffs.

3M people die US every year ~300k die Canada. mean cruel old sick people die EVERY YEAR! read study Christoffer Koch (Federal Reserve bank Dallas) Ken Okamura (University Oxford) study China's Covid numbers according Benford's Law, concluded Chinese numbers consistent. abstract.

""Trust reported data contagious diseases real time important policy makers. Media politicians cast doubt Chinese reported data COVID-19 cases. find Chinese confirmed infections match distribution expected Benford’s Law similar seen U.S. Italy thus find evidence manipulation. Policy makers rest world trust Chinese data formulate policy accordingly.""

Can provide academic studies claiming Chinese manipulated? Well aged well. You’re allowed causally hangout friends. vast majority people think stupid exclude discussion primary reason US we're Covid-19.

No No, talk elephant room. Plenty people waiting there's vaccine, already said I'd do. Sorry can't read. one said anything numbers literally zero. finally called, yes, _did_ keep tab open firefox two whole months finally got around it, us lowly SSI people supposed get paid september 30th, guess I'll see then, yeehaw we’ll raise occupancy lower restrictions til becomes one. Don’t worry pal, they’re trying. guy doom gloom predictions never correct? guy told us ""masks ineffective"" ""masks necessary"" ?

Dude loves read name headlines. Politicians really Americans though. Looking many histories, tend upper class background, go Ivy League, become lawyers, later enter office. Considering common path seems lot politicians makes think they're essentially set childhood become leadership. like UK stereotypical leaders always come respected family name go Eton similar school fast-tracked position power. There's essentially sort aristocracy US, ensures leaders mostly come there, average citizens. problem many average citizens actively support aristocracy - look many commenters political article enthusiastically go bat kind policies hurt middle/working classes. week, reality arrived Oxford vaccine. independent committee must determine whether illness directly linked vaccine not—both outcomes possible. two related, likely end vaccine. not, trial likely resume several hitch also reminder lot Covid-19 science uncharted territory. “We don’t much experience types vaccines,” says Tom Frieden, former director Centers Disease Control Prevention. Adenovirus vectored vaccines, like Oxford’s, relatively new, mRNA vaccines—like developed Moderna Pfizer—have never used humans. Trump administration reportedly making plans distribute Moderna Pfizer candidates, still Phase III trials, U.S. early November. It’s easy low case numbers don’t test anyone. easy low death numbers 1/4 deaths ever formally recorded NON PANDEMIC TIMES. Says reddit video gamer probably didn’t go much COVID Yeah, country terribly. total 1,793 cases 23 deaths (less Sweden last month).

Our evil government put us lockdown halted spread disease three months. outbreak happened largest city put lockdown outbreak resulted fewer cases total Sweden last three days.

Sweden twice population, 250 times many deaths. They've done fantastic job. lol actually get instructions talk it. 

CDC reporting single digit daily tests Feb, obvious anyone read werent testing, single question asked media press event reports, zero. silence surreal tracks it.

They cant hide mass death event public, werent able to, certainly hide flu season point IGNORE. Give call peer reviewed. sub wake reality something? months it’s HurrrrrDurrrrrr USA cases!! India!!! 

Meanwhile, testing per capita blows away countries. 

New cases completely useless metric, it’s easily predicted number tests. spread around world pretty much time. happened already time, would suddenly go crazy now? Professor Ludwig Von Drake Goofy extensive research. Yeah, storm-troopers rights-violators gotta eat too! Consider fear always effectively used tool scare people willingly handing freedoms. need review social contract

Winter approaching people living higher latitudes start heading back indoors. Europe already big surge. Countries going weigh saving lives going early vaccines completely gone normal Phase III trials, possibility serious side effects. tough moral decision, Covid still killing 6,000 people worldwide every day (just reported numbers), fast-tracking vaccine without merit. also means large percentages people taking early vaccine feel safe need it. One needs keep mind Covid also politicized world US. People vulnerable populations (elderly, immuno-compromised) probably would weigh odds, likely come conclusion improving chances taking early vaccine.

I get saying trust me, ANYBODY Trump would preferable opinion. Like - Gary Johnson. Would super stoked, comparison.

But would realistically come low-ball number like that? sheer population there, think. Step 1 fixing pandemic. Every one wears mask outside house.

President still working stage 1. fact making people wear mask making people wear one.

Yes, president can’t get us past stage 1 fighting national pandemic. yes president blame. Sweden absolutely horrific start pandemic. stood around nothing way long, we’re pretty damn well right now. daily case counts slightly better Denmark Norway adjusted population.

Germany still slightly better though, restrictions lower urbanization.

Other countries flare ups (UK, Netherlands, France..) viruses cases still lingering around. 

We hit less hard therefor less infections lingering around, waiting break out.

He also talked something really interesting:

Imagine yourself. Social Circle, usually don’t randomly leave. It’s kinda always people, locations.

So infections really go crazy need hoppers, like flees. flees bring infection social bubbles. infections remaining, chances experiencing flees hopping around spreading massively increase insane margins.

You really understanding I'm saying. know problem end I'm explaining well. 

I'll try again: amount taxes people pay lifetimes related much earn lifetime. Moreover, others also pay taxes related someone's production (like company profits someone's productivity). 

A person goes homeless gets disabled earn significantly less rest lives someone stays healthy housed. 

The government get lot back taxes (all sorts different taxes) higher lifetime earnings. answer obvious interview Friday, CNN asked Fauci whether vaccine 70% 75% efficacy taken two-thirds population would provide herd immunity -- unlikely,"" single case ever linked protests, fit narrative reporters would get accused racism. I'm northwest Atlanta suburbs yeah, mask compliance grocery stores really good. Pharmacies well. rules wearing masks.

I'm sure going big box stores like Walmart Target. Given see going gas stations, I'm going guess nowhere near 99%. go QuikTrip busy time I'm lucky see 50% mask wearing, usually around 10-20%. Though less crowded times consistently 50-75%, sometimes higher. cute opinion. gave idea? CNN? [Why rum always thing dropping dramatically credibility. think get it.... article acts like school new thing. Life went world last several months. masks particularly emphasized

If go back 2 months places wearing masks, still high level social distancing going people wearing masks stores. Now, people become comfortable masks, less social distancing going stores people closer normal distances. see flu every year. Kids pass family, family pass co-workers, co-workers pass kids. kids school workers work one long chain infection. ok dear leader murderous corrupt traitor? Allows weed people need anyway. There’s Trump Europe who’s blame? grocery stores avoid unmasked people, never near stranger seconds. sitting restaurant, things aren’t possible. People can’t see difference ones going restaurants.

I've seen cops gently ask people disperse apologizing inconvenience.

Glad starting fine crazies. yeah horrible article, cant' read Lot germans claim ""swedish way"" better, number much lower.

Someone bit... ""stlow"" could interpret post proof swedish way pandemic would way better, masks, closed bars etc.

Throwing numbers brings everything perspective.

Yes, Sweden - compared germany - way less cases Covid deaths. Sweden also way less population way less density.

Again, contradicting you, threw comparative numbers statement.

Would sweden higher density, Sweden would pile sick dead. Maybe unnecessary. Maybe ineffective thing like bun might hit 165F water dense things nuked. going make worse either. 

You here. NINE DIVINES yet Germany positivity rate 1 % 1400 positive cases day... Trump suggested issuing federal Lockdown New York said authority &amp; would sue?

Because authority? Unless wants issue martial order, can't lock states everyone knows that, including you.

Would saying thing President wanted ""lock down"" guns? ""Shall infringed"" all...

Trump loser narcissist. good job, today. Pathetic. mean there’s prob atleast town two ok Classes filled top, bigger cities 30 kids class. classes pretty fixed tho. able choose classes please. choose different 2nd foreign languages that’s pretty much it. won’t see students mixed around every subject. basic education schools allow pick choose courses please. It’s less overall package supposed bring everyone kinda standard 

Light end tunnel? Sure, university free, start apprenticeship join military, voluntary social year first... lots options, depending school went to.

After elementary school (4 years) choose one three different paths (depending well elementary school), leading different levels education.

The highest one (gymnasium) leads getting Abitur able join university. 

The 2 degrees (mittlere Reife, Hauptschulabschluss) allow join university. obviously choose education start apprenticeship. 

For example: nurse Germany would never see inside university. It’s apprenticeship here. many jobs. I'm 100% sure Romney president would hugely superior hypothetical scenario compared Obama Biden president.

But agree ""oh, Biden president, none would happened"" unrealistic hell.

And yeah said, right-leaning person, fact Romney never even option just...baffling. I'm sure would handled actual adult. November 4th. Look going Credit union instead. fear mongering encouraged evidence government always should

True, cafés open government's fault, fault. I'm epidemiologist. Reading articles internet watching Youtube videos well prefer put faith public health professionals. 

I want fight virus I'm going go beyond recommended keep virus control. hand cheerily obey rules regulations put place (such recent order wear masks times). Hillary would managed 25,000 deaths.  GOP would destroyed it. Maybe panic exactly needed.  Back came said American public “this virus deadly!! everyone needs mask right everything public”. 

Scare ever living bejesus everyone. It’s like we’re going run around screaming sky falling. you’re scared/concerned enough walk door.... you’re throwing mask. turn many people would still alive?? lower would total number positive cases be?? board something SIMPLE throwing mask. 

But nope!! Even day criminal rallies spews mouth feces masks aren’t necessary. EVEN TODAY still

Gotta love Reddit lol. 


Do mean people infect others recovering it? 
Answer would likely no, shedding active virus anymore certain period. 
I think studies found viral particles certain people recovered dead virus, ie infectious. 
Just remnants guess. 
Recovery seems provide level immunity, exceptions reinfected different strains, although seems quite rare. 
no one knows average amount time immunity yet though lol Kavanaugh. live Kentucky. lot judges stupid idiots living here. Wouldnt last long appeal. Yep. Big time. Results line non-facebook survey. $60 2 months like think word 'liquidate' means dumbass? problem Fauci said this. isn’t lawmaker. He’s adviser lawmakers refusing make common sense changes based advice. People get mad Fauci saying stuff like seen thread he’s one mad at. It’s people Congress (left right) nothing help people. Don’t mad Fauci, job dedicated life to. Follow leader say thing. area 7% positive rate, preparing switch virtual hybrid soon. saying percent positive rate almighty number use, compare New York 1%. would feel lot comfortable Wife (a Teacher) kid going back person learning numbers better trending live.

smh Things going improve without consistent rules across country centralized leadership this.

The longer goes on, people start dropping guard stretching whole thing out.

Listen dude, I’m disparaging anyone. saying Indian tribes worst indicators health, poverty, education, crime really metric want use. expert 574 tribes, really matter since tiny, similar size small village. However, tell Indian tribes model look UBI think it’s perfectly reasonable point hasn’t desired effect really doesn’t make point well. 

You chose call racist problem discussing anything people ilk. aware, numbers posted article still confirmed next weekly report FHM reliable numbers. numbers usually fluctuate gets corrected weekly reports report week 36 yet released. 

But even look 

**Week 36 Starting new cases**

Monday: 162

Tuesday: 172

Wednesday: 213

Thursday; 283

Friday: 262

Saturday: 171

Sunday: 67

**Total week 36 : 1117**

**Average Mon-Thu = 207.5**

**Average per day: 159**



 Week 37: 

Monday: 185

Tuesday: 239 

Wednesday: 314

Thursday: 201


**Average Mon-Thu = 234**

As probably discern, numbers drop weekends gets corrected following days, reason many cases early week. reports say Sweden increased testing 100k per week puts positivty rate 2% week 35 probably 36.

As previously said, best wait weekly report, numbers really uptick. always kind deviation norm, drawing conclusion getting worried one two days reporting without full context worrying numbers itself. Yes...i know. mean died today, gives inaccurate picture death curve things moving forward.

I'm talking data, policies control based on. honestly think Marsh v Alabama needs extended social media platforms. Public life primarily exists online public square exists primarily privately owned virtual platforms. end, irl rights must extended online life else transition virtual space mean leaving civil liberties behind allowing monopolistic corporations dictate can't meaningful format social interaction. Yeah, tried find specific number much radiation machines put *for reason* companies making seem want advertise that.  That’s reporting done. takes time. Weeks months, deaths. 

The souls don’t leave body add spreadsheet way out. *total* numbers - deaths till now. yeah, Sweden's pretty nicely now. US certainly isn't. Thanks. needed read buy next phone. downvote comments like 😎 wait till war starts... hand shaking needed go away anyway. holdover old days showed ""i dont weapon hand, would like reach hand declare truce respect"" type thing I'll concede slightly, slightly.

I like lied preserve PPE, understand _why_. vast stupidity/non caring nature humans, blame them? 

Do actually think people would _listened_ asked nicely common folk preserve PPE? course not.

Toilet paper bad enough - combining production issue hoarding (which self fulfilling) imagine hoarding spread items including ppe? Herd immunity point enough population immune impossible virus continue spreading. However, practical terms, herd immunity appears come effect well hits theoretical threshold. makes sense hitting herd immunity threshold extreme case. Yeah, favorites. like alt flavors, can't beat OGs. Fauci, guy knowingly lied masks effective early on? Yeah, deserves blame. newspapers continue using stupid questions article titles? That's think need better job with... communicating people worked hard best interests mind.

I'd lean toward getting vaccine time, odds seem high given poor job U.S. government done this, result whatever vaccine approve trustworthy. think likely ineffective opposed dangerous, unless better leadership kind hard trust anything coming U.S. government corporations definitely trustworthy. credit unions almost open membership. require join coop something $5 eligible. Check consumers credit union Illinois, open membership awesome rates. mobile app good BofA, better lot tiny credit unions. Taiwan shining beacon humanity, god-damned fucking proud democracy accomplishments. Tsai Yingwen administration amazing. Extract:

Eating drinking on-site locations offer options might important risk factors associated SARS-CoV-2 infection. Efforts reduce possible exposures mask use social distancing difficult maintain, eating drinking, considered protect customers, employees, communities. Time invest FAANG really wish way businesses like recover losses without take risks. Unfortunately, there’s way prevent spread coronavirus dining out, take mask eat. I’m surprised correlation outbreaks dining out. 

If government (at levels) supposed beginning, continued they’re supposed (mandating masks, enforcing social distancing, limiting people leaving house unnecessarily) we’d faring lot better. Hurr durr career senator 3 homes he’s hypocrite smart Numbers drop relating testing. Positivity rate hand usually doesn’t, it’s sitting mostly flat 10% past couple weeks. dropped testing, check John Hopkins website 300M Americans. That's $3 / person. Even restrict group say, furloughed jobless people 18 - 65 (before social security), that's still $100 / person absolute best. That's drop bucket.

Also, net worth Amazon stock. Liquidating $100B would absolutely tank stock. There's even $100B worth liquidity Bezos sell into. He'd slowly sell far $100B current value. vast majority investments contain AMZN either directly, mutual funds, index funds. investments would drop dramatically. average investor care about, pensions 401ks many Americans rely income.

TL;DR - simple. Well live Downtown Orlando assure you, 80% bars closed. blows mind. think bad analogy case good point general. People worry dumbest shit go drive work putting makeup watching YouTube video. First, everyone party already positive. Work reading comprehension. ""claimed"" everyone living house positive ""many"" attendees positive. That's everyone. knows that's true. trying cover ass, know could one person referring to. completely untrue. 

The thing tests always accurate really know sure positive period time. possible get reinfected covid get infected different strains it. knows could mean someone get exposed high viral load even test positive. Could mean reinfection contagious longer period time?

Lastly, one covid positive came party leave house. means potential stop gas station, potential stop store buy food, potentially driving windows walking people outside. dangerous ways additional people outside party could become infected. zero warning known triggers. kind like heart attacks hit nowhere. didn’t even chest pain - suddenly stuck heart rate 250 one day didn’t know why, stayed like hour went emergency room. 

It’s happened 2 3 times since I’ve always able get go back controlled breathing, first time couldn’t. may dumbest take I’ve seen bit germany spread country, history people social culture already socially distanced. already social distance overall that. much different culture france, italy, etc. poland well too. kind like that. stay away people nature also bit disdain anti-vaxx, even reservations rushed COVID vaccine. agree would counterproductive disallow people voicing concerns things like vaccines. nothing affair. kid gotten vaccines, I'm point would actually first line ""warp speed"" COVID vaccine...especially one trials suspended due safety concerns. keep head dude. Anne frank stay closet 3 years, hunker another 6 months. easy. plus got reddit keep entertained Death small part problem COVID. amount long-term permanently disabled people need kind assistance result pandemic going higher expected everyone focusing deaths (for numbers still wrong).

If really want protect economy, would pushing full lockdown disease dies lack hosts dropping dramatically, say current metrics still higher March.

And numbers higher 2017 too, also pick useless timeframes compare. totally understand sentiments people want guinea pigs fact someone never vaccine. 

I'm volunteer Moderna trial I'm pleased so. science strong compelling research team conscientious caring health doctor. 

For least, multi billion dollar company vested interest health really comforting. bars already found way serve food open anyway. way get paid lockdown without risk... Obesity huge risk factor. Lose weight. smell class consciousness???!!! surprising all. Nothing stopping virus US point. Trump knack finding grifters. rather, grifters see trump supporters easy mark exploit profit. ~420$ per person 2 weeks much money

We could pay *half* population stay home like year would tiny fraction wealth already paid giant corporations. 

The relief package $2.2 fucking trillion. could pay entire country, every man, woman child, $30/day stay home entire month october except bare minimum critical workers, would starve virus, $300 billion, 15% relief package already spent.

**You could pay every human america $100/day 60 days stay home pick nose less price current corporate bailout.** math, 100 * 60 * 330,000,000 less $2 trillion. Every single penny would immediately go back economy ground up, spent locally small businesses used ensure people evicted homes.

The relief package intentionally mismanaged money-grab. outraged.  school, quite good. wooden windowframes old warped, holes father could fit hand through, windows could opened, close properly all. 20 years ago, local council members said would fixed ASAP.

A years ago one window fell yard insurance forced quickly redo everything. chose fixed window panes aluminum frames, opened all, ventilation.

The next summer, parents forced council meeting held classroom, afterwards, redheaded council members said would ensure problem fixed ASAP.

My bet is: 2040. ridiculously difficult get tested Japanese health insurance. wouldn’t trust numbers Japan all.

I needed one hearing coworker didn’t think would pass criteria test Japanese health insurance went private clinic paid US$400 test. Came back negative thankfully. Sweden: hey guys look low rate didn’t shut country trusted citizens sensible!!

Other countries leaders: nothing happening like stale eat day one leave bag open days. bag bag consistency pretty bad sometimes pick bag carefully firmness. Second lockdown November call forced stay stay home minor inconvenience. is. great, plenty ots horrible physical mental health Liar. man belongs r/iamatotalpeiceofshit hear Peggys now.

""TOTAL SILENCE!"" ever say numbers dropping “dramatically”? actually used word *slightly* emphasize it’s big change. current metrics still higher March. don’t know you’re arguing here, numbers widely available. lot truth this, specific case, DNC would least competent virus response even workers disregarded.

The DNC absolutely supporters owning class’ oligarchy. think one election vote strategically. Sweden reluctant hospitalize people along. Bring home antigen testing Boris remembered UKs Trump. What's doubling time again? Keep bragging dude. ads dumb going look. Good kick guys, unlike Europeans sub,I'm going ghost deaths anyone. point arrogant were. Rubbish detect virus particles, dead alive. way knowing it’s new infection someone recovering longer infectious ""Those would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety."" - Ben Franklin talking about? Deaths low single digits Sweden weeks. Freedom assembly constitutional right regardless purpose. GOP decided best downplay virus, provide much support. realized would hit denser, democratic cities harder. political decision let virus politics could not, change voter balance. We’ve pickup variety grocery stores. Kroger free. Walmart free. 
You order app, schedule pickup time, drive right time. Pop trunk call let know you’re there. roll out, load car. don’t even get out, don’t get within car length you. 

From perspective, helping store keep people store. benefits everybody. oppressed people USA currently main factor Germany virus control going school year. control expectation US like 5 seconds everything politicized. result we’ve lull we’ll keep rolling inevitable disaster cold months. Honestly think also comes cliche Germans following rules. stomped virus back March April, things explode staying home shit. old towns downtons ghost centers. Obviously people became less cautious every country, still general rules (wearing masks indoors, large gatherings, bars, clubs) stuck consistently. look cell phone data much people moved around worst times pandemic Germans best staying fuck home, saying back then.

 vacation Croatia end July seemed like people considered rules suggestion law. shit countries, cases brought Germany came Southern Europe appears people free gather socially party (and tested people returning vacation ports entry like crazy, able catch lot cases coming back isolationg immediately).
 People generally really good taking measures seriously, despite like 15-20% think bullshit.

I use train get work literally everybody good wearing mask. Even studetns middle school teach (year 5-10) kids really great wearing masks. goes restaurants nad bars, people stay tables, mingle much groups and, cliche is, follow rules. I'm kinda scared winter. isolation hasnt kind triggered enough depression make feel ""blah"" want usual entertainment options. 

Its gonna hard stay positive entertained 😖 answer question, yes expose radiation. CT works taking image many angles reconstruction 2D images 3D.  


I specifically looked tech particular, even really low res CTs take x-ray every degree 2. best would need take 180 images, probably want decent image. mean, 300k today don’t really see point. Regardless government laid laws. Sitting inside cafe mask higher risk sitting home. said government says that’s ok nothing wrong. Canada restaurants open quite while. gone one mask. I’ve gone pick food. I’ve actually supporting restaurants this. order food 1-2 times week maybe month. Even though government says it’s ok go eat public still choose eat home less risk. vice.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

""All numbers dropping pretty dramatically, recovering."" - coronavirus still contained Georgia

Numbers dropping. contained somewhat they'd growing. Facebook evil place. Everyone half braincell get rid it. family ways stay connected texting, calling, hell even building website friendly healthy way stay communication think it’s lot us experience one extremes. hot spot desensitized see. hand, live city 750,000 fairly well connected. know 1 person got go 3 degrees separation someone died it. I’m sure lot others share experience desensitized pounded numbers day day look stats see medium sized state I’m still likely die car wreck covid. trying downplay anything disrespectful, trying tell another side story White people like Well. is. Two sides coin. guess personal perceptions. 
Personally feel like healthcare professionals jumping pulling hair better part year people ignored point 190k covid deaths another 50k ""excessive"" deaths top that. Free childcare great feel rather comfortable waiting apparent believe reputable source. Good luck yours. agree—super gross. hope handshaking goes away forever. Plus it’s super stupid people judge based handshake. going waiting much month hit general populace. priority queue comment aged poorly. US overtaken Sweden Covid deaths per million, little sign slowing made laugh, true. fit kisses cheek casually. Here, think ourselves, perverted?! Back up! another great thing people circle jerking ""hurvdur stupid"" look like real assholes now. friend mine thinks overblown. He's military said he's pretty sure whole unit (or whatever called) equivalent bad flu days fine. 

I told that's great they're ok, us underlying conditions could deadly catch shit. rest population held standards fitness health makes sense would less risk. 

Then turned whole discussion CDC report morons think shows 6% deaths caused covid, believes wholeheartedly. felt bummed afterwards. many people like country nothing short vaccine pull us shit, even that's guarantee antivax crowd around. IMO shot foot second got involved censoring controversial opinions. give inch people expect mile.

Shouting Facebook isn’t going convert millions doom humanity.

Censorship objectively harmful content (violence, nudity) - great, protect people mental trauma.

Censorship laughably stupid fringe opinions - Orwellian unnecessary.

Just 2 cents would far worse economy allowed massively contract, would less debt short term would less economy pay long term. Debt crisis good good thing

Keynes, kids bit fault lying previously causing massive distrust. military someone family that's serving, give USAA chance. bank play games, accounts free. look serve members make money!

If get membership, also save GEICO car insurance, homeowners, long term care (esp pandemic), many things can't list all! leave hanging like many insurance carriers did/do hurricanes, looking excuse pay. pay games. lost old wedding ring insured homeowner's. receipt documentation. accepted old photo hand clearly visible, texted conversation. money account checked hour later. Go USAA!

My grandfather served WWII, got daughters accounts minors, gifted membership minor too. lifelong gift I'm thankful every month paying bills!

Also, USAA CAR INSURANCE recently refunded ton money since car accidents way many driving driving less.  Sweden never restrictions cases also dropped almost nothing. Right. 180 days year. work 10 average, year-round. probably get weekends holidays minus 6 weeks vacation. choose thing. wouldn’t want wouldn’t want mine, either us unhappy something else.

I never suggested teachers don’t work hard. OP making kind point salary spread year, like unusual unfair. salaried positions work way. Yes, understand disabling app means. think stupid cannot *uninstall* app, required phone. Anybody disagreeing bot, right? people posting want Guinea pig going complaining access vaccine 4 months ""es zieht"" es common thing Germans say notice slight draft. misconception draft make sick give stiff neck (it kinda German equivalent fan death). Teachers supposed air classroom every lesson. weather nice outside right now, classroom keep windows open times. 

In State Bavaria students 5th grade keep masks entirety school day, even class, sucks. precaution, becasue seen recent cases brought returning travelers first week back school. mask mandate fro next week gladly return wearing masks outside classroom. think states mask mandates strict returning summer break. expect go away without vaccine solid treatment? think locking people age 24 houses zero socialization pretty moronic.  hardly tried true method disease mitigation. guys seem forget method locking healthy novel means disease control. deaths aren’t going nearly rate back March April.. relax
People  Distance. concept distance. Time exposure. fundamental factors spreading virus. reading five months? biology class maybe? 

Sitting couch friends hours wildly different someone grocery store. It’s clear indication public institutions better hands though highest office country belongs scientist. she’s probably fine never it? neighbors like that. Best summer ever. Makes wonder we’re overly cautious. ive numb since 1997, hell guys doing? think could say Japan started plenty there. member wayne county community federal credit union, whose onky requirement live, work, play, worship wayne county. seem concerning me. point, people already know deal it. There's nothing new talk aside ever-increasing numbers. 

You call ""numb"" people they've made changes, committed them, longer feel need talk 24/7.

When buy new car, talk frequently while, research things maintenance bells whistles. Eventually becomes car already know need know want. mean stop driving every day. Lol, lemme know type boots lick. I'll get pair size. Wow thats early CONSIDERING COVID19 FUCKING WORLD ALMOST YEAR I'm sure we'd entered 'family get togethers six people' season. one county different guidance another expect. national mandate never see homogenous improvement. AstraZeneca’s website, expect 50,000 people enrolled recent clinical trials. can’t give exact number yet many people vaccinated, due much results still double blinded, think 5000-10000 probably safe bet.  Well support anyone exercise safely without putting others danger. 

If means calisthenics home walking jogging hiking mask outside that’s better alternative going really well actually. Since Bernie political realm, he's introduced many needed topics discussion. time talk wealth inequality, healthcare, minimum wage. I'm happy asked going....cause going really well.

How's Trump....oh countries fire, 200k dead him, we've never divided, debt......  live US, life. long time since country whole managed something right. sorry. 😐 wait weeks October. Statistically do.

Crime rates especially violent crimes property crimes strongly correlated income.

Of course 'everyone' poor fall group, enough make living poor areas awful.

The average salary public school teacher Chicago $60k. much higher many districts Illinois. lots low cost areas Chicago buy real nice house much less suburbs.

Why friends either move suburbs pay private school kids? quality education. buy tutors, kids learn anything imaginable internet.

No, poor people.

Why friends *are* public school teachers want work CPS? poor people.

And least mean poor people, mean things statistically significant amount poor people do. CPS filled drugs violence. teachers want work kids ones violent, parents awful everything generally gets ruined many poor people.

The crappy apartments grew in, playground middle compound. run people complained time. One spring, replaced new requirement.

First weekend graffiti'ed 

Rich people that. Rich people spray paint giant dick slide. 

And equipment pretty nice while, go without bit afraid, even day, wrong group kids would there. 6pm, nah, even think it.  reminds scientist one disaster movies. one realizes threat what's coming tries hard get government listen refuse; disaster strikes. counting income tax? People pay tons taxes, time. 

Go buy something - taxes. drive store - gas tax. go bridge - tolls. cell phone - taxes bill. earn money - payroll taxes. live somewhere - property tax (or trickled-down property tax renter.) taxes power bill, cable bill, ""sin taxes"" alcohol cigs, taxes bill restaurant, etc. 

Every single person anything pays taxes. hit poor larger % income, too. 

Now, back original point, people healthier, educated, homeless tend make lifetimes pay taxes. government helps people keep going homeless disabled pandemic economic collapse, government gets money back time increased productivity taxes.  Ah another reason avoid loud people 2020- year people learned virus fair still great phone properly deactivated still dont need big f. Good job allowing fans football stadiums, France! Good lol. fun behind mask rest life really citing article research team says poll Facebook group Covid survivors?

For someone loves run sub screaming misinformation pretty pathetic internet Reddit. pick choose consume. today decided make really dumb comment. internet LIMIT FILTER! fact Reddit limit filter, also there's limit 90% internet. includes hate speech, direct insults, violence, etc. need free open communication system nonviolent course, share opinion see reaction. choose frequent toxic subs even worse, social media, that's choice. Life full them. internet cause dumb. Dumb dumb internet not. Like sars, Ebola. Wait book wrote guide global pandemic Trump ignored. Like ignited south Korea’s Sars handbook pandemic response. Like fired federal pandemic response group. 

And hear say tapes knew deadly dangerous country nothing tell us fake. enemy wound punch leader golfed head sand. Yeah sucks never even slightly got control, country. feel Fauci; like grizzled fire fighter watching millions adults play matches.

I wonder though; country huge diverse United States, even competent president, would things gone differently?

With individual governors much authority please, sheer amount different cultures ethnicities packed pretty large, sprawling country - ever honest shot?

We're literal dictatorship like China, we're lot larger France Italy Spain UK etc.

So wonder - even Obama someone else utter joke leader charge, ever actually shot getting things relatively control month two, whole country?

I'm bit skeptic. Sure, could less deaths maybe governors would've swayed firm leadership, think anything along lines European countries Asian countries clamped (temporarily) got things control, never truly doable here. live big gym outbreak, absolutely don’t go. They’re safe one recommending anyone goes them. give fuck, cut arm bleeding smart talk like that? USA/CAN governments done exactly? Something doesn’t seem right here:


No significant differences observed bivariate analysis case-patients control-participants shopping; gatherings ≤10 persons home; going office setting; going salon; gatherings persons home; going gym; using public transportation; going bar/coffee shop; attending church/religious gathering.

So small sample individuals showed tie restaurants indoor outdoor activities also high degree contact others? 

Methinks may type 1 error. deaths bad number obviously. even population factored in, anywhere near worst day New York State. New York State 4.3x population kentucky does. 22 deaths kentucky 1 day equivalent 95 deaths New York State. its' peak, New York State almost 1,000 death one day. New York State 10x harder Kentucky. Let's pray starts trending Kentucky gets hard NYS they'll looking 220 deaths per day. densely populated treatments improved hope Kentucky already seen worst it. scientists. 100% false, don’t fall misinformation far this! That’s known hoaxer conspiracy theory. Yeah that’s BS Anything 5% positivity indicates community spread. way you’re phrasing misleading. drop 13% 9% month slight improvement, still definitely contained, well 5% threshold. It’s steep downward trend you’re implying, instead it’s minor negative slope. look long-term positivity trend you’ll realize I’m correct. k never said Indian tribes model, said case study. Although clear ignorant understand difference. politically biased understand making value statement. triggered ""r"" word think logically it. 

Classic right wing rhetoric: can't even admit misunderstood saying. course would mean acknowledging jumped making racist comments without processing reading, ego fragile that. mean we're way better lot countries including entire UK.

I trusted science vaccines enough whole family vaccinated. Although put professionals pedestal school went to. know quite morons went good schools, including one Yale ran country.

However; agree using analogy probably work way intended to. gotta tough room happens, power change outcome. ""I told so"" fix situation. wanna know didnt take 2 weeks? got idiots like rest us share oxygen with. like getting mad something caused.  agree. Carriers phone manufacturers become real fucking dipshits regard. bought phone off-contract unlocked, still can't remove trash stock apps bought phone unaware form rooting exists it. almost undeniable beginning thing worldwide catching documenting 1/10 cases (if that) may catching higher %.

It’s hard find analogy works data shows young people die get severely sick I’m going live fear it. personal opinion doesn’t mean don’t follow mask, social distancing, etc. guidelines public. reason VOTE, tell friends vote, administration shit show It’s incredibly common and, fact, routine vaccine study. fact, it’s highly unlikely illness even caused COVID part vaccine. could reaction MMR base often used vaccine trials or, likely, it’s completely unrelated. look disease vaccine trials success rate 85% they’ve gotten stage 3 trials. brainwashed. 
Prove numbers (that got CDC) wrong.

You're hoping long term effects. see flu. Prove wrong.

You're covid enthusiast dwindling numbers. People waking up. dumb anti masker. Go pray Jesus something flyover state. Imagine wanting leopards eat face. even remotely thing. duck infectious viruses. Yes! dad talking something Facebook effect instead protesting argument was, wear masks kids sit school lunch, they're allowed off. Like what? 7 day average August 1st 13.2%, August 11 10.7%, yesterday 9.0%.

In less 40 days gone around 33% still trending down. No, I'm saying healthy people educations homes end productive life, making money paying taxes, people end homeless disabled. mention kids could lead others DIE. Regardless fare virus, could infect reinfect others party, resulting unnecessary spread disease. Anyone covid positive traveled party likely interacted passed people outside car gas station store way there. mention anyone party would leave lots covid droplets infectious particles hands, clothes, shoes, etc. hard lockdown never possible open society. There's point asking something can't have. makes sense now...

All anyone US scream yell can't handle people's opinions. live Tampa vast majority bars open. places closed primarily breweries, figured way serve food. last one know closed opening today new food license. Seems like waste now, known coming.

Granted, pure bars, outside clubs, common here. places least nominal food offerings.

It's going shitshow, though. true, fear blue ocean event next years.  simply dishonest say teachers work hours 180 days year. Also I'd like remind anyone reading comments teachers drastically underpaid. Starting salary teachers area $35k/year yearly raises barely matching inflation. oh worry.

I going hunker school 500 unmasked individuals, like winter.

&amp;#x200B;

the cool thing several members school board voted go back person instruction ""plan"", even enter building board meetings. US locked gotten yet places. areas hit hard early see exactly situation Sweden. 

Lockdowns stop virus. simply slow down. point lockdowns manage hospitalization, somehow people measuring success eradication effort. never purpose. I'm wear masks flu season. I? Keeps nose warmer winter, smile strangers, come cute patterns match outfit. forget go back offices, pack public transport, frequent bars restaurants! 

I fly back London tomorrow 6 weeks work I'm fucking dreading it. last thing want get plane stay England 6 weeks people idiots...can't wait quarantined way home 😬 well germans MUST something right. throughout history, even constant battles kings rhineland all, braunschweigh, always seem find way build might. came world war 1...they almost ransacked won. cowardly leader surrendered. pay reparations still built powerhouse ww2....then got annihilated ww2....and built one richest stable countries planet. even that.

they MUST something right Source? Summer ending, think Europe getting glimpse fall/winter. hope maintain control it. They're difference remembered failure UKs Trump. too. guess kids=guinea pigs “Nah bruh, it’s bad. even HEAR CDC said? you’re young healthy you’re fine, bro. people literal pre-existing conditions risk” /s Good point agree. Barring legitimate medical reason to, *please* get flu shot. need many people possible get one Fall. 

I suppose really truly ever close contact outside home, could skip it, odds eventually to. point need go doctor's office, auto repair shop, grocery pharmacy, need home maintenance, wait crowded DMV, talk someone understand personal space...  Recent ""weeks."" one cited still incomplete. bad comparison start, makes even dumber. Problems get solved reddit comment sections.

Everyone soapboxing.

If soapboxing rich people implementing policies benefit rich hurt poor, fits narrative agree with, would welcome that.

If point worst part poor poor people, disagree, I'm solving problems soapboxing.  isn’t. disease deadly. level spread currently makes society general safer 2017-2018 flu season.

It's flu. correct, doesn’t happen summer.

Didn't say that. Really ? thought Trump gonna win January thought Biden leading short margin (almost tied) last poll saw 2 months ago (I'm America really know political atmosphere US). think say there's high probability Trump winning tied ? infectiousness symptom?   Issue vulnerable mainly die. young die outliers done. know can't scare everyone scary most. ווט איז ארטיקל?! ספיק היברו, סטופיד! Lol imagine thinking supporting Bernie Sanders made Boot Licker. 

LOL. Agree. Nov 2016, thought way troll could win. 

Now, think there’s ***excellent*** chance he’ll get re-elected. months pandemic shown deplorable shape US voters 😣 likely, extremely left, hate biden. 96 crime bill, history racist politics, politician ban guns lifetime, support medicare all? Go home wet noodle. May* elaborate mean ""ideological bubble spoiled""? girl Texas, I'm curious wanna learn it, negatives positives  Easy comment hindsight late 2020. think it’s lower % first thought needed. you’d look individual cities like NY likes social bubbles aren’t infinite, therefore neither it’s spread.  Many people wearing masks, hell many even wash hands taking dump public restroom. according Trumps fault. significant people test positive virus symptoms. fact infected. I'm suggesting people get infected. LoL 🤣 ....giant meteor. Y'all saints. hope eventually place someday well, hope operate guys. Keep good work! That’s contact tracers’ job, they’re right now. remember check back week they’re done proof? room happens room happens scum pond skimmed well shit let hit biggest cry lmao.

Fewer leftists left standing end bad outcome. 

Blessed though fires burning west, degenerate fucks facing tribulation justice. small gym can’t change people. guy hates woman simply thinks they’re better one. 

The person he’ll likely make happy person digs grave. simp Bern, ironic. hell guys doing?

Value signaling. I'm depressed got courage comments Trump made Woodward. knows said. pretend remember simply shows gutless really willing stay silent Trump train continues go rails. I've lost respect him. Thats accurate all. United States perfect. die virus 0.2% death rate, it’s natural selection deserved it. Trump2020 Exactly.  2x people voted R last election LA county. change matter schools do.

on hand, there's covid outbreak school last week october, election locations would closed would massive effect.

election day also coincides end 9 week's period schools normally break (since closed election day), saying schools closed election day closed fall break, people know election day fall break is. also somehow tried compare total number deaths mid January number (where average number deaths 59k) august August number (where average number deaths 51k) go ""this one 12k higher""

Pretty clear care facts. pushing agenda. Lol, analogies hilarious. mask. wrong though. Misinformation valid opinion share here. Read rules. dunno. Even regulations still think traveling vacation needed right now. Sure go parks, lakes stuff locally there’s need travel real distance. There’s need it,But that’s opinion choose do. Part reason people take seriously. day emphatically tell two individuals put masks. people wear masks, disrespect safety others, along bigger risks coronavirus exposed everywhere go. dropped ball hard initial response. actually advised us wear masks. Like, holy shit dumb. fair, meat factories NEED continue. could take week two off. vegan even close, saying. 

But know mean. plenty places need stay open. thought summer since goes away warm weather! /s mean like active pandemic task force? Sure would smart! strategies would seem work small family business focused nepotism maintaining control super successful business. (They also short sighted). 

I wonder much similar attitudes translated support. Tri state area? Really? He’s referring entire nation whole. want local news listen local news station. 😂😂 people still care bullshit holy hell don’t use recent week. that, tends pretty accurate. right course. People *killed*.

Well, actually wrong, they're also oppressed. killed. guess means they're longer oppressed, dead all. kind business run? What's documentary? I'd like give watch.  There's good news story showing already miniscule covid hospitalization rate kids actually lower thought.  Yeah wearing masks seems big ask too, masks? asking antagonistically curious. % total resistance. Gets herd immunity. absolutely correct. don’t use recent week. import things. Small, isolated countries always higher living expenses. course, two main drains obsession oppressing brothers sisters supporting hassidic population, many work. yeeah, people think wearing mask fascist Corona hoax. Thats gathered Berlin demonstration also thats numbers covid rising (with way higher number cases diagnosed till now, type people would fight infection tea ""power crystals"" instead visiting doc). experience. spooky.

Then sent youngest kid back preschool sick 3 days. people fighting multiple illnesses once. know get winter colds, flus, etc etc several months, toss covid top get even difficult situation.

beyond that, spread bit since people likely inside. don’t care happens rest you. 

Glad you’re well hope something that’s going softens heart I'm educated kids own. What's tiresome grown adults understanding they're throwing rights away name ""public safety"". I've seen happen several times course life, I've never seen come back. remember time Patriot Act? remember time TSA? remember time PRISM? 

If people never fought ""FreEduMZ!"", we'll still wearing masks 2024 people still get flu loss human life unacceptable. careful ""FreEduMZ!"" give without question. 

Just aunt whoever posts cringey ""FreEduMZ!"" memes facebook mean everyone advocates freedom security idiot. kind advocacy *why* people allowed protest make dumb comments Reddit, like have. Thats accurate all. United States perfect. die virus 0.2% death rate, it’s natural selection deserved it. Trump2020 sick Christmas UK intense/unusual respiratory virus I've ever I've legit flu before.

Started pain right rib cage weird think much it. Within hours started feel lethargic developed muscle/joint aches.

Went bed woke night raging fever absolute agony. Developed dry racking unproductive cough eventually led nearly calling ambulance Christmas day struggling breathe. thought developing pneumonia.

I lost sense taste smell (not congested) eyeballs felt like vice. turn head look particular direction would make wince caught something corner eye.

Thankfully, next week so, breathing improved OK - though I've days since felt ""off"" aches, lethargy breathlessness.

My theory thus:

 (in UK - likely many countries) spreading among young/able back Nov/Dec - mean generalise ageist statistically, older people likely home/indoors colder/winter months. Young people work ""partying"" Christmas period ramps up. Nobody tested point even know existence. Hospital admissions however EIGHT times higher normal leading Christmas UK ""flu like illness"" ""respiratory symptoms"". 

Eventually reached tipping point virus seeded vulnerable community simply exploded resulting sharp rise hospital admissions death.

As lock-down implemented progressed, virus eventually ran course vulnerable community fizzled back transmitting among young able again. There's scientific logistical basis calling impossible. told people 2019 would locked like this, people would said impossible. 

There's also nothing Taiwan US done. textbook preparedness execution. chance Taiwan epidemiologist vice president. knew inevitable, [Bill told us inevitable. one cared everyone wanted save dime waste somewhere else. are. That’s right. excess deaths. putting perspective flu season. Everyone already knows that. less social. shock traveling around Scandinavia. Shut down. parents arguement im refusing go Thanksgiving Christmas unless virus gone. way hell im risking getting anyone sick. don’t lose shit shit year. complicate life. America breeding ground anti-vaccination 

What earth makes think getting news reddit?

The anti-vaxx movement founded Europeans strongest Guys there's pandemic someone symptoms semantics far resistance? avoid small restaurant nobody wearing mask, giant Target nearly every single person wearing mask? No.

Between masks protecting infection masks reducing severity infection (lower viral load infection means longer run time virus, gives immune system time figure starts going cytokine storm) masks seriously reduce rate death. messaging masks screwed get go. First said masks work enough masks. can't even grasp level stupidity. Look every poor fuck Asian country, think wearing N95s?! No, wearing whatever mask could gather even meant fashioning everyday clothes. Second said ""wear protect others"". No, wear protect _as well as_ others. Although hard know much clear messaging beginning would helped de-politicize issue. almost like American people love apocalypse movies unfit handle real emergencies. Lmao wtf  even done bare minimum suppress virus. isn’t. disease deadly. level spread currently makes society general safer 2017-2018 flu season. correct, doesn’t happen summer. **M**uck **F**iami. fair DC (surronded lax Virginia Maryland covid policies) done pretty good strict job keep virus bay. Still work done get daily testing rate &lt;= 1% considering ""island"" surrounded increased case loads good job. saying possible generally agree county county differences whack. doesn’t even seem like need hunker down. That’s thing. vast, vast majority people get recover small percentage, 94% pre existing conditions, chance dying. tri-state area. country quarantined 2 solid months. Testing everywhere.
Tracing also thing. We’re already this. thought US greatest Country World? Unfortunately there's hell lot idiots. Omfg. week pointing incomplete.🤦 can't even afford stuff myself. pretty high assumptions small business makes. Fellas, don’t actually read article, wind scared wildly misleading statements like this. 

The fact hasn’t peer reviewed give everyone pause. It’s great we’re focused studying covid, enthusiasm led publication much research hasn’t properly reviewed ... many cases we’ve
gotten big scary headline rushed studies, somehow never really notice studies get retracted. definitely schools, Italy average 1400 per day schools still closed, even want postpone 14th 24th september  And? teaching school would exposed dozens kids staff covid19. happened February. 700 dollars doctors bills multiple visits tests. never could tell wrong me. 

I got antibody test 6 months later negative covid, antibodies probably gone, anyway. No. people bored. That's it. can't handle home long. stupid.  Man, wish energy even much...

What done since basically April 1: weeding. Lots weeding (had sod removed front yard january). Lost 10lb gained back. Put maybe week spare time new cross stitch project currently mothballed yet again... get top level diablo 3 season got little robot pet... drawing... work, bare minimum keep household running. guess im saying antigen testing individual level isnt useful publuc health standpoint.

It's real function random assessments spread.

At least much better idea immunity such. Im sure someone somewhere eating somebody. “I can’t *SEE* virus, trust doctors scientists? Welp, gotta get back church curry favor god thanks guidance robed pedophiles.” Canada reason (keep getting snatched frontline workers get them). stupid, hardly excuse throw expert advice perpetuity. I'm sure thought (fervently hoped) he'd never position Reagan f'ed handling AIDS crisis. Well university hybrid course safe Interestingly enough covid would soon (if already) reach 1 million deaths end September would mean least 1 60 people died year likely died covid. That's leadership is. able delegate. Donald incapable that. willingly lied American people service Mammon took priority American lives. Opt take out. September 11th. people fought wars spent trillions avenge deaths 2,000 Americans killed date 19 years ago. pandemic nearing 200,000 dead yet problem mind. 

I guess say confidence Sept 11th big deal; 2,000 people died. war terror silly anyways, right. measures also made mockery basic human rights essentially expropriating private property. Mom-and-pop business owners told shut doors indefinitely or face arrest. unemployed told illegal work living careers deemed “nonessential.” Police officers beaten citizens “social distancing” mothers manhandled cops attempting use playground equipment. That's false. Read note. 60% submitted within first 10 days. Go back 4 weeks compare week last year. Yeah, kind silently taking again. state back worst levels climbing, governor seem interested going back lockdown. friend mine works manufacturing people COVID - suspect future.  hard know much clear messaging beginning would helped de-politicize issue.

Nothing could prevent Trump finding way politicize this. matter couldve happened, Trump gets dividing public. chance whatsoever. Flu. People unfortunate enough get flu Covid time bad trouble. too! breakfast restaurants? Ive wife kids pre-pandemic small dining room open windows, packed full elderly patrons. thing think old enough care yet another thing potentially kill them. ones prepare Apocalypse type events want work chaos anarchy thats would power since preparing it, learning loot things use normal things arnt around anymore That's false. Read note. 60% submitted within first 10 days. Go back 4 weeks compare week last year. That's tell pay ""market rate"" make pay 3x much health insurance plus pass along sky high personal stop loss medical costs offer 401k options make cover 6.7% SS taxes company would normally take on. Paying 1099s highway robbery. German here. correct, every state responsible end, beginning national leadership (not chancellor, but, example, also national health minister) actually lead implementing nationwide rules co-operation leaders states. overarching leadership next non existent US IMO. get might bit difficult get 50 states one table 16, least outside seems even try. country never get first ""surge."" basically learned operate normal ""covid measures"" put place. highly doubt anything going shut anything else done try lessen cases. Right US living covid. guess politicians love body counts None Zero chance true 2030 right. isn’t flu. 

SO STOP TRYING EQUATE TWO. Yeah, noticed well. think people amplify public message actions. 

Like something forefront, important thing need everything power stay safe, soon ""boring"" them, stop even bare minimum.

It happened sister. Every day texting updates - spreading, spreading. Halfway first lockdown started hosting workout sessions friends house. started going church. traveling totally convinced God protect anyone matters virus.

I'm honestly looking forward Christmas. COVID still danger, metrics be, going shitshow trying explain family want crowd house every extended family member Christmas celebration.  walked bar pick food - out, already paid for. wearing mask. even place 3 minutes got harangued jerkoff bar wearing mask. ignorance aggression inescapable seems. Can't second surge first surge never ends. \*taps temple\*  Super healthy newly graduated MD.

Were working hospitals around covid patients? lot young healthcare workers seem get bad high viral load exposure receive field. Facts. actually suspicious dad January, we'd traveled internationally cruise ship less two weeks hospitalized symptoms (and helped sick Chinese tourist back boat guy got fatigued snorkeling make back own), many friends like ""I feel well last October; Covid."" Sigh.

No guarantee even dad it! Understand speaking evil. ones demanding **right** **freedom** harm kill others. dealing moral ethical people. dealing petty, cruel, selfish. \^This. honestly biggest concern. everything read appears long term effects could hit harder actual virus, especially children. huge spike multisystem inflammatory syndrome children believed linked COVID. kind illness cause long term side effects.  sick generation children go heart damage already failing healthcare system needs US. already dealing childhood obesity, liver damage, diabetes children shit food country. Let's add issue. precise attitude got elected last time ""everyone laughed him, idiots believe him"". Boom, half country idiots. 

And frankly half learned lesson, maybe they're also idiots. wonder though; country huge diverse United States, even competent president, would things gone differently?

Bush handled SARS-1. Obama managed Swine Flu. neither rapidly infectious COVID-19, messaging cases much cohesive response much aggressive. never lost control viruses, outbreaks infections clamped kept turning waves.  jealous jump high  hospitals aren’t overwhelmed stop massive restrictions.

That's exactly end overwhelming hospitals. massive restrictions exist anymore though? state one stricter ones restrictions left required masks (not big deal), restaurant indoor capacity 25% (goes 50% week), must order meal want alcohol, can't sit bar, alcohol stops served 11pm (going 10pm week curb college kids).

Unless consider wearing mask going large indoor events ""massive restrictions"" I'm even sure upset about. Things normal without something force another complete lockdown like opening schools (which already started well). lead narrowing past weekz- trajectory talking about. Many withing statistical error prediction- exactly like 2016. good railroad crossing people ignore flashing red lights? Liberté, Egalité, Infirmité Daily cases globally stable since late July deaths steadily dropped since time. 

That course gets discussion yet every spike increase gets mass upvoted. current increases almost entirely driven India recent spike Spain/France global picture thankfully stabilised criminally negligent government root cause assume bar getting nothing, employers getting UI.

I believe science I'm following guidelines. Cool. don’t vaccine already? medicines combat virus? Coincidentally, they're people made climate change Evolution political issues. Well, ideally, government would actually helping folks, fact government helping change reality. Creating situations (such bars open) encourage people go ensures going one worst-case scenarios unfurl winter. situation, guarantee bars going open anyway, added damage sick staff customers, least likely suffer long-term health damage. result infected government finally realizes there's choice shut everything again. I've said people told truth start. facing became crystal clear minute found virus could transmit people asymptomatic. suspect many business owners workers, instead living purgatory false promises bad information, would chosen walk away March look back, gone build new lives around new reality. 

And ""ridiculous"" Zoom holiday might sound, whole lot less ludicrous people trotting see elderly relatives, sharing food, sitting close proximity unventilated rooms highly-contagious, lethal virus circulating basically unchecked. BTW, live alone, I've already decided I'm spending holidays parents. 

Look, know difficult people. fact difficult change anything. change way virus transmits change fact better, far better, we've we're going get fall winter. hate too, Trumps going win current trajectory.

Trajectory what? Biden 10pt advantage polls nationally swing states well. Same. 

In February, stocking pantry paper goods called Chicken Little. March, pulled kids school week even talked closing. 

So today, it’s fine. Call whatever want. kids choosing distance learning option, getting dental truly essential things done right now, hunkering down. I’m wrong, great. Unfortunately, don’t think be. guess forgot ban one. Add growing list censored media sub. function communication via text. I've written corporate environments before. Sarcasm hard detect writing, especially consider Poe's Law. actually Ohio. Confusing know. douche bud... Wearing masks washing hands hard many absolute garbage people country.  fucked ""shut nation entire year.""  fucked people (I'm assuming one based idiotic post) can't absolute bare minimum.  Like almost every country did. Needs welded inside point. words, look fucked american society government is. Good thing gave trillion away rich people corporations instead making possible people hunker basic income support. dumb article dumb conservative. didn’t lockdown long enough, need keep going, maybe well 2021. don’t need haircut Karen. unprecedented global pandemic show us importance Medicare people fucked medical debt lose coverage due bad economy pandemic, importance Universal Basic Income time like this, value Green New Deal West coast literally fire, know change.

I hope right. sad weeks Covid 19 started taking american health care industry rest economy American people turned person running president platform. I’m worst detecting sarcasm. based based  read two books 1990s remember top head warned pandemics: Coming Plague, Hot Zone. Hot Zone bestseller. 

Anyone paying attention knew coming.  Toilet paper? Biden would never dismantled pandemic response team CDC teams Beijing. would made orders magnitude difference. think missed part waited county 3 MILLION people 0/1 death per day. Would like wait negative deaths per day? “Waiting miracle”. heard one before? We're pissed know help. bigger covid, bigger single issue politician. much country anti education. even begin fix that? idea permanently stop virus lockdowns outside small population completely surrounded water proven. Cases Europe strict lockdowns rise. ""We're calling controlling things feel control.""   ☃ 

Get flu shot November. know someone who's skeptical, show video maybe it'll No, eat sour patch kids concurrent drinking Red Bull. 

Totally taste!! It’s awesome.

I say faith humanity restored little knowing people love sour patch kids much do. No, misrepresentations false misleading. example, sharing link CDC's website comorbidities declaring 6% pre-existing conditions. say that. Sharing link cell cross reactivity declaring restrictions unnecessary half world already immune. say that. misrepresentations. Yet, comments often left untouched. Okay clickbaity. means still first surge. definitely second. Trump lost popular vote 3M. margin victory 70k voters across 3 states. Dem candidate high unfavorables, lot folks assumed would win. Trump none advantages time around. parents teachers they’re forced work even though feel completely reckless unsafe. dad high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pre-Diabetic mom benign tumor head. I’m extremely worried them, don’t wanna lose parents age 20, feel like choice - feel jobs valuable lives extremely sad :(  That's second wave always worse. started saying 6 months ago people got bored 2 weeks. Welcome Armageddon Actually first cases early year Bavaria. something illness-wise happening Europe around lol. Malta, Hungary Czech Republic September, lost voice, stop coughing, otherwise felt pretty healthy. Similarly you, think Covid, bug. underestimate undereducated masses attention critical thinking.

Sans culottes Follow weeks. Write check back update. find, did, adjustments made second week. Made chuckle, nice wordplay :-) amazing traced positive case nearly 3 weeks lockdown began March 17 Can’t second surge never finish first 🧠  known cases transmitted wash hands taking dump public restroom, though data bit suspect, since nobody wants get close enough survey people. believe restaurant results also believe masks critically important. appear help little. *a lot* idiots American electorate... imagine top field decades sidelined needed most. unique frustration. fact deleted removed says lot. Nope. Sad think you’re delusional want /s next truth. point stands. facility meant create smarter generation, sure don’t act smart. state jump last week? we're unlucky 2025 take Swedish model. Mark words, beginning Nov 4, incumbent loses media reporting COVID quickly turn optimism minimizing virus. live Paris still see daily... Jesus Christ. dependa shit I’ve ever heard. *“Just print money give us lowly commoners box food we’ll shut up! Please daddy please!”* minimum balance wave bank fees $3000... doubt it’s president. People don’t give shit. time people listen feds it’s rallying time war. Otherwise, it’s always “fuck feds”. infuriating depressing.

RIGHT?! sister, distancing all, came visit mom, gotten surgery. mom contracted COVID, would never forgiven her.

I'm stressed enough killing someone know - hell people nonchalant thing even think people close them. here, that's said fuck next week parents. Would nice party end day about. need keep waiting god knows long please Great Aunt Hortense. scary part lot obvious morons especially lately. knew always fair share ignorance around discouraged find estimates many people like wildly underestimated. would lying said hasn’t changed world views made much cynical cautious people. meantime Green Party/Kanye Party/whoever still fighting get onto ballots nationwide siphon indie votes. 

If Gary Johnson Jill Stein 2016 conversations. Let's forget that. Hmmm... wonder people deny people two x chromosomes people x chromosome. think know mean, want say directly current political environment ;-) Maybe part Trump turning mask political signalling tool?

Just guess... Death totals places locked compared locked never locked make pretty clear lock downs do, fact, work. Sure, hard, take government stepping job effective, still ultimately succeed goal reducing number dead individuals. transferring germs one contaminated elbow elbow another person crazy talk haircut ridiculing people vain, people fact losing jobs en masse, falling poverty, allowed attend funerals dying lack medical care. ain't haircut, already obvious, it? Especially since mayor Jaws still mayor Jaws 2. people surviving infection walking hospital severely compromised lungs hearts, brain damage, compromised lymph nodes bad breath. They're called long haulers. Man think we're depressed much reason point. disheartening grow long time things less getting better, see kind radical backsliding idiocy.

I imagine would exponentially worse someone who's spent life trying improve things, who's seen lot shit go till now.   fauci shouldn’t negative even slightest bit positive news comes out, trust guy demeanor soured somewhat many options still use Wells Fargo. were, are, continue lying shitbags. know say this. still can’t believe Doug fucking Ford managed handle thing well grace even. &amp;#x200B;

If boat 2 holes, plugging 1 hole isnt ""half good"" plugging holes. bad three lifetimes ago 2020 timeline. exactly shocked GOP passed new stimulus distribute month October. Maybe like 70 years old, perhaps looks relatively ok. cannot agree said more. messaging problem. point people WOULD taking seriously messaging consistent ignoring they're hearing anything administration longer.

That said, yeah, we're hopeless. We're past point return misinformation. People repeating fake claims justify ability dine restaurants again, really hopefully get sensible leaders soon

If don't, think COVID might least worries, honestly. sarcastic, thanks link. China's official figures likely bullshit. Take grain salt. 

Better compare country like NZ  take concoction melted brain? true, concern past 4 years constant indoctrination prepping loss. He's said ""The way going lose election rigged."" base convinced mail-in ballots terrible (but absentee, except Florida that's ok *reasons*).

With millions millions mail-in ballots year likely favoring Biden probable end Nov 3rd appear Trump ahead ton places, slowly next several days shift Biden ballots get counted. yell scream say ""See! told rigged! making many votes need!"" zero evidence.

But evidence matter, comes mouth Dear Leader. base concern. need needed national plan.The UK ITALY GERMANY right thing getting everyone board even don’t like it.

I fear longest coldest deadliest winter US history. Ah, thank you! anything 1 means virus infecting rate higher virus dying off? similar scientific ways many cynically opportunistic ones. Remember AIDS big deal them, killing ""the gays"" hurt power? Maybe dumb retrospect, good reasons time.

The big one N95s type mask seemed effective protecting wearer, *really* wanted avoid public hoarding those, needed healthcare professionals - that's still true.

The degree protection offered mask (any mask) infected person (the entire reason wear now) simply understood. Even vaccine released today, I'd almost willing put money least quarter third country would refuse take it. need dedicated counter teacher deaths. you... Uh... New United States? uh, away past 4 years so? Bad move Finland! ""I'm gonna post comment specific circlejerk subreddit! show you!"" death sentence reddit don’t think people necessarily saying needs one size fits single strategy, needs strategy, disagree claim they’ve implemented strategies. implemented measures, strategy implies plan policy. Unless count:

As Whitmer statements. Think this. knowing know Trump’s knowledge Woodward tapes, Trump strategy appears downplay publicly advocating re-open, time, taking different approach behind scenes. Remember briefings Birx others said watching states cities risk surging closely? Well, live one areas, governor and/or mayor indicated they’ve contacted feds concern outbreaks. seems Trump perfectly fine leaning states cities behind scenes, pretending like everything fine publicly (remember Liberate Michigan tweet?), leaving governors mayors blue areas take brunt taking action response, least part, federal guidance. time, GOP governors like DeSantis failed act pretty much endorsed despite states seeing huge surges.

That’s strategy alright, one election, pandemic. almost making vaccine difficult caring safety takes time I'm bit familiar education system, since studied German forever brief exchange. states, people love idea Germany offers free college, realize school system setup described. People moving standardized tests exams count large portion grade, surprised hear ""cut-off"" college prep school happens young. 

College US expensive, yes, different German school. short visit University Osnabrueck, pretty much equivalent US high school far optional facilities. Osnabrueck cafe pretty simple... schools US extravagant food options, advertise students. There's food stations staffed cook-to-order chef, there's multiple fast food places, smoothie bars, sit meals, to-go sandwich shops... lavish gyms, entertainment, activities, private dorms private bathrooms... College experience here, pay far education. pandemic response team Wuhan relay information US breaks China.

Trump dismantled it. world would known much earlier contagious deadly virus is, taken seriously. also trust president would relayed information, lie keep economy going. least listen experts go briefing say disappear. 

Italy got hit badly beginning one sports teams went Wuhan event possibly brought back Italy. kisses grandma's cheek later know happened. 

So logically adequate information response would recommended much earlier, deaths would significantly lower US, extension worldwide. Yea, Im bunch mom groups lot women part type essential oil beauty pyramid business. Lately they've individually posting pro-Candace Owens stuff. Even covid see MLM events happening can't help think suburban mommies mini-Republican rallies events. lot women groups. guess we'll see.  Here's example- Trek buying smaller bike shops around US. worries right? 

Well, happening Trek's deals smaller dealers (who obviously want sell something well know name trek) cause overstock crowds brands. Dealer goes debt Trek buys huge discount turn staff much poorly paid employees brands distribution chains choked off.

Standard practices right? However, consequences salaries local areas depressed, service levels diversification go down, Trek (privately held) concentrates efficiencies.

To extent Government helps happen- stocks (even privately held corps make economy) especially relatively small number publically traded companies. stocks soar (short term) even economy slowly fragments. Stock markets up, wages down. money central bank printing loaned someone need make money need put somewhere economy far, else go? *looks US next*  trying compare total deaths kinds point time pandemic total deaths flu season. diseases different though. different death rates.

And thus comparison irrelevant. 

This actually getting kinda funny. Hey guys, I'm head back office soon we're unable cook use microwave.

Just wondering takeaways restaurants food courts (especially fast food) dangerous well?

Say cook infected droplets virus dropped food, still risk serious illness possibly hospitalised permanent damage? Yeah fuck lol must really fun parties Panicking never helps. Remember toilet paper fiasco? I'm *still* sure happened. would love Democrats formally add platform. Would make Trump win likely. I'd agree you; unreasonably affect them. However, side that, rural America nature socially distanced. Social activities outdoors, less people going stores/shops, towns isolated travel destinations, people tend travel small towns. 

It seems mask mandate thing people complaining far lack action executive branch. What’s lockdown like? go outside, exercise, ect? data error showing past excess deaths recent. Lockdown skeptics huge circle jerk it, turned nothing, says alot quality arguments. bad middle class essentially wiped out. You’re either millionaire peasant point. It’s mind blowing talk people age living paycheck paycheck can’t seem understand wealthy elitists is, fact, OK. That's *exactly* want go away. disrupts otherwise-lockstep messaging. reproduction number virus. Anything 0.9 good.

Basically, means larger number, people infected pass on. confined Wuhan, estimated number least 5. opposition party made political start complaining insulting president every step. opposition ever, even once, offered set aside partisanship work together would better place. Alas. Nearly exactly like what’s happening US. Fuckin lollllll 
Yeah, we’re fucked case numbers falling rising. thread literally circle jerk promises avoid restaurants longest disinfects surfaces touch lmao won’t force socialist one-rule us. Either we’ll kill enough happens, die fighting it. Either way won’t ever rule us, keep pants. im blessed lucky work home meantime.

Yeah, wife works home, I'm mostly safe turn jobs feel put danger (and have, hope vaccine

I agree. We're far gone. admin care keeping messaging consistent, people bored.

That said, I'm actually bit nervous vaccine uptake, honest. Couple fact not-insignificant amount US fallen weird-ass conspiracy theory fact there's possibility government totally screws rollout vaccine I'm nervous see successful deployment. Great, goes afternoon operate, taxed income, like business. Adjust population.

It last next summer anyway. (1) testing. since people (always) asymptomatic mild, testing keeps increasing ""case death"" count reach full testing... still haven't. 

(2) Also, we're getting better treating it, also means lower death per case average. example, remember early on, everyone certain ventilators crush get everywhere? seemed logical, since disease transmitted via respiratory system breathing difficulty big symptom, turns out, know, [that's tiny piece whole one trying make claims it. one needs provide information. Given already proven wrong last week data adjusting, whole lot credibility here. Trump Jareds fault. Fauci working hands tied Trump must approve anything said first months. think we'll see normalcy returning around mid 2021. It'll slow drift first, vaccines hit we'll see second wave people decide safe go way soon, we'll see infections slowly decline. mid 2021, developed world vaccinated we'll hand wringing developing world (but *actually* anything significant help). 2022 pretty much over, COVID another annual flu. collective mentality cultivated trusted leaders. can't everyone thinks head honcho fool. something built one head state single term, improved torn one. I'll need source believe that. whole sub blocking removing stories you, really need block personally (not care) People seem confuse potential genetic predisposition eugenics. Even asking question freak out. /s ? too. Buy cheap panic buying starts.

As naturally paranoid bastard stock 2 week menu, plus treats break e.g. bonfire night , trick treat, (Christmas pudding ☹ )
Don't go crazy buy years worth supplies. enough couple weeks surplus need rely shops delivery companies. interesting. Thanks. Looks like spoke soon masks mandatory shops, school corridors private gatherings limited 50. original point still stands countries proactive closed borders kept virus OUT, countries like Austria live restrictions. trade-off worth it

The problem tradeoff worth population level individual level. example, wearing masks slow spread much worth society terms health (less spread) economics (keeping r0 low contact tracing means reopen *stay reopened*). substantial minority USA feel simple, visible, measure reduce spread protect vulnerable somehow admission weakness; ""mask = weak"" meme gone viral certain social cliques, meaning wearing mask becomes significant social risk many people scared face even means social group survives longer. Building whole city year. Jesus. Thanks. believe science helps lol they're gonna start 2 weeks better washing hands often. gotta get mucous membranes infect you, happen whether wearing gloves decide rub eyes poke nose virus airborne. asked lab person drawing blood shrugged said well nothing that! clean everything. Guess I'm different reality.  Child developmental risks. listening UN briefing laid pretty well. Statistically risk groups likely unable conduct school home (lack parental support, internet access, ability handle online learning). means education would disrupted gap, statistically leads significantly higher drop rates. term many using risk ""Lost Generation"" large portion risk kids around world thrown curb skilled job opportunities thus face future economic hardship going forward. Additionally many students rely school services (food, therapy, accademic assistance) lead issues stay home. There's also side issue someone essential worker, school sort serves free day care service that's needed family generate enough income survive. 

Lot big picture, top phycological development concerns, middle upper class families may seem pressing, require full implementation effectively operate. Fiber fruit slows absorbtion Actually make enough meet bank minimums pay fees, pay credit cards monthly get free points/cash back, access best loan rates. Freedom religion constitutional right yet religious gatherings banned states.

Also, protesting constitutional whether oppressed not. could 10,000 people protesting together tomorrow getting free Oreos government every day it’s valid protest BLM. kinda weird included word ‘oppressed’ take much vitamin too. Find what's healthy ammount you, take amount only. There’s like 25 Cal State campuses. agree protection faculty minds, end, certainly concerned lawsuits said professors might bring university get sick. Ultimately. think making decision already spring semester seems early, CSU thinks benefit harmful, power them.  WTF? Certainly value comments. good example Egyptian man lit fire stand taken. nothing left lose, people nature take rich them. 

The rich know, numbers game. gatekeepers open gates slink back crowd point.   God shut up. everyone reddit whiny ***loser***? mean literally, like website worst sad sack, unlucky neanderthals. fans already Chiefs game. Noice! $38.40 per essential worker. Like class action lawsuit checks never get. /s 

Yes, know everyone participate. maybe closed schools actually wait 2 weeks! Muh 3% death rates They've already announced subject transverse myelitis (aka rather serious) Kentucky less 4.5 million people entire state. That's half population NYC, put perspective. also large state densely populated.

In perspective, that's actually pretty bad number. That's fucked up, Zuck hella true brand. Soon FB nothing memorial pages. one going able tell individuals habit wearing wearing masks outside work. government going help people. don’t understand people aren’t furious. It’s really abusive relationship government don’t understand whole job protect you. Yes continue pushing thr destruction restaurant industry... someone stuck indoors two toddlers less 24/7 since March, switch places? 

But real, safe consider risks everything do. see friends, quarantine ask same. Don’t visit immunocompromised people circumstances. literally hate them, I'm pretty disheartened behavior. I'm going try change minds, watch either. Facebook ads targeted surgical precision. =/ get probably embarrassed usual go stuff fat ass food regular basis, that's problem. Go troll somewhere else, dipshit. way ability socially distance teachers keep falling ill, classes already full is, social distance. teacher out, there's replacing that. subs go get, really. one looking sub places. schools already understaffed. kids go another room now, class turn 30 50 students is. start well. end even worse, bet it. Im pretty sure decent justification this. Protecting faculty one. CSU system much progressive private schools state schools. virtual classes save money probably much. guarantee everyone would rather actual classes session they’d probably prefer accused trying scam students already are. BLess sane person. introduced fight fire fire. Early resistance testing, masks, etc. evidence shadows. Governments wanted contagious less deadly backfire spread compete less contagious deadly strain knew let loose. Scientists working gain function multiple strains already hopper likely. bottle around quick squirt thorough hand washing.

...my hands shriveled fallen *yet.* in... water wet! It’s going country since March don’t mask go prison  agree, It’s drum beat. Apparently grandma doesn’t matter Knowing top professional feels important me. I'll adhere advice much possible understanding history incomplete. Peasant revolutions occurred regular rate much history, peasants easily slaughtered one cared. uneducated and, know dead, unable record deeds prosperity actions reduced minor footnotes history ruling classes incentive glorify deeds. Diagnoses colon cancer went 46% March April Prevent Cancer Foundation, 35 percent Americans cancer screening scheduled pandemic missed released Irish Times show across three programmes, 248,223 people screened January June 2019; compares 99,286 people seen first six months year.

Sadly likely right. Hopefully people back getting checked surprised see situation India possibly write stuff us haha. still didn’t respond factual comment Alaskans ‘vitamin Drink. Why? can’t. Alaska oil money past? Yeah, fortunate stocked early first time. Basically ""that guy"" started saying would soon, started prepping long haul. 

Now he's saying vaccine available election... we're slowly stocking non-perishables again. tiny car, there's plenty garage space! I'm sure point is. think agree...? I'm saying would serious resurgence across major populous areas areas country already hard-hit, precisely there's way ""remaining"" metropolitan areas (that hit yet) could possibly support many deaths.

First all, would point already well 1k deaths per day 7 day average, cases continuing decline recently, there's reason expect that's going go anywhere least another weeks, even cases start spiking whatever reason, national cases (a much leading indicator deaths) falling fairly uninterrupted fashion since late July. average 1k deaths per day end year, we'd ""only"" somewhere around 310k deaths end December - nowhere near 410k predicted. going widespread second wave hit number. Easier troll Americans killing la Christchurch mount invasion. maybe started testing 😉 Yeah really rough time us California. la bise anymore, knock feet elbows together imitate la bise afar. Okay dude. Good luck. use WhatsApp chat immediate family. terrible tool keep updated extended family friends doing. heard others none circle probably pointless one using it. Depends who’s vaccination economy craves death going ad hominem attacks. real mature.

Esit: number ""one"" typo ""w"" tyoed instead ""e"". Lol spelling talking about? “Just wait it’s going magically disappear. 26 cases, it’s basically zero” stupid bullshit like that. — know New Jersey? didn’t mention wore masks not.
It said think contracted it, how. Ding ding ding! Lol... that's funny... actually first result. No, coincidence.  show skipped thinking somehow thought looking second result would make smarter.... that's cute.

Michael Osterholm (a leading US virologist) said could make vaccine diseases single day. part process rarely causes delay. could go regurgitate explanation takes long maybe believe government resource explaining why. cases everything lines perfectly, could done little 8 years.... 

With urgency, sure things go faster, lot road blocks there... $, willing study participants, high volume participants... clearly impossible. 

But thats said it? said health skepticism criticism good thing. I'm sure even pharmaceutical companies would welcome it. (I'm sure everyone would welcome it, except maybe you... one guy) Even true isn’t unconscionable let happen!? Condescending people like deserve shit going end vaccine enough go around everyone. It’s impossible safe. follow CDC guidelines I’m done staying home. Yeah money printer go bbrrrrrrrrrrrrr  call, try minimize collateral way out, k? anyone pays bills isn’t wealthy see situation sustainable. WhatsApp (or Kakao Talk, Signal, Telegram, Viber that’s still thing, WeChat #yolo personal data think cake emojis falling top screen say happy birthday super fun) incentive keeping fukn global society intact risking killing people yourself. yes, support, kind greedy individualistic mindset need ask what's weakest members society dieing this. get expanding foam plug drafty bit? (Or would fire hazard?)  would lot clever shown youself hurt anyone's feelings. think Derek Lowe legitimate scientist garbage paper garbage science share raw data bought paid authoritarians given benefit doubt even wrong, wrong made attempt right. $30 day! US ~$85 + whatever state amount (between ~$25 ~$100) net ~$110 ~$200. people even stay here. I'm sorry seem surprising numbers good. still regularly seeing thousand people die every day. Death rate might bad initially feared, still many times worse typical flu season.

Don't get wrong, feel cooped-up, want thought hovering head ""Did need go out, visit friends, fun, literally kill someone?""

The mask part insignificant. can't see reason anyone least keep time being. I've grown used it, honestly, it'll probably feel bit weird first time I'm public without one. mainly miss playing board games friends, I'm going risk lives it. have. long infected people quarantine, still might infect socially-conscious folks take precautions protect families. Everything looks orange living orange tinted glasses. Man hated people like that, always trying involve something other.

I want make friends coworkers. deal must. real friends, people actually like.


Out curiosity, happens switch jobs? Entirely new, also work-related, social circle every time? But, supporting evidence. states told prepare distribute vaccine Nov 1st. establishes timeline. hear something ""downplay"". ""downplay""? means tell American people truth. hear FDA controlled ""deep state"" bases vaccine approvals medical grounds.    

There plenty generate legitimate musings suspicions. create situation, didn't, certain somebody government payroll said enough create healthy skepticism.    

I skeptical hearing ""masks work"". skeptical, rule applies ""fool once"" shame you.    
But now, timeline issued states Nov 1st distribute vaccine, think musing ""Am fooled twice"" appropriate upon report working vaccine available, especially Nov 3rd. know assign blame we're fooled twice. Funny french getting shit us. 🤛  Yeah I’d rather die continue live like this. need start living this. 

Start living 1,000 deaths day? accept okay people like can't anything simple hunker down? part believes lot commenters teenagers whose parents white-collar jobs able work home. Also purposes counting covid deaths, USA literally counting everyone dies *with* sars-cov-2 dead *from* covid. think often u find hair ur food. 

Now virus much smaller. contagious. sub subject matter, large US contingent, ""no politics"" really means ""don't mean administration"".

I'm sure who's supposed fooled. I’ll take chances. still died covid, asshole. lower classes, historically peasant classes inherently revolutionary.

Might want read Chinese Revolution. Haitian revolution anybody? wish want people would like do, happen. different strategy needed.

It's working people like yourself. worked countries. per capita COVID deaths 10th 150 countries. It’s worse worrying paying fees. money, still free checking, leave couple grand account. sort thing happens everywhere, think there’s good long form piece titled something like “the high cost poor” lot examples. don’t get started unfair tax system wage earners vs passive income corporate taxes loopholes. think know mean. try talk someone well. we're human even therapists immune problems world. police stop killing people need streets. smells long term undercounting cases Florida. going get actual break. open bars many deaths reported per day, notice said reported Yeah. note Sweden recommending non-essential travel. It’s like get million Swedes borders this. would, would actually decrease infection rate UK... Cuz stoopid. Can't insulate walls, rent. cold space heater heat everywhere pipes freeze. need make rent, work. qualifications skills built around working people, jobs hiring retail/working hundreds people. 

Luckily I'm job love needed open hire everything opened up, safe pandemic job options. Agh. Macron doesn’t want go back lockdown wants Swedish model learning live Virus that’s less deciding sacrifice everybody age 65 years old acceptable country Taiwan never lock down, technically, everyone “hunker” paid government obeyed quarantine two weeks. people fresh plane contact confirmed cases quarantined. no. everything comparable.

like this, instance.

but then- probably given r/wooosh right bat.

instead letting earn second one. plain mean part. sorry. estimating overall cases based assumptions, requiring confirmation reinfection? clear double standard. Maybe quadruple standard since bar confirmation reinfection absurdly high requires 2 positive PCR test results samples different genetic strains collected least month two apart individual. 

The vast majority reinfections would probably occur family members passing back forth would probably genetically similar confirm reinfection. Add fact people seem recurring symptoms subside return limits testing mention intense pressures labs get picture. 

Comparing numbers pretending tells us something absurd. public places enforcing mandatory masks enter?? also living 13th century it’s flu... Yea doubt would last 4 weeks  making choices fear emotions. People always going die models initially provided.

This may dumbest thing I've read today. Yes, people going die. goal minimize number. 

The way staying inside away people much possible. wouldn’t give fence backyard house..... tell, ways prevent infection nothing help dependent people going NYC managed flatten curve. areas managed flatten curve. Certain states refuse follow procedure flatten curve, therefore past that. You’re spreading misinformation calling PR buzzterm. Thank much work please please forget well. Hmm i'm sorry bring Bad news thoses forms bought.. well litteraly free online could even wrote whole thing paper  would worked.
The selling part actually fraud got fined someone lives one cold areas totally get it. know, gets really cold people tend stay anyway. restaurants bars around make majority money summer fall. ideal better incredibly wasteful misallocation funds covid loans give us. basically unemployment insurance extra steps huge opportunity corruption.  Thank you! don’t even think discussing UBI point. Services first. Healthcare first. Housing assistance whatever. could get UBI rich devalue dollar stays worthless, like minimum wage. “Yes we’ll raise minimum wage peasants think they’re getting more, inflation increases devaluation dollar keeps place. “. know poor uneducated people see number go automatically think, “good”. Raising minimum wage carrot I’m front horse. $30 day say? would 1200 bucks 4 months, 4 months enough countries somewhat get control? unfair. also get money... oh wait! (salty dutch person didnt get govment money) Holland 3  still technically summer U.S.
Wait flu season hits. screwed. Exactly. family operates little lunch spot small downtown area. people want come sit eat exactly ones don’t trust. It’s gonna curbside service quite while. mom sister keep talking spring like everything magically better. slowly begun mentioning things back normal sometime 2022. first thought crazy, see... WhatsApp owned Facebook they've already [started integrating WhatsApp features Facebook Deleting Facebook using WhatsApp instead bit like boycotting Apple trashing iPad, using iPhone instead. There's way solve involve getting millions infected, government half competent. think changing international protocols right foolish. respiratory diseases slow Summer pick Fall. decision likely reversed 6 8 weeks cases start rising again. would easier hold fort see Fall brings changing international protocols. Wow free speech Happy hear that! What’s downvote brigade tonight? new posts downvoted. complete lockdown, like Wuhan, always effective. However requires certain clarity thought directness action authorities. Compared US cases deaths India probably hopelessly underreported. Imagine testing like rural parts India anywhere outside major cities Every disaster movie people deny there's problem pretend everything's fine seems much accurate now. cousin posted huge album pics friends grouped up, maskless, posing pictures. ""We survived pandemic summer #maga""

Like, even bother family? data hysterical...but ever read “Things won’t work with” blog? “Muh mental health muh future!” Why? put mammogram 3 months BC survivor, got nervous keep postponing it. hospital handled everything professionally possible. soon got home everything washed, disinfected showered. follow safety precautions good. 

Good luck Dad. Honestly, personally mind living this. say I've constantly clashing grandfather nearly whole year. Like we've clashed ton years pandemic, least work escape him. either avoid him, okay conservation him, decides ramble forever things done age done anything.

When hear people themselves, think utterly peaceful must be. arguments, chat people online close app done, need avoid someone space, etc.

And hate expression, guess case grass always greener side. I'm sure family sounds like bliss you. Lol

Btw, got message saying mods muted me. Weird since never messaged 🤔 y’all much dates? many places go visit right now, right? UK's test system failure still app. many comorbidities yearbook teacher have? still dick Funding program draws $24 million investment Governor's Education Emergency Relief (GEER) fund, part CARES act. 

Umm... $24 million divided 625,000 essential workers $38.40 per person. live China hate much anglosphere? Ok {insert generation born immediately WW2} newsflash, affect healthy ppl too!
most ppl...there’s absolutely effing words. argument, that's sentence expressing idiotic opinion. Please rebut assertions manner moves conversation forward, else STFU.  ...so 100 years Israel mostly uneducated fundies hate math science... worldometer picks up, going 1000 dead today. downvoted this?

Because non-sociopathts find frightening even people like die suddenly. Shhh facts nuance aren’t welcome Teacher's note: u/ericjk1, please show work. know death rates age, (should?) know ages people getting tested, surely maths would clear up? disappointing allowed all. wonder people resisting mixed messages. Wear mask always except place everybody take off. take Applebee's, must wear Safeway? There's also [organ [long term young, health people. think bit confusion ""recovered"" I'm pretty sure means they're free virus necessarily free health issues. living does, though.

The standard living places south something 3rd world country. true. strip search strip everything. total loss dignity every time go thru TSA screenings. Enough already. Wait, people actually enjoy going instead huddling around computer screens eating delivery fun?

-every single reddit user, happen anti social loners friend group Spain recorded 10,764 new cases 71 new deaths today. signs either France Spain slowing yet. Quite stunning many people still taking seriously there. Taken whole, class 3 college ready geniuses 20 crayon eating morons issues need addressed.

So what's website millions uninformed, overconfident neckbeards? campus burned down? Yes, someone else clarified this, However talking astrazenca vaccine vaccine China.  civil liberties crap irrelevant? really write that? want think said. want tell civil liberties willing give up, tell long willing give up. Would give right victim cruel unusual punishment, required meet excessive bail, help slow spread covid-19? think they've declining? get zero questions one third time enter Canada return US. know ratio how-many-passengers-to-question tend get grumpy socially-averse immigration officers, times take passport Nexus card, swipe look whatever mysterious info appears screen three seconds, hand ID back wave toward exit, wordlessly.

Seems either direction, American Canadian officers. told /r/coronavirus US rising cases everyone else beat virus?!? Oh that’s great! friend exposed needs negative test return minimum wage job can’t find anyone test doesn’t symptoms...but thank GOD find 2,000+ tests DAILY least vulnerable citizens. That's meet ""toxic positivity"" headline narrative though SAME!! mean...I already hated lot them, SAME!! Paper bag 7 days basically good enough reuse. Eventually wear (straps example) probably get months use one wear 1/7 days. Explains much ""pro lockdown"" support. Easy support lockdown mommy pays everything. Well based question asked, answer least one. Can't really close fraction business.

So let's go that. would suggest snakewaswolf? Declare complete countrywide lockdown residents? 6 months? year? Stop commerce, trade, diplomacy, everything? Bring back men women military locked home? appropriate response? nuking China? I’m trying get side fence you’re on. ‘Inept federal government every day worse last’. Sounds like government lot influence quite insignificant life. I’m doctor diagnosis depression. Get bubble. Open curtains. Get sun. People wear masks.. fuck cdc reasoning backwards. find unbelievable China locked hard merely thousands cases. back China highest number known cases novel virus. Nobody knew much severe could get China decided safe rather sorry killed equivalent Christmas shopping season get virus control. seemed unbelievable hindsight, countries (especially US) respond level lockdown number cases more. could case countries got many cases exactly respond like China did. real? Jesus christ explains much. . Fuck single alone. 

I single live alone. made Bumble account going dates. take precautions, interested living like hermit. like any, moment... Yes worst pandemic history we're allowed feel sad. Yep.

Capitalism is. else supposed pay bills safety net? Really? still explained could prevented 200,000 deaths disease. Scientists working flu vaccine 70 years, still stopped people dying disease. makes think Trump could have? Please explain me, like said, I'm kind slow. wearing mask alone sufficient e ought protection? facesgield goggles worn too? much protection faceshield offer? time over, believe it’ll considered much worse Spanish Flu. seems unfair him. He’s giving thought best advice since beginning. responsible government, publicly disagreed. one federal bright spots. Interesting point view. Sorry rude previous post. One problems people lie symptoms potential exposure.  Making shut-ins Reddit everywhere warm fuzzy. That's alarm bad things happening, literally bad thing happening. That’s really accurate reporting though. remember info comorbidities came recently, people die covid. get pneumonia, blood clot leads stroke, etc. complications virus things likely kill you. heard news work, someone put live news tv watched stunned realizing dad flying US day broke (his flight got turned around mid flight, made much emotionally real). “When grown up”

Haha, GREAT. Mainly I’m going guess median age posters sub ... wait ... 18.8 believe reason actually coronavirus. Without that, may lived long, happy life weight. Lol f downvoting comment. 60k still hell lot people still alive right now. bizarre question get dude *literally* shrugged preventable deaths elderly

so relax pal, probably start worrying when? 45? 50?

I guess we're assuming parents, grandparents, older folks might care already dead? live Florida (until next month), lawyer offered us free wills campus. sent updated brother several weeks school started. district handling virus ""surgical"" manner. means hush hush quarantining infected students teachers, maybe others close contact longer fifteen minutes. close contact individuals wearing mask, safe matter. told ""lunch count"".

The fuck? science laws physics also take break lunch. see logic here. Crazy. mainstream Dems mainstream republicans agree: don’t want people truly fight back systemic anti-humanism capitalism. evidence working? Everytime there's new riot collapse see people blaming Trump pretty much uniformly, whether actually not. 

I mean, demonstrably ""America Trump administration"" matter happens. Lol, that’s whole point. can’t find any, don’t exist. anecdotes scientific peer reviewed studies. alternative? Homelessness? No, within last 60 years children still forced Christian boarding schools told could speak language, believe religion obey face discipline.

Thank proving point. fund vaccine. role development. OPV around decades. created Bill Gates ripe old age 6 years old use US 37 years 1963 2000. 

Sorry fell lies. mean pick lesser 2 evils every time? one thing might’ve noticed don’t complain about: Politicians. Everybody complains politicians. Everybody says suck. people think politicians come from? don’t fall sky. don’t pass membrane another reality. come American parents American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses American universities. they’re elected American citizens. best do, folks. offer. It’s system produces: Garbage in, garbage out! selfish, ignorant citizens, selfish, ignorant citizens, gonna get selfish, ignorant leaders. term limits ain’t gonna good; you’re going end brand new bunch selfish, ignorant Americans. maybe, maybe, maybe it’s politicians suck. Maybe something else sucks around here. Like… public. Yeah. public sucks! There’s nice campaign slogan somebody. ""The public sucks, fuck hope!”. Fuck hope. it’s really fault politicians bright people conscience? bright, honest, intelligent Americans ready step save Nation lead way? don’t people like country; everybody’s mall, scratching ass, picking nose, taking credit card fanny pack buying pair sneakers lights them! solved little political dilemma simple way: election day… stay home. don’t vote. Fuck'em, fuck'em! don’t vote. Two reasons, two reasons don’t vote: First all, meaningless. country bought sold paid long time ago. shit shuffle around every 4 years, *pfff* doesn’t mean fucking thing. secondly don’t vote believe vote, right complain. People like twist around, know. say: “Well, don’t vote, right complain”; where’s logic that? vote elect dishonest, incompetent people get office screw everything up… well, responsible done. caused problem; voted in; right complain. I, hand, vote, vote, fact even leave house election day, way responsible people done every right complain long want mess created nothing with. know little later year you’re going another really swell presidential elections like much, enjoy it’ll lot fun. I’m sure soon election country improve immediately. me, I’ll home day essentially thing you. difference is, get finished masturbating I’m gonna little something show folks.“ Hey cant second lockdown never really first one vaccine potential treatment... Maybe United States needs take look what's happening Australia right get understanding winter North America going look like. 

The Australian government proactive reducing spread hit first wave February / March. still got hit harder southern hemisphere winter. six months.  guys seriously lost script. Literally....?


And ""old"" (60+) people matter? Good thing never get old right? Getting old losers suckers. Y'know general representative ""We People"" ummmm Commander in...... Chief final say things...Fuck, REMEMBER!

 


AMERICAN! deaths one several weeks behind cases. time give up. seriousness blatantly obvious government care us things going get worse likely massive scale. certainly mean go party like stupid fucking college kids, somber, ""there's really hope left,"" feeling. Maybe. rebuild damaged lungs though? still dumb, lying American people could save families. say ""please refrain buying masks need hospitals etc."" There's excuse making lie like this. I’m surprised much disbelief people dining out.

People desperate resemblance normal life. guys honestly expect people sit ah home another 12 months already sitting home 6? 

We need change approach pandemic. Find ways aren’t risk, aren’t associated risk (i.e living elderly parents) see resemblance normal life, dining, protecting are.

Holy smokes, thinking outside box governing bodies would nice.


Edit : adding example 330 billion? hell getting number from???

(In case anyone sees now, original comment said 330 billion instead 7.5 billion)  immunity coronavirus different properties immunity Flu, completely different virus. Also, highlight H1N1? spread quickly, dropped map. worries, like grew up, student school every year election day. adult teacher now, find weird school off.  someone anti-mask, thinks COVID hoax please explain thought process here?

I hard time understanding logic. multiple health conditions? overweight, sure. say severely obese. Honestly never understood this. hell wearing face mask ever going make worse?

Not touching face, breathing everything anyways? It’s absurd Nothing even close tried Spanish flu certainly anywhere near length time guys proposing.  nice try.  

Lockdown measures worked make sure hospitals overrun.  Outside couple Queens, never were.  want move goal post lockdown zero cases.

We currently recession. Pence said shut whole economy back March.... one cared guy say decades everyone’s attention, doesn’t want give up. entire job depends people obsessing virus else 15 minutes fame would end. He’s going keep spreading doom-and-gloom narrative even whole thing ends. Viral load multiplied time spent indoors equals risk catching covid.

This better. correctly, lose. surrendered. view considered strategy election vs pandemic solely fits within bias; Democrats Republicans using biased argument repeatedly, driving insane. 

The general standpoint Republican individual inherently right decide whether want continue day day living accept risk comes along it. one wants quarantine themselves, able. 

General standpoint Democrats government responsible protecting people.

Both true, argument degree federal government take away individual liberties keep people safe? people become divided, reasonably so. don’t know mine blew up, certainly define blow equal TX, FL, etc. close, suspect gov mayor hadn’t taken actions course last 6 months, would have. Yet people still beating tyranny drum. First, really think would disappeared completely 2 weeks everyone followed guidance? literally happen anywhere world except couple island nations could control travel high degree. point lockdowns ""flatten curve"", eradicate virus. flattened curve, prevented hospitals overwhelmed. 

Second, quarantined along everyone else know month. don’t like dismisses glimmer hope get. It’s fine realist shut optimism. prefer honesty. figure people look hope little bit better demeanor. Like said, trust guy follow whatever directions gives. still in-n-out weed delivered!  want to, want to. nobody else fucking matters. end story info taken directly Reuters. What, thought country cases doubled less month wasn’t going implement new restrictions? mean tell best policy isnt designated peeing area pool? topic place stupidity. 

The morons must called villified: generally way work returned vacation Yellowstone Grand Teton National Parks. Less 10% park visitors wore masks public. least four occasions openly mocked wearing mask. Evidence points possibility will, even among ICU patients 100%. much information likely lasting lung damage Im aware of. We're literally large-scale measles outbreaks antivaxxers Federal guidance ""every state whatever want"", that's exactly what's going happen. consistent reliable messaging national/federal agencies, expect states consistent responses? national mandate state whatever wants sad reality Hilary time.  Ah, thought pumping gas. mistake Thats thing Science, new information comes shows benefit. thats doing. yesterday said today say YES mean scientific method cannot trusted. method working correctly. ... becomes available. saw went. congress useless Vancouver I've started seeing people beginning wear masks. I've wearing one every time gotta go since March. recently, either got mocked sneered wearing mask. American living Canada I've noticed strange number bored Canadians like listening right wing American propaganda. think lot ushered alarming number people downtown gathering making much noise residential areas possible. started getting infections provincial government worried. good see people starting take bit seriously. used around 10-15% people wearing mask, around 50-60% people see. ~~we~~ ***Trump*** disassembled pandemic response team, could better contained, maybe even prevented reaching US areas. anyone thinks getting better USA vaccine comes crazy. Americans always want quick fix pill. That’s view vaccine. means death destruction less work, that’s exactly do. fact, humans unless intense motivation authority government. Get used it. You’re going anywhere. try careful possible around 89 year old grandma basically told doesn’t care gets dies. She’s still getting hair done every weeks social life me. tried 🤷🏼‍♀️ Hey I'm Republican. shit really?! mean people coughing, chewing spewing saliva place contributing spread?! NOOO WAYYYYY

as virus knows ""eating outside"" people rather ""eating inside"" LOL country become movie Idiocracy. People vote unfortunately. ah, bad, everywhere i've lived schools polling sites classes cancelled monday tuesday. One guy area laid off, took +$600 saved it. Bought older corvette cheap.  also one worst deaths per population EU. look deaths vs every single one Nordic neighbors lock staggering difference. today's advanced economies, awful lot people actually anything useful (or indeed creating work others). come Spanish Flu exploded second time North America people thought over? think it’s incredible devote much time making side look worse.

The difference people hurting so, much, they're also understanding ramifications ""quit"". pain nothing, actions could well kill someone else.

Excellent. would add K-12 in-person school science experiment happening, might see increase community spread. watched day similarities eerie 1 million dead 7.5 billion nothing.

9 million people die hunger globally every year. I'm waiting world governments shut rectified. mostly agree, response point 3 hasn’t CDC put guidelines states open close response testing numbers week? august starts 11.9%, second week drops 9.5% (according John Hopkins)  Movie Parasite exactly this. data I've seen shows cases dropping past month anywhere close way Europe elsewhere. We're right track we're taking slowest way possible get there. let us any, asked. Coronaviruses existed cats way this. They’re wide spread group viruses, certain ones causing issues certain species. We've already seen enough. ""most progressive candidate history"" still staunchly M4A progressive policies. anyone comes along says ""go look website! He's progressive"", did. read it, mentions everything progressives care offers something address problem says he'll asking companies charge much. Like pretty please.

The way country every get rich getting richer poor getting poorer cycle depression break free Democrat vs Republican prison. Nothing ever change two parties. Even pandemic cannot escape turned us vs them, resulting everyone sitting around nothing, rich reap rewards pushing commoner scum back work. ""Was"" Yeah, I’m there. I’m thankful region hasn’t blown yet can’t imagine difficult business. Thinking staff! heavy unexpected announcement made Jean Castex.

I know make laugh, heard BFMTV Think way, deadly flu season, even large population social distancing wearing masks staying home. Imagine deaths spread weren’t.

Not mention we’re going time lot schools reopening help spread. flue season flu Covid worry about. surprise. Next thing know saying bars theaters safe.

Great word, though — comorbidity. Mask mandate close people, plowing field Lol, wholesale really selfishly hope people remember names. whenever apply jobs, credit, anything else life. [This excellent article issues preventing US getting covid control. right way things, solution tailored country's strengths attributes. China used authoritarian government control.

Can't rent car credit shit.
Can't fix credit job.
No one wears masks here.

Is death sentence?

How fuck take car? outside wearing masks keeping distance? I'm pretty sure extremely low risk.

I'm sorry one saying literally stay house, see one. propaganda. Anyone know anything 31 clusters? Eg age kids? classroom conditions? community rates time? Please spread this, spend money payroll maintenance costs keep 90% workforce board 6 months loan receipt pay back. Serious question, flying fuck happened ""flatten curve"" narrative? fucking scam point disgusting

What happened? Motherfuckers can't follow simple instructions happened. India also 20 times size France population. Silly comparison. Yeah plenty area credit unions live county. fee keep $5 savings account. downside experience credit unions (I've ever banked 20 years banking) tech lags little behind - like can't deposit check via app like partner bank america. EEEEY I’M WAAALKIN EEEEEEAH idea doubt friends family know either. people think children cannot pass virus.

Awesome. news presented article?  Make sure works first, yes Buncha negative Nancy’s sheesh People Florida dying Covid last year? checked hospitalization rates Florida? haven’t seen semi trailers used make shift morgues. 

None numbers I’ve seen shown health system overwhelmed like NY. 

And personally, I’d think bar Florida safer NY nursing home... 

I don’t understand would skew results “his favor” show less. financial incentive claim every death attributed Covid seems substantial. (Like guy killed Covid motorcycle wreck Florida). think would downplay forego $$$? say eating saying dining restaurant, takeout thing both? people break rules often unhealthy.

They're way higher risk fatality serious Covid damage.

Fuck people. Sorry, I'm part group easy for. avoid plague carriers. like lungs heart I'll continue working inside vaccines arrive. I'm patient.

Worked out... $138B left PPP pot August 8th, would hardly consider ""all"" money going millionaires. problem restaurants cant afford run is, add pandemic worsens odds survival. good. People stay inside winter.  OK replying another post probably even read lost translation. stop corona at? thanks seismically-isolated lead-shielded bunker Star Trek like replicators food generation, fresh water well source filtration, redundant filtered HVAC, visitors, access Internet keep sane. Really? Bc nurses treated guy it. obama acted like trump certainly would spread. far COVID, would spread regardless.  Damn, racism sarcasm make pretty disgusting combo. Translation: ""I know nothing economics except one joke."" none.

Sweden's policy creating herd immunity among healthy, sheltering vulnerable, seems like way go. leader federal level grab selfish governors throat make mandated precautions, nothing change numbers going up. Hahaha definitely one busiest places saw  Always CDC: Dining among riskiest activities Corona pandemic.

Rona DeathSentence: Hold beer! Well, main relief brothers. three us get along, especially since stopped following grandfather's example leader. change years pandemic, taking anarchist like approach means much tolerable rest family, even locked them. people pay kind too. guess I'll revise say I'm fine living likeminded people.

More authoritarian people like grandfather though? thanks. Old patriarchs get worse lockdown push people away. poor never eat rich. lower classes, historically peasant classes inherently revolutionary. They're interested one thing that's food table safety families.

Well they're going getting either. wtf going keep doing? Tour de France still couple hundred people close together traveling france. Even without spectators risky. 

The director tour diagnosed Covid...

I climbing climbing competition 5k people month ago. felt unreal watching home. fair dude 

Five guys half price

Give rona Would make easier mutations occur? Two different strains infecting 1 person making different one? virus go away. Cases went masks limiting businesses. areas comply hit hard still seeing increasing cases/deaths.

You're thinking immediate surroundings, acting like that's entire world.

You selfish. stupid. surely play role, time get little bit bad news Denmark well:  
""Corona maintains grip Denmark: number hospitalized rises"" 
from 15 beginning September 44 hospitalised, 7 ICU (which basically Sweden right per capita). 


There graph article hospitalisations. Well, yeah. amount deaths per day *right now* (not six months ago, number infections) high - especially given kinds deaths getting re-categorized Covid deaths even really aren't. 

No wonder people starting choose freedom safety. say thing. Literally every Monday, Tuesday Wednesday absolutely packed everywhere live near London Ebola issue difficult transmit one person another. valid comp. French people can't cope minor inconveniences save lives? France worse us terribly? Yeah no, bar flies descended restaurant bars closed. sucked. Thanks response. 

The multi-generational living might explain vis-a-vie Italy, seems like Germany middle pack compared Spain, US, UK, Sweden France, hit much harder. Sorry pay-walled cite:  30 cycles. 

I stopped replying bc don’t seem interested swaying opinion. One sentence saying it’s false negatives, next meant false positives. bc every hospital different, I’m sure won’t persuaded lab alone does. 

But good luck, best stay informed whatever way works you. I’m interested replying raised place like that. know would helped?

Yeah northeast beautiful there's huge class divide. lot major industries dried 30-50 years ago instead adapting, towns cities decided wait Next Great American Steel Mill Next Great American Grain Mill Next Great American Manufacturer whatever. There's little tech sector work outside major urban cores. Unless doctor, nurse, truck driver, civil servant, drug dealer, politician, there's much income -- let alone room advancement.

There exceptions, course, region generally pretty bad shape. Less demonstration, less social economic crisis. Christians believe creator power knowledge generate entire universe void, creator fucking fragile believe without evidence rando Jew actually divine son, send eternal damnation.

In words, Christians retarded. that's enough another vote generation?

That's vote every time there's blue moon. sure, body, health, choice. 

The planet *will* bite back though. Governor Deathsantis you? I’m starting feel like Tom Hanks You’re “sick” hearing it? Don’t worry, disappear... that’s true. proper lockdown, testing, tracing isolation, would contained virus. Places reopened soon plan. 

We don’t now. Replace shit tons most. top six states eight top ten death rate led Democratic governors.  

Trump terrible cannot convey clear message strategy, however seen far makes debatable mask mandates lockdowns actually stop spread coronavirus.  

I know sub hates comparison, someone explain full lockdown Peru highest death rate earth whereas lockdown Sweden fared much better seemingly way past virus? people read headline think ""great, problem here"". much flip-flopping topic children Coronavirus important reiterate current thinking.

Some people think children cannot pass virus. Greece needs money need COVID free tbh. economy already weak fragile, completely dead. Unemployment even higher 2008-9. Well people starting sort give up. went ""Stay indoors, save lives!"" ""This new normal, can't stop living"" past months since virus started. Honestly people feel like whatever since current efforts seem anything anyways. lived used require work schools places, student. open state residents. It’s house.gov website hey, obviously never intentions seeing past bias. ;)

Edit: another Reddit sources. Big surprise, it’s happening long virus began, you’ve got trumps baby dick far throat see anything bullshit. US, there's generally 0 cheek kissing, instead we've got anti-maskers, church-related super spreaders, bikers spreading virus across state lines catching Smashmouth concert.

Between Italians, Turks, Americans, think Americans fucked. Please refrain using electricity, principles something majority scientists agrees upon. go restaurant that's well ventilated, wear mask would safer still stop spread 100%. Also, make sure take mask (not sure would eat), talk anyone low volume (higher volume / conversations increase spread). going safe enjoyable. also argument schools opening online options available. ""Well kids need together"" say. together can't talk near other? terrible disease going around 100% safe way things. Meanwhile Congress taking 6 figure vacations. fuck? anyone say new President change things. need major overhaul. seems intuitive, friend couldn’t understand wouldn’t go restaurant. said distanced. said enclosed space. looked confusion bit annoyance. goes bars every night. French tell don't. However primary schools re-open think kids respectuous restrictions. also kind people find countries saying bullshit similar Trump...I think main reason number case rising right now... whole world decides wear masks everywhere outside houses like month, chances virus would've gone. Like Czechs Slovaks spring.

The people complain wear show utterly ""fryy pyco"" are, slower recovery Yea needs HS. Lets wait another year. God, miss good ol' tossing proverbial salad. New infections per 100k, last 14 days around 24-25/100k, similar level Norway, higher Finland, much lower Denmark 

Does anyone data show much due extreme amount testing Denmark doing? Failed. internet limit filter. Asthma go away zpack.

Sincerely someone asthma 30 years. That’s fair. Canada seems land somewhere two, people respecting h Th e rules, laws place ensure really important rules followed, key guidelines simply given recommendations, result, selfish people/idiots/whatever want call them/ reckless ignoring recommendations. I.e social distancing, going parties, etc.

Example: Quebec (a province Canada), bars open. Obviously, people don’t wear masks drink, bars designed pack people close together, loud music still blasting, causing people shout other’s faces, etc., there’s much regulation requiring stop kind behaviour. outbreak recently karaoke bar, because.. obviously 🤦🏽‍♀️ around 80 people’s illness traced back single evening super-spreading karaoke bar.  See New Zealand? Oh. do. 24 deaths. That's per capita equivalent around 1500 deaths US. How's US compared that? *Only* 100 times deaths? people can’t afford “hunker down”? still pay $1000 bills every month, government gave making new relief deal. no, see ""year vaccine ready"" love lockdown. born this. Good news eh? wonder many kids life long complications getting virus, unable fully enjoy different tastes smells again. Guess won’t hunkering Ebola issue bc Obama swiftly effectively dealt it. Clinton, Bush obama put policies place deal pandemics trump demolished soon office. may perfect, definitely 100% better shit show in. irrelevant negatives constantly need mentioned good news threads? know children pass virus, good news children appear less susceptible hospitalization virus. honesty, think blessing extended family holidays. much divisiveness bickering. Plus election taken place even bitterness regardless wins. 

I plan getting Katz's Deli shipped NYC(to CA) enjoying gorging delicious pastrami half sours. Binge watch shows, avoid drama. Also can’t really trust daily death rates. Florida currently filling backlog deaths vast majority reported deaths pretty far past. report 202 deaths yesterday could one person ten thousand - way public know way data released.

So say, example, X number people died covid Florida last month ignorant thing say KNOW many people died covid Florida last month.

Maybe fewer previous month? Maybe more? takes 100 days deaths certified covid won’t know December. girlfriend moved city (both separate leases up) sister sisters husband joined us. scared everything, literally withdrew $10k cash (don't ask thinking there). 7 months later, gone less dropped extra precautions, even visit guy's conservative parents think hoax two vacations pandemic. Nope, misread comment. bad. us largely introverts completely nonsensical many really hard around people. outside least seeing people around probably gives comfort. bad home life want home. Wow where’s countdown clock wanna know I’m inefficient. doubt it. Sure, groups likely get seriously ill, virus spreads immigrant communities, mostly chalked different family culture lower levels vitamin D. haven’t seen anything appears show genetics influences spread much all. It’s selfish want schools reopen people lose livelihoods reason. selfish demand sacrifices people reason based garbage.

Yes worst hit. months ago curve flat. months. People complied. didn’t overwhelming majority did. 

And we’re still reopening properly. It’s stupid anti scientific.

So piss “I’m alright jack stay closed” selfish bullshit. Credit unions great they’re always part network (the union part) states always partner branch drive person banking, like get bank check you’re buying used car.

Mine refunds fees ATM- fees ever (aside drawing) get 2% interest checking account meet certain terms month, insanely high interest rate.

I also get home car loans give great member rate. last car loan 1.99% want start deciding say what. Free speech whatever inconvenience may find Trump straight lied downplayed this.

Holy fucking shit. direct response you’re completely false claim. Nothing Lol also posted that...which 100% chunky bullshit

I posted link shows literal fact. You’re like talking wall. good life. Good faith request:

Can show us anything outlines difference practical terms? far understand it, reason R0 useful measure contagiousness 2.5 coronavirus infections spread much longer period time 1.3 flu infections (I remember coming across scientific term this, life can't remember was). can't answer, he's busy taking daily swig Trump's diarrhea. Says person gets privilege work home...

....probably... London 39k cases confirmed since outbreak, NYC 242k (with likely another 1.5-2 million infected caught). 8 million people living there. looking almost order magnitude difference least b/w cities. hit 20-25% infected start bottoming We're fucked agree. Mine two terrible experiences. Followed rules complicated frustrating. Still could hang out, shop, beer friends... like all.

I followed rules: separate bedrooms, separate bathrooms, windows opened much possible, person quarantine leave bedroom common spaces wearing mask, person allowed cook. smoking terrace minimum distance enforced time. Every fork knife glass whatever used quarantined person goes straight dishwasher risk contamination. Everything cannot consumed one shot (let's say big bag chips) marked none else eats accident. food stays ""quarantined"" room.
Garbage divided glass plastic anything else whole two weeks quarantine law requires.
The washing machine ""quarantined"" bathroom. prepared big bag/luggage like travelling hotel clothes there. Divided dirty clothes could wash quarantine over. opposite (the quarantined bathroom washing machine) quarantined person separate dirty clothes allowed clean quarantine. Plus person measure his/her temperature twice day: 8am 8pm.

The first time, lockdown, also used wear gloves touching anything quarantined person used eat drink taking garbage. second time careful touch face immediately would clean hands.

I probably paranoid theory rules quarantine italy (quarantine means tested covid infected person coming back countries). Definitely different sit watch tv.

PS thank you! Poland introduced ""smart"" strategy fall. get tested, need symptoms preferably, worst cases tested. Also shortened quarantine 10 days test end. 

Smart = reduce testing save money hide real numbers That’s bold assume electoral college fuckery. republican presidency outright popular vote electoral college since George H. W. Bush. rising virus awareness bode well money Inevitable disaster? already disaster long time. going even worse disaster. *Mexican music intensifies Nah, scum earth deserve it. Partying spreading families, families lost people, them. punishment small price pay unnecessarily killing individuals. Yep. good sign. Hospitalizations way state numbers. friends/family work hospitals confirmed well. They've taken entire covid units now.

I think Cali opportunity keep spread (by keeping super spreader events bars closed) slowly reopen things safely. need stern enforce.

I'm still amazed LA county got wave without hospitals exploding.

There's 10 million people here. Another brilliant example Tegnell manages incredibly wrong arrogant time.

First all, Tegnell FHM, even chief there.

Second all, consider answer wrong about? ahh old downvote reply. keep asking exactly want Cases trending since July. Deaths trending since end July way since initial surge April.

Lol also posted that...which 100% chunky bullshit perhaps understanding would mitigation. 

For instance, US, would multiple millions deaths, many sick hospitalized that, utterly destroyed economy. Fewer people going hungry without mitigation. 

Maybe problems understand nothing good would come lack mitigation. would gained nothing instead way bad things. Incorrect

The Spanish found causation latest study SF first wave yet. bigger outbreak SF would example 2nd wave ;-) Sure started china calling china virus still kind apt. like spanish flu. airports really want commercial passengers back there’s effective vaccine community spread US still uncontrolled, hand quality N95 masks surgical masks layer people enter boarding areas, insist worn passengers destinations. 

IMHO, one risk complications Covid (over 65; known co-morbidities, etc) flying. least, recreational/social reasons. 90% people forum. Taking measures extremes scared shadow. Driving alone mask lol. They’re screw*d vaccine can’t stay closet forever. plenty credit unions open general public. Mine, instance. They've even got Nowheresville days. You’re even conversation me. stated actual fact directly contradicted statement. Cases trending down. That’s quite literally it. go guess. better Good So, mask mandate lots medical capacity.  would waited see schools doing, sounds like reasonable. test positivity 3.5%, half month ago. lol Yup I’m saying he’s wrong...I’m saying he’s probably correct things doesn’t know honestly says “I don’t know...”

But judging polls responses I’m seeing here...his rounds starting opposite effect people tune bigger problems deal (making rent/jobs/their businesses/school). Certain governors: ""We're reopening everything..."" case count positivity rate still high.

Universities/schools/sports: ""Uh... guess we're reopening everything.""

Infection spreads rapidly.

""Damn kids!"" cares? standard living matters Yep make 7 dollars hour, kid failure Sick leave work workers protection, fire someone reason use sick leave entitled to. *insert Stalin quote* American's learn lessons, they're stubborn. We're doomed repeat history again. He's going win people gotten complacent ""no WAY win"".

Oh, yeah way win. strong loyal fanbase. like Obama. really ""fanbase"" Obama. people really liked him. Trump legit cult. cult, straight up. said, “early November” sentence, didn’t she? election one biggest days year, maybe moreso line work, makes sense use landmark. seems like meant point time, rather deciding date. something going happen early January, might say “after New Years”. comparable UK lol Weird took ""increased social distancing + mask usage"" turned ""locked die""... Losers lose you’re still poor compared truly wealthy, .01%.

lol cares Right. It’s like someone gets hit bus asthma, you’d prefer asthma listed cause death

Edit: also AIDS bone zero mortality rate make cause death AIDS patient dies pneumonia. doesn’t covid get treatment you? doctors seem consistent case coordinated shutdown would nice. course, can’t one thing expect work add good economic support people along programs mental physical health followed long term commitment tracing / supported isolation sounds great. 

Thing is, can’t even agree basic stimulus plan people work even get neighboring states line single rule metric likelihood anything comprehensive happening precisely zero. 

What really table. Thus need plan could actually do... clearly bouncing spike spike “covid fatigue” sets doesn’t work there’s room change, appetite go full distance. Sucks that’s reality.  need help roommate doesn’t seem taking Covid seriously NYS is.

We live NYC Covid pretty serious spring. really tough bunch reasons. time, shuttled back forth apartment boyfriend's, seemed little risky assured socially distancing. turned hanging eating different people.

Last week, went weeklong vacation SoCal hung SD LA friends family.

Since got back, hasn’t quarantining 14 days, rule thumb mandatory incoming travelers too. Yesterday, told ""maybe stay inside post-travel"" still going out.

Should confront making bigger issue is?

\[UPDATE\] told quarantine safe get fined. said give info airport reason.

\[UPDATE 2\] starting server job. bring putting community risk? point clean careful around her? chances British government able successfully hide big outbreak general public close zero. British press (even sections sympathetic current ruling party) absolutely ruthless towards politicians also anything order scare readers (fear sells newspapers). Yep. 100 people dying every day cases going low, they're testing enough. Maybe redditors lol odd Sweden top list

I mean really. People changed behavior. people working home, sick leave sick childcare leave increased like 100%+. visible anyone says life going normal lying.

There's also like moralistic fixation people enjoying bad stopping spread ignoring structural issues like working conditions access sick leave. know USA shit hole country 42 ""dying old age""-old. Check facts. instituted national lock down. States like arizona closed way early reopened states like NJ reopening. 

A national mandate even make sense country huge. And, convincing people stay home... go work... think time enough information want people hoarding n95's. read plenty stuff think 

is line describe Randians get six hour flight next week, wondering best prepare.

I use wear cloth masks have...but also 3M half face respirator mask ([this P100 filter cartridges would provide much tighter fit, filtered air.

The problem exhaust valve believe banned airlines. easy modification, put cloth valve use thin rubber bands keep place. question is...how badly frowned upon worth it? I'd rather extra protection vs cloth mask, especially longer flight literally detached reality. Show comment I’ve made that’s close Cases trending since July. Deaths trending since end July way since initial surge April. 

Lol. mention July August worst US. saying GOP stuff easily verifiable U.S. heads fall, likely uptick COVID-19 cases people tend congregate indoors more, said. ""I think need hunker get fall winter going easy.""

Lol article commenting on. almost look ahead get complacent? nah..I'm sure right everything going fine stellar last 7 months right? ya gonna break ol ""It's worse flu"" me? Lol Lol came say Yup. covid far contagious deadly  Nebraska higher per capita outbreak (\~140/M) California (\~90/M) week, places US average (\~107/M). R0 measure infectiousness contagiousness virus mostly point. would probably also add really R0 seasonal influenza virus. somewhat semantic point good remember apples oranges comparison.  Man got mans Fauci depressed come better. crazy. comparison city (Calgary, Canada, 1.4 million people) seen two covid deaths since beginning July. Less 1 per month ... 176 day nuts even factor population difference. new case rate likely representative real situation result deaths decrease much imply. People discouraged seeking testing. majority people tested either required sick need medical attention. low symptom cases accounted for. LA county San Joaquin Valley getting hit much harder rest state? people college students. adults. going start holding accountable actions?

Some say equating attempted murder exaggerative, know illness kills people. endanger other's lives crime, simply understand arresting people it. well then. Germany exactly sames things, near numbers. believe... mean listen updates well read updates worldwide time. blindly absorb information one source... thanks assuming think US bat shit insane topic blindly take everything government says.

edit: point hoax political scheme earth would Canada (or country) also daily government update despite need push politics? Maybe issue real politically charged world outside US initially posted something along lines slight disagreement understanding households able get together circumstances.

But reading clarification accounts household settings pubs/restaurants say clarity going paying attention restrictions although actually tried follow previous ones.   think see therapist Found Bobcat! Wrong. Firstly, EU countries mandating mask wearing, least indoors. Two, least Italy people care lot masks social distancing, least North. Three factors:

1. IFR coronavirus actually quite low, probably much lower earlier year due better treatments.
2. populations catching virus believed younger, whereas earlier outbreaks ravaging nursing homes.
3. There's delay catching virus dying it.

Also bear mind diagnosing tiny fraction cases back spring, generally severe cases resulted people go hospital. Antibody studies suggest real number infections Britain around 15-20 times higher number diagnosed infections. Even we're getting similar numbers confirmed cases now, real number infections couple dozen times lower March April. honestly don’t know, although prison meant say jail lock night two give fine, can’t afford it, get community service (with mask obviously) idea ICE honorable organization. wrong. spreading much misinformation?  obviously live sparsely populated area. large cities state? like there? yeah cuz know medical bills covid told people sub even though US citizen could travel EU due exception got downvoted called liar. started that, I'd move warmer climate. winter bad enough without adding additional isolation. 

We could protect elderly better paid attention. went nursing home couple years ago. barrier entry. 

I suspect influenza strains asymptomatic carriers, least that's primary spreading mechanism. could protect elderly staying fuck home we're sick. We've known flu kills old people hundred years, screen people visit nursing homes? guess maybe lack epidemilogical knowledge could come play think care enough bother. simple, nobody wants locked die, encourage visitation empathy. surprises controls. let coughing people look like shit go NICU, ok go nursing home? Well damn, makes lot sense. know try poop work. nice paid take shit. compar8ng sweden france idk brought denmark norway amd finland however seen far makes debatable mask mandates... Lol actually think people put restrictions another year. We’ve barely able deal now. still support restaurants frequently getting takeout. Whatever happened flatten curve? Hospitals overrun US - fact, according covid tracking project, hospitalizations almost 50% late July peak. Sure, would take long virtually covid cases country - places largely back normal, Sweden fully normal except ban large gatherings, southern states seeing hospital numbers drop well - quickly they'd like, clearly side curve almost businesses open, including in-person school sports. mention growing evidence immunity long-lasting almost cases due memory cells - 100%, pretty damn close - herd immunity thresholds may even lower expected due heterogenity exposure coronaviruses past. Plus, vaccine given high risk groups would bring covid far pandemic situation, 80% deaths occurring 65+ individuals 94% deaths comorbidities. think asking people keep living fear friends family another entire year reasonable given mortality rate virus healthy people. link study? I've seen another fairly convincing (ill try find again) No, read comment referenced death rate. amount tests per positive case.

We greatly underestimated number initial positive cases (We probably still are). goal still flatten curve. means maintaining Rt ~1.

That always meant adopting enough policies reduce rate spread, included closing businesses.

Winter means higher R0, current measures aren’t going work. nothing hand prepare, another shutdown might required stop massive outbreaks again. Yep, use Tabletop Simulator - I've certainly really enjoyed it. I’m confused. consider rich? I’m working home, invest stock market, etc. wouldn’t call rich. fuck saying? Unemployment US average like $150 day 6 months. Fed printed money last 6 months ever printed history. realize one works, there’s stuff, right? people build fix houses don’t work, there’s houses live in. people make transport food don’t work, there’s food shelves go spend free money. Everyone Reddit preconceived notion one ever work get bunch free shit, guess appear thin air? going post something today, I'm afraid it'll stir much shit.

Which insane considering still holding remembrance services something happened nearly two decades ago ignoring something killing many people right now. Yeah Australia great place live right now. police come arrest anyone even thinking protest. I’m sure BLM wouldn’t. *The pandemic isn’t you’re it...* thing is, virus unknown, nobody even sure related weather changes patterns all. “But go Pret bro” Friend u/Santorno, cancelled It’s true though. Georgia handled well means. first state reopen, led huge spike cases, hospitalizations, deaths. states, Georgia probably last one should’ve reopened schools. Meanwhile I'm training guy ""recovered"" virus stuff lab ""until he's gets well enough go back strenuous job"" person sarcastic, poking fun entire subreddit’s obsession “two weeks” generation?

What legal document defines that's enough another vote 

What? party getting elected manifesto promising hold one? want? Wait what? testing wasn’t good, people dying? don’t get Oh, I've owned game year so, finally excuse friends needed finally play me. We've lot fun, still miss in-person games bit! Repeat me: Masks (and even vaccines!) 100%. could worn time, would need social distancing. They're meant shift odds favor can't avoid people. 


That still makes critically important. Here's latest case/death charts Kentucky, running 7-day see, deaths indeed trended up. Overall however state better shape most. They're currently 23.72 deaths per 100k population, well US per capita average 57.44. 

That ranks 35th US ?

Did start preaching false efficacy hydroxychloroquine treat covid daddy bone spurs said so? claimed injecting bleach useful grandma ‘grab-her-by-the-p*ssy’ tweeted it? 

I’m confused, “brainwashed” listening medical professionals “brainwashed” won’t fall every little thing senile god preaches? definitely seem bigger softer also.
I remember much 'hard chewy' candy kid.

The little Halloween minis firmer. Doesn’t make sense all. could test zero people you’d still see hospitalizations deaths. answer virus (gasp) deadly it’s kept nursing homes. beauty free will... US? work. We've let spread far. 

Right attempting sustained leveling. Let's try resume preventing getting control. necessary, lock 3 weeks, drop cases 90%, rinse repeat. 

But if? locked airports sooner? locked country time cities? We'd looking different world right now. Speak quietly wearing mask... conversations go like : Hey Joe
-What?
HEy Joe
-What? 
FUCK THIS
-Yeah, fuck it
What?
-YEAh FUCk It
What?
-NEVERMIND consistently I'm hearing.

 like totally different country. John MacArthur self-serving jackass. going defy order Sunday play martyr smaller churches practically worship him. That's true. involve fast food? guys dicks one another reason. Dude said didn’t like people tried friends people work misinterpreted said OP human interactions (he fairly rude tbf), y’all jumping throats it. Sadly virus become political reactions longer based science. 200,000 people dead, 1,000 every day.

200,000 _Americans._ Come on, Yanks - rest world exists, we're majority 95%! yea swedes travelled lot. part reason huge outbreak begin with. Especially considering vacation earlier neighbors spring

Swedens sports holiday starts differently depending region live in, many Swedes, sports holiday holiday spend abroad.

Gothenburg (west coast) holiday week 7, took long time started getting cases. 


Malmö (southern part) week 8, they've less cases deaths compared Denmark last time checked roughly thesame population density, go abroad fly Copenhagen. 
This also week Denmark Norway holiady.

Stockholm holiday week 9. also started getting reports big outbreak Italy, epicenter spread Sweden.

Week 10-11 northern Sweden holiday. spread quite small, cheap go abroad since pay extra flight Stockholm first, less international travel assume, live quite spread out. I’m looking excess death model. Except Bernie Sanders. He’s fighting born. 

Oh yeah?

How's going ya? Mark Zuckerberg directly responsible damaging country citizen's. must association I'm confused Covid whole. #Summary

**What already known topic?**

Community close contact exposures contribute spread COVID-19.

**What added report?**

Findings case-control investigation symptomatic outpatients 11 U.S. health care facilities found close contact persons known COVID-19 going locations offer on-site eating drinking options associated COVID-19 positivity. Adults positive SARS-CoV-2 test results approximately twice likely reported dining restaurant negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.

**What implications public health practice?**

Eating drinking on-site locations offer options might important risk factors associated SARS-CoV-2 infection. Efforts reduce possible exposures mask use social distancing difficult maintain, eating drinking, considered protect customers, employees, communities. Ventilation systems general thing Germany except modern commercial real estate. windows doors way air gets out. can’t believe many people post pictures socializing FB. “Had great time celebrating grandpa’s birthday whole family!” think I’m gonna click “like” something? least 2020 year don’t feel FOMO. Rowan county currently per capita death rate 57.39. That's almost exactly US national rate 57.44. 

Here's latest case/death charts, running 7-day deaths spiking cases going down. I'm sure many reasons, creative expression mocking clickbait-esque headlines among them. first wave countries experiencing second wave. seasonality flu. right beginning. flatten curve unless get real vaccine. According Wikipedia, France visited tourist country planet makes sense stupid boomer co-workers... learned fake numbers fool suckers. makes ton sense. seems like circulating US ton anyone knew here, made locking near useless -- least lot less useful.

Thanks! Lol there’s always comment good news dark cloud crap. comment do, muad'dib? guess youre right, even homeless people income managing effectively social distance exuse us have? right thing others. I've one person tell election over. really can't make kind stupid up. scary without context. I’ve grown accustomed seeing 100-250 cases every day. Even finding due increased testing still kind scary see larger number vaccuum. Basically universal mask mandates high levels compliance. There's extra subtleties think. NYC family Florida wants come visit, probably bad idea. grandma lives nursing home going back vising you, also probably bad idea. seeing sister who's following rules lives next town over? nearly bad. couldn’t believe 16,000 people showed up. bunch stupid motherfuckers. It’s bad trick-or-treating. It’s outside activity masks already norm. But, there’s way would trust Americans smart it. God, covid would much easier without idiots. Bars st pete Yeah US boasting best medical care world would easter. 

On top economy California big South America entirely...

It always possible find someone worse compare to. 

But comparing best learn them?
For example Vietnam? Plus people eating together feel like talk laugh animated fashion. True. I'm saying *should* happen, far usual cramped crazed masses follow tour around France, often camping spot along road days races aproaches them.

And honestly, blame people participate events, especially non-professionals (because professional sportsmen bound events contract, trapped) middle classes always use *rhetoric* refers “the people” “the lower classes” talk lot poor despite really knowing much lives much help glorious revolution succeeded. 

So it’s confusing. Comfortable middle class even upper middle class young people disposable time income calling needs “the starving masses.” sub says everything United States wrong European countries experiencing things are. openly say anti mask brag wear masks often places. Youre fighting socialized health INSURANCE, healthcare. fighting make absurdly rich even rich. fighting give super powers big pharma insurance zealots US can’t even qualify cos haven’t even stopped hit badly.

It also might something report deaths. Basically death anyone, also tests positive virus, classified Covid death.

""Essentially, Dr. Ezike explained anyone passes away testing positive virus included category. ""

&amp;#x200B;

So, could asymptomatic, get shot death robbing bank, cause death ""covid related"" woulda thought caused letting boat dock 10,764 Americans board. little fuckers

lol irony largest intensive care capacity per capita EU , would imagine It’s everyone 65. case fatality rate highest 80+ 15-20% falls rapidly age 2-3% people 60s.

Not saying that’s acceptable trade, it’s like “everyone 65 playing Russian roulette” “everyone 65 doomed”. lol. echelons stay gone work. Medical workers, utilities (electricity,water, cell phones, assume want internet 2 week quarantine), police, fire, people work production would probably work somepoint quarantine ended would end empty grocery stores, pharmacies, public transportation workers still go work, libraries stations,at least mechanicswoke open, yeah pickup cooks reduced probably eliminated 2weeks, plumbers would work repairs, electriciansand general contractors ( broken pipe furnace leaky roof less setups quarantine), alcoholics still need get alcohol, laundromats would needed everyone washing machines gimme 2 weeks long time go without washing clothes, Manny others. understand intention thigh electricity lights come from? dangerous fast food? time limits also reduce spread. Something present bar. I'll one better. guests hotel tested positive. called DOH number basically told unless symptoms, need tested. Yay. Shes 4 school wise really falling behind. learning ride bike without training wheels access private pool swimming gotten much better. waiting get vaccine, missing normal life like rest us. sister law corrections officer Florida. Multiple inmates died, blue face, started even testing covid. it, tried week get tested finally gave test work. 3 days later came back poaitive told stay home 2 days come back work. incredibly hard time get tested Japan. know guy denied two testing centers hospitals Tokyo get tested. literally told call back. incredibly difficult get tested Japan Zombies Mecanical ventilation heat recycling winter guess. Much like sweden. 

AC non excisting. Egypt 100k cases... False, ONS estimates based modelling test results likely actual infections. America bad DAK many participants Oxford vaccine far? Wonder incidence two people falling ill within normal parameters whether uncommon. Here's latest case/death charts Florida, running charts least, things indeed improving. 

Florida currently 57.02 deaths per 100k population, ranks 16th country per capita Positivity rate yesterday 10% 70 deaths. Although slightly better month ago, would still say it’s controlled. Testing dropped recently state, I’d little worried living there. Kinky Please tell racist pointing Indian tribes shouldn’t model governance use. 

This people don’t take real racism seriously. call anyone disagrees even points verifiable facts names. comment made realize 2020 almost 3/4 over. Fuck.  You’d think people would sold freed cash buy dip. Given stock market hasn’t crashed (again) guess people aren’t panicking yet. soon bars closed, restaurants area closing doors bc 75% employees caught it. restaurant close 2 locations reason. time limit tables camping making less customers overall refuse wear masks table, yell/laugh loudly spreading germs everywhere 4 different households meet there. findings arent peer reviewed, findings based heart cells petri dish, looked hearts actual patients heart cells werent cut up, rearranged (not sure means).

Read article panicking. Exactly, uneducated kids like tiresome. That's hard pass me. Yes is! 65/35 stayed EU one would calling second referendum! fact close first time round one main reasons rejecting independence based fact would better part uk EU (Scotland would apply join eu independent country, led believe) would say major reason allow second referendum. honestly don’t think possible. Even Biden wins, refusing social distance would another way Trump voters resist. mention republicans senate continue refuse pass economic support make feasible. leopards gonna do? Stab me? Interesting map. level expected correlate ""blue banana"" though hate term.

I know corrected population able spread quicker along densely populated axis whatever. perhaps already moving on. Please, crapping best news ever reality nonsense. /s pale northerner full vitamin summer... Losing livelihood isn’t minor inconvenience. America we’re slaves betterment country! people evil, selfish fucks; they’re damn proud it. Born trolls they’ll go kicking trolls. definitely American slogan. Fucking idiots. got reaction. asked wear masks. vote! going easy
 

well then, we're going it.  pretty clear even easy, lot people it, cause would require tiny bit caring someone yourself. done back May, unfortunately think people skeptical vaccines. Airlines safe bet too. Buy they're low wait inevitable bailout.  Lol @telling renters insulate walls. Maybe Atlantic go search website reflect publishing back February this.

So help god..... Yeah think fine considering fact higher chance dying touching poison ivy catching Covid. Use ya damn head. Case solved 7 months we've this

At what? Nowhere US meaningful lockdown, international standards, one single day. Shows devastating complete vacuum leadership be. US culture trying skate bare minimum going continue provide compounding consequences next decade. therapy?

Yes, quite helpful frankly everyone, regardless healthy think might moment, would probably benefit it. That's say shitty therapists - - that's get second opinion current one working serious mental also laughable assume everyone access therapy afford it.

You're moving goalposts. attacking assertion mental damage permanent. saying permanent might able afford it. That's another conversation Edgy comment year. evolve cunt time designed way parents?

Looks like hit Statistically reddit, age bracket somewhere ballpark 0.1% chance dying contract it. downplay anything, Jesus man

There plenty old people Reddit. also plenty POC women reddit. non-STEM majors. 51% represents majority mean thing 90%. 

You really ought avoid whipping statistics can't grasp goal never prevent every single person dying. stretch highly evolved brain back March, supposed isolate long enough flatten curve.

Indeed, large portions population decided disregard entirely go party Easter, Memorial Day, Labor Day, every excuse could think of, thus ruining chance getting control.

Now they've prancing around spreading fire months, proposing pouring gasoline yourself. started going eat recently, two restaurants town we're going to. outdoor seating spaced 20' apart, regular server-style table waiting. One counter service, one order online deliver table. That's Sanders, Warren, Democrats proposing tax wealth. goes people exploited others get massive amounts wealth. 

**Remember ""side"" on. issues. That's politics really about.** that. Economics much complicated that. McDonalds try increase prices, Burger King people can't afford McDonalds go Burger King instead. Capitalism good thing too. helps increase competition innovation. since 1950's, morphed piece-by-piece serve richest few. 

The easiest example Comcast internet. They've lobbied supported politicians help curb attempt others compete monopoly markets. Even Google said extremely difficult markets ISPs influence politics. gotta stop happening - period. I’ve tried hard can’t take much longer. lockdown buy us time. flatten curve, right? Well locked down. lost jobs. endured.

And leadership time sacrificed buy? Fuck all. live testing still mess hospitals aren’t ready surge. So... can’t much longer. people already do, variation calling 'Trumpvirus'. There's even subreddit name r/Trumpvirus which, unfortunately consists nothing memes, therefore like much internet 100% fact free. mean even outside church services they'll go infect everyone else, intentionally not. they're still hotbed virus, possible mutations infectious deadly strains.

As Korea learned, truly beat virus must ""safe space"" inside country. No. death rate makes pandemic. speak truth, say thank you. 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 understand urge eat restaurant. get take-out run home. Really? Going herd immunity, survival fittest, see. going future career he's dead debilitated disease. Use ya damn head. Yup working home boss wanting protect employees. ever chastise situation. Stay safe need pay bills put food table. Reading comments, smell getting ""pwn normies"" Huh. We've already 2 cases flu urgent care (W Pasco). expect muted year...hopefully. Hopefully. perhaps also worth look graph article. 

Remember lockdowns introduced around 12th March.
The average time infection death (what find) 18.5 days.

Now think: 

* portion (far many) elderly perished - lockdown would matter - already infected?

* Compare Swedish number deaths lockdown + 18.5 days nordic countries. fair say apperently reason looks like quite much higher death count Sweden rest nordic countries time? make argument searching reason also remaining part deaths (those occurred lockdown +18.5 days) factors lockdown rather strong? post removed because:

This post may appropriate Daily Discussion thread, stickied front page.


*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* even read comment replied to? clarify here, got tons cherry tomatoes 5gal buckets ground. get many 1gal container.

It experiment, really call mistake. think tomatoes need far one gallon produce properly. think see results schools opening. yet.

What seeing infections spread due summer holidays. country that? Living New Zealand here, flu season starting locked COVID first wave peak. Cold flu like symptoms hella compared previous years. actually expand testing criteria without symptoms people getting sick, period. Outdoors - tent roof only, sides open. 12 tables total. study. number economists pulled asses without corroboration epidemiologists.  economists constantly way company earnings got notice that. knew Wells Fargo even read end post. Time start looking too.  town using fires ash excuse open indoor seating restaurants 😫 take-out closing bit.  shake hands picked bum Fans attending games won’t effect players getting covid.. never concern. Oh? says easy transmit originally thought? could direct exact link pointing death rate less half percent?


^^^^^^^^I ^^^^^^^^call ^^^^^^^^complete ^^^^^^^^bullshit Funny dangerous activities involve socialising work, maybe virus knows tax paid attacks activities  Probably, unless show comments don’t know think going answer question you. I’m sure every one moment weren’t careful could got unlucky. Thank you. School important every child. son going school M-F I’m happy take him. learning gets preparation future career. Max boost. choices. won’t get Trump done. don’t fully close businesses hospitals aren’t overwhelmed. It’s ridiculous states nothing LA CA also ridiculous. I’m glad governor cares economy too. federal government isn’t going provide anymore help clearly. businesses need stay open need best wait vaccine. ChADoX1 developed MERS, also coronavirus, 2012. went safety trials MERS disappeared. repurposed SARS2, also coronavirus, moved fast. antigen changed, much like annually flu vaccine, manufacturing process remains same. 

None vaccines rushed. Given severity virus obvious need one, FDA designated team who’s job review research it’s submitted. corners cut, simply making capacity immediate review. vaccines trials also conducted tandem, 1/2 2/3, also lowers timeframe. Yes middle class actually something lose gain, poor stuck Yes, almost certainly contaminated test false positive.

Given contagious virus is, anyone really believe could existed Spain almost year without anyone noticing? virus like would created lot excess deaths course months, would impossible hide country strong protections free speech free press.

IIRC, genetic information virus also originating late 2019, probably China. know board bothers every district county basically says listen county state health agency open county lowered safer tier. anti vaccine posts regarding russian vaccine, sure. People willing dine unmasked restaurant probably also likely follow precautions anywhere else get away it. comment led find great article called “Flourine: Element Hell” numbers now? wont missed glad wait tables socal capable outdoor dining year thing even exist? guess therapy's right out.

I take introvert? therapy? serious mental illness? idea little therapy fixing everything laughable. also laughable assume everyone access therapy afford *designed* all, evolved.

Edgy comment year. evolve cunt time designed way parents? feel need ""correct"" (common english phrase) here? make feel yes, we're social animals, better social animal needs little time readjust disaster dead social animal.

Statistically reddit, age bracket somewhere ballpark 0.1% chance dying contract it. downplay anything, Jesus man. goal never prevent every single person dying. stretch highly evolved brain back March, supposed isolate long enough flatten curve. believe girls- they're trying lull anal. like always. people spending time public means businesses lay people close. yeah might mean can’t work.

Yes, might mean that.

Yes, people going get screwed result businesses losing traffic.

There's much anyone that, though.

This happens take pandemic seriously: status quo remains bad goes bad worse.

Some people totally fucked. going fun. choice.

_My_ point that's _Fauci saying_ directly. problem people say around hopping would get better. plan. Meanwhile I'm sitting top pantry filled overflowing hundreds pounds crops almost ready harvest. 'screenings' complete joke. flew back Canada via USA back Feb. got flagged Hong Kong USA customs. got sent side room packed us like sardines, got asked 3 questions CDC ""Every Wuhan? Sick recently? Contact someone sick?"" asked HK suppose category told no, late cause took passport in. waited 3 hours called custom redo customs. waiting, everyone right next other, literally 1/2 feet apart. Customs shouting people come finish like street market auction. honestly felt like going covid there. every place allows dining bars people bitching bars open reality dining rooms closed f*cking plebeian sheep Americans are

I'll take ""Stupid shit Americans say."" 200, Alex. yes cloth ones hang up.

but overall yes. older house use that. really keep cooler. gets cold areas, even US. customers willing make lost revenue. need something along lines COVID business loans again, rigidly enforced. Free exercise clause typing... stop acting like everyone going die? part problem. Enough fear mongering. Fuck, call parents again.

This shit reminding there's really never enough telling people love them. We’re fucked. need huge garden outdoors actually live veggies-- like hundreds square feet per person.

Good thing suggesting people source food. Work reading comprehension (and gardening, output pathetic.) 49 330,000,000 Americans.

go figure. we're already seeing 1K deaths per day India - already gone haywire, we've collectively become normalized virus fatalities.

In comparison, remember 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks? 4 day period, 174 died, tremendous tragedy huge deal India. likely culprit stuck end article little description reasoning go it? Certainly, can’t surprise opening schools could cause increase cases. cares - it’s kids &amp; teachers. 😞🤬  also depends 10... ophthalmologist first introduction disease examining patient it. possibly caught it. Maybe family members friends know departed’s “mask disposition” doctors &amp; nurses could know, asked question. agree. slow drip story seems be, think begging going see waited. I've told I'm optimist fault. wonder traded stock Well fucking said. plan flatten curve, create effective test trace contact system wouldn’t social distancing/masks/restrictions. fuck done Yeah I'm pretty sure commenter crap gardener. output low they're sorts things wrong. kind people went Sturgis middle beyond reason. would likely cooperated kind testing effort. Sounds like brain smooth marble. still infectious dealing complications? alternative what, lockdown 6 months?

EDIT: INSTEAD DOWNVOTING LIKE BUNCH PEOPLE NOTHING BETTER SAY, PLEASE TELL WRONG look countries got things control enough return normal actually respond new infections contact tracing - sit home like schmoe that. literally suffocate someone young. I'd sue. see much restaurants indoor spaces sanitizing often cleaning time.

The cleaning theater make feel better patronizing business.  Start indoor vegetable garden, get walls insulated, buy 25 lb dry beans, $60 space heater bedroom, go money rationing while. could get ugly here.

People hate give actual solution, I'm trying make point bootstraps anything, trying help survive. I've also got list really low cost cooking recipes anybody needs reach out.

*My crown jewel $0.93 chili. pissed leadership president governor city leaders non-existent. mask mandate April, efficient testing, contact tracing would made huge impact instead squandered time killed many people. done everything right try keep customers staff safe going business. right business owners decide whether stay afloat risk illness death customers, staff, lose livelihoods. 

Everyone pissed this. 

We're going suffer much long run looks political ploy prop things election.  need fundie keep birth rate high. works home, about? think able relate peoples experience. men,but women children too! Odd phrase helpful. Thanks know many, know, share us. pay get plane. many tests? That’s really matters. % at? mean Florida likes death rates pandemics, right? else keep modeling shitty public health policy. Inteligence skin deep, Stupid goes way bone. good suggestion social creatures need thrive. Religious not, sure helps know humans going shit are.

Lots religious groups hosting online meet-ups social stuff.

If spiritual religious, atheist search community, progressive, looking Unitarian Universalist churches. non-credal (meaning follow particular dogma faith), filled humanists, atheists, Buddhists, pagans, Christians, nice folks sharing vision better world. head office basically said person stuff least December

United Church Christ super progressive Christianity friends UUs above. Lovely folks zoom meetings.

Meet Up.Com another way connect. Reach old friends Zoom cocktail hour movie.

I also used know Episcopalian church Pub Hymn Sings drink beer sing. see online 🍻 We’re human beings. We’re supposed look fellow citizens. 

And driver exactly that. 

Making sure one person exposed hundreds hundreds potentially exposing others. know ""my job prospects"". Eatting outside pretty darn safe. catch dead eatting inside. ...but, *the economy* Lol. Ok. 

PSA: young impressionable person reading this, no, obese make bad person. makes person medical condition. Unfortunately shortcomings visible people around makes insecure feel powerful insult essence being. obese would best interest, would like live full life get help need change lifestyle. otherwise ones business. Ok? Ok. Thx. Never said either.

What, can’t vent feelings? hell want do?

Vent wall? Pillow? Last time checked, can’t communicate. telling people ""hunker down"" doesnt work obviously. Even forcing people hunker down, like PA did, didnt kill virus. Look, I’m worried medical education doctor. fuckers can't one thing right sickest I've ever without throwing up.

That means drink enough buddy. cut back 'medcine' *wink*.  affected lockdowns.

“Muh beer pong muh college experience!” buy whole ""only N95s work, fit tested, healthcare workers know do"". Obviously masks ""work"" virus protection, encouraged wear them. Which, given assumption among people health experts recommendations primarily protect us, scares shit me.

I'm sure BETTER preventing transmission, whole idea one-way protection told everyone ""aren't enough"" created environment panic. ICU There!  feel like better drivers expose themselves. 

Then 1 person exposes 100 don't. 

Yes one person exposes way still one person et infected exposed. people f****** head. Covid p**** ass s*** I've ever f****** scene.
F*** masks know that's way important expertise XSPA imagine high school thinking school closing punishment. Look across Europe then.

Germany averaging 1000 cases month yet 3 deaths per day right now. 0.3% CFR.

It seems like sub wants really hard ignore extremely low CFR. Fresh air helps, whole lot area mostly sheltered wind day little wind begin with.

Yes, less likely catch outdoors. No, mean standing sitting 6 feet away someone outdoors provide complete protection.

Based I've seen restaurants area, outdoor seating areas completely fucking packed. tables may 5-6 feet apart, matter much sitting downwind 100+ people start coughing/sneezing/yelling/singing/etc, sitting stagnant air wind-protected area full people constantly talking/yelling/sneezing/coughing/etc. shit. control bullshit. virus going spread. sucks, dangerous, life. oh right, forgot point view, old people dying count paycheck? Fool says basic stock options vesting one recombinant influenza vector vaccine. came idea adenovirus vector vaccines except different vector.

I heard originally vaccine going administered via jet injector, guess plan changed. stupidity there's nothing back end relief business owners workers. Mcconnell pass anything actually helps people.

So ""Don't worry it"" beginning, followed ""It is"" end. getting RNC invitation? good god, evil.

How hell live yourself? ‘None seem understand. I'm locked you. locked ME!” Yeah, without doubt best solution would fix it, I'd rather em get rid entirely like well checked temp wrong see tried hard. many viruses cause colds. Coronavirus one form. mean group people lowest risk, affected lockdowns. speak ""the rest us"" Well I’m society isn’t much option. Even don’t work traditionally would work quite hard survive. Long term success rates vary across different solid organs (kidney, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, small bowel, etc). major factor influences outcome degree immunosuppression needed transplant. various organs, lung small bowel require immunosuppression, since inherently contain lot lymphoid tissue donor. happens organs 24/7 contact outside world (lung breathing environment, small bowel seeing whatever eat, mention inherent microbiome organs). essentially balancing significant immunosuppression face constant contact microorganisms. comes surprise infections extremely common. 

Source: Infectious disease doctor, experience transplant ID Sure, test rest world it’s shit together, anyone loonie enough fly US right going catch days later they’re careful anyway. January People literally starving death due lockdowns don’t expendable lives massive medical infrastructures. idea what’s going African continent need compared continents. idea many African lives could saved West didn’t buy Remdesivir? idea many African lives lost Malaria since west decided hoard HCQ cure covid? Imagine touch  even talking about? course Li Wenliang could known another virus. looked like SARS (which even deadlier COVID19), Li Wenliang sounded alarm made reasonable (if ultimately, incorrect) guess.

Where falsehood? propaganda? requires leaving house supermarket know means! care human life guess individual stories always sad, big picture restaurant must strictly CLOSED exponential pandemic... Nobody forcing anybody go back work. work well enough Nothing pass, theyre fudging numbers push 8% unemployment narrative. teacher wasn’t even regular school sessions started. Second wave starts Europe (we US never left first wave) evil bastard Strategies hunkering down: 

-Masks
-Eye protection
-Minimize shopping time
-curbside pickup online shopping
-no parties/bars/restaurants 
-within family bathroom schedule UV light between
-handwashing 

Strategies boosting immune system 

-Sleep
-fruits veggies
-no alcohol
-lots sun 
-less sugar
-less soda
-exercise two times week 

Let's focus do. Live survive shit. $35 Miami plane tickets right now. can't get sick sitting front plate food. Germans don’t hug kiss often.  leader scientist. Whilst get saying, can't work cfr comparing deaths number cases day like America first lockdown strict enough, what? I've always thought Israel sort success story, achieving much America terms containment compliance. went wrong, anyway? ""complete safety"" possible planet earth? Nooooooooooo! Yep. Sturgis riders spread everywhere. Congratulations making history super-spreader event. Quick question fuck  make 24 without catching COVID-19, giving immunocompromised mother, fucking miracle.... recently FDA approved. U system able test students faculty public trying expand places That's right, continue rise coming weeks cases confirmed recently progress point mortality. deaths we're seeing cases confirmed several weeks ago. anyway, average ~75 deaths per day country size Spain *bad* - March peak absurdly terrible.  article talking two vaccine candidates China National Biotec Group Co one Sinopharm, three vaccine candidates inactivated virus vaccine.

CanSino's Ad5-nCoV leading candidate one stage, since taken three. Ad5-nCoV enter phase 3 testing Russia three inactived virus vaccines phase 3 testing well day. People United States traveling lot December due many Xmas/New Years time off. Makes total sense Covid then, could even started rather China. also makes total sense would cluster cases December &amp; early January everyone getting together Xmas/New Years spreading other. Many doctors would assumed bad flu season. obviously horrible testing capability like April we'll probably never truly know, culturally another get together time Xmas/New Years spring time US. probably one reasons Trump finally acted realization would another uptick travel spring break starting creating major super spreading event. Thanksgiving/Xmas 2020 going crazy. well no, reality US fascism start trump, decades bit bit picking away freedoms, patriot act TSA, ICE DHA DHS, endless funding authoritarian police mob military bases world, authoritarian apparatus would made Hitler hard pants Hopefully it'll Oxford gets done they're road me. Lmao, DeSantis fucking idiot sub, also known sub, hoagie, hero, grinder, type sandwich made cylindrical bread roll split lengthwise filled meats, cheeses, vegetables, condiments  Bars open. sitdown outside Would rather stabbed ten times? difference make stabbed, right? 

Recovery outcome worsened exposure heavy viral loads. put bunch people shedding virus house together everyone gets virus attacking systems, increases severity assault immune system probably increases risk cytokine storm. Oh, know. concerned school daycare instead school education... get it, sure won’t dining out. Uh... Wrong thread? Nothing new China. suppose wear one walking street clear sunny day ? draw line it’s driving nuts seeing people wonder around empty areas masked ...

It’s bloody fashion statement now

I play golf twice week keep seeing people masked wide open fairways ... covid floating around nature waiting find 
Jenny McCarthy whole sub-thread made realize I'm poor Reddit. Thanks! Mass Media hates Sweden

No Second Wave People think second wave France Trumps fault well  Every single person entering border quarantine 14 days Guess explains US death rate sky high compared first world countries. Logic checks out.

I mean serious? data anecdotal? feel thankful thankful 69 year old diabetic grandma kicked thing's ass. feared worst caught it. Thankful outlier cause lost her, shit might purpose. Hey Florida, thing man please stfu? long smart enough get sick, that's really matters. book smarts world make lack common sense. Keep doing. 

For me, I've behaving COVID 50% fatality rate; course take precautions accordingly. Masks everywhere, handwashing time I'm near sink, hand sanitizer every room car, eating anywhere space clean myself. figure good enough protect me, lol. Hard state burning ground. Sounds like Wuhan 5.0 mention mortuary counts President gave shit maybe everyone would board things like wearing mask. mobile device? There's app called Libby rent e-books library. library card, that's it. card first, let sign mobile card good one year. Anyway, could read books own! Uhhh. Maybe let someone know...

Have antibody test? No, they’re not. CERB ending month, BC resident witnessing even restrictions implemented (specifically hospitality sector), many people fucked.

Furthermore, money taxable come tax time year, ton people owe hundreds dollars CRA (most may worse position point.)

Stop making Canada magical utopia. Yes, I’m glad I’m versus US, shit perfect either. You’re right, pandemic scale exhausting. sucks. answer isn’t “well, yeah, guess we’re going let chips fall may” move on. Nature fickle beast makes us things sometimes ideal.

Plus, would shorter people actually followed guidelines. funny someone love hooked ventilator. honest, easier winter fall.

Being full PPE 100+ degree weather already leaving heat exhaustion every damn shift.

Sometimes drink 3 litres water 9 hours keep sweating body starting reject water salt tablets.

Full lockdown winter sounds amazing compared this. Bullshit, clickbait headline per usual western news outlets. Yeah, bad well... honestly bums fucking much see stuff. Like, I'm losing hope entire society point. 5 currently living governors, served term currently living, included. Like Obama, one living Presidents served time still alive I'm guessing referring Trump. no, I'm anarchist, hate positions trade, immigration, blue lives matter, plenty stuff. also personally wear mask I'm indoor environment crowded outdoor env close others. bought plenty masks back late Jan/early Feb myself, wife, parents (having subbed COVID related subs since end Jan, aware risk virus)

But here's thing. still think fucking stupid **mandate** masks sports. person playing. 4 weeks ! Damn sounds awful. symptoms? Hope feels better Thank saying someone mental health issues! tragic. family turkey three separate clusters extended family. seems like safe vaccine hope lot countries What's GDP again? us 8 weeks already. don't. eat restaurants indoor dining. article says exact  flights offline

Some international flights stopped, domestic flights never grounded. Even height lockdown could still book flight wanted. basis Americans anything different countries, anecdotally

Now straight-up spreading false information. worst infection rates world. Yeah no, I’m that. expecting people ridiculous. could walk outside get hit car. Nothing life free risk I’ve accepted that. would rather enjoy life. always like this. Banks used pay customers 1-2% APR money account, long ago. fact actually costs money money stored digitally ridiculous. Buy Bitcoin :3 ~~because rich good deflecting blame mass manipulation~~

Because easy steal bread neighbor nobody going storm amazon warehouse, steal robot, lease back amazon. here.. within time: I've written 10 songs, taken 2 online classes, played finished 5 video games ps4 purchased start pandemic.

I miss socializing things weekend. Pissed hear people taking seriously. Hopefully well leader someday like countries do, then, country highest numbers Ehh..shoot kill retain buffer zone. Thought killing infected judging title Fucking Siberia fire, entire planet fire. Honestly I've kinda resigned myself, I'll vote point think matters. Biden make big enough change fix fucked planet even tried like every major polluting country going magically stop. 2020 seems like kinda start end imo. ...that's international relations work. Masks saved lives God. Best start believing seasonal flu 0.1%-0.5% don’t take measures. Yes vaccine still lose people flu every year don’t wear masks, etc. live Paris still see people la bise. often though. Might well quit allowing fast food cars we're it. cause people die every day well guess known joke go well here. Honestly meant disrespect I'm little concerned quickly people bought end world narrative. going okay. know things suck right now. get better. never open, risk getting covid never 0. Shit gonna spike Thanksgiving Christmas. spread misinformation. Fruits good. Extracted fructose bad liver. ""We tried nothing ideas!"" Yep vast majority would anti-Covid measures wonder fraction came symptomatic people avoiding doctors. It’s peaches I’ve farting Trump rainbows since Easter. /s thought first saw freaked mom was. pulled school I'm pretty sure saw 2nd plane hit live TV. know fact saw collapse. spent next nights jumping every time heard loud car drove thinking goner. wonder contributed current GAD insomnia... world may never know.

Edit: I'm guessing seeing people throw windows upper floors towers child favors either. think that's main point here, u/merlin401 correct I'm wrong. think he's saying primary reason people streets blood despite massive disparity. People living relatively well compared points history also compared many/most areas present-day world. Perhaps satisfied, perhaps demanding more, opinions that. reason simply ""is"" - quote Orange One, ""it is."" People America right generalized population comparatively high quality life seem keep sufficiently placated despite incredible inequities. many deaths serious illness? booked sleeper Chicago NYC once. late October views amazing, lakeshore foliage... One favourite trips honestly. snacks, little wine, privacy, chilled. cheap. restful, lovely time. 

(The return trip sleeper uhhhh nowhere near pleasant. Still better hell flying, though). People nearing retirement retirement anything stocks. Bonds, cash low risk investments. Newsweek news desk: 

1. Open Google
2. Open Saved Search teachers died recently, filter covid.
3. Ignore fact either started classes yet teaching remotely.
4. Sow fear bullshit headlines.
5. Profit. Schools barely opened Paris area ... summer vacation effect ... France huge European tourist destination people avoiding flying far/exotic places, South France packed. People dining wearing masks day ... voila! Let’s give another two weeks effect school opening around Paris ... Considering Spain 40 mil people, France 60 mil, Spain's 10.5k cases would like 15k France. 

In words, yeah, situation France Spain good, schools open. Maybe misunderstanding travelers China banned coming US? keep posting means anything. told there's new disease kills 0.1% infected without doubt infect everyone planet? still 7 million people dead. 

Cancer higher mortality rate. Ebola deadly SARS. Guess people panicking like COVID-19? Imagine children, yikes New York seen lot travelers recently, given much public tourist attractions still available open. Cuomo mandated travelers need quarantine two weeks, enforced way. I’m tired carrying idiots future anymore. common sense stuff. ""It Christmas"" - we've heard before... Another difference known virus possible treatments/best practices.

If run rampant April, would far dead. .. potentially fake quick test app would reduce spread making someone feels symptom stay venue making believe could discovered..... Well guess got point. security theater may help. raises awareness.  Yes, is. I'm working assumption teachers start dropping October, states realize retarded sending kids school pandemic. suppose that's optimistic. February went family doc pain lungs trouble breathing given steroid 10 days cleared up. Actually, coronavirus kills cancer, there's nothing worry about. /s true, cases rising France since July. Unless cruise, US citizens always able come back US. Eating always gamble. Nasty people everywhere close land border aren’t quarantining international flight visitors? makes sense Lol, never said it’s possible. said scientific studies it. true. Sorry - sick reason - want long term damage effect COVID. messed up. employ us $7 per hour. shitty benefits. 

“Thanks” Clearly, selfish, moronic Americans don’t believe science traveled France started new outbreak. shame?

Edit: /s  Hopefully fewer people die second wave. better treatments today we're lucky USA second wave, first one slowly going away, like things go away. 

I fucking clue happen Sweden? Looking pretty good moment, change pretty fast... Yeah rest world basically cut US shut majority international travel - trump didn’t shit many actual 'confirmed' cases re-infection worldwide? mean 'confirmed'. in, un-disputable evidence actual 'confirmed' re-infection. Anyone done numbers? Speaking numbers, actually estimating US globally since testing #s shit storm. CDC claims we're anywhere 3 20 times confirmed cases. lets conservative say maybe 60 million cases US alone. Globally, hell knows. we're looking maybe 8 confirmed cases re-infection? like odds far.... Try None did. It’s bullshit try bother politics. mess every angle. Regardless side on, people never truly happy. That's always likely ever be. believe see eyes hear second hand TBH it’s making post more. :) 12 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday. chance couple hundred years ago. TLDR: 15 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 22 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

From National Health Commission China, yesterday 10/09/2020 00:00 - 24:00 , 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 15 new confirmed cases COVID-19, imported (Shanghai 8, Guangdong 4, Liaoning 1, Sichuan 1, Shaanxi 1) . new deaths, new suspected cases.

Up 10/09/2020 24:00, 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report current remaining cases 157 (1 serious critical condition). Accumulative recovery 80,377, accumulative deaths 4,634, accumulative confirmed cases 85,168, current suspected case 1.

That's big thing, teachers go get job completely different field, lose money they've paid teacher pension get less social security retire. retire work McDs till die. cool. 

Other teachers option losing job paying several thousand dollars void contract get well. They're rich! They've paid slightly minimum wage working careers, afford take year off!

This totally different corporate workers forced work home 2021 collect normal paycheck without suffering consequences mild exposure Covid. Nope, much worse teachers face. 

Fuck you. Emigrate then, “if don’t like get out” way, maybe isn’t place you, maybe better. I'm medication high blood pressure. problem year. fucking year Cases actually rising Germany, too, look graphs. think lot countries locked hard spread got totally control, finally spreading areas populations badly hit February/March point kill virus mitigate infections. cold season coming, health disease experts predicting spikes infections, hospitalizations, deaths. people hunker down, presumably mitigate things. Last time dine February, next time, maybe 2022... Give 6 months fucking shit fucking Sherlock  comes long, dark winter Ahh brilliant logic. Nobody damage years catching virus that's spread widely 7 months, clearly there's possibility could happen! Nevermind evidence shows persisting damage months!

No.  many confirmed reports people seeking tests denied have? ...I’ll wait Queue goFundme page.... 3.. 2...1  true, Bernie Sanders would dead period point blank. political rallies thousands people zero masks. Indoors. binary number, there's difference 115/75, 135/85, 155/105. goes there's correlation risk. I'll give perspective. young (and smoking) BP office like 140/90, red flag doctors none seemed concerned enough recommend get treated anything. I'm 35 current doctor said first visit kind high 145/90, second visit said start tracking try work get lower diet. Went back couple months unrelated reasons around 135/85, said fine worth dealing medicine.

I'm sure doctors medicine happy, everything I've heard blood pressure managed sounds like lot doctors try behavioral changes first use medicine cases someone can't manage get control themselves, since medicines side effects, put blood pressure low. wife BP meds higher mine smallest dose going much diet.

Basically lowered guidelines people minor cases would start making changes. 130/80 correlated much risk, still everything points lower better. 130/80 guideline years now. Restaurants bars open disaster. people thread panicky it? pretty much true yeah. exceptions like international students limited categories reasons require 2 week mandatory quarantine Fun Fact...The symtom FEVER Obese people drug addicts tbh Well, one really big mass death event, waaay back when... really pandemic-related anyhow.. 
were invited! Punch served! person involved wechat conversation several others, singled out? died virus, western media spinned 'results torture'.

This first time I've encountered narrative. narrative I've seen pushed doctor trying raise awareness local Wuhan officials downplaying severity issue. Never seen death suggested anything Covid related. hail gargantuan, cyborg president. May death come quickly enemies.
                                                    -  Morbo, Futurama  scientific consensus lockdowns. It’s brand-new strategy, could consensus? actually read links sent would see hundreds experts oppose it. Drs. Ioannidis, Levitt, Bhattacharya, Gupta, Katz come mind. 

I’m always happy engage good faith people disagree me, conversation slips personal insults I’m out, one getting awfully close. remember seeing people TV actually. supposed know book flight? That's thought countries accepting people based passport, travel history. know travel history actually arrive airport show passport. sound alarm, mentioned previous post Zhang Jixian first so. irrelevant grand scheme things. Western media made whistleblower anti-China propaganda ... no?

They shut December virus may present. shut mid/late March. 3 months uncontrolled spread, article claims true. know guys I'm straight good time. like guy. Play dumb want. explaining obvious. source first point? workplace school common points transmission? Would safe assume countries patients per capita die probably patients per capita suffer adverse effects?  depends whether comfortable contributing problem, really, people high ever really get talk problematic. mad taxes salary used line pockets political donors con men instead helping countrymen stay safe healthy time need.  saying anti-maskers protesting months mere suggestion people wear masks get masks banned? comes football season  Online classes always cost per unit in-person classes, see different. that’s long term damage. damage done Covid, patients recovering (their bodies repairing) damage, viruses work. exactly articles linked says. Long term damage implies “long term”, case studies. Sure, Jan. think lot places *afford* going second lockdown. 

By way currently week 9 10 lockdown mark II Melbourne, Australia. looks like going continue quite time, although restrictions slowly ease we're point new cases 28 days. 

We able people laid getting money federal government though. Seriously, international traveler coming makes country healthier average. Oh know. inane conspiracies I’ve heard come grandparents sad. college NJ time. remember us going top buildings see smoke towers. One college professors worked Yunnan. environmental economist. warned scenario 2010. parts Yunnan 2-3 percent population antibodies given time. situation like viral Isis, spot observe homeland like isis it’s hard know infected/indoctrinated individual arrived us. we've questioned enough Wuhan resulting vurus originating discovered UK scientists, attention questioning really came from, happened last year US quiet outbreaks mysterious cases deaths back home. Well... did. Yea...so teachers still get Covid teaching spread classroom. What's point? US numbers going rest world going up. It’s doom gloom states. bull-ish true Bernie Sanders would 6ft would word headline? appropriate restrictions recommendations place.  buys us time learn develop vaccine, given severity issues associated virus transmissible is. said definitively masks help, even though admit evidence probably effective. explain that? North Carolina c'mon raise take mask spin around like helicopter /s covid symptoms march 17th around July 1st. Around july dry cough finally gone. week later difficulty breathing returned night. Doctor says probably anxiety, since tests could run showed perfect health.

I think kind damage somewhere. I'll fine. good mood talking friends, dishes - normal stuff, I'll like manually make sure take breaths. Maybe anxiety, feels odd *just* difficulty breathing mental symptoms put finger on. ""oh boy, we're tonight. Great."" That’s cheap intervention?

Ok paying 25b keep bars closed

What every business?
Beaches? 

How supposed stop THOUSANDS people got together protesting quite major cities across state. 

What town sturgis relies almost entirely revenue generated one event every year? much get?

At end idiotic list talking floating GDP US many trillions dollars? 97 percent land... 23 percent people. drop state-imposed mandates favor voluntary guidelines, conservative states done.

So stupid. ""It's good idea FREEDOM"" ridiculous take.

Glad we're protecting rights unhygienic among us. Hehe, started conversation mad, student diagnosed Covid instructed quarantine breaks quarantine expelled. Agreed. next 2 months, it’s going rough ride election coming up. It’ll interesting happen November 3rd. Uhhh none that. fact, opposite instances. Actively admitting covid-positive individuals LTC facilities. one greatest failings response Yep. Gloves fine. keep car. really work best short term situations though. put going store, remove toss getting back car. I've put things like using ATMs handling tubes/money get bank's drive thru. remove gloves safely put plastic bag touching things like steering wheel controls. 

You're still washing hands get home, it'll keep inside car clean. I’d hope that’s clearly case. was, wouldn’t debating let alone next president.

As response, clearly won’t coordinated federally time soon coordinated within states acknowledge people recognizing reality. Waiting entire nation sync however leaves us exactly said: bad bad stuff progress. determined person received actual covid vaccine received meningitis C?


I saw another article yes said received actual vaccine placebo. I'll see dig link.



Edit:. confirmed patient receive real COVID-19 vaccine placebo shot, diagnosis transverse myelitis yet confirmed may may linked vaccine understand Disney World open encouraging people go there. could possibly go wrong? Also believe members parliament voted continue working home least November. it’s alright back office, them? Nah fuck that! hilariously ridiculous take 9 different ways. fact CT objectively handling better state fact hit early people wearing masks thanks NY fact handful states actually reporting data fact part state exactly Hartford filled NY commuting idiots well rate fact we're coasting seeing rise elsewhere.

You understand anything speak. stop. shame yourself, teachers, parents. Dig deeper, little guy person clear, different countries UK set rules responsible healthcare. example arrivals countries need quarantine Scotland need England. Local counties add extra measures lockdowns see fit. Hahaha fucking guy. read right, 4% school already got covid first three weeks, chances 5-10% already point. Seems like willing power could herd immunity spring break point, no? Take gander /u/WhiteFarila’s post history. Anti-fat subs trying lose weight herself, r/ChildFree, body dysmorphia..

Some folks low self esteem lash strangers internet make feel better, wouldn’t take personally. you’re right, someone extra careful literally impact anyone else. another, yeah. Totally. WAYYY much country loves guy. american stereotype personified. admit deceitful people buy masks? obvious lying masks working. take genius figure wearing mask help stop spread airborne illness. perfect help. recommending masks earlier killed lot people. Dial up? that?....how? double blind means patients researchers don’t know got treatment vs control. that’s double. requires patients “blind” well.

you fucking moron. Numb? time. now, I’d say majority falling caution fatigue. Wuhan: let's report anything report little can.

Europe: let's least make attempt honest.

US: flu, less.

Edit: Brazil : Aye caramba Thank you!! think about, ha! Perfect example: Collier County FL there’s mask mandate Naples Marco Island ‘opted out’ lest annoy supreme right science denying base.  work, ‘work’ narrowly clearly defined terms whether primary endpoint achieved particular group patients meeting certain criteria.

But overtime, placebo (standard care) improves. frontline doctors know best.  Ok, buy. Thanks. thing Nantucket may fixed local population huge ever-changing tourist population — so, like jail prison. Come winter different story (near-zero tourists), then, tourists. too. read Australian Canadian news mentality different. 

Australia lose marbles two infections shutdowns almost effective. 

Canada’s daily infection rate less US states I'm way, think right
 young boy, milkman guy would regularly drive street I'm fruit truck. 
Those days gone, buy replaced bottled water delivery, instacart numerous others
 Tech makes easier many ways safer.
I'm future many B&amp;M grocery stores go away, unless go flow would democracy fail?

What idiotic thing say. 

Your hyperbolic panic mongering idiotic. I've long noticed this, come realize lot people care see economy president's problem. blows mind but... that's think.

Still, Trump, he's businessman... one part office able trust on? interested finances getting people hate people does.  Sadly zero shock thought I’d phrase “response covid done this.”

But really expect started disproportionate income added 6 months deaths, varying levels lockdowns, economic impact.

Covid bad seeing people rant everyone stay home immensely naive means many, many people without support offset that. you’re thinking portals fuck get degree? made twinkly jazz hands head read Big baby? Ha! I’m one shaking boots demanding endless lockdowns based someone may may another state.

And course you’ve written anti-masker! (I’m not, comply NY’s support limited use part phased re-opening). Anyone notices shifting goalposts holds nuanced position gets called something like sub. 

But go ahead happy whatever lies, shifting goalposts crumbs “reopenings” dopey officials deign grant you. 

I’ll see you’re onto “oh well COURSE can’t reopen there’s vaccine.” ultimately “oh well COURSE can’t reopen, enough people taken it!” think breathing biome make ill? Wtf wrong peoples brains? theres single mutation, kiss vaccines good bye another year. Great, I've always known good talk someone accepts ""the virus around while, might well let metric fuckton people die economy something!"" completely stupid useless! always goddamn stupid me. Like voters think, buzzer beater, saving grace? Like vote candidate needs you? Put coach, vote! Ya that’s guys almost 1300 deaths per million. Literally 4x places like California, 2.5x Texas france 2x Spain. 

“Everybody died. Mission accomplished.” South Korea long ago normalized mask wearing. Japan never even shut down. doing? hope. ""When became clear could get infection could spread asymptomatic carriers know they're infected, made clear strongly recommend masks,"" also, soon became clear enough protective equipment cloth masks homemade masks good masks would buy surgical supply stores,"" Fauci added. ""So context strongly recommending it, correct thing.""

So think didn’t know asymptomatic spread. everyone Covid cough, could keep people home. can’t tell COVID, want everyone wearing mask. Even mask compliance goes 5%, thousands lives saved. guess I'll follow plan totally give people haaaaaaaard. sounds reasonable lololol. Hmmm, even encouraged outside, still restrooms, gym locker rooms, halls, etc... Also happens rain?

What I'm trying say classrooms separated other.. one would expect child infected, (s)he would pass classmates would unavoidably pass classrooms... Protective measures would slow explosion seem weak stop that. Unless something else (e.g kids infectious start still seems like open debate). point lockdowns super effective, expect sweden much worse places like spain, italy, france, etc..

Kids also weren’t raised special snowflakes back then. listen guy, coronavirus tendencies could lead second wave annd flu necessary mutate cause second wave, big factor would separate coronaviruses.

The article cite explains might immune memory tcells could protect certain individuals. However, main point article tcell response important protection, something fail mention

Even use citation support viewpoint, ignoring fact flu comes yearly cycles, many people died Spanish flu could potentially memory flu, mutations surface virus (hemogluttanin), unable neutralize it. Ad hominems attack features person irrelevant whether claims/arguments good. Attacking someone lack expertise ulterior motives clearly that, shit relevant whether claims/arguments certain domains good not.

It's hard. They're gonna kill poor ol' Fauci stress :(

Politics aside everything, seem like good man.  That's great I'm looking someone - anyone - tell misinformation/the study, especially specifically lie (maybe that's says - one name them?) want leaders save day Uh, thank CASES. DONT. MATTER.

The thing matters hospitalizations deaths. often cause mistake first place tho. starve beast model government. Defund insitutions can't function properly use fact arent functioning properly reason defund/remove government service. ever replace anything else either. responsible leader would team experts, children, charge response back January data coming in.

He would ready national plan coordinate resources.

He would clear plan instructions citizens: stay home, wear masks, wash hands, instead calling “hoax.” recent CDC IFR estimates below. decide based memory whether that's gone since last looked.

0-19 years: 0.00003

20-49 years: 0.0002

50-69 years: 0.005

70+ years: 0.054

make sure move decimal two places get percentage Listen science! science mean scientists like promote agenda - left dislike Fauci CDC lied masks also lied things like reinfection asymptomatic spread. It’s role public health officials take role caution, asking individual person make decisions whether need wear mask.

I don’t know what’s wrong public relations communication sociology social sciences people seem never heard before.

Basically spoiled soup told everyone first big press conference symptomatic people need masks children young people immune. 

They knew wasn’t true.  Remember called troll football ""wasn't happening fall""? That’s fair guess, I’m statistician either figured there’d reason. Still feels like Bojos got wrong though 2016 obvious gonna win made money (i never guessed wrong election usa+south america)

and held today would lose, november win Press list look first one that's people mean 99,999/100,000 times can't second wave never leave first yet are, talking thread, reason. ones I've seen masks, maybe though, even so, large do. also worth noting seeing spikes protests started, states like New York New Jersey strong slow cases, even protests. know want believe protesters spreading virus like crazy, people mentioned previously are. Look Sturgis example. Deaths dropped too. Never mind fact healthy person odds dying astronomically low.

Let’s continue ruin economy people’s livelihoods virus isn’t even deadly. It’s almost like it’s election year people day push  Dealing coronavirus *not* making sure hated group gets squeezed death. 

People running bars want open live. Communities want around pandemic. Governments want open bring revenue.

$25 billion chump change point. change opponent ally. That's build successful coalitions succeed goals. mean one things go away time...our country big expect corona disappear everyone stays inside 3 weeks...we know every one comply. it’s gonna come either it, haven’t eventually get whether like front desk hotel work eating dinner couldn’t mask on. Unfortunately also couldn’t leave front desk one there, honestly felt terrible anyways... guest giving trouble previous 2 nights tells “Hey don’t wear mask!” said “Oh I’m wearing one I’m eating” said “Yeah general- don’t care!”....like sir even wasn’t work would still wearing mask. course didn’t one point saw even told child take off. California, although wouldn’t call harassment would definitely call unnecessary idiotic. U.S. far worst Coronavirus response world

I think that's people saying, think implication one ""leaders"" MEDC, we've *completely* fucked lot resources intelligent people disposal. 

We could've nailed it, instead leadership opposite. Testing never optimal, almost anywhere. USA fucking mess beginning. think virus got tired, packed shit left? running like wildfire crazy land course. used blame president this, know accurate. amount sheer stupidity disregard people shown protect others goes way beyond stupid reckless thing fool white house said. may lit candle, blow allowed spread burn house down.

PS. see many people stands football game wearing masks in-correctly all??

If ask me... sports reward. want sports come back, gotta work wear mask social distance cases go maybe sports come back way. Currently trying force virus conform life-style going work. blessing deaths. Seems like semantics me. 1st wave, 3rd wave. gives shit it’s called... it’s threat. Numbers definitely way Dallas County, rarely see someone wearing mask. Let's hope keep making progress! boyfriend got swabbed twice row, first 2 day test rapid result. *is okay?*

i’m checking make sure would enough virus (particularly second one, since it’s rapid result) ensure test would accurate. seems could practically wipe away COVID second test wouldn’t enough get accurate read, thus reading negative. fault

It's entirely fault. are.

They engineered like this. Trump bucks nothing bread circuses need crackdown armed intelligent masses. gone long enough. need allied support need allied special forces aid, yesterday. Free Europe, hear us!!!!? Enemy inside wire. BROKEN ARROW! brave. definitely knew sick leave/caregivers leave important. first response passed, back March 15th, [Families First Coronavirus Response gave people 10 days fully paid, 12 weeks 66% paid leave. problem original bill, covered everyone, almost instantly crippled, unanimous support, cover employees smaller sized companies. unfortunate, like many US responses. Same, Fauci, same. scared.... first month everyone buying toilet paper like virus attacked anus. things died TINY bit, actual country wide mandate, acted like done idiots started going back clubs getting wild. Found one idiots cells possibly mutate everytime divide... statement means nothing. genetic language slippery trying imply.

Reinfection N=1. Possible sample size - 6 million, four hundred thousand. Layman science.

Ok, argument continues based ""caution,"" since scientific things attempt post continue embarrasingly lacking.

Claiming authority history teacher flex...

If want admit ""we know what's going going act based fears"" say it. Stop bringing science. I'm ok afraid, respect it. afraid well. believe I'm wrong discredit person speaking argument they're saying. Somebody automatically wrong dog fight. 

Now yes take thread whole, suppose could argue comment responding part wider critique. soon proof numbers real, discussion.

Because Trump stopped allowing us directly report numbers, seen nothing lies. clearly meant election day driver choices. effed beyond belief.

That's asked. claimed random bureaucrat conspiracy theory even called ""the government leader"". wanna know think is. scares US numbers high, begs question: high China's numbers?

Here's hoping world open borders soon, move away importing products. say like deep south pocket dimension, isolated reality. fact is, affects us I'm embarrassed state's response. closed areas South forced infection areas North things bad initially.

Florida vacationers returned summer lake homes. MILs mom making preparations return Florida end season snow falls.

People fatigued still accepting abnormal real, want go back told already. Well positive university 11 cases every one around us hundreds. consider 50-60yo+ lockdown (+those younger health concerns). 

That's 33% school teachers lockdown schools reopen. disagreeing suggestion. pointing brings much reality governments ""plans"" (for want better word) living elderly vulnerable lockdown too?

So 33%. without draconian measures, la county would voted R year? use ""Karens"" loosely least people 20's (like me) understand we'll defy rules, whilst portion lose shit whenever utilize freedom. 

Nonetheless, cruelty pearl-clutchers entirely justified. husband trying take advantage searching trying new recipes, least one new one week. miss going does, mind waiting ever long takes 'til safe well. I'm slowly learning better cook shit show. Silver linings, that? CDC change guidelines refuses test asymptomatic people? Masks always effective. People Korea battling COVID wearing masks months U.S even cared COVID. 

Your comment DIY-culture America irrelevant basis.

Nobody saying aren’t listening health experts spite. simply observing facts: lie people believe future. got half supposed 1200. Seeing signature it, vanity’s sake, extra kick nuts. thinks Zoom lectures summer break. life need much? disagree. Non-essential businesses matter too. people matter attitude dismissive going through. people don’t spend money places fold. Millions unemployed, don’t matter? I’m 30, I’ll fine. follow CDC guidelines, do, do. drivers would surely India plus resurgence Europe. Case numbers actually going US, ever slightly South American countries. known long time mortality rate high young people, threat passing virus well long mid term health issues disability. ""Other countries badly allowed badly too!"" WASHINGTON — President Trump continues suggest coronavirus vaccine could ready Election Day, top regulators Food Drug Administration issued unusual statement Thursday promising uphold scientific integrity work defend agency’s independence.

In opinion column published USA Today, eight directors F.D.A.’s regulatory centers offices warned “if agency’s credibility lost real perceived interference, people rely agency’s safety warnings.” mention Mr. Trump political leaders, context appeared clear.

“We absolutely understand F.D.A., like federal executive agencies, operates political environment,” wrote. “That reality must navigate adeptly maintaining independence ensure best possible outcomes public health.”

They added, “We career staff best public health decision makers, arriving decisions based unbiased evaluation scientific evidence.”

The pledge career scientists federal government came amid mounting concerns role White House played emergency approvals coronavirus therapies, including convalescent plasma malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, agency later revoked.

A day plasma received emergency approval last month, Mr. Trump accused officials F.D.A. part “deep state” — moniker career civil servants believes betray agenda — deliberately slow-walking therapies vaccines. Top officials agency, including political appointees, frustrated recent weeks comments Mr. Trump made contact pharmaceutical companies efforts speed progress vaccines, giving impression White House playing regulatory role.


The statement USA Today written large part fears political influence F.D.A., including White House, according senior administration officials familiar effort.


F.D.A. regulators issued statement defending integrity alluding potential interference.


Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, F.D.A. commissioner, praised statement Thursday, writing Twitter members group “took initiative independently express steadfast trust expertise commitment organization.”

“I wholeheartedly agree them,” said.

The specter political arm-twisting vaccine approvals grown several drugmakers entered large late-stage trials summer. Mr. Trump told reporters Monday “we’re going vaccine soon, maybe even special date. know date I’m talking about.
That timeline, framed around Election Day, widely challenged administration’s top health officials, said vaccine approval early November improbable. Nine pharmaceutical companies issued joint pledge Tuesday would “stand science” put forward vaccine thoroughly vetted safety efficacy.


Brian Morgenstern, White House spokesman, said statement Thursday “President Trump, administration scientific community dedicated delivering safe effective vaccine quickly possible ensuring approvals based data thorough medical scientific reviews career professionals independent review board.”

“This false narrative Democrats media advancing, suggesting politics influencing approvals, unconscionable dangerous,” said.

Polling published Thursday Kaiser Family Foundation revealed 62 percent Americans concerned political pressure administration lead F.D.A. rush vaccine approval. Four 10 adults said agency paying “too much attention” politics reviewing issuing approvals therapies.

The F.D.A. still defending decision issue emergency use authorization blood plasma event president, Dr. Hahn exaggerated effects treatment misleading data walked back day later. White House officials repeatedly pressed senior health officials issue approval.

In interview Thursday Economic Club Washington, D.C., Dr. Hahn said “totality evidence support authorization.”

“I want reassure American people, revisit decision data justify re-looking it,” said.

Dr. Hahn also refused commit particular timeline vaccine, saying data clinical trials would first evaluated independent monitoring board. F.D.A. reviews data, “cut corners,” said.

“I don’t crystal ball here,” said. “It would really inappropriate speculate, because, again, haven’t seen clinical data.”

Asked whether F.D.A. commissioner independence needed law, Dr. Hahn promised agency would “independently call balls strikes medical products” would lean career scientists.

Dr. Hahn also publicly committed vet vaccine approval advisory committee outside experts, typically review clinical trial data new vaccine approved.

Dr. Peter Marks, F.D.A.’s top vaccine regulator one authors USA Today column, reiterated online event Thursday sponsored Duke University’s Margolis Center Health Policy emergency authorization limited part population would first go advisory committee.   Politicians playing games lifes line. formally got laid job I've ""furloughed"" since started feel ya bro but, can't put toothpaste back tube... vaccines hope now

well, probably could put toothpaste back... syringe. That's really reads. 
 
Someone grieving daughter/wife/friend/sister etc thing u wanna know fat? 
 
Look I'm saying good fat like that's still person loved loved would think would want see photo better understand rather say ""ah, fatty. Well know fault then"" Get Charles Schwab brokerage checking account... reimburse ATM fees domestic abroad. annual fees either. I'll wear mask socially distance possible, I'm going hide apartment anymore. I'm low risk group I'm going resume living normal life aside basic precautions. great source. 

This article chart CDC paints stark picture. Hey now, like Chinese buy PPE back then, American public would open idea wearing masks.

Even six months later, still many anti maskers going around making scene restricted ""freedom"".

And many people wearing piece cloth front face thinking useful surgical mask looked pretty So... person US would get, what? $2-3? already saw spike corona cases days two days cold wet weather. could coincidence though concern participants developed multiple sclerosis transverse myelitis may experiencing neurological symptoms related vaccine. essentially inflammation central nervous system, difficult clinically differentiate early stages. M.S. reasonably common, may well random event unrelated vaccine. Transverse Myelitis much rarer. I’m sure they’ll looking very, carefully resuming study.  like where? maybe slight increase nothing significant. 2 trolling? (in UK) freely visit restaurants/pubs, visit friends homes?  also know virus prepared prevent death April. happened August US happened April, death count could easily doubled, tripled. 

What I'm disappointed fact permanent physical damage tracked alongside death rates. I'm betting hospital death rate fell, requiring long-term care went up. sobering reality? wild hype still prevalent.  missing probably important one: medical staff found better ways treat patients.  China supposedly working COVID vaccines Wuhan Lab last 2 years. I'm surprised working vaccine already. authoritative source assured us small kids immune virus? lower death toll MAY bedue measures we're taking reducing initial viral load leading less severe infections. Who? article 

""Nabarro endorsed Sweden's ability avoid regulation due high trust population government explicitly recommended use lockdowns certain scenarios (including New Zealand found August 11). 

Nonetheless, the radio station's online headline later day blared ""NZ move similar approach COVID Sweden – special envoy Dr Nabarro suggests""."" fact political conspiracy theory allowed sit day replies removed shows mods clearly dont give shit spreading certain political party's agenda. Hey, remember comment? virus back rising Europe (because lockdowns eradicate virus) society economy wrecked (because initial lockdowns) enforce restrictions. face potentially much larger second wave much weaker position. Still think lockdowns success? Love pic employee wiping tricycle. I'm sure every toddler rides pr stunt news reporter say stuff.

He said ""never really locked down.""

Lockdowns happen again.

Maybe store closures I'm Thanksgiving family. pandemic? Please tell 10 million people work be. Huh it’s almost like children interact children love Nashville. Can’t wait get deal vacation property. Oh shit, took while… They're gonna pass 100K/day soon paralysis

to pedantic, paralysis inflammation spine 5 deaths practically unavoidable. also said currently excess mortality. people would died today 2015-19, despite COVID-19 thing back then. care? choice. quality parents would produce quality kids. China pulled off. ass off! ""We hospital beds used"".

Wow, that's inefficient. probably cardiac paddles used moment either, way heart attack numbers reach ""full utilization"" valuable dormant resources? Maybe add lard water supply something? x-ray machines? Think it. probably takes minutes take x-ray likely sitting unused big portion day especially overnight. Maybe ask volunteers get bones broken?

The think it, really want move state clear emphasis FULL UTILIZATION healthcare system. Man, that's exactly top MBA would program hospital design. ""wasted"" resources all. want ER docs seconds downtime patients (we start tracing like Amazon uses ""countdown second"" trackers ~~drones~~ employees warehouses.) Let's nurses work 7 days week. yes, EVERY hospital bed full times! Every scalpel, every bandage, every blood pressure cuff! waste! Got extra one anything? need either start promoting risky behavior use it, least sell eBay. totally waste.  Yes do. Yeah locking enough measures slow spread enough gonna cause harm trying prevent. Id say 3 5 years reasonable time frame start deployed vaccine. ruin economy 3 5 years less 6 months worse great depression. 40,000 people die every percent unemployment goes up. Many many people would go unvacinated 3rd world countries along way things like TB millions would starve. World poverty would pushed back decades Prove scholarly citations GTFO.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, guys must feel like 300-400 years since Trump took office No. England. England good. America bad. Imagine calling Josh Bellamy star read article? Yes talked experts. Yes, vaccines cause side effect. 

Do really think people take vaccine? wouldn’t. protect virus behavior. I’m taking vaccine rarely cause paralysis. Even it’s extremely rare, it’s risk take. Maybe ""could"" read article Large businesses probably heed requirements avoid bad PR, nothing else.

I work large defense contractor. stuff going Hawaii needed send employees to. quarantine two weeks hotel upon arrival, company paying hotel room extra two weeks lived tiny room, working remotely, eating whatever food hotel brought. remember one point trying get exercise bikes rooms, going nuts, though know ever worked out.  I'm even guy arguing with. even mention covid, shitty way talking people. Good job ascribing beliefs people never met judge them.  Sure, reputable epidemiologists virologists say ""yep, we've reviewed data one good go."" create Homeland Security they're going end used civilians? Yeah. Yeah happen. shutdown power grid, shutdown water wastewater systems, shut manufacturing shipping shit people need stay home. delusional? Conservatives say one died spike big deal, even say herd immunity developing. Agreed I'd like choose way preserves life.

Edit: also pretty much way reliably gague many people take vacciene. US certainly controlled worse every developed country, doubt thanks combination incompetent leadership population glorifies ignorance. certainly controlled lot better worse case scenario nothing. 

My point kind thing, always going impossible know would happened otherwise. uncertainty niche refuse understand science math use promote pseudo science. Anti vaxers occupy similar niche. 

To point protests. think lot people bracing big surge them. definitely thread hypocrisy people urging staying home distancing one hand, celebrating protests other. honestly think good way handle situation. months quarantine, job loss, fear uncertainty coupled years decades racial injustice became extreme social issue needed let steam. least mask wearing strongly engaged protests witnessed. also gave us good data Covid actually spread easily outdoors. Especially people consciously unconsciously changed behavior wear masks distance. 

Remember also, scary part never number people Covid would kill directly, 5% worst. Bad horrible, civilization faced worse. young, healthy person, never rational terrified individual risk catching Covid. far terrified getting car every morning. rational terror always systemic risks everyone catching Covid (because extreme spread rate) sick 2-4 weeks. Along completely overwhelming health care system leading unnecessary deaths can't treat people, also might led major supply chain issues point grocery stores getting stocked food. something managed avoid part entirely due sacrifices people like me. 

I get confusion though. There's ton shit going year, getting better. election outcome make anything significantly better short term. good answer keep trying learn understand. That's us do.  factoring recovered cases Florida number? Seems like number talked anymore everyone assuming every case someone infectious running around covid certainly case know they're selfish people convince act like secure they'll feel it. don’t want live like anymore u need come conclusion we’re working cuz we’re bang job. Lockdown, mean real lockdown, 3 weeks we’d done pandemic us. That’s it. u can’t stand living like longer, person blame looking mirror. Lock nobody leaves kill spread virus done this.

I don’t want live fear y’all oppose wearing masks want complain ones keeping virus alive well spreading Us.  Well, clearly going impossible. Ohio one 35 states New York’s travel advisory.

They really turn whitelist instead blacklist. I've saying long time urge travel go symptom. Shocking   significant anti-science rhetoric right now, that’s whole problem.

Many people trust people developing vaccines. However, intense political pressure put forth product. case for-profit drugmakers, huge incentives first vaccine. People also nervous bad product pushed regulators bow political pressure. managers bosses scientists concern, scientists themselves. One hour per day exercise masks mandated (except running) I'm banned I'm busy. tag again. Leave alone. Suck dick give empathy.   compare norway denmark finland? isnt kinda arbitrary?

The fact sweden didnt lockdown better comaprable countries ahrsh lockdowns, suggests lockdowns really arent effective people claim important factors contributing country handle coronavirus.

moreover, sweden stable declining numbers months now. Meanwhile Denmark , France, Norway seeing upward trends . trends continue, theyll either lockdown again, nothing possibly end comparable worse sweden. JerseyMike take sandwich shove ass hahahahahahahaha. Boy trigger Mr. Sensitivity hahhahahahahahaha enjoy weekend young lady. lock we're 200k deaths every 6 months. Falls remains seen. know prevalence right now. Let's say 20% pop it. event, currently pace like 400-500k deaths year measures. still larger preventable deaths. without measures. ignore we'd like million people die every two years. Still insignificant people affected care.

The death rate would keep declining medical care. I'm saying, lot people would died ignored nothing.  Yeah, stumbled one sub yesterday. Showed actual number 7. Odd friend nurse hospital county 350,000 so. one hospital one county lost 3 day COVID. even hot county. doesn't. look graph see lag weeks cases counted second person catches virus often even they've symptomatic. hero deserve. vaccine hundreds millions people may take. affects spinal cord could cause paralysis. Congress shall make law respecting establishment religion, **prohibiting free exercise thereof**; abridging freedom speech, press; **or right people peaceably assemble**, petition Government redress grievances. Trump 100M+ social interactions Biden according article. That's pretty crazy publicity.  country got control avoided massive damage altogether, dude. Great comment. Spain wearing masks everywhere months cases rising people can't keep proper social distancing. things maintain high standard living definitely shrinking. sure, lot fields crazy earnings potential, begrudge people pursuing things. thing, everyone can't pursue things functioning society.

when look way cost living increased way wages stagnated across non-STEM fields, clear problem think best irresponsible ignore okay.  That's strange, owner daughter's daycare said single child daycare county got COVID despite high infection rate. go daycare anymore. understood, back then, wasn’t full support funding whatsoever. republicans split amongst completely disregarding anything democrats table. husbands avoid kissing mistresses pandemic country? figure still kiss wives. voluntarily agree rules. institution want to. Essentially, breaking contract. ""Well...least I'm dumb like you!!!!!""

What you, 12? Go play outside let adults speak. Good afternoon, Mr. President.  many poor people stocks. give historic corporate bailout seemingly justified initial shock justified degree stocks appreciate 30% following months. size bailout clear overkill hurts poor terms subsequent price inflation due expansion money supply. add insult injury, there’s unprecedented shortage quarters poor can’t get coin-op laundry done. mean gone lot. nothing seems eventually work. Yes. I’ve camped summer several weekends colder weather settling that’s window. Let guess comparing small county like NZ airports harbors USA?? words trick. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* also said today people understand won’t going back normal mid late 2021. Even vaccine available later year, early next year, take time distributed. seems obvious me, reason people keep wanting live fantasy land.  believe believe caricature liberal americans get conservative media. 

I human being. like going bars, movies, dinner, work. wife kids enough friends. lost job (travel industry) COVID loans mortgage would caused serious trouble lucky enough find job within weeks.

I've locked kids (2 4) 6 months now.. sit-and- watch-Netflix joyride me, need work 8 hours take care kids without help anyone.

As much would told otherwise, I'm martyring think sacrifice hurt Trump. many liberals can't even bother vote. think would en masse sacrifice lives make Trump look bad? Please. backwards

Lockdowns masks make Trump look bad work encouraged opposite. massachusetts, locked we've got thing pretty well control. states locked they're facing consequences. 

Trump looks bad wrong thing. liberals right thing Probably best. play clip backwards hear Tegnell challenging us kill grandmothers. Lol pointless try argue people man. actually care virus, bossing people around petty authoritarians feeling sense superiority they've never able feel due probably getting much Wow, lot deaths.  Aw thanks. significant means never time controlled, government plan control back normal may time soon since community transmission still rampant. What’s positivity rate currently? It’s far reliable sole metric along cases/pop offer insight stupid would be. 

And school buildings, age-wise? windows opened? hepa filters place? anything done offer outdoor time, esp around lunch times? 

How much effort school boards/district put planning in-person?

My state, RI, launching K-12 experiment now. community spread rate reasonable doubts enough’s done here. school bldgs sub-par. teachers clear Nov. 4th? really is...idk it’s denial stupidity point either way mind blowing. People want November 4th earlier. completely fair New Zealand island nation occupies fairly remote corner planet population \~4 million people.

That said, fantastic job think would disingenuous acknowledge tailwinds going comes combating virus.

China hand completely different beast. 1.8 billion people supposedly stopped thing. Kudos state sponsored capitalism model really gives unique toolkit combat pandemic this. necessarily apples apples comparison either.

Again though, great work Chinese government Chinese peoples part stamping thing out. Indian, don'r pray India. people deserve it. Literally one cares virus, even government.  Someone needs remind Fauci pandemics end people decide end, decides. 1919, official announcement public health agency influenza cases reached low enough number people would permitted resume normal living.

In fact 1918 flu pandemic never officially ended, H1N1 still us Fauci published papers that. believes SARS-CoV-2, unlike every respiratory virus history, stopped beyond understanding. hope get better soon! It’s analogy. analogous context? They’re mostly harmless there’s condition literally flatten curve means.

No, isn't. Flatten curve means maintaining effective reproduction rate 
(Rt) ~1.0. means case load constant, ie curve flat.

The shutdowns lowered Rt far 1 means reduce total case reset? still first wave. reset.

We prepared pandemic. shutdowns supposed buy time get ready bring cases low possible try adequate PPE, testing, etc. reasons. one ever said coronavirus ""completely harmless"" did, claim attributing 1 mil deaths disingenuous harmful radical left reddit likes say is. example, totally healthy person 40 years old come corona virus chances really even notice even life actually danger.

I suppose *are* equivalencies aids 99% people aids something worried all, also virus Dr. Fauci best help big pharma monetize major costs public.  Feel like reasonable things could could still exciting. Please read article again. Fauci probably one smarter experts regarding this, starting get tiresome. warn us wants since zero power anything help make people’s lives little tolerable maybe stop making media rounds.

He’s starting sound like crazy guy disaster movies turns right nobody listened makes difference plot. bad government, worse people live system everyone lusts horde amount money possible. idolize succeed. Well, many people stupid, imagine hopes good sense aware careful. rest spoiled rotten disease-spreading lost cause endanger us financial luxury hunkering completely.

If sound angry, am, long day yesterday waiting storeful chin masking people coughing loudly gleefully proclaim intentions travel, attend parties commence holiday shopping. September. Chinese political system efficient Western one. needed, sacrificed many, back track US got walloped Europe stuck virus next year. that's point misdirecting?

Sure China could done maybe even so, still might enough contain virus. regardless China do, Trump get free pass inaction others could done more. 

Blaming China US chance act similar successful countries falling classic Strawman fallacy. Lol commenting article going ""Hey man..everything going great..COVIDs way down!"" 

You’re literally detached reality. Show comment I’ve made that’s close this? ...as article literally says otherwise. I'm somehow touch reality posting facebook anecdotes stuff easily verifiable lol me. relieve mental stress constant feelings isolation. That’s unhealthy, too. Something finally excited about.  new cases 28 days? take years hmm, depends bad want job guess!
take precautions possible prepared quarantine necessary (i think quarantine rule still place while?)

sorry really answer question. guess truth one really knows, people get travelling, don't! That's good foresight prepare make sure family friends prepared well things really went south, bet really appreciate now. Also wanted add love included Pandemic one credentials.

Stay strong hang there. hope you, family, students stay safe healthy. focus deaths. long term effects virus. countries bad outbreaks contro

it's laughable think arizona care california does. clear arizona whatever darn well please year. what's going shoot arizona bone spur politically treatment veterans whatever mccain family say. there's dramatic shift arizona last months guarantee ""losers"" ""suckers"" LA county schooling.

EDIT: based small survey schools podunk, nowhere would say schools can't figure meet person without dramatic increases cases. maybe LA county higher per capita case rates currently, larger schools, larger classes, lower funding per capita might better lifted restrictions logic would dictate otherwise. shit right exactly people give stop complying whatever bullshit government tells lol. everyone wants stay home forever, unfortunately reddit 80,000 Americans died flu 2017-18 flu season. Imagine much lower number would lot people wore correct mistaken however;

PCR establishes presence specific genes, infection.

Even best antibody claims reveal sensitivity specificity outcomes outside margins acceptable clinical error. Also, citations I've access incomplete data sets lacking essential clinical indices like titers, control reference much less clearly established outcome, etc. 

Thanks remain vigilent skeptical because, covid19 test information appears sketchy. happens nationwide? Schools open? rightly so, apparently. btw Norway, Denmark, Germany. Well sending COVID positive patients back care homes zero infection controls place. I'm sure happen hospitals risk getting overloaded. wait 2 weeks!  1 hour delay fetching comments.

I'm somehow touch reality posting facebook anecdotes lol. move similar approach COVID Sweden - special envoy Dr Nabarro suggests"".

WTF ! NZ done far better Sweden. say same. Covid-19: made China
Vaccine: made China
Brilliant business idea! China Dragon’s Den yet? (Or Apprentice, American buddies). Sweden never locked seems getting it.

The US never _really_ locked seems getting it.

That leaves Europe, well successfully locked Asian countries, face fact lockdowns delay inevitable we'll deal six months rampant spread get done with.

Our (European) government seems realising taking measures second wave; primarily hits young point, death rate 0.6%, best let thing build herd immunity.

Ultimately, Swedish approach correct one. suffered months clear. Everyone else successfully locked sank economy still needs deal virus. got CanSino vaccine. go google search this. wrote comes Uncle CEO recently gave interview making claim.

My uncle got vaccine guess works one manufactures making vaccine CanSino. negative reactions. think one checked history assumed took different stance. 

Yep. sad. Teachers people too. mom works school, back week, I'm terrified her. conservative area almost one wearing masks. scared death go back, needs job. lot lower...

The IHME 4 x high IFR models. thanks, appreciate it! makes feel little better rapid results (second test) come back negative Since article say much, several reasons :

- quarantine mandatory aka checks whether really stay home. found people self discipline strictly stay 14 days home. reducing strict checking, expect quarantine actually respected all. 


- course, without agreement scientists. found contamination highest 7 days. that, low. decided take risk. Adding mandatory masks places, risk low. 


- mostly, economically, can't people go 14 days medical leave. sad capitalistic that's is.  Believe ready pandemic 2005. dealing H5N1. Bush took seriously reading book called Great Influenza. Imagine President reads books. even constructed plan slow virus. also respected Dr. Fauci.   Except leadership Germany hardly anything chancellor individual state response.

I’d read world works spouting reddit ‘trump bad!’ reddit bullshit. im two months behind rent jobless. exactly hunker down? happened 15 days stop spread doctor? Uh why?  right, think article signifying much depended technology get pandemic, particularly education work sector. Videoconferencing thing average consumer 2005, social media barely taking off. Yea that’s comment replied one shrugged anything lol want look Faucis eyes tell cases going go down. government chose post ""deal it"" gif golf course move along

Why call bullshit facts don’t matter? sound exactly like GOP parrot. change subject move goal posts look dumb lol Clearly opening colleges going well. hundreds people bar near university last night saw pics uni's sub. sucks people infected can't take responsibility 2 weeks stay inside quarantine. adults eating generally terrible people. bartend told go fuck several occasions asking someone wear mask inside.

They've flat told us come work testing positive symptoms can't force anyone use sick leave, can't force anyone get tested, can't force actually tell anyone tested positive. They've stopping reporting cases jail, last update think month ago, local newspaper got give update. think total 700 inmates tested positive overall 215 active cases jail. Number detention officers unknown, one point 50, counting jail staff all(clerical staff like myself), entire area 4 5 tested positive early actually pretending care quarantines. 


 2 people office, know of, tested positive early July, quarantines, one could get tested, access location inmates testing, testing locations available public taking 2 weeks results. cleaning supplies hand santizier donated local distilleries. 2 weeks ago clerical employee works evening shift across hall office died ""double pneumonia""(except several people office know family told covid). sheriff pushing detention officers go physically checking pods vs visual checks working since March. Oh class action lawsuit filed county mishandling going on(including officers told beginning wear masks would scare inmates) people thought I'd happy. seem already think over. read air airplane cleaner home constantly recycled.

That said, hate Biden seems little blown proportion. seems like fine candidate. million clips struggling get point across, every lengthy video I’ve seen mostly fine.

See: Clinton inheriting huge deficit HW Bush reversing budget surplus. Bush taking surplus, reversing back massive deficit throwing us cliff 2008 recession, Obama taking 2008 recession reversing it, Trump inheriting resulting solid yearly growth needlessly exploding deficit fucking everything 2020. 3 months left year, there's *no way* economy good shape Biden wins takes 2021. again, like said, he's going spend first year two fixing shit never broken first place. 



It's song dance time time Republicans fucking *exhausting.* fact third time row happening *exhausting.* fact Republican voters can't see what's happening *maddening.* really doesn't. understand people keep making invalid argument caution unnecessary 
when talking unknowns related deadly infectious respiratory disease. 

For example, someone puts study shows lung damage hospitalized patients, rational correct interpret mean non-hospitalized patients going fine nothing worry about. rational interpretation may also occur non-hospitalized patients. know sure, caution warranted. 

The problem default implied argument skeptic side, ignoring risks, exact opposite correct default dealing pandemic. too, Doc. feds hate? really understand blanket hate seem feds. say ""this generation"" - mean young people? so, complete utter bullshit. People ages hard. fact, young people probably easiest. People older, families, kids home, lost jobs can't feed families...ya, that's real hardship. Young people suffering worse way.

So yeah, means under-reporting. That's saying. post filled speculation. takes number excess deaths, arbitrarily attributes Covid. (""They happened timeframe, soooo Covid.."")

This good science, get flu numbers year. 

But go ahead, tell us responsible 200k extra deaths since pandemic started, happen coincide pandemic.

Yep. New carousel silliness every week. incorrect.

The Swedes fact super focused public health. understand public health extends far beyond effects COVID-19 alone. interview Agners make point actions like shutting schools inflict life-long, irreparable harm children must taken account considering policies like lockdowns. Overly simplistic. Government action minimal import US.

The response going people decide be, we're diverse country *lot* opinions.

Barring vaccine next couple years, I'd bet US endpoint herd immunity and/or major decrease vulnerable populations, say lot deaths. probably feel threatened seeing people right thing. fuck going about?

Can't second surge never leave first schools reopen result something less severe equivalent draping children tuberculosis blankets, God forbid looks like normal school year, shows constantly-incorrect ""experts"" draconian anti-virus measures necessary. That's why. Yeah, read wrong. skimmed saw part everyone house positive. missed others werent. Sorry.  I've keeping track US (mostly certain states) India much picked head look countries! Oooffff Dr. Ezike explained anyone passes away testing positive virus included category. ""

 nominated Nobel prize medicine this!! Okay one ever said “polls 100% certain locked stone”. Many people (maga folks) refuse wear masks idiot president politicized beginning even knew serious deadly disease. yeah, fault. doubly cursed, think. doubly selfless ♥️ According article ""he house everyone lives house also tested positive covid-19.""

also, thought 'most' visitors also tested positive. I'm clear letting covid positive people intermingle covid positive people terrible idea. Implying SECOND.

... maybe THIRD!? job get pandemic control? Kind like jobs everywhere actually (obviously large meaningful scale still) I'm sorry took time write out. misread article, thought infected. 

Upon reflection though, better argument would virus particles get, worse infection be, higher risk death have. Also, re-infections seem phylogeneticly different strains covid-19 causing coronavirus (last time checked, anyway, admittedly last week.)


All childish stupidity show agree on. I'd argue points technicalities that's dumb lol. right. Even keeps getting pushed back. First told us expect vaccine Fall. said winter vaccine. they’re saying early 2021. actually read something saying vaccine hopefully end 2021. lmao, sure are, Dr. Fraud. Except isn’t true. Here’s us video multiple Democratic governors, including governors California New York, applauding Trump administration’s response: handled it, way all, would saying ""you know dont like trump, handled pandemic great, theres that"". upset makes daddy look? weak ass shit. answer question. Problem: discover new virus exists world.

Solution: don’t try reinvent wheel experimenting idea hurts people helps. 

Instead, encourage people support immune systems healthy lifestyle. Perhaps, recommend nursing homes take temperatures door allowing visitors since elderly risk group. However, completely isolating elderly cruel considered last resort. biggest fucking DUH  technically ad hominem. kind argument person espousing one infers skepticism X's statements domain X's lack expertise domain X's clear ulterior motives making ungrounded claims domain Y. 

Here's another kind argument. Suppose someone claims allow conversion therapy, citing evidence works published group led pastors homosexuality yet psychologists. Skepticism group would warranted given experts also ulterior motives. 

In short: fallacy. I’m hearing given chance would vote twice can’t fathom anybody wouldn’t. need advice helps go ER. It’s better safe sorry, ya know? Especially dealing pulmonary issues. Hope start feel better MRI comes back results make happy less stressed.  Listen, Karen. really care risk much you, everyone around you. pandemic leaps bounds showing fucked ""Fuck you, I've got mine"" mentality is.

Gonna ensure thing spreading uninhibited fulfill Master Tegnell's goal herd immunity. one adding meaning, me. government leader explicitly stating taking actions limit liberty citizens based upcoming election, actual science. send chill spine. Neb. (AP) — Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts end nearly state’s social-distancing restrictions Monday even number new coronavirus cases trended upward last new rules still limit size large indoor gatherings, concerts, meeting halls theaters, drop state-imposed mandates favor voluntary guidelines, conservative states loosening restrictions Sept. 14,” Ricketts said news conference. one saw epic beard person facing camera article photo looking closer realizing black latex glove? That's dumb. Boss makes dollar, make dime, that's poop company time. sure is. Spain France high number month, youd expecting larve amount deaths. Even August heatwave, corona seems less potent. Well supporters Continuing prayer India. People get probably likely try lead normal lives general, including going restaurants. cowering basement living life Reddit mod, get coronavirus. also get hit car. get shot street. tan. never girlfriend. Life choices. Basically Fauci going run cover Trump regardless.  Paywall. commentators already subscribers, commenting based headline? No, this. Delete Facebook. better. think anyone saw coming. Like whole masks debate...just...why? 

I get Trump administration cares two things: re-election stock market, pretty much nothing else. even angles think best course action take meaningful action stop COVID. What's opinion? they're far gone? wrong less deadly. Please spread misinformation. That’s.... that’s literally he’s saying article. 

“We might third wave schools reopening, hopefully not, knows.“

The pandemic experts looking data know. they’re saying we’re gonna go back again.... Wise decision - coronavirus. Seeing people making choices mirror makes uncomfortable. have, never even barely capacity. What, want turn news new COVID epicenter? I've baffled well. People sub (and reason CNN) desire stay locked science CLEARLY showing us virus worth long-term destruction. point, frankly, pathetic kinda creepy. No. stand position second week figures usually quite close final figure. hey. follow weeks, actual facts go on. waste time know sure. RemindMe! 1 week. Mandate what?  lot people asymptomatic never get tested that's millions millions unaccounted positives really collapse number ;) want hospitals collapse.  quotes passage specifically references many outbreaks 2018 Orthadox Jewish ""Amish people use Facebook."" mean one check absolutely fuck-all? difference Sweden it’s mandated. idiots think already know vote.

You grossly underestimating number idiots country. 5head: can’t second wave first wave doesn’t end. Sorry, I’m dick you’re trying conversation. 

Just clear, completely agree you. wear masks every time I’m public, exceptions. know lied masks continue what’s best (wear masks.)

I think people feel like this:

Scientists: don’t need wear masks. 
Anti-Masker: See, don’t need wear masks. 
Scientists: Actually, masks help. 
Person: Please wear masks. Science says helps. 
Anti-Masker: Scientists can’t even make mind. I’m wearing dumb mask. Right reason study first place ws noticed heart tissue destruction died covid. autopsy specimens COVID-19 patients also displayed marked sarcomeric disruption similar **fragmentation**, well prevalently **enucleated cardiomyocytes**.

That preprint abstract. already noted humans. Also ""enucleated cardiomyocytes"" means nucleus removed cardian muscle cells. really something want see. again, happened people, petri dish. Summer 1967 race riots almost every major American city, might happen, way think mean... Which, imo, still suggests disproportionate global response something responsible 1/60 global deaths. Nothing. buying shit propaganda want sell. expresses frustration opinion US can't get cases down. answer course right front him. President's unwillingness take seriously, constantly downplaying issue, making fun people wearing masks, giving false hope disappearing, refusing coordinated federal effort testing (and even questioning testing). 

He's standing next problem say would end job. There's time work within system there's time take stand what's right. long past time stand honest we're failing.  elections.  could call Presider...

The Presider Unites States America confirm. re-entered US end march, screening joke. ironically returned EU last month screening all, there's that...  able see families long went back inessential work site. mean, one trying downplay deadly virus make political issue. People extremely alarmed, I'm definitely hyperbolic. That’s you’re problem. Things going happen America, real quick. Stay house. guys worshipping way Mueller worshipped.

Fauci saying Trump always message coronavirus.

He, Surgeon General, CDC participated lying America people masks making us sick PPE shortage.

Doesn't justify lying though. could made policy prevent citizens buying n95's. could informed everyone make fabric masks beginning. 

Instead Fauci others lied.

I'm done pretending guy Pandemic-Jesus. Somebody spilled milk. Tour de France fucks sake. Germany everything still canceled foreseeable future.

You know DFB Pokal literally starting tonight one Monday games (Dresden vs HSV) around 10.000 fans there? would virus worse is? Sweeden bottomed out. seems like either quick lockdowns ups downs cases get one major blast cases bottom (See NY well) i’m one asked add problem nursing home employees working multiple jobs many live roommates multigenerational households, take public transportation lackluster access healthcare? also contributing spread. Thanks kind words. take drink coffee work, enjoy job. I'm guessing people shitting day, lol.

Pooping company time one life's great pleasures. would waste free time get paid take deuce?  main problem many states taking virus seriously. leaders feel human lives expandable. mindset Is. look Florida re-opening bars next week roll eyes. really want leave America

i dont know america leave job state  almost spit soup. Fucking gold. Respiratory illnesses spike winter due many different factors. Cold weather means people inside more, people closer contact (not much concern AZ TX like mentioned). Drier air weakens first line defense respiratory viruses, mucous membranes. influenza virus, cold temperature causes coating harden, making harder immune system fight increasing survivability surfaces. know SARS-CoV-2 similar way, completely different type virus I'd assume (no idea though) Fauci one left I’m willing listen to. rest agencies corrupted. main problem many states taking virus seriously. leaders feel human lives expandable. mindset Is. look Florida re-opening bars next week roll eyes. friend works IRS. getting name put check slowed process nearly week. never said I'd answer either questions... 


At first glance, questions seemed kinda fallacious somewhat non-sequitur. wanted emphasize others COVID flu quite different. can't expect behave / rather affect humans same. 


If somebody besides Wikipedia help advise Spanish Flu disappeared, would great. curious. first assumption killing 20-50 million souls, simply burned due flu's main weaknesses: herd immunity summer. enough new vulnerable bodies left keep strain alive 1921. ""If SOMETHING could this!!!""

... every world power fucking figured out. Imagine US could swallow pride ask countries handle certain issues better us. great country could be.   Ah old trick, lets dismantle truth make saying places US people dying outside hospitals ICU beds available count?

Umm... No? I'm struggling see could even ridiculous interpretation think saying that. want get discussion excess deaths vs. reported deaths, guess that, think find quite agreeable subject.

The rest post speaks purely deaths. 

Two things:

1. title cases. US performing considerably worse currently different stat make title ""clickbait.""

2. Deaths trail cases. US caseload 2-4 weeks ago? Higher. Europe 2-4 weeks ago caseload? Lower. 2-4 weeks cases start turning deaths, likely see different story. Congrats, SC! Keep up! 👏🎉👍 Actually first link made mention post filled speculation. takes number excess deaths, arbitrarily attributes Covid. (""They happened timeframe, soooo Covid.."")

"" take sophisticated statistical model see coronavirus pandemic causing substantially deaths would otherwise occurred. ""

It however, take hard evidence. which, links fail deliver.

So, yes, weak. What? *sigh*    
no, could've closed borders early on... locked regions based infection left open.   
but muh freedoms people decided flaunt masks point rifles legislators everywhere.     
To would definitely work well.   
But look South Dakota, okay... they're fucked.    
All stay fuck away everyone wear mask probably next year... COULD'VE lot easier, way curve... could've much quicker.     
And... well let's wait see new strains unchecked spread cause. Real talk: data support this? Disney certainly perfect, allowed far riskier activities resume (eg indoor dining). sort watched Florida reopenings, thinking going fail, nothing, knowledge, happened Disney appears actually quite strict compliance. Many articles we’ve seen pass talk “potential” spread don’t se actually materialize large outbreaks. Amusement parks open many states really can’t think example major outbreak linked back them. place patrons spend majority time outdoors masks (compliance varies depending park operator), it’s terribly surprising. Finally, let’s forget parks already done events them, real blow back incident. get Disney easy target let’s sensible here.

This Disney. good number smaller parks probably brink bankruptcy good number folks probably verge becoming unemployed. don’t think charge without considerations think need strict regulations, like closure thresholds automatically triggered, conversation. Unlikely. happen plague, killed third European population, happen 1918 (50 million deaths across world), doubt it'll happen now. friends still shake hands unless someone asks to. Also hysterical people elbow greeting mask down. point piss off. aren't. Huh. Literally possible metric math use say first surge. weird headline. tbf also large outbreaks vegtable picking operations. Fauci alot ties George soros Dang wish homies would kiss even Hicks gonna hick know hard hear dumb, logical extrapolation. several Quebec municipalities also ban 'burkinis'

Read link. happened France, Canada. Calling traitors may give smug sense superiority (not disagree, they're fucking traitors) wont help Donny boy wins election. wonder many people died ICE custody last years. It’s become American virus people say Merkel Wuhan hospitals visit waaay covid exploded. 

So knew hospital system like uncivilized place. Wuhan collapse happen place Germany. Havent googled it, might rumor. oh mean free money never got? Sorry, typing antigen, brain processing antibody.

Yeah, rapid tests would really nice. I'm sure industry/manufacturing produce test everyone every day. Yeah, it’s shame America doesn’t tripartite system. could really use executive branch right now. trying call out, argue - genuinely curious...are telling truth comment? so, tell us uncle China taking vaccine? feeling overall? Thank you. people listen refuse listen matte

We decided homeless worth order keep people safe virus  99.8% survival rate. say this, people crucify tell get facts straight. facts straight, foolish unfortunately people like pay price. I'm beyond disgusted done. anyone says anything long-term effects... stop right now. Preach it. government incompetent forget outdoor pools opened. gyms did. elected billionaires afford pay enough election officials make look like fairly.

[Most billionaires turned Trump donations 99 billionaires Biden's 131 billionaires. Despite huge cuts taxes ultra-rich, Trump's mismanagement COVID crippled American economy cost many dearly. exacerbation racial unrest hurts business interests. Trump's bluster general incompetence direct risk wealth.

(It's also shocking look recent data; Since May, Biden added two dozen billionaires donors Trump added six). Um yes  do.

Science, politics, society, mixed one palette. Can’t avoid it. still satisfied using science wedge drive encompassing policy. particular thing discussing, certainly stand corrected.

Thanks Oh, God, sorry. Poe's Law got me. everyone smoking weed day, bothered boredom staying home day watching old episodes Simpsons, they'll less tempted go stuff would lead catching virus.

A brilliant preventative! way rural areas US. Buildings signs saying masks required, state law store policy says so, nobody wears one. Huge chains like WalMart full people masks nobody wears local shops gatherings. argument worth having, maybe covid around 100 years ago death rates would similar, would help you? assuming CFR constant decent measure number cases, since hard fake hide death.You blame ""pneumonia"" even show statistics.

But impact ? no, bad. insufficient. makes feel remotely better, 60something year old cousin voted Trump last time, said again.

I'm sure pushed exactly, vaguely ""chaos"" world right now. He's army vet I'm thinking recent Atlantic article got angry. There's difference outbreak epidemic. compare france didnt allow people go outside without signong papers dont see hige difference Unless live isolated life, really would way knowing contracted virus first place. Goddamn, nice (though misguided) attempt shift blame DeathSantis regular people trying survive. Like.  DAMN. troll think diffrently.Sorry forgot subredit was. Trump can't win fair contest point. deep unfavorability numbers going change among majority voters. 

That said, *could* get close enough enough states he'll try make impossible voters many communities vote could tip election favor. However, *should* difficult election law run state level 270 electoral votes either safe democratic leads (e.g., [Massachusetts Biden despite Republican governor) Democratic majority democratic governor.  

I'm saying claim include cheating, disenfranchisement, Republican supporters voting twice (with encouragement), using evidence voter fraud encouraged sign trust election, refusing concede. still important get everyone vote Democrat make harder election stolen. Let's forget Trump also recently urged supporters ""stress test"" system voting absentee/by mail person. thing felony, suggestion Trump crime. course, held responsible. honestly can't understand time line works. actually fight back? Sweden herd immunity. think underestimating number idiots country. Edit: Bike rally caused HUGE uptick cases (TO STICK LIBERALS)-----Sept. 9, 2020 -- Sturgis Motorcycle Rally drew 462,000 biker enthusiasts South Dakota August superspreading event, responsible 260,000 cases COVID-19 -- 19% 1.4 million new COVID-19 cases Aug. 2 Sept. 2, claim researchers San Diego State University independent research EVERYTHING SAME: large gatherings superspreading events, Sabia says. previous reports, Sabia colleagues researched effects President Trump's Tulsa, OK, indoor rally June 20 Black Lives Matter protests 315 cities, find increases COVID-19 cases related not? ""One reasons local residents [in cities Black Lives Matter protests] increased stay-at-home time,'' Sabia says, probably due fear virus fear Tulsa event, Sabia says, restaurants bars downtown closed voluntarily, smaller-than-expected crowd attended event, probably helping explain event lead spike cases. Non positive testing people charged terrorism related crimes coughing people. I'm sure someone dies someone knowingly positive spreading virus negligent way even there's criminal charges could well lose civil case. Italy surging again. Downplaying good small percentage Americans well market? realize hardly Americans money market. least close upper class has. 

How gambling options make downplaying deadly virus good?

I trade little good ROI doesn’t make feel better able hug mother, people know died, job cutting hours 25% loss bonuses benefits.

Optimism good downplaying threat try save/make money downright evil. Anyone condones made money part problem. earthquake disaster devastates country area would unite

&amp;#x200B;

but....

there ""earthquake protesters"" showing debate whether one actually happened. Hugging. Nah never. I'm north. 

We big parents children one else, except wife. Whew, thank god I’m lone ranger. Damn, like crackhead gobbling whole knob get next fix.  
But still nothing, ain't getting troll food go ahead give another throat gobble, I'm kinda liking it. (google translation) Published Sunday 6 September 09.58          
         
In email, Uppsala Municipality urges school staff tell students parents children infected.     
         
This despite fact website states guardians informed.           
       
Principal Christina Stenhammar says municipality initially intended inform, changed due privacy reasons. ""Right investigation. develop routines next week."" seriously get shit. 

Fauci, guy apparently depressed people listening. guy said masks work logic right here! Literally came admitted fact

Hasn't anyone heard boy cried wolf story?!?!  

I get people see happen. continue blindly believe afterwords. two months come say masks actually work specific virus sma shit, told people works give comfort freak revolt(I actually believe this, using example). literally seen willing something like that. 

Not mention president says craziest shit. sides news blaming political team everything nonstop. 

Its honestly next impossible trust anything point lol. trust broken look actual data, really bad. go gym get haircut flu season? 

At point live life, allow establish herd immunity. believe vulnerable virus due co-morbidities like obesity, take whatever precautions make feel comfortable. really upset move lives, can't/wont stay home wear masks forever. matter? high need start caring? Thanks. Extremely good points. points nearly strong post. say one else mental health effects. said generation effects mental health job loss least health benefit. That’s message isn’t working.

I don’t get everyone hard “no message fine!” really wanted avoid infection spread, you’d interested figuring whatever messages tools took make happen.

If message fine, would working. ""Poor decision"" simply value judgement personal lens I'm pretty sure Bush's FEMA go way [hijack PPE shipments never said fucking thing New York Times engaged comprehensive effort track information every coronavirus case United States, collecting information federal, state local officials around clock. numbers article updated several times day based latest information journalists gathering around country. Times made data public hopes helping researchers policymakers seek slow pandemic prevent future Times’s data collection page based reports state local health agencies, process unchanged Trump administration's requirement hospitals bypass Centers Disease Control Prevention send patient information central database Washington.

It must take real effort fucking blind facts. live vacuum,

You're right, vacuum

it's echo chamber :\^) Good stay Texas. close friends Sweden right though.  know Bold assume Biden going win.

The deck heavily stacked Biden, chances see real leader maybe Trump passes away revolution. fucking stupid enough say wearing mask ""risk""... them. People vaccinate many still won’t wear masks. totally agree covid positive people intermingling covid negative people problem. per article, evidence so. Remember, concept quarantine loose, likely boiled 'don't leave house mingle people covid negative'. he's sitting there, phones friend boat, several covid positive people hang together. behavior that, likely deserving $500 fine, deserve 'expel college $36,500 fine' penalties commenters offering. Plenty big problems pandemic times. Covid-positives commingling one them. US tests lot Europe. Europe follows Trump method less testing = less cases. Like, imagine elected official yelled reporter question “muffled”? even though prevent taking healthcare workers, know Trump jumped hard. People wearing masks direct opposition narrative pushing. case, LA county Health Director.

So director city's health department means kind ""government leader""? bureaucrat elected nominated mayor something? think audio clip means there's large conspiracy political class media commence election? That's exactly it. best kind lie is.  situation mask wearing Sweden. said ""I believe it"", I'm guessing live Sweden? Well course. Masks recommended yet, simply part strategy moment. several things prevent corona spreading, cases decreasing Sweden. Masks, measures, saved *when* *where* needed. want make sure people grow tired measures end acting recklessly (long-term strategy). simple that. Masks become politicised.

People hugging other? Uhm.. find people hugging country. crazy, right?! ...because apolitical remedy climate change. Unchecked capitalism fix long cheaper make goods services dirty fuel. Look quick Polis open Colorado warm weather got here. Look police flat refused enforce quarantine even little bit. city, Vegas, adult playground opened. thought same. germaphobic behavior. Wash hands, wear mask. That's need. Anything else sanitation theater. Mitch McConnell way. numbers place constantly falling tests become prevalent. Yet people like double because, what, want global pandemic? life sad need cause unify people? world overreacted, confronted, double bullshit. What's Fauci's political affiliation? anybody makes sound chalkboard, I'm gonna lose shit quietly updated yesterday. 

they changed IFR weighted average stratified, reweighted, much higher previous estimate? could use math assist sure. order groceries online don’t come contact people. Plus, many shop absolutely needed reduce exposure. Limiting exposure allowing people use proven method vote eliminates need wait line potentially sick people makes sense. 

Plus, go limitations polling place locations myriad voter suppression techniques used GOP (vote patrols, ffs!) mail voting eliminates. 

If can’t understand real reason GOP hates idea mail voting, you’re idiot. afraid people vote, chance. know minority held onto enough uneducated, motivated vote group relevant. end GOP know coming. can’t come soon enough. basically soon lockdown lifts pandemic comes back vaccine somewhere half us get infected?

Yes, that's many people said lockdowns really work. get things control short term, they're sustainable.

Also, we're constantly told European countries huge safety net government pay people stay home months time... surprise! That's true. actually get vaccine first people start spamming shit?

'Micro' updates vaccine bad enough, fucking micro updates people *want* it? incredibly confused comes people dont wear masks now, yes. irrational action isnt like clarifying unifying reason. Everyone irrational reason. 

I look article behavioral sciences get better grasp this, thank you. like two viruses injecting ribosome simultaneously? peruse /r/Conservative times see side amount people see claiming virus wont int media election fucking insane. Im Canadia getting daily intake corona news government polical megadome showdown going right now. get oblivious/ignorant appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Um, no. ""March nothing"". Canada also told wear masks March. 

Then became known, implementation masks considered appropriate thing every country's health agencies. Since Prime Minister head ass, advise parlayed population. like, testing shit done, since trying downplay political gain. 

Our country currently shit show. 200k dead now, 400k end year. 

Please don’t spread fear-mongering misinformation. currently pace ~750 deaths per day (and falling). rate would instantaneously increase 1800 achieve extremely unscientific draconian projection. think feel like something might happen doesn’t mean science supports it. I'm fucking angry start saying ""hundreds thousands"" now. avoid clean obviously, pffft armature 😂 ICE = Intentional Crime Enforcement? ""Don't listen history teachers.""

Retract statement.

Not say ""biology teachers unimportant"", safely say teachers life utmost influence respect position, appalled you, representative academia, would say something brash. Then, coupled statement, proceed promote incomplete statistical possibility NYC safe second wave.

That's read. came across full hubris. want affirmation stupid decision. like reminded ""freedom"" decide cuts ways.  Yes going blame message. Covid-45 killed people wear masks, I'd completely different take it. doesn't, unfortunately. herd immunity option? Seems work Sweden south north, rural Wisconsin. That’s definitely something worried about, it’s also awful strategy Trump. saying it’s going rigged going discourage supporters voting. Maybe it’s good strategy damage mitigation event close EC victory Biden, situation maybe he’d actually didn’t discourage voters turning out? It’s link article information. Trump control individual states' Covid dashboards. Trump control independent Covid websites like Covid Tracking Project, Covid Act Now, worldometers, statista, Johns Hopkins, etc. 

That's guy saying, see downward trend cases deaths sources *independent* CDC / feds. true want compare flu season happening right now.

If chose different time year wouldn’t comparing flu season. Georgia providing reliable data public concealing school infections really idea well things going. Joining Spanish-speaking brethren South America. average daily cases 50% past 6 weeks. ""getting new cases down""? read article yesterday said cases up, hospitalizations flat. Seems like progress me.  state this? south. don’t know what? could also Imagine people cared lies broken trust. Trump would removed well impeached, covid would likely anywhere near big problem is. lack trying part. almost started war Iran potentially North Korea. tried ban LGBTQ people military well obviously paying attention. 24 weeks length charts.  comparative death rate charts compared covid.  keep comparing apples oranges. per capita basis that's 15% US peak back mid July almost 250% US rate today. downward spiral continues. Never big fan politics, reign terror I’v come see every aspect ‘ regular life ‘ affected. still nowhere near .02%. long fucking fall happen.  know others, sick early year, testing forget diseases exist. actually assume covid. went Dr, negative flu strep throat. So, normal things then.... unreasonable assume could possibly 'other' thing? Asia, talk SARS, talking previous SARS. new one new, hence name ""novel coronavirus"". mean, could call every new ""flu-like"" epidemic ""SARS"" right idea does, spreads.

If idea does, infects spreads, idea is. 

It's like going scene crime, looking dead body saying,"" human this"". 

This doctor admitted know did. fact, whistle blow, all. 

He actually discussion colleagues purely speculating. colleague someone chat released conversation.

He got reprimanded something colleague did. never whistle blew. Even did, pure speculation baseless. conversation colleague basically boiled ""I evidence, think human committed crime"".

That helpful whatsoever. Ok, Tyler Durden. Tbf canada agreement china cansino one China fucked canada attain 100% platinum stupidity achievement game ' **Earth2020 : clear retrospective** '

 = disregard safety precautions associated pandemic. 

Player also needs harass spit least 3 NPC's per week ensure maximum side quest achievement awards. guess I'm hard time understanding teachers dont work do? I'm nurse, I'm scared covid too. mean go work? children need go back school. Covid going anywhere. even know hearsay is. normal standard, completely illogical one. Even *in* court dozens exceptions hearsay impossible find truth without allowing some.

edit: realized one exceptions expert testimony, Dr's testimony obviously qualifies as, even Court Dr. Li's testimony would considered valid lol I'm surprised Lancet published Acknowledging truth disgusting. 

It tripod failure. 
1). Trump’s (and MANY officials too) management failures.
2) US population fucking stupid (not wearing masks strong quarantine).
3). Obesity general unhealthiness Americans.

If can’t admit 3rd part large parts due individuals—your honest this.

I’m saying tell surviving family loss BS b/c loved one obese—but truth truth. kind agree. country dysfunctional ever eliminate virus also dysfunctional provide financial assistance.

So might well seesaw reopenings closings vaccine Wuhan spraying AIR massive hoses big disinfecting trucks throughout streets city. saw news. alarming yet government quiet. got us obsessed surface transmission dismissed air transmission. washing hands going stop someone coughing, sneezing, breathing face refused address. supposed coughing elbows. plenty time prepare wasted. like schools public space poor air circulation. chances getting much greater would without people pigheadedly spreading refusing wear masks. That's would need almost completely stop virus assure get later. sacrificed 6 months youth this, done that. clear isn’t going anytime soon, don’t think handle another 6 months this, 12 matter. hope getting majority people understand care this. ads made say “Hey let’s go next summer”. Thanks posting! Looks interesting. feel old? I'll believe they're able keep kids wearing masks entire time classes &amp; hallways right see elephant fly. wish Yeah I’m pretty sure I’ve given Thanksgiving Christmas happening fact kiss cheek pretty often I'd imagine that's slowed now.

Italians Turks never chance haha ....doing thing expecting different results. one create. lived Europe US I’m going back Europe covid done. sure calculate standard living I’ll rather average wage Europe usa. bad means America greatest country earth either. 
My wife American born raised can’t wait leave. people downvoting pointing countries problems, shows real US self hatred think people understand ""mild"" covid cases are. hear mild think ""cold"" especially since coronaviruses cause colds. first encounter covid patient back early days masks line post office. sounded like dying, post office errands. exactly like zombies Walking Dead. live small town know ended hospital couple weeks later barely made alive. big welcome home sign family front yard long ago.

Since I've several times store heard tell-tale rattling wheezing. they're walking around like nothing's ordinary. daughter's teenage friend ""mild"" case that's left reeling. drop main college start community college due complications. We've several friends got hit hard still recovering. people around schools years caught various things went around problems. never people around us getting knocked action months time due ""ordinary viruses"" like flu. 40 yr old friend died two weeks ago. I'm still shock. day ventured store things order medical emergency loudspeaker calling medical personnel come assist. can't go town anymore without passing several ambulances sirens blaring headed toward hospital, normal something ignore explain away.

If anything think people afraid enough. think many people complacent thinking ""I flu last year fine. fine too."" not. fine. normal. We've years flu bad closed schools, still bad this. even close. San Diegan travels LA work. swear something like around time. financially independent since 18, sorry foresight global pandemic. Get testing order get tested want. Also...complete safety never possible. 🤦‍♀️ Spoken like true petty person unable handle slightest sacrifice name collective good country. guys joke rest western world. many reasons people overweight. necessarily something someone control, especially pandemic we’re isolated ever, put stress, etc. 

I feel like people using excuses say “it won’t happen me” person old, disabled, overweight, underlying illness. doesn’t matter. It’s fault didn’t anything deserve die. 

As disabled person, makes sad died covid people would say, oh underlying illness. you’re woman. You’re finding reason see less human doesn’t seem scary you. 

Shame you. Huh? miss one showed persistent **lung damage** ? entire life teaching ahead death comes nation’s parents educators continue struggle safety concerns school reopenings. Washington Post reported that least five teachers died Covid-19 since August. Although known whether contracted coronavirus school, deaths intensified concerns whether campus environments prompt outbreaks even talking about? seen single restaurant takeout. I'm simply talking mathematical equation pay square footage rent. Well see places shit order terms case totals. fact forgot dinner six o'clock, we're still working son finally asks ""are eating dinner?”

That heartbreaking. take better care family. Oh, see :( mean obviously simple. makes big difference six feet appart windy day beach vs 6ft appart ""outside"" enclosed wall something.

But general take away going stuff, outside significantly better inside, air literally recirculated day. talking COVID screenings international travelers US wasting resources considering internal issues Uber sensitive it. read news back September. US officials must read news, didn’t think gonna spread. fucking why? spite? think Americans socially distanced thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years friend buy real estate swampland. masks packed restaurants? think virus even would give life others could live happy. mean? means STOP destruction economy. 

You scared? leave house. scared? Leave house. 

Don’t want die? Don’t leave house. Want chance it? Leave house. 

I going leave house. choice making? Oh ya want cake eat expense world economy. Disgusting! call this... disgusting. 

You gave freedom. gave up. Back original point: would rather dead! weird extreme. rather hold kids back year remote learning? petty tantrum? God. people can't even patient enough wait vaccine. disgrace unity perseverance personal sacrifice ww2 wartime American people. studies persistent symptoms, “long term damage”. massive difference. Like virus, symptoms linger months (as seen studies). mean long term damage. know ANYONE COVID know lot people giving fuck. 77% 97% studies already came out. 

Does make others sub oddly seem think pharmaceutical intervention de fact way go crisis in?

It almost seems though 90% people sub work Big Pharma? come contact someone covid-19, self isolate engore 14 days? test positive virus? Nah brains oppose draconian lockdowns Hmm. That's terrifying. Europe Brazil. Meaning go less 14 days Mexico come US, won’t even guarantee they’ll allowed taking massive risk contracting disease foreign country alone. Quebec?
Edit: nvm see Vancouver, expensive city country. cellphone plan robbery that's option, shop around asap. Feel free try luck America think better here. article link study got space link work. May 8, 2020; Accepted: July 9, 2020; Published: September 10, 2020

Its definitely Fauci's fault.

The lack federal response blame lie squarely. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* thing erase millions expensive health insurance liabilities books.

He’s giving reliable information. That’s always wanted needed matter what. example, entire thread comments mostly focusing “hunker down”, never actually defined article. lot emotional throwing punches, phrase doesn’t specific meaning. 

Does Fauci mean “shelter place”, “stay home”, “lockdown”, “stay focused”?  *shrug*.  Rorschach test time! Oh, yes, course. correct. option hold kids back year. virus NEVER going away. need live it.  suggestions us trust fund dip into? Keep it. I’ve dropped ~40 lbs since late March. 30 BMI still ~25 lbs get below/stay 200 first time since college.

Survival transplant varies lot, luck also depends a) healthy beforehand; b) get transplant; c) age d) adherence medical regimen. 

For example, cystic fibrosis patients tend way better lung transplants rest population us young get underlying complications; plus we're already used complicated medical regimen problem sticking it. 

On hand, older patients with, say, COPD tend problems well (eg. Hypertension, kidney disease) many never hospital prior transplant. huge learning curve them. 

Different transplant centres different outcomes too. way better survival rates (eg. UCLA) others. Also, past ten years transplant centres gotten much better fighting rejection, obviously #1 problem comes lung transplantation. 

TL;DR: Lung transplants ideal, super successful patients. past 10 years prognosis actually improved quite bit. expected dip reporting long holiday weekend. That’s look moving average. welcome. No, didn't. Wow dude never thought getting job really solved problems risk hospitalization death really starts increase age 50. many teachers category? many subs? many lunch ladies &amp; bus drivers?

I think schools likely older average age adult workers many areas industry. Biden would've LIE PUBLIC fucking hoax make executive order requiring masks. single shred leadership issue could've saved countless lives.  1) downvoted ?
2) downvoted means people disagree me. disagree 90% messsges sub, surprised people disagree well. Every sub echo chamber, Dont let fooled upvote.
3) know I'm right way since discuss content attacked personally Serious question: many thousands people flew Wuhan daily basis announced? 

2,000? 5,000? 10,000?  go?  That's irony, media ready accusations China cover things happening home, like fort detrick vaping cases example. parents paid college education What? Thats complicated way explain inverse squarw law ever, 100% 👌 one family getting together. do, get it. asked That's liberalism 🤦‍♂️

PS: y'all know lobby US politicians everyone else? China literally ran country Trump (fuck Trump btw). That's hate charge. can't want like every adminstration (Blue Red team!) think masks lower initial viral dose causes infection. thought that's correlated less severity illness. least ability qualify loan hit nail head. bums out.

Interesting way saying ""It may kill me, and/or family."" point whether union good bad always entirely them. conversation started pointing standard living matters. got upset wealth disparity.

Get job pay journalism. Learn something new every day. It'll keep young. 👍 worth risk death/lifelong consequences family then, well, guess. Man, I'm glad I'm related you. paper someone wants read authors saying opposed whats cherry picked here. likely. #sorrymyass Absolutely ridiculous. situation country slowly improving throughout month May, today improving since beginning August. regional terms, multiple major populous areas long periods time day better last. New York New Jersey saw massive improvements April May never even slightest uptick since. Florida, Texas, Arizona, California (the main drivers horrible July surge) seen many weeks relatively uninterrupted improvement. 

And that's talking metrics themselves. Depending define improvement, we've also made huge strides toward effective treatments safe effective vaccine throughout entire time. We've pretty much 6 months straight things becoming less less ""grim"". There's also fact we've culturally slowly become increasingly compliant fighting thing. never even saw mask June.

I cannot wait get downvoted calling blatant factless bullshit. dumb, know consequences, don’t care Trump wins we're dead. altogether surprising sub-national entities people countries. Maharashtra's population somewhere 120 130 million. That's slightly less Russia, overtake Russia cases, entirely ordinary. biggest state India - Uttar Pradesh - 220 million people would fifth populous world country, behind China, rest India, USA Indonesia. state also poorer worse socioeconomic stats India's average. peaked yet presumably reason seen richer countries - cities globally connected get hit first, Maharashtra boosted Mumbai. São Paulo state, compare Indian states, still 40 million people size Poland Spain. Everyone coronavirus lol..pains say Seems like every day Florida still deaths California, state twice size/population.

Crazy. Cooking food requires effort time. get groceries, put everything away, make sure kitchen clean functional, spend 20-60 minutes actually preparing food followed cleaning. people can’t bothered anything throw something microwave minutes. We’re nation lazy idiots. makes sense. People actively want spread America. quit working hotels hearing months people simply expect herd immunity among many excuses. ""Its bad"" ""you can't trust cdc"" ""nothing going stop anyway"" ""normal life keep going matrer cost"" ""its bad flu vaccine"" etc. many people refuse wear mask actively aggressive it. Many times almost physical confrontation simply asking ""please remember wear mask"" even opinion, quite literally law wear mak public. drove shuttle transport guests would wear mask get on, take breathe me. would yell asked sit behind you. would literally sit right behind drivers seat. year ago people would want space. font desk people remove mask walk around plastic barrier talk. intentionally get close can. almost got written backing maintain least 6 feet guest kept trying face. One said guest bragged COVID ""wasn't bad"" refused wear mask observe social distancing since ""clear travel longer infectious"".     Tl:dr Americans actively intentionally spreading COVID That's still wrong well. keep repeating things easily disproven reading page? Read note. 60% submitted within first 10 days. Oh yeah sucked boobs checked trans lady friend mine always crotch flagged that's 100% worse common meme trans folk. that's Florida Florida.  --Not compliment. virus never go away bother? literally spewed exact bullshit last time I'm sure start finding new line bullshit spew week. Then...we dont know motives political not, we? Ok dates believe trump knew everything? Vs public
Edit: announced December 31 2019 I'm still waiting. killing germs, also giving skin cancer definitely hear people talking rights echoing lot stuff thats going US, like exemption card. broadly speaking, agree you, higher compliance least feels like lunatics small minority. sound like got stick ass, may close true considering much fiber must eat. Yes. literally sometimes adjusts down. case adjustments made second week, using recent week. Don’t believe me? Let’s check next week continue. then, wasted enough time. RemindMe! 1 week real problem people look industries vacuum. canal special interests trying make pharmaceuticals profitable possible? Absolutely. they’re drop bucket compared interests lobbying functioning economy. 

Under normal circumstances, outsized power one regular people progressives give shit Big Pharma’s deleterious effects working people’s lives. Right now? They’ll fight tooth nail get back stock warehouses. Stop thinking critically, that's bannable offense subreddit. dare criticize Fauci!!!!! feel like people simply wore masks crazy parties, wouldn’t case. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* (to guitar rhythm) Keep good work concerned new cases per million we’re talking beating moving forward.

Yes, US way worse preceding months, France Spain comfortably beating US terms new cases per million population. Funny one person blames China containing this. Why? headline makes seem like COVID19 imparts DESIRE eat restaurant. 


Methinks got casualty reversed. spread virus rather containing it. Based. average person really give shit called grandma killer redditor average person probably even know anyone got seriously sick covid especially they're young. people ready move lives, whining reddit going stop lol Families middle class **withstand month without income** fair well

Middle class mean think means. clear read linked. going way ignore T-cell mediated herd immunity achieved Sweden, NYC, elsewhere. expect much someone deletes comments disagree with. Theoretically, mostly asymptomatic right? people don’t care. still acting like march? Year-old, low-karma account... probably troll. hard?

You answered question already. huge outbreak refugees, agents, both? FHM’s biggest mistake wasn’t “no shutdown” “no mask mandates”. firmly believe hadn’t made much difference. preparation (why process acquiring tests ramping testing early? stockpiles PPE?) trusted elderly care would quick adopt crisis. 

With decades cuts funding, staff elderly care never going able handle even smallest adjustments, handling 10-20% sick without rest run facilities worsen spread, quickly set isolated facilities patients returning hospitals (instead move right back facility infected). complete disaster. 

I argue FHM failed convince politicians public gravity threat. may done could it’s political side (by extension public) failed fund it, choosing short sighted tax cuts preparedness. I’m sure endless reports written subject years come. fundamentally: mistakes *mostly*, opinion political, already made long time past, time pandemic hit.

It’s important remember others said FHM literally “public health authority” “center disease control”. weigh things like domestic violence, mental health, kids missing school etc give things quite significant weight equation.

Also, Nordic countries aren’t different response policy. It’s picture fabricated media. four week shutdown economy Norway Denmark isn’t different happened Sweden. fail see one call “experiment” straight face. It’s exact plan every country initially. shift total lockdown countries experiment, anything. put like that? Fair enough :) reluctance invest phage treatment (amongst reasons) due inability copyright them. think they’ll become increasingly important fight antibiotics resistance bacteria.
And I’m still surprised researching use endemic cronoviruses trigger immune response novel ‘thing’ maybe time us get interested making health care available all. living wage. OK, things *actually are* fine am? Ive outdoor activities like hiking, eating out, hanging people park great mental health. I'm much better back April/June fucking going back works me. sure problems. Sorry see next week much adjusting left done. Talk then. think already reports people getting reinfected, remember correctly I'm sure got 1.3% overall breakdown age group, weighted cohort. give detailed analysis footnote modeling basis, uses statistical analysis mortalities Hubei/Wuhan age initial outset pandemic. key flaw approach physicians public health experts know improved treatment protocols even stringent masking protections mandated, fatalities IFR fallen since spring. Learn English, Chang. People taking mask. feel problem end sight, go years, might well give fate, ive even seen liberal friends disengaging waiting home 6 months. No. death counts weighted account incomplete data. However, data recent week(s) still likely incomplete.

It literally says weighting make incomplete recent weeks sentence. 🤦‍♂️ opposed conservative science “God it”...idiot. Comments like make glad left country 10 years ago. literally friends tell me: ""Its great time travel right now! Super cheap!"" think understand cause effect. also think know social distancing masks work drop cases, after-all one who's saying based ""garbage"" everything done point unnecessary.

So let's get back root original post, said everyone hunkered wore masks good reopening right? explain rallies/protests masks social distancing? explain case numbers/deaths places like florida, tennessee, etc take seriously? Would contend people states freely travel NY, easily skirt quarantine requirements?

I stand said, everyone followed guidelines, we're still paying even though did. I'm really sorry happened. Sometimes bad luck- even careful.

I think simple rules in-person gatherings help people stay healthy:

* Keep guest list small
* Hold gatherings outdoors
* Maintain 6ft+ distance
* hold activities physical contact
* Avoid sharing food/utensils dish
* Mask getting close going inside bathroom
* Wash hands/sanitize

You even reduce risk choosing guests carefully. choose interact group working remotely generally staying tight household otherwise- odds anyone first place low. Coupled precautions risk managed. new cases affecting younger people they're less likely die get sick enough hospitalized Based fuck Poor lad Maybe get first wave crowing situation. Correct. weight incomplete figures compensate that. say themselves. right. usually adjust significantly second week, slightly following weeks. Although sometimes adjust weighting based bad estimates exact thing here. Remove pandemic response team, pandemic happens response bad. Blame CDC government agencies responding well. people hope continued mistrust Nordic countries, best case eternal damnation Sweden Swedes. equivalency false? Damn show’s foreshadowing wild see link two... massive penalty must made clear ahead time. $36,500 hole perhaps year's delay getting degree another school, that's gonna leave mark.

(OTOH could work minimum wage job full-time pay debt 12 months, 4 summer months next year plus part-time remained students). love armchair infectious doctors downplaying actual expert saying. notice vast majority doctors health care officials agree Fauci, right? like climate change denier flat earther. Ya sound dumb. lol what?

Its abundantly clear give crap facts. don’t understand, new cases down. needs jailed permitting bike rally. threat National Security. respect yeah you’re right, I’m friend put way. president told everyone tomorrow breathe, third population would drop dead asphyxiation. 25% idiots believe need gun protect themself...so worried protection, hard put fucking mask? gotta room happens, room happens. even fit eat point.  Bs forget, stupidity. Yep. dad isn’t abiding he’s Covid positive trying go stores restaurants week getting test longer fever. I’m edge reporting police. told may god mercy soul know won’t go out. yeah thats lost popular vote like 100 million americans didnt vote Calm down, pandemic yet. Sweden long-term strategy expected bit cases initially. We've done beautiful job, marvelous job like Europeans. 🤪 may friends acquaintances Sweden wear masks. asked them, never problem wearing masks. one stares treat differently wearing masks. Huge part lack information misinformation, plain sad disappointing day age...  

People preach ""my body rights"" comprehend wearing mask mostly *other people*. think them. Wow, European thought loss nightmare over, realize dividing country even further, lead to? sounds really scary. Honestly buying food Chinese Mexican places past months take things seriously. buddy. Biden perfection incarnate make Trump. absolutely absurd even pretend same. need take beat think *rationally* emotionally Covid-19 party course Nebraska largely rural land area (about 99%), per last census 73% population lives urban areas. let ""wash over"" country, right? hire ""expert"" even specialist promote ""going herd.""

edit: case misunderstood, IF, hypothetically, virus leader hates country, certainly would. means support trump, ignorant doesn’t think speaks. would love independent win would never happen OP doesn’t know they’re talking about. cannot see naked all.  plans today. time want put shredder that's choice hear variations story time internet real life. question this: New York deaths spike April everyone getting across world Oct-Feb?

Can rationalize testimony USA death curves?

It’s question ask family members neighbors certain it. answer outdoor dining takeout. cold people dress warm restaurant add kerosene outdoor heaters something like that. understand said it, huge mistake. better way spread misinformation imo Isnt history interesting? futuristic, realistic, much learn it, yet dont. things expecting different results. “Sorry, gotta. Fuck single alone. gotta tough out.”

would rather die? Yup need start living this. I’m spending Christmas home alone. I’ll get tested see family. Six months don’t effective treatment keep people ICU hospital? Come on. People going keep stay home stuff. impacts last longer pandemic. Don’t eat you’re worried ‘rona. That’s article said all.  article said teachers dying also schools opening apparent relation yet.

Edit: say isn’t reason concern. However, returning teach front class students everyone wears mask, social distances, classrooms likely barriers teachers students, temperatures taken, hands sanitized... many professions managing stay safe working reasonable proximity others. reason think teachers cant same. People dying it’s horrible, articles title implies correlation exist yet. fighting covid-19 disinformation damaging discouraged regardless intention. ""cake day"" literal post discussing real life birthday? jam 1 quart bag liquor bottles 3.5 oz. usually save space soap, toothpaste, etc., it'll still hold good bit booze it. Even caused 26,000 cases still shame. modern society dead set destroying middle class? true long term cost saving measure.

its like car.. yes gets point b... time cost maintenance fuel goes up. point.. get thing newer. 

i mean hit 1 half year saving fuel new car 2016. compare old one. want know much return spending wasted fuel old one. nearly 2k

so saving fuel goes cost price car. don’t recall learning get scientific information news articles online middle school pal government couldn’t give two shits us. left us hanging dry. 

Except Bernie Sanders. He’s fighting born. Definitely sounds like might patient zero infected Chinese tourists. know might caught it? eat exotic animals?  UBI need permanent.

If Republicans maintaining status quo order stability, nothing stable temporarily using government's coffers, continually fill taxes, allow stability providing short term solution: quarantine survival services.

UBI arguably *be* conservative solution long temporary used provide temporary stability.

We chosen this. care lol Absolutely. Italy definitely increasing, though fast. Yeah, I'm mad assholes pretend exemption cards exposed noses, too, still case infants wear masks even one assholes says so. Choose battles. :) dont know take away title. Complete safety possible anything even pre pandemic. Nobody say absolute certainty hundreds millions restaurant patrons year one get carjacked way restaurant, allergic reaction restaurant, choke restaurant. 

People talking risk mitigation reducing unnecessary risks. expecting complete safety anything life, living fairy tale. “In study 314 adults tested COVID-19, CDC found adults tested positive coronavirus twice likely tested negative gone restaurant getting sick.  
“Findings case-control investigation symptomatic outpatients 11 U.S. health care facilities found close contact persons known COVID-19 going locations offer on-site eating drinking options associated COVID-19 positivity,” CDC said.” Stories like seem like red herrings.

The issue overewhelming capacity healthcare system death rate.

The system ample capacity. death rate everybody near zero, anybody normal health 65 chance dying exceedingly remote. 

It’s hard understand exactly point trying make statements like this. Wuhan Tianhe International capital People's Republic China. opened 15 April 1995, replacing old Hankou Wangjiadun Airport Nanhu Airport major airport Wuhan. The airport located Wuhan's suburban [Huangpi around 26 km (16 mi) to north Wuhan city center.

It busiest airport central China geographically located centre China's airline route network. airport served 20,772,000 passengers 2016, making the [14th passenger traffic China. $1,200 stimulus check got put every minimum wage full time worker country rate $15/hr month. 

Also, plenty people want continue work, yes, also people want option protect loved ones staying home. able to.

We use starvation leverage force essential workers, “the heroes” workforce, work. immoral. People freedom say “no” work feel health danger. 

It disproportionately poor face killing family wealthy working home.

What dystopia live Yet... infections deaths get low levels, becomes really difficult justify keeping businesses schools closed telling people never see friends families without masks. Getting virus control inevitably means opening things back up, means spike infections. What’s happening Europe basically best case scenario West — bought everyone months it’s coming back. ""College"" basically means high school. using mix soil yard, leaf dog waste compost mixed together. actually really good fertilizer. basically live swamp pretty rich soil. May apply you. Right? government isn’t gonna anything let’s get back shall we!? I’m staying home keeping kids home husband works home. many people that’s tangible. Stay home starve, bigot! never reopen anything vaccine 2025! /s 

This always ridiculous notion working class people. idea $1200 check unemployment you’re lucky keep life falling apart hilarious. mention many jobs people unemployment gone. hey, Congress fucked break president doesn’t legal authority anything due federalism tbh despite people internet like believe. population Italy France fairly similar. Italy 60.36 million people. France 66.99 million people. Italy lot better France right comes new cases per day. date developed Covid-like symptoms. Fatigue, difficulty breathing, coughing, fever, muscle soreness. waited four days conditions improve. amazing insurance got see doctor tested 5th day. symptoms went away 7th day. got results back 9th day came back negative. think safe still go date? thought article talking junior high colleges?

Professors instructors aren’t happy things set either. thought fairly known Americans can’t afford protest walk away work, especially considering little educators paid. 

Having meeting times specifically international students already mentioned, know it’s major issue universities. something talked mine. experience person lessons necessary labs might translate well online format. 

It could depend individual universities handling classes, whenever registering classes see courses online person classes. COVID could see online mix face face online choose wanted. 

I’m TA person online labs, even still required office hours. host online requested person students. would check isn’t professor skipping office hours.

Professors instructors understand hard everyone considering professor sees lot students still respecting boundaries one one interactions. experience isn’t respected students current setting everyone edge. remote learning becomes normalized. public going discover technology allows fraction teachers accomplish thing. they’ll need help back end management grades paperwork.  

Tens thousands teachers job. officials know terrified public large finally catches wind notion schools cost half less. stress important old way learning is. “Everyone hunker months ALLLLL OVER”

Everyone hunkers down: “is over?”

“Ok so....,just wear mask it’ll ALLL OVER” 

Everyone wears masks: “is over?”

“Everyone hunker down.....” This.

I live Japan houses prefabricated insulation. use bubble wrap huge windows sliding glass doors leave summer winter both. sun curtains always drawn anyway. Let light in, heat/cold out. 100%. gym keeps emailing saying theyre cleaning surfaces stuff. appreciate effort nothing me. Ive always assumed surfaces gym petri dishes anyway. Tell youve done something air filtration circulation. Luckily live weather sucks. hope don’t shut every business it. might go somewhere, stuck inside six months might suicidal April. Better Peeps. I'll let little trick employer does: 1000-grit sandpaper indistinguishable 1-ply industrial toilet paper. Even ur boi trump doesn’t think that’s true. Third person hurting heart here. really hard trying hold on. supposed see August. distance US EU never felt big now.

Oh, God, I've felt like shit months now. 16 teachers NYC already tested positive it’s third day back staff. Yeah, it’s going wreck. Wait child dies (not hoping reality) see happens. coronavirus outbreak seen Beijing reframing project accommodate pandemic-friendly apartments residents “live style lockdowns”, Sun says.  Guallart Architects competition draft new plans city’s living quarters held Spain lockdown, says working restrictions influenced design “completely”. result blocks flats large balconies “to allow access outdoors huge communal work areas allow social distancing”, newspaper reports.  project championed President Xi “a new standard post-COVID era”.

So actually designed someone West, China likes idea.

I understand people freak see 'China + covid' headline. Even perfect solution exist, guys would never anyway. Look guys handled ""lockdown"". heck thinking. western countries lockdowns kill economy? never unified lockdown. States giving shit, opening quickly caving first petty complaint, churches, tons antimask/anti-science, parties, Sturgis like wtf talking about? I'll say again. never unified lockdown; half-assed best. that's generous. what? cases world. guys denouncing lockdowns giving poor attempt like hating sport purposefully playing like trash quiting within half day. joke. thought lemming fiscal conservative types... Medicare looming horizon whole crisis give good argument Republican opposition lose say see can't Medicare paying money covid treatments people article makes good point newest point ""virus-deniers"" bringing up...that infected people die virus, due underlying condition. us something. Coronavirus showing attack practically part body, one sit smugly back say safe. Unfortunately, doubters remain unconvinced late. ""Why suffer?"" virus hit *buh duh tis* better nothing definitely enough keep people safe think keeps them. catches roughly ~20% infections. Maybe little less, becase people 50% asymptomatics presymptomatic 40% symptoms fever (100-50)*.4=20%.  government sent everyone $1000 box food could entire country stay gone two weeks try stop F-ing virus?

No, people want go party. grasp seriousness virus trust scientists. silly, that's white supremacists! Really makes think ""unhygienic"" crowded places are. many times gotten sick concert bar? Eating dining experience rather food itself. personally pay sit restaurant prices food I'll eat home. opinion continue believe fake virus forever enslaved say goodbye freedom comply contact tracing? hahahaha, yeah that's shit disagree. probably right solution. that's happened March, that's main issue here.

We told people would two weeks, went on, disorganized myopic, six months, starving gig economy workers livelihoods without hope compensation shuttering hundreds small business good. Even nurse friends laid repeatedly thanks hospitals spending much money making room COVID patients never came. going tell people take another two weeks lives off? reason believe us time?

Even countries locked super hard lockdown several weeks. two week ""let's kill good"" logic sounds nice theory, world actually meant two weeks that's it? person cautious staying home much possible, clearly see around 70% people done whole thing. allow 100% capacity hasten process infection we're going reach number infected either way. main subs people see absolutely one sided view agenda though. Yes diverse however can’t argue reddit whole almost entirely one side political spectrum. admins even sanctioned hate speech majorty (aka white people). get banned Trumps side news subs. 

This entire place virtue signaling 101. highest posts sub (the main covid sub) great lockdowns masks everyone stay home, play video games fake emotion anywhere socializing. knew almost everything February least form widespread rumors doctors China. totally confirmed, would really really worth confirming.

But nah, let's pretend get back normal soon reason wish magic vaccine happen. choosing lay groundwork system contain virus instead wasting time way go. woods go! Learn lessons life friends like lord flies!  Yes, dummy. Reach funny conclusion based entirely pathetic inability even understand dynamics situation.

It's ok, vermin. frustrations vented. Let adults continue talking now, ok ?   discrepancy reporting discussed many times that's true. remember RKI saying follow directions comes count deaths.

The actual reason German health system fucking huge clusters happening abroad (40% detected cases last week got infected abroad). developed contract tracing strategy focus looking possible clusters rather specific contacts (e.g. asking went gym office vs. with).

The cultural differences mostly lives whom, multigenerational houses common, visiting family every day. discussed Dr. Drosten Charité podcast NDR. “But many tests! That’s numbers higher. Cases don’t matter!” - Trump

“Look bad France tests” - Trump Virgin Thanks, appreciate it. Soon? We've riding upward climb since day 1. clarify, lockdown lifted right? that's true, contradict I'm saying effectiveness lockdowns compared US civilized western countries? love comments people getting mad quarantine😂 fauci isn’t corrupt making money quarantining, people need get it, socialize go eat, hot zones everything open movie theaters bars, people need understand maybe good thing go around bunch randoms grocery store can’t around friends? 

That makes zero sense. don’t think you’re listening. 

Covid-19 DIRECTLY related SARS. Covid-19 is, lack better words, second installment SARS. 

Meaning, want estimate immunity, look SARS, common cold. common cold strains coronaviruses, yes, doesn’t mean closely related COVID-19 SARS family got kicked police, passengers still flight happy started show hostility towards airline, flight got cancelled. fail Phase 3s, think safely conclude God real hates us. Masks don’t crap give body problems fake virus Vaccines usually take 10 15 years. I'm aware another political ""vaccine race"" history. 

Would trust Trump taxes....?? I'm saying definitely going bad vaccine... health skepticism criticism might called for.

Specially since US allow pharmaceutical companies held liable Calm drama queen. working whole pandemic. like lot people. didn’t get Covid. Chill out. US developed nations enough resources support people lose jobs steps take ensure public health.

Being concerned global pandemic health crisis mean care economy. Like said, borders open would heart beat. right options cell service internet connect. I. turned tvs classrooms rest day spent watching it/taking in. know anyone traumatized though. mean? US right. That's problem. trump banned travel China called xenophobic racist. Per capita infections. Management job loss prevention housing loss prevention. live world governments struggle issues described agree virus deadly warrant protection it, guess media pretty clever fooled nearly entire planet. oh good god France almost 10k cases today. That's equivalent almost 50k US. US averaging 33k last week. France worse per capita. don’t like wearing mask all. suck. guess what? wearing one could possibly save someone getting sick. It’s small inconvenience. People need stop fucking selfish think people once. making racist statements right back good? making bad them. Copying shitty behaivor make good person. makes shitty well. God ignorance self-centered thinking. true number acutal covid-19 cases 10 times higher confirmed number cases becuase many people asymptomatic?  math. Death cures bills. long-term COVID-related disability, assuming must claim SSI SSDI wipe future funding currently refuse acknowledge month **everyone** staying home would actually enable us get back work, pay bills, resume lives. people *will* get sick, *will* long-term consequences, *will* die. I'm really tired ""bills pay"" empty rationale ignoring pandemic. plan pay bills stricken COVID-19?

We've *all* got bills pay. share *equal* interest alive. agree sacrifice month order get things back pre-pandemic, it'll happen. hand, there's consistently 40-60% country refusing *know* needs done, shit-show go indefinitely.

Cue downvotes. Similar way schools deep clean every night kids go home. teachers kids parents populous. Great pandemic planning Trump. lot studies supporting Vitamin decreasing severity infections likelihood transmission. almost certain Vitamin plays role (how much could debate). They've thought since April comparing outbreaks across Europe. new theory. Never mind, clearly want argue 🙄 nice day/evening. kids love like own. yeah, problem messaging. 11 year old diagnosed mental health issues walking around weight world shoulders MIGHT catch virus school, MIGHT totally fine, MIGHT pass onto great grandparents MIGHT get sick... get told fault.

Even God supports CHOSEN people. system rigged! :-) mandatory hallways buses classrooms. hilarious attempt spread misinformation u/burtzev. always want give people benefit doubt, they're spreading misinformation ignorance rather malice, anyone doubt country he's from? real motivation agenda benefits lies? victim Anglosphere disinformation campaign active accomplice? haaaaaaate lot unis blow millions football head coach salaries, turn around cry enough money. Uh went logic (and should) wouldn’t locked down. I’ve heard theory seasonal flu didn’t get chance migrate southern hemisphere year. usually travels south people traveling northern hemisphere southern, seeds outbreaks southern hemisphere. year, flu transmission already reduced international travel drastically reduced, less opportunity flu take hold southern hemisphere. There’s chance similar situation play reverse going northern winter.   Let’s real, that’s going stop high schoolers running amok around continuing LARP noble scientists unveiling grand conspiracy. I'm at. Feeling frustrated doomed around us got corona woman coughing behind gym late February. sick May 100% june. I'm cancelled membership take walks now. worth it. point optimism going shield reality. anything going cloud perspective, increases chances putting risk. wondering group getting hit worse Covid - haredis secular Israelis. one hand, yes, true haredis Israel's version US far-right, large families. also means average age lower, dying lower case fatality rate. could also Arabs dying disproportional numbers like blacks Hispanics US. It'd interesting see demographic breakdown. That's really good point. Digging CDC data gives clues. provide # reported tests positivity rate... number tests bit lower 2020 compared previous years much, positivity rate really drops cliff weeks 12 13.

[Ex: - last column, summer-ish weeks 20's 7k-10k reported tests per week positivity rates 2-3%.

Compared - time span shows 5k-8k reported tests per week positivity rates *0.2-0.4%*!

This suggests 90% drop-off flu spread legitimate simply effect fewer doctor visits.

The piece data make sense [mortality Pretty much every year reported influenza deaths dropping triple digits double double single parts annual cycle, including 2020. get confirmed deaths fraction estimated annual flu deaths. Still, seems weird case data (which also fractional, perhaps even so) shows clear obvious signs drop-off around weeks 12 13 persisting now, mortality data signal all. Holy shit. Making race? even American? country founded decades redlining, systemic oppression minorities, gentrification, intentional roadblocks generational wealth.

Other civilized western nations social safety nets. simple that. one, too, 80's-era GOP legislators decided deserve robust welfare state.

Seriously, please open history book. Deflection ain't cute. Oh FFS joke. Time get fuck sub. See post  Senior high school, watched second plane hit. Three uncles worked tower. miracle, none various reasons happened. Still grips us. question decrease liklihood flu vaccine good year. many samples make good vaccine? IDK wife used physician VA hospital. don’t need discouragement. legal exemptions.  counties do.  follow laws around exemptions we’re ok. catastrophic winter going happen regardless ""hunker down"" obviously means spending time public places absolutely necessary.

The fact assume means ""don't work"" absurd. true cross-border collaboration Scientists say family viruses. Literally. Coronavirus. fact SARS also Coronavirus make Coronavirus. Major logic failure there. many spectators Tour De France wear masks. You’ll see people start finish. prepping couple months now... GREAT. Mainly I’m going guess median age posters sub ... wait ... 18.8

Huh, lot 18-year-olds worried families, elderly parents, kids going back middle school. Wild. ""affording."" choosing spend money delivery expense something else, like quality food.

Rather pick fight person, person clearly talking people money can't bothered safe pickup eat home. can't answer would worded title article?


Because that's obvious thing I'm seeing. thing allows say whatever want also grants none saying changes anything? feel like reasonable tell US citizen stay home week. Two weeks max. tell stay home fall winter fucking absurd reeks privilege.

Granted, that’s really Fauci saying that’s it’s interpreted. almost 1k.deaths day since mid July, time overall cases began plummet hospitalizations began decline. really add logically.  Lmfao, ""d**mer"" apparently banned word sub. Hits bit close home guess. bit surprised Israel really. country that's normally prepared emergencies, botch one. New cases still climbing, death rate 100 per million, puts Israel among higher numbers Asia.  acting like US collectively lockdown. Lol joke. guys never one, like actually Civilized western countries.

Truly. _were_ civilized would able handle better.

The US continue perpetual world shit things dry up. hotdog long lag infections deaths. lag deaths reporting. probably reasonable calculate undercount based today's deaths today's cases.

Florida Covid Action may data reporting delays such. France various countries across world seeing large numbers. fault leaders? need medical attention even positive. Quarantine log symptoms. symptoms progress can't breathe chest pain seek medical attention. Also 80% eventually get vaccine 20% screw everything make vaccine worthless. It’s evolving backwards someone who’s roommate arriving today France attending University soon gets concerned. Huh? responding OP, pointing white collar workers might getting paid stay home, blue collar workers (essential otherwise) forgo wages do.  


Also, work home still take massive pay cut. I'm 30% foreseeable. alone answer one said thread people idiots.  Head sand sounds like ostrich, either way republican controlled government Florida done worst job anything prevent spread.

Black Plague lasted longer  get sick others coronaviruses get colds? You’d supposed well Turks adapted coronavirus situation, also helps government mandate wear masks times people constantly warn/scold someone isn’t wearing one. aren’t great social distancing otherwise, take virus fairly seriously. tell us end *until* 2023? answer complete shutdown dining rooms, government giving loans businesses help recover lost revenue. saw went first time. loans meant small businesses went millionaires instead.

Immune response strong (and encouraging), immune response limited, reinfections happen.... happen.... Kids can't catch spread it, yes get infected actually contagious adults, masks help, masks make worse..... Confusing.

Seems like still know much it.... media trying direct narrative.... true India. country, India seriously reporting deaths. example - local authority town saying 300 deaths bcuz covid 19. mortuary officials saying deaths 1000. list names died covid19. hell lotta scary India people idea it.   Even buy food isn’t nutritious financial reasons, still limit portion sizes. cereal healthy fruits vegetables? No. still maintain healthy weight eating nothing cereal. Calories in, calories matters weight, even isn’t ideal nutrition. Man, India making strong push #1 spot. Oh please. I'm Manhattan. Wear mask wash hands. touch face. stop bitching. Sorry.  scientist (in viral immunology) faith information get community. get downvoted regular basis going “immunity protective permanent” hive mind.  getting death rate? sorry hear it, France. Hope get control soon. Overweight people U.S.  adults aged 20 obesity: 39.8% adults aged 20 overweight, including obesity: 71.6% number people asthma continues grow.

Hand sanitizer. UV light systems sold *super* sketchy effectiveness &amp; safety. Forget gimmicks, know hand sanitizer works blind you. know downvoted. People never read past headlines. Funny think got nothing better say call names, yet suggesting I'm child. Haha. 

If actually want argue this, come back tell rationale CDC saying people neither buy, wear masks. 

If actually believe everything god Fauci says without reading lines maybe stick getting info Youtube.  Yeah ... think Murphy great job generally virus handling whole attitude schools really throws off.  First demanding every school open changed choose Remote long detailed dates plans return. Good thing get far testing labs. know US denied international investigation. Genuinely curious, why?  Yep! seasonal flu Last thing need flying 20+ hours sitting around conveyor belt 30 min waiting bag appear. fucking kidding indoor dining allowed you? still close eatery you’re shooting foot. many teaching person? 28 year old teaching remotely?

EDIT: downvote brigade? Asked legitimate question. tried love train. really did. bad, affordable, comfortable, debris track got train, caught fire, stranded 2 hours put out.

Birthday birthday post lol... Reddit weird times far know, matters initial infection. want exposed high dose. already sick, know additional exposure matters, since probably much virus inside replicating picking externally.

Soccer fans fight start riots opposite fan base calling Wankers. see. gives shit? mean deserved die. heat, West Coast ton falling ash everywhere. They're crazy still desire eat time like this. hate Desantis. I’m tired people saying people Florida idiots family/friends extremely safe careful Mid November, thanksgiving, later fall 

So many ways say it. many ways actually relating school yet said “after election”. Yeah, suspicious all. bet lot Frenchies make joke. Also lol whoever downvoted rather innocuous post X) settles it, close em back till virus eradicated. walked drove themselves? didn’t necessarily need encountered anyone. Western culture are. follow Eastern Asian age reckoning? don’t pay though, pay 20% less there’s server tip another $5-20 less depending would ordered drink. It’s significantly less expensive get take out. commonly circulating human Coronaviruses get year two. So, even possible reach herd immunity going circulating among various mammal populations infecting non-immune humans? guess anti-vaxxers going get sick. mean... yes? many people pay tuition physical cash? else get butter-dipped bacon-wrapped deep-fried jalapeno poppers side endless onion rings bottomless Coke refills Sunday church? careful talking herd immunity good .. need  asap thought COVID-19 hospital (I didn't) sealed room brought gigantic, loud HEPA filter filtered entire air supply room something like twice per minute, maybe more. huge.

They never bothered sanitizing cleaning anything. Except IV line seals flushing them.

It spreads air. thought knew now. clean dinner table nice, magically filtering air supply. political talk. places sort thing. rules sidebar. true, there’s also element large-scale ignorance.

I agree eat much cheap takeaway food. it’s also entirely possible diet nothing McDonald’s still keep healthy weight. Big Mac meal 1080 calories, including fries soda. egg McMuffin meal, including hashbrowns coffee, 440 calories. that’s eat every day, consume 1520 calories. means sedentary women maintain weight eat two meals McDonald’s every day. active person, taller person, adult men throw extra meal snack still maintain weight.

We ignorant nutrition portions, blame type foods we’re eating that. bad didn’t ban tiktokking it...*too bad* ... hate give actual solution,

I'm really really unclear hell advice would good for.

Space heaters *way* expensive run furnaces, electric worst way heat space. waste $60, gonna colder winter pay (why?! god would this). Even slightly cheaper, veggies gonna grow freezing cold? living bedroom too? Also, frozen pipes gonna cost fortune stop heating house.

Vegetables take shitload dirt space. I've experimenting upside-down veggie growing; single tomato plant takes minimum five gallon bucket dirt. tried growing cherry tomatoes one gallon containers, got ten tomatoes per plant. using enough dirt, get fruit speak waste time, effort, water &amp; electric. project anyone small house could undertake, let alone someone renting room. mention, pretty hard limit number plants indoors moisture becomes issue, walls ceiling start mold. really need significant prep grow op, including special paint special insulation special ventilation. *not* fucking *cheap*. Growing outside free dirt free sun containers cheap.

Also idea much insulate walls?? even recommended unless walls literally uninsulated; best insulation bang buck attic (both monetarily losing heat). That's cheap either (at least terms penny-pinching suggesting living dried beans), least look around see state/country subsidizes you. *That* one might pay back within couple years *if* previously minimal insulation, since labor costs cheap since access attic since, again, place likely losing heat. probably gonna make back money blow siding removed replaced extra wall insulation, least within next years.

Literally good advice get dried beans. even then, gonna cook eat beans, wasting money. Although practical tips here: cook beans lot salt couple bay leaves, they'll better flavor. also make large batch, freeze 15oz time Ziplock bags, makes convenient use ten hour prep time use beans. Oh man, camera angles ground collapse happened really freaked out. dust washed everything everyone running. bodies falling sky. really young though paper remember it, inherited dad's elephant-like longterm memory. atypical. Short-term wise I'm like goldfish though. whole subreddit full crazy people. Holy s*** people nuts.  Well, Dr. Wenliang want alert friends, public. actually urged friends keep secret got leaked. actual chat (this circulate information outside group, tell family loved ones take precautions.

It true first know virus, directly involved issue (he ophthalmologist). others kept information internal matter. Well, Dr. Li tried keep internal message first alert Chinese public whole world.

He accidental hero hero nevertheless. acts like every coronavirus know of.

So we’ll able reinfected roughly 1-2 years? That’s exactly good news people sub hoping for. think so? think worse like New York March/April? Well won’t get party easily spread going party... understand that? Many states using money fund tourism ads...so would much rather essential workers educated pay tourism ads. stop Yeah, people quarantined sick extending quarantines they're exposed party? guess not. majority Floridians still do. I’m glad you’re one statement “just true”.  20 million population Florida comparable Germany Norway, wrote books handle successfully instead desantis went herd immunity That’s said. I’d probably agree this. agree blanket statement “#stayathome white privileged”. unnecessarily inflammatory you’re clearly capable making real argument? Sad see scientifically accurate posts getting buried. blame media much fact.

Source? 

I've seen claim way many god damn times. There's got reputable source somewhere backing up. making claim think true ego backing up?

Hell, we're Covid dangerous meida makes Especially obese basically guaranteed okay 

Source?

I look forward either replying claims total horse shit, replying sketchy ass source, replying telling research, even though burden evidence falls one making claims. Whatever fuck helps sleep night knowing 190,000 Americans died attitudes like yours. means literally nothing, PR real basis depends... long-term varying meaning. Probably significant day calendar. Like saying “after Thanksgiving” “after New Years.” here. Late March. Sweden also lot smaller population France heard Daily month back suspected weaker strain virus deadlier versions spread much since kill people infected. Okay, fine, maybe capitalism, per se, definitely stupid bootstrap ideology people worth labor capital they're producing. 

Even so, safety nets would hell lot bigger folks could afford pay taxes paid fair share. friend sat car hours someone showing symptoms (sneezing kind tired). person tested positive 3 days later got much sicker. friend isn’t getting tested said symptoms CDC said didn’t need test unless showed symptoms. 

My friend wasn’t denied test, believes wasn’t necessary get tested.

Edit...I don’t know CDC actually said this, said. Seems kind stupid me. would nice...but can’t even get second round stimulus passed. Instead trying bail coal industry owners even workers left behind even more. read macaroon Yeah happens happens lock throughout holidays? locked longer, done damage, done nothing get rid virus. get today, they'll get tomorrow Moderna far easier distribute 2. However, discount fact Pfizer large, practiced pharmaceutical company. preparing work distribution issues. Pfizer also started 4- narrowed 2, chose better 1. saved development time. Johnson Johnson took similar tactics.

Moderna's Pfizer's similar whole time, especially data we've seen, we're likely looking working one works.

Pregnant women extremely likely included emergency approval. different situation testing wise. Check date California’s mask mandate look spike cases.  observe reality still think inexpensive measure, panacea, still observed. pretty disgusting me. goalposts moved every single time number reached like ""oh...it's 40,000 deaths! die influenza year!!"" 100,000 die! go ""no big deal...many die HEART DISEASE!"" 150,000 passed go ""FAKE NUMBERS! DIE FLU CAR CRASHES!!""

LIKE...wtf wrong people? O.o Highly unlikely, tons countries tried failed that. count people 70-80 last group? footnote weird since requires extrapolation. author trying explain Brits different life Sweden compared UK. good way. Probably works likely labeled such. likely want potentially spread virus. Could be. Orange County CA’s Florida. base.

In totally believable number given CCP, despite epicenter highly infectious virus massive population almost unrivaled earth, half amount cases Canada does, 33x population of.

I feel number would easily criticize *any* reliable information whatsoever coming China. Criticize US failures, let China hook blatant disregard accurate information India almost certainly overtake US confirmed cases. gap 2 million. India nearing 100,000 cases day (and rising) US 40,000 cases day (and still falling). Even current rates, take India month pass US confirmed cases. India's deaths lot lower. Part due younger population, factor US drastically under-counting cases back March/April Northeast big outbreak. India recently pulled ahead US daily deaths, expected pass US (or even Brazil) deaths time soon. hope right. seems ballpark.

Local places hit hardest this, position financially so, helping folks difference favorite restaurants still existing so. There’s lot degrees “not normal versus lockdown”. Saying things aren’t back normal doesn’t mean lockdown.  don’t think states absolute lockdown right now, continue gradually open up. states measured ways based data, others apparently didn’t get fucking memo.  Lol I'm sure work spectacularly actually sub always coming bad news. 

Fauci super honest he's saying expect vaccine 2021 go back normal end 2021. exception US, figured everyone would NZ now. like everywhere now. Noone cares anymore. semi understand even part stay home, maintain distancing, etc. etc. 5 morons every one anything want. Seems futile. So, earlier statement everyone hates feds accurately restated lot people like feds small amount people hate feds, care one way another.

Exactly said lol... what's point one country states w/e fuck want? collective mindset going america? O.o don’t necessarily trust government put safety economy (they’re already proving currently). 

Because release shitty vaccine, it'll put even worse position. 

You understand, government BLEEDING money right now. Tens millions unemployed, even drastically underemployed, people actually good jobs scared make big purchases. 

But mean they're gonna release shitty vaxx -- would mess. They'd pay people got shitty vaxx even found good vaxx, population take it. would make things worse.

The #1 focus world right EVERY government safe vaccine fully opens economy. looks like Oregon 28,865 cases 499 deaths. regularly getting new cases. small rural area getting hit mean Big ole City way issues.

However, Chinese epidemiologists said European strain recently appeared Beijing virulent first encountered. They’ve basically past weeks, yeah Florida worse given population. Mississippi Louisiana much worse aren’t making headlines much smaller populations. course didn't. 

Glad they've gotten whole hoax thing. \*IF vaccine available. absolutely guarantee even high probability found this

“It appear case, however, motorcyclist killed traffic accident also tested positive COVID-19, initially listed among Florida’s COVID-19-related deaths. officials Florida Department Health said person since removed count.” joking smart ass waste time lot time anyway. Surprise surprise, pandemic brings extremists side. 

Although, let's fair, US never took seriously first place. certainly many candidate vaccines show promise could combination time provide level protection needed world population receive them. definitely hopeful nasally administered vaccines. may first wave approval, seems likely trial data available review mid-2021. meet partner spending money restaurant pub, go fuck simple problem solve.

You give everyone 2 choices. either get vaccine, get injected coronavirus. One way other, immune weeks. I'd venture guess majority countries successfully hampered corona US basically letting run rampant care maintaining ""normal"" life. No.

Wow, that's terrifying. amount medical ignorance world astounding me, particularly West (and **especially** US) going work sick (and irresponsibly so, like without mask Eastern cultures tend use) source social pride somehow. 

Like, nobody understand virus care much trust *person,* still infected?! Almost irresponsible saying vaccine good without safety/efficacy testing, comrade? I'm MD/PhD student that's pretty up-to-date literature re: COVID-19 (bringing mainly feel free speak jargon easier you), ask: portion statement disagree, basis?

From I've read, literature seems least suggest individuals pretty effective immune responses stereotypical antibody profiles time (and yes, we've seen headline ""rapidly waning"" antibody titers, several prominent immunologists pretty convincingly argued that's overstating normal decrease titers -- Prof. Krammer Sinai comes mind, one), NHP studies suggest virus induces sterilizing immunity. permanence obviously hard evaluate moment, genetically structurally similar virus SARS-Cov-2 SARS-Cov, measurable immune memory 12 years (although obviously bit tough say immunity clinical significance, seeing SARS basically existed 16 years). (EDIT: Also, measurable levels memory T-cells, obviously *prevent* reinfection cells need get infected first recognized cleared cells, would still likely sufficient clear virus quickly likely result less clinically severe disease.) recent Icelandic study NEJM also suggested reasonably long-lived IgG IgA response following stereotypical time course.

I'm curious hear exactly saying say gets downvoted makes say that. I'm also saying argumentative; I'm absolutely confident viral immunologist would know topic -- I'm genuinely curious reasoning. “Three people die covid complications” Yikes, comments cancerous. cases still rising there? obligation die job, whatever is.

Nice summary  US wanted limited investigation focused China exclusively investigators Five-Eyes countries therefore objected open international investigation cooperation WHO.

But instead, MONEY!!!!!! Central Florida! Nice choice words. Stay safe. could US am. Detected early, plenty advanced warning, one gave shit. Cause lot self-entitled Karens believed Agent Orange said big deal. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts end nearly state’s social-distancing restrictions Monday even number new coronavirus cases trended upward last months.

The new rules still limit size large indoor gatherings, concerts, meeting halls theaters, drop state-imposed mandates favor voluntary guidelines, conservative states done.

“We loosening restrictions Sept. 14,” Ricketts said news conference.

State officials said made decision based availability hospital beds ventilators, keeping Republican governor’s goal overwhelming medical facilities.

“The goal always protect hospital capacity, capacity remains stable,” said Ricketts spokesman Taylor Gage.

Nebraska’s hospitals 36% regular beds, 31% intensive care unit beds 81% ventilators available, according state’s online tracking portal. numbers changed little last months.

The new rules apply statewide except Lancaster County, includes state capital Lincoln, home University Nebraska’s flagship campus. They’ve already effect 27 Nebraska’s 93 counties, areas overwhelmingly rural seen confirmed cases.

Nebraska also allow smaller indoor facilities, bars, restaurants, churches, gyms hair salons, operate formal restrictions. State guidance still recommends limiting crowd sizes, guidelines aren’t enforceable.

Under new rules, larger indoor venues concert halls allow gatherings 75% rated capacity, 50%. Additionally, Ricketts said people want gathering 500 people get approval local public health director.

The state’s shift won’t affect mask requirements Omaha Lincoln. cities still require people wear face coverings indoor spaces aren’t able stay least 6 feet (2 meters) apart.

Lincoln-Lancaster County Public Health Director Pat Lopez said county won’t ease restrictions month recent increase cases driven returning college students reopening Lincoln Public Schools, state’s second-largest school district.

“This time stay course, also redouble efforts Lancaster County,” Lopez said. “We need best community overcome impacts virus.”

Nebraska confirmed 36,917 coronavirus cases 421 deaths since pandemic began, according state’s tracking portal.

Nebraska saw sharp spike cases Tuesday Wednesday, result glitch slowed reporting test results. several days that, state’s public health data system wasn’t receiving results even though laboratories processing tests.

Even so, number confirmed cases trended upward since early July. Nebraska ranks 15th highest rate positive cases week, according data collected Johns Hopkins University.

Neighboring Iowa South Dakota seen even higher rates. Sunday, White House coronavirus task force sent report saying Iowa third-highest rate new cases country previous week. week earlier, Iowa nation’s steepest rate new cases.

Plenty people like Biden, Democratic primary, post convention speech polling showed increased likeability, people enthusiastic voting him. first choice, he's far ""terrible candidate"". join defeatist circlejerk complaining reddit's tendency circlejerk.

Biden's victory definitely guaranteed, plenty time election Trump's natural electoral college advantage. also bit worrying tight race becoming swing states. However, nearly bad bravely, face possible downvotes make be. someone sadly lives state-this guy sucks complete utter fucking moron.

Certain politicians: ""We're shutting down. financial aid affected either..."" case count positivity rate still high.

Businesses: ""Uh... guess we're staying open then.""

Infection spreads rapidly.

""Damn young people!"" families, incredibly tragic. one’s whole family wiped out—not even close.

The Fusco family New Jersey made national news 5 older members extended family died. it’s massive family—like 11 kids one family lines—in hardest-hit area country. national news outlier. Don’t worry I’m going go giant foam party something. I’m fucking pissed. make sacrifices, reap reward end get nothing show it. Hey Reddit comment throwaway hate even this, but: attitude. We’re still fight. need share conclusion election. like it’s loose isn’t much except either permanent lockdowns let run course 40% Americans obese (horrendous diets) greatly increasing risk every illness. Well said fall, fail, really matter.

I'm guessing they're taking happened last 4 years, even last 4 months.

Ya know, like country divided ever, country literally burning, president repeatedly scandal scandal, impeached, ties Russia, 10 percent country evicted also there's pandemic happening made political Trump, dividing people even more, also making impossible country actually handle properly.

Maybe one hundred things happened last 4 years...tough pick. Bahahaha omg listen video??? Hahaha put hard beat like night club ready party streamed faucis credentials.

I didn’t know rock feel depressed There's lot respect hooked ventilator Right. that’s gonna possible, concert venues won’t exist point unless you’re talking shitty Live Nation owned arenas whatever. still plenty younger people hospitalized. They're lot less likely die. would advise nations assume American government will, least, schizophrenic political reforms. would make difference Trump president, still remember large portion Americans voted still support him. Yes, also lot people vote all. make better; fact, may even worse much apathy. also cancel tuition limit financial hardship students? also said likely wear masks social distance vaccine, 2021. point I’ll put hope therapeutics drop seriousness illness dramatically swing miss myocarditis thing complete BS Come better 4 years ago? Well lets see.

Compared 4 years ago unemployed, can't leave house, relatives shown huge divide reality large can't ignore idiocy, riots cities... yea shit seems much better. fooled, intentional. Yeah panel. said spikes might happen suggested 2nd wave 1st one finish yet. also recall saying waiting spike Labor Day see. why? 

because enviornments spread disease goal catch spread it? dumb question! Time needed hospitals wouldn’t become overwhelmed. 

Time needed lots things. needed time prevent hospitals overrun, increase availability production tests, ventilators, PPE, give scientists time learn new virus spreads, give doctors time develop best practices/protocols. 

We still ready/affordable access PPE, sanitizing wipes, purell, still lot unanswered questions virus, still need better treatments, still still want catch virus. already seen hospitals hot spots overwhelmed doctors forced decide let ventilator let die, patients admitted sent home die alone. 

Now good news we've learned lot already. knew March April know could saved lot lives. people catch virus 6 months likely far better outcomes people catch today. trump-hoax rhetoric

ok sheepie I’ve couple times wanted good steak things couldn’t get delivered always encountered one idiots couldn’t wear mask properly engage social distancing.

""Treating like animals stealing children another thing together.""
What talking about? We're executing people cretin. children? go drunk driving kid tonight get arrested, guess what? kid coming me. logic applies here. children abducted stuffed hamster pens. Jesus sensationalism pathetic. break law we've clearly established legal ports entry you. that's comparable ""maintaining order"" literal Nazi death camps, infantile imbecile.

Many people risk everyone around want ‘normal’ badly.  read it. change anything? packing people two large popular rides. safe. state needs go courses reach herd immunity.  Preach! hate shitty inconsistent masks quality even across brand.

I found good one Kroger, fit well good nose piece actually bent stayed shape like gaps. bought 10 packs lasted while.

Just went back 50 pack brand picked thinking reliable. Well turns larger bulk package ones different mask, they’re flimsy, nosepiece doesn’t bend doesn’t mold face, slips constantly.

This shit sucks  Türe zu.

There's one woman picture clearly mask chin. park mandatory mask rule mean people complying it. Show pre-print referring First really lost relatives Holocaust would understand many atrocities committed justified people ""I following orders"" shit fly Nuremberg trials, fly now. 

Secondly arresting illegal immigrants one thing. Treating like animals stealing children another thing together.

Don't pity obviously none need it. I’d say dont need report common sense like that, sadly we're fucking not. Unless Google lying us, chart shows clear decline prior June riots starting April. spiked started receding mid July. fuck guy even talking about? We're almost back April levels fuck's sake. us Lying never wise situation though. they've lost credibility.

It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger young. Sure, could probably make brick wall, he's smart strong, smarter hire someone. hours he'd save simply hiring someone him, he'll make far money lifting weights performing acting, putting wall himself.

So, sure, he'll lose little bit money hire someone, amount he'd earn Arnold star would massively cover builder's fee. He'll still walk away profit. That's opportunity cost. lot us are! think load feels lighter it’s shared. need people confide listen - even therapists. therapist also multiple clients therapists. really surprise? People still smoke cigarettes despite outward cancer labelling package. Possibly Jan 20 2025 don’t get shit together website tracks deaths normal year previous years? That's Alabama essentially stopped testing.

Smallpox officially eradicated disease ever.

Edit: whoops. Forgot rinderpest. I’m convinced rioting guaranteed us another 4 years nonsense Economy start moving, safe way hope, praising people wearing masks instead shaming public. (male always been) crotch flagged dude run hand junk gym shorts. done asked, ""was good you?"" Never seen TSA agent clam fast. people acting like assholes virus thing, stupid assholes. free, strong, smart. fucking idiots. know it.. ""Studies show coronavirus active winter time."" Take new seasonal studies grain salt. Almost year still figured shit honestly luck mortality rate relatively low virus seems largely spare young people.

Unfortunately think anything learned happens again. think leads perception flip flopping. think sometimes he’ll make reasonably realistic statements “we’ll return normal summer 2021 latest” definitely within last weeks, he’ll make big contradictory statement shortly returns “sober restrained public health official” role. It’s incredibly frustrating visited Germany weeks - Freiburg, half time year abroad part degree. remember amazed see locals stopping waiting lights change pedestrian crossings, *on completely empty streets absolutely cars sight*. guess kind respect rules really help current situation. vaccinating people don’t virus emergency? It’s proven longevity proven work without side effects...

What even talking about? proven vaccine world would clawing it. injecting 100,000 people serum without evidence woes doesn’t make vaccine... 

Does work?
If isn’t published... ?

People baffle OK, Ill talk myself. know, since grew there. also since obviously listening facts presented. Wait, let call mom lives fine less that. friends, rest family.

If making 57K year living NYC struggling, need practice actual budget stop blaming wages. even teach kids budget days? America's like one kid group project sits back playing phone.  one, punish kids trying get education massive student loan debt point wish went trade school ""because would made money"". WTF Neighbors north national mandate going magnitudes better

Having leader encourages gatherings.....that hurts 4 years? Goddamn! sucks. think discovered secret eternal life terrible! sure hell like Biden liked Hillary.

I like Biden. I'm excited him. design slogan viewpoint would be: ""Vote Joe: He's Okay."" try injecting disinfectant /s getting voted truth.

I probably too. silly. course think every disease, every action every movement. layers laws around food safety, motor vehicles, construction etc. designed minimize risk.

For matter laws people think topless women immoral men need wear pants.

Minimizing risk smart pays itself. Statistics support that. worked insurance 30 years, understand risk. 

As 60 years old people want ignore virus see little personal risk damn everyone else different people want drink drive.  shocked shot unarmed person color two days ago? course not. hear claimed does. misleading article causes outrage panic? *this* sub? way!

Meanwhile, anything that's slightly good news gets picked apart extremely critically. Luckily still savings $600 still worry tough find job field. already competitive ridiculous. However time I'm worried second wave. America's going country another 4 years trump Literally burning? Due left protesting? California bad month?

Who cares Donald impeached. fucking political theater. know case Democrats trying get rid Trump since shit Hilldog election. Look new Covid relief bill. Started hating even read document. possibly know don’t like something haven’t read it. 

Long story short Biden isn’t going win. worried bit beginning point going actually say words seems increasingly difficult talk public. Wait realize could person black book numbers. You’ll never see official death count fascist regime like ICE. Dat faux intellectual false equivalency tho Two weeks? School went back months ago. forgotten probably thats bad thing. almost valid medical reason. severe lung disease need mask anyone. never met anyone EVER hospital 30 years could wear mask.

""An ounce prevention worth pound cure.""

No, prevention methods *perfect*. solution work making better, *not them*. 

There needs social safety nets. Read post again. still hundreds cases Austria every day, along deaths. wonder effect example morbid obesity kids psyches. Normalizing hundreds pounds overweight seems like bad way promoting healthy attitudes diets among kids. get kids make smart eating choices role models give obviously never made smart eating choices themselves. many seriously ill hospitalized?

Italy: 1597 new cases yesterday (26 cases million)

Germany: 1892 new cases yesterday (22 cases million)

Germany's new cases grew faster italian's though, percentage per million right looks close. No. It’s worth virus! Call it’s Ebola something like that.

You underestimate serious total lockdown is. would really really fatal make worth it. Hello Germany. Life almost normal.... :) Also remember kids back school May June July. return summer break.  every confirmed case COVID-19 May, 82-130 infections went undetected India potentially 6.4 million infections Nah. Publishing articles suggesting stop speaking kind shitty attention grab tho 👍🏻 never locked first time, goal posts moving. never made goal post. ""2 weeks stop spread"" turned ""6 months hunkering down""? thanks, I'll take chances. AFAIK, years vaccine impacted, since strains chosen around march - relevant data comes lockdowns.

 exact question regarding next years flu vaccine however. banks charge 10 - 17 monthly fees.

Sorry, what? banks *charge money use them?*  Sorry true. Look Austria instance well months. Bangladesh testing like 10-20k per day still high (10+%) positivity rate... crop failures happen mass due climate change there's enough food fraction population. eat rich civilization thing history. need direct anger people never locked never wore mask. would argue cover-up. best case such? *just perfect* discover causes tons long-term issues road discovered, yet. 

""They almost survive!"" means shit causes **permanent** damage survivors. Bad news vaccine effectiveness nearly 20 percent don’t make neutralizing antibodies. late. Everyone state thought pandemic since May. Good luck getting texans back board anything best interest. pooper two cheeks I've eaten restaurant three times since started spent next two weeks paranoid time. Chief Brody Jaws. Anything involves Facebook poll automatically bullshit

Come Wonderful type elected official presides emergency policy... think important remember general Sweden go school one class, 20-30 people sharing lessons program except electives. kindergarten high school. Based schools already separated cohorts shared member teacher easily extendable. example would fixed seating based class instead free seating free lunch provided day.

Compare many American schools every single period different class, creates much conductive environment transmission. 

Another example would making sure class uses one classroom instead switching common today. also easily done since teachers classrooms contrary many American schools. workplace teachers area students teachers show together given time assigned generic room suitable subject. 

This also means there's bells school, nothing extremely crowded hallways everyone 5 minutes rush next class. Instead everything staggered based individual class' schedule.

Signed Swede spent exchange year Texan upper middle class suburban public high school. going café harmful country's virus management strategy expect government close cafés. 

Why? seems plenty evidence government always should. seem confusing legality safety, two necessarily always match up. even know ad hominem means expecting lockdown 50 years, know say man. Apologies comment tho fucking bullshit wonder though; country huge diverse United States, even competent president, would things gone differently?  


Yes. Definitely yes, timing. Even half assed attempt we're making would much better sooner (since impactful earlier happens). attempt better, that's bonus. don't. go restaurants indoor seating. twO WeEks gUYs! lot worse, actually.

NY low single digit deaths per day, twice population Sweden. exactly ""a lot worse"" discussing claim US halfway point. 

I never made claim. said ""we"" I'm talking planet. US well beyond halfway point. Besides, I'm actually middle really strong lockdown, Melbourne, Australia. 6 weeks, reduced daily rate cases tenfold. aim get point new cases contact traced, far, we're track so. really harsh, works. 

It work. can't lock tight enough get point virus spreading community, otherwise starve people death. soon relax, community spread. lockdowns slow down, NEVER get rid it. That's pipe dream. 

The places shot working islands human traffic completely controlled, even finds way in. Germany testing waaaay per capita Netherlands do. assumption wrong.

Just doctor tells little cough Corona, mean tests. means German system understood tracing way important effective randomly testing people. Stop strawmen.

1) Nobody wants us locked need be. want us locked get virus manageable place. could 4 weeks folks like gave fuck lives economy

2) survival rate high adequate treatment facilities available. don't, death rate jumps order magnitude. prevent facilities getting overwhelmed? best prevent transmission

People like making economic depression worse giving damn virus. lot cases, that’s right number really look at. hospitals seeing rise cases might right time start talking second lockdown though. yes government taking seriously, it’s people aren’t really. mean government could put whole country lockdown again, comes huge cost (we’re already recession, cost don’t mean money mean lives going ruined it), isn’t simple decision make. People France complaining annoying masks are... mean really, complaining simple mesures annoying saying government isn’t anything ? 

When comes schools think it’s good think kids go back. Kids haven’t daily activities 6 months going back school. Also it’s school kids really learn protect virus (washing hands, distance....) cause parents aren’t always best comes that. think people overlooking problems caused virus. mean don’t get wrong, I’m confinement it’s necessary, much isn’t gonna help anything. pandemic that’s gonna stick while, we’re gonna take long run mesures, simple, daily ones. president like substitute teacher can't control class, even good kids act out. 

I think president someone people respected listened to, now.

Fauci guidance counselor that's many school years trying help sub, sub little man complex instead makes things worse. That's $915 month average. willing suck dick poor? What? Haha it’s couple years since store got lectured dangers unions... got email morning. Fuck Wells Fargo. Dammit, step game America! 

/s 100% possible strong leadership national strategy. going wait Biden then. willing dine unmasked restaurant

How eat drink mask on? Hey, brag. Stuff like alot people low opinion Florida. Amateurs. India: new 95,000 cases everyday. Obvious anyone brain Yeah, wearing mask go shopping ""harsh"".

I know it. 10 mil till work enough black lights know difference black light UV lamp, there's lot ""COVID compatible"" black lights sold legit UV lamps. peer reviewed study says upwards 100,000 americans virus early March. WAY started testing it. think China isn’t lying????? however shows readers narrative totally twisted support argument. feel free believe someone never vs someone posting there. That's quite true. couple Karneval parties meat packing plants saw large numbers. That’s certain contingent wants yes. went one trying say people mental illness need grow up. argument?

Positive articles flu vaccination rates help push people towards getting COVID-19 vaccine?

""US sets 47 year high seasonal flu vaccine showing confidence safety vaccination.""

That's gotta help, right? allowed 4000-5000 spectators attend football game Lens - PSG ...  Eh. America many problems prevent handling virus effectively European countries. Covid deniers large part it, sick pay paid leave. Daddy fauci would proud you. matter much. doctors swayed releasing vaccine unsafe, you’re willing trust November? Hand sanitizer alcohol

Liquor brain liver sanitizer. Huge problem, viral load changes lethality. Increasing viral load facilitating potentially liability negligent homicide. I've hunkering 6 months, many people pretending dealing pandemic, hunker rest year. Cool, cool, cool. Really? Austria well informed last heard Germany quite harsh restrictions. Lol nope, fining people wearing attire requested that's Iranian religion police shit Let's say China hiding 99% confirmed cases. That's still 700 confirmed cases yesterday country 1.4 billion people. Stay humble bro Aw someone get triggered? nice day way Sweden. don’t even wear masks sit next class. don’t understand isn’t spreading much among us, I’m glad isn’t. Oh shit we’ve got two! Hold on.... 😎 ok. Ready! Eat check out. US’s Dr Anthony Fauci said in-person schools reasonably safe pandemic protocols followed, ***and*** Covid-19 caseload well-controlled district. 

Opening schools face-to-face learning foolhardy regions experiencing spikes, Spain appears be. American way, hell else expect? vote bunch fucking idiots get fucking idiotic results. Register vote part. Hopefully enough people vote help us make country less fucking bad. dream day single mention current sitting president done. Even forcing people hunker down, like PA did, didnt kill virus.

Yes, work done properly. (Hint: letting people get takeouts properly) 4 weeks lockdown NZ bought us 102 days total virus free time. US death rate high...it's 3%, due blatant undertesting March April release study: probably much, much lower reality resulted little loss life...

When majority average life span, huge deal. shamed thinking I'm somehow bad person correctly valuating 80 year old who's lived full life valuable everyone else full life ahead them.

The coronavirus prematurely ended 700,000 thousand people's lives 1 2 years, real tragedy lies 200,000 actually lost full breadth life. Trump: nah you’re changing story. didn’t ask stay home you’re sick flu. avoid going all, work home necessary, stay 6 feet apart people times - don’t catch flu can’t give people?

Nobody that. people might start knows, year people would think crazy acted way avoid flu. know, really take sunshine know infected people infect more? Really? first buy tabac shop 

Lmao what, got rinced, always free download, even need print guess people dying covid flu. 

CDC estimate 61,000 deaths 2017-2018 flu season website, *very* high (the highest since 2009).

""Flu season"" usually recognized Oct-May. 

Fuzzy math would put average fatality rate ~2,000 per week. peak death rate reported around ~4,000 per week around February. 

With COVID, we've looking ~1,000 deaths per **day** (or ~7,000 per week). Back April 2,000 deaths every day (over 14,000 per week). 

This take consideration studies show flu deaths may over-estimated covid deaths may under-estimated, flu literally ""just flu"", covid still new/unknown thing ""survivors"" may still end life-long ailments end dying much later complications. Basically, ""death"" one part concern covid.  first sentence... feel insecure? Nobody said EU great job (Italy Spain France UK Sweden Belgium clearly didn't). world said bad job US gov people did. least FREEDOM right? acted fast danang outbreak. Seriously one learn   didn’t even control well. keep saying protests didn’t spread it, counter intuitive thing ever leaves wondering wtf actually going numbers small matter here. We’re talking 100 flu deaths per week early summer 10 flu deaths per week now. It’s weird numbers pretty similar 2020 like 1 0 deaths per week now. man. Got email society lot work on. lot people living beyond means this. grew broke worked us driving cheap cars sticking savings foreclosure.  Every area different, houses reasonable area. foreclosed two story house garage sold us recently cheap. needs lot cleaning work, sold lot 2 bedroom apartments sell one year. I've offered people use tools get ahead. Fuck yeah right. Also NY

👉👉 1) life ain't worth living

2) Extended recessions cause lot actual deaths, Even comment section French surrender unable leave country unable experience life Austria, pretty much everything open. Gatherings 5000 permiited. Masks mandatory places like food shops banks ( schools wrong side warning light system)

But know? went swimming, gym, saunas, beach, shopping, museums, church, rally, meetings, multiple restaurants, etc week. 

Different narrative, free travel Austria. Books written back 90s (The Coming Plague; Hot Zone) pointed international air travel makes us uniquely vulnerable pandemics.

As one many silver linings hope see pandemic fog clears regulations around closing national borders far sooner following discovery epidemic occurring anywhere world shows (as Covid-19 clearly did) potential mass contagion, ie: novel respiratory virus.  it’s outweighed sense selfish asshole. Everyone emphatically wearing masks even behaving reasonable way. can't look rest world say ""welp guess impossible"" fairly misleading. far actual infections first wave, caught testing now. death peaks April.  deaths Czech - curve spiking hard upwards, wave death nowhere near bad first, least yet.

This US.  Probably not. owe give them, maybe change themselves. happens declining numbers charts personally approved Trump, hey, I'm sure one thing entire Presidency lied about.

Even though he's caught tape saying lied, repeatedly, COVID. India 1.2 million tests 1 day 1400 million people. 80 tests per 100k per day. Near Spain.
While sure 100k cases day IHME models insane. Look predicted numbers china Japan I’m sure people could see number votes casted candidate still believe electoral system accurately representing people presidential level Lol ok. link comment losing 6 months life? I’m genuinely interested seeing don’t remember saying that. anyone actually harassed wearing mask, besides rolling eyes something inane like that? refunds 🤷🏻‍♀️ ""I seen man, seen America. gets taste lungs spreads pack like wildfire. Know thing COVID? got lifeless old people, like burning retirement home. Dont seem living all, till coughs ya, lungs turn white ya hear coughing wheezing...""

""Are speech Jaws?"" first European wave effectively ended around mid-May

No not. fact spiked June!! - Yes still first wave, say second wave first one still going Like executive officer. legislative responsibilities run playbook make sure departments communicating working right. That’s good idea. Man, can't believe life working day occasionally wearing mask go grocery shopping change life working day occasionally wearing mask go grocery shopping. It’s definitely depressing. workplace (restaurant) January. Everyone sick Jan, nobody sick since. SF Bay Area. “Can’t second surge, first one never ends.” ~Dr. Kevorkian dumb fucks think wearing mask imposing freedom, Trump fuck-wad tells lies jumps conclusions. like Sweden: health officials making decisions. firmly believe America would better CDC driver’s seat, regardless who’s Oval Office.

What dislike Sweden: can’t shake belief health officials contradicting mission Public Health Agency Sweden national responsibility public health issues works ensure good public health. agency also works ensure population protected communicable diseases health ""I care.""

-Skip Bayless tell we’ll know. completely true dont understand getting at. That's it. 200k dead. number inflated 30-40%. Maybe even more. worst behind us, let's work hard leave behind us? Let's encourage people careless based temporary progress make. think that's fair, no? Besides, ""normal"" return anyways people agree vulnerable population still treated such. voting ballot box different going get groceries? following kind people. Meh. group anti-maskers made political. MSM also stokes fear left stringing together Fauci Trump say try make things seem dramatic possible. example article, another Newsweek month two back, Trump said stupid shit like ""maybe, day, knows, disappear"" MSM ran ""Trump says virus disappear,"" meant tomorrow. Look I’m going bring Alex Jones come hang outside house you’ll understand.  social media doesn’t help either one person doesn’t believe masks work posts random clip scientist saying clip like five months ago initially said this. thing someone posts virus harmful flu posts death numbers April.  Can’t second wave first wave never ends. *taps head  make charts available everywhere, world date shows quite clearly Europe fine, 7 days average Sweden reference you'r pleasure! depressed *too  leader like Romney

That gun grabber? Make mistake, Romney democrat. money helped offset tax increase gave us? meant we'll indoors groups. Jesus people fucking thick. Here's one example [the US Surgeon General saying masks 

The cdc guidelines march said ""[You need wear facemask unless caring someone sick (and able wear facemask). Facemasks may short supply saved agree focused making sure healthcare providers access nuance easily lost many. people like forget nuance months (my bad). Something also important.. Swedes aready soclial distancing pandemic. way are. shred evidence requested, pre-print non-peer reviewed article. let know want evidence instead shred.

I work hospital well. course people get reinfected, immunity normal rely gets compromised litany medical conditions (you sound like Clerk hospital). Automod remove based keyword checks matching keywords comment. actual mod might remove see though really. ""Drunk power"" phrase covid existed. explains lot nonsensical measures, like Chicago half boating season couldnt sail around 2 people even 5 drove harbor car. Reddit one person fear... responsible said.
Everybody screws life... Right US even peers... sucks... true... country getting spotlight... USA (like France) give rest world feeling know better, better even often ... best.

The side effect get spotted every time case... Childish unfair pretty expectable unavoidable. ignoring fact response things proportional deadly are. COVID killed 191,000+ people since February; car accidents whole US average around 40,000. yes, makes sense response COVID much severe response car accidents things mentioned demonstrably less deadly. case things like heart disease obesity, ban things personal choice engage them. Nobody forcing eat junk food fast food. (That said, done things combat issue, like certain areas imposing high taxes items, schools longer permitting vending machines carry unhealthy foods, etc.)

In case COVID, hand, plenty people choice out, whether work, pick medicines, etc., may choice. medicines can't delivered. people cannot find new job current market cannot work home. 

Not mention, outside flu, things contagious like COVID. dying car accident suddenly raise everyone else's risk dying; get COVID, risk infecting everyone come contact with, many may choice essential workers, people getting groceries, etc. even ignore point masks distancing flu season, imagine much lives could save werent selfish winter closed economy down.

I absolutely didn't. *You* ignoring points made flu vaccine - naturally means less caution needed since people much immunity flu virus - much deadlier COVID flu. said, ask me, *should* wearing masks flu season. Looking back, idea didn't.

We can't respond literally every potential threat way. don't, never have, never will. respond things based threat present public. COVID much bigger threat population things mentioned based death rates alone given everything mentioned except flu contagious, even accounting for, again, permanent health damage caused virus even asymptomatic cases.

I mean, come on. Using extreme logic, what's point banning anything ever regardless dangerous is? drunk driving banned? saving every single life possible, bother? think I’m crazy Ma-ga guy I’m not. supporter whatsoever. viewer supporter Fox News. gun owner. protestor. I’m literally none things. 

But don’t agree. someone keeps illegally showing school going maybe close temporarily deal person, aren’t going permanently close. Relative immunity still air Well, wanted know guy knows testing current trends confidence official data, go elementary school lessons dude. Canada too, EU historically cautious medication approvals like use barometer medical related stuff. snide remark people calling China virus always known wearing masks reduce transmission communicable disease. That’s wear masks hospitals. *what unknown public would compliant enough wear properly great enough numbers drop cases.*

The issue lied deteriorated public trust. lie omission lie.

“Don’t wear masks! don’t work!”, omitting “They totally work, say don’t wear don’t think you’ll actually wear consistently correctly”. 

Ironically, created problem worried would exist. Great job. true COVID virus things, far early findings show problems like heart inflammation, lung scarring, overall organ damage, etc... occur much higher rate C19 influenza cold viruses. Maybe it’s we’ve locked entire time? supposed get first surge never outside it? Sweden countries let pass they’re open They're gonna regional. Cities get mostly control, lighten restrictions, one hayseed meaningless dirt farm roll kill another thousand starting whole city again. One step time. Lol. Michigan GOP legislature gotta boil frog slowly. lockdown

There was, nobody cared listen becuz 'Muh cannot second wave disease relative immunity achieved

Ahh, see clue talking about. go voluntarily infect see relative immunity works you. ""Thankfully""? taken look around lately? think there's anything thankful situation. really new information. situation changed one way drastically worth mentioning. Everyone knows still happening, point everyone knows basically doing. already made mind going behave. Nothing really new discuss Interesting didn’t distinguish since indoors vs outdoors seems vastly different comes virus. I'm trying disregard Trump's issues lot people thread seem forget 10th Amendment. essence anything given Federal Government constitution must given states. United STATES America.

The attention focus state leaders criminally underrated. mean Federal Government role play.  think skepticism warranted. unclear much difference leader makes. level community spread spring, virus going spread throughout country matter actions taken (at least short closing state borders lockdown would never survived legal action).

The single biggest factor could reduced deaths would better protecting elderly. Specifically nursing homes. decision left governors definitely handled better others. national policy recommendation early probably biggest factor could significantly changed death count, imho. Many countries struggled issue. don’t need figure it’s job problem. it’s pretty obvious. 

Then even say ""fucking something"" first place? Waste time. seems fair hold college students higher standard adults. Makes sense. /s Man sad see world goes gone.. nuh uh!  scientific data change led messaging change.

They worried supplies.

So scientists lie effectiveness.

China told President FEBRUARY airborne infectious. China using masks, point recommend wearing masks countries.

China countries knew masks effective SARS1. scientific precedence masks work, still isn't. Masks work, always have, always will.

Yet that's American people told. People allowed protest go gym best quickest option cut bullshit FDA issues preventing 1$ home 15 minute result paper tests mass distribute everyone. 

If everyone took test every morning would get handle matter weeks. quite accurate PCR, still catch people infectious period far effective taken daily. positive followed PCR confirm 

Medcram others covered extensively shame government isnt board. Maybe another vaccine gets halted wisen up. sit around waiting either way  Ok everywhere I’ve everyone properly masked makes feel better. Yeah sorta kills well. midst viral pandemic gargantuan medical proportions, suddenly every fool public amateur virologist. Since half population US vote, assume idiots not. nothing morality. 

You're using feelings bad science support feelings. I'm using scientific consensus. No, not. case 200k dead moron Child Like Eyes? Try Cuba, ya imbecile. I'm trying disregard Trump's issues fairly disingenuous. single lot people thread seem forget 10th Amendment. essence anything given Federal Government constitution must given states. United STATES America. attention focus state leaders criminally underrated. 

Doesn't mean Federal Government role play. Goods get delivered way. towns far self sufficient. Hell, many towns near interstate people stop gas. Hope learned lessons. starts top.....and know he’s stupid AF completely agree. 

University mainly social aspects. It’s get education. 

Dorms etc. way exist US common here. Crazy fraternities etc. exist.

Even US high schools stuff surrounding universities, isn’t bad thing. 

The outside school activities Germany centered around school never were. 

You don’t Play Soccer School, local soccer team. basketball sports. (Just example) grandmother plan sending ballot voting him? 

I never said sending ballot someone who's dead impossible thing never happens, see many people chomping bit vote twice seem think are. Ah old trick, lets dismantle truth make point? saying places US people dying outside hospitals ICU beds available count? 

Even ""look-at-sweden-its-terrible"" fake president talked less deaths per capita US. 

In US 1.000 souls die every day covid, Europe that's around 500 population twice large. yea, clickbait dont know ask guy. Vaccine made underdog's DNA? Again, checks went wrong people many times. can't control money, think care ballot? case host positive, virus, tood quarantine. frat house brothers exposed also supposed quarantining. 

The rest partygoers not. (Now, also quarantining.) City State?

My area's limited attendance elementary/middle/high schools. understand flu season corona worse feel plague rat? still buffoon leading Okay, I'm going try explain here, please bear might take bit:

1. confirmed present tested positive, there's start. - right either already risking infecting others.
2. students going keeping away others, I'd say party great indication give fuck quarantining infecting others, so, everyone they're going come contact quarantining? None us live bubble, think people going exposed Covid (because stupid twats) fault (and I'm thinking employees, kind, whether store front sales/cashiers delivery people).

I hope never understand hard people understand people directly affected stupid kid's actions: even someone gets asymptomatic infection, people going unknowingly infect? ones kids infect *will* get sick end awful health complications rest lives? people *who die* careless, thoughtless, selfish, stupid actions kids?

This matters actions students will, *guaranteed*, negative effect lives others around them. question whether negative consequences actions, *but bad be.* many lives lost stupid party?  


So, yeah, matters matters lot.... assuming care lives others, is. ""You can't keep water! Muh freedom!"" CHOMP  1,2,3, many. specific group secretly paying Fauci? Or, know, Fauci lying beginning saying wear masks wouldn’t help knew damn well would. Trump sucks saying 100% responsible idiocy. grandfather passed away 2 years ago, yet grandmother received check him. common enough became news stories several times Sweden currently one lowest infection rates whole Europe. see anything positive news Sweden last weeks. though ? O.o pollutant particles make virus symptoms worse would interesting know why. Like chemical reactions reactions causing it. Anyway that's discovered it'll big step closer defeating virus. mean *not* spreading certain party's agenda. leading vaccines already manufactured anticipation positive efficacy trials. Phase 3 goes lot faster pandemic. Normally phase 3 takes years vaccinating relatively rare disease. takes time find control group became exposed virus vaccinating for. pandemic need recruit people high risk jobs. doesn’t take much time start see positives control group hopefully none vaccinated group. place make people believe COVID-19 real serious. guess depends many subjects enrolled Brazil. transverse myelitis linked causally vaccine it’ll likely one rare, possible, side effects we’re always warned meds. know anything me. really demonstrating people like californians. fuck state. move states people warn fuck too. Instead demonstrating even modicum self awareness done, call people names insult empathizing. move state please. DA BEKOMMT MAN DOCH NEN ZUG! Literally called real action, them. Didn’t downplay severity politicize rile base. Step outside bubble man, don’t want watch CNN watch BBC read stuff like economist. Trump’s bad dude he’s taking advantage supporters sew dissent division country. aren’t enemies, right convinced are.  ignore people wear mask piss graves one person age 20 died Sweden. hope vaccine nothing woman’s illness. Elaborate... I’m sorry girl, feel pain. One week time. Think amazing get see boo again! That's part that's bit concerning 20-29 crowd fast risers getting infected. eventually move older folks every especially keep path holidays coming. Deaths probably lag behind month growing numbers worldwide.

However, we've learned lot help treat patients hopefully keep alive portion bad. lasting effects thing whole different question though. Take heart, isn’t apocalyptic. There’s still chance zombie apocalypse, isn’t it.. lol. mainland China comparable New Zealand?

Also New Zealand put Auckland second lockdown got new cases 100 days. Yet somehow think China, test asymptomatic people, virus originated, consistently lied entire pandemic, avoided reinfection unlike NZ? OK... hold hope. even feel shitty everything, remind lucky someone end this. mean might, we've seen since least February real danger air. yeah kids put everything mouths, change fact also breathe yell cough etc Holy shit, average redditor alert. Please keep masturbatory fantasies future. Magic USA. Holiday monday followed major natural disaster tuesday slowed testing (with abnormally low numbers reported). catchup. Overall trend little changed. Musta redneck territory NC, cities clogged masked people New Zealand deaths last week Kiribati total. Fact remains Sweden one lowest infection rates Europe right now. even know yet case transverse myelitis side effect anything. occur reasons too.

My point there's 50-50 chance person even get covid shot.

They chose meningitis C vaccine would side effects. would avoid people trying guess control live vaccine group (I think that's reason anyway,could wrong) Unfortunately view deemed anti trump downvoted. RIP brother. went parents vet senior dog, insisted wait car dog taken come talk us like used require earlier pandemic (my dad really wanted go inside). asked wanted come gave us funny look chimed explained parents high risk, like we're crazy ones careful. NONE workers wearing masks talked 4 different people. Masks required visitors either, saw 3/17 people wearing masks cramped little vet office. live Idaho county almost restrictions point, rare see employees customers anywhere wearing masks careful. disaster testing near non-existent knows bad really here.

My dad anti mask takes pandemic seriously, could hardly get put mask people came talk us. One girls 2 feet away minutes talked bit lisp definitely saliva air, neither wearing masks. frustrated, think seeing environment everyone else casual made want comply, understand. I'm 25 I'm sick feeling like responsible one reel parent knows better acts recklessly. I'm young unhealthy concerned ability fight virus let alone parents. independent group likely allowed “break blind” able determine vaccine received. investigating group won’t told stage investigation. Fuck man. really mean that. You’re pos nothing whether banning Chinese racist. Straw man theory. things don’t help you’ve already caught Oh Clinton, Obama, Hitlary, Schiff, Pelosi, Democrat party media haven't? Give friggen break. Democrats played too, check facts HOMIE Haha even talking even bring kids don’t saw doctor two months. anything life threatening find anything wrong despite feeling like shit. millions people suffering long term can't get answers. Plenty people never get diagnosis figure treat themselves. fucking preach people know shit about. Going back original point, Ayn Rand sociopath writing attracts sociopaths. ""Those infected kids include six mothers, one hospitalized, three siblings three others, study says.""

Mom hospitalized due viral load theory? Moms young friend promised kids don’t spread virus. could happen!? /s Well author claims 1 100 wear masks there, it? [Johnson] acknowledged uptick infections (as you’d expect people start mingle again) healthy young largely invulnerable coronavirus, emphasising another critical statistic: last week ten times many people died England flu pneumonia Farmville... course Yeah, keep postponing mine. appointment requires mask put February. appointments supposed go April rescheduled October. I'm hoping daily transmission rate low enough going doctor okay. people lot stupid shit. That's one this....  block them, better downvote submissions. ""did"". Still change stated I'm afraid. People America smart enough; ‘Mericans stupid Nice! covered deck patio underneath. could probably set ice portable area covered deck project onto foundation. I’ll look brand! Thanks suggestion. No, saying work electrical company, hospital, nursing home, truly essential business going live work entire duration lock down. soon people come go, risk goes up. six months later, people still can’t weddings visit loved ones there. Still wearing masks even still hundreds new cases day. You’d think country one highest deaths per capita would learn take seriously point. even oma? supposed going SDSU I've deferred year, Istanbul atm. Guess what? covid people hit gym sickness stomach region Um federal govt didn’t fucking shit Katrina lol. hardly unique America. Considering obsessed Tegnell Sweden weird dont understand basics. 500 people working Public Health Agency, honestly think Tegnell everything himself? Act God, according Modi. control cause rare side effect? Isn’t poor choice control? study/discussion regarding Americas appear harder hit expected? Could difference previous exposure COVID-like viruses Americas ""the old world""? Denial Read article. author comparing everyday life UK Sweden. using masks one example many. praising Swedish way dealing coronavirus. movies total garbage lol. first one actually decent simple, bombed badly recast everyone sequel looked like TV movie. even think made third one.

You read books want to, boring badly written taste. fair come kind unthinking moron read books get yourself. substantiate information ""she hardly played role like usually does""?

I read source provide. really needed 14 control group? Someone triggered here. Let's guess who!

One day grow up, get white hood own. argument medical system needed time handle influx cases without overwhelmed. goal never scorched earth prevention cases first place. Agree 100%. couldn’t play game without giving contradicting information, sowed distrust among people. Theres site/spreadsheet( believe teacher created) done cases info every school every state reported. I'll see find link. New Zealand followed nearly policies China (not strictly enforced, mind you) seen similar successes also transparent methods. 

The difficulty western democracies reducing spread people used less government intervention daily life compared authoritarian countries, leaders countries also used using public opinion source informing policy.

A lot people sick tired lockdowns, governments relented slightly appease potential voters. Generally, types political plays really matter much, virus, care politics. 

Ardern NZ listen vocal minority wanted public life reopened ASAP, reaping benefits strong leadership. maintained democracy kept people safe (although NZ seeing uptick again, nature liberal democracy offering citizens personal freedom). 


More world leaders could learn thing two her. KiD pAtrIot! #muhrights #maga /s Draconian punishments answer, Punishments sting (a lot), actually affect perp immediate.

I would also include service people recovering long term effects lingering Covid illness. referencing cartoon, bro. chosen karma death, I'll deal first downvote See ya JerseyMike forget shove sandwich ass buddy. TGIF almost like Australia beginning year, Jeez! That's really sad :( numbers may change small towns get hit more. Small towns high concentrations geriatric populations they’re ones stay. home town Nebraska probably nearly 40% Boomers they’re mostly agriculture so.....not exactly lean. three family members caught thankfully mild case close proximity puts edge. Opening state let’s everyone pretend things normal makes everyone get careless. It’s probably never going NY level disaster likely something consistently terrible. I’m getting tired nagging parents careful. point climate change political issue, apolitical solution it.

Remember, way, unchecked capitalism got us mess first place. must stupid get ride. Guess what? go gym sick anyways  different? They’re denounced risking lives citizens using untested vaccine. common estimate truly believe March

Some people think vaccine society go back normal earlier due fatigue

If shit hits fan everything goes wrong latest end summer next year Pfizer, please work. dont trust moderna. Things opening, believe 20% herd immunity enough. England thought thing goes party beer? raises hypothetical question:

Would Covid without lockdowns killed people total Covid lockdowns?

We'll never know. can't restart game play different strategy.

You'd hard pressed politician say, ""I know lot people dying streets, anything stop people countries dying"" remain office.  take genius Google New Jersey's numbers. already pointed they're still experiencing new cases new deaths daily. they're hundreds instead thousands make look good; still shows people state, like you, responsible enough get virus *truly* control. intent, WANTED to. Saying he's good failing really wanted fucking moronic. Sorry, attempt sort State wide/County wide/City wide lockdown. precisely, 171 cases per day,

Which means last two weeks new cases New Zealand *in total.*

What amazing success. Heh, talk anecdotes, tried use hospital visit proof people denied hospital care. Embarrassing. Oh no, bunch young people actually enjoying lives.

Arrest terrorists!!!!! fools would wear masks.

Most could avoided. Perhaps people trying cheer up.

Still smart, conceivable. Considering poorly funded schools city, already essentially that. I’m sure bring great joy know many NYC public schoolteacher friends often resort paying school supplies pockets starting gofundme campaigns classes. yeah, that’s already thing happy little prick it. You’ve made hell straw man fought admirably.

The problem don’t give shit, that’s me.

And defensiveness speaks foolish insecurity obviously overtly monstrous stance remonstration I’d care make.

Remember someone love dies Covid. sales. Nobody leisurely purchasing anything. global pandemic people dying. Nobody even message anything anyone. fact young kids, 100% know going on, even NEED someone spoon feed message, shows spoiled, self-absorbed, careless, stupid are. see?! true! every thing internet always comes back argument hitler right! LOL Fair probably believe hoax created election year US try living here...i face small talk fake happiness bullshit EVERY single day -_- differentiate situations real need give freedom temporarily overall benefit society, versus situations government inventing reason permanently oppress you? Seems like costly oversight then. options lockdown nothing

Outside maybe China, country completely either one two things. Every country used various degrees partial measures. one using false dichotomy. 

But want sit trying nit pick specific things specific places.... like, mostly lockdown here, there, open gyms quickly, get outdoor dining quickly, there's real point conversation. 

I'm interested trying tell better-targeted micro, specific plans health experts officials various places. everyone dealing limited information anyway targeted perfectly begin with. made ton difference economically anyway.

So nice day goodbye. risk transmission spouses higher family members, 30%. Check research data Table 3 journals.lww.com/em-news/blog/BreakingNews/pages/post.aspx?PostID=528 Household Secondary Attack Rates ...in way data shows covid hoax. Depending ""data"" look at, see different results.

There also enough ""data"" mental health pandemic. 

Here's message: lifetime global pandemic. 190,000+ people died US. spread 40% people symptoms. top public health officials say wearing mask social distancing need prevent spread. 

WHAT ELSE NEED? actually know college aged students family totally get follow rules. Nobody needs feed kids messages. crystal clear. friends toddlers understand things. 

This ""message"". selfish people. Quit making excuses complete utter idiots. care people, including friends underlying health conditions (including asthma, obesity). just.don't.care. throwing party struggle. perfect example years come generation spoiled brats everything handed apps technology cell phones, complain able throw parties. 

You gaslighting blaming complete BS. kids given plenty messages, plenty warning. repeatedly ignoring them, 100% ok right people condemn actions. 

Your comments complete disgrace. Go back history read shit people go through. nobody spoonfeeding anyone messages. Young men go WAR. day age, asked sit couch watch TV instead throwing party, social distance friends outside. Boo hoo. Low rate = deaths last three weeks New Zealand *in total*.

Well done, Sweden. get keep responding insults, /r/CoronaVirus places. Happy corrected, maybe google-fu failing me, can't find info national lock down. find various lists states lockdown dates, one:  


The inconsistency, fact states closed later, among ""closed"", mostly farce, enough impact. include group?  Ignore truth, that's Got nothing say see. I'm sorry live shithole state gotten control virus yet. actually research, like suggested, would know New Jersey have. start going back normal lives somewhat. Hopefully get one day! Good thing panic!


/$ “Oh, right. Single people.”

-Redditor wife three kids  People jobs provide families. lucky working right now, dont care that. Indeed, extreme desire mail voting merely coincidence.

Who exactly think buying anymore? deep deceiving way, completely nose extremely clumsy. I've same. started to-go month ago. Seems like that's safe. Miss restaurant foods lot. Dont really miss restaurants, although nothing good fresh hibachi well made cocktail. Miss random hey 3 4 couples, let's dinner, get togethers friends. Techinically polls correct. Trump received less total votes candidate. works works🙏 Nebraska around 200-240 deaths per million people (worldometer google api). Less half national average, I'd argue far higher statistically insignificant. Sounds pretty low risk, run scenario want estimate relative risk. kind oxymoron since every Chinese company responds central government end Fauci correct predictions? Including masks dont' work? think spotlight addicting people get taste it. There’s obvious naysayer push recently. There's lot going California. particular, we've careening stages reopening almost heedless current case count. Trying isolate mask mandate drowned noise. @ballookey yes can't see ever happening US dumb sounds get second wave let nature take course let virus burn done every virus history mankind. Also even though many vaccines available soon, many many people take while, typical anti vaxxers. Im date vaccines dont want vaccine rushed safety still iffy. Also quickly lose immunity catching it, unlike every virus nature human body encounters, lose vaccine immunity fast. Lockdowns general population dont work dont solve problem deaths among old. Adding safety measures nursing homes quarantining elderly needs done.  Mmmmmm think Biden going better job shit currently have. ones saying he’s great, compared fascist training? That's big if. ""Could be"" shutting 90 schools moment. Maybe ""could"" see that. Covid cases increased 43% England. France still borders closed travelers non-EU countries? Still, travelers monitored self-isolated 14 days, see they'd main vector disease.

That said, France require health cert quarantine last time checked. changed?  STARTED CREDIT UNION, CREATED COMMUNITY Selfishness. simple. Spain mandates public mask wearing I'm really sure, think testing increased - actually I've heard opposite, people started struggling get tested areas reason :/ said, TERRIBLE testing, definitely increase maybe even little bit drop heard correct locking world *aren't* boat US? Countries either restrictions similar tot US worse US. High schools (7th grade, age 13) first time separate teacher classroom subjects. specialist teachers things like PE, class teacher math/english/...

Are saying younger kids different teacher English vs math US? young? changed Covid? amount time 

Don’t naive. There’s thing called precedent. didn’t taxes 1913. supposed temporary. think they're undercounting, think manipulating data. say high positive day, they'll shift numbers around positive rate appears dropping. fudging w/ deaths - again, classic shell game ""peak"" again.

DeSantis playing Florida like Trump playing country.

And testing LESS 6 weeks ago? NY test 100K/day 1% positivity rate - testing 25K/day ?? argue testing better now, wheras back March actually tens thousands cases daily werent tested.

Problem argument is, also implies thousands daily cases Feb, hundreds daily cases Jan, community spread starting November

And makes difficult maintain blame China narrative, know blame China narrative must never allowed fall, alternative becomes blame us...

People might even pressure US EU explain kept massive outbreak hidden world way till March think understand
 long ignore covid19, feel bad go away Yeah, I've got hepa-like paper filters, find pain place remove mask, thinking I'm smudging possible virus everywhere, prefer all-in-one sewed together 3 layer masks.

I follow adjustable pattern found online (eta : different sizes depending face measurments), assembled following feedback team sewists made thousands first months (details, like place sewing lines one upon another, create open way virus (through sewing holes made needle thread)), layers follow WHO's recommendations : cotton near skin, unwoven water repellent breathable synthetic layer middle, cotton-polyester polyester layer outside better barrier droplets.

With perfect, sure best make home.

last eta : new french high authority health (HAS) recommendations say fabric masks public using washed low temp regular laundry detergent, safely disinfected. don’t let anyone make sound inject *amateur course do, done properly. They're impractical many hard enforce large unwilling population. Best hope much longer start bottoming (compared beginning anyway) lol cases going country? Hi Pete Ricketts Jack Ass amusement park re-openings death fest panic pushers hoped would be.  Less spending humanitarian aid closure borders specifically due lockdowns. due costs pandemic concern moving across borders. 

The notion lockdown evil thing kills people false notion best way deal COVID. Mask wearing TTI, like every competent country since February, best ways deal COVID. Lockdown last recourse incompetent countries they've let things get hand.

The reality evidence lockdown lead increased deaths, anywhere world. expensive fuck. good reason- citizen, obviously- travel Singapore New Zealand. contrary, travel France- although still quarantine, however hard enforce that- got wanna go. message gov officials media go flatten curve stop spread. one says flatten curve anymore, it’s stop spread means cases places I've to, maximum capacity impossible reach anyway. Think small taco bell 'max capacity' like 85 people. there's enough seating maybe 30-40. sounds like saying think every disease, every action, every movement results death point time Covid correct? Can't drive cars people families die car crashes, can't use trucks ship products flip kill driver could family, can't go store cold could infect someone family could go develop pneumonia kill them.

Do understand statistics important? know talk chances cancer come back, chances plane crash car carsh? living life dangerous cannot look macro situation case-by-case terms. statically safer fly plane drive car, even though people died, still far safer. Looking case individually course makes situation look worse. see creating Ebola remembrance day honor two U.S. citizens died Ebola, spread spread awareness dangers Ebola talk us government failed protect two people families? honestly think ""literal fuckwit"" would look statistics say Ebola threat today, definition uneducated idiot. mean? Like global pandemic somehow linked one country's election? Huh? Y'all already minimizing it, dear. think stupid selfish thinking allowed tell people stop living lives

No one said anything anyone telling people ""stop living lives."" Go back read comments like. literally *just* said things like hiking going parks fine fuckin research baby

Yeah, I'm baby, guy pitching fit needs directly shoved friends' assholes enjoy time them. rest us continue enjoy socializing safe distance. So, I'm gonna post would add context explain incredibly wrong detail, overzealous mod bot literally let me. get point. decided worth it, scientific consensus you. wrong cruel. Noice Bad what? Shouldnt old people stay away everyone? Um... no. Perspective help us get better grasp reality, perspectives biased wrong. Trump wins think fear mongering side also end.

SHUT

DOWN

EVERYTHING complicit nothing DNC... fucking elites power want split us along party racial lines. Realize major parties literally fuck working class benefit wealthy friends. money tied Amazon stock dumbass  Yep, wife, really discouraging seeing people used allied taking seriously casually dining gathering large groups people. Lol..you one examples internet. lie dude. Abbey thread practically sub circle jerking stupid Americans deserve die this. Outta Americans strong insights,that's Europeans flood sub giddy badly America managing (even though fewer per capita deaths guys gong second wave numbers unfortunately wiggly likelihood). thought odd age group taking seriously. figured going give least shits. also lowesr tolerance isolation. 

I super surprised aging republicans first Americans gate give shit. office job high rise building sounds like job! (Except contact staff get enjoy public transportation... course bastion health safety.) sub tell you’re gonna die anything lock house wish boss cared like do. I'm high risk still forced come back. Click bait. Europe double population USA. certainly extrapolate something positivity rates testing rates.

India 7.4% daily positivity rate 1 test per 100k people per day.

Spain 4.5% positivty rate 96 tests per 100k people per day.

The IHME model projects India seeing 660,000 actual new cases per day right (versus little 100,000 confirmed cases). model projects Spain seeing 13,500 actual new cases per day versus 10,000 confirmed cases. Yes. becomes garbage data phone, something inadvertently start time. Yep, israel 140k confirmed less 1/10th population. That's probably mostly due extensive transparent testing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* save anything. paid amount went employee first instead going straight government. Well honest, complete safety never attainable. Data shows testing decreased many places since then; however, hospitalization trend harder explain. Potentially, decrease testing leads lack awareness positive, people less vigilant looking signs may require medical assistance result wait late? Sorry wasn’t quoting word word. 

And physical plants — school buildings — need meet certain requirements. virtual interview 6 weeks ago RI Governor public K-12 school want Google it.

But essential thing stipulated virus needs controlled (beneath certain metric) given school district even consider in-person schools. History teacher here. mentioning exactly second wave hits. Viruses always hit central hub country spread. Usually time central hubs recovering, areas getting beat pretty bad. hubs think ""O look this! figured ok!"" people sllllowly start become lackadaisical. outer areas bring cases back hubs, like started beginning. people become lax, right back started.

&amp;#x200B;

I think biggest thing people forget takes one case infect someone restart whole dam thing. 80 countries around world banned us. know dangers exponential spread. I’m hunkering either. Neither rest hospital staff work ER. Literally people dying old people. one know gotten sick. 

I’m glad people hunkering though! Less traffic freeway. I’m still wearing mask though. think there's modern state ""control information""? so, tell bought set child-like eyes? Everyone. Exposure higher viral load earlier means potentially worse outcome. fuck talking about??! Oh, we’re counting off- hours email professional development?

I work 360 days year, then. don’t 20- week period work collect salary choose.

My statements simply numerical comparisons. I’ve said nothing disparages teachers way. come family teachers son one. 

I wish teachers paid more. They’re not, though ones know well later years. are, however, working wages get, they’re setting market. didn’t think worth wouldn’t it. sure worse. talking current situation. small percentage lingering symptoms better way describe it. Everyone I’ve known who’s either fully recovered asymptomatic entire time That’s funny thing. Information however interpret it. you’re trying silence debate based opinion dangerous wrong. decides interpret data? People shut emotionally prolonged crisis situation. survival mechanism mean taking action. upset terrified six months help anyone survive, would give stress related illnesses top everything else. Nah, second surge starting, first surge never fully cut out. Based historical precedent, whenever food starts run out. There’s reason US government really heavily subsidizes food supply friend clearly Canadian 1) don’t money fund secret prisons 2) would involve Canadian saying please 3) WTF?

I don’t think Americans understand one fundamental differences Canada USA Canada egalitarian society general compliance government orders high. greater sense collective “we” vs individual “me”. Charter Rights Freedoms generally states government whatever want interest public safety. mandating masks violating anyone’s rights part, 90% people done care. also never hear anyone talking rights, it’s way think day day lives. both, pal. u live America, there's 1/3 chance u comorbidity thing. Show proof came classroom beyond speculation worst seems behind us, roughly dangerous flu season right now, even though disease deadlier flu, level spread compensates that. Physically impossible. reports might already entered country 2019 misdiagnosed influenza.

Gates enough money cure Covid; don’t give shit say. So, getting downvotes, explanation. save 10-20% throwing charity staff. still paying least 50%-100% extra prepared food. 

So still paying premium someone cook you. assure going much needed discussion people complicit making pandemic worse needed be. brought justice. No. Hunker nuts still slightly better though, restrictions lower urbanization.

Again, 10 times higher density mean ""lower urbanization""? less people live need remember used 100 daily deaths back april. average 1-3 14? people ICU.

He 219 patients ICU 54% rising thanks returnees spent vacation beaches e.g. bulgaria without wearing masks etc. Cell immunity, there’s coronavirus crossover immunity, everyone’s immune system succumbs new virus anyway. miracle microbiomes r/angryupvote. sucks 40% population death cult denies reality. know, opportunity *lead*. chance put determined unified face fight, didn’t, misguided effort downplay avoid panic. calculated leadership move, wrong one. never admit mistake, continue path.
Some states stopped cooperating clear pulling marching orders straight ass, instead experts supposed listen to. governor I’d abandon plan form fight plan too. We’ve known devastating pandemic would coming years (there literally documentary Netflix last year, fake news guess) yet Trump slashed funding several arms government would hugely beneficial fighting it. are. ways explain 200k deaths but, like said, intuitive. would helpful would explain terms relatively local city disappearing completely. around number.

I live Europe, government passable job working citizens. Sure, perfect I'd much rather deal bit corruption incompetence rather live hyper-individualistic, dog-eat-dog, anarcho-capitalist dystopia like US. another example stopped paying licence fee. similar UK. national guidelines implementation county council level, councils decide increase local measures necessary (and equally national leadership advise so).

Most success (if call that) UK come implementation policy, like describe Sweden, people adopted best practices act personal responsibility. whole year. good 4 6 weeks hard lockdown. use time get cheap testing everywhere, multiple times day reduce likelihood false negatives/positives, setup tracing. open up, detect, trace isolate vaccine developed. feel like easier stay inside cold outside. There’s something called PRIMARIES 😀 *Such relationship Federal &amp; State governments.* 

Exactly. cannot Trump issuing state lockdowns. feds states needed come together plan.  Trump never plan save Americans. live America? somehow time states don’t ability police cities. Wicked, naughty, evil Zoot. Oh lmao bad confused half country gets news Facebook spends time actively discrediting fauci bound happen Places like Lowes Home Depot

It's free! thing Target contributed greatly society, contribute besides sociopathic commentary? one listens anymore. could things happened sooner? shit everything March confirmed cases state. disassembled pandemic response team, could better contained, maybe even prevented reaching US areas. Oh, OK. answers. I’m sure live one cities Pelosi wants bail $3 trillion. Yeah, one fiscally irresponsible cities proven time can’t pay bills, let’s rest country pay problems. seems fair. “Decent society”.

You placing blame society business fails. live capitalistic nation, it’s realistic mothball society demand support closed businesses. Ah, well that's unfortunately accurate assessment. Texas Arizona also see massive spikes respiratory illnesses winter. people inside. work cause anti-mask crazies would still come woodwork scream constitutional rights buy Great Value corn flakes Walmart without mask. BADA bing r/titlegore  sane people live pissed idiots dragging us backwards too. seriously believe that? :D Plus lower vitamin people worrying much weight.

I'm updating prediction 400k deaths US 600k. Thailand. still wear masks life almost normal now. Tourism business still since still strict outsiders residence normal now.

My friends live Europe. Though cases still borderline worrisome, bad life like here. I’m saying there’s pretty simple alternative lockdowns. know, man. playing Xbox Live days checks came guy said playing, ""Just got J. Donald Trump check mail!"" 

I'm kinda worried. 

And yes, say J. Donald. happy world anymore. supposed feel? guys feel?

I feel terror, exhaustion, grief world thought loss in-person visits friends family,...

I don’t recommend it, I’m hard time finding alternatives. Example: terror. *know* anxiety issues... *know* portion fear excessive - finding reputable, consistent data comparing variables across data sets full time data miner’s job. don’t spoons spare trying completely melt spend parsing data. cannot tell much fear reasonable, unreasonable. able trust mind tough.

I tried cutting reddit wasn’t deluged bad news constantly (and may try keep occasional day) occasionally need scream cry vent ether - friends family dealing don’t want drag down. try avoid talking reality much, savor time together.

... yeah. It’s kind fucked, don’t think anyone good answer it. :/ get make go along best ability navigate insane situation find in. It’s naive think contact general population 10 year old physical labor pull 8.5 hrs day without bitching, he's hired. 

Uhh, 8 years is. Yup. There's **no point** keeping bars closed dining rooms open.

You're wrong. starters, cut back number places people go to. alone limits spread. 

Secondly, people go bars looking different type interaction (in general) people going restaraunts.

Bar folks want mingle chat, want get loud, want talk potential romantic partner, want drink levels make things unsafe.

People go restaurants want keep group, eat food drink levels safer.

(These obviously generalizations)

Bar folks attend restaurants much, do, they'll met fewer folks interact with.

Plenty states (my Colorado among them) upward rise. closed bars mask orders came saw cases drop. many places, rsstaraunts open limited capacity spread controlled. 

Now, argument governments creating encouraging loophole. bar become restaraunt overnight nearly it, different story, enforcing difference two, effective policy. God's asshole. stranger sends best thoughts! Seen plenty times weeks ago France. Ridiculous. Shush, stop scaring stock prices, Fauci. Ok, feel pretty ignorant Eurocentric Sweden! idea Lakh now. Hmm, probably read more... :)

""A lakh (/læk, lɑːk/; abbreviated L; sometimes written Lac[1] Lacs) unit Indian numbering system equal one hundred thousand (100,000; scientific notation: 105).[2][1] Indian 2,2,3 convention digit grouping, written 1,00,000. example, India 150,000 rupees becomes 1.5 lakh rupees, written ₹1,50,000 INR 1,50,000.

It widely used official contexts Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka. often used Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Sri Lankan English. Pakistan, word lakh used mostly local languages rather English media."" Yes good news, think one thing us forgetting, infected children still pass school staff, parents grandparents. Definitely. I'm lucky enough familiar wealth fall back on, didn't, able afford pay rent one week work could get unemployment. forgetting months relative normalcy places populations. knowledge possible country experience short term pain drive cases down. lockdowns essentially stop transmission... sufficiently effective island countries example. 

The US lockdown wasn’t sufficiently strong never got community spread control. It’s shitshow since day one it’s important honest lasting effects. Still going get soon possible Belgian, I'm excited chance take break North.  Yeah, also likes murder children  Also ""open"" ""open"". 

Saying schools open necessarily mean thing different countries. people behave. That's Scandinavian countries generally lax mask front, things, like proper social distancing, much higher effect masks emphasized. trade functioning social distancing masks get spread instead less. However countries people shit distancing masks make bigger difference. phrase never frightening me. Cool.

Once get crippling mental illness, backlash never permitted make decisions whatsoever without getting abused for, oh, life, two absent discs back endless hunt enough money exist, I'll get right already done math. interested getting people’s impressions since media doesn’t talk total deaths aren’t much cause panic. would like know disparity people feel happening actually happening.

Total death causes recent weeks 3.9-7.7 percent average time year, almost 12,000 per week fewer peak 2017-2018 flu hoaxist. don’t believe hoax. obviously bad. don’t think many people aware current state things. 2 reasons come mind least less impacted southern european countries france. tend live different generations (lots grandparents living families southern europe) spread less vulnerable older ppl. Second thought, dont get close comfy people around us. many hugs kisses, touchy italians, spanish french. Idk really plays role potential cultural reason crossed mind.

Edit: also germans ocd clean freaks compared nations maybe urge keep things tidy sterile comes handy case Agreed. Also, may say vaccine, infected got sort immunity? admit, na zi Germans following rules government possible Exactly History teaches us 2 things: 

1 - Shit always rolls downhill.

2 - People fight claw way hill, don’t get shit on, enough people getting shit make feel better shit on, themselves. Yep, Europeans stayed China worst over. repatriations screwed everyone.

A college mine came back Shanghai Belgium february. coughing office came back. Blamed cold quite while.

Never tested arrival Belgium come directly Hubei. Went straight work day after... 

It probably nothing end appeared spread Italy Belgium still, complacency government staggering. always statistic, one massive magnifying glass since new disease (and is) chance could much worse. look numbers vacuum, consider individual stories, terrible thing. macro-perspective, close 60 million people die every year. None means take action save many people reasonably possible. So, us I'd interested see that. India young population quite possible even widespread infection death rate ends one lowest likely report dining restaurant 
(aOR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.9–4.3) going bar/coffee shop 
(aOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.5–10.1) control-participants

Is big headline. southern east coast. Fall amazing winters pretty mild. North East yeah going miserable winter there. Agreed, live Canada think it’s understandable want support local businesses, done patio season still option, get curbside order. good news considering hospitalization rate kids already miniscule. asymptomatic. need someone rally poor make realize true enemy is, team middle class overthrow top. Bernie, still there? actual holidays. Thanksgiving Xmas rough. able convince In-laws Xmas 2 weeks Dec. 25 nobody contaminates sides families, somehow think everyine same.

I even think seeing anyone Thanksgiving point. normal pneumonia last year I’m still right. love quote infectious disease doctor
""There children hospitalized COVID, really far, far, far less adults""

I would convinced, short one far. Purge middle-class ring it. Shut Modi rank? three paragraphs saying thing, decreasingly verbosity. thought funny. thing is, don’t know necessarily means restaurants source. suspect are, they’re generally smaller, closed quarters, you’re close proximity people, without mask, extended period time, etc. However, could simply attributed people go restaurants people generally flaunt COVID guidance whole. words, yeah, go restaurants, also don’t wear masks, wash hands, social distance, go parties bars, etc.

And don’t get wrong, haven’t dined restaurant since V-Day, don’t plan anytime soon. Ideally yes, really won’t know fall look like comes. Hopefully measures prevent covid successful minimizing impact flu. Otherwise it’s gonna *tough* solution general strike. can't maintain wealth without labor get kicked school parents get mad Paywall.  many kids admitted Covid 19 total?  Half 10 obviously different half 100,000.  Whining fix that. Lol siehts aus. AC gibts nur im direktor buero. Deswegen gabs bei uns auch immer erst hitzefrei wenn wir alle schon halb tod waren weil das thermometer natuerlich bei ihm vor der klimaanlage stand. Yeah, I’m starting mentally prepare possibility could last another year :(

Edited change accidental :) :(. miss lot things. takeout delivery OK. really miss live shows. year without concert season since I've adult. probably thing miss most, live music. I've watched recorded shows I've enjoyed nothing matches live show. However, opened local venues tomorrow COVID still circulating attend. Spreading thing worth it. People wanted post “this”, “this right here” feel stupid someone else already stolen thunder slightly creative, albeit equally annoying way ??? think university meeting contractural obligations here; you’re trying really abstract appeal “fairness” exist.

These adults broke contract. want get medical advise one makes 50k year less 20k savings jist like majority Americans. 
That way tell hunker try go work stay safe itll mean alot since barely afford live too, instead multi millionaire afford spend month private chef one many homes. Agreed, mask laws important.

But don’t lose hope! grocery store, work, (along mask laws) reduce exposure might get, simply actions. Wipe off/disinfect groceries get home. Wash hands/sanitizer take mask off. Learn proper mask etiquette (including safely apply remove it!!!). Wear sunglasses face shield prevent people talking &amp; inadvertently spraying spit eyes. Wear gloves high-contact areas, discard use. Properly sterilize mask use. Keep least 2m away others, indoors outdoors. Clean house regularly, especially high-contact areas doorknobs switches. visit people, visit outdoors, weather still nice, instead inside. Keep sanitizer car regularly clean hands. Etc. find they’re also getting free lunch. It’s communism everyone else and, god damnit, that’s *my* money deserve it! Screw Pelosi! 

(This mentality even Pelosi sponsor bill) made well six figures decade, Corona. opportunities, guaranteed like before. mindset. lot people, luck determines lot life. rags-to-rags rags-to-riches stories. adults look see anyone drive thru flu clinic. I'm lucky mine kids doctors taking seriously. I'm worried getting vaccination. offices call letting us one one straight room. waiting room now. Thanks answering! windows open while?

Our school also AC anything. Ventilation entirely windows. I'm nervous happen cold open windows all. Huh? so?

I really see restrictions social life. Cafes restaurants open, social fun places open. 
You meet others public even home. 

Heck, even gyms, churches, bars casinos open. Edit: mentioned other: clubs open! 

Only Exception: large concerts large parties. 

What taking about? Excuse me, meant type 1/3rd would incorrect. 45 total 100 seats would closer almost half voting power Senate. Total don’t know. preliminary studies. Lots heart/lung lingering issues comes those. There's delay infection symptoms tracing ... think we're seeing result relaxed summer, party-goer youngsters spent time extended family family events summer, thus creating multiple ""family clusters"". BTW, that's frenchs doctors seeing days : active circulation virus within family groups, opposed within companies.

eta : we'll see ""Rentrée"" done epidemic within week reckon, still summer clusters massive testing raising numbers.

edit2 : btw, issues testing too, since waiting list get tested long (up 3 weeks), peopel register various testing centers get tested multiple times, thus multiplying number positive tests. Maybe genetics plays part? discord “fair” lol Shockingly? It’s virus. ebb flow. isn’t shocking new way. We’ve known centuries. Small uptick week, nothing major, still bit scary. wonder it’s due increased testing spread?

You probably killed commenter.

/s virus well controlled

Key phrase right Like neighbours Based QC. schools really going fuck us. walking street (in France) high school got out. wave 150 teenagers walking 6 across sidewalk sides, single mask on, possible stay 6 feet away unless I'm middle street. Kids sharing vapes la bise. live parents. kid giant POS Mate, youre one making strawmen freaking out, playing victim simple comment, lol workers bars restaurants?? owners? go business? 

Also zoom holiday sounds fucking ridiculous, months think people going give one time usually get see families. Humans social creatures, can’t keep replacing online stuff. doesn’t work. live alone? Zoom Christmas sure great huh often get called sheep? Wearing mask isn’t hard, people complaining masks stupid. It’s shutting schools down, workplaces down, restaurants making people annoyed. huge crowds gather protest pretend they’re engaging behavior act bring apocalypse happen concert beach party. Hahahahahaha. Nazi General spoken. virus nothing cold control freedoms. banking NWBTCW
We hunker suffer.
They rest home worry free. Oh yes, would terribly uncomfortable people well. I'm stating would take safe, say feasible. thinking lot really way people near safely though. I've thought dividers, air circulation systems, suits air supplies less intrusive now. Nothing thought workable though. solution separation unfortunately. Outdoor seating something help 100% safe either mind. difference ICU compared yesterday:

13 people covid-19 cared intensive care. 14 21 regions without patient ICU.

Hospitalised patients around 125 death counts lag regional overview (in English: data overview.  
Today's reported deaths occured September 1 September 3, 2020.

The **worst affected regions** regarding new cases Västra Götaland (94), Stockholm (52), Skåne (45), Jönköping (27), Dalarna (24).

Västra Götland, Skåne Stockholm include three biggest cities 54 % Swedish population, Dalarna stands 280k inhabitants mostly characterised medium sized cities/towns rural areas.

From tomorrow, Saturday September 12, Swedish travellers able travel Finland UK without requirement quarantine.

New infections per 100k, nationwide last 14 days, around 25/100k cases, similar level Norway (22), higher Finland (8), much lower Denmark (40)  
This might due differences testing course, used determine border openings throughout pandemic. Sweden 126k tests last week, positivity rate 1.3 %. sacrificed six months youth. He’s practically hero. Deserves Purple Heart everything. soldier, guy. means carrying it... necessarily showing symptoms. Welp House, cars, kids, spouse?
My property taxes alone $20 per day don’t even live big residence. It’s insane rights workers America. weak useless unions compared employers? . lived Germany back late 80s parents knew, introduced schools. one filled capacity, majority students, light end tunnel.

You see, USA classes usually crowded. HS graduation students cannot afford University left going directly work (unskilled) joining military.
In Germany least had, training opportunity HS mandatory military.  Lmfao hilarious reading comments people take Trump's jokes literally Eh people scared. Also lot people ability deal prolonged lock get it. hope vaccine comes soon. getting old. can't FORCE people stay homes, especially America. simply set legally. mechanism constitution sort thing that's martial law. suggesting disgusting federal overreach would direction Trump would absolutely terrified of. Fuck noise. death rate France ridiculously low? death rate country running 5% number infections. Compared first wave, virus become lot less deadly. ...or, wear mask. awful one virus virus awful. Marsh v Alabama needs extended virtual space. Okay I’m done arguing here. metrics google search away, look yourself. see positivity rate mostly august. Also, first major spike “useless timeframe”? It’s good way view trends compare current numbers, clearly ignore Oh fuck off, I'm going skiing, snowmobiling, normal yearly ski trip winter shitty ill golfing too.

I hunkered months, time vulnerable people hunker bullshit. there's concerted effort part information transmission institutions last 40 50 years expressly uneducate radicalize vast swaths country. 

Yes, politicians MSM. happening forever, better access us now. Ironically, even Newsweek article example. Hey dumbified Americans, country **was lying ""politician""** already jail.

Or US ""democracy""

- fucking fraud
- fucking sham
- fucking corrupt
- fucking nepotism
- fucking criminal
- fucking flawed  like all. Oh boi fauci’s depressed? Tell don’t understand response school threaten permanently close person learning kid keeps showing up. wouldn’t grown man, would student? actually double. want puke every time number cases comes up, IQ call media depressing. matter Spain Florida 100.000 cases long protect elderly who's risk. 

The second wave sure ""young health wave"" wildfire smoke western Washington already hunkered back down. Guess I'm ready anything! :/ shouldn’t we? Deaths deaths. That’s downside whole freedom speech thing America. everybody believes right regardless wrong freedom speech CANT SILENCE BLAH BLAH. Even American see entitled country become. Look Europe lol. fauci wanted do. panic. Huh... Good. okay, dont worry, stubbornness problem Yeah well schools wanted paycheck. guess worth spreading covid causing deaths. beyond infuriating much people care. Right, hopefully vaccine comes early next year covid thing past Florida dealing Gov Desantis definitely taking us far rabbit hole never see daylight. Trumps mini me. 
This week Desantis said BARS open. bar normally serve food microwave cook HotPocket Crockpot full chili open. month Fla back list #1. That's course assuming dumping 50 million shares Amazon open market tank price everyone quarter brain knows fantasy. Yep. 538 currently Biden 75% chance winning- also Hillary 78 IIRC. states Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania tipped Trump last moment.

Currently 3 play modestly favoring Biden. Florida anyone's guess. 

Even Trump loses, he's probably going go screeching rigged. electoral college system depressing time vaccine ready, bully say.  Lmao, oddly fitting &lt;3 went pick carryout favorite Mexican place scene saw. Note bar left everyone sitting side-by-side masks. follow it. Last week New York adjusted up. says “likely” again, throw recent week tends quite accurate. Follow yourself. showing excess deaths any.  Manufacturing distributing successful vaccine grand total 9 months discovery virus injecting vaccine *anyone* would, fact, miracle. Don’t know you’re arguing that. would *far* quickest developed vaccine history mankind. Still frustrating whole horror would've likely resolved (1) weeks actual lockdown &amp; (2) access actually rapid testing.

We're numb understandable, also frustrating. mentioned steps still taken proper mentality. Doesn’t Brazil daily record per capita?  made state state thing *Preeeetty* sure there’s happy medium “we’re gonna die” “it’s big deal, it’ll disappear own” even talking COVID past November lol (other Democrats tried destroy country using it) He’s fighting born.

And time he's never accomplished damn thing. sad. hate Bibi much next Israeli comparing Trump seriously insulting. I’d go Putin. mean Bibi legit smart guy survived long due political wisdom. He’s definitely corrupt fuck hope see ending behind bars Trump definitely isn’t. Thank you. trust science, able take level-headed policy decisions, balancing needs entire society.

You peddling fear, reverted failed provide evidence, actually proven brutal misconceptions virus literally spends time crying Unemployment subreddit. really sure he's worth time. I’m arguing arguments, I’m saying arguments comment basically “no you” provided nothing arguments did. lock people half year, yeah they're gonna get bored start things killed around ten times annual flu deaths, we're 8 months ramping. go ahead pretend dangerous. 1) keep essentials going wait vaccine / let active cases slowly drop reopen get bearably low. 


2) reopen enough let virus spread slowly, everyone gets slow pace that's manageable health infrastructure.



3) open get everyone sick millions die walk away thinking ""hey made fine see? small percentage population."" 


Pick poison. Yeah talking mine guess lol Dem candidate high unfavorables, lot folks assumed would win.

I think overestimate Biden's favorability. seems like bit Wall Street bubble ask me. proving point then. 9/11 massive overreaction. response virus. 

Did know 9 million people die year hunger? acceptable you? sit hands people starve everyday generally live life? Yup, state still 10% positive climbing they’re opening everything 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♂️ grew concerned day lockdown announced Wuhan. Figured would spread worldwide lockdown place respiratory people gonna congregate travel. I'm statistician psychology professor. Basic understanding human behavior, viruses, math easily predicted outcome. I've played Pandemic. mutation bit realistic, transmission features fairly accurate. 

Warned whole family friends. bought P100 masks, filters, hand sanitizer, alcohol, gloves, etc., way back early February. felt like maybe overreacting, sent stuff family told please use items ever became necessary. are.

My dad calls least every week say ""you called it. Surely statistician government could seen coming!"" whole family overwhelmingly depressed whole thing. risk factors. sister MS. asthma autoimmune disease. dad two heart attacks. mom 65. last call dad said ""If shut everything February month like suggested, we'd this. human economic losses much greater. hear Trump knew serious was?!"" fucking infuriating. whole situation infuriating. one student known Covid infection. Two suspected. Four already lost family members it. cry students get kicked major. I'm sure I'm going cope one dies. get 50% capacity thing. restaurants never seem operate 100% capacity anyway. restaurants except masks business usual. That's happens PM cares curroption trials barely minds economic health crisis country.

**never submit demagogues** Quite hoops jump there. Perhaps zero indication virus measures used non-virus combatting purposes could get pass. Unfortunately, stopped case long ago. Basically. insurance lobbies hard keep system is. that's like it. Serious question: likely see surge cold months? Netherlands advise wear masks obligatory cities

This plain wrong, mask experiments outside public transport stopped per 1 september, nowhere mandatory outside public transport. RIVM explicitly states masks needed private literature* offer clear consensus effect wearing non-medical face masks public spaces. seems likely face masks help prevent infecting others, limited extent. everyone follows basic rules, necessary wear face mask. comments... can't. Idiocracy real it’s happening now. dunno, point dragon burning everything seems like good plan. Yup, zero doubt people going family get togethers inside kiddos return college/school. think that’s flu season always spikes winter, it’s everyone traveling see family. people travel year see family far away usually Christmas thanksgiving. Excuse calling us wildlings? hospitals handle spike fine sympathise people US. India, highest number global case count. positive sign number people successfully treated relatively less number deaths. 

The government acting like ostrich. mainstream media focusing accountability government instead hounding something inane, think many people believe write down. 

The people taking equally lightly, something that's already dealt with.

Right now, feel hope success vaccine. First miracle. 


This vaccine manufactured speak available essential high risk people beginning. everything goes well ordinary people get vaccinated somewhere around next year. got timeline wrong anybody date knowledge please correct me.


Don't expect get vaccine 3 months, expect approved instead Pennsylvania would like word Where? state, MN, active cases time high last week. ""Isn't deadly""

""Killed 250k people far.""

Pick one. Yeah, can’t leave alone. thought loved “personal freedom” Good know 190.000 Americans die ""statistical error""

There several European countries counts every case covid-19 within 30 days, even died hit bus. returned US pandemic avoided healthcare seriously distrust system. I'll never believe insurance covered never feel like ailments worth likely debilitating debt. dunno man. seen Astoria month ago so, government cracked down.

Blocks blocks drunk people smashed together like sardines. Sure, ""outdoors"", idiocy days exclusive us white folk. I'm NYC I'm still surprised hit second wave, we're start opening indoor activities (limited capacity) we'll see changes anything.  would people wearing masks taking seriously, addition TP rationing?  *Looks computer*

""Times up."" sure never got 2 week quarantine, neither friends work food industry. ""The whole country"" never locked down. are, stubborn consider even seen work. truly crazy. There's also narrative everyone buys here: ""the U.S. far worst Coronavirus response world"", insane. one metric really matters (deaths per capita), we're better UK Spain, par Sweden Italy. No, done well compared Germany/South Korea's world, we're crazy outlier. here, friend. IRS still processing 2019 amended return since made small mistake fixed March.

They say they'll *probably* fix December. :( question regarding gyms.

Would safe go gym 2-3 hours everyone left alone? Wearing simple cloth mask (better breathability), touching face/eyes? Okay let's try then.

There second wave NYC. *Impossible.* sincerely hope correct. hope peddling possibly unsafe stance caution push anyone act foolishly times.

Edit: impossible statement sarcasm and, kids, biology teacher terrible influence, clearly asserted position authority level barely have. won't. least us Healthcare seeing organ damage numbers rise.

We're going treating effects fucking decades. Comparing numbers deaths irrelevant? Deaths deaths. ones special? don’t understand irrelevant. account use messenger, that's for. even use real name anymore. reports antibodies SARS-CoV-2 maintained serum following recovery virus caused alarm. However, absence specific antibodies serum necessarily mean absence immune memory.""


Do understand clonal selection theory active immune response? expect antibodies decline, prevents disastrous immune overreactions. really, really good example scientific, Dunning-Kruger illiteracy. tells different story tho, no? know thats debunked  extra safe, cyclists given prophylactic doses steroids. Israeli here. live next huge Haredim city (Bnei Brak) there’s synagogue street me. week ago reported multiple infections among visitors. Every day take look home office see bunch fuckers gather around reinfecting one another. religious dude work (not physically thank god) caught whole family celebrating wedding. hope guys tell ya. It’s like images Brooklyn didn’t penetrate thick skulls. Fauci described current situation ""whack-a-mole,

That's funny coincidence, least 35% US population brain size exactly one mole, *are* due good whack... Newsweek garbage website. They just cherry-pick says. says lot good things bad things talks. tried watching video two minutes long, turn minute half contained two sentences him, followed bunch electronic music ADHD style, context ""stats."" 

Even graph show misleading graph Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dashboard, showing reported cases U.S. dropped around 17,000 since late March.

Yes, rest country infected. late March mostly happening Seattle NYC, areas much better. look trajectory newly infected cases, also going down. look daily death rates, peaked April, came back much smaller peak mid July, also going down.

The US great job handling virus, that's clear, stories like meant fear-monger. I'm really tired media hijacking brains like this. I'm closer punching people face ever wanted be.  Thank sharing. time saw recommendations masks context ""there's enough medical professionals need more. part staying home need mask."" likely due large? Viruses spread, hit different regions different times.

And airborn virus like - way eliminate it. spread, right? people refuse wear masks bad enough, never understand people actively complain people *are* wearing mask. US doomed DNC Hilldog kept Bernie primaries 2015. Everything that's happened since inevitability. ...the last 6 months literally nothing scientists doctors begging people act responsibly. governments telling people act responsibly.

England came ""don't kill nan"" slogan. 

These University students, 4 year olds. They've hearing message ad nauseam. They're purposefully deciding listen.

Because they're selfish idiots. 

And ""fucking something"" caps, real suggestion back up, exactly useful ""shaming internet"" deriding. Fauci talking about? Daily cases declining since mid-July... people get angry thought 30 per day? winter mean cases? winter mean places like Az Texas nicer weather people stay outside more?  Nature always finds way🙏 Oh UK screwed making 100+k year 10 - 17 dollars nothing.

When making $100K year, enough direct deposits high enough average daily balance fees waived. bank loaning money profiting way, willing forego monthly fees. Thsnk input. brand new, know long term. think live fantasy land. amount money government would need pay people hunker going lot. Probably years salary, people won’t able pay back. I’m sure don’t understand. already live paycheck paycheck, afford pay back government debt form taxes? indoor vegetable garden,

What kind solution this? 😂😂

""Spend $300 get garden stood might get 12 tomatoes May 2021"" LA County Health Director spilled beans got caught tape saying schools would reopen ""after election."" many supposed virus measures zero virus everything getting people vote certain way. ""Also seventh grade watched grow seventh grade man 42 passed away, didn’t lose coach, lost one kids,”

42 number you’re referring likely single day percentage, week 8/9/20 positivity rate already 9.5% according Georgia’s department health website. Since week’s positivity averaging 8.2-9%, acceptable say really significant change, minor improvement. Also, states first spike around March-April, wasn’t northeastern states. However, size spike different state; Georgia’s smaller New York example, still one. Yeah. “May live interesting times” potent curse...

I want boring desperately now. brain straight up, thousand-yard-stare broken today. Like could I’d try taking mental health day, that’s kind tricky boss vacation... least I’m working home, west coast. feel y’all - wildfires something straight nightmares. like Jeff Goldblum Jurrasic Park. Maybe appoint 'blum president? Haha haha laughing sheep True, unlike India, trending downwards. Parents care children coughing. kid already tested twice (both negative btw), many kids whose parents know.

So kindly stop making bullshit. even German clearly know nothing situation here.  sub wishes us run like North Korea. Morons bar! Open fire! previous story read unequivocal everyone party positive. mean laughably stupid finge opinions absolutely spreading social media. anecdotally see spreading straight mind blowingly dumb conspiracy theory videos post. still sure banning shit right buy slippery slope argument verboten talk next. messed up.  Also remember wear mask, downplayed severity disease even though knew deadly compared flu?

You lead example. started stuff maybe cronies would follow suit mandate it. obese people often eat risk  Arizona: gotta pump rookie numbers. poor shareholder hope money make money? Think rich. New York 447,000 cases 32,000 deaths, including 45,000+ cases 2,000+ deaths Suffolk County kid lives. truly known nobody impacted firsthand? sort twisted ""Right Die"" campaign? Never. like invented social inequity. humans lived thousands years. Woodward responsible well. get sat information trump, bullshit call trump sooner trump lying ass pandemic. Maybe trump would forced admit problem sooner thousands people may still alive.

Don't get wrong, place blame squarely trump, Woodward kind fucking asshole waiting long. hear you. Moving really giving second thoughts. can't believe unbelievably selfish people are. again, here...it's everywhere country. think anyone saying can't visit family things friends.

That... actually *is* they're saying. 

This thread reminding dumb ""average"" is... RemindMe! 3 weeks  Deaths lag cases 2-3 weeks least. Another ""study"" confirms common sense. You're... ignoring everyone contact?

They arrive stay airport. Let us hope *you* receive sort concern *your* life concerned shown others. participate protests. support BLM, feared safety, virus violent response protesters many police departments. 

To answer second question, answer seen unpopular among controversial. trust people protested someone willing risk life safety protest injustice, probably lot understanding knowledge world general likely unselfish personality. would thus inclined keep mind current pandemic situation try distance themselves, avoid close contact wear masks. 

On hand, people partying attending sports events time, likely part demographics either (1) still believe pandemic complete hoax (2) still dont understand / know seriousness pandemic (3) compassion others, especially essential medical personnel lost lives still battling pandemic. People best described either ignorant fools idiots. 

Thus, (and presume others) trust first group second one. value lives second group less though. Every human life intrinsic value, cared for. wish hope everyone, matter are, protected dreadful disease hopefully recover soon this. happens country Executive Orders flat abolished forever, wonder. Mental exercise. WTF? left 17 year teaching career Florida. put house sale, family relocating northern state taking virus seriously. heartbroken angry. Take Vitamin people. Right vaccine comes along, Vitamin thing PROVEN ""prevent"" ""treat"" Covid 19.  funny thing people they're arguing healthy enough worry wearing mask people educated virus care enough health want deal complications arise even asymptomatic cases. people want wear masks people want careful value health.

I swear mask people void health insurance refuse treatment 10 year period pay dumb decisions get surprisepikachu.jpg complications completely preventable disease. Like, beginning get it, warned excuse now. American Samoa recorded infection far now.

Because Samoans literal superpeople. fuck replying something 5 months ago? people talking US go ""whatabout India"" people might take downplaying things here. sort stuff kinda fallen favor recently. Thats point, US bad mostly thing reddit. place society actually thought bernie would president we’d perpetual lockdown.  hand, we've never demand. Lol. 🤷‍♀️ country’s citizens even coming America?? think smart come cesspool. angry telling people something possible. bills pay. owes world keepingThe United States check. Let guess. party's go bars? Well assuming already aren't. Maybe that's good assumption. apply you, ignore part. Michigan Winters get cold here. Maybe deal that. gap rich poor worst history country. completely separate issue

Actually isn't. issue created capitalism continues today capitalism. really think people benefit slave labor would willingly give rob gas station shot guy leg make license plates 40 hours week pick trash interstate. don’t huge problem that.

So deciding whether okay enslave people based hypothetical? assume everyone prison robbed gas station shot guy leg? constitution specify crime must violent justify slavery. fact, let give different hypothetical:

Suppose lost something trash, took dumpster. go digging dumpster looking cop passes by. tell looking something believe you. sudden jail time stealing trash (yes, actually crime capitalist countries). forced work pay. get cell really bad food, free leave. system think either successful good likely light privileges pure slavery.

You get put limits it. CAPITALISM talking about. rich supposed grow wealth can't use slaves see fit? mean legal vote candidate change that...try socialism.

In case aware, socialist countries usually also democracies, yes, would gladly vote candidate would change socialism. fact, socialist country, could probably vote mail 50 states. covid would died similar diseases unfortunately. Especially elder care home, already lower health, cant take care well. Anyone dying unfortunate course, happy thing. Getting sick scary indoor dining safe people distancing. may help reduce risk little bit helps reduce exposure droplets Covid aerosoles still huge risk, especially unventilated place AC people produce lots saliva constantly spit they're chewing talking.  Hard predict. Europe heading winter months November probably month might notice cases start rise many countries previously suppressed. good news EU countries excellent testing infrastructure pick far cases before, they'll likely see waves weeks get bad. almost certainly get levels terms deaths March/April, even cases eclipse early numbers. stayed home 15 month old can't wear mask take plane. Protest board members lawn. like fact education actively sabotaged this

Your education sabotaged idiots (government, trump administration, young people article etc) aren’t taking seriously, scientists health officials pointing out. everyone (the government citizens) done supposed earlier on, economy could back running.  tefl schools able get teachers country, international students unless FPT though :/ Global entry fantastic everywhere entered back Houston. Every country better Houston. Fuck IAH TSA. Oh yeah, mines jsut frustration guests, mother pain, limited 50 ppl cousins may able go. never said contract virus home. implying can't hide indefinitely virus, mean look NZ. 

To extent, people take personal responsibility... seen picture her?

To summarize *for others* might read attempts misinformation, are:

* studies show *healthcare workers* use medical grade respirator masks surgical masks, **DUH**;
* studies show respirator masks filter better surgical cloth masks, **DUH**;
* studies dealing seasonal influenza pandemic definitely SARS-CoV, **again**!;
* study actually SARS-CoV masks behold ***retracted!***;
* studies surgical masks wound infection surgery rooms, Way go **tangent** buddy;
* studies hypoxia’s effect viral immunology even though surgical masks significantly reduce oxygen intake, nice **red herring;**
* personal favorite- *commentary, study* that’s used anti-maskers “proof” ignoring part authors **STILL recommend wearing masks** pandemic long followed part comprehensive preventative system like social distancing, avoidance indoor spaces especially bad ventilation, etc. Basically everything already said.

Excuses, excuses! Don’t want wear mask? avoid people *completely* together. justify ignoring pandemic experts masks. Lockdowns **way effective** anyway stupid anti-maskers also anti-lockdowns bother stupidity begin with.

BTW I'm done OP. waste time obstinate anti-mask narrative. post theories r/science r/askscience see say there? fun. Goodbye forever Mr. ""Bill Gates conspiring kill us all"" Dumbass. agree. given option bankruptcy stay open despite reservations. government offering assistance right now. able remain closed March-August due assistance government assistance offered employees. know would safer restaurants closed can't bring money can't pay debtors restaurants similar boats (we actually far less debt most) far reaching economic tolls beyond individual businesses. government offered assistance would close tomorrow. think order restaurants bars closed transmission rate extremely low contact tracing testing employed effective levels. make plan UBI, support opening up. choice. bills still go paid. white-collar workers give shit anyone themselves.

Wow, quality evidence claim! await next riveting analysis. whoever suffering world allowed sad it. Everyone else supposed consider lucky they're guy. I'm real sick tired people understanding importance mental health. Yes need careful take precautions, important find stuff spiral pit depression takes years come of. Coronavirus likes this. thing called ""utility bill"" pay. Can't staying home. US country spreading cases countries

Just call ""democracy virus"" it’s still around non pandemic levels able open back up? able move out, work, family? nightmare stuff keeps awake. happened 260,000? free without others servicing me? daily pocket spending basically zero days. senior citizens office? the...usually..senior citizens invited students back campus? *again*, belief hundreds thousands doctors healthcare workers zero morals push unsafe medication across country.


I guess start looking alternative medicine? 😂 here. I'm long-hauler fevers 99F 103F since February. Every time I've medical facility last 7 months, IR forehead thermometers read 99F. CFR bad measure impact. Covid long term impacts besides death. curious hear exactly saying say gets downvoted makes say that.

He/she probably gets downvoted claim scientist proceed offer analysis. side things, warning people go *permanent* damage isn’t helpful either. Like said, it’s new disease, months data, long-term studies. *permanent* could couple months damage. New Yorkers geez, don’t anti-science.. wear mask!! shopping grocery store

My experience area Atlanta suburbs mask compliance grocery stores pretty much 99%.

Restaurants longer capacity restrictions GA though.  dined outside couple times, mostly curbside. 2 places enjoy go inside pick food. N95's really worried, places bar areas packed maskless older people probably comorbidities. Did... anyone ever thing going ""completely"" safe? Obviously never is... risk acceptable and, honestly, necessary. scary?

The [weekly shows increased testing 30% compared previous (65k test week 34 85 week 35). positive note, percent test came back positive lowest point 1.6% test coming back positive, compared week prior 2.7%. (Page 17, Weekly report) misleading: Czech far actual infections deaths hospitalizations April now. true Hungary. Poland. Austria. say worse true, least yet. 

France Spain also set daily records recorded daily cases - chance current (and bad!) surge anywhere near bad, let alone worse, April, 1k deaths probably around 100k new infections daily hit. certainly far worse aforementioned countries surge, anything relative western Europe really changed.

Somewhere like Romania, Albania, Bulgaria exceptions countries mentioned article - things *actually* worse first wave. Far (actual) infections, hospitalizations deaths ie, worse. Exactly. folks live misconstrue news order defend indefensible positions. people going work think others aren’t well? Maybe that’s disconnect here. 

She took risks jobs, wasn’t exposed students...which article insinuating, connection work illness stated regardless. Here's latest case/death charts Los Angeles, running 7-day appear turning corner new cases, although deaths still elevated. 

Los Angeles currently art 60.45 deaths per 100k population, bit US per capita average. Same, least wait 2 weeks. Unlikely. Contrary German Nazis would like think much uniquely German genome. squat middle Europe kinds tribes migrated shed genes. Whatever genetic factor exists Germans must also exist many European places. expect vaccine safe? I’m trying sound anti vax anything, know lot people economic incentive get thing fast possible. don’t necessarily trust government put safety economy (they’re already proving currently). makes vaccine different? masked since March. take virus seriously. friend said many deaths labeled Covid hospitals get funding. true?? I’m certain, last spring checking numbers daily France testing much lower rate European countries (eg Spain) US. feeling missed lot cases first wave. Bitcoin? US ""socialists"" want adopt policies Sweden, norway, Denmark, Germany etc socialists?
When people want M4A, working transport infrastructure education system like nations socialists?

I'm confused, that's exactly right wing saying...

Its like ""socialists"" US want US become Venezuela soviet union...
They want policies politics average American... totally agree weight one component health, don’t encourage anyone eat fast food diet. weight really important part health, someone eats trash stays thin least mitigating risk severe health issues.

I don’t think people know means satiated anyone. 1080 calorie Big Mac meal eaten one sitting doesn’t satiate someone, they’re extreme outlier. People aren’t aware body’s signals full. You’re right—part they’re raised parents bad eating habits, never learn otherwise.

I think make many excuses obesity without giving enough real information. don’t think anyone hate themselves, don’t think 70% adults slowly killing children, either. Overeating treated way treat smoking excessive alcohol use. sound like someone whose head far ass looking “positive” news ignoring reality. can’t see good bad sides stories like this, (willfully not) ignorant whole picture. thought would wait ten years ten days happen. get free 128 oz pop, asking friend? college kid know kids found way keep cops parties doubt kids actually tested. say everyone inside infected, fuck gonna verify breakup party? Wow telling people mental illness grow beyond fucked Testing changing quickly (up 50% past couple weeks) case numbers hard judge. We’ll know week two.

I suspect 2 weeks school every kid parents cold symptoms, like normal year. 99% colds aren’t Covid many get tested (which good!). Ironically seasonal colds maybe actually help suppress Covid someone regular cold + asymptomatic/early Covid might get tested cold symptoms discover infection. sort [the table total cases per million population, see US far ahead Europe, except San Marino. Europe getting worse, lot catching US website shit mobile. This. there's one thing hoard prices go inflation, soap, basic old fashioned bars soap.

Oh go zero-waste can, much less stuff disinfect bring back home single-use. cheaper long run too.

Reusable fabric wipes especially save time space money fronts, form hankerchiefs, reusable toilet wipes, clothpads, clothdiapers, kitchen cloth dry dishes wipe surfaces, purpose wipes house cleaning. shear volume gain shock you. less things need get shopping for. 

Toilet wipes litterally saved ass toilet-paper crazed lockdown days. 

## Abstract

COVID-19 new respiratory illness caused SARS-CoV-2, constituted global public health emergency. Recent studies demonstrated cat susceptible SARS-CoV-2. However, prevalence SARS-CoV-2 cats remains largely unknown. Here, investigated infection SARS-CoV-2 cats COVID-19 outbreak Wuhan serological detection methods. cohort serum samples collected cats Wuhan, including 102 sampled COVID-19 outbreak, 39 prior outbreak. Fifteen sera collected outbreak positive receptor binding domain (RBD) SARS-CoV-2 indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among them, 11 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies titer ranging 1/20 1/1080. serological cross-reactivity detected SARS-CoV-2 type II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). addition, continuously monitored serum antibody dynamics two positive cats every 10 days 130 days. serum antibodies reached peak 10 days first sampling, declined limit detection within 110 days. data demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infected cats Wuhan outbreak provided serum antibody dynamics cats, providing important reference clinical treatment prevention COVID-19.

In south 3 bises, like one enough. see way less people tho, still less before. I'd happy never la bise without passing associal weirdo. It’s probably deadly anyone given age, age profile people getting infected much younger now, look like IFR gone down.

Could also due increased testing. I’ve got family friends didn’t die covid. sell home live rest lives nursing home.

Germany mass demonstrations Berlin masks done nutjobs...

Not better Tour France, especially given run cov\*\*idiot demographic outright thinks Covid conspiracy basically distancing mask wearing.

It hurt read fine print eligibility requirements local credit union. numbers France Spain, new cases positivity rates (Spain 10 %, France 5+ %), scary That's even including wind chill, gets *windy* here. I'm sure misleading is: central eastern Europe barely cases summer, least compared west. Either extreme lack testing, genuinely milder first wave - followed abandonment precautions, masks.

That said, lack care shown summer might mean trend could reversed relatively easily. ""attended teacher workshops""

Just kidding, probably simply better contact tracing mask wearing delay infections. couldnt believe hearing radio yesterday NFL back, fans stadiums. JFC Yep, nothing turns gals like breaking saran wrap happy time. Lockdowns delayed inevitable.

Which... literally point lockdowns, least sold us Americans. thing never going end without vaccine... wanted make sure overload healthcare system. Or... least initial goal. - test results jumped 60%, really little idea actual infections unless everyone tested day. Well, schools open week now. True fact... Fairly often winter (not time, course, coldest days), we're colder Mars South Dakota. one widest range temperatures planet. like guy responding says ""no"" one comment later admits right. Man didn’t wear mask last flu season you’re crazy. flu awful last year. seeing sick sister’s entire family got started wearing mask went out. elderly parents stayed away grandchildren winter one sick Christmas. Two months later covid hit masks mandatory. always careful washing hands (I used lot bargain thrifting touching lot things last flu season). don’t think leave house without mask ever again, tbh. easiest thing ensure don’t get anyone sick I’m asymptomatic staying since government isn’t jack shit help keep people home digging stuff resell again.

Source \[ZIP-file!\]: still seeing 1000's new cases daily.

We still people calling hoax.

We still public social gatherings people maintaining adequate social distancing.

America royally fucked called way back Jan February saw shit starting. Everything unfolding early warnings predicted. Airborne, highly contagious virus cant stopped bootstrap society America. incompetent government selfish citizens. empire verge collapse, thing sustaining us abundance wealth continues siphoned top 1% 1% experience I'm -- kids 'bubbles' 6 so, wear masks around, larger setting wear them. Russians voted Trump. Oh wait, Americans this.  

Don't worry, Americans stupidity enough themselves, conspiracy required. Schools Georgia open around month, 7 day average cases, positivity rate, hospitalizations, deaths dropped past 30 days. Georgia seen well controlled. Individual schools yes, province wide unlikely. Outside metro Vancouver area, cases minimal. Vancouver Island includes Victoria seeing less 3 cases day

Outside Kelowna outbreak control, entirety interior health seeing max 5 cases day

It's really Vancouver surrounding areas hard hit Goddammit, take upvote get out. one stupid spandex neck things see mouth through

I understand one all. drawbacks wearing actual, effective mask literally none benefits. people kick scream wear mask suddenly they're ok wearing one those? What’s true lockdown? essential workers out? Police national guard keeping people homes force? virus would come straight back anyway also got better treating it, blood thinners steroids help.


but we're still going get 2nd wave.. want avoid overrun hospitals month? trials month. month health workers getting vaccinated tell trails won't. family friends across US.  

While Facebook convenient found life better got rid it. use email text messaging keep touch. contacts meaningful relationships stronger. Personal recommendation use month two then, without looking it, ask really miss it. maybe go month. work maybe one folks genuinely uses well. say ""until november"" ""after halloween"". best completely tone deaf. inappropriate use election timing event something politicised intending political. watching replays PSG - Lens yesterday fans stands. seems odd looking map linked bottom. 

 

Its like... ""SPAIN, DOING!!"" Ding ding ding! money Pfizer. Big fighting battles. Good news! Better getting virus right? nobody getting tested, can’t new cases nobody gets tested. knowledge? Yes. Social distancing, masks, increased testing. deadly pandemic. near 99% survival rate. April, yes. Compared month half ago, no. recent rise real yet nearly bad spring. Yet.

Every country accurate picture April. one enough tests let alone enough testing. imagine spikes countries going easier handle. still alot need crack asap. problem keeping schools shut also harmful long run. cousin who's year 11 really hard time online learning. subjects mainly STEM wealthy tho, idk jow others. I'm sorry people terrible options. Hang there, keep right yourself. Far UVC light won't. 222nm wavelength enough penetrate viruses human skin even eyes. r/Americabad Holy crap dude, stupid. percentage US population guys think Covid19? CDC estimates real number infections 11X official number, range 6X-24X. 11X would mean 22% US population virus, seems bit high me, guys think? Thank you. truly is. Know people relate helps find solace. Same. Borders. Circuit City. Virgin Megastore. Poof, gone. resume 20’s nothing companies longer exist. again, literally flattening curve means. FLAT CURVE, flattening peak.

That's exactly meant. Rt 1 leads exponential growth. entire point control strategy prevent inevitably overload hospital still never properly addressed first wave either.

That's incompetence lack leadership national level. It’s aLready roof due virus itself. welcome, troll. Highights:


- airline keeping middle seats open vigilantly enforcing mask use, flying actually rather dangerous. Currently, domestic airlines keeping middle seats open include Delta, Hawaiian, Southwest JetBlue....


- real danger traveling flight itself. However, going security waiting gate plane dock likely put close contact people increase chances contracting virus. addition, boarding — plane's ventilation system running people unable stay distanced one another — one riskiest parts travel process. ""Minimizing time period important reduce exposure,"" wrote Corsi. ""Get seat mask sit quickly possible.""

- Since U.S. many confirmed cases, difficult determine exactly somebody contracted virus. ​ kid understand that. It’s chose. wouldn’t travel even normal times raising newborn child let alone pandemic. needs top comment. panic now.
We'll see 2 weeks though. probably terrible April mostly young people caught disease summer. cases low time opening? percent? Hope stay safe too. nightmare. competition. juvenile way looking things. 5 deaths population 10 million basically nothing. Yes, 0 less, much. comply FED relief? Comply FED highway budget goes zero. said first would try actual sane policy would try sell get support. needed usual budget pressures would applied. requires govt actually gives shit people. yeah, non starter. wonder spike European countries nobody cares, there's spike America we're 'the worst' country world lol Well reason he’s man screaming mountain policy makers aren’t listening. They’re putting fingers ears pretending shit isn’t happening, like large portion country. Fauci doesn’t set policy I’m sure advice he’s offering people make decisions falling deaf ears opinion. info n excess deaths nonsensical bad faith argument. dire system shortage PPE. nurse friend mine told hospital everyone needed keep reusing PPE entire week. brief official guidance served purpose alleviate pressure time selfish fools even prevented buying two shopping carts full toilet paper.

It also Trump's fault strategic supply PPE replenished. 3 full years major disease emergency. also warned. real answer. commonly-quoted R0 flu 1.3. coronavirus twice high. Perhaps could argue flu would actually spread quickly naive population, that's moot point populations naive flu (except maybe uncontacted tribes).

Unless going argue semantics say commonly accepted R0 coronavirus *vastly* exaggerated due super-spreaders early stages outbreaks, coronavirus lot contagious flu. everyone wants hunker stay locked house us clear virus big concern used think was, maybe strains got less serious knows, us keep going lives keep economy afloat. goalposts moved 2 weeks flatten curve let's wait one ever dies anything sustainable. lives affected due emotional/economic/psychological trauma. vulnerable fearful, stay home. needs balance shutdown. time jokes. work set free. Well hell, could google though, speculative try diagnose death. I've read plenty stuff think sociopath psychopath mentally ill. disagree, say like fact. I'm repeating Los Angeles County Health Director  Chinese backed WHO? Yeah really matter much space cities even cities like other. I'm sure Omaha density NYC still city. Right?! really left house since Feb except doctor's appointments one day cabin fever got bad, live-in partner went fishing. Fuck. part we're going another fucking year people. wife boat. Scored gig cushy suburb school people would die for. literally. Hope y’all stay safe, family. starters, HRC Sec State [pushing universal healthcare First Thats issue then, state praised flattening curve, dont mean shit Florida anything right I75 Yeah, slowly going down, fact remains going down. pretty obvious thing going away vaccine anyways. assumption lead apathy well, everyone showed vote her. MA, highest voter turnout ever primaries, definitely case November well. one making wild claims. one actually needs provide evidence backs claims. keep lying yourself, maybe someday it'll true. 300 000 people died cancer time bruh

Most corona victims old people would died anyway another infection. working populace affected insane restrictions deaths 🙄 read George Carlin's voice. also whak-a-mole sense cohesive policy play combat this, even though basic info reduce Covid spread known months. 

(1) Universal mask availability usage
(2) social distancing, indoors always outdoors recommended
(3) readily available rapid testing, provisions isolation test positive. Prohibit workplaces firing someone, form retaliation isolate.
(4) hard one, shutting / minimization non-essential gatherings, including indoor recreational facilities enforcing strict capacity limits based spacing facilities opened. 
(5) enforcement policies local law enforcement using fines forced isolated repeat offenders. local law enforcement requisite numbers, use federal officers least, put LE active places like large grocery stores.

This 5 polices, enacted effectively, reduce Covid spread within matter 2-3 weeks. happened everywhere world, even US enacted. Accompanied financial help lost employement income due virus, atleast minimize number new daily cases. Idiots Tell then. much second last week adjust last update? Sadly office becomes occupied American (and likely Russian) people right thing November Fist bump mean, saw happened toilet paper. fine line walk. reality, guess could say stalled mask wearing little bit supplies alternatives able ramp production. problem misinformation distrust spread social media. knew people would adverse helping others? think one issues initial recommendations deceptive made bunch people sceptical trusting again. try keep date everything fact check medical advice coming states. 

It's really fucking sad Trump cronies broken usa badly fact check official government communications.

Edit: Added trusting ... How? Mail guys insulin? 😂

America resources needs handle virus, government choosing to. neighbors think deep state falsifying numbers disappear election. people 40% America pretty depressing. rate jobs aren’t ever coming back can’t see recover anytime soon. literally believe Hannity Limbaugh deep state get Trump even though it’s appointees. still haven’t seen wave evictions moratoriums probably get really bad financially elections. stocks sub predicting full crash next year aren’t imbeciles wsb read reports. I've heard people covid-19 might cause long term side effects (such lung damage) several weeks months recovery.

Does EVERYONE gets covid-19 suffer one term damage? people likely suffer long term? Good idea! Right according 538 Biden favored win, honestly lot people scarred 2016 election last 4 years literally chance Trump winning seems like Pointing out(correctly) we’ve putting bunch bullshit advice one knows do, solution “just print money.” Lol fuck me. Except countries pulled off. guess delusional. think point shaking hands. show trust other. like clinking glasses, point share drinks avoid poison issue Wear mask eat turkey corner. Delete this. You’re harming people lack caution disregard medical facts. sore throat yesterday panicked since I've social distancing whole time wearing masks. gone now, I'm pretty scared head winter. Something common like cold symptoms could turn far sinister. already know easy people spread cold too. I'm masks, immediate family wear anytime go out. complain mask rules. ridiculous. oven broke last night decided go get dinner, saw dining room open decided eaten since February, plus we've already it... not?

Well going order out, made sure 1 mask. figured, wear mask sitting table eating so, problem right? Nope. dig diaper bag find masks adults, kids.... wear 20 steps table.... also staff either wearing masks wearing properly masks seated. I'm pretty sure 50% capacity. 

By point wanted go home, husband want kids excited eating fight it. even supportive active mask wearing, whole charade ridiculous. also says incomplete data weighted reflect incomplete data based CDC’s best estimates be. New York’s recent weeks actually adjusted last couple updates. agree know next expert advise trusted? That's thing trust. irreverent comparison make... excess deaths matters. total deaths. excess deaths continue way higher flu season recent record. 

Fact trying compare total deaths instead excess deaths makes pretty clear actually care facts pushing agenda. One would think allowing international travel made much easier rapid testing

Only UK planes UK destination. UK control those. haven’t met single person switching vote. People still defending response hearing recordings admitting downplaying it. We’re gonna get another four years garbage deserve it. 3rd world leader 3rd world country. due per cap payments? get impression alt account /u/HarryPFlashman? Maybe response comment post yesterday, account called ""DiligentInvesting"" /u/HarryPFlashman seems post investment subs frequently, comments seems mirror /u/HarryPFlashman's opinions writing style? 🤔  seem pretty pissed people keep sneaking saying they're going Alaska end Alaska.

Only specific people. Although say failure America's handling virus one person's blame alone. think comment pretty self contained would like elaboration sustainable, there's choice. pay bills im barely middle class area. also use Wells Fargo, skip part, need $500 worth DIRECT DEPOSIT account month remove fee.

Sorry bud, $500 daily balance get direct deposit least $500 month paychecks, really even need bank. experience mask compliance near 100%, plenty people wear mouth covers, take second think people range, get. They're wearing flimsy little cloth masks anyways, block air worth damn anyways. I’m starting feel like I’m crazy

I FEEL EXACT WAY?!

Like look otherwise intelligent friends Facebook birthday parties, pool parties, care world, I'm looking data like ""Am crazy one? imagining shit? happening? country collectively freak disasters kill dozen people, ignore thousand dying day virus?"" 6% Stop living life like it’s movie script.  keep hearing credit union best. went got car loan biggest one city, Im big urban city.
Holy dealing sooo annoying. Every month send payment automatically bank due date. months call say hey theres late fee, didnt pay. tell them, naw sent in. Check system, check say oopps must behind posting payments. 
I never business credit unions that's service is. Yes. actually, six different vaccine initiatives funded sorts companies organizations.

Look, genius, funding science comes many places, misguided notion spin conspiracy theory makes sense. UNICEF, WHO, CDC also fund polio initiative.

This Bill Gates stuff pure nonsense. shred evidence proof anything nefarious involving Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation. tilting windmills. **Ad hominem** much? focus content article merits?  part block ceaselessly pushing narrative. Follow data weeks. Write down, see much adjusts next week. throw recent week big adjustments get made first week. minor adjustments. write weeks. see. New York actually adjusted recent data last couple weeks. Yeah letting Trump win completely get rid Elections totally going help US fix problems elaborate?

My entire point reasoning completely flawed.

You cannot make sound judgement flawed reasoning. Umm well, say wrong. neither really common uncommon. However, hygiene one issues India that's definitely factor Indian cases. government takes blame current situation. Shssssh. one wants hear that, especially Fauci. Remember folks, bring politics discussion one politician said issue directly caused another politician. Yeah, get that. save ""ripping people new one"" posts intentionally falling spreading misinfo. can't judge people specifically able stay fully isolated, although I'd like N U R E S

Oh man, anything lowered pedestal placed nurses upon, virus.

In late March/early April least two nurses debating Facebook nothing, worse flu, we'll never get point actually starts killing significant amount Americans.

Ignoring fact claim expert, getting data people FAR expertise field, ended trying shut I'm medical professional are.

A weeks later, least one ""Mask distance - I'm essential worker"" overlay profile picture. First said masks work enough masks. 

Even *before* that, saying wear masks make problem worse touch face. 
This February/March IIRC, hand-washing rage. issue stems top, total abdication responsibility full narcissistic self aggrandisement.

The federal government swooping blocking access cases taking PPE, refusing set national restrictions etc. 

Your governors learned repercussions. even scapegoat.

With competent leader, results definitely different. 

Admittedly, federalisation US makes tricky compare nations, look slightly skewed comparing say South Korea, new Zealand etc. Fascinating idea. Maybe shouldn’t dismantle standing pandemic response next time.  think would. explain situation Indian Country would better without Per Cap payments, back explanation facts data? I'm kind it. know risks want get back lick people's faces again. fucking serious? Totally different things nothing Gates. hell wrong you? Don’t jinx state good place, things open. they’re talking rolling back don’t see why. Hospitalizations steady. Deaths dropped way off. don’t expect large events allowed. closing certain businesses winter isn’t acceptable. Yup. Initially, colonies asked seats parliament. wanted representation, could get lower taxes.

They started banging freedom drum needed peasantry support revolution.

From start rich white guys wanting pay taxes. Even rational people start making excuses Thanksgiving christmas. People travel see family States kids come home colleges spreading line crazy. We're 200k dead now, 400k end year. absolutely understand perspective think aspects make perfect sense. think would look 100% federal control federal oversight. Marshaling resources, providing aid, streamlining things. Especially basic things. Masks work. Period, question. National standards exist states tweak FLOOR standards, basic expectation citizens. Especially mobile still even pandemic. I'm right you. caused horrifying number excess deaths, Easthope warned. end July, one report attributed 21,000 of excess deaths lockdown, result delays treatment. “epidemic” people needlessly dying home reluctant, unable, seek medical help. Sure, take mask grocery store like restaurant. they're conscientious, probably still wear mask grocery stores (I know people back eating patio restaurants, example, still mask everything else). spend lot time near them, COVID infection instantaneous - asymptomatic spreaders function time. socially distance better store, helps. think, trump said wear mask, we’d done he’d getting re-elected. 

He chose stupid hill die on. Win stupid prizes... R value? U.K. trying compare total deaths kinds point time pandemic total deaths flu season. diseases different though. different death rates. leader generally sign legally binding orders. everyone trusts respects leader says 'This problem here's do', problem tends get fixed. said, I'm well versed German society Underestimating Trump assuming ""idiots"" would vote got elected first place. Removing going take much nuanced view many supporters. lower urbanization mean lower proportion population lives urban areas. Sweden around 88% population lives urban area. Germany 77%.

But larger cities ICU count 15x higher population 8x higher. Adjusted population Sweden, would currently average 137 cases/ day, Sweden region 200 cases/ testing. couldn’t find data German testing, seems reasonable assume guys test much per capita us Swedes, maybe tad less we’ve doubled testing 2 weeks.

According site million tests PER Sweden par terms going right now. difference Germany deslt well early on. Hence much lower death rate do.

Yes, sady useless thanks people think wearing mask worse death itself. need remember isn’t competition. I’m happy quite well now. can’t happy us instead trying nullify success lot people died q1 q2.

Again, sweden people would like swedish model... would lead way higher death counts. Like sure right wear mask. right tell much dumbass are. lot rich friends he's helping make richer. Everybody US government price, including election officials. enough money spend buy literally anyone government. number arbitrary see logic. stuff works exponentially, adequate lockdown strong singular messaging possible would fraction deaths,maybe. others said hard say country would reacted Hillary telling everyone take seriously stay home. 100 years prepare ala Spanish Flu. point streamlines put process *somewhere*. could trolling. Deep South, hard tell. merkel ""is scientist"". lol. germany efficient system said one insanely idiotic things ever heard. point rambling, incoherent response even close anything could considered rational thought. Everyone room dumber listened it. award points, may God mercy soul. Adults: KID silly little rights. Also calm climate change please, opinions yet either think also depends infection rate area. Reduced indoor dining open since June live, haven’t outbreak tied it. haven’t dined myself, though. 

I’m guessing it’s low case load mask compliance wait work summer lower numbers start creeping again. (Ontario). country attention span. stop world honor 3000 dead, we're still losing many every week simply care make good television. Well first European wave effectively ended around mid-May. virus still around really much. 

The US complicated lot country locked they'd exposure virus. measures eased finally got ""first"" wave.

Research shows coronaviruses ""sharply seasonal"", possible real second wave might come around Feb/March next year Europe/New England, say June US South South America information. needed shut country *immediately* ramp testing set robust contact tracing program. shut country down, absolutely nothing saying shut hospital reasons. not. government kept American people afloat testing ramped 14 days declining cases. opened back up, masks mandatory. Different states regions *should* different policies.

What needed Feds money.

I read bars America could paid stay closed $25 billion year. know details, would really support keeping employees afloat, rent costs paid for, make local tax dollars, (and still is) incredibly cheap intervention. Another observational trial makes big claims.

I certainly unmasked, non-socially-distanced exposures, stop crappy research. non-randomized, unmatched control group, uses self-reporting measure, unblinded state, composite exposures, look patient-important outcomes. Give something better, CDC... deaths US COVID-19 under-reported, over-reported. know fact due excess deaths. hospitals get enough staff wear? so, probably dumb, unfortunate help lead general mistrust people told do. spent 3 months work work blue collar job. make 39000/year. wealth &lt; peoples lives. Well, Im depressed too. think lot us are. someone explain death rates generally falling case numbers climbing? mean ending, less? dont even know yet winter even weather effect virus. Lol bullshit hand wave explanation matter decline right now. flu season soon, people staying indoors often inevitably increase spread corona (and flu usual). People flu-like symptoms know flu, Covid, whatever else, hospitals absolutely slammed. People actually COVID may get treatment need time could die result. How? government protecting us pandemics.

In fact entire team people government specifically that.

Was key word.

We’re done hearing side, guys broken enough shit last four years.  Article:

Visitors Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Poland, Germany, Cyprus, Australia, Canada Japan soon need quarantine.

&amp;#x200B;

The Finnish government explained Friday that plans ease coronavirus-related restrictions on travel country take effect 19 September.

According new rules, visitors allowed countries fewer 25 coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants preceding two weeks. Currently limit eight per 100,000.

Starting 19 September, Finland require travellers quarantine arrive Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Poland, Germany, Cyprus, Australia, Canada Japan.

Travelers countries exceeding 25 per 100,000 limit required take a coronavirus test when arrive. 

Interior Minister Maria Ohisalo (Green) said particularly pleased become easier travel Finland Sweden.

Is safe?

An English-speaking reporter asked ministers Friday briefing safe public health grounds lift restrictions time coronavirus case numbers European countries rising.

""The government three-angled strategy. First look Covid situation time see evolves. look social economic aspects restrictions we've had, influence society quite lot,"" Ohisalo explained.

And see legislative frame\[work base\] decisions. Government looking angles. mentioned, we're improving increasing amount testing \[of arrivals high-risk countries\] time, one reasons still totally open come Finland,"" added.

""We've discussions risks obviously risks. time also need see might need live kind situation quite long time,"" continued.

Ohisalo said Finland nearly reached limit imposed Schengen rules state border controls Schengen-area countries, general rule, exceed six months. Finland's six-month period ends 18 September.

Finland continue apply country-specific entry rules 19 September 18 October. government said plans roll new testing-based approach 23 November, according statement Interior Ministry.

Ohisalo said Finnish authorities carry weekly assessments coronavirus situation various countries.

Business hopes

Minister Transport Communications, Timo Harakka (SDP), said hoped relaxation restrictions support businesses, transportation sector, domestic tourism national airline Finnair.

Economic Affairs Minister, Mika Lintilä (Cen), said government wants enable ""as normal travel possible times.""

An Yle reporter asked Ohisalo Finland planned prevent cases increasing travel restrictions eases people arriving Sweden, example.

According media reports, Sweden currently 24 coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants, ratio quite close Finland's limit 25 cases per 100,000.

""If situation gets worse, take action,"" Ohisalo said.

Meanwhile, Ministry Social Affairs Health's director strategy, Liisa-Maria Voipio-Pulkki, said Finland needs constantly track domestic coronavirus situation, situation worsen.

On Thursday evening Ohisalo noted Finland maintain internal EU border controls 22 November order complete implementation testing-based entry model related legislative changes.

Sources Yle Restaurants/business suppose masks hand Mr. Orange already get falsify testing records? make worse? could continue blame democratic governors helps?¿ people sour at, gonna choose expert everyone ignored? say anymore percentages. know ones. :) Certainly. seems they’re gaining insight contact tracing, restaurants commonality among positive cases seems. I’m saying restaurants aren’t necessarily high risk people tested positive gone there, people willing take risk going restaurant also likely take part risky behaviors well.

And again, don’t take endorsement opening restaurants dining regardless. plans dine anytime soon wouldn’t recommend anyone else either. recognize moving past benefits literally everybody? “Dependa shit” benefits certain people expense other. Sooner later people look around see isnt deadly

I think 190,000+ deaths US seen virus since February would beg differ statement. contrast that, US around 10,000-12,000 deaths drunk driving per year. Would say drunk driving deadly?  they’ve already exposed. GOP made fucking pandemic political issue. still blows kind this. Youre willing take risk, taking risk. ...no, that's happening That's true, people switch in-door protests prevent spread. Messaging big issue. think anyone following data knew we'd flatten curve, considering open 100% we're going hit peak months line.

If start ignoring measures now, sacrifice made early nothing. Continuing still slow spread, even we're it. wanted us stay indoors before. Lol it? not? emergency scale seen since WW2. pay bartenders/waiters/etc stay home it’s over. Everyone else wear masks time good social distancing.

This plan works well cases already low baseline. fucked we’d need another 6 weeks lockdown start it. pay everyone stay home.

Paying everyone stay home blows deficit. what? Interest rates &lt;1% real rates negative. government literally borrow money, and, inflation-adjusted terms, pay back less borrowed. Also, WW2 didn’t deficit hawks complaining shouldn’t defeat Germany Japan it’s expensive don’t cash hand. Borrow wazoo get job done, clean mess side. Correct I’m wrong Dr. Fauci told us wear mask would stop droplet best amount people made political dumb

Republicans. play sides bullshit. Republicans made political. love body choice sudden :) Yeah it’s like everyone forgot whole “masks don’t work”, “oh wait do, help protect ourselves”, go far saying masks literally “save lives”. Well, it? either work, do, even work doubt would significant enough claim masks actually save lives. It’s election November

Referring generic non-P95 masks, even P95s easily saturated condensation breath rendered useless. proof anyone wants need better message population - they’re following sucks, don’t see what’s perspective, asked sacrifice people don’t know, don’t care *them,* done nothing.

At point realize it’s “shit behavior” it’s reaching message meets are. course, that’s satisfying shaming internet writing ticket. means actually FUCKING SOMETHING. It’s matter things prevent spread. lot people think still within reason, idiots aren’t, doesn’t help contact tracing testing complete mess. Possibly NYC able successfully reopen schools week so. trying reopen south TX folly get cases lower (unless mind major outbreaks schools, seeing mind major outbreaks general population, knows...) check? listen history teachers - I'm biology teacher. virus never explode areas already been. indelibly changing R0 every recovered infection.

If really valued history, would know outbreak prevention happens source, a.k.a. China. know happen. thought surge/wave thing myth. mostly generous sick pay generous care-givers leave here. get money stay home sick kids. Even kid threw keep home three days symptom free prevent norovirus outbreaks.

The total lack discussion sick leave caregivers leave astounding. American leftists focused pandemic specific responses see big picture use opportunity propose structural changes. Nothing hate shitty mobile versions pages Diversity yay! Oh wait... live mask-intensive area can’t even imagine I’d feel saw maskless people everywhere. ridiculous accusations. Nobody hoping long-term Everybody wants pandemic over. Nobody ""enthusiast"". really believe 30% US below, average intelligence. Yes said twice, I've met pretty smart idiots. book Haredi secular Israelis civil war. wont get tensions skyrocketing.

Only reason lockdown outbreak centers refuse pinpointed quarentine without breaking government (Haredi areas). ok nation lockdown local lockdowns. Lawless Arab villages also play role. Yeah, see wayyyyyyy many people going back 
""things fine are!"" that's something *will* change soon people stop taking precautions seriously - stop wearing masks, start going groups again, etc. 

People desperate return normalcy, reality, people extending time we're going put bullshit half-assing it. everyone wore mask *stayed home absolutely go out*, things would much better. already informed families coming see holidays, although expect many people find excuses travel upcoming months, going bad soon. Look, I'm quarantines keep people safe, everyone already positive...why matter they're together? Right...so good parents took care made sure fall troubled path. Congrats. 


They forget teach empathy though, guess they're great all. literally pull official chart cases dramatically peak. Deaths to, even dramatically. suck bot. life avoidance death. Anyways point Americans never go measures strict, takes drop cases. continue highest death toll going rough winter.

Yep, that's fear.

Even vaccine, going hard get people get half country say ""It's going kill me, care"", quarter say ""Bill gates microchipping me"", last quarter get it, matter.

Then government absolutely refuse strictly enforce vaccination, we'll never attain herd immunity.

Hopefully goes better that, much hope will. Well someone dies death slum somewhere poor indian countryside, doubts person ever noticed corona death, person simply cannot afford hospitalisation either, numbers high local government lets calc down.

I dont think happen india regular base. “Forced compliance,” mind expanding little more?

Also, love “blamed”(as it’s bad thing) US’s individualist roots “entertainment media” countries “entire existence,” rather know, escaping religious persecution 1600’s fighting world’s largest navy bunch dirt poor farmers. Yeah, it’s definitely entertainment media definitely nothing “history” stuff. news websites apart BBC are. That’s I’d say it’s best either use browsers built reader mode better yet: avoid together wait kind soul paste article comments.  6 times half assed measures tho. Like Ohio pretty good curve flatten. much good plague rats florida come back motor cycle rally spread disease again. ironic given level entertainment get home best it’s history time. entire country?! Saying things like ""people waking up"" shows addicted bullshit talking points are. fact jump right insulting gaslighting them.

You offered proof supplement argument, yet insult others lack proof.

""Prove wrong."" come shit, pulled anecdote ""your numbers."" pathetic. He's fellow doom gloomer. That's love him. reddit hivemind wants go forever never leave house again. Masks mostly American South European thing Western Europe. Netherlands Sweden example think pointless long keep distance avoid busy places. He's already embodiment ministerial failure. mitigation now. mean, no. look like one big surge like first surge mid April, second surge late July over.

We might third wave schools reopening, hopefully not, knows. Wonder people start getting sued sort thing. despite getting vote lot things change fundamentally society whole changes. ridiculous Keep messenger, delete Facebook. Fauci also said asymptomatic cases drivers epidemics. stop useless testing symptom free people leave schools open Sweden Lmao, climate change taking hold like thought would? luck USPS, racism, back virus round 3? r/gatekeeping parties, we? they're gay? reality lost.  clamped hard two months strong tracing whenever outbreak - would fine. gone long even people isolating can’t keep going without work social contact. 

I keeping strict quarantine sucks. Watching assholes politicizing means stay quarantine longer. makes super bitter.  terrible, it? aren’t driving flying cars now? We’ve talking forever! propaganda fear monger citizens. Im it. Yes agree completely, one country, one people, one leader Schools LA closed election day, lived parts country closed election day. Source: LAUSD teacher think they’re “taking” now? terms US cases went 50 thousand per day 35k per day month. title wrong windows never properly closed. Also course ac central ventilation all. Maybe introduce public canings people start wear masks? 


/s still wrong still misrepresenting rules. idea except feel better perhaps still post incorrect info. real end game thrones. Dining Inside outside? 

I desire eat inside Fauci fraud. Change mind I’ve hunkered fucking spring summer. logical fallacies indicate avoiding get specifics content altogether. war terror silly anyways, right.

Literally yes. massively overreacted, stripped Americans rights, imprisoned (and continue imprison) people charges trial, launched two wars killing HUNDREDS THOUSANDS innocent people, spent trillions, scars overreaction reverberating day.

Are ironic? Continent vs country. Prove it. numbers getting worse. Wow completely missed shit show. That's insane. Especially SARS epidemic never reached west this, occurred periodically eastern countries first response population mask up. there's good reason say work. wonder part failed attempt save masks medics bad information bother even check Google search. hilarious.  India severely underreporting, everything else would huge surprise me, period! Yep, disinformation gone crazy. antivaccine movement, Q movement, outside actors, united single flag point I'm seeing people otherwise never bought crazy shit suddenly super antivaccine.

Add fact propagandists successfully placed ""mandatory vaccines"" category ""things Hitler would do"" lot state governments super reluctant enact sort policy would end people vaccinated.

I've got little hope we're going right thing. China *lot* enforceablity. People break quarantine know jailed (there cameras installed outside doors). contact tracing program also incredibly invasive, cellphone data tracks person's movement known minute, extremely effective disease control, Westerners concerned privacy would refuse download it. (It's exactly mandatory China contact tracing app, many workplaces public venues require popular enough effective). literally JHU 7 day average. Yes hospitals good now, heat sunlight know virus struggles. 3 months sunset 5pm temp 30 degrees lower? Probably not. Experts predicted virus would wane summer, (dumb) people even implied might completely gone summer, also predicted second spike winter. quick dismiss it, they're exactly ones see undecided voter focus groups morning election day, they're 5-10% population pick presidents. read watch news daily even weekly, vote feel vote gut rather policy. I'm taking advantage anyone. one required work me. welcome find better jobs benefits time. pay reasons, people work happy enough quit. kind stretch, fine think content promoted social media platform considered platform's ""speech"". includes everything promoted tweets posts ""recommended"" posts videos promoted machine learning algorithms.

It count speech posts organized obvious way. Facebook chronological timeline, could assumed making statement showing recent posts friends. browsing content creator's channel Youtube, count Google's speech play one preorganized channels. Twitter showing tweet trending, getting lot retweets likes short amount time, that's statement end (unless demonstrate they're favoring trending tweets others). recommending anti-vaxx videos think might interested seen company endorsing videos, consumers videos sure think that. like says company, really retool ML algorithms push fringe content like that.  Woody Harrelson 2012, crazy also right! :D got buddies live China, virus contained awhile now. daily cases. believe anyone telling otherwise becomes political. Yes beginning China mess prepared opposed us. basically opposite comes pandemic therefore results. theory put paper entire universe neural network feel like would predictable unpredictable thing 2020 that's 2020. Wait thought cases downward trajectory. We’ve come 70k 30k think money would come from? government take order give everyone? August 2019 China already ""issues"" getting generic medications rest world. personally believe hoarding meds PPE making news virus. ""they know december"" seems pretty wrong based lot things. current trajectory? mean behind bunch states absolutely must win? ironic seeing socialized loses farming industry, oil industry, banks last year alone. I'm guessing lasts 35 seconds. place donkey show. 190,000 dead Americans. Nothing see 🧹🧹💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 returning school they'll better employment opportunities pay health care.

\s Wall help extraordinary supporters, Mises Institute world's leading supporter ideas liberty Austrian School economics.
 
Oh, my! Here's source definitely trust want sacrifice people god capitalism. wonder though; country huge diverse United States, even competent president, would things gone differently?

The entire idea pandemic response team people place formulate response soon popped China. That's CDC Beijin liaison for. response would looked like this: testing protocols rolled incoming travelers, travel restrictions place country growing cases, drive testing centers free testing available cases began grow every city country. Beefed laboratory capacity make sure tests came back within 48 hours. Stimulus checks written individuals encourage staying home. Contact tracing funded set national level census-like employees coming door notify exposed. Basically something like Korea Taiwan even Rwanda did.

Even people idiots, would never hundreds thousands deaths. Korea several hundred 1/6 population insane density cities. Yes partly jest write this. purely would take infection standpoint. Nobody would want dine way, probably would violate laws feasible. know anything fire regulations.  picturing like motel, outside door everyone would required keep interaction happening. probably right, one door one would probably violation fire code. country big diverse America doesn’t make sense nationally mandate precautions. Montana Florida doing? Europe, countries spiking different times. It’s different states America. didn’t Gates fund vaccine initiatives ahead time? Thank science!  Jeff Goldblum Jurassic Park communities extremely high rates social problems like domestic violence alcoholism. saw people lined outside breakfast restaurant day, compels people midst pandemic? get go need bad. need covid19 tribunal put people like DeSantis trial part played deaths 200k people suffering complete utter destruction lives survived. Must great bubble Polio almost eradicated. Antivaxx movements Africa Southwest Asia one big reasons eradicated. Obviously does. It’s data. even 8% it. He’s talking entire nation. 8% it.  country even ready message. Covid 19 defeated America change current people charge. laughing - sheep economy? south especially football start early July many many hours per day. working multiple teams varsity, JV, freshman 10-14 hour days. coach, anymore schools playing sports right now. country burning  420 dollars 2 weeks won’t even put dent rent you’d pay month We're third one now, we? Already stockpiling again. 

Loads flour rice sugar. Lots tinned stuff cant bothered cook.
Laid kilos jam, plenty beer brewing.
 Less sanitizer. turned less essential thought would be. Yeah, admittedly I'm SoHo person knowledge Ybor Seminole Heights stuff remained largely open various workarounds. like local brewery put tables perpendicular bar kinda still 'bar' feel, miss hanging bar stool chatting folks. 

This distinction bar 'place get shithammered also food' stupid start IMO. MUCH safer pounding tequila shots beach bar outside eating inside fancy restaurant shoddy HVAC. safety point view anything inside risky, whether seated table bar, even reduced occupancy. 

I guess we'll see happens. virus widespread Florida seems we're going catch point unless go full Howard Hughes. shitty comment op **laughs Philippines** sick treat! Crisis averted, could stay fuck home. Yet he’ll go around saying Trump great job camera played ad-nausium I'm wondering really worth giving fuck anymore.

The first surge probably never over, second. people okay current illness death rate, it. (I'm not, call) Let things continue are. Herd immunity growing snails pace, growing.

Infection rates Sweden, that's good news least. shows plateau reached without much way restrictions.

The real problem wanting put risk. They're stuck isolating time, safety ""out world"". They're forced work, they've already lost job benefits. people really getting shit right now, feel them. right. isn’t flu. deadly. level spread also currently lower 2017-2018 flu season, excess deaths currently. Fuck that, chance get mean, reading lines pretty obvious long haul.

The problem unified message government. competent leadership would said ""We going making sacrifices vaccine comes out"", that's truth.

We ""flattened curve"", need continue it, impossible open completely without reverting work we've already done, unfortunately.

We're boat. wife far worse am, although I'm hot myself. absolutely miss friend nights, going really tough outside alternative bitter winters here. Nope: (SPOILER) marine biologist made it, paddling beside him.  You’re real asshole know that? excellent points. Wait like come red bull carbonation saying put red bull? test positivity US vs countries mentioned OP (and Sweden lulz)

Does seem like cases rising Europe likely surpass US weekly cases per million unless US ""third wave"" soon Totally agree. moved Jersey earlier year, turns LANES END. warning. signs. guess need know. Even normal driving terrifying now. America never lockdown.  Looks like France, Spain, Denmark similar U-shaped case curve U.S new infections equaling surpassing initial spike. wonder case European countries. bad: docuseries, freakishly coincidental timing, came early January year. studied global health grad school though aware potential pandemic awhile. president instead Trump people refusing wear masks would still refuse wear “Hillary can’t tell us do”. group would ignore science. hahaha! People think government ban something, safe?! heard lobbyist? Policy, nature, makes trade offs safety, convinence, economy. use brain figure what's freaking safe. Also, shithead breath could result poor barrista:s illness. better darn good reason this. WTF. ok swallow whole bag sugar, I'm not. ok drink silly everyday, I'm not. ok jump bridge, I'm not. There's ban drink bleach, I'm not. There's ban sitting dryer turning on, I'm not. ""funny"" thing really many people believe one scientist say something completely opposite everyone else says, disregarding difference expertise versus audience. fuck. corona cases literally decline wtf don’t understand reddit Thanks aging infrastructure, think even ""good"" water contaminated lead higher EPA minimums, unfortunately (true country). like they're testing schools, nice. think Flint one news. Chicago replacing old pipes. police killing innocent people metric oppression, every race ""oppressed"", greater degree, lesser degree. that's argument made protesters, someone's definition wrong. either event, police killings fringe percentage homicides laughable use certifiable proof something revolting generalized oppression. ever sour patch kids (original) Red Bull? taste differential except carbonation! 

It’s glorious. Jeff Goldblum Jurassic Park 😣 tri-state area 23 million residents densely populated area doesn’t count towards entire nation?

OK. Can’t second wave never finish first wave! think all. guys fucked. I'll ok. would panic even look like? People rushing buy readily available consumer goods like toilet paper canned food? Meat flying shelves point perceived shortage? Half country locking inside house weeks? #Summary

Asymptotic transmission extremely rare. elderly extremely comprised risk. 99.9 percent world perfectly fine get back normal. evidence long term damage related Covid - symptoms likely caused stress/anxiety/fear/weakened immune system wearing masks social distancing. 

But terms masks, certain types offer protection. transmissions caused improper care improper use masks, thereby causing infections mask mandates. terms society whole, masks stop transmission. anything, make worse. Wake up.

If real virus deadly consequences, wouldn’t even discussion. Unfortunately Covid believers, total deaths cannot even attributed Covid proof. internet speed “increased” 11.9% still bad video games? Emails communication. weekly calls parents hours, sometimes last 15-30 minutes. 30 kids class, math. Answering emails phone couch thing.

I know teacher gets 20 weeks off. another bogus statement you.

I feel bad teachers life truly think/feel profession. cope Oh, absolutely. trust anyone else enough ever ride motorcycle. 

Hell, barely trust people road enough I'm car, much less something could pretty much bump road without noticing. said “misrepresentation” “misinformation”.

Yeah. Fuckin duh. don’t want anything differently. I’m stating *I* feel, personally. shit. bartender... saying start. New Orleans bars closed least, tourist city restaurants still open, good luck. fellow FoH workers feel unsafe everyone establishments, mentality welcomed FoH often painted ""pussies"" refusing ""buck up"" (this points obvious Front v Back house, misogyny, rampant sexism industry, hopefully aspect change this). 

Patrons huge problem. Honestly maybe 5% people remained masked, taking eat drink. Maybe another 15% actually put thr masks dealing staff. tired 3rd table. job shifted serving food making drinks telling people put masks on. Managers need step up. Patrons see need step up. want us serve this?! part least.

And tipping. ""Oh dont regulars throw money you?"" No. answer no. yea. shitty tips shitty 2019. insulting degree mendable. economic crisis too. Tips suck now. EVERY restaurant put 20% gratuity checks, patrons dont read check, bad them. 

I think crazy people saying get used not. serving food? making drinks? cooking people open kitchen?

Also, don’t get started lack correlation lockdowns spread. Yet continues ban schools making masks mandatory schools.

Very cool, rational. Uh oh According article hospitalizations rise well. Yes, anything makes vulnerable. Still waiting place got hit badly hit badly again. debt crisis ? Cool story, bro.

I appreciate risk front line worker Taco Bell.

**You contribute high-quality information.** require users submit reliable, fact-based information

This exactly fake news propagates.  mean... Yeah. choice, something can't control like skin color height. Seriously let get anymore chubby, likely really bad person. Third party delivery services also stiffs servers rely tips income. all. Illegals find work easily.... live state bordering MX, there's lot immigration here. Go Home Depot Lowes 6am plenty men soliciting work. Sure good day waved quick skill assessment, get nod hop in. 

But paid fairly? No. B/c one enforce fair wages safe working conditions. Incorrect. get shot covers one strain use Southern Hemisphere data predict strain dominant. Usually one is. Tour de France started two weeks ago. would interesting see new cases towns visited Tour. So.. TSA irrelevant.. case obvious: screening temperatures next useless.

a) pre-symptomatic carriers contagious

b) getting accurate temperature reading way involved quick 'beep'

c) elevated temperature neither necessarily COVID, always present COVID. downvoted this? absolutely truth. body least twice amount weight should, wonder got serious complications. Either it’s younger people getting average deaths per capita 65% US deaths per capita right now. 7% sounds good realize peak 3x worse US even almost 1.5x worse Italy's peak.

My major point sub adamant bad US situation needs realize Spain's situation far off. Trump's visit Walter Reed 'not protocol' routine visit

It's officially confirmed unplanned visit Walter Reed series mini-strokes. really wish vaccine narrative much controlled.

I remember getting downvoted back like April go along mass belief we'd perfect vaccine September.

This shit easy. virus much experience compared something like flu.

I still think vaccines (at least early ones next year so) going underwhelming part: requiring either repetitive doses every months, providing great immunity first place. better nothing, especially high risk individuals, see long-term solution.

But instead everyone's hopes pinned thing going disappoint everyone. absolutely that. Vietnam virus stayed away really strict lockdown, closed borders 2 week mandatory quarantine government facility anyone needing enter country. idea you’re talking about. think arrest minors every morning minors. Way many pigs schools days. Well matters places like NYC. Tourists coming back international travelers helped fuck us first round. Exactly. I’m looking forward watching news seeing 1 mile long lines outside CVS/Walgreens. It’s coming !  Dancing stranger sounds horrifying setting year! yeah agree able move around without paranoid every surface person, long days. school district keeps sending cookie-cutter ""someone school tested positive"" emails, state since everyone wearing masks, one needs worry get tested. like ""uh, lunch?"" told ""lunch count"".

For real? virus pauses waits everyone finish lunch put masks back on? Okay. cannot get dumb people are. Stop giving Donald Trump 24/7 attention. Yes know everything wrong. Rapists tend way. fixed, happy? What’s passed? Uneducated republicans trying hardest kill people, they’re still going strong. 

What’s passed???? Anyone able explain going happen UK situation next months. 

Reading many different reports fuck restaurant workers, right? Obesity normative US. would like saying ""she breathed"" ""she shat"". overweight serious risk factor affects vast majority US adults. semitic lizard overlord believe pulling strings particular paper? Spain's average deaths around 7% March peak. 2 weeks compulsory quarantine New Zealand. keeping empty hotels full.  “It's unclear whether teachers actually contracted COVID-19 schools. Two believed contracted virus outside school one unnamed teacher died classes officially began.”

Clever headline wording anything test way sake countries. Much likely get would bring in. Like single people? supposed give dating indefinitely?

There different levels social distancing.

I doubt people literally seeing another person right now.

Most people know taking mean maintain small social bubble hang outside.

You totally go dates, went quite socially distant dates sat apart park somewhere. Hell met current girlfriend June wearing masks commented dog... outdoor setting, virus quickly dissipates due amount fresh air natural wind available, need certain amount virus concentration air get infected. (it's like lottery, one virus likely infect you, need millions good chance ""win"")

Think way, time infected person produce virus air talking/sneezing, virus quickly dissipates vast outdoor environment, virus concentration air quickly zeroed out. indoor environment, virus concentration air keep getting higher there's nowhere go, kept within indoor space. “Says clue he’s talking about, proceeds say common cold coronavirus”

Only strains common cold classified coronavirus, majority strains (the ones get every year) classified rhinoviruses, known mutate quickly/recklessly.

So no, can’t base covid-19 immunity common cold 💀 lag longer that. 

and places, take weeks certify cause death added official statistics, that's person dies. actual fuck?! Deaths bad, long term chronic illness hundreds thousands, millions, people bad. 

Covid leaving people damage nothing respiratory system. I'm 25, life long athlete, mountain biking regularly got infected. infection couple days fever feeling run down, 2 months line I've got kinds nervous system issues. wake morning heart rate immediately skyrockets. sometimes get winded walking hundred feet (and mind you, never breathing trouble, mild case).


Stop playing virus. Every infection tragedy. Nearly half covid survivors Italy say they're recovered yet, months later. Speedy recovery niece Youre one shifted goal posts.

Yes think somewhat reasonable, talking france denmark. lockdowns super effective sweden better comparable countries super harsh lockdowns?

If youre saying sweden better countries factors intrinsic sweden, suggests lockdowns arent really important factors Essential 'you guys job otherwise inconvenient lot people'.  time, treated disposable employers. dropped ~~ball~~ hard initial response

soap, FTFY Problem people seem think there's middle ground maximum chill running edge nearest cliff. feel like anyone would better Trump. Biden poor choice like Harris. live see support Trump daily. think win happens democracy might fall.  like US, example. Well, NYC birthplace lived till 17, know cost living. also know 57K starting salary livable wage boroughs - Manhattan.

The median **household** income NYC $57K. would say teachers fine Time stop states deciding this. executive branch needs put strict standards adherence. exactly people win elections. polling pundits say Candidate lead, makes Candidate voters stay home actual voting day.

If want votes, lose polls light fire voters' asses. would expect management tell leave. I'm sorry deal kind behavior guess reopening country peak wasnt great idea, surprising many deaths per day? Quit telling cases. couldn’t give rats ass jimmy getting corona. many people dying ? people elect scientist leadership position probably rational less smooth brained people elect reality tv host.

It's correlation, causation. always sorts random adverse events happen control group. It’s need large base size time, able tell there’s difference placebo vaccine arms study. It’s common things like nausea, headache fatigue often common “side effects”, similar numbers placebo vaccine arms know they’re related vaccine. Honestly man I’m best wearing masks going restaurants public places, Fauci take “we’re going back normal end 2021” shit pound ass.

Not shit another entire fucking year, sorry. corona shit ruined social lives unusual question

I guess would depend airflow patterns room whether good reason brand stunning administration friends making fun america cannot control spread. 
I telling trust summer holidays join USA top ladder. 

I mean people Paris cannot wear masks properly can’t respect shit public places... deserve top level comment day criticizing headline saying people 40 immune without adding context deadly people 60; panic. can't wrap head around rationale. said wheeze 

as fell knees lol

A large country like US low population density similar infection rates countries much higher population density clear cut sign aint good.

lol. Good try buddy. 3.7 million (or 4x SF though 20x size) doesn’t seem particularly small OC, craziness cases, moved ahead opening.

Edit: clarify, third largest county California shocking it’s third highest case counts. US always first. Sorry man! can. Please hang  Covid give fuck. vaccine, decent herd immunity viable hosts. That’s one-day report, every county different day week fluctuations.

At last state update Tuesday, 7-day running average 5.2 daily per 100k Orange 11.0 LA County.  SF 7.8, San Diego 6.9. Well families fit definition number 2. 
The governor 2012..and John Cusack's line ""when tell panic, that's run!"" Anything China fuel wacky consipiracy rumors west. situation we're natural conclusion one party glorifying selfishness, embracing anti-intellectualism, basing identity wanting ""own"" side. long time coming. bad National mandates sounds like infringing people’s freedoms. lead world disparities wealth education empathy well would seem. worst could ever possibly train slightly higher altitudes ... mean make restrictive masks purpose...  Came say much less eloquent way. Let ask you. 30k less 40k? That's started went little tangent. wonder people sleep night. Like flashbacks disgusting things witness? get higher pay that? felt That's dangerous thinking. People still think built wall made america great so?  said, posting another comment /r/Coronavirus 

This sub 80% lunatics think literally live excluded others. COVID, they're reclusive shut ins finally talk others actually lives.

Then 20% sane ones. death rate covid gone since started? think also we've learned since serious virus actually is. I'm saying 0 infections reasonable, back ""flatten curve"" key message, know potential permanent damage body's systems sure nationality, quick reddit comment mistake makes feel smarter, good you!!

Meh waste, would focusing IgM IgG antibodies. would targetting spike protein hypothesize would produce effective response. 

To test this, would test IgM IgG. hypothesis recall majority IgG response, confers long lasting immunity IgG1, shorter halflife IgG3, common adaptive long term memory response. dont know case far know, moved back virus work.  people wearing masks not, means people think wearing masks right. *they're* wearing mask *they're* wrong. like wrong.

So people get wear masks, least around them, less ""wrong"" are.

I dunno true everyone (I'm sure people think overblown want express stupid think everyone else is), expect large chunk people feel way deep based completely baseless suspicions. could quit told US so.  prevent citizens hoarding masks FYI. Thats reason told wear initially. Goddamn got worst fucking bot reddit. would trust Chinese CDC American CDC point. know who's got lots dollars... chy-na. Wait thought mask would help? Where’s money come from. reliable enough keep businesses closing long term ?Here UK least many cancer treatments delayed leading deaths , locked overwhelm hospitals didn’t accept patients covid like it’s singular disease face. Alongside many self employed people couldn’t get furlough scheme leading many lose substantial business incomes. ""I hate people politicizing crisis""

You: yeah fuck republicans currently 1 4 chance win electoral college victory. fucking insane went popular vote would near zero chance win. safe order Chinese food yet? Covid sub back meltdown mode narrative got blown apart!  I've seen shitload posts effect of, ""It's good billionaire president, one else would able afford send everyone stimulus checks.""

We know idiots vote, idiots believe shit like vote election previously would stayed home. Winning elections voter turnout. look India's stats making feel bad. ain't wrong. There's link virus obesity one wants talk about. lot people wear masks every day air pollution work purposes. It’s harmful. It’s like putting filter Air Conditioner.  Yeah, hell people get sick and/or die! much important people *have* go restaurants allowed so!  


/S  Remind 3 months information may outdated, conjunction several points made others, average age infected dropped somewhere 20-30 age group. Older people likely complications leading death. Same. We're monitoring temps staying away everyone (even more) next 2 weeks. Thanks. Service dog? Please daddy government. Stomp rights make big bad virus go awayb Realer Irrsinn? ""Could be"" main take away Go eat shit die. assholes reason things bad right now. disgust me. Ahh seems didn’t even read comment. condemn handled past also recognizing situation isn’t currently getting worse. two scenarios mutually exclusive, friend. Using political system enact mandates inherently political. Breathing isn't.

I'm saying agree mask mandate not; I'm saying literally one making something political want government enforcement.  instead going unproven path, try actually worked places. meaningful, coordinated shut bring virus transmission levels low level. reopen monitor vigorously, scaling measures local areas short periods get inevitable spread.

The reason we're still largely sitting home *some* people refused part actually sit home while. maddening. car filter made material masks. air breathing hours hours, month month, passed filter. didn’t answer either questions though. don’t understand flu ended either, i’ve read h1n1 quite bit. may they’re diseases, afaik diseases either spread everyone kill killed thus hosts, way stopped. answers, condescension?

edit: oh wait, app properly loaded people gave actual answers. surprise here. I've telling idiots we're still first wave. Hiding virus seeing numbers drop (especially brief period) constitutes wave.. virus still effective normal. new wave implies mutation less.. gonna fun happens. \*sighs\* talking sides mouth. 

I care, enough anything it. think college students who're throwing party guests COVID positive falls ""grey area"" that's somehow two extremes.

It's fucking moronic. 

And luckily never thought saint. way think I'm saint thinking seatbelt good thing use driving, wanting check ways crossing street.

I think common sense. windows open? like closed windows recirculated air, closed windows lots outside air mixed via HVAC system, what? cherrypicking constitutes wave. Even ""extremely low"" relative term.

If look charts, terms new daily infections peaked mid-July going significantly consistently since then. terms daily deaths, peaked late April went way that, late July, briefly went half late April's numbers. we're third them. see headline article? think Fauci part problem. He, like many others long distinguished careers, reason flushed toilet Donald Trump.

Fauci refused tell whole truth. allowed silenced instead telling Trump fuck come CNN tell entire truth. attempt “walk line” offend Dear Leader cast doubt irresponsible. 

He could gone work Cuomo NY part daily briefings truth told.

Any responsible person would resigned come told us Trump KNEW (which know did) yet chooses contradict time time again.

Fauci failed put lives first. broke cardinal rule oath: harm. supported government actually hunkered initially without rushing reopen. 

Now people took shit seriously since start get continue suffer refuse get control country. CDC already telling people wear masks beginning April.

Too bad needed March, Fauci saying there’s reason going around mask, wearing bandanna somehow deprives medical workers masks. Miami University needs kick ‘em out. They’ve failed critical thinking logic exam. Goes show, universities take anyone days. thinking required. would rather asshole like innocent person autoimmune disorder. You’re talking loved ones. Go eat shit die, worthless piece trash. point, bunch folks commented along lines ""bold assume win again"", I'm throwing hat conversation anyway add: really think election 1) decidedly Trump win / 2) magical answer somehow Fix™️ everything, paying attention.

I usually recommend books published 4yr circus, finished Michael Cohen's book last night, one *do* recommend. I, myself, surprised anything (though that's probably I've known people like Trump personal life), want foreshadowing another 4yrs administration destruction it'll enable - read it. pay attention alternative world Cohen describes, Trump people like inhabit.

Because Trump unique vices, disposition, genuinely malignant arrogance. ideal world includes losing November, think empowered expanded already deeply corrupt, topsy-turvy world wealthy / political insiders, somehow expansion deteriorated democratic institutions inside roses he's gone - again, paying attention.

edit: typo Madison *was* fine...until students came back....☹️ Wait, thought cases trending down? trying downplay, I've following since January read anything said original comment? ask studies information topic. 

Typical sub Reddit get defensive time someone raises question. Hey, least we’re fast tracked herd immunity. grandma go volcano economy, maybe good stonks :)  exposed high viral dose 

Infectious dose Like Amazon? wife staggeringly strict mask prevention person is. saying enough this, flying Missouri see elderly mother Xmas. Restrictions lightened people stopped caring... Oh see you’re saying. Wrong, Fauci specifically said hoard masks scarce hospitals initially. never said didnt work, constrain supply masks demand time. supply caught CDC changed guidelines said everyone wear masks. Oh glad found one. Every time looked amazon Best Buy’s websites, decent projectors. pandemic layer cake that’ll reinforced flu soon. 

That, drizzled thick syrup civil unrest that’s going explode like powder keg election. 

Yeah, shits going get worse. don’t wear masks though Wow. mean, might right, facts article indicate covid positive person found...wait it...at house. housemates also covid positive. visitors thought also covid positive. possible spent rest day running around town infecting people, hanging home covid positives something worry about. people comments already made many points put issue bed. wanted point wrong ad hominem. first surge, second wave etc. virus going anywhere. tell I’ve dabs every day since last year haven’t got covid don’t much go many places Wisconsin say lol mean, personally care health safety others, explicitly stated don't. makes plague rat. surest proof alien visitors recent times fact impeached president hasn’t tweeted yet going blame message? fact, many people population day age spoiled, entitled, selfish. access best technology, social media - tools generation ever before, makes lives MUCH EASIER that, makes communicating getting information type message much easier. 

There many messages campaigns raise awareness really simple - think people could kill. saying matter kill someone else may know them? That's pretty scary people raised care society greater good. still, may well KNOW people infect get critically ill. Happens time. Young people immune; could get classmate ill recover. could accidentally infect family members. could also get sick end long term complications. uncommon. Covid known long term effects, even young people. 

Prior generations deal things like war \*going war\*. Nobody asking kids go war. 

I'm saying comply covid regulations suck, totally does. everyone. would also hate able go parties college. also think much ask college kids follow CDC regulations temporarily, vaccine somewhat figured out. still see others masks + social distancing (if covid positive) like fully quarantine. social media, cars, phones, latest greatest apps. many things available them. asked make temporary sacrifices. really much ask? taking seriously. mean, I'm talking Barcelona least 90% people wear mask street. Schools open, many businesses still allowing people work home.

I believe number cases due huge huge increase testing, many cases asymptomatic. Oh thought referring first week August, said 13%. According John Hopkins, not. Whatever case, 9% still high 5% threshold community spread. Good see agree least yesterday’s positivity. invalidating lived experience? mild cold I’ve ever life. perpetuate ""I surrender"" stereotype even situations like this? There's 190k deaths near 7 months lol. Want pat back now? weird looking check. would thought forgery fake. Seemed appropriate.  Poor Fauci. skills plan Trump cronies fucked up. dumb take precautions, simply caring others thinking dumb admitting brainwashed think big hoax person care himself, maybe bit both.. understand numbers work?

Don't talk 5th grade math hard you. fucking earned it. shit, schools unis opened lot people still work home. can't stop kids touching anything. 7% cases represent 22% population Question: possibly work mask on. mask ( face shield) patients end day I'm barf. it. verifiably it? 


If true Bernie Sanders would dead could accurate new virus haven’t even around year yet?   would word headline? critical NZs approach tourism, lot international students attend Universities. International education 5th largest export. lot people go NZ working holiday visas (the first three months usually spent farm work). provides huge chunk labour agriculture sector.

But domestic tourism picking NZ apparently. Also suppose NZers who’ve lost jobs make vaccum farm workers left working holiday visa holders. Right takes little virus progress point person might need hospitalised. 

Without looking closely cases, mostly younger people infected time around? open back life go soon enough. gone far long way live.

Redditors want continue excuse feel good nothing day. Nah, can't see admitting wrong second lockdown. They'll let everyone die. numbers way rest world rise. shame countries? Bruh, we're STILL first one. mean ... that's worse CoVid? **Sep. 11, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Pretty true responsible/logical statement here.... think make TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION currently short by, 3 years? 3 years wherein some/most wealthy nations vaccinated it? possibly basing on, seriously. general-population IFR disease estimated somewhere around 0.5 - 1% WHO. higher end 1% every single human planet got infected, would still anywhere close 260 million. even know reinfection real thing, likely is. would need every human planet earth contract virus THREE SEPARATE TIMES even approach 260 million deaths 1% IFR.

Sound pretty rational me. headlines people hate him. scarier? Person around less hundred people dies days hundreds set arrive. Nice! Get airline stocks back plsss! nations gotten virus control without taking away civil rights citizens, Sweden. little late.

Fauci point like Pope coming saying sexual abuse bad Church continues hide abusers. Right on, I'm watching mine too. cut cheese heavily, shoot 2000mg sodium day max (hardly eat packaged food, use enough salt get things flavorful cooking), caffeine, smoked 5 years, thing still kept going alcohol seem make big impact. 145/95 hitting 120/80 pretty regularly. eat veggie heavy diet. parties failed view. dem mayors encouraging people go Chinatown eat. country needs come together smart it, stubborn.

I think lives temporary well. Putting freedom lives vise versa objective outcome. Personally, I'd say lives usually doomed start.

Like stated earlier, sacrifices freedom tend temporary. So, no.

Your box scenario simplistic draw conclusions from. saying it, yes. You’d need make $17.55/hr taxes/deductions pay year. [Looks like fun like grocery store workers don’t hear crying job every day.

Teachers treating job like it’s essential. Ask neighbors stop block parties every week celebrating working man, still getting paid man. Ah yes, course. Based ""your hunch"" journal ""pulled ass."" right now, they're handling decently well. Much better lot large countries

You stubbornly insist they're hiding millions millions cases deaths, insisting moon landing faked say that, called ""garbage"" ""does nothing"".

You still acknowledge everyone locked wore masks. entire point argument.

NY reopened, acting like still strictest lockdown. ""crisis"" minor case increases.

I said people states high case loads/aren't enforcing masks still coming NY. everyone locking down/wearing masks, refuse acknowledge continue parrot everyone did. if, still happening. yes, there's country still dealing countries business usual.

You're twisting words suit needs.

The virus go away. virus still ravaging parts country. NYers traveling areas, others coming NY them. everyone hunkered wore mask, that's we're still dealing this, solid fact. dismiss it, angry, that's is. bullshit article. people dont wear masks people harassed way. post every thread people getting involved Covid-19 relief scheme? ones black athletes it? avoid ones white people things? Probably eh?

Doesn't fit narrative point right? Cool. 

So, like racist online only? outwardly racist people person? so... like USA? nothing states make restrictions regarding religious institutions. States absolutely can, do, regular basis, federal government. allow people basic ability worship, supersede public health. mentioned he's high school. He's stupid kid. one answering questionaire

Where get from? Right, nowhere! Sorry insist live fear us (not bots reddit paid people paying 'fact checkers' censoring doctors speaking out) cannot live like anymore ready riot mass deception. Well I’d say yes flattened curve bit beginning people tired following guidelines since it’s somehow become political. think gist winter coming flu season along need hunker order overwhelm hospitals. never get flu shot I’m good health year everyone probably should, need overwhelm hospitals take chance catching covid well. exactly statement accomplish? Lol

Me: There's 190K dead still 1000 deaths day

You: *shoulder shrug* Could worse?

Well thanks guess lol LOL Google anything. know age group (late 20's/early 30's) people taking seriously live nobody financially secure. Actually quite opposite. college tell life gets infinitely worse after, realize people around get health problems (which inevitably happens get older), work consistent 9-5 job draining, sleep deprivation kids, parents grandparents die. Life gets WAY harder. tell personal experience people know, develop severe mental health problems got older. age mental health issues actually become worse unless well controlled. People financially secure child care expensive, cost living high parts country. many college kids parents help them. even get argument. obviously idea difficult life really get older. 

That aside, Covid RUINED people financially. mostly older people, invested life savings businesses completely lost. Many many restaurants area completely closed down. people backup plan. Unlike college students, future ahead them, people don't. lost businesses, homes, livelihoods. families feed. Covid affected older people way financially! College students worry things. give break.

Does trauma get me? Yes, bothered trauma tells something off, I've shut empathy compassion. therapy coping mental illness stress (in personal philosophy), want live true values. 

I plan continuously therapy throughout career, able recognize need extra support order continue show job well. would never trust therapist never therapy. Xmas still 3 1/2 months away. Doesn’t hurt make plans. Things change better.

Would big gatherings today? Heck no. always change. Never hurts plan case. It’s basically universal free cancellations across entire travel industry right due Covid.  literally retyping linked article. work French public health. one build big enough immune response vaccine, notice quickly matters many people choose get vaccine. Nobody really cares anymore... people simply decided pretend thing exist. ""bullies"". Systemic racism lack social support education direct sources crime suffering poor areas. 


This dude assuming people assholes assholes. sure, are, turn crime drugs lack support system dude had. Good point - *implausible deniability* This. terms infections, country creeping peak first wave. terms ICU admissions deaths, even close.

During first wave, ICU occupancy peaked 6000. Now? 150 so. Daily deaths? 3. (Daily deaths car crashes 2019: 22. WFH commonplace less cars road, may end _fewer_ deaths, again, suicides economic hardship...)

No wonder people longer care. Even government longer seems care. People stayed home flatten curve keep ICUs overflowing, 15% full, actual corona patients them. don’t know it’s clear everyone though imagine people believe narrative want, especially things get tough. doubles leadership split — California small business owner someone working blame fed state they’re closed competitor mile road open? Again, guessing they’ll side like... shortest path pressing issue.

To clear, wasn’t intending support ring fence all. Rather point whatever next based reality coordinated national response anytime soon (ugh reality) people impacted 6+ months. Anyone common sense knows  wanted make sure overload healthcare system. Or... least initial goal.

Tbh pisses off. much sold ""we're going bend curve"" aka ""X number people still get virus, once"" multiple scientists confirmed reality - without vaccine, hotspots outbreaks. 

Yet ""stay locked there's vaccine"". bullshit. Nebraska still state? Maybe they're relying boredom kill virus. figure saw 70 percent age range. I'd love compare source handy. kind social distancing requirements? enforced? % population actually abides guidelines? 

We see countries like Singapore NZ possible re-open without much issues, any, long people flout rules. get one might get much enjoyment smaller gatherings 5-6, surely far better everything closed again? showed up, stayed yard. professional development day. students affected.

And lack empathy nervousness astounding school already lost staff member covid beginning pandemic. fired I’m shaking boots relatively benign disease doesn’t affect young people? OUTRAGE. man wants live life go day mask isn’t cowarding home fear!! Fire him!!! think stupid selfish thinking allowed tell people stop living lives sacrifice mental health coward.

Not mention, sure strange year... current growth rate good could seems spiraling control. interesting try compare infections instead cases. done dashboard built using IFR estimates offsetting infections back 20+ days deaths. offset graphs delayed back August 16th currently.

Okay, well, like said, whatever want. I'm mom. think close people pandemic good idea, not, people behave like people continuing spread virus. New Jersey still experiencing new cases new deaths, fine one yet, people like part reason virus *still* continuing spread, want medal going outside, get one me. stupid selfish. grandmothers dead...right? Well guess case called America flu god knows chinese news outlets didn’t give fuck say wasn’t taking precautions? said wear mask, everyone work isn’t shivering inside hole homes days off. still go shopping, see friends, use mask/hand hygiene. truth old people risk. outliers young may get sick, isn’t lethal disease. It’s comparable flu. Dining worked Singapore without much issue though they've re-opened month. adequate social distancing ensuring restaurants people abide it. Tell us background understanding science allowed notice epidemiologists “unscientific”. Okay zoomer *Bodies going piling streets!*

*Anyone leaving house non-essential reasons arrested!*

*If eat you’re wishing death upon every senior citizen!*

*WHY NOBODY TAKING SERIOUSLY ANYMORE?!?!* Michigan: 10 million population, 993 cases

Ontario: 14.5 million population, 213 cases

I suspect high cases US people--from President average person, longer care virus.

If Ontario 1 460 cases (same Michigan per capita), province wide lockdown--or indeed, nationwide lockdown. never lockdown. Ouch..my pride. Ah! See making actual point value rather distracting deflecting.

How South Korea, water bounded country multiple major international airports contained effective leadership.

It's bad US so-called best country world, good this? won’t get back normal mid-late next year everyone you’ll start see public gatherings, events, etc vaccinated and/ willing take risk much sooner that. People fed social distancing nobody expect keep everyone able join. people miss events early-mid next year others back normal. Source? Laughing ass off! ""We hospital beds used"". world class science based pandemic protocals. Hey Nebraska, reason elected big brain gov?. Probably, going reduce unnecessary rules regulations?, need make sure hospitals profitable? something simple as, nebraskan nebraska? fucking love you. 

My university ""mandatory testing students faculty"" next week. one test single point time going anything, especially takes 24-48 hours get results.

They're move-ins next week on-campus residents big football game soon after. wonder something it... Look, I’ll give lesson lifetime sales. attract flies honey vinegar. y’all hocking 55 gallon drum vinegar can’t understand don’t buyers. I’m doesn’t move customer buy, try something else. do? it’s keep lecturing them, I’m guess don’t sell much. think putting hours teacher kind joke though.They take lot work home stay late. Plus meetings staff parents. Children showing symptoms refused tests. many articles testing symptomatic children.

You’re also incorrect asymptomatic presymptomatic spread disease norm main reason it’s impossible control. SARS-1 spread people symptomatic comparatively easy isolate contain. luck here.

[It’s Easy Get Coronavirus Test Child schools reopen, many parents still can’t find test nearby, impeding fight Considering context message removed ""for incivility"" less, quite ironic. 

Sorry wrong team, guess? I'm glad graduated STEM degree last year really set lifelong prosperity case, scientists would say COVID-19 related/similar common cold. 
SARS blueprint Covid-19 (SARS-CoV vs SARS-CoV-2) researchers seen long term T-cell immunity SARS, it’s far-fetched assume/hope Covid-19 Many people getting money unemployment working Us. French, still belong us Brits  wait lift restrictions know more? isn’t realistic again, isn’t way eliminate something contagious many viruses long term effects don’t shut society   ""Better hardcore alcoholics"" high bar clear anywhere near US cases? Even considering per capita? point standards lockdowns US civilized countries way different. joke suggest US ever united countrywide effort lockdown like countries had. also literally proved point. lockdowns WORK. right. US say done right? Hell no! Football live audience. tf “Six people died covid. We’re sure caught from.”

Not much headline point, it? similar issues decided pericarditis pericardial strain. rested lot, ate zero sugar, focused breathing stomach instead ribs, kept talking minimum, lean back lay back weeks. Fatigue went away first, symptoms slowly abating.

I mention miserable five months pneumonia March. friends symptoms line pericarditis. Additionally, tends occur respiratory infection. self treatments obviously may work her, maybe give Google. French really still la bise right now? would think getting face close someone else's without tasting would die pandemic. Since attendees hardly time attend rally, get infected, bike home infect others, fact rates large sending counties higher non-sending countries strongly suggests differences trends works anyway due local transmission dynamics, direct result rally.

Was one sick person infect 100 bars one night ""brief"" enough? Exactly. hermits want see everyone depressed are. love coronavirus don’t feel like losers ever anything.

And want sell classified ""insider"" specific times ways allowed sell. say mistake Everyone knows Trump talks shit, Fauci confuse people beginning, maybe people take seriously. professionals know Trump talked shit, everyone heard Trump., one blamed professionals. Why? never ask president repair car heal ankle. Doctors related people asked it. Fauci failed position, blame it? know answer, ha-ha No, know people rational. I'm saying got information, did, acted irrationally despite that. They're set ways, wrong are, think discussion change them.

Discussion usually fueled questions, questions answered least discussed logical extent. April wondering (answers parentheses):

How happen (criminal negligence)? supposed stay safe (wear mask clean hard surfaces)? children go back school year (no)? expect vaccine (a real one next year, fake one Trump thinks help him)? get Olive Garden people can't congregate (curbside pickup)? government going help us (jack shit)?

All that's left count bodies wait vaccine. exactly people lying? seems whole lot like we're intermingling administration patchwork 50 governor's statements actual hard statements scientists public policy experts. even worse, forgetting whole lot celebrity ""doctors"" early making false misleading statements. 


I distinctly remember back March sentiment generally ""please conserve masks, desperately need hospitals places social distancing possible."" scientists saying masks work use them, saying work country enough stock 360 million people bum rush stores supply lines them. ""front lines fall"" hospitals speak, due lack PPE, we'd royally fucked 10x worse. 


And right. Masks sold across whole country week, took last month restock hand sanitizer even barely find Clorox wipes many places. find face mask store 3-4 weeks. rely buddy who's wife nurse siphon couple masks could buy groceries March. Thought so. course he's depressed. worked entire life preparing moment like this. came, failures around led 200,000 bodies. Think you’re missing step logic here... Can't second wave keep first one going forever! State (Nebraska) lifted pretty much regulations safety procedures concerning Covid. 

Just found yesterday head lady HR hates employees working home got forced back. closed bathrooms one dont mix factory floor employees shut production case someone gets sick. share one bathroom 2 toilets around 60-90 people. really want leave America. I’ve seen lot teacher salaries seethroughny lot seem earn decent amount bit do. Genuinely curious would live paycheck paycheck earn lot people jobs. 

Paraprofessionals example make like $35k even employed many years. could see someone needing work two jobs salary $80k - $100k, lot teachers earn, even NY standards that’s still pretty good, especially partner second income. Can’t even imagine living somewhere like this. think that’s pretty accurate. personal situation small space low ceilings restaurant, given scenario, still think 2022 comfortably guests dining room again. said quiet part loud. Ohio: university. want either way someone else without mask inhabiting space right me. I'd get take out. Write angrily online demonstrations across country marginal violence. pressured relent give demands tell base Biden won. course he'll contradict second later preserve ego angst simmer go back yelling instead finding common ground. Rinse repeat election. Israeli, nah People responsible themselves. waste time worrying rest world. can't nice things (or get rid virus) lived UK ex-pat, “cottaging” assumed, either. first time someone offered “knock up”, ... nonplussed. Nice. 2020! see 12 Monkeys? “I met lion one time didn’t rip intestines. don’t see big deal them.” course. taking data points internet ignores significant reality. worst fucking cold tell anybody I’m sure assume it’s covid Glad OK thank you! Look us France another surge... Let's real.

America deserves corona deaths get. chose themselves, democratically. Please don’t uni. Please don’t uni. Please don’t uni.... phew cases skyrocket deaths ultimately follow know. Lets say 0.5% die COVID, cases go large number, half percent huge number still fairly big number.

If eventually half America infected example, millions deaths.

Also idea hide house, run around frivolous irresponsible activities crap. know 2020 allowed align opinions one two cartoonish extremes. 

You live life, see friends family still taking precautions like wearing masks example. need default throwing parties infected likely contagious. That's madness anyone thinks that's normal place default maybe give second half. 

You live life still take precautions. sensible, community minded thing point. finally please start enforcing employees well.  Putnam CT looking you. Ahh yes, dummies dont live enlightened state. Wow comment though. hate trump, president can't force state adopt certain policies far I'm aware.

They can, however, withhold Federal funding state comply protocols. 

If I'm wrong please correct **nice** way. pretty sure State Federal government's relationship works. evidence exists proves work still say this? know idiots referred thread? one them. push sub really obvious. Actually people Italy stopped now, unless family.  Cases almost level April/May. show sharp decline.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Honestly UBI would help ton right really terrible idea. someone COVID, alive, matter definition recovered is? state mandated positive test, negative test considered recovered, outlier, likely definition changed.

The standard definition someone positive test, died within 3 weeks. someone dies later, still attribute COVID. Thank you! It’s thing AIDS. AIDS literally never killed anyone, weakens immune system. It’s pneumonia cancer something else kills AIDS patients. Therefore AIDS totally harmless!! Fauci, too. Oh God looks helpless course nobody drank Trump kool-aid switching vote. people hesitantly voted suspected actually moron turned going switching.  argument never give amount freedom, amount time, even means saving lives? bad. I'm dick. Stole another reddit comment back:

“Think dumb average person is. realize half even dumber.”

I think applies voting, too. well thanks listening. complicated situation, scientist make sure tell public understand well. decided respond initially.


Now respond others well information article references much maligned IHME model doesn’t even talk shouldn’t trust numbers. Please refrain spreading misinformation sowing discord. exactly America’s enemies want.

Edit: reported original comment misinformation breaking r/coronavirus rules low quality information. Please thoughtful going forward also got outspent Hillary 2 1. 

Currently, Trump raised twice much money Biden almost certainly outspend Biden massive margin.

That's gigantic swing spending could well offset huge chunk disadvantages listed. election much grabs even though Biden better candidate beat Hillary was. So? Almost 200,000 people died US, mild cold 1% 1% infected, fuck would care? lies. know. I'll hazard guess.  Yes. left game whack mole leader tries dissuade play us time, real leadership came states governers. Fauci pessimistic 24/7? Can't second wave never leave first.

Big brain move. Yes, UK heading towards cold flu season, starts around September / October Trump would assured re-election landslide simply listened Fauci put together national strategy. said many times disappear, gone one day. Even clear wouldn't. Combined non response federal government least reason criticism. lovely person lifted truck flag flying back slowed down, rolled window made sheep noises wife got car, wearing masks, local hardware store. So, yeah, I’d call harassment. yesterday. big change giving age breakdown IFR. someone check math though, overall IFR can't 1.3% it? downvote NYC safer second wave since undetected undeterred months, exploded horribly, since first deck lock fast enough. 

Spanish flu persisted since 1918. see coronavirus 2118 Unpopular opinion shut protests too. need consistent social distancing protocols otherwise falls apart happening right now. Dems made big mistake lost credibility supporting protests. Public Health policy needs go major changes interacts public stumbles we've seen.

In ways, can't really pin entire blame anti-mask movement. virtually form public authority average person deals directions given imperative absolute.

Theft illegal. must pay taxes. must present passport airport. could say general public come expect authority figures absolute unchanging policies. 

In opinion, people definitely took no-mask policy Feb/March serious (especially since easy something already doing), authorities suddenly flipped around. mindsets capable adopting fields developing science, information change dime. Instead, public health became seen wishy-washy mindsets, experts authority figures change rules quickly? Sadly, work. words, paying attention.   Yeah, I'm age you, based comment one youngest millenials. 

I'm voting Biden, 95% people know around age voting too. I'd like platform much progressive, voted Bernie last two primaries. Voting anyone Biden vote another 4 years current administration. I've seen likened gun deaths. countries figured out, U.S. refuses even acknowledge problem, live deal ""acceptable number deaths."" return quarantine? tested positive Sep 4 symptoms starting Sep 2, fever symptoms since Sep 5. I've heard 10 days onset symptoms, 10 days positive test, 10 days last fever idk return.  Amish people don’t use Facebook. lies fucking idiot. shred evidence proof shouldn’t trust numbers seeing? didnt. lol remember tried argue data one week ago valid, got proven wrong? Oh had, decades ago. caused days... can't trust numbers reported certain states, cdc point. big brother told us really best time news cycle take things LESS seriously? I've fairly intense hour-long workout sessions surgical mask bad. Tried thicker cloth mask got heavy breath sweat felt miserable surgical one fine me. I'm starting feel fucking vindicated. 

That posted talking about, started cropping kept getting shit r/COVID19 saying first weeks December crazy bad cough symptoms feeling really generally sick tired, typical respiratory thing, like 10-14 days went away. company girlfriend works offices LA, San Jose, based fucking Seattle.

Every time posted people shat comments. flu (I assume) February year go doc. Why? Well, I'm mid 30s otherwise healthy, tell go home, rest, fluids tylenol. reason go feel like crap told already know. Doubly reason whole pandemic going on. wages several months.

Make mind! take unemployment. like dont $50. death rate 0.0067, u need infect 29k people u get amount deaths, means there's like 10x undercount. winter people don’t go much hunker anyway.  sub think hoax. lockdowns practical school district claiming ""there's evidence anyone schools positive."" They're testing. course there's evidence. have. Otherwise would problems due panic. bills pay rich guy  Gotta work eat gotta work pay rent Rotisserie chickens dirt cheap too. that’s Covid! wait whole world gets rushed vaccine go full 28 Days Later. Chinese Cultural Revolution. It’s meant make fun people mental health issues. key open schools immediately. Children known never spread germs cautious bodily fluids. Also, teachers lives matter fuck socialist parasites. really gullible. way completely touch realities. ""every coronavirus"" = ""the one specific Coronavirus that, unlike most, acts way""

Wut?  eat lot convenience foods obese. eating day body needs. lot things done CARES act. Complete safety possible anywhere risk. Wear mask sex Blame stupid assholes pestering them. fuck faith humanity restored award. Wow looks like 20% world's countries still banned entering US, expected, especially given increasing laxity like article's about. 

Mixed messaging, sure. Donald Trump's fault well? “Complete safety” fuck study lmao. Isn’t common sense? Like even didn’t documented evidence respiratory viruses transmitting restaurants. obviously would happen.

Wouldn’t know enclosed space 1 person would likely spread respiratory virus sick? Teachers dying, schools reopening. former may caused latter particular cases, that's really point. warning teachers invincible opening schools lead deaths. 

Clearly headline hot garbage, think changes underlying truth. the* lol I'd go concert football game etc. I'd still would given situation hate I've lost much respect people know OP stated Floridians burying heads sand two months ago. government was, people I’m around. Ahahaha thats jokes idiot co-workers came sick asshole bosses made feel like to! Caution 100% warranted. still wish knew percentage one non hospitalized cases resulting long term illness Anything sounds like ‘free lunch’ government considered communist Americans. anything sounds remotely “communism” “bad” That’s root problem. one them. Lol wouldn’t trust Trump taxes develop vaccine. either. scientists tirelessly working around world need discredited politicize everything America. Multiple companies including AstraZeneca, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed rush vaccine candidate without completing phase 3. AstraZeneca halted trials safety concern. actions professionals using expertise release safe effective vaccine *when possible*. Well already party, doesn’t matter it’s like getting infected Added /s real point frustrated state things know you’re alone feeling frustration. time sacrificed collective good country definitely brutal. many ways. choice ? ones I’ve seeing haven’t great. IQ low created black hole hits home hard. Seems like entire family bought garbage propaganda someone works large resort style hotel hold thousands guests, welcome data. I've waiting patiently find working restaurant dangerous. coworkers think I'm lazy pushy. Honestly, would rather die. flying radar months, working one day, finally got ultimatum. hope shut us walk away due improper mask wearing. 

The guests visiting demanding, stuck pricks every heard of. ones stupid enough eat fucking restaurant. Tips disappeared people understand things work like pre-pandemic. I'm tired working corporation give shit safety, feeding guests give shit either. Everyone eats right suck cupcake dick.

/rant over. would need quite bit longer 2 weeks. Massive testing tracing would also needed. things way finding equilibrium one way another... good shape underlying health conditions?

We'll great, got better odds.

 there's also athletes struck this, many hard time ongoing issues. need unbiased international investigation true origins virus particular focus respiratory illnesses early mid 2019. 

The cladistic evidence Cambridge study suggested ancestral strain predominant US US expat community Wuhan. shame authors self censored article political pressure UK authorities. talk continuing safety measures seems degrade ""well schools already open, so...""
We well too. flew Amsterdam US May 30 people flight. airlines flying make profit. stupid flight attendant best, worse, racist one. Airline needs sort out. Except taxi Uber public transit take... think /s necessary case. Shows know. looks like children getting tested isn’t much problem Alabama according quick google search. You’re right second paragraph that’s we’re discussing here. 
Are saying since age group represents 22% population 22% cases?  really wish they'd handled directly tying relief bailout money compliance strict federal guidance. beginning tour around Nice noticed almost spectators wearing masks. outside close together. recent stages im noticing almost spectators wearing masks though. Covid going around threat forever. Hopefully everyone follows rules go away much quicker relapse Thats even better lol Well searched stated teachers work multiple schools (subs) 1099, could wrong? Yes, I've never know contractors unions. soon employees 1099 contract workers, ensure you, get benefits always provide supplies. Don’t worry, right. SD residents general think magically safe. Many schools playing disinfectant theater yet perpetuate political divide masks. superintendent stated, shit not, “trying get kids wear masks like stopping drinking Mt Dew. way able manage it’s responsibility parent”. essentially made decision us point. Utter embarrassment, however stores require many places masks fairly commonplace. inconsistent foolish pride galore. germany 7000 tests/million france shit control. know controls this? vaccine. one bets off. said “just true”.  Pretty straightforward. 

How Florida listen science? follow global recommendations? 

Literally worse first world countries cases per day 3 months.  NY showed get cases Florida opposite safer way get herd immunity. Maybe something like injecting people inactivated version virus? stop testing whitehouse visitors? Macron order mandatory masks public settings beyond me... ""We estimate 6,454,951 cumulative infections compared 721,245 confirmed cases (1.9% vs. 0.2% population) United States April 18, cases seem account 30%-40% cases, people symptoms get tested due lack availability, access, report delays results reasons. links tell neighbor owns nail salon...I saw sister around holidays &amp; nails, hand bible, swear: took call sister China. hung said sister upset, government pressuring harshly keep quiet virus. felt bad her, tearing up. talked whistle blower doctor family...I came home &amp; told husband &amp; said...c'mon, can't believe everything hear""....I NEVER forget ...I can't help believe 100% There's still thousand deaths day USA. Europe, whole continent EU, 400 day. that's absolutes... /s

Here think dropped this. There's lot going direct covid Oh-fucking-Kay 🙄 I’m 99% sure OP talking SARS, it’s father coronavirus Yeah assumed would first behavior stop, question assertion lack kiss greetings German culture would determining factor. Screw int'l, especially long haul flights. 

Last thing need traveling 20+ hours schlep bags multiple airports (and air port lavs). shit? Jesus Christ America fucking retarded, deserve country. would think takeaway answer people outside go sit restaurant that’s wild. past weeks insanely hot California still see people sitting curbs eating outside fast food place like goddamn people go home!  say they're outliers, truth whole lot people health conditions put risk. Hell, lot probably undiagnosed expensive go doctor's country. We've pubs restaurants open couple months UK generally gotten away it. that's restaurants ""Covid secure"". 

* Tables taken allow 2 metres spacing.
* Limited mixing households
* Perspex screens counters desks
* Doors windows open
* Alternating urinals taken use

We've completely squashed it, deaths flat low, last week we'd avoided exponential growth. We're looking next, hopefully keep death count low time round nip bud. 

But managed get time Summer. definitely helped. would nice use fraction money spent bailing corporations keep small businesses afloat set amount time like 1 month. instead businesses bleeding year they'd wait month slowly reintroduce business people idiots continue idiots end. 

My family still taking seriously - spread across country everyone staying home year. best thing keep families safe still stay fuck home. Americans idiots. 

Unfortunately, idiots loud contagious. don’t want downplay death woman victim COVID. However, think bit dramatic.

Up recently (think mid-20th century), infectious disease much common developed world. People, including kids, deal polio, measles, smallpox, more. people traumatized? Sure. generations children develop aversion schools, churches, public pools, etc.? No. Death part life, sometimes kids exposed it. Kids handle death, especially adults life mature it. Disgusting excuse human being. China gave ether world real nice gift there.

I wish lived Ether World then. gift gave one crap. separation duties powers prevent centralization power

it's USA stays free realize substantial percentage population preexisting conditions right? Obesity rates super high 70 million adults including diabetes effects 33 million people country. Asthma effects 1/13 people. Sooooo don’t understand point here. anything shows concerning COVID be. shread human decency here, avert eyes all. True, understand you’re suggesting. Hunkering , imo, may simple anything absolutely necessary. Going work, nowhere else, etc. think suggested, saying “ prepare “ much possible. CIA agencies forbidden law operate USA Wait small living expenses? using masks possible? anyone point time know best way give someone loudspeaker Internet attempting silent Internet. 👎 I’m ex service industry laid March imagine making money That's Chinese theory brought propaganda everyday offensive Trump particularly offensive one occasion. claim brought China soldier stationed Camp Detrick, major place US biological warfare research. supposedly Wuhan compete international military games event. This, course, deserves much credence endless conspiracy theories spewed USA ie none whatsoever. believe Chinese government much backed away story never fully denying it. good image appear wacky Americans be. US spins control would much like seen 'the voice reason'. Thank sharing reasonable perspective (and us). he's even talking Covid! Unless live apartment, somewhere HOA. order take ""looks bad"" Cause always “If Broken Dont Fix it” kinda point view”. work UV time. UV sterilize efficiently also make blind seconds requires special eyewear. I’m waste oxygen? wear mask follow rules. People like person responded need stop judging people choose go things. thought could things get worse. Sigh. buddy,there deaths underreported India

Do authentic proof people trust ""believe me"" blindly? exactly long time step foot inside restaurant. sharing restricted space many unmasked individuals bet ass type person sit restaurant pandemic doesnt give fuck safe. mu.tiplies likelihood exposure knows much. different telling immunocompromised person stay inside?  start Thank NFL started there's live audience. Add fact 40% citizens didnt give shit first place... Murrca absolutely fucked Honestly it’s pointless anyway. US infected country, pretty much, anyway lol it’s Trump Brand vaccine. want place, now. No, ignore it. compared numbers we're seeing, that's easy way check basic logic actually used study using flawed metrics.

They match, one hospitals group southwest Oklahoma, study missing something touting facts.

That's medical decision, that's political one. competent provider puts politics medical decisions. probably teach instead.  love personal freedom anyone different challenge personal freedom. Hence booed players standing unity despite fact longer “disrespecting” flag. I've learned cook really good food since pandemic started, much cheaper to. Reminds mom like ""If hate Trump much accepting stimulus he's giving everyone!""
Cause fucking money.  what’s case fatality rate US compared countries? That’s metric matters. Everything’s getting worse pretty much nonstop long I’ve alive. fits starts there, trend downwards since Bush stole 2000 election minimum. I’d argue it’s downwards since CIA killed JFK. might argue end gold standard collapse USSR instead. point remains, America decline, golden age over, China’s turn rule world now.

Where I’m from, people still died opiate epidemic corona epidemic, idiots think everything went hell hand basket March 2020, completely blue. People dying deaths despair decade. 

It’s why, cheesy is, Build Back Better good slogan Biden. need FDR tier social upheaval, incrementalist neoliberal bullshit. 2019 living hell, too. normal return to. care health well-being everyone. said, government incompetent carry true measures, nothing much left get lives continue fester homes. People make decision whether leaving house right them, government.  treasonous Republican party enabling him, every step way, dark path. don't, though.

You telling history teacher dumbest authority flex I've ever seen *from supposed teacher sciences*, especially one claiming level expertise (a *teacher biology* ) I've ever seen. literally made post alluding second wave happen. fucking hubris! Fauci give trying help. He’s better shitting mouths.  politics ones people dream heads. Look common courtesy, least could do, basics keeping germs yourself. ones asking change ideology, wear mask. jesus christ people. Lol cases going down. US definitely mishandled many people stupid refuse take simple measures protect others total cases going deaths. curiosity think social distancing practice gone recent months? use places like bars, gyms, restaurants down?

The airline says older child wearing mask.

But honestly, knows? two stories radically different. We'd really need video incident sure. We’re less year this. don’t think people realize could last 3-5 years. Lockdown worked new. Understand despite Israel's relative success strength, significant inequality wealth amongst public. everyone technology / work home.

So, gotten good numbers lot pressure suffering blue-collar sector, lockdown released week two early. 

The ""emergency"" government, supposed fight virus, shown little interest so, preferring bicker endlessly achieved unprecedented goal pissing entire country once. almost enforcement mask wearing social distancing, combine mentality ""it'll okay"" often useful situation, recipe false sense security. 

They set criteria reinstating lockdown, one 1000 new cases per day. Came went. 2000 3000. Swept table. Religous Jew Arab communities resented attempts lock down, indicative general obliviousness (if clue, perhaps numbers vast majority cases).

There also pressure blue-collars avoid another lockdown, virus tends spread poor communities.

Those lockdown worst situations! reasonable assume education plays big part. understand germ theory believe protection deity...

Basically, echo review Spinal Tap album, situation best described “shit sandwich"". Read comments article. Wait? Teachers 1099? still regained breathing back normal got sick early march well That’s basically every post sub right? what’s published everyone like uhhh shit Sherlock. Yet Yeah families 190K+ Americans. live Australia recently last week spent 7 days bed assume flu (I 2 COVID tests period illness came back negative.)

I think flu sickest I've 20 years adult. persistent 39-40 degree celsius fever, chills shakes, headache, joint muscle pain, extreme fatigue eventually cough developed 3-4 days. total fever lasted 7 days cough remained week that.

While feel lot better still suffering little post-virus fatigue gets better day.

I get respiratory panel tests common strains influenza came back negative, I'm assuming less common strain. also tested pneumonia, mycoplasma, parainfluenza, etc. negative.

The health department Queensland constantly proclaims flu season symptoms illness likely COVID something else ""get tested."" Meanwhile, 2 kids daycare spent almost 8-10 weeks form illness winter, peaking whatever last week. 

Am unlucky catch something severe year ""without flu season?"" Maybe. Sucked either way! one knows long immunity lasts second infection would worse. Studies place right now. relax follow guidelines. We'll know actual TRUTH time. Youre following confirmation bias. get infected covid soon ""smell"" it. requires breathing certain density certain period time.

You may able smell fart staring barrel probably get pinkeye. Fun fact, literally every successful organization, process fails generate intended results, generally make progressive changes process, generate results.

Let's say, need hire 10 people, build house. First offer $3 hour. Naturally, one applies job. Next, would logically increase offer $4 hour, $5, etc, hit price point allows hire 10 workers.

The Trump administration makes $3 offer, gets applications, cancels project build house, tells everyone they've saved lot money, signed executive order, making homeless felony.

Well, or, let's face it. Trump offers $100 hour, hires contractors need money most, house built, tells pay $3 hour, take leave it, threatens tie court homeless refuse. signs executive order. yeah dude want go dinner? wow I've never seen selfishness life. dare leave house something groceries gas. dare us life outside complaining news reddit lol. Wealth disparity Britain also horrible quality life declining working class brits since Thatcher. correct points. sides playing dirty politics double standards. getting ridicules.

Edit: Doesn’t Big Gretch! mean, real answer ""well can't starve can't make wear masks"" turn blind eye. point life, I'm trying something new... think missed point. talking Reddit monolith representing one (or primarily one) perspective.

Meanwhile, comment pointed atypical suggested comment chain full people agreeing it.

I see differing opinions time. also see people making similar universal claims redditors — American white males particular political demographic, opposite political demographic, never sex, they're middle aged.

Those Bernie voters.

Anecdotes wash out. fact is, Reddit far diverse (and many others) give credit for. even point trying claim ""Reddit would believe X Y"" — *other bandwagoning?* 

It insipid argument, matter making it, matter reason. get less cases? test less. It’s best solution. SDSU Brookings County - Beadle. Huron (Beadle) hosted S.D. State Fair last week though.

Source: live :) figure? spanish flu killed 50 million people time world population 1.5 billion. equivalent proportion would 260 million today. 

If literally every country minute dropped restrictions therapeutics vaccine research let covid rip entire planet, MIGHT kill 260 million time done. Maybe. obviously going happen. Ooohhh look concern troll trolling. 
Would like shiny star effort? idea people ""take personal responsibility"" pandemic ludicrous unless also believe people masking socially distancing possible.

And yeah 350M issue, Trump declare United States 4 different countries, equal size, population Germany....and drop cases immediately 0 coronavirus defeated.... Good luck living delusional mind. 2-4 weeks cases start turning deaths, likely see different story.

then rising 2 weeks now, yet there's nothing Trolls putting politics lives. Pathetic. I’m seeing deaths like country is, doesn’t mean don’t hear see types suffering. I’ve seen friends family members lose jobs may never come back. Neighbors lose house. Grandparents haven’t left nursing home 6 months. Kids slipping depression attend school computer screen 7 hours day. Businesses close doors forever. I’ve experienced different means bubble  That’s said. disingenuous dangerous. It’s contributed mask situation US today. shit propaganda? count last 5 registered deaths neighbor Norway, go way back July 31. Sweden start counting yesterday. well said March time massive quarantine people told stay home work, explicitly remember stores busier ever people used time work vacation go things instead actually meant for.

Since official mandate end April, pretty much 100%, like 10% people nose moment (and wear face-shields, assume medical reasons). Nose-out definitely increased last months.

Compliance places (at least indoors) always good supermarkets though, terrible though, usually places smaller groups. Outdoors, rarely see masks.

Mid-sized town (~125k population). someone hospitalized spreads it. 100% representing spoiled, self absorbed, careless brats exist around US. college students, course. many today's youth. refuse take responsibility. Even though smart enough get college need message. Even 10 year old kids smart enough get barely message all. think college kids need different ""message"" lol?

How recent Yale study suggests true tally deaths Covid-19 could substantially higher number confirmed deaths ""Cant second surge battling first."" Trump point say US doesnt second surge therefor better country. Well right anything point, know he's wrong this. apocalyptic people died, many continue die I'm American, outside prospective, think people nervous are.

I've saying thing over

 think church setting example showing love helping viral pandemic complying safety measures. appearing selfish ignorant defying safety guidelines directly effect communities. We've outbreak Church. responsible wash hands wear gloves prepare food Church others. presumptuous enough simply say ""we trust Lord rid germs, bacteria virus hands."" 

We people responsible safety other. even political issue. 

Asking us mask distance sin especially global viral pandemic. Pastor MacArthur sinning agaisnt God's word. love MacArthur provided justification disobedient governing leaders. convinced reason defy temporary governing mandates viral pandemic. 

Only order us defy God's word. commanded obey then. 

How obeying pandemic safety measures mandated leaders contradicting God's word? Face masks distancing large gatherings? response he's simply convinced. That's God says criteria obeying orders leaders. Ordering us take safety measures safety not. 

Pastors congregants getting infected dying churches spreading virus communities. isolated gap experienced known symptomatic cases yet (his congregation claims) mean asymptomatic spreading taking place spreading virus community. 

Our Church (75 members 3 already, 1 died). Two local pastors it, nearly died suffered horribly. Churches spreading virus. 

There nothing ""peaceful"" helping spread Covid-19 viral pandemic. sinful unloving heeding safety warnings God put authority. Yes confusions along way. That's science. always updating revising position new information comes in. 

God provided us means come together momentarily media, outdoor tent revivals etc. love Church pastor MacArthur, disobeying rulers, offending world spreading virus communities. He's simply wrong cmr, case mortally rate. reality city state next nightmare state like N.Y Florida etc. Statistically 8 times likely die Covid-19 right car accident. Yet agree wearing seatbelts right thing do. 40k per year die car fatalities. Covid19 killed 4 times 6 months! Wake church. 

Scriptural quarantine:

Isa 26:20 ""Come, people, enter thou thy chambers, shut thy doors thee: hide thyself little moment, indignation overpast.""

Scriptural face covering:

Lev 13:45 leper plague is, clothes shall rent, head bare, shall put covering upon upper lip, shall cry, Unclean, unclean. (Unlike many virus catch, covid know spread it.) 

Quarantining covering faces keep spreading infectious germs virus scriptural. God revealed knowledge us thousands years ago. called responsible, love care safety fellow man. cover faces cough sneeze (covid-19 airborne spreads mere breathing talking studies show). wear gloves wash hands prepare food others. pray asking Lord remove germs, bacteria viruses skip part. faithless towards Lord, responsible loving caring practicing safety measures. 

We wear face coverings keep possibly spreading covid-19 around us. Like germs covid-19 know sick pass others. Asymptomatic spreading rare yes combined presymptomatic spreading account 53% covid infections major driver spreading.

I wish Christians think faith covering faces even God's word. tells us it. disobeying Lord. aligning ""new world order"" simply covering face protect others moment. Spanish flu got it. scriptural shows love consideration around us. 

Shame us Church, light salt earth told loving considerate neighbor simply covering faces temporarily pandemic. spite serious real believe pandemic is..... people dying, pastors dying congregants dying. mentiom 73% die suffer long term permanent organ damage. I'm afraid going see damaged populous years come. MacAuthor simply wrong numbers. says 99.99% lingering issues. love ignorance deadly. like walking highway setting table dinner saying 99.99% car wrecks never happen here. VIRAL PANDEMIC!! works statistically. spreads. vast areas ""nothing happening"" time area next epicenter, next nightmare state like N.Y, Florida, California, Texas, Arizona many places world right now. Thats things ""go viral!!"" 

We seeing ""low numbers"" far mitigating factors we've doing. treated like MacAuthur views today ignored ""another flu"" would deaths millions today!! virus multiple times contagious, covers wide range horrific symptoms types people! novel!! That's must error side caution contain it. 

Wake church.

I'm afraid many brothers sisters irresponsible saying trusting God covid-19 virus yet trust God germs, bacteria virus may spread washing hands going church know flu. Yes trust Lord also must part .... (just like washing hands wearing gloves preparing food.) Let excuse avoid responsible. freedom comes responsibility. Please scriptural loving wear face covering around others viral pandemic. May God bless people, Amen.

MacArthurs reason obeying leaders ""he's convinced."" That's sinning. Thank God giving us experts understand epidemiology virology. experts world wide conspiring together freedoms people. Many convinced wearing seatbelts. Yet biblically required obey law long making us sin. Lobbyists banned paying legislators way prosecuted violations.  surprised? all? doctors surprised? Upvoted truth. want see Trump gone much next person fully functioning brain. Unfortunately Biden way make happen.

Can think situation you’d ok temporary loss freedom?

For example, would locked box 6 months (with food water) meant family’s lives saved? Trump corrupt piece shit, Biden already bought paid too. choice illusion.

New York one earliest, worst hit parts US. lot people fans Bill de Blasio (mayor New York City), even worst critics admit well he's handling COVID.  guy might made one least informed statements I’ve ever seen. several months virus approaching 1Million deaths. world population whole net increased 56,000,000 already year. expose infection ppl don’t it?
are serious right now? bad person. fuck anything, try belligerent asshole. Nebraska mostly rural big problem anyway. That’s society US works. individual rights choices. Follow CDC guidelines, uniform. Outside that, individuals need decide risk tolerance. I’d rather live authoritarian rule like China government decides things me. Thats cool study hut frances gdp declined 14% swedens declined 9%

And numbers arent much better sweden rising time fact recently seen sharp rise,

This outright lie. Using source, Johns Hopkins, 11 deaths past 7 days. 1.57 deaths per day. *nothing* diminish took strong position

So political stances cure diseases now? already showed mobility data proves ultra-race model-citizens stayed houses.

Arizona less dense Sweden, still dealing it. Population density nothing it. hands still feel like two balloons? Solution stop travel states except essential things food, medications, etc Well, sure found out, little woke trooper. love getting cardiomyopathy and/or chronic fatigue syndrome. must smart figured out. viral pandemic requires self restraint, discipline sacrifice curse people lived land freedom liberty wish entire lives. read stories people told visit hospitals, doctors ordering palliative care elderly phone call (giving morphine), moving sick elderly care homes on?

Seems difficult many get hospital care.
But hey, least say ICU capacity! hope US govt. funds project. Vaccine validation long term process. need promising treatment. Unlike Remdisvir, needs administered IV, administered orally. promising. However, ""in-vitro"" studies seeing light end day ""in-vivo"" studies. Let's hope pray works. mean countries 350M+ people? Remember times Trump printed poster sized GoT meme himself? 3% anyway. magnitudes lower. Oh, you... come every thread spread misinformation? Fuck off.   shitty troll trying downplay virus.  Jared? Hereeeee gooooo browniessss go Part isn’t parenting culture—it’s life easier now.

Let’s take grandfather. born 1930 poor family. mother died childbirth young, baby didn’t survive, either.

Structural fires common back (more flammable building materials, primitive electrical systems, less effective firefighting). elementary school burned home sick. classmate died.

His father served WWII. Several older boys neighborhood (think 17, 18, 19 year olds) died war. came back wounded.

He lived steel mill town. Workplace safety less strict back then. Occasionally someone knew would die accident.

Medicine less effective. Aunts, uncles, grandparents died younger. infectious disease would sometimes kill young person. People likely die home hospital, front row seat process.

He experienced child, common. Almost everyone dealt this. people experience lifelong trauma. Pain? Sure. PTSD. serious comment? can't tell anymore. assumes people dumb enough put learn think anything wrong all. Yeah pretty much. it’s usually 20-50 people far know. might places there’s people allowed police don’t resources check every party meeting.  Don’t bother arguing person. It’s worth it. Go see family, need keep sane. funny look Americans. Everywhere else wave considered cases dropping close 0 2-3 months. United States, 1000+ dying daily ""well pretty much over"" LOL Zuckerberg falsely equates online content moderation ""allowed express all"". weird since Alex Jones silenced despite deplatforming 2018. absolutely disgusting. trans guy gives horrible anxiety flying. hear stories others set scanner packing (a weenie) need get physically searched, molested will, ‘hiding suspicious item’. testing per million. US 280k India 40k. details. Masks, open windows, hepa filters, outside classes, testing contact tracing work really well. Wishful thinking unwillingness extend unemployment benefits. would good thing?  I've saying since March - millions people realize economy went evolutionary-scale event old jobs never coming back. Many businesses still running fumes likely close coming year fallout wrecking cash flow. Many employees wholly lack technical skills work remotely new environment passed laid ""don't catch on"" quick enough new way business. 


It's kind interesting, think predicting would automation trucking industry first kicks ""economic evolutionary event"" putting couple million truckers work nowhere land. I’ve seen graph looked spike goes spike down. line consistently dropping though. It’s like you’re weighing every day you’re gonna spikes weekly average dropping week you’re definitely losing weight. They’re Trumps numbers [admitted tape lying downplaying said they’re accurate, Trump says they’re not. Burden proof you. Didn’t know .00039% population considered large U.S. experienced 17 outbreaks 2018. Three outbreaks New York State, New York City, New Jersey, respectively, contributed cases. Cases states occurred primarily among unvaccinated people Orthodox Jewish communities. outbreaks associated travelers brought measles back Israel, large outbreak occurring. Eighty-two people brought measles U.S. countries U.S. experienced 23 measles outbreaks 2014, including one large outbreak 383 cases, occurring primarily among unvaccinated Amish communities Ohio. Many cases U.S. 2014 associated cases brought Philippines, experienced large measles outbreak. Remember actually done pretty good job making happen, far moment. standard American diet (SAD) responsible people can’t go full work day without taking shit. I’ve never used toilet work. hope hell vote reproduce.

I 'yes' these. 

Seethe harder. Bob Woodward spoken up.../s Even true, unlikely vaccinations coming road, want ""work way population"" once, taxes health care system causes unnecessary covid non covid deaths. also many unknowns comes long term damage let go let everyone get infected. 

And rising Europe lockdowns ended, people got complacent began taking summer vacations. plenty countries success keeping virus bay, general economies least damaged. RIGHT?! ugh amazing mental gymnastics man...mind blowing. know? see people wearing masks everyday. They're minority big deal. Tried that, Reddit busy getting pissy opposed vehemently. That’s opinion.  choose security liberty short sighted fool lose both. state least lol. changed definition ""recovered"" make 15,000 active cases disappear thin air last week. There's reason trust numbers. state local level changing definitions manipulate numbers transparent. Perhaps like live. so, congrats. remember people call idiots *always vote*. Meanwhile geniuses laughing statistically skip election. shit gonna kill man. Everyone always conveniently forgets this. amazing many countries brag numbers half much testing US, less.

European countries - guys 10k cases per day, testing, that's really, really bad. “Medical training.”

They fucking told us wear masks March April. told us contact transmission greater aerosol transmission.

....then complete 180 everything.

I respect doctors training endure I’d expect accurate answers timely fashion. takes forever get anything accomplished medical community.

Deaths young adults due colon cancer rise years yet nothing done prevent deaths. Colonoscopies still recommend 50 years age decades. Maybe people die medical community chooses something it. That's life Tegnell's regime - can't die fast enough elderly.  two different viruses infect cell reconbination event occur. bikers needed drugs see Smash Mouth together, sorry. Literally day four posts saying immunity lasts either long almost all. isolate afterwards immunity it’s worst outcome. novel virus know almost nothing about. understand long term impact contracting virus even show symptoms. thing odd amount mental gymnastics people go justify going gym getting nails done global pandemic. antibodies know cross react spike protein extent, people diagnostics best use combination Receptor Binding Domain, small part spike protein meant bind ACE2 assist internization. 

As far antibodies go, N protein nonspecific non-neutralizing theory, protective antibodies would proteins outside virus, results low titers proteins involved. 


There cross reactivity, first 2 months different groups looked whether preexisting coronavirus exposure led protection. neutralization assays, focus passive antibody protection, bind. may cell component, cohort studies enlighten us that. 

At moment know:

1. Coronavirus immunity shown protect Antibodies wane 2 weeks could non protective 50-60 Tcell immunity could key, unsure moment (an article cited earlier. I'm depressed He's liar truth average person US board preventing spread, took lockdowns seriously, wore masks consistently, limited superspreader events, etc... would need hunker today. 

I'm Canada, 8.5 million people province 4.5 million one metro area. numbers good start. 1000 new cases per day consistently city. deaths Canada here.

We locked down. sacrificed. wore masks. Everyone board. other.

Today seeing bit resurgence. resurgence 200 cases/day hardly deaths anymore, maybe 2-3 per week.

This could US too. still be. need national unity this. need everyone get mindset sacrificing greater good. Everyone. 

Today going much harder compared 6 months ago. that's price poor leadership national message. Yeah, going hurt LOT things LOT worse now. longer delay, harder going dig mess.

There 3 month solution USA. going take close year hard sacrifice EVERYONE expect things improve. start now, may never happen. worn mask several times grocery stores one stares. think people report staring self conscious Exactly - never disappeared. society seems straggle along without shutting every winter. long ""I take responsibilty"" way down, fine. Check rapidtests . org Michael Mina's videos youtube. Harvard professor epidemiology released solid modeling shows 50% people rapid antigen testing everyday, Rt collapses. weird illnesses besides virus Patently false statement. Everyone run across opposes coronavirus mandates actually uses 9/11 perfect example shouldn’t implement measures set precedent governors gain control. I'm sure right people literally naked sure flagged trans every time mastectomy. Seriously would arrive full beard shit, get flagged tits (concealed clothes) dude grope boobs check there. scanners definently violate privacy. Yeah, overlap Venn diagram surprise all. Mama always said, “Stupid stupid does.” Police shootings account 1,000 (mostly armed) people per year, vs almost 200,000 coronavirus deaths past 6 months. See, USA place ignoring rules warnings. Humans general petulant, selfish, ignorant children. matter born. helps overall leader knows wtf though. need start listening experts..why hard? like 1940 again. love joe put name it. Goes show cheap really haha. university told dangerous study Portugal. Mean allow people hotspots (Amsterdam, Rotterdam) commute daily campus. Fuck them, Portugal much safer. cleared up. That’s fine, know didn’t need way got fucked people support didn’t worry starving homelessness pandemic. It’s fact life, didn’t way. mean yeah numbers dropped lot seem stay down. 8th 22k, yesterday 36k. Makes sense. reddit - unless panicking coronavirus get downvoted. try bring rationality this. Germany well controlled. US not. key difference.

Even Fauci said schools could reopen precautions places virus well controlled. 


If Americans could get shit together, could reopen schools precautions. Oh yes. CDC weight recent weeks best estimate based incomplete data. Sometimes adjusts up, sometimes down. necessarily need single leader, though. could put together kind task force experts ... original ones could, wasn’t perfect picture definitely got good view. company making forced remove scanners airports replace current version much privacy conscious. important doctor appointment can't miss next week. first time I'm enclosed space others since Feb. choice would postpone could life-threatening. 

Any tips staying safe doctor? R95 P95 masks good N95? have. true city ? city apparently doesn’t problem. Boris going called UKs trump even virus. anything, Trump American Boris one forced go back work. Wtf. 
These people want go back work. Total fraud fauci , one listening going restaurant. recently learned Germany different states/Länder responsible well. However, people seem enough consistency people following recommendations.

The German system advantage allows degree experimentation help situations situation lacking precise information. However limits that. People want consistency Similarly Sweden always gets pulled anti-lockdown success mandate. However, people followed best practices safety voluntarily government made easier people symptoms stay home.

With Sweden never clear whether kind ""herd immunity strategy"" goal.

I think true people Nordic countries default socially distant people Mediterranean, example. want judge this, think situation clear advantage.


But thing is, Sweden different society. perhaps easily collective-thinking, conformist society West, followed nations East Asia Taiwan, Korea Thailand. lot Swedish people follow guidelines without mandate. problems communities really consider part society, centers outbreaks, happened Singapore. solely, sure everything could make worse able take vacation sick days rest? 10th amendment mistake. Americas fucking morons. expecting twist end, hilarious. no, I'm world obstinate disillusionment  would claim that. would claim US ranks better terms excess deaths per capita terms Covid-19 deaths per capita cases come less less deaths, death rate number begins fall fall fall. really don’t clue talking about. Sorry mate. 

Opinions aren’t enough. There’s lot packed admission can’t protect vulnerable society without protecting everyone. worst part dont realize literally leader would given wayyyyyy that. depressed. scientist, extra hard, though. put stupid people, AKA TRUMP charge get shit results. 

they selfish losers think harming Jail time way handle this. Start jailing people people start listening health orders. Gonna make sure spreads uninhibited accelerate herd immunity. looks like we’re pretty damn close achieving that. Still, imo, predicting epic loss circus. Prove numbers *aren't* real.

Every state numbers readily available, look at. New York Times does, Worldometers. They're looking CDC numbers, they're pulling directly states. Unless think there's vast conspiracy, 50 states secretly love support Trump curtailing numbers want look good? United Kingdom also part world. Therefore, using ""World"" tag post correct using ""Europe"" tag post. chance false negative situation extremely high (not chance got infected anyways high first place).

People would shocked learn inaccurate tests generally are. church going anyways spam appeals reaches conservative supreme court. ain't going work. Ikr. Eating quite bit. restaurants taking seriously. one felt done nothing... Tables always every one taken... left.  
We continue support restaurants taking precautions. I'm stupid. fully believe dangers Covid. wear mask everywhere. going support local businesses.  
I problem. 40% new cases 18-22 year olds... colleges. amazing! love timeline! New Zealand China got wrong folks. highlight H1N1?

that's Spanish Flu lmao arent free responsibility acting like politically motivated all. isn’t good argument. 

We don’t every country mandates, countries situation. applies state county levels. California gonna need precise disciplined rules Montana. Similarly, metro area county 1mil+ people different rural county less 100,000 hell even 50,000. similarly, rural Americans seem grasp concept live remote areas, actually live isolation rest world. base whole worldview happens town, issue affect directly, literally care. works ways necessarily trust Chinas public statements, obviously something right since control don't. That’s local product. It’s imports cost lot local currency. conclude happen US well? Come Canada dude. AFAIK viruses exchange genetic material among themselves. Mutations arise gentic material incorrectly copied, trait combination. ...b b said masks work can't trusted.

/s LOL. We’re depressed, Dr Fauci. 😢 Yeah bud that’s thing. husbands rare disease disorder immune system. Unlike people like think, would normal life expectancy, would living normal life right except COVID allowed run unchecked country. wouldn’t know look him, ever. It’s invisible Illness. People love “other” idea immune compromised. young, old, thin, fat, productive workers, collecting disability blending like rest us. kind national mandate would effectively cover USA? Different areas different concerns, city need treat differently rural community. [county CA basically decided longer agree emergency risk residents. realize issue people traveling metros party there, spreading, returning hotspot again. people can't see past tits lol Look ads big tv news stations. They're reopening, welcome back, etc. Like over. Fuck applebees I'm student Mizzou. Choi nutcase. idea he's still chancellor. 

Someone tweeted used work bar cut belligerent. Based recent behavior, claim surprise least. guy throws tantrums.  Osterholm’s CIDRAP historically positive #masks4All - shut up. That’s they’ve shrinking middle class top whole bunch poor people supporting it. Well, enough Germans knew did. called city-kids, know, ""cool kids"" like 16, 17 going clubs shit. certain type that. Still decent answers deaths low? wont.

People die.

 people’s problem.

So America way. don’t constantly vote ineffective leadership like f*cking plebeian sheep Americans are. Sounds like CDC issue, FL say visible?  problems visible like breathing problems.  know businesses alleviated legal responsibility exemption. proof required- least Ontario- many layers onion gets ridiculous many levels. Hey, figured you. Stop negative nancy! Wastewater studies place 2 3 continents late November. hear phrase “hunker down” one time... like 4 decades!
Mincom launched February 22, 1974, ended 1979. 
There’s much info program woman Evelyn Forget studied impact experiment, search.

The Town Poverty program 1968-1986.

During ‘70’s many experiments guaranteed income. mean use right ur family member poops. Stuff like that. Ventilate fresh air. Ok *specifically* White House forcing hand? Nothing? response all? 

What utter bullshit, lmao  Like - shit Sherlock Genius! sure hell think great I'm worried hourly paid people. Agreed. 

If everyone would wear mask, use social distancing good hygiene, wait vaccine bad. Yup. 100% people realistically do, would better status quo. workers stay home so, everyone wear masks (no argument, edge case, bullshit, unless one 10 people ACTUALLY can't, case stay home). optional bullshit, campus classes done remotely, weddings/parties/non-immediate household gathering/blah. Grandma wait see little Timmy.

Then could actually reopen bunch stuff still ahead we're right now.

Not gonna happen though. Bob NEEDS see brother across country person fuck masks everyone expert microbiology knows better. 


I need pick history book refresh memory hell people managed world wars. absolutely recognize privilege able build financial safety net working also deal headaches shit show unemployment feel 10000 good number Less $4/hr aint paying rent. Taiwan right idea close right amount   Russian puppet kills Americans economy still backfires. 

How Putin enjoying this? whole life dedicated destroying America. He's pretty close right now. Rest peace.

But question is, woman pre existing conditions? always makes giggle redditors think age account value 😂 FReEdUmbZ! Two things mentioned happened me: heart rate would jump 130-150 sitting around, doctor told anxiety, go ER people really sick needed more. back March, I’m still suffering terrible headaches brain MRI next week. So, basically, don't. Mao? CALL 80% ASYMPTOMATIC DUMB FUCK? almost scary many lives comment could saved people practiced this. even scarier many people would argue ""hoax"" free'dumb, flu kills more. Unbelievable pandemic political argument 🙄 go, get bag beans start growing tomatoes apt. Problem solved. buddy cough since March. known years cough fell ill Covid symptoms. test came back negative yet somehow phantom cough go away. sick fuck. like, really, really evil.

""200k dead airborne virus? well, something wrong anyway"".

you evil piece shit. truly hope doctor way related health care. people like never around others. Whoa. Talk privilege. already cash? I'm *mostly* joking.  Unironically get help, Russia links Trump mean they're literally controlling every action. simplest explanation usually truth.

Trump wants stay power, decided keeping economy going would better election risk economy save lives.  Obviously head.  amazing fine people dying long think something wrong them. 

you one sick, evil fuck. easy everyone. family friends spread across 4 continents way keep touch one place. does, yes. believe AMA several years ago former “chefs” employees. Ah, found it. what? I'd rather wait bit see useful data jump conclusions based bad data. homes also fewer travelling nursing staff?  bars already open?? RemindMe! 6 months Politics screwed everything up. That’s say comment without breaking sub rules. Unfortunately without government assistance that's impossible. good chunk America lives paycheck paycheck staying home option unless want people starve  currently 100% working never will. going double death toll pandemic end year generous.  People like blame. said say again, continuing push back measures designed reduce spread virus going find getting pushed even harder us fed whiny ignorant spoiled brats.  going stop one way another people like determine going happen. would think long hard assure consequences.

You might getting back life others well 190k+ longer option thousands follow unless change course. test antibodies. thing Americans don’t believe “socialism” either. Well, US resources systems place. classic cruel US story applies: many people, losing job means losing home.

There alot difference different states whole right US lacks infrastructure help, policy choice making limitation resources. Nope. That's point exactly.  

It's politicized... healthy amount skepticism good idea. Yes ensured everyone virus. That’s impossible way college parties work Kansas. Baseball coach Olathe ,KS high-school. Wow! One worst places be! 

Don't come back crying come temp 102 mild moderate cough, dickwad.. 1.5 million _known_ cases August (I think that's right) multiple total cases. let's put top end 10x. That's 1.5 million 15 million cases. go author's claim sturgis would contributed 250,000 1.7% 17%. 

I bet authors state paper many _actual_ cases figure -- opposed _known_ cases. find 40 page paper.

I'm sure would see huge ring -- ring. Relatively people would left sturgis infected vast majority infections would occured back home counties.

I know answer is. think 250,000 cases impossible people think. likely drop bucket compared total number cases dealing with.  much smaller scale nation size US Saving food doesn’t pay car, rent, electric, water, sewer, trash whatever else. family isn’t going anywhere work, wife already lost job covid government said fuck options America people have? pay bills, ruin credit eventually homeless? Unless government steps help, saving money food meaningless  Sugar bad inflammatory. specify refined sugar. Fruits fine. Take breath, there. I’m trying find commonalities can, patient may higher risk, know keep closer eye them. Spend time encouraging proning, deep breathing. majority folks hunker people need work get tested. would really slow rates. Instead got half ass measures people ignoring quarantines. .... raise hand business shut 9-18 months. 

These people work. supply chain needs people buying shit. COUNTRY 330 million people shut year ok. 

Cover fucking face. Stay home you’re sick. Amazon can’t winner Pandemic. We’ll crush economy irreparably. go week local diner, everyone wears masks serves us walk out. order food local delis times week bills families. 

You frequent small business get sick.  know anyone personal life died car crash cancer means ton people dying car crashes cancer?

**Your** anecdote meaningless case, thousands thousands known covid long haul cases. many even know sure people know actually covid (did test positive) did, may think fine really know fine right fine later. read many cases people mild infection, recover, ""fine"" 1-2 months later develop problems, including blood clots. Provence Combine living terrifying apocalypse like sky's living near California's wildfires. Last year thought get much worse. Oh sad wrong. fires worse, orange sky, dark day middle pandemic stressed depressed. Surprise! Not. carol baskin ain’t far behind lol favorite part shopping right now.

For months grocery store one big line cashiers would call people till.

Until sometime last week made new system, stand number empty till wait turn.

But, people still line old way leaving numbers empty. 

I went tonight, long line 18 people it, single person lining proper way. clearly people lining cashiers, skipped stood line 2 minutes. Crickets. positive news sub it’s crickets. people go saying police scum saying arresting everyone see wearing mask. omg Fast food fresh hot gets disgusting cools down, gets soggy grease. generally eat fast food all, do, usually go sub sandwich pass fried stuff.  Excess sugar generally hard body. soda kill you, processing sugar strain body. think leadership like Oh yeah. It’s going kill bunch people. that’s at. est outdoors eat deserved die, right? evil asshole.

""200,000 dead? eh, something wrong them"". It’s article. no. Mysterious pneumonia first linked wuhan. People travel LA often. Thank you. It’s easy get jaded give up, good doctor hasn’t neither you. Hang everyone, you’re beautiful person important around you. Also vote, cause life lives loved ones depend it! Seriously. People lost fucking minds. pretty bad strategy since vaccine probably less 75% effective less 50% US population take it.  Florida bar owners: fuck I'm selling drinks 50% off.  listened Ben Franklin World podcast (about Benjamin Rush) expressed populous supreme leader He's getting paid care one bit whether rest starve. really can't read ""super duper dangerous"" ""*maybe* dangerous"" figure better option? Really? Yup office got hit cough fever early Feb CA. One still lingering cough. making decisions? Probably not. privilege wait good data instead choose to. isn’t place people interested legitimate questions Read 1984. never happen. middle eat rich, become rich eaten new middle. poor never reach level. Someone reading 1984 Workers workers. parties divide us. dems encourage white collar workers punch down, gop plays fact white collar touch. 

They want us divided. It’s keep taking money us.  read types news articles I’m convinced husband COVID week Christmas. side US 12 days coming back Caribbean started feeling shitty day 13—he count 4-5 days. Figured flu. didn’t lot respiratory symptoms throat dry/rough feeling lost sense taste. OK great Christmas, least 72 hours since fever. even went Christmas dinner family—so it, somehow managed pass parents 70s relatives 80s. never symptoms either. wish wasn’t far past time infection get antibody test. pleasure, sure, time see anything inherently dangerous car meets, provided admiring other's cars outdoors mostly socially distanced. 

Now, getting car random stranger going joy ride probably good idea. tried get back playing pool. Outdoor tables masks. die hards really want shake hands still. obligated remove posts vaccines bypassing necessary time constraints determine harm ones body. read 2 years road headlines saying ""covid 19 vaccines linked cancer"" reality could've caught necessary appropriate testing phases. Mizzou, Choi, Chancellor could swapped place numerous officials across US statement would still true. Jewish new year days awe coming too. Israelis gather large meals services crowded usual. really hope strict lock get worse. end wearing masks public forever, may enjoy reduction colds flu long. mitigation measures stop becomes common again. San Francisco maybe? I've heard e skirted virus far. like inevitably going run course point 20 percent population it. Incrementalism path forward (that is, believe it’s path forward all). 

There’s reason UBI cannot passed universal healthcare. Quite frankly, think it’s probably likely come together separately US. Opposition particular policies, leftist policies general, bipartisan. would need dramatic change political status quo either pass, conditions exist would probably see lot change quickly. rich good ~~deflecting blame~~ mass manipulation

The poorly educated poor people easy target slightly educated richer folks. Easier whip emotional frenzy. Easier get groupthink going. resources fund studies method manipulation works best demographic. 

The whole financial system built punish poor people. Banks fees get expensive year. banks charge 10 - 17 monthly fees. making 100+k year 10 - 17 dollars nothing. choosing pay bills eat 10 - 17 dollars couple days food used right. cannot get really good loans without really good income credit. poor people good income rare credit good credit poverty line prolonged period time.

Then cherry top rich folks convinced poor people becoming super rich simple matter. People believe support rich guy says ""winning side"" get uplifted part group. always support see rich one day. Trying limit much money someone make benefit great sole beneficiary money power. Still waiting place got hit badly hit badly again. 
 
The US can’t even qualify cos haven’t even stopped hit badly. Sounds like state issue. live one worst states testing find test pretty easily wanted too.   govt dont give fuck you. trump administration especially. Positive side effects dining besides catching covid, lose weight (provided cook somewhat healthy) save money. BF watching cholesterol makes meals, he's 15 lbs said bank account looking healthier too. USA USA USA incredibly obvious fact brought law offices Fucking, Duh, *audible face-palm* (he's oddball partner earns bank). I’d trust Biden hold wallet. came back wouldn’t even bother counting money.   Even us older folks happy stuck home need meet people face face sometimes anywhere article posted says that? even mitigating infections do? make difference whether get infected today next month. want lock go ahead Frankly told losing 18 months supposed best years life, years I’m meant young get job become wage slave, probably would killed myself. joke. I’m still struggling now. 

I’m never going get time young form meaningful college friendships connections back. Never. I’m going sent become good little worker ever getting experience carefree years. always something left lose. Lol les contexts n'existent plus je vois  Direct rage complicit nothing gop. leadership haven’t remotely contained virus providing incentives workers hunker down. Let’s least see fucking real essential pay! 

Debt strike 2021 Yet Kayleigh quoting Fauci’s support trump (circa April) press conference yesterday response recordings admitting downplayed virus. wonder reporters didn’t fire back asking Trump therefore sees Fauci leading expert again, since - know - claim praise high value (this week). Legit question. Idk you’re downvoted...

Also vitamin deficient ? We're fucked we? Corona time heads restaurant pictures DoorDash, DoorDash literally buying full price reselling markup. restaurant always try slip receipt bag customer knows meal paid ~$35 actually cost $20. restaurant raising prices, DoorDash super sketchy pretending partner restaurant even though don't. get flu shot also need risk exposure via going clinic... however bring good point, wife almost cut thumb April hospital appointments that... jinx us haha. America defender one's freedom expression? University Missouri simply unAmerican. fact already sources means attempting convince anybody, trying stir contempt choice vocabulary. Legitimate question: discussion lockdowns suddenly become permanent vaccine instead “flatten curve”? I’ve heard PR-buzzterm since May truly wonder goalposts keep shifting everyone nodding sub like always “until vaccine/elimination” vs. lessening impact hospitals effective treatments came play. 

If anything, focus effective treatments, since vaccine isn’t going 100% effective. One need look historic figures *routine* influenza vaccines CDC see max 60% (2010-11) worst 20% range effectiveness (29%, 2018-19), discounting low 10% 2004-5. 

If vaccine ends 20% effective, planning lockdowns 22nd century? Without safety nets etc.  Mao came wealthy farming household. middle class.  lot musings suspicions I’m 100% respond. Greed certainly factor consider, however, dangerous suggest (or outright declare) corners *will* cut without supporting evidence. counterpoint evidence AstraZeneca profiting, manufacturing vaccine, developing it...Oxford developing profiting. work law, assure worries lobbying remove ability sue unfounded. Liability waivers smart business-I’m sure signed thousand liability waivers lifetime. reflection company’s confidence product service. 

A 50% effective vaccine would make huge impact pandemic. said-changing minimum rate efficacy FDA approve doesn’t change timeline all. doesn’t speed rate get results. takes 6 months determine efficacy, take six months whether 50% effective 100%. smart idiots apparently link recipes? know there's subreddit eating cheap/healthy, I'm always curious more. :) Every year hear someone burning home space heater countries? whole thing started infected plane. likely one cares even government. poor teachers students go school risk lives government’s retarded actions Well electo-tainment actual voting part. Personally...I’ll bleaching groceries (and children) rest life. know sounds crazy, we’ve taken microwaving delivered food reason. Probably completely unnecessary, give us sense added safety.  100% agree. It’s government’s duty help us get this. government. mean honest given fat americans are, number like average. Americans would like bit worse that. well that’s fucking helpful. us single, live ourselves, families live side country?

Interesting, usually way around, people families struggling lot more. Yes is. point safe takes precedence fears shooting foot. Also, county currently one one nation's highest transmission rates country. indoor seating allowed already embarrassing. think miles ahead people causing majority problems US. Go visit family, imagine alone this, sure wife kids driving nuts, way better trying navigate alone. Even professionals understand mental toll pandemic taking people, think messaging push right many hard headed people. Yeah lost alcohol. Michigan 10 million residents. Less thousand cases day bad. long wear mask? 2 years? 4? Wouldn’t hurt case emergency. family member go hospital picked flu there? drafty New England apartment solution blankets, lots blankets. got bed go bathroom really to. found someone played volleyball Tuesday tested positive today, found exposed someone weekend it.

I googled find clear answer, but, telling aware? 

&amp;#x200B;

I would imagine people interacted yesterday would risk, QUICKLY exposed person infect others never discussed, 48h symptoms start. still symptomless 51 hours since near person. I’m 99% sure photo article made comment. Thank adding freaking positivity sub reddit would make sense C’est parti !!! deserve whole damn bottle!!  Believe buddy,there deaths underreported India.I would like could compare amount tests done Pakistan India state logic again.

Here,in cases bodies even tested covid often ruled death due medical complications.

The gov playing numbers game hoping instill false sense security people hopefully get zombie-like economy back feet showcasing low mortality rate high recovery numbers(despite obvious inflation).  hell knows answer question. idea ramifications yet. went restaurant first time since February/March last weekend. opted dining outside. Tables well spaced edge tent. feel pretty safe it.

Now schools open, restaurants opened indoor dining state gyms finally allowed open, probably go back careful. going start spreading again. town positive case day 1 school several students quarantine. student went ER mental health issue test everyone covid student's positive test result came back school, asymptomatic. God knows many others well, happen tested. think that's issue. base wants. say he's particularly intelligent person, he's completely hapless. Yeah, mine too.. whoping 13 dollars. Yup. Probably enough time people get trump check day election Paris last summer record-breaking heat - 108 degrees. went dinner one many restaurants outdoor seating along sidewalk. Everyone sitting outside. people took advantage seating air conditioned second floor. Waiting see happens pandemic contagious end like USA. smart. saw younger crowd like 17. bunch kids always clubs italy shit probably picked there. Alcohol leads inflammation. want ur lung vessels heart strong can. 

If u drink. Drink ur booze amount water afterwards. Alternate. given up. like Fauci gonna convince people way. Corona issue people heard about, now, everyone knows it. public informed. Maybe need think different approach convince refuse listen, deal somehow. know could pretty clear right Fauci's messages like really convincing any...more...or like, convincing need convinced. get I'm saying? I'm happy parties take Covid seriously.

This kind absurd fear mongering report.

Yes anyone catch Covid stopped pretending remotely threatening healthy young people people listen you.

If carry pretending deadly virus among demographics people know going listen anything say they'll ignore advice. crap like purge humanity... like matter time human race well know becomes extinct. Makes wonder US second wave would look like when/if get first wave control... stop nothing defend lack empathy intelligence? Teachers dying preventable exposure knew would happen, impact human level? Yes, definitely. don’t understand vaccines prevent deadly awful diseases minimal risk public health. way understand that. Complete safety never possible want anything else work. Weird phrasing. incompetence stunning. wasn’t gov would criminal. seasonal influenza R-value ~1.3, won’t take much drop 1 essentially kill starts.

Even states minimal restrictions decreased R Covid-19 2.5 1-1.5. Obviously viruses behave differently, it’s good sign flu season. failed every single front.

On completely agree. reason nasty painful choice total lack societal support structure Republicans fighting taking care people could get virus control. first lockdown successful. Bibi managed form government. Turn back now, unless self-righteous comments thing.  like fact education actively sabotaged I'm nursing student can't enter hospital right sure looks like faking published data, surprise one.  Willing die microwave pasta. 

That salad breadsticks nice though ngl Financial support small part Israels GDP. Israel would fine without financial support. Ya heard abot imunity I'm big fan hunkering down. I'll take selecting low moderate risks every month depending need. Otherwise living bubble next 12 months. ends sooner, awesome. not, I'll good. usual, college students get screwed. entire year online, we're still paying full price. said relate caring human life? got arrested suspended breaking school rule showed again. Rules created local government school. schools duty enforce rules even see things differently. end day kid addressing wrong people. guess covered article. many backyard bbqs around way many people... wanted go local river reasonably secluded spot even try shit show even normal weekdays lately. 

People finding ways stupid. comment sub praise Fauci CDC get reaction haha  feelings, I've gotten delivery maybe 2 3 times since March feel bad putting someone risk going restaurant. pick restaurants offer easy picks ups curbside pickups. apps due shortchange restaurants like crazy, better order direct tip direct. also noticed restaurants increase prices grubhub doordash reconcile loss, also cheaper order restaurant direct.  lot 9/11 survivors compromised respiratory systems got cancer. remained living NYC virus hit hard, makes sense they’d die higher percentage.

... let alone well enough still working first responders — doubly cursed.

RIP, heroes 💐 lol

You're free express opinion, facts lie. People obese likely severe case disease, likely become infected first place.  
It's likely eat restaurants likely frequently, well likely engage high risk behaviors. described current situation ""whack-a-mole,"" one state improves another worsens.

I've used analogy before, like water sloshing around bucket. There's second third wave. first wave sloshing west coast rolling back. wave going roll around country actually something it. even plan time. least last time said planned shaking system changing things. seems still running challenger. like- dude, president last 4 years. supposed things time. watching TV, sending nasty tweets golfing. That's part politics. supposed governing. Idk, COVID directly negatively affects significant portion Trump's voters - people 60+ years - total aloofness caused many see ineptitude. also, Biden hated way Clinton hated. *have* passed long time ago. point, believe excess deaths much reliable statistic monitor Maybe????

I suggest getting much sunlight runs fresh air possible fight it. thought thing. discovered text messaging group chat little needed FB actually keep touch people.

You making excuses FB addiction. Opening schools push well 1. Idk, he’s pretty wacko real life. assholes complaining taking long trying socially distance wear masks reason we’ll dealing long everyone else. get it, understand government purpose. That's virtue. Neither selfishness stupidity. betting man I'd also suggest Summer months, people outside, getting sunlight, etc., major factor. sitting filling room virus sucking back down. winter comes everyone fake hunker (I know many people indoor dining friends), going spread cases worse, like virus first arrived US.

I think perfect analogy flu, flu deaths transmission rates throughout year. Summer better, predicted, that's coming end never got cases down.

I'm terrified. likely, extremely left, hate biden. 96 crime bill, history racist politics, politician ban guns lifetime, support medicare all? Go home wet noodle.

Extremely left

Proceeds parrot debunked rightwing talking points.

🤔🤔🤔 It’s possible hate federal government get help federal government. Like hate police still call someone breaks house. Based schools already separated cohorts shared member teacher easily extendable.

So happens breaks?  fear piece shit somehow manages win again. daddy Putin best ensure it'll hard Dems win. suspect seasonality factor getting overlooked. look places US similar climates Europe, like New England, infection pattern similar many European countries. southern US seems direct inverse pattern, cases increasing summer decreasing now. Texas temperatures lattitude similar Egypt experienced surges around time.

Outside East Asia New Zealand, think country really handling well. variations cases may due external factors like seasons. friend +12 cross country bike ride Africa two years ago. biggest culture shock experienced noting different local villages small cities could be. could come lovely peaceful town everything clean, everybody farming, working, caring other. 30 kilometers further, would end village houses terrible conditions, everything dirty, people aggressive everybody drunk. comes local policy people run it. case decentralized corrupt government cares making enemies borders allies like fill pockets first.

&amp;#x200B;

That's third world though... curbside times local places reopened dine-in, abandoning curbside cases began skyrocket. didn’t restaurant food exactly three months. new cases began fall, gone one place outdoor bar place order. place order mask step back parking lot wait. based look dine-in crowds last two weeks, short lived. expect Florida numbers jump next 3-4 weeks listen either, areas near complete immunity. plenty potentially naive individual 

AND 

it shown SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies wane/decrease 3 month time period. leaves option people secondary infection potentially transmissible. yeah, think alcohol worser sin sometimes soda okay like bubble water lime 

I would advocate soda u're obese right didn’t say lack evidence though they? that, insurers would know money given plebs would diverted straight back pockets health insurance plebs afford.

Insurers would get board without Healthcare all, UBI roundabout handout health insurance companies. rich people involved would love that.  everyone convinced miracle vaccine released manufactured absurd quantities within next 3 months? mine hanging fridge. letter straight propaganda. Lowkey brilliant move U.S. prevented second wave never leaving first one. Suck it, countries! would much rather leader lie ""panic"". 

Especially leader later tells opponents ""destroy country"" voted in. might seem like it, people like 190000 people dead. zero state support media/corporate class pushing us back work desperately possible, made tough sacrifices protect community staff. Thank part. hope family shop come best can. Nail clippers? full body scans underpaid security people look naked. No, passed ago.

Once Trump took numbers deaths became utterly inaccurate.

The number looking ""deaths normal"" ""excess mortality"", says around 250k.  completely agree tracing far useful (and think app pretty useful this) however, say test random testing sampling population still important. know story confirmation bias one specific case speculative. speculation wrong. :) looked rate testing per 1000- individuals [Germany's 1.8 vs 1.36. yeah, totally right. Thanks educating! article face mask detection, facial recognition. in, video, determine person wearing mask not. software improving facial recognition: identifying individual wearing mask. Nobody ever come close being, charged negligent homicide spreading COVID unsafe gathering lmfao, delusional. Denmark new covid dog Nordics appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* cringe naive view rural America. grew rural colorado, weren’t alone farm time. partied, went restaurants, bars, shopping, movies, church etc. Houston home Texas Medical Center, one famous medical centers world. page bunch stats COVID Houston Metro Area, home 7.1 million people: stats, Houston:

1/43 people tested postive 

1/7 people test positive get sick enough hospitalized

1/10 people hospitalized wind dying

Those hospitalization death rates pretty stable past months. number people testing positive going up. 

You seem suggesting ""just let everyone get sick deal outcome"". numbers suggest outcome would 1/70 everyone dying, would 4.6 million Americans. We're getting better treating severely ill keeping dying outright. Individuals affected formerly life threatening symptoms grapple potentially lifelong damage bodies crippling medical debt stay. 

The largest amount death came many people sick once, hospitals overwhelmed, quick treatment readily available. They're gonna release money right election too. watch. Freedom speech. Good. get downvoted saying first wave. We're end second wave. third wave month. doesn’t satiate person day—there’s room smaller McMuffin meal there. two meals don’t satiate person daily needs 1500 calories, probably don’t know “satiated” means. They’re probably touch body’s sense feeling full overeat constantly. based 70% overweight/obesity rate, adults constant overeaters.

You could eat two meals every day still right around caloric target. substitutions (like soda), you’d within it. people’s caloric target higher well.

And it’s true people eat fast food likely overweight. could make better choices fast food. would cheaper, too. They’d buy less food fewer snacks. didn’t need authoritarian. say months ago:

(1) Wear masks. 

(2) Stay home. 

(3) Listen health professionals. 

Super easy. Could’ve avoided tens thousands deaths. 

Instead acted like moron, pretending like would miraculously go away, followers acted accordingly. Well, I’ll start saying views might biased. Texas conservative, even though biggest cities not. It’s huge state places far apart dense diverse areas. distance political inclination makes Texans unable see beyond city limits. example don’t see police misconduct towns, doesn’t exist. Again, Texans like this.  I'm Ohio, definitely good chance wins. nail coffin... talk 2nd wave worse. Well america ahead game.  


Can't 2nd wave dont let 1st one end. is. could use little hope leading expert hopeless situation know trouble come winter. Stop it, making laugh pee. dick. many people put masks get somewhere, take off. wish could work together overcome done Phase II go direct compassionate use. treatment vaccine. Tri-state area informal term eastern contiguous United States **for several regions** associated particular town metropolis that, adjacent suburbs, lies across three states.

Try again, Really? ""I wonder"" = reality?  Bunch dumb fucks don’t want wear mask social distance one really knows game played people get information biased MSM (their profit motive bias) instead looking freely available data  agree I'm curious hear said ""no alcohol"" yet ""less soda"". Surely soda would even better. also 11th highest deathrate world it. exactly ringing endorsement.

That also wouldnt work America people wore masks socially distanced open, along general hygiene. Half cast Chernobyl. Make mind I'm surprised abortion top 10! :( Look pulling overly broad geography move. Whoops!  Calling flu season bit misleading. like virus season.  **IM NOT** anti-vaccer wont get vaccine approved EU. Fuck FDA, politicized, longer trustworthy. People allowed discuss concern online without called anti-vaccers without social media banning discussion.

That said, fuck Facebook fuck Zuck. Compelete shit, them. Delete Facebook. I’ve admitted 3 pediatric COVID patients none “Covid” symptoms. failure thrive/not eating issues. None respiratory distress. Nobody said anything perfection, we're talking claim guy replied lying, not. new cases also falling people still go work, school, church, shop, socialize. cornfields houses doesn’t mean don’t get together. Also think something said groups people getting actual education sciences- namely biology germs work- rural areas may prone preaching rather teaching. that’s completely different point. weeks.

By time test recorded person probably already sick enough go hospital least days away. surprising health officials didn’t see coming FEMA response Katrina Bush years. George bush hates black people. Donald Trump hates everyone white, rich, republican, 3 years historic behavior demonstrating would destructive towards perceived enemies. U.S. army dead. goal eradicate humanity infecting everyone. Think real possibility 5 figure day numbers hit winter. Coming autumn, everyone back school/work. seems numbers rapidly moving think use shorthand talking, sometimes helpful sometimes not. caught saying i'd visit family election day, even though election day relevant time marker job family. can't say sure that's doing, course. dailycaller.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

It’s literally snowing ash days, still fear “looking like democrat”. We’re “past it” we’re going social distance/cloth mask stuff. curves flattened(remember, original point quick temporary lockdown, flatten curve..) months. Even NY, really real problem-area US begin with, it’s basically everyone else.

So, waiting now? reach day zero people test positive virus nation-wide lift market regulations stop printing money? create “100% effect” vaccine, somehow confirm every individual country vaccinated along every foreign tourist US taxpayers expense? even can’t catch everyone can’t really allow people business usual knowing someone could slip cracks minute..

Even hobby (shooting pool) makes money. Covid hasn’t slowed right MINDSET! Google couldn’t help anything. wiki article all.... messaging masks screwed get go.

Smart people adjust opinion line reality. Problem is, idiots still refusing wear masks still stuck first impression. feel incredibly sorry people think everything 1 sided, always happens side disagree with. depressing state cognitive dissonance live in.

The answer may straightforward developing countries, especially much fragile economies, vast slum areas large amount people brink food insecurity. Honestly, even policies, may worse:

1- biggest problem even universal mask availability, give everyone masks, can't force people wear them. ""fine people wear masks"" best hope for.

No probably not. literal dictatorship like China, we're lot larger France Italy Spain UK etc.

France Spain seeing similar U-shaped curve did. want know ""*extra*"" challenges winter brings opposed now. read article aside rhe headline information. *Fauci spoke panel disscusion* (check) *he said need hunker down* (check) *trump tape bob Woodward* (check) *winter tough* (check) *heading flu season* (check)

Will flu season (*getting flu, flu vaccine year?*) cold weather exacerbate covid something? 

I would figure flu transmission less distancing people staying thr foul weather.

Is new information pass *Be afraid! afraid!* ?? Yes, blame society lets people fail crisis. We're supposed come together take care crisis.

France paying 4/5 salary workers furloughed. expensive them, nobody getting evicted pandemic, starving. economy going come end lot better businesses still afloat able pick left off.  virus didn’t exist yet? ready go somehow..? real question women “the party” it’s party .

Just bunch sad losers sitting around drinking beer hoping woman shows . actually following closely see past couple weeks get adjustments.

Unfortunately you, people follow data closely well see bullshit. Hahn needs resign.

full stop. Downvotes. death threats Reddit. pretty much rest lives then. 

Anybody remember ""It's two weeks flatten curve overwhelm hospitals""? remember. weren’t.

Mom pop grocers open.

Mom pop hardware shops open.

Mom pop appliance stores open.

So countless mom pop shops provided essential goods services, rules big guys. find hilarious people say chance. elected people, elected billionaires afford pay enough election officials make look like fairly.

Your vote count shit presidential election, news anyone remembers 2000 election. fairly misleading. far actual infections first wave, caught testing now. death peaks April. 

Look deaths Czech - curve spiking hard upwards, wave death nowhere near bad first, least yet. Exactly, person’s ideals go far puts family’s well jeopardy. Maslow’s pyramid dictates priority problem complex nuanced rules, lower compliance. leave everyone start calculations correlating moral code, risk tolerance, opinion, read internet, etc, decide wear mask, lot times should, won't, enforcement becomes lot harder. ""But sir, anyone near didnt notice them...""

Having standardize rule enforced, even bit overzealous, lot simpler everyone. live (literally).

I guess kid I'd keep home give special private lessons make sure falling behind anywhere. pick something phone hobby. 

4 months pass fast. Hahaha stupid Americans...oh wait remember months back India many cases wondering genuinely lucky sort environmental advantage get hit bad.

And numbers started rocketing up.

It would surprise slightest there's around half million cases per day given lack testing per capita. Yea, that's brutal right. I'm jealous live city, plan move big city soon possible pandemic over. good family get along with, too.

But lack motivation, totally feel there. shit needs done, rarely drive now. People like opinions don’t like I’m “pro open up” seriously? Italy. Sure Cletus dont actually kiss cheek. kiss air. Thanks! pro maskers  simply spelled way Trump says half time. could, like, pay attention baby. advice morons would put mask baby leave crib, parents kid baby Bjorn actually paying attention child. baby’s going die grocery store put piece cloth face. That’s stupid. obviously selfish person, rest assured, seems like rest entire country also is, hence situation. enjoy winter! yesterdays briefing said increased testing explains part increased number cases. also said know couple weeks.

The part would expected increase fhm warned earlier. Yea came fast tracked right skipped safety others take first.


Edit: mean US Source(s) edit above. caught US, means least two COVID tests showed false negatives slipped cracks.

Not impossible. 
 systematic review accuracy covid-19 tests reported **false negative rates 2% 29%** (equating sensitivity 71-98%), based negative RT-PCR tests positive repeat testing. 
  fun cracking lungs, boomer. hope happy seeing grandma last time ever :,-(  YUP guidance says go: CDC yesterday said dining restaurant extremely high risk, restaurant dining safer going tell us - 

 

 

 correctly understanding Prof. Christian Drosten's explanation Coronavirus Update podcast (in German only, unfortunately, makes sense link), virus hit Germany later countries Germany detected earlier virus cycle – really broken clusters main population – put appropriate measures place. According him, kind critical mass needed infection rates really explode Germany never hit rate. still benefitting that. contrast, countries detected virus late thus acted late, difficult bring infections control even harsh restrictions ... think citing France Spain examples respect. Yeah let’s use fines people already lost jobs. Who’ll enforce this. ever popular US police? thought defund  wait two weeks!!! more, live France area much affected, kiss shake hand Even countries took aggressive routes still struggling economy global, local anymore. ... people read headline think ""great, problem here"". Oh please. There’s big difference Biden Trump. You’re voting old white guy. Whoever wins likely replace RBG. politician (Premier) Canada detest lot time sounds like Trump wannabe. know did? listened scientists public health experts. initial disaster seniors dying senior's homes, number cases deaths quite small compared US rate. Yes, shutdowns since spring economy slowly opened up. province almost everything before, physical distance, wash sanitize WEAR MASKS. right, political issue, competence issue. Trump made worse. compare US numbers almost country see incompetent Trump continues be. American also, want better kids.....heeeeeeelp!!! I'm happy missing anything restaurant workers sure missing paychecks. surprise quite obviously obese. virtually risk young healthy. issue got politicized, longer primarily health issues. 

Covid everything else. 

so, gotta keep ball play, means moving goal-posts. illness never fully recover, wether symptomatic not, actually seems much worse ever imagined me. lot bad news coping mechanism don’t anything good root start rooting bad Yes, really. interviews college guys think hoax immune. interviews saw men only. like people understand holding invisible hot potato harms percentage people, give zero f$cks could potentially passing to, instead trying take precautions all. 

Tldr, trying help others impedes freedoms running around fun, f$ck give crap humans/ fellow countrymen, me,me,me.

Really shows narcissistic selfish today's America is. exactly happened thing fact among misinformation created western media.

To add Dr.Li's involvement case, returned straight work! arrest, punishment ir whatever. Furthermore, he's CCP member!

He person involved wechat conversation several others, singled out? died virus, western media spinned 'results torture'. need test leaving, entering. hard work absolutely waste. health, family's health utmost importance end day (by virtue customers community ofc). silver lining household found new norm, whereas cognitive dissonance hard time adjusting wave 2 turns similar 1918/1919. 

Pandemic fatigue quite real, hang there... I'm really sorry going this, however end day mental health, rest follow. here. idea we’ll see takes days. person get tested day exposure, test negative whether infected (false negative rate 100%) happens takes virus replicate enough picked upper airway swab.

Its everybody. damn near EVERYBODY. curves literally every country show single spike sustained near 0. looks like it’s possible second waves. Easy drink masked straw. agree pretty much everything here, especially Kushner. 

I much wish Trump never elected president. American people (say voting system etc.) duly elected him, we're stuck him.

Kushner? sad sack crap never allowed within 10 miles official government work even fly wall sensitive conversations. mind-boggling authority American politics, much less country's COVID response.  Show way go home. Wow even winter yet. look state state, 2nd surges? California? death rate disease totality like 0.02%. Massive spikes infection rates using test use rate testing predictable. Anything inducing panic point political, reason still see trash pushed 24/7 political purposes aka keep hype train going give excuse mail voting. minute election tabulated suddenly time businesses open kids get back school. magically become non issue. Watch think much less likely. Providing servers wearing masks socially distancing. I've eaten outdoors, keep mask eating/drinking. provide reasoning rebuttals ineffective.

If scroll there's comments ineffective methodology pushed.

OP basing opinion claims proven shown true. elaboration reveals claims they're making even legitimate. happens everywhere 8 12 weeks. get stressed. Death rate (and hospitalization rate per infection) US way compared months ago. sub focuses raw numbers, comparisons know feel little overwhelming. Ad hominems necessarily wrong. instance, tried give speech geology, someone like “this guy doesn’t expertise geology”, that’s valid reason doubt say.

Posting shit “Lockdowns don’t work” organization best concerned capitalism else worse promotes fascism worthy source’s credibility called question. can't change title, that's way auto-populated One longggg surgeee... all. One thing nothing other. all. One thing nothing other. I’m idea. think aren’t holding medical community performance standards.

I like Fauci don’t want hear scolding profession takes months years come level protection, prevention, mitigation cure.
They’ve 100 years prepare, criticism directed towards them?  Yeah, one would object Trump taking authoritarian stance enforcing national containment policy /s

Edit: forgot /s Yeah, kind laughable, states *mostly* control, they'd continue distancing.

What meant potential much worse, considering nobody cares even bare minimum longer. said was, good president, really think things would gotten truly good, even while? Like saw France (which unfortunately second wave), we're seeing China, South Korea, etc.

I think so. defunding education science education particular, increased coupling church state something happened current president. blame lot him, think pandemic be. Well, looks like majority people common sense fixed downvotes conspiracy theory government leader admits directly. That's thing though, it. Someone elsewhere posted comment right wing alt right loons takes over, said ""it starts someone makes mistake."" I'm realizing much that's true. make mistake, big small, bad actors jump blow major, earth-shattering issue shows completely wrong can't trusted everyone must abandon stand for.

They're trying CDC institutions right now, succeeding disappointingly large contingent people. Also differences greet people example. every level relationships physical contact way closer Mediterranean countries Germans. take greetings example. Germany shaking hands even well friendship level. 

And time react. One main hotspot Germany Ischgl returning tourists already two infection steps away first infections italy. gave us 2-3 weeks additonal warning time. Compared france italy shut way earlier even less strict. 

Early deaths likely also relatively low due insane amount icu beds (4 times higher european countries per capita). think Germany ever filled 5% corona patients. work hospital. fuck see single shred evidence lying trash? We're seeing repeat infections.

Why? Beyond fact probably actually bio teacher, even virologist degree even relevant meaningful field, proving CAN'T, teach instead. True. look good 79 played math games last election. matter. trump loses, he's going claim voter fraud deny results. Republican Senate, also going suffer defeat, agree him, thereby also saving themselves, election results suspended pending Congressional investigation.

The Republicans lost seats hold investigation, use majority determine fact voter fraud invalidate results election. commission established set rules elections new security guidelines. rules, trump regime could look alot like used Russia.

By then, trump nearing completion second term. Biden gas. democrats exhausted 4 years fighting US transformed, collapsed Civil war. Oh, America lost superpower status result lack national policy around COVID management. I'm confused they're trying accomplish.

Like want push back economy even prevent free flow travel states nations?

For talk impinging freedoms caring think they'd want done quickly possible service travel industry jobs return normal they'd free work, eat travel much pleased. yet many grateful this.

The continuing pandemic chaos gives many people purpose lives, allows move pet projects right along.. Oh thanks insulting me. suppose leaning T-cell immunity hypothesized driver immune response SARS-CoV-2. might now, passive response would take longer clear infection, potentially giving time transmit disease.

If actually great scientist, would know assume worse proven otherwise. Since nothing confirmed SEEN secondary infections, move along assumption possible proved otherwise. 

The antibodies waning levels would considered low drive passive immune response. Additionally, antibodies necessarily wane long term wane fast, infections find 'setpoint' titer determine lasting immunity. field antibodies memory b-cell immunity, please stay whatever lane gunning for. guy gets it. going potentially getting sick dying problem deal with, I'd utterly fine. Live let live, right?

Seriously, ""I'm gonna live life / enjoy hole bro"" gang literally risk themselves, that'd amazing. guys would live happily thinking issue, we'd live thinking ""we'll take care ourselves"" watch small relevant fraction get sick potentially die.

But no, choices affect people too. That's issue.  Tegnell blood hands: First elderly left die, young kids. Swedes apparently happy do? want honest truth? 

*It's moderately safe unsafe*. gym almost assuredly circulating air rush. even gym completely empty (an unlikely event considering staff people too!) likely still breathe fair amount. 


Air enter eyes, mask mask. mask stop breathing others. cannot create magic wall eyes air. large reason masks fact, better preventing spreading *to* others, protecting *from* others. 

But hand, likely easily keep 6 feet social distance. seems like taking major precautions own. personally, adapted 6 months longer feel need head gym 4-5 months. compared many actions, seems less risky extroverted type activity. World: Keep distance 2m people.

Germans: close? 9/3/2020, received reports 792 confirmed cases MIS-C. cases per capita, vastly inferior Sweden.

Remember Sweden, health authority repeatedly (and still) role children pandemic [advocated keep schools also [forced send kids school.    
All assumption children ""don't spread virus"" actually [believed alone, almost risk. little evidence infected ""leftover air"", vast majority infections happen people breathing/talking room. Avoiding touching face/eyes good idea general surfaces/touch longer believed significant source infection, virus seem spread easily direct access lungs. can't really count end year. wait see covid harvested bunch flu deaths. portion 250k absolutely would died coming flu season count that. number track closely. even bigger advantage: control executive branch along justice department. great odds time. declare victory 11/3 (more Republicans vote person Democrats) absentee ballots counted. seems always win narrative willing go low possible. sold US Russia dodged impeachment. I'm referring quarantining inside home. People congregating indoors public nearly much weather inevitably gets colder. United Kingdom part continent Europe. United Kingdom longer member European Union Brexit. rules across country centralized leadership this.

The federal government authority that. It’s like someone playing virus. Unfortunately think point lot people longer care. unable halt beginning surely aren’t going improve things now. honestly know answer question. work dental field fog room procedure particles latch fall floor. We've told blow ash, instead hose down... Fauci ... shud immigrate Italy. love there. mafia too. happening almost every country sadly type center disease control. link comment? can’t recent don’t know you’re talking about. I'd argue ones made climate change political ones wanted implement taxes combat (literally political strategy) side wants left alone. Canada seems like another reliable barometer. yeah, CDC FDA proven they’ll bow political pressure. Sad part seems USA tight lockdown earlier happened might clear. Ok, shrunk pandemic office matters. proposal mail ballots require registering. again,checks sent people died,do think keep accurate records? Yes, facts lie. Look US Covid case death statistics. see two little humps. waves. need to, go google type ""Waves"" find waves look like. number studies shown youth severely effected depression mental health impacts shutdowns well age group likely economically impacted.  low - near zero - risk serious consequences. I’ve seen number interviews age demographic basically say “why care want don’t care want.” Sure, there’s turds responsible, shaming/please “responsible” message doesn’t work. need understand benefit - amount begging makes calculus go away.

I don’t need figure it’s job problem. it’s pretty obvious. didn't. become political. There's big range possibilities sitting home high risk things like going eat, going gyms, etc. People go semi-normal lives still realizing there's pandemic. life changing sit restaurant months. very, small potatoes compared people past give safe (ex- WW2). Well hopefully they'd records person dead, though understand government bureaucracy moves slowly. would think that's extremely niche scenario real widespread concern. pretend seems like fearmongering. Censuses.

It's hard check names ballot. It’s largest tri-state area nation

Nobody cares. Learn communicate clearly. What's news UK covid? curious. always see terrible US compare deaths per 1M people, UK performed worse. curious! try them. Worse sugar free harbio gummy bears? Pure bullshit. numbers coronavirus either fictional exaggerated since February. dangerous average person never been. average age people allegedly die thing somewhere 80s. 

We science facts now. Fauci bought-and-paid-for liar. year fraud malfeasance discovered actual journalists investigators role Chinese pharmaceutical-media complex hoax going breathtaking. 

By way, want know everyone thread seems agree, dissenting voices banned. 

**When position weak can't stand scrutiny challenge, chances pretty good full shit.** want look Faucis eyes tell cases going go down. government chose post ""deal it"" gif golf course move along continue spending money online defense force painting rosy picture outside. Anyone remember claim community transmission there? can’t national mandate - feds don’t (correctly) authority. I'm one them, I've postponed scheduling recommended screenings -- dental cleaning, mammogram, colonoscopy. European cases rising despite months lock downs awhile ago. quite possible needs work way population impossible Rationale would tell us industries could “survive without weeks,” meat industry wouldn’t first one would want cut, right?

Either way, I’m curious you’d think cutting meat industry would help corona virus situation fruit vegetables need picked handled moved fourth workers meat. seems like either illogical idea one inspired vested interest shutting otherwise harming meat industry.

And seem smart enough know prevented stores stocking meat “a couple weeks” meat industry wouldn’t survive all. Thousands small farms, hundreds “medium” farms, delight large factory farms well would survive... *in turn creating massive vacuum one two surviving industrial meat farming companies suck business country creating massive mono/duopoly wanted put stop first place.

Because it’s like people aren’t willing show guns defend freedoms Fox Box made scared angry. Hes like 85 extremely successful entire life, that's ridiculous. Says tbh, greedy cunt. higher education. Oh sure, it’s completely impossible, pointing math hypothetical scenario. $3, lot less life changing even helping past weeks. Healthy college students party break school’s pandemic pledge.

America ungodly fucking stupid. would actually welcome aliens point. /r/conspiracy seemed believe would happen anytime Trump acknowledging Navy UFO videos idk. point comment? mean... really. classless amusing. Even blatant trolling, pretty lazy. credible studies this? I’m anti-masker (please don’t shoot) know necessary slow spread virus wear mine anywhere go, also imagine it’s probably good breathing regularly especially long periods time. Still, even aren’t good probably lesser two burdens

Edit: reminder come sub ask credible information either supports goes hivemind, you’ll get downvoted get actual answers. Never change Reddit ND SD say? Gee happened recently SD would cause spike. Maybe people would stop shit while...   4% world pop, 22% cases 5.5 times. 190k cases divided 5.5 34k. 

A golden retriever decision making power would’ve fewer deaths. stealing PPE, forcing bids ventilators. giving ventilators PPE Saudis assholes. Getting way Birx, Fauci, public health professionals. frothing masks, economy hits, forcing states reopen. list unforced errors goes on. Yes experts should’ve clear mask usage front. That’s really main non Trump error created confusion people. malignant micro mismanagement main cause much avoidable awfulness. yeah protesting going expected people slowly get tired following rules watch people break rules. checks balances keep sending ballot sent someone who's dead? incorrect, send ballots without eligible voter first registering. combination control efforts, herd immunity (infected people either died became immune) mutation. Spanish flu likely mutated several times course, possible became less deadly, influenza viruses genetically unstable prone mutation. contrast, coronaviruses built-in proofreading functions slow mutate, 10% rate influenza viruses. days longer willing go herd immunity method requires millions die. leaves best control efforts waiting vaccine. Yeah even liberal SIL referred check ""Trump Bucks"".

Alien threat turns opportunity colonize hundreds new systems ... distrust hatred. clearly meant election day driver choices. effed beyond belief. pearl-clutching karens

Now now. Anyone half brain knows real Karens ones implode launch hysterics asked wear mask try social distance.

Use right lexicon. individual governors much authority please

Half issue national leadership told states ""We tell do....BUT, something disagree with, we'll fuck federal funding, school funding, etc.""

So lots nothing. Theres nothing keeping people getting multiple ballots sending back in.

Nothing keeping sending in. 

We checks keep actually counting multiple times. notoriety depends America scared getting sick, America getting better. Think it. People locked half year taken seriously beginning. Also, someone's boredom excuse me. I'm bored - still gone since March. True seen research paper yet.


True well add 1 + 1, would experience common cold flu. keep pretty ELI5: flu pandemic 1918 ended burned global population infecting 500 million people (which 1/3rd global population time). killed estimated 20-50 million people conservative end, 100 million broader factors considered. 

It essentially forest fire eventually ran fuel. 

If COVID-19 pandemic ends way, roughly, 1/3rd population becoming infected 10-20% dying we're looking ~2.6 billion people infected 250 million 500 million dead. English-speaking nations well lately. time 'don't wear mask go normal business' 'dont wear mask stay home, mask wont help.' Regardless mask helping lie, telling people stay home. 

They wanted prioritize health care workers needed around sick patients opposed people need leave homes. 

They could suggested DIY masks like parts eastern europe didnt know effectiveness material DIY mentality US hold candle consumerism, given option people would bought masks.

Regardless, masks said effective people didnt advocate them, including POTUS. Trying say well flip flopping wont wear one spite idiotic anti masker beginning.  another thread. You’re like “I lost six months life virus” it’s like, I’m playing smallest violin dude. It’s sad can’t go party. Must suffering lot. people exist though, it’s like didn’t problems year. mean, alluding conspiracy *thousands* millions global leaders? bad apples ignored, steal sides' template argument different issue. Love body choice sudden :) CoRoNaViRuS cOmPlEtEly cOntRoL sInCe That's funny. RIP USA mean facts don’t seem matter people, someone know caught covid knowing someone knows someone died covid isn’t really going thing proves covid “real” him.. fall flu almost nonexistent steps taken fight corona. flu usually kills 40k year U.S., shouldn’t continue use measures fight flu, even well future? people surprised, know obesity arguably one worst preexisting conditions Covid due internal inflammation. Perhaps also low Vitamin D. could even stay put emergency timeframe. got plague spreaders man. get discouragement. depressing everything right, everyone around (friends, family members, society general) pressuring loosen up. outright violating boundaries may (getting close, wearing mask, etc.). 

It's annoying *all* right things start with, none would've progressed along far has. estimate 2 vaccine keeping would good too. Wearing mask easy, there's nothing afraid about. Anyone says otherwise lying; 10yo kids wear without whining.. hope tougher 10yo Hey look, another warning. “deaf-ears” yet, still people left want ignore guy ? People tired pandemic want over, they're hard time accepting reality.

The pandemic treated bad meme 6 months ago keeps reposted. I'm sick hearing this. suppose Hillary charge nobody would died, America would locked since February we'd still locked end time. know what? Shit tons people died states run Democrats. political matter political party charge, people, lots people, going die, still even Bidens charge.  *the government needs give us back money loaned times like this. Can't hunker everything completely open Canada's national broadcaster trying wake up! That’s judgmental you, assume impulse control measure intelligence, I’m tired people engineering thinking they’re way smarter people business. extremely smart engineers, extremely smart businesspeople - extremely dumb engineers, extremely dumb business people. people fall somewhere between. Uhhh 45 year old man repeatedly tried access daughters school told go away Officer Friendly would probably shoot ass people like would saying COMPLIED uncommon. Putting heat shrink windows another huge improvement. Term limits would increase power lobbyists Washington, last thing need administration, filled lobbyists assorted grifters. live Baden Wuettermberg area. partner sore throat past 2 days called hotline arrange test. told unless pain, he'd need isolate need get tested. recently moved Holland also reported sore throat lasted longer 24 hours, could go get tested. guess they're testing many people milder symptoms. 

They (Germany) also medical infrastructure (e.g. respiratory equipment) cases, even serious lower chance death resources spare. Holland, they're also wearing masks Supermarkets, Germany are. I'd say centre (where live Utrecht) equally populated. Tour de France happening limited public finish lines (like 50 people instead thousands), zero public along roads. make sure people crowd, marketing cars usually donate goodies along way (like free fans/caps/food samples) giving anything year. Like hell. teeth evolved eat meat will.

That said, wife eat vegetarian least couple times per week, weight control. Americans seem least little individualistic. experience, see common good. Advice falls empty ears still gotta pay bills buy groceries.  Nancy Pelosi passed relief bill **in May**.  fines taken business owners allowed unmasked customers in. sorry fauci, give shit anymore. congregations 50 unsafe, protests 10000 totally cool. lol. common sense 9 Hey, that’s Florida did, don’t give credit why? Time needed hospitals wouldn’t become overwhelmed. didn’t happen. There’s reason think it’s large possibility happening venues reopen. medical system six months prepare, isn’t now, won’t ever be. argument never scorched earth approach possible infection, limiting spread distributing new cases longer time period. “Stay home vaccine” delusional. dad works life insurance firm, said they’re predicting gonna get extremely bad. Yet thinks it’s overplayed smh. whats funny march (since im japanese contact frontline doctors china/sk/usa/france) prayed global incompetence, expected dumb HOLY exceeded it, even gov refusing deny entry china, EU+USA dems saying banning flies china hug chinese campaign.

then people afraid contacts said buy stocks cause treatments protocols working (months later western countries would learn that) im making bank recovery. Hey man drive truck working distributor sorts. work food distributor driving truck (non cdl) make 42k year paid benefits two weeks year. experience necessary good driving record license.

Plus get take home ton free food buy whatever cost. 

You pretty much boss; see mine like twice week never deal douchbag cuntstomers ever again.  ""Let contactlessly deliver covid party"" vaccine require booster point? There's someone spreading info dying today. slow death report lol July. Disagree. CFR exactly what’s important. doesn’t matter much spreads it’s fatal. 

We also hugely disadvantaged pandemic situation. largest economy world huge amount domestic international travel (for leisure business) compared many countries. large nation terms land mass population. many cities high population density. diverse socially. island like New Zealand, it’s easier control infection spread. authoritarian like China weld people homes keep home force mask compliance. 

No country earth set disadvantages. countries remotely resemble us terms size China Russia, fewer dense population centers, authoritarian options control. 

Yet, despite disadvantages, we’re average little average western nations. Could better? Sure. might sacrifice get there? 

You can’t win left. Trump enforced mask mandate guys would claim he’s “dictator” “authoritarian.” leaves states he’s enough. want hate someone. You’re literally insane comes Trump need wake reality. do! obvious, measures overlap. people take precautions covid19 northern hemisphere flu season benign. no, really bad Yet another example citizens stepping feds feared tread. 

Best luck, Texas teachers 🍀 Should, won’t. real lockdown would’ve ideal back March. Many vaccines 50-60% effective best. 


They ""hope"" COVID vaccine 75% say 50-60% acceptable.    Deaths per capita pretty comparable US Italy moment. Funny cuz Germany shit regions. separate ain't got problems. Could people germany simply less idiotic bout '' frEdOm'' obey law instead whatever tf want wear masks asked president? wouldn’t called Covid-19 would 🙄 dimwits  every sperm sacred! Okay everyone please vote election. Please. Almost everyone stayed home six months, losing mind stay healthy. vaccine probably three four months away, idiots decide catch virus take chances. would think reasonable choice vaccine two years road, even one year, people fools. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* approved emergency use, course it’s going used. makes quiet? Many vaccines (like flu vaccine) 50-60% effective populations. best. still get COVID even vaccinated. Vaccination mean fact ""hope"" 75% COVID vaccine 50-60% considered ""acceptable"".

Vaccine success relies herd immunity reducing likelihood someone getting sick. eliminate risk. why, even vaccine, experts say life wont return normal another couple years long take build immunity population required vaccines. Without vaccine, us much longer another 18-24 months.

The less people get vaccine, longer take longer you, even vaccine, risk.

People seem understand this. pandemic type Hollywood movies get wrong. Assigning evil intentions people called projection. Dumb stupid separate entities imo Ah must Trump University student Well... Thats did. would keep hospitals manageable level theyre now, minimizing deaths buying time look effective treatment vacciene. need know long youre immune covid it. Im advocating lock down, im advocating keep restrictions see second wave keep distance wear masks go big parties virus spread faster handle. going get rid virus, we're scientists. We're buying time. whereas Italy, Spain, France, etc. 85-90% range. 

And Spain approaching US deaths per capita per day again. Moderate risk yes, quantity quality determines winner. ok, quality ignorant stupid incredibly incompetent leadership, hey - even quality. Another balls study? Go nuts 🥜 so, it’s we’d actually someone office would something instead actively killing people like incumbent. First, world big place, 7 billion people. vaccine requires -70F storage going practicable majority, storage temp issue Pfizer. issues often shipping package opened, long kept open, long vaccine kept refrigeration temp.

Pregnancy going issue health care workers high concentration reproductive age women. vaccination program account fact going pregnancies detected time vaccination. actually *watch* it, find boring beyond insanity.

But OK, idiots crowding, we'll see ICU within 21 days, following similar timeframe lovely skincrawling new covid ""ad"" I've seen today (where lovely lady attends family event ICU day 21, apparently morons need spelled out) honest, USA carried amount testing Trump would prefer, US would one lowest. Umm...they Freshman hanging adjacent dorm room. rule expects 17 year old children behave like full-grown adults real rule. reason universities re-opening need cash pay faculty. know folks work Northeastern BU whose jobs hinged amount students returning on-campus housing semester. longer employed furloughed past month so.

The kids deserve punished, sure. let's face it...nobody deserves leave higher education institution 35k debt either, let alone roughly 250k costs complete 4 whole years Northeastern. know solution institutions, one strictly punishes kids constantly shifting goalposts ongoing pandemic. 6,000,000 people died starvation year! closure borders less spending humanitarian aid, due lockdowns, threatening push millions starvation one many humanitarian disaster wake lockdown, usual poorer nations get bad deal. 

The notion lockdown save many lives *world* possible, false panacea. lockdown might reduce risk you, grandparents, trading false sensation control, putting millions people risk. selfish shortsighted.

Don't confuse good world good personally.

France Spain especially 10k daily cases. 
It indeed timing issue, expect see third wave well US (California well now, reopen soon. see new wave probably November) brag it, might let you..



(See comment link article FORBIDDING schools making masks mandatory...) Yeah? Interesting. remember college tuition money cares act   America mean, Civilized western countries hunkering helped quite bit. think difference large portions country give shit. guys half-assed hunkering anything. Nov 5. Israel reopened schools 100 cases population 8 million. 

How many cases now? 2k-3k day. That's like 20 times increase. 

Play LA....can hospitals take 20k sick cases day Yeah, wife’s watching people die (nurse) saying thing since beginning. add “aw man downvoted me.” Part lol  4th year medical student here, confirm. year great.  thoughtful well articulated answer. Well that's take 1 2 week long averages and/ graphs. day-by-day reported number vary based reality data gets reported (office hours, etc). Communist ! /s I’m Melbourne would also like know answer question. Yeah, close friend lives one those. eat every weekend 2 summer trips. life! must nice rich ivory tower. People need judgy close minded insults right now. Venting frustrations insulting strangers worldwide crisis like kicking person down. think one decision defines person lived. Making mistakes part life, things also happen beyond control, illogical assume everyone particular situation got via path. basically saying rich people entitled kids.. Make better life choices?! see future beforehand control life death?! Even people decent savings stable jobs unemployed cant afford food rent right now. Daycare extremely expensive. kids know families afford. Lots people use school daycare sorts work. free, residential taxes go toward schools pay handout. illogical blame person poor economic situation economy shutdown months. beyond anyone's control.

Sure life better. downside losing life ample food nights relaxing cats, watching great TV shows chatting reddit; losing freedom, losing trips beach, on... it’s even close worth risk There’s much anger sub. cautiously go restaurant, helping small business survive, forcing servers put risk? order food delivered, helping delivery person feed family, pick don’t endanger delivery person? seems whatever decide, someone say I’m f—-ing moron. 😢 NFL workplace testing. good thing. Far workplaces same.

Lack availability local employment screening test massive failure local testing supply chain- something largely left states individual communities fend themselves. confirms 266,796 estimate false. 

To get anywhere close number infections spike cases people actually live like Denver Minneapolis. there's one.

The kind politically-motivated speculation economists paper damages credibility honest epidemiologists public health officials.

[The Sturgis Biker Rally Cause 266,796 Cases COVID-19, Sturgis Statistical Misfire, *Wall Street Journal* *~~Washington nfl also paid companies able come rapid result tests. every right access testing endowed. admire that. restaurants reopened get shut down. open in-person dining time ones never visit even over. grossly irresponsible. Many remained takeout (and something would pandemic, reasonable.) 

Many forced caseload shut down, state forced re-closed lasted month later.

If willing risk employees public's health then, little confidence operate safe manner future, want reward hazardous behavior many restauranteurs operated safe safer manner. Covid-19 *serious illness* world, wonder find serious. Chicks, dicks whips 🤣  Ok, argument! interesting see numbers flight Wuhan around Nov. worry would caught Nanjing. start? Exactly. Thank western countries then. Maybe get that. western countries made ""white privileged""? racism, God. I'd lean toward false negatives, personally. Sounds much like COVID. think kind dumb. kids seem much smarter. They're worried killing grandma worried messaging? Wtf kind parent you? God hate people like this. US still way less responsible much Europe, unless France, example, proves otherwise. think people's mental issues helped messaging coming implies going gone weeks, couple months, reach level cases positivity rate, whatever, get time course basic situation changed there's new target. 

There's saying ""people adjust situation long know situation is."" people told truth in, say, February, going need intermittent lockdowns consistent mask wearing, social distancing restrictions gatherings least next year 18 months, would ultimately able adjust plan future lot better. UBI done well lot trials around world. Wish pull end. probably facing chance furlough end year things kept going like this. bad deal around. Telling friends private group chat careful (while asking tell anyone else) isn’t “sounding alarm”. person responding doesn’t want learn. want judge don’t understand.  Deaths figured already sick December. usually around end October years thing! Especially younger people involved, around age. can’t think image show obesity factor. 

It’s heartening see Mexico proactively responding reality, banning junk food sales schools minors way countries ban cigarettes. 

I wish government would mobilize bit this, help empower people lose weight save lives. idiots everywhere. exist doesn’t mean we’re idiots know I’m saying? Obviously people wear masks less problem.

Friend two one thing. Avoiding large gatherings eating another. Well that’s case problem OP said Sars-COV-2 acts like every Coronavirus. That's patently false. doesn't. act like Sars, also act like known coronaviruses. prove point? excuses whatsoever.

Jan 23: Wuhan shutdown city 11 million people. Even idiots know serious. 
 
Feb 26: ""The 15 (cases US) within couple days going close zero."" --- POTUS *Winter coming* That's hard believe, I'm French, country use greet kisses well, since pandemic began even give handshakes anymore, let alone kiss hug(unless close family members clean yourself).

This pandemic, feel, change cultural aspect us, maybe 5 years 10 years people forget happened continue kissing. literally does. affects young people two orders magnitude less people 60. That’s “spare” means kind wondering safe screeners were. often get close hundreds unmasked workers/customers/students day enclosed space relatively little PPE. surprising.

Only Ohio Pippin : lockdown?

Aragorn : already it.

Pippin : We've one, yes. second lockdown?

Merry : think knows second lockdown, Pip. CANADA HATES FREEDUM!! FRENCH . . . SOMETHING . . . sumpfing . . .  I’m Houston it’s fucking dumb. state different. Damn point cost less car payments gas drive two times month lol Blame Sturges. Sweden tourist hotspot. also lack tests, testing availability, test reliability actively pursued current administration testing meant case numbers would go make look bad.

There lack contact tracing enabled spread. 

There confiscation PPE purchased states hospitals redirected Federal government.

And course big 'civil liberty' - mandating masks.

But I'm sure still explained enough. Even though 'slow' according you, information available you. access Reddit, access facts well anyone else. nobody fucking plan goal? get infection rates way contact test/trace? Well lot areas infection rates pretty low reopened fuck done. keep hospitalizations sustainable level...okay...well what’s level seesaw reopenings closings based that?

Even New York...which done well crush curve...doesn’t goal. Rent still back owed, 25% capacity ain’t gonna cut winter. end goal? true many others r/covidlonghaulers

People really underestimate virus. Prior COVID healthy college student. It’s months still trouble breathing top muscle soreness, irregular heartbeat cognitive decline. ER given 2 breathing treatments hardly gave relief. medical appointments booked month pulmonologist testing. 

Please take virus seriously. Healthy young people immune, still don’t know long term effects. Nothing do. Protect yourself. USA stamp passport countries let in? Same, except December. Separate doctors (then now) told sounded like ""new virus"" way test it. covid symptoms became known, seemed likely. probably never know. Certainly. since tested symptoms match common symptoms infections, pretty much impossible know. I'm simply asking unreasonable suspect could covid. unreasonable assuming common cold. Absolutely. Planning event / time period going awhile mine. Picking couple things extra time order ( grocery p/u ) gas propane. Solar camping like items assembled.

Perhaps stick watching funny youtube videos? think least gain kind satisfaction there. proofed yet.

Closing school detected case school becoming infection cluster. It’s funny people relying practices used Spanish flu good precedent though didn’t horrifying mortality rate. happen work HHS? many additional deaths?

Why people uses cases prove point one day next say cases untrustworthy metric used.

How bout stick fact untrustworthy metric never cited. ""It happen me, probably wrong.""

Ps. I'm sorry... joke make. 
This real issue solution joke know question total lockdown, nobody want total lockdown. need wear mask, take proper precautions wait vaccine.. heaters *way* expensive run furnaces, electric worst way heat space. 

Here northeast tons old houses crappy apartments still heated electric baseboard, electric heat pumps, electric radiant, plain old electric furnaces. That's say nothing huge number mobile homes have, terrible insulation terrible furnaces. uncommon suck $1000+ propane single season keep home cold.

Using $50 space heater create ""warm room"" use main heat keep house warm enough pipes burst real life. Poverty sucks. Joe Exotic ready Russia wants happen every American. That's president lie us downplay virus. 

Just wait invade we're weak enough. think probably right actually. think mix bubble inflation. would mean roughly 25% cases US past month caused rally.

Not seem unlikely general basis- would produced huge ring cases driving distance rally data back that's sustainable thousands thousands restaurants I’m tired hunker down, stay in, stay home message.

Trump wants think he's beaten wants convince Americans life back normal, every country still working flatten curve. 


It sucks way Americans banned travelling anywhere almost globally, US leader wants step initiative, truly locking locking everyone else out. Complete safety never possible. Coronavirus appears given people illusion bubble wrap completely enough Dude go back simping girls r/selfies sure info simple google search. copy damn link. Typing reply took longer would've find single source.

I care people ending unemployed homeless. That's wanted take care shit months ago. people like busy bitching ""freedoms"" handle locking 3-4 weeks slowly reopening. could've reopened months ago checked damn egos.

But get unemployment, homelessness, raging pandemic damn time. Way go sport 👍🏻 

I'm coward? scared verify claims. scared stating views go ahead record say a-okay 190k deaths counting. won't, cause fucking delusional. Anxiety alone treated disorder. Many take seriously. Take look Fibromyalgia, lot medical professionals think real. Even pain self inflicted anxiety doctors still treat it. sounds similar treating long haulers. fact? live since 24 years seen 2-3 times among germans. source says 7 died 9/9??? little complicated that! Yes, technically true, let give example. developed polycystic ovaries pregnancies, turn effected hormones--its cycle, weight gain pregnancy caused hormonal imbalance, turn makes harder lose weight. pcos pregnancy, lost baby weight cysts went away, definitely challenging lose weight would someone without hormonal imbalance. 

Also everyone blessed metabolism. things improve it, body threshold, things genetic influenced diet eating habits child largely responsibility parents. 

I'm petite person, thinnest--110lbs, eat 800 calories day maintain weight. eventually became much burden hung around healthy 125 lbs eating around 1300 calories day long time, upper threshold healthy weight bmi. 

For women, especially, hormones huge influence weight metabolism. 

But sure, fatties eating bon bons. 

Fwiw, I'm ever morbidly obese, think we're really talking here. old new middle school, fifth grade like junior high Honestly agree. coming contact anyone covid positives problem. But, soon come contact anyone covid, becomes problem stay vulnerable too; great amount friction lot intelligence sharing foreign domestic intelligence agencies US late 1990's early 2000's. allowed bin Laden advance plans 9/11. Oxford small enough could’ve walked. don’t see school open two weeks, hey, gotta get room board money. Slipping future Fauci hear Covid-19 over? 🤔😂 Yep daily death toll remains around 20 day pretty irrelevant fuss disease seems become less harmful Time passes?

France 67 millions people, wanted worry way causes killing 20 day probably would never get homes.

Covid-19 might started much dangerous days looks like fear maintained media least Western Europe fatalities dwindled. oh sounds scary maybe get covid test moving in? Especially travelling airports think vastly overestimate many people category destitution describe. You’re basically describing homeless. agree I’m problem, life good there’s plenty way worse nearly bad you’re making be. 94% Americans mobile phone. 94% US households car (or access one). 96% US homes televisions. Etc etc etc. Perhaps seen much worlds poverty compare average Americans dealing  optimistic think school altruistic. understand maybe consideration highly doubt it. countries arent accepting american visitors nless youre kylie jenner rich really deporting people? (not condescending real question) arent charging dorm fees making money people staying here....   October buy votes Yes... testing capacity slashed shit too. they’ve found highly infectious strain COVID Malaysia. Great. get married justice peace party later. Marriage wedding... unless leader emerges like past revolutions! China, much difference warning traffic ticket, least warning cost money. longer stay inside lower Vitamin levels get. So, point time decide go outside, susceptible coronavirus ultimately death virus.

I highly suggest supplement vitamin D. Staying inside worst thing reality someone could do.

If vitamin levels sufficient, 77% less chance getting covid 97% percent less chance even getting admitted ICU. 

Get vitamin D. best thing vaccine comes. fact, sufficient vit levels proven help person better response vaccinations.

Get vit D. Yes numbers correct moment. sad done, it’ll probably much different. I’m ready saddened won’t able holidays family it’s necessary Additional follow up. It’s hard immigrate tk Canada well reasons. mean? Man, Mississippi making fun us. Oklahoma entered new degrees laughingstock. Nope, hate broad statements, whataboutisms people twist words make point.  

I’m glad agree everything claimed wasn’t true Yep. dad positive day symptoms couple days getting tested spent hour signed trade school. he’s going week 4 sick.  pronlems? don’t think people think like that, least don’t. don’t see black white. father terminal cancer. assure balance here. wear mask around - absolutely. issue getting confrontation 50 yr old man local blood transfusion center didn’t want wear mask sitting next dad yesterday. doesn’t mean neighbors healthy young couple don’t right go restaurant friends over. stay away wear mask I’m around groups people. make use rapid tests I’m concerned might exposed. children virtual elementary (and issue others sending kids school comfortable). There’s win-win without extremist either way. True. immigration easy people think. order immigrate get mid level job employer show higher American fill role. 

If want immigrate non refuge it’s going almost impossible unless lot money put up.  

So. Sure. could make lot money us 900$ per month aren’t going able immigrate. 

I’m Canada time go maui look seeing hard would move year two work one many jobs.  It’s extremely hard get work visas even hard immigrate live there. mean, everyone party already infected harm foul, right?

Edit: reading article, hosts infected, guests.

People fucking idiots  battle lines?

People getting back lives. I’m talking maskless college students beach concert.
I’m currently watching NFL game 13k fans attendance. It’s time move precautions. half users aren’t US Well, comforting. Blame Ford Mustang rally real morns think non N95 masks make difference Number one. company's motivated greed. strike balance safety profits every single time. Corners cut. think lobbied congress got law passed nobody sue side effects vaccine? go thru vaccine court.and they've paid millions. 

Number two. fda lowered efficacy rate vaccine 50%. Flu 60%, shingles vaccine 91%, measles vaccine 93%. suspect FDA pressured vaccine could chance election. Mississippi right now: thank God oklahoma. Quite weird way building consensus okay Yesterday two tied 589 deaths per million. Im shocked people haven’t. US testing course high per capita infections appropriate state support looks like spreading January February. mom got violently ill two weeks February (deep dry coughing, fever, joint pain) convinced it. works elementary school, likely got there. Thankfully long-hauler fully recovered, convinced COVID-19, believe her. goes show silently spread, know scale problem late. Probably gov least trying something it. 100 deadly millenials would moved ass like climate change. Sounds like maybe they're way avoid international students deported due federal requirements that? fall experience deepest despair ever suffered nation. children spread virus grandparents, compromised parents, aunt, uncles. families decimated, closest loved ones succumb painful deaths. Trump may well prevail rule us like king foreseeable future. Update 

The new record is: +302,593, deaths: +5,992

(The day reset midnight GMT+0, worldometers's data)  curious pass smell test? even consider posibility? Alright buddy. You’re one guys likes argue people mean lack testing completely new pathogen come onto world stage Less 3 months prior? Pathogen test for? test developed, manufactured, verified, shipped. quick happened? fast think things actually go? understand basic depth science involved? far mask mandate, seem work protesters lining streets shoulder-to-shoulder last 4 months major cities. forgot, coronavirus social justice conscience, infect people Marching good cause. would think group nations who’s literary tradition traces back Ancient Greece would know thing two hubris. Restuarants bars tend shitty hvac systems. likely recycling air like cruise ship one infected person infect everyone building there.

It boggles mind government set strick hvac guidelines business wants open. That's works. initial viral load exposure may impact severe case is, catch it, got it. 

You're going acquiring additional second hand viral load significance compared infection producing wait another recording leak. virus originated United States. think yesterday actually deaths take time. Nobody seems care 9/11 - one event killed 3,000 people - everybody's forced take shoes plus security confiscate nail clippers bottles water boarding plane. recommend wearing mask stop hundreds thousands people dying? Mah freedums!!  seemingly overnight people went spending 9am-5pm home instead work. instead using employers toilet, likely used commercial sized rolls instead consumer sized, everyone using toilet paper. Pwease daddy Fauci notice me.

But real though, could give shit particular person thinks. I'm morally believe correct. look Pond ain't happening UK either... Canadian, us assume we're another four years shit.  read first sentence. Coronavirus literally researched medical purposes cause low mutation rate read first sentence. numerous studies providing evidence immunity. keep extended goalposts indefinitely would like, can’t change that.

Lol We've first surge since March. got dates wrong. year 2025. threw baby back ribs grill day. Turned better I've ever restaurant  Uk part Europe? Interesting  really hard. Quarantine 3 weeks reduce active cases, give everyone UBI over, keep pushing wearing masks/social distance, rinse/repeat spikes cases. 

Us sitting home make money billionaires though, happen. get worse. Pressing f worlds smallest keyboard Dr Fauci. Yes, everyone totally tells FEMA fuck recovering disasters, everyone definitely always says ""fuck feds.""

Really? You’re arguing something different form original argument. original argument people won’t pay loan back won’t. even admit it. 

Future spending different. hypothetical good think is, would done. thousands years civilization around, hasn’t done it’s good investment. isn’t earth shattering theory, it’s bad theory billions people decided isn’t good thing. Hell Im depressed too. Im finally really growing tired this. Im tired wearing mask time, Im especially tired feeling like everyone risk shouldnt around people dont be. killed social life. Sure hang friends feel fine, good luck meeting new people. single guy, pandemic worst. Women rightfully hesitant meet new guys already, worry COVID means wouldnt dare meet someone new. Approaching women already hard enough, almost unacceptable. Plus talking women mask doesnt really help things. Sorry pointless rant. hate life right now. COVID made everything worse. can't tell sarcastic..or..? totally agree everything said, particularly certain extent flexibility needed, hand people demonstrating whole we’re horrible dealing shades gray, critical thinking risk management

my argument think Governors eliminating shades gray rather President. Whitmer, example, banned interstate travel fucking live vacation destination people Chicago Detroit come to. People town want Detroit folk coming hit hard cases (unfortunately, first cases came Detroit people vacationing here). However, banning interstate travel Wyoming, example, make quite much sense. 

Contrary comments might portray, I'm favor strict guidelines- again, opinion governors setting these. I'm even fucking American. Look statistics see deadly it. naive believe one doctor says. Covid19 response political politicians across countries want blamed deaths play cool safe. also bet many survive infection permanent organ damage, something like 37% infected - even asymptomatic cases.

I'll go 2M permanent organ damage among survivors. meant driving whole, think much deaths life long injuries occur cars wrecks year. ban cars limit speed limit 10mph 'save lives'. 

How air travel boats, ban crash kill thousands, selfish people want travel. Imagine lives saved banning it.

But even ignore point masks distancing flu season, imagine much lives could save werent selfish winter closed economy down.

 dont next year vaccine Covid shut every winter stop flu spread, one except essential workers save lives. 

Why dont ban fast food junk food stop heart disease obesity? healthy gov food allowed. Imagine lives saved preventable deaths. Sure thousands jobs lost think lives saved !!!! 

We dont things economy would destroyed, one would start businesses jobs would probably outsourced rather domestically remote. new talking point handed NPCs ""Trump actually control anything done anything anyway.""

Its far beyond true ridiculous, they're dancing graves 200,000 dead Americans. going improve without consistent rules across country centralized leadership this.

Not defeatist, there's nothing now. well poisoned people country refuse follow recommendations. *never* follow guidelines now, matter consistent, centralized approach guidelines. Best many people adhere long possible, hold hope vaccine available next year. 

I fucking hate fellow countrymen right. subreddit 24/7 doomsday porn. US said masks don’t work unless you’re doctor, something effect. Look Cuomo BDB mishandled NY! agree effects another shutdown, we've kind put position see choice they're going really get colder weather. hospitals start getting overwhelmed, they're going throw switch. 

As people's mental health, here's thing: I've struggles terms isolation, understand. live alone, pet right now, lot close friends, I've working home since March. let clear - I'm saying us expected perfect. things - like socially distanced outdoor happy hour, drive-in theaters, eating outdoors restaurant tables many feet apart - pretty much okay, things, like indoor gatherings people household bubble, aren't, regardless lonely people might be. 

I'm us (meaning individuals, businesses, government) everything provide safe options folks ""life worth living"" comes socializing. worries summed well last sentence - people weighing risks making decisions. pandemic, public health emergency, can't afford people deciding whatever heck want they're bored lonely taking account they're risking far lives. puzzles spread. dad assume safety protocols aerosol spread place throughout treatment. didn’t infect others cruise ship, airport, community, hospital, family etc. Imagine national COVID plan. 

I stop there, imagine county science-based published announced weekly goal reduced number COVID cases. County goals roll state goals rolls national goal. Messaging would done nationally, state local levels. 

I think goal-oriented messaging would help everyone feel part solution levels. 

Market program create sense patriotism, similar buying war bonds World War II. 

After week over, review data, meet miss goal. Review results identify problem areas. Pinpoint areas concern. set another goal. Repeat. 

Perhaps add gamification element. Consider offering rewards areas meeting goals. likely working greater good may motivate people, winning something may. may cheaper offering COVID lottery winnings entice people wear masks social distance, paying horribly expensive medical care. 

If live county meets goal, every resident (over 18) gets X number entries. state meets goal, get number entries. 

Create national, accessible, honest, transparent dashboard national, state county data, goals, results, access videos national, state county leaders health professionals. 

Maybe Jan 21, 2021. accounts initial statement intentional lie based science available time. dumb. feel like stupid question I’m curious: constitutes ending first surge? Like what’s threshold? used joke, not. i'd find weird too, went private school voting location. would cancel too, even though reason haha many every 3 days... way Trump wins (if election held today) election fuckery. trying literally every possible way, there's decent chance he's going win. That's big *yikes*. volunteer life die COVID-19 

You don’t right volunteer anyone else’s life. really, no. opinion based fear. Heheheh , used finding troll biscuits, can't stop coming back begging more.  
But watch me, om nom nom nom, ate troll treats right front you.  
Is enough convince gonna start sniffing floor looking crumbs? Dementia helluva disease dnc ran oldest feeble onset dementia Americans stupid ensure trump wins DNC messed big time bet hide don’t debates he’s debate without teleprompter can’t handle can’t run country disappointed DNC running oldest guy 78 January way old clearly sick struggling read teleprompter. years ago could whiz stuff now. Everyone sees it. Need stop electing elderly. That’s profoundly absurd statement,the protests good cause &amp; unfortunate worry pandemic while. Eh, doesn’t bother any. I’d rather put piece fabric mouth nose unwittingly get someone sick worse. really don’t see big deal.  That's thing Science Public Health policy. different fields there's different parameters work. 

You wax poetic scientific method scientists, average person tolerate that. average person respects expert, one time. That's disclaimers ""This evolving situation information changes daily"" reaching public properly. see clueless scientists either lying saying one thing another knowing do. much braver Fauci actually read graphs access doomsday bunker?

We're near end second surge. Since virus airborne, mater much clean surfaces,. moment take mask eat, start shedding virus bite air. eat restaurants right now. Period. imagine sitting hands threat real killing people every day.

Of course I'm ironic. covid black brown I'm sure idiots minimizing would react. can't xenophobic racist virus, matter hard try. one cares? never comment better describes r/coronavirus one. science didn’t change. messaging changed. 

Initially lied intentionally saying masks don’t work, work doctors hospitals. shared FULL truth (that aren’t enough masks, they’re needed hospital, home-made mask better nothing likely sufficient Joe Average), wouldn’t situation BROKEN trust. 

This advancement science “the science changed”. shitty manipulation people caught lie. recent Yale study suggests true tally deaths Covid-19 could substantially higher number confirmed deaths. observe trends number deaths reported year, weekly basis. see large deviations numbers time period, call excess deaths. Looking 2020 since March, raw number excess deaths 200,000 people normal year. try understand that, COVID-19 rational likely explanation. believe COVID-19, try pinpoint year different other. would new disease kills people No, I'm sure death rate pretty accurate. real lie know one said masks work could reserve PPE healthcare workers. doubt almost 200k people died due virus. yes, many health problems already, elderly, mean deny virus caused death. But, people think okay ""cull"" weak population. would like people take care ill elderly rather kill off, that's guess... Except happened all. like scientists know masks helped stop virus spread.

They knew purposely misled public health professionals could horde mask supply. lied science ""ends justify means"" kind way. 

No wonder people trust them. willing basically sacrifice health theoretical ""greater good"" dont know one death caused lockdowns. name people got sick died covid. name lot people never locked Hey idiots, **become fucking crystal-clear**, blame fucking POTUS this. good news 
I know everyone worried second wave sounds like we’ll never get that.
YAY!!! /s Sounds like competent leadership what's needed. Ahem nobody supposed die ever? 

The people died covid exactly people might reasonably expected die soon anyways.

So many people grow farm nowadays shows. They’ve shut cities long idea nature works anymore. Cassandra Kassandra (Ancient Greek: Κασσάνδρα, pronounced [kassándra], also Κασάνδρα), (sometimes referred Alexandra),[1] priestess Apollo Greek mythology cursed utter true prophecies, never believed. modern usage name employed rhetorical device indicate someone whose accurate prophecies believed.

I've felt way life. 

I knew Iraq war would disaster. protested ass nothing happened. 

New covid would disaster least could protect family.  Can't second surge, first surge end...eh? Yeah man that’s honestly accurate description. You’re right. Thank Divide conquer always strategy. Exactly!!! Covid become politicized. politicians want admit fault play extra safe. Covid whole fucking joke. even deadly ... good job  number cases go people gather indoors comfortable. clear deadly. weak evidence reducing amount virus inhaled might lead less severe infection, (see note theory, proven) true people get sick fall/winter might sicker people summer, believe effect probably cancelled continued improvements treatment. scary article! children sick, weeks months exposed Covid recovering. healthy before, intensive care.

Sweden never lockdown. kids sick exposed people careless. know number children getting sick countries lockdown.

Seventy sick children ""statistically insignificant"". monumental tragedy parents one children.

We know recover, partially recover disabled life. 

It would better protected children getting sick first place. Wear mask.  mean, memory serves correctly, said. least am. Nobody believes bullshit lie. Dems media handlers ones turning politics. fact. Instead Trump undermined governors hard hit states ""Liberate!"" tweets. really interesting sure I'm meat industry. interest permanently living without bacon cheeseburgers. 

I mentioned meat factories that's mentioned first comment. point could shut industries temporarily survive. I'm saying meat first thing I'd cut. mentioned something CANT cut, truth is, could survive temporarily shut down. 

Obviously would take HUGE toll individuals owned companies industry whole. dont believe easy answers here, unfortunately. really come lives economy many ways. 

One thing, reason saying non essentially industries could shut essentials stayed running statistically less people exposed less spread would have. 

But, think two week shut would make difference (barring outbreak within facility) terms overall numbers. think longer shutdown brings HUGE economic consequences. Like said, easy answers unfortunately. Yeah, I'm forties. Age made dumbass Trumpie. simply able shout?

Most adults able speak quetly, guess people master skills. heard vaccines supposedly ready early November, discussion political stunt. really hope line risk management.

I want easily accessible work wonders state things bad, holidays much worse. many huge manatees? governability US limits, seems fighting pandemic well beyond them. hope Fauci doesn’t take heart. can’t worse last actor president. Comes secret ring straight Battle Creek. am. use subsidiary tracking like excess mortality instead doctored death numbers, shows extra 70k deaths Trump acknowledge.

Oops. I'm sure that's slight oversight, right? That's population several small cities. completely slept spain. even know they're spiking again! mean personally couldn’t give shit virus....just want economy tickin’ Ya country would never likely accept because, remember correctly, he’s Pelosi’s nephew  must fun young: naive ignorant real world. Good luck coming terms reality coming decade.  headlines says fine vote person. OK Yep reopening bars Florida Monday. place going hell hand basket. confuse mandates/orders leadership.

Leadership would getting state governors together getting close page.  

What got instead chaos wildly inconsistent messaging exactly place daily basis.

By measurement, response mismanaged.  Right, midwest going implode, family indication. uh, no, ""weak"". want believe reasons. 

Did know get number flu deaths year?  number confirmed (tested) flu deaths ranges 5k-15k United states. hear number like ""40,000 Americans died flu"", it, excess deaths. 

It tried true, scientifically-accepted method used many decades epidemiologists. Either lose 1000 get real president, get paid 1000... despite 4 years. Ohhh. Thanks. figured word omitted ""to"". makes sense 17k selfish assholes went football game person yesterday. NFL new low organization. Fuck Goodell. Fuck chiefs. class. would died hunger. Worse that; available evidence suggests Covid deaths actually under-reported.

AAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!! change situation, anyone email campaign let Dr Fauci know much appreciate him? _still_ ""giving"" them: literally says re-elect pay back taxes currently deferred. Yes. Myself, sister (separate instances), Food Lion cashier saw night. Openly mocked red hats wearing masks.

Rural VA cesspool. I'm sure help, least wear masks. actually people think hoax literally run around coughing spitting people think otherwise. patient another issue. ah, fat people fucking die, right? 

you horrible, horrible person. would realistically plan enforcing lockdown 330 million people? need toss Constitution window. many police would need? Thousands average people shoved prisons? Kids? Please Remote learning needs implemented better universally going work.The reality poor, troubled autistic youth left wayside. need options poor special needs. kids poor internet small spaces sitting limited conducive learning. also unfair kids living poverty expected learn graded small space currently whole household home. anticheat test sites wont work kids either. There's way even expect regular kids sit full school day computer,so reduced schedule order. Maybe setup learning center sorts without space, like library make noise tutor. wonder implement trade classes require school provided tools PE. Maybe schools give Wiis wii fit kids? healthy PE expect kids sit day. colleges opened in-person cash grabs rationalize high tuitions. Opening in-person close repeatedly even confusing students.. focused enhancing remote learning tailoring special needs maybe person trade classes. Short anecdote. Friend friend went Sturgis, thumbing nose whole way. Posting five others exploits. returned home Florida days later didn’t feel good. Tested positive. days later wife son, go tested positive. Wife sick it. five traveled also test positive. Four showed mild symptoms. know beyond direct family else tested positive return due them. course denied link saying must got local restaurant. However five went testing positive suggests high probability infected SD. /r/onebag Trump blaming number tests number cases. 

I assume he’ll flip script blame France, increased testing. I'm happy AstraZeneca that. shows professionalism restraint.

That change fact phase 3 trials 6 months.... saying they're usually lazy intentionally slow? 

What extra 9 14 years used ..... magically disappeared time?

Are planning take Russian vaccine? health skepticism comes in.

Look, I'm saying people take it... I'm saying circumstances health skepticism probably good idea. (And pressure every government, using one example). Social worker checking in. Business booming neck woods. Man, I’m getting flashbacks spring buy packages napkins TP all. using Easter-themed napkins wipe butts there. right now. I'm saying assuming havent seen light day totally possibility, supplements hopefully yard/porch decent open window could getting decent Vitamin D. agree though I've completely distant still active outside alone try get 20 min midday sun skin top every day. also don’t get people feel need go eat sit restaurant. sucks restaurants losing business, wish could go eat restaurant right now. sounds amazing relaxing get fresh hot meal didn’t cook. guess what? It’s safe right now. It’s basic science. stay home cook go get take (which still bit risky). 
I DoorDash delivery driver last three years side job. stopped May US gave coronavirus everyone started going again. weeks May got sick every coronavirus symptom except fever. got tested negative, definitely something picked DoorDash times left house since March. fine March April people serious careful staying home. would employees restaurant maybe people picking orders. it’s mad house people crowding parking lots, sidewalks, etc waiting outdoor table. Hospitalisations ticking up, deaths soon follow suit. 50% Oh thank much. kind words definitely fill heart huge right now. feel like gave East coast hug. happy entertain explanation might this

An out-of-context A/V clip meant confuse typical moron American sounds like likeliest explanation. know, thing past 1,000 times. culturally American, race specific. Throw youthful ignorance too. may rise, may not. Business returning normal slowly since April, deaths trending overall down, apart bumps. could go wrong...  Oklahoma, died two weeks positive test, listed recovered. reading nature viruses recently makes wonder they're even avoidable. Argentine ship infected COVID-19 sea month point - get near land, somehow outbreak started sudden. report Arctic (or Antarctic, forget) explorers getting respiratory virus away civilisation weeks too.

I wonder we're kidding lockdowns. knows long virus stay dormant, waiting right seasonal conditions gearing action. Someone either US Europe old blood test Dec 2019 re-tested COVID earlier year tested positive... circulating long, start going crazy March - seasonality  one claiming adjust one needs provide data. awww sorry dr. ~~idiot~~ bitchass Excess mortality go roof near future then. Ahh, there’s flaw. Republican viewpoint individual decide themselves, there’s even onus federal strategy (when formed Republican) provide unbiased information rather downplaying it, individuals make informed decision? It’s impossible accept risks come along actions aren’t made aware risks?

It’s inconsistency view political strategy rather pandemic strategy. wanting mandate mask use political? have, could have, would have, matter. level hubris caused lose Donald Fucking Trump, know Hillary ride die numbers. trump finally starts listening Fauci gonna drop speech runs numbers again?  Expelled college would excellent start. I’m sure understand meaning word selfish. 

I’m calling schools businesses reopen — neither child business owner recognize harm causing. Exactly. do, live area half population still thinks bs yet numbers insanely high. live right next hospital seen hundreds cases also know peeps lost grandma grandpa last 6 months due virus. 

Also lost buddy used stream us Brazil, virus hoax, let anyone brainwash thoughts. think become therapist? makes kind sad ;-) US steaming pile shit, say citizen. Everything dumpster fire frankly tired. It’s largest tri-state area nation OK. also area horrific Covid cases March OK. People dying streets, bodies stored refrigerated trucks, hospital ship sent directly president.

Yes, greater Memphis tri-state area. guessed correctly! Maybe stop testing. going positives test. simple tests highly inaccurate. Can't second surge never leave first one

EddieMurphyHeadTap.gif Yeah, even strict national lockdown, see us getting vaccine comes out. hard enough trace dozen cases, see could get 40,000 new cases per day anything close zero. One countries like others... yikes system states could get together work together single umbrella......../S trust Fauci. absolutely trust CDC. wont get vaccine based approval. wait till EU approves getting one. conspiracy theory government leader 

I wanna know ""the government leader"" means first. advocate single payer last 20 years. I've met resistance corporate Dems Republican. So, personally axe grind Democratic party whole. see trash beyond help.

But, case, totally right. dems, even ones generally hate, pushing aid money since like May. held Republican senate. saw lot people start Engineering course. even then, warned good chunk people switch something else within year two, first couple classes, Fluids, Dynamics, Controls (Power)... way weeding people can’t quite cut course. It’s really measure intelligence gets them. It’s workload required keep up. Hours week required homework hours top needed prepping tests. personal experience courses seeing enough people drop out, get educated sense takes survive end. never told guy directly, shared friend didn’t think he’d last long, like majority people try course first. people, thought would fine class, either struggled lot, eventually finished, tried something is. know one guy somehow jumped Engineering Psychology. 

I run savvy Business people campus. people course came white collar equivalent people going school Physical Therapy. people knew course wanted simple job like Bank Teller Accountant. weren’t looking start business control hedge funds. 

One Statistics courses mix Engineering Business courses. class extremely simple. Every test required memorizing 4 5 equations. Equations that, glance, would beneficial anyone Business.

You 'just world' view human actors decision-making. 

Irrational decisions abound throughout crisis. think pretty clear adjustment bunker mentality March early April healthy. people partying bars? Deciding wear masks? much. Winter means holidays means people traveling around see family. people travel far visit family summer, usually. mostly holidays. I'm liberal. need stay smart base laugh giant signature. think cool signature bold view sign strength.

Incredible. replies low energy actually realm Bose-Einstein condensates. least make fairly minimal effort learn different word. ghetto? someone explain means, call ghetto. There, hope learned something today. realize we'd additional hundreds thousands deaths good number us fighting tooth nail get control, yeah? United States alone.

If everyone knuckle-dragging imbecile like yourself, we'd fucked. Even ""hey, close one million deaths bad"" standards. We're 28 million *reported* cases that's **with** quarantines, lockdowns, facemask mandates forth. 

""enjoy living holes""? hope hell vote reproduce. literally like that. Half country didn’t even vote. got 24% population vote him. Far half. need convince 50% didn’t vote voting matters, really research options. death rate u.s. still 3% today. you’re going try get view across, need lie it? Yeah disagreed Fauci masks March /Reddit triggered    know I'm one random Internet stranger really wearing me. husband tried diligent, going necessities. daughter turned 1 summer. Since mess started taken either grandparents' home. One RT definitely deals Covid patients, one MAGA anti-masker works environment anti-maskers MAGA crowd customers (gun store). 

My mom begging bring granddaughter over. asked birthday next month. tears heart time tell no, hate breaking mom's heart. I'm worried long term damage relationship, said day ""My granddaughter lived half life without able visit her"". sent ""I miss you, please come over"" card.

We've done outside socially distanced visits. We've done video calls. we're point least one grandmother mentally taking hard safe hold granddaughter right now.

Thanksgiving Christmas going hard. tell me. follow, much second last week adjust week? I’m little confused this. Cases clearly trending US, mean surge understanding about, ""NY error showed excess deaths werent any?"" Didn’t think angle. Thanks idea worries responsible virus travel plan make damn sure person get sick me. I’m right MT border Canada actually pretty viable doubt that, though, window opportunity kind passed summer. I’m also worried getting caught airport along way become infected tested positive mandatory testing checkpoints, want able say I’m Irish citizen, American citizen, don’t get sent back here. don’t want somehow stuck ireland without citizenship. Like... world? Or... think Chinese study similar results. great, Derek really way words really brought forward sociopathic tendencies lot people. I'm bit sociopath myself, apparently I'm like Mother Teresa compared lot people there. amount times I've seen heard people talking matter old people die fucking crazy. So? saying Fake News, Donald? looked posted. estimated 14% Singapore 15% Hong Kong You’re obviously f***ing idiot sure - don’t want virus. lot presidents supporters believed tried play bad. get know whether severe moderate case. can’t say anything impress change mind. Good Luck whatever choose. guess. downvote want 🤦‍♂️ think bigger issues insanely corrupt Prime Minister, far-right politics, fact they're surrounded enemies.

Being small also means living expenses obscene, especially Tel Aviv Jerusalem. Washington Post owned wealthiest man history world. Let fix statement. date worked well enough.  Huh.

It can't Covid, right? Otherwise LA would've collapsed (at least hospitals)...? obviously would've spread throughout country world point too, since contagious...?

I really really hope prove somehow. covid, logic dictates nearly dangerous we're told, right? would fuck actually generally doesn’t depend day, it’s news source choose clip quotes. 

If listen entire interviews, they’re pretty even measured tone. happens understand technicalities saying. time, that's like saying someone dying heart attack died blood stopped flowing veins causing loss oxygen vital organs. Technically true, cause.  obviously f***ing a**h*** sleep night?   think knew China early January.

Yeah bar owners yelling reopen wait train crashed anything.

Lots denial magic ""reopen economy!!1"" plans nothing behind them. think appreciate American standard living all. elementary school saw it. thought ""why shitty action movie right now?"" ""Oh."" seeing news channel. much reaction, know react.  Colorado wear masks, socially distance, gyms open months, restaurants limited capacity flattened curve. Also specified “not hanging around vulnerable groups” please read whole 3 line statement give thoughts. Doping? Title gore Hey, shit white people culture! Yoooo stop can't lose job fuuuuck Save teachers! heartbreaking one many 💚 I’m boat need work maintain. blessing curse guess. boating community hasn’t great masks distancing either tbh Great explanation. Thank you! mean What's clever it? I've read multiple times can't think way assume means got school. even not, certainly possible teacher (or anyone, really) get virus outside school transmit someone *in* school.

So I'm sure point is....  hope sarcasm...and please show us peer-reviewed studies support assertion breathe easier. will, unfortunately. Arizona, death rates lagged case numbers three weeks month. It’s already exhausted state. Folks got three weeks $300, people qualified. it’s gone. make well, well six figures...should mad that? 100 years? give another 25 years. destroy Israel within. IDF full fundies defending country Torah. Never been. economy reopened go Chipotle  Okay zoomer Sounds like need close indoor dining. known long time, despite denial. think over, you? still gotta get winter. I’m noticing well. negative post comment downvoted oblivion. want encourage this, travel Canada Mexico quite easily, country looks came from, citizenship is. opens lot places, including (I believe) Ireland, maybe?

Thank much. mind ever questions mind ask them? $30 day? kind incentive that?

I need $300 day. Circumstantial evid3nce seems suggest wild early October November. 

December earliest confirmed detection. Going back fact, China able detect suspicious new infection far back October/Nov period.

Some Euro countries traced back waste water time period.

Oddly, American intelligence agencies knew far back October, even China could back trace. 

So October early guess.

Realistically already wild then, likely spreading slowly. required super spreader event seemed found businessmen started going back forth China Europe, business men started taking back forth Europe Americas.

For example, Italy, France, UK traced back business men super spreaders travelling work vacation.

We also consider seems 2 major strains; China strain European strain. China strain largely one infecting Europe North America. infectious, deadlier European strain. China strain seems mostly contained China Asia, though Asia detecting cases Euro strain travelling Asia. China Vietnam detect limited European strain infections country.

If Europe North America continue fail containing virus, likely see European strain spreading throughout rest world. grandma teacher South Carolina. scares hearing things like dollars CSUs.

That's thing-- advice good majority people need save money.

Insulate attic cash: good advice. Insulate walls: no, that's applicable people waste money most.

Seal house: good advice, might cost $20 caulk. Run space heater instead furnace: no, dear god no. Here's better piece advice, use programmable smart thermostat furnace running unnecessarily. 

How much produce actually get indoor garden? evaluated price saved produce vs. startup cost space buckets? can't see equation possibly working out, let alone getting enough food make impact. need *huge* garden *outdoors* actually live veggies-- like hundreds square feet per person. Absolutely, accepted tuition. 100% right. However 99% online ask students one day every week no. Renting apartment paying utilities internet mandatory one day every two weeks problem, tuition. issue forcing students live campus one day every two weeks ontop paying tuition could easily online.

&amp;#x200B;

Gladly pay tuition dicking around one person class every two weeks requires students campus that's ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

Tuition fine, forced life campus one class every two weeks racket. Even American revolution leaders upper class. Overwhelmingly farmers getting supported British didn’t give fuck. aren’t US Bangladesh average densely populated India. Pakistan, although less densely populated average, similar population density urban areas. Even drastically higher rate increase cases spain compared march/april, deaths still 1/12th back then. seems dramatically smaller, slower outbreak back then, testing comprehensive everybody knows symptoms now. wearing masks?
I thought chances catching super low kept mask on. lot people upset, actually support ANNOUNCING EARLY. CSU essentially first major school announce online plans fall midst many schools planning person, look turned out. may charging full tuition, don’t agree with, letting students know long before, could make alternative plans (gap semester/year, internship, work, etc.), get sent home two weeks refund. reddit users US.

No, shiny star. one simple sentence defending view that's attack upon me. got $5 says can't form one single cogent argument. India cases/million: 3,298

US cases/million: 19,881 fearless leader said vaccine elections?! ""It's going ~~be easy~~ happen"" number deaths could get delusional members cult Trump.  immoral, selfish, willfully ignorant, cruel, hate filled monsters. never forget unleashed upon nation. never forgive them. this. People hard enough time comprehending science go straight line, Also navigate daily MSM interpretation adds another layer it. Less land area, means less room development, means less housing options. high demand, limited supply raises costs. United States also passed Italy deaths per million today -- according worldinfometers numbers. think important note partially due better testing start epidemic. Whereas probably getting like 1-5% total cases back march/april, likely getting much larger portion. 

France seen hospitalizations rise... barely. 10% rise since june. Currently 500 people hospitalized compared *9,000* april. nobody left first wave exception couple island countries Nunavut way Northern Canada India also hit 96k new cases first time today. Yeah work restaurant, one even attempts put mask walk table. Also people waltz whole restaurant mask less go bathroom. We’ve given trying get customers put masks on, it’s worth fight 2.13 hour. bunch examples passengers fight flight? current CDC pandemic planning packet. updated longer see overall Infection Fatality Ratio. provide Infection Fatality Ratios age bands. However, cite source perhaps paper lists overall ratio. 

Multiple IFR 100 get percentage. It’s prolly TOS India blame? nearly 100k cases today. 38k. great sole source statistic. think soldiers died part propoganda border skirmish? clean dinner table nice, magically filtering air supply.

Maybe cleaning table makes room cooties settle table, therefore less floating around air? 

/s, obviously mean bathtoom schedule uv light between? Maybe carpooled together? drove themselves? walked? read diet lot it. Lots fermented foods like sauerkraut, loaded Vitamin C. Makes sense since South Korea lightly affected eats lot kimchi. Singapore huge outbreak dorms migrant workers. quite young. fully expect slew tweets friends students. cannot silence internet. Morons Florida, US: Hold beer Little nuanced that, ok! definitely negative coping mechanism many people. I've also seen fit healthy people become obese sports injuries unrelated medical conditions. Life gray thing. didn’t say that. need measured way keep rate transmission well 1. Lift, measure. approximately 10x higher 9/10 asymptomatic. Rather mild cases people probably thought bad cold flu. said death rate, infection rate. People like play ignorant eating 3 bigmacs week travis scott fortnite burger favors.

Let planes Brazil land disembark without screening please... seems obvious me. senior high school. response ""oh fuck going war gonna first fuckers ask go."" 

Scary different way. ""This worst day life""

""The worst day life, *so far.*"" can’t cuz that’s kind cringe reaction ngl 😬 mean US still far less likely anyone know. India way control coronavirus well, much cases India must cases dont even go reported  many coronaviruses there? 

Because article seems address small studies coronaviruses - specifically cold-causing coronaviruses, even limiting. Doesn’t seem sufficient support big claim. really hate stuff reported. 211 deaths, 175 actually occurred August July. Florida reported 211 deaths today (more catch-up 3-day weekend). Changes reported 50 different dates, going back July 6. 35 July, 140 August. Peaks 7/23 7/30 (205), 7-day moving avg peak 7/25 (196). That’s privileged live life ignore systemic issues plaguing country. people don’t house, cat, wife, family, food return to, many people country destitute ignored. say people? “Be glad
It’s Black Plague!”? buddy works school. set camera. deep clean. even hit high touch surfaces.  I'm 43 years old published microbiologist.

I actually graduated UGA 6 years ago college took macro micro economics (two separate courses took semester). make expert, decent lay understanding economics 

I've worked variety different jobs owned small business supported us school.

I read lots primary literature covid19 virus SARS-CoV-2. think USA supports people lost jobs?

I understand plenty states didn't, federal government initially try political failure take action mean wealth pay truth lockdown quarantine hurt people saved.

I would happily read whatever primary peer reviewed literature basing certitude on. everything books it, horrible cough, body aches, fever, chills. waving white flag virus? encourage TFG's vote. claiming that. claiming CDC weight incomplete data. Sometimes adjusts down. NY adjusted last week numbers still reported locally though. Here's Californias: here's county level data: plot google, using data, showing we're past hump: removed super dick edit containing accusations downvoting. Wow shitty summer it’s going get worse gets colder, vaccines get distributed hopefully save asses. Maybe next summer redeem 1967 style. Trump hid presence severity pandemic American people 21/2 months earliest critical time, resulting tens thousands deaths. don’t think state rep that. thing death admitted failed protect elderly care homes. progressive young adult, can't good conscience vote Bidens platform. I'll vote Green instead actually represent well being. vote shame anyone voting Biden abhor Trump, young vote show Biden promise that. Current positive rate 0.74% Germany. current one already? I’m taking things personally all. supporting asshole joked 9/11 saying “he biggest tower Manhattan”. Change definition quarantine ""born free"" numbers showing downward trend overall (thoigh rising states).

If want believe numbers complete lies point discussing you. Yikes, journalist comparing Sweden Belarus really stupid. also buy HEPA filter paper.  morbidly obese spend significantly time indoors. higher exposure risk they’re less likely function independently well. Try telling 600lb man lymphedema get groceries. 350lb woman haul heavy package inside. 

The regular obese restaurants bars well mild outdoor activities. scientific community supposed reach consensus. It’s dishonest act like science monolith chooses sides.

It apparently impunity disagree original post thread. Calling impunity disagree disgusting. coronavirus cases rise pretty much European countries, leading fears second wave including UK, sinking summer Sweden. per capita basis, 90 per cent peak late June Norway’s Denmark’s first time five months. Tegnell told first time spoke spring would autumn became apparent successful country been. Jeff Goldblum Jurassic Park."
