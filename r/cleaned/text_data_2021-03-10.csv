The number people area wear masks wear correctly pretty high.

I several risk factors, asthma, high blood pressure autoimmune disorder I'm immunosuppressants. I'll take discomfort get vaccinated. think OP means supply seems longer limiting factor. enough supply everyone, *even less* appointment availability. suggests thing focus improving logistics doses administered every day. words Larry David: pretty...pretty...pretty good received first dose (Pfizer) Walgreens. stress, lines, drama. startlingly simple event monumental occurrence, know mean. little jab, beginning getting life back... tried contact doctor part large medical system unfortunately impossible get hold of. appt Monday hear back then. There‚Äôs also much don‚Äôt know right would rather bring wider forum could get broader perspectives. one doctor already told team know much right information ever evolving. mutations 300k cases per day, apparently COVID made endemic, that's we'll see it. Lol Canada Sell $COVID

$VAX $OPEN üöÄüöÄüöÄ ok drink drive people prepare it? fine put onus possible victim therefore drinking driving seen acceptable activity. point making. Answer that, think drinking driving seen fine restrictions people take responsibility protecting it? headline terrible - moron would read COVID-19 vaccine caused COVID-19.

Too many morons anyway... Good 2000 people live Alaska states? Well yeah, vulnerable people (elderly etc) would hosts anymore due dying virus - course, new people would continue become vulnerable. would expect affected populations become less vulnerable virus time - that‚Äôs something happens decades centuries, years. virus contagious enough, low enough mortality rate leave large numbers survivors, stopped meaningfully immunity, continue spreading hosts pretty much indefinitely. 

Luckily worst-case thought experiments now. COVID behaves like regular respiratory virus, good vaccines that‚Äôll put end pandemic. bring good questions. make us question effective lockdowns really see cases ebb flow.
When cases go people say, ""others following rules"". 
When cases go say, ""people locked hard see works"". 
There's proof either. closest could probably get would cellphone tracking data.

I think naive think control spread mutation virus.
Think past year, much control had. People can't even control eat yet trying control flow virus. 

That's say somethings influence virus spread, like old book says, ""a virus gonna virus"". good day - Tests: 1,437,174 - Cases: 59,641 - Deaths: 1,465 - Currently Hospitalized: 39,148 - Currently ICU: 7,881 (-104)


Source: calculus different now. thresholds written assumption vaccine coverage. vaccine coverage low hospital numbers, governor country holding line social distancing. What‚Äôs states won‚Äôt let them. States emergency end.

It‚Äôs probably didn‚Äôt green tier. Even yellow tier says ‚Äúmost indoor businesses open‚Äù. implication put business?? No, it‚Äôs assumes vaccine. Honestly, best interest well. fewer infections, less chance mutations.  one person thread surprised getting full check. us thread getting stimulus check, welcome hand up. Well dont know noticed UK one hardest hit countries world. comes need close top list. Thank God politicians good sense secure vaccine supply. country one hardest hit prepared vaccines told export vaccines helped produced paid for. dont know smoking need lay it. Could reporting issues, too. You‚Äôre making straw man. never said laws pointless. said laws never 100% followed everyone always prepared cases someone isn‚Äôt could negative effect you.

[VAERS CVS Pharmacy buy and/or partner Target Pharmacy?

Yes, buy out. Inb4 ""Uk banning exports, contract bans exports!!!"" wait downvotes. can't speak hospitals mine much higher immunization %, ones declined done would rather defer vaccine dose someone higher risk are, they've already contracted (and recovered from) COVID, like ER docs. believe it, they'd rather dose go someone could use do.

Of course, said, working healthcare make immune vaccine, least hesitant - like field. really sucks, mean also used polio idk anything records dont know guess we'll see. anyone 60 already pretty much 65+. Quite likely boosters used high risk populations. Otherwise drs would nothing vaccinating people year round Essential workers deserve shot. kept things going, risking every day. earned it. Ok. great US education? Ew, Dunning-Kreuger action. come. gotta hold little longer. There's *that* much supply yet. weeks though? Absolutely. Many states already saying they'll enough doses hand end next month vaccinate anyone wants it, leaving logistics getting shots arms biggest limiting factor. Lol Canada never understand ‚Äúback normal‚Äù dial, dimmer, faucet, whatever want call getting turned. It‚Äôs nobody announced big fanfare. Maryland's 1c phase, people trenches working essential businesses: grocery store employees, food workers, manufacturing, postal workers. people working day out, serving privileged enough work home stay isolated. 

People like us deserve shot vaccine. Lol Canada Yeah, EU also provided lots funds get vaccines banning exports. EU point here. really. border issue right same. Whenever there's republican office, democrats suddenly start think national borders protecting thing hate crime. Democrat office remember ""oh right, that's reality"".

Same shit Republicans. Whenever there's Democrat office pretend like national debt radioactive must gotten rid of. republican office they're like ""wait, dumb lol nvm"" 

It's tiresome. Per capita, ballpark. countries fine. wouldn‚Äôt worry this. risks associated everything- either risk rare side effects mild vaccine risk complications covid. friend actually got blood clots covid, far risks associated getting covid compared already proven safe vaccine. potential (very rare) complications vaccine. family getting I‚Äôm getting myself. would like explain *why* they're wrong? think take care risk groups start sharing everyone. Even fraction weekly distribution make difference. buy last item shelf, ban product instituted shop?

Haha sure showed me, yep UK isnt vaccine powerhouse thanks proving point. vaccine output domestically tiny, EU wanted global hub vaccine production congrats them. Maryland sucks vaccine rollout. Impossible get appointment somehow qualify yet drs offering spot vaccines random people street, like fuck people following stupid rules need apparently wait near jab location. not? spent years looking like morons Trump charge; think owe world bit generosity make it. CVS Pharmacy buy and/or partner Target Pharmacy? Pharmacy departments Target around CVS. mainly OP completely wrong think worst now. headache felt like crap like 36 hours, it‚Äôs good! Oh yea, I‚Äôve seen plenty news articles it. I‚Äôm KC ‚Äúregion‚Äù received 3% less vaccines population it. shorted 40k doses according health director. take account rural areas less likely take vaccine, getting extra boned can‚Äôt fill appointments. would exported too?

Lots countries need brother, lots lots. EU bit exporting vaccines world. Maybe Britain rather sniping sidelines. Canada massive population either. Good Cost/Benefit. innacurate. Online schools joke many students excited visiting beach Spring Break next week.... lovely. jab rate good April run people willing accept vax. Biden declare herd immunity victory soon after. Exactly, EU could paid AZ spin new vaccine factory UK export Europe didn't, verify read report UK spent 7 times per capita EU Vaccine Infrastructure supply chains. people already 'what mutations? stay closed 2022 earliest?' bandwagon, even vaccinating schoolkids likely make group happy. so? asked soda rude I‚Äôm really tired seeing bit misinformation media comes measures really matter ‚Äî hospitalizations death ‚Äî functionally same.

Hospitalizations deaths thing matter? Tell people suffering long Covid, many never got sick enough even go hospital hardly work energy take shower make lunch, chronic chest joint pain, can‚Äôt think straight brain fog. might well close every city government office Still lot. Like 20 airplanes. Imagine 20 planes going year. wouldn‚Äôt fly anymore. got Moderna shot morning. Felt tingling arm 10 minutes, symptoms since. That‚Äôs true. don‚Äôt supply issues Pfizer. delivering per contracted production supplies. yet Pfizer exports make significant portion vaccines EU exported. reason issues something else entirely. Go chat Ursula. knows why. Lol Canadian inferiority complex That‚Äôs incredibly unlikely though, that‚Äôs get downvoted. Also, it‚Äôs stupid fucking reason keep restrictions place. I‚Äôm seeing 7153 Wouldnt 10s millions deaths mean virus would lose hosts find quickly though? I'd say CDC, gutted Trump administration.  Trump White House realized bad screwed up, plan became money problem shift much possible onto states. could play games blaming different governors states general things failed. Sure duck behind legal work. say contract breaking laws. I'm sure that's fine. 

I described fair play would work. maybe I'm naive thinking countries help other. try block exports, law contract.

If quick search VAERS find shocking trends symptoms deaths caused vaccine.

Anyone getting vaccine EUA getting vaccine proven. seeing short term effects absolutely way know long term effects be. Inform yourselves. VAERS public database full great information make informed decision. 

This comment fact based brings value topic. rules sub reviewed making post. saw something smaller thread 

[Scotland Level 0 (least restrictive) Even weren‚Äôt official trials, millions people 80 already vaccinated across world.  guess pointless, huh?

Laws immeasurable improvements society human race. backbone society. 

I can't even begin deal amounts stupidity statement made. kindergarten debate shit pulled ass. difference virus, need even become seriously ill admitted hospital see long-term damage lungs. would exported, would exported too? seem trouble concept buying something. see buy pay something expect get pay for. difficult concept grasp. course would want vaccinate military.

The military supposed healthiest people. Shouldn‚Äôt vaccinate people health conditions them?  know, I'm old mom. Honestly, consult trusted doctor take his/her advice. Truly. Call Dr.'s office ask. That's I'd tell son daughter do. Take doctor's advice, YES. many millions taken vaccine safely (including myself) risk getting vaccine getting except certain specific health conditions. doctor tells one those, rest us got this, WE'LL get vaccinated protect you! - NY 7153 new cases yesterday (Mar 9) according Rate new case decline -3% according state CT soooo much better states. I'm lockdown skeptic give credit credit due.

They worked summer get schools open, showdown teachers unions, put work got done. Sure many schools days week, students going days every day. 

We panic lock everything winter either, hospitals run business forced close. 

The vaccine rollout simple fast, end sight restrictions set loosen significantly. better place planet arguable I've sick lot life , Lyme mysterious GI illness picked Turkey. still bad cough Covid infection July. I've never long term sequaelae infection. please no! EU also put lots fundings develop vaccines :( OK certainly think go-to vaccine every local grocery store pharmacy doctor's office, especially month road. I‚Äôm guessing reason . much demand enough supply scariest possibility would one vaccine possible, antibodies/immunity general lasted &lt;3 months, reinfection carried higher chance serious illness. 

At certain points last year, still pretty dark virus, three things floating around possibilities. true, would basically cycle either recurring lockdowns restrictions, tens millions deaths per year. wouldn‚Äôt solution managed find manner highly effective treatment. tech think Russians best. use two separate vectors, one shot, avoid immunity vector itself. may explain significantly effective AZ shot. individual prerogative, wish well. Taking away other's individual's choices get frustrated. laws ever stopped someone something illegal really desired said illegal thing?

Of course laws drunk driving it‚Äôs deterrent everyone. hit road, aware fact everyone won‚Äôt following rules. Surely mean unpresidented Israel already transferred vaccines there, West bank vaccinating 100,000 Palestinians. We'll vaccinate even time. correct. plan get purchased dumped states figure out. got would dumb luck solid plan strategy. way Biden allowing borders open, I‚Äôm sure won‚Äôt much surplus donate üôÑ Pro tip - get vaccinated every day live forever.

Nah right. eating disorder projecting lately ‚úåÔ∏è  surprises, Chinese Russian governments reportedly cut lot corners testing. would skeptical, too. really needed news!?

I'm sure talking Pfizer taking federal money. research development they're sure taking right now. PERIODT. Yeah gave us 15 million J&amp;J May would basically done getting life stealing slice pizza?

Or kind don‚Äôt like three strikes legislation. Like you‚Äôve done time armed robbery, you‚Äôve done time aggravated sexual assault stole something. saying? mean? USA produces Astra Zeneca vaccine, US also purchased lot of, still FDA approval least april seems. right vaccine doses literally sit there.

Getting world vaccinated protects US, too. means fewer reservoirs coronavirus new variants develop. means travel returning normal. means less chance virus reestablishing US. also gives us major brownie points international stage cheap (so-called ""vaccine diplomacy"", Russia China current engaging in). Unfortunately, bad domestic politics probably happen. Exactly. Canada used domestic vaccine production previous governments eliminated it.

You're completely wrong. Canada domestic vaccine production. large vaccine plants Toronto (Sanofi) Quebec City (GlaxoSmithKline)

All H1N1 vaccine produced domestically 2009, production facilities expanded since fulfill seasonal flu vaccine needs.

Also, we've flu pandemic preparedness contracts vaccine facilities (including export ban federal government paid hundreds millions dollars companies since last global pandemic ensure steady supply vaccinations next outbreak, though apply current COVID-19 contract signed ID Biomedical 2001 obliged government pay company ‚Äúpandemic readiness fee‚Äù ensured would fill Canada‚Äôs vaccine quota supplying purchasers, Senate committee‚Äôs report federal government awarded GlaxoSmithKline renewed version contract 2011 $430 million.

Keep digging hole, buddy.  Lol

So Trump cared much vaccine leave info regarding transition team?

If really cared it, millions doses unaccounted for?

If really cared it, experts say federal coordination vaccine distribution making process incredibly hard execute beginning?

Stop it. 

Trump practically non functional corona virus plan. experts agree assessment. THat's 500,000 deaths. still carry virus within nasal cavity spread unvaccinated people via respiratory droplets. asked ‚Äúpoint vaccine‚Äù, that‚Äôs extremely simple: everyone vaccinated, (pretty much) nobody risk. 

So yes still carry active COVID-19 viruses mouth nose immunization and, time being, remove mask talking immunized people. Vacciation? Vaccation? Vacation? Oh! Vacation! Yeah, good, good. Thanks. Shhhh! latest strongbad email came last week. must using ‚Äònew math‚Äô I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre teaching now. think need tune up.  Pretty much.

Wow...  slightest, track 100 million doses August. orders 200 million doses total Biden took office.

Both Pfizer Moderna even stated offered 200 million doses additional, trump refused entirely. sure getting 1/2 paychecks from

That unemployment works pretty much every state. get 1/2 normally make (up certain point, point starving). top government gave $600, $400, $300 bonus per week. Let's say making $500 week. unemployment plans would get $250 plus government bonus actually paying making (even first $10k tax free).  healthcare, able apply discounted healthcare even medicaid affordable care act. would actually making pretty good wage take kind major financial hit. talking people making average US Also, half workforce lives Mexico commutes work.

Are Mexican nationals? issue Mexico sure shit would favor risking American lives order make sure Mexicans job. Americans either dual citizens somehow expats commuting across border (I would idea would work never seen worked quite time near Canadian border), again, made choices live place fewer social safety nets chose employ them. Even even sure would work since work California means pay unemployment state would bet would think quite right say minimal harm.

Well dying, kicked homes, given fair amount money, provided healthcare free reasonable rate. mean cruel here, seem informed available employees. seem think furloughing would sort death sentence fact pretty big social safety nets got much bigger pandemic point many made money working. ones Mexico know whole situation there. would need know more. seems case now. Walmart started offering appointments vaccines state (Oregon) today, locations apparently offering J&amp;J. mom's appointment specifically says they'll using J&amp;J.

Pfizer/Moderna great mass vaccination sites, J&amp;J what's going get vaccines neighborhood locations. Time vaccine diplomacy counter Chinese (and Russian) efforts.

First up? Canada Mexico. Let's secure North America summer's end.

After that? year's end, let's immunize Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and... Taiwan. Along vaccine stuff, Target dope. worked 6 years. Work DC, make legit living wage, work around school, good benefits...bonuses hourly workers. Unskilled laborers high school start 20.50 Votes. :/ Pfizer, per many statements, take money, first reach it.

Also, Bill Gates poured huge sum money development vaccine.

Trump failed set form logistical system administration vaccine, resulting states waste storage even notified way.

Congress authorized huge amount money goverment spent it, trump actually attempted redirect wall stopped courts.

Basically, give trump credit others keeping shitting walls already shit bed floor. know saying, please edit comment spell correctly. Kind self-own :-) wrong... Please give us Mexicans. president crackpot believes prayers heal COVID. grandparents 70 80 haven‚Äôt received shit. punched arm amirite?

Im looking vaccinating coming empty. info you. looks like wait. too. I‚Äôm AP live 40 minutes away. parks packed. They‚Äôre taking seriously anymore.

I expect go back normal time anniversary festivities start. Jason: Hold beer, Ken getting downvoted regularly see people posting exact thing, trying convince people masks work. I'm glad posted wanted explanation too. sense?

P value greater 0.05 means effect observed.Aug 10, 2016
Its looking percentages true statement mask wearing reduces transmission US typically requires trials performed specifically US. accept market's acceptable mark safe.

So primary reason makers Sputnik V trial submit review FDA. US hoarding vaccine.  Hmmm... one person dying vaccine, 500k+ dying COVID. know choice I'd make.

(There always people adverse reactions - perhaps even fatal ones - vaccines. number always, far, *far* lower number people whose lives saved taking vaccines. let anti-vaxxers use stories like try sell 'dangers' vaccines.)

Thanks finding source people think making unsubstantiated claims.  matter school 100 cases causes severe cases, deaths?

I think fear COVID got bit ingrained us, vaccines there's little risk. People slowly realize that. so, kids school get infected large numbers, means couple weeks large numbers kids get immunity. even risk averse could send kids in.

Just like many hesitant getting vaccine first (polls Israel showed 30% population willing get right away, 50% willing get all, 86% adult population least 1 shot...). follow restriction, situation improve large numbers get fully vaccinated, people see safe fear factor subside.

In states seems logical choice ensure land neighbours doses. guess means helping mexico out. me, doses would go poorer nations, necessarily local ones. They'd easily enough fully vaccinate whole islands Pacific example plus give load African nations, perhaps Brazil seeing large population. fantastic whatever US choses they'll able start donating doses fairly soon given fast rollout false. EU monitoring vaccine exports able block vaccine producers export vaccines fulfilling contractual obligations EU. Pfizer/Biontech allowed export keep contract EU. AZ horrible regard AZ allowed export example Australia. together commissioner Stella Kyriakides.

She's far worst That's great idea actually, Canadian, like fact Americans Cuba, offence. lose innocence American capitalism allowed in. Put bit grey, delightful Ask feds? US consulate encourages us vaccinated clearly states vaccines provided americans abroad (military excepted). ? amazes EU still exports vaccines. Why???

Liberalism 

EU elites brainwashed free-trade ideology, want close export even vital item Who? seen anyone deny death stats UK. glad cleared everything up. moral point view UK requires vaccines due hard weve hit. contractual pov prepared vaccine supply private companies, dont export dont manufacturing base unlike EU. Let's actually vac selves first. America mess comes virus. situation reverse country, would say ""please take care first."" 

However, May deadline met, means whole lot vaccines would start becoming available overseas export. might ramp production We've already said that's happen Ikr.

Seems like would beneficial donate medically fragile kids - Down‚Äôs syndrome kids high risk That‚Äôs even question smh Yeah Canada chose EU Trump. Sadly Biden kept ban too. 

I hate that. Canada awesome country. Hopefully get domestic production going too. Guess EU also paid millions upfront. That‚Äôs commerce works, apparently winning global pandemic works. 
I know US prioritized paid better price many us furious EU cheating vaccines (because lockdown much inexpensive, apparently). that‚Äôs point. point might round two nationalism prevailed concerted international efforts. good news right now, prices pretty reasonable. Pfizer BioNTech set initial price $19.50 dose, comes $39 per patient. Because, America back! bought total two million doses Russia's Sputnik V, according Jahanpour, delivered stages. 
He said Tehran plans launch local manufacture Russian jab start new Iranian year March 21. 
""36 40 million doses Sputnik V produced distributed"" upcoming year, quoted saying government's website. 
Iran also received 250,000 doses China's Sinopharm vaccine February 28, Jahanpour announced donated Chinese government. saw (or have) 30 million doses AZ time approved use here. 

No idea many moment. idea approved heard April possibility Iran received shipment 150,000 doses Indian Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, local media reported Thursday, Islamic republic combats Middle East's deadliest outbreak illness. Curious said Taiwan. mean love Taiwan, don‚Äôt get wrong. No. 1 sure. U.K. paid hundreds millions upfront, specifically build U.K. production facilities. 3 months EU came arrangement them.

First came taking seriously, toilet paper surge prepared masks. still remember sometime late March going bar talking crazy things happening around us host dropped greasy pizzas table. stores became hellscapes resorted cutting old bed sheets make low quality bandanas wrap around faces.

Next came work home. wife started teaching virtually lugged home monitors docking station. first weeks fascinating became new normal fairly quickly. April October kind felt like thing. Unfortunately office extremely anti-covid fairly unsafe things decided look something new left October.

It definitely hurt seeing family members throughout this. whole lot video calls definitely hard since lot taking seriously. First winter spent alone, also first Christmas got pets get boarded small silver lining guess!

Covid definitely done number mental health conspiracies. wife massive falling brother kinda spilled mom since brother ""taking care her"" (dude borderline autism, probably way around tbh). Definitely hurts, wants talk things underground cabal microchips. crazy. 

2021 shaping pretty hopeful though! wife getting vaccine weekend! new job pays lot more! We're moving much nicer apartment next month! we're planning trip see family early May! still crazy see globally, we're already vaccinating 325 million people!

Kemp moved people underlying conditions 55+, I‚Äôm guessing Alabama goes open everyone March 25. proof vaccinated people cannot spread it/s One three vaccines used US invented Germany. US took big gamble bought shit-ton ready part expensive order asked first recipients X number doses. 

That commerce works. also, it‚Äôs beneficial shoring points vulnerability. Who‚Äôs likely come contact country people contact people country? people bordering country.

It‚Äôs smart move ethically, points. strategically. believe 1% population died COVID 0.000007% gotten blood clot vaccination.

Just get correct statistic according top 30 countries 1000 2000 death per Million would 0.1-0.2% population died covid. 

Clearly 22 chance 3 millions get blood cloth bad compared 2000 dead million. taking 2 weeks investigate reduced 2 chances 3 millions that's even better. Well fuck It‚Äôs quite possible US government simply let drug companies decide want excess vaccines, spirit capitalism, government simply step way, rather dictate doses go.

EMA Vaccine AstraZeneca: PRAC preliminary view suggests specific issue batch used Austria Share

The Austrian national competent authority suspended use batch COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (batch number ABV5300) person diagnosed multiple thrombosis (formation blood clots within blood vessels) died 10 days vaccination, another hospitalised pulmonary embolism (blockage arteries lungs) vaccinated. latter recovering. 9 March 2021, two reports thromboembolic event cases received batch.

There currently indication vaccination caused conditions, listed side effects vaccine.

Batch ABV5300 delivered 17 EU countries1 comprises 1 million doses vaccine. EU countries2 also subsequently suspended batch precautionary measure, full investigation ongoing. Although quality defect considered unlikely stage, batch quality investigated.

EMA‚Äôs safety committee PRAC reviewing issue; investigating cases reported batch well cases thromboembolic events, conditions related blood clots, reported post-vaccination. information available far indicates number thromboembolic events vaccinated people higher seen general population. 9 March 2021, 22 cases thromboembolic events reported among 3 million people vaccinated COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca European Economic Area.

If Moderna Pfizer either started start safety trial booster shot, point bake South Africa Brazil currently available vaccines?

No politician point going wait booster every time open back up, making conversation bit moot begin with, nevertheless months would take get data, highly doubt government going demand it. 

Given vaccines better performance J&amp;J across board, imagine they‚Äôre thinking they‚Äôre safe assuming it‚Äôll perform better J&amp;J real life efficacy, can‚Äôt blame them. forget smallpox Absolutely.

I‚Äôm America First believe soon we‚Äôre vaccinated help countries. isn‚Äôt zero-sum game here, everybody benefits, us included, help them.

God damn thats big boy update today.

1.62 million first doses! Thats increase 440k last Thursday.

Our 7 day rolling average first doses 1.370 million day. 

If pace holds (no reason think wont still increase)

End March: 94 million first doses done

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Makes sense. Like said, expect president do. Pfizer job, surprise they're heavily funded German government. 

Pfizer heavily funded German government? Since when? Lol telling chill angry ranting lunatic conversation. 

""Calmer'n are"" - Walter Sobchak executive order banned local municipalities enacting local mandates.

They effectively banned government telling people businesses need wear mask.

They tell businesses they're allowed enforce mask requirements, tell people they're allowed wear masks.

People act like state Texas authoritarian letting local municipalities tell others do. Local preemption restrictions thing sorts laws, generally viewed authoritarian. EVERY Country - except maybe Tanzania denies Covid's existence - going get vaccine eventually. 

The fact many vaccines work producing many good news, light end tunnel. doubt see send good vibes way today, stay strong friend! Lift mask mandate put trust people hands spread among themselves. Suggest mask sick mind, force it. there's still end sight. effective vaccines. matter when, if. simple. Yup thats 2 weeks vaccine full strength mask coming travel starting

State world obviously stressful someone I've less depressed year usual. miss everyone can't see maybe able express openly beneficial me. ..Ya, way change that, like reschedule 2nd dose. maybe there‚Äôs story here...

There is. Lots.

Twelve months ago UK vaccine production capability. Government worried production outside country could end getting vaccines due export bans implemented elsewhere.

As part agreement Astrazeneca UK Government paid production facilities setup UK purchased first 100m doses made there. around April last year took long time get dialed producing properly. 40m doses originally estimated ready end 2020 fraction able made. lower number due initial problems getting lines setup.

The EU signed deal Astrazeneca August last year following paid production facilities setup produce Belgium believe doses made specifically use EU. done much later UK problems Belgium plant setup later hadnt time iron time start producing needed. EC thought doses sent Belgium plant UK raided found happening problems due low yield.

There fill finish done Netherlands early UK vaccine manufactured UK shipped there. EU shipped AZ vaccines produced UK Pfizer ones ship over. 

This summary lots around this. UK accused ban exports isnt true. law restricts exports vaccines (or components) UK initial doses produced factories purchased UK government. EU hand implemented laws used restrict exports Italy recently. 

The EU later setting AZ production experiencing problems this. also want hear another US politician talking world looks US leadership. I'd prefer isolationist US. Sick government spending money effort foreign priorities.

Isolationism view right wing US anymore. think last administration started something continue. mean, said punish really isn‚Äôt punishment. health reasons quarantine pushes incentive get vaccinated. know mean? 2 million global COVID deaths year good goalpoast achieve IMO. Im qualified get Im literally waiting appointment show every day. Give fricken vaccine already, tired dealing covidiots reminding people wear fricken masks. People commute car. live Chicago regularly would stop local coffee shop getting train taking bus. job, surprise they're heavily funded German government. AZ not, underperform.

Research funded Germany (bioNtech), Pfizer making profit. vaccine subsidised.  That's still normal matter much twist it. vaccines fuck wearing masks even flu season :) sorry! honest, really think going well. Once, variety lot transmissible lot less deadly I'm 20s without preexisting conditions. interact anyone high risk regular basis. time I'm eligible, people higher risk already eligible awhile. 

Also, rest world whatever want already. I'm mitigating risk point one else anything mitigate mine. Cdc recommends bad 25% 18+ huge! Interesting. feel like might people company like seemingly neverending WFH, overwhelming majority prefer problem it. UNDERSTAND ANYONE WOULD EVEN GIVE RATS ASS VIRUS KILLED 3.5 BILLION PEOPLE.

So... universal healthcare, kept health problems population like cancer HIV minimum, even outright prevented cases, worry much dangerous mutations viruses might get around vaccines? Check.

So Bernie's right again. 1,440th time. blood clots common effect Covid 

I talking family member works epidemiology, mentioned similar cases, Pfizer vaccine instead. said they're internally speculating could spike protein that's causing (or obviously random chance), since that's Pfizer vaccine common Astra-zeneca's. Lol, like going work. want tourism back, scrap quarantine nonsense accept tourism industry dead. Got second shot today. leave work feeling dizzy lightheaded/panicky. felt like shit day first one too. Still 100% worth though! Still, hearing time doesn‚Äôt help mental health. lords like emporer would gone... punishment incentive.

An incentive would offer reward desired behavior, punishing someone it. That's coercion another form force.

Early data shows might well variants. talking full stadiums, I'm sure anyone definitively answer that. expect pretty much every baseball football stadium limited fans minimum, opposed stadiums empty limited family. Even Buffalo allowed something like 20,000 fans home playoff game NY pretty restrictive.

All all, tremendous loss life knows preventable could been. unprecedented hope god pandemic need go life. I‚Äôm actually opinion timeline general population wouldn‚Äôt overly long. One regiments Moderna testing whether third dose existing formulation restore efficacy B.135. that‚Äôs case implementation wide scale would easy; there‚Äôd surplus vaccines point would involve signing get another dose 

If involves altered formulation (which personally believe likely outcome) would longer huge amount. Likely new vaccine would given booster could still continue vaccinating people existing supply, unlike ramp manufacturing like vaccines first approved manufacturing network already place, would matter switching producing modified product. Think like way manufacture millions doses flu vaccines every year, except case initial alterations vaccine would actually minimal Yes problem statement there's way separate state-imposed lockdown voluntary behavior done order die.

For example, kids stopped going school schools closed. stayed open, many kids would still going first wave hit hard entire communities infected kids? Probably enough justify keeping building open.

Same goes restaurants football games rest. disease shut us down, government. government made official. iirc factors x amount based population amount based number first responders plus nursing homes state, tribal areas (including alaska native) got allotment, VA hospitals got allotment, military bases got own, etc states low population overall contain factors could end better proportion vaccines per person states since many segments hte population would get 100% coverage quicker (VA, tribes, active duty, first responders, etc) first dose yesterday, hit almost instantly, like maybe 5 minutes. got intense dizziness fever chills alternating lasted 3 hours.

[Here‚Äôs local story Gov. Stitt‚Äôs plan drop limited mask mandate drop state mandate Like pope? That's definitely good thinking. Obviously, can't say sure, place bet üòÇ would bet Pfizer's gonna something like 60% efficacy. Maybe 63. Let's go 63.6%. believe Merck KGaA would issue press release agreement producing Oxford vaccine 14th April. 

I still seen document showing US Merck involved. 

Merck KGaA right use name Merck outside US Canada. Optimistic too. Even Georgia opened new vaccine categories cover ton people. Close last vaccinations here, lots government decisions disagreed with. finally starting feel like beginning end. Fingers crossed. Oh yeah, definitely! hope continues pick too. vaccine rollout super fast. Herd immunity let virus spread allow natural immune response. herd immunity produced vaccines. 

And attempting insult belief/ theory. stated post disagreed suggestion providing separate living space elderly family members option many. Agreed! MLB games fans Opening Day, expect football 100% open fall. Thanks clearing up! Still, efficacy vaccine proving providing absolutely astounding (0.02% developed symptoms incredibly low). Really hoping able get shot soon! totally agree, point this:

WE got lucky. people, vaccine scientists, put hard work succeeded. guarantee though, group effort. Politicians needed prepare *likelihood* right we'd staring barrel 1-2 vaccines middling efficacy nearing approval.

Vaccines would done almost nothing roll time. fine reason it, 3 available US accomplish goal. think end month many joined. ‚ÄúFollow science‚Äù

‚ÄúBut wait, *that* science‚Äù Yeah, looks like week there‚Äôs enough give 10% Ontarians dose, next 3 weeks gonna see 1M new doses delivered Ontario. cope WSJ - First one Google:

On point agree you. mean lawsuit pandemic over.  Gotta ask sugar daddy, India. governments spreading anti-vax propaganda look bad failed procure vaccines. Texas Rangers 100% capacity opening day, masks ""required"" (how minimum wage game-day employees going enforce beyond me). guess we'll find consequences. Yes study 231 people another study undisclosed amount people showing slightly symptoms (all mild way) reason claim people need ready ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù side effects ‚Äúall war‚Äù lol gone outside pandemic besides get groceries?  HI (and maybe AK) real exception, yes. What's point enforcing testing requirement airport got hundreds thousands possible entrances state can't possibly enforce? cases. recovered Covid-19 early February. got first shot yesterday exception mild sore arm slight headache, feel great. grandfather recovered asymptomatic case issues either. Well kinda missing point. First AZ vaccine provide poorest results clinical trial (62.5% efficacy) 4 week dosing interval, correspondingly faired much worse South Africa. Janssen‚Äôs efficacy DG614 isnt bad; 72% saw drop South Africa. two vaccines demonstrated notably higher efficacy AZ‚Äôs predominant form virus displayed efficacy ballpark South Africa. Plus, laboratory studies indicated significant debilitating drop B.135 using sera vaccinated either Pfizer Moderna‚Äôs vaccine. Also vaccines target region spike. Taken together make reasonable (but concrete assumption) mRNA vaccines remain effective B.135, likely within range efficacy seen Novavax Janssens vaccine.

Also beyond Janssens AZ‚Äôs vaccine use vector technology notably different, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware AZ uses simian Adenovirus

Im scientist who‚Äôs involved clinical trials id usually hesitant make comparison like circumstantial evidences quite strong case want know badly screwed German program right now.  Perhaps, something particularly awful dying see it. Cool, seen update. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard anything allocating based native populations. Pretty sure it‚Äôs based overall population. respect bars restaurants, difference really make? CDC says we‚Äôre gonna okay

Yeah, party U.S.A.  herd immunity advocate

Anyone advocates widespread vaccination ‚Äúherd immunity advocate‚Äù... supposed insult? Consider nearly ~20% population can‚Äôt yet get vaccinated (children). probably halfway (first doses) ~70% (of eligible pop) decides get vaccinated. press release Oxford vaccine dated April 14th German Merck. able find data connecting US Merck Oxford vaccine. saturday march 14th friend similar party. nice day, first spring weather. Normally would bring hope come instead last big hurrah :( said people going earlier 2 weeks second shot going cause spike. presupposes protection, minimum much protection 1 shot. disagrees. yes really wish people like say real person. still see big increase regardless unless distribution dropping ball. got lot J&amp;J pfizer/moderna increased output well numbers small almost meaningless. many, raw numbers, people placebo vaccine caught two weeks?

On contrary, there's separate study Israel‚Äôs Sheba Medical Center published Friday Lancet medical journal found among 7,214 hospital staff received first dose January, 85% reduction symptomatic Covid-19 within 15 28 days overall reduction infections, including asymptomatic cases detected testing, 75%.

And Minnesota-based clinic, study 31,000 people four US states received least one vaccine shot, found inoculations 75 percent effective 15 days first shot, around 83% effective 36 days first shot. don‚Äôt even know said that. It‚Äôs established Western medical gospel masks prevent illness 1918 flu counterproductive, must fit tested etc....

This MASSIVE shift public health practice West. always wrong think took one team batman style fell sword good us all. isn‚Äôt bigger news? wanna go japan too! get soon &lt;3 many vaccines Canada again? Definitely me. Lost lot good coworkers layoffs, yell boss able work home, constantly worried job security health family.

Novavax fits requirement. vaccine uses butterfly/ moth larvae use aborted fetuses. Thank you. :) states higher Native American population getting doses? mean? It‚Äôs still winter Symptoms vaccination immune system reacting, exact thing want. Drugs lessen symptoms turning lessening parts immune system, want. Unless reason can't, toughen vaccine reaction. can't, take painkillers AFTERWARD. Definitely best system already get shot.  


ENJOY symptoms/reaction vaccine, knowing feeling body prepping F actual real COVID ever dares get  upvoted? article/comment wasn‚Äôt directed you, feel need speak it?

It‚Äôs hard belief opinion anymore without someone trashing it. Wrong again. never said ‚Äúno protection‚Äù. fully vaccinated comes 2weeks second shot, correct.  Get first vaccine get. Yeah there's work, there's also resources handle it. California slower than, say, collection states combined population? lockdowns work, solution lockdowns.

He fortuneteller, uses data estimate enough herd immunity. Much expensive though. California. Another lesson fire pandemic team foister responsibility onto one person. took flight last year and, honestly, plane probably safest part journey. flew Delta pretty empty flight result flight attendants aggressive toward people wearing masks wearing properly. important factor, however, air filtration system plane. cabin air completely replaced every 4 minutes iirc, use intense HEPA filters recycled. top that, air flow setup way pulls air toward floor vents located. sucks potential droplets toward ground instead floating up, down, left, right.

I mean sure OpEd NYT laying 20 years studies East Asia March 17th info already public sphere. Tens times correct. western countries vaccinating fast US, EU vaccinated considerable part population July. mistake depend much AstraZeneca sure, delivered according plan, EU would vaccinated twice much now.  sooner burn better imo. important note Yellow Card data cannot used derive side effect rates compare safety profile COVID-19 vaccinations many factors influence ADR reporting. It‚Äôs reported clinical trial data Flu spread well COVID year. kids would get COVID typically get flu. big enough deal close schools. reported verified common sense logic match reality.

Studies verify expect actually happens super important, even boring.

Countries making policy decisions ""that's work"" vs. ""That works proved it"". I'm public school, since young people risk particular disease necessary step protect them. Also, many kids private school homeschooling option, essentially making mandatory. EXACTLY current procurement contracts placed. specifically enumerated US would get first x number doses.

Now trying argue something entirely different. fact trying argue exactly argued begin ...

I‚Äôm glad require several standard deviations less social interactions median person, let‚Äôs pretend that‚Äôs representative.  due respect, actually live Canada know it‚Äôs currently like here, don‚Äôt need expat remind me. much currently behind different whether behind end May/June.

There delays early everyone informed start roll out. planned could faster roll all. 

There‚Äôs timeline we‚Äôre target meet timeline, leave us weeks behind US. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying here. situation relatives doesn‚Äôt really make difference that. 

We‚Äôre much smaller population means vaccination efforts take much less time supply. Additionally, supply pipeline far greater we‚Äôve seen due multiple factors (namely approvals, COVAX, moderna/Pfizer retooling facilities EU). think companies corporation ‚Äúincentivies‚Äù punish people Gov anything. Gov can‚Äôt even enforce mask mandate much less ‚Äúinjecting something mah body‚Äù There's shortage vaccines past week. see [graph daily vaccines I'm assuming delivery bottlenecks need ironed out.  That‚Äôs interesting article - continually state % people obese _or_ overweight hospitalized due COVID (78%).... yet reiterate % Americans obese (~42%). That‚Äôs two different things. [According approximately 74% adults US either obese overweight. took part AZ trial US thought got actual vaccine. 2/3 chance vaccine, 1/3 placebo. placebo saline. Day got first shot woke fever 100.3 99 range whole day, tired, lot muscle soreness. Everything resolved next day.

Today got antibody test cheat see got results ‚Äúnon-reactive‚Äù. Got doses December. bit bummer, guess placebo effect - mind playing tricks body? 20% cases produce 80% transmission. cases actually produce subsequent transmission. Outside superspreading events virus really spread epidemically.

Your experience average household attack rate low actually typical. original question second dose responsible jump efficacy factor time elapsed start series.

You ask risk-reward analysis whether delayed second dose made sense. pointed legitimate reason even consider single shot response.

But since insist - percent efficacy 80+ year olds single delayed dose Biontech. number low - edge 50 percent nations required approval. nearly 30 percent lower two shot number (85 percent).

I'll stand assertion - second dose good reason, manufacturer knew this. second dose spacing arbitrary. ‚Äúwaste‚Äù list local Walgreens. Signed list Monday got shot yesterday. Moderna I‚Äôll go back 28 days. would waited line hours instead pharmacist said issues finding people take ‚Äúwasted‚Äù vaccine. Well, yes, that‚Äôs also anecdotal. could number factors led those, including age (risk clots increases dramatically 50s).

Statistically 0.6% women BC get blood clot ten years. That‚Äôs low itself, it‚Äôs significantly lower blood clot risk pregnant.

Ofc hope medical community keeps working improve it, believe doctors explain side effects BC women (including spotting, mood swings, lowered/increased sex drive, etc.). vast, vast majority women nothing worry about, shouldn‚Äôt need jump hoops already get contraceptives. precedent divisive, discriminatory breed mistrust. individual health, want go route segregation based that. essentially coercion thing someone consenting.

Woah, disrespect Dr. Jill Biden like Science moves faster accept information, great advances technology, knowledge infrastructure, it‚Äôs gonna updated faster ever before.

I agree, better think first speak. speak place change later. Absolutely. excellent real-life results Israeli study vindicate this. read long time ago, mass produced army laboratories, im sure financial gain there. probably some, then, country always someone profitting.  
I think main reason keep population calm pass sense security, people attack government actions increase unpopularity, passing strong man macho type act president has. 
If population thinks fully treatable, non lethal disease, take pill, go out, buy normally, make economy flow, good numbers, think main objective there. Except, ya know, I'm English. Way 30% population drop masks June literally regardless anyone government says. every 20 year old get vaccine public support going fall cliff. 

In fact, many states I‚Äôm quite sure already masking. Would bad environment? wanna burn mask, too, I? think fine, especially leaving category open-ended. sure kind site going to, pharmacies especially relaxed require eligibility checks per CDC. Really honor system. see Dr John Campbell‚Äôs video named ‚Äúpotential UK surge‚Äù

Is truth matter? info completely wrong. OWS nothing preclinical animal testing. Preclinical animal testing done three vaccines. primary purpose OWS secure funding companies spend capital without worrying risks. think he's taking vaccinated individuals change behaviors getting vaccine consideration. massive chunk population vaccinated long September shifts individual behavior gonna bring normalcy back government mandates will. Yeah we're probably least 2024... I‚Äôve conversation people low-risk categories. logic they‚Äôre highly unlikely severe complications virus. They‚Äôre likely asymptotic get it.

Salty English mod salty Makes sense. Covid March 2020 got J&amp;J vaccine, HORRIFIC side effects, presumably Covid already body reacted similiar Pfizer/moderna 2nd vaccine. Seems across board people covid much stronger reactions first vaccines people didn‚Äôt. kids die flu every single year. Yes wise. would love too, let me. Even though labeled essential work whole thing deal crazy holes work thought joke whole time. Administration can‚Äôt keep I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll getting point people don‚Äôt want it. wondering caught covid vaccine could take effect could get blood clots virus.

It good careful though need make sure get bad batch. all. always wear masks yes, travel job, plane also filters air every couple minutes. I‚Äôd argue they‚Äôre they‚Äôre safest people. agree good take promoting vaccine wouldn‚Äôt call ‚Äúsuper spreaders steroids‚Äù well done all, showing matter beliefs unite helping fellow Americans defeat horrible enemy. would interested discussion many deaths worth it, comparing risks accept (driving, flu, whatever). often see things like article say zero bad goal, without attempting quantify anything all. read gives hope I‚Äôm Idaho knows. Wanting continue make people wear masks even data signs point vaccines stopping thing tracks preventing serious illness transmission disease intrusion people's lives. 

If want continue wear mask, it. We're coming point real soon asking someone else wear one insane notion, many would argue we're already there.

Again, stop moving goal posts further. curve flattened (actually spiraling down), vaccine use exploding, we've accomplished wanted accomplish goal posts moved 11 straight months. forget guy pretend past 4 years never happened.

Frieman returns TWiV discuss COVID-19 pandemic point view coronavirologist, including work Novavax spike protein-based vaccine.

[Matt Frieman also, let's face it. He's former President. nation's best interest keep alive partly continue secret service. UK.

*Some* UK. 8 million significantly less half 35 million. Personally support treated way vaccines. They‚Äôre mandatory general, required say public school... Maybe bit asterisk. Schools take precautions (for example, masking, time - classes), especially elementary schools. IIRC, place US opened schools precautions sudden spread high schools. want say Georgia.

Our schools open since August precautions. kid (1st grade) whole time person full classrooms (our school system reduce class sizes, didn't). seems mostly fine. think there's maybe 20 cases school 500 kids however many staff implies. Half staff. true. Yesterday 2 million administered 4.7 million delivered. 

Problem administration. Maintaining bureaucracy gets shots fruitless effort. think keep pharmacies age basis mass vaccination sites opened anyone. source DNC told Vladimir Putin seen Kroger's. Maybe he's immortal Australia country middle ocean 25 million almost zero way people get unless fly. shut airports that's it. major countries advantage. nice life normal can't say they're gold standard literally one way virus get in. hasn‚Äôt been? Elections month. Plus restaurant owners forced government open like idiots forced close back I'm glad feel able reduce subtleties two complex contracts made two different legal systems involving multiple chains production couple sentences, think we'd best leave task interpreting AZ's commitments AZ. didnt vaccine production facilities 12 months ago paid company set two us.

And export vaccines. last week. hasn‚Äôt case first 75 days vaccine drive. Title shoud say 13000 excess deaths 1st year covid.

""as coronavirus pandemic took significant toll country‚Äôs population"" 

I agree 0.03% significant... Serum Institute India, world‚Äôs largest vaccine maker, already bulk-manufacturing Oxford University/AstraZeneca product plans start producing Novavax Inc shot next month.  government allowed \[Pfizer\] sell higher-priced private market, however, also controlling exports. Pfizer Moderna, whose shots expensive AstraZeneca one used India‚Äôs immunisation campaign, comfortable strict price export restrictions, one sources said.  week, Reuters reported leaders Quad alliance - Australia, Japan, India United States - plan announce financing agreements increase India‚Äôs vaccine manufacturing capacity first meeting Friday. say wrong. LOL AMERICA GIVE ANOTHER MOUNTAIN DEW Zero

Ah number different export UK cant really ne blamed pharma companies havent setup production facilities here, force to?

Why would setup facilities post brexit world? There's reason BENELUX world-wide pharma super hub. vote comment top. add list, Ohio's eligibility 50 older well. high likelihood boosters going reality people future, isn‚Äôt there? Even it‚Äôs annual like flu, clearly new variants flying around one year later concern enough warrant additional study. don‚Äôt see news bad thing. quickly successfully got last one out, makes optimistic. Even current shots 70% effective new variants I‚Äôll sign 94% questions asked. critique US effort pretty clear never real ""best"" way controlling it

I mean, Australia pretty good job no? Maybe best cause lockdowns lifted long ago friends going normal daily lives economy seems okay? That‚Äôs fair. We‚Äôll probably end passing onto countries deficit. think mass vaccination sites somewhat helps distribution think would much convenient efficient increase supplies everyone's local CVS, Walgreens, Walmart,.. people live close one retailers would prevent mass gatherings travel many people going mass sites encounter.

You could instead send workers mass sites local store could greatly increase # doses store day. People would much likely go need travel far need wait long line. administering wal marts everywhere. ones get jimmy John‚Äôs vaccine congrats!!! Piggly Wiggly doesn‚Äôt -70 freezer. mass vax sites real powerhouses administration many states. somewhat agree - vaccinating nursing homes covid ward staff, free front line priority higher risk folks may better idea. guess depends are. state would probably crack free clinic. Alaska hand immunizing everyone 16 up. California opening access immunocompromised patients starting 15th. pleasant bad contrast alternative. kind wish simply waited J&amp;J one get with. Sounds like one making people less miserable. Oh well. Got first Pfizer shot today. far sore arm, fatigue, mild nausea, weird foggy head. I'm 12 hour mark. talking wearing mask reduces risk infection everyone. Walgreens people said aren‚Äôt given extra staff 40-50 shots days asked administer throwing major wrench normal operations pharmacy. Like said, many factors play. mechanics transmission simple though. Good luck, i'll staying inside fully over, Holy hell potentially another 1 1/4 years?

Is EU wanting increase vaccination something? expect laws everything prevent that. think nothing dangerous activities like drunk driving tell people ""well try avoid walk/bike/public transportation

Last time checked drunk people hit too. conservative. last heard directly Biden mid May we'd possession enough doses every adult US would take time get everyone, plus delay trailing second doses. I'm thinking July latest, August pessimistic. know doesn‚Äôt matter individual seeking vaccine, public health perspective low cost, highly transportable single dose vaccine big deal, many officials excited it. Moderna Pfizer vaccines much expensive difficult handle. JnJ alongside AZ Sputnik, good hope availability cheap vaccines reality year many poorer countries. Also, don‚Äôt know enough testing factors surrounding - JnJ study likely included exposure recent variants. two things keep mind. said acknowledge ‚Äúlack evidence against‚Äù =/= ‚Äúevidence for‚Äù personally happy got Moderna regimen Take easy. Expect head ache, body aches, low grade fever next couple days. He's right lol  know EU made contract AZ one day UK? 
If two customers buy 100 pieces company company produce 50. customer get 25. would fair play. UK want play way. That's awsome :) link included even says 2 weeks final dose. guess so, sure. hit road, know there‚Äôs chance someone else road who‚Äôs driving drunk erratically. either accept take risk anyway walk/bike/public transportation work. prescribed z-pack positive test. said prevent bacterial pneumonia Saw article California getting green tier. 

Good.

1 case/100k might borderline impossible larger counties. Inmates front line California. mean get risk. giving Covid resolved inmates elderly?  come far wide? ~10% population fully vaccinated, ~10% covid, around ~30% asymptomatic? 

We got close 50% population level antibodies. could done end month. 100 million people vaccinated already. Don‚Äôt scared. Indiana 50+, well certain high risk medical conditions, healthcare workers, first responders, teachers. 40+ probably come next week. actually pretty well, exception like first hour expand age limits website stays working, people always call 211 someone book appointment them. people vaccinated state people tested positive! relief bill I‚Äôm guessing Biden start pressuring states drop age thresholds.

Into 2022 discernible reason? Lol. Nobody:

Osterholm 2023: ""the darkest days pandemic yet come""  title editorialized. article mentions unnamed spokesperson. tried find primary source this, seems none. unsurprising, given fact vaccine exports UK. Ok lol making science-based decisions. De Blasio one strictest lockdown politicians. New York got hit worst rush anything too. People able anything local health mandates allow, eating inside included. Abbott created awful situation. Fights going break everywhere. Good! depends state sets policy it‚Äôs enforced. It‚Äôs common show evidence comorbidities guys remember depressing subreddit like around 1 year ago ? Well kudos everyone, made it. strong reaction first shot, may indication previously covid immune system already ""primed"". 

We definitely go route, would get us end point faster. data there; strong reactions first shot correlate producing antibodies quickly, likely resulting prior infection. 

Once reach herd immunity time figure booster schedule. guess older people immunocompromised need boosters every year, rest us might not.

You always decide decline 2nd dose strong reaction first one trust protected due prior infection combined one dose mRNA vaccine. sure cancel appointment ahead time someone else get slot. though? Canada bragging thousand doses day major city. NC isn‚Äôt requiring proof eligibility it‚Äôs really easy get one want appointments haven‚Äôt terribly hard come by. Unfortunately know ton eligible people antivax there‚Äôs shots would go waste. know... could stop closing things based cases. vulnerable vaccinated focused hospitalizations, clear out. confirmed lot people lately. weather also getting warmer, means people spending times outdoors. I've seen people complain honestly, makes feel great see people's posts getting jab. gotten vaccine yet (don't qualify yet state) celebrate every one, one step closing over!!! getting overrun variants. Reddit way cases coming US, Europe high steady plateau wherever vaccines arrived. terrible see. want planet. looked like idiots somehow owe world something? US owes world nothing, quite opposite actually. everyone wants vaccine get one, thing surplus. you‚Äôre family one people.

Interesting see much better US, also flu deaths. gets ass kicked fucking wrong one, then? paid much UK alone did. telling us monkeys apes San Diego worthy 90% us? fucks sake... someone please explain logic me? I've heard times still get they're ""hinting"" statement. [governor Texas threatening sue city remove city mask mandate everyone knows 72% is, everyone real world knows J&amp;J within 95% CI death hospitalization efficacy rates Moderna Pfizer 2 dose regiments.

How supposed change anything previous poster said? approved vaccines similarly effective hospitalization/death. J&amp;J significantly worse symptomatic infection (and probably transmission along it). One dose vaccine would give similar better results. 

It‚Äôs really *bad* vaccine, doesn‚Äôt change fact others available better. hear you, really do. I've edge months. 

I guess I'd say looks like we're maybe 30 days vaccine open everyone (I'm back line too, although thankfully wife teacher got already). concerned, get it, use tools available us minimize risk- double mask out, use delivery groceries, etc.

For me, absolute stress I've last year WAY worse statistical likelihood bout COVID, I'll struggling hypertension, depression, stomach issues related stress, long, long time. ain't long COVID, something good. party small government/local control folks. I've Plaquenil continuously 5 years Lyme. never supply problems. think exaggerated time. Double means 2x shots = double vaccinated Day day, check numbers think exact thing. NC open essential workers, chosen require proof. think intentional lot people going Walgreens end day easily claiming unclaimed vaccines. Still 18+ though! worry would cave pressure organizations send portion vaccine suplply overseas population vaccinated. want help world, need get country back feet first.

Very happy statement, he‚Äôs keeping focus US he‚Äôs offering help world. reason people immunocompromised get vaccine? know fuck vaccine.  Weird flex okay captain vaccination whatever say friend ADHD, general anxiety disorder clinical depression. itching get covid vaccine looking excuse eligible. he‚Äôs saying since mental health issues, increased risk severe covid/death wants try ‚Äújump line‚Äù get vaccine. 

Is evidence back claim mental health issues increase risk severe covid death covid? find questionable sources myself. Lake County says ""Vaccine supply limited. Health Department continues vaccinate 1a. partners vaccinating 1b."" plan expanding so-called ""1b plus"" group. matters me, rate general population vaccinated summer. cannot fathom Lake County places would far behind. confirm. think secret‚Äôs since appointments dried CVS pretty quickly. ( got mine legally know many getting shots even though ineligible) could think sense worked ass privilege staying locked :] yall would cooperated beginning, work it. veterans (especially small towns) check VA via phone call. I‚Äôm 34 risks got first shot yesterday. VA supply comes directly federal government state supply. you‚Äôre going open everything allow anyone get vaccine Laws huge deterrent illegal activity. would lot people automatic weapons, grenades, rocket launchers bunch stuff legal without enormous hassle get tax stamps things. can‚Äôt help imagine revived Balto rest sled dog team deliver vaccines. We're gonna lucky get like 60% population take it, much less 100%... we'll enough everyone, there's way everyone get one 100% agree. I'd honestly rather admit feel ""icky"" without mask on... buying thought already bought enough everyone get end May? dont like it. knew would repercussions. anti maskers unfortunately. Yeah. got updated today. using yesterdays stats. Oregon got like 120k doses 24 hours. love pro-mask types suddenly clutching pearls calling people murderers sociopaths wearing mask past 11 months lol Go right ahead. Movie theaters Texas open while. Everything fine. Many say thanks Actually. must looking mirror hate, directed people want provide families. 

How small you. know hard someone like get head around.

Think ushers, concession stand, janitors, wait staff currently unemployed. collecting paycheck need one. 

People children going hungry. clear local federal government give shit them. Maybe should.

Its amazing happens take responsibility health safety. want go baseball game Texas. Don't. worried maskless people grocery store, ways around that, mentioned. put fucking hazmat suit concerned.

But nope won't. put health faith others. Man, that's lazy. Exactly. ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù way make seem like democrats don‚Äôt care Americans. believe read illegals sent back Obama‚Äôs first term trump‚Äôs. forgot little detail üôà think single dose considered vaccinated. partial vaccination. double vaccinated means got 200% vaccinated. year ""OmG wROnG stUpiD amERiCanS!?"", Americans (including me, outside commentary EU citizens fucking assholes past year) lot sympathetic us. Well yeah. I'm sure point is. even likely catch home ever also go out. actual point continued mask wearing social distancing covid endemic eliminated? Seriously, wanna hear thoughts. 15 year olds still ineligible? think slower get open likely still days week, mostly person now. Paxton criminal anyway. give one rat's ass says.  Actually seen maybe hundreds open appointments city LA sites past 3 days. It‚Äôs mind blowing. think got temporary big allocation many low income zip codes clearly demand softer among food/ag/edu/emergency workers expected could also think millions people went work every day pandemic could stay locked home allowed actually enjoy life, remain locked consuming services. one example many people using phrase colloquially.  fault ya'll literally braindead also share one population vaccinated, right it‚Äôs case. actually referring population geographical size. Sounds like household member? sounds intelligent. I'm also area. Thats good. Trump probably wouldve done way stupid thats things lol Florida‚Äôs governor accused something similar. Mexico relying heavily Sinovac Russian one. read much effective is, let's hope best. friend back got first dose.

I wonder Canada also rely Chinese Russian ones still wait. I‚Äôm saying someone would iq 50

Sounds like expert area. Retail workers currently getting vaccinated Colorado. mean son law normal government stuff Moose Jaw? Asking done two wildly different things.

Just wear mask, mean federal government pay stay home. 

So guess people work. follow guidelines set forth government. feel like still danger, provide additional protections. Hawaii large population. Also, people cold climates risk people warm climate Canada also going end largest surplus vaccines, they've ordered vaccines per capita Help Yemen out, eh? Broward college? it? Sorry, looking clarification: person diagnosed covid take prevent spreading (I know may take prevent severe disease) household members taking reduce chances catching it? Excess deaths Brazil matching reported data much closely US.  deserves upvotes never get thought trump administration zero plans? Biden admin complaining thought they'd inherit something inherited pile nothing. J&amp;J *is* approved US.  Many Asian countries already it, might well try Paxton's demands local mask mandates almost certainly killed people South Dakota AG.  1 hour delay fetching comments.

The capacity isn‚Äôt even remotely close tapped administration shots. Kinda benefit unified health system, close enough anyways.

If doses provinces, administered. 300,000 doses day April reasonable.

They every year already. infrastructure place. additional vaccine sites opening preparation. Thanks heads-up! work third-party driving school, I'm sure whether qualify teacher purposes. Would go School Staff - Other? able get straight answer, even TDLR. lot - I'm certified Wilderness First Responder got training couple hours. gotten vaccines UK whole.  one dose, yes are. reason basically every jurisdiciton Canada (possibly outside territories) followed NACI's recommendation delay 2nd doses 4 months (hopefully shorter)

They track 36.5 million doses end June, even including doses main AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson NovaVax contracts.  contracts, likely Canada 40-45 million doses depending close come meeting targets.

Some provinces think first doses done end May. US opens supply chain Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J us, June earlier, well may enough vaccine everyone supply everyone fully vaccinated end June early/mid July (with administeration lagging August September get everyone second doses).

But point being, time US ready donate/sell doses, Canada desperate position, likely spot administering bottleneck. Yes did. 

Yes did. really. I‚Äôm face face 60 20-27 year old boys. age group makes 35% positive cases MN. K-12 age students make 13% positive cases MN. left CDC says older students effectively distance learn. true, us required face face classes. kinda treated like don‚Äôt exist. previous administration would throw away I'm assuming corporate owned properties small fraction actual properties planet. (Use manage hotels Marriott hotels) percentages pulled group actually required hospital care. 

It cold flu young people. serious rare few, like cold flu. Elderly ones high risk. Pushing ""young people scared"" slop ridiculous unproductive. America last...worst president ever...need Trump back Mission accomplished. Found slot safeway 15 miles zip. Goodnight good luck! Check PM details. Really, really hope right. like reality want live it. Unlike one I'm tired of: Prone position boner probably killed him, ouch soneone please explain Florida lower COVID cases per capita California despite fact Florida wide open months California still locked down? genuinely would like hear thoughts this. Sporting KC starting 14 17% whatever ended 2020 increasing later season vaccinated population lower case count allows safer gathering. Nice live go safely enjoy game (Royals starting 10k 37k cap). Publix $10 gift cards them. Great chicken tendy Talk tyranny, say libs oppressors think it‚Äôs definitely artifact prior Covid exposure. friends didn‚Äôt Covid minor reactions it, friends previously infected bad side effects. Rolling lockdowns forever 5 ppl feel safe Yeah, it‚Äôs weird. restrict freedoms claim provide healthcare though. 

It‚Äôs kind like prisoners ‚Äî people supposed punished incarceration say, starve death die treatable medical condition. prisoners can‚Äôt get food medical care, society obligated provide it. 

So members military might greater claim vaccine regular citizen we‚Äôve promised healthcare live group housing. 

But medical/hospital perspective, military high priority grocery store workers. Nope, DC Hawaii RI seeing high demand. It‚Äôs Republican states without cities. Agreed According movie bunkers would help us world comes end change anything. clarifies it. necessary clarification.

The irony entire post/comment chain he's arguing strawman. blabbers ""the media"" saying show dead wrong clams hear again. Well imported initially technically exported... reroute europe except Germany France since really want it. Honestly PA isn‚Äôt bad. Philly bad, it‚Äôs it‚Äôs jurisdiction. Allegheny, we‚Äôre like 25% adults. County 65+, pharmacies everyone else. isn‚Äôt *easy* get people appointments, isn‚Äôt hard either. Agreed, Canada take care and/or beg UK excess doses. US help Mexico, C/S America. ""America First"" actually means ""white people first."" 

Sorry, say quiet part loud?  Plus guys water. We‚Äôll wanting ... That's said allowing exports would helpful. Currently ban exports US, they're sitting vaccines can't even use moment approved use US yet approved Canada (J&amp;J example approved US approved Health Canada days ago). matter, people care fear facts. cases go without rise hospitalizations deaths, media easily spin likelyhood new variants evade current vaccines go drastically cases drop due vaccinations/etc. COVID-19 whole year millions bodies mutate ""come w/"" favorable changes.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Administration constraints pretty high, too. hit 3 million flu shots day last fall Businesses can. Local municipalities can't. Jan 20, 7 day avg 890k shots. Today two million, infact, highest last week nearly 3mil.  sure, definitely stretch, pointing actual link is, guy think friend *completely* full it. R name kids get it..? He‚Äôs government official qualified immunity. It‚Äôs okay kill people.
/s guys actually works Covid Currently holed bed space heater blasting towards me. Can't get warm. Definitely (on milder side) rigors. Headache, manageable. particularly fatigued, scrapped plans get bit work done bed.

FWIW, coughing month April. Possible I've COVID before, never tested positive, speculation.

Not happy this, beats ever loving shit social distancing forever. path normal, easy trade off. Canada track people vaccinated summer. like September. wonder physically hand, option buy. reason sit doses months manufacturing steady. fuck getting downvoted!? WOW fuck subreddit. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ time delay pretty short manufacture arms! Like, two weeks, max. ""It's fantastic news,"" said Rajesh Gandhi, MD, infectious disease physician Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, treating people seriously ill COVID-19 since pandemic began year ago Boston. ""For individuals who, whatever reason, get vaccine decline vaccine yet gotten vaccine, really proof antibodies prevent disease"" COVID-19. hanging people personally fully vaccinated, probably before, even I‚Äôm ‚Äúlast line‚Äù US supply going outweigh demand couple months, don‚Äôt feel like risking finish line. 

However, think it‚Äôs starting come safety isn‚Äôt people‚Äôs concern, it‚Äôs literally thought pandemic ending deal invited places social anxiety issues. nervous social pressures returning normal, recognize it‚Äôs time face head nip bud. I‚Äôve started making plans friends June. Eh, hadn‚Äôt quite gotten yet, track 1 million day. Fed guidance helped though saying Texas? It‚Äôs pretty unlikely add restrictions back possible, highly unlikely occurrence. like dying COVID. know risks, proceed accordingly.

It's pandemic. People die. sucks. I've lost family it. show signed contract life promised face scary health crises life. Well, definitely don‚Äôt Covid then.  12's busy getting regular vaccinations anyway. indicated election, he‚Äôs investigated new corruption office charges folks worked resigned protest star witnesses. party ‚Äúdraining swamp‚Äù folks. Lol title. 3 hour erections aren‚Äôt rare (yeahhhh baby); dying covid epic erection, hospital less, probably quite rare indeed. eligibility problem.

Let distribute want. stupid realize nothing I've mentioned conspiracy theory, that's problem.

One jackass another told year DeSantis done one thing another right... later verified numbers purposefully miscalculated, withheld, amd throttled give false impressions.

It's OPINION things happened. DOH officials verified much it, acvidental dumps confirmed lied public months.

Take trolling ignorance somewhere else. Literally strongest case ""America first"" president, hear nationalists singing praises. Odd. tried bleach hydroxychloroquine? hear great things. Everyone's saying it.  ty detailed response. friend comorbidities, aside maybe slightly overweight (nowhere near obese though). Sounds like actually increased risk all. know he's scared though, mental health going downhill due cooped inside unable socialize person friends/family.  Would able get Brazil expires? iirc Canada debacle failed investment another country‚Äôs vaccine programme, correct? Honesty question movies even showing currently. big movies got pushed back, showing older classics like Indy movies not. friend moron misinterpreting paragraph (emphasis mine):

""During March 1‚ÄìDecember 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied 2,313 (73.6%) 3,142 U.S. counties.

Daily case death growth rates implementation mask mandates statistically different reference period.""

They're trying say mandating masks prevented 2% cases. misinterpreting (through malice stupidity) bolded part made leaving reductions happening **every day.** is, mask mandate saw every single day reduction cases 0.5-2%. Compound course month, 2% decrease every day 30 days, well 20% reduction cases. Compound course months months pandemic raged reduced cases enormous amount well beyond 2%--on orders hundreds percent decrease cases. consenting Doc like ""if feel sick shot, that's vaccine...... could also cold flu, can't sure....""  regretting said moment words left mouth. maybe caught one cold past year. 

Good luck you! Math totals math totals. observation strengthens argument US needs less vaccines more. What‚Äôs Starbucks? really can't understand this. Wow. wow.

Ok, person goes baseball game. gets infected. goes work. Person B work. Person B can't sit home day gets infected. person B goes home. gives family, on. person never went ballgame properly socially distanced (not happening packed stadium) person B get infected. reduces spread, reduces deaths, yay, fewer people die someone get go meaningless baseball game.

BTW...insert situation besides work. grocery store, post office, DMV, etc. place person goes workers. family go school, another job, etc.

Holy shit getting that? getting actually firing back me. wow! Japan set. Currently vaccine still offered medical workers, within next week two internal talks medical experts saying available everybody general public. phases like going through. also got second dose, anyone able to. doesn‚Äôt make oblivious facts, idk you‚Äôre fighting losing argument. literally studies showing 1 dose effective, 2 doses effective recommended doesn‚Äôt change that. trend everywhere. general issues mistrust, fear side effects general preference Western vaccines. also misleading quickly link 6 events vaccine see haven‚Äôt considered amount Americans 16 can‚Äôt take vaccine...

Math! Thanks link. *confusing* use term ""inactivated"". I'm assuming CDC actually defined clear category mRNA Adenoviral vectors actually fit categorizing subunit vaccines end result spike without rest coronavirus although vectors selves like live attenuated vaccine (But targeted virus present whole subunit)

However, clip pretty much saying count ""live"" vaccine anyone advised avoid live vaccines. able replicate control absence effective immune response become virulent like truly live attenuated vaccines. work something that's airborne? came tell guys got ""Covid arm"" Pfizer, Moderna. 1st dose exactly 8 days ago, last night shower started feel itchy body, specially legs (odd). Today noticed mild soreness injection site touched noticeably warm touch. Looked literature news articles point Moderna. Really shocked many people super low risk stayed cooped whole time. even told evil person grocery store shopping getting haircut masked LOL people really drank crazy juice. Semi-related, I‚Äôve got pretty legit anxiety regularly causes clock elevated blood pressure anytime it‚Äôs measured. enough technically qualify underlying condition. feel little weird since people much worse conditions me. Yes exponential decrease exponential increase. Means masks lot damn good. 16% Alaska‚Äôs population Alaska Native Native American (under IHS vaccine allotment) Yes got second dose I‚Äôm gonna trust medical team tells me. problem you? I'd argue forgot, ""and never person color."" saying quiet part loud. lack empathy towards fellow human beings darker skin defining trait nationalist. I‚Äôd love see Canada fully vaccinated end summer. BC government saying everyone chance get vaccinated fall sincerely doubt whose taxes paid it, subsidized companies years. respectfully disagree 100%. Chicago major cities adjusting response according virus does, e.g. ICU beds available, test positivity rate trends etc. get high, restrictions certain stuff may close again. works numbers go back down, stuff opens increased capacity. static response many major metropolitan areas, any. dynamic entire time. trends see exclusively due mitigation efforts. seems attributing purely chance?  really want counter china, need vaccinate africa. China neo imperializing shit continent  seems like things keep going way past middle ground here. understand desire optimistic year we've had. staying informed even negative ongoings absolutely necessary keep making joke because....it's true lol USA like joke beer quality well same. think hoping fool anyone lol. arm hurt though! got chills body aches though.  I'm reading right 1.9% reduction daily growth rate deaths. lot days adds up. plug 1.15^100 calculator, plug 1.17^100 compare result - Anyone reading hours later, passed. read article mate? Right like obviously someone Down‚Äôs would qualify opinion mild autism Add/adhd really wouldn‚Äôt I'm.not pulling stats. Im simple math. fooling you. Wake up! mean really much opinion matter, I'm telling purchase info I've heard. got blocked Eric Feigl Ding literally saying ‚Äúrules thee, me‚Äù Yeah I‚Äôve thinking lot. Actually getting first dose tomorrow due minor underlying condition definitely anxiety able return world. Aside the, know, pandemic sort coasted through‚Äîwith plenty guilt, agree dangerous ultimately unproductive mentality Multiple people literally put data face ignoring posting incorrect misleading info. Downvote want, remember 2 weeks slow spread turned 1 year? at-risk people extended family gotten vaccines. going try get many people vaccinated possible big family gathering Memorial Day akin Thanksgiving (since missed holidays last year). glad conversation now. mean can't figure out. Deploying medicine Ebola also required highly complex supply chains huge pains ass, ultimately doable. done. Healthy people die extremely low ones don‚Äôt die get permanent lung scarring cardiovascular issues

I‚Äôd love see source every survivor permanent lung damage.

If vulnerable people can‚Äôt get vaccinated, what‚Äôs endgame? Lockdown forever? people never going get less vulnerable. US put huge amount orders vaccines even trials, sure would access ones end getting approved soon approved. means US allocation larger US population actually needs enough vaccines end effective. Children aren‚Äôt included. You‚Äôre trying pull stats make incorrect point sound right. significantly enough everyone point. WH wouldn‚Äôt say going give surplus countries didn‚Äôt. literally said last week would enough person May. Keep up. I'M SIR. I'M MEAT POPSICLE. LET'S WATCH NEW DISNEY MOVIE. Well going infect people? Magic transmission? one sitting home getting infected someone went baseball game went grocery store. think it‚Äôs pretty well documented location someone else get virus. coronavirus subreddit. really understand concept? Also, major trade tourism USA, Canada, Mexico. want heavy trading partners vaccinated fast start stimulating economy. - know fake name!? POCKET SAND

(So excited gotten though! Arm little sore expect worse side effects hit soon, it'll worth it. Thanks asking!) Well prepared lose. deliveries ramping up, likely chance get first dose June. 
People getting vaccinated second dose scheduled June Montreal. 

Canadians need realize deliveries ramping big way adults getting first dose ~June 22 Gotcha. I‚Äôm obtuse I‚Äôm worried happening around taking UCLA doctors advice reading paperwork Pfizer gave me. obtuse won‚Äôt capitulate opinion internet. guess thought counts ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è worst way respond. It'll 2022 government mask mandates business mask requirements completely gone. Disney World saying they're keeping masks 2022 glimpse thinking large businesses. pull pants piss leg. say. pants piss wouldnt leg. Followed understand masks important. Well, exactly response looking for. I‚Äôm going let name calling insults rebuttal. 350M ""Americans"" 400M doses, 60% want it.
I passed 5th grade math but, 350M Americans, 400M doses 40% 350M Americans (140M) willing take it. ""deal"" another transfer wealth taxpayer big pharma corporate America whole. Dang 56 days out?

*Stares Canadian* I‚Äôm going bit optimistic commenter say point year. Everyone still able get shot states think respectfully wait that. Ok wel you‚Äôre obtuse asshat know. data shows 1 dose provides pretty significant amount protection. one saying skip second, still likely fine one dose alone 3-4weeks production? know people leave game infect others, right? year. coronavirus subreddit. really understand concept?

Honestly, lack simple knowledge virus makes wonder brigading going on. makes sense anyone subscribed subreddit would ignorant. mean he's selling states kiss ass companies stakes in? Hmm surely human president would ever done thing.  misgivings Japan SK. Japan totally bungled vax efforts. They're also ridiculously demanding separate clinical trials demonstrate safety giving approval. really want go ahead Olympics, can't imagine worse way handling it. SK same. failed develop vaccine *now* beginning vax efforts earnest. bullshit ""safety review"" excuses. Japanese Korean residents provide perspective this? Bc makes sense despite crushing covid early on, basically gonna last line vaccinate people. year half million deaths US alone. Let idiot friend go idiot. N first, S. Youre getting votes get mean, people think theaters get crowded they'll likely host 25% capacity, really think safer go movie theater enforces masks restaurant.  do, get call idiot don‚Äôt want to. worry, matter say now, vaccines work. reality much population get vaccinated coming months cases, hospitalization deaths fall. reality strong which, stop believing it, go away.

‚Äï Philip K. Dick sounds lot like States ngl Treatment generally prolongs life patient, causes time allow mutations. There's reason variants popping immunocompromised populations (HIV/AIDs patients countries rich enough keep alive) -- virus gets plenty time evolve weak immune response can't clear it.

Again, citation please. appears statement personal opinion. Pretty positive get vaccine soon opens gen pop first place basically... like restaurant? think people back work government tells go back work.

I think Florida heap mess hoping. Georgia either. 

The saying 'fuck it' approach seems hit miss, rather random me. Masks not, lockdowns not. 

Seems like social distancing scientifically proven method. still doubt masks, based facial hair, quality, cleanliness, seal. guess want social distance several months, maybe work. I've mentioned many times fully believe repercussions locking going greater damage covid. easy measure things.

Of course I'm worried people. consider many friends, acquaintances work, struggling, children, without. People living alone, elderly without interaction. 

There much personally do, make enough donate, job security air due rolling lockdowns well. wear mask I'm supposed to. venture see friends unnecessarily. much else do. US isn‚Äôt even banning export vaccines even banning vaccine RAW MATERIALS vaccine productions. Absolutely pathetic. mean obviously consider middle ground decided go all. Likely baseball opening day lot bigger event week 6 season. Hell, week 6 they‚Äôll likely 75% capacity that‚Äôs many people normally show up. USA country produces vaccine hoarding USA citizens. government US govt absolutely get people giving countries, like common sense. I'd say likely 2023. It'll long couple years Fauci moving goalposts. Get used lol it'd 135 days first dose us Canadians, eh? hahahasobhahaha Yeah, guess wasn‚Äôt super clear. I‚Äôm sure compliance high Chicago. point Covid cases rose fell along generally trajectory comparable metros, regardless mitigation measures place, compliance measures. 

One biggest misconceptions I‚Äôve noticed whole debate there‚Äôs consensus among experts lockdowns good: opinion much splintered you‚Äôd think. It‚Äôs one side gets lot attention media. enough every American want it, 100M top ~400M doses already committed. What‚Äôs crazy Australia New Zealand cases probably go vaccine reopening (instead down) bc well handling whole thing. special treatment. whole thing vaccines supposed give people risk death virus. That's we've prioritized elderly front line workers. That's also America getting vaccinations. They're evidently risk death. never problem, pretty much anyone could get 1st dose tried since mid January. Since 5 weeks ago, anyone could get officially, there's even line, multiple opening everyday wherever want.

The thing \~29-30% Israel's population 16. We're currently 86% eligible population least 1 dose. 93% non Ultraorthodox Arab eligible population least 1 dose (just showcase availability).

Getting 2 shots absolutely right call, especially elderly people actually getting severely ill dying, light statistics get:

\- 935 COVID deaths Israel February.

\- 553 unvaccinated.

\- 240 1 dose (so 1 3 weeks 1st dose, 2 unprotected yet).

\- 142 deaths 1st week 2cond dose.

\- **0 deaths 1 week second look Israel's numbers need account two things.

1. Cases high lot unvaccinated kids open schools. 50% new cases 19 down, many 16. lot new cases also among 20-40 demographic lower % vaccinated 40+. Especially among 20-30's.
2. comes severe cases, vaccine sceptic populations suffer most. 45% new severe cases Arabs, exhibited significant anti vaxx sentiment (the mini wave cause spike vaccination among them, going take weeks effect number).

Despite two factors, every metric still going down. see severe cases decline among Arabs week two, lead overall significant drop severe cases deaths another week later. many people think bankrupt go hospital covid states? know Canada answer zero general that's true, parents feel safe every high school 100 cases even masks, even cases severe, they'll opt put kids online anyway. able school without masks fall, vaccines age group would go long way helping anxiety lot parents sending teenagers back. huge issue try reach parents students failing online setting even though person option students year, feel safe send back yet. Yes except current timeframe they're actually coming Canada still looking around end Sept 2 dose 70% Hi, I'm removing confusing sounds like believe conspiracy theory. get (given context comment) given reported, gonna err side caution remove :) Thanks.  Annnd Texas overruling exact thing entire thread about, ie Austin's mask know do, care think do. kind thing sociopath thinks about. game comparing two people like matters all. never been. science preventing needless deaths. Yet live life like game ""I better you."" sociopath. care others. care look. it. hand actually care people's lives, also go website crowing like bearing actual situation.

You literally took conversation allowing full crowds baseball game made you. self centered can't even realize self centered is. heard Wuhan? Apparently already tried that... nursing home 20 employees 200 residents, prioritize employees, eliminate risk 220 people using 20 vaccines. vaccine rollout, lot states tier gets first. instance, state people 65 work schools get vaccine. Next week, 50 year olds get vaccine.

So case, places holding COVID-19 clinics anyone get want one regardless age occupation? immunocompromised looking get one doctor said might even me, got call family member day saying ""go downtown, university giving moderna shot anyone wants one.""

How work? incredibly thankful able gotten vaccine, curious able get despite regulations.

In public setting, think anyone wearing mask tantamount sending loud clear message everyone else: ""PISS YOU!"" PA bottom ten.

We're sitting something like 1.3 million doses. wish could find source numbers. demand definitely appointments get snapped within minutes getting posted here. I‚Äôll wear mask store avoid huge events, like god damn ready move on. I‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs full quarantining since March last year PERIOD Ages 12-16 per article. PERIOD Geopolitics still thing. Plus frankly don‚Äôt need it. sign list specifically left doses? eligible group qualify? sign online? Sorry questions lol. Glad got vaccine! That's way countries expected, thought contracts half dozen far. definitely makes doubt also able produce enough Russia. 
 
I agree huge vacuum US EU left, particular US. Trump really favours foreign politics. EU opportunity step take it. 
 
While think Chinese Russian help may come strings attached, would EU/US help although might bit subtle. Criticising Russia China vaccine diplomacy definitely hypocritical, think stems frustration handling pandemic. criticism Russia that, considering bad outbreak is, they're favouring vaccine diplomacy saving citizens. China makes lot sense, whether lied size outbreak, seem well control exporting vaccine fastest way end pandemic also making lot friends. Damn, got mine 8 hours ago. 100% aside mild arm pain, certainly getting chills, small headache, dizziness, overly tingly sensation.

Gee, that's bad. Really. love seattle servers Understandable. necessary vaccination proof vaccination. 

But like said really moot point nothing implemented impossible now. Well hope enough people vaccinated get covid point longer need worry it. telling this?

To try give complete picture what's happening used countries world.

most countries LA use SpV, also appear list countries use something SpV. compare big numbers countries use vaccine, LA show groups. affect final difference much.

And consider total Administered Doses instead, Brazil Chile lead, 12M 6M (using someting SpV), vs 2M Argentina (SpV alone). Mexico, mix, 3M doses. [Here's got numbers feel you, frustrating. live WA state rollout feeling chaotic overly complicated, property AK. I'm considering flying getting AK ID get shot. Flights cheap could stay friends.

Huh? Wow. Disappointing. I‚Äôm moving Finland three weeks. I‚Äôm coming city that‚Äôs literally locked city. leaving city Friday pick Finnish residence permit embassy, need Covid test get back in. comes back positive, literally allowed come back home. 

So terror Finland worse terror here. 

I really hope don‚Äôt anything mess residence permit.

Canada used domestic vaccine production previous governments eliminated totally helpless. states reserving J&amp;J special circumstances. example community clinics, door door vaccinations, certain essential worker groups.

Here PA teachers get J&amp;J (and J&amp;J) unless qualify immunocompromised group (and get Pfizer Moderna). State start administering J&amp;J think 9th got things order.

There's ban selling beer 472ml cans, companies still it. considered de facto ban. We've seen many countries praised months mask compliance still see huge spikes.

...Investigators later found victims glasses inside vehicle. Interesting. I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs evidence disorders put someone higher risk COVID severity death, I‚Äôm gonna guess he‚Äôs bullshitting people around and/or himself.

But, disorders probably indirectly increases risk. someone ADHD, I‚Äôm always fascinated reading much likelier worse outcomes with, like, everything. ADHD correlates obesity, substance abuse, lower educational/socioeconomic status (relative social class someone born into), arrested/incarcerated, victim crime, lower life expectancy overall, etc.

So, he‚Äôs someone has, like, severe ADHD depression results really shitty physical health (for example, he‚Äôs morbidly obese due ADHD-fueled binge eating, poorly managed diabetes result obesity depression-fueled apathy reduces compliance treatment), sure, mental illnesses (depression/anxiety) neurodevelopmental disorder (ADHD) certainly increasing risk, albeit indirectly.

BUT, key thing remember that, situation like example gave, DIRECT causes increased risk (the physical conditions, obesity diabetes) already accounted government‚Äôs ranking system (depends state, mine counts obesity everywhere does). opinion, it‚Äôs pretty disingenuous person claim ADHD, etc. makes higher COVID risk, UNLESS mental condition(s) caused causing physical condition(s) directly increasing risk - case, eligibility based physical condition(s). mandatory take it, smart What? way.

I belong support group amazing well meaning, compassionate people struggle every day mental illness still find way decent people. agree surprising, data backs up. Mutations weird thing - random happenstance, whatever reason one areas US lucky far.

The US weird open-but-not-really state entirety last year. populous places, mobility never really got back pre-COVID levels all, many people determined everpresent threat national failure full strategy mitigation. ongoing maintenance social distancing masking large parts population - even universal - likely helped keep new variants spreading aggressively.

Meanwhile, UK much Europe fully reopened, created several months largely unmitigated spread people encouraged freely dine restaurants precautions largely ignored. time scale problem became apparent, late put horse back barn...

Remember, US's peak, infections per day per 100k people hovering right around 70, happened briefly days. UK spent quite bit time ~90 range; definitely experienced worse outbreak longer US winter, even though tragic locations.

Make mistake, variants coming US. time factor US data J&amp;J. goal effectively limit spread much possible, quickly possible.

Yes, Trudeau already Canada gets vaccinated, vaccines necessary, absolutely sharing world,‚Äù said Trudeau interview CTV‚Äôs Question Period host Evan Solomon. funniest thing I'll never get tired repeating myself. Corporate bullshit!

Western vaccines produced big farma facilities great deal commercial secret. Remember, reality Russian vaccine developed public institute, tons scientists access anything vaccine related mass production.

They simply outsource production 3rd world countries, effectively making vaccine, large scale SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper region too. Canada currently several months behind US.

But see people resort personal attacks insults, bother. shows discussing good faith, unable explain defend position. countries learning difference affordability domestic vaccine manufacturing capability. example, India‚Äôs wealthy Japan, vaccine manufacturing (and version vaccine diplomacy). Vaccine row: EU exported 34m doses ‚Äì including 9m UK you‚Äôre talking Merck deal, it‚Äôs Merck doesn‚Äôt facilities manufacture mRNA, manufacture viral vector vaccines. Except next available appointments Javits May. isn‚Äôt Africa, Central America South America list???  Don‚Äôt worry seeing 40k rangers game  Apparently production capacities big right now, every day hear another country agreeing produce vaccine, they're increasing capacities lot. However, takes couple months new sites export vaccines. Still good news, right shipments big. Yeah Indian health services got shit ton vaccines. That‚Äôs Alaska high May. Seriously, wait vaccines available everyone, talk lifting restrictions. Oh ways! Haven‚Äôt heard of
EU model called ‚Äúno vaccines available strict lockdowns zero covid acceptable‚Äù strategy? time, authorities saying everything would fine washed hands elbow bumps. India‚Äôs great choice, domestic vaccine manufacturing form vaccine diplomacy. Quit scared then. exports EU, none UK. exports EU UK, making UK net importer. EU bad? texASS! what. Like..whut? jackass kind. human normalized, praised. would company director vote something enriches expense company, mean?

Stop imagining corporations feel pain find lot things make sense. horrible arm pain doses Moderna! 3 days pain first dose 1 day second dose (but much intense). got lot relief alternating heat ice packs taking combined ibuprofen Tylenol every 8 hours. think it‚Äôs hating political party specifically one leader rather US whole. Biden guy seems nice Nope, fact, Israeli data showed decrease protection first week, probably people less careful precautions. tapped Starbucks advise aid state revving distribution pharmacies/hospitals/whoever giving shot gets vaccine quicker arrives state. Also partnering Microsoft improve technology flow behind Costco aid vaccination year. point haven‚Äôt adjusted life dealing virus, it‚Äôs face consequences, others.

Selfish. function daily basis? guessing weren‚Äôt class valedictorian. fact guessing ate one many paint chips child.

Ah, resorting personal attacks always sign argument strong basis^\s. I‚Äôll settle jolly old England it‚Äôs fucking nice Well bad EU lack vaccines take long time us get gonna wait. gotta eat you‚Äôre scared, stay home. 

Nice logic. surprising though. lineups? bottleneck? Creative! Ok sound bad, (and little cool time) find comforting vaccine one, work, given out, produced, see end here. 

In past like end one knew answer going happen. knowing driving insane.

It gets better here. Everyday people getting vaxed. day passes, immunity world go covid numbers go down. week newspapers headlines better, week see signs normal returning. thoughts CA low vaccination numbers last days? Let count confirm, oh wait one count. Well aren‚Äôt EU (obviously) governments basically slowly privatized vaccine industry last 40 years don‚Äôt much domestic production. Plus invested lot time/money deal China surprise surprise fell like day 2. Overall we‚Äôre ok though. American machine pharma also didn‚Äôt near amount deaths provinces openly defying federa guidelines agree. never said JnJ bad vaccine. good definitely crucial fighting pandemic. 

I venting one dose vaccine wanted explain actually means vaccines definitely provide protection, precisely use two doses. Amazon actually partnering Virginia Medical (a hospital system here) set vaccine sites Amazon's empty HQ. extremely efficient. first shot site took less 15 minutes getting car getting needle arm  drive Anchorage work every day vaccine?  Schools opened up, bars restaurants opened up, concerts events authorized 500 people weddings 300. cases still falling.

Now 50% new cases among 0-19 demographic, mostly among kids schools. Can't really curb spread among unvaccinated kids crammed 30-40 pupils per class. Damn US literally bases every fucking real? believe numbers. many conspiracy theorists, religious lunatics science deneyers actually third population want vaccination. Nope. biggest one? one forgot. C'mon, know there. Take guess. 

A hint: e l e v e n Oh, right, right. highest efficacy overall - 95.6%. bad. things:

1. way 800k infected went undetected. Israel tests per capita world. testing extremely aggressive targeted.
2. Adding 0.7 total sensible though, mostly vaccinate previously confirmed COVID.
3. 50% population 2 weeks 1st dose, 38.5% actually fully protected now. That's big difference.

Some areas definitely experiencing herd immunity, need understand vaccination rate uniform across nation demographics. Kids can't vaccinated, schools fully open person, there's lot spread there. 50% new cases Israel people 20, many 16. Without vaccine, there's way we'll get herd immunity schools catch eventually.

Second problematic demographic Arabs exhibit significant anti vaxx sentiment, 45% new severe cases among Arabs, towns, cities villages largely significantly lower vaccination rate 27% week 2cond dose recovered, compared 52% non Ultraorthodox/ non Arab demographic. royals 10k cap much attendance cap. 

I'm glad around 2015 Fuck idiotic federal government. Chinese vaccines poor quality straight-up fraudulent. people get Chinese 'vaccine' truly inoculated disease counterproductive goal eradicating least managing spread covid. Well, data prove one us right coming months. Let's see. made it.

True, F chat didn't. That's great hear. parents live opposite coasts country missed Xmas together first time year. three us currently first dose vaccine, we've already planned trip see one another soon we're fully vaccinated - I'm excited! you‚Äôre scared, stay home. rest us living. boy dream mixture everything. Two MD friends got pfizer, another got cansino (trial), parents got 1st dose pfizer last Saturday, today municipality Sinovac.

Edit. saw news shipment russian ones arrived. I'm still predicting herd immunity end July. betting man, that's I'd expect federal guidelines start easing. Pretty dumb idea considering every one countries enough vaccinate already issues China. way Australia NZ planning vaccinate pacific neighbours, vaccinate Americas countries can't afford themselves. China knows future supporting African Pacific development, targeting think Japan would agree? diseases deadly people get them, I'd assume. This... contrary scientists, CDC, etc. say. behavior safely change you‚Äôre vaccinated, that‚Äôs kind point. What‚Äôs conservative governments absolutely shit scum? Definitely trend anything, lmao.

Pakistanis skeptical vaccines US used vaccination program OBL recon. Seems like reaction clotting cases relate batch vaccine. I'd understand suspending use batch reassurance gained it, suspend use vaccine entirely strange. even mean? ""the EU"" even this?

This basic caution. get unforeseen adverse reactions, stop batch investigate, go back normal. Also Danish government, EU. level misinformation low-effort posts sub appalling. That‚Äôs heard too, export EU vaccines stopped, it‚Äôs fair think medicine component shipped US get export license request granted. US export ban place since day 1. doses administered Europe produced Europe, including J&amp;J. Nothing new really... don‚Äôt wait long, happen 2 months Little bit behind curve here, Michel write? give moneyz. vaccines. sanduches. forget sanduches! US blocking movement vaccines US Canada even though Canada purchase orders companies US Worldometer reported 2,000 deaths yesterday, dump backlogged deaths, right? That's 3,000 normalized US population. approve AZ doubts manufacturers actually make thing understanding,

No, FDA approved AZ vaccine submitted US trial finished. FDA accepts US trial data. Yet 10m uses AZ vaccine UK recorded blood clot issues?

Something right here. 65-year-old man India collapsed passed away five minutes getting first dose vaccine covid-19. injected 0.5 ml dose Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine (source: Times India) source would like share us? Quick google search indicates Pakistan like rest world imports medicines India regular basis. FDA likely able access PHE data UK's rollout see safe vaccine is, however also possible USA looking increased pace Pfizer's rollout deciding vaccinate US population Pfizer's vaccine use pile AZ 'vaccine diplomacy'.

And yes test batches sending next stage process, however also great pressure meet delivery targets point probably accepted point perfect unacceptable (i.e. imperfection batch). Although love EU passion, things wrong caution. vaccine given certainly quantifiably lead severe cases deaths, good cost-benefit analysis decision like this. closer mid May, simply based expected vaccine deliveries. Fill&amp;finish happen several locations, EU. Every time consider moving LA DFW, crap like talks it.

I'll take overpriced life, thank much. provinces enough vaccine hand get every adult first dose mid-may. Yes Biontech affected export without meeting contract targets. case banned exporting it‚Äôs worth, PHU (in ontario) opened vaccine registration anyone 60, anyone working public, anyone comorbidity, like obesity diabetes. partner teacher registered last night. said potentially. Go get shot, AZ effective better vaccine all. Let fix headline;
Federal officials don‚Äôt give fuck old people get sick, long they‚Äôre retired politicians stupid rich Alright thanks clearing up. know FDA handle doubts? Isn‚Äôt possible test batches administering them? seen highest daily coronavirus death toll yet, number people dying virus single day surpassing 2000 first time. Last week, Mr Bolsanora told Brazilians ‚Äústop whining‚Äù coronavirus, criticising restrictions used curb spread virus. Wednesday, former leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva criticised Mr Bolsonaro, calling decisions made throughout pandemic ""stupid"". [The website Dr. wasted, since updated site people hard time finding spots You‚Äôre mistaken, Pfizer included European Union introduced tighter rules exports COVID-19 vaccines could hit shipments nations including Australia, amid deepening dispute drug manufacturers Pfizer AstraZeneca supplies potentially lifesaving Federal Government said would take steps ensure Australia received 1.2 million doses AstraZeneca vaccine order Europe despite imposed export controls. 22 blood clots 3 million vaccinated. 
I live city 3 million people, thombosis clinic usually send patients definitely get 22 referrals every single day. insignificant number population size, especially majority probably older health conditions.

""Up March 9, 22 people reported blood clots vaccination AstraZeneca drug. total three million inhabitants already vaccinated vaccine."" anyone know USA plans provide vaccines territories? not, first area get surplus would shame someone

*Got rid border* One candidate offered vaccinate starting November offers 9 million vaccines first 100 days hasn‚Äôt explained how, since starting negotiate hasn‚Äôt secured vaccines (since he‚Äôs candidate).
Regardless ends winning, we‚Äôre looking one slowest vaccination programs region thanks current administration. Vaccine distribution working though? issue lack doses, lack distribution infrastructure. another year this. Wait US/UK done sending spare vaccines third world countries Europe still locked down. hurt. AZ seems issue side effects. Looking numbers Sweden. 3281 reports side effects 85 000 vaccinated. Pfizer 3929 reports 443 000 vaccinated. Moderna 466 reports 40 000 vaccinated. surveillance detention 

Probably best choice words... % per year % in.. 2 months? nothing bad cross checking oversight gem. guys saying year. move goalposts every single time. places, required. give numbers Germany, reported 2018 150 cases thrombosis per 100'000 people. That's 1500 cases per million per year. 

So let's take 3 million people one month expect (1500 x 3 / 12) 375 cases thrombosis.

So AZ cases absolutly random bad luck victims.

Keep mind though Germany reports EVERY case thrombosis, fatal ones news stating (at least denmark) victim seems sustained multiple bloodclots typical single one. citizens fucking assholes past year

no, people shitty reddit rubbing hands prospect 400,000,000 people spend months lockdown weird online nationalism. Log fuck off. live city 3 million people, thombosis clinic usually send patients definitely get 22 referrals every single day. insignificant number population size, especially majority probably older health conditions. Chinese deal collapsed Canada honoured USA extradition Chinese political prisoners, China became angry sided USA. USA shut us domestically produced vaccines. (And won‚Äôt talk rerouting planes carrying PPE overseas spring, disgusting) good faith ally Europe.

Kind expecting Australian adults getting AZ followed mRNA (Pfizer) booster. UK trial results coming June 2nd doses start becoming due. We're producing AZ Australia govt also ordered enough Pfizer adults get dose. think combo strategy depend availability Pfizer. local gym require it, yes. required whatever want. 22 3 million seems lower general population. Although hate EU passion, there's nothing wrong caution.

Cant wait readily available everybody.  Lmao USA bad Canada can‚Äôt get vaccines, partly USA won‚Äôt release (especially moderna). Maybe USA done, finally let Canada vaccines ordered. think quote saying, ""higher level asymptomatic infection"" reasonable results vaccination, infections reduced asymptomatic vaccines. ""higher asymptomatic transmission"" different thing reasonable result vaccination. friend who's ICU doc got vaccine 3 weeks ago 40 degree fever 3 days go paracetamol. feel like one week later. healthy guy mid 30's says never felt bad vaccination before. agree, US national interest can. EU constantly going back forth, always disagreement worries optics. end day neither cake eating it. Remember spat AZ Ursula Von Der Leyen production slowed down. wanted vaccines meant delivered UK split sent EU make shortfall. Almost broke post brexit trade agreement order it.

Now think AZ definetly made shortfall EU giving original supply thr UK EU. Ursula's actions extreme made look like Britian Greedy. extent correct. actions made AZ looks terrible rest EU. Kind kicked AZ hate inside EU means way AZ vaccine put together involves growing large amounts different virus, growing phase individual plant, climate procedures (and well procedures adhered to). 

The whole problem AZ able deliver vaccines time less giving away people 'growing' process highly variable therefore much product supply may variable. not. EU just... even know anymore... getting tired shit. Well good thing dumb people like charge everywhere. Canada made agreement 6 months ago passing excess doses. global ‚Äúpool‚Äù every developed country already made commitments to, except USA. health unit Canada opened vaccine registration anyone phase 2, 60, anyone working public, anyone co morbidity (diabetes, obesity, immunocompromised, etc) Good thing is: find evidence transmission, sure make public, message ""we messed year ago, countries infect people even year time learn"". Pudong airport outbreak, even admitted adhering disinfection hygiene measures whole summer that. Still par said lol. aware things called contractual obligations, right? could always hoarde vaccines charge countries premium. I'll take bet able first dose July. Name price find reputable escrow. Dead serious, easiest money ill make year.  Congratulations Finally someone gets it. like guys read headline December refuse get new information. September projections include 2 4 approved vaccines.

 


It's really weird basically tell someone's political ""tribe"" based nonsense spew vaccine deliveries. here? Jaane de, bhai. firangiyon ke munh lag kar koi fayada nahin hai. good news think we're close 1/4 vaccinatable population, technically over. We're 18.4% total population, includes children people covid past three months, eligible. governments Europe tell us stay home next months poor vaccine rollout. Insane. I'm done that. Heh. Hmm wonder many Indians migrating called ‚Äòrapist western countries‚Äô.

I wonder countries looted colonized world centuries. get lol chip gives 5G said ‚Äúfull long term effects‚Äù, already know likely many, don‚Äôt know extent yet, fact already see tell getting vaccine better bet society. nice apology Mexico wall stuff. Read article. reached bat populations mutated? poor management healthcare infrastructure mishandling pandemic? Canada ordered 500 million doses, need buy more, need US let us get deliveries knowing enough, seems like Russia sacrifices citizens order get win though. pace vaccinating able produce enough internal use exports? 

Currently production look outpace domestic demand anyway. less recent news articles quoted government reports, cupule regions reported shortages likely logistics transporting storing vaccine. fact, big cities like Moscow Saint Petersburg vaccination points shopping malls - drop without scheduling appointment, clinics points seeing rush. Seems like majority people really wanted get vaccinated already got vaccinated January February (my friend recently went get injection sent picture empty hallway clinic). Really? I‚Äôve heard plenty people bitching ‚Äúorgan damage‚Äù apparently happens every single case support poor US getting control first. like lose cabin pressure airplane, put oxygen mask first help people. Shhh tell he's letting political ""team"" dictate thoughts. commenting EU exporting, companies based EU exporting, reminder common practice assign exports geographical/political entity. Eg, one would say, ""The biggest UK export cars"" long term effects COVID also unknown 100,000x likely worse, assuming anyone give lives infection first place. That‚Äôs idiotic. don‚Äôt 100% certainty long term effects vaccine, little reason assume based know vaccines epidemiology. Wtf knee surgery vaccine distribution? can't speak provinces, bc ready waiting could jabbing 10x people per day. plans mass vax sites, we're literally waiting doses. Vaccinations picking greatly, yet number cases completely stalled, barely decreasing.

The true Isreal almost everyone vaccinated. seems following COVID-safe procedures important vaccination, state beginning stop open up, things stall out, get better time soon. I'm wondering news? vaccine trials already confirmed this. No. People already adjusted life want avoid virus. Wanting go back normal thing requiring people change normal state.

The order magnitude Pfizer missed targets even close AstraZeneca.

And end, Pfizer managed catch goals eventually overdeliver Q1.

While AstraZeneca trouble meeting lowered goals Q1, might even able meet Q2 delivery goals. end, AstraZeneca delivered 220 million doses EU end Q2 instead 300 million optimistic scenario, 130 million pessimistic scenario. public trust AZ even reduced

Their approach totally meant stengthen public's confidence vaccine... /s Yes. Congrats! Virginia BMI 25+, easily healthy tall person goes gym.

Fuck felonious tool except Russian one, working getting well. second dose matters. 

For American citizens coming Canada/Mexico 2 doses much concern. Canadians Mexicans going U.S. partially vaccinated may depending governments point view. Canadian government even figured guidelines partially vaccinated people. US figured guidelines fully vaccinated people. Oh, know.

I figure new way getting exercise since gyms closed. recalled resistance bands had, started taking walks. got familiar exercises using bands, still now. lucky break failed secure band went flying forehead, leaving gash. Good thing missed eyes. (I limit kinds movements now, wear eye protection risk).

I took picking coffee, first times week, gradually every day. thing feel connected. order fast, out. Getting Starbucks would order online. Lower risk way.

I figure work home. already worked home, good part time home coffeeshops libraries coworking sessions. tried using storeroom parents renting decades. poor wireless access, bathrooms, polarized power plugs. really, good space use lengthy period.

I sunk lengthy periods MMO playing. Planetside 2 became familiar friend would sometimes go night playing.

By summer embraced using outdoors more, sitting park grass. got dirt jeans? priorities gradually shifting. tried organize home storeroom, tossing things, also buying things. Retail therapy. Gradually developed principled approach found really. created space thing, kind division, like binder, tray box, automatically organized pile, became project itself. upgraded ergonomics working home, got wireless gear monitor arm lap desk. Floor sitting fully supinated became two common postures mousing switched trackball trackpad.

And wildfires came could stick rhythm daily walks, 150 AQI. stay inside sweat humid air. intense trying period. would pace, burpees. Anything keep collapsed chair staring screen long.

By wintertime lost summer habits many smoky days. cold, hard stick bands training.

As year wore journaling, thought, one cold days, could record journal phone. months later committed regular self talk walks, recording needed. let deal many issues, vocally letting out. gave release cluttered mind.

I developed deep expertise simulation pinball, even worked making one own. pandemic became opportunity bring niche skill great level. let really slow once, before, relax, loosen grip, shift things, new projects, principles. many new projects now, social bonds shifted little, mediated irritating voice calls text chats.

Mexico‚Äôs border open Americans whole time though Yeah no, contract UK export UK gets x million doses. UK supply chain fully working problem use factory EU last manufacturing step. Yeah nobody expected it....

It‚Äôs going sad day global warming same. get sick infected, first dose vaccine generated enough antibodies avoid hospitalization elderly, two needed oxygen. According doctors preventive nothing serious worry about. 52 people living/working facility, 51 got infected, one didn‚Äôt got virus before.

You‚Äôre also right didn‚Äôt get second dose yet, perspective makes vaccine even better. writing article, getting second doses finishing quarantine. Basically avoided whole bunch hospitalizations region country known lack health facilities due isolation. live region resources healthcare network aren‚Äôt close good tolerate pressure. whatever save lives. course Chile near developed countries healthcare, it‚Äôs extreme third world countries. we‚Äôre still big country sparse population makes accomplishments noteworthy.

[Here‚Äôs source case wanna read faster clearances, mean want side step regulation put regulatory authority? regulations say bridging study test safety efficacy vaccine Indian population. established Pfizer vaccine safe efficacious could granted emergency authorization. 

It's Astrazeneca vaccine, yet got clearance fda. Since vaccine finished trials produced data safety efficacy data granted authorization US. Yes apparently Office National Statistics using method inflates deaths try make Boris look bad something. point gave up. Solidarity never good look, especially among bigots. last year made trust government even less, made realize gullible masses are, shown powerful media is. Unreliable PCR tests generously listing covid cause death massively inflated numbers, far many people trust TV says rather what's happening eyes.

I know I'll downvoted oblivion let's see comment gets banned sub üòÇ End September (which still bad compared US/UK)... Iff everything goes perfectly plan. far, literally nothing gone plan. things suddenly going change? It‚Äôs thing fast tests. talk grand plans appointment dumb dumber charge things. Now, doctors offices don‚Äôt tests offer people supermarkets bought them. actually going able get one free test week? I‚Äôm holding breath. 

Also ‚Äúbe offered‚Äù means ""given appointment."" word appointment be; could well 2022. Plus Germany there‚Äôs election coming up. party currently power supported exclusively old people, say ‚Äúeveryone,‚Äù mean voters. priority groups may given vaccine end September, everyone age 60 probably get appointment like March 2022 months nickel dime pharmaceutical companies. What's real weird I'm pretty sure local high school town continued bringing students in, mask rules applied. honestly clue what's that, brother goes school there, online class. Yup, point accurate number ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt taking Bill Gates microchip vaccine! government tracking it!‚Äù

‚ÄúBiden using tax money send vaccines countries?!? ain‚Äôt president, America!‚Äù

They don‚Äôt want it, don‚Äôt want anyone else either. Children. resource dashboard indicates many various vaccine types (Moderna, Pfizer / BioNTech, Oxford / AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson) delivered various states US?

It would really interesting see breakdown, I'm troubles finding it. wear mask gym vaccines? I‚Äôve actually proper gym like, year. Idk works. tried lifting mask shit, anyway, it‚Äôs awful lol. rest world needs vaccines well?

I understand solidarity difficult concept grasp people. I'm sure manage try really hard. covid vaccines approved FDA? ‚Äúemergency‚Äù use. bit alarming people FDA approved? 0%, significantly so, concerning bit. one demonized Oxford vaccine. issue people wanting vaccinate, issue enough vaccines. that's EU wanted create fair distribution among members. Instead opening bidding war would've rich countries, resulting higher vaccine prices everyone little vaccines left small/poorer countries union. 
Full list updated info link above

 Phase 1 High-risk populations 
(approximately 1.8 million people)

**December 2020¬†‚Äì March 2021**

* Congregate living seniors
* Health care workers
* Adults First Nations, M√©tis Inuit populations
* Adult chronic home care recipients
* Adults 80 years old 


 

### Phase 2Mass deliveries vaccines(approximately 9 million people)

**April 2021¬†‚Äì July 2021**

* Adults aged 60-79, 5-year increments
* High-risk congregate settings (such shelters, community living)
* Individuals high-risk chronic conditions caregivers
* cannot work home
* At-risk populations 


 

### Phase 3Steady stateJuly 2021 onwards

* Adults 59 years younger Eastern Europe one country. among highest per capita vaccinations rates world barely started.. Australians aren‚Äôt travelling anywhere won‚Äôt vaccinated. even then, won‚Äôt bringing Covid us. *get* though. You‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs happened Australia....Australia secured plenty Hopefully Brazilian president gives go-ahead receives offer. You‚Äôll sooner get shit Russia, I‚Äôm afraid! What? Fuck that. want vacation Europe summer. next. mean, I‚Äôve Disneyland. It‚Äôs almost open air outside. Outrage theme parks usually moral outrage scientific one, like beach drama last year. Well, placed lot trust Sanofi produced poor vaccine candidate. vaccines gets harder recruit volunteers clinical trial test placebo.

There deal least 300 million doses EU Sanofi. time, Moderna, AstraZeneca Pfizer successful sold mostly outside EU. People die bizarre unclear reasons time, hear them. Money nothing. Vaccines generally cheap even low income countries. need actual stuff AZ failing provide enough vaccines even EU internal needs, developing countries need look sources. providing significant amount vaccines developing countries Chinese, followed Russians Indians. 

To fair, Pfizer done best fulfill contracts around world, 1) expensive 2) hard distribute 3) available sufficient amounts.  like mathematical impossibility

Because run wrong equations. asked chance one healthy woman dying days vaccine clear reason? Wrong question. question chance millions healthy people vaccinated die within days getting vaccine. 


The answer former unlikely, answer latter extremely likely. I‚Äôm sorry hear that. guess kind accepted someone would hate either way it‚Äôs life I‚Äôm choosing I‚Äôm willing willing compromise on. Willing: hanging less acquaintances, dining out, travel, masking

Unwilling: leaving house shop, maintain much possible normalcy  Thanks Bill Gates. I've forecasting weeks now: Phase 2 ""any adult get it, please set appointment"" public health agency, pharmacy, HEB you.

then Phase 3 ""no appointment needed, drop CVS time they're open"". similar things work flu shots

Now terms Phase 2 rev up, IDK sure. hunch would be, early summer, Phase 3 mid-to-late summer selfish. Respecting trade deals. Diplomacy. Nope ... esteemed Governor idiot! Open 100$ masks week Spring Break. dumb! I'm sure argue patents issue meet demands also donate surplus beyond that. I'm sure argue patents issue meet demands also donate surplus beyond that.

I think missing reason India's request. unable supply vaccines want supply different vaccines like mRNA also developing nations. two different things. autopsy find signs indicative vaccine injury, enough label death caused vaccine, people die circumstances start gather data whether could consequence vaccines. getting arms yet numbers right line second larger two main peaks nations have. burns next month case number start collapsing like UK US. Germany well initially. got million shot AstraZeneca don‚Äôt want use. guess everybody wants Pfizer. 

Maybe arrange quick trip US summer. Canada already enough population give June 3/4 America vaccinated rate... Please start Canada, really want canadian teams start playing US again. That's literally definition surplus order needed instead?  Good. Better option maybe need need it.

One key factors vaccine kids suppose, unless large proportion adult population vaccinated Land border. Anyone fly across either direction. I‚Äôve done multiple times. third choice practically relevant anywhere outside minarchistic theorizing. Currently, whatever specific issue may be, policy decision deal made government.

I claim people believe government function beyond military police, say small percentage population compared typical ""small-government"" conservative, who, fundamental level, endorses current system. current system given, decision mandated mask use made government, whether local one, state-level one, federal one. And, case, typical small-government perspective, would appear allowing local governments make decision would best. I‚Äôm MN too. wonder it‚Äôs many places get vaccine now. Dad got first shot Hy-Vee places. love think everyone simply avoid contact others. It‚Äôs like don‚Äôt even live real world.

It might simple, neither adjusting life prevent spreading virus. means government make laws. Anarchy is. laugh riot. logic beautiful.

There plenty laws don‚Äôt favor one person‚Äôs beliefs another. honest stop making fallacies. B might completely happy job feel comfortable there.

So what‚Äôs issue? It‚Äôs government‚Äôs job decide gets happy comfortable. working important. need that. don‚Äôt need people attend baseball games max capacity. 

People employed others attending baseball games right? working longer important guys whole fear thing. fear. logical conclusion determining interactions important not. need keep interactions minimum, keep well distanced order keep spread minimum. saves lives. 

Sounds like fear me. Fear logical conclusion. also cause illogical conclusion. going consider lives saved people getting enjoy? everyone lock multiple years survive. packed baseball game important. baseball team going under. fine partial capacity proper distancing.

Didn‚Äôt previously say proper distancing can‚Äôt completely prevent spread? so, amount risk ok? What‚Äôs acceptable risk level you? think get decide acceptable risk level severe example seen yet person starts want creates reality around it. don‚Äôt start logical premise go logical conclusion. start conclusion want. fit insane ideas think supports don‚Äôt even mental capacity realize none works. amazing reading logic this.

So want? easy question answer right? someone completed advanced degrees done lots studies one fascinating specimens come across. literally like watching sun rise West. can‚Äôt believe eyes, none makes damn sense. Yet look away.

Its lower California, relatively well compared states lockdowns like NY. 

[They're necessarily well think arebut they're top 5 affected states Canada already paid enough, extra donated anyways.

It's giving Canada free vaccines, accelerating Canada's timeline, currently way behind developed world number reasons. I'm positive well everything going solved weeks, yes, j&amp;j doses probably available April. 

I talking public trust perspective, new approval may share news az's stop, instead monopolizing everything days coming goes Biden again, leftist agenda. selling leftovers make 1.9 trillion wasted helping Americans - Republicans probably remember day lockdown declared Spain, heard news I'd come straight work driving class, saw hundreds people pushing trolleys filled food, etc. streets.

It crazy, one things never forget.

I happy comply first lockdown, really lost lot optimism end last year. take holiday stuck home, unable visit family even Christmas. seen wife year since working abroad started, we'd planned move US together lost job too. nightmare loss family members too.

I can't stand cost lockdowns travel restrictions completely ignored, goalposts moved flattening curve, waiting vaccine, zero covid cases. time open things let people make decisions. expect additional booster shots reformulations optimized variants. Actually US producer vaccines 0% export policy. EU, China Russia export. purchase surplus leaving additional supply nations buy need instead US tax payers subsidizing nations vaccines?

Still waiting numbers main AZ contract (dependent US allows since AZ supply comes them), J&amp;J, eventually Novavax.

Initial estimates 3 could provide 20M additional doses end June, would end 56.5M doses end June. order vaccinate every Canadians adult, need 62M doses, extra 5.5M could easily come July maybe earlier depending US export ban situations guys barely even cases. US hell year. vast majority us haven‚Äôt even vaccinated. world constantly hands us help despite country often worse position. Many us don‚Äôt even good access healthcare general.

Italy, 7 days ago denied export 250 thousand vaccines Australia. 

Please read article confirmation deleting mods.

The EU looking own, expected, don‚Äôt try sugar coat it.

AZ contracts many countries. EU allow export distribution vaccines unless it‚Äôs quotas met. countries quotas AZ? EU says don‚Äôt matter.

What mean practice? countries extended delays shipments vaccine. 

Australia barely vaccinated anyone. Someone cited Belgium ‚Äúonly‚Äù 7% vaccinated reason, Australia lower it‚Äôs barely started.

So call spade spade. EU looking first, it‚Äôs expected. don‚Äôt pretend somehow morally superior. 

The EU still buys gas Russia signed last minute investment deal China. despite EU always proclaiming moral superiority regarding human rights democracy. two countries abuse human rights unprecedented scale. 

My point EU what‚Äôs interest first. Janssen Italy stated news delays inaccurate plan provide clearer schedule later month. Dry ice sublimates couple days. That‚Äôs shipping solution storage one. reason many focus Pfizer rather Moderna well? expect similar results since tech similar? Solid cancer survivor here, still monitoring I'm less year surgical removal. I'm wondering currently signs recurrence (tumor markers came back yesterday negative 9-month visit) solid cancer numbers would experiencing. Thing is, chemo radiation treatment, surgical removal. I've also first Pfizer dose already (US). worrying study around. need break side effects label problem. There's name missing list... Clots natural infection assuredly coming absolute destruction vascular endothelial layer virial infection, spike interactions. point vaccine programs grinding halt investigate unrelated health issue that's occurring normal levels anyway? 
 
That seems like pretty relevant topic. Apparently India bots Whether first second vaccine hurt depends exposed virus already not. Broadly, yes, but:

1. Vaccinating everyone quicker safer society large reduces spread; 
2. addition vaccine, instead even opposition it.  I‚Äôm still waiting gone Easter...of last year. vaccinated something like 10% population. STFU ridiculous shaming. aren‚Äôt hoarding... don‚Äôt enough. ‚ÄòHoarding‚Äô what‚Äôs happening here. especially slap face 1c group include service workers (unless 50 listed comorbitities.) Obviously sad, vaccine 100% effective.

Still, days confirmed positive Monday death Thursday short cycle.

Even allow 10-day incubation period, means infected 2-3 weeks vaccinated, although protection maximum level, still surprising case serious even allowing possibility vaccine *always* work.  pretty severe headaches FIVE DAYS first one, husband little arm pain, yeah 
 looking forward second one missed one many people seem miss. COVID-19 way back year ago (seems like forever) originally labeled - novel coronavirus. labeled way novel virus human population. one infected and, thus, human population never developed immunity either antibodies T-Cells (we debate much cross-over immunity exists people infections coronaviruses). people infected spread without stop gaps previously infected people transmit virus. Think fire breaks forest fire. fire breaks prevent spread forest fire rest forest. Immunity infected stop infections infected.

Now, COVID-19 comes around population already seen it, harder time moving around population. people still varying levels immunity stronger weaker others, people might still antibodies people T-cell protection, people cross immunity.

Doesn't mean people get infected or, maybe even, re-infected (much like people get colds family coronaviruses impact person different). But, impact much smaller societal view individuals might feel brunt likely suffer much couple days weather.

tl;dr: doubt COVID infect people next winter become endemic ""surge."" Yep puts things perspective. many hundreds die everything grinds halt one blood-clot death? can't stand sort attitude medicine.  

""Doesn't matter many die, long can't possible linked single issue circumstances. people die actual disease waiting cares? problem"" haha still go 40 130 got wearing KN95. I'm believer. True, DC, similar population size (and literally big city) still tiers. Check per capita noted another user, 142K people Denmark vaccinated AZ. also worth noting almost reported cases negative side effects minor greater concern, like soreness arm feeling bit unwell short period getting shot. *All* reports potentially significant side effects reviewed detail determine they're related vaccination.

There cases involving relatively young people (i.e., nursing home residents others age group) without known health concerns serious side effects (blood clots) getting AZ vaccine. One those, 60 year old Danish woman, died. shot AZ batch Austrian cases. may well complete coincidence entirely unrelated vaccination, they're playing safe want check continuing. rates blood cancer protection even worse imagined. stats publications assume certain level health it‚Äôs essential learn vaccine response atypical bodies. blood cancer survivor shield due complications, people like didn‚Äôt enough movement included vaccine trials.

But yeah sucks ordering vaccines playing publicity game. EU western entity actually exports vaccines exported tens millions. Yet blocks one shipment gets shot without mercy. UK US exported single batch praised policies. Austria nurse dies blood clot too. afraid lockdown.

I see whats wrong China gaining regional influnce whose western country thousands miles away trying exploit local western people like slap totalitarian label country dont understand. Problem - a) must quarantine 10 days upon return, b) gotta fly twice (unless J&amp;J vaccine becomes available) c) $$$ fly, Im rich. thanks! Yes know antivax population? That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. reopen borders cases go people don‚Äôt want vaccinate. IHS Alaska vaccinated hospital employees, elders small communities (because get sick need emergent care village, you‚Äôre kinda luck, *especially* winter) opened vaccines native person, non native household members native person, household members employees, finally anyone Alaska resident week state opened eligibility everyone.

I fall category household member native person, got vaccine last week January. 

IHS gone beyond here. They‚Äôve done amazing job, didn‚Äôt give me, anyone else native vaccine, did. I‚Äôm forever thankful. NZ specifically ordered enough cover pacific island neighbours understand. Good job kiwi bros! pack vaccine dry ice... explained not, Britain responsible exporting anything. really think point ignoring facts keep blaming UK instead EC fucked up. Numbers don‚Äôt take 3 months fall. Look far already fell UK. time herd immunity reached, numbers already incredibly low. straight taxes house insurance lol Small volume low risk someone without septal heart defect potential right left shunt... I'd consider definition small context patient size. neonate septal defect would highest risk would also receiving vaccine. ever talk someone lived Polio still circulating? grandpa stories stay home outbreak occurred town... part problem ""listen science matter what"" mantra we've leaned into.

I get it, last administration care science need listen, science can't make public policy alone.


The point science situation reactionary, conservative estimates, take slow get right......however thats people live, think, positioned economy. Policy needs based answers, needs give people guidance, way plan.

That's date like useful, allows people plan bit. conservative date? Probably, think unlikely USA still functionally acts like pandemic summer, still guidance. Oh part people messed measurements! :P yeah liked PLM, RO crapfest 12 hours got shot. said that, pretty important detail.

I actually worked five hours getting shot, making comments feel anything all. personally never laughed it- clear highly contagious disease put elderly immune compromised people risk leaving die would bad choice- definitely thought people overreacting needed chill out. 

i guess kind overreacting initially hit US (did country really need hoard toilet paper canned spinach?), evolved i've ended concerned pretty much everyone around me, even though basically try follow recommendations CDC organizations (WHO etc; better go consensus one organization). 

this pandemic good anxiety, social, mental health standpoint, given constantly mind try avoid transmitting now. 1000%. remember test shamers back day too. know that, mods cracking ""political"" comments. injecting air blood supply kill ???

I always told dust people compressed air force air blood stream via small cuts kill reaches heart. lol want anyway Memorial Day, we'll pretty close. lot people, it'll normal (everyone different definition). July 4, there'll questions normalcy Jesus christ. Bad news follows vaccine.

You can't ignore young-ish people dropping dead. Yea is. it‚Äôs data wasn‚Äôt showing wasn‚Äôt data people overly cautious spreading I‚Äôm boat you. First one yesterday, wish didn‚Äôt see headline. still get #2, definitely loving stuff like this.  problem. 

Appreciate support. AstraZeneca almost certainly started producing doses US order. wait approval production start.  expecting 50 million doses US available April. starting produce doses next month. looking use supply help EU. plant Canada contracted supply AZ AZ likely producing anticipation Canada's doses too, allowed ship out, is.

But beyond that. late April US possibly ready approve AZ, likely already ton vaccines freezer.  already producing much higher rate administering at.  So, even approval delivery, I'd suspect doses remain sitting stockpiled US freezers/fridges. looks like circular logic me. countries agreed show solidarity solidaric, agreed first place! think cause data rolling Israel using primarily Pfizer. I'm sure Moderna data come Give raise too. Essential workers need band together nationwide general strike bargain higher wages. really conservative Hasidic Jews shunning vax well preventative measures like masks social distancing many reasons. huge F*** PLM Kroger.

Private companies fully able mandate follow certain rules. discrimination tell order work follow certain dress code? No.

Emirates every right say either get vaccinated, pay tests. Emirates answers multiple countries, ensure going around spreading virus. That‚Äôd pretty disappointing tbh maybe whoever told decisions bad agenda. makes comfortable! I'm personally excited prospect going vacation ASAP. Get two vaccine doses time make lost year! One would hope. I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôll caught late June/ early July misquote Biden use excuse say failed.   positive trends news getting hard deny now. they're saying anything wrong though. means, they're right. understand y'all wanna open everything up, too! really 100% safe vaccines actually paid EU, paid individual member states.

Yes, will. Apparently J&amp;J process includes fill finish US, allowing Biden keep vaccines. Yes remember beginning lockdown vividly. (still am) resident physician surgical subspecialty half-way first year residency. child turned 1 year old week lockdown. 

Specifics remember first months:

\- February weird month. knew COVID entered country, one would wear PPE. remember thinking absurd wearing PPE hospital. happened n95 masks carpentry side jobs would wear one hospital. time, looked bad wear mask. would walk halls n95 one else wearing mask. nurses would yell tell take mask off. didn't. thought crazy.

\- sister super paranoid anyone thought to, bought n100 half-mask mailed - ""bless soul.""

\- wanted throw birthday party 1 year old decided safe given unknown spread virus time. one friend birthday. super low key, I'm glad made decision 

\- week, residency program announced ACGME Pandemic Response - pulled service COVID shifts ICU/Floors, elective surgical cases cancelled. remember shaking bed wife next night first COVID ICU shift thinking, ""Honey, want die."" 

\- wife child left day birthday go wife's parents isolate. stayed 1 month ICU shifts. wore n100 mask sister gave me. remember feeling like needed wear eye protection. find goggles anywhere face shields thing yet wore swimming goggles haha! looked like total idiot, hey, never got COVID, 0 regretzzz!

\- Grocery stores SOLD everything essential. cloth diapers toilet bowl diaper sprayer. remember feeling worried toilet paper bidet basically. 

\- hospitals started selling toilet paper, eggs milk food market. HAHA! roll cost like 89 cents. 

\- One co-residents got COVID died 2 weeks later. first time really hit close, like lost one comrads. really uncomfortable feeling. 

\- month COVID shifts getting sick, felt really confident paranoid PPE (with goggles half-mask, time valuable gold). wife kid came back life much better. saw child first time person month, looked much bigger different. broke heart much he'd changed month missed all. decided separate matter bad pandemic got. 

\- remember peak pandemic scrolling hospitals EMR. Literally every single room 5 different hospitals completely filled patients admitted ""COVID-19 Pneumonia"" ""Hypoxic Respiratory Failure related COVID-19 Pneumonia."" unreal scary. 

\- hospital ran ventilators patients intubated ER. ER resident friend told conversations family members asking permission withdraw care literally way sustaining life. 

\- next 2 months, ACGME Pandemic response continued surgical cases cancelled still. work COVID shifts, would random weeks nothing going on. best times I've since child. wife, kid lot traveling outdoor activities weeks off. working 70-80 hours week, many random weeks AMAZING! 

\- free time hands, worked lot, especially month wife kid gone. knew overweight risk factor serious COVID illness, pretty big motivator lose weight. 3 months lost 50 pounds! 

\- Every business planet giving discounts healthcare workers. stimulus checks, got much discounted shoes clothing. felt appreciated retail community. Honestly, no. think people like Fauci suffer delusions granduer genuinely think average person waiting pins needles see permit. I've year halfish, travel role, actually announced working home forever point. changes in.uper leadership due people retiring, new CEO bomb. Game Over. factored California 40 million people vaccinate government like starting cruise ship. Slow start make corrections huge is, move fast things consistent. problem vaccine supply issues constantly starts stops said ship. think percentage people happen able get vaccine, risk covid *and* need travel pretty small. Surely accommodations could made situation without need mandate staff whole company get vaccine? Right, production capacity means factories, development vaccine. results? Nah mate, countries didn‚Äôt woos lockdown ended needing 1 national lockdown result economy growing quicker didn‚Äôt first lockdown properly shove online, ‚Äúanyone Texas website‚Äù US contracts companies OWS clear doses produced US go US. 

Are they? far I'm aware contracts made public, making up. 

If were, point signing executive order first place? say, UK need put export ban place thanks contract AZ. ‚ÄúThe funding important contribution accelerate development expansion production capacity COVID 19 vaccine Germany,‚Äù said Ugur Sahin, CEO co-founder BioNTech. People afraid COVID, killing thousands rather dozens people every day. It‚Äôs irrational cancel AZ rare side effect. appreciate that. I've got tylenol ibuprofen hand actually, probably going take tomorrow anticipation. get shot 8pm tonight. onset specifically? anymore bit, miss though like travel paid hotel rooms perdiem  understand that. However, basically discrimination. I'm fully aware laws things different countries, there's legal side comes back bite company, that'd fault. Europe one last order vaccines, blocked exports well. sub become sane? accepted reality everyone else knew year ago? Haha, I‚Äôm opposite, nothing better Red Sox vs Yankees game full stand. setup beer food pretty short lines anyways.  realise literally google exactly goes right? That‚Äôs implied, it‚Äôs weird Moderna numbers even it‚Äôs fraction percent somehow manage reported lower start randomly saying ""demand weeks ago"" giant made-up personal anecdote stat? dude, already read full article understood fine (and answered request evidence quote)... think i‚Äôm reading deranged wall text you‚Äôre kidding yourself. much doses left Astrazeneca allowed export According contract. law... jesus people. Stop fearing facts.

Considering importing az doses india, would guess months still. uk make many doses. production nothing start could sacked done challenge trials we‚Äôd know hell lot mRNA vaccines seem highly effective infections. 94% precised. J&amp;J vaccine luxury. So, plenty virus mutations vaccines offer robust protection, instead give reason get hospitalized.  
It's already proven certain people covid factories virus replicates mutates within single body mutation established, infect others. 
The vaccine protect infection. J&amp;J good young healthy people. Theyre good older adults could possibly become virus factory developing new variant, worse, new strain. Well I'm passport holding US EU citizen know damn well entities operate. received first dose couple weeks ago next evening noticed heart racing palpitations. brief, happened nonetheless.

I believe actually known side effect (and honestly pretty tame one, even though jarring time) transient experienced. immune system ramping best. 

The second shot may intense body knows encounters mRNA, ride okay :-) concerns, contact PCP see experience patients side effects put mind rest. people travel though choice. suffer flight attendant antibacterial gets information Facebook? wouldn‚Äôt call testing efficacy red tape Meanwhile AZ delivers 10% promised doses EU.

Fuck this. I'll give UK US governments credit: vaccines ticket pandemic smart buy supplies. least 14 days second inoculation Pfizer vaccine, results anti-spike protein antibody test interpreted? in, values threshold test evaluated? tried searching online information able get clear results. anyone good sources order evaluate strong protection is?

Thanks! [Twitter shut ins strike people wanna stay locked basements bad ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Nothing statistically significant though. Moderna realistically effective Pfizer vaccine starting happen Chicago California already reopening, state government less knows compliance going last forever here. particularly choice. really true ...don‚Äôt make false claims like media causes ppl worry avoid things. They're definitely not, know heard that. Unless joking. I'm trying moralize point harp OP faked eligibility. really huge deal people gaming system like claiming eligible actually result getting vaccine month two earlier would otherwise. Ultimately, goal get many people possible vaccinated, soon everyone wants *will* vaccinated, I'm much concerned convincing fence also get vaccinated. asked me, would rather someone game system get vaccinated earlier, choose get vaccinated all, would even hesitate say former! vaccinated people better. even think right thing really rigorous asking people proof eligibility, focusing vaccinating whoever front instead strictly enforcing rules expense making difficult prove they're eligible/deserving/whatever.

I think honest consequences people lying eligibility get vaccine earlier are: number people ultimately get vaccinated approximately amount time, takes little longer collect enough vaccine doses vaccinate people *are* eligible (generally higher-risk group) move *next* eligibility group. grievous moral harm, celebrate ""good cause"" either. Thank you. like swine flu narcolepsy thing? totally get saying see asked questions. worries! remember back January 2020, excited year. looking forward watching Olympics Euro tournament. getting ready move new office work done, lot plans attend conventions, travel, see friends later summer. 

I heard something virus China causing unexplained flu-like symptoms, dismissed it. Many us thought going blip radar.

In February, family fell ill around time. mom cough go away. dad flu symptoms tested negative flu. mild cold symptoms. know much Coronavirus yet (although looking back, suspect then).

March comes see following headline: ""NBA suspends season. Trump bans entry Europe"". We're told move new office delayed April work home least month.

I hoping hope would summer we'd back normal. wrong was. Everything shut cancelled rest year. live Atlanta never seen streets empty traffic light.

One year later, family fully vaccinated things starting open again. used lockdown catch friends talked long time improve apartment. mental health took huge dive course 2020 went therapy thankfully lot better.

I've known people infected died. good friend mine recovered COVID. learned never take things granted over, owe hugs lot friends look forward seeing pandemic ends. Twitter seems decided untested mRNA vaccine.

I hate people sometimes. remember weird alien, first time saw someone wearing mask grocery store. now, weird people naked faces, find judging pretty harshly it. Cool story, straight shooters!

Hope whole situation clarified court soonish. AZ honest beginning, EU could allocate resources reliable partner. 

Nevertheless, UK warmly welcomed join EU effort alleviate global pandemic pain **selling** percentage vaccine affected countries, apparently ban place now. 
I think I've done here, thanks. Oh goodness sakes! even know 'surge' we're point. People getting vaccinated quickly, starting groups might actually die. people keep trying drag out?? Bush key piece. lukewarm Republicans still like trust him. right havn't officially one yet since pandemic right? bookings open, usually BVI route right thing vaccines, gets cells, there's much difference. MRNA lasts hours day, completely done body week, like completely completely. dude 20s, numbers give hope maybe able walk nearest pharmacy get vaccine either end month sometime April.

Thanks giving hope Mask burning parties Memorial Day, Zoom goes bye bye around time. Thank you! Thanks! fully vaccinated takes time rapidly spreading contagious variants now. serious cases, hospitalizations, deaths dropping lot that's really point. still going cases (but less) going forward go back ""normal"" number serious cases minuscule. Maybe it'll survive companies, like tech companies know use remote technology. It'd better - know someone moved Colorado last fall WFH. UK feud vaccines, getting business. day last year, trying plan wife's 30th birthday party Saturday, March 14th. Guests backing one one, annoyed current guidelines ""gatherings 10 people less"" gathering going 8 people, originally.

We ended rescheduling party June, October, March, finally rescheduled July year. really hope works out. ended very, small gathering house last year. made fort watched 13 going 30. last time anyone inside house family, live with. 

On 16th, wife started working home. supposed go back office June...then September...now July year, 3 days week office. worked home pandemic, spent lot March last year giving friends family WFH productivity tips.

After past year we'll never same. parts broken now. I‚Äôm glad catastrophic break occurred months prior beginning, dealing covid getting heart broken woulda way much lmao Thanks thanks lol!

Good know, wondering anyone reacted like that. stock supplies! www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/02/17/nih-disease-official-anthony-fauci-risk-of-coronavirus-in-u-s-is-minuscule-skip-mask-and-wash-hands/4787209002/

""Now, United States, absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" -- Fauci

Even ""It's flu, bro"" people took COVID-19 seriously Fauci said flu greater concern COVID-19:

*Fauci want people worry coronavirus, danger ""just minuscule."" want take precautions ""influenza outbreak, second wave.""*

And Fauci said article:

""I getting calls people Sacramento saying, 'Can get airplane go Seattle?'"" Fauci said. ""Like, what? got anything?"" already gave main argument. Consider many doses AZ already administered. Yet aren‚Äôt many incidences people suffered blood clots frequently general (unvaccinated) population. can‚Äôt rule causality unlikely. course batch could bad something like generally intact batch AZ seems save considering everything I‚Äôve written above. 1) that's absolutely insane year since school. 

2) thank god grade 12 year. feel bad get chance celebrate graduation.  ‚ÄúTarnation, *will* dumb irresponsible rest state!‚Äù Thank still lose sense smell complications. teen died covid Illinois last week.  Commercial contracts delivery schedules delineate needs delivered when. contracts binding manufacturers matter contracts have. thing first come first serve commercial procurement contracts (unless specified course). Comparing order PS5 shows complete lack understanding commercial procurement. It‚Äôs crazy 1 year. Seems like it‚Äôs 20. I‚Äôm scheduled get first dose Moderna vaccine afternoon. coincidence. UK AZ plant though IIRC? could sign bad batch UK issues. Im saying clearly wrong move, expressing consequence decision place active cases time. Define ‚Äúover‚Äù.

If ‚Äúover‚Äù mean ‚Äúthe US largely dropped social distancing requirements outside largest gatherings public mask use strictly voluntary‚Äù, ‚Äúover‚Äù means summer 2021.

If ‚Äúover‚Äù mean ‚ÄúI jump plane head sub-Saharan Africa without taking single COVID precaution‚Äù, ‚Äúover‚Äù might mean 2023. Oof haha. get sore arm like everyone saying, boy get headaches! Trust me. want to! I‚Äôm eligible. üôÉ  US still ordering pipeline order clearly already support full vaccinations 331M people whether two doses Pfizer/Moderna single dose J&amp;J? Data shows enough deniers won‚Äôt get anyway. Let rest world order theirs. clinical trials done way. would using product granted emergency use authorization label fashion. design two dose series fun. technique used successfully vaccines past.

Some countries gone single dose model scarcity. Real world data inevitably show reduced efficacy countries. numbers give hope summer. Add J&amp;J done every American wants June. got mine recently suspected batch.

Well day cast, let's see goes... Cue mask burning/bye bye forever Zoom bashes. I'm 100% sure either, read actual paper. good question though absolutely! 

but ""recovered"" vaccine haha!

The thing lasted long sore arm. felt like bad burn first days, stinging localised pain, calmed sensitive spot week, fine. know didn‚Äôt agree terms bet, I‚Äôll point 2.17 million doses day. likely going get 3 million doses day ‚Äúlate April earliest‚Äù projection well. amazing truthful Fauci was? amazing guy! right virus since day 1, right masks based available science, honest public everything!

Thanks, honest truthful Dr. Anthony Fauci! saved lives! taught boomers video conference bonus. 

I'm honestly impressed much tech savvy parents gotten past year. Finally forced learn use devices. Yeah. I'm thinking naturally happen time friends vaccinated that. I'm 35 pre-existing conditions, could still several weeks I'm clear. time I'm vaccinated, think situation much better overall he'll naturally become comfortable.

In general public sense, think it‚Äôll April May, general public get vaccinated.

I get pick Sinopharm, Pfizer-BioNTech Oxford-AstraZeneca, think I'm getting Pfizer-BioNTech, hope made right choice. aren't. small gatherings vaccinated. think 3 weeks ! know people think unnecessary, need clear up. drug administered millions people, already widespread concern whether safe due unusually short testing time emergency, yet full, approval. important investigate cases these, make sure cause concern hurt lots people, make sure confirm risk big risk properly inform people choosing whether get vaccine, breed mistrust ignoring concerns. know someone got vaccinated US early, like last month really go much aware protect masks etc. course deserves vaccine need urgently as....probably ICU nurse country. could think situation point. vaccine makers equity mind.

Deals Russian Chinese companies? made massive deals Western companies, noone shipping first-come-first-served, noone manufactured lot pre-approval..

I think proactive offering funding (loans) constructing production facilities, think could done across board, would focused companies, made dependent particular vaccines. Almost certainly.

Most people die virus infected least three weeks earlier (possibly longer). Three weeks ago, 18th February.

In fact, perfectly possible infected got vaccine. AZ previously managed export vaccine US past, vaccine yet approved USA.

The EU Commission appear going directly USA government get doses - even approved US. make people feel? tried look due shit sources Idek what‚Äôs true

I get first one next week No, they‚Äôre not. People think vaccinated population spread disease wrong. There‚Äôs many indicators case. keep mind many states opening ""everyone"" prioritize ""essential"" workers educators, groups scramble like everyone else get slot shot. 1 person dies many EU got vaccine? wonder poor soul died couple dozen others blood clotting issues issue prevent getting AZ jab. say *wasn't* mental health component.

I said *shouldn't* be.

There always exceptions, course.

I hope able find ways cope personal circumstances. think SF considering making mandate permanent. list. Ice cream too.

You‚Äôre looking total numbers. Look 18. Flu dangerous children. Good! lets hope worries unfounded. I'm worry wart heart. Perhaps I'm jaded experience software, philosophy users can't trusted. hypothesis news around AZ, sceptics likely think regulatory bodies approved things quickly reduce spread give ""good news"". 

Pulling AZ now, despite slowing vaccinations costing political points would make people think regulators ""their side"" - trusting process more, perhaps.

Yes, know regulators elected governments separate bodies democratic states, folks see way. 

I think world pulling AZ could also cause increased doubt something like Pfizer, think that's would happen given Pfizer nothing good news, dominanatly. read article family member blood cancer - read article? states delaying dose blood cancer patient result 8% efficacy SECOND dose. big take away article one size fit that‚Äôs needs properly tested diverse study group. 

Really sick anti-science apologists sub. effected someone loved wouldn‚Äôt cavalier. Shame you.  feeling effects vaccine general, **chance** immune system responding properly. far pregnant women... immune system depending far pregnancy in, different non-pregnant one's would be. Soon, sure.

But quite yet. binary thing vaccine works perfectly variant emerges suddenly vaccine longer works it. ends happening effectiveness reduced somewhat, like say 95% 80%. research date shows least Pfizer Moderna vaccines still effective known variants. one make claim asymptomatic? definition, asymptomatic, Israel PCR everyone? seem like case artical. fail grasp simple concepts agree testing sure, consistent improvement like prescription drug.

But don‚Äôt agree pleasure thing. risk blood lot BC astronomically low, (unfortunate) anecdotal experience aside. take million greater risks every day go outside pleasures like hiking driving. BC *very* safe provided don‚Äôt pre-existing condition take properly, pregnancy dangerous. many women, BC actually helped health lightening regulating periods. Maybe thought US would enough decency make exception one important partners export vaccine even approved yet lol 1932 USA gov told 600 black men they‚Äôre signing get treatment Syphilis. Instead guinea pigs see happens don‚Äôt treat long time, study ended lasting 40 years.    
[CDC link cost-benefit thing, there's essentially zero cost masking benefit even like 5% (since small percent vaccinated people protected) still worth it. Fun times

Luckily I'm getting schoolwork done today I'll weekend recover necessary. I'm happy fully vaccinated tho haha oh ok. agree. 
In fact reason even twitter account receive notifications kid's school closing snow days.

Though recently ""follow"" governor I'll first know demographic (Short, fat, bald, 43 year olds) eligible.  Moderna's production totals tiny Pfizer's totals enough vaccinate EU alone. Hence EU far behind US/UK delays frustrating them. holds remember asymptomatic spread potential sars-cov-2. question always ""how well vaccine preventing asymptomatic infections"" studied efficacy trials. knew odds heavily favor cutting transmission, combination disease spreads pretty well asymptomatically lack study vaccines effectiveness preventing said infections warranted caution. trial data said young people generally stronger reactions older people, scientists think younger people stronger immune systems show response. get reply. implying this, suddenly idea delay second doses longer proven ineffective? 

I feel like even read article. Also funny using paper even peer reviewed, study even complete, make fun people questions whether government actually knows they're doing.

Also, even say said facts, still mean second dose delay idea ineffective. What's better, 50 million people full immunity or, 95 million immunity first dose, 5 million cancer related decreased immunity (5% US populous cancer)? I'd still say latter bad option. FYI, dilution/mixing quite routine.

As small example, patients undergoing fertility treatments (ie IVF) inject needles several times day several weeks. lot commonly used drugs (at least North America) pre-filled require dilution/mixing. given regular folks street themselves, showing youtube video. thought they're tested initially recipe given? Memorial Day kick happening California. Vaccine supplies going issue May, enough doses drop tiers it'll still take month general non-preferential public get shots. guess July 4th likely. long investigation take place? people getting vaccination appointments cancelled? Good four vaccines little, meet late. Dude! I‚Äôve saying too. ‚ÄúEssential workers‚Äù really got shit past year. knew appreciation fake hell one week popular thank us. Exactly year ago, made comment university's confirmed entire Spring Quarter going online? feel like whole thing blow 2-3 weeks.

If right lol. 

As introvert, never really realized value day day interactions part school, college, work going errands. Without interactions, friends simply hang online regularly, past year pretty difficult endure. mental physical health taken huge hit. feels like one day blurring another point, motivation anything productive anymore. 

But well, already got first dose vaccine, hope start job May, reinstate in-person work soon. need hold bit longer. Thanks reading. American deaths flu deaths covid 0-17 age range comparable last year (178 flu deaths 36203 total deaths vs. 208 covid deaths 36203 deaths). flu vaccine effects distancing masking. Forgive can't see covid outsized problem age group. Haha mean official government notification, meant people freaking afterward. fall shouldn‚Äôt possible give students J J shot done it? person gave link Molecular Biologist Moderna literally said opposite you. vaccines similar, assume result given reason to. 

Mac n‚Äô Chise Twitter. offense, I‚Äôm trusting someone worked vaccine opinion Interesting theory, so?  OK, stupid question time. (tiny amount of) bleeding first shot. think anything it, I'm wondering: mean hit vessel instead muscle? so, shot still going effective?   say need money job, yet want get rid restrictions help prevent spread disease hospitalize risk populations, racking expensive medical bills. 

I guess I'm saying ""right"" decision either way lockdowns/openings- it'll save people doom others.

The world live world live in. think functioning economy important continuing shield old, frail, obese people- people get vaccinated they're worried.

I know callous perspective, think need think callously. get everyone thinks like try respectful. Personally, think pull shelves - speak - would wonders reduce vaccine hesitancy. think BC affordable, constantly developed side effects taught people. Also, really think people least know option get tester Leiden‚Äôs, blood clots deathly. lastly, would wish men (and women) would stop putting pleasure (=not wearing condom) safety women.

I think agree, talk opposite sides. remember scared. deer front yard found lockdown remember looking just... crying. carrying like normal world turned upside down. 72 degrees, I'm almost fully vaccinated, light end tunnel. could cry time it'll tears overwhelming joy urinate half day? Omg that‚Äôs especially awful, can‚Äôt even imagine. wouldn‚Äôt expected feel better soon!! you‚Äôll done this. Drink water try take nap   much going slow vaccinations whole EU? I'm pretty frustrated distribution going right now. There's clearly problem doses allocated places opened vaccinations everyone, LA County, populous county country, still can't get enough doses essential workers seniors. think like this.

Employee B gets sick:

HR: vaccine?

Employee B: Yes.

HR: Cool. Stay home feel like need hope feel better. general totally agree you. case Governor announcing new phase vaccine deployment, think appropriate reasonable communications channel. can't trust died, claimed get twice got covid. made ""not trust it."" matter trust it? 

Oh dad totally stole firetruck. Right. Uh huh. life sad boring make shit talk internet? would argue made hellacious year, even emerge battered beaten, fact plenty tough. Don‚Äôt sell short friend. Correct. issue yet resolved real world, need assume Moderna Pfizer operate differently. thread becomes tiresome people don‚Äôt read context.  grandmother 70 first dose, got last Friday dad went visit every week since last March. 

He says protecting important everyone else family lock doesn‚Äôt accidentally give Covid, visits putting harm‚Äôs way going would. 

My aunt mom‚Äôs side mid 60s don‚Äôt know status vaccination mom gone several times since last summer well. happen soon. guess March last month restrictions. Oh question AZ mess get-go That‚Äôs good, I‚Äôm arguing stay way education side effects bit better, actual medical nature BC safe. antibody test cover spike protein nucleoplasid protein? latter designed detect natural infections, would find vaccine antibodies matter much have. northeast! Night day time year ago. ""My Army"" I'm exact problem, waiting great news come out. good news, nothing major going happen there's need check every day. I'm pretty sure could still pretty date checked twice week, honestly that's I'd prefer doing. tough want end badly "" *Think* *stupid average person is*, realize half stupider "" - George Carlin  


Whole lot braindead people supply issue simply constraint part pharma companies. 3 manufacturers giving lot size &amp; delivery dates counties Blue Shield weeks ahead. Even Kaiser Health gets shipments apart county's allocations problems getting orders filled timely manner.  excuse what? surplus? state still can't get vaccine unless i'm old work healthcare I‚Äôm talking USA getting first priority EU wait line. check site date average gets sooner. said late fall looked up, things improved.

The September prognosis based current speed improve vaccination speed even further, maybe enjoy covid free summer. prognosis sign lies can't chose date stick it. Everything relies logistics. Texas winter storm vaccination rate slowed down, multiple vaccination places California shut down, run vaccine. period time showing spring 2022. Woah that's crazy! was: tiredness, head aches, chills, stomach discomfort. weirdest one like 1 hour hot spot wrist, arm got vaccine. went away never anything that. Lol.. Really, mean say country created developed produced US country world so? 

I think so. Infact case even first. 

And lot poorer countries like Russia, china sending vaccines vaccinating every citizen. 

Heck India gave free even president announced it. gave neighbouring countries free already sold Canada Brazil. 

So stfu US leading 'saving' lives. Infact accept fact US even much capacity produce vaccines. 

Btw last remember former prez begging hydrochloroquine too. Lol much innovations. finality great mood. know second dose is, know 10 days I'll free carry life exactly one year ago. I'm curious see easy start previous normal back again. link provided describe immune system launching ""all-out war"" agree masking beginning didn‚Äôt enough messaging completely flawed Fauci - later admitted lied said didn‚Äôt need masks said knew didn‚Äôt enough supply wanted make sure hospitals medical staff enough. 

But without lockdown hospitals would overwhelmed would turn people away. Absolutely not. Masks ever mandated. Give people choice. You, anyone else matter, right restrict freedom others way similar done last year. Vaccinated people absolutely transmit virus. Even best vaccines \~95% effective symptomatic transmission, symptomatic infection, going infectious. recent studies showing overall chance transmission Pfizer vaccine **much** smaller unvaccinated person - something like 10-20x lower. reduction key: need stop transmission achieve herd immunity, comparatively safe vaccinated people things like socialize indoors without masks. 

&amp;#x200B;

As last question: zero chance transmitting virus without contracting it. order transmit virus, virus needs infected cells make copies breathe/cough air. county live officially gone 300 total cases 2,000 - 3,000 total cases months. I‚Äôm happy could cry. live military town people base received vaccines. think I‚Äôm seeing affect vaccines work!!! (They started getting January). could cry happy am. patiently waiting age group eligible vaccines. It‚Äôs ridiculous California keeps citing supply constraints almost 5 million doses sitting shelves state holding back 50% doses ‚Äúname equity‚Äù. Absolutely, ridiculous... let people administer damn vaccines.

To see counties across state cancelling appointments complaining supply decreasing distribution almost tripled state friggin infuriating.

Wtf actually happening Wow, increase currently anticipated end April really could see *most* people want vaccine least one dose. Use member states hording asking more. Hopefully Canada move quickly approve based 2 trials without waiting US trial. assume UK going Canada: Well, looks like neighbour getting act together, eh!?

America: Here, hold beer. I'm pretty sure protect guy. Still might take people feel comfortable, I'm sure lady courtesy you. People shame people accepting shots would put trash? wouldn‚Äôt even worry judged someone would upset that. Sounds like sour grapes. reason I'm getting vaccinated keep spreading covid people, would wrong get Johnson Johnson vaccine (since less effective)? know it‚Äôs urgent matter per se, based things going right now, see fans back sports games September?  one thread saying protection starts earlier 14 days first shot. original tweet said protection 14 days *second* shot, inaccurate. would totally read that. Happy birthday &lt;3
I think come little weirder, maybe minds little clearer, all: survived. Hope awesome cake get go bowling soon :) right?

Anecdotally 2 immediate family members essential workers got vaccinated last week week. see young people post vaccine cards social media tons now, especially last week. seems slowed week. inside

call name assuming keep hitting 2 million shots day (1 million completed vaccinations) we'll neighborhood 150 million people fully vaccinated then...so normal? Janssen much lower efficacy original variant Novavax, yet similar SA variant. AZ (which uses similar technology Janssen) may 20% efficacy SA (need better study w/ participants 12-week 4-week dosing gap confirm). they're necessarily similar. No, says starting 14 days, meaning protection starts 14 days before.you‚Äôre proving point. Yup, true crazy. Eradication level efficiency. Yes, downvoting comment looked all. year ago lived downtown apartment two roommates boyfriend lived mountain town 30 minutes away (much smaller) place. work home clear things going shut down, took cat things stayed boyfriend cat. definitely changed mojo kitty awhile. move new place, deal unfriendly kitty want there. must scary :( . even enough room introduce properly get another litter box! held hope would end two months. Which, way, seemed like FOREVER. Two months later end things least relaxed. looked house found house summer. also lot run groups, camping trips, park events summer summer isolation means. moved new house fall lots space. Got kitten, three cats much happier since space world. Two months pandemic, start ending downtown apartment ended complicated one roommate refused pay rent even communicate us breaking lease. really miss place, fun especially spring could hear baseball games going deck, since right next baseball stadium. miss city tip fingers. new location mountain town city, city like 25 minute drive least. 

It felt like this: teenager got punished IMing time supposed log homework. staying aunt/uncle months know punishing style would be. mother direct would pretty flexible learned lesson. aunt uncle different, they'd whisper I'd anxiously wait answer going happen. know long I'd punished stressful. That's felt like beginning.

We super lucky work, terrible headache work home. would time beforehand, boyfriend managed get set remote stuff. goes frequently works hardware. 

In summer I'd ask what's missing, since lot normal summer stuff outdoors. I'd ask myself, tired even lost much? lucky work, I'm around high risk people, etc. lot knowing whatever want even desire it. really go concerts nightclubs nice knowing that's thing that's normal okay. miss big festivals, races, sports games. miss run clubs forty people brewery afterwards. stressful thing divide created people. I'm subreddit TV show year ago subreddit created daily covid discussion, awful. slam people call evil seeing friends travelling anything involve locked down. Even vaccines underway, still it. hate media much try twist everything panic, even things getting better. beginning - need stay inside bit overwhelm hospitals? Cool. makes sense. move towards figuring live wait vaccine. important people vaccinated? move forward. move on. 

Anyways, people much worse. really feel people dealing unemployment, people stay isolated high risk family members, school kids (grade school college) lost last part last year year too. Government restrictions clearly worth it.

Just look Florida lack restrictions, 91k cases per million people, compared California far restrictions, resulted much lower rate 91k cases per million people. submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Go ahead tell clause valid Belgian law. medical opinion, statement fact. get sub-1K new cases per day, likely mid Summer, politically economically untenable keep restrictions place. Probably well even. They've already lifted rural states. virus /s Yea technically yes, refused buy vaccines either. there's enough produced us get back track. Also denied mask safety measures efficiency saying pussies. He's done damage covid and/or lockdowns... What? read study? You‚Äôre 100% wrong. think done challenge trials form day 1, think would accelerated things much. Getting large scale manufacturing sorted going take much less time already did. Nice, that's great hear. wonder timeline general population end being, end receiving (I'm guessing multivalent?) booster place normal second dose. Probably bit tight realistically, win us either way. Moderna vaccine shown efficacy approximately 92 per cent protecting COVID-19, starting 14 days first Seems like two cases austria (30ies 40ies patients) vaccination batch pulled use that. manufacturing issue might correct  I've already gotten first shot. Getting second one late month. Pfizer name everybody already knows. entirely true, lot remote jobs ask within driving range site. Point it. show that? understanding Novavax doesn‚Äôt use mRNA all. spikes created butterfly/ moth larvae collected inserted humans create immune response. 
Our bodies don‚Äôt create spike instead spikes injected. makes sense immune system still needs work. Take tylenol ibuprofen.  Ibuprofen may interfere immune response make shot less effective. Yea, honestly okay waiting unblinded, dad pressuring get antibody test since I‚Äôm seeing Saturday see I‚Äôm vaccinated.

I really fine though. I‚Äôm possibly vaccinated, got PCR test today there- get results tomorrow, don‚Äôt much exposure anyway. mom brother fully vaccinated awhile. dad got first moderna dose month ago, 2nd scheduled Monday like 80% protection. I‚Äôm seeing unvaccinated brother + finance too, don‚Äôt really leave apartment. Overall seems pretty low risk. said ""By June"" added date edit.


 replied ,** *before edit,*** *literally* ""BY June optimistic"" would mean first, earliest I've heard optimistic takes. 

I'm sure could clearer would notice edit.

If remember maybe share account somebody, lying. know care. sure answer you‚Äôre looking Novavax‚Äôs vaccine protein subunit adjuvant vaccine, second oldest method vaccine development. proteins case don‚Äôt actually produce hugely signifiant immune response, function target. adjuvant immune system spurring addition largely causes immune response it‚Äôs directed associated proteins. cell, yes would also induce cell immunity. vaccines also expected immune response Yep. love people knowledge law judicial civic processes make type statements above, intentionally undereducated/miseducated masses jump internal mantra, ""That sounds good, probably true 'cuz misspell words use improper grammerr, talk good!"" ^(Upvote)

It disgusting, exactly powers hoping for, product crippling academia country.   bunch morons get vaccinated. Well, pretty much exact opposite true. cranking vaccinations guarantee many people smarter experts infectious disease is. He‚Äôs political one It'd neat started churning regardless. We'll take them. 

Sincerely, Canadian. real though. Mostly money Jesus find country trendy shit list awhile. moment leader Joe Biden fine No, she‚Äôs perfectly capable taking care herself. She‚Äôs ordering groceries online take care without assistance. educated matter, think saying prevents someone virus shows symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, could wrong here. think described would said asymptomatic transmission. Huge news. good enough application emergency use US? 5-6x talking w/ mRNA vaccines. natural infection. feel like I've seen exact headline 16 times last 2 months I'm new. still think doomsayers less annoying people trying dunk them.

Practically every thread 2-3 top comments ""haha suck people sub."" AstraZeneca make vaccines, acquired MedImmune 2007 manufacture nasal spray influenza vaccine. also, importantly, dedicated biologics operations would enable company transferable skills manufacture ChAdOx1 vaccine vector also biologic operates principles. However I'm aware deep history pushing specific agenda topic except ignore foreseeable future. This.

Instead unified national response got US Senators selling stocks largest market crash 10 years know what‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs big deal end 50 different approaches states sniping Internet cable TV clout Facebook likes. God bless America. think there's enough doses yet widespread. hear NYC overnight appointments J&amp;J shot.

You see many doses given day vaccination here: doses given Fridays, least 2.8 million given two weeks ago Friday. Doses given Mondays 50% less given Friday, perhaps suggesting many sites receiving doses middle week running weekend.

The variation day week seems less pronounced last week compared two weeks ago, perhaps sites reaching daily capacity.

It's possible things become less efficient overall distribution ramps up, larger proportion supply goes pharmacies, vaccinate smaller number people day mass vaccination sites. need dedicated vaccination sites sure. Normal pharmacies set handle mass vaccinations. Walgreens pharmacists performing shots handling regular work duties. brought extra staff handle this, far know enough unemployed qualified people actually able help. think administration vaccine really going become apparent serious bottleneck supply rapidly increasing. signs far suggesting mRNA vaccines *not* much less effective variants we've seen. Real world tests shown otherwise. mean fact you‚Äôre calling ‚Äúpurely political‚Äù post political. Bhattarchaya professor medicine. lots posts public health policy sub. one different?

Still good news. wish super-solid data, i'll take evidence point lol California also targeting harder hit areas first. central valley LA getting vaccine right overall viral levels higher Bay Area going everyday things far riskier here.

That means vaccine get transported locations.....it take like 6 hours minimum get LA SF, probably closer 8..... two possible ways people die nowadays. Cause death either corona vaccine. Moderna already Phase booster actually. Last heard said would need months go production, could expecting boosters sometime summer.

The ""oh shit"" factor steadily ramped though seeing videos locked Wuhan. personal belief thought quote fit nicely making joke, nice day fellow citizen! question science behind Novavax' vaccine. also induce cellular immunity (SARS-CoV-2 reactive Tc cells) and, yes, achieve that, seeing subunit vaccine?

That‚Äôs mention uncommon currently come contact South African strain. It‚Äôs ridiculously rare reinfected. countries?

The contract importantly specifies volume purchased, delivery schedule (pg 31-33) payment schedule. crucial components procurement contract.

Not contract specify expected delivery volumes schedule, also quite clearly outlines Moderna excuses delivering (pg 43) think EU knows rely AZ significant numbers deliveries.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  changes way much. kept changing vaccine timeline. would stuck said originally would right lol getting it? heard stories people getting turned away loosely meeting criteria--they want shots arms. 

I got mine days ago simply I'm marketing fine food manufacturer. asked proof employment once. Hindsight 20/20 - fact know early stages pandemic. better hope best plan worst, certain scientists experts simply trying warn us guaranteees. inevitably gets distorted/misinterpreted media general public, think huge mischaracterization call 'scare campaign'. tested positive, case mild chance false positive mild want shots. standing 6 feet apart three vaccinated? hugging freely without mask showcase good get vaccinated. parents right? find number blood clot disorders?  Depends are.

I'm SF, feeling people wearing masks summer unfortunately. actually agree trying get people wear masks. think year extremely unlikely change someone's mind point. absolutely nothing said done get someone wear mask point.

In addition, vaccinating people day. change someone's mind wearing mask, month two simply matter. Basically, I'm accepting defeat anti-maskers, focused stressing something can't changed matter two months time. current problem enough vaccines, ""Not enough people want get vaccinated"" case interested, figured I'd mention California set [volunteer vaccine sites qualify regardless currently fall tiers. Yes, please stop poking me. brought utter false claims private companies free will, I've forced correct it. might pandemic global, EU cannot bear whole heavy lifting alone. UK US support welcomed. mind staying isolated get vaccine. I‚Äôm getting first shot Moderna today. feels weird, think pandemic forced grow faster. disconnected everyday life made focus goals need adapt achieve them. could say ways I‚Äôm worse, ways I‚Äôm better. I‚Äôm really sure I‚Äôm different. assumed thought AZ efficacious, case. meant Pfizer efficacious. *right*, still take AZ, also pretty good. Now, seem imply difference efficacies ""matter"", absurd thing say. need drop federal buildings. reason fully vaccinated federal employees need keep sitting desk wear mask agree theory. People spent much time energy vesting hatred mockery Florida built despotic hellhole ignore evidence contrary. given said 40 million Q1 (in January, reduction 80-120 million), track deliver around 17 million, cut 60 million half probably closer actually happen. want soon safely possible. allowed it, I‚Äôd watch YouTube video vaccinate myself. heard elderly tend less severe side effects young people active immune systems, could one potential cause. that, think enough testing data collection know predisposition COVID vaccine side effects ""runs family"" speak. Sounds possible knows. California, know door dash drivers who‚Äôve received shot. mean, grey, plenty teachers getting in-person education, so... 

I know, offered it, take it. main focus economy, keeping people dying.

I disagree 75+ year old people quarantine easily. still need go store, doctor, still work, etc.

If wanting reduce deaths conserve hospital resources, give vaccine people dying ending hospital.

Healthcare workers also prioritized they're directly exposed COVID patients needed treat sick. Long Term Care facilities also huge source deaths hospitalizations (old people healthcare workers work there).  Suuure. covid matters right? China fl√º even kill catch it, calm down. democracy government enemy, collective citizens deciding want society ordered, inherently good thing without order chaos.
People advocating little government effectively advocating dysfunction anarchy, government one form another existed stable societies since dawn civilisation. Total Vaccine Doses Total Vaccine Doses 18+ one 18+ 65+ one shot

So 2.48 mil today Please tell people know least burn masks plastic shit them. live planet hip tattoos over? What's big deal tiny scar arm? No, Party like would gone. year ago today, college told ‚Äútwo weeks off‚Äù. We‚Äôre 20 minutes away major state university sent everyone home also cyber attack (Russian scammer lmao), knew coming. (we got sent home two days later).

My sorority sisters day party one houses, playing pong outside Jell-O shots watched governor. 

It weird, simultaneously sinking feeling something bad happening, also mild denial suffer major depressive disorder ebb flow existential dread passed now. Oh sweet, summer child. reminder, sub discuss POLICY, POLITICS. want discuss POLITICS, please take politically-oriented sub, thanks! stimulus used help country due Coronavirus. Congrats! Would good time buy kind Big Pharma ETF? know whole market inflated looking like beginning biotech revolution. Awesome! Thanks info, know like day 28 0 deaths hospitalization thats incredible. Seems promising vaccine putting pandemic rest. Love one done actual data variants suggesting efficacy severe outcomes those. feel immensely relieved! Cheers! Defending mask thing ridiculous. came conclusion mask shortage doctors needed made bunch bullshit instead telling us truth make sure doctors could get them.

Then supply constrained walked back lies. Yet EU market seems market hit 60% cut deliveries. seems far original target given up. many weeks promise production problems fixed. talking about?

Back November, 78% population wanted vaccine growing ever since.

Source: month, read article risen 80% (can't find source), we're antivaxxer. We're careful.

If think article misinformation, report mods, they'll remove post. sure won't. guess, want hear another US politician talking world looks US leadership views beacon free world. Oh well, German pretty sure would equal position US went ego mode, I'm happy decided share countries block even means things taking bit longer would otherwise. really matter right now? get shot, get shot. think current political environment US helping foreigners citizens poison pill. 

I'd surprised leadership country realize that. think post removed internal US politics/economics. thought subreddit r/coronavirus r/politics get it, sometimes things go wrong, AstraZeneca beyond horrible communication us EU residents.

The real issues normally make vaccines clearly promised. issue US trial data. trial data mess, different trial designs multiple places trying mathematically homogenized one study... addition, even errors administration protocols trials. would rather scar carry flimsy card wallet? 

You damn fool. chosen lease space year common Charming. Thank amazing contribution.
 /s nuance important, call people discuss nuance use numbers instead saying things bad goal. Give us good goal! They're lying us ""for good"" like masks.

You'd think they'd learn stop lying us eventually, better continue hurting confidence institutions can't find source think smallpox others higher strongly suspect states open eligibility everyone without restrictions starting time April latest, hopefully far I'm right :) AZ shitty.

That said, quick calculation, even ""issues"" AZ would delay campaign less 2 weeks overall. annoying, end world grand scale things.

40 million less means 7 million less Germany, however plans vaccinate 6-7 million week. let's catastrophic. I'm saying good news means producers mess we'll still able get July/August.

The real unknown point Janssen, state still committed original goals. said getting throw away? Sounds like lied cut line. sound extremely entitled. Illinois hospitalizations lowest since pandemic started! gets say akchually way Thanks, know! Someone suggested sub me. Peace 0 deaths indeed bad goal. pretending 0.01% world population dying (2.6 million population 8 billion) apocalyptic.

Nuance important. COVID obviously bad level extinction-level event. I'm sure productive interesting comment section.  According media reports, seems EU Commission treated like trade negotiation took long time arguing price liability issues. 

After 3 months, apparently signed similar contract originally proposed.

Other countries (UK/US) made agreements much quickly helped sort supply chain issues. Yep! CDC considers ""fully vaccinated"" 14 days, data show *very* protective point point basically stop worrying COVID deadly disease anymore. Research *also* suggests immunity *continue* strengthen *even more* 14 days. Kind reminder ""fully vaccinated"" bit arbitrary threshold immune systems super weird lol.

Anyway, congratulations! said 42 posted 7 hours ago. That's nice thing internet - pages static like printed article. politics :) I'm Texas announced opening everyone aged 50+. I'm itching get it, I'm 35 underlying health conditions.

I'm really hoping long drop eligibility 50+ open all. vaccinated US Citizen I'm grateful governments selfishness Yeah, quarantines social distancing polio.

And really understand point anyway. lots diseases around many hundreds years vaccines antibiotics. believe January 2020, got dose 1 couple days ago. Hoping OK 3 weeks. Two weeks compounds number infections future increases number people die got vaccine two weeks late (or timing two weeks).  population issue, california enough qualified people injections population? Run single man. health stand point, enough people get vaccinated another mutation eventually evade vaccine. 

Someone else mentioned would best businesses incentivize vaccines punish don‚Äôt. think valid. 

The guy gave example someone contracts covid non vaccinated would quarantine 2 weeks financial detriment one vaccinated still go work since transmission low. 

It‚Äôs reasonable point since still creates incentive get it‚Äôs inherently discriminatory. I‚Äôd like change stance government enforcement. Make beneficial reasonable get vaccine health wise financially. people talk crap starts hurting wallet, they‚Äôll get vaccinated. Well full time remote, decision live high cost living area thing governing expenses. Actually, you‚Äôre sure convictions, go actual conversation Twitter like have. I‚Äôll join :) stand corrected. must read numbers wrong. ordered earlier, expansion production could happened earlier. Yeah, expect case look distribution vs administration numbers still see inequities. also hard justify look Virginia Department Health vaccine page see every minority group vaccinated almost exactly half rate white population normalized population sizes. Also, think numbers wrong.. Everything find says first deal 200M option 100M more? can‚Äôt wait vote him... again. 

He‚Äôs popular. I‚Äôll crying, thanks. 60% approval rating he‚Äôs bad

Could related 54% population even finishing high school. Take example, president says ""we're good, rich bad, I'm helping poor!"" people believe love without knowing he's actually screwing everyone over. Frankly, businesses dependent upon automobile commuting looking diversify anyway. known trend, (might be) happening faster anticipated.  know? clear shipping order countries ordered, start producing scale pre-approval. easy company say would shipped fact, I'm sure there's actual data beyond cheap talk suggest would have. many somebodies, one looked syringe said hey empty? reach heard immunity (largely vaccines), technically correct - even tho feel bet really annoying. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know right can't fathom it. Millions people AZ vaccine yet many serious health issues come up?
Vs many people day impacted covid.

Some governments seem care blame could possibly put actually saving lives (aka happy let thousands die natural causes rather risk 1 ""might"" attributed something even saved lives forementioned 1000). get maths personally.  Ya seems like higher density areas getting enough. Maybe there's demand liberal cities distributing based population resulting excess areas there's vaccine hesitancy. Well he's wrong China run emperor. run Party. Yeah that's completely false. Go back last year sub. still getting though. ignored 20 years science mRNA. Yes used widely, enough studies done prove safety. might understand actual scrutiny vaccines go getting even emergency approval. Infection get us herd immunity especially larger % gets 'young health people take it' (as say) actually take it. significant amount keeping us reaching it, spread would lower keeps going. even talking risk deaths, low group, also side (long-term) effects larger chance appearing (did consider risk/benefit analysis tsking vs not-taking it?

And again, cut bullshit saying 'I stay away them', people get vaccinated. impossible without effectively banning participating society. know sitting next table restaurant? bar? steam room? don't. Everyone take vaccine, can't seem trust science one restricted places everyone else enjoy herd immunity. Still force take it, bear consequences. unfollowed sub, I‚Äôve come back briefly talk year anniversary. remember reading Twitter December 2019 serious thing getting. early 2020, told everyone work stay alert, stay safe. told overreacting, flu. wish much right wrong.

I‚Äôve lost crucial year life mental health far worse was, everyday gets little easier. I‚Äôm going go see best friend Arizona end July hopefully get pre-pandemic soon. lucky enough job whole time (I work nursing home) keep health two outbreaks work say. Everyone family really matters fully vaccinated, well myself. it‚Äôs easing back normalcy. May go kicking screaming long night, Covid. It‚Äôs least deserve. Literally employee Moderna said they‚Äôre abundance caution even though lab tests showed positive antibody activity variants. Moderna said this. Also, lab tests referring to? I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôd shock random person Reddit knew something didn‚Äôt. 

But hey, guess know exactly companies they‚Äôre even better employees developing vaccines do, buddy. provided sources information literally provided NONE, get high horse come actual data next time :). Question is, passage time count towards quarantine? reason stop delivering Exactly. fact matter common vaccines curb spread disease they're targeting. covid vaccines would exceptional anything.  


But even something *probably* case can't assumed, least, scientists. That's they've urging caution. can't speak authoritatively studies done harder study particular issue.  


These results shocking they're still cause celebration. region (Tuscany) ha suspended remaining 15 doses ABV2856 batch only.
15k doses batch already used nothing like happened  Yeah misread section, subtitle Moderna missed paragraph AstraZeneca, thanks. Still, can't figure 2.2M - Moderna really cut 1.3M? think supposed ship much first place. Microsoft extensive study Japan 4 10s, vs 5 8s well found productivity went up? No, anything vaccinated recovered COVID-19 provide even robust/lasting immune response. number called, definitely hesitate. bizarre reasoning, afraid vaccine symptoms actual virus symptoms.. yeah one's fair enough, I've approved. future, messaging modmail helpful responding automod :) Lmao absolutely false given slow rollout already happening everywhere else. comment linking fool.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

The older people, comparisons flu disingenuous harmful. younger people, apt accurate.

If we're comparing relative threats kids, disruption schooling massively damaging COVID. Puh, know sure, probably. get loads virus, need host viruses form, cannot reproduce own. generally cells (most commonly one cell line called HEK cells) used get 'infected' virus virus RNA help produce large quantities thereof. 

It might virus-containing vaccines use cells sure use exact protocol. principal likely quite similar. 
(mRNA vaccines different, produced cell-free procedure) said enough doses, everyone would vaccinated. That‚Äôs important difference. Summary:
All potentially bad news weeks ago -- variants, cases rising -- longer bad. However, go hard, fast, things change. Overall, though, good shape. people territories american ""every american"" include drive across too, friends husband flew Texas month ago dad dying cancer, rented car drove home boarder last week.  think companies seeing real estate cost savings may forever migrate kind hybrid work home solution, rather bringing everyone back office like December 2019.

Specifics change daily company, plans involve everyone office 1-2 days/week, sitting shared work stations, WFH remainder time (with choice opt-in get permanent office someone *wants* 5 days/week). Last heard, we're ending lease 8 12 floors lease Manhattan consolidate operations.

Technically office open since July anyone wants go in, times I've there, like 4-5 people floor normally seats 100+ know getting downvoted. completely correct, fully know long term effects. They're finding long term / permanent lung heart damage people covid, even symptoms. oh yeah, totally, let's send children care catch covid. Right !!!. I'm one Essential workers public, vaccine use. Funny works. Buzz words good make public think care Essential workers. one reddit ever go politics. mean complex steps? looked seems beyond thawing, steps provided prevent contamination vial. 

I foresee step failure would cause huge efficacy problems. worked for/around Kroger better part 20 years (and currently working satellite company fixing exclusively Kroger tech) confidently say Kroger scrapes sides barrel, Walmart scrapes bottom still. feel like sharing good thing, even discussion yet. people U.S. able get vaccine incredibly long time. Middle East called. want vaccines. think us going aggressively normal fully vaccinated. Indoor dining open everywhere, even California, feel comfortable yet. get second shot next week? bet I'll tons indoor dining (although really enjoy outdoor dining). CDC says travel, I'm fully vaccinated, see family East Coast seen year? One save lives minor annoyance worst. save lives hurt millions others various ways. Yep, difference Give em bored teenagers, see get high Germany even close using vaccines Everyone know getting latest tier (food, agriculture, education) show proof job. think food handler's cert ID enough. Also LA county. Nah, know fair amount people ended getting covid even mild cases still knocked ass 2+ weeks. Vaccine reactions like usually last 48 hours *max* leave lasting health issues like covid can- I'll take anyday actual virus. Canada always comes top Bhikmange things said right, except thing long term side effects. happen various vaccines, since one tested long term way knowing them. young, healthy people risk covid, something consider deciding vaccination right decision health. variants spreading hospitalizations deaths still dropping cares receiving hundreds thousands Moderna doses? LOL year...covid, intense wildfires CA stealing one release walking outside almost 2 months straight, soon ex wife started online affair we‚Äôre divorced.

But I‚Äôm grateful kept job, work going well, started vaccine doses Monday, seeing new, wonderful person treating experience restart life. I'm surprised long livestreams mass vaccination clinics. even single one. would nice look at. don‚Äôt know getting downvoted totally right, vaccine literally chance containing thing half country fucking stupid masks quarantine. I‚Äôm glad guys Biden hope achieve good 4 years republicans aren‚Äôt giving easily could right back another Trump mess 4 years.... many people, even Reddit, idea criticized americas nationalistic approach ridiculous. (‚ÄúOf course take care ourselves, could expect??!‚Äù) Culturally it‚Äôs America first lot even left leaning people.

And fair, lot problems United States need attention. reason countries let America take care citizens, places like EU look global solutions. says things based current data. Last month, think we'd vaccinating people fast let alone people actually wanting get vaccinated. mental health component.

Wearing mask helps protect others around you.

Your parents showing care you.

It really simple. got vaccine secret back January though, made point getting done public like others would gone long way towards helping people get it. kinda deserve left outta headline. sister registered nurse mother three beautiful young sons. asked planned teaching sons abnormal time ever lived masks normal something wore specific time specific reason. answer absolute yes made smile gave hope. Kids get childhoods back. horny covaxin It'll vary company, know answer big corporate HQ probably ""never."" people go office five days per week, expect it'll much common maybe two three days office week two three remote days they'll reconfigure office space focus shared desk space rather dedicated cubicles every person. hybrid happens, earliest expect September likely early 2022. ever arrives, weekly average Vaccination numbers declining since Feb 3rd. don‚Äôt think Anthony Fauci taking *vaccine* account considering quickly pandemic over?

I also think it‚Äôll sooner yet another instance tamping expectations, come lol much thanks. Friend like--headache waiting room???? puzzled. moved feeling like coming something 2 hours. Sore throat added 12 hours. Basically feel like sick something sinuses chest fine. So, antibodies made! differences Africa variant? even wrong. CDC's studies suggest mask wearing result tremendous substantial reduction cases deaths. said early on, largely people get false sense security think anything. Nothing beats staying home unless necessary social distancing. can't that, later learned mask, studies also show cause statistically significant reduction cases deaths.

This science works, masses ability maturity get that. Yes. That's said ""was"" ""is"". Cant think anything less relevant westerners dubbing enemies ""nationalistic"" using source.  anti-black brigade going downvote you. always do. can't believe year, also, year? vaccinate undocumented immigrants living US went back January 2 (kind idiotic besides point). We're 500 people spread 10 floors busy floors quiet floors. also lot unique visitors public coming daily. solid rules place (2 elevator most, partitions desks, daily temp check morning entering). worked flawlessly. 2 cases since came back tied people going weekend.

I think places go back every day seems get less likely outbreak going happen.

It gigantic increase mental health coming back. get way done actually get socialize people. Meh, automatic put get car, give second thought all... number thromboembolic events vaccinated people higher number seen general population. 10 March 2021, 30 cases¬†of thromboembolic events reported among close 5 million people vaccinated COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca European Economic Area. see previous administration selling doses highest bidder, rather giving away. originally said agree EU cracking vaccine shitshow however fault Aus suffering delayed vaccine program, EU‚Äôs.

Not really. EU could share burden lower expected manufacturing yields AZ Australia. doesn‚Äôt want too.

Should blame EU lower yields? factory all. See I‚Äôm going Indeed development vaccines worldwide effort. production not.

You can‚Äôt say straight face. manufacturing vaccine without first funding, researching creating Australia another country want independent production however could fund production facility like UK done

You‚Äôll find Australia done this. EU get huge number new pharma manufacturing competitors world wide over. Australia exporting vaccine manufacturing. argument totally insane basically, ""states *perfect* size government."" Counties cities always small--we need standardized set rules. Federal big--we've got keep Big Brother lives. 

Nevermind fact many live states smaller populations mid-sized city. Yes, and. took month ramp up. order books guarantee prompt delivery.

I'm one blaming individuals. Even Canada getting 5% doses need, worldwide supply REALLY limited. People realize privileged Canada get doses month late. It‚Äôs safety precaution. rule vaccine they‚Äôre taking precaution shelve it. way new drug trials would halt someone fall seriously ill new drug ruled cause.  blaming America isn‚Äôt letting vaccines country, Canada made huge mistake relying much states China manufacturing. also yes Americans fucking suck half country hasn‚Äôt quarantined taken virus seriously meanwhile country lockdown since November greedy American can‚Äôt share they‚Äôve vaccinated whole obese , lazy, racist country. Pfizer Israel deal together -- Israel gets ton Pfizer vaccine, Pfizer gets basically use Israel real world laboratory get data. seeing figures vaccines country vaccinating like Israel is, especially \*one\* particular vaccine.

I got last week. Happy hear positive news (up 83% effective good variants.). AZ rejected? time USA ready donate sell doses, Canada already given shots nearly every Canadian wants one (at least one shot) entering summer.  

Canada buying doses US government. They've purchased Pfizer Moderna already.  US government likely donating, selling excess doses, Canada, rest developed world doing. that's right thing do.  

Canada swimming supply likely time US ready actually donate (or sell) doses.  may able convince US however earlier allow Pfizer Moderna start exporting US facilities. Wow.

At least able get mom appointment shot (J&amp;J) next Monday loading Walmart's appointment scheduling page 30 minutes morning. think clinics store pharmacies get supply (as opposed mass vaccination sites, county's doses going), 'shots per day' number shoot (ugh) pretty quickly.

I've looking found anything far.  vaccine exports UK valid contract UK ones AZ, company currently making them. That's export ban, purchase, sadly suits distort narrative. Nobody asking donated doses Canada would sale. know we're numbed everything got remember even month mean 1000 lives billions Canadian GDP Sweet! gotta hop border Canada get shoot up? Err... mean vaccine arm... Calling always great way go.

Good job getting vaccinated! got list local CVS. Took spin account. Someone fancies armchair epidemiologist grasp fundamentals. dude, outdated, cdc says something, mean always correct forever, get data, things change. finding one dose offers great protection 

and nowhere people saying one dose enough, saying, one dose offers good protection 3-4 weeks. two dose still needed. genuinely didn‚Äôt give shit words Trump said vaccination policy incompetent authoritarian liar matter stated goals were. There‚Äôs nothing examine outcome. Thousands died politicized masks garbage president. 

I‚Äôm glad found something feel superior though. Deep-seated feelings inadequacy almost certainly contributing reason person falls lies transparent charlatan. Hope telling ‚Äòmy ilk‚Äô bunch hypocrites helps feel better. honestly don‚Äôt know details almost never utilize it, I‚Äôm Los Angeles teacher, starting pay $60,000 BA Credential.

If want details, explains all. 

However, spouse state, isn‚Äôt helpful, California accept state credentials. Maybe asking delay delivery (letting go orders) use slots jump line reformulated vaccine deal variants. get drivers licenses municipal IDs areas. Also, friend mine got vaccinated Chinese passport. image Mexican passport would work well.  garbage better atlas maybe social pressure? want get stared wearing mask someone say something. like people tell others vaccinated not.

When hit critical mass vaccinations, people comfortable maskless around others maskless. Covid far deadlier flu, I‚Äôm sure know already. doesn‚Äôt hurt put little piece fabric face go help protect health people around guardian good media outlet

HAHAHAHAHAHABAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAH don‚Äôt think two things linked. want roll fast everyone else get vaccinated. know mean things open again.

I know least people want everyone else get vaccinated, ""wait see"" comes themselves. Chicago reopened indoor dining January positivity hospitalizations 60%. currently 50% capacity two solid weeks positivity lower day 2020. we'e already purchased vaccines Pfizer Moderna, unused J&amp;J would better countries need can't afford them. Like, we've already purchased j&amp;j too.  So, purchasing J&amp;J US government opposed US allowing J&amp;J export vaccines us fullfill order quicker?

And hopefully get US open supply line willing actually donate doses. I'm sure find somewhere provide curbside pickup. delivery service comes door.

What, go ball game? Maryland still barely anyone vaccinated Oh God. Europe planning constantly bitching vaccine supplies entire year? already laying groundwork complain J&amp;J, aren‚Äôt even due shipments Q2. Meanwhile Seattle, still 0% capacity Mariners games. someone isn‚Äôt feeling symptoms they‚Äôre going stay house.

Nor would expect to, need minimize large gatherings people contract virus. don‚Äôt want black people access vaccine? think lot migrant workers covered supply already. saw video organizations outreach farm workers setting places get vaccinated places reach. One president said it, ilk blasted him. Biden makes policy nodding heads congratulating fine decision. came diatribe still fail see hypocrisy makes much hilarious. would hope many dont SSN cant get state issued ID What, go ballgame? don‚Äôt think someone attitude worth saving. asshole. Canada needs US lot US needs Canada. We'll fine. Perhaps. stadia indoor areas too. many vaccines trade Greenland? want visit New York City border reopens! essential travel April. Husband (who staying home) fully vaccinated then, current pace. still quarantine separate kids post-travel? share space return? wrong people think part mk ultra think - group people living close quarters social distancing may possible traveling internationally great frequency period cdc recommends infrequently possible avoid transmitting disease. many deployments already controversial local population even bringing coronavirus locals concern. additionally, people responsible protecting united states, must good health do.

that's #1 priority vaccination, there. wonder too. Pandemics usually last two four years can't imagine quarter halfway this.

The vaccine thing keeping going vitro, modified receptor binding domain spike protein easily bound ACE-2 receptor cell. There's massive amount pent-up demand travel, lot white-collar workers saving ton money pandemic working home (no commute, less money spent food etc.), they'll war-chest spend travel restrictions lift. 

The lower travel demand people suffered economically crises going off-set people *didn't* lose jobs, saved money working remote, pent-up appetite vacations suck last two years. long make side, hotels airlines bounce back fine. Biggest market first, second dose really doesn‚Äôt matter we‚Äôll time implemented anyway, etc Yes, together commissioner Stella Kyriakides.

And forget probably thousands deaths tens hundreds billions costs. could extinguished earlier strenuous restrictions. restrictions would severe, would say worth it. Definitely headache right away. took Excedrin way home realizing pain relievers small issue, I‚Äôm freaking abt it, grateful!! got another headache second night too... What's difference allowing Pfizer Kalamazoo export Canada reselling Canada unused J&amp;J thing. Canada need charity willing seller related note, CDC says 127 Million Doses delivered. (1) U.S. supposed get 240 Million Doses end March. (2) means 113 million doses planned delivered next 21 days. missing something?

(1) Day laborers able get vaccine US. Especially State issued ID. Well, days ago started helping countries region. Chilean government donated 1000 tons oxygen Peru, donated 20.000 vaccines Ecuador 20.000 vaccines Paraguay, also helped transportation vaccines China Uruguay. plenty hospital space risk elderly vaccinated, time become personal risk assessment. 

Personally, I'm waiting vaccine really resume normal life can't shame someone willing take risk given truly vulnerable immune there's plenty open beds. mostly understanding said wear gas mask go out. Dude, that‚Äôs insane. Sounds uncomfortable. risk contracting virus outdoors so, low. know elitist taking random ski trip Alaska. many now? Last heard, U.S. bought 600 million IIRC. still FDA approved. letting minors take now? some, uncomfortable greasy oily ew. told people canceling day Yeah I‚Äôm used it. It‚Äôs uncomfortable big issue wear one. sure everyone makes fuss it. Unfortunately can‚Äôt find anything states happens back deliveries look like pay receive doses. also found disturbing turns paid 34.51$ per dose Pfizer moderna. That‚Äôs israel even. admit great getting kind illness year. could see masking flu season sure things like shopping errands. Funny - rent expensive places people actually want live in, *because* people want live places. Nobody's champing bit go live podunk town largest store Dollar General. Throw Bolsonaro hungry jaguar den already. Every American (age 16+) opportunity late spring early summer. way takes late summer. Opening day approx 2 weeks. Even think we‚Äôll saved summer still early. Stay crazy TX. believed would three months, that'd one thing.

But hear Biden saying ""maybe till Christmas,"" Fauci saying ""maybe sometime next year,"" people threads sub saying ""not every child America vaccinated"" even ""lock there's variant emerging anywhere world."" remember last year, government telling ""just two weeks"" people treating preposterous idea lockdown would last anywhere near year.

Given that, trust say it'll three months. Maybe personally Dictator Texas, long people locked us last time (with lie ""just two weeks"") stay power. believe promises anymore. IDK sure people giving vaccines aren‚Äôt immigration officers. would care kind visa have? quite. considered Florida Georgia extremely humid environments? suggest research impacts transmission air virus. states equal regard. right, great, let's party! not, great, go again. definitely sense denial health damage months suffering experienced millions people long Covid. I‚Äôm really sure why, I‚Äôve definitely noticed lately. gonna argue masks could prevented this, need also explain masks work countries. saw someone yesterday argue South Korea proof masks work, implying masks literally reason contained virus, anything else.

When obsess much masks, distracts us measures actually effective, hard implement. masks plenty cases, packed casinos, restaurants, airplanes. absurd. Good see 6 pm curfew working /s Again, covax pool money funded rich countries buy vaccines bulk poorer countries.  one donating vaccines covax, Canada holding anything them.  taking vaccines allowed to. 

I‚Äôm suggesting Canada generous, Canada purchased 10 times vaccines require.  destroyed. donated.  world fully vacinated year next year. get least it. would block that, would get zero pfizer. knows would pfizer factory UK. Probably big brother (USA) Best luck! Please show US lied banning exports I‚Äôve critical mask mandates effectiveness...but that‚Äôs dumb. city allowed impose mask mandate state removes one place? partner already them? said exact word read headline, annoying.
Do think shame stay home. want shame Mayor Governor something. Surprise one cares. got bubble went rural town would se people whatever want. Great news. parents 50 live knowing they‚Äôre protected bring immense comfort that? many people would qualify then? Mexico, yes, Canada standard. way people India, China Philippines several countries Canadians. I‚Äôve looking details storage requirements J&amp;J vaccine. Key vaccination elderly without knowledge access internet getting vaccinated regular doctor appointments. ‚Äúreluctant‚Äù segment. family doc tell really need spot change mind. Thanks sharing! I'll try CVS Walgreens near UK.. everyone ignored it, need hotel system One 3 vaccines proven efficacy 90%

Novavax would also 90% trials encounter original strain (like Pfizer/Moderna/Sputnik trials happened earlier), UK SA variants. stand Vladimir. Since distilled essence great leader manly virus withstand. timeline first Moderna shot was:

Headache: started 6 hours after, ended woke next morning

Chills: felt 12 hours shot, went bed shortly after

Fatigue: chills - could usual tiredness work though

Fever/nausea/everything else: didn‚Äôt Oh. US can. Gotcha. lol ok. you‚Äôre one people nose hanging guess. would AZ say yes export ban based contract? giving vaccine away without making profit. seem philanthropic. deliver vaccine customers equally oldest every customer nation get first?

So sudden nationalism? Maybe free wanted got pressured UK government. anyone guesstimate might finally happen Texas? want shot bad course I'm waiting turn.  It‚Äôs common courtesy me. again, live mask mandate months months I‚Äôm used masked people 100% everywhere go. vast majority experts would agree near point. person viewpoint careful consideration self interest shown need come terms we're never going free COVID

We already come terms that. never goal returning normal, 10% vaccination 1600 deaths well beyond acceptable number majority especially experts. adults vaccinated (well ones want it) reached point everything prevent start get back sense normalcy. may minor things may need done numbers get lowest, part reasonable expectation. talking 3 months could prevent countless deaths. also talking going baseball game. really damn hard give going baseball game 3 months? full lockdown. damn baseball game. got old real test certificate test did, could literally edit PDF 10 seconds print ideal situation, more-infectious samesy risk variant might actually helpful we're endgame.

By standard, reopening everything quickly might actually helpful well? Keep talking  mean 2 things: 1) like things US, big states actually get fair share ANYTHING! 2) anti vax, State Alaska enough takers! idea someone else would locked early BS, we‚Äôd locking every 3 years Ebola, Zika, etc.

I'm extremely scared this, try that. It‚Äôs really great scale individual it‚Äôs stupid gets applied way often. It‚Äôs really valid population level exactly *because* outliers like you. Thank you, simple that. probably people criticized it, absolutely prevailing narrative. criticized lot things (including vaccine-related, like anything logistics front), saw across-the-aisle support ""America-first"" vaccines general premise Operation Warp Speed, example. opinion made paid attention all, whatsoever, besides reading pessimistic headlines never following up. 

Florida Georgia completely open since July last year without mask mandates right around average US terms deaths per million. Opening lead waves death restrictions keeping things closed barely stopped anything. yes, saying 80% two weeks 2nd shot, quote posted said moderna ""A vaccine effectiveness 50.8 percent found 14 days first dose. Vaccine effectiveness 92.1 percent beyond first 14 days"" meaning, 2 weeks, 90% anyways, numbers Healthline using, dec 2020. little outdated. getting much better data israel uk pfizer vaccine, they're finding 85-90% 3 weeks one dose. since pfizer moderna similar, likely significant difference one dose.

and dont mistake saying one dose need, two dose still needed variants two dose likely provide longer immunity one dose would, much longer? thats unknown. What's weird feeling?

Pride country relatively selfless thing?

I felt while. Won‚Äôt trust anything country birth, learning Aralsk-7 cases. I'm trying callous, pragmatic. frankly, I'm end financial tether months slow rolling destroy me, truth told. millions like there. think need accept level risk shield financially vulnerable vulnerable disease getting vaccinated quickly. seem rising Macedonia US good vaccinating folks needs ramp up, many world waiting US save them. supply think somewhere around end April, US excess vaccines remove export restrictions US made vaccines go countries. situation vastly different now, way says sets different tone.

Yeah, WA rollout chaos (refresh madness!) otherwise going pretty quickly. looks like maybe Spokane area slow use doses dose utilization stagnant. say Spokane stories around mass vaccination clinics I‚Äôm sure multiple causes. 

To fair, could take every dose AK hand King County still wouldn‚Äôt enough. little vaccine hesitancy take longer frenzy subside here. 10% couple months ago (and far would Trump re-election, since clear administration distribution plan kind), progress better progress.

That said, daily vaccination count still going every day, 10% going start snowball coming weeks.  believe Polis said medical practices giving can‚Äôt ask ID (may wrong). makes sense wouldn‚Äôt control FEMA. Link? I'm relatively thin male 6'5"" - little fat entire body moderate amount muscle always come overweight BMI 26. great scale people like me. think mostly done abundance caution current vaccine work. Mid April demand fall cliff cdc biden declare herd immunity victory. EU administered around 40 million doses total EU exported 25 million doses February alone. exports moronic large sole reason supply problems. yet Anglican media tries paint reality upside like EU hoarding vaccines them. EU's fault selfish enough. Anything else Anglican lies.  US beg Plaquenil? never even effective right? One relatives lives France estimate gave he'd get vaccinated spring 2022. Hoping move little bit knows... hate got sick. least sounds repentant called former self ‚Äújackass‚Äù ~3000 frontline medical workers vaccinated. First dose far. First 30lbs keto alone

The rest keto + OMAD. I‚Äôm goal weight I‚Äôm back keto.

Plus got dog. wife walking death. Yeah science!

It's tough (especially since somehow managed politicize fucking virus, least US), science came end delivered multiple new vaccines record time. top that, proving validity mRNA vaccines hopefully lead better vaccines diseases road. Tell 30k dead florida far, 150 dying every day there. mind :) 32 y. o. dude office 75% covid. 

I actually tried calling way that. confirmed cvs went vaccines went pharmacist. Went like this:

""Hi... Weird question, a--""

""Wait list? Sure do!""

Gave name/DOB/phone #. Seemed page 4 (30 names/ea) list. pretty quick. deal stop appts 5pm. Give people hour show up, start calling 6pm. get called hour get cvs. able get roommate list well. CO teachers large in-person whole time Yeah, I'm ok month two slower getting sick. Fuck suggesting people get sick ""end faster"". We're literally talking weeks now, years. Slow roll bit. Yep. Amateurs. 

/s Walmart's system long cancelled day. go, Rusty Shackleford? I'm pharmacy administering vaccine. standby list. I'm getting 100 people added daily. Yet received 200 doses J&amp;J far. I'd much rather stupid list that's taking far much time add people to. wish appointment system could keep going whatever speed could manage. Currently 10-30 day. 5 us qualified administer vaccine could probably handle 100 day. states corporate rules hamstringing us. much doses left Astrazeneca allowed export UK? Texas, federal government: ""Boo big government! follow rules!""

Austin, state government: ""Yeah, boo bigger government! make rules, too!""

Texas, Austin: ""Wait, work like that!"" additional vaccinations per day, many J&amp;J, increase overall daily vaccination rate, overall vaccinated population rate. asked ID FEMA site went to, I'm sure state administered spots different procedures. think infrastructure. see bottleneck requirements along clunky registration systems. I've seen mom get confused email. lot elderly people challenges navigating technology unfamiliar system.
Numbers would huge opened first come first serve like flu shot. know supply concerns soon fixed. opened would black Friday style lines every pharmacy. There's sociopathy, there's different viewpoint. thing deadlier is, treatment available, if, might think differently. not, don't. different opinion, respect that.

But point, quickly now, need come terms we're never going free COVID, ""done"" it. People still die. That's true open things 100% shut 100%. There's level acceptable risk loss somewhere middle, going do, even though human can't help feel sorry (like me) lose someone love thing.

Life moves on. Canada 9 million doses arms end March.

They currently massive surge vaccines expectation every adult first shot June, likely sooner.

That almost 500 million doses order year.

Slow start, Canada going forward.

Shots go Mexico. Hypertension covered California high risk . purposely left list know actually. might work visa inside passport. Covid bad risk group one unknown medical issues could co-morbidity. risk group dangerous, us category still dangerous much. Either way getting infected isnt you, people come contact at-risk people come contact with. Even effect directly might vector leads old person, obese person dying. many pissed people selfish anti-american Florida. old people vaccinated (their still millions them) even risk people havent even begun get vaccinated yet. cases blown proportion personally 3 dead family members several others going dealing repercussions rest lives, would absolutely say bad media portrays unless watch FOX news. context, thing. agreement purchase them. back out, still owe money.

And also may paid front now. NovaVax.  Unless point terms payment Pfizer Moderna Canada. speaks like true 'Murican: self-centered, entitled, zero empathy.

""I'm vaccinated, family vaccinated. Fuck everyone else, reopen country enjoy life again""  Lol AMERICA people act like long-term effects unique virus? Pretty much disease cause long-lasting complications. Uh, no. Considering people going baseball game also aware it? Yeah, that‚Äôs kinda like saying drunk driver shouldn‚Äôt fault getting hit another drunk driver. less likely able treat kind diseases. 

plus first world pharmaceutical corporations notorious dumping failed products poorer countries. Staying home also doesn‚Äôt completely protect you. It‚Äôs already messy moment government decides one life worth another. Honestly ingrained Brazilian culture ignore government. many blame Bolsanaro. Yes bumbling idiot could Fauci leader tens millions Brazilians would completely ignore guidance go business like pandemic ongoing. Hey buddy, it‚Äôs lives lost. Canada poorly US would far worse. whole point it, flatten curve could use hospitals, develop therapeutics vaccines.

Only 13k extra deaths, could far worse without action.

Remember... **SOMEBODY** last. **#fucking gottem** Children 14 immune lock down? 10 year old saw 10% life lockdown like two-bit crook. Good job  stop new strains??? stop spread. hard concepts grasp. wife immunocompromised getting second dose Friday. looking forward enjoying Black Widow theaters come May 7th Yup, exactly. US loves promoting free market restriction-free capitalism, follow rules. Blocking vaccines leaving country, even though there's contract place... Well, there's nothing free market. It‚Äôs journalist asked question. Joe got back, believe not. Trump gonna hook Clorox. state essential workers prioritized. That's right buddy, reality whatever want objective truth. Fact checking smucks thinks facts exist. dinner go ice cream behave finish veggies. Bloomberg deplatformed spreading conspiracy theories. So, 100M already vaccinated, 100M way, sounds like, using 275M number, 75M short. excess. Good know ! Thanks info :D aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet I‚Äôm seeing surplus practice we‚Äôre trumpeting one. Cool Lol, OK. India - actually sharing right countries - without anything near surplus. everyone deserves vaccine - rich nations. done before, 12 years ago H1N1. every year flu shot.

Ontario getting pharmacies involved that‚Äôs distribute flu shot. news.

Yes, rollout fine 300k nationally day absolutely attainable. get positive test, information automatically sent contact tracers call within day. take New York? incite people wear mask? much people confuse freedom well well wearing simple mask. handled horribly justify it. not?  Maybe wait us got vaccine stupid questions like asked. think people back work sooner take scientifically proven precautions (everyone wearing masks, social distancing, etc)or say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù whatever least inconvenient us. seem like smart person. Less spread means people back work. us pitching together community (crazy) takes, even it‚Äôs little annoying, actually help people you‚Äôre using talking point.

Are really worried people convenient counterpoint? personally done help disadvantaged community get back work? I‚Äôll wait Looking graph vaccinations EU see growth speed all. It‚Äôs seams same. Could please link source claims? yeah, I'm Ensemble1 trial too, hope unblinded month. think I'm test group, pretty obvious signs (fever fatigue), sure hoped fool. you? point really matter. We're getting back lives one way another Except doesn‚Äôt. Ca much slower group Awesome news! realize people sub generally overly fearful type attend large events (even normal times), damn sure games packed!  Right? Pretty much best. think right. Honestly, way could found article Googling term quotes. pretty much relevant one coronavirus. lot people made staying home living fear identity. It‚Äôs morons say ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù point belief system rather than...you know, following science. 

I call alt left.

I basically disappeared face earth leaving big city life middle nowhere(s) I‚Äôm ready go back normal.  schools open since August Florida, that's open normally. Parents opt online 75% students person district. Masks required parents choosing online option want kids wear masks others feeling safe person masks required students vaccinated.

So vaccination needed schools open, schools go back normal operations, students person masks required, would be. shilling unsympathetic billionaire ever get old? astounded many people willing constantly relentlessly reject reality order defend someone would put meat grinder made even single dollar profit.

You either intentionally misunderstanding arguments made need remedial reading comprehension classes yesterday. IMO still weird thing say. Vaccines generally effective preventing fight against. say ""I'd rather thing opposed immunity"" weird. Loved Yuuup. state teams ""delivered"" dashboard, wildly lower ""distributed"", especially start postmarking surge deliveries, hit state yet. still believe frontline essential workers vaccinated everyone else.

Such brave position know looks like articles reading change houston arizona brazil 

Like literally cut paste changes location exact wording article that's amazing. news outlets this?? (especially good hear J&amp;J trial participant - getting unblinded within month whoooo!) What'll harder reach vaccination levels ""underserved communities."" 

The issue many communities refuse vaccines anyway. learned much masks know N95 protect properly worn. Wear one stay home scared. Beats ordering people around demanding follow safety theater protocol. starting fall polls. going loose majority young people‚Äôs support. hope it‚Äôs long term trend. Even means AFD sticks around little longer. We're back, baby. Nobody asked single thing came contact with.

I could tell nearly 100 percent certainty got Covid building supt. probably entered half dozen apartments spreading Covid. Nobody asked anything. can't even figure would tell. Hey US, remember needed somewhere land planes 9/11? kind platitudes easy say won‚Äôt work reality. people want governments care first countries, especially it‚Äôs related deadly virus. Exactly. It‚Äôs simple math. knows three vaccines resistant future mutations eventually develop. 

That it‚Äôs ethical thing it‚Äôs early bonus political brownie points Biden administration. government gets hands-on thing it'll quadruple price lot single issue voters comes vaccine. I‚Äôd vote Hitler wants get vaccine arms vs beloved candidate doesn‚Äôt. 

That‚Äôs hyperbole, course, think directionally correct large part voting population. COVID issue matters.

Any politician wants keep job figure out. obviously countries invested capability going take care citizens first

Especially countries hit hardest!

Like US. Hey could send US tax-paying American expats Germany would appreciate it. going vaccinated anytime soon German government. Alaska announced vaccine Utah begin April first, It‚Äôs going fast. like us Mexico! Yup. mean, vaccine deep freezer starts sounding alarm can't keep leave door open couple seconds long, good discipline many people getting often, strict guidelines next dose open it, get get freezer shut time.  takes training practice move stuff in/out/around freezers effectively. mention significant power, indoor conditioned space (too humid, aka HVAC air, get full ice build really really fast - can't self thaw like home freezer obvious reasons). need reliable power, backup freezer, etc. Brazil‚Äôs health system falling apart due emergent variants causing reinfections hospitalizations young people bad USA network show?? don‚Äôt watch cable don‚Äôt think so. confirm Bali get worked singular anecdotes zero supporting data. want to, that's prerogative. 

To answer question, yes think infinite non-vaccine related potential causes death would likely vaccine causing death Eyoooo know I've heard friends several stories pharmacies this, called around got list called back immediately day. possible Publix near facing dispose doses. states holding back 2nd doses first? seems bone headed point, can't help notice number people 1st shot 2nd really close number vaccines shelves?

You see, nobody wants that, fact, countless people option. know really hard understand self centered, people actually care people dying. know cannot expected everyone stay home. responsible thing restrict needless activities promoting responsible behavior like wearing mask.

I know, hard someone like get head around. think thought someone might actually looking good others baffling idea you. Yet actually people looking do. scared. actually care people dying. Again, know concept really fucking hard someone like understand. Yet try empathy life fellow human beings might actually start understand everyone thinks massive fucking self centered moronic douchebag.

Yep, ad hominem attack. UK currently one Covid vaccine production facility running. facility small really designed support single local market, abs reason capable producing vaccines UK government paid significant upgrades order produce vaccine. money supplied summer giving time work given understanding first doses would UK only, otherwise would point UK taxpayer giving money. happened we‚Äôd joining bun fight rest world vaccines produced huge global site Europe things would even worse. 

I know suits people‚Äôs narrative blame UK here, comparing small local production facilities designed domestic market essentially paid markets government, large scale global production facility happens located EU, could easily exist elsewhere disingenuous. Even EU receive vaccines AZ UK, would drop ocean.

The UK manufacturing Novavax, understanding invested significantly development/manufacturing vaccine exports distributed novavax sees fit. vaccine approved ready shipped tomorrow, UK would stop it. Live midwest. Went pharmacy counter last night asked 10mins later two early thirty year olds vaccinated; spouse.

Conclusion never hurts ask. hours though ~530pm. mother got covid vaccinated Pfizer one month later. pretty rough symptoms first shot (bad hangover basically) felt fine second. places could argue better suffer brutal inhumane lockdowns get permission live lives again. Also valid. Still disagree tho big hurry create another virus spike anyway? Pretending pandemic isn‚Äôt going make over. fact, drag longer.

And look FAQ question ‚ÄúWho report VAERS?‚Äù

The answer starts ‚ÄúVAERS accepts reports anyone.‚Äù

It‚Äôs place centralizing reports assumed unverified possibly unrelated, may related. CDC, FDA, others mine trends follow ups needed drill details validate information deem necessary. Agree, I'm Mexico even though parents already got it, brothers last group able get probably last year, US starts selling would able get earlier. Makes sense, would still get second shot...  Obesity (BMI BMI works?

Also wonder they'd handle people low end overweight BMI due muscle. Like I'm 6'2"" 195 lbs exactly 25 BMI would never able convince doctor I'm high risk anything.  cases vaccinations going expire go waste used day, people show appointments. end day uncommon places look someone, anyone give doses to, keep going waste. I'm sorry loss. Stay strong stay safe friend. taking 2 years drive grocery store. 10% per 2 1/2 months, that‚Äôs long would take vaccinate country. would suing city imposing restrictions, businesses imposing own. RemindMe! 2 months

I'm optimistic too, April 30th bold estimate. Hasn‚Äôt AG Indicted crime? jail? 350M Americans. 100M administered, 250M left vaccinate...sounds like surplus sure, get that. problem cold chain. hard move small quantities vaccine needs refrigerated extremely low temperatures specialized equipment.

You mass vac clinic move doses mass, making distribution efficent.

However J&amp;J vaccine transported standard refridgerator trucks. going locations described. Pfft. Governor Brian Kemp Georgia sued mayors mask restrictions way AG threatened it. sued mayor Atlanta! get saying. saying might simple delivered doses = ready vaccinate. think reporting probably lagging reporting true vaccination numbers return overstating amount available vaccines. makes sense. Bloomberg says states 70-85% range percent supply used, US average 74.9%. 

Georgia lowest continental US 64% used 1.37 million unused doses versus 2.41 million administered.

Also Bloomberg puts Oregon 77% used 1.238 million administered, sure discrepancy coming there. explicitly invited vaccinated folks, medical professionals. Around 8.5 mill vaccinated Brazil. Population @ 211 mill++.  ivermectin

That‚Äôs new one Georgia efficiently distributing 65% vaccines, top state distributing 85%.

That's incredibly large difference talking millions doses. It‚Äôs MINNESOTA, MINNESOTA.

You INTENTIONALLY missing point. know it, know it.

Stop it. It‚Äôs like was, -693 bad drop  Dec 20, vaccine became available.

On Jan 20, USA completed 16.5m vaccinations. 16.5m/month.

Currently, 50 days new government 93million. 66m/month.

100m 100 days achieved, hard attribute smooth ramping graph either Would likely run formulation issues without making material changes vaccines (i.e. they're made different stuff, putting things together may good extended periods time). Would still need probably two separate jabs could given time. start immigrants? deserve need protection too. go amusement park someone rollercoaster loses phone trying take selfie, phone may hit head kill me.

Imagine comparing pandemic taken half million American lives less year time. Go ahead. time gets system we‚Äôll late spring stuff (hopefully) looking fine anyway. 

Knock out, big guy. That‚Äôs anything works. listed bunch names study MINNESOTA. says Minnesota LOT, like 25 times lot. 

I‚Äôm asking anything stop lying overtly. It‚Äôs big ask falsely represent single state study comprehensive analysis everything came sturgis rally.

You could accurately said, ‚ÄúAccording study, one person Minnesota died sturgis rally‚Äù would fine, that‚Äôs did. lied. misrepresented you‚Äôre pretending don‚Äôt understand. Adding bunch names doesn‚Äôt change MINNESOTA.

Stop, stop. pragmatic. vaccinate every woman, man child world, leave reservoirs virus continue mutate come back.

The richer nations world need work together avoid this. everyone's interest make sure everyone planet able willing gets vaccine.  Hypertension qualifier California's guidelines. [Here's (you may scroll heading ""vaccinating higher risk""). eligible vote? Yes. vote? Yes. Next?

The thing that's mentioned old people hug grandchildren. üòÇüòÇüòÇ shifted goalposts. Pray shift further. Usually sorts supply eligibility issues deal with. tends plenty supply available unless something goes wrong like bad batch years back. Even then, eligibility put place regions felt squeeze. heard rumors early on, inmates sharing drinks things try get sick, hoping would release prisoners reduce congestion.    Dr. Feigl-Doom getting roasted likes Prof. Balloux Angie Rasmussen life-giving.    become dominant US next ~3 weeks. seems likely vaccination rate prevent spiking infections, everywhere else, cities states reopening early make difficult. turns quite lot then. I‚Äôm thankful fatalities lot fewer 1 million let alone 2 million. pandemic bad expected be, things considered. already thing. Interstate vaccine tourism really problem imo (for reasons others pointed above), I'm concerned international vaccine tourism time population even vaccinated yet.

I personally know least 11 people -- none US citizens -- flown abroad get vaccinated Florida mostly Texas now. Word got really easy get vaccine small towns Texas, entire families flying Houston driving couple hours get CVS/Walmart/HEB vaccines available. proof residency citizenship needed. fly back home day two later come back 3-4 weeks second dose. Logistics issue, timing second dose isn‚Äôt set stone. Many guidelines extended two weeks. Obviously know term. I‚Äôm saying someone would iq 50 able infer double vaccinated means thing. think meant two different vaccines completely illogical What? mean decent table vaccination?

Last checked France, one countries mentioned last checked, given one dose little 4% population, it‚Äôs country 67 million. Logic would dictate people getting seriously ill aren‚Äôt vaccinated, variants literally definition serious adverse event/important event/etc. mean expected happen. don‚Äôt think vaccines FDA approved people 16 son 12, I‚Äôve waiting data! guess that‚Äôs true. Idk city/town he‚Äôll get shot though. finds opening somewhere rural, excess doses, may taking shot someone needs more. know it‚Äôs business really, hoping there‚Äôd science back claims phrase you‚Äôre looking fully vaccinated.

BMI adults, kids, percentile tables often used children. Regardless, welcome Georgia COVID rollout plan: ambiguous, confusing, counterintuitive. 

On BMI: need convince anyone. BMI qualify. There's another document explicitly defines overweight BMI 25. goes back point silly constraining criteria. Elite athletes strength sports may 8-10% body fat 26_ BMI. It‚Äôs surreal see anyone encouraging caution getting downvoted oblivion.  can't find articles Trump criticized vaccine policy. provide them?

Here's searched: think they're saying 'fully vaccinated' indicate doses two weeks protected. I‚Äôm ignoring anything. suggest stay inside shelter place, you‚Äôre concerned covid. better hope so.

That Europeant politicians protect citizen harm. Lockdowns worked New Zealand, three times now. death rate 5 per million. say that's we're isolated island, death rate French Polynesia, lock down, 500 per million. 

Also lockdowns NZ kill economy, saved it. barely increase unemployment. virus means people feel safe packing malls, stadiums nightclubs. That‚Äôs good idea.  turn 49 15th. still bit wait. It‚Äôs fun first explaining patient what‚Äôs going happen, watching face inevitably say ‚Äú....and YOU‚ÄôRE going it?!?‚Äù think procedure uncomfortable enough, female probably pretty embarrassing additionally stressful. first one do, I‚Äôm pretty sure actually nervous patient though! ended making inappropriate joke, nice broke tension.

A tale fateful prick. Almost whole south america using Sinovac also true. 

If list countries South America use Sputnik V none other, list would much shorter. countries population using mix. hard figure why: providers supply issues. There's sane person truly believes Florida highest death toll. makes look kind pathetic much trash willing spew avoid answering simple yes question. 

Do truly believe Florida highest death toll predicted would? respond yes no, save conspiracy theory rambling. behave unvaccinated 28 days second shot. 28 days pass, CDC recommends this: Isnt reasonable steps opening back up? Eric Feigl-Ding never taken seriously again. Frankly, deserves fate worse that.

For don‚Äôt know, he‚Äôs loudest critic schools opening U.S. Meanwhile, moved family Austria last fall kids could go school person. I‚Äôm surprised Georgia‚Äôs death rate isn‚Äôt higher since reopened early Icky? Lemme go binge brb Really? Source assertion? There's eviction crisis scarcely imaginable proportions looming, friend. People can't pay rent, bills, mortgages, anything; millions lost jobs. that's even factoring 2021/2022 market crash. ""Best healthcare"" would help would mean fastest vaccination treatments available ""best healtcare"" could prevent dying Covid-19 obviously case.

Vaccinating teenagers Israel Alaska people older 80 Europe vaccinated definitely allocation minimizes overall deaths. anyone successfully gotten extra vaccine Dr. B signup list? (the one texts you)? They‚Äôre trying Brazil understand everyone thread focusing day distribution administration numbers. know there's reporting lag distributing one day mean go arm day anyway. 
 
As I've recently learned, people actually know around It‚Äôs over. ignoring numbers? like first one least plausible. Though higher rates HIV infection would take months prove issue, side effect itself, like mechanism, would show within two months.

What would mechanism ""Inflammation, auto reactive antibodies persistence expressed immunogen"" showing within two months, showing that?

These things find months, side effects present certain amount time.

I like thinking, again, I'm saying side effects. clearly side effects.  now, certain point we'll ok minor risk take off.

I think many people disagre that. they're saying we're ramping vaccines, vaccinated people keep wearing sure, stop spread, also optics reasons people *do* need wear mask vaccinated yet feel bad wearing them. want people see wearing mine assume okay wear y'know? 

I'm wearing mine solidarity point. months whatever, they're going closet. 

I wait people. correct answer. showtime choice even pandemic. see hotels leisure travel destinations look like *right now* making excellent pace it. Like said, keep sign soon turn. Ah see bad. Well lucky you. How'd qualify? Yeah...I equipment still crossed legs watching üòÜ since people money travel

lololol people getting vaccinated regardless texas. agree lot Texas's decision making really understand comments like this.

In months anyone wants vaccine one deaths time low trending downward going summer virus getting crushed. going happen, okay believe vaccines. think kind rhetoric actually helps us accomplish anything. They‚Äôve 1b well month now. Fauci deserve B tier? thread. Apparently positivity %s fucked awhile. Some, like Texas Georgia, counting tests way made positivity %s higher. least California reporting way potentially made positivity %s lower.

Very weird.

The bottom line places antigen tests ""probable ""positive counted ""probable"" cases, counted negative test all. Lack healthcare facilities factor well. Much less capacity AK pretty much state. it‚Äôs another one Frankfurt deliveries Q3 uncomfortable going grocery store wearing many, types masks deem fit.

Then I'm sure find somewhere provide curbside pickup. delivery service comes door. Texas, opened vaccines teachers preexisting conditions- I‚Äôm already vacced. 

The school district work set big event last weekend provide vaccines- apparently couldn‚Äôt fill appointments lot no- shows, kept calling emailing us begging us come. survive, pump full benzos/opioids VA get addicted send merry way. Yep. Watching guys face never fun. I‚Äôve couple times... usually try get male colleague instead sake patient drink antibodies?

Yes, babies acquire level immunity certain things drinking mother's milk. assume would case young kid. 

The issue they're short lived body. real part immunity memory cells pump new antibodies virus detected. Sadly drinking antibodies  live PA dose already. using example. got shot NY, bmi exactly 30. There's verification either, I'd argue easy awhile remotely fall category, lots sites open appointments.

Hopefully supply increases means it'll open everyone soon. previous president raked coals America First approach vaccines, always best choice. Funny see everyone fall line Biden says it. mom 80 Kaiser never contacted get it. get county‚Äôs site, got doses now. Never heard Kaiser doctor. Thats good hear, hopefully everyone get shot asap I'm sorry hear state's inept governor. governors think Covid hoax deserve recalled.

Meanwhile holding State's administration promises well bet raise hell don't. Yet Pinal county AZ they‚Äôve opened 55+ can‚Äôt get one literally save life. Whole vaccine process still CF.

(Edit autocorrect) Massage move often! Yeah, were, know goes. clapped NHS-nurses too, pay cut (inflation-adjusted). maybe 2022 Pretty sure hypertension specifically excluded conditions qualify take care first 

does usa wait till everyone vacinated 16 year old? They're higher risk though, eligible. seems like upset prioritizing risk also upset they're dropping prioritization. restrictions exempt from? still supposed follow precautions vax. Huh? So? Oh yeah. big states going early. Rural Mississippi local government still thinks COVID big deal might luck bit. Ah, sounds frustrating. live Florida, people really ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu, don‚Äôt want vaccine‚Äù type. It‚Äôs frightening year. Europe one oldest populations therefore highest needs fast vaccination.

Vaccinating teenagers Israel Alaska EU even everybody older 80 vaccinated costs lives. I‚Äôm vaccinated, order went away I‚Äôd issue wearing grocery shopping, I‚Äôd probably stop wearing walking around city parks. Oklahoman here. parents (60+ comorbidities) shots, (36m) wife (34f) comorbs younger brother (34m essential worker) first. amazing. Oklahoma kicking ass. work Walmart heard anything anything us vaccine related. far know, I'm going use PPTO go get vaccinated since dates times available area get vaccine times work. making miss working Target (among reasons course). almost whole South America using Sputnik V

almost whole south america using vaccines Sputnik V also true statement. countries know using Sputnik V alone. Argentina one. Wow, thought joking part read article. right, I'm wrong. I'm digging articles recall reading, sure I'll able find it. Well California, governor saying literally constraint point everyone access vaccines literal supply vaccines themselves. think unreasonable say expect eligible kind supply President saying end May. Higher rates HIV infection could certainly take months show.

Inflammation, auto reactive antibodies persistence expressed immunogen quite obviously take long time show effects. 

For mostly things worry me. Pfizer Moderna studied this? even? *know* long immunogen sticks around *know* long nucleotides stick around? least impressed nurses taking care way out. Thank summary. *oh fuck's sake, never end*. one needs crappy Astrazeneca anymore.

Other world needs excellent, cheap easy transport vaccine? Signed local Walgreens Monday called TODAY!!!! got vaccinated. Well, president denied 70 million doses Pfizer vaccine december. that, infrastructure fast vaccination rollout North South Dakota would like word... honesty, things worry really gives shit theme park. Yep, states (or month) move criteria almost everyone qualified. It'll allow get lot shots arms without overwhelming surge come eligibly requirements dropped. European people (or part thereof) regretting utter failure EU commission secure early vaccine delivery. Sounds like know quite unethical people reported relevant authorities. don‚Äôt know single person even attempted vaccine fraud. isn‚Äôt say isn‚Äôt happening, need see evidence conceding it‚Äôs major problem that‚Äôs meaningfully obstructing nationwide rollout. Yes incubation period 2-14 days, time frame could still contagious showing symptoms develop symptoms later time period up. get saying lowered likelihood, CDC's guideline seems pretty non-precise like intentionally omitting major piece information discovered would probably encourage people resist wearing masks something. people got first may need take point. checked misinformed. V stands victory. say Latin America using Sputnik V say vaccine used countries use it. 

Colombia ordering doses well Brazil ordering doses producing vaccine. Nah, help poorest countries close Canadian border. Y'all stay while. 100% time definitely plenty neighbors complaining ""how slowly"" roll been, refusing take pandemic seriously whole time. area ranks near top vaccine roll out. 
I guess speaking sense entitlement many Americans have. Public health restrictions impact virus, slowing spread therefore prolonging pandemic. point experts world leaders making one year ago.  Totally fair. wanting shed light side here.

Just curious. always felt way? always feel way? normal circumstances, flu kill lot people. always wear mask flu season? going forward Covid gone? I‚Äôm guessing haven‚Äôt worn mask whole life.

When okay wear mask opinion?

No.vaccines. involves needle, mouth, right? Canada need doses donated.  simply need USA allow exports/ waive clauses contracts Pfizer Moderna reserves US doses US (yes, clear difference). 

US surplus vaccines donated countries trouble procuring vaccines themselves, countries G7. That's brutal. assume trajectory improving either? Some, like Texas Georgia, counting tests way made positivity %s higher.

That's odd, given states would expect least California reporting way potentially made positivity %s lower.

Same overcounting. read single thing reason masks? really point freaking year still understood damn thing masks? DR.

Yeah, ok. also think people able risk drunk driving own?

It never choose risk covid not. putting people risk. Cases deaths still higher majority pandemic.

Wearing mask comfortable, normal, natural. significant detriment mental health social interaction. necessary right now, people dealing it. One reason mess denial simple fact. missing mine. vaccine clearly works stopping spread pretty much live normally. said pre pandemic normal. vaccinated folks still walking petri dishes vaccines would real positive affect life would worthless. agree you, Super Bowl like 25% capacity something large fraction spectators vaccinated health care workers.

Body felt heavy tired. point, watch see happens states letting finish line. I'm stress worrying. Bracing impact still hoping works take us right back beginning. Hey, would look that, Republicans government working local levels they're Yes enough folks vaccinated yet, that's point. Worse, J&amp;J ships drug substance EU US fill finish EU see single dose unless executive order lifted. EU must allow happen. Canada Mexico need US waive export restrictions contracts, allow Pfizer Moderna use production facilities fullfill contracts countries places US.  need doses US procured themselves.

They hopefully take step 'every american' offered shot. 

The doses donate going poorer nations can't afford/have trouble procuring vaccines themselves. Countries like Canada need supply chains open up. So...North America first? Canada getting many, Mexico really needs help. get priority IMO. Maybe that's fair option, best interests. never understood Americans stupid enough think whole world putting show mess election. CDC guidelines mostly stuff like vaccinated healthcare workers quarantine exposure work, unless become symptomatic. use guideline conclude ""they saying vaccine halt transmission"" far leap, saying.

Does anyone know rules short-term visits, example I'd like enter UK plane visit family member leave \~2-3 days later? issues following quarantine rules family member's house issues getting tests needed. since quarantine 10 days, mean I'm allowed leave country via airport then? average age population? many 16 year olds live Alaska? second dose won‚Äôt drop efficacy. percentages refer results within specific trials can‚Äôt necessarily generalized population whole. Usually, they‚Äôll release confidence interval tell accurate would generalize population. that‚Äôs necessarily accurate either, since different levels different variants concern circulating different times different places. Science can‚Äôt really give us answers. It‚Äôs smartest parents go whatever time frame health care team recommended, since country‚Äôs medical professionals studied data. Zero could desired, UK cant really ne blamed pharma companies havent setup production facilities here, force to? Unfortunately government badly bungled vaccinations. daily case count state still highest nation...and bulk cases city. think great. Apparently people can't wait long. They've decided over, over. Even many vulnerable people still waiting first second shots. many people either want quit think never go back normal? us reasonable patient people talking social media? literally middle vaccinating everyone. 

There plenty things short crowding full capacity stadium next couple months chance get vaccinated. yes, also miss game. going everyone people want get vaccinated, supply start catch pharmacies doses sitting freezer.

It's hard people get vaccine little while, back side becomes easier allow walk ins. True. Selfishly double vaccinated want go Europe lol I'm TN major demand option. People want trust forces locations literally throw away. We've told healthcare workers, record, go get one. Lmao tejas unique bird Agreed    
Priority 1 be, ""Don't waste vaccine"".    
Priority 2 get needs most.   

In Australia we've managed get million doses country, kind hurts whenever read doses getting lost dumped. Someone know covid month ago took Pfizer today. Would impact them? Again, trying argue didnt answer main question. claim reply former question ""So next year rebranded cold"" ?
That ""essentially yes"" gives people impression wont dangerous that. 

And reply happen one year covid loose deadly edge become basically common cold, please reply scientific sources opinion. response restated opinion common knowledge. looking scientific sources theorize covid dangerous common cold next year. even five years. 
Thanks replies. Exactly, hence vaccines leaving UK. didnt vaccine production facilities 12 months ago paid company set two us. Lmao pessimistic osterholm ding put together Well aren‚Äôt special brave 0.2% 0.4%? Totally agree - weeks. would make sense help Canada Mexico first. right next us trade lot other. [The top US trading partners order Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, UK.](http://www.worldstopexports.com/americas-top-import-partners/) Health care workers, 60+ yes, open up.

All dumb groups like grocery workers, delivery driver etc., hard verify gums system slows down. Plus people already gaming system signing Doordash, getting shot quitting. open 60+ shots. include poorest countries absolutely.

Telling wait fully vaccinated important way save lives, probably. 100 day 5 people jabbing? That's like shot per provider every 20 minutes. 
My local pharmacy 300 lunch three people, often done early. mexican, yes please... big population justifies rape? don‚Äôt know get news people migrating western countries aren‚Äôt privileged, they‚Äôre hard working middle class people.
Honestly, don‚Äôt understand incoherent rant. Maybe go back hate school education bigotry. Good bye Yes please,
Love Canada may worth it‚Äôs possible though. Brazil‚Äôs potential spawn worse variants terrifying. said I‚Äôm inclined agree, can‚Äôt whip kind infrastructure someone like Bolsonaro would never ever allow new strains made anywhere. Legal immigrants? call Americans. Texas. article‚Äôs headline literally says word *could*. we‚Äôre leaving chance now? I‚Äôm comfortable original facts. visit doctor year checkup. chances variable vaccine cause death less chance dying suddenly completely unrelated vaccine? 

Seems like mathematical impossibility. 

The propaganda machine well oiled sub isn‚Äôt it. Context:  Yes, called COVAX time gets system we‚Äôll late spring

Depends quick get injunction, tbh. say willing get eventually. would guess substantial portion say won‚Äôt get really quite willing get talking party line now. 36% republicans may claim never get vaccinated, sounds like talk me. Zero shots enough me. Thanks though.  Canada really chose anything. Pfizer decides plant produce Canada. needs rely local government preventing export. scare EU. 'no serious side effects' Denmark still owns Greenland, right? could wrong, think they're hard up. literally said yesterday Yes, Canada already got 6 million Europe according recent article NYT. know want back there, too. There‚Äôs reason want go ‚Äúback good old days‚Äù.  think NYC confident vaccine rollout quickly they‚Äôve able scale. went Javitts Monday night, it‚Äôs really well oiled machine. billion people, think I‚Äôd give shit think ‚Äúindia rape culture‚Äù? people city countries

Like Indians moving bad thing too. western littered Indian class privileged. bad? think problem brown people better whites invited them? Doctors engineers, industrialists populations gotten lazy stolen wealth idea means desperate ambitious remember last guy said would covid easter 2020, bleach would work, hydroxy works, sun works, would vaccinated nov4th, would vaccinated end 2020, ploy etc etc stfu imagine logistics thing sure. plan change. expectations set initial delivery schedule, updates.  article does, however, plenty direct links information. Ya assume reaction means still naturally immune Covid 1 year...I find weird CDC still saying 3
Months. document seems made prior new vaccine batches announced. know several people going back work enhanced unemployment ends. would they? plenty money get spend time see fit. state Maryland still 65+ till least April, people risk conditions makes bigger chunk population press conference thinking of. says ‚Äúfirst dose‚Äù based supply it‚Äôs definitely improvement said weeks  Sure makes sense, wanted reopen school kids really good spreaders. Zero chance taking long. 

It happen April would guess. Hmm wonder many Indians migrating called ‚Äòrapist western countries‚Äô. You‚Äôre bigot &amp; racist based reddit profile n stuff say. wouldn‚Äôt bringing India‚Äôs rape culture conversation since you‚Äôre spew hate &amp; don‚Äôt want come across west vs India know decent people every country. FDA presentation Ah yes, party small gubbmint. 3 months away probably year makes difference. would surprising? done 2 weeks. would rather prioritize countries ahead America even half population even vaccinated yet, young healthy people included?

I think absolutely fuck not. aren‚Äôt risk Brazil right shit show hospitals brink collapse. exact propaganda coming arizona florida Texas months ago look CV 

Time actually use critical thinking people live Southwestern Ontario, according posted SWPH, Phase 3 runs Aug-Dec, would average Canadian citizen. Uh US didn‚Äôt approve AstraZeneca I'm even American Biden seems like really fantastic leader USA. know country divided presidency really seem care majority Americans approaches. P1. state Maryland still 65+ intends April. allow people risk conditions make bigger part population. much priority bullshit going That's word surplus would imply..... *Criminal negligence* freely gathering Americans allowed do? become authoritarian? guilt. look Germany's foreign policy, even today, see going great lengths bad guy.

Remember Pfizer vaccine originally developed Germany's BioNTech, Germany would able secure much larger share vaccine itself, chose share equally within EU. Mexico Canada obvious reasons. Then, allied nations strong in-place healthcare infrastructure weak non-existent domestic vaccine manufacturing. Read quoted statement. baseline group hospitalized patients.  Tv really lot scared death Children 16, so, cannot get vaccine need vaccine need taken calculation would reduce calculation 74 million. course immunocompromised get vaccine religious objectors. finally anti-vaxxers. Yes? US pushing Canada reopen since adding restrictions even allowing Canadians reenter, let alone Majority new cases. really something could adequately fixed pandemic. want go back years, I'll agree obviously something need fix future mistake idle capacity. even then, fixed Q1 issues, would tough sell position manufacture either Moderna Pfizer. both! Like weight lifted chest! Everyone's interest get vax everyone quick possible, obviously countries invested capability going take care citizens first Completely absurd. argue patents restricting access vaccine, production capacity storage capabilities. Even patents ignored, evidence provided show factories could even effectively manufacture (or store) created vaccines.

Accusing ""richer"" countries ""hoarding"" vaccine large swathes Europe Canada even supply ludicrous. Unless counting unfulfilled 'orders' legitimate supplies evidence suggest hoarding unfair distribution.

It's also interesting one initial countries calling suspension patents India, repeatedly donated hundreds thousands vaccines countries. I'm sure argue patents issue meet demands also donate surplus beyond that.

Either way, simply protesting alleged abuses without effectively proving existence, even capabilities groups store/produce vaccines make argument entirely irrelevant. I'm sure failure reporting agency issue initial complaint itself, core argument lacks real evidence support validity. Damn thought US UK similar numbers realize UK got bad guessed right. EU exported 30 million vaccines February, 3 million Canada, US didn‚Äôt export any. EU vaccine exporter Western world. Ok say Trumpian, murican' sure.

Over civilized world, we're already donating 5% vaccines poor, non-spreader countries.  even vaccinate people? Somebody make first move else madness go forever. Good Texas. effective vaccinate Canadian businessman travels across Canada possibly countries, comes contact people around world, Rwandan farmer interacts village surrounding area.

Yes vaccinate everyone, also consider effectively limit spread excess vaccines have. previous examples given, vaccinated mobile populations first.

Don't stoop insults make valid (if slightly flawed) point. Many lost cause, completely given yet. Oh mean border crossing. actual open borders like EU. mistake. different election result might've. Family, mostly. Can't avoid it. use nationalist loosely. consider Parent's support Trump rooted ""nationalism"" though, always point vague ""America-firstness"" called silly views. worst thing happened getting covid getting pretty quickly. clearly made think. Nah, bad NM, counties higher prevalence Native Americans got vaccine priority. result counties hit 60% initial dose ""white"" areas 10%  believe largely case across America. know, US always bad, boo hiss. Canadian, PLEASE.  June 20 announced date Ontario anyone wants one week two ago. Unfortunately, Canada made news bunch major changes Americans stuck heads.  antibodies killed gut. children get older, guts get better killing all, would effect older children. event emergency put mask first assist anyone else‚Äôs mutations likely poor countries? Source please. I'd honestly love read it. Here's third article shows wrong. December orders 200 million Pfizer ALONE. J&amp;J, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, GSK? definitely Saturday üòÖ

Honestly worth done it. amounts seem similar timeframes well.

From article;

May 2020: US paid $1.2 Billion 300 million doses ($4/dose)

June 2020: Germany, Italy, France, Netherlands paid ‚Ç¨750 million 400 million doses ($2.24/dose)

Later August 2020: EU ‚Ç¨336 million payment 300 million doses ($1.33/dose)

‚Ç¨750 Million ~ $895 Million That's probably guy would've done. 500,000 people dying statistic, anecdote... fuckin guy one, pleased. approach one great caution. Slow steady forward motion. winning strategy long haul.  Restricting guests state residents smart. states reopened fully virtually overnight see large upswings infection, transporting here. appreciate that. fucking idiot president. Share? That's word heard long time. can't universal plan there's 50 different systems need work in. Delivering vaccines backwater Appalachia whole hell lot different delivering downtown NYC. That's left states. already (should) systems place.  I'm happy moved canada amazing healthcare behind ""joke"" system US has. Imagine that. fucking hate personally mostly consideration others way knowing I'm vaccinated not. particular bother anyway. majority around 10 countries EU. Get line No, people got reading spin doctors.

It's clear understand source (or accurately read it) would huge opened first come first serve

The issue approach may generate huge lines, especially specific times day early morning evening people come back home work.

That's something want see, going super spread parties unvaccinated. Especially 50+ end standing line.

I think vaccination lines played part Israel's numbers took drop despite campaign, lot people extremely careful since start pandemic, careful leave house unnecessary ended standing around crowed hours. Thanks, need one them. Plus tax. requirements get loosed counties vulnerable areas state gets vaccinated. first goal 2M doses vulnerable areas reached Friday. next one 4M doses. Please take account \*long term facilities part. Younger people stronger response vaccines. One reason kids tested different category. Older folks definintely need second dose. saying maybe younger kids need one dose get immunity levels.

Edit add: really matters, adults need second dose need wait 14 15 days guess, reach full immunity sure. DFW isn‚Äôt open sure. even cut supply doses Honestly, think NYC getting ahead skis way reopening things faster vaccine actually rolled out.

I qualified get vaccine based underlying condition getting first shot getting second shot, going need delayed, got Covid.

I living like monk months. groceries delivered weeks end. laundry laundry room midnight avoid contact neighbors. wear minimum KN95 mask go run errand actually going rare.

The Supt. enter apartment take care repair job bathroom. wore mask. bathroom door closed worked. wore KN-95 mask. opened windows left ventilate best could taking mask left.

That took get Covid. Supt. apartment fix leak.

I later found children household quarantining school exposed. Nobody told stay quarantine too. went job like day brought side order Covid.

All reopening people actually vaccinated coming cost. even going start testing vaccines school children fall. think math.

People die decisions made ""good economy."" No. infrastructure built full double dosing. Absolute stupidity change now. J J people want 1 shot. Yup, girl passed second dose. Scary Well Trump definitely made zero effort help California all. matter states better worse, point single universal plan worked equally well everywhere Trump fucking bother busy spending entire year term golf course. production facilities ramp up, yes are. least one dose. 

If allowed get vaccines production facilities states. would done even sooner. 

In case want see numbers. low compared states. low Canada well.  Bloomberg spin doctor? Neat Brazil? USA world leader deaths cases. Wonder why? Wonder happens mutations spread here? Imagine would've happened vaccine took decade develop. Millions millions infected covid 19, 500,000 died..anecdote. Whats point He's trying play cover trump, he's bad reality whole compared previously infected booster double vaccinated? booster covid? body‚Äôs response? least two links back comments mods left comments deleting others misinformation.

:-) first shot caused arm hurt days. AFAIK people usually react strongly first shot CoVid19 before. Everybody else react 2nd shot described. (I received 2nd shot 4 weeks later). like Taiwan. They've friends Canada pandemic. point administration power legally liable something akin genocide this? Brazil Bolsanaro seem like good test case. Trump-esque denial continuing cost lives thousands endanger rest world. Even ridiculous consider got covid hospitalized (another nice Trump comp) yet maintains messaging w/ downplaying virus severity. go history monster without modern parallel (almost). Linking someone else understand source got talking points spin doctor trying make trump look qualified prove anything. Brazil might important variant likelihood Brazil variants leaders horrible stance Covid Dang! Well, sounds like due diligence, wish best luck! Man. guy sucks comprehension, math, dates. joking, right? course seemingly healthy people die suddenly. something happens commonly. like one millions people dying suddenly days vaccine would considered uncommon Sure, wait Two Weeks(tm), um, Weeks(trademark pending). heard before? Dudes baller much focus one stat another. Hospitalizations important, places, handle capacities right now. long new cases increasing, issue. words, look entire picture includes new cases deaths gradual decline. Makes sense would say yes, put that, also know Texas ask provide evidence support things stated registering. simply look information provided, decide approve you, golden out! single anecdote, millions upon millions people taken vaccine I'm totally bot downvoted spouting misinformation  states prepared? Florida West Virginia kicked ass. What's California's excuse?

How much waste there? 1%? 0.5%? 0.2%? much due equipment failures? would plan alleviated lost doses? new study indeed provides evidence virus survive long time.

However, China conducting global COVID-19 propaganda campaign, claim many things, may backed scientific evidences, mean CCP lying. put say context apply critical thinking skills instead. Remember last guy said pummeled? 

Nah. highly doubt going get 8 million doses end march. current numbers projected deliveries. POC countries barely impacted pandemic. Also India largest hub vaccine producers seems like POC countries next wave.

Everything else said good, pointing out. third wave last. people lost cause. won‚Äôt sway anyway. people could sway, lose treat like clueless children. work public health seen Pfizer vaccine administered immunocompromised without major problems. Pfizer vaccine live vaccine, therefore can't get Covid taking vaccine. Yes constantly updated. sure fuck 200 December checked right Pfizer got approved amazed ordered enough vaccines vaccine everyone twice. Okay, smart enough read headline know sensationalized. they're going cast net wide wonder initiate general availability. got first shot yesterday Say louder people back. Wish could visit Japan think come family/peer pressure. high risk category, get vaccinated. not, none family hugging you, visits, invited bbq. Well know, rtfa. amazes EU still exports vaccines. Why???

I mean, Germany kinda see still result WWII. everyone else ok there!? believe Canada get ordered states. really issue price. matter supply. production facilities states could allowed ship Canada fulfill contracts would good. need ""left overs"". Yo! come get choose put body? Russian one according independent review good may better Astra Zeneca good them. 

Sinopharm far looks fairly shithouse supposed do, undersell overdeliver. agree building trust. irks headlines read way. 

I also remember people America can't wear face masks correctly think baking soda neutralize deadly virus. Laughs American let ravage population months ago mostly Clearly working vaccines arrived states things prepared doses went waste. proper plan top would alleviated issue. may aware this, Biden president February statement made, made press conference Biden fauci announcing secured enough doses make happen.

I know calendars hard people can't read, I'll give time learn month comes February learn Biden took office coincidence right 2nd shot? nothing see move along... Bullshit, people better part last year weren‚Äôt comparing. making fun other, got downright hostile, especially people Europe North American bitching they‚Äôre marginally better. Absolutely embarrassing tone deaf pandemic. That‚Äôs article says. says March 1st December. Im sure came 900 million that‚Äôs accurate all. around 200. Bruh 85 yo dementiad grandma gfs 60-something uncle going chemo haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet let‚Äôs talk first giving away doses  Honestly think weird theatres seen no-no. I've several times one safest activities terms following covid guidelines. I've reserved seating automatically blocks surrounding seats distancing. mostly contact getting tickets. usually redeemed kiosk. That's total vaccine order instead potentials negotiated could requested, including contracts ""may request additional 500 million"" Pfizer trump admin refused October December, leaving original 100 million ordered Pfizer trump.

Basically misrepresenting numbers make look like trump actually us track, despite go looking clear purely arrangement future date US right make request. trump actually made request, we'd track 600 million doses (that's combined total contracts placed us able request last day office) instead 200 million ordered.

Stop excusing failure  vaccinated yet people can't get vaccinated health issues. Plus even healthy people dying ones die get permanent lung scarring cardiovascular issues. really really hope right!

Is like reason studying kids already? add. US similar contract Pfizer. believe US Pfizer production facility. Canada gets Pfizer doses Belgium. New Zealand secured enough doses done end year too. we‚Äôre giving left doses neighbouring pacific island countries. I'm pretty sure I'm brigaded bots. went like -5 -56 span like 10 minutes. honestly mind-blowing. stated indisputable fact replies basically yelling ""fake news!!"" you.

My expectations factual discussion already low given subreddit overlap /r/politics, pathetic even subreddit. signed certificate retardation shortly. Canada needs badly. Please help Canada. Nah, great data, we'll still wait results ongoing stage 3 trials going right now, allow weeks FDA review. late summer fall approval. funny! I'm US, I'm told get end line, too... Schools open normally fall regardless. Good see people put power run show able actually job accurate predictions :) states told like 9 months advance would responsible deploying it. know say dumped states manage vaccinate ~60% US flu flu season. monumentally complicated task sort out.  get statistically people die. Therefore people receive vaccine fact die abruptly unrelated issues seems bizarre. vulnerable vaccinated could open schools anyway (and states already have?). Israel kids 15 vaccinated schools open numbers still going down.

US great vaccination campaign, couple months vaccination open all. issues. Second shot three weeks. majority new cases majority active cases?

As far know it‚Äôs majority new infections number EU countries majority active cases. Active cases mean say dominant variant. Something account majority new infections take actually become dominant variant 

If majority active infections countries, please cite source asshole country, Class 101. sure hope ‚Äúevery American‚Äù includes high risk 16 year old. protection, no. 

Protection kicks 12-14 days 1st shot even 50-60% initially, slowly ramping full protection week 2cond shot.  Lol get second spreading fear without knowing happened vaccinating rest us US first Joe? ....to country highest bid. think speaks general demographic users here

Young, non-essential, people? India already efficacy single dose. prevent hospitalization death, key ending whole thing. going admit wrong age limits lowered June? not, point post? would sell surplus best part. Every day gets better out. Everyday immunity gets better everyday people getting vaxed immunities getting better. 

Every day tip scale little favor war. every day get closer winning. downvoted correct, British variant dangerous younger people. also especially dangerous pregnant women.

This according Israeli info, UK variant 90% cases since late January. also observed Denmark bad livers ticking time bombs like this. they're gradually degrading three Mariners fans hurt comment. Abstract

Diversity supply chain people working interface public, still haven‚Äôt able get shot, even despite 50 years old (makes 70% deaths)? fuck people right? hold 4 weeks till eligible vaccination? Lets open forced interact maskless people put health even risk pay bills. 

Selfish prick. Vaccine diplomacy! Granted, said time result vaccine out. didn‚Äôt know would highly effective vaccine preventing illness death. Vaccine like flu vaccine 60% effective possible would less that. 100% effective hospitalization research showing antibodies increase time. study came indicating 56 days first shot it‚Äôs effective Pfizer. Also it‚Äôs apples apples comparison. trials different strains tested participants covid symptomatic ones. Additionally seems effective stopping transmission (though Pfizer moderna currently studies well) it‚Äôs easier transport reach masses making quicker vaccinate people variants created. Keep mind moderna Pfizer absolutely killed 95% efficacy vaccines aren‚Äôt typically effective. flu vaccine instance 40-60% efficacy given year. I'm going someone else online said: 

The vaccines finally see light end tunnel *know* coming soon. I'm going screw around get virus (or spread it) close finish line. 

I'm getting shots waiting two weeks, I'm letting loose looking back. Point being, anyone goes mass events callous shit deserves put cell criminal negligence. aren‚Äôt allowed even point out? Yesterday simply said ‚ÄúHospitalizations compared day before‚Äù got 19 downvotes. [Thule would sure nice armed forces members OCONUS could actually get it. eligible vaccine. months.

 province live in, must 70 years older immediate future. Canada ordered enough every person living get vaccinated 5 times got yet People travel poorer countries often. That's exactly prioritize neighboring countries first. reason still believe frontline essential workers vaccinated everyone else. It‚Äôs hard try harder find willing drive Cheap manufacturing cost larger profits It‚Äôs effective prevent illness requires hospitalization death Moderna/Pfizer. Yeah 30 days efficacy rate lower, rises 90% 60 days. It‚Äôs one shot available, filling hole AstraZeneca left behind, since bought 400M doses that. Amazing turnaround US. Thank Biden. Guess could help that? 

I‚Äôm sure donate participating study! think studies looking donated milk, want say saw one NYU Mt Sinai...? Otherwise keep exporting crazy variants, offense. far, mutations proved significant barrier inoculation. Could change? Sure, *possible* Super Mutation could arise completely evades current vaccines. highly unlikely, likelihood going people vaccinated spread reduced.

And even unlikely thing happen, back square one. Pfizer Moderna already know tweak vaccines mutations could arise; incredibly easy do. FDA said require full round trials modified mRNA vaccines (it'll basically equivalent new flu shot comes every year), available much sooner. manufacturing already ramped current vaccines, producing enough doses hurry problem.

tl;dr: Stop fear-mongering. Mexico last week locals vaccinated. really cool. sure one. LMFAOOO. selfless. 48703894 million Americans vaccinated we‚Äôll give 3rd world brown people leftovers. 2.350 deaths Brazil last 24h btw (and people thread like: ""I hope give Canada first!""). Seriously. understand countries want populations first let's stop pretending huge selfless gift share surplus vaccines afterwards. would pretty despicable anything else. **Health officials found evidence vaccine directly causing death** - Lady bad liver.

I thought getting vaccinated month, state radically changed criteria late February. I'm tired point little faith state government. would kind okay-ish deal sold stupidly high minimum pay multi-billion dollar purchase vaccines. Make Uber-rich bankroll entire covid-19 vaccine cost want cut front line. Yes, please help us. Cause know president won't. simple minded, stupid fucking thing point to, makes take anyone says way less seriously. conditions insanely different year ago. actively vaccinating people, plenty risk people won‚Äôt receive vaccine another 3-4 weeks take least 2 weeks day form immunity. whole point vaccinate risk people, we‚Äôre getting super close completing that, people throwing towel. 

It‚Äôs like 1-2 miles left marathon taking hard right going bar getting drink instead finishing marathon. Boggles mind. fuck kind dumbass reason this?

And millions lives upended? tens thousands people medical procedures delayed this? can‚Äôt wait forever old people. don‚Äôt want one move idc mean. Brazil humid climate look cases right now. Humid climate valid factor this. think lines typing civil manner.

This whole thing mess. perspective, lines people hands working companies producing vaccines got vaccines. Trump Biden. think either deserve credit. ""titsauce"" getting chesty FYI Canada already looking behind US weeks, maybe month two most. could see us needing advance doses weeks that‚Äôs it. 

We lot doses pipeline, way ever need, it‚Äôs matter soon arrive. believe it‚Äôs sort assumed, hasn‚Äôt already said publicly, donate ridiculous number doses global efforts citizens secured theirs. 

I don‚Äôt know we‚Äôd donate Mexico first simply add COVAX initiative distribution. Probably latter unless Mexico particularly shitty spot. What?! tell don‚Äôt get handout go rake immune systems How?? It‚Äôs fucking frustrating could sell highest bidder vs donation. Almost certain others profited greatly position would have. thinking one? article Moderna vaccine: Yes states need accept delivery handle internally needed coordinated logistics receiving federal government exist. states idea much would arriving, showed one day expected facility store however many arrived. they'd figure allocate however many showed up. States holding back doses know would get enough next week second dose proper time. Biden's plan guaranteed certain amount delivered every Tuesday allowed states plan better ahead time rather starting scratch delivery random amount. Yep, terrible. However none applies comment replied to. almost 12 year old I've waiting too! Here's data soon! curiosity, Brazil linked federal government FioCruz Institute, aims deliver 30 million doses AZ April, 25 May, another 25 June.

In second semester AZ transfers technology, start producing active ingredient FioCruz itself, probably able produce more. it‚Äôs Moderna/Pfizer, countries don‚Äôt infrastructure distribute. Myself, REALLY want teachers vaccinated. Practice preach - safety. Let's open slowly, safely able *stay* open. would absolutely devastate children go back, huge surge, shut again. takes two weeks longer reopen vaccinate teachers/aides/workers, it. 

We want teachers become superspreaders either. would really really like wait little longer versus telling child beloved teacher died covid. mean many people so.. much love immediate neighbors, also think Brazil could use help first 3. canada fuck Sadly, describes Texas nutshell:

- Texas passes super regressive piece legislation
- Austin passes something override legislation right thing
- Texas either sues Austin passes new law makes illegal Austin pass stuff

Lather, rinse repeat. Here's another  Yes ercot lawsuits going on? little concerning, good know! whole travel ban red herring anyway 40,000 Americans came back China anyway without kind testing done people. Trump lied said tested. travel ban placed EU NY cases came anyway. 

Could crushed Wuhan level lockdown everywhere world 2 months? Sure. never slightest possibility happening, however, international travel ensures outbreak anywhere would seed virus rest world. inability manage spread buy time started top. Yea, see would prioritize countries listed. giving leftover vaccines poorer countries able secure many vaccines. Let's secure North America summer's end.

Let's go entire hemisphere. countries listed first world countries fend themselves. much doubling important allies is, US worry foreign interests gaining influence neck woods. time, trying flip scales target nations SEA Africa vulnerable Chinese influence.

The diplomacy factor aside, important support countries need help ASAP entire world move forward pandemic. trade molsons free year secret syrup recipe Hospitalizations lag much deaths do. someone hospital, they'll stay bit. go though, they're simply enough people getting covid compared winter many go hospital first place. We‚Äôve known this. sub love scare stories yes. sitting air conditioned closed room strangers 2 hours safest thing middle respiratory pandemic. wtf? vax using? seeming like good news hear distribution may dumb question US government gone fully behind J&amp;J others despite far less effective? merely single dose? going see long term consequences giving BioTech/Pfizer Moderna backing? whole situation would hilarious like episode Fargo wasn‚Äôt tragic. Like, didn‚Äôt still mans glasses windshield wipers? Ridiculous. friends grandmother died soon taking covid Vaccine. I'm sorry can't trust covid Vaccine anymore. PA can‚Äôt get vaccine phase 1c. We‚Äôre currently phase 1a. I‚Äôm server. job entire time dealing maskless people dirty silverware/straws/napkins yet can‚Äôt get yet? Grocery store clerks postal workers me? ridiculous. hear nationalists singing praises

Serious question: *really* listening them? would that? good thing - many places even Walmart towns Dollar General biggest store town. probably related. People normally get instant acute kidney failure. Still vaccine safe flying. eat glue, you? Texas too. proof required. came another state. 10 min front door shot. questions asked. Likely avoid overloading system.

This get huge number folks eligible schedule. drop restrictions floodgates truly open (all folks concerned wouldn‚Äôt qualify, older folks wanted walk-in, etc.) Sorta feels like sub taken Covid deniers. That's wu him. right say none perfect science everyones immune system little different 14 days *know* people safe? 

So one study says one person says that, still kinda need wait 14 days make sure. feel scared, stay home. Neither realize non-mRNA vaccines stable ice Got Johnson &amp; Johnson today. Lesser side effects ass. fuckin brutal. Immediately upon getting shot, arm hurt. 6 hours shot felt totally fine thought I‚Äôd get side effects. hour 7-8 started getting achy muscles developed 102 fever. Headaches, lack aperite, nausea, Tylenol, etc. Ithas exhausting. Luckily able order Gatorade hot ramen home didn‚Äôt prepare vaccine. I‚Äôve many vaccines put ass! IHS VA allotments subtracted state allotment significant difference Alaska states. 

Also, native corporations capitalized. proper name. think varies even areas like that. area also mask mandated mostly unenforced. think people wear one it? Absolutely. think less wear one ends? 100%. It‚Äôs valid concern. throw entire kitchen sink friend. year, still cannot believe still people believe masks work. As-in wearing it.

They good blocking droplets someone infected spread around. good protecting someone walking around droplets already spread. guess one understood meant Johnson &amp; Johnson Yeah bro, 500,000 people dying highly contagious virus fear mongering. 

And again, lots people can‚Äôt stay home.

Get bent. compassionate comes people countries, please get vaccinated give someoen US state US territorydoses needed. *this* America know. think step I‚Äôd go, people angry? Especially grocery store? employees absolutely wearing masks! always wear mask even curbside incident masked partner wasn‚Äôt, curbside person without mask brought side instead person wearing mask on. Like seriously?? Lockdown lifted, fact restriction lifted to. Israel back full person schools, open restaurants, concerts 500 weddings 300. We're large street parties cases, severe cases deaths *still* going hospitalisations new ICU admissions still high

45% new severe cases Arab population due low vaccination numbers (they 18% total population). turn served curb anti vaxx sentiment many getting vaccinated.

New severe cases among Ultraorthodox (high vaccination among elderly also lot recovered) dropped almost 9 times (to 12% peak). Among general population dropped 4 times (to 25% peak). See new severe cases per million.

**There's opening problem, there's anti vaxx problem.** frankly screw them, choice. feel unsafe stay home. fear-mongering shit over. everything that's wrong society behavior shouldn‚Äôt change period ‚Äî vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre protected fully! still get it. carry it.  Oh wow... state dumber thought. sympathies. lot conspiracy nuts Alaska? Quit making shit up. discovered almost 6 months ago likely around longer that. leadership looks like. wtf else supposed do? bought lot vaccines use diplomatic purposes hypocrasy. us supposed mind businesses. Canada vaccinations lined up. Focus helping vulnerable countries. Might know much governing 1.3 billion people, know enough recognize rape wrong evil. Guess care though. Canada ridiculously behind, it‚Äôs also tiny country compared US. California alone populated Canada. mitigate spread without simultaneously protecting people yet infected? keep buying doses? agreements 400 million read correctly.

That entire article makes Canada sound incompetent led think this? Canadian here. C'mon buddy, hook us up, eh did. spoke current narrative. Sorry sorry. supply problem US hoarded it. 

I gf takes Quensyl. started rationing Germany gave cheaper alternatives. Go ahead. that‚Äôs biggest risk ever take life, you‚Äôre utterly charmed. It‚Äôs CYA special reserve holdbacks really screwing us. 

Hold nothing back. Get shots arms. shots coming, promise. think it‚Äôs good thing it. showing card, made FB post A) it‚Äôs page wanted (don‚Äôt like don‚Äôt read/unfriend mostly B) anti vax/wary friends family members think educated decent source certain things, stating got it, hope taken encouraging move I‚Äôm pretty young know me. I‚Äôm stat talking head TV. 

If someone got FOMO, oh well. I‚Äôm changing behavior yet period partner isn‚Äôt vaccinated wasn‚Äôt point post. production going continue ramp administration side things needs expect create bandwidth. mean, knew ‚Äúproblem‚Äù coming eventually year ago. Didn‚Äôt plan it?

Honestly there‚Äôs piece says should‚Äôve hired Walmart manage whole damn thing. J&amp;J takes 4 weeks dose, remember reading. Seems savagely stupid per usual US peak also much higher (per capita), much room significant drop. Israel also pretty much almost fully opened now. completely open person schools, restaurants, concerts 500 weddings 300 across country.

50% new cases 20 yr old. Factor Israel far dense US, large families increasing spread (3 kids per family average), much adult spread happening pockets significantly less vaccinated demographic (Arabs responsible 45% new severe cases 18% population... largely due anti vaxx sentiment lower vaccination numbers). get clearer picture.

Still despite completely opening up, cases, severe cases deaths still dropping. We've also seen reaction spike Arab population many got vaccinated last couple weeks, effect cases weeks. Given vaccine guaranteed effective 90 days, great news! appreciate clarification trying convey disbelief fact could surplus even one PPE. suppose could conveyed way better, bad. We‚Äôve got 10% vaccinated it‚Äôs already mid March. I‚Äôd say anything resembling near normal won‚Äôt possibly end summer think it‚Äôs mistake blame (primarily) age limitations. problem mostly combination administration scaling quickly needed, holding back doses, delays reporting, sending doses non-optimal locations. sams.thimg Austin tried something else, like raise minimum wage like two years ago.

Sadly, probably even notice hypocrisy. saving 2nd doses 2 dose J&amp;J trial proves much effective? 

Or booster shots tested UK study using alternating doses pfizer &amp; AZ Oxford (or vice versa) see would provide effect 2 doses kind. Canada ordered metric assload vaccines, really need help. got slow start domestic production, temporary issues expanded production elsewhere. Better distribute vaccines poorer nations. study addresses growth rates, difficult visualize, talking simple number deaths, 1500 people die COVID-19 day US, 2% saves equivalent full airplane people every week.

The actual number greater. Well yes surplus majority U.S. population vaccinated, would fully support sharing vaccines countries around globe starting Canada Mexico. Yes do. really don‚Äôt understand unless sandwiched top like sardines can‚Äôt get reasonable distance next guy. J&amp;J one shot push up, unless counting post-vaccine waiting time well, yes, we'd far happen. Keeping case they're needed again. Probably give Taiwan first every tech company needs silicon chips.. public health-based justification 50% capacity, really anything 20% capacity stadiums. stadiums opened last summer fall opened up, opened mostly 20%, reasoning four empty seats every one person would equate roughly six feet between. Anything actually following guidelines, stop following guidelines might well try maximize profit go way. sort rolling re-opening would purely show

The exception Super Bowl, around 30% capacity, caveat significant portion group vaccinated. need start influencing africa. Oregon pretty well rollout now. frustrating part. We‚Äôve known coming (eventually) year. unprepared ramp administration? booster Covid doesn‚Äôt immune response. certainty much immune response developed. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve read anyway. honey musty too! Super ready mine hit!! Ya. kinda saw coming realized country production capacity. Ordering doses make sure get some, even export restrictions. county mask mandates apply indoors they‚Äôre even enforceable throughout Disney. That‚Äôs Disney policy. It‚Äôs one agree with, it‚Äôs county. 

I won‚Äôt even go Hollywood Studios right now. It‚Äôs mess. 

I‚Äôm west Disney, outside Tampa. love it, hasn‚Äôt felt safe recently it‚Äôs certainly enjoyable anymore. states could well still fall normal person vaccinated. Odds looking much better though! Main benefit masks mitigating spead people already infected, less protecting people yet infected. Hence critical everyone wear Dude give man. see people fun I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll join too! Seems counterproductive. can‚Äôt believe every single component necessary vaccine made EU. could easily open tit tat retributions. Help every country around accept help. Make Brazilians wonder country still refusing help virus gets worse. Pfizer authorized 16+ metric. WA also tribal communities.

But everybstate supposed receive per capita allotments. states getting more, that's wrong. classmate mine Georgia trying help immigrants documented undocumented get shot high risk due living situations nature work. False. even talking about? talking done US vaccinations. implied talking surplus.

You editing comment without saying edit makes seem changed good deal. someone WA state, wish possible fly alaska get vaccine there. phases crazy! 1A tier 1, 1A tier 2, 1B tier 1, 1B tier 2, 1B tier 3, 1B tier 4 ""all phases"" even defined Worded harshly agree covid biggest issue. Hold horses buddy, still gotta see Biden‚Äôs China policy whether helps Taiwan not. Wat Congrats! Due opening mom finally getting shot tomorrow! third world countries rich ones... We‚Äôre fine Canada. Well done august. Anglican 

Anglosphere. Anglicanism type Christianity. Lol direction? might neighbors.

The mask police front castle make think they're masks 2022, even wanted drop them, orange county mask mandate.

Although I'm sure disney holds considerable sway county. Another promise make history delayed lie. I'm glad did, Unpopular opinion, Abbot's order expressly states counties meet ""high hospitalization"" threshold (greater 15% hospital capacity Trauma Service Area filled COVID-19 patients) cannot impose stricter restrictions laid executive order.

This AG job, enforcing rule law constitution Texas. Whether agree order, mean AG gets ignore whim.

Your problem Abbot constitution Texas.

edit: Source: It‚Äôs pill gives Covid! person B doesn‚Äôt go work. require person something like person B job prefer? 

How understand that? It‚Äôs year. point haven‚Äôt adjusted life dealing virus, it‚Äôs face consequences, others. FDA approves it. FDA approved yet. 16+ 3 US shots approved excellent.

However, wonder Pfizer/Moderna better short term success real world preventing covid simply people know aren‚Äôt fully protected second shot?

Eg: lot people don‚Äôt know vaccine takes days/weeks become effective. get flu vaccine hold kid flu night probably getting flu.

The two shots added ‚Äúwait 3-4 weeks acting invincible‚Äù gate readily apparent people. wonder translate ‚Äúsafer‚Äù post 1st dose set actions 2 shot recipients 1 shot recipients.  Good, awful existence grandpa nursing home passed. Yes can! I‚Äôm starting get chills felt nausea stood it‚Äôll ok. Oh man that‚Äôs rough, glad home chill bed between.

It‚Äôs weird lot rest world message hope vaccines ramping Canada quickly, there‚Äôs doom gloom feeling better go non essential shopping need next weeks we‚Äôre back stay home order. Kinda really demotivating even feel pretty hopeful good summer things get better.  Match 12th day NCAA canceled games. made people finally sit take notice much anything happened March 11th. currently indication vaccination caused conditions, listed side effects 

Why halting vaccinations again? elderly much higher death rate 1 percent. goes way 20 percent get upper ranges. 

This easy thing research know. Since somehow didn‚Äôt know common easy find fact, believe you‚Äôre qualified make judgements vaccines? surely must realize you‚Äôre educated subject all. According Facebook price gas pressing concern president now. Please take vaccine. vaccine proven efficacy SA strain. JnJ 50+% efficacy ""severe moderate"" disease SA variant. symptoms all. vaccines impacted new variants degree still data. another person explained, cellular immunity much likely effective variants, epitopes presented surface equally likely (kinda) get infected cell killed.

AstraZeneca working booster shot well, one might not.be impacted anti-vector immunity, since interval 2nd booster dose probably long enough. Slightly topic - British media worst source EU-related topic. recommend politico.eu appreciate nuance objective analysis.

Also, rollout bad portrayed. Finland, 0.5% population got vaccine yesterday, two days ago. Last week even days reaching 0.8%. Disappointing, certainly disaster. dad 78 still similar treatments chemo year ago. get vaccinated April least. philosophy also merits applied domestic economic policy. said something totally random baseless nothing issue, whatever reason wanted create controversy really exists head. Whatever. definitely see point. Personally, reside US (keep covid I‚Äôm wee bit hypochondriac) state ended mask mandates social distancing / occupancy control due poor leadership.

While AZ seems cause side effects it‚Äôs still really Bad. Current knowledge: 87000 doses AZ vaccine deployed Denmark

That's true, 142.000 Actually EU vaccines exported. people angry (now producers watched see ignoring contractual obligations sell higher bidders iirc).

Though, yes. coordinated effort, supplies vaccines prioritized worst areas sensible coordinated travel bans prevent spread. Instead mix profiteering politicking. would appropriate response. hope right courage happens. Blame media German people. 

It's important press understands job publish responsibly act mouthpiece weird wonderful conspiracy theories. news sources insinuated would share people us received them. think clarifying rebuking That‚Äôs great! case country though. Antivaxxers: exaggerate vaccine injury/deaths 

‚ÄúFollow science‚Äù hypocrites: vaccines 100% safe injuries deaths ever.

Cool guy me: small risk drug/vaccine Or, commonly known, sending goods people bought them. I‚Äôll bet dollar didn‚Äôt read article I'm ready go back Caribbean.... places like Dominican talking 2022 vaccinate people. Sucks places dependent foreign tourists.

Denmark member EU simply reminded everyone fact whole EU acting deeply irresponsible unscientific manner comes AstraZeneca vaccine.

Pass fake outrage. African strain might come EU vaccine shit 

T-cell response provide effective protection severe symptoms. vaccines struggling reduced initial antibody response SA variant usual 'flu' like symptoms possibility vaccine. like never ending train wreck. stop watching. Typical American attitude isn‚Äôt yet. There‚Äôs surge happening Europe, one Brazil. Variants? Many women get blood clot birth control one bans that. 0,5% population predicaments blood clots naturally women. Dying blood cloths birth control happens too, still, one bans that.
All info comes blood cloths birth control, take grain salt, blood cloths pretty normal sadly dying unusual too, important sudden? Certainly helping, course need investigation see link, public trust AZ even reduced. proven link, vaccination resume. AZ anyway reduced shipments severely EU last weeks, waiting couple weeks mean much long run. Ok interesting. got second dose moderna. first sore arm dull headache. second one knocked ass. getting tested regularly work much lately. always negative, don‚Äôt think ever covid knows. Netherlands expected receive 2,6 million Pfizer vaccines end Q1.

They actually deliver around 3 million vaccines. due high deliveries coming weeks.

They overdeliver initially planned.

It seems like AstraZeneca able deliver around 1,6 million doses Netherlands then. 40 million EU. 80 million short initial goal 120 million (30 million december 2020 90 million Q1 2021).

This difference Pfizer AstraZeneca deliveries. big. Denmark suspended AZ. WTF? think AZ vaccine date almost exclusively given hospital personnel Sweden. probably likely report eventual side effects elderly given vaccines. Probably explains differences. US wants start 'vaccine diplomacy', cheap vaccine that. cheap Indian labour solution. Unfortunately nothing Pfizer offer return, already much cheaper successful vaccine, thanks. Emirates offered Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine another developed China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) employees free since January. companies Gulf state urged staff get inoculated, government offices require unvaccinated employees pay regular COVID-19 tests unless valid medical reason vaccinated.

Holy shit Please read message. Thank Even US still selfish player whole market. EU already exporting major parts production Russia China pledged poor countries beginning.  happens, think EU reject export license. US anyway stopped cooperation Europe Trump, little US terms sanctions. Well, see lot people saying want get j&amp;j get different vaccine later. work way, get one that's it.  CDC recommendation small gatherings fully vaccinated individuals. still recommend avoiding crowds.  brought private individuals. wanted vaccines meant delivered UK split sent EU make shortfall. 

Because that's AZ wrote contract.

I'm sorry AZ nothing fraud company far.

Their product great tho. vaccinated 23m people mostly AZ

Interestingly statement exactly true Britain India today. He's using every pre-trial procedural trick book drag case long possible. way AZ vaccine put together involves growing large amounts different virus, growing phase individual plant, climate procedures

Is true Adenovirus Vector vaccines (e.g., J&amp;J) unique AZ's? prison population swelled, lots reasons this. we‚Äôd agree on, wouldn‚Äôt. 

But still started whole thing saying people getting life prison stealing slice pizza anyone pretty crummy reactions flu shots? make feel achey like bad cold 2-3 days. hear covid shot doozy. became eligible wonder schedule right days  getting expats guy corrupt come. Scumbag Texas Republicans whatever want impunity. Everybody wants it. get there. different tolerances risk. hang in; probably sooner later. Novavax looking combining flu &amp; covid Fair enough, don‚Äôt see not

Hmm, maybe could sell premium! Biden told Mexico get lost, Mexico asked vaccines China got them.

The US selfish give vaccines even neighbors. scared prevent COVID-19?

I‚Äôm sure plenty died early weren‚Äôt afraid disease. governor already restore mask mandates lifting them? responsibility adjust life deal virus instead expecting millions people cater wishes.

You literally exact thing. difference supporting people working incredibly important supporting people going fucking baseball game. Instead telling people 'maybe go baseball game"" actually believe people need leave jobs easy get another one terrible economy, one magically makes safe top things. changed many things society, end days millions still need interact others manner (we also employers really give shit). love think telling people change jobs big deal dear god tell people can't pack baseball stadium.

I choice words guess setting bot. figure are. 

BTW...I making argument anymore. pretty much science experiment. logic fascinating pretty funny. really care think strength argument. capacity understand anyway. Might well fun. protection, no.

Pfizer efficacy one dose around 52%, definitely true. Maybe it‚Äôs maximum protection, still significant protection one shot. *fingers crossed delays* Hi, Florida here:

Desantis giving away like condoms health department rich neighborhoods. someone please come fix this? Pretty please? say curfew last resort nothing else works? effed up, actually. US using vaccine invented Germany, yet don‚Äôt get use since bought US. EU better, vaccines available kept inside EU, virus great time mutating southern countries, waiting make comeback countries vaccinated population original variant. 

We take long hard look critical infrastructure ramp production capacities immediately along making decent plan global distributions. national issue stop treating such, order chance future pandemics. Sorry came spoiled. things liked pandemic rolled in. Hopefully concerns wants back understandable. America first deaths lmao. Maybe priority, stop deaths?  what, make phone calls good ol' boys invade Capitol again, shitkicking sack trash? work like though. like 4 million people one day going receive shot. EU utterly incapable vaccine distribution doses added doses already sitting warehouses Thanks, dear leaders. Dude biden even done pandemic lmao basically got vaccines got approved. America first deaths ok Fuck turd muncher pay back COVAX need realize people ones ALREADY afford travel. Maybe US worry health system first countries  Yes, there's big risk countries get russian chinese influence happen. Unlike strong democracies like ukraine, georgia, south american countries half africa, well defend red propaganda armies already got staggering number vaccines secured (like 1% population). /sarcasm. too. :( India: toh main Kya job chhod Doon? Contracting/buying doses versus domestic vaccine manufacturing leads two different scenarios short term. Indoor environment take mask eat snacks/drink. 

Sure could concessions, movie theaters make money. hope things don‚Äôt get worse. guy trial yet? EU fucked rollout bad. effectivly demonised Oxford vaccine (maybe british made vaccine?) got totally wrong. People germany saying Oxford vaccine think nearly effective Pfizer one even though is. EU damage control, trying cover backs fucked bad.

I brexiteer super glad anything EU vaccine rollout.

We've fucked nations much past. Time pay 400 million matter mattered gambling many possible domestic vaccine production leftovers donated. idea ones would approved properly manufactured rich nation could afford it.

We ""incompetent"" ramp domestic vaccine production SARS swine flu reaction... reaction (and was) buy many much can. also raiding COVAX meant poor countries vaccine top later.

Nobody anticipated even though pandemic experts predicting years decades Spanish Flu type would kill millions. can't build vaccine facility weeks takes year minimum there's one starting end year making vaccine next year.

If USA contained virus early stingy vaccine Canada would some. Everything goes back early decisions case vaccine production decisions made years decades ago. March 13th 2020 last day 8th grade. remember well, pi day competition se could memorize digits (I 236, btw).

We excited next week school spring sports set begin soon. Everything felt great, happiest long time.

On March 15th, everything changed, feel like I‚Äôve living fever dream since then.

Today first day back school since, I‚Äôm excited change pace. Every teacher area gotten one two doses, feel good going.

Wish luck! Austrian here, still using AZ. 
This one hospital stopped using concerns bad batch. given countries high rates uncontrolled community transmission, strong capablity quickly distribute administer jabs. logical thing highest risk right new variants arising globally vaccine resistant. Whether country rich/poor/enemy ally largely irrelevant. New strains emerge infected population, chances increase people carry virus. 

If arises, everyone US need given new different vaccine developed mutated strain. looks EU one allows exports Yeah fuck every poor country.

All countries listed afford buy vaccines.

The US donate covax obviously part investigation this. ‚ÄúSo we're going start making sure Americans taken care first, we're going try help rest world.‚Äù

if vaccine distrubition much faster vaccination process, surplus every us citizen vaccinated. administration share surplus vaccine vaccination process done US. Haha nice Can't wait impacted US export ban goes fill finish there. EMA approving every batch part Conditional Marketing Authorisation right?

From I've gathered one report case Denmark (and countries).

Would interested seeing story develop, though EMA stated following Austrian finds links Austrian blood clot cases  EMA, commenting Austria blood clot cases, said Wednesday found¬†no evidence linking AstraZeneca far.  said number thromboembolic events ‚Äî¬†marked formation blood clots ‚Äî¬†in people received AstraZeneca vaccine higher seen general population. Yes, even injecting air muscle seems bit dangerous elderly high risk people. unusual air find way bloodstream. guess injection amount small (0.3 - 0.5 ml), greatly reduces risk...

But injecting air? incompetent someone be? bad training? seems nearly impossible notice liquid syringe, liquid removed vial... wrong thinking this? Yes. Things like sore arm occur. India already provided COVID-19 vaccines India. frustrating. CA it‚Äôs impossible get vaccinated. keep hearing supply increasing yet medical providers saying getting less vaccine allocation cancel appointments. incorrect, AZ suspended Baltic countries. one suspected batch suspended. EU likes, dont care. Tired threats thats make minds. repercussions though thats EU worry about. USA supply leftover vaccines nations? LoL. 
All while, India already supplying COVID-19 vaccines numerous African Asian nations, well western countries like Canada. India primary provider vaccines UN COVAX scheme.
Most vaccines donated free cost poor countries.
Till date, India supplied millions COVID-19 vaccines 47 nations around world, capability produce procure vaccines, western nations greedily hoard vaccines themselves. cannot make EU negative UK, unless vaccine nationalist is. Asking proper question. Someone needs stand China sell 15 million directly Taiwan.

Otherwise, current plan us vaccinated til sometime 2022. It‚Äôs frustrating might get vaccine world doesn‚Äôt even care anymore covid. Need gtfo country concerned minute since 23 year old girlfriend AZ shot yesterday suffered blood clot brain last summer result birth control on.

If that's tidal wave additional doses, know would be. Administration acceleration needs happen, could stop delivering doses two weeks still administer many doses today, every day, running out.

Culver‚Äôs don‚Äôt want creat two classes people, also don‚Äôt want give anti-maskers ‚Äúout‚Äù dodge mask requirements claiming vaccinated really aren‚Äôt news can't find either reason. starting think maybe misunderstood something edit comment incase.

I found source people 2nd dose though

[only 4711 people total diagnosed fully 907 symptoms. Agreed. suspect that's going happen Ohio, least. 50+ today opening mass vaccination sites Cs (Cleveland, Columbus Cincinnati) top 1k+ smaller sites state. 

I wish would start vaccinating essential non-healthcare workers (grocery store employees, etc), really think we're 2-3 weeks away opening vaccines anyone 16+. Since sarcasm hasn‚Äôt gotten message across, needing resort personal attacks means actual argument terrible lacks standing.

Once able read. making argument. stupid understand anyway. laughing you. 

I read rest. Enjoy going life lacking ability reason even read. Thanks laughs stupidity grown tiresome. going hit ignore button bet still reply. Enjoy talking yourself. ""It unclear whether AstraZeneca producing much vaccine U.S. U.S. would apply restrictive measure trade.""

This part article key. AstraZeneca producing much anything US nothing export. However we're sitting stockpile AZ, yet approved likely need, agree bad look. Based personal experience vaccine coworkers case AZ one published far know, due public dispute EU AZ. mean, we'd get pandemic even vaccines failed, like 1918 flu. would cost around 1% population deaths we'd get it. COVID limited lifespan matter what.  Sorry tough 2020. I'm glad year looking better, stay safe friend! Americans counted right thing, they've tried everything else.

- Winston Churchill Uh oh  would cost India 6 times much vaccinate population using Pfizer instead AZ. UK can't manufacture amounts vaccine India needs, allowing India cost effective. rumor stronger immune system worse reaction good Pfizer data behind it, thanks Israel, would pick.  Someone tell CIA Brazil lot oil bananas. warm weather northeast terrible winter fact see light end tunnel making people... know, pleasant? People actually seem happy. love much. Life coming back little city state I'm glad family member ok able get vaccine! uplifting hear, thanks. Hey, thanks lot! Indeed, last round chemo almost 3 years ago, 2018, suppose fine? Yeah, vaccines besides pfizer moderna outside discussion indeed Wow that's literally nothing. 211 million people Brazil that's they've got. Sure maybe media picking AZ, I'm aware countries pausing Pfizer/BioNtech mass due bad batches generally unanswered questions. years wait. pandemic would gone vast majority population then. Maybe strictly enforced, flew state back January register state check contact tracers. sort annoying anything. takes March going worst month record UK variant going everywhere super hot right now.  going baseball game pretty fucking easy. Really expand that. Explain pain going baseball game vs. change job. Mind change job never interact someone. Oh, don‚Äôt go activities. mean literally go Rangers game 40,000 people. Please show huge social importance that.

It‚Äôs one single event. Sure, one event meaningless, going cancel/prevent similar events? start that, it‚Äôs longer meaningless. would still need employees. Try keep up.

So stories stadium employees unemployed needing assistance aren‚Äôt bright. don‚Äôt even need expound this. created reality despite already explaining it.

I‚Äôm bright think wanting die element fear? really don‚Äôt think average person least somewhat fearful don‚Äôt need take extreme

Since adhering capacity set taking me. idea lines recommendations scientific community. hand decide shit want. think go science. hand one making decisions acceptable risk. ask question, me.

If ask self question, answer it‚Äôs acceptable force others mitigate able mitigate yourself. want able please, means ignoring recommendations experts. requires making random bullshit fit desires.

Close. want everyone want without others telling to. However, you‚Äôre completely wrong ‚Äúrandom bullshit‚Äù state completely supports point. solely wanting open stadium could attend, might right I‚Äôm making BS support that. I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm starting belief everyone want applying various situations like baseball games. see don‚Äôt know read. setting laugh more. ideas insane laughable, enjoy treating like shit. one besides reading this, lack capacity actually come reasonable conclusion arguing anymore. sure dealt whole life, laughing you. giving reason reply more. throwing softballs watch flail away batshit insane logic. Honestly keep coming gold. laugh riot.

Since sarcasm hasn‚Äôt gotten message across, **needing resort personal attacks means actual argument terrible lacks standing**. get J&amp;J shot tomorrow 1:30. looking forward getting needle. Antivaxxers worst. I'm sure first second doses point, tbh.  One, necessary 'order seperately'...not even sure means, need come 'inventory'.  second dose Pfizer exact shot first dose Pfizer.

But regardless that, USA going end hundreds millions Pfizer Moderna doses need initial innoculation campaign (as first second dose).  likely donate developing countries, promised, could likely also renegotiate contracts used variant booster doses come later. shit. Please elaborate getting little bit point absurd.

The rest world really think subsidizing big pharmaceutical companies much US does, then. seems important guys get products. carry burden paying R&amp;D, looks apparent prioritizing countries do. Specifically, US. past year far worst year life. received job offer first post college job end 2019 navy contractor get security clearance could start working. finished paperwork middle December 2019 told would 4 6 months everything went through. decided kind hangout 4 months since would last 4 months freedom start working parents fine it. 

Fast forward March get email saying security clearance went given start date job. started look apartments area ready plan trip sign apartment. However week given start date week everything went shit shelter place orders given everything got shut down. received email saying everyone's start date's pushed back couple months ""they could figure things see situation developed."" understood coming actually sad everything super crazy then. 

Fast forward June US response receive another email saying everything many people company put retirements plans switch jobs/departments one supposed start 2020 could start jobs 2020 would wait time 2021. 

I completely devastated. close able finally move start life going complete hell job search process I'd everything snatched something completely control. 

Now 2021 still start date. started people wait ""my turn"" enough people leave. applied jobs time really want move fuck parents house away home town gotten couple interviews lead where. giant gap resume huge red flag potential employers. keep sending resumes want start working knowing probably going get thrown trash. 

I know do. told 3 people department supposed work leave retire start idea might be. nothing past year completely killed mental health. get pretty upset sometimes reading comments people ""lost year"" still got paid got professional experience meanwhile home fucking nothing except volunteering places there. lost year salary experience living new city new relationships. mid twenties feels like worst possible time losing year kind stuff. 

This pandemic end get vaccine. pandemic end mask mandates lifted. pandemic end full stadiums music festivals. pandemic really ends given start date actually start job find job kind miracle. 

I know. defeated point kind want die. took us hot minute get rolling, patch back-to-back storms knocked us out, we're actually getting there! indeed news me. 

I found AstraZeneca one. link Pfizer one? family works healthcare they‚Äôve vaccinated already. feel like loser hahaha kinda miss working office tbh. I'm worried rank file we'll ones along lower level managers. Higher level managers, executives presidents staying home often means fewer opportunities interact them. everybody grateful

Only braindead buy one though. Got first dose yesterday feel like shit.

So 10 hours Johnson Johnson vaccine felt chills/fever 

12 hours later fatigue, fever, nauseous 

15 hours later nauseous fever 101.7

24 hours later fever 

28 hours later intense body fatigue/pain. Feels like someone dead dropped strength attempt stairs

Yup, like wasn‚Äôt prepared. nurses played big deal. Bruh

I suggest 
-ice packs
-ice chips
-Tylenol 
-pedialyte
-Gatorade 
-apple sauce 
-epsom 
-a set bathroom 
-pillows, sheet, :( hopefully there's light end tunnel Like people difficulty going back normal ? 4 6 weeks it'll Demand. J&amp;J ramping production. Remember, marketing Repetition. messaging constant un-ending make impact. especially true trying sway 35's little risk hospitalized covid. Counties health care groups still crying lack supply Newsom even share distribution data county groups weekly basis. Plus sure Blue cross blue shield partnership accomplishing. 

I know logistically managing vaccination 40 million easy. wish taken tech company like Google help. would built much robust platform handled logistics much better government doing. course huge outcry Google using data ads way would happen data need reside Google. google could another tech company. Ahh discomfort positive end point! Keep mask around cold/are sick need go grocery shopping. also handy freezing outside vaccines going effective medical reasons. absolutely could placebo affect. say long wait know? K. except flu kills normally 12-20k people per year covid 540k. Flu affects airways, covid ACE2 receptors affects whole body. People recovered still issues.

As parent hard make call, especially covid often brings disorders even long gone. Ah, thought replying someone else. 

My problem voluntary mask requirements puts onus businesses, thus, bottom totem pole employees enforce them. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right. statewide gives much easier reinforcement store policy. Best case scenario, customer asks speak manager, that‚Äôs much better. 

Even Austin tries keep mask mandate, state AG sues them. Small government suits me, guess, state government Texas going for. 

As well, mask thing, wearing mask puts people risk. simple. require people wear seatbelts car 1. Don‚Äôt kill 2. Rag doll kill seriously injure passengers. require people drink drive, increases chance crash kill someone. require passengers wear seatbelts planes don‚Äôt get injured injure others severe turbulence. require small children put child seats safely secured. 

Wearing mask viral pandemic voluntary, mandatory. increasing risk spreading respiratory disease aerosol respiratory droplets. 

You say need money job, yet want get rid restrictions help prevent spread disease hospitalize risk populations, racking expensive medical bills. Strange. ay yi yi. bet fear stories going wonders Japanese vaccine hesitancy. 

One thing--remember Alaska lot first many cases comparison? going close 25% adults 1 shot todays CDC update. would need ~1.6 million first doses done get there. think come short, around 1.4m guess, maybe J&amp;J update push us 25%. Anyone surprised US vaccine administration rates paying attention. there's one thing US good logistics. convince average redneck vaccine make obey Bill Gates 5G chip, let war experience logistics job. working Walt Disney World time last year, participating Disney College Program. something wanted years, finally accepted 2019 3rd 4th time applying. more-or-less dream job, started back January last year 21st birthday. thought 2020 going best year life; certainly started way.

I became aware COVID-19 sometime late January, bit February, definitely lot March, however time working Disney, caught thrill living moment us thought nothing COVID-19; lot us think would anything worth worrying about. Oh wrong were, hindsight 20/20.

We time lives really, know certainly was. introverted person bit social anxiety, finally beginning open really starting come terms accept that. really enjoying life want taken away me, obviously world different plans.

I first noticed something wrong around late February started able find toilet paper certain cleaning supplies local supermarkets. became chore find stuff, us around Disney housing start sharing stuff getting harder find. might seem odd first thing caused notice something up, lot us really keeping up-to-date happening world time; caught enjoying really think keep news &amp; current events.

I thought maybe hoarding toilet paper cleaning supplies effect overreaction people, hindsight kind really was, around time last year, became aware Walt Disney World would closing believed time would 2 weeks. us working living Disney housing sure meant us, apparently Disney really know either. thought they'd closed 2 weeks initially, perhaps planning keeping us around passed. Well pass, March 14th, learned Disney would suspending college program, 48 hours pack leave Disney housing.

Just like that, lost dream jobs scramble get home, world seemingly collapsing. point knew things going quite time, though sure long. desperately wanted situation improve soon possible, though never realistic. difficult come terms fact that, finally achieving happiness sought years finally getting dream job, could ripped away even really chance appreciate all, essentially 21st year almost entirely wasted.

I hope not. hope historians future recognize super conspicuous. Cautionary tales forgotten. Every single one Yep, feel like going open wide next 1-2 months. Looking forward summer start seeing return normalcy. said Thursday Covid-19 vaccine blocked 94% asymptomatic infections Israeli study ‚Äî result CEO Albert Bourla called ‚Äúextremely important.‚Äù

It sure seems encouraging thing keeps mostly staying home even year: worry one unlucky 10% suffer months initial infection. I‚Äôve read, long Covid often seems develop mild even initial symptoms. vaccine prevents even level infection, seems (just guy) prevent long Covid, too. Whatever time roulette wheel lands day.

But seriously, think noon 3pm eastern days. EU published contracts. That‚Äôs know details. contracts name main facilities deliveries come state, others also used necessary possible. Missed opportunities college students devastating(especially seniors)

Basically said fuck all, nothing felt real past year actual trend lines

Here go. Cases per million broken segment population. Hebrew, Arabs blue, ultra orthodox yellow, everybody else bummer, pharmacy option ""other"" in; qualify first 3-4 tiers, still available case.

Soon friend, soon access. Yep. many deals made golf course lunch? Tons. There‚Äôs something said face face (NOT mask mask) informal meetings. also relates office ‚Äúpop ins‚Äù. know ones, coworkers impromptu brain storming session. Like not, miss them. 

My wife type job face face client meetings crucial. seen zoom meetings severely detrimental times. dropped connection zoom clients. clients pissed. know fair, know paint completely fair picture, someone actually posts twitter week something, immediately think they're probably mentally ill. matter political social persuasion is, they're almost certainly idiot they're prolific twitter. Denmark also stop administering received shot 49 year old good health non-essential (ouch). took MiL one day see extra shots could get, were, told could get shot too. January 6. hospital got started wait list unused vaccines day, simply yellow legal pad. three names time. definitely learning curve administration side. Coworker said kids elementary school problem teachers anti vaccine refusing vaccine also refusing come back classroom due COVID. yah...thankfully mildish virus ever killed many Americans one year, yes, dramatically different infectious viruses. definitely find buying groceries without realizing what‚Äôs happening get home store. can‚Äôt explain why, live alone definitely know delivery exists get COVID otherwise can‚Äôt go out. feel like seeing empty stores last year must‚Äôve gotten realized I‚Äôm freaked supplies running low. even would grab container disinfectant wipes saw them. I‚Äôm trying use up, yeah, I‚Äôm glad wipes getting back stores there‚Äôs need fear anymore. Congratulations! vaccines Knock out. wife separate ones shocked responses Mike DeWine's (Ohio) tweets. big mix anti-vaxxers, taking ""wait see"" approach. Distinctly different groups, ultimately slow rollout. examples Metropolitan areas: Indianapolis, Austin, Cleveland, Miami, New York, Oklahoma City. 

Rural: pretty much anywhere Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming. 

But honestly, look pretty much anywhere country, cases dropped dramatically less rate. winter surge started Dakotas/Minnesota, states saw first decline well (starting around right Thanksgiving, despite hysteria Thanksgiving surge). Dakotas hit hard, doubt, cases plummeted despite zero mitigation measures. be? can‚Äôt they‚Äôre sparsely populated ‚Äî mattered, cases rise dramatically first place? Also easier talk number family. flu, deaths much smaller, typically 12-20 thousands 2017/18 think really bad flu causes 60 thousand deaths) 540k deaths covid. Yes, people preexisting conditions affected, also people healthy died too. There's much talking people survived medical issues it. Like guy needs learn walking again. people reporting recovering covid sharp used be.

Flu uses receptors lungs, covid uses ACE2 receptors affect whole body, including brain. dat three Italian lockdown.
Surely first world country would partial lockdown shouldve already called pandemic. well, no. Slow always. Lemmings agree. remember going grocery store back mid-lateish March 2020, seeing shelves empty produce, fresh meat, paper products, fun communal areas closed down/blocked off, people wearing masks (although totally widespread enforced yet) avoiding other, even looking other...it felt unsettling dystopian. like living citizens City 17 Half Life 2. Yes. CDC reports sequenced cases caused notable clearly cases, though US sequence may cases hard tell relative spread count alone. NYTimes good infographics estimating percentage cases caused idea related 4 days first shot, lost voice randomly lol. talking like 12 year old boy like 72 hours. Look 0:50 video filmed: Fair. headline kind buried lede researchers say lack easy access vaccine sites could biggest driver shortfall, misinformation playing role. think gonna dramatic, wonder long take sub finally realizes issue shitshow company AZ, EU supposed faults. assistant got second last week felt bad first nothing 2nd People hesitant, understandable. would like wait see happens months least side effects definitely damaging I'll consider it. force onto people going breed mistrust skepticism, leave alone. vaccine approved emergency use authorisation, new type - mrna - widely used before. hope concerns invalid fine can't ignored exist many people. say people take it, said forced necessary everyone. people severely immuno compromised, yes, stay away reach herd immunity vaccination alone wish. quickly reach herd immunity infection quite get vaccinations resume normal life, safe too. need force segregate people. nothing wrong wanting better vaccines, Pfizer Moderna. sub silly trying shove lesser vaccine people‚Äôs throats. Bodily autonomy. wonder could 2 levels vaccination 'approval' FDA. 1 vaccines administered 1 need prove vaccination vaccinated country vaccine approved administration US. latter would obviously require much less vigor approving, would mainly one leading bodies approve come things require proof vaccination. sucks. meant ‚Äòit‚Äô limelight. There‚Äôs plenty opportunity good guy, encourage vaccinations win public support. Instead he‚Äôs absent. 

It‚Äôs best interest real estate perspective, well Currently sitting waiting area. received first dose. SC, phase 1B includes 18+ certain medical conditions qualified. However didn‚Äôt ask proof surprising maybe system? Idk. arm isn‚Äôt dead yet tho! know even worst effects day so. hate feeling like garbage :/. I‚Äôve impressed rollout. complaint seniors struggling state reaching people registered state directly certain age bring elderly vaccination numbers number excess deaths independent test results.

More people died 2020 2019 despite people working home getting traffic accidents normal flu almost entirely absent.

The tests indeed 100%

That also governments looked number hospitalizations deaths decide measures take.

Unfortunately often late. dropped laundry KN95 instead N95 typically wear going indoors think possible exposure pt besides walking outside. No, think they've got everyone. What's wrong data link? get second dose tomorrow moderna fine. One million AZ doses delivered couple weeks ago 17 countries EU. Since then, one nurse Austria died blood clots 10 days vaccination another woman hospitalised blood clot. Denmark recently woman die blood clots well close connection receieving vaccine. countries reported cases blood clots batch. Norway, Denmark, Austria, Italy baltic countries decided stop vaccination batch (Denmark decided stop AZ vaccination together).

Since blood clots really seen UK side effect, dealing ""bad batch""? FDA mentioned trust issues manufacturing process AZ vaccine one reasons beside trials accept vaccine US soil.

But question also, could AZ vaccine theory cause blood clots predisposed? genetical weakness? also interesting mostly women gotten side effect. get shots arms, hope open things area people. Yes, protect vulnerable first, let's let perfection get way progress one. don‚Äôt want push people think themselves, might hurt brain question would one dose allow us do? everyone one dose go night clubs? think would given roommate timeline, staying room get test (as already know). 

Symptoms nothing know asymptomatic spread. subreddits silently slowly taken lot of, er, nefarious behaving users. city sub grown exceptionally anti-CDC, anti-Fauci anti-mask users pushing history even live city. voting behavior matches theory well.

My guess social media networks popping up, organizing brigading places try shift conversation. end, science wins people alive well Fauci, CDC rest us recognize importance listening experts. killing people driving whilst texting seen bad killing people whilst drunk high?no expert us judicial system guy seem facing serious consequences.

Also hit deer meant call someone least try move road drivers hit it? next day state parks closed. days later, county parks closed.

Keeping parks outdoor places closed long periods time, one dumbest things, among mistakes public health fumbles let us! bought couple dumbbells exactly year ago. figured they'd get inevitable month 2 lockdown could go back gym. hindsight bought bigger/better set least something. day 2020, give capstone presentation university. last requirement graduate. started 7 pm large audience students, faculty, staff going coming. remember 15 minutes went stage give presentation NBA stopped games coronavirus. remember stepping stage giving presentation full room people, afterwards people gotten news got quickly others seemed noticed happened. 

The next day university closed. weeks later, professor head department major said would graduated either way cancel capstone coronavirus, glad able give really clue else could done years-worth research. strange end college career. I've never particularly worried covid family, discourse people spouted March, April, May really number mentally. lost track many times someone called murderer going hike alone months. I've gotten rid lot individuals life last year, thankfully. Robust guess work. dying own. That's they're everything keep going. money cure. That's there's vaccine. treatment. Facebook groups filling slots end day waste vaccines. Look around, ask friends, etc. vaccines available travel little ways available especially end day. prefer Hola County haha 
Yeah forgot county. I'm one larger ones longer. 
AZ quicker thought seems Halloween 2021 LETs GOOOooo point absolutely pointless. temporary suspended. guess new vaccine there's going alot anxious reports come even though probably going ti turn link ti vaccine. Atleast know authorities around word continuing monitor vaccines closely ensure safe I'm actually extremely pro vaccination. can't wait get mine. misinterpreted comment. saying, vaccines end game, still people want go ""new normal"" vaccination. know vaccinations prevent transmission, therefore pandemic vaccinated people. extremely moving goal posts. Yeah, I'm Athens many appointments available several locations. mom who's teacher ATL suburb find anything. disparity access pretty frustrating. hate guy tell others live life, guy used suffer INTENSE anxiety (nocturnal panic attacks, heart palpitations lasting hours), meditation cardio wonders, without bad side effects I'll try get everything done next 4.5h turn tv. I've heard recovery also like flipping switch, know case. Like 10000 spoons need covid jab. Yea. mean mind staying isolated even get vaccine. I'll still get suffer symptoms virus get it. understand people fine getting virus naturally instead getting vaccine staff magically unable transmit disease? touch multiple items owned different people throughout day? Well, hope not. mrna, new type vaccine, I'm still keeping guard up. Basically, I'm saying currently we're able measure risk taking vaccine important consider risk covid already low. Right, 46 ish hours. Probably contagious? I've heard people developing symptoms within days, makes wonder contagious prior symptoms contagious starting like day 2 Lol...Gila County... want it. line get 2nd shot vaccine half mile long clinic even opened. people trying fake first shot could get second. Trust me, still want it. take least couple days build enough viral load (if even infected) become contagious. second dose, felt like Thanos beginning Endgame:

‚ÄúIt nearly killed me, work done.‚Äù

Wiped next day lol saint.  man probably hammering nails right now.  wonderful person Yes Anyone predictions things ""over""? Hola County opened anyone 18 believe Lol mean I'd love CA telling ain't turn yet üòÖ Nice see cabal stand together long time really effect mental health. force check news week. Like say, think searching good news long time really any.  see another surrrge No, Koreans wore masks Fauci CDC said to. former boss even offered mail supply tight. COVID vaccine? Unlikely. capitalists, vaccine likely subject price controls slim profit margins given per year. real winners mRNA guys develop treatment (not cure) chronic illness. way, they've got customers life. like Pharma 101. PrIvAtE sEcToR reason really worried. Nothing suggest cases linked AZ Nothing reported UK they've given like 11m AZ vaccines. precautionary measure that's taken Denmark etc since ofcourse new vaccine ofcourse going plenty monitoring going make sure going well. agree jobs 2-3 days per week office probably optimal we'll see lot hybrid schedules. zero doubt ""permanent 100% remote WFH"" stuff companies announced last year survive past September. kinda are. guy places biggest order first gets first dibs.

The US quite literally ""pre-ordered"" doses, earlier EU did. Hence shit-show EU. simply dragged feet long order enough. like flu shot takes ~2 weeks fully kick in? received J&amp;J shot yesterday. side effects speak today outside sore shoulder. bad messaging public health yet lead this. Instead saying start know yet help stop spread ongoing studies keep informed. 

Instead, much message evidence stop spread. sure true comes across saying reason believe stop spread looking question. too! got first dose Monday!  Would easily available. Seems really don‚Äôt need already got it. Work public school, still word. Yeah cases AZ vaccine seems bigger immunresponse actually getting covid. least people 30. cmon, dense. develop, test, distribute engineered inert adenoviruses express coronavirus spike proteins make many doses less year discovering virus ship extras unserved countries...

THEN BUY COOLERS DRY ICE Reasonable approach. think getting vaccines healthcare workers abroad good idea. Please keep discussion topic. Thank you.

Yeah, point still stands let everyone that‚Äôs vaccinated instead vaccinated Brits you‚Äôre letting people come generating money increasing risk Yeah agreed. Never serious anxiety pandemic. early days catastrophizing pretty terrible mental health didn‚Äôt help one people still going work lab every day. Luckily anxiety lessened drastically time especially came find covid world ending disease thought early lessened even roll vaccine. year later I‚Äôm week away fully immunized vaccine. lucky living fianc√©, group friends weekly discord movie night with, summer able take advantage outdoor dining, going beach, bar trivia outside friends. Last months little bland easy make knowing we‚Äôre close moving past restrictions getting back normal life. Never much anxiety first months finally people life I‚Äôve worried spreading vaccinated. mean supposed extract vaccine vial injecting it, I'm still confused person missed first half process. year truly destroyed me, destroyed ego, I'm traumatized. taught loneliness is, taught meaningless life actually is. world may go back normal think ever same, know others relate that. I've avid mandate-follower even I'm starting get antsy.

Exactly. I've lived like hermit last year, social distanced, wear mask whenever go out, etc. I'm done it. I've also optimistic last weeks ever since started. light much end tunnel. got AZ shot doctor super pissed news. Apparently lot patients refused get vaccines today it. really pissed media reporting without proper context fear mongering headlnes. good news starting pile up. wait MK4482 comes pike. Israel cases still dropping already almost 50% population fully vaccinated. guys from? one person, spare unused doses. anything caused manufacturing method/problem.

We see we're story leads. Cool. Walgreens anything within 25 miles ATL anyway seem allow expanding 50 miles You‚Äôre never going get scientist promise anything. Didn‚Äôt anybody learn anything movie Volcano? many times Anne Hesche need tell Tommy Lee Jones ‚Äúcertainty‚Äôs big word...‚Äù Teens risk though, adults vaccinated put restrictions something really concern health Oof. Here's hoping speeds up. Happy birthday! There's point so. Pfizer vaccine might lamborghini AZ still nice Audi Mercedes. options better walking. Superintendents like vampires ‚Äî come they‚Äôre invited. allowing apartment, accepted level infection risk.

The lesson drawing infection possible even good people take precautions. seem drawing lesson bad experience cause force everyone plan entire lives around COVID avoidance.

It sucks, got tackled 1-yard-line. Indoor dining still open capacity restrictions gradually loosened. There‚Äôs still something I‚Äôm quite getting though. vaccinated person transmit, actually contract covid? Like, we‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs 5% chance (for example) vaxxed person contract covid, also 5% chance could transmit it? concern vaxxed person could carry transmit virus without ever having/testing positive covid? I'll take fucking vaccine bro. Fellow essential worker. keep reading this, yet every single person I've asked supply zipcode, I've able find vaccine slots 30 seconds. 

Check stock results target pharmacy websites put addresses zipcodes. Also keep checking pharmacy sites midnight early morning (5am-6am). take legwork, shots there. think net outcome lockdowns show worth it

You've already proven wrong vast amount show US lockdowns made impact significant impacts negated net benefit humanity?

Since defined either parameter, way ""show you"" that. could show you, choose ignore.

How go watch interviews actual medical experts, listen podcasts read data states Governors hid misrepresented data?

I doubt least bit sincere, others reading might AMPLE evidence someone getting ""news"" Facebook. little sisters 4 2 rn they‚Äôre explained everything we‚Äôre virus, virus gone it‚Äôll back normal. We‚Äôve talking taking Disney world able visit grandparents it‚Äôs get really excited flexible schedules wfh. 2 days office, 3 days remote something like that's impossible vector mRNA vaccine since one tiny part virus namely Spikeprotein presented Immunsystem.

""Living"" vaccines would cause become pcr positive. I've tryin get mom vaccinated month now. surpluses? Happy birthday!  offered declined; folks work said no. surprised slightly. A+ comment think depends, I'm Israel tech we're back office, tech companies know of. think us \~2 months officially go back.

I bet US going 2.5-3 months longer still tech. 5 months guess. proof vaccinated people cannot spread it/s

I truly despise headlines handled everyone talk assumes still wear mask fully vaccinated ""it stop spread."" I'm pretty sure even news comes reduce it, people going hear believe go initial reporting. I'm sorry deal that, hope developed adequate coping mechanisms minimize troubles.

But admit, that's situation majority people.

In effect, traumatic experiences life really equitable others.

And yes, strive ""do better"" every day, whatever means us individually... no, let's pretend sort predetermined success. working PhD immunology consensus last March mRNA vaccines unproven rest maybes. hope sheer volume candidates, sort success (at least 8 effective vaccines less year later), something anyone dreaming of. got incredibly *lucky*. Imagine we'd gotten single vaccine approved April May. One vaccine whole world limited numbers facilities modified produce vaccine type. We'd waiting years distribution.

To vaccine makers: Bravo.

To politicians established ZERO strategy aside ""hide house scientists (hopefully) bail us out"": fit office.

With one vaccine approved initial timeline, would looking natural herd immunity, got pretty damn far road many places is. everyone *except* vaccine scientists, luck. bailed us unprecedented work. What's personal risk? mistake hindsight that's things go. data March 2020 make *any* decisions could 100% sure about. Staying away cases seemed thing could reasonably say would work. New studies coming daily basis showing vaccinated eliminates/greatly reduces chance still able spread COVID, prevailing opinion people internet still ""We IDEA vaccine means can't spread virus!"" / ""the vaccine definitely prevent infection all, makes asymptomatic definitely still spread it"". hard hopeful good news feels like majority people going listen indicate vaccine stop spread covid vaccinated people? get anything can. Press done shitty job explaining vaccines.

All matters death prevention %, vaccines prevent death effectiveness.

PS: might case discussed young people get pfizer/moderna superspreaders... I'd still take anything. Definitely question doctor instead me. poorly informed opinion would moment risk would immediately second dose, lots people get flu like symptoms inflammation. got J&amp;J morning. feel fine. Go get vaccinated y‚Äôall. see lot people upset decision, let ask, blood clots happening much Pfizer, Moderna, JJ? not, decision authorities made might make sense. 

It‚Äôs like AZ vaccine, alternatives turns good insignificant portion population (that sure eventually able identify). want brag NJ. We‚Äôre 70K vaccinations day. rate we‚Äôll 75% state population one dose mid May üî• Even better, even claim share vaccines citizens vaccinated everybody grateful Ya I'll getting vaccine dr's office. Hang brother.  Things always way, blessed new perspective reality.  challenging scary, ultimately far rewarding going rest life blind without important lessons. 

Ultimately choice react new understanding. happening pharmacy, I'm sure fine. Less sure places. live FL. Right jump waiting list specific segments allowed get shots  Yeah that‚Äôs gonna irrelevant soon. show example guidance provided said could stop wearing masks public got vaccinated? mean cancel culture start canceling vaccines ? parents aware CDC Dr. Fauci said *fully* vaccinated people associate maskless low-risk people *fully* vaccinated people?

Too many Americans seem think social distancing social isolation sad good mental health way. Masking social distancing zero-sum game Americans want things be, that's CDC specific guidance vaccinated people.

Start making plans form social bubbles vaccinated people low-risk people rest community gets vaccinated! Thinking instead can't help mental health. found pregnant second child March 13.

I'm throwing computer away too. enough screen time years Hippa Israel, along government health care means lot data easily available.   Basically government everyone's electronic medical records. That, coupled high level vaccination, makes ideal lab evaluating vaccine. I'm New York situation may different here, mass vaccination sites family using really trying get appointments quickly possible get everyone vaccinated without even asking proof eligibility. There‚Äôs enough evidence know every effective vaccine say way likely would lower transmission. would accurate statement right. I‚Äôm also seeing lot anxiety fact educate patients whole ‚Äúyou getting shot within timeline maximum efficacy‚Äù lose second appointment fearful effective vaccine be. agree it‚Äôs really causing massive amount distrust process. would think. Unless faked giving shot never compressed plunger.

It smell right probably afraid lawsuits. That‚Äôs guess, I‚Äôm lawyer scientist. dead poor people can't vote Fall. Heads many areas put waitlists. never know cancellations excess doses local pharmacy would much rather give someone (anyone!) without going waste.

I signed local pharmacy even though chances low, accept would last, options give final dose day within 5 mins phone call. wife teacher can't even get it. Agreed, it‚Äôs definitely complicated really depends lot lens see world from. 

That free market idea taught every college Econ course took ideology reinforced executive leadership every US manufacturing company meet (which really RnD sales staff US mostly). theory efficient way things, reality it‚Äôs way US based companies exploit 3rd world countries maximize profit margins ultimately widen disparity wealth North America. understand feeling hoodwinked macroeconomic theory pushed US, too. 

From shoes though cousin, pay 10 times drugs made Fizer, Moderna, etc. pick one example, insulin 10 times expensive here. go hospital without private insurance ($600/month I‚Äôm lucky premium), get bill pay next 30 years. ONE time ok government fucking instituting national policy. 

That said, agree excess can‚Äôt get arms expire, bottleneck, go homies north south first. indeed interconnected. thats US constitution shaped. 

The right bear arms based event tyranical ruler take America, americans able defend circumstance. read federalist papers, James Madison Alexander Hamilton, two architects constitution go it. 

Same sort logic here. You, me, anybody cannot predict future. best craft policy insures rights freedom. Presumably healthier people stronger immune systems creates stronger response? hardest part pandemic 3 weeks

In UK I've noticed elderly streets, parks etc enjoying sunshine universally without wearing masks. wonderful see, really see change mood lives bringing. 

Disconcerting first though, feels weird seeing fragile looking people streets without masks on. worry one dose, probably actually safe think are, good anyway. AstraZeneca propose EU would plug gap EU/UK production US? US export ban now. Surely AZ knew America would say no. even bother pretending viable solution? Also look mass vaccination events go near closing time ask leftovers. That's ended getting shot group early (also NC). remember reading first case reported CA day Kobe Bryant died. keeping eye February although concerned COVID, didn‚Äôt really think would completely disrupt lives knew them. department university discussing plans transition virtual classes early third week February (one proactive departments school, apparently). February 25th, remember one Psych professors telling class prepare ‚Äúsome form quarantine‚Äù, honest concern didn‚Äôt really resonate campus population March. 

When university first announced switch virtual classes March 10th starting days later, thought I‚Äôd still able come campus study library (taking precautions course) also lab work. Little know March 12th would last time would campus late August, returned absolute ghost town. It‚Äôs hard put words surreal atmosphere campus now.

In ways, pandemic hasn‚Äôt bad thought would (not millions deaths US initially projected, widespread vaccines now, etc), yet, ways, it‚Äôs much worse level can‚Äôt comprehend (the loneliness, boredom, anxiety, runs supplies beginning, politicization, government response pre-Jan. 20th, length, missed opportunities, loss hugs, etc.). much better outlook things despite university class (grad classes mind you) still online fall 2021. despite setback, know normal return we‚Äôll rear view mirror. It‚Äôs wild ride wish never go again. that's gonna dawg need symptoms contagious. I'd order test ASAP quarantine 10 days (as today) case.

Also, watch predict future 100% accuracy: yes, results similar. Early days, I‚Äôm seeing lots range numbers, I‚Äôve seen indicates 75-90% efficacy one dose 2 dose vaccines. 95% both. gap relevant seems.

The 5% difference 90 95 better thought 1 10 vs 1 20. 5% drop means twice many occurrences infection 1 2 doses vaccinated population.

That said, it‚Äôs probably much better 2 people mostly covered typically bigger reduction overall spread. Sure right afraid. large scale manufacturing... manufacturer immune QC issues.

However, relatively tiny benefit getting vaccinated compared old people far outweighs cost hour two time. US doesn‚Äôt vaccinate fast enough. Reflects badly.

US doesn‚Äôt share vaccines. Reflects badly.

US stares blankly space. Reflects badly.  Wow. can't say heard reaction yet, get close family members already first shot, got second shot canceled County, told go back Kaiser second shot. big push ""The vaccines safe effective!"" hugely disserviced hindrance process. mass vaccination obviously new everyone, general public already near wit's end stresses recent past pandemic. definitely share surplus vaccines vaccinate population.

I find funny though Summer US relentlessly mocked worse third world countries world looking us help. husband spent day years ago; building houses Habitat Humanity. Says he's super nice friendly, worked hard people quarter half age. Vaccines protect individual. Unfortunately, people can't take override right choose what's injected body. I'm going go around breathing immuno compromised people, uncomfortable around I'm vaccinated go near them, that's decision. Lots factors play individual's decision place governments companies interfere that. Even quite reach herd immunity vaccination younger people refuse it, natural immunity infection get us rest way there. look Moderna contract certainly seem case. event case EO 9 December would necessary neither would use Defence Production got back vaccination appointment. can't believe year away hitting fan, I'm already vaccinated. Really looking forward weeks I'll finally feel safe eating restaurant again. I've missed worrying pandemic public. 

In OK, Cherokee nation started giving vaccine anyone 18+, tribal members. NA nations going follow suit. That's big reason ahead curve. helps state gov also desperate get back normal well since screwed much up, NA nations real heros spreading load much. That's big assumption make. oxford vaccine around 70% effective even 22 day mark, there's still high chance getting COVID taking particular vaccine  good dude happens.

Junior year high school started dating. year prom. time hung friends weekends went place one two drivers licenses. I‚Äôm afraid father gonna picky brand get, since knows J&amp;J less effective two options. kids died it

""No deaths"" horrible standard reopening schools. [Fuck Oh please, it‚Äôs grand conspiracy. varies state, I‚Äôm sure many essential workers state. shit takes time undermines vaccine ignoring potential complications name jabbing people fast possible. 

While likely vaccine fault, likely issue particular batch product whole, people *more* confident check give clear rather ignore potential problem. security theater vaccinated. What's fear mongering stating Denmark paused vaccines unexpected death? Denmark actually this. anyone stoking fear, Danish government media (although think worth pause look data closely). what's alternative, reporting all? Imagine turn serious vaccine QC issue came media covering people dying. daft?

He‚Äôs talking numbers dropping, expected since US able get vaccine end May. 

Numbers dropping people getting vaccinated different things here. keep replying. lot projection going on. üòÇ today university got 1500 J&amp;J doses give student workers. sure universities Arkansas getting them, able get morning think noteworthy Bush endorsed Rangers' plan sellout home opener 40,000+ fans less month. got Pfizer vaccine yesterday im feeling LIT live townhouse halfl-size chest freezer. thing saved ass last spring grocery stores mess. lucky full top chance. odds ends, went early quarantine without many issues. Well fuck me. make effective vaccine ever made? love little men need last word. When‚Äôs last time interacted real person? funny mods gonna coming you. Can't anything even slightly approaching here. China exploiting third world countries too. They're also much imperialist. much prefer western democracies influence region rather totalitarian China. worst year life genuinely given up, see two friends go gym they‚Äôre open I‚Äôd perfectly content wake tomorrow especially given end sight would approved later 

I said approved *right now* response ""that's wrong, would've approved later""? Really? Everyone subsidizes pharma companies, even moot point previous one.

Not much US does. US enjoying perks that. Sorry? Maybe countries start bearing burden want preferential treatment. mean, doctors experts literally telling wrong, sure, soooo much informed anti-vaxxers üôÑ

I like used exact argument use ü§£ understanding people healthy lungs, intra-venous air bubbles even significant size would get trapped dealt lungs causing major trouble. arterial air embolisms would problematic. can‚Äôt find data UK exports. appears vaccines produced UK, remained UK. Unless someone else data says otherwise, appears UK done something stop AZ exporting Europe. 

Whether that‚Äôs hard export block buying available production slots, end result feels same. It‚Äôs probably looks stark fact EU allowed 9 million exports vaccines UK. feels one-sided. maybe there‚Äôs story here... Yes UK contributes production Pfizer vaccine contract them. Ya weird, whole body felt bloated, like combination able empty bladder also body even turning water chugged urine. Never something like before. definitely wasn‚Äôt dehydrated peak waking every hour half peeing ton.

Cant find side effect anywhere guess it‚Äôs something weird body. 670.000 doses Norway; equal 50 million EU total: still haven‚Äôt pointed one fact, go king get 1.3% total EU allotment supposedly deliveries reduced 1.6 million less 0.7 million. 

Where read this? yup, business usual DoD well. glad work able chug along anything looked forward got cancelled (/sarcasm) Yes. media. Yes does... 5% cases would gotten virus still get vaccination, think number scale saying people infected? Another way ask is, vaccine prevents 95% illnesses, prevent people suspectable exposed?

It's 5% (give take error initial measurements).  did. I‚Äôm sorry facts backing kooky theories unfortunately adopted governments (which ironically rallying against) that‚Äôs life sometimes. Every bit evidence logic says happen substantial numbers.

But one willing bet people's lives without hard evidence actually happening. Yeah I'm eating least mid-Fall going vacation next year. approved right BioNTech went alone, moot point. 

It's not. First true - would approved later -, second without BioNTech German government vaccine exist first place. short, moot point, US subsidizes pharmaceutical companies general

Everyone subsidizes pharma companies, even moot point previous one. two family members covid still isolate other? matter point vaccinations calendar linked article states Moderna cutting deliveries AstraZeneca pause check blood clot symptoms. mention AstraZeneca cutting deliveries estimates seem 0 AstraZeneca on.

Do source Norway, Danish source actually discusses deliveries? article reads like calculated (last week's total estimate - week's total estimate), difference could either deliveries safety pause. got J&amp;J one morning. shit hurt 5 minutes, couple hours later kind feel move That‚Äôs funny. see snobs ones telling everyone health decisions. People don‚Äôt want vaccinate, sure right, really need education get it. People WANT vaccinated want choose vaccine? go ahead stuff little snobbery speeches. It‚Äôs body, body. happened telling men &amp; women bodies? one want one particular company bad history &amp; lower numbers would rather others. someone doesn‚Äôt like that, tough üí©. bleeding disorder often little bleeding intramuscular injections, never trouble. amount blood describing, maybe needle nicked capillary going out. exactly costs? still everything used no, benefit 5% one wearing masks.

Yeah realistically people gonna follow doctor's advice benefit small, make advice false someone explain even happens? know small volume liquid, think person giving vaccine would realize liquid drawn syringe. Yes, best wish get cooperation collaboration global level goodwill, thread global. Pfizer enough half vaccination needs.

The half, unfortunately, AZ J&amp;J they're dramatically short targets. think even within states issue. know MN, get three hours outside Twin Cities hundreds appointments available, Cities like Mad Max trying schedule one. Hopeful continue learn tweak logistics based demand. I'm patient, kinda want go back normal levels too. bet friend time milkshake wouldn‚Äôt return campus ‚Äútwo week break.‚Äù laughed me.


Needless say, still haven‚Äôt collected. death rate 0-19 year old 0.003%, 0.02% 20-49 year olds. deadly. 

These flight attendants talking about. see hundreds people every day. health much concern spread way see number readers/subscribers/comments posted subreddit date? basically trend time. year ago remember watching presser taking transcripts Discord group. already seemed like saga point, honestly worried us getting properly locked down, unable leave house groceries. fully stocked storeroom food, lot masks.

It's year since - woah. even know begin last year taught me. friendships, part, actually strengthened. We've opened recent months much miss other, we're usually emotional bunch. We've rallied around friends sick gone though shit. We've spend deep, meaningful time calls, found new ways enjoy friendship online games. 

Early on, cousin started trivia zoom call week. whole family back UK really helped mentally, able hang chat, part 'in jokes' again, show part life video. dad actually fly see me, week due come, shut international travel. amazing that. addition, mother law started weekly games night (mahjongg!) we've missed week since last Summer. pandemic, I've got closer sides family, grateful that.

I've realized independent think am. husband fly somewhere couple weeks, honestly started notice signs depression towards end time home alone. work virtually, really anything requires human interaction, enjoyed room sing loudly, bake make mess, hog big TV, wanted background noise caused another human something. bubble best friend, hung times, really really nice. Yeah, last year I've confronted fact like people around, maybe need lean people while.

My interests expanded - gardening, making music, mahjongg, baking, redecorating, working out, playing VR games... I've kept pretty busy whole time, good. 

Man, I've missed restaurants! Bars, ehhh cope lack bar social life, miss heart ability say fuck go overspend indulgent meal. bought house walking distance set nice bars restaurants, I'm really anxious get back going Friday night perusing menu delights. able point meal someone bring (for $$$ lol). washing up. Getting tipsy bottle wine, stumbling back home.

The warm times easier cold times. stand paddleboarding, certainly warm weather hobby. love BBQ sunbathing deck. house gets really cold, home gym, COLD winter.

Talking which, fitness - know different everyone, people found pandemic made eat drop lot activities kept physically active, opposite effect. cook home, pantry full canned food, meant we'd lot healthy stews things could put slow cooker. We've ordered takeout couple times, mostly diet good. go stores anymore curbside, resist urge buy stupid stuff need. there's home gym, right doors living room, constantly shaming I've lazy. I've stayed weight, put muscle lifting running. 

So, all, I've got positives though, holy fucking shit ready over. [But Biontech also made german Thanks bud. try too.  Norway get 1.3% total EU allotment supposedly deliveries reduced 1.6 million less 0.7 million. calculate correctly total EU deliveries 50 million Q2 (so even less calculated initially). total failure disaster vaccination programs Europe. Moderna also falling short 60% J&amp;J prioritise US.

Pfizer job, surprise they're heavily funded German government. AZ not, underperform. Read article friend, slowly. It‚Äôs well written simple English. 46% effective 14-20 days dose 1, 92% effective 7 days dose First all, others said, many won‚Äôt take it. They‚Äôll flat refuse. Secondly, don‚Äôt vaccinate every single person Covid vaccine. vaccine authorized age 16, takes around 100million people. third, moderna Pfizer still making doses distributing those. really matter old! contracted multiple fill finish facilities. Uh, plenty costs wearing masks. no, benefit 5% one wearing masks. like criticism CDC announcement. really matter directly me, change people's minds better backup. Luck residue design. needed quite bit luck, shit ton hard work, thankfully got both. No, changing subject now

No, I'm not. vaccine would approved right Pfizer's part testing logic, vaccine give priority Germany.

It approved right BioNTech went alone, moot point. Also, Pfizer threw money, US. vaccine receive funding OWS long I'm aware of.

And? US subsidizes pharmaceutical companies general, put Pfizer position partner BioNTech get vaccine tested, approved, produced large scale, distributed. Nothing. That‚Äôs exactly reported. think coffee shops start allowing people sit inside use WiFi long periods again? Working home change environment gets draining :( Try vaccinehunters.org way timeline nationally applicable US, maybe states all. I'm MT we're struggling get enough supply able get second tier rn, opened rest current tier (previously restricted select medical conditions rather whole list due lack supply) 250 appts opening Fri entire county. info when/how many appts open fill. Admins hospital board members got vaccinated month I'm nurse constantly sees covid patients. Shit unfair sure. me, essential workers mail delivery grocery store workers food biz workers gotten vaccinated along older vulnerable pop staggered distribution. far less common vaccines targeting humans require dilution steps prior injection. Usually delivered pre-mixed unless drug obviously requires reconstitution like lyophilized powder.

And people think it. brother (who remote since last March) set go back August. Yep, can‚Äôt point anything out. Exactly like suspected. Pathetic

How know argument 101 discussion episode TWiV January early February. protect people‚Äôs kids

What protect mean socialism results missing benefits capitalism?... good man, clearly struck nerve anti-science masquerading anti-government rhetoric. Start article top read SLOWLY. Sound words to. tell students reading comprehension issues back elementary school - (hopefully) find quite helpful. Good day. good coverage MSM early pandemic way BLM protests. happened wouldn‚Äôt known pandemic going all.

All media cares clicks ratings. Ever since vaccines approved FDA, MSM generated nothing fear-mongering content selfish interests. semblance objective reporting pandemic disappeared. No, changing subject now. *your* logic, vaccine give priority Germany.

Also, Pfizer threw money, US. vaccine receive funding OWS far I'm aware of. BioNTech primarily partnered Pfizer helped cro stage production distribution, partnerships work. funding vaccine still came Germany. think think policies like would effective mandate. Staring barrel 2 weeks unpaid leave financially devastating many people. know would choose vaccine. Even went straight vein, still going work fine. Also, featuring fake statistics. 1% population dead covid lol Little Red Hen story come life. Hi! I‚Äôve doubt. got first shot AZ yesterday Spain. 
What consequences getting infected getting first shot? 
Thanks know thing two needless death bandaid actually used vaccine leak arm. key factors vaccine kids

IFR age kids even factor ""back normal"" equation since risk low, particularly adults around vaccinated. anything, could make argument we're better taking time study effect vaccine kids rushing it. nice knowing people busy thinking different things living lives instead hanging here.

Maybe same... forget EU also ordered lot vaccine pr Biontech/Pfizer get companies allowed ship them. Still pissed unfun first half senior year fun stuff end year cancelled covid think issue whether FDA approved re-vaccination. studies take time, mean time fall quarter UCLA starts September. becomes issue whether allow foreign students back campus (and living dorms/communal apartments) non-approved vaccine. Remember FDA approve medicines submitted them, Chinese &amp; Russian vaccine developers seem interested going regulatory hurdles since they're going selling US. US fend themselves, they're richest powerful country world.  Caribbean, including Cuba. economies entirely dependent tourism trade experienced areas space premium social distancing measures may impacted.

Surprise! lied. Yet Logan Paul's japan forest video still 1% population died covid. Stop fear mongering spreading lies. western countries vaccinating fast US, EU vaccinated considerable part population July. 

_Should have_. VDL deem necessary invest production capacity, bought vaccines let manufacturers sort out, thus inevitably leading shitshow. don‚Äôt see reason think liking guy saying isn‚Äôt want hear.

Staying hydrated help. one mask , double mask, double mask vaccine still can‚Äôt return normal? Isn‚Äôt bit reach? data suggests vaccinated people spreading getting covid rate would considered concerning ? take account health issues part rollout.

I‚Äôm hoping eventually go back way was, last year legitimately traumatizing don‚Äôt know feelings fade time.

If thought months toilet paper bad end, imagine deal customer, employee listen people throw tantrums there‚Äôs toilet paper. Trumps best moves writing blank check continuously updating people coming.

You may hate him

But right going offense Actually, 30 days ago. remember seeing first reports deal practically done around December last year. explanation find whole AZ debacle spooked settling ""best reasonable efforts"" more. I'm glad taking videos misinformation. said, know couple youtubers videos removed debunking covid-19 conspiracy theories removed due bots falsely detecting covid misinformation. ninja edit? edit anything lol supposed 100 FEMA run mass vaccination centers. Last checked four. Feds dropped ball. No, it‚Äôs flu lasting side effects. can‚Äôt believe people stupid enough parroting Trump shit year later. Medical advice little real world practical application. charge he‚Äôd call full lockdown zero cases. 

He‚Äôs kind dr tells 300 lb patients run mile every day, eat carbs stop smoking drinking cold Turkey. It‚Äôs good advice actionable Everyone who's risk vaccinated (who intentionally reject it). 

THAT'S goal post. Open 100% risk grandma dying gone going open source. UK government stepped make licensed model? gave inexperienced company could give UK company. basically doubled fucked world over, exporting hoarding bunch doses EU, ensuring rollout go smoothly experienced company. Yes, sure - like said ‚Äúoutside Mexico Canada‚Äù meaning that‚Äôs stop number one. exceed needs, move second best use, third, on. don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre disagreeing much agreeing. So? way vaccine caused it. Insane stop rollout. Denmark want covid win? harsh Lockdown people 65? Mental health discrimination reason target forcibly isolate groups...I mean would kept deaths down?


The reason lifestyle good mental health....so mental health costs factor opening back up. I'm saying go full hog today, I'm saying may need go back normal 100% safe to. People going know 4 weeks I‚Äôm suddenly shit gone whole year lol  2 Billion COVAX start. pharmacists, vaccine cops. People shot asking put masks, think people would told ‚Äúyou lied vaccine you‚Äù cares case numbers? Old people risk people already vaccinated / mostly next month. that, what's big deal? flu us non-obese old people. 

Once there's risk killing grandma overwhelming hospitals, over. around mid april. concluded wasn‚Äôt related Pfizer vaccine, overall reaction wasn‚Äôt harsh AstraZeneca. Early on.. thinking I'd rather Astra Zeneca new ""mRNA"" vaccines... Now, I'm glad already doses Pfizer. It‚Äôs matter public opinion. It‚Äôs many people right refuse go store make requirement. public opinion shifts summer, opposite true bottom line they‚Äôll make voluntary. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Likelihood enough vaccinated people going wild week first shot ‚Äúcause another spike‚Äù pretty damn low

How instead focus positives vaccination incentivize people get instead beating people head terrible things happen don‚Äôt follow covid restrictions they‚Äôre vaccinated I'm little annoyed we've arbitrarily decided vaccines administered ~8:00am-5:30pm. slots available damn near 24/7 (assuming enough doses). stop 24/7 manufacturing height Covid, can't run something *close* 24/7 vaccinations select sites? seems like huge missed opportunity Nah, UK got 40million doses January; they've received 13 million date. yields high they'd hoped would been. defending random mess, presumably healthy retired 60 year old spends days couch watching netflix less risk immunocompromised, asthmatic/diabetic 30 year old working grocery store. says state website. would make little sense doses slow right considering food education opened recently. Half adults California eligible right even higher 15th. Oh please. 

Your beloved Pfizer vaccine created developed Biontech German. Pfizer helped mass produce it. Astra Zeneca British/Swedish. 
 spare us speeches. Firstly, seriously misinterpreted that. They're saying there's indication 'it's listed side effect', they're saying indication THUS listed side effect.

Secondly, unsurprisingly, random article 4 sentences everything said. right [an 4 said number cases vaccinated people higher general population. 11 days March 7-day rolling average shots administered barely January 30th, also big step back last week

4.5M doses yet administered

pretty disappointing Also lot countries sitting millions AZ vaccines they're flat refusing use. 

*cough* Germany *cough* Thanks you! accidentally got infected first shot (hopefully no) protection affected? mean fair we've literally known COVID-19 like 15 months? 8 months likely that's data work with. could (likely opinion) years worth immunity least. Tell about! LEARN MISTAKES Political pressure. state authority vaccination priority groups, it‚Äôs bit hodge podge. age generally predominant determining factor. mean 100 mil vaccinated 50 mil 2 doses?  Notes article

a) based 200 people;

b) includes people examined early 6 days onset symptoms, part small sample short time intervals;

c) talks B cells durable (antibodies declining 6 months), means show sterilizing immunity, antibodies ramp quickly get reinfected;

d) study that's many times week months months now. new. big North/south, red/blue divide IMO. Nationally locally red leaning people make point refuse masks corporations big cities probably make point maintain masks even 2022. think summer 2022 USA mask free California, NYC, Chicago Portland last let go.

Before anyone downvotes, there‚Äôs talk seasonal masking flu even don‚Äôt think mask eager places give quickly  engaging people looking excuse move goalposts?

There ALWAYS reason stay locked COVID. people want willing look real world data see might happen. shouldn‚Äôt mental health component

Are fucking kidding me? We‚Äôve really regressed like 50 years seriously take mental health. refused acknowledge existence, importance, pervasiveness mental health problems due covid restrictions doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt exist pay price dose, negotiated EU, number doses allocated population basis. list prices confidential, although remember Belgian politician leaking last year. 

They decide whether purchase doses not. example, many EU countries opted second Moderna contract signed long ago considered price steep them. me, comment section getting brigaded? people going keep moving goal posts. That's issue. Next thing know herd immunity enough, say need stay inside vaccine kids. legally obliged do. FHM issued recommended measures binding mean ignore disease. individual's obligation prevent spread infection
 1 Everyone shall, attention reasonable precautionary measures, contribute preventing spread infectious diseases.

From Communicable Diseases Act. 100k YEAR lot better 100k 4 months, may remind you. also time washington post's numbers much lower? think bad that. all, CureVac made way small startup, even 5 months behind Biontech, may reasons delay, eg. coma founder, etc.

Anyways, big European pharma companies international network: Novartis, Aventis, Sanofi, GSK, even smaller players like Merck KGaA probably could handled vaccine roll-out better AstraZeneca.

The reasons political, allowed discuss here. used ones have, even stopped right White House 24 election. Subscribe 12 hours huh? Perfect, time shift start lmao. I'm staying home think. Thanks again. I've never reaction minus sore arm vax, good know. Well that‚Äôs governments decided respond places, yes. 

But ask, it‚Äôs 2023, people vaccine, still 100,000 people die Covid every year worldwide(hypothetical)Why deaths matter 2.6 million people died 2019 continue die lower respiratory diseases future? answer shouldn‚Äôt, people die disease every year, it‚Äôs part society. conquered disease death. sure people suddenly figuring out. Maybe it‚Äôs first world privilege.

Source death data: gonna share smoking? or.... ""it's ill wind blows nobody good"" - Sailor's idiom Ha ha touch√©! always true. Viral shedding may still occur absence major infection raise too. 

This! really deserve it. Odds we‚Äôd get annual frequent boosters covid like flu

No, they‚Äôre not. Immunity vaccines covid likely can't get link work. makes sense would make recommendation, AB really choice vaccine get. Another point keep mind even vaccines use cell lines derived babies aborted several decades ago. ongoing harvesting babies something. It‚Äôs dangerous federal job mask. voice muffled constantly repeat point get approved US think I'm going shop around Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J ever become eligible would readily available anyways time. Try walgreens.com early morning. able get first dose past Saturday that. Yup, want states, best way get plane flight. Lasting immunity &lt;up 8 months found recovery COVID-19 vaguely remember asked question getting AZ vaccine two weeks ago. able get second dose 3 weeks interval (pfizer). got today 6 weeks 1 day since first dose. research situation? Some. Definitely all. Tons places employees back office buildings months already. Time happened.

I see users posting anti-distancing majorly favor 8 months ago, yes hope vaccine helped, huge factor time limit mitigation behavior psychologically, time limit wayy pandemic scientifically over.

Everyone breaking point all, honestly refreshing sub taken turn puts much line country is. reality people taking seriously months now...nothing done that.  ty &lt;3 good know we're alone! Well know clinical trial data people get infected sick, like placebo group, it‚Äôs time shots makes difference. don‚Äôt know wouldn‚Äôt cause spike, certainly everyone got injected went covid party day, se spike. come way get vaccinated get sick, you‚Äôre going give vaccine someone deserving. one gives shit still want wear mask over. anything? help 99% country once

Ehhh $75,000 limit ignores high cost living areas exist huge step right direction. live major city, $75,000 minimum need make live alone. know people make struggling rent cities mind numbingly expensive. don‚Äôt live major city, bill huge relief. probably won‚Äôt think it‚Äôs early sure that. could production issues one vaccines etc. get it‚Äôs easy shit US think might feel differently American position. We‚Äôre comfortable position helping others yet, we‚Äôre still trying stop hemorrhaging. Well, governor has. Seems ignored science advisors it. prefer follow science. saying go act like safe, gonna cause another spike. know two weeks *first* shot, already immunity levels initially expected vaccine. So, no, probably get probably cause another spike. year ago job wasn‚Äôt going anywhere relationship clarity. trying make changes pandemic hit putting pause life general. year it‚Äôs figure also can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs year?! currently indication vaccination caused conditions, listed side effects vaccine,‚Äù EMA said quality defect considered unlikely stage, batch quality investigated.‚Äù

It's right ema says article. quote like 75% article must tough foreign intruder xenophobic leadership . Well broke everything except mention foreign aid. Seems weird leave considering sizeable amount. Why‚Äôd comment get downvoted? Ppl weird Interesting, read anything that. Thanks. lot people dealing issues (anxiety/depression, social isolation, hopelessness, etc) first time people mental health problems dealing whole life.

it's pretty bad me, far worse year life. entire time high school worse lol, that's going back decade.  listing much individual member state paid? can't find it. cool thank response, wanted make sure alone lol, know is. feel bad bad per se, feel kind like, swimmy head fatigued normal like wanna exert physical energy anything. 

That's good news though, means bodies üí™üí™üí™ job push back human nature. saying predicts local governments lift restrictions, saying around should. giving medical advice, political forecasts. Right, let's kill GeRmAnYfUnDeDdEvElOpMeNt-myth, create ItSmOsTlYfOrMaRkEtInG-lie literally messaging health professionals. wear mask protect around you. whatever reason, many people seeing wearing mask fearful thing.

Like, man, I'm vaccinated still wear mask everywhere public indoor settings outdoors close somebody. I'm afraid, want people feel protected. see hundred times whining doomsayers actual doomsayers. real find annoying every good news thread full complaining occasional person who's overly cautious. Fact matter calling young healthy people take vaccine. simply borderline dangerous. YES incredibly selfish saying, making one forcing segregation upon vaccinated. Imagine unable get also at-risk, people like irrational fear perfectly fine vaccines, worked tested worlds best scientists, make can't live life would normally able to. Fuck mentality. difference is: would need start accepting significant amount risk normal think smarter scientists?

Stop child screaming MuH RiGhtS feel like CoErCeD. Dude, simple thing making world better place. give EVERYONE opportunity participate society again. get vaccinated, also get tested regularly decide get vaccine, show already virus, get herd immunity. Im pro vaccine passport either, irrational people like kinda force unlike society care others. Ooh, colleague owes coffee reason! Beverage based bets win! Wow knew vaccines safe. saw many scientists medical professionals saying NBC nightly News Pfizer moderna vaccines 100% safe. question draw conclusion without long-term studies? Since vaccines made less year happens 3 5 years who've taken it? Botox technically filler. It‚Äôs muscle paralyzer. Fillers substances fill skin stay long period time (6 months more).

No one got sicker bad flu.

So no, flu, saying way worse flu that's experience majority people within age group has, hard make believe bad them. create identical spike antibody. know certain well vaccine works see real world data.

50 percent efficacy still high enough falls within 50-60 percent range hoped initially. sky falling yet. Right, get away that, stops tons people lying vaccination status? really can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs ballpark sort estimate. vaccine proved least effective trials, AZ‚Äôs (62.5%) showed far worst efficacy SA variant, vaccines performed better DG614 B.117 seem retained moderate efficacy South African isolate Okay least glad I'm alone mild first shot. Agreed though I'm prepared feel pretty trash days, covid even minor yours, shot still nothing compared imagine. 

Glad almost got second! must excited Thanks Dr. u/Fugusandwich. cool! Worst case much cases. least limit freedom ordinary citizens. later way important tbh. Wake inside mean yeah setting randomized controlled trial lockdowns practical 

I‚Äôm saying doesn‚Äôt make sense say lockdowns ~obviously~ worth ~obviously~ worth it

Downvote want think anyone who‚Äôs 100% sure either side honest really thinking through. It‚Äôs simple obvious, especially we‚Äôre still thick things reasons, too.

It lead vaccinated people clamor allowed ignore restrictions like masking &amp; distancing...

Which, allowed, create incentives morons lie vaccination status.

Pretty much every decision made filtered lens ""what non-trivial fraction populace uses information change intentionally harm possible?"". Getting shot monday, also getting botox migraine short after. reading stuff dermal fillers bad reactions. Anyone care help sort out? Migraine doctor saying received info knowledge none patients vaccine adverse effects. sub full liars people ‚Äúswear‚Äù ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find test‚Äù. I‚Äôm saying can‚Äôt get reinfected sub 90 percent bullshit. Source? UK Israel.   14 days beginning. look /r/COVID19, maybe search ""Israel"".  must new then. used pure doom gloom here. def changed there‚Äôs much anymore six months ago sub toxic fuck. EASTER!!!!

/s ones gonna mass produce anything don‚Äôt know works Even without potential side effects objectively inferior vaccine Pfizer. focus producing high quality vaccines work new variants? I'm fully vaccinated far good. N=1 I'm US expat living Germany. 

Being US citizen kind pain ass sometimes nice I'll able enter US months get vaccine instead waiting 2022 get ""the right way"" Germany. might ethical thing frankly neither EU's vaccine ""roll out."" 

Also still get stimmies even though live abroad. It‚Äôs also worth keeping mind J&amp;J used moderate severe cases believe.

I don‚Äôt know efficacy compared really easily. is, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad. I‚Äôve hesitant draw types comparisons given vaccine target region spike think infer similar efficacy mRNA vaccines considering two vaccines, Novavax‚Äôs Janssens somewhat similar efficacy (55% 64%) scientists caution extrapolating efficacy figures distinctly different vaccine technologies, ran different trials, different times. 

Not mention, Moderna Pfizer set begin boosters specifically VOCs, hopefully sake, moot discussion distant future. patient mine told growing polio times, mother forbade play inside house houses friends, matter weather. much fear. Well disease really deadly say 40. sensible thing first would ""vaccinate females breeding age currently pregnant"" ""thought"" fully vaccinated female may pass protection unborn breast feeding child. looks like trying get vaccinated covid-19. help? There's way know. think people exposed recovered side effects. I'd tend agree, except I'm keeping masks anti-vaxxers get vaccine killing themselves. Search /r/COVID19Positive reinfection. Depending variant reinfections occur spite Jan '21 article. happened S.African Brazilian variant would likely get reinfected known strain however. Vaccines seem protect variants least 120 days (length phase 3 trial) - data coming. Likely much longer thx B/T cells. That's immune system works though ‚ÄúCould large numbers people openly disagreeing signal shift public opinion? Nah, it‚Äôs probably Russian bots something, lol.‚Äù light much end tunnel.

I think technically light always end tunnel. get that, really do. disagree US preventing private companies fulfilling contracts countries acting like saviours pledging donate surplus vaccines... someday future. got second week ago side effect lymph node inflammation started like 2 days later. Felt perfectly fine. Hopefully get lucky too. small trial, would liked see Phase 3 data South Africa.

Considering J&amp;J 64% effective think expect similar result mRNA vaccines SA results Novavax add credence dramatically, probably much chance struck lightning. think anyone sub gone without seeing post explaining media politicians people want panic fear blah blah blah. Variants unknown they're new, like original strain was, really bad thing novel pathogens know much bad ones really really bad stuff happens. Best avoid that, way convince people take seriously. Uk definitely told people concerned UK variant, too, have. Incorrect data. reinfected depending variant. Furthermore, science starts w/ hypothese, gathers data, updates hypothesis. probably went wastage, good amount probably administered reported. also reports lot 2nd dose appt cancellations. Rolling eyes this. Barely anyone get Canada now. think vaccines, especially one mRNA use spike proteins train immune system.

All studies shown reduced antibodies SA variant, including Pfizer‚Äôs show seven fold reduction. 

This one first studies however proper efficacy calculation instead counting volume antibodies - suggests vaccines likely need adapted.

I think scientists would surprised result didn‚Äôt carry vaccine types. One year ago said fall 2021 normal it‚Äôs looking pretty accurate. Same. told mom. couple friends since comparing reactions. Otherwise one's business if/when I've gotten suddenly medical experts countries lost ability understand basic maths?

Yes, seen Norway suddenly noticed old people died getting vaccinated halted tham. **Even tho deaths completely normal rate age group**

Halting vaccine foundation massive head shake, countries already agreed. Even Danish SSI believe cause concern. vice chief medical officer UK indicated can't guaranty yield, case make vaccine hope ready yield good. UK seem able make 2 million doses per week. EU production much difficult need manufacture substantially vaccine. Also fix tried implement would still take 2 3 months see impact whether worked.  BioNTech funded Germany. Research funded UPenn. get data, need country accurate testing covid19 deaths. use testing quarantine people confirmed covid19. can't imagine country paying testing without using benefits. No, flu also vaccine many adults children taken, something existed covid now. say there's mitigation flu would incorrect. probably go age like 50 next. expect amounts given continue rise. Also would surprised say small % say 20-30 year old's get shot. Lol. inadequate federal response coupled state state measures lack masking early on. 

A national lockdown never needed. Restrictions regional lockdowns travel curbs would better. think lack vaccines kids time used excuse keep schools closed september? (I really really really hope not) talking people getting vaccinated since January sure getting downvoted. Per current info seems correct. Yeah, think intended reply guy saying prioritize Latin America. I'm that, Brazil could certainly use vaccine... suspect that's new mandate allocate 40% doses vulnerable zip codes.

Huh there's good reason suspended. Got voted shit saying likely diabolic Danish conspiracy taking AstraZeneca. Also important note health status impacted. E.g affected otherwise healthy that's lot strange even within overall occurrence rate. one moved goal posts. It‚Äôs 10-14 days since beginning. Vaccines lower amount virus shed mask does. case plenty people keep wearing them, seems like point mandate vaccinated unnecessary.

Yeah, places opened astra Zeneca 60-64, PHU opened everyone phase 2 (so 65+ included that), phus soon. Sorry, I'm sure many people want give administration called hoax credit whatsoever, cuz deserve it. There‚Äôs ton variables, though. mask 100% time outside home? fitted correctly? re-wearing mask multiple times? eating outside home? else live with, COVID hygiene like? around family members unmasked? washing hands taking mask off?

Literally million variables influence whether one catches virus not, beyond quality mask. KN95 offer protection standard surgical especially cloth mask, course 100% virus-proof. 

I think statements like ‚ÄúI wore mask got COVID‚Äù generally unhelpful don‚Äôt provide useful information, reasons I‚Äôve stated more.  Mine dumb purchase make. could gotten powerblocks bench normal price last March. remember saying ""damn... I'm gonna wind buying this, things gonna return normal weeks it'll waste money.""

Haven‚Äôt back since, it‚Äôs one hell year. remember nervous hell I‚Äôd get thing, yet year later today got 2nd vaccine dose. Here‚Äôs hoping worst behind us! saying relatable. hard look collective society lens past, especially last year - better worse. I‚Äôm sure yet. 

Congratulations getting vaccinated! hope start better days next year brings many better moments.  think Biden means term vaccinate American ""Citizens"" literally terms nationality. think means everyone living US. Nobody asking passports birth certificates vaccine sites. It‚Äôs news spent last four years administration a) would position potentially surplus vaccines, b) would done exactly said: completely ignorant wrong ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù policy (which clearly always actually hurts us, great getting votes idiots) could that, without vaccine, they'd massive spike, vaccine, cases ""only"" dropped 50%. cases UK looking promising. means state good job, federal government poorly.

Quarantine still recommended won‚Äôt outside Mexico Canada, exposure becomes much based Air travel. probably far exposure Japan, South Korea, Germany Brazil Argentina. people working interface public, still haven‚Äôt able get shot, even despite 50 years old (makes 70% deaths)? fuck people right?

You know people bills pay too, right? open let make informed decision risks. Boy really like new information comes out, you? really like truthful Fauci *everything* throughout whole thing. Honest forthcoming matter what, impressively, right *everything*. amazing public servant. imagine would ""former guy"" left decide things himself? Yikes! Thanks Fauci experts CDC!

I really ask people got vaccine, I'm mid-30s know good amount people gotten already.

At point, judgement me. I'm willing so, fine waiting another month so. mask still required? still restrictive imo 10 days ago, big chills, several bouts intense fatigue, arm sensitive almost week, that's it. So, noticeable secondary effects, yes, barely worse flu shot get every year. Plan rest couple days, fine.

we'll get free things soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Health mental health

Not saying mental health important, reinforcing need masks everyone vaccinated crucial saving many lives possible. agree! South Koreans listen experts like Fauci equivalent. Americans don't, many got infected died. qualify (even technicality) get shot. Lying unethical, going duty get shot soon you‚Äôre able. Luck preparation meets opportunity. Wives war criminals what? Uhhuh, that's going lead half nation suddenly beong ""vaccinated"" - exactly? WA state approved hazard pay grocery store workers. Pretty dumb took 1 yr.  Feels like caught 50mph baseball. FYI anyone unaware, Washington Times propaganda outlet cult, Unification Church, also known Moonies. Take grain salt. yes. even know lol.

what weird virus. nothing worry overwhelming majority others death sentence.

it'll interesting see comes continue research years learn more. don‚Äôt know anyone mentioned today marks 1 year since Rudy Gobert tested positive virus shut NBA. day people started panic. It‚Äôs crazy see far we‚Äôve come since then. almost feels like taunted vaccinated people. Yes I'm glad recognized Fauci lie anything. urge people eat delicious steak everyday live big, fancy, luxury houses. ok first things first. lets get ahead ourselves. mama aint got vax yet Washington Times? Yeah....I'll pass. Yes lot people don‚Äôt even death certa custom burying people day. reported Returning normal gonna mindset. end day, goal flatten curve manageable amount hospitalizations bring deaths low possible. I'd say we've done that, continue that.

I think Texas Rangers announcing 100% capacity good example mindset we're facing right now. Personally, think 100% capacity bit much early. think starting 50% even 75% plans increase 100% realistic smarter. BUT... therein lies problem. happens numbers decrease still liking months? think 100% capacity much push goal posts back more?

There's error setting goal saying ""once hit X, we'll y."" spend time pushing X, get X X longer good enough.

As said friend: lived last year scared. I'm living year smart cautiously. I'll live life assess something may much risk I'll skip. I'm gonna shame people going something agree with. state Midwest, cases initial lockdown happened. seemed really pre-emptive this, conforming states seemed right thing do. time strict part lockdown over, people tired werent taking seriously numbers started get control. Many people thought since lockdown mostly over, probably wasnt reason concerned anymore. I've learned lot. Firstly, I've learned I'm tough thought was. year stressful living stressful world took toll me. Secondly, learned world much fragile would believe. lost lot faith leadership good spirit countrymen women. learned people married tradition patterns life take away telling might do.

It tough year, happy made 365 days without major scare, worried future. Got vaccinated monday, basically one year heard Covid. One must wonder next year holds. Thanks confirming said, new information came recommendations changed. really fantastic job! okay, thanks info Could made injection device cause visible scar?

I still see scar smallpox vaccine got 51 years ago. Yeah agree. Can‚Äôt say people video. get started. Literally every European Canadian poster spent past year CORRECTLY pointing Covid response absolute shit-show. 

Now finally getting handle things, selfish. Thanks... happened orders never came Jan/Feb ... Annexation would include cornering palestinians statelets effective sovereignty claiming settlers citizens, similarly bantustans Apartheid South Africa. Can't get anti-clot shots like surgery need stay bed long time recover from? make appointment? Every online appt. look pharmacy asked qualifying questions feel comfortable lying...

We 60% sign rate (out 1000) I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs going drop now. Half coworkers said today they‚Äôre getting this. I‚Äôm cancel appointment tomorrow well. 

Honestly trust Icelandic Danish governments trust Dutch government right now. fine know one. PA Wolf moved teachers 1A works daycare suspect connections mother working healthcare father board works. Everyone else know 1A start. Almost dozen. many folks ignored part eligible based job job person/had direct contact. Got vax despite ""in person/direct contact"" part true. incredibly effective vaccines, tbh. Actually Americans refused listen medical experts like Fauci CDC, US failed bad. Obesity, bad diets exercise staying home favorite politicians told hoax. Thank goodness experts like Fauci! expert advice never caught it.

Also, South Korea survielance-type system allowed track fine people following rules. Interesting see want something like here!

Thank opportunity correctly informed truths regarding Fauci, CDC, incredible minds led vaccine development, keeping families like mine safe recommendations getting us safely 100% open hopefully September. Thank Fauci! certainly **no thanks** previous president, thankfully lost 2020 historic blowout election, trying stop Biden's America First policies. experiences life equitable others.

I PTSD traumatic events I've masks definitely triggered me. 

So, better, guess. agree. something (and still questionable) likely related specific batch maybe manufacturing facility. like soreness arm feeling bit unwell short period getting shot.

It's strange reported. like fairly common type vaccine? remember getting muscle soreness several days swine flu vaccine nothing reported. done so? logic wearing mask you‚Äôve vaccinated? state receives 100 vaccines administers 99 them, metric state spectacular.

That would pretty bad metric use. Please please please allow vaccinated people go back normal now, since science supports it. done tyrannical laws. want live dystopia longer. Carter's presidency big turd sandwich, he's hell good person. Classic armchair bullshit criticism without providing information suggestions towards better solution 

Sounds like Republican People classify themselves. got spend time analyzing data. structured like aimed presentation paper. agree wholeheartedly.

That said, one thing Donald right whole tenure, ordering metric-shit-ton vaccine.  exactly it. Fauci makes nuanced claims people absolutely hostile concept nuance political discussion. something normal mean praised. Yup. haven‚Äôt eaten inside year. Post vaccine, I‚Äôll probably wear mask indoor public places stops normal thing do, otherwise, I‚Äôm fully back normal. REALLY?! going start arresting people WEARING mask?! scared sit around stay home people need stay home sit around get killed correct? yeh

where 100 million doses at, again? parents essential workers, theyre 60s, NONE us find place vaccines life us.  think people understand protected vaccine, protected otherwise, make decisions best families.

More likely get shot can, likely take precautions time.  base anything speculation. would want that? Reporting hunch good science. Fauci straight said interviews ""don't wear mask"" advice hospitals running out. factcheck posted even says then, critical issue save masks people really needed felt shortage masks."" Mostly health care workers got vaccine. Nice, putting life danger everyone even offered best vaccine market. don‚Äôt get weren‚Äôt front queue better vaccines market, deserve anyone also health care system goes fucked top priority people safe. Like... Mandating wearing pants? mean, can't really imagine hesitant take one vaccines gonna minds changed guys, good them, guess? wearing mask post vaccination right thing? end pandemic you. Oh, interesting know whole state. Idk, feel like CA get together pretty quickly. I'm actually currently trying help sister get vaccinated another state shockingly even worse CA's availability so. also managed get vaccinated 2 days ago. I'm optimistic :) Somewhere around 255 million counting people 18 older. Holy shit ü§£ I've reading lot people wanting get covod vaccine think vaccine protect strains countries get vaccinated. I'm talking people's ignorance toward getting vaccinated lack education regarding annual vaccination processes. Lmao don‚Äôt insurance tons government programs. someone didn‚Äôt those, decision. 

Who Canada bankrupt? - **[the entire country Canada second indebted nation world. think hospitals old fo date? Poor funding.

Why think healthcare workers get paid little? Poor funding.

Why think contribute basically nothing toward R&amp;D? Poor funding. 

This vaccine perfect example. Canada contributed nothing all, leech US.

Plus individuals hurt financially [the much deeper economic decline slower expected recovery. Always been. j&amp;j vaccine janssen study saw dvt. 
Pfizer Moderna see dvt could related fact accepted healthier individuals. I‚Äôm thinking they‚Äôre gonna release separate guidelines households underage kids don‚Äôt Fall. 

They consider public realistically willing don‚Äôt see child-free adults staying another year protect people‚Äôs kids. There's never appointments. seen 30 people puking brown line time *so long*, god miss that. one adenovirus vectored vaccine disease caused side effects (big if) pick another one preferred choice? mean idea vaccines didn‚Äôt anything prevent transmission appeared pretty unlikely frankly anti-scientific start. Sure didn‚Äôt trial data transmission knew things:

1. Many vaccines reduce transmission hence whole concept ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù.

2. People recovered case COVID-19 rarely test positive (and knew studies healthcare workers routinely tested regardless symptoms) it‚Äôs like reason believe immunity virus would prevent sickness.

3. Moderna/Pfizer produce immune response least strong people recovered Covid-19 prevent whopping 95% symptomatic cases seemed likely would prevent asymptomatic ones too.

4. We‚Äôve long known contact tracing people fully asymptomatic never go develop symptoms don‚Äôt spread virus often others due lower viral loads shorter infectious periods.

I may epidemiologist read lot studies virus pointed things months ago along many people. think messaging ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know reliably vaccines prevent transmission, likely reduce likelihood extent‚Äù. 

All pushing idea vaccines don‚Äôt prevent transmission beginning even started getting better evidence Israel (the dozens strongly worded articles little vaccinated people came much like don‚Äôt prevent transmission we‚Äôre sure) unnecessarily keeping vaccinated people isolated encouraging vaccine hesitancy. literally said believe country selflessness. political. Russia China effectively one-party states authoritarian governments. Putin care thousand Russians die buy influence Middle East Latin America. US suspect even Democrats would willing impeach Biden started giving away vaccines even seniors teachers vaccinated. 

And public health perspective, make sense one hardest hit countries giving away vaccines. Even recent huge reduction cases US still averaging 1500 deaths day. Brazil, whose government seem want them, countries need vaccines much US right now?

Your argument seems US give away wealthy country, regardless impact citizens. ban export fully made vaccines

Of course buy necessary? seem like great thing share bought many. incredible sub extremely rational year, trusted medical professionals rightly questioned government decisions.

Now suddenly medical experts countries lost ability understand basic maths?

Everyone needs calm down, sound like 'covid 99.9% survival rate' folks.

I'm gonna go ahead assume significantly detail story countries take action likely reduce public confidence vaccine program. Whoa, seen site before. That's awesome. funny CNN makes article like every article doomsday scenarios covid. It‚Äôs disgusting manipulate people. might infection period time positive test? Otherwise super quick even without vaccine, yes. RIP make appointment massvax sites like 6 flags M&amp;T think eligible, verification there. First dose takes 21-24 days reach maximum effectiveness, second dose takes 2 weeks. 

And remember even *start* producing antibodies day 12 post injection. get cavalier injection maintain vigilance catching covid-19 right get vaccinated Alanis Morissette song. 

And lastly plan anything 24 hours post vaccination, 40% people suffer side effects bad enough call sick. notice. care. Yeah, I'm optimistic Canada's vaccine rollout, despite lack domestic production. started poorly Pfizer Moderna delays January given recent developments AZ, J&amp;J eventually Novavax coming think meet September target, get done earlier. 

I hope Ontario drop ball vaccination campaign. basically stuck 2020 start letting guard back back 2020

What mean ""letting guard down?"" include stopping vaccination altogether, think highly unlikely. 

(Not say abandoning social distancing measures yet, vaccines still game changer wave deaths unlikely scale unless infections increase massively behavior change response). One lessons taken pandemic, science public relations two different fields. economy get rolling vaccination? screwed, vaccination campaign made one thing mind, votes intermediate elections july, we'll would worse. vaccination plan country followed thought, people would vaccinated April... 2022. Now, even close fullfil plan rythm government expected, long ago predictions 25 year old healthy person would get vaccine 2035. definitely depending US help us get going. 

All shame since vaccination system actually decent. example, vaccines followed strategy similar one use influenza, could vaccinate everyone 3 months but... Well that's happening caused massive disruption am, specifically people delayed getting second dose. Iirc, affected 2,000 people. teacher friends them. every year, like flu vaccine, covid vaccine get released cover predicted biggest strain groups following ""viral season"". Im really praying things handled every else world

Edit: typo That's great. Except surplus? supposed get mine ago. 2 (life threatening) conditions qualify keep getting told stock. When‚Äôs going answer questions hold press conference? inaccurate, obviously. US ban export fully made vaccines fill&amp;finish J&amp;J made multiple locations across world (including EU).  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

**Use AstraZeneca¬†Covid-19 vaccine suspended six European countries blood clot fears.**

Austria‚Äôs national medicines regulator suspended use batch AstraZeneca vaccine four patients diagnosed dangerous blood clotting conditions receiving jab.

One person died multiple thrombosis ‚Äì formation blood clots within blood vessels ‚Äì 10 days vaccine, European Medicines Agency (EMA) said.

A second patient diagnosed pulmonary embolism ‚Äì blockages form arteries lungs ‚Äì recovering.

Now, Denmark also suspended use vaccine director Danish Health Authority, Soren Brostrom, confirmed statement.

He said: ""Both Danish Medicines Agency respond reports possible serious side-effects, Denmark European countries.‚Äù

Mt Brostrom stressed stage Denmark opted using vaccine.

""It important emphasise opted using the¬†AstraZeneca¬†vaccine, putting hold,"" said.

The health agency said vaccine would suspended 14 days.

 

The EMA said currently evidence vaccine caused conditions, thrombosis listed potential side effect vaccine.

It said batch labelled ABV5300 comprised one million doses delivered 17 EU countries.

Four countries ‚Äì Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia ‚Äì suspended use allow time EMA‚Äôs Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) conduct investigation.

AstraZeneca told [**The vaccien shots subject strict rigorous quality checks.

They said ""no confirmed serious adverse events associated vaccine"".

The EMA said: ‚ÄúAlthough quality defect considered unlikely stage, batch quality investigated.‚Äù

It said PRAC investigating thrombosis conditions linked batch well reports thrombosis related blood clotting conditions reported post-vaccination.

‚ÄúThe information available far indicates number thromboembolic events vaccinated people higher seen general population,‚Äù said.

The EMA said Tuesday, 22 reports conditions among three million people receive AstraZeneca jab European Economic Area.

It said information would released investigation progresses.  us spotty WFH office shut down, quickly turned practically permanent. went coming in, collaborating rooms, ping pong, walking local lunch spots, teleconferencing, odd hours productivity (for children).

From March April, bit hopelessness set in, know end. Around late April/May, things started open up, gatherings reduced, remained outside gatherings.

Take became big (for me), also started cooking/baking more. Homemade pizza? Got it! kitchen tools also great, learned sharpen knife, eventually also bought newer one. pots pans (dutch oven FTW), upgrades ingredients, etc -- lock down. budget heavily went kitchen gear vs. clothing!

Summer Fall mostly better: places open, gatherings would remain outside (mostly). November started, knew we'd back lock down, everyone stores gearing big family gatherings. Even people planning big Thanksgiving meals, way covid spreading overall activity shops/grocery/etc.

A year later, ""end"" little clear, exact. Vaccinations clearly play role gaining necessary herd immunity, take time. Even manufacturers could Thanos snap fingers produce enough immediately, logistics delivery actual pokes take bit time. 

At least CA, I'm guessing mask mandates limitations indoor gatherings lifted EOY. Winter another surge cases (variants), believe like 2020. vaccine supply US expected surpass demand late April early May. Nobody certain happen point Biden allow exports countries. one get voluntarily. Hopefully deliver. Can't believe one year. remember anxiety first detected case March 1, lawyer New Rochelle, containment zone, cases popping around area. think reality finally hit home hardest closed schools, NYC schools close almost nothing. 

On bright side, told one year ago today whole family, girlfriend's whole family would fully vaccinated COVID-19, mind would blown. We've come far. ‚ÄúLike viruses, sars-CoV-2 continue evolve. McLellan believes limited number moves available. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lot space spike continue change ways allow evade antibodies still bind receptor,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúSubstitutions allow virus resist antibodies probably also decrease affinity ace-2‚Äù‚Äîthe receptor virus uses enter cells.

Looks like it. began first vaccinations Oxford 7 February. mean, they're right. long still intend ship US fill finish anything coming EU unless EO lifted US. That's everybody Maryland already cheating system Hogan wants prioritize liars. ‚ÄúSorry gramps, gotta lock you‚Äôll never able see family again.‚Äù US could reach normals September willean nothing countries like Brazil fucking rest world. March 12, 2020 probably craziest day life. reading covid weeks concerned it, still felt like something kind far away. got school, everyone talking school area closed ""deep cleaning"" day, wondering would happen us.

In morning, nothing cancelled yet. first period class talked whether thought school would cancelled, teacher said way school would cancelled extended period time absolutely plan conduct online learning.

Then, hours later, big debate tournament scheduled evening cancelled. chem teacher said thought school might get cancelled sometime next week, spring break would probably get extended. Everyone phones class looking news coronavirus, even though class never go phone. person sitting next joked phones class, world must really ending. 

Around 1pm, everyone got email saying extracurricular clubs cancelled (but sports). supposed track meet afternoon, coach emailed us saying freak meet still happening. sitting friends track lunch rolled eyes. Sure enough, half hour later, got another email saying meet cancelled meet gym school.

During last period class, supposed working project, one could focus. governor made announcement coronavirus time, teacher showed video screen class. People class saying heard sports cancelled whole month.

I remember going bathroom class seeing someone first period class hallway, looked shouted ""What going on"" time felt like much changed hours ago. Everything felt surreal. 

After school, every single sport crammed gym. weird none coaches idea going saying different things. think heard word ""unprecedented"" day every before. Walking gym felt anticlimactic; supposed feel adrenaline butterflies stomach running race, instead felt kind nervousness felt deeper butterflies go away race started.

With sports extracurriculars cancelled, knew school would cancelled soon. night, school emailed us saying tomorrow, Friday, March 13, would last day school attendance would optional, we'd start ""spring break"" early extra week switching remote learning indefinite amount time.

 One teachers emailed us rather angry email saying excuse miss exam tomorrow, even bring study. Friday crazy too, that's another story... Sorry, I‚Äôm familiar ‚Äú/s.‚Äù indicate?  I‚Äôm taking xanax everyday, show anxious brazilian testifying genocide That's exactly OP saying Thanks sharing experience. kind insight looking for. Hopefully adenoviruses delivered US filling vials Biden allow finished product exported. Thank goodness USA totally reopen wave infections  /s page shared shows raw numbers California appear deaths populated, doesnt show death numbers adjusted population state.

Anyway, dont lockdowns ineffective, dont think anything Florida. 

I think important factor fact Florida large percentage population older age group. know governor gets little criticism vaccine rollout prioritize seniors first (other states bigger deal Florida lot seniors residing). lot would've achieved immunity now. Thanks. confess baffled response comment, really expressing sympathy Europe facing. argued putting people jail gathering public authoritarian. Wowza.  Source? feeling drop little stipulation city starts brining long missed tax revenue. lot ground make up. Honestly, think hear city say allowing Cubs (and Sox) increase capacity hear tell teams fans. help first even dogged last year? I'm helping everyone else look first. people hunker socially distance polio scourge? know of. would've happened COVID.   autonomy involved. 

Say population low, would civic duty women carry children help repopulate? would ok government force this? answer obviously no.

Regardless vaccines safe causing harm person, people right choose want bodies.

Besides, people get vaccine already protected themselves, matter neighbor past point? Part disappointment extends pandemic, certainly beyond borders.

We heading future large problems need serious global cooperation politically. know countries never agree work together anything, get that. Vaccine nationalism reinforced that.

But still really hoping least allies able come together politically work securing future.

The scientific community largely already done this, need leadership board. Oxford vaccine even mRNA :/ People don‚Äôt realize this.  Brazil ‚Äúlet ride it‚Äôs big deal‚Äù perspective sharing coworkers wanted US.  consistently spouted concept aren‚Äôt allowed use HCQ whatever flavor hour regimen we, shit not, blood hands.  literally everything could action wise undermine effort slow spread society gain actual shared understanding SARS Cov 2 pathology. 

About month ago became clear Brazil effed conversation one enlightening BZ population popping HCQ like candy demand doctors give cocktail hour getting avail.

Her answer, ‚ÄúHow sure aren‚Äôt encountering counterfeit pharmaceuticals‚Äù. huge corporate savings expenses, like dinners/lunches, travel, etc, plus reduced utility bills unused buildings. Many companies beginning reduce space size too. wife's company reduced 35% anticipation WFH permanent option. Commercial real estate going take huge hit future.  Even animal trial overlapped human trials, fact remains OWS nothing planning animal trials human trials, stated. 

they still presented animal data FDA meeting, long term data present. valuable data animal studies first couple months, adverse effects rarely appear that, case vaccine studied. 

It's shown animal models terrible anyways pharma trials. value animal data miniscule compared phase 1/2/3 data presented FDA meetings December. Nobody look human study go ""hold on, happened animal study, can't give approval otherwise"" ESPECIALLY FDA never mandated preclnical animal studies. feel similarly thinking mask-wearers crazy February 2020.  mean already covid shouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated? diseases never really go away own. Polio still scourge vaccine, long, long time. doesn‚Äôt matter you‚Äôre living suburban McMansion, us living HCOL areas like Bay Area NYC employers passing costs employees.

I move apartment 3 roommates 2BR function work. buy office equipment like monitors, desks, chair. Given I‚Äôm apartment working day, spend way time cleaning. there‚Äôs loss free food, coffee, snacks, etc. work tech. Labor Day, 100% school aged children back school full time 5 days week. within couple weeks happening vast majority employers order WFH white collar workers head back office. remaining restrictions lifted.

Plus works now, teams still know ""pre covid times"", would different new people we're gonna need help get. suspect see thing happen US &amp; UK. 

As hospitalizations drop, general attitude shift ""covid over"" cases actually increase/plateau spreads amongst younger cohorts gamed system good cause. better throwing shots away sitting shelf.

I really care much point everyone get access vaccines soon anyway, feel obligated point refresh appointment web site repeatedly find open appointment, much likely shot would gone someone actual underlying health condition would thrown out. mind gamed system, I'm glad vaccinated hope take full advantage it, let's get carried away ""good cause"" justification here. ""might"" dismiss logic reliance actual facts emotion want - know makes feel superior, however emotion emotion data favor wrong.

There great real world data Pfizer. Slightly less Moderna (no Israel equivalent). outstanding questions whether equal effectiveness vs variants. enough lab-based data suggesting there‚Äôs difference, companies acting though difference (Moderna recruiting booster trial; don‚Äôt know Pfizer/bntx are), cannot assume always act exactly real world effectiveness vs variants. test. goalposts - act way/provide equivalent protection vs variants real world not.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need like [thegracefuldork's prediction vaccine previous prediction. ""rosier"", better.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

It‚Äôs deadly people get - far fewer get vaccine. article doesn‚Äôt say states‚Ä¶ Aren‚Äôt least 50-55 million people n states? weren‚Äôt 330 million people pee pool. Plus several states making plans adjust restrictions, including CA, next month so. r/coronavirus: smh Americans don‚Äôt wear masks!

Also r/coronavirus: study shows 99% people want masks forever! Don‚Äôt let it. Likely unrelated. odds way favor getting COVID-19 Holy shit, feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading replies this. Biden criticized (and rightly so) aiming high enough 100M doses 100 days goal, since already 900k doses/day took office.

I dislike Trump much next guy, facts still matter. I‚Äôm Alabama (live FL family Alabama) people driving Mississippi get shots hard get Alabama. mom 65 range got one day. wife getting FL Saturday teacher. Almost entire family vaccinated except diabetic mom dialysis, needs most. tiers awful. cannot believe I'm downvoted something confirmed factually correct 30 seconds research.

Well, guess believe /r/coronavirus still.... family described happy healthy individual ‚Äúhad energy‚Äù people around her. family also said single mom known health problems pre-existing conditions. 

Surely death absolutely nothing vaccine. Otherwise healthy people known die suddenly. Yeah no. I'll cooperate now, ""100 days', quit. never germphobe... intention start now. stop there? say, virus give superpowers finally prove superior in-laws. 

Whose me? Anyone? No? Ok.... Result WWII, how? help pig fuck escape consequence painting nice picture internet articles. J&amp;J rises 90% 60 days? seen that. Sorry awful experience, reassuring immune system kicked hyperdrive full year getting covid. sticking guns, even though Alaska extended adults today Ohio lowering age limits 50 tomorrow? I'm politically savvy enough know exact reasons action would taken. know money one part power, others. Rest assured knowing move done hopes giving US kind political leverage somewhere agree think might shrewd decision Cuba would ultimately fantastic country give vaccines method trying increase America's influence Cuba vs Russia country.  And? Last check, covid cases deaths suggest countries less inclined open borders US. yes question anyone? would take years get infrastructure place even remotely support distribution. going happen reasonable timeframe vaccines. Others, yes. underestimate amount work necessary -- buying freezers installing them. downvoted because, Big Lebowski quote goes, he's wrong, he's asshole. realize children 14 account around 60M lot people refuse vaccines too? That‚Äôs said. Get every American wants one vaccine rest go rest world –Ω–∞—Ö—É–π –∏–¥–∏ Helping vaccinate neighbors makes much sense perspective. making sure countries vaccinate, US actually protecting health (and economic!) interests.

What good vaccinating people countries corona jumping happily person person mutates variant Moderna Pfizer won‚Äôt help against? That‚Äôs basically inviting pandemic back in. us feds rerouting planes states. Mass use sports team plane hide PPE feds.

The USA primarily responsible amount covid pouring Canada. Canada sent wood pulp raw materials making N95s, refused honour orders seized shipments destined us. again, Canada lost vaccines sided USA China, refused release vaccines ordered paid USA did, Canada.

And no, it‚Äôs fine things. wouldn‚Äôt expect anything else. know USA works surprising. However, best interest Canada (and aligned personal view) stop leaning country takes nationalistic view global pandemic, lean organization takes global view situation. 

If aliens coming earth kill us all, best shot *global effort*, working together annihilate them, don‚Äôt blame country hoards ammunition aliens gain foothold attack earth, maybe don‚Äôt trust much either.

America nationalistic viewpoint. It‚Äôs cultural thing really isn‚Äôt anything change it. One appears spray tan ... Possible toxins may introduced.  
Two worked several plastic surgeons. possible breast implants leaked...       
Symptoms include Liver Kidney disfunction, heart palpitations, brain fog/cognative disfunction, etc. Name price escrow.

It's win-win bet me. Y'all make fine hedge summer. Got second Moderna dose two weeks ago. Covid March 2020. Considering turn earlier, number would expect general population looking total vaccinated people, guess would concern manufacturing, vaccine itself. 70s still don‚Äôt qualify vaccine due shortages.

Where? provinces gotten 70-79 demographic already, Ontario starting 60-64 already Quebec announcing next days. 2x US surplus reflects belief one Covid variants require entire US vaccinate again. maybe wait eat it‚Äôs safe That's diamond hands you. Cool. later June 30, healthy comorbidities, waiting list generally available 5o public vaccination? Hundred CAD? bottle scotch something? win win bet zero complaints :) 

I appreciate optimism, also worry people latch onto optimistic takes, quick cry conspiracy met. 

The main argument hear antimaskers Montreal ""it keep two weeks forever, end freedom keep lying us"". 

I've seen people walk grocery stores, start yelling staff, walk without buying anything. Even well educated people work keep focussing ""just two weeks"" constantly disappointed.

It seems ""best case"" timeline talked year ago. 13 months field vaccine, 6 produce it; less.?  Ah risk take everyday birth control... decided want vaccine, I‚Äôm trying let drive crazy I‚Äôm odd one among family friends. vast majority already one doses due variety things put top line. feel left way LOL feels like turn never come. brother-in-law coworker pretty much boat me...work home ‚Äúnon essential‚Äù jobs health conditions hurry wait everyone else know going first. back line people feel same? I‚Äôm absolutely glad people higher priority vaccinated, given slow process PA, I‚Äôm kind like ‚ÄúI decided get shot...if it‚Äôs ever turn...‚Äù LOL. I‚Äôm vaxed double mask get get point nothing else do. Doubt happens though.  Ok doom gloom think posted like 4 times already. even slightest chance new side effects emergency approved vaccine gets pulled quickly. Unexpected side effects could also point manufacture issues small batch particular issue clustered way indicates problem. 

Additionally even hint problem undermine vaccine effort knock effects vaccine efforts, strong response abnormalities important. Again, India hero country pandemic You‚Äôre sure young people ones symptomatic? actual supporting data back statement? Birth control a) needed prevent spread deadly disease, b) going allow/prevent life get back normal pandemic, c) recommended people already risk blood clots/stroke. Adults don‚Äôt serious side effects either. side effects hear aren‚Äôt serious. They‚Äôre similar side effects adults US low infection rate like Australia, I'd agree 100%. 

The US however highest number infections world FAR also experienced deaths. order get situation control (globally) makes sense first vaccinate worst-hit country world no? said loved EU, vaccine strategy. üòä I'm frustrated everyone else is.  politicians sides good sustaining rhetoric there's one party subcontinent actively invoked it. that's Pakistani army. something everyone concerns matters know. 

Lookup history Pak Army radicalisation. history deposing civilian governments country. one saying this. sensible Pakistanis tell same. neutral observers tell well. enough people world understand enough governments world recognise perhaps conflict ended. Canada chose import Europe.

Fuck that. value lives foreigners lives countrymen? Food senoritas? That's true all. getting voted? Wall Street Journal reported end December.

Health Data

The previous record recorded yesterday, 1,972 victims. Since March 2020, total number deaths caused disease reached 270,656 nationwide, according data Ministry Health.

According federal government, 9,913,739 people recovered disease far Brazil, another 1,017,910 follow-up. people priority group get vaccinated, slower start go. Remember people group want it, even among want may know get signed up.

If progress starts stall supply, that's clue need start opening priority groups.

Just everyone group gets vaccinated mean people can't get vaccinated next group. Movement good. hurts mean can't use it. installed pavers backyard day got first moderna shot sore actually made less aware soreness vaccine. got second shot work weekend involved sitting computer think physically active right away felt pain lot more. never unable use arm hurt did. Europe good idea Europe already providing US millions doses. Ancient bloodletting technique ... Wait wouldn‚Äôt accept vaccinated us tourists? way better UK second vaccinations critique US effort pretty clear never real ""best"" way controlling it. Outside full military style lock like China believe half happened early bridge sell you. It‚Äôs troll don‚Äôt get caught It‚Äôs funny aren‚Äôt wrong üòÇ Wish Florida gave shit people.

I even certified letter saying I'm essential still issued [insert big bank name here] back know cops would trying enforce stay home stuff. Pfizer could airlift production facility UK today export vaccines tomorrow.

And many companies this? Anyone get headache nauseous within minutes 1st Moderna? chills start 2 hours? feeling goofy?

Most said side effects starting 8-12 hours later.

Just wanting clarify! Still get vaccinated, people! know someone known previous Covid infection started symptoms bit early, seems. pharma company could setup shop UK export 100% vaccines make worldwide. 

And many companies that? People, doses, wonder? One easy peasy, one slightly less easy still attainable! 

Hope becomes reality still quarantine 14 days exposure vaccines would point getting vaccines really anything. vaccines clearly work life return pre pandemic normals enough folks vaccinated. said anything wrong, clear, get 10, 15, 20 million vaccinations, get closer closer herd immunity, start make clear tiers, they're temporary. They're permanent. there's something beyond orange yellow, green tier present itself. course next weeks, socialize details that.

He said tier would *created* state gets point. every place- place- would actually go it.

I like green tier entity own, magically ""present itself"" Californians somewhere 10 20 million people vaccinated, government working months now. Security theater  ...   
For three hour erection, three hour erection  
... Hot take. Give countries agree reciprocal border openings us. European countries, Japan, Canada telling this? never claimed South America using Sputnik V. corrected person said Sputnik V used countries world. much ""money making "" thing Gates, chip. I'm younger person worked large HMO..and retired "" travel"" 2019..with usual good timing. still could get vaccine. Yeah, older boomer equation. ., formerly liberal, deep conspiracy everything venue. I'm biting tongue, looking vaccine, anywhere. wants use silly nostrums. Yeah go ahead buddy hope order. Man hate "" pragmatic"" sometimes save sanity. Old overweight people social distancing every winter, prospect fuck off.

There long-term solution involves social distancing shutdowns. deaths crawl mostly people refuse get vaccine becomes clear im confident another % least older cohorts get secret. husbands wives get behind other‚Äôs backs.  parents grandparents get still put front children getting it.  

No one wants dummy died knowing could done something. like May. done vaccinating every adult wants one April 30th. think pandemic November too? USA USA.  


Seems need reminded begging Hydroxtchloroquine. Literally May remember even though happened recently; looked Philly still investigating February 1st. 
There patient privacy issues (i.e. selling patient data) competency issues PFC. 

Dorshin, guy running took 4 home give friends. vaccinate 7k people got shut down; saying negates bad least got there. 

He really good selling company too, saying solid plan distribute vaccines. 
Which true numerous people Philly sub got bogus emails vaccine appointment. well general confusion get vaccine. 

As well this: They're still investigating shitshow company.  use time machine?

Your evidence falls short ""most people money travel."" eligible. point. 50 year old (heck, 54 year old) eligible unless one conditions identified. 

A 50 year old hypertensive, overweight, diabetic far higher risk overweight 21 year old.

These people exist. neighbor 53 eligible criteria. neighbor - 20 year old college student bit beer belly - eligible. That's happens people elected based gender race. Yeah, South Dakota, Governor charge fostering Covid deaths, guess AG felt left out. USA #1. Pay big bucks us Euro's, talked lot shit whole thing. Blaming US electing fool administration criminals basically absolutely nothing, containing outbreak global pandemic. \[no wait, actively worked it\]. 

What US affects globe. called soft power. case, even that. makes sense. Im starting get fed twitter also irish newspapers Perhaps plan replace nuclear power dynamo Pasteur's grave? Poor Brazil... 

Love country, culture, people. many times. Hoping visit one day Covid big donor re-election campaign.  Hm could true, find another source.. believe anything oe24 writes Every move makes designed appeal far right base Texas GOP, really interest promoting best interests Texans. eyes base, Austin is, mistakenly, scene super-liberal stronghold suing Austin makes base happy. good news there‚Äôs actually evidence show virus likely reached limits ability mutate :)  Everyone world wanted PPE time. took get manufactured. 

The vaccine ordered advance, surplus ordered need. aren‚Äôt sitting stock right now, agreed buy it. There's possibility receive long time. USA export ban drug substance EU supply needs shipped USA fill finish. Biden said vaccines would exported everyone america offered shot. includes children, there's approved vaccine yet, assume they'll held america several months.  see info? US allow countries buy vaccines manafactured country, case unaware. EU could thing vaccinate population faster. seem so, even trial data IIRC, though think magnified peoples perceptions vaccine. moron killing lot citizens. sure? EMA statement subject says ""The information available far indicates number thromboembolic events vaccinated people higher seen general population."" 

Where get information data suggests AZ vaccine may effectively 6 times likely give thrombosis? he's AG went Austin back December trying restrict restaurant capacity stem surge - mention efforts stop Harris County relying voting methods limited exposure virus. say won't?

Honestly, imagine hits June let alone July immense pressure allow tourism ease restrictions.

Given last summer without vaccines imagine summer different. imagine mask requirement stay place covid tests/vaccination evidence. EU get bad press threatening block exports try take vaccines countries. 

Most countries vaccinating population first. Nothing wrong that.  Thank insight! researching numbers, helps. abrupt suspension seems helping way putting risk? Something adding quite yet me. Great! Fyi, Europe already pledged 1 billion(!) doses rest world. already delivered 34 million doses non-EU countries. pandemic end cooperate. need ordered doses fulfilled though.
 US hogging production slowing supply. vaccine rollout EU disaster helping. realise countries employing vaccination programs, right? need USA lol waiting state still vaccinating older people essential workers past 2 months. thought should‚Äôve available everyone since keep hearing we‚Äôre getting lot doses. Vaccine nationalism hell drug. little difference them. Take whatever get - time picky! literally are, said US vaccinated. delivered many. last week, 2% vaccines administered Hungary Sputnik V, accounting roughly ~20k doses.

Sinovac, hand, massive - 20% total Hungarian doses weeks. They're also ones supplying Turkey Morocco, populous countries + Latin American countries top that. told getting second Pfizer shot I‚Äôm good day 7 (which ironically today).  22 blood clots 3 million vaccinated. live city 3 million people, thombosis clinic usually send patients definitely get 22 referrals every single day. due diligence investigate, expected number population size, especially majority probably older health conditions.

""Up March 9, 22 people reported blood clots vaccination AstraZeneca drug. total three million inhabitants already vaccinated vaccine."" This. KNOCKING VACCINE. already made choice. ignore facts act like clearly unrelated foolish subreddit discussing vaccines specifically? got AZ shot 12 days ago, random mild fever stomach issues two times meantime, wondering related. think questions asked appears blood clot cases higher normal waste time so? investigate every medical problem arises vaccination happens even line normal numbers.

I'm necessarily bashing Denmark so, think right population I'm struggling see beneficial stopping vaccinations 14 days. victim seems sustained multiple bloodclots typical single one

Since blood clots common effect Covid PCR test guy? could infected even got vaccine. Worse still, liquid, WT absolute F liquid?! they're extremely nationalist accept data countries? lot vaccines shipped US fill finish returning (hopefully) EU. Im Brazilian, things really bad here. government started distributing hidroxicloroquine ""profilatic"" ""early treatment"", even scientists recomendations. Health ministers got replaced tried take real measures preventing catastrophe. people trusted president took chloroquine went thinking nothing would happen.
Scientists got told called alarmists communists (?). I'm one them.
Things grim here. spelled decade wrong. least two research studies said people previously infected respond first shot second shot, respond second shot, measured antibodies levels. study side effects, would reasonable think people previously infected would stronger normal side effects first shot milder normal second shot. Great, wish could expect lot doses quickly. Considering much trouble delivering promised amount US I¬¥m afraid Europe receive scraps. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Don‚Äôt burn masks yet kiddos. JustTrustMeBro.com/pak-india-vaccine that's case, Danish government soon clear things out. really see controversy here. victim bad luck, bad luck shouldn‚Äôt put restaurant owners business. NYC lot vaccinated people want safely eat restaurant, wait staff eligible vaccine, people able dine indoors they‚Äôre willing accept risk.

It sucks got virus taking extreme precautions, whereas I‚Äôve going (masked, never hanging indoors long) NYC entire time never got sick, example extreme outlier. You‚Äôre presenting though everyone lets guard single second get virus, 70% us haven‚Äôt, even though lots people taken precautions.  Trudeau botched vaccine acquisition. Help Biden would greatly appreciated üá∫üá∏üá®üá¶ agree you, potential adverse effects investigated. 22 cases 3,000,000 vaccinations? tiny number apparently normal. Wont AztraZeneca vaccines start expiring eventually EU continues spread fear vaccine? years* I‚Äôm paraphrasing, effectively ‚Äúthe U.K. export ban vaccines vaccine components‚Äù. It‚Äôs demonstrably untrue, especially components since export EU Pfizer vaccine. ‚ÄúThis applies 600 locations 17 states, including South Carolina‚Äù that‚Äôs info saw article  TeXas bAd There's least one Variant concern coming Manaus, studies think city went least 2 massive waves infected population. is, variant reinfecting people before. take vaccine likely receive booster-shot later updated new major strains far know not. source that? getting ready go huge concert March 15th I‚Äôd bought tickets months earlier. remember thinking dammit, stupid coronavirus thing better affect concert. 

The concert never happened. also longer speak person going too, couldn‚Äôt see eye eye situation. Actually longer speak almost anyone anymore. Almost friendships relationships dried nearly nothing year this. It‚Äôs really hard staying contact people rarely/never see them. positive PCR test days receive covid vaccine? wondering I'm traveling days receive mine hope vaccine getting places like Puerto Rico, US Virgin Island, Guam, American Somoas. vaccine sucks. EU focus importing Sputnik J&amp;J instead. Luckily mine well preserved gin. It‚Äôs almost like don‚Äôt understand buy own... Great news! Hope deliver April despite indications earlier :( Commission said previously deliveries expected begin early April, officials [bracing two people knowledge process said earlier week. meeting EU ambassadors Wednesday, [diplomats J&amp;J yet provide delivery schedule shot. didnt really take coronavirus seriously March 3. Like one time, came back party, saw thousands died china social media feed. went back paying attention. didnt really think serious thing till touch late. last year felt fast, way fast. Mostly anecdotal, however, find data universities. example, Purdue reports severity shows 80% cases campus either mild (50%) asymptomatic (30%). cases caught, going find severe cases, meaning true number mild/asymptomatic cases likely higher.  


This saying older college-age can't asymptomatic. CDC's data shows death rate per age correlates strongly older age death. would fair extrapolation assume increase symptom severity correlates death rate. US president elected serve people US first. 

China afford use vaccine foreign policy tool (let's pretend country purely selfless grounds) virus controlled locally.

Russia hand giving away doses countries 400+ Russians die COVID every day (at least according official stats). Russia even way behind EU vaccination rate, despite making big deal first approve vaccine. UK government published doc:  Right, Germans chosen go slow
Please shut idea you‚Äôre saying yet Georgia still Phase 1A (basically) refuses vaccinate anyone doesn‚Äôt meet requirements, even somehow able get initial shot another state. They‚Äôve done horrible job vaccine distribution! point, states need open everyone wants one like Alaska doing. Thanks answers, people. I'm AZ couple hours getting irrationally worried this. know confirmed vaccine-related deaths, everyone around kind scared. made feel better. ordered many hedge certain vaccines working significantly delayed, anticipated export bans. forget even know vaccines would effective possible one point.

That many effective vaccines incredible accomplishment modern science. easily could've one two work, point 9 doses per person would barely enough. Well I'll take Johnson Johnson vaccine Well two solutions this: lockdown vaccinate.

The Germans chosen go slow vaccinations loads doses going unused. they're rejecting vaccines, lockdown solution. son! daughter 9 I'm waiting baited breath news younger children. Fair point. would still argue procedure vaccinating everyone US Europe shifting Brasil India. bet science intelligent distributing vaccines pandemic. wish could learn something start improve international approach pandemics right now. people elected vaccinate also vaccinated. vaccine guarantee get works prevent getting severely ill. 95% effective means one every 20 people get vaccine could still get moderate severe infection. Maybe, hopefully number protected herd immunity. You‚Äôre right saying numbers crazy low‚Äîlike less 20 cases per day‚Äîso odds catching even lower vaccinations rolled majority people, higher, even anti vaxxers. 

Re: opening international border. don‚Äôt know policy eventually happens, although could hazard guess implement vaccine passport (cannot come leave without proof vaccination clear health) (hopefully small) communities protected herd immunity. I'm planning visit Montreal border reopens! thing risk free drug. drugs, prescriptions, medicines risk free

You still need know risks know high risk take particular drug. 2 week pause nothing. remember leaving work rush last day buildng. busy handing computers staff requested day. remember thinking ""it bad"" boy wrong. thinking preps food, masks things wondering would enough.

Yesterday took first ride public transportation year felt strange. felt strange walking stairs subway. felt strange going machine purchase fare. felt strange getting train felt surreal.

Next week return work.........oh boy. another thread, said ""any idiot jam syringe someone's arm depress plunger.""

I stand corrected. Clearly Kroger hired special breed super-idiots. good point, take line thinking slightly different direction. Single blood clots sometimes happen randomly, circulation slows veins become dilated. patient suddenly many, reason. Covid possibility, leukemia, defective heart valve, etc. they're putting brakes vaccine administration, one would hope looked list possible causes. would standard care, unknown condition. think say certainty patient either something uncommon doctors catch, vaccine. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt chance grieve. It‚Äôs almost like happened yesterday us. It‚Äôs still fresh,‚Äù said Nettie Parks Volusia County, Florida, whose brother died COVID-19 last April. travel restrictions, Parks five sisters yet hold memorial.

I could imagine, lot people diagnosed PTSD, adjustment disorder depression, months come. explain inefficiencies ‚Äúunified health system‚Äù.... 

I cannot believe spell you. happens every time Austin something grain Abbott shit company try fight every time. didn‚Äôt really body aches. guess lucked that. headache felt like flu 36 hours. Maybe slight fever, never measured it. Meanwhile 10 million people vaccinated AZ vaccine problems.

Literally everyone knows someone reporting problems. Every member rabid press knows someone reporting problems.

What going EU? EU factories making bad batches? like 12 vaccines far though... No, it‚Äôs steady climb since November. It‚Äôs unlikely dump blip. vaccinate 300,000 people per day flu shot. talking about? Small government ought mean governing local level, bureaucracy centralized inefficiency minimum.

Small government ought mean using much larger governmental systems bully smaller ones satisfying ideological desires understanding (or paid pretend understanding of) public health works. true vector vaccines yeah (so J&amp;J Sputnik V). engineered viruses grown huge living cell cultures. Canada needs real bad. Plz send Actually, it‚Äôs likely ‚Äúunified health system‚Äù slow things down. mean, unaware infamously long wait non emergency procedures appointments? 

My mum waited 8 months knee surgery.

But far vaccines go, it‚Äôs unified. last week Ontario detailed plans privately owned pharmacies administer them.

**And finally, we‚Äôve never done I‚Äôm sure mean ‚Äúthey every year already.‚Äù No, don‚Äôt.**  that's second EU vaccine approved upsetting still hit 3,000,000 dose day, especially deep March. However, I'm seeing lot states dramatically expand vaccination sites, hopefully comes dramatic expansion administration. gap first 3,000,000 day first 4,000,000 day could end pretty quick compared previous leaps. thing imagine particular batch administration vaccine Denmark/Austria incorrect. quote part article says booster gives difference given outside certain window read properly? I'll waiting. Read links provided you‚Äôll find out.  Okay guess beyond elementary Swedish Google translate. 2.2M 7.7M (from previous forecast, total vaccines) -5.5M (total vaccines forecast). 900k AstraZeneca lowering shipments. 1.3M either Moderna lowering shipments, also result AstraZeneca counted use due safety check. I'd like know numbers two. I'm assuming Moderna, think shipping much Q2? I‚Äôm really excited ability rapidly roll vaccines novel variants, really mRNA vaccines general. obviously great win Moderna/BioNTech, line future preventable diseases using tech. Congrats friend. 

I Pfizer trial, knew purchase BNTX stock began enrolling 16+ yo ppl w HIV. Exciting times. I'm taking bets - first 3m plus day? 4m plus day (if get there)? Step 1: Pray bitch super lethal. proceed Step 2.

Left right, quick dismiss others inhuman now. stopped listening reason listen scummy commentators lie profit. Accurate information hard come across takes time research, millions clickbaity new organizations clog feeds enable us vicious assholes inevitably fight one another. Making bank misery.

We yell mask people engage even basic decency protect others, yet also gaslight lost every single social support system due restrictions literally ruin financial personal lives. see selfish narcistic assholes arguing without willing see views actions effect other, tiring. I've watched people cared change worst possible ways makes feel incredibly alone this. 

My personal financial life destroyed pandemic. lucky survive, start almost entirely scratch now, real guarantee life much better 3 months more. plan get next 8 weeks, real guarantees beyond that.

I watch wealthy destroyed careers profited makes despise them. hope things change better can't trust new administration actually address fundamental problems long term, even sure around long enough see happen.

It makes feel like past 10-15 year adult life complete total sham. Seeing public health experts think US looking things like ok hug grandchildren shows way touch general public. US going back normal summer without blessing. think people public health sector right unrealistic view much general public actually cares recommend. vast majority people done tired care anymore. wildly inaccurate go guess.  purposes guidance, people considered fully vaccinated COVID-19 ‚â•2 weeks received second dose 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna), ‚â•2 weeks received single-dose vaccine (Johnson Johnson approved Johnson Johnson though.

Not complicated. fun thing tracking 1/2 shot thing, easily predictable. Like sure, people miss second doses, enough statistically significant. see kinda clearly 28 days, we'll 25% fully vaccinated (well, probably bit J&amp;J, maybe 27%, bit Pfizer needs 21 days, like 29%). 

You add four weeks see basically we'll be.  actually convenient. Moderna emp. first Moderna shots officially started testing Pfizer soon follow.

Going eat almost safe right now. Soon legitimately totally safe. vaccinating 2 million people per day. Register. Get shot. Go eat. You‚Äôll fine. think somehow *you* understand nation‚Äôs top epidemiologists public health experts considered it.  question - see states lift mask mandates people get vaccinated, private businesses (Costco, Whole Foods, Walmart etc.) start lifting mask mandates? ""culturally acceptable"" wear masks public without everyone looking anti-masker idiot. I'm talking general public access vaccine - saying mask mandates lifted now, think need ton stay place now. live Los Angeles, still restricted want hope culturally masks forever ever.  agree ab gov‚Äôt rush open up. I‚Äôm Texas. Appears may Florida. 

Do know Pfizer actively pursuing booster variants? real world implication may - two shots adequately protective Pfizer regimen vs 2+ booster Moderna. logistics getting shots arms quite sizable, may know. Reducing challenge much possible imperative. think real questions rather simply ‚Äúbake off‚Äù niceties - question setting whether promote one other. Food safety exactly complex either. People still fuck every day. CDC considers someone full vaccinated two weeks last dose. Z vaccine last week felt bit rough 24hrs fine. reports spike blood clots 15 million people AZ dose. wonder 32 million non-administered doses gone. That's couple weeks supply. trucks warehouses. Hahahaha people get Chinese 'vaccine' truly inoculated disease counterproductive goal eradicating least managing spread several studies show efficacy rate pretty trash. Brazil ran study month ago 50% efficacy example.

So inoculated counterproductive, 50% efficacy rate?

I'm saying Chinese vaccine best, efficacy rate window. But, can't say counterproductive inefficient. Also, lot countries even others' mind, cannot access get line vaccines. 50% still better nothing months end, even poweful nations ordered double amount would actually need vaccinate entire population. I‚Äôll always hate march 2020 dream trip Japan cancelled. supposed first overseas vacation ever üòû.   China fl√º

Really? Liar-in-Chief lost. Get even kill catch it

Tell families 2,637,107 people died calm down

I calm.

And still wrong... read article properly (which not) would see certain window passed second dose makes difference. don‚Äôt flip. We‚Äôll 100m tomorrow‚Äôs update sure. say part virus targets, know affected exsisting resistances fig.2a). Hopefully isn't. 10% country fully vaccinated.   don‚Äôt know sure though bottom line doctors recommend get vaccinated soon can. vaccinated, better. point, millions already administered everyday; it‚Äôs like beginning vaccines much sparser going vulnerable groups Spoken someone who's never lost anyone close. That's lot new 5g hotspots. Guys think upgrade 4g phone able use new tech?


/s Doctors experts telling us they‚Äôre great take get. that‚Äôs true. access want mRNA that‚Äôs understandable. It‚Äôs undeniably better. vaccination rates show sign improving time soon. shame, pretty great vaccination infrastructure, near enough doses.  Totally! Honestly im still astounded rolled out. perfect getting breakthrough vaccination technology pushed safely year scientific medical marvel. immune responses call side effects important, well worth discomfort! Congrats vaccination well! Yep. comment also reinforces another comment read. explains lot. Thank you!!1 two firms similar deals place since 2018. reason believe force one gunpoint. current Covid related deal put place Pfizer &amp; Biontech Way back June, 2020 calculation December. hope Ursula von der Leyen sainted even though thousands dying EU every day due failure /s guess it‚Äôs specific business. Plenty coffee shops NYC still aren‚Äôt allowing people sit inside are. Yeah unless Florida Democrats come somebody really likable good name recognition coast reelection. ~265 million Americans age 16+

Looking first doses done, 64.07 million.

50% people take vaccine, 48.36% way done first doses.

60% people take vaccine, 40.3% way done first doses.

70% people take vaccine, 34.54% way done first doses.

80% people take vaccine, 30.22% way done first doses. like it. good numbers Thursday. Remember Trump closed borders Pelosi called sinophobic?

That said spread like think late travel restrictions lockdowns. need invest billions vaccine production distribution. found slot. get 4am, He's taken account pandemic people done exercising mitigation efforts. two different things. Thank this. It‚Äôs informative explain lot! üôè plant isn‚Äôt owned Pfizer. Pfizer isn‚Äôt ‚Äúheavily funded‚Äù Germany bu stretch imagination. 

The development Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine 100% funded Pfizer privately. 

See sources: like people saying months now. Anyone else feel like Fauci let spotlight get head ? I‚Äôm worried long run he‚Äôs almost gonna want let covid threat die would ultimately longer relevant Congrats getting vaccine one step closer spontaneity life. hint: numbers shit 5 weeks, worse 12 dummy  I‚Äôll done two weeks later second dose administered last adult member household vaccinated. Israel signed deal share lot medical data Pizer. like everywhere else started vulnerable hospital deaths dropped. would think everyone else get cases drop even faster. people dont want take hot spots. I've 'Work Home' 10 years. recently spent 6 months living working tent. lived small boat 2 years. lived apartments multiple roommates city. lived big, expensive, single bedroom loft. 

Home offices luxury want them, hardly requirement.

Free coffee definitely going get back office. waiting even longer second dose numbers magically improve?? planet on? Wow seriously? thought society moved past segregation. again, say people take it, said people going entitled coerce so. can't get 100% people board anything, life. People wait months (I'm currently even eligible wanted it) see goes, potential rights taken makes feel inclined push away rather take it, would seriously consider thinking precious vaccine passports.

Also, infection reached herd immunity developed vaccines, vaccines good news many, infections still get us herd immunity. saying anything whether saying possible.

And act people unvaccinated going constantly infectious. one banned anywhere. immuno-compromised person wants go restaurant accept is, usual, risk. covid people still immuno-compromised yet still participated society. see difference this, risk getting sick take choose go out. call point selfish whatever like true.

Just give people time trust, stop trying treat like know what's best every individual. Every American, regardless age, got hit $5,000 bill could give $1,400 people overwhelming majority funds bill organizations.
 
It wrong every level. BioNTech good job developing vaccine! Pfizer good job funding testing production.

Why called Pfizer vaccine anywhere outside Germany? BNT162b2 vaccine BNT BioNTech. Amazing news! someone volunteering vaccination, we've told ready 'mass mass vaccination' next week. 

Hopefully, we'll break 1 million doses day benchmark next week!

Can wait! EU used vaccines produced territory, number doses would par US. major difference lack funding production facilities -- producing many, maybe vaccines US -- fact EU still supplying rest world US blocked exports. 

The EU certainly individual countries legal mechanisms enforce ban well, far one small case Italy, haven't. normal times, making medical determinations like takes years, sometimes decades. tetanus vaccine developed 97 years ago, verge concluding need booster shot vaccinated child. policy erring side caution nearly CENTURY, wait couple weeks pre-publication studies deadly pandemic modern times everyone freaks fuck out. hope doesn‚Äôt make politically economically harder USA reform healthcare system cut costs pharma industry popular. Makes glad got mine hospital registered RN. Still full proof professional set up. US bloc states much way EU is. EU supplying Bulgaria &amp; Malta different US supplying Hawaii? believe waiting given 2nd dose. fair looked tried research since passed 90 day mark. I'm going business family get infected again. friend runs health department, brother ER doc really unsure. know enough it, know people gotten twice. IDK. UK currently facing 60% capacity cut AZ deliveries. project whole delayed, yes, EU promised 3 times issues solved, deliveries shows something else. example EU promised 80M Q1 track 16M. Q2 number cut 180M 50M. disaster vaccination programs Europe. Media outlets live die clicks ad impressions aren‚Äôt great source sober fact - one shocked! Using mRNA research technology developed University Pennsylvania Drew Weissman Katalin Kariko, rationale, US government actually funded development vaccine. help future people unwilling get vaccines able access therapies like potentially mRNA therapy new antivirals they‚Äôre working on, health insurance US ofc. UK's administered 11 million doses this, know problem now? Seems like overreaction me. Haha worries. 2.5 million Thursday still good compared Thursday numbers. weekend hit 3mil+ day! among wait longer second dose, real improvement protection. **Five weeks first dose**, antibody response detected in: 43% people solid cancers 8% people blood cancer 100% people cancer‚Äù

Hint: study say happens 12 week booster, mainly boosters starting given now... Right. us aware things. 

To clarify, Texas banned cities enacting stricter mandates state mandate ‚Äî currently nothing.

You asked question answered source give context. That‚Äôs all. mean italy stop stealing AZ doses bound countries? comparing locked-down population (a months ago) one that's apart open. Cases pretty steady, testing (positivity rate dropped 8% 3%) people back normal.

Also, deaths hospitalizations low.

it's working. both? week year since stepped foot grocery store ate house. careful curbside picking everything since. cancel anniversary trip Hawaii, I‚Äôve lucky able work home. Got vaccine morning looking forward getting back normal year. Personally think domestic travel restrictions almost completely inconsequential since began. I've literally never even one official try enforce I've taken couple big trips last year. idea hell going California? understand it‚Äôs populous state, clear signs improvement vaccinating cratered last week.

I‚Äôve read comments saying it‚Äôs reporting delays, haven‚Äôt found anything online backs up... think spotlight part it. Power control hard let go.... probably right, European companies capabilities even remotely close American company. something mindset ‚Äúlet‚Äôs it‚Äù attitude lacking much Europe. say European person ever. UK hit even larger shortfall last year, EU alone: thinking infected get vaccinated worst case scenario nothing wasted time. best case scenario booster shot. plan get J&amp;J either way back last March. say implied it. wanted voice opinion. üòÖüòò define proof measurement use decide stop erring side caution. know? lied website get appointment. It‚Äôs like pharmacy late extra. quoted proof ignoring - loser ü§£ü§£üòú I'll definitely interested see actually anything convince people Japan accept Olympics happening year. China's vaccine particular, they've promising lot vaccines sporadic say least. think athletes developed world getting developed world's vaccines they're even offered Chinese one, I'll little surprised athletes able get one time events go forward. Testing approvals funded Pfizer, vaccine development finished mid January without special fundings. mRNA research partly funded Germany also Don‚Äôt clip nails wear lot hairspray. cynical part hoping many people decline AZ vaccination soon offered me. day dream GP calls say come vaccine. US clear start factories US would producing vaccines US start.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* journey been. remember last week ""normal"" times. went friends restaurant. talking Covid-19. one people thought going go away summer. thought since 19 year old healthy, would basically immune virus. 

Then came executive stat home order Illinois. school person. strange. remember hearing news shortages toilet paper stock market crashed. part scary know would happen. beginning lockdown, bad. school still since scramble adjust online classes. got play videogames day friends, night weekends continued go work worked restaurant. 

Once school got back session. hated it, pay attention want there. worried work relaxing thought everything would back normal next semester. Last summer okay. still got see friends there. Mask wearing big deal me. get used feeling something covering mouth nose. Work amazing still getting lot take delivery orders. tips made time insane. middle summer, dinning room opened again! looking good!

Then got message school still going remote. really bummed really thought could happened. September remember cases area started increase. grandma passed away time too, Covid. like weeks later got Covid-19. mild case. really lowest point last year me. felt depressed like never before. thing kept stable work, able keep mind things went back. 

The fall winter mostly miserable. hated fact celebrate Thanksgiving Christmas family loved ones. missed much. School boring learning anything. relief news vaccines came out. knew right chance hope things return normal again. 

And beginning 2021 leaned hope vaccines effective. hoping spring coming warmer weather, cases would start fall. now, amazing incredible! 

My final reflections pandemic wish others would taken seriously beginning. could really helped prevent lot deaths. tell year ago 500,000 Americans going die virus. would thought insane. want thank healthcare workers fighting front lines pandemic, fellow essential workers continue work pandemic, thank others! Things looking great summer! continue wear mask, practice social distancing, turn get vaccine, it!!! Trust science!! cannot wait go parties celebrations happen pandemic over!!! Yea, get stolen even hit docks. Doubly triply stolen try military guard (aka they'll sell themselves).

Then gas, maintenance, etc. 24/7 running generator quite large requires daily fuel drop offs entire vaccination campaign.

Seriously, ever read capital city in, say, Mongolia? Much less Saharan capital city, non-capital city (but large country) similar areas? sure getting downvoted article says nothing efficacy directly, talking antibody production, 

Secondly, says absolutely nothing antibody response cancer patients 2nd dose 12 weeks.  many participants, likely even gotten booster yet.  would STARTING get boosters earliest.  compares antibody response 3 weeks first shot, 5 weeks FIRST shot. don‚Äôt wear masks fully vaccinated can‚Äôt get spread it. I‚Äôll fully vaccinated 6 weeks really wish state would use ""group"" ""phase"" definitions. Sure might go faster pace, confusing state different definitions. still get federal unemployment even states time limit sooner? prioritize get supply problem. they're allowing get it, get it. stupid timeline. long thousands Americans dying per week? care Biden? good citizen, look death hospitalization numbers wait come least level mid-summer lull last year. Futile telling anyone till initial 3 weeks develop antibodies passed. habit mention it. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Yeah, that‚Äôs true.

Entire regions ICU beds.

All country. % Population ‚â• 65 Years Age, Least One Dose: 61.2% yesterday 62.4% today

That's great stat. get 65+ range 80-90% range, sitting real pretty. *cough cough* /r/theydidbadmath He's director NIAID (National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases) since 1984. That's longer I've alive. he's work time one ever knowing is, I'm sure hard get back every day life. meanwhile, probably enjoying attention gets? I'm sure enjoys it, wouldn't? he's also gotten plenty death threats family envelope full white substance mailed (wasn't anthrax, still scary), acknowledged downsides attention. 

My question going retire?? man 80! Like go enjoy life dude, stop working! immune system thing! hang there! name game vaccinating people *equitably* possible. absolutely shame make healthy work-from-homers feel bad taking jab seniors, frontline workers, teachers, seriously ill, etc. struggling get them. healthy people **helping** others get shots. Emphasizing point again...

First dose vaccinations sharply. curve flat second dose vaccinations down. 3 weeks storm dip, fewer people get first dose winter storm, fewer available people provide second dose.

Sites ramping up. Retail locations jumping in. Give another week Except Curevac. 

That's German government prevented Trump administration getting control CureVac get vaccine America first.

Germany done Biontech arrange company partner European pharma company make sure EU gets fair share. reference, 6'0"" man weighing 185 lbs ""overweight"" due BMI 25.1 eligible vaccine beginning March 29. france recommend get booster, certain time recovery (don't remember extact laps time though) done challenge trials like 10 months ago vaccines  would cause lot unnecessary deaths, long-term conditions recover, strain health care system, still disturb economy many jobs high risk, workers possibly dying 100% recovered lot job openings, potentially billions dollars spent next several years survivors complications seek treatment. still don‚Äôt know long-term effects virus, existed year.

California's infection rate worse Texas Florida. none saying true. post comment removed suitable r/coronavirus.

We would like encourage post /r/SuicideWatch.

If crisis, please contact local emergency services local hotline: Hotline Directory Huh?

No. 

Antibodies proven exist long test, pretty much length pandemic, much longer we‚Äôve tested vaccine for. 

But yes, works booster, it‚Äôs probably good idea get one. I‚Äôm sure get one supply still low. It‚Äôs even crazier cus vaccines made like days within sequencing virus. last year red tape information mean Pfizer vaccine protects vaccinated person *spreading* virus unvaccinated person? data really showing Initially, Pfizer fund 100 percent development costs, BioNTech repay Pfizer 50 percent share costs commercialization vaccine. also said need quarantine vaccinated exposed someone , can‚Äôt gather non vaccinated people. Whaaa? also said handshakes ever again. Wtf? shock absolutely one earth. they're growing testing apparently. year 40% citizens vaccinated. smell corruption.  +0.5m last Thursday right? US clear start factories US would producing vaccines US start. Every company understood made vaccine contracts countries understanding doses would come factories EU. factories EU producing rate part orders countries around world vaccines factories. Money countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, Israel, New Zealand addition EU produce vaccine rate EU. 


This absurd idea blocking vaccine exports US UK needs stop. countries companies produce vaccines known possibility would moved global production elsewhere. Taking credit production vaccines EU ignoring money countries contributed embarrassing. Makes sense! mother, cancer patient, received pyzer vaccine. Several experts said OK safe, unclear extent vaccine would effective (since chemo harms immune system). pushed chemo little bit get once. Similar issue happened second dose Moderna. It‚Äôs somewhat common side effect fever - resting heart rate generally increases anywhere 10-20 bpm higher. Add top anxiety side effects general could you‚Äôre describing. 

It seems like isn‚Äôt much rhyme reason timing side effects. I‚Äôve heard first dose, others second, none both. 

Don‚Äôt count better worse. Whatever side effects come anyways. ride they‚Äôll eventually. Gah, trusted guy first comment math correctly. Still solid huge difference lying erring side caution. No, development done partnered Pfizer. vaccine candidates mid January. Partnerships Fosun (China) Pfizer started 16th/17th March. Source: This. made LESS 2020 get return filed ASAP. made more, sit till deadline. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs clear cares one side Covid spectrum.

Dude empathy small business‚Äôs young people put careers hold even worse loose businesses/ jobs disease dangerous healthy people 60 know would really help get anti-vaxers get vax, former president former first lady releasing video getting secretly vaccinated February. 

So rich folks sneaking low income folks communities get vaccinated. that's huge clue vax apathetic people, know would be. people money make decade, yet want something price. Think that. J&amp;J already offered use least one facility South Africa capacity fill finish 300 million doses, although order could conceivably come number, would substantially less 10% total potential output. 
If J&amp;J wants avoid sending vaccines EU US fill finish, wouldn‚Äôt make much sense exercise option expand supply chain. Every indication route *are* likely take point. took year reason government taking sweet time relief checks: they'd rather outwait pandemic never dole cash. absolutely is. 94 year old Grandfather Puerto Rico already got his. check CVS site every day availability always check PR giggles. PR CVS much better availability PR even Ohio see appointment slots available.

I checked VaccineFinder (link below) confirmed Guam, US Virgin Islands also supply showing up. one could verify American Samoa, could reporting Based qualifications? made appointment. let get one live ""congregate housing"" (an apartment)... actually Georgia's 1b category nationwide. guess kind cutting line, Walgreens let feel bad it. also know people lied qualifying fine, I'm advocating uncomfortable it. started getting weird signs last week February, including attending press conference military barracks odd hear ""everything's fine"" despite, know, actively military barracks hearing people discuss response virus. weekend March 6, went attending local hobby meetup seeing Onward theater Friday night losing sleep Saturday night reading Italy. told father dinner March 8 COVID ""would biggest thing happen lives since 9/11."" March 11 last day office work, tried entertain myself, Twitter aflame Tom Hanks, NBA season postponement, utter nadir came Sarah Palin unmasked Masked Singer right nationally televised broadcast President. night, incredibly thankful I'd done three grocery shopping trips four days. think left apartment month.

Since then, I'd consider lucky. area US knocked COVID enough OK summer. got swim every day, traveled beach immediate family (risky worth it). fall winter nightmare, mentally physically, one immediate circle died COVID (and largely avoided infection), I've steadily employed, social aspects life gotten rough, I'm still here. I've seen waste laid pandemic restrictions friends, too. ones lost loved ones essential workers got huge fight working-from-home locked-downers mourning social lives helped mitigate mental illness, irreparably harmed group. sister went full Q take pressure one's heard since January 6. 

But I'm hitting wall. ready take 18 months, year hitting face like slap. I've got heart condition can't get vaxxed May earliest I'm seeing friends states w/o conditions get freely vaxxed. state's lifting restrictions eight days working class 55 can't get vaccinated yet. Nothing seems make sense anymore. I'm trying weather storm. Or, stay here, 5-10% vaccinated people protected recommending everyone act like could group

I believe telling people continue drastically modify lives 5% chance catching disease zero near zero percent chance making seriously ill (after vaccinated) ridiculous insane, especially told beginning measures flatten curve first place.

The curve flat... dropping, incredible pace, consistently done 2 months now. We've done set do. time stop moving goal posts pretend vaccines anything. 

Let's get back life. 231 victim bad luck

Luck nothing it.

I victim policies allowed building supt. enter apartment children quarantined school home. WA  Science probably helped well want them. general population, eligibility issue. enough available yet. Fauci saying begin return sense normality late fall like month ago lol...  open normally fall without LMAOOOO ‚ÄúnEw nOrMaL‚Äù stop using words like ""likely"" ""may"" goddamn answer already?  Yep.

I know people tired, want everything ""go back normal"" whatever means.

And things improving, we're quite yet.

Just little patience, please... signed hidrb.com. Maybe sneak missed appointment. Lol sorry, jumped gun hit reply without checking. upside could keep mask mandates place vaccines widespread think extent mask wearing common future. Particularly sick, see becoming socially polite wear mask sick. like covering mouth cough sneeze. fine 5 hours, got hit train (eta: tired mornign, fine afternoon, worst chills ever night, fine, brutal sudden changes, like flipping switch). timeline people who've got AZ shot. maybe get need get done way right now, then, rest it?

I glad vaccine! weird strong side effects convinced *really REALLY* want actual disease. Yeah mostly agree people probably care state quarantine ""requirements"" first place think still important see measures getting officially dropped measure health/elected officials ideal experience! never truly enforced anyway It‚Äôs worse us. Canada reached 2% population getting first dose. We‚Äôre probably looking September He‚Äôs actually moving timeline normality closer rather away here. six months ago said *might* feel comfortable seeing movie theater without mask end 2021. he‚Äôs saying normal August September.

And course, since recommendations always cautious, implies us feel comfortable mostly normal things summer. Replying wrong person buddy. think state state. located? I'm AZ. We've messed lot ofnthungs lately vaccine rollout going surprisingly well. essential worker 55 phase already. think open everyone April/ may. 
I know states troubles, hope things smooth Masks help, trying triage, focus area needs resources most, exactly did.

Then said that. Instead lied said cause harm good. lost trust millions people. Bad luck Sense blood clot formed shortly vaccination without causality vaccination. Correlation =/= causation. enforced before. many states ‚Äúrequire‚Äù quarantine upon arrival none even try enforce it. talking future. Surely point everyone wants one it, surplus? Epic wholesome war criminals üòé Keep mind profit motive made vaccines first place. March 13th planning go vacation weekend remember entire company staff meeting lab uncertainty fear room. told us going affected all, knew untrue. Everyone would afraid get lab work done absolutely need to. remember everything blur heart sank told us let go lot company later on.

I feel lot frustration began. still trouble sleeping. Everyone's reactionary think know everything virus biotech industry operates. pick sensationalized headlines refuse learn anything further, stuck beliefs. I've lost lot faith people. would devote life science trying better people's lives people refuse wear mask (or educate it) ounce care neighbor? 

In time strife, I've seen selfishness ever before. 9/11 country united. division anger. are. 529,000 people dead. Families destroyed loss. Covid-19, never got say goodbye. never see again. Honestly, pandemic changed parts, better. want believe I'm working towards bettering people's lives go seen selfishness humanity? Thanks uplifting news today!  see playing well. point states see calculated risk start allowing people go lives. I've avid mandate-follower even I'm starting get antsy. I'm ready feel normal again. Tfor reminder. üëç get coming from, LITERALLY say would giving way till every US person them? said can't get US vaccines, US vaccines.  There's flaw way viewing this. UK government control data. Medical professionals involved development study vaccines gagged. would information internet medial professionals involved AZ known issue. going silly conspiracy theory level thought process. executive part UK government sometimes obscure truth scenario real benefit so. government hardly united would leaks place conspiracy existed multiple 20k+ days before, record way. cases rising, cares, old people already vaccinated. open fuck Man past presidents coming together much hate trump, tell people get vaccinated cpac address feel way :/ thought enough doses 25,000 people county almost 500,000 people good enough amount order... Germany. They'll figure sooner later. Pakistanis skeptical vaccines US used vaccination program OBL recon.

Anti-vax movement Pakistan much older that. vaccinated still double masking? Seem absurd me. urge Americans get vaccinated

Man, I'd sure like be. state live categories set 40-50% population vaccinated I'm even eligible. cases tanking there? LMAO Citizen misleading. effort intended vaccinate residents people living/working US.

Getting J&amp;J shot today, baby rather doubt US trial happened somewhere else would accepted it. US trial alone powerful enough. fair, little easier so. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. College student &amp; tutor. Last year, last normal week on-campus life. next 2 days college campus ghost town us chose come in, especially people Montgomery County heard 1st cases bit earlier Philly's 1st positive 10th. last class 12th last day work 13th. snapping screenshots &amp; newspaper front pages days last year, crazy looking back now. uncle mine gave 1st face masks 17th. ordered online day show early April. Never went without mask 17 March 2020 day far. lot confusion early &amp; lot us sure could catch virus packages/delivery, 6 ft/2 really far enough away people shopping, etc. us college know rest semester going go &amp; us worked know going laid temporarily what. Earlier week college announced closure 2 days (16 &amp; 17 March), 13th many professors wrote president college serious situation countries &amp; universities then, announced 2-week closure via e-mail 15:45 EDT. Us tutors got announcement paid entire closure time still working, average number hours across entire department. final ride public transport since pandemic began also day. IIRC, Philadelphia K12 schools closed end business Friday 13th, too. next 2 weeks strange limbo time anxiety virus also really knowing coming next day day life Zoom classes start till 31st tutoring going ad-hoc Google spreadsheet designed get us end semester starting day. strange time really anything calendar. Swarm app would say 'Stay Home!' would check-in 1 2 places still go groceries every &amp; then. Eventually announced classes &amp; tutoring online summer semesters, 26 May announced autumn 2020, 15 September regarding spring 2021 classes. Looking back surreal see fast everything changed. main thing wonder vaccines going life beyond COVID-19. Like work-from-home stick around want remain way? work-from-home transition work-from-anywhere? vaccine passports becomes thing even local/domestic life? anxiety handled non-zero number people feel scared around crowds even COVID-19 longer major threat?

Thankfully no-one know died virus people know got recovered fine &amp; eagerly awaiting turn vaccines. seems public trust already eroding vaccine, push perception instead taking little time study it, long-term perception safety may permanently damaged. 

Maybe considering long game?

I know that‚Äôs frustrating countries access lots AZ, maybe options might fill (likely temporary) gap. Like JJ. surprised Merck said help. Certainly need urgently people prior infection, would help cement immune response long-term. vaccines two rounds. cost Europe's vaccination program even vaccine hesitancy towards AZ vaccine leaders constantly denigrated find none citizens want take. They‚Äôll stop saying ‚Äúlikely‚Äù species mastery biology determine exact outcomes things. biology one complicated sciences, don‚Äôt hold breath that.

Until then, we‚Äôre stuck statistics best certain percent confidence. **One go** impression UK stopping exports... first x doses manufactured UK contracted UK delivery.

Ultimately means doses currently leaving UK, implications vastly different ""ban."" city sub /r/Chicago? Cuz I've def noticed there. Got j j last night, feeling like shit eligible people refusing vaccinated... PLM? high blood pressure 15 pounds overweight. fit criteria cant fill appointments here. begging anyone come get it. even given choice three vaccines. Shoirt supply problem area. arent enough people lining take it. Im skipping anyone, literally going throwing vaccine away soon. sure ad actually running yet. think good idea, wait vaccine actually available everyone begin campaign rollout. gets people eligible trouble signing vaccine annoyed. What's going Canada? seem awful lately this. lol uhhh where's pb&amp;j option? time CDC site usually update?  Think wants seen anti-establishment Andrew Jackson-style President doubt would join guys railed last 4 years. It‚Äôs getting better. Illinois opened groups days ago. 

The best part shipped tons vaccines red neck areas they‚Äôre using getting them.  drive hour get one somewhat easily. They‚Äôre even checking confirmation health issues, completely honor system. 

I‚Äôm typing Walgreens 3 hours southwest chicago I‚Äôm get first dose. malaysians at!!! point like one crazy people street movies sign says ‚ÄúThe end near!‚Äù life now? got vaccinated calling local Walgreens getting ‚Äúwaste list‚Äù. Called Monday got vaccinated Wednesday. pharmacist actually afraid they‚Äôre almost waste list. doesn‚Äôt want waste any. I‚Äôm sure list got husband vaccinated. data suggest covid child mortality much higher flu child mortality. one dead child due flu winter season. two hundred covid child deaths.

Do data.

CDC suggests around 600 children (under 18) died 2017-18 flu season US. Covid seems killed around half (I'm struggling exact numbers) course, like flu, great majority pre-existing conditions.

Of course flu mortality 2020-1 low. suppression measures place, flu basically extinct season (although come back eventually, animal reservoir, country suppressed). 

That nothing relative risk disease actually catch though. Da Cheat vaccinated possibility government enforce it

Enforcement would backfire tremendously. Yes course sorry I'll add comment, excellent point 30-100 percent higher death rate. Sounds discriminatory. (maybe lot) people advised CDC get vaccine due serious health issue may have. You‚Äôre saying government withhold people‚Äôs money? Yes. expendable employee way get Texans wear face masks government tell to. obvious... First second doses ordered separately come inventory. delay built ordering system already.

Honestly though US could go ahead let go AZ. enough vaccines get job done. It‚Äôs hard blame considering USA‚Äôs history free vaccine experiments Ima agreeing you. Nothing else needs done changed Especially hypocritical parents want stay home go visit relatives maskless expert‚Äôs orders.

Are folks relatives even fully vaccinated low-risk? not, they're hypocritical possibly putting health risk. course, people saying folks right read this. Plus. they're anti-science anti-masker. stuff they‚Äôve giving politicians they‚Äôre friends months. Trump, Rudy, Bolsenaro, Chris Christy. wind-bags weathered disease. stimulus checks nothing vaccines everything economic burden pandemic, especially regarding small businesses closed down. wrong concerned?

Incredibly   think makes sense. EMA already checked batch concluded perfectly fine. Also stated reason vaccine cause blood cloths cause probably something else.

I think makes sense break public trust validated, safe effective vaccine. make good points. hope people receptive new info. Unfortunately, several family members adamant get vaccine ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt stop spread anyway‚Äù. Hopefully data there, public health officials really drive point home. masks distancing eliminated. Early summer people forego ‚Äúrecommendation guidance‚Äù cdc. I‚Äôm sure officially many states drop many mandates than. can‚Äôt see Illinois dropping mask mandates anytime soon (my state). agree many peoples mind July 4. 

How long federal rules dropped? year. don‚Äôt see dropping airline mask thing masks federal buildings probably next spring. gonna play ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù game. there‚Äôs 5th, 6th, 7th surge fall winter? (There doom scenario, mine). see dreaded fall surge doesn‚Äôt happen, finally drop federal regulations. 

In case it‚Äôs clear, public (me included) enough 4th July. longer think pushback becomes intense.  Doubtful! alternated arms mine didn‚Äôt notice difference, second shot hit worse think that‚Äôs true matter arm. vaccine goes whole body arm it‚Äôs shot into.  supply chains already exist. think get insulin viagra every pharmacy aren't. Ontario small trial 60-64 pharmacies, phase 2 - 80 years old+. lines opening now. trend slowing. quite literally sticked thread subreddit explain long term effects highly unlikely vaccines developed fast. deliberately choosing ignore real science instead, person said, parroting concerns sources scientific basis.

And absolutely insane statement young healthy people take vaccine: ever considered people able take vaccines due health reasons? avoid people every instance, people banned society? ever considered long significant spread among large group, variants keep emerging? could go hard wrap brain around stupid comments since already ignore science probably ignore comment too. go somewhere husband? aren‚Äôt seeing anyone, everything delivered going walks poorly fitting mask fine. think got infected? Trying figure chain - Family Dollar / Dollar General? can‚Äôt predict future. That‚Äôs exactly trust doctors listen informed get vaccinated. can‚Äôt live mistrust every institution. olds basically done hospitals quiet. everyone get shots fast possible shit who's undeserving divisive Glad updated spent 6 hours fucking line got turned away/ fuck talking about? cite figure 60 million? early April line article Harnett Health's clinic Dunn, NC get it? googled day found articles saying would video nothing else. Would taking 2nd dose opposite arm effect side-effects? Sadly it‚Äôs probably going take someone like LeBron change messaging, he‚Äôs hesitant endorse vacccines far. missing missed not. Seatbelts conditional, use car. Mandatory vaccines forcing irreversible procedure onto someone consent. kids died this, few, yet think basis force vaccinations kids? whole concept also based privelage. Richer people option send kids private school give good quality homeschooling, whereas poorer people can't forced whether like not, thus worsening class divides.  many people act like act like wearing masks best feeling world, filthy anti-masker.

Wearing mask require actually enjoy wearing mask, required. God, can't wait vote guy next year. Carter funded right-wing death squads El Salvador supported Indonesian genocide East Timor. Clintons dropped cluster bombs marketplaces bombed hospitals Serbia Kosovo. sanctions Iraq killed half million children. one batch. suspended AstraZeneca vaccine. Fairly certain he‚Äôs least-liked Republican last century. 

Source: Conservative They're ones. It- like kinds people wanting vaccines, like kinds political, social, cultural issues- perfect storm understandable hesitancy, stupidity, bad actors encouraging it.

It happens social media, basically every topic think of. That's expected. Healthier younger people stronger immune systems, reaction stronger, causes symptoms. That's also people report worse reaction second dose. Since already partial immunity, immune response intense. First Canada Mexico. particular order

As per Africa imagine cold storage non J&amp;J shots tricky sure prioritize region. US really best lose much geopolitical influence inflict much damage international image can, lol.

Anyway, EU long learned expect anything AZ. Luckily enough there's companies rescue, missed deliveries AZ relatively marginal impact overall supply. point honestly hope EU finally fucking decides ban exports already. everywhere this, fwiw. I'm Chicago area wait-lists I've told multiple pharmacies they're overbooked is. Plus thousands thousands people trying get leftover doses end day point pharmacy phone lines commonly clogged certain times.  event ask? (I try help people NC.) Exactly year ago hope ""this blow like SARS, swine flu Ebola did, media completely blowing proportion. It'll alright"" came crashing spectacular fashion. became clear everything absolutely okay.

Pandemics magically disappear, much Orange Orangutan Chief tried insist would. knew long- haul, want accept it, frankly, think sooo many people understand denial reality situation.

Anyway, laid job April 1st spent nearly 5 months unemployed. job I've 6 months now, really enjoy it, truthfully probably blessing disguise. cancel trip west coast visit sister-in-law, incredibly bummed about, hey, west coast still wife vaccinated (she teacher received first dose, I'm still waiting qualify). I'm ecstatic close ""normal again."" weather warming vaccination numbers exploding country, feel sense hope optimism felt feels like many years. sharp contrast gloom, hopelessness uncertainty felt year ago.

The last 12 months undoubtedly worst life. pray NEVER try romanticize era life way, frankly sucked complete ass. Fuck COVID-19 fuck 2020. Here's renewed hope 2021 beyond. wish great happiness health. Thank coming Ted Talk lol. certainly won‚Äôt university spring 2022 semester least, according university. They‚Äôre still mandatory masks social distancing entire fall 2021 semester (despite positive things looking terms pandemic vaccinations). really hope policies change point 2022 (safely, course). J+J trial included blend US non-US data.  I‚Äôm essential worker dont fit criteria correct kind essential worker. still go work deal tenants, I‚Äôll spot line someone working home. EU export vaccines, AZ did. contract EU allows that. vaccine, fine :) I'd worried diseases roaming around place get vaccinated, open roof, wear maximum protection. think one thing that's really helped Florida fact things outdoors pretty much entire year, least state. know explain surges places that's also true, family Florida state probably every month year, remarkable much life takes place outside year round. say accounts we're seeing, think big help. Long term effects recovery acute infection limited COVID. Long term effects mRNA vaccines general unknown point, look promising future.

It's perfectly rational IMO low risk individual want get vaccine. Could please provide source ? 
For time being, good reviews AZ coming UK, makes wonder ¬´¬†extremely nationalistic¬†¬ª. Already did, science experiment - luckily got active I‚Äôm protected protecting around üôåüèª mean point quite unlikely. Society builds trust. example: trust guy driving car run me. trust guy open carrying gun shoot me. 

Society builds trust, can‚Äôt trust doctors future make right decision? It‚Äôs simple. can‚Äôt suspect mad man ready end world know it. rapidly grew testing capacity. Sure they‚Äôre still seeing cases positivity rate went 8% 3% testing tripled surprise, trumpf antivaxxer even president pandemic. Glad flushed turd. Brexit mess, EU UK. one prepared, rules unclear amount paperwork required make simple shipments EU country UK (or way around) world. doubt hybrid monster deal anyone wanted voted for. I‚Äôm sure works whether feel wiped out.

Well wife got doses impact her. get daily run, full day seeing patients basically felt completely normal. she‚Äôs pregnant top that! agreed bran, tell there's 1 statistic matters, death. vacciones really high protection death. kinda, dunno, wholesome ^(can't believe used word) does. Especially healthcare system pay vaccine citizens paying vaccine. Okay let get straight. 94% effective preventing becoming infected Covid? virus take hold body. 94% sterilizing immunity? missing Well, ban exports probably factors this. Even countries paying vaccines need vaccines US plants raw materials, wouldn‚Äôt receive it. public health system place anything remotely Well see, time J. Carter **isn‚Äôt** building house he‚Äôs camera.

The man dynamo. affected individual agree you. doesn't, don't. people walking around feeling partially vaccinated, waiting see loved ones, vaccinated? Great! Edit- see people contacted. can‚Äôt delete comment , sorry. never said anything grand conspiracy. work ?. aged twice usual rate (1year/1year) president. Nice try. 

You edited post. 

You said ""by June"" chose one day before, exactly every offer. Kinda tired seeing many articles telling get vaccinated let get vaccinated yet. sure help follow playbook written specifically scenario though, instead discarding (and people responsible enforcing it) sticking head sand. mean, knows. Serology test reliable indicator vaccination, part lot serology tests apparently looking antibodies bind sites SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccines targeting. Maybe got saline injection, maybe test got targeting right antibodies, maybe something else entirely. scared in-laws would too, especially mother-in-law kept talking much wanted JnJ given one shot. 

Thankfully, happen first shot arms awaiting second. hope parents able get vaccinated soon, hope they've seen light time wait specific vaccine. tests done kids wearing masks. imagine going back normal life masks. Covid transmits like mofo.

Oh hypocrisy... least canceling second dose massive problem, since protection 2 weeks first dose. I‚Äôve already quarantine times, lot co workers got sick. guess gotta keep wearing two masks. Ooh I‚Äôm sorry hear that. hope second dose 2 dose vaccines still tolerable people Covid everyone diagnosed especially people way back March 2020.

I‚Äôm much better frame mind happy nearing end whole thing Totally sincere, although maybe I'm acting like asshole. Sorry that.

I follow news COVID almost religiously, since livelihood depends true ""return normal"".

I follow Ding-Feigl, watch almost every Fauci press conference, etc.

I'm admitedly skeptical lockdowns, also follow people experts also skeptical, like [Jay John Ioannidis.

I read every chart cases, hospitalizations, deaths, etc. listen Bubble.

I'm still convinced, still open it. eligible initial public offering age group? Alberta starting 65+ already (50+ AZ) Wow. EU exported 9 million vaccines U.K. good excuse unfortunately nobody accepts line reasoning. nothing wrong making covid vaccines mandatory covid vaccines dangerous, let happen now, one day come time much dangerous vaccine could forced public. could mad man uses precedent. Policy decisions consider ramifications decades later. One day programable vaccines remotely controlled, probably imagine issues going come that. Point can't expect US wonderful sunshine trajectory forever, takes bad people power. going guess turned away. sense I'm getting across country one's checking hard, managed get appointment show said appointment, getting shot arm. 

There's nothing gain turning away point, they've already allowed doses they've pulled day. Changes mind every week. Fauci 0 credibility left. must asked magic 8 ball time. pictures circulating months ago former presidents getting shots. suprised jumped queue due former president status, honestly, think justify taking dose someone qualified. people see politicians love getting shot, likely want one themselves. ratchets political pressure increase rate production social pressure get vaccine quickly possible offered. ultimately save lives. CDC still advises wearing mask practicing social distancing

Well yes, right like 10% US population fully vaccinated maybe another 20-30% kind residual immunity infected. way low walk stuff back right now. another 3-4 months we're going like 60-70% population vaccinated/immune going different story completely. Please keep discussion topic. Thank you.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* yes, parents it, got Moderna shot recently really bad side effects first shot.. Nowhere discussing politics 

I stated surprised UK vaccine higher issues rates UK reported track record 

Was asked prove especially context would hurt population 

Replied historically factual list UK government coverups times covered things literally killed people 

The one playing politics bud ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Never specified year right? He's playing 5D scrabble real presidents present accounted shot. Thanks guys. think so. mean, Trump's plan leaves Secretary Health Human Services Secretary State determine enough agency heads facilitate international access. Biden made executive orders concerning it.

I think clarification. January, rumors Biden leaning towards sharing vaccines earlier, Americans chance get shot. later say also putting America first vaccine priority. really sharing new information point though. seems like PR. *Sorry clear, meant September 2022.* live padded room never leave? Every time sit car life risk... pending vacation since last year, require vaccination passport mentioned article, guess anytime soon. says 39th? father got vaccine got sick. colleagues got sick there‚Äôs general consensus vaccines better. Worst part health care workers kind forced take it, refuse might end back queue type vaccine. think choice say want one vaccines.... THIS. Different states interpreted rules differently. 

In MN, live, people like would 1B. Ahead me, 1C, behind 1A, people come direct contact patients kind. 

Our son, works hospital admissions, example, 1A. would recommend keeping hydrated vaccine stocking comfort foods hand. wasn‚Äôt able eat much yesterday fever nausea today I‚Äôm really hungry happy yummy food available. I‚Äôve definitely turned corner expect 100% Friday. bad side effects be, nothing compared actual Covid, it‚Äôs definitely worth it. care throughput. many doses per day delivered state vs. many administered? matter much long particular dose spends system long they're backing up.

It appears supply still bottleneck California capacity deliver even doses given. Mate stop lmao point think point was. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Sure normal circumstances true however easily transmissible virus stretch say talking someone might hospital. 103 fever (after taking ton ibuprofen), worst chills life, lost ability urinate, pounding headache...only lasted like 12-16 hours, peak worse felt actually Covid.  Ah. Perhaps.

Or possibly Kroger Corporate, even local-in-store pharmacy manager covering employee (or own) theft. fact released signal internal projections showing vaccine availability longer bottleneck near future.

These ads filmed months ago inauguration held back today. No, maybe we're wrong page. I'm totally fine voluntary mask requirements private businesses, I'm fine people freely choosing mask up.

As choice- many people income, much income, year. health suffering, sadly US need money job get taken care of.

I'm 100% favor single-payer healthcare, today, today people suffering. I'm sure point would though.  Countries likely make strong argument April US least partially waive no-export clauses gap doses delivered doses administered continue grow (in becomes clear supply sufficient bottleneck administering shots).

Like, award shots sitting unused freezer?  would also make sense also delay Moderna Pfizer deliveries booster shots available. No, choosing go without vaccine someone deciding feel cost outweighs benefit. Whether agree that, decision entitled influence that. people hesitant need give time trust. force going breed suspicion. teachers lobbied hard get vaccinated order open schools. add parents might well everyone once. Awesome. sister gets second shot next week. Maybe I'm missing point exactly arguing. 

All I'm saying (and tried say start thread) US pre-ordered shit-ton, ordered early, contractually specified aggressive delivery schedule. I'd say contracting 100m doses earlier delivery date countries constitutes getting ""first"" doses. 

I'm really sure ""arguing"" frankly. disagree last part. Fauci always cautious. 

I Italy early March last year. watching Pence/Fauci press conferences hopes guidance. remember reporter asking cruises safe. Fauci said older people reconsider wouldn‚Äôt personally get cruise, still okay. Even time, remember thinking insane. Sure enough, everything shut two weeks later.

Fauci bureaucrat. says bosses want to, air professionalism authority. want cautious optimism, he‚Äôll give cautious optimism. don‚Äôt want risk shutting industry down, he‚Äôll downplay threat. wife got second week ago. told going store on. 

Don't look like taunting you. Look like you. 

Now convince go lumber yard garden center I'd made. side effects? American, UK mate constantly posting Facebook poor UK done blames complanes Boris Johnson. true blowing it? Vaccines quickly created manufactured new variants go trials approval process, pfizer vaccine created 16 days virus sequenced, year ago Agree completely. 

Personally, I‚Äôm fine wearing mask indoors throughout summer - utility cost low - zero fucking chance willing continue social distance / go restaurants / go movie theaters / travel Memorial Day. Holy crap repeat louder people back? Yeah we‚Äôre gonna way excess could ever receive COVAX. Yea, value health social interaction  Yeah caused pulmonary embolism everyone got air injected themselves? We‚Äôre currently behind US that‚Äôs neglecting consider fact always part plan finish roll sooner overall. Yes changing opinion based facts fact wrong bad. people afraid AZ QC issues. Supply boost? EU? exported vaccines EU went UK. since export controls place believe real number larger. mostly Pfizer think Pfizer vaccines taken AZ can't deliver. 100% behind blocking AZ doses though. Extremely sexist guess I'm worried getting expired vaccine. know getting downvoted, 2 weeks bit large observational, real-world study Israel estimates Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 46% effective preventing infection 14 20 days first dose...""

20 days closer 3 weeks 2, unless somehow know vaccine works faster trust minimum 14 day period applies you. Continuing:

""and 92% 7 days second dose, backing results earlier randomized, controlled trial, according a¬†study¬†today the¬†New England Journal Medicine¬†(NEJM).""

So 1 week second shot... Totally agree. I'm teacher, we're head back school gotten vaccinations. However student's families, people working public every single day, yet gotten it. they're double risk jobs kids. comes sharing: EU exported 30m vaccines, 1m went US. US even shared 1 dose? sure would count carving pumpkins things semblance normalcy. happens then...great that‚Äôs aim calendar  comics adapted films. 

imo, official numbers important know lot cases excluded (just looking insanely large amount pulmonary deaths)

EDIT

That said, yes, needs looked super low % vaccine creating blood clots (and death) vs actual deaths serious long term effects covid. % far apart lower, vaccine still positive.  Glad EU bought neither. I'll catch new variant then. still cant wrap head around Jimmy Carter still alive good shape.

He must injected whatever Queen did. Probably pretty unlikely. takes close encounter poorly ventilated area upwards 10 minutes become infected. push anything back unless develop symptoms. Yes Biden administration ordered doses... Kudos him. 

Presumably saying he'll share doses us persons vaccinated know...his president. else would empowered make statement? men? Poland, mazowieckie region. junior HS go spring break happened. last day lockdown, finally hung friend group outside school first time.

DOn't know numbers right needs looked at. death SERIOUS effects (long term too) Covid higher percentage blood clots? That‚Äôs true. part it‚Äôs 55 plus getting shot. least experience Throughout pandemic I‚Äôve lied we‚Äôre 3 months away end keep optimism. we‚Äôre getting around point 3 months America drastically safer covid perspective I‚Äôm trouble actually believing it.

Lol

It flimsy weak argument nothing back up. Downvote want that‚Äôs pathetic lame cop out.... Sadly, kind country lockdowns would cause damage covid. think everyone reacts differently. first shot (Moderna), fever, chills, headache, aches. second shot, 48hour sore arm really tired. coworkers, got time, varying reports, second worse, etc. Good luck you! point can't help wonder whether US actual concerns supply, move tie J&amp;J's production capacity long possible countries need come begging US government help rather buying manufacturer. planned cruise March 2 went. time, two cases Seattle. really surreal phones connected Mar 6 learned happening.

I'm glad got enjoy Disney ignorant bliss world blew up. also gave 3 year old something happy talk things getting dark. Meanwhile EU exports 35 million doses.

Take care ""You said safe go walk around block! tell would get hit crashing airliner!"" year ago today saw show Broadway trip NYC spring break. left next morning day, announced theaters closing four weeks. remember thinking seemed like eternity time, looking forward trip planned June. year later, there‚Äôs still reopening date, since NYC theater can‚Äôt make profit anything less full capacity close it.

But also work small company 30 people given time. going switch flips CDC ever tell us ""ok everything good go back now!"" It'll depend individual company/be gradual return. Prithee good sir, fetch leeches bleeding bowl! It‚Äôs opinion. I‚Äôve worked healthcare 15+ years. 

And moved goalpost. dealing certain patients aerosolizing procedures, yes wore masks otherwise, no. masks hospital. Especially prehospital.

So no, ‚Äúuninformed opinion.‚Äù even close.  Wake up. question 22 3 million better % whatever Covid would kill/permanently harm 3 million new information though. would even ""critical issue"" hospitals masks supposedly thought effect time? saying he'll share them. administration def ordered giving leftover vaccines poorer countries able secure many vaccines.

I'm European. vaccines, please? :( county 300k receivers 10-15k weekly doses. It‚Äôll take 20-30 weeks everyone get 1 dose, 40-60 everyone get two.  I‚Äôm saying American fucking sucks useless selfish covid begin with, half million people died republicans rednecks would wear mask isolate.  Getting mine tomorrow! Never thought I'd ever feel hype getting shot lol Obtain 0.9% USP.

I guarantee numbers mixed up. states seem lowering age groups time goes on. Indiana already 50+ that's thinking. majority people 50-62 still working they're much likely die hospitalized 18-29 year olds. honestly know, assumed most, states lowered 75+ age focusing 75+ age group, 186x likely die 78x likely hospitalized 18-29 year appreciate clarifications additional info context! obviously closely following Israel's situation am. hope realized making broad estimates answer original question (why Israel herd immune yet). I'm surprised delighted Israel helped focusing vaccination efforts prior confirmed infection. 

I say unless Israel tons tons surveillance testing, there's really great way know extent caught great majority actual Covid cases. many completely asymptomatic cases! I'll reiterate attempting define ""best case"" immunity scenario Israel (in still crossed lowest herd-immune thresholds) trying specific extent 2 weeks post first shot actually protected. ""Some protection"" enough broad brush estimates. likeliest explanation blood clots nothing vaccinations. Blood clots rare individuals, population level happen, we‚Äôre vaccinating population level. Plenty people getting diagnosed cancer sorts stuff, that‚Äôs related vaccines. reason it‚Äôs made big deal abundance caution emergency authorized treatment- weeks less word probably come connection found. 

The difference UK interesting, probably reflects exercising abundance caution interest keeping vaccination program going. think arguably better risk/benefit analysis.

Disclaimer- I‚Äôm expert, someone please correct I‚Äôm taking account best information. variants yes, research done really understand contagious are. delay scientific validation spread variants, hence update well variants discovered. remembered back early February first case Coronavirus. following days , people wearing masks sold pretty much everywhere. mark-up prices crazy feared virus

Then around like 2nd week February first week March , everybody kind forgot went normal lives. remembered going Penetentiary research , crowded hallway malls , eating different restaurants friends , masks distancing. Normal lives miss

But damn hasn‚Äôt ride. feel awful this, think COVID changed life better. Went back school lost weight. hate people lives destroyed this, come better person. Semantics. buy majority doses current pipeline, certainly buy shit-ton additional doses, great admiration. I'd rather many pull EU buy few.

Not sure sensitive this.

And low-risk. Don‚Äôt forget little detail. 

The vaccine doesn‚Äôt kill covid. makes symptoms smaller reduces likelihood hospitalization one vaccinated. 

But still infect others. Fast forward comment, Texas, May. Pretty sure talking EU, US, nice deflection multiple counts. Anyway, thought done here. US share vaccine production. reflects badly them.

Trump banned export. Biden said week they'd export Americans vaccinated. boosted testing capacity significantly last weeks. raw case counts stagnating, test positivity 60%. Pfizer. Everytime someone gets infected virus may mutate

Thanks, Reddit! Hope yall get jab soon, too.  Nice ableism. might sh\*thead, country economically position lockdown. find another way protect groups risk.  poorer countries able secure many vaccines.

Spare vaccines EU? :/ still doesn‚Äôt prove exposure - that‚Äôs hoping people get exposed. would also number people you‚Äôre comparing data vaccinated - entirely unethical point process.

Yeah, parents ridiculous. keep wearing mask public, start seeing vaccinated people get vaccinated. weeks enough doses administered. Also, need literally 100% vaccination rate get back normal.

Could speak level freedom US UK parts world regarding vaccines? Arguments preferably backed numbers exported vaccine doses. Yes EU perfect, yes make mistakes, far EU (from Western World) contributing towards vaccination programs around globe. 
And yes, I'm aware exaggerate bit, much though. Ciao. say 8% second dose. Please learn read calling people anti-science apologists.

The study hasn‚Äôt even tested whether giving second dose later time anything, they‚Äôve said giving second dose bad cancer patients. would‚Äôve thought? extrapolated since they‚Äôre vulnerable 3 weeks first dose, cancer patients susceptible catching covid 12 week second dose delay they‚Äôd decreased immunity state longer 3 weeks.

This. strangely enough also one talking pregnancy, carries 4 times higher risk blood clots taking pill ... uncle needs speak oncologist. chemotherapy drug regime may preclude vaccines, cancer specialists would know details interact therapy. 1) Survivability criterion

2) laws place make sure amusement parks safe possible. let open without restrictions say ""sucks you"" someone gets injured.

3) Forcing people restrict essential day-to-day activities people enjoy ballgame makes sense. currently August October

It says August 26. even accurate 1) vaccine approved 16+ people target needs % adults % population 2) assumes current rate remains same, reality number doses manufactured day constantly increasing still. We'll hit target sometime June. true, I'm gonna taking anything granted anymore problem it‚Äôs clear know didn‚Äôt. Please keep discussion topic. Thank you.

Caring health illusion. hey, hospitals got wanted, public hospitals. related subject matrer article? correct.

How prove level exposure variants real world vaccinated people? literally can‚Äôt - make assumptions - stop moving goalpost acting like real world ‚Äúdata‚Äù factor whether vaccines safe effective. somehow acquire vaccine, let inject relevant response?

Thanks brother! hope many people get vaccines soon possible. Especially high risk categories (including immunocompromised). Also seems lull states move one age group another ramps back up. says mental health disorders weaken person‚Äôs immune system person constantly mental stress.

Weird....all Union Flag waving friends seemed denial whever pointed last two months. changed? looked up. looks like every state except New Hampshire, New Mexico, West Virginia. Walgreens website links states send vaccine sign system states.

CVS fewer stated available. really EU vaccine procurement bad? 55 mln doses delivered far vaccination programme steadily accelerating, even problems fraudulent suppliers like AstraZenca. Bare mind EU deliver quite million doses rest world already, whereas UK deliver next nothing. Anyway lessons learnt EU comes interaction 3rd party country. This..I live central FL, people wear masks grocery stores, gas stations, etc... we‚Äôve never mask mandate people still respect private property rules. restaurants it‚Äôs kind assumed you‚Äôre taking risk everyone else.  someone explain simply mentioning hospitalizations aren‚Äôt dropping like incurs storm downvotes? allowed state facts?  Holy shit. Homestarrunner. Good lord.

I think straighten quickly.  go back forth this, dont really see mandatory vaccines enforced. Like police going come house doctor watch get vaccinated else hold contempt?

Get shot non dominant arm next time. Seeing everyone went nuts start convinced event zombie apocalypse general public (us included) gonna dead within week.

well, yeah. much apocalypse people fine. someone's got initial wave zombies bring end civilization. thought much. AstraZeneca selected would influence UK government. considering GSK British company, wonder GSK chosen since vaccine experience AstraZeneca. Perhaps GSK less pliable? 

Most commentators seem assume Oxford first partnered American Merck, think really German Merck KGaA.

According press release Merck KGaA dated April Merck, leading science technology company, Jenner Institute today announced Jenner Institute laid foundation large-scale production Covid-19 vaccine candidate, **ChAdOx1 nCoV-19**.

[Merck Supports Jenner Institute Reach First Milestone Covid-19 Vaccine two weeks later, AstraZeneca announced AstraZeneca University Oxford today announced agreement global development distribution University‚Äôs potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed preventing COVID-19 infection collaboration aims bring patients potential vaccine known **ChAdOx1 nCoV-19**, developed Jenner Institute Oxford Vaccine Group, University Oxford. agreement, AstraZeneca would responsible development worldwide manufacturing distribution vaccine.

[AstraZeneca Oxford University announce landmark agreement COVID-19 would interesting know strings pulled 14th 30th April, 2020. great way signal virtue great way disincentivize vaccination based something that‚Äôs even true üôÉ need drop anywhere? Wearing mask good preventing spread respiratory disease harm, keep it? know I'm still going wearing mask over. definitely sounds like circular logic well. Australia contracts AZ, specific plants EU criticize UK AZ plants exporting you? One would think commonwealth country UK shares responsibility brethrens? Canada.

Fact EU western country exports vaccine all, 30 million February alone. mean, kids figured that‚Äôs good it‚Äôs possible get. point is, doubt even use AstraZeneca vaccines. already getting supply administer day.  Supply bottleneck anwhere close late April. need extra doses', need stop restricting trade exports private companies, using private facilities fullfill private contracts countries.  Hiphiphorah, free market capitlism, right? love /r/coronavirus mod responding ramen post haha really hate argument even though impossible vaccinated person spread, risk still dramatically reduced. vaccine prevents infection, pevents transmission Well guess improving. believe lifting vaccinated people. reality, zero restrictions domestic travel fatigued like three days Okay hut none thosr things listed cause nationwide pandemic shut down. Covid does. Eyy 100% filthy pessimist like Zutmop gets proven right again. EU needs act countries things spiral control, well could. That‚Äôs know it‚Äôs working! took Advil went sleep. gone 36hrs They‚Äôre saying partially vaccinated people going cause spike. ABSOLUTELY wrong. Lol, bet people really likes you. ""Everyone else stupid ape, tell lies order control can't think themselves."" 

And wonder people trust media/government, cause view average person like do. monkey. don‚Äôt anything actually confirming though? understand frustration still aren‚Äôt sure out-vaccinate variants AZ‚Äôs stumbles personally wouldn‚Äôt putting money US actually receiving full amount contract time. 

It‚Äôs still early start promising extra doses specific time frame countries. seems like US taking wait see approach still track, vaccines working getting numbers need another month they‚Äôll probably comfortable sending extra doses elsewhere. 

Sorry someone lost people covid mess previous administration made understand we‚Äôre trying save asses first. Vaccines basically real tool use covid right since let get bad need every dose get moment. mean it‚Äôs important way verifying age. Which, probably should, don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs person‚Äôs fault You‚Äôre 100% safe ever. that‚Äôs bar, they‚Äôll never live normal lives rot away houses. 

TB, flesh eating bacteria, heart disease, micrometeorites impacting skull outer space, car accidents, random murders, list goes risks, large small. 

When participate society, accept inherent risks so, big small. accept risks without thought reward(happy fulfilling lives, freedom mobility social connections,) enticing us risk death. think timeline accelerate substantially supply increases, 70% mark end less relevant people realize return normal.

Though getting number greatly reduces chance new disaster, even seeing date hypothetical number good news. vaccine highly effective. don‚Äôt see can‚Äôt return normal completing vaccine. threat never 0% without vaccine. There‚Äôs always risk sunburn , without sunblock. Sunblock doesn‚Äôt stop 100% harmful rays don‚Äôt tell people stay sun. fact need sun, vitamin deficiency (ironically tied higher Covid death rate ) big saw redditors lambasted Japan requiring studies approving foreign vaccines. saying US approve AZ studies US concluded. Oh true yeah. think that's bit extreme hope isnt true. good seasonality üòÇ use antibodies folks vaccine? 

What's pro/con? I'm arguing 2 week thing know that's true. issue saying there's gonna another spike. Like celebrate W? can't let people happy real progress? Dude June us 40 would access vaccine... Texas terribly vaccinations though still understand US choose vaccinate age instead whatever random mess decided instead. Ah shit right. See void guess. shots! weight mind :) great point. Though, we're 3 weeks storm Pfizer hangover week Moderna hangover next week. prevents virtually serious disease. Masks going affect much (ie vaccinated unmasked get case mild, vaccinated masked) Think like warehouse. product arrived state warehouse, still needs get regional warehouse‚Äôs retail stores (vaccination sites) wait patients appointments get shot arms. 

The time ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù ‚Äúshots done‚Äù means there‚Äôs lot product transit places. bigger amount product, longer supply chains, ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù places need delivery means % used never 100% state like California roughly 75% amazing. fact, two weeks second dose (Moderna/Pfizer) considered fully vaccinated protected. Nothing saying locked basement.  think understand hiring works Nobody ever ""told me"" UK leaving EU bad decision, people told American pharmaceutical industry. think theres enough evidence come conclusions topics. 

However I'm fully confident neither decision made eith vacinnes mind. Thag UK voted leave EU definitely America let's pharmaceutical companies much power.   lying I'd say erring side caution too.

They want admit two tiered society yet they're delaying truth. call caution call lying restrictions EU exported 30 million doses February alone. US UK exported none. cold hard facts. EU supplying much rest world, China; US supplying no-one 'Muricans. Congrats :)) also imagine states start dropping age limits, amount shots go quickly. GSK working different vaccine also multiple covid treatments development.

The Merck considered partnering New Jersey-based one (Merck &amp; Co). unwilling produce vaccine at-profit, core requirement (I‚Äôm disagreeing issues well, Ox vaccine one priority requirement partner).

Edit: likely nothing happened 14th 30th - you‚Äôre confusing two companies. there's growing number people asking finish line moving based scientific evidence idea exists.

I'm saying that's person doing, probably aren't, seem asserting anything crazy here. look thread vaccine seems actually preventing infection, that's suddenly enough data exactly data previously asked for.


Same statements like ahbe distancing/shutting businesses everyone vaccine.....kids able vaccinated mid 2022...that never metric going normal, metric hospilizations/deaths. nothing things here, ""safe enough"" still pretty damn safe. Yep, fatigue headaches common side effects. 2nd dose felt pretty shitty day (low fever, chills, aches) passed 12 hours. worried 10 cases Brazil, 5 minutes worry save entire headache later. Exponential growth exponential, stop growth starting first place incredibly high value. You‚Äôre fine. one dose 92%, you‚Äôll survive getting dose day outside 42 days. we're going 50% dine capacity next week. I'm bit hesitant, maybe this'll good thing. wanna get back normal see movie whole ""let's allow states figure trust properly"" thing really backfired real shame robust federal effort. There's lot blame go around, pretty much levels government mounted pretty underwhelming response. really expected US flex supply chain prowess leverage private partnerships companies like Amazon (who offered help). I'm saying unmitigated disaster, expected better want say really appreciate positivity. We're understandably ready let's take away absolutely absurd almost 100 million doses given. Define vaccinated. Even one shot provides great deal protection, actual course mRNAs 2 shots. look 1 shot=1 vaccination, that's official line. remember believing would two week thing. wrong was. say something, never, ever, take ability live free experience new things granted ever again. understand drive cure AIDS keeps going job. 

I may always agree precise wording uses every interview, vitriol gets spouting whatever ""burn masks, party like 1999"" stuff certain posters want hear pretty shameful considering man dedicated trying help society long posters even born. fine, portion Pfizer's original trials also got doses 6 weeks apart, UK running protocol 3 month apart fine. love see conventions get official announcements like this. old normal way back I'm loving it. California: 500k best part is, could way less effective variant *and still extremely effective.*

97 percent gives huge buffer starts lose enough efficacy matter. true, FDA presentation, slide 26, 2 weeks first shot, there's clinical significance protection (&lt;0.1%). Also California wondering thing. sure delays processing/shipping/reporting something fundamental. However, [this seems state gearing administer 4million shots per week starting april (which 2.5 weeks out!). reach would significant increase (1.3mil per week so). 17-18 mil shots april would serious progress. got 'em right! still would better less cases keep mind vulnerable population vaccinated. cases really high hospitals struggle capacities. think fact 90% people think smarter half. think think. think point OP making blood clots unrelated vaccination would happened either way sample group size age. thought purely political posts allowed?

I know ""ever"", biggest public health mistake US made 2020 bothering national response pandemic states build CDC's tell everyone stay home could buy tests abroad.  money bottleneck, production capacity. can't make new capacity overnight, takes years. Well think problem don‚Äôt actually know true effect size lockdowns, ultimately don‚Äôt know things would‚Äôve much worse without worth Generally would think accurate, however, MASSIVE snow storm heading across west/Midwest weekend definitely slow things down.

I know first-hand vaccine appointments weekend postponed. Well case take Roaring 20s 1 hour delay fetching comments.

Yea something going change immediately ever. Many companies gone working home permanently many still decided they're going babies said mind using bits I‚Äôm cool it.

In 80s, expect roughly 1000 cases per million month, 650 70-79, 425 also 11 million doses UK without issue.

One experts get comment also responded pause Sicily, stating: 'pausing use case evidence bad PR Europe, one wonder earth they're doing.

Definitely willing wait turn sign I'll that. wasn‚Äôt eligible weeks ago?? province, Canada 100% agree noticed changes. absolutely *can* case case rules.

Hold horses. work (in PA) said they're even going consider July earliest Sure perhaps vaccine ""disappeared"" whole syringe charade deliberate. Well... parents never take kids anywhere car send school daycare then.

Because odds needing protection flu car accident far higher odds needing covid.

The heat death universe long way away, gonna sad households. I'm always glad Redditors determine policy. we'd want closed border biggest trade partner 

And flipping script, t_d users Qanons determined policy? JFC. Oh right, tried January. Man wild ride

All say, us Canadians often ignorant Gucci belters. High five sub changed lately terms majority users are. used much sane people get anxious people spit faces pandemic, feel safe people wearing masks keeping bit distance pandemic. seems way around. sure happened, maybe people getting vaccines seeing light end tunnel. Yeah...that's exactly complex I'd ask mean complex steps? 

There's always risk human error adding administrative steps idk believe way portraying things. process thaw dilute.

[This info ultimately, there's always exceptions, look assume bunch stuffs gonna get fucked up. did, folks getting *concentrated vaccination doses* it'd result folks quietly walking away zero protection versus something like experiencing drastic symptoms.

Besides point dose count would end wayyyyy it'd get caught pretty fast. Try bit informed next time, Yeah, Bush Sr died years back He‚Äôs giving best forecasts information available That‚Äôs it‚Äôs based trends going, there‚Äôs another surge, mutation escapes vaccine-induced immunity, something else could go wrong, that‚Äôll change outlook. medical advice evolve world around us. It‚Äôs lies misinformation, that‚Äôs science works. US announced contract Pfizer associated paying updates production facility.  Pfizer later stated get money complete delivery vaccine. I'm sure exactly works. can't see contract. far know country published contract covid vaccine.

But surprise production facility country. paying upgrades it. would facilitiy named contract. US EU. 

If production facility country. see reason name one. contract X facility country, country decides ban exports. fucked. can't switch another facility that's contract states. would need write new contract. science speaking itself. cant ask real world data.  .....but America bad hUr DuR vacuum would ideal case. reality unfortunately shaped politics, far ideal. I'm bringing nationality since german too, surprised convinced decisins made purely scientifically based. 

I would like be, sadly surge vaccines Houston, Dallas, etc. save lives? know, know, lives save today despite Governor does? Gov won‚Äôt it, US Army get vaccinate many people possible. think first virus world ever seen?

I'm southern CA disbelief parent's second appointment canceled, found happening *a lot.* hope get together quick fix logistics.  What? nothing discussing. Also. What? - mean vaccinated people can‚Äôt transmit virus? I‚Äôve confused people talk possibility transmission even vaccinated people. unlikely become
Infected covid (symptomatic asymptomatic), chance people could still transmit virus without actually contracting covid themselves? thing? surprised one acquired Moderna yet.That company seems worth tons money. rather large leap took, coming apart seams, heads filled bogy men snakes. Science based hypothesis assumptions tested data. Given vaccines work way, unreasonable assumption make one well. Yes still need PROVE it, nevertheless hypothesis based years vaccination ""unscientific."" listed two occasions know of, mistakes. Every time looked claim Fauci lied ""said something different,"" case nuance said originally ignored, best available information simply changed. 

I want reiterate Fauci specifically lie two instances listed bad things do, attitude subreddit Trump level liar bewildering.

Well, bewildering. simply people read headlines see change week week without ever actually read said. Noone said EU limiting AZ vaccine exports. however made sound though EU also limited Biontech exports, *which not*. established rules saying can‚Äôt fulfil contract can‚Äôt could share burden

And Aus would still receive lower doses ordered still delay. facilities EU 

AZ running facilities, signed contract, seller. responsibility production worldwide effort

AZ Pfizer/Biontech vaccines de facto researched developed EU. Biontech developed vaccine AZ British-Swedish company basically operated EU UK didn‚Äôt really leave year. doesn‚Äôt really matter discussion that‚Äôs is. 

I honestly think disagree one issue is: EU limit vaccine exports? say, long far behind vaccinations high spread, reasonable limit export surplus contractual obligations manafacturers. still UK/US take everything themselves, least exporting anything EU afaIk. It‚Äôs tie efficacy seems, Pfizer producing much more. US EU alone deliver 900 million year + 1100 million countries. metric counts vaccine received administered, CA near bottom. Provide evidence bold claim  data? 

You think reliable Covid data China February?

You think anyone data mask use early? so, bridge sell It‚Äôs Israel sharing data Pfizer - per deal Covax meant entire world. Rich countries ordering outside Covax what's raiding Covax. curiosities sake: many people know ""cut line"" take vaccine? hearing anecdotes I'm curious, absolutely judgement. Sounds like UK dealt drop supply February.

Hard really tell UK obnoxiously secretive supply, justification 'don't want make EU jealous'.  Quite frankly, think making feud worse.

But regardless, sounds like March going huge month ramping supply back up, assume ramp Pfizer AstraZeneca production ramping well. Again, due UK secrecy, hard know. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make abuse you‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make lockdowns‚Äù agree, I'm referring getting mindset going things again. realness set Tom Hanks &amp; wife, well Rudy Gobert NBA season suspending reality-breaking. many headlines short day two really made seem like world ending. truly set well. go work next week, remember absolute sense dread discomfort world, coworkers --- infected? --- job going do. ended going remote last week March, otherworldly week March 11th never forget. almost certainly good, yeah. 

I take every publication Pfizer strong indication Moderna's efficacy well. Texas Spring really interesting experts afraid say would shocking vaccines block transmission. get that‚Äôs tested, given know viruses vaccines, would really unexpected drastically lower transmission. get weren‚Äôt tested yet, it‚Äôs amazing afraid people speculate good things completely ok going deep end predicting negativity. Somehow there‚Äôs caution end spectrum.  don‚Äôt know everything, know things. Knowledge isn‚Äôt binary thing, rely know. example, mRNA variants demonstrate less effectiveness Africa variant, don‚Äôt know exactly means real world environment. 

My point isnt specific Africa (or any) variant, rather two vaccines shown identical differences may important.

Now, people ability convince leaders it‚Äôs time, ultimately leaders press button. Careful now, heard withdrawals diabolical America save world now. Europe struggling get enough vaccines AZ appears problematic. South America bad shape. dont think Asian countries better, maybe except china, india, taiwan. vaccinate (willing) adults, need start shipping surplus vaccines world over.  Right want lift mask mandates amount unvaccinated people would take masks lie vaccinated. saw something smaller thread 

[Scotland Level 0 (least restrictive) I‚Äôm sorry Brazil worst leader Bolsonaro. He‚Äôs scumbag. feels like BS considering essential workers interact people often virtually anyone else. can't believe politician even brought need set mass vaccination effort essential workers think really winning issue. Really dumb. know state in, look small rural health clinics. state (NC), lot opened beyond state-wide guidance supply exceeds demand.

If Walgreens pharmacies vaccinating, call ask put waitlist end day. lot vaccinating people end day avoid throwing doses away (amazingly, no-shows). I'm really glad see subreddit slowly dying. Public health priority pandemic stop spread. agree pandemic taking toll mental health, keep ignoring guidelines it‚Äôll drag along, keep virus circulating us restricted guidelines.

Wear mask, socially distance, get vaccinated. That‚Äôll help us get back normal faster. people refusing it. far them. Considering Q2 around 20% vaccines EU expects receive made Astra Zeneca, sure big problem actually is. good thing none us live home. feel bad kids any. use pharmaceutical products controlled expert boards countries. decide statistical evidence politics. discussion ends here, somehow bringing politics nationality this. nice day pathological liar one big reasons among many USA's COVID numbers high relative countries.

CDCs data shows masks substantial impact COVID numbers. real reason high president, party member people surrounded taking seriously telling everyone hoax. Fauci said stay home social distance, instead people protested wanted haircut. People want listen matter said smart people offend them.

Try bit informed next time. Thanks! One annual conventions go (which cancelled last year) announced event going forward August, event organizers got abuse hate social media result, saying ""too soon hold event"".

And jaw dropped, wanting yell ""IT'S AUGUST THAT'S FIVE MONTHS NOW! People getting vaccinated en-masse! We'll fine!!!""

I'm getting tired doomsayers. People allow optimism. things still shit July, sure, cancel event. give people hard time wanting get back normal. It‚Äôs literally Israel using Pfizer despite fact originally purchased vaccines several companies. expect purchases Moderna vaccines used vaccinate Palestinians help allied countries around world larger shipments already sent. United Snakes citizens loathe United Snakes ""self-loathing"". us teens since Eisenhower regime. California gonna California doesnt. *bought* enough entire population. They‚Äôre still importing Europe. Hopefully US lift export bans soon. Although don‚Äôt expect happen May June least. wanted go yacht week croatia summer..pretty much boat, hopping island island, partying large amount crowds...do sort behavior allowed summer..or think wait months year? Y'all, please keep discussion topic. Thank you. ""...Excepting tribal communities.""

Since Europe far mostly inoculated elderly, possible blood coagulation instances really matter Oxford Astra Zeneca messing blood thinner medication? 

I'm desperate hear AZ safe. allergic PEG can't Pfizer Moderna. Also many people going die Covid suspending 2 weeks afaik arriving today, we'll start see effects 15th. think depends live. know workers drugstores state (MN) getting vaccinated. sure industries. 

In part, it‚Äôs job company owners CEOs orchestrate getting vaccine. ought easier is. time last year saying wear masks all. really make statement like cuz causes confusion. going depend individual company. Everywhere slow close borders China first blew up, late Brazil. knows new variants spreading around thanks prick fobbing like common cold. think Americans giving another summer they've vaccinated please pass whatever smoking. Half country done everything without getting vaccine yet. end May gonna free everywhere. nothing new information. literally admitted straight lying try influence public behavior it‚Äôs worth, normally similar reaction flu shots first Moderna shot barely worth mentioning. arm little sore, next day slightly drowsy, drowsy allergy medicine makes me.

#We Fucked people still highly active COVID communities ones extreme end either way, ""no new normal"" side. people trying live life, especially ones getting vaccinated like say (as have), tend active communities. also posted fair bit early recently looked topics noticed shift you. Ya mean Croatia pretty open whole time YW booking going since Oct lucked out, time media scare campaign made people fear worst. end day, coronavirus dramatically different infectious viruses, lack pre-existing vaccine due impossible; rather need develop one. got first dose morning. 

I feel like Thanos getting infinity stone videos ones Iran Italy really horrifying me. remember seeing video italian covid ward barely alive patients clear domes heads (oxygen apparatus, I‚Äôm guessing) thinking utterly surreal real life. still new variants NY/CA, need evidence. variants, yes it‚Äôs becoming clear. Gee, sure would like to, I'm eligible yet apparently. History says might think better trash unless countries agreed undertake unrelated action. That's useful milestone; feels like day public consciousness suddenly shifted ""oh fuck real"" intramuscular shot embolism issue. anyone know many people receive vaccine us right now? Basically total number people age 16+. Paywall  Looking another way, friends/family members vaccinated safe socialize now. enjoy hanging meantime wait. hear Sacha Baron Cohen sale. mine people know. North. new allocation reigime almost cut area none mass sites taking appointments anymore. Happened right opened eligibility.

Basically one hand federal government promising massive supply next couple months, hand state government looking ways fuck everything up. see claims ""back normal September"" roll eyes little, least comes CA. states seem making progress. Cool. Stay home afraid normal people live lives. Yay! Cheers us! lmao fuck every single one assholes. Except Carter. Good! Astrazenca major trash! Masks aren‚Äôt routinely recommended typical viruses know 

Like said, Covid data became available, recommendations changed 

Glad we‚Äôre page office Philly allowing small numbers people work office sign-up basis &amp; said allow everyone come back we're vaccinated. People want continue WFH allowed indefinitely.

Yup. feels weird say really lucked sense. Couldve much worse. Even september people talking efficacy first vaccines may around 50% minimum level approval be. fact one year several highly effective vaccines huge achievement.  Even so, administered, open June so. can‚Äôt protect people refuse take vaccine supply meet demand. It‚Äôs choice make. Mandates need go need get back normal, large percent vaccinated. Yeah that's statistics work Science way language itself. update based current trends pandemic, best analysis what‚Äôs come short term. Anything change onward long run, positively (more vaccines expected, faster vaccination rates) negatively (new variant escapes vaccines), change analysis.

Also longer virus circulates infects people, greater chances virus mutate. We‚Äôve already seen happening UK/SA/Brazil variants, separate variants NY/CA. If, say, NY variant escapes immunity (hoping doesn‚Äôt) we‚Äôre back square one. Probably worst case scenario think of, definitive proof current vaccines provide protection variants, assume possible downside better prepared. That‚Äôs part hesitancy picking clear date, it‚Äôs still unclear. announcement date promising, meaning evidence supportive yet thing soon. I‚Äôm way. can‚Äôt wait I‚Äôm free urge refresh news day. never like times :( Wow backwards hot garbage take America needs save first. Yeah said another comment... many people seriously underestimate little Texans care government tells do. I‚Äôm gonna guess 70% didn‚Äôt even know remember governor issued mask mandate first place. doubt people going start burning masks mass. Source : Lifelong Texan good points. Another thing likely happening called herd immunity overshoot. bad outbreak virus infect higher percentage people would technically required herd immunity due virus omnipresent already. outbreak ends even people vaccinated immunity levels stay same, large chance virus could cause another outbreak equal magnitude. president year ago. Dude Australia first world country lol, vaccinations begun general public vaccinated around middle year. let piece cloth dictate emotions ?

Georgia 48th country vaccine rollout. Fml. yeah, like humans heavily influenced societies values. one ape sees another ape wearing mask they'll inclined drop mask too. strong individual thought patterns, sponge whats around us oh, sounds miserable. got moderna, i'm sure they're similar side effects. i'd interested see breakdown side effects vaccine line feel like shit moment, that's plan since vaccination made. keep ramping production actually vaccinate entire world. Problem new ballpark indoors retractable roof It‚Äôs covered Dawn, Express Tribune, News, Geo, ARY pretty much everywhere else?  Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years state. Hospitalizations free fall since Thanksgiving continue to. agree, that's exactly boneheaded move. Fauci stuck simply reporting current understanding stop that.

I can't argue find less credible now, can't find single topic Fauci subreddit literally statement makes, matter obvious well accepted, without ""let's see says tomorrow!"" comment. incredibly overdramatic. Funny mention that. must suck shaving something, irritates skin. Problem prefer look without facial hair. mask go solid week need shave. mask aren‚Äôt needed I‚Äôll happily trade issue back, I‚Äôll take get meantime. one little nuggets preserved history study this, may get lost media. 

‚Äú100 years ago, previous living presidents parties appeared video campaign encourage citizens get vaccinated‚Äù

EDIT: yes know Trump missing. Think minor detail forgotten/overlooked 100 years now. I‚Äôm tired checking news sources every day multiple times day. don‚Äôt know hell I‚Äôm expecting. news would really matter group got called early. wish could ban covid news I‚Äôm bored mind can‚Äôt go want it‚Äôs tough. last checked US total orders 600 million doses (300 million people worth) older vaccines due july 31st. ordered 100 million JJ due around 100 million undetermined due date. 

i'm betting JJ doses get spread among pharamcies retail locations fancy freezers we'll see US start shipping idk 50-100 million doses month overseas commercial contracts nothing like ordering PS5. Plus lot people don‚Äôt realize small population compared states, China , Russia etc. 37 million compared American 375 million, smaller population aren‚Äôt far behind states terms vaccinating.  Wish could piece shit actually suspect whole thing attempt steal vaccine, caught point, Kroger goes story avoid investigated kicked vaccine distribution. Ideally lower Measles level. Measles much contagious Covid..... This. Society got lucky outcome.  problem. updoot. That's nice. surplus vaccine time maybe focus job is... ""2 weeks 2nd jab"" means 5 (or 6 Moderna) weeks first dose. little evidence second dose makes significant difference, rather additional time first dose. seems lot people want go back normal even safe . News agencies make money fear politicians want give power   Let's hope in-person schooling returns without masks social distancing fall. I'm hopeful will. ironic. pretty skeptical told since previous understanding mRNA signalled protein production. theory maybe antibodies produced sort negative effect, even getting covid would risk would imagine. Throughout pandemic, former students South Korea posted pictures school wearing masks. Koreans stayed home much Americans heavy reliance public transportation system high rise residential buildings made lot difficult socially distance Americans mostly riding personal vehicles mostly living single unit homes apartments condos outside access door. USA 1632 deaths per million. South Korea 32 deaths per million. Koreans listen medical experts wear masks, Americans Dr. Fauci CDC often ride bareback. think ""keep social distancing"" part meant terms mental health, though must say able recognize people see people smile also sad, I'd rather able see mask all. 

Although heyo masks great fucked tooth pimple... happens wear mask hardly anyone gonna question mask least year two üòÖ think everyone thought ""what CVS worker wants argue proof employment"" going vaccine. doubt ever do. Got first shot last night. far sore arm, expecting lot worse already covid months ago 4 years ago, went Disney spring break. photo Snapchat corona beer airport bar like 6am. Kinda funny 3 years later ‚ÄúCorona‚Äù would ruin March vacation 3 years prior start awesome one. little early - vaccine availability bottleneck now. Hey birthday twin! Hope great day! Empty? I've administered injections get this.

Usually sealed package syringe's plunger way down, pull back fill medicine, push inject.

So syringes shipped plunger pulled back worker administered AIR (embolism alert!)? knowingly pulled plunger back administered air?

It seems likely explanation person drawing dose stick needle far enough vaccine drawn up, see enough air vial problem.
 
I'm really confused could happen mistake. Fauci people saying this? Lol, progress guess (until says something different next week, flip flopping again)   William Burroughs said something effect ""If air bubbles killed junkies"". 30 + year diabetic air bubbles suck screw dose, nothing more. may get downvoted please use someone else's link. happened weeks would end happening people eligible taking appointments others releasing limited slots. also issues people ""getting appointment"" actual list, they'd show get turned away. links intended shared. missed 2 days spring break. I‚Äôd argue there‚Äôs still probably **some** protection, no, won‚Äôt 50%. No, they‚Äôre trying assert control county city governments prohibiting taking action curb COVID spread. expect similar results since tech similar?

lEtS JuMp CoNcLuSiOnS! tHaTs AnTi ScIeNcE! portion believe Trump won? Yeah, pretty sure need inaccurate predictions Fauci order believe reality. round corners everyone accommodate anti-science idiots. Japan possibly holding Olympics, one oldest populations, desperately needs vaccines. US ally 80 years. Ship over, paid for, excess keep going country country. win humanity. case, follow example airlines overbook. Better turn away occasional person let vaccines go waste. vaccine rollout this: face ongoing, increasingly serious threat, people charge rollout easy target.

Outcomes important people's perception competence actual degree competence displayed.

* Cases fallen 8k 3k 
* New daily severe cases fallen 200 Deaths fallen total severe cases 1200 645

(per day, weekly average)

Yes end 2cond wave sharper decline, but...:

1. British variant then, leads greater spread severe cases among 50- population.
2. Far restrictions lifted back then. never kids back school, allow crowds sports events, weddings 300 people, street parties, mass funerals on.
3. People compliant restrictions. 

Lastly, previous lockdown timely, went lockdown massive spread happened, could stop spread early enough. entered lockdown late, taking long cases drop many people stopped obeying restrictions.

We known better part 10 months done help prevent spread. Blaming mayor, governor, president shirking one's personal responsibility evidence one's ignorance selfishness. Alaska become Canada?  Didn‚Äôt say we‚Äôd wearing masks 2022 last month? never thought I‚Äôd miss cta weird smells piss weed live small city (compared Canadians cities) usually like 5 women blood cloths every month. Usually hands legs, sometimes even lungs. hospital, two ones. I‚Äôm 19, 30 50, BC Leiden‚Äôs. 

Not advocating banning BC, making better. percentage small, fact given BC ripe age fifteen without tests problem (and common one). far know, work industry qualify, whether working home not... got vaccinated healthcare worker who's working home 90% since last year.

As long qualify, think there's anything unethical signing up. [Take [at [of California still lower cases per capita.

And btw page showed FL lesser cases per capita margin 300-something death rate still higher.

I dont blame people skeptical lockdowns dont get FL likes brag they're somewhere middle list covid cases. many states still done better, without lockdowns. like stuff get got told seatbelt comparison another thread say I‚Äôm unreasonable stressed possibility social distancing foreseeable future. Optimism: One year later NBA on, MLB crowds 100% cities! Brazilian too. New variant + Bolsonaro = Genocide complete Pre-vaccine, that's certainly true. Post-vaccine, people go back normal. clever tactic keep people going ham summer. Think it. tell us free drop mask june, maybe 30% population would follow suit. blame them. People burnt out. 
By declaring doomsday september, trying prevent flood gates opening. 

One thing taken consideration, vaccine. matter bad variants spread, people sick quarantining. Therefore, predict relatively normal summer everyone, starting around middle June Pfizer looking better better. best vaccine, production capabilities efficacy. think everyone cheating system? I'm seeing term ""sterilizing immunity"" thrown around, guess good bad. think you‚Äôre reading much it. strikes fear anyone I‚Äôm sorry. Idk happened yet apparently he's gonna First Take start hope recovered 100%! Ok Send shit north... Canada fucking monumental scale. interview MLB crowds? saw post earlier AZ getting put hold somewhere it‚Äôs causing blood clots.  Well actually straight lied public. Literally millions vulnerable received UK. People die time, inevitable stuff like would happen. People (i.e. press commentators getting panicked) need calm vaccine hesitancy grow.

Yes investigated need constant breathless discussion I‚Äôm hesitant vaccine passport- see worsening worldwide inequality actually fully vaxxed yet. specify that, otherwise spreading fear cause apathy vaccine. Good you. expect grateful everyone else more.
Trump really managed make mundane efforts look phenomenal. China supply developing world, still hold them. italy suspended too: Based movies that‚Äôs easiest way kill person leave trace murder weapon. simply looks like stroke heart attack. Novavax vaccine American SII already due produce starting April watched mother suffer blood clot going unrelated health issues, not. UK really well to, fuck rest world *selling* ours. 
No kidding. 
The Cambridge vaccine due go license free fully open source April 2020 -until UK Government Gates Foundation convinced license out. 
Tellingly, UK media barely mentioned sudden change heart despite reporting open source idea run up. Oh yeah got mine scheduled Sunday I'm good thankfully. wanted throw anyone else Hey, open source vaccines yet? think doubling important allies much tourism &amp; hospitality getting industries (which hit harder other) going. Canada Mexico #1 #2 countries sending tourists big margin. far could tell, one doctor one nurse, could wrong Another medical expert Reddit shares absolutely correct thoughts Even people two countries want live peace politicians countries let happen. scarier thought thing probably happened elsewhere US/world caught.  slow there's enough supply. opened everyone, still waiting... feel way seatbelts! Ill put guess, stop talking time, jeez. Stresses out. Well president told citizens stop whining sissies it. that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening. coming China? I'm Asian developing country agree comment. Vaccine equity entire world's frontline healthcare workers exist countries hoarding limited vaccine supply. guess pointless hair-splitting really. Vaccines global effort development, distribution funding makes difficult allocate source country.

Valneva (French) funded UK produce vaccine Scotland French back them. UK vaccine now? turn ESPN see appear interview? None Dr. Fauci...It's like can't escape dude past months.... No. immune system response WITHOUT virus wrecking organs. Covid much worse. 3 weeks post first dose, 2. Day 22. Takes J&amp;J vaccines stock hey good he‚Äôll share theyre done way sore arm side effect. Cold like symptoms side effect. normal, expected based differences person's immune system.

For now, investigation order, symptomatic blood clots happened less general population. may vaccine preventing blood clots (completely unfounded assumption). Keep trying 8 working. last 4 years, happy news shows sane rational statements president.

Edit: hear ya point, gotta look different lense. it‚Äôs fully effective 4 weeks 1 shot. OK, would like know administered empty syringe?

Chinese Russian trolls hahajhajahahahahah. Delusional little thing. sub, well r/europe, full little british nationalist hate EU fervour jump amyone doesnt praise AZ vaccine. think people would take vaccine investigate link - especially since batch investigations Austria. Probably coincidence, must investigated. I‚Äôd certainly refuse AZ point investigated. take long time anyway, even 2 week delay tiny amount vials matter long run. got dumped ex week before, miserable. Spent last day campus crying bathroom, bought smoothie getting train home. idea would last day old life, absolute last day non-virtual college student.

I used motorcycle helmet shield n95 bringing medicine food etc. worked well. somebodys. Many somebodys  Americans really need 4 criminals tell need take vaccine? Hint, largely apolitical scientific community put time effort making safe, effective vaccine, bunch elitists told to. One shot like 80% effective. People going back gusto great. Again, Israel infections shockingly bad stalling given one would expect based many vaccinations. Vaccine news user name IamAHorny! believe what? bill become law? gf's mom tested positive today. I've around gf. took test yesterday, comes back negative still quarantine 2 weeks? Yeah, pretty damn cool :) Dunking people expressing religious rituals, true reddit moment.

I'm religious maybe try prick faith? VA. don‚Äôt many local coffee joints near city, none Starbucks, etc. reopened indoor areas one done actual data variants suggesting efficacy severe outcomes those.

Agree completely, great advantages! I'm Pfizer doses pretty gnarly aches tiredness first one, I'm looking forward second supposed worse. I'm little jealous people gotten J&amp;J vaccine already done! purely geopolitical point view wrong. little softpower might gain sending vaccines earlier pales comparison economy shut couple weeks longer currency devaluating keep alive really (along military) influence comes from.

i'm wishing best, fingers crossed light end tunnel keeps getting closer closer! can‚Äôt find data UK exports. appears vaccines produced UK, remained UK. Unless someone else data says otherwise, appears UK done something stop AZ exporting Europe. 

None exported, exported Oxford ip cost. Pfizer making profit. that‚Äôs hard export block buying available production slots, end result feels same. It‚Äôs probably looks stark fact EU allowed 9 million exports vaccines UK. feels one-sided. maybe there‚Äôs story here...

Take will. really EU ships tho. produced company resides EU contract UK. vaccine belong EU shipped EU. would think unlikely since vaccine comes little vials syringes they‚Äôd use would individually wrapped refrigerated.... way say quite weird though. end article cite Denmark gonna receive half doses originally planned. half doses 90 million EU 45 million.

Anyways, interesting see updated plan Norway new date they'll set offer vaccine everyone. Outside select hospital networks vast majority US hospitals close capacity. I'm curious mentioning it. OP wanting people share experiences did. responded attempting teach something common knowledge already know. That's interesting. motivation?

Last night literally found slot kroger guy posted story 30 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

Tips:

Use site: find stock area. Stock mean appointments, give idea Pharmacy websites hit, zipcodes/addresses enter better shot getting shot.

You may drive little bit out, uber ride totally worth it. Plus time second dose, situation improve may able schedule closer home. Maybe issue manufacturing. likely case since reports phase 3. r/Coronavirus rule #4:

Avoid politics I'd agree dropping mask impacted yours. doesn't. much disagree. claim answers (and answers seem quite there), they're *probably* full BS. captured exact thoughts! Got first dose yesterday strangely...subdued suppose? 



Honestly expected emotional, happened fast really ho-hum way. No, know. healthcare workers wear masks time anyway. Why? hospitals need sterile clean possible. Masks *help*, trying triage, focus area needs resources most, exactly did.

Fauci incredible person helm, sure lucky he's here! right honest absolutely everything, entire family stayed safe. where's data analysis show second dose, additional time first dose, makes difference? sit home feeling like shit (literally common side effects listed CDC website), brings comfort. downvoting? We're still balls deep pandemic whether want admit not.  lockdown. probably get vaccine another month I'm 35 pre-existing conditions.

But slowly trying get mindset getting back normal safely can. know can't turn switch 'normal', take months adjust back, I'm taking baby steps moment. March 5th last year Phoenix family nice long weekend vacation. month later working home (finally years wanting desk job) partner unemployed. year went on, started business i'm still home (hopefully permanently). way, got life wanted - home family focused instead running around eff'n time, sitting traffic metro, etc. Navigating starting business making viable easy stressful, feel like lives before. remember March 11 mostly normal day me. work news small city things mostly normal, felt something coming given happening Italy around world. 

I remember reading article weekend suggesting leagues might ban fans stands, thought crazy. 

Anyways, got home around 6:30, made dinner looked phone. saw Rudy Gobert tested positive COVID thought everyone close Rudy going get really sick potentially die. 

Shortly sport leagues cancelled, mini anxiety attacks kept wondering it. anxiety given headaches chills. Again, thought lot people going die. 

The days follow crazy. work news.... news every event cancelled. Schools got cancelled (where live school never gets cancelled) fucked. 

I eventually ended working home three months. little human human contact, went lot walks realized nothing could do. whole lot thinking. 

A year later can't believe shit year was. There's still think we're 2021. feel like we're still 2020 lost year. 

Here's hoping things get better. üç∫ Sorry man even read article? get source shit literally says paragraphs instead advocates ‚Äúfocused protection‚Äù. I‚Äôm saying he‚Äôs end correct, fact display potential solution. True, present one cherry top shit cake Ontario. know Quebec starting 70+s 100% agree think majority people arguing ""pandemic over"" realize scarred infected. screaming void point. Barack old enough eligible? mention first! Hail fame Pfizer &amp; BioNTech  completely agree, probably larger problem unproven, wildly improbable. Good callout. Look UKs cases deaths past month. really think effective, lol? pandemic permanent. vaccines work, makes sense open based vaccines. don‚Äôt work, point prolonging lockdowns - accept risk COVID get back normal. agree, think take sometime people get comfortable idea going back normal.

My Dad seems struggling this. got second dose week ago, keeps shifting goal posts go restaurant. Last year, said got vaccine would go out. said wait rest family gets vaccines, he's saying think he'll ready late June relatives come visit variants such.

I know he's alone this. think hard go back normal spent year afraid people germs. can't switch year, Dad left house much (aside weekly grocery trip) year. Even goes grocery store, goes non-busy time. overwhelming majority aren‚Äôt asymptomatic. still feel like bad cold week long nasty flu, even doesn‚Äôt kill put hospital. Yes is! expect 3/4 eligible people get vaccine, that's 191.25 million. 382.5 million shots mRNA, we've given 100 million, 280-ish million left go, maximum, suddenly stop giving J&amp;J. 

At 2m/day, that's 190 days, September 17th.  Again, exceedingly pessimistic - J&amp;J doses, increase rate supply administration.

At 3m/day, that's 93 days, that's June 12th. Again, think might little pessimistic. isolated infected getting vaccinated land. day NBA got cancelled realized shit hit fan. discount vaccines same? live low income apartment free vaccines week two. Charities come apartment building frequently, everything get either discount brand right expiration date. means complaining (it's blessing), im wondering we're getting inferior even expired vaccines. I'd much rather wait even pay get done hospital doctors office better vaccine. now, second allowed Bubles will. There's ""bad luck"" science. said make sense.

As England made vaccine, that's improbable try undermine negative side don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong safety vaccine stored given right way

Do mean Denmark Austria made mistake storing giving right way? sure say? First buy all. fact single thing Donald screw up, ordered shit-ton vaccines various pharmas even knew would work well. Biden buying hedge production delays one provider. avoid kind situation facing EU. -How day?
  
-I jammed syringe someone's arm depressed plunger.
   
-oh, good, vaccinations! Great news! I'm proud great nation, America really numb... *^^^^gets ^^^^interrupted*
   
-vaccinations? Same. got job vaccinating site specifically get vaccine early. political, scientific. yes, people generally intellectual emotional maturity handle nuance scientific discussions, especially sub days. I'll enjoy says something else next week

It‚Äôs weird Fauci changes stances based ever changing new information. idiots great! offense don‚Äôt even know good president looks like new information there? clearly knew masks worked otherwise would need save healthcare workers. lied, admit it. lied lied herd immunity thought would influence people get vaccinated. straight said himself, there's need try defend him. got 10 days ago

Plan rest couple days, case get crushing fatigue intense chills, fine. Maybe grab couple frozen meals way home, pop microwave, case hit hard, netlfix chill.

Love username BTW! Actually, I'd argue state would kind suck able handle last vaccine. everything going back lockdown monday. Fuck this, back normal everything open everything get fined. Policy failed, lockdown failed, idc anymore rules - also work. vaccinated? Everyone's got judge risk tolerance.

I'd say dangerous going grocery store, less dangerous eating inside crowded restaurant. Ministry Health post raw analysis anywhere? can't find it.  He's US FAR infections deaths world. makes sense take care US population virus widespread. 

If rates like Australia New Zealand, I'd agree you. small chance vaccinated people transmit, grand scheme things means herd immunity achievable. Exactly, goofs acting like vaccine literally god sent. basing mask mandates vaccinations, community spread numbers? make sense? spread virus dropping levels safe enough, keep mandates everyone. Self preservation- drop mask, people care families, make decisions provide best them. convenient bill gates also evolve based feels message manipulate public compliance, he's already admitted doing.  Geez wish could strange considering one guy died Pfizer vaccine opposite problem. blood thin (existing known disorder) vaccine somehow exacerbated that. 

In fact got Pfizer vaccine two days ago one questions whether blood thinners. I‚Äôd said yes, probably wouldn‚Äôt told ‚Äúno go‚Äù. advised caution. 

This seems cause blood thickening. weird opposite. Step step, could better ones science speaks Imagine scared. even trolling, shit get backbone Thank you! Vaccine prevent spread help us get herd immunity. Went 5B 70B two years. 

I‚Äôm also bunch investment boards love MRNA. Read literally first sentence actual article. mean someone multiple occasions straight lied given information knew incorrect, ever believe word say? ever know he‚Äôs again?  plenty subs discuss politics. one them. Man what? Winter starts december 21st, late fall considered december 1st-20th

Dont get wrong, course doesnt crystal ball give us information come 

Just pointing even ""by september"" estimate another conservative estimate

We probably get another headline fauci saying early august back pre pandemic normal Yeah, know I'm minority. thought statement mental health component misguided. work consulting firm, biggest clients moment huge regional hospital, huge school district, large college. still can‚Äôt get vaccinated information outdated day it‚Äôs released. Seeing information differs one day next.  transmit easily children know. International travel avoided public school essentially mandating it. Depends location. Texas, Abbot allocating vaccines areas people aren‚Äôt even getting (and aren‚Äôt even wearing masks), cities like Austin need more. info found live says people groups already vaccinated allowed sign waitlists. anybody else issue too? yesterday exception. comments highlight trend rather anomaly. need mass vaccination sites bureaucracy. halt trial concerns fluctuations. makes sense. might answer, normal statistical noise, least concern need address. consistently running participating races events like Spartan Tough Mudder. lost 35 pounds 2019 working fantastic team people age work enjoyed. Got laid off, found work separate team really like management work, least job.

It's abdication responsibility. trials overlapped, said long term effects animal trials take years determine Sounds like information outdated then. We‚Äôre looking vaccinations everyone late spring/early summer everyone least one dose Canada day. entirely disagree you. think things much complicated. 

All us interconnected dependent design. free market american capitalism sold world last 60 years. ""You good offer best price we'll we're good at, sell "" clearly farce. countries put protectionist policies God forbid nationalise industry Americans unhappy use might either economically militarily push everyone towards free market open trade idea.

Canada mostly bought cheaper outsource vaccine production country did. Turns mistake.

Now little bit tougher entirely benefit USA, they've put protectionist policy hardest time last 50 years.. Oh interesting. Hmm, long term virus effects seem enjoyable either, reaction T-cell activation - it‚Äôs expected. remember watching Pence/Fauci press conference beginning pandemic, probably early March. Fauci said personally wouldn‚Äôt get cruise elderly people reconsider, people could fine cruise. abroad time country COVID, remember thinking crazy. US would shut within month, cruises included. Guess happened less two weeks later?

I doubt Fauci great doctor. He‚Äôs also great bureaucrat. He‚Äôs CYA guy. can‚Äôt count substantial predictions guidance he‚Äôll parrot party line. He‚Äôs always cautious. Essential buzz word. know, answer question.  thing husband. wearing N95 wearing faceshield. Damn virus still got through. simply random fluctuations number people blood clots. Tomorrow I‚Äôm going second week give injections county. happy part vaccination effortüòÄ sure general population remember reading recently J&amp;J version ""events"" initial testing. 40k participants, think 15 vaccine sort clot event another 10 similar ""event"" even placebo.

Oh ya, here: point US shipments would go shipments EU. literally 5km lab developed vaccin, based technology invented local university. vaccins exported US.

Also, Marvel makes movies call Marvel Disney. Since Janssen still separate company, Janssen windows J&amp;J, even though mother company. stay here, 5-10% vaccinated people protected 

That's 95% effective means. means 5% people would gotten covid without vaccine get it. That's much smaller number 5% people. trolley problem harder real lives line, it? Santa Clara County, counts ""North Southern California"". know, many chains vaccines different distribution points starting Federal Government. instance, County Hospitals get supply County, gets supply State California, gets Federal government. CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens, Safeway, Albertsons offshoots get directly Federal Government. Kaiser, gets supply State California, like County, without equitability benefit resulting vaccines. said, County, four main places sign vaccines are:

vaccinefinder.org &lt;- CDC backed vaccine finder, mostly private pharmacies 

vaccinateca.com &lt;- non-governmental organization helping Californians get good, up-to-date information availability COVID-19 vaccines

myturn.ca.gov &lt;- CA State signup system get people lined providers area

vax.sccgov.org &lt;- Santa Clara County's vaccination signup appointment website leading many options county hospital systems.

None appointments available according linked websites.

It frustrating process. really concerned could take aspirin since blood thinner would theory dramatically decrease risk clots. business usual power plant world. could get shot, swear I‚Äôd make it. gimme shot, need shot! company owners arrange workers vaccinated group. 

My husband occasionally works hospitals part job. 

His employer got coworkers classified 1A, arranged vaccinated part groups mass vaccination site. 

He got J J vaccine Tuesday. 

Meanwhile I, older him, waiting second Pfizer. became eligible two months ago. Registered everywhere could.

Nice. wonder aren‚Äôt rushing forward move onto next category. effectively categories. year ago spring break school. week break. hearing bit covid spreading Texas area, surreal.

Unfortunately didn‚Äôt happen. point forward, knew going gradually get worse see he's though. Unfortunately, lockdowns would particularly devastating country like Brazil. Lockdowns caused lot unemployment poverty, poverty already widespread problem Brazil can't afford make worse. people particularly vulnerable harms lockdown, probably best course action. need find another strategy protect vulnerable without hurting people.  Ok. Awesome Try now, work. would definitely PCR positive infectious. PCR extremely sensitive; sensitive even detect RNA dead virus longer infectious cleared body yet. long swab done correctly, infectious person definitely PCR positive. compare US combined entire world lol. Yeah, one person might've able sway holdouts got secret. know, like coward. many people die getting vaccine moratorium? Wish Merck helped produce Pfizer vaccine instead, we'll take guess... anything helpful 600k people died across US throughout whole pandemic, Texas since mandate lifted. can‚Äôt pin Abbot hope stays like good. Traffic wonderful! can't work home going work whole pandemic. Oh good. 

And downvoting original comment: vaccine considered human right. save protect every life also undocumented living US vaccinated would present road block herd immunity. likely that's good thing. Means working. say smoke cigarettes get Loiuaisana long 16.  Theres long list health conditions, overweight (and obese course) smoking list.  pretty much open anyone, clinic went scheduled appointmet today taking walk ins plenty vaccine.  going get easy get next weeks everywhere thikn ::California enters chat::: guy truly excels consistent messaging. stayed lane start fame went straight little head his. focused group 75+ vast majority retired. focus working age get back work? really know expect. surreal. mom came back Vegas February 2020. actually stoked plans year. going big concert May.

It surreal. world like nothing I'd ever seen.But thankfully, I'm able WFH. like another poster said, realized I'm lot tougher thought. coming someone anxiety panic issues. took one day time. reflect lot things last year. It‚Äôs happening ton San Diego. Several large scale vaccination sites amazing jobs shut days end. Maybe try spend bit time understanding nuance, great reliable truthful he's been? saved millions lives! Dr. Fauci forthcoming amazing! wish people smart honest like Fauci CDC. He's right everything, people US continue heed words track record exceptional. new information came out, informed us directly honestly.

Oh Sooo.... that's them, right? needs stop talking this. I‚Äôm tired inconsistency. doesn‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs him. target July 1 later that. feel like someone missing list. Yet. Good news; [the vaccine's Brazilian variant too! That‚Äôs great choice! remember eating two edibles right Ohio‚Äôs ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù announced. bad idea lol. literally next day husband started feeling symptoms covid. able get tested time meet age requirements leave country. time feeling better test negative. knew sure covid tested positive antibodies months later. time husband didn‚Äôt leave house three months, got delivery groceries. worst three months life. am, getting second vaccine dose weekend, cautious optimism year. many folks ignored part eligible based job job person/had direct contact.

This really stressed enough beginning. know people working ""frontline essential industries"" home whole time still got it. Meanwhile many friends working person ""frontline"" still waiting. kind wish completely age healthcare.   know covid tests expensive lot people, I'd say that's sort coercing people taking shot cheaper, even choose making decision purely based health. bet guy doesn‚Äôt even want drill hole head let demons out! Actually flu spread well, masks, hand washing social distance. shows coronavirus better spreading. Also shows maintained proper hygiene flu. believe Hawai‚Äôi least makes meaningful effort enforce it, state so. drug severe seizures symptom withdrawal scary.

I‚Äôd love got another office space think damage done one trusts anymore. wonder percentage current death toll people eligible vaccinated chose political misinformation I'm saying people need vaccine. young healthy, necessary. People may also concerned approved emergency use authorisation, potential long term side effects may found due unusually short time trials (it's usually around 10 years). Time tell us whether concerns invalid, forcing people get job arguably discriminatory breed mistrust. Eyy old fart Carter still kicking spirit 99 death's door? True American patriot there. states?  Even scarier thought half-wit administering empty syringe presumably entrusted following Pfizer's complicated dilution procedure. That's bit double standard think? definition Pfizer J&amp;J American vaccines. AZ vaccine developed Oxford university. AZ approving Pfizer early saved UK's ass

Saying UK would problem thing strange statement. videos China people keeling streets seem suspicious now.  third choice practically relevant anywhere outside minarchistic theorizing. Currently, whatever specific issue may be, policy decision deal made government.

I disagree. policy regards people wear practical option small government attitude. see people make argument time. think pandemic, smart option government stop mandate stuff like public health, many small government-minded people want government step let businesses decide enter place business requirements enter.

This quite ""government nothing except military""-type people. wanting government step needs worn when. 

Mandating people wear masks actually pretty damn huge reach US government, likes I've never witnessed 35 years planet thus far. agree mandates due public health crisis, impossible deny still huge overreach compared power government usually has. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

What else going extra shots everyone‚Äôs vaccinated?
Keep mattresses? almost think everyone afford buy health insurance pocket. Touch√© countries need ones cases dead people. Many EU, check brain.  get flu shot Kroger every year always check this. baffling. Lmao leave asshole. reason all. reason even J&amp;J won‚Äôt also significantly curb spread. believe me, covid tests aren‚Äôt cheap. 100-150$ per test. Lol. It‚Äôs good see virus supporters. Cases per capita FL lower CA. source: think FL better states locked fown? Could lockdowns ineffective? want vaccine man. open incognito mode, read every Chicago Tribune article. Basically, Illinois overwhelmed hospitals, two waves worse almost everywhere else states one major wave. all, Illinois managed avoid overwhelmed hospitals seen states. new Tribune analysis pandemic deaths shows two waves took extraordinarily high toll state‚Äôs population.  federal estimates excess deaths ‚Äî many people died usually expected ‚Äî Illinois ranked among 10 worst states (including District Columbia) 10-month period March December. vulnerable largely protected May latest, that's gonna issue summer. What's unsure EU able offer vaccine every adult - personally still believe gonna happen July let's see. Actually #49 via quick good search: ‚Äúcovid vaccine state‚Äù  Big trading partner, shares largest border US. same...  Putting date it. like this. Much better ""eventually, may move towards getting back degree normal, perhaps."" 

I know hedging part job, reasonable give people date, things change later on, admit old prediction longer fits data? much sub british nationalist brigades. already made r/europe cesspool garbage. cant discussion 60% posters nationalist UK Yeah, always end scheduling yearly flu shot Thursday, I'll inevitably call sick work next day feeling shitty (and may well make 3-day weekend)

My reactions doses Pfizer vaccine arm soreness feeling like hangover day half... arm soreness definitely worse 2nd shot, fatigue hangover-ness same. day seemed like lasted month.

The morning normal, afternoon slightly panicked, evening pure chaos.

I‚Äôll never forget it. Still haven‚Äôt pointed said wrong. god hella funny I'm snob listening overwhelming majority experts, make you? made point, Biden needs stop supplying world indebting US.  prove vaccinated - way someone vaccinated cannot fake. imo, turning vaccine point fine. let someone really wants instead, wont go waste read pandemic playbook? magical solution think is.  Yep, like completely misread article accused it! Talk pathetic. seem like hit nail head. read fine print bottom results based post says

‚ÄúThis assay antibody nucleoprotein generated natural infection. vaccines produce antibody spike protein detected assay.‚Äù go snobbery. like speak of. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£  stop talking, don‚Äôt know hell you‚Äôre talking about. damages. state‚Äôs complaint would city breaking law violating state supremacy, seeking injunction force city stop. literally talked EU limiting Biontech exports failed prove it

Again, you‚Äôre mistaken.

I claimed Pfizer included EU vaccination export control law. linked article explaining EU cracking vaccine exports.

My whole point is, countries quota contracts AZ vaccine companies EU doesn‚Äôt care. could share burden lower expected manufacturing output customers. doesn‚Äôt. 

If EU quotas aren‚Äôt met FULL countries (as happened Australia) longer get vaccine shipments even lower amount.

That‚Äôs ever saying. EU putting first cracking vaccine exports. 

So don‚Äôt pretend otherwise say EU cracking vaccine exports report comment bs reason get removed. said true. 

Now direct consequence EU actions, Australia‚Äôs vaccination program delayed nationwide.

The EU may manufacturing vaccine, let‚Äôs pretend hand creating it. UK pretty big hand AZ, no?

Also one cares vaccine companies using EUs ‚Äúelectricity labour‚Äù AZ vaccine companies paying market rate probably invested building factories EU. 

So what, Oxford created damn vaccine doubt (did any?) it‚Äôs funding came EU. 

It worldwide effort EUs alone. Trump's plan US. bad got ditched killing half million Americans. safe Brazilian brothers sisters get madman office. March 11 birthday (I guess forever connected pandemic 2011 Japanese earthquakes) 

Anyway day pretty normal, went work aged care got homemade cupcakes. Australian, annoucement reach us morning 12th, day Trump suspended trans-atlantic travel, watching CNN day laptop. 

Stuff really changed us 13th/14th first domestic restrictions announced. Friday med entrances exam post-poned following weekend. memory gets hazy here. Uni began earnest following Monday (it delayed already two weeks allow international students return), classes day events evening got progressively cancelled. Eventually came got email saying uni online next day onwards, joked 1.5m rule friends then. Never fully stepped campus again, except ran two weeks later course book lonely admin person behind glass waved distance. 

After everything rushes ahead becomes history, listening Premier PM give nightly pressers, footy cancelled ofc Melburnian, went whole second-wave, curfew 9 week lockdown. 

Man can't believe year already. USA contained virus early stingy vaccine now


You mean China? doubt that. Incompetence much likely. intentional hope throw book whoever this. remember day Tom Hanks announced wife contracted virus. gym treadmill, needless say stopped workout immediately went home. things started get real me. saw NBA suspended season, started get freaked out. everything happened quickly. Honestly, first week pandemic one scariest times life. Every day waking terrible anxiety, didn‚Äôt leave bed much. honestly, last year hasn‚Äôt bad. tough times, able spend lot extra time dad brother, found ways creative, spent lot time outside, learned appreciate small joys life. It‚Äôs crazy see might getting mess soon. Last March feels like forever ago, time, long ago all. Sometimes kind feel.. nostalgia early pandemic days. Nostalgia might right word, word usually associated good things, don‚Äôt know else describe it. people work industries outlined 1b 1c (grocery store, food agriculture, manufacturing, etc) qualify vaccine work home? so, would ethical get otherwise young healthy? Seems like grey area. KY matters.  Thinking back worst pandemic purchases... today may well day finally crack open case pork ramen noodles bought worried able go grocery store.

Might better idea buy chest freezer stock frozen meat vegetables instead. remember days earlier company shut offices three months, saying it'd safer work home.

We thought three months crazy, genuinely thought it'd like previous outbreaks avian swine flu SARS - might bad Asia would swiftly contained Europe.

A days later Spanish Govt. declared state alarm even allowed outside exercise - obvious going something serious. Save lame self-hating energy parts reddit please ""why still light outside?""

""it's tomorrow, man""

*stumbles away trough line people waiting, failing put away zip landing ground think matter later said link. People already refusing vaccine Europe can't see things improving now. Thanks post - glad hear went well you. FVL (heterozygous) previous history multiple clots PE, I'm blood thinners life. talk vaccines causing clots really concerned me, especially since new there's practically info vaccine interactions people like us. really worried might lessen effects blood thinners, I'd willing bet cases people taking them.

If mind asking, bad 2nd shot so, long effects? want take Moderna one well. 93 year old grandmother due get week, give idea timelines. Also, province ignoring federal guidelines AstraZeneca (which avoid giving 60+), knows she'll get one good vaccines not. There's extension someone made autorefreshes you. Otherwise apparently drop appointments right around midnight days. big drops monday mornings. got one Monday, appointments available like 2 hours. I'm necessarily biggest fan, damn feels good real president again. bet. Soon I'll sucking coronavirus happily conspiring stop federal proceedings violence like rest ""enlightened"", right?


I wonder provides kool-aid. ""enlightened"" Wiseman showed way? Hannity? Rogan? Shapiro? bad get second jab. would probably saved life. wasn‚Äôt planning stopping hearing time doesn‚Äôt help mental health. white man I‚Äôm Glad donate vaccine minority poor country. Thank you! actually looked find much. ‚ÄúIt thought supplies never delivered one many governments pre-ordered doses Pfizer vaccine, used inoculate members public.‚Äù  It‚Äôs super effective! mean 3rd surge? I'd say highly likely read it. assume malice profiteering. fly Virgin Islands like 160 get shot. I‚Äôve heard people that. Yes, J&amp;J shipping drug substance US fill &amp; finish prevented export said finished vaccines claim US manufactured. Expecting anything else US stupid. problem. would put camps/cages looking like immigrants. mother already vaccinated grandmother first dose already. dad isn‚Äôt vaccinated yet goes one day week don‚Äôt anything close contact anyway. 

I‚Äôm probably waiting grandmother gets second dose I‚Äôll start looking work. They'd probably want use Comiskey/US Cell instead, parking situation much better, could spread people better like United Center. Looks like also mentions different batch. (""Die steirische Krankenpflegerin erhielt ihre Impfung aus einer anderen Charge."") True lol God feel bad Brazilian people. suppose rest world needs wall Brazil notice. Great sources, cheers! 
My statement true nonetheless. probably agree every invention based prior research case seems prior research widely funded US tax money. added European tax money, mix international scientific community voila, result quite good! 
I think that‚Äôs something could quite happy about, distribution somewhat reasonable also international endeavor. never thought would miss standing 8 inches away another dude, simultaneously drunk pissing trough together 1:45 Wednesday; are. concerns vaccines made US. mind boggling one sees morally wrong. Good US 100m vaccinating citizens millions everyday. Meanwhile 3rd world countries struggling get enough vaccines even front line healthcare workers richer countries purchasing millions vaccine makers prioritizing rich countries too. feel sorry healthcare workers poorer countries right still fighting pandemic unvaccinated. lol wonder friend Canada said could get sputnik vaccine lol. India keeps going extra mile developing world. can't thanked enough generosity prowess pandemic  scroll right page sent there's column reflects ""cases per million people""....CA higher category FL. fact is, CA FL took exact opposite approaches data indicates FL came better. Lockdowns effective, causing misery making people go bankrupt lose livelyhoods. imagine plentiful stock + vaccines means chances death plummet rate. Monoclonal antibodies pretty amazing, know stage 4 cancer patient caught COVID recovered immediately getting pumped full them. states opening prematurely high risk according cdc sign up. don‚Äôt want go inside somewhere cases start spiking unvaccinated people. 

Ethically I‚Äôd say fine. She‚Äôs chemo immune medicines. someone vaccinated Virginia Kroger 4 days ago (thankfully Charlottesville), lot questions they‚Äôre, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna vaccinate 12 people day‚Äù policy.  Getting hopeful we'll good treatments would make potential wave next autumn much less concern"
