Hopefully contribute latin american neighbors 2022.  afraid new mutation happening even allow people go school. think giving much credit mask. Apparently mask stands us next deadly mutation. Something done. someone. Somewhere. something done, someone, somewhere.  Again, breakthrough rate measure? Delta turned transmissible likely deadly unvaccinated people always progress way mutation. Think we're hoping transmissible, less deadly variant push Delta. elementary school children, it‚Äôs 2 3 liters per minute.

Even fat ones?  data % population booster ? course. mistake‚Ä¶ Delta insanely high viral loads. another variant pops didn‚Äôt originate Delta, unlikely overtake unless shares similar mutations make contagious Things chill FL June... Anyone position would endanger child take necessary precautions prosecuted full extent law. professional works children need understand responsibility. entitled personal life; whatever want; teacher, made sure least 6 8 feet away double mask &amp; shield place strong sanitation procedures place, constant hand washing &amp; wipes desks. shitty lesson kids learn.  think unplugging laundry/cleaning going bring back people life died since March 2020. much death life I'm sure ever fully recover even therapy. seems go on. friend mine lost parents. One vaccinated. lost several family members last year. think brain comprehend much loss happened. would end burning quickly sick people tend go outdoors hang around long.


Going what's happened past, what's likely happen less deadly infectious strain take hold. known well year sub still thinks every single outdoor event super spreader event  One relatives put getting vaccine another close relative died covid afraid would negatively impact future fertility. people factors made especially high risk, first thought ""Dying covid probably significantly decreases ability children, too, okay...?""

I would like roll article whack nose (*WITH LOVE*) oh hey, look shit: 

""In Palm Beach County, Dr. Dudley Brown chief obstetrics gynecology Jupiter Medical Center. Brown, too, seeing unvaccinated maternity patients end hospital. wants people know getting vaccinated also vital getting pregnant first place.

""Men COVID relatively significant decreases sperm count afterwards,"" Brown said. ""Women going fertility treatment, in-vitro fertilization, recovering COVID, perhaps less favorable IVF cycles ‚Äî less likely result successful pregnancy. vaccine negatively impact fertility, meaning cause infertility, know COVID negatively impact fertility."" ""  Nurses forefront vaccine hesitancy misinformation. undoing work doctors scientists everywhere! Let‚Äôs part force anti Vaxx nurses professions. America needs stop defending nurses! unvaccinated nurse essential!  Totally. John Hammond also ""*had control*"" things didn't. people died. Good people. Lawyers, muscle men, even shit programmers.

Maybe countrymen watch documentary attempt controlling nature island. called ""**Jurassic Park**, perhaps heard it?  It‚Äôs also worth noting would contagious delta overtake become main strain. RIDE HARLEY COVID AFRAID ME! arrow weird greater symbol ‚Äúdaddies‚Äù one wants enforce it. Security either can‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt care   hope test comes back negative don‚Äôt know want say I‚Äôm sorry struggling. xo You‚Äôre elevator long. Exposure dependent time distance. Standing four feet away someone minute huge exposure. 

Yes, virus exposure based others entering elevator recently. people often go many flights can‚Äôt always use stairs. 

It‚Äôs balance. minimize exposure can, ways confusing follow. isn‚Äôt perfect. 

It‚Äôs rocket science. Yes - suggesting single metric misinformation. 
It plain fact 25% breakthrough rate high infection states - much 18% moderate infection states. willfully ignorant - leading COVID news last week. Blows mind are...so many refusing vaccine multiple states *again* ran space dead bodies.....*again*

This people prefer instead getting vaccinated...or wearing masks matter..... hard wrap head around. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted, I‚Äôm sure large percentage people wearing masks/following rules partly due fatigue. FDA CDC give timeline approving third dose boosters general population? saw CNN Jake Tapper talking Fauci Tapper said Biden considering boosters five months second dose instead 8. Fauci basically said depends data didn‚Äôt really take side issue. people COVID infects, likely mutate become vaccine resistant, even vaccine avoidant together. it‚Äôs important limit it‚Äôs ability mutate learn virus behaves. Eventually become something akin flu. Common, treatable, big deal. know enough virus, high alert avoid major outbreaks. Ah ffs again. We‚Äôre already drowning normal delta cases new one pops might affected current vaccines  I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve Sturgis seen bars? majority huge literally open air behind storefront/facade, baseball games running consecutively every night US packed tens thousands sitting elbow elbow several hours. Baseball games last 9 months year yes, people travel country see teams play. Didn‚Äôt know exposed/positive till today. symptoms still symptoms. really weird timing all.  2020 think anyone arguing capitalism underlying cause. think they're saying one acting thinking, ""boy, go support capitalism"". lives Americans accustomed wanting live sold us capitalism machine. I'm surprised scroll far find actually optimistic, forward looking comment. human race absolutely bounce back COVID people survive better struggled experience.

We heal reinvesting taken away us evolving experiences meaningful. reconnect others new exciting ways. travel again. prepared make personal sacrifices health greater good depends them. I'm teacher boggles whole mind. students wear masks, staff, still worry wish could remote learning safe. cognitive stuff worry about. Yeah maybe ""sick"" long likely ""severe"" putting kids risk amount cognitive degradation could alter course whole lives worse, literally actual opposite job educator supposed be. kids deserve much better. start denying anti vax oxygen beds need get trusted medicine refuse prevent got lots Vacant buildings across country. Lets cram unvaccinated COVID infected people forget em. Like Oubliette. wish kids could get vax Wow sorry hear that! school district, covid related reasons, come sick day bank. teachers‚Äô union pushed came back in-person learning. hope union would fight too! Funny pro-life, ""think children"" stance crumbles second there's even slightest inconveniences. Blamo! would expose vaccinator know Covid?   hasn‚Äôt lockdown long time. absolutely see family friends, travel, etc responsibly. Went bar last night show proof vax door open air/partially outside. 

It‚Äôs kind straw man people frame choice ‚Äúliving life‚Äù part responsible. According New England Journal Medicine National Institute Health...

&amp;#x200B;

Masking work, neither social distancing. vaccine already shown 100% effective blocking transmission preventing illness, ""should vaccinated"" argument moot point.

Time face music, COVID going anywhere. Serious question, FMLA work situation ? Hopefully states same. reason destroy states hospitals ignorance states 2020 Part III Thank you. encouraging. say 20 year age group said 20. Could lead = leading WEAR. A. MASK. friend wrong sub don‚Äôt want huge hyperbolic overreactions. Un-paywalled archive:  I'd look UK ongoing model delta interacts decently vaccinated population. overwhelmingly good scary news. Cases get high, unlikely going look like south. situation, believe possible? passing time prove vaccines efficacy? people trust vaccine this? people politicians stop politicizing science? think take bring us together move forward civilized manner? education? baby boomers die off? millennials need take life seriously? Gen X need get benzodiazepines? Vacations cost money, going concert costs money, hanging friends &amp; family cost money.

Do really see correlation capitalism there? Peru working pretty hard making lambda variant strongest one guess Murderers Denmark then? mandate mask public schools Denmark. (Only places public places require masks.).

Why? Well pandemic control here. Hospitals capacity, 71% vaccinated. likely get COVID sooner rather later, virus going disappear time soon. vaccinated prevent virus, still infect get infected.

I think comment huge overreaction. Ouch I‚Äôll search around article, sure kind research even ethical. using logic, hooked gas mask tank full covid think would develop breakthrough case?


I‚Äôm saying vaccines don‚Äôt work all, definitely do. don‚Äôt make people bullet proof. It‚Äôs case every vaccine. I‚Äôm vaccinated measles, injected syringe full Measles virus I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd become infected. would better chance fighting dying would still become infected. I've watching mom's group FB throw fit state going require vaccinations teachers they're going lose many ""wonderful teachers"".

....Welp, wonderful teachers said care get little Billy sick, really want around children? happened last year Delta thing we're probably boned Exactly, vaccinated people spreading virus like unvaccinated. what‚Äôs point?
Stop blaming projecting.

Vaccinated people also adding risk harming everyone around them, stop horse shit.
Your argument goes door.

People power decide themselves. health choice. could said ""we recommend booster 5-8 months, people higher risk get closer every 5 months (immunocompromised, comorbidities, advanced age) general population still able avoid severe infection closer 8 months"" make everyone eligible 5 months. People higher risk people worried transmission could go right 5 months, whereas people would wait 6-8. know gonna endemic meant everythings normal rona endemic country lockdowns anymore 65 percent infections asymptomatic people. Covid bad sick people stay indoors. year enough. going endemic concerning. figured hospitals northeast affected transfers states. Calling attendees limiting close friends family tested negative apparently means nothing what-about-ers. majority absolutely get vaccinated Dec Jan, first shots first group mid December, means got second late Dec early Jan, group 4, rest, majority people get first shots vast majority states til late Feb, early April. We've barely scratched surface kids. yes, gonna shit show, everything days Could lead to? We're already Delta represents roughly 97% sequenced cases New York. wave hit much possibly yet case growth hospitalizations falling. Please we've enough Im saying kids dont need vaccine, saying prioritizing getting global adults vaccinated giving virus time mutate thus prolonging pandemic everyone example Delta variant. deadly virus is, usually spreads less wanted gauge consensus someone get one variant either back back time?  Agree 100%. confused title means coronavirus over. ever really gonna people don‚Äôt vax? Generally dominate viruses strains become one less mortality. course would selective pressure it. Dead people can't spread virus thus virulence inherently hinders infection, take one virus make equally transmissible even slightly less virulent, *eventually* become dominant variant. larger difference virulence, quicker is. challenging convince people get third booster? think lot younger people hesitant time around. Thoughts? SHOTTTSSS YAYYYY Yep, incompetence proven we'd utterly fucked ever face much deadlier pandemic like one Contagion.   Depending mutations, faster virus replicates, faster consume cells body. Higher viral load lead severe symptoms. make stop need check out, specifically Act 2. comment replying correct. would even vaccine yet decades research sars/mers. Thanks info! maybe. certainly mine (Scotland) busy before.

We app shows number people entered building last hour, numbers covid. Kids dying delta. Kids get transmit Covid. Especially sending back school (which point kinda happen mental health sake). yeah, buying argument kids don‚Äôt need vaccinations.

The booster shot argument merit.  Right?! like people military, prison, hospital, anything like manage that. impossible human days discipline enough live. Sure, times great upheaval, humans necessary community country, we're different breed people. like people WW2, example. we're bunch whiney slackers who'd rather see world burn inconveniences while.  


Let eat death! That's right, eventually wiped out, world keep spinning. According Washington post test .3 percent 18 million sequenced like 51k (uk 7.4 percent). Tbh probably backed tests setting aside probably stuck warehouse Atlanta Working education, totally empathize situation... Lacking staff subs? everyone else cover add workload can't let minors unattended!

I wish paid us extra make extra duties... fair towards fault immune system god tier, spread related probably due us messing one way another (ebola sure, flu strains could well). think 8 months since date received second dose.

I better question though. poor reaction Moderna vaccine, want switch Pfizer booster.. I've read studies saying totally cool, might even beneficial receiving single source.. chances able select Pfizer booster? I'm hoping pretty good since first get FDA approval. Probably start happening booster-related approval granted FDA. thank you! Shingles next! mom PA CT (where things relatively stable now) hospital got patient freaking Oklahoma. post-covid blood clot find hospital bed anywhere. tried 15 states CT luck. rich countries playing make believe, giving boost/3rd shot. Well done, morons...

If still pretending necessary vaccined every country, time... wont end pandemic. Delta sending people hospitals, even 2 doses. matter 6 months got new strain invade today's vaccines, start killing matter many doses person got, restart shit again.

US, UE, Israel buying almost doses? Lefting rest world hold access vaccines again? Go vacantions couple months, removing need wear masks, allowing mass events...?

Until reality knock doors hospitals full again. tell beautiful lines ""we together issue"" etc? joke...  Absolutely, completely agree. It‚Äôs crucial part solution situation globally. article based preprint certified peer review [what mean?]. reports new medical research yet evaluated used guide clinical practice.  less one million chances severe side effects vaccines, almost cases treated resolved medical professionals. chance life threatening complications extremely low. Either way, sue FDA negative effects even approval. wanted sue anyone, would vaccine manufacturer, see FDA approval would affect all. talking incredibly low risk -- much dangerous take many OTC drugs like aspirin aleve, drive car. going absolute disaster. flu season going wait December January majority Americans got first second shots. added protection booster shot would invaluable September October, even 50-60+ going able get then. long it‚Äôs mutated delta‚Ä¶ Red herring.  How'bout fairness fact Covid deniers overwhelming healthcare system everyone simple, free proven solution prevent that??

Is ""fair"" everyone else road suffer 20% drivers decide ignore safety regulations, cost irresponsible bear? surprised views Healthcare all.

This covid related such. I'm wondering opinion. said anything controversial question obesity either. like variants ended burning quickly? 

Delta infectious deadly think fucking clue. Directly tracing cases hard demographic Sturgis attendees resistant contact tracing may even resistant testing, get sense impact Sturgis, cases COVID South Dakota really low, weeks following Sturgis, cases quintupled. That's South Dakota. People went Sturgis over, nearly 700K people attended. nation-wide impact estimated looking spike cases following insight UK? basically hovering around 30-35K cases quite bit decline. going much difficult impose another lockdown even lockdowns around world we've still seen virus spread (don't get wrong lockdowns helped doubt stop spread). Case point what's happening Australia New Zealand right now. They've done well especially NSW looks like slipping control. actually looking comment. IMHO right answer. think ranked like 40th world comes sequencing. can‚Äôt find something aren‚Äôt looking it. Virus gonna virus. conceived dose 1 2. Also anecdotal know MANY women conceived shortly doses.  problem shipping COVID vaccines logistical nightmare. already quite difficult distribute central locations. kept deep freeze, temperature monitored, chain-of-custody monitored, etc.

And, they're taken deep freeze, can't put back without potentially compromising viability. And, they're taken deep freeze, shelf life drops dramatically.

The reason clinics/pharmacies sending vaccines countries difficult, risky, and/or flat impossible.

It makes sense waste expired vaccine crank more, already infrastructure place distribute central locations. And, easily ensure they're safe viable.  2 variants! America \#1! Suck Eurotrash Meanwhile threw 80k expired vaccines dumbass state. goddamn infuriating. conscious force guiding evolution, it‚Äôs natural selection. though millions died, hasn‚Äôt even put dent world population. happening now. blame all. would admitting there's problem. Can't ppl afraid go spend money. Kids dont get sick dont spread much, grand scheme giving virus breeding ground mutate, giving kids West vaccines adults rest world increase vaccine coverage. dead... gusto! would help actually cared anti vaxxers.

But dont. 


I'll still wear mask, I'm social distancing I'm staying home. Depends entirely incubation period.

If walking around spewing virus particles two weeks start feeling sick, actually matter end sick go out. Yes, course schools open person class, least option. It‚Äôs pandering voters who‚Äôve embraced disinformation. That's idea yeah. Okie dokie. make China pay already? I‚Äôm tired dealing crap year. Something must done. Interesting. Thanks.  news?

Newsflash dense crowds unmasked unvaccinated people spread virus. urge everyone get vaccinated? Highlighting specific instances like encourage anti-vaxers get vaccinated, gives another opportunity misdirect attention. ‚ÄúObese people‚Äù. go-to argument line bs now.  Maybe I‚Äôm seeing it, saying 8 months first shot, second shot, second shot 2 weeks considered ‚Äúfully vaxxed‚Äù ? suggest anyone interested phenomenon read book Quiet. author details research people exhibit extroverted behaviors capable tricking society believing intelligent reality probably confident ignorance.  Surgeon General matter - nothing magical number,"" said U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. Rather, eight months judgment call vaccine protection severe illness might fall based direction current data.""We put best minds together administration, looked best data had. saw asignal,"" Murthy said. ""And sharing assessment public.""

Now I'm sure people going argue Israel data politics ""guesses"" CDC, personally recommend talk doctor medical decisions seriousness, take advice redditors. something like, vaccine, prevent this‚Ä¶

*Narrator: did. stupidity well.* Totally agree, choose pessimistic worst case keeps happening. Though think rabies (and matter tb) optimistic example. one choose HIV, smallpox syphilis. Person‚Äôs sat thumbnail FIFTY NINE percent. factors like long presymptomatic period short amount time required exposure result infection, there's whole lot selective pressure COVID become less virulent/deadly.

Delta virulent previous strains, seeing deaths hospitalizations would go along vaccinations. places lucky.  Named place first spotted dependent much sequencing done. Guidance nomenclature diseases named people, places animals (this bird flu, swine flu MERS). went right ton medical infrastructure States, probably many older people. Unfortunately, none us receiving preventative care, even urgent care need. things would completely fallen apart now.  point natural immuunity better second dose delta someone else stated Good analysis. literally safe ever be. There‚Äôs reason scared given listed precautions. take way way mutations. It'll happen years likely decades now, we'll updated boosters recent preliminary data shows fraction vaccinated get infected (50% far off, think around 5-10% depending immunization campaign began) get infected, high viral loads (which unvaccinated day 5) lowering much faster unvaccinated, also quite high viral loads contain much less infectious virions (there paper out, probably many virions already bound existing antibodies).

So means fraction gets infected, (much less contagious = viable virions) viral loads lower shorter interval thus also infect others (maybe unvaccinated) much unvaccinated would do. great reduction possibilities virus mutate. 

Another paper showed countries high vaccination rates much lower rate single point mutations circulating variants countries low rates. exactly basing on? numbers every published source showing 6 months somehow justify booster yet? seems like they're saying even 70-80% effectiveness severe disease yet low enough need booster. That's good. Israel 5 months. can't agree seeing 6 months severe disease effectiveness drop 70s multiple sources saying 'Hey, let's wait two months top that!'... earth thinking? Like 5/6/8 make one iota difference antivaxxers. evidence vaccine? odds myocarditis 5 times higher getting virus getting vaccine, totally depends odds getting virus say whether actually smart health decision take vaccine. taking vaccine gives 100% chance getting risks getting vaccine, get risks getting Covid actually get Covid.

If less 20% chance getting Covid, taking vaccine gives higher chance getting myocarditis taking (using 5 times number, actual numbers may vary). parts country odds getting Covid long term less 20%? Sure.   Uh no. speaks fact keeping kids home another year absolutely deleterious development. places Europe kept schools open pandemic vaccine even.

Other countries, outside Canada Germany think haven‚Äôt cut checks citizens pandemic. also single-payer healthcare/=/universal healthcare, like 5 countries single-payer healthcare reddit can‚Äôt grasp whatever reason, continues annoy healthcare research previous job.  I'll try snick one 5-6 months anyway, data Israel quite compelling. Doses getting thrown away anyway.  helpful information, thanks lot! One better posts I've seen while. actually thought Science Magazine could considered peer reviewed journal perhaps not.

My followup question peer review - previously thought authors names hidden peer review (the link provided said well) researchers names listed preprint. Could preprint introduce bias peer review process reviewers also happened see preprint? Lol.

In India central govt doesn‚Äôt count deaths cause.It‚Äôs left state governments.  Someone hired Matt Baker apparently that, proposed mechanism significantly suspect. Allegedly fertility claim genetic similarity syncytin-1 (a vital protein attaching uterus) covid spike protein associated mRNA vaccines.

Even true (it's not), would vaccine cause issue, covid infection? situations, body generally producing immunity spike protein.  clearly idiot. want listen shit everyday constantly masks vaccine. topic today corona,vacciness masks. fuck that. I'd love talk something else rather this.  know. It‚Äôs hard spot she‚Äôs in. She‚Äôs idiot emotion worry overwhelming. She‚Äôs early 40s, failed IVF several times, finally got pregnant she‚Äôs terrified losing baby getting another chance. 4 year old needs too. hate pandemic. says she‚Äôs pretty sure vax didn‚Äôt cause miscarriages, said she‚Äôd never forgive miscarried getting would always blame decision. least she‚Äôd alive! Ugh. terrible every story read worries even more.  New variant found America, mutated use guns kill infected. We've given people much slack society, drive find ""oppression"" victims of, they're literally becoming terrorists.

Like ok great.. care call us.. crack now? Would could agree especially someone trust. 

My sister side fence me, shes vaccinated, wears mask, intends get kids vaccinated can; they're 12. dad opposed it. says kids getting vaccinated. Shes told plans getting vaccinated, it'll fight sure, outrightly refuse take get vaccinated. 

I hope goes smoothly you, soon able relief knowing there's degree protection children. Dad lie get shot, route willing go. tried calling pharmacies, asking get booster legitimately due conditions (he 71 Diabetes Parkinson's, meet criteria immunocompromised currently). said qualify, can't get booster 8 months second dose, day sooner. got second shot Pfizer end March, wait end November, Delta raging while. problem definitive data said safe then, really seem to. contrary, data suggests may well case, efficacy wanes 5 months large margin (my Dad passed 5 months boot). go Doctor next week, going ask booster there, expect answer much local pharmacies. I'm scared right now, feels like CDC whoever charge booster strategy know they're point. general, say. really mean make conversation much deeper was. get impression looking avenues poke school religious orientation that's conversation want you. own, say, comes beliefs. 

What saying, again: People go still mock schools conservative tactics life. massive school sure known beyond SW Virginia around world. still points really intended push responding comments here. keep throwing fuel fire otherwise. know got little long winded apologize. Personally, think school's growth literally impressive.

That hire someone went school religious association would someone went school known partying, greek life, sports program business. never intended ask it. personal Virgnia school rankings. But, Cool!

Of course, anyone would prefer hire person went rigorous school particular relevant profession job offering, certainly alone there. make mental note also one people too. 

Best luck interviewing!   Sturgis gets half million people.  mind think kids remote another year.

I supported keeping schools closed vaccine came teachers last year. support keeping schools closed vaccine approved kids 12 year. virus continue mutate students continue shift back forth due quarantines comprehensive public health effort along lines undertaken. support vaccine mandates students teachers. consistent positions minimizing death, spread, long CoVID symptoms kids. ‚Äúfringe‚Äù position speaks volumes allergic country getting ahead problem. in-person instruction thankfully fringe position 

No in-person instruction positivity rate 10% locally.

No in-person instruction hospitals importing nurses state sounds reasonable me. 

No in-person instruction counties regions ICU beds seems like fair metric. 

No in-person instruction month state orders mobile morgues, that‚Äôll really work Florida Texas. rather, might have, point pandemic committed specific course action enforced regulations/incentives/consequences instead laissez-faire survivalism. countries didn‚Äôt pay people. That‚Äôs false.

Which countries millions families evicted Delta surge? tell me. I‚Äôm curious.

Also, every single country form universal single-payer healthcare last eighteen months profitable health insurance industry. simple pay raise enough fix this. Hospital CEOs incentivized hire nurses possible name minimizing expenses. result, nurses spread way thin many patients time. lead high rates burnout subsequently, high rate turnover nursing industry. many 1/5 nurses leave bedside nursing within first year work. could somehow reduce average nurse patient ratio, may able attract nurses industry. Auckland 8-9 hour waits He's extremely overweight well probably vaccinated. That's dire.  Source? think horrors war way worse somewhat increased isolation, worrying health loved ones financial stress. latter bad people trying best kill kill people levels bad.

Personally really missed able give parents hug saw first time 20 months couple weeks ago like would ever weekend fighting war jungle, it? Yes. Switching careers less year two. see time. Baseball/football games 40k fans happen daily require vaccines testing lead big outbreaks.  Well first booster considered soon 5 months (which data seems support). there's good reason believe unless even worse variant pops up, immunity last longer booster, body see common threat. That's many vaccines long intervals (sometimes years) last lifetime, decades. Thank much! Julie fabulous! She‚Äôs gone like 20k 40k views videos 3 6 years ago millions now. right time travel thing. I'll never understand people concerned myocarditis result vaccination seem unaware myocarditis significantly likely Covid infections mRNA vaccines. 4 times likely across age ranges. data exists younger males (those susceptible myocarditis), one study colleges aged athletes seems indicated possibly orders magnitude people adding 'e' that, something like 'embarazade'. Well, taking account Japan done jack shit control pandemic numbers good even hard explain. Got booster US (Floriduh) third shot similar 2nd. 36 hours body ache fever night sweats better. think worked went concert small venue almost one masks ( did) it‚Äôs 4 days sick yet. Exactly, kids majority people there. smokers often low 90%.  would argue poor NZ too. reason vaccine drive slow running stocks point. happened NZ's vaccine procurement? Didnt start way this? Well, suffer terribly first two. bit tired day less. First time, headache tired, second time arm pain tired. mean, there's reason radically different booster. it‚Äôs gonna real tough put 14yr old boosters. 2 days 2nd Pfizer shot woke 3AM complaining Chest Pain , difficulty breathing‚Ä¶that scared crap me. went ER EKG blood work done , elevated CRP luckily everything else fine. Still scary want safe hope doesn‚Äôt reaction Good luck getting trust anything much effort made destroy trust. virus' best trump card. Rather changing protein spike (which difficult do), simply learning replicate faster vaccine robust immune systems counter it. 


This breakthrough cases increased. vaccines still work, stop virus quickly previous variants. 


It's like constant Dragon Ball Power level battle, opponent exponentially stronger last good guys get power boost (vaccine booster) counter overwhelm them. Hopefully, pandemic saga ends soon. I‚Äôm glad Scottish Government it‚Äôs advisers changed tone deal this. wasn‚Äôt long ago wanted zero covid policy thankfully realised impossible can‚Äôt go back lockdown 90% population vaccinated. Cool. 

All saying people go reasons too! mean take conversation much perhaps drug bit much there. go even mock school's strict conservative tactics. uncommon. massive school lot going on. Even built shady ground, haha. argue there.

For mental records though, Jerry Fallwell founded school. He's super religious generally known stand guy. issue vision school, long hating religious affiliations. 

That Kevin Roose article Jerry Fallwell Jr. son far sinister persona. Though family alike name, different. Jr. one part sex scandal, alcoholic kingpin shady money empire, construction company real estate company.  understand it‚Äôd slap face; kids innocent easily influenced, kids love. mom feel?

I know dad vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt issue get son vaccinated. Lmao u still give fuck Covid REALLY need get life.  people getting shots lying, others asking doctor recommend booster due medical history. father may options. freedom choice needlessly risk safety. reason can't make personal choice driving wasted fine.

You get *choose* infect me. agree people working samples best can, can‚Äôt dismiss abysmal response. Even Fauci called ‚Äúsomewhat inexcusable deficiency‚Äù. plus side read somewhere biden going inject funds increase rate. course pessimist heart respect optimistic outlook. anybody Israel already received booster shot share experience it? side effects worse comparable first two shots?

What embarrassment.  like speaks paid attention memory holeing everything.  People already according news stories. live U.S., pharmacies surplus Covid shots wide-spread vaccine hesitancy. nurse gave flu shot week ago told turn away showed get booster Covid shot Sept. 20 throw away shots expiring end work day would prefer put willing arms instead. could try get booster near you. worst thing happen they'll ask come back later.  nieces dad way. binge watches tic tok covid conspiracies. told flu, God gave immune system protect you. felt like someone punched chest told this, way tell people raise kids, that's niece nephew hes telling lies to. 

I worked third shift remote learning kids last year sister could work kids go school person. year slap face hear that. 

Fortunately school district mask mandate also upgraded HVAC system replace air within CDC guideline appreciate much.   Look by-age groups. 94% over-50s vaccinated. look under-50s comparing under-20 unvaccinated 30-50 age group vaccinated. tremendous number cases under-20 unvaccinated people almost mortality what's driving cases CFR UK. Vaccination factor 13 mortality risk; that's small compared age risk factors.

Are seriously arguing vaccination reduce death around 93%? matter kids still can‚Äôt vaccinated unfortunately sickest last 3-4 years second dose. manageable home standard arsenal OTC meds lots rest. 

That said, I‚Äôm necessarily willing continue getting shots short timeline doses. top that, scientists also [dont seem necessity boosters. ever look 'perfect use' vs 'typical use' rates birth control methods? difference pretty substantial.

The way see use condom wrong sex, somehow people get wrong still claim use them.  mind think kids remote another year. Mandate vaccines teachers masks kids person instruction thankfully fringe position.

And countries didn‚Äôt pay people. That‚Äôs false. Leaving what? Going back school go choose different career? wear masks

Not single student wears N95 teach wealthy district. Cloth masks, neoprene masks, masks valves, novelty sports masks (Cowboys/Mavericks/Rangers/Stars), masks. single quality mask found.

There nothing done address brutal air quality HVAC/indoor ventilation systems schools. gets colder, indoor transmission schools number one driver. Hospital capacity already stretched thin; hospital staff cannot asked keep Herculean efforts much longer. Burnout real. want keep schools virtual surge make lives easier. 

Kids socially distance, even mandated never mean *never* enforced. mean, socializing biggest benefit kids in-person school, actual face-to-face instruction (as kids laptops class regardless). 

You say ‚Äúthese things happen‚Äù, enforced. teacher vaccine mandate enforced, like masks enforced, like quarantine enforced, like distancing enforced. 

There enforcement without incentives (cash stimulus) threats (firing teachers, detention suspension students). Neither ever present local let alone regional national level. 

Again, focused producing proliferating quality masks children point pandemic. remember ‚Äúkids need see smile‚Äù argument last year. it‚Äôs ‚Äúwell, 1-2% kids get hospitalized, what‚Äôs big dangerous children

That‚Äôs true delta variant - even were, **long COVID symptoms devastating child‚Äôs learning curve**. CoVID fog, fatigue, - [if recent research - 3-7 point drop IQ significant symptoms.

From previously coronavirus found harder complete tasks related **reasoning, problem-solving, spatial planning**, authors said. Researchers controlled age, education, overall mood.

Are saying noticeable decreases reasoning, problem solving, spatial planning capacity children ‚Äúnot dangerous‚Äù kids? I‚Äôll concede they‚Äôre *lethal* side effects, kid depending education (not socialization) ticket like did, developments like absolutely dangerous current future prospects. Rich parents afford tutors therapy, poor kids struggling families fall wayside. 

Do conflate ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù ‚Äúlethal‚Äù. dangers long CoVID students us decades. lethality, hopefully, subside kids vaccinated. then? in-person school curve comes down.

Oh wait, Labor Day weekend coming up. Schools 100% open families get back vacations football games airports similar gatherings. might make sense close schools two weeks prevent level inevitably astronomical community spread.

Nope! Delta variant isn‚Äôt dangerous unvaccinated kids, says /u/Rick_Flair_Jr. Oh definitely. SAGE draft said 1% folks covid get LC severe permanently labor pool terrifying simply fact burning youngest members society. believe America set low bar seems care hospitalization, infection. cared infection, 8 months wouldn‚Äôt discussed know vaccines shit infection far out. 

Even wife develop long covid problems (I really hope not!), you‚Äôd still considered success didn‚Äôt go hospital. 

Low bar. Complete bullshit. I‚Äôve always playing getting infected since hospitalization risk already low.  believe follow question, let know doesn‚Äôt address it. One variant COVID may spike proteins higher efficiency cell entry, yes, spike proteins one variant same. Efficiency cell entry one way look well. Another way increase infection could rate virus deliver ‚Äòpayload‚Äô cell. example, P681R mutation promotes spike protein activation lowering energy barrier needed furin (TMPRSS2) enzyme operate.

""Zero COVID"" strategy failed many countries since Delta arrived. Plenty countries Asia wonderful 2020, even Q1 2021. Look Vietnam, Thailand, New Zealand, Korea, etc. New Zealand lasted longest, cat bag well.

Vaccines way out. accept deaths plenty cases arise. Lockdowns targeting zero COVID wasted effort Delta. 

As Scotland, guys 7 day avg. 6 deaths per day. Call \~200 deaths per month. population 5.4M people. July, 2021 4890 deaths Scotland (total, causes). 200/4890 = \~4% deaths COVID. 

You lock something like that. vaccine job. can't expect COVID disappear. criminal, be. includes school curriculum. students behind learning, unless half student population gets COVID, going keep muscling school year make even got COVID make work long end ICU dead. prevent infections would easy put mask mandate, got many asshole parents people would block route. didn‚Äôt know Russia part us Thx info They‚Äôre convinced hospitals calling every death Covid-related regardless actual cause. Also think old people comorbidities really risk.  Well one positive this, one reasons isn‚Äôt due alien DNA super microchips! can't move agree 5-6 month science recommendation FDA blessed anything yet. FDA footdragging determines schedule. FDA old-farts peacetime army. need wartime army. Fauci ahead announcements weeks whole time. I'm guessing knows emergency use approval kids right around corner. Breaking news: Sky Blue.

So COULD get booster Christmas, I'd really shitty Christmas. come hotel quarantine breaches latest one flight crew infecting limo driver. took isolated case spread NSW, Vic NZ. special ""long term damage"" associated COVID. relatively normal post-viral infection symptoms. especially true kids, resistant COVID first place.   come early October change guidance 6 months. evidence points 6 months want people get booster need new one February northern states would still potential winter wave. CDC would rather lie explain public health reason like masks. Detailed appreciation physical reminders appreciation, non-hostile environment, enjoyable coworkers, understanding boss ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è seeing someone congratulate local hospitals hospitalizations going down. 

They clearly see refrigerated trucks parked back. Like bruh, everyone went home. üò¨

Our county still releasing Covid deaths data. remember reading supply nearly much issue now. could probably get everyone boosted Christmas really wanted to. tell painfully obvious pure lies profession understand all, like basic aspects it.. God. thought courage removing headphone jack iPhone. Yeah could problem cause people think term vaccine assume they're fully immune got vaccine hear yes got shot still transmit carry makes feel like what's point getting vaccine fully protecting transmitting others. Delta ran course vaccines wonderful thing. got whole shipment third party making vaccine. literally freedoming death. Right are, thought odds seemed awfully low. sound like someone lost friends family this.

I'm happy you. numbers add up. says 50,000 died July, gives exact number 50,140. says 5800 died directly covid, 4200 covid contributed deaths 1500 covid contribute deaths 11,500.  Even hindsight don‚Äôt blame him, even think wrong. country pretty good months mask mandate went away, unvaccinated wouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated, vaccinated people wouldn‚Äôt wait indefinitely. Even it‚Äôs mostly safe vaccinated (and don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs going get safer long term), it‚Äôs unvaccinated filling hospitals. make official alternate spelling. want people fully covered booster winter surge. start people October/Nov instead people antibodies April.

If people rush probably get surge February/March spring weather hits. Paxton literally looks like two injuries face. ‚ÄúYou currently need tall vaccinated, need lower that.‚Äù know many second degree contacts got Covid, deaths.

Only know one half first degree contacts got it, middle aged got flu-level symptoms. Mask question..... looking new masks one Honeywell says ""The insert shown third-party testing facility block 97% 3 micron-sized non-viable particles 0.1-micron-sized aerosolized particles."" anyone help understand difference significance 3.0 micron sized non-viable vs 0.1 micron sized aerosolized particles? 3 microns 30 times size 0.1. That's big difference size. first thought meant 0.3 doubled check 3.0. particle ""non-viable"" would imply matter? Yep  said cases meaningless. guess want people protection throughout winter surge. shot gives \~5-6 months protection people get they'd protection Jan-February

If hold people get October-Nov they'd protection March/April winter surge started tapering off.  Serious question. covid enter Australia draconion travel restrictions? conducting trials new formulas, booster doses original vaccines look highly effective delta well, likely favoured since already approved. Exactly. They‚Äôre actually lying ones survey. aren‚Äôt getting vaccine they‚Äôre making sort political point. middle massive teacher shortage. kid's school three third grade teachers normally, one quit virtual school, one quit vaccines, teachers take place, cool kid class sixty one teacher? reality am. 

Could recruit? Sure, that's happening time school starts point. Sorry bout  valid point March, September. got fucking knocked IUD uterus, chilling proper location. Yes. think ok. point, going eradicate covid - everyone get it. choices face covid excellent safety protection vaccine, face without. absolutely question risk posed covid much much much higher risk associated vaccination. pandemic end everyone antibodies, one path get comes many hundreds thousands unnecessary deaths, permanent disability, billions dollars spent care critically ill people. path prefer? think obvious anybody that's paying attention. patience could easily avoid going hospital vaccine shot. unvaccinated get hospital complain everything. blame nurse sick shit? Let's even touch fact hospitals treating nurse like shit?  I'm saying call something different use accurate verbiage vs blanket statement ""vaccine"" there's different versions virus like Flu, yes get vaccinated one strain different one, think called something different one type vaccine chickenpox smallpox typhoid see variant smallpox typhoid hep a, b. Like many breakthrough cases see someone getting hepatitis receiving vaccine those, smallpox chickenpox. think sort booster type shot like get one flu called something else vs saying vaccine look dictionary stand point. worse drunk driving. truly believe trying get unvaccinated kids infected. else could explain recklessness. quarantine infected? Worldometer put 1M cumulative cases March 1.3M cumulative cases currently. Last week 60k cases 2020 worst year life. mental health went downhill quick. smoking weed time made shit worst head. getting cannabis induced psychosis. top that, knew virus spreading quick &amp; people dying left &amp; right numbers kept going up. Friends, family, &amp; losing jobs. noticed people's mental health around going downhill too. really sad &amp; depressing. alone here. I've lost ton friends family since started. due political stance going crazy rabbit holes. fell touch lockdowns refusal get vaccinated. point I'm literally 1 person talk regularly.

It‚Äôs helped get all. believe life one, but......I wanna keep one going bit, too. actually worse, learned chose exact opposite. like ignored covid, purposely helping covid policies create.

If nothing said nothing, state would better shape. Since vaccines infection ways gain immunity Covid forever, measures merely delay inevitable infections. see use areas danger hospital collapse, don‚Äôt see endgame spots high vaccine uptake hospitals busy critical danger. point, outbreak within worksite year 2 global pandemic isn‚Äôt mortal sin business perspective.

Not mention, refunding 60,000+ fans game ticket, forfeiting 1/17th tv contract?? think they‚Äôd play 5 5 Thats even whole story. Cases concentrated southern provinces, worse looks.  RCCX theory phenotype

what this? patternsons stuff? It‚Äôs coordinated. Things aren‚Äôt always exactas seems.   makes sense. would disagree whether health immune system make difference outcome covid. looks pretty much like unknown, can't tell whether react strongly virus.

And correct implying correlation two, I'm trying make simple rule thumbs ppl hesitant bewildered evolving information. Definitely tune Dont kid yourself, india way worse. America worst shape last year still better india months ago no, see post above.  study years years make important decisions patient's care, , kinda right paid more. Ive met awful physicians amazing ones. lot nurses I've met amazing too. Theyre one breed, say I'm disappointed number anti-vax nurses says something comparable education qualifications.   It‚Äôs almost like‚Ä¶ instead blaming unvaccinated invest medical infrastructure better handle crisis? Warm ventilators folks! Oh strange, I‚Äôm risk group either I‚Äôm already vaccinated. I‚Äôve seen expats getting vaccinated lately, even getting Pfizer rather AstraZeneca. Triage already happening. Unvaccinated patients sicker less likely survive, lower list without making vaccination obvious choice. Even I'm fully vaccinated, can't grow COVID anxiety. It'd probably gone way done end cases, Delta surgings well vaccinated countries making hope sink. virus contagious chicken pox, possibly serious, vaccines fully stop infections anti-vaxxers exist (and people avoid masks general).

Also - fit RCCX theory phenotype? Condolences loss. friend similar situation you, frustrating see self-destruction preventable. better question is: *when* pandemic over? supposedly work right? work protect worry?

It's hypocritical mindset masks vaccines.  work, still mask. Masks work still worried others masking. 

The issue masking people wear masks touch putting on, touch sanitize hands touching anything else. great multiple deaths domestic vaccines nurses probably vaccinated too, although point think you‚Äôre trying make-that docs likely vaccinated-is probably correct.

That‚Äôs neither fact medicine particularly hierarchical physicians notoriously sensitive pay, especially bad long, steady increase nursing salaries. immune system

Yikes. governor. Anyone know abhorrent sins New Orleans guilty warrants disaster unfold? 

Folks like parents tend rationalize devastating natural disasters punishment God, God's mysterious challenged devout believers and/or children die events.

I understand it. unvaccinated father thinks hoax, vaccinated mother knows real, believes punishment humanity sins transgender tolerance.

Harris said politicized nature debate COVID-19 policies made hard cut noise times.

‚ÄúI think single challenging thing facts don‚Äôt win argument sometimes even times,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúPeople tend pick whichever facts want supports whatever already going believe anyway.‚Äù

Harris trusts research behind COVID-19 vaccines hopes help convince others. he‚Äôs respectful doubts getting shots.

‚ÄúThere lots people lots reasonable questions ideas need explore information want obtain make decision,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs perfectly reasonable. So, we‚Äôre trying explain people see evidence vaccines, think safety effectiveness them.‚Äù

My mother works hospital Houston, amongst first get vaccinated even became mandatory thing doesn‚Äôt even work ICU. We‚Äôre baffled schools teach unvaccinated children medical workers getting vaccines.    fact basically like...in panic here...because European Pfizer facilities able ship us doses (and Biden became president, receiving vaccines USA) - month later completely flooded vaccines - amazing me, especially almost vaccine production capabilities past conservative governments decimated past. Everyone willing able (medically age wise) lining get it. We're basically waiting &lt;12 year old people get approved confidently reopen schools get back normal.

With two doses, viral loads high (I think they're still like x300 WT covid without vaccine?) there's ton opportunity immune-escape variants selected for.

Glad hear KC school good kids disabilities. ever children live KC one day I‚Äôll take school there. impossible, unless think 5% 0-17 got COVID expected, 0-17 data looks low put context fatalities age group. Less 5,500 school age kids die year US‚Ä¶ causes. would pretty illogical. anything, taken two shots fine makes confident getting third.

That said, I‚Äôm suggesting people generally logical. doesn't. need 85-90% vaccination stop fucker. I'm teacher Oregon upload CDC card verification yesterday, least something.  Theoretically, risk infecting others rather minimal vaccinated, asymptomatic, using protective equipment hospitals have. Eventually mutation might make risky test, think we're yet.

If anyone symptoms, probably home. COVID, still something might pass onto patients. bother, people bothering test now?

Lmao wut.

You work testing site you? literally gave birth late February 2020, news mysterious new virus decimating crewmembers passengers aboard Diamond Princess Cruise Ship top headline. think even name news articles yet. hospital advising excess young visitors due ""flu season"". home newborn became pandemic, gosh, rollercoaster navigating beautiful innocent child tow. still pray things get better, shit really weird 2020/2021...

If Covid gets herd immunity levels, 10% school aged children fatalities. personally observed large group vaxxed behave exact way. don‚Äôt blame though doctor UCI told offering 3rd shots last week though. even offer write prescription. get mine CVS guarantee become less deadly, guarantee immunity vaccines last.

\-Proudly double vaccinated February 2021 try smear anti-vax lunatic. like want virus stop spreading! Inconceivable! OP Nurses doctors, much pretend know better. ‚Äúthey‚Äù, OP trying say vaccines working, enough?

Because former bullshit probably downvoted, latter actually probably true. need get people vaxxed, *and* need go back masking high risk scenarios. distancing. just... avoiding high risk scenarios (like nightclubs, indoor concerts, etc) entirely. 30% tinfoil. good chunk 30% unvaccinated would children 12 yet eligible vaccines. us place great value entirety health, even we‚Äôre worried dying. avoiding nearly costs: reduced lung capacity, chronic fatigue, altered taste smell (or loss thereof), brain damage/lowered IQ, etc.

Abstract: 
Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) infection safety concern vaccine strategies. recent publication, Li et al. (Cell 184 :4203‚Äì4219, 2021) reported infection-enhancing antibodies directed N-terminal domain (NTD) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein facilitate virus infection vitro, vivo. However, study performed original Wuhan/D614G strain. Since Covid-19 pandemic dominated Delta variants, analyzed interaction facilitating antibodies NTD variants. Using molecular modeling approaches, show enhancing antibodies higher affinity Delta variants Wuhan/D614G NTDs. show enhancing antibodies reinforce binding spike trimer host cell membrane clamping NTD lipid raft microdomains. stabilizing mechanism may facilitate conformational change induces demasking receptor binding domain. NTD also targeted neutralizing antibodies, data suggest balance neutralizing facilitating antibodies vaccinated individuals favor neutralization original Wuhan/D614G strain. However, case Delta variant, neutralizing antibodies decreased affinity spike protein, whereas facilitating antibodies display strikingly increased affinity. Thus, ADE may concern people receiving vaccines based original Wuhan strain spike sequence (either mRNA viral vectors). circumstances, second generation vaccines spike protein formulations lacking structurally-conserved ADE-related epitopes considered.

Note: another recept paper supporting theory experiments: link paper authors refer to: used original title support quite sensationalist question authors state here. ADE comes play would affect recovered people too, vaccinated. AI probably consider humanity ""non essential"" future.  Nobody going in-person school, people keeping kids home away others. they're likely exposed, there's still vax them. Logically, kids going get sick. failed math class huh? I‚Äôll take one please sucks. Anyway, guys tonight? fair, fetuses. someone to;dr? words used head. lowly technologist, here. over. 

If looking biased info support decision get vaccinated, bother following links. care likely choose understand anyway.

I think that's one reasons, anti-vaxxer cohorts want give stupid pseudo scientific rhetoric.

It kinda gives ""moral (immoral) 'perceived power' thinking ""superior"" ""stronger"" compared ones get vaccinated.

For lack better word, might suffering kind inferiority complex chauvinism, results nonsensical behavior - characteristics might well sharing close 'flat-earthers' cousins.

Denying science gives ""high"". actually read psychological research phenomenon, can't find paper. Hodling helped. Bats rats similar besides wings. TWiV team explains Biden report SARS-CoV-2 origins not: evidence virus came Nature, lab; reveals new coronaviruses rodents inhabit populated areas southern China. completely forgotten we're still fighting pandemic? Hospitals already struggling going help. Malta Portugal around mid 85% vaccinated. 

Unfortunately herd immunity yet kick in, think matter time. Agree everything. like wrote that. Got sneaky booster 2 weeks ago well Countries like Hong Kong Singapore world class health care hardly taxes. 

I think must another issue Ireland. 

Just speaking guesses here, maybe Irish hospitals rely much taxes funding maybe enough private hospitals help ease load public ones. saw one coming? Sounds like complacency me. it‚Äôs help, supposed fly event Midwest. pulmonologist was/is leader fighting covid NYC said flying masks safe. would short two hour flight. said go people wearing masks indoors, going, aren‚Äôt wearing masks.

It‚Äôs also well known fact number 30 essentially impossible derive kind statistical conclusion on. think Valneva one moment, least Europe. [Valneva recently started submitting data UK (UK ordered 100m doses vaccine), though likely won‚Äôt data need approval early Q4 2021.

Yet inane fear masks, vaccines, etc....what conundrum. ...to surprise absolutely one (with brain). Flu coronaviruses exist animal reservoirs, cannot fully eliminated.

Smallpox, Polio, Measles amongst viruses known animal reservoir, means theoretically vaccinate enough people, eradicate diseases. able smallpox, close polio measles idiot antivaxxers screwed recent years. Fyi RSV, COVID Ok, sorry. misread post. agree using Lollapalooza argument \_for\_ Sturgis completely idiotic. said, Lollapalooza least everything power (except cancelling course), Sturgis nothing like.

I still think early event Lollapalooza. Even superspreader event known feels like big risk. heard you, apologize. what, 2 4? really happening ? 

It‚Äôs hard tell serious is. much happening Afghanistan ( thanks Biden, idiot ). news barely talking it.  say I've worst things happen myself, one event really messed me.

The important thing patience able forgive yourself. easier said done least. Also aware negative emotions learning deal better. Learning coping mechanisms work etc.

It takes time kinda sucks though. say I'm completely issues. Stuff still sticks around bit. crippling anymore. Wow, that‚Äôs vivid description. Sounds really nightmarish. find reports somewhere? I've seariching arround clearly good enough? doctors visited basically said connection bullshit.

Did research live virusses could trigger immoresponse thus trigger reumatic episodes. normally pfizer vaccine mrna non life vaccine trigger it. guessing tenured

There's reason many people anti-union Still, can't convince population, become dictatorship get things done. That's why, even though support vaccination got myself, I'm strongly government forcing people it. principle thing, sometimes sticking principles negative effects(for example, sometimes real criminal scumbag gets large payment justice system legal hiccup sentencing whatever - negative effect pay keep justice system fair all).

Basically, democracy can't convince people good thing, suck pay price democracy's wellbeing.

Edit: fully support right within system free speech advocate disbelief frustration people consider right thing.  Agreed!

I'm teacher CA. upstairs school windows, masks removed point eat drink. zero distancing.

Everyone wearing mask actively eating drinking, though. 

I got sneaky booster shot feel pretty safe again, personally, general risk significant. ""extremely effective"" virological term hyperbole? I've seen thrown around since start, clear warning sign I'm get disappointed. also know. I'd definitely prefer Denmark's even Korea's.

What would do/advise situation? Better question...**what went right**?

So think people necessarily *lying*, think might really believe that, naive brain body works, probably realise already late. article says : ""Hospitals **generally** allow one two visitors per patient, long go screening process asks symptoms exposure Covid-19."" look Singapore UK vaccination/natural immunity coverage then. &lt;12s main drivers infection countries  bunch obese, likely diabetic, sweaty, dusty ass 50-something‚Ä¶.

Israel 62% total population vaccinated, another 12% people testing positive COVID (74%).

Rough math know level cases won‚Äôt captured there‚Äôs overlap breakthrough cases, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs published.

I think it‚Äôs little early make statement ‚Äúherd immunity likely going achieved even high vaccination rates.‚Äù Unless point ‚Äúwith high % vaccination rates initial two course regiment.‚Äù

80% initial estimate. look viruses/diseases worlds seen success inoculations, thresholds coverage upwards 85% - 93%.

Accounting variables - much vaccination coverage Israel truly have, front campaign seeing waning immunity others still getting first shots? pace rollout? slow start we‚Äôre seeing impacts of. 

There‚Äôs absolute mountain variables this, think statement bit premature. bad nurse huh UK: called NHS said 8 week interval regardless vaccine. true? That's unfortunate. forget none numbers include tourists either. agree anti vax folks aren‚Äôt smart can‚Äôt blame possibility variant rest world vaccinated.

The USA talking boosters throwing vaccines away people know Thailand would kill shots.  It‚Äôs worse countries Africa. Maybe people worried variants focus vaccinating fucking want Neighbor couple (young 20 y.o., healthy) covid (deep coughing ). walk hallways apartment bldg masks on. Seems like treating like cold -- coming going, visitors. CLUELESS! covid ain't ending america year soon. It‚Äôs almost September now. Hence emphasis last line quote. 

Delta R0 roughly seven (R0 basic reproduction number; measure infectiousness. case, means one person will, average, infect seven people). makes infectious Ebola, SARS, smallpox -- quite contagious.

The basic rule evolution get crowded competing organism better 1) reproducing 2) getting resources are. Delta, evolutionarily speaking, ***very*** successful 'organism'.

So leave imagine variant going out-compete Delta. I'd say 'dumb' Occam's razor here. article says put bets Astra Zeneca vaccine manufacturing capability Oz.  Since then, following publicised concerns, they‚Äôve said it‚Äôs 60s don‚Äôt alternative. I'm glad Denmark realizing virus endemic live it. live state 75% population one dose cities back wearing masks public again. hospitals overwhelmed deaths still low considering almost 7 million people. disease endemic countries need realize this. Maybe mutated kinder gentler Covid way (Sweden) problem 18-24 year olds feel affect therefore can't bothered get vaccine. group still 70%. talk creating modified vaccines specially variants last read fizzled enough need i.e. existing vaccines effective enough. obviously contrast people saying take third shot. lot doctors scientists confused whole third shot Personally love zero covid policy Hong Kong! article mentioned someone 50yo got sick died, health issues. included photo said 50yo. clearly obese, common comorbidity.

Ps: sorry mom! It‚Äôs unprecedented Florida. No, directly. different vaccines previous infections may provide much protection expect. say 80% new infections among 20% population. theory recent wave based primarily change people's behaviors schools reopening combination infectious variant. Basically 20% population unvaccinated vulnerable needed right combination events get together exposed. reads like giving country heads concern plan mitigating spread. Maybe I'm missing something....  That‚Äôs works. Making vaccines ain‚Äôt like making clothing. South Africa, guys already gave us variant, don‚Äôt need another didn‚Äôt take hold like delta mean headline article ""*is poised* acquire complete resistance"" much thing already resistant, plenty studies showing existing vaccines work well known variants including Delta, South African, etc. Maybe virus interracial couple they'd take seriously tough years‚Ä¶I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre getting healthy way. would easy escape destructive way, stakes high right now.

What‚Äôs problem? go store week, another trip every weeks pet supplies. sit front yard weather nice occasionally go hiking. people really care visit mom sister I'll see brother comes I'm mom cancer heart condition visit often maybe I'm afraid give covid. Even though vaccinated I'm sure well immune system responded play safe. Honestly I'm much happier now. Japan weirdest rollout vaccine situation. feel essential workers can't isolate go work everyday. rough can't get vaccine months trying. Guess what? Vaccinated people contagious like unvaccinated, argument goes door.

Whos side anyways? forget china trump created virum die. worse ways others. don‚Äôt believe necessarily higher power, suppose live probabilities.

Bad things happen randomly, much control that, asking way you‚Äôre tipping scale probability maybe help.  many south Africans infected hiv. Maybe breeding ground new variants knows true 0.01% people hospitalized vaccinated, 30% hospitalized people vaccinated, especially small sample, like many people talking about? seen headlines like ""50% new Covid patients vaccinated"" turns 8 people.

It seem like every time wave peaks everyone rushes assume time there's one left infect, never seems case. Scotland delta wave peaked June around 4000 cases, far highest we'd ever had. peaked started falling everyone said it, would stay now. bounced right back up. age groups, areas large degree, we're hitting 6000+ cases day. percentage cases lead hospital admissions much lower now, we're test far push becomes problem, guess.

Found it!

September October generally good times vaccinated flu. Ideally, everyone vaccinated end October. Additional considerations concerning timing vaccination certain groups include:

Adults, especially 65 years older, generally get vaccinated early (in July August) protection may decrease time, early vaccination considered person unable return later time vaccinated.
Children get vaccinated soon vaccine becomes available, even July August. children need two doses flu vaccine. children recommended get first dose soon vaccine available, second dose needs given least 4 weeks first.
Early vaccination also considered people third trimester pregnancy, help protect infants first months life (when young Yes, quite level. vaccines, instances serious illness drop radically. mean contagious / produces serious disease?

Yo, know, downvote you. agree many kids seriously harmed, although unfortunately handful likely will. 

The point I'm sure whether lead rise older people subsequently getting disease.

I read something saying government decided start concerned unless looks like going rise 50000 deaths year covid. really give us lot wiggle room current 7 day average 112. 

137 daily deaths would equate 50000 year 

. would definitely ask. Frankly view teacher vaccinated point need explain why, seems reckless given know now. Makes sense. south-east may surprise - hopefully not, though - Delta arrive. like George Carlin bit. get 10 sick days district. co-teacher (we teach together) got covid. ten days. son got covid her. him. daughter also tested positive end quarantine window. her. almost 8 weeks. sick days going cover that? think studies, fact think studies showing need benefit third shot. theory effectiveness wanes 6-7 months booster prolong even theory. Even efficacy declines also entirely possible stabilizes point. Lots diseases us thousands years still deadly. know virus get less serious reasonable time scale. That's like referring to.   There‚Äôs going be. already know causes neurological issues average significantly worse stroke. There‚Äôs way clears up. 

These people idea fucked going be. Ok, slow Vindictive.

Normal people breath 6 liters air per minute.

For elementary school children, it‚Äôs 2 3 liters per minute.

So every hour class 10 kids (lol, imagine class 10 kids?) would breath combined (6 x 60)+(10 x 2 x 60)= 1560 liters air.

Whether teacher took mask not, actually think hand sewn fabric masks wearing effectiveness room together 8 hours day?

The bigger issue teacher vaccinated, approved vaccine elementary aged children, employment system encourages people take risks rather take days they‚Äôre feeling well. Flu shot timing depends age/health. 

The CDC website recommendations now. 

If recall correctly (and might not, please verify yourself) year kids ASAP elderly ""eh, maybe give month two."" Yep comments become popular reaction inspire people rather truth actual basis fact.

But social media cat bag. sure now. someone wants make life decisions based private Facebook group there's much do. Seriously. I'm US one states willing able implement Zero Covid I'd move today. Denmark declared pandemic over. really not! Dig deeper.

Take look Capitalism demanded return normal did. Well yes, COVID doesn‚Äôt hospitalize quickly. Exactly, shirking work. responsibilities earth poor, opting early ducking work. Yes, said anger. I'm angry people overwhelmed health care workers hospitals. preventable. sympathy vaccinated, health care workers, children , immune compromised. unvaccinated hospital be. largely preventable. die this, fault, completely innocent, made choice. true crime take others them. guys thinking chickenpox. infectivity compared chickenpox, small pox.

Too many poxes! Lol reddit answer possible. I‚Äôm double vaxxed. think people agree regardless opinions capitalism locking restricting socializing longer fucking sucks isnt sustianable. mean delta one infectious respiratory diseases know of, even it‚Äôs infectious small pox doesn‚Äôt make walk park R0 perspective. important become reliant rules thumb.  vast majority doctors vaccinated long mandates pushed anyone, entire comment moot point. power vaccination positive effects human condition taught medical schools, probably got vaccinated fairly quickly. Also, leading example jazz. Exactly, Delta variant struck last year... huge camp people describe anything related COVID attempt scare people. Wearing mask purported done fear also scare people. wearing mask means ""won't controlled 'their fear' "". Ironically good amount people mask outwardly anti mask consider also vaccinated, consider part problem ""safe"" knowing catch CDC said one point need mask. (I'm related lot people like this, think they're smarter ""professionals"" advanced degrees, work medicine.) Basically know get genie back bottle. civil rights act says discriminate religion. reasonably follows intellectually exemptions allowed. Congress allowed certain religious employers opt complex way. still stands civil rights act employer required make accommodations current employees religious belief. Much like ADA must long doesn‚Äôt provide undue burden them, employer. includes reassignment positions scheduling adjustments, case covid, mask wearing, additional PPE, perhaps daily testing employee required pay for. 

Actually accommodations may effective overall preventing spread covid given rate vaccinated people able contract covid spread mild symptoms mimic normal cold. Anecdotally tell organization requiring vaccination exemption testing vaccinated individuals all. we're obviously terrible (1M cases last week) that's less quarter world's cases week odds they'll still come outside US. think also falls risk assessment. everyday various things

I don‚Äôt statistics obviously I‚Äôd think city actively bombed would riskier going go see baseball game Covid vaccinated person. 

And unvaccinated straight morons What's going on? double-vaxxed still pass virus others, get yourself. irresponsible? 

This type argument fuels fears people asked mask forever. Covid never going away, we‚Äôre led believe vaccinated people always able transmit virus extent (albeit symptoms reduced), I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs surprising areas high vaccination people simply move on. Granted US diverse, areas low vaccination rates people definitely masking, areas like northeast vaccines stopped hospitals getting overrun, don‚Äôt really see point masking unless we‚Äôre near kids. live liberal city swear, nobody wears masks anymore. kid 4. can't get vaccinated. Thank goodness school require masks, I'm still terrified safety. Delta much worse kids previous strains.

I hate people.  braindead reddit hyper progressive take Lol America dude. Seriously? europeans know back bar club hopping.

At point people stop wearing masks?

Practically every state sequencing positive COVID samples. Additionally, left important parts links expressly state getting vaccinated increases protection previously infected individuals. Again, selective address care information. think variants taken seriously, time, real biological epidemiological limits virus mutations. mutation may effective vaccine immunity evasion may also come cost effectiveness spread/infectiousness, example. Neither guaranteed. there‚Äôs chance you‚Äôve heard whilst playing certain free roam game ? care clear I'm favor vaccination, believe works preventing hospitalizations reducing symptoms, people want take it. believe mostly important elderly, obese, disabled, diseased people take it, young healthy people.

But UK, rate fully vaccinated (as July, time article, even though material discussion happened earlier) 50% including least 1 shot 67%. (Our world data, taken google)

""The headline blog claims equates 62% 117 fatalities people received either one two doses COVID-19 vaccine. blog itself, however, says figure actually 60%, closer Reuters‚Äô calculation 59.82%. 2% discrepancy appears stem headline percentage including three people whose vaccination status unknown.
The blog also says 37% fatalities (Reuters‚Äô calculation: 37.6%) happened unvaccinated individuals.""

At time, unvaccinated clearly represented deaths opposed vaccinated individuals. 

Also last statement, look amount deaths now, would proof vaccines efficacy. That's bollocks. Correlation causation story. (Could also early covid killed weakest example.) live (Portugal) basically returned normal see people masks outside (if give number, around 60-70% depending area), everyone always mask indoors. suppose ideal scenario much infectious, much less deadly strain take hold become dominant. Link? impression said, too.  So? said healthcare workers leave. wish condemn innocent people die. 

You know wrong, adult admit it. led... going stick even covid, shortages hard bounce back still get sick, anyone take care except new nurses without experience want get vaccinated scared little poke poke. one single study peer reviewed, vs studies evaluations virology groups around world. Including India, Chili, United Kingdom United States state people get vaccinated. 

You looking make informed decision. looking inform previously made decision.

Me personally? I'm hoping OP study correct would mean rest us adults keep relying people like you. literally unfollowed subreddit,i'd forgot corona even exists. watch TV subreddit TV places hear it.  Actually Japan way average compared rest east Asia. Deaths per million citizens 125 Japan, 43.8 South Korea 3.5 China.

Even southeast Asian nations far lower gdp per capita like Cambodia, Vietnam Laos better Japan per capita deaths.

Yes it‚Äôs shame ROVI appears made bad batch vaccines. Hopefully countries take note contractors used vaccines.  that's understandable. needed lot testing recently. 

It would waste country handled best far stockpile testing capacity zero.

I know it‚Äôs different enemy invisible ignoring problem carrying normal life make go away. US got various variants stupidity though. Irrelevant covid transmissions happen symptoms even appear (similar many diseases aids, tb, whooping cough (which actually opposite - transmissible long time symptoms stopped treated antibiotics). dominant strain would probably transmissible regardless lethality. press bad governments.

Don't forget vaccine competition. would surprised Pfizer Moderna anything bad press. say likely. said possible.

To answer slightly different question ""How could deadly variant take hold?"" virus could evolve spike protein different enough evade existing immunities spike protein evolution could also make better attaching human cells existing strains. would make transmissible, result higher effective viral load, overwhelming body faster making deadly.

Again though, that's one possibility. could also evolve less deadly. know. thought Oregon pretty high vaccination rate?  Kids lead many many breakthrough cases adults. thry US. Pretty much, yeah. delta basically pushed alpha variant countries found. Yes that, know we're fining unvaccinated adults think be. good!  I‚Äôm coming something similar right now. fever, regular cold symptoms. Negative covid.

Delta doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúrun fuel.‚Äù look UK right now, everyone used example Delta‚Äôs supposed quick peak rapid drop, it‚Äôs dropping more. They‚Äôre steadily going up. Hospitalization going too, though still much lower pre-vaccine surges.

Basically there‚Äôs always going susceptible hosts Delta. Unvaccinated folks 2.34x likely re-infected vaccinated people. Dr. Poland Mayo Clinic doesn‚Äôt believe natural infection Delta triggers long term immunity good Alpha did.

All vaccinated people likely experience Breakthrough infection longer it‚Äôs since last jab.

Meanwhile, Delta continues rapidly mutate everywhere it‚Äôs spreading substantially. Fall/Winter seasonal surge baring us.

This doesn‚Äôt burn point without direct intervention. need actively fight control covid vaccine mandates, mask mandates, capacity restrictions, hopefully‚Ä¶ cases ever get low enough one day, proper contact tracing program test, trace, isolate.

We‚Äôre probably still looking 2-3 years we‚Äôre today. Dr. Fauci believes get things well control Spring 2022, would require lot hard work cooperation probably widespread vaccine mandates among majority US Employers Schools.

Yes, get Covid booster flu shot flu season. leadership? None infected became seriously ill hospitalized. delta variant blame least 18 cases, CDC reports. I'm saying vaccinated stop catching spreading COVID. Vaccination never important - vaccinated people continue endanger everyone around stop taking precautions. interpretation: "" believe god,you scared badly we're handling current existence.

Instead fighting 


lockdowns/opening up

direct anger leaders they‚Äôre failing leadership. civilized society shouldn‚Äôt upset other, it‚Äôs ‚Äúleaders‚Äù find solution. They‚Äôre stroking fire keep blame away themselves. Unnecessary infrastructure projects, unnecessary policing costs, etc could paused.  know nobody NZ asked but‚Ä¶. LOCK FUCK DOWN. could go back time really hard lockdown March-April 2020 would heartbeat. Prayer Warriors shooting blanks. vaccinated spreading vaccine resistant COVID, what's point? Don‚Äôt hasty, might inheritance money coming way next weeks! Flu shot? snarky--did mean vaccination saying flu shots really important Covid well? study Israel?

I wanted ask Funny mention nut allergy, someone facebook said talking covid/mandates:

""It's like one kid allergic peanuts demanding whole class eat pb&amp;j...that kid needs learn take care himself, expect society him."" (this direct quote took screenshot) isn't. do. least Texas health system distinguish rural city, look higher tier hospital patient, almost always cities.  experts predicting Delta wave move north, guys think Northeast do? advantage relatively high vaccination rate, also disadvantage high population density. really hope don‚Äôt get hit bad South here, advantages high vax rate overcome disadvantages high pop density. Dude immeasurable saying **main cause** second surge. That's ridiculous.

Did contribute? course. much? one knows. 1/6 Capitol Raid? summer's worth BLM marches? one knows, making unprovable claims. Agree.

The people singing tune would flip shit started obese people (i.e. huge chunk population). hypocrisy also think arresting people drinking driving authoritarian big-A way say talk 'the rise authoritarianism'.

This mind boggling analogy. even know vested interest maintaining public's health.

Sure. step government forcing coercing someone medical procedure, gone full blown authoritarian, matter try spin also separate criminals society.

Again, another head scratching analogy.  mention people playing safe necessarily guided fear, rather logic. never said get infected.i said getting seriously ill, science states.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* series events alone proves terrible communication CDC. learn? Don‚Äôt release guidelines absolutely sure direction research telling take‚Äî general public doesn‚Äôt need privy considerations‚Ä¶ creates noise.   hope. fact biology variant spreads easiest outcompete others. don‚Äôt know thing think back previous strains, original strain. Delta US back February, yet didn‚Äôt truly take 5 months later, July. Delta discovered early October 2020 didn‚Äôt take India late March. Likewise, original covid already US like January 2020. didn‚Äôt truly take March 2020. there‚Äôs always like delay months mere presence variant area spreading like wildfire, probably due nature exponential growth. Correct understanding wrong though. virus sort death toll would wreck absolute havoc modern societies. We're going recovering years structural changes needed (eg nursing teaching US, NHS waiting lists UK, tax pay support we've spending protect healthcare infrastructure). 

It's interesting looking things terms numbers versus human cost. really jading see numbers dead remember number represents someone's husband wife father mother son daughter never families again. Unvaccinated children forced school parents forced work keep stock market current all-time highs. 

If remove naked profit motive (and it‚Äôs like stock success asset inflation helping small businesses), could lock anytime spread gets bad four eight weeks, give everyone (workers, companies) stimulus keep okay indoors caught bills. time, could produce send quality masks residences schoolchildren return, community spread much lower due widespread EFFECTIVE mask adoption.

Ask - didn‚Äôt build new hospitals beef ICU capacity + nurse numbers surges? hospitals health care system writ large run profit shareholders, explicitly capitalist problem clashes public health crisis. They‚Äôre going undertake unnecessary expenditure.

**Also there‚Äôs small thing wouldn‚Äôt millions evictions socialist communist country.** That‚Äôs explicitly capitalist problem. socialist government owns flat mortgage, benefit evicting family, especially pandemic.

Who paying rent again? landlord profits. 

Who mortgage underwritten by? bank profits. 

Why want evict you? profit less loss. Makes difference evicted.

There valid critiques socialism market perspective. Keeping citizens housed crisis maybe easiest case make socialist system versus capitalist one lol unreported several viruses incredibly transmittable cause illness whatsoever.   I've seen information posted assumption considered incidental misinformation. clear virus cases happen could happen due fact people spread COVID getting sick already seems suggest less incentive virus mutate manner. way suggesting can't happen, I'm expert anything, necessary correct statement viruses general. covid isn‚Äôt nearly scary enough keep people locked away living lives forever. worth spend days staring wall trying cry. think walking every day. Damn bats again. varient

variant keep mutating sentiment matter. Eventually everyone refuses get vaccinated probably die. get better does. I'm saying vaccines still necessary, even culture cooperates inclination towards wearing masks. OK, happen we'd go severe lockdowns would slow spread. evidence variant dangerous ( least delta). Ofc keep observing that, far need assume variant might much worse delta  virus mutate extent becomes essentially two viruses longer compete other? essence become two separate viruses. got COVID year ago. week actually wasnt bad. Honestly worse flu time. Struggled even get breath speak words.

The breathlessness never left. 3 weeks later developed acute pneumonia, urgently hospitalised, full oxygen, went shock twice came close death. Heard say ""she might make it"".

Makes angry hear people say nothing serious. Oh OK.

Out curiosity, charge people work dangerous jobs more? Seems abut unfair. Oh Canada need extremely deadly strain long incubation period infectious we're fucked.  Pregnancy puts higher risk developing severe symptoms. unit placed around 20 covid patients ecmo. 4 pregnant women required emergency C sections prior cannulated ecmos. totally free readily available vaccine could lower risk catching virus, admitted hospital dying, several orders magnitude. 

Adding /s, case it‚Äôs clear. want get technical yes, rabies spread mostly via strains. would probably always bat reservoir even though spread meat containing rabies vaccine species spread it, acting vector. largely contain due effective human animal vaccine It‚Äôs already outside borders SA. article says identified multiple countries. Shutting flights won‚Äôt anything.   Delta already New York, though. Lol, I'm awful immature . Read damn report. antigen tests *do* miss cases, it‚Äôs almost always people high ct levels. you‚Äôre popping rapid antigen tests, there‚Äôs good chance you‚Äôre capable super spreader.

Like delta? - think first cases happen suddenly recognize new strain? Lol. ""lol""? gotten far pandemic info saying get vaccinated even previously infected.

Yes skeptical many contradictory statements different countries, doctors studies adds mix.

Some say get two doses, day get one 6 months, say recovered makes vaccinations unnecessary etc.

And [more immunity recovered **does** make intuitive sense it? Hope player use cheat codes. basically backdating items understand posts. die today, get counted Sunday 29ths death toll. whenever death certificate issued validated, go back adjust death count day died on.   IIRC, used child lock function TV blocked email address lists computer (or wife may gone deleted came; fully recall right now).

It's worth watching movie (even people deal it); free ads Amazon suppose shot acting like flu shot vs actually vaccine like vaccine smallpox, polio, typhoid, chickenpox, mmr, get vaccines ""bam"" immune covid virus got get next strain variant booster like flu seasonally. Maybe call vaccine something else since they're saying need boosters? Delta Max Pro Yep, true. NYT journalist Kevin Roose college, went ""undercover"" Liberty transfer student year. wrote entire book called ""Unlikely Disciple"", excellent. provides pretty solid, non-judgemental look Liberty life students also putting batshit-level craziness full display. Great book! Yes mostly no. Viruses depend host. ever one spreads efficiently outcompete hosts. would rapid antigen test tell difference someone 5000 viral copies 10000 viral copies? yes/no test. poster saying needs continuous / titration test. live country universal healthcare, skippy.

Yes lots risk factors, listing all, examples choices made directly impact health system..

I'm also favour taxes sugar trans fats much like cigarettes, gasoline alcohol reasons.. 100% agree you, I'm saying person allegedly 3 friends recently miscarriages 20 weeks -- that's unusual/statistically unlikely, would make pregnant women paranoid. saying get shot, there's scientific evidence suggest that, make person idiot worrying Even made changes today weeks getting worse changes start take effect. people need stop talking journalists till come real conclusion. 8 6 5 back 8. understand nothing official till it‚Äôs official lots skeptics use excuse discredit federal health agencies. can't hear argument, what'd ya say?! tends much ""I"" ""us"" American culture, willing inconvenienced us. Nursing creates similar feelings uselessness, also get wash poopies buckets. Yes they'll shuffle around. India people way fewer vaccines what's happened past, what's likely less deadly, infectious strain take hold.

You giving misinformation here, probably example little knowledge worse none all, imo. 

Delta contagious severe. likely reason increased viral load causing both. 

While infectiousness severity opposed, necessarily true, especially something transmits presymptomatically, asymptomatically, relatively small percentage severe cases. Considering Sturgis goers point weekend warrior types trailer bike way ride huge comfy chair type dresser harleys, there‚Äôs plenty space oxygen tank. got right money! Couldn‚Äôt said better myself. one feels like one variants we‚Äôre rolling dice one that‚Äôll end totally resistant vaccine we‚Äôll plunge back whole pandemic thing again?

Pretty much. Sunday in: +952K doses reported administered yesterday's total including 444K newly vaccinated 82K additional doses. Moot many boss phases have?

Wait release new DLC. would drop career move heartbeat paid better benefits. Everyday go home exhausted, it‚Äôs worth stress fatigue. days time recoup rather enjoy family time.  Superspreaders people act certain way high CTs culturalable virons.

In particular, talk loud, sing, yell high CTs AKA exactly rapid antigen tests would make sense wear mask me. knew even back going protect 100% surely protection common sense.

I also feel healthcare workers sure required vaccinate. Giving experimental medications performing medical experiments prisoners violation international law.

""Principle 22 1988 Body Principles Protection Persons Form Detention Imprisonment provides: ‚ÄúNo detained imprisoned person shall, even consent, subjected medical scientific experimentation may detrimental I‚Äôd think faster viruses less effective long term slower viruses. I‚Äôm sure deadliness matters. slow deadly virus would likely dominate fast deadly virus would burn out.  ""I want get MR. RONAS WILD RIDE."" Deaths absolutely high higher last time. Check Florida. I‚Äôm unsure you‚Äôre even serious Yes, whichever communicable, transmissible, wins. sort like around people one person loudest, physically largest, obnoxious person around. person get attention, good bad. transmissible strain simply reaches people, gives viral load (think germs). example UK strain communicable transmissible Delta variant came along pushed aside. also case numbers surpassing existed first began, people getting stronger virulent strain called Delta variant. far nothing beats Delta variant. Vaccines weaker a) original strain b) transmissible gives people virus, faster. long people refuse wear masks, wear chins, refuse get vaccinated, COVID ain't going anywhere. Yeah, rule, write ""fairly likely"" ""generally"" really know often happens. I'm sure happens. know Delta airlines rooting literally variant is. It‚Äôs ‚Äúabsolute unsafe‚Äù. Teachers get vaccinated children wear masks distance much possible. Covid dangerous children. virus kills less 1% people infected

Do know many people this? math. That's 80 million people globally. virus keeps mutating avoid immune response natural immunity previous strains, potentially vaccines get vaccinated fast enough, 80 million deaths repeat every Perpetual lockdowns

Won't needed world could get vaccinated. US countries hoard vaccines antivaxx idiots take vaccines countries. creates conditions new variants spread (like one article about) could potentially make vaccines less effective. Otherwise yeah, lockdowns needed last resort keep hospitals barely operational. think governments actually want lock down? they're forced keep society functional. Even then, stories emerge gunshot wound victims sent home hospital full Covid patients can't treat Mask

They work. Please wear one. Preferably n95/ffp2 graded can. small inconvenience reduce risk contracting Covid massively. idea average person can't wear mask public. get kind mask need right now. hardware store saw plenty N95 masks non-medical use tbh concerning that's Biden admin pushing boosters, even point shortening followup 5 months. think Delta like cancer... ppl 40 live cautious healthy lifestyles get die. like cancer nothing overly afraid of. who're middle-aged older need start worrying. 75 FL probably want skip trip Disneyworld get booster shot. That's keeps said since beginning pandemic got Delta seems deadly contagious. Well, fwiw think South Africa think vuvuzelas. work environment Healthcare already super shitty covid. investment NASA largely Cold War driven. Sputnik programs held many firsts ‚Äúmoonshot‚Äù first person moon made. cost us $280,000,000,000 today‚Äôs dollars. Well get injected alternate, live virus. actually make sick, erupt sores, dead.

However, TIL, word ""vaccine"" latin ""From cow"". Also I‚Äôm always puzzled ‚Äúno worse flu‚Äù argument. couple times I‚Äôve flu worst. 1-2 weeks feeling utterly miserable, unable eat sleep well, feeling awful. wonder people confuse colds flu. Also terrified water see Covid lot evolutionary pressure become less deadly spreadable asymptomatic, symptomatic symptoms start mild many cases ultimately turn lethal. would bet this, turned true far progression Covid variants. #MAH THUMBS MAH RIGHTS!!!! heard report r numbers delta came rest around 6.7 chicken pox around 10. isn‚Äôt contagious, quite contagious. So, pick one think best point idiotic explain yourself.

Show intelligence Like Cheez-Its front seat now? nurse worked many bad flu seasons, said COVID respiratory virus don‚Äôt need mask like ‚ÄúWHAT?!?!?!‚Äù wore one anyway. 

But vaccine mandates healthcare workers, schools (teachers students), absolutely agree.  Interesting... guess wonder country's getting vaccines all, especially donated ones. \*Goodbye 2022 true.

The smart move get vaccinated pregnancy decrease risk covid vaccination pregnancy There's delta plus Variant  mean horse tribe doesn‚Äôt seem Delta less deadly really case?  blame criminal GOP I'm one rare unfortunates never developed good long-term natural immunity chickenpox, I've four times throughout life. :( mild last three times, still got it.

Gonna need ocean‚Ä¶ calamine lotion Come on, Optimism: America still almost entirely open (unlike last winter‚Äôs peak) haven‚Äôt even hit peak yet infections. Half people around pretty liberal town aren‚Äôt wearing masks. 300x greater original strain seeing definitive proof vaccines saved could incredibly harrowing wave would‚Äôve done much, MUCH damage currently doing.  Twin tech trees, say? wear mask higher risk situations (ie crowded indoor areas poor ventilation) great questions! 

First, understand 99.9999999....% genetic mutation dead ends virus. mutation occurs limits prevents virus binding cell body replicating, it'll fade existence evolutionary dead end. 

Think handful successful covid-19 mutations thus far multiple number billion, give rough underestimate many unsuccessful covid mutation already been. 

Unlike coded computer virus, biological viruses goals intentions harm host. core foundation viral genetic code find ways make copies improve effectively efficiently continue replicate again. terms biology evolution, best interest virus kill host. again, there's notion intent virus trying achieving goal. random chance based number viruses currently circulation. 

Every single viroid opportunity mutation. there's many circulating around chances mutations make virus prolific astronomically low. Let virus circulate unchecked odds successful mutation starts swaying viruses favor. virus circulation greater probability going mutate way want. There's tremendous amount virus circulation moment probability prolific, vaccine resistance virulent variants emerging highly likely. 

The current mRNA vaccines help immune system make antibodies ""click"" place covid spike proteins. shape spike protein that's important terms mRNA vaccines. Mutations alter shape orientation spike protein make difficult antibodies bind readily able Alpha Beta variants. antibodies still bind delta spike proteins, quite effectively previous variations virus. Nevertheless, vaccine still works extremely well prevented people falling ill. 

The big challenge delta variant much slight change protein spikes, viral load imposes within infected individual. People infected delta saturated shed significantly higher rate previous variants.

If vaccinated come contact one single delta variant virus, immune system quickly make short work it. delta, people getting hit millions, probably billions, virus one time. Even vaccinated individual's immune systems hard time coping initial intrusion, take days body produce enough antibodies neutralize infection.   Delta still killing people *and* starting breakthrough infections think I'd prefer bite bullet go vaccine-resistant mutation gives everyone sniffles nothing else. lalapalooza articles said barely spread big deal. opposite here. presume vaccines difference? Corona like clingy ex won‚Äôt leave alone. Can‚Äôt get finally rid shit? :(  Suck fucking dick!!!!! know however lockdowns detrimental children‚Äôs outlook health.

b. ask minor revisions follow studies (i.e. wanna try larger population? Maybe randomized double blinded clinical study? vivo vs vitro?) 

c.) completely evicerated go drinking buddies fill empty void heart cause poured years life (i.e. coworker went drinking last night) 

In conclusion: Journals magazines merit, Preprints uses, peer reviewed journals legit quit, like reaaall good shit. (but take time, like one colleagues told me, ""Science patient process one durable helps patients!""

Maybe clear first time I'm sorry. Yes truly measure something like deliberately expose thousands vaccinated unvaccinated people virus see fare. unethical double blind study give half vaccine, half placebo, send wild track months. ""90% efficacy"" comes from.

What someone's odds exposed virus, odds getting infected exposed, without vaccine? Nobody knows. many people get sick virus even vaccinated? measured many different times 0.01% range. 

Are breakthrough cases especially high viral load, something unique person immune system circumstances? Nobody knows. know almost people get seriously ill breakthrough infection elderly serious health conditions.

If someone super high exposure like dealt symptomatic people every day vaccine less effective? actually measured this, check front line workers, really.

If someone enclosed space room pumped full virus weeks would vaccine still work? probably never find unethical, test simulate anything actually happens.

Back OP's original point ""It feels like everyone get infected point, despite vaccinated"", really reason believe true lot data showing won't. vaccines last lifetime possible completely eradicate virus planet Earth enough vaccines.

Tell manager. believes everyone fine, I'm anomaly! great rapper. Gone soon.  Good you. said immunocompromised?  I'd love to...if vaccine available child! That's good news! think caused that? people get better masking, etc., Delta run course?    Yeah, could cash hand think it‚Äôs technically illegal got caught. Yes do. situation bad, get much worse. 

[Mobile edge Hurricane hopefully ""only"" get tropical storm level wind rain. major hospitals Louisiana directly Ida's path. Mississippi also vulnerable-- much depends Jackson staying operational. least inland. 

All hospitals near Gulf Coast full. nowhere evacuate patients. room inevitable post-hurricane rush ER cases. 

And hospitals coastal cities cut electricity, water, transportation, etc., days weeks Ida passes? 

I fear go full-on triage mode. Also, IIRC vaccines first came out, recommended pregnant people get vaccinated yet, included trials. likely lot people remember hearing this, aware known safe now. I‚Äôd guess so. didn‚Äôt ask details seems way likely. vaccine make N antibodies. 

The 1012 arbitrary scale applies particular test. would find documentation somewhere figure scale is.  could systemic problem exacerbated COVID? also estimated rate acquired immunity contracting virus 20% children mid-May. model scenarios schools return, assumed rate risen range Children people least protected virus U.K.

Given recent findings naturally acquired immunity provides better protection vaccines, (probably) 50% immunity, that's going slow spread compared previous.

The way article written sounds like first time schools returning since pandemic started, schools open since early March. saw end Alpha wave vast majority Delta wave (so far).

I mean, spread, that's reality Delta need 98% immune get herd immunity. That's going happen immunity wanes fast even get 98% people taking vaccine.

This happen offer kind education. lied vaccinated status I'm you. Otherwise think facility liable inability provide safe environment ensuring/mandating vaccination staff. mean dude keep ranting (didn‚Äôt even read last one) want none you‚Äôre saying anything anything said. 

I simply pointed initial point childish, thoughtless, cruel. idea without merit. Since gone bizarre rant, instead adult saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right, much, wrong.‚Äù

Be adult next post. Make us proud. anyone knowledgeable explain mechanism vaccine (e.g. astrozenica) produce blood clot? Thank you.  honestly depends time day way wind blows. seem people middle argument.  American media tendency harp bad things avoid talking good things. Back Missouri Delta hotspot, everything much suffering many people dying. shifted talking bad Louisiana Delta. shifted Florida. Oregon‚Äôs spotlight, probably week it‚Äôll South Dakota. Meanwhile, Missouri well past Delta wave while, Louisiana well (but they‚Äôve got Ida worry about), Florida plateaued case counts solid week.

The optimist really wants believe Delta wave last major one. knows?  Yup sticking eight months. Trying manipulate people lying again. I'll getting mine six months. Consider pro-vax pro-early treatment. Politicizing effective tools arsenals foolish. scientist would definitely say ""proven"" protects infants based presence antibodies cord blood. would say something like ""it likely based know"". 

Which true. probably help protect infants, standard evidence science really really high. fact hugely problematic lot uneducated people see scientist making definitive statements assume means know. 100% Profit EVERYTHING. Even human life. Teachers required immunizations like measels. would different? I'm kind stupid, anyone ( Pfizer etc) working new vaccine? like Delta version? both, obviously. Jesus. terrified would happen. need impeach governor start bc stupid folks need told do. North Korea told citizens stay indoors avoid covid sand blown Gobi. That‚Äôs good point. people often forget Democrats paid dearly passage Affordable Care Act 2010 midterms. thing happened generation ago passed Medicare 1965 (also Voting Rights Act time) lost many seats 1966 midterms. point Medicare enormously popular Affordable Care Act much popular 10 years ago. takes courage pass legislation help people, especially knowing you‚Äôre going pay polls. case, hopefully gets better. Man, proving point again. 

And way, ask question mean receive answer. Even children understand that.  8 months probably chosen secure supply get allies first doses start boosters. make sense part calendar year. think depends. think admin managing patient population Florida hospital deserves medal. went black week, we‚Äôre hovering red. keep finding beds, turning new places ICUs, using PACU wards. holding skin teeth. canceled tons surgeries, outpatients emergent surgeries still happening. people horrible cancer still getting operated on. 20 tray morgue capacity twice. still think call cooling truck, want avoid optics. Plus, trucks actual body trays rented, they‚Äôd putting bodies floor trucks. finally seem realized thousand bed hospital needs bigger morgue capacity have, maybe someday might get morgue hasn‚Äôt really upgrades 20 years. suddenly got money new tools, saws, protective equipment started COVID autopsies, hope.

So hospitals seem strangely shocked, say really proud admin staff work doing. work pathology, seen emergency room checking staff multiple times.

Gotta keep boarders closed, want delta variant getting in! laws like this, sad. hope nothing happens get sick I've begging get vaccinated better part year Ah got hate word Americans really pussies. Face God damn fears like 5 seconds. many tough guys acting like they're big strong people get terrified little price. Yeah I'm get deluge people claiming get waves panic attacks know what? Get fuck it, worthy enough excuse get vaccinated. Living virus means adapting it. Vaccinations, masks, etc. 6/7 efficacy! good news. 

It seems like older people waning immunity much faster younger. Boosters still likely dramatically increase 7x ratio though, nearly zero cost (once world enough first doses).  vaccinating lowers risk hospitalization severe disease. host nationally infected, minor case better protected long run. Vaccines still absolutely worthwhile. LSU requiring everyone vaccinated negative covid test. Indeed. People think end pandemic ripping bandaid off. instead, they‚Äôre actually dumping gasoline fire. Well depends they're dead mostly dead. Mostly dead slightly alive. dead, well, dead there's usually one thing do. World laughing  Delta changes everything.  biggest thing me. WANT go vacation go shit look forward fun, half fucking population stubborn pieces shit, can't fear safety, kids, too. along slide down. state reported 9% positivity 8/12. Dates grey reporting lag. Negative test results take longer Testing tab see note graph posted Friday. really weren‚Äôt afraid wouldn‚Äôt take meds, wouldn‚Äôt take hospital beds wouldn‚Äôt guns. Thanks! wonder saw many articles like week ago. Different data?  obviously read article, states *did* retire 10 years ago rehired. still mental capacity teach desire help next generations. recent comment pathetic attempt save face denigrating intellect. Also, fuck still talks IQ? Stephen Hawking said, ‚ÄúPeople boast I.Q. losers.‚Äù saw posted elsewhere: , titled ""BioNTech: Third vaccine dose needed, need adapt Delta variant"" , quotes ""... BioNTech see need retool vaccine target highly infectious Delta variant. ""

I thought already started developing booster vaccine modified Delta applying fo clinical trials. happened? decide pursue it?   That's disturbing. Sounds like might get booster sooner rather later. anyone read article? say? socialism they‚Äôre scared vaccine. believe Supply Side Jesus:

Exactly this. probably least 100 applicants ready apply professor‚Äôs job 1000 adjuncts happily take course load hire someone permanently. I'm aware of. Anyone proclaim ""medical exemption"" without needing provide proof, bylaw anywhere power fine far I'm aware. thing businesses deny access premises, lot bother pain ass security/staff.

Thankfully, Canadians pretty compliant mask wearing, we're damn well. could probably count two hands amount times I've seen people stores without mask, people behaving well. tend see lot people wear rapid transit systems, pain ass R naught Delta variant 5 8. Always been. Lmao how? Life literally even change throughout entire thing. Imagine getting upset vague presence disease somewhere world.  Reminds opening scene film La Haine talks man falling skyscraper every floor passes says ""so far good"".  Yeah may well check. Wishing well!! know probably correct. Sad speak truth. Read book. better stories it. coming. Ford government trial balloon's (as always do) finally caved. Even Doug Ford came saying ""no!"" already put money developing vaccine ""passport"" system could ready roll out. saying within next couple weeks live. hospital collapse longer imminent risk. happen enough population exposed first time. Exact numbers may vary (and depend age vaccination) probably 85-95%. Vaccination might needed anyone ~25 get there.

That's societal approach. individual approach vaccines/boosters available shut hospitals bit (to give healthcare workers break) let everyone wants catch covid. huge chunk population resisting efforts prevent it. 

This biggest thing, imo. dick slits would follow recommended guidelines could actually place better shit. mean, look New Zealand. That's could languishing bullshit. One foot front other. okay simply existing right now. replica home election commission chairman. partial chairman he‚Äôs holding political event house?  think work scared making vaccination mandate mandatory lose lot workforce, mask mandate almost went away apparently someone complaining put non mandatory survey vaccination rates assume hit threshold needed stop mask mandate. I'll still wear mine get dirty looks wearing mine store Texas town small lacking taller structures contribute major damage earthquakes, didn‚Äôt look like that. 

That said, lot economic damage. people lost homes, many received compensation FEMA funding denied homeowner‚Äôs insurance doesn‚Äôt cover earthquake damage. businesses closed doors forever lost two school buildings. 

Our local infrastructure still recovering, visible damage repaired. work remains seems sewer system roads. COVID-19 lack funding delayed lot. can't think much worse hell right losing place storm packed shelter unvaccinated. 10 percent? Bull. parties wearing them. total BS. Christianity says fight end.

The thing hate G P they‚Äôve twisted religion meet whatever politically demanded last president Faux News. elderly, obese population meet anti-restriction nutter charge? unlikely. billions people world, one million chances happen every day. it‚Äôll happen people, individual risk nearly zero. massively underpaid, overworked. Thanks diligence.

Religion ruins everything. politicians blocking mask mandates.  schools open hold butt cheeks bumpy ride  version kids take 120% free time...


I work computers guys totally get mean. norcal? started cutting district's testing bc case numbers high live Australia, people fucking fuming government. Already violent protests beginning. normally pretty chill people insane lockdowns woken people up.   seemed last thing responded to. Got shots eyes every months. good news though every years something new comes impacts lot things really impact. people still describing ""fully vaccinated"" 2 shots, clearly need ""booster"" shot raise efficacy rate protect Delta Delta Plus (which WAY worse Delta)?

I certainly describe ""fully vaccinated"" one month I've ""booster"" shot. thought rather weird second half article home, pandemic wrecking entire state. like squished human interest piece pandemic article. Wondering isn‚Äôt trolling friend. sounds like Texas Florida.

Everyone throwing hands ""if die, die"" tired it. Especially us pro vax left leaning. Moderna thing, different spike basically nothing extra terms neutralization antibodies compared booster original. Poison Control laughs them. campus current positive cases last school year. world's population choice; enough vaccines go around long time.

In meantime, good natural infection gives people good levels immunity, lot people natural infection going get one chance get jab. Thank üíö come broken home, nearly lost spouse 2019 lost ferret. I'm constantly breakdowns work, find crying anything end shit. husband also mental issues, retire career caused PTSD etc, carrying well, ride. 
 Can't afford mental care, insurance option county offers make much money makes sense literally scrapping by. I'm frustrated beyond exhausted. cannot afford $200+ session $100+ follow ups. can't even afford new clothes man. Lmao, literally comment thing. Nothing really changed me. anything, guess feel relief knowing I'm one worried future, struggling find job. Yes. viral load measurement used viral RNA. doesn‚Äôt really tell us whether RNA potentially infectious intact viral particle. research looking like might intact infectious vaccinated people. know ‚Äúwait research‚Äù isn‚Äôt satisfying answer, that‚Äôs have. I‚Äôd also add testing requirements, ridiculous vaccinated travellers cost logistical reasons well risk asymptomatic positives could land someone quarantine upon arrival turned away border. don‚Äôt get point: community spread effectively apparent every country hamper tourism hospitality sectors little return containment. Facebook Nah. Don‚Äôt time waste. research. definitely call people troll though. That‚Äôs bet. can't go 8 weeks restricted bubble order free FOREVER? funny thing Uber capitalists suggested beginning,  Akaman Cuban another billionaire yet...so define ""continue"" BUD. mandates popping up. Where's fucking revolution? naa I'll say hole nonabots kill everyone. lmao Ancient Egypt?  We've 'incubated variants?' Kent variant discovered due good levels sequencing - countries like Netherlands admitted also found population did, conventionally forgot mention that.

Tim Spector right. care high infection rates. That's we're evil Dickensian society we've portrayed NYT, catching mostly either 1. Fully Vaccinated 2. Unvaccinated choice 3. School aged children, virus vast majority cases mild for.

Edit: also, where's evidence hospitals coming strain wave? county whose sheriff proudly defied lockdown last year. Unfollowed every ass shared video social media oust portion people society think happen? Civil unrest violence become new normal really don‚Äôt understand nurse, especially you‚Äôve around situation seeing it, still refuses get vaccinated. Where‚Äôs disconnect coming from? would loved hear advice behind paywall... I'm afraid clickbait though... I'm actually interested opinion. Please, tell me, even private message me. allowed kick student? found home like found community people playing cooperative games internet. nice thing look forward community engage without complication perhaps becoming sick large crowd. holy shit No, near Death Valley, CA.   agree, can't find info chances long covid breakthrough infection. I've seen asked many times tv one seems know answer. Dead can't pay 10% 10 hours simulated mannequin exhaling only. point mask probably saturated dripping olive oil (what used test).

The exact report confirms 40%+ reduction exhaled particles surgical masks studies found.

I get everyone wants go back normal general feeling ditch masks. reasonably credible recent research puts 30% covid develops ""long covid"". Let's say two thirds employment (kids, unemployed, retired). That's still 10%. moment we're around 3000 people per day checking work longer couple weeks. wondering trouble filling job spots ""nobody wants work"", might part answer. can't go back ""normal"" 3000 people per day randomly dropping workforce. Local news website comment sections absolute dregs internet. Avoid costs unless want lose hope humanity. see cases picking deaths small fraction previous two peaks Spring 2020 Winter 20-21. link cases deaths broken asymptomatic younger cases? hospitals holding up? know NYT hard-on bashing UK, goodness sake.

1. COVID rules left England. Scotland seems mask mandates.

2. Scotland high levels mask compliance accounts, cases rising massively decided open nightclubs schools around time, meaning exit wave mixed new school term.

3. Cases actually fallen England today, cases look 30,000 - 38,000, they're rising slowly massive degree.  Nope. make gov cave. way around bud lies here. Literally stayed I‚Äôm lazy research. Hard give southern states credit given precedent. Educate me. I‚Äôm down. Thanks. Yeah, try use site loads horribly me. People need socialise see people without capitalism.  That's awful. hope settle somewhere quickly cost? - herd immunity. children 12 vaccinated yet? anyone know long term impact covid? people follow safe protocols. wear masks indoors (to include public transport) get vaccinated, Herd immunity concept, might viable. Right not. Especially people needlessly suffer. Thing want enjoy life right one I‚Äôm aware of, want enjoy every moment, prepare life would miss one. Won‚Äôt laughing economy hyperinflates. Enjoy bi-annual coof jab masks. I‚Äôve got natural immunity makes zero sense get it. people fully vaccinated, recommendation quarantine 7 days exposure negative test 5 days ok leave quarantine assuming symptoms.  Floridians (like parents) convinced state‚Äôs handling Covid great. probably downvoted people part age-group, close particular age group, want admit age-group wrong. also read studies 2020 claimed people 40 years old worst wearing masks too, going personal experience, seems case. 

I'm Millennial, USA, generation *barely* better via vaccination rates COVID-19 Generation Z. I'm surprised, generation seemed believe myth vaccines cause Autism(I've seeing notion since early 2010s), turned major anti-vaxxing generation. ŒïœÖœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑœé! ŒßŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœÑŒπœÉŒºŒøœçœÇ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒëœÖœÉœÑœÅŒ±ŒªŒØŒ±! sorry man. masks either, even surgeries. May well eliminate hand washing too. Hell, go back bloodletting treating four humors. Enrollment concerns? mean reducing in-person class sizes. Sounds like plus... love going store instead self-checkout talking human ringing groceries like 1980s I'm sure get board here. CDC (well, actually FDA) needs go process proper emergency authorization first, skipping steps compensate ""anti-mask governments."" Anti-mask governments direct fault people voted in, CDC.

With said, authorization vaccines adults, resources needed made available expedite research vaccinating children. That's IMO important booster plan FAR important full FDA approval. priority #1 ever since vaccine supply stopped issue. even less developed place like Alabama. fires join local RFS unit. got 2 months training got shut pandemic. still know training thankful knowledge. hope go back get lockdown  There's limited inconsistent data much reduce total infections. UK shows 88% Pfizer, pretty consistent US numbers. We've used shorter dose interval going worse. Israel shows much lower numbers; possible apply older people. US one- month dosing interval might around 80% (a number studies given). difference 80% 90% factor 2 - pretty significant uncertainty. likely booster would bring back least original levels (95%) everyone. 

That's lower bound much vaccines prevent transmission. know exactly much infected. Singapore study (keyword: kinetics) showed peak viral load, viral load dropping least twice fast vaccinated. Another study showed viral load vaccinated people less likely infectious, though. value probably least 50% could much higher. alpha appeared least 90% (keyword: initial reduction viral load), research duplicated delta. Horonzonless perfect description. Honestly horizon scares living crap me. twice excited see friends go Ren Faire cancle last minute. (very small) LARP near future dare get excited it. able enjoy stuuf becoming anxious whatever hobby time get sucks. Yep, happened me. fidgetiness immediately stereotyped anxiety. Sensory overload attributed pickiness roundly mocked everyone. Hyper focusing dismissed ‚Äúspacing out.‚Äù Always trouble falling asleep, asleep, enormous trouble waking up. slipped cracks.  ""earthquake swarm"" south Puerto Rico? ‚Ä¶and delta variant hospitalizes and/or kills twice many men women.

Get vaccinated folks. wonder start watching identity fraud? Could anti-vaxxer potentially pay someone go take vaccine them? Idk, thought. need ID either back April mandates began. whole lot constituents finding really thing. Well I‚Äôm happy got fired. shouldn‚Äôt work force. Every questionnaire I've seen asks contact infected person last 14 days. hope make alright get vaccine. Earliest get mine end October I'll staying indoors big Reddit's carbon footprint? agree much first sentence. (or atleast was) social person shit hit fan 90% hobbies social outings kind. pandemic came, removed almost hobbies, made WFH bf works callcenter next me, seeing friends slowly descend depression. already lost 3 friends life broke me. hopped back bingeing restricting food calculating things purely keep busy (luckily bad before) somehow became unable emotuon ""grey"". Losing job then, 1.5 months next job, structure life one terrible mental health. I've finally got right path, worry much friends still 'falling'. Hopefully it'll end soon.  can't breath mask think they're healthy enough allowed leave hospital unattended, like that's serious breathing issue even normal cloth mask WITHOUT PROPER FILTER PLACE much handle. Like we're talking ""probably can't breathe taking brisk walk"" ""can't hold breath underwater"" levels lung impairment. can't handle mask? Ok I'll call 911 since experiencing serious repritory failure likely even breathing speak!! Lol That‚Äôs good know! must frustrating areas deal ignorance one side hurtful assumptions/stereotypes other.

Sorry OP, stay safe well. don‚Äôt, broken people easy control, desperate, willing sacrifice. think let walk away? Ah hell naw. know gov got raging control boner rn think Sturgis attendees actually answer phone contact tracer county health department calls?

HHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHhahahaHAHAHAHA

Yeah. Sure. Yes still right! that's point taking sensible steps help protect yourself, done can. proactive can/will hopefully lessen anxiety. people wrote, don‚Äôt wallow COVID news.  know someone works VA that's told me. actually makes sense since would relieve patient load. also talk shifting administration nurses (non patient care) patient care.
Nurses across board short supply. whole thread real wholesome stuff.  people work kids, work can't control work.  Bodily autonomy me, thee! Sturgis lasts weeks. People eating sleeping together, repeated contacts, leads exposure. Ah. cat pretends kid.    also legally required special care given unvaccinated people suffer workplace discrimination forms disadvantageous treatment

Tldr excuses some, still unvaccinated people work areas. nurse ICU vaccinated. respiratory therapist another ICU vaccinated. understand either. bad decide something officially marked safe &amp; effective. needed medical care, I‚Äôd rather nurse unvaccinated nurse.

With former, risk covid, unvaccinated nurse point competent nurse. either break wall warming (so repeat hangouts) alcohol.

It's known problem. International students tough time. It‚Äôs tough living next tourist capital, locals tourists, conspiracy people. They‚Äôre every where. least 2 military bases lot vaccinated people, offering telework. think helps curb getting bad. 

We don‚Äôt even go anymore except groceries, especially newborn. honestly wouldn‚Äôt going regardless would live. mention unless wearing mask correctly right mask like n95 efficiency high. get something better nothing cmon. Paywalls rampant among Florida's newspapers.  One college NJ offered $500 towards tuition getting shot, also $500 room.  got shot saved $1,000 year college. told neighbor college student pissed. said got smart do. wants save $1,000 college too. August says ‚Äúhold vodka‚Äù call Cliff. Scientists say pigs thumbs language, could trained simple manual labor. give 20-30 years loyal service retirement dinner eat them. Rednecks. Canada done amazingly well. UK green list rest world still amber red. Well done! Anti-vaxxers posting study, saying delta variant immune vaccine : likely study, coming site releases non-peer reviewed studies, accurate it? think first try religious exemption. warned may rejected state level (especially try justify ideological grounds), even granted, employees wear fitted N95s school property duration pandemic. lot evangelicals also object masks interesting see happens. Thank you! Hope you‚Äôre hanging too! :) mean rude kids work there. Plus who's say work got gas station mask mandates local nfl game 100 thousand ppl that's also mask mandate idk make alot sense. either mandates none all. Oh good another politics post yet again. exactly. Herd immunity *only* occurs overwhelmingly vaccinated populations. Herd immunity never never occur wild virus infections subsequent ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù. Small pox, polio, measles, mumps, pertussis killed maimed people generations hundreds years brought control *mass* vaccinations 90% populations. Plus, average coronaviruses antibodies last 4-18 months depending variant. Infections already recurred growing number people. Shit. hadn‚Äôt heard today. Gee, could predicted firing nurses would result nurse shortage? Morons. so? shockedpikachu.jpg  Reinfection incredibly rare though that's remained consistent throughout course pandemic. see covid could become endemic vast majority people get once. passes time? Kids currently pretending cats fix getting reddit...this site cancer Kentucky. limped along fairly well Democratic governor, Republican legislature stripped emergency powers, I'm sure we'll joining likes Texas Florida soon. Well, actually. *Quite* bit. it‚Äôs late anyway. That‚Äôs absolute shit excuse. It‚Äôs religion. feel you, fell addiction, lost love life, lost job shortly after, pandemic hit. I'm surprised well I'm today. I'm vaccinated, contracted covid work, today finally complete isolation bedroom. apartment small partner poor afford gotten too. ten days totally alone without physical contact affected mental health last 18 months combined.  like... Heaven's Gate level talk. teens Covid, hopefully Matt Gaetz safe. üòè  guy made great argument everyone get vaccine. great reason why. political.  making statement views great way nudge people fence move towards vaccine. 

I mean get vaccine me. got everyone else. said did. 

I understand people. bullshit sensationalist title. ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù death toll, mean somewhere around type death tolls seeing country country, state state entire last 18 months continually various waves covid hit? Actually sounds like lot precedent ... KURRA: Yeah. almost deja vu, reboot. knew this. anticipated this. surprise us health care world. prepared it. Unfortunately, say entirely preventable. measures mitigate suppress spread. one wearing mask, point check see vaccinated tests. provide free testing, that's stop spread.   Well. say. inventor mRNA vaccine, well specialists, pretty vocal wrong. How? Perhaps I‚Äôve wrong side statistics often, 3 year old congenital condition increases risk complications respiratory illness. Said congenital condition rare ruled also incredibly rare (less 1000 known people affected) genetic cause, leaves diagnosis ‚Äúidiopathic‚Äù - far less chance 1/50, also okay. lost mom last January. tough. I'm sorry tough times, thanks health care worker time. ‚ÄúExtraversion‚Äù = Shamelessness try put back together broken cup. never really quite same.

Hopefully learn adapt better it, least move past it. Good times. Yes, uve ever considered healthcare time. places drowning work pay pretty well point People going die. Protect staying away super spreader events. people can't saved. Taxes optional, people health insurance either.

But antibiotics, chemotherapy, insulin.... shit is.  We‚Äôll recover fine. People get it. end first though. helps stops spread Covid. kids 12 can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet. feel like mask mandates go away.  Good thing problems waaay 2019 ""... coronavirus pandemic over..."" lol  Agree 100%. I‚Äôm happier I‚Äôve ever been. wife kids, truly don‚Äôt care interact single person. way whole life. make sense reinfection rates still incredibly low, like near zero, that's still reflected recent data Israel. High vaccination rates mean covid still spread herd immunity reached without many people getting sick. good news training wheels compared pandemics coming. think many people really quit this? going work then? bet lot making big deal eventually reluctantly get vaccinated  someone explain mask even fully vaccinated. employers mandating Monday. hard time myself. I'd say 70% vaxxed work. Mind manufacturing facility. mean look stats rare see hospitalizations deaths vaccinated. Ok cares get mild flu symptoms never mattered pre covid. ones that's vaccinated months quite honestly care either. Struggling see end site. really zero covid bc long time. That's rant ü§™ parents appointment booked September. healthcare system.  concerned about. I'm glad mom got yours. Stay safe. feel. good set coping mechanism keep list phone. barely help point. stress much constant. Depression back regular part day again. thank Jesus saving them, doctors nurses. That's sad part, thanks covidiots pandemic never going end. Mine too. treatment anything it‚Äôs socially acceptable hermit. I‚Äôm married kids I‚Äôve always enjoyed alone, home, diving endless books, video games, etc. work home permanently it‚Äôs literally dream come true me. Now, leave house. Occasional family trips days align grocery runs mostly. whole, activities home love. Also bought house land right covid blew plenty do. probably suck people opposite personality though. can‚Äôt imagine kids around this. Needing worry top everything else. Fuck. Profits people. ongoing American nightmare. idea many ER D-Dimers run day. used run like month so...everyday eat 2 bottles D-Dimer reagent shift. insane. safe folks True, tiring. was.. back March/ April 2020. even winter peak around Dec Jan, people taking precautions somewhat. worse position now, literally one seems care. vaccines reduce infections transmissions some, percentages Covid. impressive percentages preventing hospitalization death vaccinated person. 

Long story short, getting vaccinated protect others, patients students. Doubt bad thing honest Christians encourage it, blind faith faith all. God gave us brains used ask hard questions believe why. greatest thinkers time religious scholars. know doctors none family members physicians work left refused care patients. None doctors operated me, diagnosed treat refused care. statement offensive hyperbole. abandon capitalism anytime want, it? move communist country burn money, live woods, grow food never take part market again. stopping you? 

let people live want. Thank you. pandemic shown power normalcy bias. rigorously testing messaging taking notes future policy, like dealing climate change. anxiety already. Pretty manageable. super depressed, sad days world is. 100% forgetting attention span. Every day struggle work work efficiently. wanted say CBT DBT aren‚Äôt usually best tools dealing ptsd, lot folks going have. that, approaches like emdr somatics work better. went recently graduated college student, living friends fun new stuff regularly, living alone barely anything last two years. barely remember 2020 point. hard time getting college, I‚Äôm stuck boring pit again. don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm going get back out. 72 angry Virginians! sound cliche ones closest us tend hurt us most.

I love absolutely asshole Damn, meanwhile country got vaccinated Pfizer April healthy 18 yet 25% country vaccinated. saddens people like want get vaccinated can't close 24/7 appointment vaccination centres nobody goes there. r/WayOfTheBern Shots shots initiative. Sounds good. let‚Äôs get class action lawsuit started things learn school too. Theres massive difference nursing laboratory physician. Nursing school really seems focus patients care, signs symptoms interact w machines, lab nearly patient care knowledge know great deal chemicals body, id imagine physician great deal plus pharmaceuticals.   know. lot people thought good caring person's showed dark side pandemic. hurts doubly I'm poster child virus person. Never fully recovered one tinnitus, days cranks 11. Sprinkle 24/7 dizzyness, pain ear clogged ear feeling. I've ran f*cks give antivaxxers. thing bothers people bring path self destruction. I'll take ""Things Blind Man Could See"" $1000. I'm feeling isolated ever.  Last year everybody made effort stay connected Zoom, actually sentimental awkward late night trivia nights family meetups.  social habits ways hung obliterated last March really come back, make effort connect.  

I'll also finding worse coping things.  Smaller stresses anxieties get bigger hang around longer.  know that's COVID related ""broken brain"" feels pretty accurate. 

Not sure get better trying.  fighting through, trying productive, trying new experiences still.  And, I'm limiting activities come up, all.  Sporting events, fairs, plays, chance go, I'm there.  COVID risk, risk damage mental health bigger. Life long chronic health problems may make see advantages socialized medicine. Emphasis may. I've wondered too. we: stop quarantine exposure stay home sick, stop testing asymptomatic people due work travel requirements, stop pre determined quarantine sick people (just return normal symptoms resolve),stop testing minor symptoms (no need find recover rest home).

At point stop. breaking society. Vaccinated people rarely anything minor symptoms. hate unvaccinated people stressing hospital system rest us inconvenienced stupidity? children missing school childhood experiences minor cold like virus. consequences treating pediatric infection like devastating children. 

I frustrated leaders this. need clearly communicated guidelines plan. I'm left leaning started feel like sort conspiracy theorist due loudness cautious vaccinated left. LoLlApAlOoZa???? think caught COVID despite getting second Moderna dose 7/23 (and therefore already fully vaxxed). community spread insane testing booked til Thursday Friday next week home tests stock. Tomorrow morning getting lining urgent care hoping seen test. Still hoping negative, weird dry cough, odd tight feeling chest, tastebuds whack, don‚Äôt know else could going on. possible breakthrough case soon vaccinated? waited four months get see new dentist. Covid cases doubling every week area. finally dawned ask covid precautions. Turns require masks staff vaccinated. Welp, guess get skip dentist another year. OP like (who also November 2020) 48 hours vaccine symptoms probably difficult experience. traumatic - PTSD esque response. know sounds weird gone rough bouts virus like likely understand.  ICU beds SEC filled COVID patients:

Mississippi 59%

Alabama 56%

Florida 53%

Georgia 53%

Texas 50%

Arkansas 48%

Louisiana 47%

Okla 43%

Missouri 39%

Kentucky 39%

Tennessee 36% local hospital starting putting numbers vaccinated vs unvaccinated patients week. area roughly 55% people vaccinated (pitiful). local hospital averaging 30% thee hospitalized patients vaccinated. 

I'm finding pretty disheartening. thought number would much lower, especially breakthrough levels reported low touted benefits vaccinated (I months). 

Feeling anxiety go school starting Monday 2 kids young vaccinated. Thank kindly. Oklahoma 4million people got 8k-9k dead covid. pleasure. brain fine. think myself. Thank ‚Äú‚Äùarticle‚Äù‚Äù far right movement getting louder louder. 

Canada same..I feeling worldwide problem remember one. felt it. I'm southwest you. HIPAA, case anyone wants research it, totally agree filming patients blurring faces. Somehow, something smart informed. Geaux Tigers. sports board meltdown it, even though test negative. It‚Äôs alt-right, anti-mask, anti-vax, filled old white boomers. Good time parents teach kid it‚Äôs ok things it‚Äôs smart thing do. life ability protect loves worth discount still smart get early. sorry. two kids school young. douche! husband traveling work, returns masks, quarantines one room bathroom home (and masks around us) it‚Äôs hard highly recommend around kids. Also try rapid test. Best luck family. Well obviously zero idea would happen since [last safe inconsequential. family members dumbest people I‚Äôve known. One aunts cousin immigration despite us Hispanic damn grandparents immigrants. 

Not mention ‚Äúdo research‚Äù spew bullshit non stop social media. Somehow opinion fact can‚Äôt wrong Covid. I‚Äôm medical professional yet, it‚Äôs infuriating trying reason say don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm talking I‚Äôve studied viruses, bacteria cancer university. I‚Äôm student, imagine frustrated medical professionals trying hard get control must feeling. Previously discussed here: support passport general, like lack medical exemptions. hard outline list valid exceptions verified province. far abuse system doctors go pretty easy, make family doctor specific specialists multiple doctors family doctor. tell doctors anyone who's numbers stick audited, they're giving exemptions town patients, first time patients etc etc. audit shows fraud, bye bye medical license start. Zero accurate number. many excess deaths counted FLorida 2020? Honestly, hardest thing whole pandemic lockdowns, fear getting sick, gym closures social isolation, realizing many people kind shitty. honestly believe 40% population really dumb, stubborn, irrational, borderline sociopaths, another 40% top ain't bright either, maybe completely lost. 

It really brought worst people bit unmasking moment people life thought cool. Xylitol plant based sweetener. ??? Probably depends age group. immediate family still parents, instead spouse kids. Sorry sounds rough, hope passes. friend serious chronic pain issues found meditation practices impossible yet others enormously helpful. Hope springs eternal I'm nurse healthcare professional read. could one know intubation able breathe? could one miss broken glass lungs, long covid, intense fatigue, heart problems brain fog? bubble live unaware potential consequences covid? I've driving rideshare entire pandemic money good, stories I've hearing late-night passengers pick hospital emergency rooms chilling. Last night picked woman way home casually mentioned mom dad hospital covid mom probably coming home. write mother ill coronavirus well, everywhere right now. It‚Äôs civic duty crush virus. grandpa fought Battle Bulge fought way across Europe. We‚Äôre asked vacc mask up. zero respect covidiots, *zero* Seems like rolling dice.

Thats like intubated."" 

Get vaccinated. fair say people avoiding vaccine playing Russian roulette. Roulette infers quick death unlucky. 12‚Äôs likely vaccinated? 

Covid isn‚Äôt going leave. like flu child current generation better getting new thing twenty years time first time. older population unlucky ones here. around new strain coronavirus hits you‚Äôre immune system isn‚Äôt strong, sucks. like moon landing, there's enough conspiracy theories abound defund NASA scientific achievements harder future. extensive background meditation including meditation retreats. disease disabling, longer meditate. yeah, pure

Lots people capitalizing US making bad PR spectacular fashion highly motivated religion. Booze weed? Don‚Äôt know well. days really don‚Äôt power anything, work, good husband, good dad, good friend. sucks feel horrible can‚Äôt help :/ It‚Äôs easier useless slob sometimes. Sorry hear. Wonder Buddhist master would position (eg theory could one still meditate reach higher mental states?) I've always ailments - welcome family! Oh come guys surely one could predicted would happen... Right?? stop rewarding greed. I'm public shaming time stocks. could eat rich. Greed problem though. You‚Äôll probably fine. wear one next time. I‚Äôm sure love him, dad ass. know much must hurt since child‚Äôs life disregarding sake pride?, ego? goes show innately selfish humans are. Empathy default setting. Florida Man.  wait rest country catch vaccinations?

Probably not. US big enough local jurisdictions able stagger mitigation efforts needed different regions. established, detailed benchmarks apply local healthcare jurisdictions determine whether mitigation efforts needed. way, there's squabbling ""why need masks indoors anymore"" ""why schools need temporarily go remote learning"". that, answer would always be, ""because numbers tell us to"".

It's sad 18 months in, data science technology have, US unified pandemic playbook would prevent people asking original question. data tells us exit strategy look hard enough. Right. greater risk clotting covid vaccine. It‚Äôs stuff like ER staff doesn‚Äôt know. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm prepared 100% blame them. Seemingly institutions done poor job informing staff. always. unvaccinated manager sick two weeks said nothing us. Turns covid exposed us didn‚Äôt say shit. I‚Äôm sitting headache sore chest poor kid young get vaccine. Thank you! unvaccinated 25 times likely die vaccinated. Herd immunity may correct term, previous pandemics like Spanish Flu eventually faded away.

It's going get worse vaccines required, smaller communities much enforcement.  constantly worried sad also angry time. Well remember many us taking seriously start continue so. We're surrounded idiots. State, especially South Florida, well terms vaccinations. Central Florida Panhandle ones keeping vaccination numbers lower driving covid numbers up.

Florida counties 30% fully vaccinated range counties high 80% range. strange fucking state. Well look fucking Bane here! Lah dee fucking dah!

I'm wondering UK public health policy seems promoting (including removal restrictions, anecdotes I've heard), vaxxed, good, live life.

Yes, people need vaccinated. Yes, regions keep eye hospitals perhaps think proactively, instead reactively. But, need figure way move.  she‚Äôs considering tougher restrictions? long cases spreading? local schools around masks optional here. hate idea masks end all.

No, haven‚Äôt left 1800‚Äôs yet, sorry.  Maybe worms brains? surprising. Like life imploded. getting vaccinated protect others, patients students

It's black white though.

Being vaccinated still reduce likelihood infect others, 99% certainly significant amount.

Additionally, choose get vaccinated, there's far greater risk end consuming spot ICU ward could've used someone else. Damn communists. comedy, great one. Biology rocket science, least yet. Though happy get mRNA vaccines, least they're legit innovation. post full AI brainwashed people????

Healthcare workers worked year without vaccine without mask early days fine.

Let people decide. take not. choice life.

Let get straight, person decide abortion vaccine. Full horse shit.  posting fb going ""I hope see storms hurricane"" I'm smacking head.

Let people decide!!!  Everybody wants die meet Jesus ASAP. know that? 

Everyday pray last day earth heaven instead. thought everybody believed way trucks for? 1200 cases today NSW - increase 200 day before. Nothing control there. NZ fine. We‚Äôve done again.

Take care internet stranger don‚Äôt understand working year without vaccine without mask early days vaccine mandatory??? 
GTF Out.
Let people decide do. 

Since Gov. cares health???  I'm also left leaning feel same. lot people otherwise agree politically tear say say things like want wear masks forever.

I practically first line vaccine available me, I've masking diligently told to. discourse gotten insane. ""Breaking society"" good way put it.  Exactly. fine. I‚Äôm little confused. would want standing next one hit car, might increase odds hit. would want standing car car accident, I‚Äôd rather sitting buckled in, really wouldn‚Äôt want even risk sitting next driver crashing car danger level increases. someone standing sinking ship, don‚Äôt want standing next them. trained could risky swim help someone struggling water.

I‚Äôm trying chew out. think missed part conversation. I‚Äôm trying understand. 

Ive stood rooms confined cases vaccination. Standing crashing car sounds way risky. Maybe typo sitting car accidents also sounds risky.

Maybe proximity example would better something drowning car crashes. proximity standing next someone drinking bleach danger (long fumes strong) title awful feed fire antivax antimask  think that's one verifiable things (lots certain dates). honest, states already know vaccinated. imagine checking teachers health care workers' names giant list, investigate cards discrepancy. Go Jesus R0 thought 6-7. means anything short \~85% immunity (whether natural vaccines) going growth cases places back normal. either places rapid growth anywhere near 85% immunity Delta even infectious think is. We‚Äôre vaccinating close 100 thousand people day. issue was/is supply. Never anxiety before. Even 8 years EMS. used boat rescue, search rescue, swat, loved attention. Boarded boat last week panic attack. literally 30 min ferry calm waters. Anxiety attack business trip last week. another anxiety attack entered full restaurant yesterday. seriously worried. relocated pandemic fucking hard know anyone 8 hours time zone friends family. I'm going talk doctor Tuesday. seriously can't anymore need help. fucking sucks  Ahahaha! P r e c h Yes, forgot add that. Canada comparable, actually country fewer cases 3 points lower Denmark vaccinations moment, Denmark crossed 70% mark we're 67%. However guys seem ahead us lifting restrictions, people going maskless now, expected Delta surging especially schools starting soon? Canada poised surge delta cases among unvaccinated could strain hospitals again, however believe part, assuming vaccination, severity covid successfully mitigated decoupled case counts.

I attended info session epidemiologist who's advisory boards last week saying rate delta spread, we'll likely encounter variant within 12 months, however vaccinated risk severe infection low, terms transmissibility vaccines 60-70% effective. made point illustrate situation unvaccinated changed delta, whereas could rely level herd immunity avoid virus, clear decision virus vaccine. predict insignificant portion us mask non pandemic times going forward like Asia. recently protect family member household fell ill (not covid) managed catch 3 family members caught it. cat tolerate meds given. 

Ironically cooperate treatments. Anything mouth struggle. refuses food spiked phosphorus binders. hates kidney food eats regular wet food. 

But little lovable asshole settles jab, gives one mew needle goes in, otherwise cooperates full 15 minutes daily. 

I count blessings. None give right behave has. wants run president God help everyone wins. Seriously. unvacced people simply deal daily basis.

Even vaccine, odds there's plethora things make unhealthy around. FDA announcement, company implementing, maintaining, controlling satisfactory quality management system.

That's reason. Working medical device industry, complaint quality management system could mean anything forgetting ask CEO sign certain forms simply selling adulterated unsafe products. 

However realistically, think like quality management system period, meaning keep track changes risk analyses make sure masks still functional. FDA's website mention anything specific, would assume would gone warning letter something less strict safety Agreed. went concert Northeast vaccine testing requirement. mask requirement, literally 1% people saw masks on. South may worst comes right thing, rest country much better. traveled Europe recently amazing see place people actually follow rules. felt much safer live state relatively low infection rate (keyword: relatively). Yes do! 


You know we're debating mandates, efficacy vaccines right? Yep. besides coaching part. lived days. Even shittiest days could go unwind friends, drink, play sand instantly improve mood. I'm going motions shell started. opt monoclonal cocktail even [high group?  someone PTSD, depression, anxiety, whole bunch trauma.... I'm scared pandemic done brains many people. would never wish anyone else... that's is. PTSD sustained survival mode. 

Part little relieved maybe people start understand like. known much more. 300x new bit. thinks breeding. like that! 

I started calling OG Covid article.

‚ÄúThe original one L strain, appeared Wuhan December 2019. first mutation -- strain -- appeared beginning 2020, while, since mid-January 2020, strains V G. date strain G widespread: mutated strains GR GH end February 2020. Strain G related strains GR GH far widespread, representing 74% gene sequences analyzed,""

Since ‚ÄúG‚Äù became widespread mostly saw US, OG made sense me, lol. He‚Äôs fucking dickhead. ""Once pandemic over"" 

...is one going tell unlikely ever end? 

Unless *actually* shut (yes, even vaccinated) probably stay. vaccinated tested well? Since catch spread would wiser test actually sick symptoms get brain fog lose career hopes staying single forever that, government that's saying hospitalizations deaths matter reimburse that? Yeah that's thought. Become traveling nurse. Huge money right now. believe courts already ruled private companies require vaccines. suppose want earn paycheck addition paying lawyer try?? might need bake gay wedding cakes. ""that's neat part - don't"" killing constituents count something right?  agree points, it‚Äôs need nuance comes vaccines. Everyone get vaccinated even high vaccination pandemic still kill people. Israel‚Äôs hospitalizations deaths include vaccinated. 

Vaccines magic bullet. could Delta threw everything window. Responsible governments around world mandatory mask wearing regular testing quarantine, even vaccinated people.

All deaths elderly vaccinated except one myriad health issues including end-stage renal failure.

It's true majority cases mild feeling absolutely nothing. triple digits mass testing tbh, without testing, probably single low double digits one would feel sick therefore one going doctor.

The problem population split two groups - panic cry tougher (yet maybe unnecessary) measures whenever there's sudden rise cases, saying opening case numbers may high condition patients mostly stable.

I know good amount people good, mind can't accept right now. Floridians elected moron deal outcome/ There's nothing special gotten vaccinated. immune system vaccination prevent 70-90% infections, reduce severity others maybe 70%, still leaves risk. What‚Äôs protocol you‚Äôre fully vaccinated come contact someone tested positive? still carry unless get symptoms change? This. ICU nurses covid caregivers highly vaccinated.

1) big data set (of order 10,000 patients)
2) plausible non outrageous conclusions

I also got new dog forced show life. username  Make America Dark Ages Ya know, *real* shame established nurses routinely harass new graduates profession.

I've seen it. I've experienced it. knock support new nurses. sounds simple even take year minimum whole process (determination escape variant dangerous/spreading enough get custom new shot, new mrna vaccine created test-run, kind shortened/lower volume Stage 1/2/3 testing, EAA, manufacturing, distribution, time inject population). means another year lockdowns, travel, masking, stores closed etc. we'd literally back square 1.... Ignoring fact already voluntarily carry tracking devices pockets. wonder who'll brew deadlier child killing variant, Texas Florida :-/ Whenever hear that, want say, ‚ÄúVery kids died ... ‚Äú Lots. microdosing help. Macrodosing help too, time time (with proper set setting). trips helped remember life worth living. Idk let ask this. really want know? better knowing this? wish best. \*\*cry's florid , Okaloosa county(red capitol pan handle :( ) everyone even big truck like mudding im educated think republicans self one else!!! (i mean politicians btw)\*\* irony people actually refused free covid-19 vaccine cos thought poison, willingly paying ingesting literal poison body like pill ""cure"" covid. brains really works backwards. 2020 2021 2022? smash mouth return year? Yeah don‚Äôt get nurses smoke obese yet roll eyes home hospice patient smokes outside home oxygen house. Ugh, glass houses anyone? dare say, they're actually anti-christs. told vaccine mandate results people getting vaccinated getting vaccinated sooner? Oregonian here. support believe heart improve gone. Ahhh yes actually, right. That's good distinction make.  personally care. wish NZ luck zero relevance rest world. country completely unique situation. WINNING! LOL. love never bother erase histories posting. obtuse.

Obesity contagious. know get covid once, right? Right? want fix staffing problem, let's look wages, bottlenecks education systems, student debt, workplace bullying, low retention rates bad management.

And, course, simple yet devastating demographic curve boomers reaching retirement age information updated august 18th. pulled CDC. direct CDC link like. Updated aug 25th. also google covid deaths usa true. courses research-oriented. Meaning, conducting research truly understanding science. Lost Coast area one oddest places we‚Äôve stayed appreciable amount time in. .... gonna over, right? You‚Äôre hearing stats wrong. get infected, you‚Äôre still able spread (though window infectious shorter), still fairly massive drop chances getting infected first place.

The vaccines absolutely protective, seemingly completely sterilizing anymore. Stevie Wonder saw coming. mean, yea? will?

A vaccine reduces chances dying 90% seems like absolute brainer take, even 100% effective preventing infection....

We avoid safety features elsewhere society 100%. Keep mind vaccine effectiveness seems wane 4-6 months mRNA. lot people walking around without care world, vaccine effectiveness might somewhere around 40-60%. True mean like 5,000 family members lost 9/11 600k lost pandemic US alone. feel like much deeper impact - even 9/11 culturally important event. pandemic worldwide, 9/11 really. recession pretty worldwide many people fine. pandemic forced everyone change go life. really think end one important events modern history look back. Like WWII something. I‚Äôm glad things going well brothers sisters north! Love guys. think Canadian populace wasn‚Äôt infected misinformation BS like were? Really wondering here. peer reviewed? one saying 1000x not. 

It‚Äôs almost certainly way way higher, would nice peer reviewed data. People gonna get antibodies one way other! think breakthrough content? We‚Äôve known age risk factor Covid since January 2020.

You‚Äôre adding important information you‚Äôre already pedalling bullshit comments. interest, know vaccination numbers adults specifically?  That‚Äôs primarily vaccination. older person likely vaccinated younger person. really don‚Äôt know comments misunderstand numbers get upvoted. one wants lay opinions. think indoor spread. Sturgis people stopping using restaurants staying hotels. Concerts sporting events almost exclusively outside, covid seems spread well outdoors.  sturgis spread probably restaurants/hotel.

okay interesting, makes lot sense. realise heavy component Sturgis restrictions already extremely tough. There's really much do.

The fact already know answer question means clue about. you, hopefully, know outdated inaccurate due newer strains significantly higher impacts among younger people.  Yes, factual time, outdated information clearly trolling post something know outdated. absolutely true. Watch. Interesting, understanding also somewhere neighbourhood 90% new cases US Delta cases, roughly equally transmissible, regardless vaccination status too. 

In general, odd. feel ilke Lolla glossed lot. truly knows would guess requiring tests/vax cards, masks indoors, mostly outdoor event. Covid spread well outside; sturgis spread probably restaurants/hotel. 

But I'm sure know lollapalooza spread, since contact trace well. see there. He‚Äôs giving people far much credit actual reason. They‚Äôre damn selfish. Ask away. asked entrust children care person. I'm glad thought process mine. Antivaxxers using study spread bias. Face fear, it‚Äôs cathartic, big one mind you, like passing fear hights go bungy jump, spiders, learn pick one up, talking group, go AA thing tell story strangers. You‚Äôll feel better God save them. Not. stupidity kill them. empathy. Dated Honestly think Abbott DeSantis death match see blinks first.

Whomever blinks first pointed 2024 ""no true Republican"", potentially Republican nomination President going one enact ""restrictions"" first.

It's beyond fucked up, honestly see reason would completely ignoring COVID states actively making worse. Boooo. Yeah no, really. feel like lot people turned alcohol recently resulted wave new alcoholics.  Sadly giving bike culture bad rap. riders morons. I‚Äôve seen similar stories like Italian man forced eat pineapple pizza. Died couple hours later . really hard stay home 14 days. money issue gov give $450 wait test results $1500 test positive isolate. Fuck guy chart lists 0-17 0-18 like stat mentioned. Sad. lady angrily stamp elevator leave asked keep mask on. even yelled leaving ""I can't keep damn thing on!!"" coughing. (This hospital, Covid exposure inevitable now.) can't risk it, need protected. stuff comes regular sick pay am. Lollapalooza 90% vaccinated required tests weren‚Äôt. feel post science science sub....... US write easily forged piece paper seal anything make officialü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è many conservatives, simply lack empathy others New Zealand gets serious is, acting accordingly. Right US? wish semblance contact tracing accountability. want end like Oregon right (where am). Shit's insane.  Okay honestly, why? What's difference? guess precautions taken...? 

I'm fully vaccinated, fully immunization records mandated, fully vaccinations mandated workplaces. I'm confused this. What's difference Lolla this? people partaking behaviour? would assume Lolla packed closer this. dunno. Shocking.  
/s think study suggests boosters alone enough, meaning masks social distancing along boosters required try overwhelm hospitals. Masks still needed even gotten booster, still spread virus.  someone pfizer, like bit tightness pressure chest, shortness breath, getting joint head pains probably result pumping blood efficient Literally Taliban say well. Ffs.. OP mouse controls lot things, water sanitation ain't one. #ShroomsüåàüçÑ Florida man.

Good riddance. innocent victims traumatized workers health care break heart. 7 year old adopted little brother currently rejecting kidney transplant, I'm actively terrified every single day. I've got emotional energy spare unbelievable morons. Can't tell trolling

Occam's razor, buddy understand immunology, medicine generally, science cases ""An alleged Covid-19 fugitive arrested charged string offences tested positive disease allegedly going run.""

Is really standard want everyone wants vaccine get one US? I‚Äôm assuming read damn logic?  Whatever consider great. that. August 16 üòê click article, that's 80% total population, eligible ones. 

And there's question vaccine effectiveness (against death least) - we've deadliest month pandemic 18 Covid deaths (out total 55 pandemic), almost unvaccinated seniors. No. Sharks. Covid part is/was manageable

For now. probably gonna get hand eventually too.  would something interesting watch next weeks (especially school starting) think much it.....as someone watching numbers closely months quite common revise numbers sometimes plain errors imagine sometimes states reporting correctly guess.   encounters enormous hostility unvaccinated **patients**.

Breakthrough cases rare, even happen vast majority lead serious illness, even get infected vaccinated immune system prevents getting sick.

Those get sick breakthrough infection almost exclusively elderly serious health conditions cancer heart disease.  treat planet poorly, treats us poorly back.

The planet fine, may Title be: ""teacher kills kids family members"" Oh, you‚Äôre cosplaying loser?  ripe  ‚ÄúNone struck drunk driver seriously injured hospitalized.‚Äù Open war situation, Us vs mentality everywhere here. area still ""it's like flu"" sue keep paying bills vaccine side effects. 

I heard locals talking yesterday Trump reinstated....too many different realities lived simultaneously.  reading --Canada list ... Well, entirely. Part reason rapid development lot studies paused put hold barriers funding, scheduling, personnel lab time lifted specifically covid. Need set meeting top go preliminary covid results? Instead scheduling weeks schedule next day day. FDA goes backlog things requesting approval time - Covid got pushed top, first come first serve covid.

This realistic strategy every vaccine, vaccines dangerous diseases.  Yes - unless new strain much better escaping current immune responses vaccine/previous infection. (Not saying - likely isn‚Äôt - arguments sake) Say vaccines/previous infections provide protection, you‚Äôre back square one much larger ‚Äúpool‚Äù infect. case, would eventually outcompete Delta delta ‚Äúburn through‚Äù people effect new strain would have.    [study study also important limitations. **The main weakness self-selection study participants.** Potential participants  contacted  health insurance company (newsletter, letter)  using online result, true response rate cannot determined and, despite large size, study sample may reliably represent entire population, since participants self-selected volunteers rather random sample selected  specific sampling frame.  likely  persons  higher risk  past  current infection overrepresented  study,  would lead  overestimation  absolute seropositivity prevalence rate.

So 50% likely overestimate. Also 25.3% seropositive participants PCR tested, indication self-selection bias, official numbers, 15.7% population infected, would expect much higher share seropositive participants without PCR test 50+% population infected.  Whichever transmissible would likely compete other, one ability evade vaccination natural immunity, might make transmissible vaccinated immune populations.  observation anecdotal spreading event stories. covid first started many stories gathering (choir, party, etc) person would infect many other, always lower percentage. Like 6 people 60 person choir caught it.  

Nowadays delta, see stories percent infected much higher, like 50% here. Delta seems way way contagious. Vaccination protects person vaccinated. Collectively effect thats individual level. person city get vaccinated, still receive benefits. 

Also would covid vaccination affect another vaccination program?

You say debate complicated dont see it. vaccinate kids protect severe covid complications. Thats it. 

I think way media talks protecting others via vaccination muddied waters people getting confused. Vaccines go body. effects firstly body. protection applies you. get vaccinated yourself. want consider society family etc. dont care want visit grandparents thats good reason any. think reason good reason rhetorically think get vaccinated protect elderly strangers isnt strong people wont get vaccinated protect family   death something decreased window time patient spread virus, Coronavirus window already really huge.  treat planet poorly, treats us poorly back.

Yeah answered question. threshold mask mandates things start. America penis. 

You currently 1000 new cases. America reported 200000. course need mask mandates. Sure long term maybe. short term, something could easily arise escapes current immunity would start top. Also, seem imply I‚Äôm saying hypothetical strain would make people *very sick*, never said such. could even weaker people like allay fears love mention.

Rather doctors simply putting believe cause death reporting information CDC reporting outlets(like states done throughout pandemic).

Vaccinated people stopped wearing mask immediately. Unvaccinated people spite. Another mutation. gonna lie, I'm curious name they'll give one. ü§î possible, becomes dominant variant current vaccines stop effective. that's lot speculation. one 100% sure vaccine like one flu, requiring yearly boosters, like HPV, covers worst strains cause cancer, like Polio, eradicate virus completely. economists statisticians techniques measure unobservables.

Ah yikes üòî Apparently docs like one something it. would deadly virus likely take hold? someone works outpatient case manager sincerely applaud efforts bedside covid. patients families lucky you. 
I would say make absolute sure put first. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre Florida overflowing case/ care manager positions away bedside. always go back bedside future need break. obviously seen numbers. Apologies successful. try fail future. Well make unit probably making sense day two deteriorate. patients verge intubation, bipap high flow oxygen. get hypoxic confused pull things, tie wrists bed sedate them. Hope you‚Äôre right  deaths Japan, impressive.

US deaths 637k.

Botched job contractor. really fire anti-vaxx nutters. always expect newest variant mutated? Like, time accumulate mutations. ridiculous wasteful. vast majority people don‚Äôt need third shot right now. Donate doses, greedy rich countries. C.1.2 variant first detected South Africa mutated compared original virus known variant.

So mean transmissible Delta, assume does. Think we're hoping transmissible, less deadly variant push Delta.

I barely believe I'm asking this, seriously proposing option, hypothetically -- knowledge technology currently available, would possible deliberately engineer variant? Create sort vaccinating contagion dramatically reduced symptom severity spread without need deliver injections person-by-person?

Clearly would unethical crazy guaranteed provoke kind protest would make existing vaccine opposition look like polite disagreement, like thousand practical logistical problems involved beyond that, would like deliberately inviting horror-movie-style catastrophe something inevitably went wrong, still perverse curiosity purely imaginary level. NYC weeklong ‚Äúwe‚Äôre back!‚Äù Celebration culminating huge concert Central Park ‚Ä¶ end got completely rained (arguably headliners got play): relatively new hard understand tech.

Well actually work whole hospital Respiratory Therapist 20+ years experience, prior Combat Medic. really ICU. I'm literally face face full blown COVID patients, wearing mask fine.

What I'm saying take precautions protect yourself, others want protect themselves, it. get put pieces tape holds better concept, used correct type tape need keep adding more. rest take care yourself, wear mask, touch wash hands spread it, distance people ect worried walk job. added willfully unvaccinated Yes read raises questions concerns... transparency here... bet. mostly unvaccinated, probably getting ""IT'S HOAX"" ""MY FREEDOMS!"" ""I'D LIKE SPEAK MANAGER"" energy pretty much everyone comes door, yeah? lot folks selfish I‚Äôm vaccinated care pass among vaxxed choose get vaccinated?  This. 

So much this. tl;dr: Everything. I‚Äôm fine thanks. Perfectly normal life I've read, really good examples past compare to. previous pandemics records influenza pandemics, coronavirus pandemics. really know direction go. Less deadly certainly possible, deadly. someone ELI5 determining factor ""new variant COVID 19"" ""COVID 21""? Problem immuno-compromised children don‚Äôt access vaccine. affected flexibility get vaccine, effective known, flights to/from stopped I've seen sub others, ""prayer warriors"" extremely high fatality rate. ever fall ill, think want help ""prayer warriors.""  wear mask feel anything abnormal. Bam welcome living mask based preventative Japan decade. 

Have slight cough don‚Äôt dick wear mask. Masks bare minimum. vaccinated great! New strains - 90% efficacy - common sense mask wearing = ok. masks + new strains + lower efficacy = square one.

Edit: it‚Äôs like western culture declared stop preventative measures once. Kids immunity STILL VACCINATED PEOPLE.  think people burned ready enjoy normalcy again. entire home double-vaccinated, including children. extended family double-vaccinated. office 100% vaccinated (those must remote). wife 90% remote office 100% vaccinated.

However...school session kids, 5 days week, person, distancing (masks required though). business functions back me; board meetings, vendor events, golf outings, hosted sports outings, dinners, etc. much we're interfacing really see point masking. would need removed ton considering crammed together places now, help much all.

So least combination ""at least protection available"" ""there's nothing much else let shit run course""

Of note, I'm San Diego, CA. could wrong I‚Äôm pretty sure don‚Äôt really get less effective reuse, careful bacterial growth. like 5-10 use one couple days, cycle others air disinfect. protect vulnerable. child 12 received vaccine there's single one made choice themselves. true Got it. basically delta's run lose, new variant thrive better spreader delta. applies well delta's ""offsprings"". say somehow ruins nominating potential RNC 2024. long.  2 4?

Read articles post. hail capitalist overlords. May ascend heavens rockets. US made critical mistake showing national news daily reality virus. Hell, make state motto slap ""Mississippi: Uniquely Unprepared"" license plates. Fine, sit home wait ticket eternal life, instead clogging hospitals. 


Religious folks always fall-back option. arguing close relative climate change, pointed good studies showing dire situation getting. relatives final resting spot ""Well, End Times coming soon anyway."" Great, bother trying...I hate attitude. unprecedented get many deaths despite vaccine freely available. want rush life though. That‚Äôs cop out. It‚Äôs like saying it‚Äôs ok I‚Äôm jerk life, I‚Äôm forgiven.  It‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs coming from. There‚Äôs huge cohort anti-mask/restrictions anti-vax folks think ban news talking covid, ban masks everywhere, open everything back fully, let virus wash us take it‚Äôs going take.

They believe that‚Äôll get us back 2019 normal quickest.

They don‚Äôt like told ‚Äúthat absolutely work.‚Äù

So kind messaging goes beliefs they‚Äôll downvote brigade bots. calm guys, stop doomsday calling. plenty variants discovered yet since many people got infected. Mutation something bad. Spike protein also mutate point fit ACE Receptors, meaning attack cells. See spanish flu example. shit mutated dangerous anymore. end Virus interested spreading killing. 

We almost got every 2 Weeks news variant could escape immune response stuff (not even scientific paper btw). headlines sells good, thats many using it. Right Delta biggest problem, meaning Vaccination top prio every country.  empty shelves, believe every photo see internet. still explain low mask usage. fact think capitalism would promote since reduces infection rates, therefore less need quarantines, less fear going out, etc therefore less reduction economic activity.  mean could go huge rant hospital doesn‚Äôt post agency shifts well hospitals (and secure nurses) literally 100 ways making staffing difficult.

Hope find relief soon. areas low vaccination rates high infection rates, infections provide least immunity.

If vaccines all, virus would still run eventually, get infected become immune. human immune system works. course without vaccines lot illness time.

There areas like North Dakota still high level vaccination also much increase cases since single huge wave end last year. explanation people caught immune, also population relatively sparse. Yeah Christchurch 5-6 hour wait get tested start lockdown. Pretty piss poor planning. lollapalooza end causing surge? Serious question. data Germany [the original RKI vaccine reporting tables:

Vaccine breakthrough cases significantly common four weeks report came compared entire reporting period since February (due Delta variant 99%).  
In last weeks, **15.6%** cases breakthrough cases (meaning people **tested positive** full course vaccination). Considering 60% German population fully vaccinated (65% least one dose), confirms high efficacy vaccines symptomatic disease 80% found elsewhere.  
Asymptomatic transmission may course bit higher. 


This also confirmed looking breakdown current infection rates vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. 
For instance, Bavaria, according [most recent 111 cases per 100,000 unvaccinated 9 per 100,000 vaccinated. figure 78 per 100,000 vs. 3.3 per 100,000.

Exactly. ""main cause second surge"" 100% speculation.  Yep pretty stark examples.

However something think debatable CDC's response whole thing, information they've distributed how. mixed consistent? desired effect? example say ""vaccinated people still get infected"", probably trying get people vaccinated remain cautious. they're sowing seeds doubt effectiveness vaccine absolutely wrong thing do.

There also lot discussion debate numbers mean exactly. One thing learned pandemic tragic inability people understand communicate statistics, includes leaders, press, laypeople. think discussion around would really help lot people. Again?

HIPAA usa GPDR EU unfortunately prevents hospitals providing detailed info (without patient consent)  also shows comorbidities died attempt murder one knows sure, although boosters far looking pretty good. Odds it'll mutate again, since several major ""bad"" mutations already (the UK variant, south African variant, Delta variant) worldwide scale, cases certainly slowing appreciable way, latest wave roughly equivalent winter one slightly less bad April one. yeah, lots lots cases ongoing basis seems like it'll probably mutate again. There's still legitimate hope could mutate ""favorable"" way, though. Lots viruses mutate toward becoming less deadly, one still could too. 0.3% could also somewhat misleading positive. vaccine cannot physically stop virus entering body. exposed immune system kicks fights would even notice, could test positive tested right time. really case though? Dissent part Reddit foundation democracy. Reddit place open authentic discussion debate. includes conversations question disagree popular consensus. includes conversations criticize disagree majority opinion.

I personally agree 100%. really see problem debating sides issue, debate always majority minority. bad information misinformation posted unopposed provide platform information distributed. debate sides issue represented. Noted. Thanks. It‚Äôs gonna get *bad* bad No, non diseases changed dormant period spread. Also could dormant highly lethal given enough time. could also become infectious enough spread despite dormant period (smallpox, plague etc). simply can't predict covid severity increasing decreasing, minor trait compared transmissiblity   That‚Äôs FOWL! one health department/agency US, like 50, thus unison organized research. doubt much effort going tracking mutations. Y'all still fighting putting mask. recall reading less deadly strains likely win strains give highly serious symptoms result people getting killed off/hospitalized/quarantined spread many people, whereas person infected strain gives cold-like symptoms could spread dozens people go living life. Doh! I'm gonna leave it. I'll live shame. Ah cool! Thanks! Got question experts matter here. 

Re: Delta variant. Even reached herd immunity vaccinations, delta still spread amongst society wears masks herd immune current generation vaccinations? 

My understanding delta unlike alpha still builds vaccinated people spreads like alpha hit non vaccinated person. 

An argument gf thinks even herd immunity - delta would spread. cases patient got infected two variants time? say first comment, reading confusing. thought implying found religious, got pissed. edit comments know. Thanks, hope others realize decide get help. I'm happy share helps someone else. Much less contagious.

My point hard both. South Africa round 2 40k cases vaccinated? Everyone agrees efficacy wanes time. even articles far back March said vaccine gonna 3 dose regime  enjoyed one lot actually pending legislation make women register well Ah, cool! assume reliant antarctic temperatures Comirnaty? Preach

I‚Äôm it‚Äôs job. find something else pays well amazing schedule im don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted

Because reddit, everything turned attack capitalism (or religion, ""the west"", etc).

The attacks capitalism particularly funny, given site bastion consumerism. great take - think headlines often shortened avoid long, often lead misinterpretation without reading article.

I think biggest takeaway natural immunity may, least, provide similar protection Pfizer vaccine current state (""better"" ""worse"" oversimplified way thinking it), decisions currently made assumption natural immunity myth. *disclaimer: anti-vax argument....I would prefer vaccine virus*  also know result generation suffering long-term effects and/or later effects....kind like significant increase children later developing Parkinson's Disease 1918 pandemic. 


We know. Seems precisely know, foolish let virus run free young unvaccinated strategy. well found Switzerland, England, China, places. thing probably America. Holidays gonna get nuts.  anyone checked makers portable morgues DeSantis donors?  Every case opportunity cause variants. Vaccination decrease cases opportunities new variants go people get vaccinated.

The concern vaccinated people still getting infected. vaccinated people get sick virus also chance create variant. variant created vaccinated person likely vaccine resistant. shouldn‚Äôt really surprising anyone. natural selection virus scale.

Could vaccine resistant variant fueled vaccination? Maybe. virus become major player yet. vast majority cases worldwide delta evolved mass vaccination. county variant last year, significant enough concern even name it. got wiped Delta. India mostly uses Astrazeneca. approxiamately 630 million doses given India, 550 million Astrazeneca, 75 million covaxin (thats vaccine developed India) use sputnik. entire breakdown feel badly many want masks safety measures, desire live like this. think study forgets one thing: covid infection filtering event way vaccines not. already died Covid study. filters elderly immunocompromised one group. freedom strain live Georgia, Dekalb currently live county bordering it. get vaccine CVS Walgreens without wait free. It‚Äôs sad people paid wait 6 hours get it‚Ä¶ anger promote beneficial dialogue.

Sure does. Religious people disproportionally believing nonsense making pandemic say evolution apart God's design?

Me. Adding ""God it"" everything science explains pointless, simply assumed Christians unable think critically 

Not bad assumption given thread response close minded obtuse 

""I know I?!?"" Quite opposite, cases; vast majority mutations die quickly they're less fit.

If something already good (and SARS-CoV-2 good infecting people replicating), easy make worse hard make better. contributed tons. variants fit. Realistically 3 4 significantly outpaced orginal strain. I‚Äôm sure causing much divide hysteria. means close nothing you‚Äôre lucky enough gotten covid gotten away without long term symptoms, you‚Äôre pretty good place moving forward. idea vaccines aren‚Äôt important immunity doesn‚Äôt last long ignores clear data natural infection causes much harm getting fully vaccinated catching virus.

Pro vaccine folks, large majority, needs relax stop defensive this. changes nothing terms importance vaccines. message yes natural immunity great, getting infection unvaccinated dangerous thing. NFL going start testing vaccinated players, symptomatic not, need revisit decision forfeits due covid. ask team get vaccinated, give loss vaccinated players becoming infected causing game cancellation? isn‚Äôt even flu season yet. start hitting November we‚Äôre going see get worse.   uh hell im taking random shitty countries version vaccine lol also seem think people magically don‚Äôt work actually anything socialism. fucking infuriating!!!

We simply new social norms secure rights important freedoms.  still saying ‚Äústanding‚Äù ‚ÄúDriver‚Äù referring person vehicle standing, lack clarity. confusing point. I‚Äôve standing near car crasher ‚Äústanding‚Äù pedaling bike crash moved next behind location. injured next crash crash moves injured. crash moving thing ‚Äúnext to‚Äù might temporary next crash safe.

You moved driving past crash happened . bit confusing something happens. I‚Äôm sure walked room infected person been. time passed droplets longer air. time passes covid cough zone car crash zone eventually risk level decrease.

Are trying say average covid cough range covers distance average loss vehicle control point impact distance?

Are trying say car crashes impact happens fast covid droplets would air longer time loss control vehicle moment impact?

Is point duration longer path destruction car crash shorter covid cough?


I‚Äôve rooms infected pre vaccine 20-40 hours easily physical harm infection. seconds impact crash moves next physical harm.

I think biggest lack clarity different perceptions definition car crash. define car crash moment location car stops moving define car crash moment driver loses control everything hits way would different definitions lack clarity conversation.

If LA define car crash bad merge accident bumper bumper traffic I‚Äôm Iowa define car accident 70 car winter pileup talking totally different things say car want debate convince people perspectives would recommend better define car crash ready one different definition.

Oh, thought Biden supposed take DeSantis‚Äôs lead? important thing hospitalizations deaths kept low, something vaccines still successfully.

Against universal health care. refugees fleeing war zones dangerous living conditions. food poor families. life saving vaccines. masks CHILDREN pandemic that's killing kids. gun control schools get shot up. Etc. 

They literally Pro-Death labeled so. I‚Äôm talking humans, exhibit universal human flaws everywhere, doesn‚Äôt matter country ""I‚Äôm completely sure reference mass vaccination risks risks posed previous infection non-Delta strains, would think concerns would apply.""

This complicated understand fully, thinking thing.  agree this, depressed 2018-19, I'd started ""come back"", covid hit point, know believe to; I've trying convince get better last 3 - 4 years, I'm right time, know ""come back"" truly enjoy even ability realize I'm ""good time"". 

Maybe I'm already better stage feel like it, what's point better? Sounds dorky, frankly.  Yep, anxiety (because COVID) also freshly diagnosed PTSD breaking one bipolar psychopath summer. hate wanna relationship anymore. sorry! even like guys get trial run original Covid-19, far easier handle. unforgiving Delta variant, another aggressive variant now. hope deal better States, despite asshole governor loony anti-vaxxers. angry.  Florida: farther north go ‚Ä¶  good thing changed counting deaths, kick rug. fix accepting pandemic already covid stay. Make logical risk assessments act accordingly. Adaptation key survival, matter circumstances. Fear hell drug, perhaps worst drug. two kids pandemic. Thank God took care problem. want grow world  brain? mean capitalistic autopilot? Yes they're taking others along them.  Personally put 19 year old dog August 2019 things got worse.  ‚ù§Ô∏è mind won‚Äôt know peace til finally delete Reddit Twitter, social media. 

Sucks cause nowhere else discuss Pok√©mon, funkos, wrestling sick brain always drifts news subs sub. dont self control limit subreddits :/ Sure is. Hugs. knows? never asked. Buy book. it‚Äôs mostly one state premier doesn‚Äôt understand doing. this, fucked us. real. example, someone kind respected early 2020 ended posting things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care many old geezers die, want get back life‚Äù Facebook. It‚Äôs really quite jarring realize little people give shit well-being others there‚Äôs nothing personally them. Iowa here. exact conversation would happen hospital literally across street Kinnick Stadium. There‚Äôd UPROAR anything ever happened precious football hospital expand use field. üôÑ two weeks already?

Surprisingly, according Worldometers, daily cases seem slightly compared last year. Still far winter peak. holy shit, actually mind blowing stat rally, took place Aug. 7-16 2020, brought together 462,000 people 61% U.S. counties

now got wondering event highest percentage US counties represented, might well  mean side effects? ahot 2 still pre-COVID job nobody family died. I'm still completely overwhelmed. Nobody monopoly depression. So, plausible possible??? Maybe use statements apply yourself? Dealing covid-19 definitely making mentally unhealthy. I‚Äôm 17 feel like missed teenage years. almost friends. hate much. idea like high school online year half? didn‚Äôt contact anyone age like year! want make friends. badly. That‚Äôs really fucking hard pandemic. Maybe social distancing quarantine didn‚Äôt hurt mental health. That‚Äôs great. bullshit narrative. It‚Äôs easy. 

I‚Äôm lucky live democratic city people care wearing masks, seriously, stop pretending like COVID isn‚Äôt big deal. word mind lot recently enjoyed able use it. appreciate sentiment enough.  mental health got significantly better due lock downs. fact influential people society ‚Ä¶ less fortuitous rest us. Good response paper (and another) One studies purely vitro, signs ADE among millions recovered people billions vaccinated people, there's little evidence support that. study experimental data all; based purely models they're suggesting even shown occur cells, let alone humans. mechanism papers suggesting happening real world, would expect see higher infection rates higher instances severe disease among recovered vaccinated immunologically naive, exact opposite occurring. vitro studies molecular simulations particularly valuable face mountains real-world data have. read ""tiny pieces metal"", confirmed back then. ""there near zero chance causing substantial health damage"". suppose going killing eachother Covid eventually. Seems like survivors healthy enough ride again. carry oxygen tank Harley? know. chance move visa 22 years ago. chose Bay Area instead (now live Oregon). hate myself. Maybe good news. die trying. want give award concatenation I've tried let me. Wow love word! shit work downtown Seattle got traumatized alone city screamers cops help anything happened. made 2020 half job 2021 started weird health issues turned spinal arthritis. 2021 almost worse hope dumb dumbs seems like Biden going much help. least last year know body going massive problem. Choices form freedom, require responsibility. understand saying. I've felt times. I'm rewarded pushing past comfort zone. You‚Äôre getting downvoted NZ crew you‚Äôre right. Testing NZ isn‚Äôt nearly comprehensive China.  We'll always new zealand he's Vietnam, averaging 400 deaths day, who's vaccine rollout barely existant. Bizzare. I'll try explain findings:

The mutations Delta's N-terminal domain, region spike, abrogates neutralizing activity existing NTD specific antibodies (e.g. vaccine people infected version apart Delta). Instead antibodies may enhance infection activity binding not-neutralizing there.

The bioRxiv paper linked also shows behaviour experiments. authors speculate Delta already could achieve quite breakthrough infections enhancing infectivity vaccinated recovered people.

So, holds true upcoming variant even mutations relevant sites could tip scales favor enhancing antibodies meaning may neutralizing antibodies vaccine recovered, might (I emphasize proved vitro yet) fact enhance infection (Dengue prominent example).  think people can‚Äôt spread covid grocery stores? never said NZ‚Äôs response ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt good enough‚Äù. They‚Äôve done well. even article mentions, tougher restrictions should‚Äôve considered. like last year?  numbers:

In total, covid made 0.7% children deaths. last year, 0.9%. last month, 2.8%. 

Yes, original covid big risk death children schools virtual dealing WT/Delta. Seems like risk death coming covid since Delta wave quite bit higher schools started opening couple weeks ago, may deaths result infections day 1 schools reopening. moderna vaccine dev team travel 9 months peak Covid, couldn‚Äôt see anyone time. co worker died getting Covid traveling genuinely accepted fate. stopped taking care bother im going die? worth though, someone don‚Äôt kids someone dependent me. contract ended months ago usually another lined immediately after, get severe panic attacks thinking traveling another large surge I‚Äôm living savings getting therapy. lack human contact terrible enough. didn‚Äôt mind spending Christmas verifying data, ordering take thanksgiving eat family FaceTime me, vaccine going help make future holidays possible. didn‚Äôt reach herd immunity time, year likely repeat. diagnosed complex PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc. mental health resources severely lacking ready onslaught people needing help.  One thing Pandemic taught people don‚Äôt understand calculate risk assessment. wouldn‚Äôt even take bottle. someone another medication (especially antidepressant antipsychotic), could easily get adverse reaction it.   one single comment celebrates I've panic attacks general anxiety 20+ years getting lot worse now. Bold assume ever end. OMG. Sending love internet stranger. hope parents pull through. 
Assessing antibody affective time different variants mRNA-1273 (Moderna)

Only 8 random samples age group, margin error could quite high take grain salt.

Some notes:

-	You definitely need second dose two dose vaccines. Antibodies 8% effective Beta 29 days, 54-58% two weeks second dose (43 days). Note: simple vaccine efficacy, percentages still neutralizing levels.
-	These similar results BNT162b2 (Pfizer): performs worst Beta; variants 88%-96% 43 days
-	Antibodies still effective 209 days (6 months)
-	Early results booster original Moderna new Moderna variant booster (mRNA-1273.351) encoding B.1.351 (Beta) spike shows promise boosting antibody response Beta variants. Thank you. Pre-delta.

It‚Äôs still effective preventing hospitalisation, effective preventing death. Wasn‚Äôt expected? Sorry, Australia. Truly. bright light pandemic. ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs starting two weeks already?

Surprisingly, according Worldometers, daily cases seem slightly compared last year. Figure 2025  laboratory evidence suggests antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination provide better neutralization circulating variants natural infection (1,2), real-world epidemiologic studies exist support benefit vaccination previously infected also yet crystal clear whether immunity contracting COVID-19 powerful protection vaccine. evident available vaccines mount crucial defenses severe disease death‚Äîeven contagious variants Delta.

These links say natural immunity. CDC study compares recovered + vaccinated vs recovered + unvaccinated far understood.

The OP study contradict one. says recovered + unvaccinated persons better protection non-recovered + vaccinated ones. 

This means vaccinating recovered patients boost immunity, question ask even necessary. Considering already fare better purely vaccinated people, would risk complications vaccine, risk complications covid already pretty darn low them. Right?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* feel like time free restrictions. Downer Minister party holds government benches Australia's national parliament. therefore surprising mention disgraceful mismanagement vaccine acquisition. Let introduce Mr. Keiran Schneeman, Downer knows. Mr Schneeman senior staffer two Downer's colleagues, continued work Canberra paid lobbyist pharmaceutical industry manager government affairs Astra Zeneca. many months, Australian government made attempt source vaccines anywhere else. Australia months behind vaccinating people therefore poorer position manage Delta strain. Reading comments, main argument NZ like Vietnam letting people visit supermarkets. lockdown working way spread virus mostly happening within bubbles. concerning virus spreads essential workplaces. Supermarket spread right low risk along people exercising outside/walking. Taiwan interesting comparison. almost population, though much higher population density, Taiwan avoided lockdowns rapidly consistently implementing ‚Äúhighly organized mass testing, contact tracing, public messaging selective quarantining identify isolate outbreaks.‚Äù far, looks like almost gotten last spike three months moderate(?) public inconvenience. Despite able get in-state medical care anymore morgues full, many people going normal.

Part problem lack pictures bodies stacked morgue, patients treated carpark, etc.. Without pictures, people tend ignore reporting. 

One good example happened India start summer. People get reports overcrowded hospitals. Instead, people saw videos Indian crematoriums bodies piled high, videos people dying lack oxygen, etc.. shocked Indian people covid, Indian government thought serious matter, taking covid seriously.

This lacking right now. Photographs Tiktok videos packed hospitals, patients cannot breath, bodybags piled high funeral home, etc., widely circulated. going convince people take covid seriously, dry news reports. 1) large gatherings bad ideas.

2) Sturgis like SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND attendees. least one order power worse largest concert. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves believes religion lot region‚Äôs response COVID-19 pandemic.

I mean religion lot 9/11 hijacker's response US Middle East policy. society think using religion reason life death public policy actions reasonable? bad Texas every way possible, southern states way ahead shipping kids covid wards child hospitals? say don‚Äôt care many people die long get watch sportsball dude, least honest Really? experience Sweden. Denmark. Denmark always known informal lot jokes workspace point actually little insensitive. someone please explain me; Virologists epidemiologists continually state outdoor transmission extremely rare. open air stadiums big problem? guess people packed close? Maybe I'm reading wrong things? last 2 AMAs professionals stated outdoor transmission really problem.  Many get complaints well, since they're drawing half million people typically, individual event gets much attention specifically. People regularly complaining smaller events, SEC football stadiums requiring masks vaccines schools opened without requirements. free time pandemic? 'Deliberately killing citizens'

Not really, citizens want jabs jabs, majority citizens want restrictions now, citizens want feel way old life certainly gone. think i'm saying lot people feeling. We're bone tired, respite. Another thing lollapalooza start wave. Sturgis happened month later, meaning twice many daily cases lot presymptomatic people communities know they're spreading covid.

Another thing Illinois 14 times population. community surge lollapalooza participants crowding bars/restaurants around event, neither gets counted event (because locals anything event infected participants) cases get diluted among cases state already has. S. Dekota people/cases hide surge state population temporarily doubling event. Thank you. know, still too.. 
The biggest thing I've learned myself, **need** ton structure.. can't rely create it, need help. 

I think pandemic breakdown structure large scale what's making much worse me. starting pull out, Delta groundhogs day trying pull back under. least alone this. delivered countries ongoing outbreaks first.

Note bought Pfizer, one available stage, safest. That‚Äôs point. NZ‚Äôs position roughly two months ago too. deaths day, it‚Äôs exploded close 400 day. authenticity protocol, illustrates level severity China committed lockdowns. sense poor analogy.

Edit: Autocorrect dick. significance possible number 30. 

No hasn't. looks like Indonesia's outbreak again. assume death relevant factor comment responding death. goes without saying Sturgis rally public health disaster. don‚Äôt count covid fatalities shrink it.  I'd trade least ten 80 year old's one young person. 

At start pandenic avarage age death covid 83 years old. One year older actual avarage death. photo show football crowd flouting rules? Inaccurate headline. BVD show regular eye tests, think search specialist area testing/treatment.

[This place seems good Adventhealth sharing numbers. Adventhealth reliable, well, dunno is. Yeah, got couple Netherlands already. One explosion one time whole testlocation burned down. still think right Sturgis 2021 harmless? instead suggesting waiting longer tests(currently every 2 weeks) players test positive games get cancelled?  Ah yes, old ""we shall prove we're right completely fucking something up.""

Sadly, often least partially affective. Hopefully people place rot Hell misdeeds fellow man.  Hope keep up. seems lot countries reached 50 - 60% quite easily plateaued due anti-vaxxers selfish young people can't bothered get vaccinated. NZ would probably reach well 80% seeing population barely exposed virus before. way would know allergic it, got shot first place severe reaction within 15 minutes treatment. 

There absolutely contraindications vaccine. Even people latex allergies, egg allergies, pet dander allergies, seasonal allergies take vaccine problem. 

From read [this CDC fact there‚Äôs basically zero medical exemptions unless allergic first shot. Edit: fat thumbs [setting test clinics here. Oh lol remember comparing restrictive lockdown compared Vietnam couple weeks back. Get lol it‚Äôs competition man.

Last year news pandemic really got me. year prior 2020, purchased RV travel country. took time work 2019 couple years reevaluate career waiter. 

My boyfriend rather flippant attitude virus general. wear masks, obtained vaccine, always forgets mask wherever go. 

I started bringing him, remind got store put on. always wanted public, going eat, etc. always felt like risk catching virus.

Couple news police state mass protests went deep end. smashed one doors RV, sent parents crushing text message read filth raised child.

I ended moving temporarily past February fighting watching news pandemic general making me, well beyond paranoid borderline schizophrenia. 

I‚Äôm antidepressants feel much better it‚Äôs still hard accept injustice see going virus. ruin many always makes angry. think also anger management problems. wish could snap it. elements really close terror group. weirdos jumped gap. Surely last so. doing? feel like understand 1% works.

That's 1% cases. co-morbidity, (of Sturgis people tend see lot of) number goes WAY up.   

Additionally, assume death relevant outcome here. 30% people express symptoms long-term issues. Like... severe long-term issues. 

So... enjoy! bad trip Hawaiian shrooms 20 ago. Something time travel killing cats (they ok!). thank you. honest happen scale last year's rally. mean cases fill icu. Delta much worse.

Interestedly primary opponents Leslie Rutledge , ways loath some, advertising vaccine acceptance 

Well mostly Got really depressed, gained 30kg online courses degree suck.

Currently better mental health wise feel like I'm constantly edge. need lose weight really bothers me. mean look UK, ahead everyone else pandemic curve moment, (they delta earlier Western countries) cases declining all, although people living normal lives  India flattened curve basically everyone caught Covid 4 million weakest died much better anywhere else. Central Arkansas much even wait hours come hospital medical workers know least. 
Not mention even thier longest shifts assign double usual number patients, imagine well works still basically saying God murdered 42 people jeering someone. ""By insulting Prophet, insulting God."" guess God sensitive would thought.

Think might wanted stick good ol' ""God works mysterious ways"" one. religion become mental illness? far, 1,000 people total died Japan administered COVID-19 vaccine, health experts yet determine causal relationship receiving vaccine dying. 

That number seems awfully high. would nice get perspective. many died versus many doses given compare vaccines. devil took Jerusalem, placed pinnacle temple, saying him, ""If Son God, throw here, written, 'He command angels concerning you, protect you,' 'On hands bear up, dash foot stone.'"" Jesus answered him, ""It said, 'Do put Lord God test.'""  - Luke 4:1-13 numerous arguments it. simple decision. Vaccinating child protect adult ethically troublesome. mention vaccination programme covid may impact vaccination programs children may actually save lives.

I'm saying I'm it, saying debate complicated left experts, politicians social media. Every country portrays world beating. government minister going stand country say 'yeh country worse everyone else' they? funny seen much bigger push back people vaccinated people are. Either way choice everyone right to. could care less gets vaccine doesn't. business. problem today's society Noone seems able mind thier business. Live let live. anyone ever problem someone chose receive flu vaccine? flu caused deaths date Covid ever will. masks firings, hate Covid? There's sense this. Keep opinions summer hard.

That's nice. What's vaccination rate now? beyond saving. brain hopelessly destroyed propaganda. hope get better one day, doubt it. Maybe take globe compare New Zealand‚Äôs position world Germany.

Not every country island Pacific Ocean. Infinity 80% vaccination rate

Do source that? daughter caught something real nasty tests picking up.

While I'm vaccinated not. symptoms COVID plus hallmarks - difficulty breathing, sleepiness, swollen joints. Doctor said 90% COVID. got rapid tested, negative. 4 days later, get PCR, negative. it, got something detectable. not, single worst flu I've ever had. think public schools open in-person instruction? Kids can‚Äôt get vaccines; many won‚Äôt (especially South). 

Also, countries paid massively families workers addition single-payer healthcare policies. Millions evicted foreclosed upon government failed provide remuneration stay domicile failed give support landlords. 

Comparing US countries fruitless exercise. stand alone scores dead callousness struggling.  knew nurse said risk losing license wasn‚Äôt worth extra pay, since nurses get increased protection even though increased ratios approved (newsom / California). Everyday, headlines, different tack attack. I‚Äôm living Gish Stampede. 

Today we‚Äôre discussing covid vaccine prion diseases. I‚Äôm entertaining mother reconsidering second shot. someone smarter explain impossible? üí©üí©üí© list

Thanks; trying explain someone scoffing vary idea variants, using yearly influenza strains example, realized big blind spot one point.  lot western countries 50-75% population vaccinated.

If infect vaccinated people mostly get sick recover, deadlier unvaccinated unlikely major disadvantage it. think mix both, hard thing determine real world many variables. would tend disagree waning immunity numbers US right people vaccinated last 2-4 months. Regardless booster shot still best option point aside masking social distancing. wife's coworker obgyn nurse. far 2 pregnant patients covid. 1, mother baby died. other, baby. Sorry, you‚Äôre responsible you‚Äôre willingly exposing others disease. 

Unvaccinated adults suck I‚Äôm angry too. there‚Äôs kids 12 (like mine, take personally), there‚Äôs immunocompromised adults can‚Äôt get vaccinated, there‚Äôs exhausted health care workers still need us limit spread. Also every antivax fool ends hospital dying, taking ICU bed would otherwise go victim trauma serious illness. mention financial burden pay Medicare, taxes insurance premiums. 

This responsible people still wear masks everywhere avoid crowds. know word. TIL fixed obvious formatting error actually checked link would see England Wales Auckland still high table. nurses union. wouldn‚Äôt know it? Lol gotta get degree rEsEaRcH  what?

Based study AFAIK first provide epidemiological data recovered vs vaccinated people Covid.

The CDC study linked states natural immunity intensity duration **not known**.

This changing.

I seen German Robert Koch Institute says this. FYI Europe live recovered patients (genesene) rights vaccinated (geimpfte) ones, 6 months.

Germany recommends single-dose vaccination 6 months due *lack data* duration natural mmunity.

Denmark recognizes recovered patients 12 months hand.

But recovered patients better immunity **purely** vaccinated ones (not recovered+vaccinated) study seems suggest waiting lift time limit recognize recovered patients. God, many boss phases have? got one poorly written headlines I‚Äôve ever seen. Thought hangover no. Right!! positive news immunity hopeful whether it‚Äôs vaccine naturally   It‚Äôs arbitrary really biology largely qualitative science. Simply put, ‚Äúvariant‚Äù virus one enough changes notable ‚Äúenough‚Äù changes warrant labeling new strain virus entirely. criteria often practical sense, outcomes said virus largely differ variations it‚Äôs likely ‚Äúvariant‚Äù instead strain.

Pre-Covid easy epidemiology followed rules: ‚ÄúCase‚Äù would consistent patterns would make distinguishable Identifiable baseline health wellness conditions community, thereby becoming identifiable account differences often signs symptoms. People forget vast majority COVID cases asymptomatic since beginning. Even PCR/NAAT testing qualitative doesn‚Äôt prove disease, presence virus. 

Tl;dr it‚Äôs based perspective talk to. Biology laser accurate science it‚Äôs centered around consequences regards Health Wellness.  balance here. Nearly every state similar worse surge past couple months. possible SD would surge either way? Maybe slightly less surge? chicken pox close relative herpes. Rather get vaccine anti-vax parents chicken pox parties. actively trying infect children herpes.  percentage often small percentage. can‚Äôt speak behalf every lab, medical lab work sets aside every single COVID positive sent sequencing state lab. chances getting bitten low. said, much less chance passing virus?  head Florida, they're still acting like never even happened! Eh mean ok sure, Death subset infections can‚Äôt covid death without infection. decreases viral load decreasing amount exposed factor case severity well ie death. look infections spiked foolishly (imo) hosted olympics- delta variant wide circulation places well even hit higher viral load contagious (see New Zealand example). Masks don‚Äôt eliminate infections decrease them. It‚Äôs really rocket science here, spite current spike comparatively speaking someplace less consistent mask adoption west.. population akin Mexico, much smaller land mass, numbers compared populous state US (which spotty mask adoption culturally) numbers look better either places. California fraction population substantially cases. yeah I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre pretty well considering circumstances. capitalism requires infinite growth. different economy, political leaders pushing unsafe narratives tell people get back work get back consuming. anti-vax component population Japan something us folks US contending with? Nah, are. truly stupid idiot Perhaps, forget recombination.

Just reminder, Everyone: word apocalypse means removal masks. exactly communications issue they're facing. He's wrong he's saying, come days change guidance 6 months 5 months going feed ""they know they're keep changing minds"" narrative. would better say nothing since week half since 8 week guidance came say something interval actually changes. hospitalizing everyone covid? would someone mild even cases moderate symptoms need hospital? That‚Äôs gold! Keep up! :)  Darwinism always be. Many countries including Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan economically freer US though. So, capitalism = government lock people inside? good enough.   dishonest posting one fitness instructor died covid. That's confuses me; viruses spontaneously generate nothing--each one come preceding virus. understand delineating factor ""variant existing virus"" ""brand new virus"". like Cuba Japan well considering vaccine roll really slow zero lockdowns enforced. silly. data coming Pfizer based 6 months, 8. Israel 5 months. wait? Millions healthcare workers past 8 months, wait 9/20. Cases skyrocketing. much data bureaucracy need? administration gone ""you need boosters"" ""Oh wait, need boosters"" matter weeks. admit wrong. What's special 8 months? I'm starting think want authorize boosters thought going massive surge demand initial doses vaccine FDA full approval, happened. tired it, got vaccine I‚Äôm going get boosters part.

Mate, point peer review addresses limitations referring to. saying thing two different ways. saying process clean studies conclusions *wont* misinterpreted No. That's anecdotes data. people die despite vaccinated.  There's never dispute that. larger numbers tell whole story. Small chicken poxes. Big chickens safe. Also, poxes gonna pox. go again‚Ä¶. Im even sure true, spent weeks BUSY miami areas work yeah lot dont wear masks ( especially ) Id say maybe 55-65% do? NYC live maybe 75%? Obviously still huge amounts people masking def 10% . sad many people short sighted. :( Yes, destroyed.  would say that. Depends mean contagious general no, HIV tb contagious, rabies less contagious.

Unless missed something, studies show breakthroughs waning immunity, vaccine escape. There‚Äôs difference. no, trust nurse, money (and schedule) literally positive part Original SF Chron article: 1 every 200 pregnancies sound uncommon. variants keep getting found countries pandemic raged control US year half. absolutely Florida variant, New York variant, Texas variant. official statement released August 18 boosters available everyone starting week September 20 eligible 8 months second shot. week later said considering shortening interval 6 months. past Friday said considering shortening interval 5 months. official guidance still 8 months. Thanks!! Law large numbers. worked statistics? determine person code Orange code Red? last tested? live work? clinical practice, u can't ethically tell people get covid life endangering best interest patient.

This research statistics dealing pandemic.  Viral updates keep comin‚Äô‚Ä¶ Aww shit go Yes, almost every post I‚Äôve seen someone states medical insurance rates increased choose vaccinate, immediate ‚Äúwhatabout-ism‚Äù reply generally ‚Äúwhat obese‚Äù. university vaccine mandate, 99.5% student body vaccinated. allowing WHO-approved vaccine, international students getting vaccinated home countries won‚Äôt issues. also required wear masks indoors, compliance generally good. However, many people university‚Äôs subreddit (and even tbh) fear cases inevitably go up, forcing us back remote learning. Seeing crowded dining halls buses increased fears me, although mask compliance pretty good (in dining hall, people wear masks getting food, take eat). really hope semester doesn‚Äôt turn covid disaster even vaccines masks, especially fully online 3 semesters. guys think? risk covid disaster even high vaccinations mask compliance, given transmissible Delta winter coming? Unfortunately high vaccination short time simply isn‚Äôt happening. Looks like take another year get poor countries vaccinated. Lots opportunities vaccine resistant variants.

I honestly don‚Äôt know logistics vaccine production, seems like larger percentage trillions spent covid gone ramping vaccine production. really think conspiracy theories led NASA getting less money? What? spike protein going take dozens mutations render previous immunity 0%. immunity natural infections include recognition ~30 epitopes SARS-COV2 surface definitely going evade immunity once.

Immune escape face vaccine inevitable virus die out, that's going happen overnight. Definitely faster create boosters new sequences.


I'd also point new strain escaped delta-induced immunity *would* spread fastest become dominant strain - said steps. idea immune escape happen immediately fantasy though. Sorry poor choice words. Pfizer guidelines potential exposure partially vaccinated adult?

My wife partially vaccinated told possible close contact someone tested positive covid. guidelines address all? tend think Mandela, funny accents, Charlize Theron. OH! rugby movie see. teachers family you‚Äôre minority here. one other, person definitely preferred option.  Always root devil know devil don't. Well everyone fitter, would less problems covid ""The flu season going wait December January."" in, upcoming flu season. fuck would think talking last year's flu season? conversation boosters necessary? know, Dec 2021/January 2022, 8 months majority Americans started getting shots?

Jesus, y'all wield idiocy shit like bludgeon. Given many people completed vaccination late March early May means US lowest immunity Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years. You‚Äôre mentally unstable wanted kill yourself. That‚Äôs mushrooms, that‚Äôs you. Aweh bra. Lekker aand. Yes, visibly. frustrating thing Mr. Woodruff's quote, me, ""...all unseen stuff viruses..."".
Like microscopic, believe it. Best wishes safe birth. hope friend see consider latest research reflected e.g. women COVID-19 15 times likely die, 14 times likely need intubated, 22 times likely pre-term birth uninfected, according study published month \[peer-reviewed\] JAMA Network Open."" mean I'm sure actuaries offer probabilities terms healthcare costs occupation... would think within range majority would simply pooled significantly higher would carry proportionately higher premiums.. turn also reflect higher worker pay/company profit higher risk jobs typically do. several. combinations various mutations floating around really worse.

There LOT recorded variants, class well known ones. Delta worse family. I'm God. said that. made earth. 

I know lying. I'm omnipotent. 

You're 14 live trailer ever left town. lying bad person. Awemasekind key point. People often dismiss idea virus explicit mandate coexist us. true explicit mandate. never required.

Long term, dependant organisms always adapted live sustainably environment/host/other organism depend on. proof simple: organisms adapt sustainability inevitably survive either exhaustion ressources, competition organisms manage harness ressources efficiently become resilient shortages (a strain infects us kill us effectively ""food""). matter when, if. 

I think strong argument make humans find way make planet inhospitable long coronavirus find every last one us kill us. approved pregnant dogs.  problem really way proving whether someone infected recovered. know many people got sick claim covid despite actually getting tested it. read walk around thinking immunity probably not. I‚Äôm glad people immunity, need know doesn‚Äôt going forward. every optimist 18 months wrong

This true though. vaccines even better optimists hoping. contagious, there's evidence Delta infection worse outcomes variant. around since may, it‚Äôs another lineage amongst slew novel lineages discovered South Africa, I‚Äôd wait concrete news emerge impact mutations carefully studied. last thing country needs negative international attention spurred rapid spread author-less clickbait articles, shat bots dodgy news sites like ‚ÄúIndiatvnews‚Äù 90% ads. good luck one... going take another 20 yrs fully vaccinate entire planet. another decade set boosters. us another 2 generations. literally modern day smallpox. Lambda looks goods run borders open up. Death 100% effective getting covid again. Exactly. get controversy. Natural immunity protects COVID, likelihood negative outcome infection *a lot* higher, get vaccinated anyway.

Personally, I'm still glad got shot. I'd rather *slightly* less immunity means pretty much take hospitalization death equation completely catch COVID.

This prevailing idea ""anything could interpreted challenging narrative banned"" dangerous opinion. **unvaccinated pregnant female** twenties...presented symptoms nausea, vomiting, fever, congestion and...**suffered fetal demise 29 gestational weeks**. also living COVID-19 positive family second case fetal death involved **unvaccinated female** **23 gestational weeks along** pregnancy contracted first two known cases fetal demise related COVID-19 Nueces County since beginning pandemic March 2020**. sustainable. I'm getting tired discussing one-size-fits-all restriction. vaxxed driving pandemic. vaxxed clogging hospitals. vaxxed spreading anywhere near amount vaxxed are.  We're wearing masks still, we're going get boosters, we're still everything can. Let's quit ignoring elephant room. Mandate shit vaccinations, want vaccine passports everywhere. simply nothing left vaccinated do.  looks like duck quacks like duck~  go again.... came laboratory, easily worst work imagine. think would happened pandemic started delta. Immune-driven antigenic drift always going occur. happens endemic Coronaviruses immunity driven natural infection. best defense escape variants high vaccination uptake short period time.

But ultimately, SARS-Cov-2 isn‚Äôt going away. Theres good argument vaccination alternative inevitable infection. Thousands people dying needlessly every week didn‚Äôt get vaccinated. Stop early day mind blown! Lemme coffee first geez pox poxes, sir! problem everything thinks terms stupid. hospital offering $30hr extra nurses struggling get people come in. travel RT making $100+hr walk bad. I've bedside nurse 7 years. Spent last year half Covid ICU. Yesterday last day. Starting new job tomorrow patient ambulatory surgery. things keep going way doubt lot old coworkers following soon. know getting downvoted. agree, vaccines given majority population since possibly stop transmission entirely, cases less important hospitalization, least seem remain low even tho cases places, expected, going up. I'm interested hospitalization deaths. Hopefully shoot again. sort career, got you. thinking standard careers, like lineman, fisherman, sort thing. get vaccinated it‚Äôs not. immunity Delta achieved infection vaccination, immunity work new strain, new strain spread vaccine enough infections recovery it. Savage plausible. Lets hope not. aim point overly simplistic phrased me. Loki variant Anyone else getting impression flip-flopping logistical reasons what's actually medically best? I'm getting flashbacks told worry wearing mask. ‚ÄúAs option‚Äù? want teachers like double work (teaching in-person virtual simultaneously) extra pay eighteen months double work extra pay (as never discussed action item Republican Democrat either administration)?

In-person absolutely unsafe standard workload.

Virtual safe standard workload (it would much easier allowed work virtual curricula summer, weren‚Äôt people refused countenance possibility return virtual, however temporarily). perceived ineffectiveness could mostly solved universal broadband universal laptops learning software creative suites students instructional suites + tablets teachers. 

But both? Look, we‚Äôre still dealing CoVID terrible level. can‚Äôt choose middle ground every single thing. That‚Äôs viable. Either say you‚Äôre willing let kids teachers family members die parents work keep stock market all-time highs, say care protecting life (overwhelmingly, children‚Äôs lives) willing go virtual things bad now. hard choice. It‚Äôs priorities. live county mask mandate every day work constant battle people act like hasnt thing last year half, people think remove mask talk. 
 
My personal pet peeve every single iphone user, first committed using face ID even time havent switched something else, also instead briefly removing masks unlock phone, say something like, ""sorry, face id covid times, gotta remove mask lol do?"" shut one. dont put mask back till remind them. I've ever seen context programming think going start using general. I'm immunocompromised got booster, asked immunosuppressant I'm gave shot. Rinse repeat You‚Äôre right. switched phrasing sentence left backwards. Even transmission occurs symptoms appear, symptomatic transmissions still contribute total transmissibility thus increase virulence always reduce viral ""fitness"" come increase transmissability.

A mutant 90% IFR would last long. ""Almost 2 years science struggles defines long term immunity COVID.""

Not really surprising. 

* figure virus (genome, variants' etc) 

* figure (in real-time) way cascades body (and effects sorts different body-systems)

* 2 things.. persons medical history going unique (so sickness itself, along long term outcomes immunity. .is going slightly unique individual). 

TLDR;.. Yep. complex going take fully understand. Yes mostly no. really talking evolution, something becomes different used longer thing. 

For virus evolve something truly new, lot time must pass. must enough DNA mutations make unidentifiable human immune system. Again, red herring like risk factors result choice, reflected proportion cost... I'm familiar US private insurance would assume that, example, race car drivers, MMA fighters stunt people would probably pay higher premiums? sure focussed 1 minor point though.. struggled interpret comment, zoning I'm suspicious blood O2, accurate? Ahh forgot - though 18 antibodies exposed - would think lots exposed symptomatic misunderstand determination Americans spread plague innocent, even sick. say aren‚Äôt sick experience cyanosis. Source: I‚Äôm American. I‚Äôve seen it. good sign would still love see could get back 1 million+ first doses day. Perhaps kids able get vaccine, we‚Äôll get back Right? kinds people shitting extroverts...*I'm* extrovert thrive around others made tons sacrifices *not* going *not* seeing friends help us get pandemic. encourage vaccination listening scientific experts guidance. extroverts headline makes us be. frustrating disheartening read many comments. Eradicated pool cleaner horse dewormer. 

(This sarcasm, eradicated *vaccine*) worried hospital admin see golden opportunity far PR goes open floodgates.

Right pretty well high vax rate, local mask mandates, sane governor. Fingers crossed though, south looks like true hellscape. yet anti-vax movement Smallpox, believe it. restrictions whatsoever haven‚Äôt fully vaccinated anyone 18. Delta breaking vaccines

There's specific evidence that. See [Durability mRNA-1273 vaccine‚Äìinduced antibodies SARS-CoV-2 compares [neutralization level time multiple see B.1.351 (Beta) much closer vaccine escape, [in every country Delta out-competed Beta become dominant strain. general, covid already long incubation period spread without serious symptoms shown. 

And covid would get wayyyyyyy deadlier would start serious effect ability spread. Stuff like Ebola tends burn quickly kills something like 90% victims can‚Äôt spread they‚Äôre dead. Covid kills around 2%ish would get whole lot deadlier would start burning deadly. Dutch research proven current vaccines work well Delta earlier variants. People prisons hospitals would probably much prefer things lmao

And military person know preferred going abroad everyone loved instead home. 

What awful point varies place place, urban areas liberal states pretty masked comparatively. asymptomatic 3-5 days first, die horribly, plenty time spread around. mandate everyone vaccine want enter type public venue. vaxxed driving surge contribute little spread. Aside mask mandates, nothing left vaxxed do. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That mean likely mean possible. fair, earliest smallpox ""vaccines"" basically cowpox parties. certainly blame people wanting get first vaccine ever. nowadays, we've basically many vaccines vaccine fully approved, people really get excuses anymore.

Still, I'm glad enough people got smallpox vaccine eradicate it, worry it. I'm one people able get smallpox vaccine (up non-replicating vaccine got approved couple years ago). outbreak happened that, even skin contact someone vaccinated within 30 days could cause serious infection many others. gonna start turning people zombies? getting tedious.

Also burnout one issue, deaths, sickness, lack PPE respect also lead ‚Äúshortage‚Äù (as skilled professionals fungible commodity).  Cry Beloved Country think think South Africa. could set logistics months ago Pfizer came said need boosters, data countries came said, need boosters. Instead, administration pushed back, afraid dissuading unvaccinated. unvaccinated still refusing get vaccinated. they're behind trying play catch up. need called failures.  Also slowness it. You‚Äôll spend week contagious hospitalized. you‚Äôre potentially spreading around week. scary viruses kill fast people don‚Äôt time spread it. you‚Äôre really bad shape people tend careful around you. wife works someone SA. said it‚Äôs rare find someone hasn‚Äôt covid. comment supposed imply Reuters wanted depict Seig Heiling? arm bent he's clearly gesturing normally. would did. dont so.. keep doin giga cringe thing guess. think reasons probably disagree Fauci said cautious/conscientious regards public health. recognize order us get pandemic, make personal decisions might inconvenience momentarily, ultimately get us society pandemic (which good).

I think Fauci probably holds many beliefs do, tough spot. People continually attacked threatened him, covid measures whatsoever. balance best people, people actually listen do. Unfortunately, often comes short. minimum, wish people would listen medical experts what‚Äôs best society‚Ä¶  fair, eliminate one attempt reduce confusion.    used work elementary schools 20 years ago forced shots date. treated exactly every FDA approved vaccine used treat stuff easily spreadable school.

Plenty vaccines require boosters. given you‚Äôre young don‚Äôt remember. 10 year booster shot tetanus. biggie. like saying Neil Armstrong never moon later came back Earth.

They middle breakout variant significantly higher R0, lower population immunity levels due 6+ months passed since second dose. Herd immunity achieved prior that, evident Rt &lt; 1 zero restrictions ‚Äî definition herd immunity. projections show achieved weeks, primarily due booster shots. right probably do, recognize he's tough spot, also recognize shot foot beginning this, integrity took quite hit lot people that. That's probably big reason trouble getting people listen advise. 

I feel like protection officials position. They're vulnerable spot there's laws policy protecting intimidation. Dr Amy Action stepped role Ohio behavior. really liked actually, annoyed people harassed resigned. disagree.

AstraZeneca UK Government fucked up, dont blame anyone else. 

The UK government promised vaccine could do, pressured AZ first vaccine.

You get - rules something magically force things happen. They're guidelines. entire ""democratic experiment"" relies people believing concept itself, he's (perhaps irreparably) damaged that.

It's question who's *legally* President... simple ""There can't two kings"". Australia used doses would much better position. dont know. Everybody‚Äôs burned nobody wants work short staffed are. need proper minimum staff nurses start picking extra. Pretty sure covid made zero-covid untenable.

That‚Äôs false. Vaccinated people less likely get coronavirus less likely transmit it. easily see difference vaccinated unvaccinated people rates infection, hospitalization death. 

Not sure anyone would dispute  One source resentment employers managing depleted workforce. Clinical psychologist Dana M√©nard found incentives new hires caused anger among front lines year retention rewards. Highly highly highly unlikely. sources wondered thing previously, amount people got covid surface bacteria near none since aerosol-based virus. Yes thought interesting too. importantly, closed international border back March 2020 several states closed borders rest country. Since state taken upon close border another state necessary.

Each state decide whether lockdown, however support payments mostly federal government. times source tension governments.

Australia originally pursued suppression strategy states ended achieving elimination without really aiming (during national 6 week lockdown) decided keep pursuing that. NSW exception. approach quelling outbreaks without shutting whole city state sort worked Delta came along. 

Border closures lockdowns source tension states stare federal government's st times. leaders (i.e. Prime Minister, 6 state Premiers 2 Chief Ministers - 6 states 2 territories) meet National Cabinet every Friday.

Our federal government NSW Government run Liberal Party, actually lean right side politics based neoliberalism (which economic freedom social freedom). states currently mix Labor Liberal Governments). Liberal Party would seen moderate US though. actually centre right whereas Labor centre left.

Our covid response mostly driven state premiers. PM complete tosser Pentacostal Christian really cares economy. economy would never shut we'd like countries overseas (with tens thousands deaths). Thankfully though, state premiers actually seem give shit states want protect citizens.

So past many us even understand still states, whereas I'm glad them. seeing age breakdown cases dashboard? What's crazy 70% Texans least 1 dose vaccine. would never believed number. day? Where's head getting booster? almost went ER, know Gator alum , isn‚Äôt shock It‚Äôs narrative it‚Äôs true. CDC health officials US clue doing, never entire pandemic. Yes! money health insurance companies!

/s strongly disagree.

You can't take either Cases, Hosptialisation Deaths isolation. Cases early warning Hospitalisations early warning deaths. never single metric, can't use one other. e.g. cases high hospitalisations/deaths low pandemic cases low deaths high new deadlier variant etc.

If case rate 26x higher vaccines need reduce death 26 times keep us place last year. think effective that. death rate 12x higher time last year, 26x cases give 12x deaths. win vaccines, terrible situation in?

Note:

Hospitalisations worse now, per case, 6 weeks ago.

Cases worse now, per test, 6 weeks think long short headline ""things concerning heading winter"". Maybe don‚Äôt convince let policy makers deal They‚Äôre working EUA 2-11 priority. sure decade 2. Maybe less depending at. begins collapsing due climate change.

Society already collapsing due climate change many parts world. Look wildfires, floods, hurricaines. places never recovered Laura even Katrina others, keep getting blasted again. Good point Psychedelics. hospital admission twice high individuals diagnosed Delta variant, compared Alpha, adjusting differences age, sex ethnicity.


Patients hospitalized Delta skew younger UK despite overall hospitalization rate (per infection) staying roughly Alpha. elderly vaxxed UK time Delta became prevalent account somehow. let get point healthcare systems extremely stressed like much US South right now. impacts healthcare everyone drain whole system. data collect, usually see surges coming mitigation measures put place. thing is, shooting zero-COVID closures/lockdowns even necessary. much less invasive measures use pull off. 

You're correct can't stop COVID. However, slow simple reason health care systems bent.  Ain't state inbreeding?   Herd immunity likely going achieved even high vaccination rates. UK, Israel Singapore still seeing large amount cases despite vaccination/natural immunity rate, latter two also still relatively strict measures place.

The grim warning get complacent idea boosters solve everything. Masks definitely still needed everyone gotten boosters. There's also, least IMO, biggest hurdle convincing everyone get boosters. health issues (between 2019-2020;mom, wife, cancer... mom died it; fil heart attack/bypass/pacemaker); family issues (last grandparent died week ago, covid related, go funeral another state due FUCKING COVID DELTA mad); people issues (lots drama mom's house due renter there); legal issues (at least two people year going ""sue everything have"" something responsibility much control over); job issues (the job quit earlier year moved everyone else dept another project except me) I've basically packed in. already anxiety/depression, add deadly global pandemic stuff mentioned above... I'm surprised still even slightly functional.

Plus hear TV/radio/internet person folks de-worming way covid think mask mandates equivalent mass genocide.

There nothing restore sanity. need flag passing meteor wipe us go quickly instead via climate change related issues. virus certainly exposed stupidity humanity ü§£ keep hearing ‚Äú ughh covid negatively affecting mental ‚Äú

Hi, I‚Äôm participating antibody study Texas. It‚Äôs something may helpful it‚Äôs easy support. got lad tests back today wanted help interpretation. Full context, White Male, early 30s, received second dose Pfizer March 31. 

Here total AB test

SARS-CoV-2 TOTAL Ab, protein

My N test negative. anyone help ranges, meaning here? Especially 1012 total AB number - strong immune response 5 months? get booster early? data shows immunity wanes fastest people weaker immune system (the old people, young people illnesses, people take immunosuppressives).

It's unlikely getting booster actually matter younger population (**if risk factors**). may still test positive show symptoms protection hospitalization death high enough people **without risk factors**. Name shame Hospitalizations can‚Äôt increase hospitals already full. becomes even less uncommon lot friends, birthday paradox comes mind. wasn‚Äôt arguing anything, don‚Äôt see anything data suggest vaccination rate reduces death around 93%. data shows that, would interesting me. doesn‚Äôt imply state that, curious coming conclusion, all.  introverts barely tolerate others, though, one gets energy - I've definitely known extroverts much like people need center attention, care rude/aggressive get it, I've known introverts dearly, dearly love people get plum exhausted socializing long periods time. 

Misanthropes introverts extroverts - main difference they're actually avoiding people hate them, whether feel need publicly announce much hate people around people, lol feel like every step kinda half assed. 8 months?

And would wager citizens Canada Germany normal lives, safer lives, less politicization pandemic response, fewer deaths per capita, less preventable homelessness, better-paid teachers, robust social services, wider vaccine adoption, day-to-day stability citizens United States. Cutting people checks isn‚Äôt silver bullet, deny viability terms promoting sedentary economic consumption opposed to, don‚Äôt know, **cutting state federal unemployment force people back work worsening pandemic**, seems poor comparison. like five countries single-payer healthcare 

Right, countries‚Äô coronavirus responses health outcomes compared ours? vaccine adoption rates? know Brits love NHS vaccination numbers prove it. 

We don‚Äôt even public option, campaigned thirteen years ago reneged current administration campaigned reneged issue. Private systems cannot handle public catastrophes, decentralized profit-seeking outfits contractors cannot compete centralized federal system. can‚Äôt grasp whatever reason, continues annoy healthcare research previous job.

You know annoys me? Medical bankruptcy. know, weird phenomenon thing countries like here. universal care countries like Germany opt-out option wealthier citizens,, single-payer entities like NHS - medical bankruptcy isn‚Äôt chronic problem here. prefer single-payer approach, form either would represent massive improvement unacceptable pandemic status quo. school district mandated staff October something  pay higher health insurance premiums. would pay higher life insurance premiums, though.

Health insurance premiums adjusted things, smoking. think age location may also allowable reasons. Occupation hobbies affect individual health insurance premiums US. They‚Äôre good dogs, Brent.

What vaccine immunity like 1m high flood barrier prevents 100% waves less 1m. happens waves get bigger 1m.

These random thoughts hopefully basis reality. 

Btw want start argument, actually things winter, cold conditions, favourable common viruses. lot people say difference behavioural understand think that's current scientific understanding is. 

It's thought several different factors well behavioural involved seasonality.

One factor vitamin d, majority Brits deficient winter. 

Another factor stability droplets air dependent temperature. Think viruses spread droplets. hot day, stable air cannot travel far. cold day much moreso. 

There studies say viruses active lower absolute (not relative) humidity. 

Cold air hold less water hot (hence water precipitates fog), meaning lower absolute humidity.  still plenty fuel.

I one question maybe clarify: understood vaccine help limit effects illness hosts. real debate that. mean say ‚Äúdeprive virus hosts mutate freely‚Äù? vaccine doesn‚Äôt take away potential hosts virus, debate vaccinated aren‚Äôt exactly protected infection. virus still infects hosts, taking hosts cells replicates. Replications lead mutations whether vaccinated person in-vaccinated. help understand better, limited understanding definitely level. So, assumed vaccinated less likely infected, say 50% population reduction infections, many infected asymptomatic know sick. won‚Äôt taking steps necessary kill virus, socially distancing, diligent wearing mask, staying home, etc. advantageous virus allows replications mutations, greater number replications mutations body fights completely allows statistically better chances create advantageous mutations result variants. Advantageous mutations ones allow survival virus host, higher spread rate, higher replication rate (which RNA viruses already good at), less symptoms host, etc. variants historically less viral contagious.

Also take lessons delta outbreak home end day,we together. 
So longer world ignore weaker links they'll continue ravaged pandemic, sooner later, individual best would amount nothing face virus fit Delta. think covid likely become almost dormant?

Surely make sense works si. Something something personal responsibility individual actions affect everyone pandemic. supposedly work right? work protect hypocritical mindset masks vaccines. work, still mask. Masks work still worried others masking.

You're deliberately ignoring point WeedIronMoneyNTheUSA raised raised response. Masks vaccines 100% effective (far it). Therefore, masked, vaccinated person totally protected risk also affected vaccination status mask-wearing people around her.

You seem casting reality aside pretending ""effective"" binary quality people claim masks vaccines ""effective"", mean measures totally prevent COVID-19 transmission. That's straw-man argument nobody making issue masking people wear masks touch putting on, touch sanitize hands touching anything else.

On face it, seems like better argument.  Yeah find tired achy. Hoping test comes back negative. COVID, thank god got vaccine. I‚Äôve given serious thought natural immunity think provides ""Anti-Vax"" argument considered taboo. believe (1) there‚Äôs pro-vax argument made acknowledging (2) lack acknowledgement makes vaccine‚Äôs efficacy look like wanes faster reality. Based Israeli study, natural immunity appears better vaccination anti-vax argument like everyone says.

 

My rationale current efficacy stats compare unvaccinated vaccinated, suggested vaccine losing efficacy (ie lower efficacy delta variant). However, natural immunity really good better vaccine, vaccine LOSING effectiveness (or least quickly numbers suggest), rather proportion unvaccinated becoming immune RISING. real measure efficacy thus compare (i) double vaxxed (ii) non-immune (ie unvaxxed previously infected). number non-immune must logically less number unvaxxed, comparisons unvaxxed alone understate vaccine's effectiveness understate death rate unprotected.

 

For example, 50% unvaxxed previously infected, (hypothetically) (i) reported death rate 1% unvaxxed would mean 2% non-immune (ii) 80% vaccine efficacy relative unvaxxed would mean 90% efficacy non-immune.

 

This several implications:

(1) failure acknowledge effectiveness natural immunity means danger unprotected UNDERSTATED. unvaxxed immune virus DANGEROUS stats suggest, meaning people may feel falsely secure getting vaccinated. I'll bet majority hospital unvaxxed non-immune

(2) failure acknowledge effectiveness natural immunity makes comparisons vaxxed unvaxxed underplay vaccine's efficacy, vaccine actually effective NON-IMMUNITY. 

(3) It‚Äôs possible vaccine‚Äôs waning efficacy overstated

(4) failure acknowledge effectiveness natural immunity erode public trust, converting people conspiracy theorists feel they're lied to

(5) optimistically predict vaccine protection delta variant closer prior variants official numbers suggest

I sensed government agencies media extremely reluctant acknowledge fear causing vaccine hesitancy, however believe mistake reasons outlined above. Also, anecdotally, shared Israeli study couple friends got FURIOUS, accusing (a double vaxxed individual) anti-vaxxer. leading believe life-and-death public health decisions made based emotion (fear hatred) rather facts, statistics logic; obvious reasons find horrifying.  uptake boosters high Israel starts see cases drop without change restrictions, we‚Äôll better idea much waning immunity played role 4th wave combination removal restrictions. 

Countries available supply offering boosters everyone people want third shot *strictly* travel purposes - several people know gotten third Pfizer shot AZ first dose many countries don‚Äôt recognize AZ/mRNA combination. cases starting rise elderly populations again, focusing third dose efforts people. (And hopefully children 12 approved.  Plus COVID infection rate higher even US last fall, giving extra 15% boost immunity, thanks Alex ""Boris"" Johnson's reluctance lock down.

Will enough? Time tell. Well, that's hope. Note number hopes expectations already trampled virus. Keep eye ball. True, smallpox even contagious incubation period. infectious spread despite deadly (iirc 20% mortality), visible fast, infectious symptoms appeared.

Well... Everyone died original infection included study, considering they're, know, dead. there's nothing really square. They‚Äôre far totem pole vaccines due world standing. They‚Äôre lucky any. pretty big reason get vaccinated recovered person, risk complications barely benefit.

Why hard understand?  eating rich. Whoa, came nowhere. us choice... educator myself, need childcare provide family. basically going ignore specific scenario I'm referring apply something I'm talking all? Testing high enormous amount people sick. still mean people getting testing runny nose. mutually exclusive statements. I‚Äôm deja vu would give feel like March 13th one time. THANK YOU.  No.

As previously infected person, reinforces belief getting vaccine useless me.

I risk unnecessary side-effects point. BODY peer reviewed scientific studies showing fully vaccinated person infected exact viral load unvaccinated person.

Yes, aware fully vaccinated person less likely become infected likely clear infection faster, right? lead less transmission overall people vaccinated. thing is, could _so simple_ appeal patriotism instead. drawn parallels Greatest Generation sacrificed home front WWII (food rationing, blackouts, supporting war effort) similarly called upon fight virus.

But civics dead, suppose.  n matter days. Scientists working vaccine MERS SARS 2 decades. Using knowledge given unlimited government backing helped successfully make Covid19 vaccine short time period. never MERS SARS outbreaks would still waiting vaccine. governor brainwashed uneducated masses didn‚Äôt get vaccine‚Ä¶ pretty much covers .. Good human. forget 11% Palestinians vaccinated. *Eleven percent.*

Israel size New Jersey, would like eastern PA 11% vaccinated. one cites Israel's data talks all. Hahaha. true, man. No, not. find looks like Israel used 3 weeks rollout. 

Im sure read something day comparing protection given 3 week dose separation significantly worse longer gap. Cant find article now. :/ Prolonged idleness mixed toxic sustained immersion social media entertainment (Netflix, news, etc). Yeah, fuck mental health.

People fucking soft.   Yes, least state teachers must vaccinated classroom. Mask mandates universal. However, despite that, headed shit storm schools actually open region. FDA unlikely grant approval 12s near future, studies ongoing even extended order catch rare side effects. right thing, virus waiting scientific trials. I'm boomer. rode motorcycles entire life. Japanese Harleys 2018. never ever wanted associated kind arrested adolescent behavior, even younger.

Well, maybe 20s...

Never went Sturgis August even though invited times could stayed one bike clubs there, Chub Brothers. Sturgis scene buy lot trouble. Like Daytona, put shit forever. coronavirus subreddit, shits filled misinformation trolls year now. Shopping grocery store. isn‚Äôt like Walmart Costco. It‚Äôs literally food.

Wait. You‚Äôre user issue NZ‚Äôs response. aren‚Äôt good enough. tried acquiring vaccines?  also meant focus lowering hospitalization death rates primary metric ""success,"" we're acting like tragedy thirty-something develops significant disease may live rest life.  Gotta love super spreader events. expected, 0-17 data looks low put context fatalities age group. Less 5,500 school age kids die year US‚Ä¶ causes.

To quote top comment, that's actually insanely high risk considering total deaths annually.  nearly 10% increase deaths COVID age group staggering. way around. longer bring shooty-shoots Great Minnesota Get Together. 3-4 weeks end. start bit longer didnt enough. every school following guidance?

I also highly recommend documentary Creepy Line.  Health life insurance premiums somewhat based risk factors... Smokers pay more... People high risk occupations pay more... refuse potentially life saving/ hospital stay preventing free shot also keeps healthcare system everyone overwhelmed definitely pay willful stupidity. vaccinated folks prefer avoid covid: time scale back plans. Wear n95s stores, avoid indoor dining, etc. Stay far possible away incoming train derailment. Thank sharing this! 'most mutated' means absolutely nothing. 1-2 mutations, right places, worse 100 mutations wrong places. 

One thing that, vaccines, pressure virus become vaccine resistant. order this, pretty drastically change layout, notably attaches ACE2 receptors. eventually hit point (and might already) virus mutates sacrifice lethality/transmissibility order evade vaccines effectively. 

[The New Yorker great writeup There‚Äôs people baseball stadiums across country every night past 5 months cousin lost father. ~70M chronic lung issues. think allows rationalise masking, vaccinating follows: young 30sF, fit, chronic conditions, takes health supplements etc. Almost immediate family including herself, receovered. Deaths ppl 50 still rare though increasing. person makes personal risk assessment based info believe true. ‚ÄúBut could change‚Äù -the article one assuming natural immunity doesn‚Äôt work, that‚Äôs ridiculous. notion always been, albeit based coronaviruses, natural immunity wanes 6-8 months. obviously don‚Äôt know sure yet case SARS-CoV-2. natural immunity lasts longer 8 months, that‚Äôs incredibly welcoming news. Peer review reason. even started post immaturely lol come man Several studies shown natural immunity works. unable locate one shows opposite. default assumption natural immunity work absurd. Yes, peer reviewed article better non-peer reviewed one, however mean considered. important caveat I'm keeping mine home get vaccinated. everyone's situation allow that, clear right thing Tbh change anything personal preventive measures? Stay away, wear mask wash hands. I‚Äôd say side motorcycle culture. know lot young people ride sport bikes harleys anything know, Sean Connery explain beyond morgue. Yeah, except eating drinking. concert football game it‚Äôs total joke. vaccinating kids isn‚Äôt increasing vaccine coverage? PTSD since 20 years ago.

Covid made much worse.I feel safe many people become snappy,yell towards me. Delta breaking vaccines, recommending boosters now. variant become dominant needs competitive advantage variants. Normally, viruses become less lethal advantage unless disease progression quick infect people. possible variant would contagious less equipped evade immune system, variant would competed one contagious evade immune system. virus widespread likely become contagious lethal (better suited survive evade immune system). neighborhood pool pool party?

There‚Äôs usually like 6 people condo complexes pool longer affordable Healthcare? Shamed silence.

Muted, will. states okay now, CA hospitalization even half VS peak. Human population net increase 52 million far year, even covid mutated become lethal order magnitude, would kill large enough numbers diminish pool hosts. Yes agree people aren‚Äôt thinking society functioning it‚Äôs lack good function taking account want do. expect everything else remain believe nothing changed. cares people die wanna go restaurant, movies, etc.

This exact argument used towards loved one complaining lockdowns 2020. longer let thing run rampant worse it‚Äôs going hinder society snowballing making everything else worse. look hospitals right triage done ""entering scientific mainstream""

I object this.

This part scientific mainstream long, long time. Physicists HVAC engineers knew this. would default hypothesis anyone undergrad physics.

What actually happened medical community arrogantly decided knew better experts decided _stay out_ mainstream science follow unsubstantiated dogma almost century. joke? europe latin america right way Another way look it. 

If small amount people vaccinated vaccine resistant virus evolutionary advantage. people vaccinated vaccine resistant mutation huge advantage may become widespread. Hey! could ready bazillion hour.! know can't assume best outcome. really hard decision make. actual legitimate doctors know anything worth degree recommend vaccine. I'm ""hell bent"" people getting vaccinated regardless necessity. parents position study tell anyone supposing. making assumptions conclusions based single non peer reviewed study. gotten far pandemic info saying get vaccinated even previously infected. looking facts. Maybe ‚Äúideal variant incubator‚Äù might ear less downvotes? 2-8 degree Celsius

Sputnik V needs colder temps apparently mutation existing virus versus brand new novel virus?  got doses Pfizer January got pregnant March. know anecdotal know, pregnancy groups, tons people got pregnant getting vaccinated. science absolutely support vaccine impact fertility.  Thank demonstrating point wait articles peer reviewed first. I'm saying vaccines caused them, FYI miscarriages 20 weeks uncommon (&lt;0.5% chance) politician Florian Philippot, presidential candidate next year‚Äôs election, organized protests months.

So it‚Äôs politics. Sort of, yes. keeping lambda bay, likely escape current vaccines' protections. access vaccine reject it..(Unlike young Japanese here)

Breakthrough deaths weak immune system sincere sympathy,As immunocompromised family. double vaccinated mean you‚Äôve gotten doses, mean got full dose Pfizer Moderna? something else? Yea, get coming from, tricky thing covid long incubation period still transmissible. havent seen much reduction incubation period Delta even though mutated spike proteins infective virulent. could continue little impact incubation time host contagious.

I spent like 10 minutes trying find article read last week it, find ya. epidemiologists mapping four different possible outcomes likelihood each. deadly version, less deadly version indicated realistic possibilities. Variants escape existing immunities rated likely. recall fourth scenario looked was. Interesting point. Would enough deaths meaningfully skew reinfection rates? agree caveat provided added considered paper upon review pressure leaders US strike balance keeping citizens safe retaining civil liberties incompetence China. sounds like vitriol, country caused mess, country trying manage way it. I'm saying get rights vaccinated people, since apparently even vaccinated, least similar immunity purely vaccinated people.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Correct. See Chise's news. vaccine *many times* less effective delta. [the UK far best have, 93% effective (13x reduction) death.  get boosters mmr? It‚Äôs early say whether need boosters long term not. already shortage. Even pandemic. Critical shortage coming. ‚Äúabsolutely unsafe‚Äù conditions preferred option ‚Äúteachers family‚Äù. 

For extra hazard hero pay, course. 

And updated ventilation mandatory HEPA filters, naturally. 

And majority schoolchildren cannot receive shots going beginning flu season, clearly yes - picture clear. Wanting teach virtually worse outbreak time last year among kids going flu season minority opinion. 

Where ‚Äúteachers family‚Äù teaching, don‚Äôt mind asking? Texas Florida? dealing virus? going lives usual? Genuinely curious mindset majority opinion holders cite also workers profession. Colorado's rates still pretty low compared last winter's surge. Trending slightly though. Dude, flu hit almost twice year every year, took microbiology shut up, clue talking about. hope correct  Lmao, hostile. Complete sentence quoted yourself, ""The flu season going wait December January *when majority Americans got first second shots*"". misunderstanding yet flying handle like weirdo sure you‚Äôre getting downvoted - low O2 saturation leave feeling poor, right? seems like common sense thing‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs good point feel bad comment. thing is, people take slight contrary information run conspiracy style. Google Search vs. Real Doctors scary thing. People willfully ignorant, look anything support suspicions. information bad. strain might able less contagious delta among unvaccinated still overtake many areas contagious delta among vaccinated. totally unnecessary keep mind randomized 0.3% could still representative distribution sequences it‚Äôs done statistically sound way :) really don‚Äôt want wait late September get mine USA. Ugh.  Yep, we've given up, enough, many rules left. event last week sat next senior government minister people wore masks 5 minutes show respect guidance came off.  UK population definitely 'what be' stage Viruses usually don‚Äôt work like that. Spread lethality since know, host dies spread. That‚Äôs SARS MERS stopped point. mean I‚Äôd prefer everybody get vax don‚Äôt need care variants. thought illegals coming across border! Avoid reposting information, please. get BSN year half, bedside nursing miserable work. literally delta right lol need another strain comin way Become therapy wish see world

I absolutely adore term!!! journalists stop trying find stories actually announcement. beating walls looking next update, going get intermediate details still worked out. opposed what? point testing think mask doing?

Would suggest perpetual state lockdowns virus kills less 1% people infected? rate, it‚Äôs never going end. Purely political. works fast time symptoms. COVID takes 5-14 days start showing symptoms.
Its virus spread mush has. One died recently. name Marc Bernier. Anti Vax radio host. definitely spent money global vaccine distribution, don‚Äôt think anyone could argue that.

But full antibody escape going take dozen mutations. Even Delta relatively little resistance high antibody titers. could hit anywhere near 70% global vaccination rate next 12-18 months drive covid endemic status. joke, that's actually fairly likely, since less deadly means infect (generally). Consider Pfizer currently one approved booster, think immunocompromised originally received moderna getting boosters? most, that's 1 4 2-dosers US. huge chunk disproportionately risk. 

The bigger problem simply really real world data Pfizer boosters time article published. Without that, hard say someone fully vaccinated something best stage starting clinical trials without even preliminary data. Headline funny, 'Pregnant People' man people guess get pregnant. Avoid reposting information.  interesting Australia's provinces much autonomy pursue mitigation strategies, similar individual US states. think lucky NSW lead Death Cultist care residents meet Lord prematurely not. possible US shortage medical oxygen? Europe, country hited worse Florida, hospitals shortage practically everything. never heard shortage oxygen.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   border talk red herring. Blame irresponsible unvaccinated neighbors have. long people keep getting infected, virus chances mutate. definitely part population anti-vaxx too. even that, enough vaccines yet people want them. thing happened US. took couple months get appointment. Since seems Japan rushing supply, could take several months supply finally meet demand. Keep submissions topic. still magical spike protine changing abilities. Keep submissions topic. Shit, pretty desperate. really bad US, like right ? That's true, could competitive advantage another way - immune evasion.

If imagine could tweak virus better targeting individuals immunity, immunity, latter comes cost former rack points first. Ie, delta.

Once delta supplied everybody antibodies, alternatives less infectious evade delta antibodies become competitive, there's reinfection potential. Close borders. Wife fully vaxxed bad breakthrough covid right now. sucks. Pro vax, borders need shut stop new variants coming beating vaccine.... Something positive might end ‚Äúdudebro‚Äù culture larger emphasis placed mental prowess rather many squats someone do. imagining rule thumb ironically created. Further, would, top hat, say changes make transmittable tend make deadly. folk catch it, viral load (likely) intense.  Got it. I'll give method shot. Thank you. Evading antibodies = contagious. Gonna need link that. find hard believe looking normal oxygen intake shit. get that. I‚Äôm saying people don‚Äôt react solely based politicians telling them. Everyone know regardless political party (I know mainly left leaning people anyway) it. don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd complying lockdowns even went effect. everything solely politics. think people want things enjoy make life enjoyable That's why, update antivirus..!

-Not Norton limiting factor number vaccines, they've already procured enough. issue rate vaccinate people. religion refuse blood transfusions even dying children... :( Reading comprehension, it? I'm saying majority waiting December 2021/January 2022 later BOOSTERS. Paying double/triple time enough work load doubled, acuity doubled, patients antivax/antimask/covid denying seeyounexttueadays. aint calming cause last time people said delta problem, result. 

Im saying panic placing serious attention many variants possible stupid thing do. Yeah, true that. chasing we've got shoulder bit blame.

Had idea immune system.. Sounds like interesting wiki rabbit hole. bad news you... BS? belief natural immunity recovered infection similar vaccination terms level protection. Reinfection seems rare breakthrough cases. Covid con body thinking perfectly fine. People come hospital bit temperature turn double pneumonia (which usually hurts like hell) oxygen levels usually see people respiratory failure. True, evolutionary pressure covid less long, infectious, incubation period. Diseases want less deadly spread more, covid still spread lot deadly. course, pressure still exist become less lethal, ling enough time period expect see play out, probably take longer past diseases this. infection new strain confers immunity deadly strain, otherwise, they'll circulate. Feed alligators. That's mRNA-based vaccines important. get infected COVID, body picks assortment antibodies use. mRNA vaccine, already picked consider best antigen, since spike protein critical part COVID small chance mutating enough evade immune response. low CTs mate Ugh. Anyone experience getting early booster? last Pfizer dose February thinking getting booster along flu shot possible. wanna lie, it'd great somewhere could get early without questions. I'm Michigan makes difference  that's fine. original comment made sound like national policy,    Yeah, look, I'm arguing that. get reason, agreement though people get vaccinated generally poor anyway hurt more.


But I'm curious think workers dangerous jobs pay more. spike people going create spike cases. need kind data analysis determine cases expected across population factors rally canceled. Surely increase, numbers would nice. whole science thing. know variants arent genetic testing.

Anyone know started stuff cheesepuff cancled yet?

Last heard UK testing limited ammount world wide samples. Thank you! helpful.

Now, next question :) come immune system learns react spike protein vaccine, spike protein virus? Good Luck Kiwis mind clarifying something (I'm trusting flair)? study reliably considered considered ""peer reviewed"" vs. simply ""pre-print"" within medical context? 

The study article mentioned also appeared Sciencemag ([link previously thought Sciencemag (AAAS) selective reviewed articles prior publication (hence would meet threshold ""peer-reviewed""). However go half way article find this:

*""The research impresses Nussenzweig scientists reviewed **preprint** results, posted yesterday medRxiv. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs textbook example natural immunity really better vaccination,‚Äù says Charlotte Th√•lin...""*

A bit digging indicates many journals often publish pre-prints, always thought no-no. 

I'm unclear whether means still considered pre-print (the article originally posted contain mention status). 

It also sounds like flair indicating ""Peer-reviewed"" ""Pre-Print"" used subreddit - recall seeing option. point cure becomes worse disease. happens different person. two years counting fewer people going want continue. reach people delta can‚Äôt like freshly vaccinated/booster people.  Enjoy scenery Except that‚Äôs entirely necessary longer incubation period (as people aren‚Äôt showing symptoms they‚Äôre infected still go around living normal day day lives, allowing spread virus), - presume - large connected world population virus work with. done poor job communicating it‚Äôs necessary it‚Äôs necessary vs year got vaccine initially. think people used flu shot model it‚Äôs yearly dose rather every 6-8 months.
