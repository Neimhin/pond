0,2020-09-25," Yes! Test first!!! live North Dakota, it’s terrible seeing cases rising ton nothing done it. state state doesn’t go John Hopkins way calculating new cases really confusing. 4 months, whenever Dept. Health posted numbers here, would post total number tests including retests, counting positives new tests. positive rate much lower retests counted rate new positives. couple weeks ago, would show amount new tests retests, could calculate actual positive rate that. However, changed showing “susceptible test encounters” whatever fuck means, isn’t way find actual positive rate. way pretty clear bunch people catching actual positive rate, decided couldn’t show number new tests anymore. governor won’t shit owns half downtown Fargo, god forbid lost money makes that.

It’s likely population likely spread (young socially connected adults, essential works, etc) might already largely infected. know state younger demographic confirmed cases pretty big margin. I’m associating numbers numbers then. I’m challenging model’s underlying assumptions advocating other, predictably reliable models accurately projected trajectory pandemic now. 

Whatever complex interplay mask wearing, restrictions, natural ebb flow virus, don’t believe IHME nailed down. like said, time tell. Better performing models least 100k projections.

1. wasnt wrong we're still losing 1000 people day new hotspots emerging often. virus gone stretch. think virus gone absolute moron


2. youre life sad respond month old comments feel sort internet validation. Unreal. news, UK France hardly tests start pandemic.

It's Britain missed 98% cases peak mid/late March. estimate, 23 March, median 114,000 (95% credible interval (CrI): 78,000–173,000) new cases 

That estimate plays nicely antibody studies, generally found prevalence around 6-8% (about 4-5 million people) end first wave.

According .gov.uk site, 2,300 official cases registered. going get MUCH worse gets better Well, I'm trying predict there's vaccine. subsequent events contingent it. April 2021 timeline we've heard (including Dr. Fauci) vaccines available everyone holds, reasonable forecast events. Thank tired misinformation everywhere. Fuck Foxnews, Fuck Zuckerberg, Fuck CCCP said I'm advocating mask usage? I'm saying there'll people mind masks much continue wearing masks habit. That's literally it.

Whether rational matter. see saying harmful all. feel mostly fine, tummy hurts bit besides I'm okay. thank asking! British data August report 3.1% 65-74, 18% data suggest people dying Covid lost 14-17 years life, average. one us. compare naked mole rat us. shit...fo reals lol. Blaming Forest?

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide really? way 10%. might little higher estimated saw another study showed fatalities people would likely died within year, count those? mean 95 year old bad health gets covid dies... really anything dying natural causes? many people die ""nothing""? i'm genuinely curious last one represents ***40% error*** province's death totals. see comparable. wrote perspective hadn’t thought about. Thank you! especially thinking wrote Filipino-American one asking culture. I’m opposite. would million questions you. always kid welcome wagon high school got exchange students. want know everywhere....I guess previous comment written exasperation see negativity towards USA site. also seems people happy USA hit hard Covid. Like it’s deserved. Oh, well. It’s business others think. 
Again, thanks interesting perspective. 100% capacity restaurants 
100% killing us comes fl far behind. lifted today well. That's one instance. I'd like see there's evidence backing occurences widespread. 

I'm sure deaths cases undercounted. wary building narratives around fact. country population 1.2 billion, difficult keep track numbers. Maybe analyse data, calculate % cases officially recorded compare numbers countries investigate going wrong instead assuming there's malicious intent. many red flags here. Vaccines neurological illness symptoms bad sign, unless dealing large number participants, even investigations called for. Yeah I’m good company. They’re notorious legal disputes ingredients products. vaccine hoping another company delivers. Would lizards turn own? smart millions dollars invest Damn school affordable daycare option workers. knew March lol.

Sorry. feel?  calling education trained professionals instead parents vastly varying intellect, ability, experience “dystopian”????? wrong. HI word isn’t spread evenly population. could populations see bars actually small (and relatively healthy/young) percentage population, lot easier get exposed develop immunity. one partier would normally infect four partiers, could infecting two partiers.

Critical thinking skills become crucial skill navigating life. without led totally astray. sad.

Unfortunately, critical thinking skills enough days. information used CTers must checked accuracy. first-rate CTer using erroneous ""facts,"" CTer may wrong someone without CT skills. 

That's big drawback CT way forward...this post-truth era. Again, internet/social media blame bad information well. And, people necessary schooling separate fact fiction. fuck talking about? 200,000 dead 2020 covid. many died flu time span? read Chinese press, focus protect front line research workers well key appointment holders prior wave 2.

Please don’t let take :) maximum buy EU normal shop 3000 IU. body might absorb less. way know monitor getting checked every three months.

If currently normal value take 120 days 3000 IU without issue, ""average"" person (which exist). 

Fucking around vitamins supplements stupid idea, however. buy anything put body Amazon, [they sketchy comingled inventory system counterfeits mixed legit friend works cargo business major airline told already started working capacity planning, logistics they’re ready roll vaccines become available. idea - found encouraging. relative RDA standard doses usually come in. uncommon see D2 higher dose, D3 tops like 4,000 regular supplements.

That said apparently RDA statistically-flawed 9, 000 IU RDA.

Still, Vitamin fat-soluble vitamin overdose on, tread carefully. Thank you, came say much same. That's works all. Ever heard winter? everyone lives Texas.

Hey guys, hope I'm breaking rules here, wanted let know took part Phase 3 SARS-COV-2 Vaccine trial. shot administered 30 minutes ago.

The staff freaking bit dizziness since one common symptoms recorded eat coming here. 

Looks like make diary entries app next 7 days, take another shot month go several doctor appointments next two years monitor long antibodies work administered real thing instead placebo. 

Well guess I'll keep guys updated throughout daym nothing ventured, nothing gained.

EDIT: keep checking pulse pressure. Everything normal despite dizziness. assume administered real thing since got pretty dizzy right taking shot. Well yeah, normally totally agree, reason become synonymous sub knowingly allowing disease spread without mitigating efforts, achieve ""natural"" immunity. strategy Sweden going users keep pushing lie. 200,000 Americans died Covid, number continues rise, dumb ass calling irrational citing statistics funeral home ""chances dying"" Covid. people died statistics, **people**. quoting numbers, tell 9/11 also meant nothing, chances dying day much, much lower chances dying Covid.

Anecdotally would get chronic bacterial bronchitis like clockwork every single year. every single year would need dose antibiotics knock (one time ask friend friend's doctor uninsured get knew would get worse).

Anyway, know potentially post-hoc fallacy, since supplementing D3 Zinc, I've bronchitis *years*.

Since began I've encouraging friends &amp; family take supplements well. Low risk, high reward. I'm trying find good reliable reusable mask nose wire pocket filters. I'm looking one masks that's shaped move touch face whilst breath. anybody recommendations masks they've used? understanding people die Coronavirus get pneumonia active immune system, no? sense surprising.

Anyway, surprising vitamin helps decreased deaths 90% (in previous study). That's huge. 10.000 IU upper limit take rest life without side effects. Would 4000 effective people? yeah, probably. Depends blood levels. will. parents largely confined home since March would likely killed them. They'll able go outside much occasional dashes across street doctor's office soon. Meanwhile, relatives London ... well, luck anytime soon, I'm afraid. Beg go theatrical way act you’re anticipating funeral. You’ll see happens. Totally!

Gotcha. Yeah, one take medical advice reddit. :)

I'm proponent getting levels tested live northern Europe got first test done year find I'm extremely deficient. Ever since I've taking 20,000IU supplements (at first every day week, prescribed), feel sooo much better sick long time. Username checks would restrictions cause deaths? understand restrictions cut cases? Giving cause less cases. country sad right now. stay home unless go work store. Hard believe countries lockdown again.

Sure US could avoid overflowing ICUs wearing masks. Seems worth me!  shutting couple weeks figure .. going on. Every state rules see utterly incompetent leaders many different levels

Well, yes, Trump abdicated responsibility. peeing section pool... FYI I'm American. simply pointed claim fallacious. Would really interesting see trends college admissions. Could become lot competitive might have, average, larger graduating classes. Trump... Good thing I’ve drinking Sunny years layperson, elaborate? 99% actually last 1% cases test result available one reason another. Damn man, sorry hear that. doing? Sucks me, vitamin gives awful insomnia Right, even restrictive slightest. diseased un-careful morons allowed spread...  reporting turned reporting Covid deaths, Covid deaths help continue support lockdown measures. Interesting works.

Are implying things would better without lockdown? 

Not discounting awful events described, notion caused lock little bit short-sighted. problem people starved lockdown, government let starve forced lockdown. government failed support protect people. solution you, start revolution start guess. without lockdown would've way worse way now. free, go doctor get actually found groupon regular blood panel cost $40. one explain results, easily Google. Assuming referring grow. literally simple buy spores online may may legal area. Specifically meal good amount fat it. doubt, be. anxiety attack better part day. There’s denying though still state nation &amp; something needs fixed. Yes think Trump's creation anti-maskers attached make things extra hard Biden, even CDC un-muzzled. Trump everything power sabotage. Lol, yeah guess death definitely affects way life. Totally trying say unless doctor advised taking much would play safe. there's lot good natural sources well. google scholar search ""vitamin d"" ""immune"", find many thousands journal articles vitamin used various parts immune system. 

I can't help suspect reactions effect sars-cov-2. I'm merely saying, regardless who' vaccine successful first, much vaccine go around given production limitation. order nations must decided upon surely want one makes call order, someone opposed you. take 700mg, also diagnosed bipolar disorder insomnia take recommended psychiatrist supplement meds. you’re going self medicating start low dosage build slowly time feel good dosage.

EVERYONE GET FUCK OUTSIDE SUCK VITAMIN D! actually pretty disappointing hear many vaccines help prevent infections transmission. doctors pushing many people possible get flu shot year preserve hospital capacity, including people low risk ending hospital flu. SAD good results vit D. eradicate gets without needing antidepressants turning alcohol dull life. might worth getting bloods done see deficient, u need heck strong dose initially get back taper down.

Month two ago, me: ""Hey, they're saying there's weight behind taking Vitamin help blunt worst virus. Let's make sure we're taking enough."" start taking 2000 IU/day.

Today, thread: ""I pretty sure I've saved family.""

other commenters: ""You taking 6000 IU/day!""

Me: ""fuck."" yea well said. mean blood pressure goes pretty quickly, still good expose different things. ways extra valuable bc really ideas might studying, people motivation want get look at. though ppl remember generally forms media level form characterization (so ppl annoyed liberals vice versa bc annoyed media remind media necessarily accurate depiction). fox news still fascinating (for 30s) Half nation took gospel. half nation drilled hole boat. blame half owning boat

Okay: first third sentences go together. second fourth sentences go together. 

But two pairs contradict other. So, I’m confused. backpedaling would excuse idiots gotten yet. idiots change realize bad go it, idiots chance realize truth. Good you. Way make political. America fucked going back original point, 500k+ Americans go bankrupt year due medical costs whereas zero UK presumably rest Europe do. think that's acceptable first world country? This. sure downvoted. Canada 250 deaths per million, US 600 deaths per million. Lol @ OP comparing current US numbers future Canada numbers understanding that's illogical. Many tried that. They’re day 192 “15 days flatten curve...”  mean? math wrong? 7m confirmed cases. That's 2%.

Huh? dont see stats provided go said. Quebec 5800 deaths population 8 million meaning similar death rates countries like Italy Sweden. Ontario 2nd, roughly half deaths decpite higher population.

To seems like Quebec behind majority lf Canadas deaths. cant say exactly went wrong tho. ""Confirmed"" reinfections, 16. ""Unconfirmed"" reinfections globally, hundreds. 




People even year immunity, zero. 



Muh evidence? Well, gotta make sure lick envelope sticking box. they’re attacking test teams, right? really need make vaccine coronavirus far since ones actually harmful humans gotten rid isolating infected people (SARS, MERS) rather vaccine. coronaviruses cause cold-like symptoms, any, need invest lot resources making vaccine harmless virus. Moreover, multiple vaccines animal coronaviruses already made varying efficiencies It’s that. literally can’t afford wrong point. wrong, one responsible destroying entire US economy. legacy would ruined. keep spouting doom gloom keep scared people happy.

“if looks like you’re overreacting probably means right thing.” looks like reacting yet it’s still even bad? Like maybe well-managed nursing homes staff paid well don’t work multiple homes spreading themselves? Oh rich folks medicine Important point hospitalization trends nonsense says article hospitals report every day impossible follow data time.

Also cases stabilized St Louis Kansas City, meaning rural counties ""it can't happen here"" fucking

Along side skin cancer.

Vitamin far safer used properly. thousand UI per day fine. wisdom teeth removed otherwise I'm good. Listen man reason throw away life like that. Substance abuse helps moderately even may screw over.

I know bought rope think burn immediately. something stupid. online classes. read thank teachers. :) Everyone living areas experience winter taking vitamin supplement. guarantee getting enough months otherwise.  Obviously guy care virus I'm surprised got rid fines. Florida's economy took hit could helped, even bit. wasn’t me.

-Shaggy Nooooo! 14,000 deaths?! What’s average age dead? What’s say? 80% deaths people 65 older? people cardiovascular respiratory diseases would killed even SARS CoV - 2 wasn’t circulation?
What’s that? people retired? aren’t part working population? could social distance, wear mask ask younger relatives get PCR test visiting them? rest population go continue work without need crash economy cause unnecessary strife? meanwhile healthy population build herd immunity relegate coronavirus little flu? Nooooo, lock down! Link studies. Perhaps unaware, case. Studies shown 70% people asymptomatic Covid-19 cases heart damage comparable heart attack. fully know long-term health consequences Covid-19, certainly 95% people fine. America great yet? move says better portray severity COVID-19, Minnesota Department Health (MDH) longer making public current number COVID-19 patients ICU bed. hospitals refuse attend people 70 capacity provide care would lockdown Sweden. happened Spain Italy. quality life high sustain pressure go extreme measures situation extremely bad people could saved diying. probably get distinctive factor intention higher control virus country. fry fucker Dr 50,000 units/week D3 7 years. levels fine don’t get sick. I’m woman, btw, matters. dissolves fat. there's fat stomach, there's nothing dissolve into.

That imply must guzzle tons olive oil vit D. simply means take meal, that's - enough process take place properly. make sense country totally different more-so accepting millions deaths making virus much harder actually eradicate via vaccination due new strains would likely arise mutations occur larger host population. we'd FORCED shut anyway, crippling economy worse restrictive lockdown reopened slowly. literally witnessed 2020 numerous times already, relearning lesson costs lives makes things worse.

We solving jobs/economics separately concerns public health. look GOP botched/robbed stimulus something change rather response public health perspective correct that, many politicians pointing obvious solution economic side things. Point is, need economy suffer politicians right thing.  Aaaand checked weather today gonna cloudy rainy week see present could helped reduce USA's mortality rate.

Preexisting conditions conditions go away even treatment. alleviate Covid really discriminate healthy blood pressure maintained uncontrolled.

If Millions people gained access healthcare, would possibly unknowingly got infected infected people.

It works ways. Oooh, buffet! again, personally social distance go places unnecessarily wear mask social distance, ok get eventually mate. I'm decade smoking couple years vaping finally went cold turkey I'm year nicotine free.

When want it, r/stopsmoking good resource. ""Do research!"" - battle cry uninformed.

Wrong. knew late December. notified Dec 31. isolated virus Jan 7. sequenced virus Jan 10.

What suggesting absurd face. virus widespread enough November detectable, would wildly control across country Jan 23, Wuhan Hubei locked down.

There kinds international studies flu samples, posthumous tests deaths, sewage samples. first example virus US Jan 15. virus widespread Wuhan November, would deaths SF Bay Area earlier Feb 7th.

Please, go spew nonsense somewhere else. MS RN ... it’s terrible people quitting people refusing take care patients... nurses like work covid patients every single day since March..... everyday. Nurses quitting even may may PPE Well everyone knows winnie pooh Asshole wants spike election, people avoid going polls.  That's different issue. I’m black independent Detroit. course would assume.

The pro-Beijing government sweating bullets thrashing took local elections last year. likely repeat given everything happened last year.

It quite obvious elections postponed. Big difference expected maturity 21 29. intentionally vague media loves propagate age based discrimination.

He told better prepare live best can. Also mentioned China got ahead virus measure temperature literally everywhere, automatically. Apparently Covid common graph fever cycle relatively reliable indicator someone certain phase disease.
If numbers even remotely correct, China effectively clear covid, mostly implementing widespread temperature measurements. miracle cure mood issues

Right.

It's feel-good pill. like 'if enough feel good' type thing. Necessary, sufficient. second wave brutal nobody cares anymore. imagine happened month ago without restrictions it’s way way late.

gonna hundreds thousands typical number though? know people retire I’ve heard called “heavens waiting room” (not saying that’s nice I’ve heard called that) it’s way way cheaper warmer seems like high number per day. 
I guess never thought now, many actually move per day LMFAO. need milk. Old news. me, weird sound, Vitamin supplying really bad. always become heart racing, high pulse high blood pressure taking Vitamin D. There's enormous amounts regulations smoke, taxes purchases, banned spaces smoke, banned places chew, bans flavored vapes, restrictions nicotine gum.

But really thought point here, you? Xi rule world?  Wow. Shocker. I've taking 10,000IU 2 years also

The amount considered safe significantly lower that. ranked #39 terms deaths per million, seems whatever working pretty well. vitamin sells everywhere. Alright now. really screwed mom. offered let live save money quit job moved three hours away. soon arrived decided sell house. 

I've got car I've got friends couches. I'm hoping get job long. Shoot. get vitamin d. 

30 minutes sun day is. went day... bought rope. go + - side things??? Substance abuse starting reasonable temp solution suicidal impulsivity... even psych.... showered.... 2 days row. know goes + column! FFS. can’t this.

How doing? ""fuck stay home longer allowed participate society think masks fake news"" time sway election. Ignore heap corpses, look well we're coronavirus! 

The reopening also late enough subsequent spike cases happen election over.

Pure evil. People answering question stupid fucking question one answer. Obviously support restrictions indirectly killed 1000 people. can't set hypothetical one ethical answer go ""Gotcha!"" people refuse play retarded mind games. Yep ive taking 2 multivitamins every morning. Clean whistle No,no, don’t understand trying say. agree way best way, possible countries. going put half-assed restrictions doesn’t really much even bother it? Go Swede’s way least business open, least economy doesn’t tank hard, least less people lose jobs, etc

This view probably doesn’t align subreddit though. know. knowing half battle... What's personal, home address? 2000 iu day well within limits. 4000 IU day may getting much. Vitamin weird variable. deficiency often correlated negative results experimental control established fades. tends correlational... often causitive. know transmitted aerosol. Rob Base. study published Lancet... bode well study.

The study also done small group randomly selected dialysis patients.... use magical statistics guess rest.

Studies useful... always accurate would think. according another study California, almost entire state already it....

So... believe study follows approved narrative? 

u/cagewithakay correct. foolish. Now, far studies... know while, certainly 100% accurate. No. elderly high risk lockdown. world needs move on. makes faucis opinion practiced doctor different someone credentials? Asking friend article posted r/nottheonion ? fuck wrong you. realize millions people voted right? Trying keep elderly Democrats away polls. Fuck republicants. pretty safely outdoor activities masks etc. comment aimed people sub circle jerk leaving houses months end. It’s straight posters post r/China , r/sino r/aznidentity opened European tourism pretty early (beginning June) everybody said would death them. Can't wait see people complaining NFL enforcing mask rule say White people make 60% America. top systemic developments created political dominance white majority nation served oppress, subjugate, exploit, sideline people color. 

Sounds like don’t single clue hell talking about. Same. places I've gone Home Depot pick chest freezer, supermarket every 3-4 weeks. panicked smoking decades ago, longer smoke planes doctors offices... case noticed. hurrdurr, dem masks uh govment consphiracuh! thats half question mocking (and answering)

Say - hypothetically - every time opened front door someone dropped dead, stayed home go work, 1000 people would die tomorrow. 

In parody - omitted second half question. community spread bad state, staying away people thing keep high risk family safe. people actually took preventative measures, perhaps strict. led busy, active life covid. I've 20 events cancelled summer, make matter worse, husband can't work due high risk nature job. absolutely used sitting ass. Trust say wish MUCH could live normal life. say, wish one hand, shit other. made strategic moves managed get one coveted cubicles window work. year half working middle room natural light, switch extreme morale booster. Natural light everything also cubicle farms inhumane. Unless someone, also people intentionally releases virus purpose. Perhaps wanting hurt much people possible kind thing, people hate everyone else kind thing. Maybe wanting people turn given kind act. Given maybe people moment; probably idea people may understand dangers; people that'd get angry wearing protection kind thing -- people enforcing beating people wearing protection -- divide other. rule possibility unfriendly people equation - preying vulnerable people causing chaos place, dividing people, wanting people turn purpose.

So virus look 'natural' - could designed way purpose. Ie make smooth sphere made iron, deliberately expose salt water rusting - throw rocks chipping away, denting -- perhaps look 'artificial' looking anymore.

Ie make virus, perhaps looks 'artificial' looking now, symmetrical, maybe even taking features existing viruses, let infect replicate lab conditions. new replicated viruses start look 'natural' - release resulting virus deliberately infect people. 'natural' looking virus. shouldn’t take 4000IU day regularly! get sick would take higher doses short time though Atlantic bubble. visitors including Canadians need isolate 14 days le Orange: *write down! write down!* Honestly I've fair bit heavy sun still low levels. Usually get nice tan summer, however due work erratic hours, pale chicken, man covid gonna hit bad lol infecting people may vaccinated ineffective vaccine, infecting people vaccinated placebo. Eventually, someone die possibly would've never infected all, killed directly due actions researchers.

Volunteers volunteers. long informed risks, there's ethical dilemma. challenge trial also give far valuable insights comparing infection rates control vaccinated groups phase 3 trial (ignoring safety insights). Well yeah afar looks like classic case favoritism. UK authorities cleared Astrazeneca, Canada evaluated well ordered it.
US health authorities crapped people's health decades, seem way overprotective favor local manufacturer. He’s incredible! Definitely deserved award. got friends family vitamin videos months ago parents snowbird ft Myers, year decided spend winter family instead. Gods probably need visa anyway. know cause stomach upset people like us? never asked doctor question. shit. I’m fucked right lol Trash article. vaccine untested vaccine giving tens thousands stage three testing. many guys yelling Chinese treatment Uyghurs? like opportunity yell Chinese, many guys called worse things happen Muslims? state GOP legislators overruled dem governor's measures. breath fine nose. shake head feel pain. throbbing behind eyes. overall fuzzy feeling. day headaches. Worse morning. fuzzier afternoon. 

I'm still issues, taking seems like less often less severe. studies vit inflammatory response. second wave predicted like 5 different times now. I'm sticking ""I'll believe see it"". 4000 known upper limit (above 4,000 negative effects recorded, even rare irregular) 10,000 might begin feel dizzy naseus sometimes. Overdoses (100,000+ daily) cause forgetfulness, extreme nausea, vomiting fatigue.  That's true. cases mean cases. ICAM seems working great. $900,000 per vaccine, buy two get heavy discount, cost $899,999. unconstitutional face. Good luck enforcing Shit. 

I worried that. vit molecules bond fibre go? Assuming basic math . 200,000 x 6 = least 1.2 million dead. assuming 60% immunity threw substantial every time see particular argument made, sample size never 5 cases. I'll check linked tho. careful, much vitamin supplements lead kidney failure Ok, gamble human life. better?

Your name calling projecting quite boring, incorrect, travel quite often. always excited see world leave United States, much every well-traveled American, much excited return home always relieved among fine Americans, thanks. live Greece discussing reason low death rate?
I’m Greek live come realise lot Greeks live really small apartments. top living small space due economic crash years ago many older people adult children living them.
So basically can’t really get want stay in. They’ll time. Walking, sat drinking coffee meeting evening.
I thinking infection climbing death rate whilst increasing nothing like countries Europe.
Obviously weather good weather good South America death rate terrible countries don’t think sunny weather.
I also talking friend lived Mozambique. said death rate wasn’t high felt due lack food. Less obese people.
I’m scientist uneducated opinion.
(And I’m suggesting everyone rush start socialising believe mask, social distancing hand hygiene advice)

But wondering people better chance fighting virus they’re overweight, eat Mediterranean style diet get sit outside keep houses ventilated naturally.
Because infection rate Greece doubled last month 16,500+ confirmed cases deaths 350+ since March entire country.

Now hospital admissions especially Athens doubled I’m saying Greece magic formula 
But interesting see plays winter compared neighbouring countries. Seems work keep borders shut plague rats out. Western Australia hard borders, cases quarantine incoming overseas travellers economy open months. Working great guns. planet thing, collectively eliminated ,we would sweet. unfortunately whatever crazy reasons. Hey, long keeps Cletus, Jim-Bob, Earl making polls, I'm good it. days bed right around election day, problem. mean, flu, right? 99.99% people survive it, right? killing elderly weak, right? UK people love freedom, according BoJo. enjoying it. one goes verify, never get verified vaccine. Vaccines tested humans China need go animal tests, small batches voluntary human tests, large batch tests. standard practice. case it’s research do, it’s fact everyone else put rotating shifts sent home. everything run lab — including janitorial work — me.

And still make grant deadlines Absolutely 100% spot on. Also “saner” 70% cognitive difficulties nuanced complexity major problem; climate change social justice, pandemics wars. People want simple solution challenging problems. Hence rise authoritarian politicians simple message easily fix everything. 

India’s Covid pandemic challenging come. Lol. Yea thats .pointing facts cringe ..gotcha .btw never heard trump guts call nyc mayor mass murderer .honestly makes sick stomach watch man responsible 20k deaths try lecture country handle covid. Meanwhile, half people he's trying save want burn witch. reputable sources. qualified stating ""*record* increases"". 4 vaccines already late state trials predicted used early end year beginning '21 question now? done sooner heck could already vaccine use. starting next year almost seems pointless unless 4 vaccines end failing start square one. ""Running US response covid"" ? response? Sorry missed part.   guess it’ll depend you’re looking for. seem good covid situation. covid sub, people talking moving overseas generally concerned political instability here. visited couple times, wouldn’t recommend unless experienced city living, you’ll working city least millions. It’s crowded, distinct seasons humid summertime, culture time blunt ways demure others. e.g., third question someone met train would like “where work much make month?”

Aside it’s kind sad many people seemingly defeatist attitudes. again, gf putting hold future plans due pandemic election, can’t see us ever living another state much less country (California) South Africa fresh worst winter decade. Hard imagine snow frost Africa, get that. Yeah, sub gotten really fucking weird lately. good chunk top comments people idea going chirping random pessimistic shit. Can’t argue comment worked medical industry, people talk.

Saying ""needs"" storage temp untrue. That's they're early efficacy safety tests test storage conditions later. Two comments deep already bringing Sweden US thread second wave completely separate country Aquarium cleaners didn't? Vitimin-D tablets 5p per day. beneficial health. strange form quackery...?

Just expect cure. Could also Africa outside *in* sun compared America. Lets ignore Finland Norway islands fit story...

What? think this? need read bit Typhoid Mary. story details totally different. got test Amazon seemed pretty reliable yet according Google 530k people went bankrupt medical bills last year. cost much anything costing anything that's difference. Even we're working treatment free deductibles.

Hope OK though. hope Republicans, who've continued ignore actual health care proffesionals. End getting sued oblivion Stop posting news May. look countries moon. They'll still bitching whatabouting cuomo. Yeah want say anything politicians running US response covid. need pretend happening without involvement politics all. lalalala bad, actually. Surprisingly. state funds wasted pointless causes rather struggling families, money could allocated better. could specific sure, I’m that, give quick finance lesson. da fuck 2nd Round? first one end? kidney stones common people drink healthy amount water good diet, taking vitamin fine epically getting less sun. 

I'd say really safe people live UK euro counties pretty much vit deficient year, I've taking well year (lesser dose summer days I've enough sun). 

but yes get advice doctor go ahead Challenge trials won’t make vaccine happen sooner. Even really bad NY still went walks every day. supposed avoid people, still go outside. Sure, let’s completely destroy economy rewarding lawbreakers, got Wisconsin also death rate 0.00003% ages 0-19 0.0002% ages 20-49

Source: CDC Scenario Best Estimates

(I use format automod bans links like sources material calming panic fewer people died reason year (0.2209%) 2018 (0.2341%) 2019 (0.2343%)

So disease life-threatening, tracking fewer deaths nationally, panicked? get technical, thousand year periods overlapped: top declining time. yet fifth world infection rate see big deal.

Think vaccines forced onto people around world, none 'proven' (no vaccine put real placebo test). 

Also vaccines potential permanently injure kill you, written vaccine inserts manufacturers themselves. see 'unknown' risk could worse 'known' risks every vaccine.

The reason criticism country China. give cancer like Johnson Johnson baby powder? Australia: ""Give us access info.""

China: *""What part Chinese people stop liking Australian meat understand.""*

...

Fuck China. people, gonna supplement vit d, start today.

Also -80 different -20 etc, usually give 7 billion vaccines once. sorry! get elect, got deserve. take placebo means water shot contain non active ingredients like conservatives. mistaken assumption China making 1 billion vaccine doses year save world, except certain country perhaps two take political reasons happen number cases world. Ah yes, Schrödinger's US, state thing loosely bound federal government **but** also monolithic entity sea shining sea time think god 100% real end times coming, upmost make happen within lifetimes. assuming good god 20 years ago major news show like 20/20 like interviewing child genius history savant knew things since toddlerhood inspired awe even notion reincarnated intelligence beheld knowledge. end interview 9 year old gets morose sad almost pleading, closes conversation saying: “the US fall like Roman Empire. know it.” kid, too, never forgot it. Trump speaking poorly make Biden good speaker. point article trying make regarding world judging US may valid, it’s still poorly written article.

Singular quotes unofficial people - reads reporters stopped people street. one research study cited wasn’t even linked credibility.

I expect NY Times. Gladly seems like excuse shitty things moved Vietnam alone without knowing language. fine. imagine letting millions people die suffer long term illness reduced lung capacity heart problems stop partying year. eyes glanced right post see r/COVID19_support.

Hopefully already aware taking advantage whatever offer. Although, may people needing help one able offer any.

I can't speak feelings isolation since thrive it. problem around people problematic variety reasons.

I always small group friends, would rarely hang them. (work? really work though, like voluntary fun) environment I'd find around anybody. playing kids. would even kids thank playing them, seriously need since like playing. wonder ""grown-ups"" ever grow it.

But could drop friends heartbeat I've done different reasons (their drug use lack ethics realizing used).

However, find enjoyments ""run"" them. quote ""run"" pun since exercise one component love do, well challenging ways, field expertise, something new/different.

I can't tell (outside social), see find would make happy even distraction real world.

I've end-stage child one attempt. Also, one people went pills approach, called us help ran get stomach pumped. married kids last time checked.

There need 50 years. go back taken 2 weeks, vaccine pumped out, I'd bank comfort level everyone come back quickly. might suggest waiting least since already waited long.  Also I’m going go ahead say less entitled group people. First worlders reluctant give normal life benefit others. merchant republic sounds lovely many levels. almost nothing stop pandemic. 

I watching American tv since child. keep pushing “we best country world” message. I’m older realize it’s true they’re even close. POTUS unthinkable. He’s threatening democracy frightening amount population happy it. It’s scary sad time. 

I’m sure wool pulled eyes drastic shift happened. always real America? hope not. Shame ya can't use US invented equipment top 27 hospitals world. Bet least handful people mile long ER lines wearing American sports jerseys tho. “Most people would rather live different country” says #1 country world people moving it. Lol. get award exactly wrong. people trouble believing it. suggesting inferior intelligence? remember days  funny image head Treadu looking like pincushion 20million needles body head. live UK. feel sorry Americans read news government facepalm. ""Herd immunity."" using word wrong. Herd immunity applies given population... means changes based included talking it. instance, 5 people household. us sick coronavirus antibodies. Thats 100% infected 5 family members. Therfore herd immunity. one big herd many smaller ones. family friends personal herd, town neighborhood might considered ""community herd."" whole nation wide herd thing ridiculous even say though. There's 320+ million Americans. never even see. like there's one huge herd deer roaming earth, there's one huge herd people roaming earth. much easier contain imported cases. 

Right China needs export impacted places world, *it you* understand. seriously, excuses. kids die flu every single year one ever even batted eye. 

“Only” appropriate word use here. condescending completely ignore dumping migrants Nauru almost sound less like self important hypocrite didn’t already want jump cliff? wealthiest owners America riled hoards they've kept stupid long prevent loss power 50 million Americans dictate populist nationalist paradigms rest us. granted apathy greater evil. got watch wheels fall deal it. one hundred thousands feels woozy second title talks concerna, almost vaccines worse side effects called front runners? Seems little biased doesn’t it? XD u.s. blood millions southern american people hands. bullshit pulled rising domestically, yay! go again. One remember Muslim ban China virus rethoric see comments came (still wrong, agree you). Still, ""racism"" criticism aimed China virus rethoric, closing airspace.   
   
I think difficult see people cry 'fire' everytime see pyromaniac lighting cigarette. live UK. free health care. one goes bankrupt get injured. benefit America could outweigh this. abolished slavery knew right

And thank you, appreciate it. Ren also says thanks. ^__^ way did. countries BMI probably dropped % Actually, evidence opposite. People currently positive tend deny symptoms, stop wearing masks, stop social distancing head work. probably, know, read trial data right lists extent side effects. US government already ordered 100 million doses $10 Americans innoculated free. Janssen already manufacturing risk behemoth pharma company much produce global scale; fact they're running what's easily largest trial (60,000 subjects) without government funding make reach clear.

Lolwat unfortunately appears Trump symptom, root cause.

Under rated comment. He's let genie bottle exposed ugly part America see. Critical thinking made problems people live......and still does..... people like people like ask questions answers become 'weird' one fact weird ones believe anything without asked critical questions. True, true. survived Caligula. was....monstrous. anybody conducted studies yet long term effects reproductive system? there's anything might spur selfish type mindset give shit getting infected, would fertility/virility. accurate honestly lol fabric.

Arizona world-class bad back July, people calling ""Ronazona"" Well, yes no. Lots countries experiencing rising infection rates extended measures. sense US isn’t worse off. However, polarization caused pandemic seem largely subsided many countries, people seem converged common vievpoint whole topic. sense, US definitely worse off, it’s still highly politicized. watched realise people believe random thing.

100% legal studied roman history made focus undergrad. 

Nope. even close. Trump blink eye. many donald trumps rome wonder Rome became strong. Americans starting realize wall really for. digging tunnels shit near future. argue never intended democracy money making machine. revolution fought economic reasons, desire democracy. quite doubt mind whether oft touted value ""democracy"" actually ever mattered anyone good excuse. “Over two centuries, United States stirred wide range feelings rest world: love hatred, fear hope, envy contempt, awe anger,” columnist Fintan O’Toole wrote Irish Times. “But one emotion never directed towards US now: pity.” Dont be. 

We deserved it. Karma's long time coming. Please go whole ""this country broken, fix it"" textbook Fascism. called Strongman tactics every single Fascist regime used that. 

First find scapegoat/s, 

Blame faults country scapegoat/s 

Only save country scapegoat/s 

For Hitler Jews socialist, Mussolini socialists Ethiopians, Trump Democrats Antifa 

Fascism also nationalistic militaristic. 

Mussolinis fascist thugs, blackcoats, wore uniforms based Italian military WW1 March streets weapons fear intimidation. 

Sound familiar? 

Now get wrong, lot democrats used tactics, sure. innocent. Trump administration used almost every single Fascist tactic history. 

Its incredibly frustrating happening right eyes. mean people Sweden like Americans general. Immigration authorities might another thing. always come tourist. stay need study job see would impossible get. easy definitely impossible. blame CIA- church hearings Congress voters knew nothing about. stuff even president fully aware of. don’t even realize it. Clearly know different lockdowns around world. Like reddit socialists travel. oh mean like reddit? According data sheet flu vaccine got 2 weeks ago, 1/10 people. That's problem. particles? aerosols person, micro fibers fabric? promise anything like ""no tears"" crap keep :) feel sorry. Internet problem first place. thing social media, people kept bullshit views people knew, people ridiculous idea, couldnt find group sympathize easily.

now... post bs internet, someone agree.

social media needs die.  fact im able discuss anything know are, youre from, real tie real life, problem. Nobody pays attention them. walk way around get pasta end one aisle, walk people waiting check out. make sense. suggesting supposed ""health individuals"" wear masks ever?


They never forced happens google search images ""asian wearing masks"" (without quotes)?

Your gotcha Google people wearing masks, images masks comes ? shit sherlock.

As mentioned wear sick, deal pollution. also anti social measure stop people engaging them. Aww boo hoo buildings got burned cause dont want us shoot black people even though wanna!! Get real. None buildings worth single life system taken name status quo. Instead expecting people live way system decides, maybe challenge system like Americans think would. think participants Boston tea party deserving death too? all, standards, law breaking inherently unjust can't karma people made possible untouched. I'm sorry healthcare workers. Register absentee voter, first. fuck lot kids adults if/when ""go back normal"" bring home family members. 9 year old literally sighed relief sending back school mask mandate hubby juvenile diabetes. also negative thoughts words neighbors kids in-school/hybrid different situations. 

I might spend money locally mask mandate since ""recommendation"" county, delivery stick 90% time. single-handedly keep local businesses open sure, health precaution mandates hurting local businesses. can't trust others community decent human beings one hold accountable stick home. wasn’t debate, son. basically use poor guinea pigs? Excellent idea, holiness. get fetishes? Another big one populists around world cut scientific critical thinking (manipulative) rethoric curriculums. learned Hitler's manipulative rethoric twisted truth favor made rise power compulsory school. taught anymore... Australia national majority state leaders followed science medical advice locked required political high. largely non political issue. 

People understand large degree sacrifices needed made greater good lest country turn shit kill many thousands people. 

Case numbers entire country less 20 day. Apart tourism arts/entertainment country operating relatively normally.

We've watching horror bewilderment goings USA. seems rights without responsibility. mean pirate social dilemma right?

dont encourage people give pedophiles money.

have people seriously forgotten cuties bullshit already? China let happen. believe travel globe. absolutely case foreign socialists reddit. blame internet bankrupting newspapers. would work. takes quite long time, vaccines become available 21, kind limited, regional herd immunity likely. New Hampshire, can't even keep interstate rest areas open year. mean “I don’t know” “let’s change subject suffer cognitive dissonance.” Since seems nothing anyone actually prevent Florida itself, least highly interesting watch. 

Although data support claim, surely Florida among states resistant covid restrictions. super late adopt masks summer surge, DeSantis refusing close things along. infamously opened Disney World height outbreak. put near top ""resistant"" states.

So happens now? I'm curious see. SURELY stubborn population, reopening schools, businesses pretty much open full capacity, perfectly time flu season arrive, stacked top fact although Florida ""decent"" decline recently, baseline cases still pretty unacceptable (especially given pretty large decrease testing) - pretty much shittiest possible response do. 

So basically, Florida gonna answer question I've wondering while: bad population get hit thing twice? far US, we've seen grand total zero examples hard-hit area got exponential spread control (NY, NJ, FL, TX, AZ, CA) actually experienced anything resembling second surge. one time one time across board. comes exhibit A. happens one areas pretends over. probably Covid. said, look free testing site nearby. can't hurt peace mind. Really. even think Pope would caught dead there. We're still dealing ones created mid East. Yes. worry, thinking start colony isolated edge empire.. Nah people suck they're unhappy want everyone else unhappy well Personal responsibility personality trait shaped upbringing environment, clearly something else happened compensated lack formal education. Funny examples always come back US. least people confident wearing masks, infect possibly cause someone else's worse cause someone's death able see person's facial expression solely mouth? much really missing seeing someone's mouth?


You would point, fact people never felt guilty spreading diseases may kill people. mention masks 100% effective abd asymptomatic transmission viruses thing paint picture something like that, yet also online interacting people without seeing/hearing expressions/vocal tone. must bleak paint be.

Reddit substitute real human interaction. substitute see someone laugh smile hug them. things want removed utopian world. Never knew Anti American subreddit. Go figure. USA declined post WW2 mountain top still ranks Top 20. list consists European nations also declining based post WW2 ideology share. future Asian reject ideology. 

Americans abandoned math science favor social awareness athletics. Take zero mg each. Imagine wondering back work one gives shit feed family keep rolling even though quarter world actually work home. 

Guess picked better major. ""My son went Sturgis, got was..."" Reddit: sharing simple data point gets downvoted oblivion. Lol likely test regularly anyway guys revolution ruled someone 'selected god'?

USA seems broken war problems listed may start. first thing somehow needs happen people need somehow stop left right, black white, start human beings focus similarities rather differences. TL;DR

Because social distancing, peak flu season might later, like February March.

Some doctors think waiting til mid October might mean better immunity months.

Yes, proper mask use shown slow spread. disagreeing that. 

You’re simply minority proper mask usage. walking around downtown city hour show that. Sit near restaurant watch people take off/apply masks. People remove them, put table, eat without sanitizing anything. Yes adapt conveys different context use change not? guessing last governor get Maine's. Hence hospital wards placed underground parking garages instead cars. People go grocery stores work. Every time enter public space, they're putting lives risk selfish pieces trash think mask affront freedom. Americans really dumbest society Earth. imagine dictatorial pope year! Nobody wearing masks sent us home.  yeah, smell mask masks.  Maybe N95, many people use those.

Fuerza Argentina! sick days. work tech company working home since March 14th. covid sick could work home burn sick day. 

Now cant ask go work home anymore. Thankfully sick since first week got sent home March. covid symptoms fever nothing passed wife 2 daughters Wait, would smell mask? strong? Would right interpretation say Covid *could* pretty much cause 50-100 years Flu deaths single year? Look bar graph global daily new cases deaths at: initial spike March/April, deaths curve fairly flat since May. Different parts world outbreaks different times, sum planet always added around 5,000 deaths per day (averaged week). vaccine arrives, reason believe curve heading zero time soon. looks like US, Brazil, Mexico even India might slowing, European countries picking again. Grandparents Florida kiss ass goodbye. setting education 2.7 million kids, 1.1 million people unemployed, thousands businesses already closed ever? sure policies aren’t creating bigger problem trying solve? probably won’t able get vaccinated 3 months gets distributed public. People led Dan Forrest Trump thought needed revenue. That’s they’re putting poll taxes felons, right?? need revenue??? someone country 1000s cases contract tracing people gonna hear one even knows it? confirm. Neighbor tried go wedding Tijuana let cross boarder.. yet 23 year old sister able fly Dallas TX Cabo week. didnt quarantine anything Disgusting Well, should. asked many died without underlying health issues. That's 6% according CDC. 

I know 94% also Covid 19 deaths. I'm saying covid 19 deaths 6% underlying health issues. *facepalm*

No words  Yes say ""capitalism opposite morality"" Disagree, healthcare front lines get first. Started business February confirm, got fucked. No, wont, milestone make without giving clearly make next year since made one. Sorry say, guy. Hmmm sure ... 

Where could numbers come from?

I wonder ...

Wish kind source. Oh well ... almost like taxation theft remember studies medical professionals. usually talking rare side effects. Scary stuff see scary rare side effects lots scary diseases like flu coronaviruses.

This stuff important people treating studying disease understand regular person like reading freak accidents time. run risk becoming irrationally paranoid walk street.  Well can't change world worry. right thing What's like, hour half intensive care? conservative using threat physical violence get way!? unheard of... way world works developed world front line third world back. true. Mobility data makes painfully obvious effective mitigation staying away people truly feel way among others all. need stay inside, socially distance, wear mask go day weird, gave cookie thing that's Well person family get sick, would definitely much worse. kids close age. continue careful wife worked medical office. Every day cried anxiety afraid would bring covid home 2 daughters me. 

She change clothes garage comes evening.

She quit job 3 weeks ago much happier hear man. Working constantly like sucks ass. People tell bullshit grateful job don’t see it’s sucking life you, ever considering options leisure slim pretty much everything sucks. blessing curse really. least money though, don’t discount cause someday, hopefully soon, you’ll get reap fruits labor.

No one tells do

Fuckin morons Guys, thank replies. I’m learning lot find fascinating! Tomography CT assume. situation would probably indicate retest given potential false negatives. possible could non-covid pneumonia well. Voters? certain party voters? Wait, money fungible? stock

and havent seen ton trial data. think phase 3 havent seen yet (but applies producers) stupidity Yeah, example UK excess deaths 60-65k whilst COVID-19 deaths 45k. Russia excess deaths also 60-70k COVID-19 deaths 20k. That's quite undercounting. get even less developed countries, can't trust stats normal times let alone now. would Syria know many people actually dying refugee camps COVID-19 rather causes? barely enough resources basic medicine, let alone diagnose people COVID-19. First world countries resources wealth struggling get true number deaths. chance 2nd 3rd world countries reporting anything close accurate number deaths? government exactly created bitcoin, example? occurred me, hospitals for-profit too. opinion “vulnerable people” say? Grandma tell isn’t accepting visitors wants. French president thinking? bad Greek one groupie. high risk unlikely harm you. kids socializing kids year definitely harms them.

If high risk must contact high risk people tough choice. Hello friendo lost? mentioned report, reports mentioned two Qingdao cases discovered part routine tests workers, apparently tested every two weeks. negative previous swab. China level routine testing non-healthcare workers, city never outbreak, seemed unlikely silent community transmission.  Fake news.  look it. suddenly say ""wait, US 7 million cases, 33 million"" virus suddenly much less fatal. 33 million study projects almost certainly low anyway, again... Less fatal.


Even there's still 10x people could catch it.

Then many people die?


200,000…... 2,000,000???



Focusing percentage rate population 330 million ridiculous. Nah feel you. live TN every time go outside Nashville live, go non-national chain type stores barely see anyone wearing masks lol. went arcade hour Nashville shocked walked lol. Maybe 10-15% people wearing masks even staff would walk around without them. Felt like taking time machine back 2019 almost. Yet TN's numbers continue improve terms cases hospitalizations stay flat. ""Never wore masks mandatory"" correct English.

Also live NZ, masks ever essential public transport. Everywhere else encouraged people don’t seem understand it. ""Guys, hold beer!""

""Ahhhh, fuck me! I'm fucked now! Guys, save first!""

Hmmm... I'll fine, I've done research. data shows fine too, enjoy scared. know better. starting evidence long term negative effects 50, safety anyway, stopping spread vulnerable. need, one off. Seriously, anyone take us refugees? Yeah. none listed. 🤣😂🤣 Probably much except whopping sore arm maybe fever stuff. Relax be, others sacrificing neatest vaccine Sure thing: UT 1450ish today climbing pop like 3.5 million. Terrifying. sure. One five people New York city antibodies late May. case everyone, would 1.6 million people 1 7000 chance dying every time used car, nobody would drive. remember saying, “Well, bad could get? There’s checks balances stuff.” gets re-elected, I’ll train kid hunger games guess. Yep they're complete dicks people stand real chance getting this. longest time stuck asking nicely prleople right thing. woukd farther ahead would've dicks covid measures. idea flawed basically advocating mask usage mixing people short times close proximity prolonged amounts time like bars restaurants.

Rendering anout effective chocolate fireguard.

Not mention, given choice wearing mask train hours driving. would pick driving every time scenario. kudos, set environmental causes back bit. like 10 minutes. nah ""prey"" away gain ability peer abyss gain eldrich power. Based current conditions, said, state forecasting 4,864 people hospitalized COVID-19 Oct. 25, increase roughly 89% Wednesday, 2,578 patients. 

So, re-opening minimally questionable. And, course, perfect time bring back college football CA. Yup. shit Tick tock, ya stop... Don’t worry, auditors careful, made sure dividends stock buybacks came money would used paychecks PPP, instead PPP money itself. it’s good, right?!?!? people, redditors!

if want extra careful tho, choose beween emdash, endash, hyphen, etc I'm FL, barely won. decided something like 10k votes. 

But we're YOLO pandemic, plenty opportunity test vaccine candidate. agree waiting completely, we're exactly that. noting kindergarten necessarily textbook learning itself. School massive paradigm shift age, kindergarten introduce kids it. stupid take People quick assume data “fudged” (particularly case Florida.) cases certain extent may be, believe likely scenario challenges data itself. 

Data tough. multiple streams data coming many different disparate sources. state governments aren’t Google Amazon. rely in-house data scientists either non-existent low paid. use whatever cheapest third party contractors find. 

All real time data released press general public constantly leaving virtually room cleansing fixing.

The points failure endless. Impossible. mask mandate.  math difference 7x. You’re 7x likely die Covid Florida. 7x worse. thats mask culture true social distancing finally starting flattening curve.

Youre also completely ignoring statistical significance dying isnt great bar. Long terms issues significantly reported (asthma cardiovascular issues name few), huge financial strife via medical bills, weeks months work, spreading others exponentially means entire work forces sick swaths. economy doesnt rely people dead, need to... ya know... healthy. Shocking Redheads FTW Ugh Korea Taiwan locked contact traced hard. mailed people quarantine. they're mostly top locked couple months IIRC airlines projected take 2023 get back pre-pandemic business.

That mean flights available 2021, take longer rebuild blistering robustness Jan/Feb 2020 economy.

But yeah, there's widespread vaccine, masks long world. Restaurants certainly getting back 100% capacity outside urban centers, within them. Cruises flights least option fan significantly course year, even idiosyncrasies depending COVID-19 conditions per country. big load crap anyway regurgitating information we’ve hearing literally year we'll agree disagree.

I certainly want wear mask constant basis either. times mind all, it'd examples provided. Seriously, (think) know exactly feel.

It's sickening pit stomach getting worse worse lately. feel like US political system far beyond repair. ice melting, animals dying droves. Since RBG passed away, ""jokes"" orange ape ramming win... seeing nothing hate every. single. day. crushing feeling world thought knew left long time ago. think original point loaded question, try corner discussion.

I say you, riding motorcycle inherently dangerous, imposes burden population, enclosed vehicles. Acknowledge not. downplay want, risks still there. Damn. Well said man. Good you. right. 

I'm going take live. biggest issue think parents young kids, can't afford work, cant afford babysitter (its seriously like 20 30k per year)

Which probably like u.s. parents young children heard “_______ Covid-19 vaccine produces strong immune response” many times. Going winter. could possibly go wrong? RemindMe! 1 month everything crazier florida I’ve pondered got dragged suggesting it. don’t know else explain declining new cases. certainly isn’t decided wear masks stay socially distant. least, vantage point Atlanta things become way lax past month. “republican” calls large centralized government make laws over-ruling smaller local governments.....solid. Transmission disease one another another extremely rare. 25% sound accurate anyone?

I'd guess 10% closer. Maybe less. Woa there. start people vote incompetence. Fauci Redfield literally word word said two days ago. nah day vaccine widespread go back normal go get vaccine wherever whenever delicious marinade poor young children..... makes sense, since there's one American's hate Americans put jail. Hard socially distance reliably wildly popular propaganda inspiring certain group harass people take pandemic maturely inspires general disregard old sick people. especially efficient that's pretty much thing they've decades. Probably get employer healthcare. funny fail comprehend Tegnell says article, even less funny fail understand article old. sure read Swedish? thought saying fewer 1 10 implies actual rate known cases higher proportion therefore things could get lot worse.

An interesting point, hadnt considered that.

You're right, cases good bad. Probably good bad means minor symptoms assuming antibodies hold up.

Side note: reddit full different perspectives really appreciate it. loans bail out. bribe layoff employees lockdowns. nothing dividends buybacks. they’re anything like state decide means go back school open everything up! Let’s go dine now! I'm pretty sure got sick restaurant

A lot probably though. would pretty satisfying. may looking for: study done Tokyo. Super interesting results ton interesting potential implications. study somewhat limited take tracked employees single company. So, theory, could far higher exposure general population. But, Tokyo extremely dense public transportation used lot perhaps study still representative. highlights:

47% (!!!!) cohort developed antibodies study. Antibodies short lived (about 1 month). one hospitalized/died. 

So obvious question much spread occurred Japan compared confirmed testing population handled relatively little issue. man hate democracy much? Disney World, Universal, SeaWorld, Legoland. 

They need revenue, I'm sure tourists gonna come running. Burning sofa analogy great, haha. Thanks hope gets eaten alive horde iguanas.  Yeah think got lucky, relatively speaking. Still, find surprising western vaccine gone old-school method point, clearly safe. Seems like would good idea get least one egg long-enduring basket. 2 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday.

Qingdao far tested 12,492 people, negative. Looks like control far. Contact tracing still progress, I'm gonna use boogeyman H.I. word something I'd start call virus burnout. quarter third place's population infected, virus starts running people infect. Imagine virus every fourth person came around to, infect. Gets tough. TLDR: 15 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 30 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Definitely. Started handing resume unprompted stores, especially stuff I’m knowledgeable in. boredom real. Oh cool! dosage use? Looks pretty cheap Amazon, figured powerful sell counter haha Never.

Every flu season on, masks *required*, least countries greedy, individualistic cultures like U.S. Maybe countries stay ""recommended"" (just already *have been* East Asian countries), work U.S. one would listen.

Masks another part ""new normal"", along increased work-from-home, increased online school, heavier importance placed sanitation, practical abolishment indoor dining, local lockdowns whenever cases rise certain amount. *not* going back. Get used it.   acid reservoirs Divine punishment whole world? Well I’ve actually heard every one take vitamin supplements winter since there’s less sunlight (and prob go outside less) Trump outlawed it. turning skin orange. true, point times walk away somewhat nuanced view type google different opposing ideas, people dont even attempt. family ive showed quickly disproved something basic, hear spouting new stuff easily disprovable didnt check it. simply seem prefer living reality shaped wants actual events. ppl tend lean religious That’s kind I’ll manage. handle hardship. Please save generosity families experiencing significant hardship/illness/homelessness. handle sleeping stars roughing bit. You’re kind fellow offering honestly many responses given hope. Cheers! trump right /s 7 millions confirmed amount cases. Actual amount people infected much higher - CDC suggested earlier week around 10% US infected.

Further, current state last decade that’s suggesting saying cases continue rob generation - that’s ridiculous statement. Pandemics end socially medically, still cases Bubonic Plague pop time time. evidence suggest even without vaccine would “new normal” decade. Mom calls obsessive I’m like well it’s keep safe. Dr Rhonda Patrick said several months ago JRE. every person different. consult doctor instead listening sky news random redditors literally person bringing USA 🤦‍♀️ pandemic-ignorant party tourists accuse Austria turn accused neighbours back home. Second surge where? state. Chill useless titles. close. - exactly fun! 
its minds work - we're able conceptualise ideas - heads - opposed reacting real world stimuli - thats intelligence is. Rather reacting stomach telling you!

But welcome answer question. would venture bet 90% would lockdown. *cries vitamin deficiency* Search Dr Li-Meng Yan, grab seat Murica bad November. Murica bad downvote Interesting, one considering small Magnesium supplement order support process creating bio-active form? magnesium deficiency much rarer supplements aren’t needed? Well no, would Republican party's abysmal response Toooo bee fairrrrr facebook pouring gas fire. Yea person replied talking ass. Thanks offer. definitely reach out. Cheers. yeah, hospitals overwhelmed people staying home may start demanding lockdown order force shitheads stop infecting others. agreed, though consider stupidity, speed depth, like poor judgement ideas body literally resistant vitamin - genetic form rickets. employer doesn’t believe working home even though entire job done remotely. act like I’m working remotely... physically office. primary care provider geneticist refused sign notes let work home. 

My primary care provider said don’t anything worry about. studies she’s seen samples small opinion draw conclusions. 

My geneticist said risk factor much greater others age range; however, “you don’t bad someone aged 61 underlying health conditions.” may undesired effect. don’t think Hilarious yet sadly pathetic. Asking someone wear mask shaming them, done intent protect literally everybody else. person asked wear mask feels shame. usually Republicans Republicans respond shame confused anger.

Something basic lack empathy unable process certain emotions. Cases already rising since school started, seem farfetched things get worse. Pretty much it. Entertainment experiential marketing. point exactly? Since dont understand basic mathematical models dont mean anything? it?

Do idea ridiculous sounds regular people? lived Washington state whole life people took covid seriously, wore masks, etc.

Now live AZ like 40% people wear masks stores even mandate, lot people don’t think it’s big deal. course understand WA blue, AZ red obviously it’s warm AZ year round Washington gets pretty cold like May. Since vitamin levels probably higher AZ constant sunshine reason people don’t take seriously compared WA? people aren’t affected bad they’re getting vitamin sun? Idk rest world, America buy vitamin section. Would recommend, weren’t kidding nightmares. wouldn’t say they’re frequent take it, boy oh boy vivid. would convenient since immunity probably lost within year. Uk study think  Good reason Governor. Generally speaking inhabitatnts northern regions world advised take one dose vitamin daily October April think reality Nero late little bit far away Rome tried best days stop fire help people definitively sing...

Hearing rumor singing fire even starting fire, opened inquiery find culprit. collaborator prompted christians. Christianity new sect really known. persecution killed around 300 people, far away numbers Roman historians christian writers.

Tacitus hated shows texts. 9 fire, others Roman historians born fire. I'm sorry, polygamy illegal here. get that. cases, caused denser population, makes sense resources/man power stretched overworked.

Obviously factors. population density definitely big one. works you. lot parents, it’s going work. parents literacy limitations language limitations, expected teach children? mention child children learning challenges. parents don’t inherently understand teaching. did. case across board. Didn’t hear??? Herbie said road recovery! Everything going okay! /s

It’s truly frustrating watch happen. big thing much calcium though arrhythmia. much little fuck heart conduction system. dont believe im immune whatsoever. 100% agree points, think people susceptible combination lack education (how painstaking actual research..), brainwashing (religion teaching trust facts yo young age shaming curiosity..), good old character flaws (i personally consider lack cognitive dissonance character flaw, may well narcissism spectrum). never thought Reddit would defending Karens bio active, thus quicker working, form vitamin d. Vitamin tablets take time require magnisium make bio active form. Sharing good. sharing virus ? young people organizing COVID parties might happy sign up. Portugal aswell Netherlands look excess deaths. objective way comparing since countries count report differently. TIL! understanding Vitamin negative acute phase reactant means serum levels drop presence acute inflammation

It looks like study retrospectively looked correlation serum vitamin levels survival

Could results explained fact worse disease/inflammation causing low vitamin levels, rather way around?

It’s probably bad idea supplement, UK 10micrograms/day recommended general population winter months generally don’t get enough sunshine good reason skeptical works, right unlikely hurt. go nuts (or bad manufacturer) harm much vitamin D.  told take largest meal better absorption. one? know mean darkness. walking every single day, regardless topic.

Actually, thing makes feel reassured everyone wearing masks. Nothing magical it. advocate civic duty basic human decency prepared face criticism wish protect families. Happy 🎂 day individual moral ethical decision. point decide stop wearing mask see people around still wearing masks.

Or decide never stop wearing mask. control vaccine control who's economy recovers first post-COVID-19 world. 


So saying Chine value $ health people. Frankly bit scary, maybe surprise. Ummm Source? health department dashboard says 6.91% Yeah life back normal months wreaking havoc already malfunctioning brain. Well DUH. nothing new. Lately I've considering calling man ""Tulsa Doom"" leads snake-worshipping death cult. ""fat donny"" nice simple like it. population density impact case fatality ratio?

I could see impact overall case numbers, Belgium densely packed

But you’re diagnosed, Belgian 7x likely succumb disease Californian.

That, me, means we’re counting cases deaths differently. disease isn’t lethal one side ocean relative country argument every conspiranoic telling how's magnesium calcium intake? supposedly three supposed balanced. d3 sufficient right? taking 75-100mcg day (equivalent 3k-4k iu) Human beings work hospitals tired. didn’t work. worst people (Florida) county college students (ages 28-24 we've spikes, careless parties 3-4 weeks), present restrictions already ignored them. probably one messed comments I’ve seen Reddit.

Buy drug store like Walgreens Ok say bc products saved lives? No? little hypocritical..... Yep. They’re agreeing observation 100%. They’re adding commentary insight relevant article. wonder rate death increase come winter. Less sunlight means less vitamin D. 100% agree. levels 15 stated healthy range 30-80. I’m back 50 range taking 5000 units daily like mentioned. go high dose 50000 units week things leveled definitely consult doctor available you. wont.

Better marsupial nematode  He's right wrong that. That's opinion comes play, whether prioritize lives livelihoods. probably around 50-75% effective (at least, Oxford/AstraZeneca one is).

We know vaccines efficacy yet. Stop posting misinformation please. taking extra steps rather waiting two three months confirm worst.

Absolutely. took drive dogs today, get out, way back thought, let’s grab fresh fruit veggies store; parking lot packed “nope’d” there, early mornings seem best It’s pretty awful. quit week ago despite job, I’m starting feel better better.

It's certainly useful next pandemic. help anyone now. Neither ghoulish pleasure thread subreddit authoritarian lockdowns throughout. Chilling home can, wearing masks can't. pretending there's going miracle ends Covid overnight. Viral domestication well understood phenomenon.

9/11 actually pretty great comparison. tragic was, reality ""disease burden"" 9/11 terms lives lost *not* terribly significant grand scheme things. certainly far *less* severe annual disease burden motor vehicle accidents (which result 30-40,000 deaths several million ER visits US every year). greatest damage 9/11 came form (a) *terror* / trauma attack inflicted psyches hundreds millions Americans (b) *our hysterical over-reaction* 9/11, i.e., loss civil liberties blood treasure (estimated $6.4 *trillion*) squandered endless Middle Eastern wars (not mention God-knows-how-much time, money, aggravation spent / wasted past two decades result airport security theater 9/11 gave rise to).

Are kidding me? Nothing's stopping people going walk around block park. wear face mask come close people.

Guess vitamins cure cancer since there's probably study somewhere happening once. hard time understanding way guys think. 

Your saying unemployment, lockdowns, sacrifice economy, hundreds thousands deaths thought something fake???

Really? Calm fuck down, folks.   hospitilisation rise.. even small first sign brewing  Covid plenty scary. people scared opted brainwashed. Yeah rather wade medical advice territory figured would leave comment regarding labels medicine vials (I meant prescription decided touch post)

Follow instructions maybe take something. unnatural feeling. job like this. arrived sun came got home went down. It’s like isolated daylight week.

Edit: like username. Playing words fun. AdmiralAckbama would fun one too. Joe rogans gonna love Huh? Sorce that? Cause yes cash become less less used doubt become totally useless. Stuff like groccery stores essential buisness like probably keep taking cash, otherwise im sure outcry.

It also probably depends are. Areas lot immigrants probably also cash users much doubt stop. US bad! - wrote thesis ya Joe Rogan right US bad! - wrote thesis ya science, yes, want know.

It's really hard hurt taking much vitamin D, unless use shitty manufacturer. take it.

But still want know. There's lot things besides coronavirus vitamin affects. Knowing supplements work matters, maybe interventions. Good know wintertime rough Yeah 16k WOULD BE, aren’t 16k yet. You’re comparing today’s US numbers hypothetical future Canadian number. steep decline

that I'm seeing graphs. Seems like decline two months ago. Last month stayed pretty flat account holiday throwing reporting metrics causing big dip big spike.

If reopening leads infections, likely will, see deaths go too. DeathSantis  Johnson Johnson? Maybe thought people would understand UV light treat viruses. Anecdotal: Northern cave-dweller, found D3 supplement 1800 IU daily alleviated persistent (several decades) skin condition seemed related sun exposure, 800 IU daily not. YMMV. Overall believe Orlando handled things well. little everyone denial things got little tense cases started rising bars restaurants opened first time. true leaders rise local community- transparent staff members caught Covid went back pick ups only. think opened lot eyes. Mask wearing really increased that. 

It seems like many business owners learned experience. Already I’ve seen lot local businesses announce social media still enforcing social distancing mask requirements, going back full capacity yet. JOE ROGAN said since beginning. Honestly get people like him. months, we're fucking tired miserable. whatever need backend, come interviews sounding grim gloomy Yep that's reason, smart. People get covid cause get enough vitamin D!

Wow redditers solved racism too! I'm proud you. can't convince people 210K+ deaths something worry about.. medical info pissing wind. I’ve never issue doctor ever recommended taking food. people really need get 2-week nonsense. major event happens going create new surge/clusters going take 4-6 weeks actually show data unless huge amount people get sick immediately. get plenty sun started taking vitamin supplement anyway ask people: many people would take coordinate this. even provide excess yearly death rate still gets doubted.

If assume number substantially higher. Whoa. definitely checking out! Thanks tip :) Two parties refused comply second including telling ignore police. think would many anti lockdown protests minded business.

I could see shaming working bubble/family strangers? feel emboldened them. I'm sitting toilet smoking cigarette even I'm voting you, dumbass.

Still part original comment: I'm dumbass still smoking, know. idiot trumper strong one. makes sense. Started taking 5000 IU started, helps, great.. not, well maybe good either way. live NE deficient love winter, SAD me. :P Oh no, must sucked. think people sensitive lower levels zinc (edit: mean iron) multivitamin. Especially pregnant people. hard time iron supplements themselves, like you. You’re totally right MK-7 (I going memory). checked supplement told us use it’s blend MK-4 MK-7! Must've nice teachers stayed home...just think back pay much time, people like you, wasted. volunteer hospitals energetic. many, need reverse course ASAP. saying full lock back basics. Take only, get together, work school. Please point quotes articles saying this. you’re talking phases governments instituted vaccine treatments found (at least state)- guidelines change. hard fast. I’m California metrics restrictions changed twice already since March.

Although hate comparing anything Spanish Influenza since different medically advanced much since time, everything went back normal 2-2.5 years. without vaccine sufficient treatment. America, yes. Africa. Black people America getting enough sunlight (vitamin D) black people Africa. think black people Africa get way vitamin black people America. That's guess. Vitamin mainly received sunlight, also get food. 30,000 IU day I’m feeling good. heavier set guy blood concentration tolerate Yes. Arizona well. would great California shut highways roads Arizona. Well stay inside, follow strict precautions chances getting low. go Trump rally wear mask around hundreds people think virus hoax, yeah Russian Roulette lots loaded chambers. analogy original post meant gambling peoples lives. guess hindsight said that. People also choose stay home. stay home hide bed, you’re going OK. I’m positive COVID. got two weeks sore throat runny nose. possible actual sickness? it’s system still? I’m testing Monday. 

Also, grandparents exposed heavy smokers. preparations take things go south? Stalker boy 🤣🤣🤣 That’s pretty high dose! It’s recommended take 4000IU day, recommended 2000IU day (50mcg). Hope come you’re ok probably make feel home. He's institutions life, starting young teen. came age prison system, times again, longer stretch murder charge couple years, think know live world anymore. Sun exposure much better vitamin D, Western Europe people get enough sun. work inside, cover skin clothes, sun strong, use sunscreen blocks UV light creates vitamin D. Sun exposure good limited amounts, resulting sunburn. 

You cannot overdose vitamin sun exposure, vitamins stay 2x longer body supplement vitamins. overdose supplements. 50.000 IU daily several months result calcification bones, irreversible problem. probably take 2000-4000 IU daily, depending body chemical profile, may need 10.000 IU. recently discovered advised amounts calculated properly, discussion still going. Taking 400 IU probably enough. Many studies say 2000 IU daily completely safe, take word research. guy Manitoba taking province court it. breaking laws, probably fine growing couple plants. Assuming use healthy dose discretion.  Ah, bummer. I’m familiar BluePearl area. New Braunfels charm, San Antonio good food. hope y’all get enjoy area soon. Fingers crossed us!  Ok, guy obviously dirt bag.... 1 year 3 probation. know trying make example that's pretty excessive. Really? country accepts immigrants per year than? less child elderly person, people society weak, require protection care, scared cold flu, even dareisay COVID, coward. Pretty much everywhere. We've made illegal indoors, set strict age limits, openly shun shame people it, discriminate tobacco users hiring insurance. numerous campaigns tobacco use. prevent next one? Absolutely.

But man feel like people spend time trying attribute blame actually help people. both, that's fine. replacement actually helping people. It’s literally picture guy I’m talking no?  Checks notes... makes sense lecturing would stop people wouldn’t stupid anymore. Noem 2024 sun hit harder winter? closer earth hitting weird angle making colder still get lot exposure... outside obviously. That's wonderful. Travel one best education one get afford it. diagnosed 2 years ago. tons studies linking MS low Vitamin levels, taking Vitamin helping lot, even saying extreme amounts Vitamin helps remyelination. Either way, take 10,000iU day. inexpensive easy. Strong opinions podcasting comedians, see. daylight lamps use art (color accuracy) helps well, even though don’t SAD. I’ve throwing often lately I’ve stuck home since March, apartment almost natural light. definitely seems help. developed world, people unable work wages paid state. Americas greed ruining lives, lockdown.

Stick head outside bubble every while.

And answer question. many hundreds thousands would take? I’ve read Q1 2021 realistic best bet could less extreme measures like Korea...  Milk body GOOD, pal. Watch commercials. Embrace it. Drink leche. like Magnesium Glycinate try blend “Advanced Magnesium” mix Magnesium Malate &amp; Magnesium Bisglycinate. Relaxing, gentle, doesn’t cause cramping/poop. son’s BMT pharmacist intrigued takes every day herself. Well crap. known paying people fake death.... 

I wonder much faking death worth days? Guy know (36) recently came back Florida vacation - got sick (is hospital) also infected entire extended family \~14ppl. sick 2 hospital. him, people trip states got trip well. vacation. SO's province people smashing cars American plates, point penalize specifically targeting plates. deaths occured early days healthcare system figured best treat patients COVID19 would unfair way count. fair way measure reaction state initial months learned treat sick patients also slow spread. And, funnily enough, New York New Jersey two states hit hardest earliest ones kept curve flattened &amp; moving downward also reopening lot economy. Weird works. fit narrative. aware severity pandemic. sub little doom gloom sometimes trying bring science reasonability table. fair, ruling kind makes sense. I'm much favor taking refugees flee war else. necessarily able choose destination. apply US, example refugees Central Africa passing safer countries like Morocco, Tunisia, Italy, Greece, etc. get UK Sweden.

Falcons got news CB A.J. Terrell's test today; test took Friday morning. Terrell practiced Friday. immediate contact tracing goes effect, per league protocols, Falcons gotten positive test results It’s Covid-19 that’s causing it. It’s lockdowns  Great news! Different person, I’ve never needed myself, actually handful friends who’ve used (or similar lights) helped lot. People choose use tobacco, understand risks. People choose get coronavirus unless go Trump rallies. stories usually rate Daily Mail Right Biased Questionable due numerous failed fact checks poor sourcing information. But... already Imagine spending time commenting Covid19 thinking 7 million people infected. little pay attention what's actually going on? post comment removed must edited source. submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. (More Information)

You even seem trouble following simple rules

Actual title

*A mathematical model reveals influence population heterogeneity herd immunity SARS-CoV-2* Antibodies last 3-4 months. Nearly 9 months pandemic probably longer. maths :) Mostly younger population ill past couple weeks rising hospitalizations *outside* biggest campus areas show fuse lit. 18-24 stable recent testing, everyone else.

Dane County (Madison, University Wisconsin) actually got part outbreak going pile mass quarantine orders. buy neighborhoods already 40-50% already infected. article mentioned neighborhoods Brooklyn. places saw high infection rate first time poor minority neighborhoods Queens Bronx “Johnson Johnson: Family Corporation”  Say - hypothetically - every time opened front door someone dropped dead, would keep opening front door? Hypotheticals fun. qaeda qaeda? showed up, might willing sacrifice grandma send seal team 6. Cases, deaths, hospitalization, pretty flat couple weeks now... governor gonna hold covid party mansion. think he’s saying won’t actually know something like t-cell study honestly think totally stopping peoples' lives two months severely restricting autonomy another four months impact QALYs? Lack exercise, reduced socialization, reduced GDP correlates directly lifespan, delayed/missed cancer diagnoses, child abuse, suicides, drug/alcohol addiction, delayed/missed medical screenings, weaker immune systems sanitization/lack exposure common germs, lost education, data 190 hospitals 23 states, report also found number tests screen cervical, breast colon cancer fell 85% first Covid-19 cases diagnosed US. Delays cancer screenings treatment projected lead 10,000 additional deaths breast colorectal cancer next April August, reports suspected child abuse statewide dropped 28% compared reports months 2019, according data California Department Social Services provided EdSource.  stay inside, go outside. That’s Texas-Sized 10-4, good buddy ask, that's need know you. Get Reddit please expand knowledge. Good luck!! new.sky.com reports it, must true. Fellow Canadians, even don’t private drug coverage may worth getting prescription! doctor recommended one point winter years ago since I’m bad taking daily supplements could larger doses twice month instead according her. super cheap even without coverage, like $10/bottle. daily adult gummies instead, something consider! Right now, country GDP per capita higher $1 day that's desperate enough reopen borders US Covid cases/deaths per capita world. governer makes wish floridian. need D. Obviously George Soros paid fake death. Duh! paid price 

Nope, never pay price behavior ends killing someone. mean non placebo controlled non double blind pilot study op peddling less month ago? God... I’m glad don’t hold power.

Many places world already going back normal. There’s countries already there. 

Students hate online school. Indoor dining thing it’s way months now. You’re fear-mongering, predictions verifiably false. think speed limit be? Mine too! (Speaking floridian age 50 co-morbidities) People say this, yes. straight believe countries faked Covid outbreaks hurt Trump realize many people reasonable preventative measure allows end life, right? million people seemed happy gather testing sites. Many actually designated voting sites, too.

That's 1/5 HK population done voluntary basis. Whereas elections involve much population possible participation skewed towards brave enough take part despite pandemic risks. election's participation skewed certain demographics reasons personal political interest, it'd considered form ""voter suppression"" frowned upon healthy democracies. 

If memory serves, testing also done 2-week+ time frame. extended family took part said able testing environment physical distancing heavily maintained. sure similar situation easily replicable election.

Aside: One concerns 2020 US election Trump's sabotage allow mail-in ballots heavily skewed election towards Republicans voters much less concerned pandemic much likely vote physically booth Democratic whole point alleged delay elections community spread. control, go ahead now?

These shenanigans elections testing quite partisan-driven. anti-government factions instance, vocal mass-testing reason public safety yet okay people taking greater risk vote voting booth. time, government stands gain delayed election voter base tend elderly demographics much hesitant go moment.

I'd also point countries world really got pandemic control able resume normal lives (aside Taiwan New Zealand). Given much criticism HK government received causing 3rd wave laxing safety standards quickly, good reasons encourage large scale public activities. This'd likely inline recommendations public health officials like Dr. Yuen Dr. Zhang still fair degree public respect city. mistaken? Isn’t best way acquire Vitamin naturally, spending time outside sun? irony. happens “over supplementation” ? 

My doctor said he’s never seen overdose vitamin D. prescribes high 100,000 IU per day Movie theaters still aren’t open NJ. started indoor dining two weeks ago it’s 25% capacity. Gyms opened two weeks ago too. live NJ. didn’t fully open beaches Memorial Day. absolutely stayed shut states. guess france spain developing countries now, since cases per capita US Train day joe Rogan podcast night, day! Lockdown?
Serious question. (in US) LOCKED down? 
Okay maybe can't go gym movie theater. ..but Lockdown? ??? Haha made waste time


So trump say go outside get sunlight? Maybe he's far dementia form proper sentences anymore


Use light skin easily miss understood using desk lamp. actually surprise thought light vitamin Thanks. Wtf! That’s bad news Florida people lol Vitamin gummies don’t fail Agreed, cubicle farms awful! Lol social distancing, mask mandates, person indoor activities bans herd immunity, wtf talking ELI 5 IU also give recommendations vitamin d? thanks trump. We're good here. mind us keep boarders closed. doctor progressive puts patients high 100,000 IU he’s said he’s NEVER heard overdose medical career.

And check China Thank you! might save life. still believe lockdowns? thought people would realize lockdowns stop virus. people's behaviour spreads easily governments done enough opened ""too early"". sustainable way let spread lower rate overwhelm healthcare system protect nursery homes. bad can't accept infections deaths despite fact people die sorts things time that's even worse Covid-19. may best post read sub reddit. China's done great job they're saying true. India already 5M cases massive, dense population poorer people. going get hit hard frightening. Canada give shit US politics, Canada want infecting us further. never saw movie, describe reminds something. I’ll DM don’t like putting personal stuff here. I’m not. It’s estimated vast majority excess deaths covid let’s pretend aren’t. data analyzed need links back up. Seems like flawed logic me. Conditions lot different spring. virus already spreading without anyone anything contain it. Northern Italy getting hammered Madrid far behind. lockdowns hospitals major cities would overrun. death rate higher since great treatment plans. Since we've learned whole lot care people people enough keep spread levels medical system handle it. sue company. way changes force put big boy pants on. much one take ug/iu? Google really give good answers. \[edit\] Apparently one microgram Vitamin = 40IU. 
400IU Vitamin = 10ug

So I've taking 150ug wich like uh.. 6000IU? supplements sold out. 150 days does? poor people get opportunity making money also left exploited means.

PS : serious note makes sense case deadly diseases. Blood tests part checkup.

I good insurance fully cover those... morons stopped reasoning others’ experiences Trump wouldn’t voter base. Mh..... information that? actually lot weird allergic reactions stuff, people never heard about. example onions, garlic, paprika, leek. also lots allergic reactions time never figured whats causing them. also get hot skin lots cleaners chemicals cleaning stuff.

If google vitamin pulse blood pressure, find rare posts people issue.

Also people wrote could mean low vitamin level, people get symptoms several reasons, hinting magnesium low level always took magnesium vitamin didnt help. get rest pulse 110 taking 5000 IU vitamin D.  People say “if die die” allowed use hospital resources. They’re huge reason many people hospital, running around spreading shit realize sickness Years ago, job hunting graduating, keen interest working research lab. interesting stuff required PhD pay actually less could make going job areas. feel ya. You’re probably already getting paid adequately top it. 😕 Québec. Someone challenged grow now. know nations avoiding nuclear war...duhhh!. get reasons war...duhhh again. Russian roulette Deagle. call crisis actors. committed. gotten blood test right beginning covid situation learned severely vitamin deficient. Thank god did. I've 50000 units weekly while.  Nothing like sprinkling little Ebonics argument dehumanize people color. You’re real hero know, say lockdown CCP propaganda, even say saying lockdown CCP propaganda actually CCP propaganda.

Not sure one trust now. 

We fucked. trying accurate possible who's already got many people need get get vaccinated slow spread. ~ Arrrdune



How many people need get Covid-19 slow spread many people it.



It's herd immunity ridiculous, since people would get sick die needlessly.



Having safe vaccine vaccinating people option. exist yet, take time roll out. Yep take supplements people live Northern latitudes double body naturally synthesizes less vitamin levels rise. amount sunlight produce levels achieved over-supplementation. moment, Sweden considering COVID-19 restrictions. went full herd immunity, highest death rate world. BWA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA credentials dosage doctor put 8 years worth blood work I’ve done every 3 months since 2012. Want upload you? doctor puts patients dosages high 100,000 per day I’ve emailed asked he’s ever seen vitamin overdose responded with, “No, Never”

Wake fuck maybe read you’re instead taking shots random people online might actually know fuck they’re talking  Well candidates isolation placebo group needed. would look like following tradition without logic right! 123 days since comment still big news anywhere! 1 10 people US food allergies, idea change food safety. Plus, FDA declared review policy pandemic couple years, decide want go back requiring correct labeling. food labels US may become worthless permanently. Prioritizing money lives. Thousands? Maybe two thousand, connected Liberty ""University"". Lets see crowd sky instead close ups praying. real laugh. ctrl F Joe Rogan far, vitamin deficiency non-compliance established rules look biggest indicators success measuring impact various social groups. thanks. Everytime read one 'vitamin good fighting covid' articles always left wondering Vitamin talking Years ago worked overnight shifts noticed significant dip mood. started going tanning salon couple times week things picked back me. Sunlight matters. sure-fire drug/treatment it? No, protocols treatments increase survival recovery rates pretty good amounts, far far better beginning this. recommended doc following orders. already lowered maintain therapeutic levels. Omg. Thanks. Fkn sociopath Damn, I’m sorry family too. born Ogden grew Vegas, there’s lot overlap there. Utah definitely better hospitals. yeah, blessing thing bad. Sorry paid price that, sorry loss.

Oof rodeo. get there’s certain point can’t stay inside forever (I live CA stuck inside since March too, get it.) rodeo? Fuck that. won’t kill anyone wait til next year, it’ll save lives do.

Also damn boss. That’s ridiculous. mom lives Layton, works SLC people live Utah County- luckily got promotion office (and work home two days week) coworkers morons. ones live Utah County. :/ luckily avoid them, mostly, asthma would considered high risk.

People don’t care. You’re right- it’s showing people truly are. despite friendly show people put on, Americans don’t care. spent time Germany, people much quieter aloof there... actually care. It’s show like here.

That said, also think that’s it’s bad Utah. Mormons good putting friendly face without actually meaning it. Doesn’t mean aren’t good ones, seem exception, more. Im descendant major polygamist extended family hardcore mormon. grandma mormon left close family, barely qualifies. I’ve church plenty, even living Vegas friends mormon. It’a perfect idealism something like covid spread.

I also didn’t even think door door- that’s thing live now... remember that. Especially missionaries. still hunt sisters house sometimes, lol. Even mask now, idea ridiculous. Let people keep homes safe, fucks sake!

Thank though! I’m terribly stressed right now, she’s one wonderful kind women is. comment really reminded fucking pissed Utah, honestly Mormon reaction this. hope much grandma okay, even is? many people feeling exactly am... won’t get say same.

Fuck that. people responsible deaths need aware actions, face justice. isn’t okay.

Thank much though. :) really appreciate it. hope stay safe, rest family too! Yes works me. Probably. 

The US really locked though. Maybe areas, sure. pretty open outside large gatherings. us any? Many? field hospitals set up. 

I consider anything US done classified successful, less, terms mitigation Sweden is. yet plague everyone calling May. Parties late March, judge ruled violating emergency stay home orders. party today. It’s possible you’re allergic base oil vitamin diluted with. Grab balls cough 19th century belonged Britain, 20th US. looking like 21st go China (again?) They're literally trying kill people. Covid also excited back. didn’t pray hard enough.

God omniscient already knows want... wants hear beg. 16 total cases 30,000,000 infections. I’ll take odds. Correct

Schools open. study done. Also, fatigue lockdown politicization COVID-19 measures. 

That top fact used ""random dialysis patients"", poor representation general population.

So yes, I'm confident wrong. 

A peer review study said could 85 times cases confirmed, would also put us 10%. Correct, qualified “sometimes” That’s correct, you’re taking 5000/d, really need blood tested see level is. 5000 probably reasonable max dose. That’s really important remember. It’s one thing survive Covid. It’s another whole thing recover fully.

I finished history 1918 epidemic earlier year. Apparently small follow-up oral histories flu survivors done mid 20th century. Many survivors reported took years get strength back, reported never feeling quite well before. cases psychosis. So, knows knock effects virus be. SsssssssssssssssssssxssssssssseeSsssssssssssssssssssxssssssssseers33 ew 33ssssssrrsssssss Preventative bloodwork cover everything. doctor ordered vitamin test, turned covered preventative checkup. ended billed something like $50+ it.

This U.S. I'd like hear countries vitamin blood test covered. Good got trouble, jail really best considering covid either? he’s nonviolent couldnt put house arrest? What's Oxford Vaccine? even passes trials elsewhere world, allowed distributed US trials paused here? disgustingly violent beings ... sent poutine :D Joe Rogan right! Spain higher deaths per capita Sweden despite lockdown Seems like he's trying kill senior population state 9 million though completely agree. Scamdemic Truth spoken :) aren’t targeting elimination. It’s suppression. entire country done months daily cases 20 usually hand full day. sun deadly laser Wisconsin needs close fucking schools rest semester possibly rest year. numbers completely unacceptable. make sure business structured correctly. Many LLCs automatically dissolve death partner cause chaos. Look 7-day moving average. high 10 deaths day back July daily cases around 700/day. 1400 yesterday. Hospitalizations follow case growth deaths follow hospitalizations. It’ll 3-5 weeks deaths increase. forgetting Sweden began herd immunity shit, became country highest death rate world soon after. US current state, would disaster. mean liberals? Alright ladies, heard man. mugshot posted earlier year??? understanding - time people particular gut biome build bacteria bacteria may eat food particles body doesn’t want digest digest 
 excretions etc. 

When introduce new food item sort - initially bacteria sorting out. release extra gas, others get strong outnumber ones initially etc release difference excretions that. 

This especially happens large amounts particular compounds packed multi-vitamins even hits gut empty stomach.

Slowly increasing dosage new compounds need takes days biome adjust something find work better. 

For someone - gut biome sorted already particular food compounds take. Let entertain idea simply ""two side nihilism"". harmful? ***5cream*** Imagine stupid. seen one location population density taken account. America well low average population density high infection rates/death rates. 
I can’t remember last compared infection death rate many countries results were. results? don’t it’s example lol.

If believe it, use example?  I’m gonna argue weirdo internet that’s convinced USA sucks

Then write topic says then? Even so, ""wierdo"" saying that. statistics supports headline rest world view U.S record time low 4 years.

[% favorable view favorable confidence U.S president right thing regarding world affairs] confidence/no confidence leader right things regard world I’m saying MSM blows makes us look stupid af. last 10 years.

I idea mean Shit ain’t bad here.

Depends country compare to. European countries lot better, North Korea worse sure.
But saying ""USA Rocks"" measurements. Maybe ratio gun violence/citizens rate rock sure. “Living dignity means, sweetie. Try living without basic necessities while.”  Ah, yes. Something we've known whole entire time. Stay inside, save lives everyone. vitamin outside anything. thing Trump getting rid mask showing world US' true face.  due respect holiness, frontline workers get first. no. things sent punish Liberals. That's wildfires California plague mostly affects big populated cities people less populated rural get much. mean come on, always hurricanes. That's nothing new. MSM keeps hyping promote liberal ""Climate Change"" hoax. I'm Canadian. Honestly though China really much better US right now? needed make masks mandatory outside.

Show contact tracing shows outdoor spread major risk. issue indoor places recirculate air. soon work-from-home orders lifted, people currently high risk forced back offices, forced assume high levels risk. (Meanwhile, company executives continue whatever want.) eat food? chew everything paste consistency swallow?

My grandmother lost ability swallow pills solid foods, esophageal damage. sucks need meds. many can’t crushed administered safely. Timber Scary stuff. park several years ago, heard teenage girl say friend absolute seriousness, “my parents don’t get it. want make dank memes” knew internet dead. attack genuine rational inquiry, legitimize irrationality. amazing people call sheep blindly following word YouTube videos second cousin facebook work remotely 

I've got bad news WFH status company finds forced let work home anymore. mysterious fuckers? They're bidding time, waiting strike again. power fringe one that.  Except way faster. Rome lasted several hundred years past heyday. happen challenge study garbage. generally accepted outside safer inside. Assuming crowded place. ""Our trophy piece metal"" line. 

And bungling delay start season. used feel sorry. can’t feel sorry someone doesn’t want helped. don’t care. tell kids witnessing fall American empire. watching history unfold. God ? God World likely plus seems fitting.. smart people seen B.S. evil man keeps preaching wait biting nail Election night wish heart attack Take grain salt fifty percent us got saline placebo, friend trial experienced that, yes. also tired feverish day, wasn't. Carrier? might want work grammar spelling lecture people learning marketable skills. US priding sending 10k gloves Thailand.

Those things come boxes 100, cost $10 retail. whopping $1000 (retail price) spent that.

It kind amount used buy worked tattoo shop. long Florida's hospital system handle increase cases, right move. Oh cool too. Except getting covid part. know people gotten friends mom died.  makes say this? Personally don’t care company comes first, long safe effective. one told companies take loans. 

Your point point.  Together rest world. However US decided jump clif rest world looking it. Volunteers fully aware placebo.

Not double blind experiment.

Part point get obvious behavioral differences control test groups. Im dyslexic af lol words hard Huh did? thought said don’t wait mid October takes two weeks vaccine kick flu season started completely different structure.
Compared America population density, community structure, inter city transportation volume.
All means infection rate never really high.
American cities massive supper dense structures mass movement people around country. Also come across America aware catch once. insane country whole freedom thing. cult personality  Get back sea, finned c\*\*\*! checked it’s one lowest, it’s lower every western country compared to. small countries cases lowest rates. don’t it’s example lol. I’m gonna argue weirdo internet that’s convinced USA sucks, I’m saying MSM blows makes us look stupid af. last 10 years. Shit ain’t bad here. please disrespectful memes like like culturally belittle others go different opinions.

Therein lies issue. stupidity. got Pfizer trial one 2 day experience round 1/2. Seeing placebo saline would assume got real deal. sure getting voted. Supplements really help deficiencies outside sun causes body produce vitamin own. Taking much lead alot problems like kidney stones. know much actually getting supplements lack regulation. goto doctor find need.  get it? joke something? countries specifically prohibit paying volunteers, prevent accidentally exploiting poor. Go outside. Maybe piece shit get attacked It’ll never ever accepted know it. 2/3 senate? 3/4 states half controlled Republicans? things way they’ve year people able pay rent, landlords future hard pressed find tenants don’t black mark history point. Especially since looks like it’s going change time soon. may playing odds well come January. Good luck 🍀 great hack good commentary manipulation people social media well.

It’s sinister actually looks like tin foil hat conspiracy I’m originally London, I’m US citizen, American wife, children, spent majority adult life US. friends London used always give shit US, typical stuff fat, passports, bad fashion sense etc....but couple years, that’s stopped. tell they’re genuinely concerned country, pity us. Trump really changed everything. least Hillary elected Sanders. Well, reading scientific reports, known countries Europe, exactly study, reported something like factor 5 10 people tested positive people anti-bodies... back May!

And exactly data, current estimate fatality rate comes from. 

All considered, fatality rate US disturbingly high. Italy, Spain France high total fatality rate, fatalities first wave infections March April. Since May, fatality rates Europe extraordinarily low, even Spain, case numbers soaring high. Meanwhile, US fatality rates barely moved. mention high number excess death, almost developed countries report ***negative*** excess death! Yeah, it’s obvious, regular customer. think brainlets actually vote guy again. wins again, guys screwed. really hope finally get rid him.  Normally would control group exactly reason. may may happen challenge trial. Maybe use animals control instead, infection pathway rhesus monkeys pretty well studied. Yeah I’m sure do, I’m also sure majority parroted article. like here. One place writes story, everyone else comes something super similar later. It’s shit works. 

They parrot article, parrot report happen... example three news stations report similar fashion 3 died car crash. two parroting first one, reporting crash 3 died. That's shit Man it’s bad here. Despite constant pressure it’s worst country ever, poorest people fat lol. got made. privileged, everyone victim mentality feel like everything sucks.

From sideline looks pretty fucking bad compare European countries. measure poor people country are, amount money size waist size? logic?  I've often wondered platform adjusts algorithm show things outside like. way exposed different ideas, there's still chance person roll engage it. 

I suppose crack level addiction current models drive lots profit, perhaps worth FB&amp;co.  Canadian here. I'm long term relationship including children change that. free healthcare private insurance. get flu shots braces... Funny pick things affect 0.00001% population compared things FAR worse many places affect MASSIVE amount population daily basis. wild fires? Really? dont wanna live nature is? Okay lmao. logic Australia shithole yea?

So would rather live somewhere dont clean water drink anywhere even pee take shit private wear shirt youve wearing last month way wash barely get small amount food every day occasionally fight wild animal it? Man, imagine ignorant ACTUALLY think US bad place live. pity you, really do. Yeah post reeks right energy aimed wrong people. hate it’s lauded problem ultra rich white collar workers wtf? still contend Greedo shot first. get lot Democrats called weaponized empathy. want shut entire state 177 people (who already knocking deaths door without covid) I'm bad guy. 

Democrats weaponize empathy many restrictive policies one wants. likely socialize outdoors, indoors. reason EU countries cases fall cliff summer weather good. Rural area....... oh well......karma? Don’t let Reddit get new Zealand accent. you. concern one hundred thousands side effects. seems unrealistic good true. I'm kinda ok that.. feel free see NI contributions deducted wages.

Agree system, though. thought math would always make things better. media making us look retarted countries

I think may fact us can't even spell ""retarded."" feel like six years ago statement would taken hyperbole, yet it’s literally true. divinity, need logic science critical thinking. feel free see NI contributions deducted wages.

Agree system, though. see ""Pee pants"" analogy? what? 7 people hospital it. looking forward free - proud Victorian here. 


Hopefully long. explain never get sick, disgusting hygiene habits. Always knew would pay It’s good sign sold stocks!! Check r/wallstreetbets learn stocks work.. never big right now. It’s impossible company ever win larger work freaking pandemic vaccine. wanna know headline says ""twenty-something"" know he's 29. could never strategy. could goal strategy, never strategy itself. strategy series actions, result said actions.

It's strange Scandinavian generals keep responding criticism ""let's maintain low infection rate"" approach phrase, seeing fact nonsensical, agree? Look Typhoid Mary. legally put away looooong time sake public health.

I know state, state laws ability enforce health orders really, really clear. law Constitution. Laws outside Constitution still laws. ability declare binding emergency/health orders written law including ability enforce loooong precedence courts. even looked applicable laws are? wish governor money-hungry idiot. would believe many people buy Trump propaganda hook-line-and-sinker. truly wish could get family Canada right now. Oh wow! good luck Floridians.... 

I miss Kissimmee... Anti-maskers getting violent. Attacking police.


I hope move nextdoor. last time locked down? last time told can't leave house without permission would arrested /or fined? last time go checkpoint show papers? reality never real lock time snowbirds

Probably sole reason lift restrictions.

I live town literally runs profits alcohol, brewing/wineries countless bars. new bar open St Patrick's Day YEAR. day County decided obey quarantine, they're FINE.

We 6 bars Main Street, night club, new brewery. city seen couple popular videos drunks dumbass shit internet.

The police turn blind eye goings town bars restaurants open right now, know alcohol sales tourist town's consistent source income. nobody surprised point take much convince me... already are. favorite I've heard BLM real racists racist white people. one correct one? 800 5000+? Eh don’t think we’ll opening Atlantic bubble anytime soon lol  Unless firmly believe COVID hoax need adjust data fit conclusion. might explain Seattle one first places get outbreak. people problem well, tbh. Almost nobody wants use eRouska (monitoring based Bluetooth phones), useless. Even though could help lot. shit major vitamin deficiency mean “herd mentality” right? 😂 That’s correct, United States journalists travel countries. 🤦🏼‍♂️ mean, maybe.

If cheap makes feel better harm foul.

He’s literally giving stupid people chance kill Florida smarter lmao almost 2 million people receiving unemployment, knows many unemployed don’t safety net ... there’s disposable income spend reopened businesses. Locals don’t drive tourism business, we’re renting hotel rooms, clean them. think Disney good barometer - open disinfected doesn’t mean they’ll come I’m extremely worried coronavirus Second Wave could far devastating first. look Spanish Flu death rate graph, enormous spike fatalities end September 1918 beginning January 1919. US majority deaths happened 30 day period October part November.

Since pandemic begun, experts field said alarming things us like “second wave” “the worst yet come.” I’m really worried saw March, *fear* could come back big way. death rates spike hospitals across nation farmlands big cities get completely maxed out, would worst disaster. scariest part Spanish Flu relatively unremarkable outside 30-60 day period. numbers would people probably saying stuff now. one suddenly unexpected bad 30 day period became really bad. showing attack science fake scientists.

I'm man reason man adult human male. nothing unscientific stereotypes history society beliefs, I'm male sex (male) + age (adult) = man.

The way change change DNA &amp; genetics unfortunately currently possible. able change DNA female, would woman sex (Female) + age (Adult) = woman. Maybe nationally, happen certain areas, already is. Stop playing rules replace then. I’m sure that. It’s already going US. city Boulder recently placed lockdown people aged 18-22. almost like people ailments hospital capacity fucked people thought everyone concerned Covid stay home go normal life.

That's illegal planets. Seems fishing answer honestly im opposed knowingly put people risk. assholes usual test, also often called 25(OH)D terms 7orly7 used.

It's one regular tests done lab, doctor definitely part regular blood test. works detail healthcare system though ask people country.

This problem fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin D. don’t urinate excess vitamin like would vitamin C. People, start regimen, PLEASE consult doctor reasonable dose! High concentration forced oxygen, anti coagulants, steroids, high-dose vitamin D/C, using ventilators except absolutely necessary. 

All things contribute significantly positive outcomes. There’s also remdesivir although hasn’t really shown effective. sustainable way let spread lower rate overwhelm healthcare system protect nursery homes

1. nursery homes hilarious typo
2. literally described 'lockdowns' happened world I'm constantly saying that! I've never wanted wrong bad! Lol! kidding?! Ha! Well, I’m super happy figured get trains back schedule! ruin anyone’s day/week/life. Australians spend 60 billion overseas travel, international tourists spend 45 billion Australia.

Probably quiet there's vaccine news plan around Joe Rogan right along huh? know super pale woman natural flaming red hair vitamin deficiency bad one point get bed. also given 50K IUs/week target, think supplements rather shot. would've mind-blown find somebody needed way that! care? Al anti-maskers know claimed quit following NFL players thinking America exercising right protest. would guess latter. considered dangerous general public going less demand outcry testing. Also increased number people waiting without getting treatment shrugging minor asymptomatic cases. I've read. deaths 120-200 per day DeSantis's pretty much elimination mitigation measures, compared NY's strict, science based approach deaths single digits, take long FL catch up.

Plus, there's 8900 excess deaths Florida March-June, many accusations data manipulated Desantis put hand reporting massage data. NY included probable deaths total well.

But yes, doctors learn better treatment protocols time goes on.

Maybe able understand statistics acceptable/inevitable collateral damage: they're actual people. I'm pretty sure heard argument years back taking 10k IU read much long term supplement use maximum levels cause issues like hypercalcaemia. one thinks election. announcement vaccine approved, even available much later, would validate Trumps operation warp speed that’s agenda there. Trump’s polls weak really handling pandemic want bump get since could easily lose behind it. 

The idea they’ll push vaccine election ridiculous impossible, it’s conspiracy theory that’s really popular here. want able credibly say Trump’s strategy worked set date vaccine rollout regardless it’s true not. honest, heard porn stars getting it, you?

Again, thousands doctors nurses added ranks states medical professionals still full ICU’s huge swaths state snd that’s easily verifiable.

No need put head sand, whole state playing dangerous shell game weeks there.

You’re probably wanting see bodies lining hallways, that’s works hospital hits capacity. It’s medical errors overworked doctors nurses, it’s many patients even put someone prone position, it’s forcing heathcare workers titrate O2 manifolds can’t handle demand many patients needing high flow O2, it’s sending patients hundreds miles away effort spread load.

All boosts death rate, isn’t quite dramatic citizens need realize threat.

Absolutely better shape now, thought pretty good shape last time changed phases early too, ICU’s filled still seeing high death burden result actions.

And yes, brining thousands extra doctors nurses, infact well capacity. part, yes. There's occasional subreddit fosters actual debate, usually gets commandeered one side while.  It’s best know anyway since could escalate world war China.

Yeah, right. Let's ask world leaders stick heads sand seek accountability, China continues churn various biological humanity-threatening pandemic events. 

Whether intentional not, refuse learn origins, can't complain history repeats itself, again, even.

I say social media platforms forced law add feature. :) agree you. everyone taken quarantining safety measures seriously start continued safety precautions can’t help think country would much different place. 

And can’t help think 200,000 people longer us. many deaths could prevented? many infected individuals still suffering effects disease didn’t get sick selfish, self-centered people? It’s disgrace sad reflection country.

I hope you’re able get back work soon! IMO don’t one, it’s definitely beneficial complexity whatever reason situation. wouldn’t eligible

It sucks careful long one mistake ruin all. people afford houses new cars new cell phones new big screen TV new PS5, etc etc etc. 

No dude, people can't. 75 years ago defended geopolitical interests set hegemonic world order service interests.

50 years ago participated nuclear arms race developed rockets capable striking target earth. 

6 months ago suffered consequences 50 years civic intellectual complacency. you’re really desperate pop here, I’ll put kettle 🇬🇧 Lebron, you? Look posts. gf pregnant second child, 22 wants love pawn kids kids live grandparents. Everywhere posts gets downvoted. doesn’t even empathy cares kids. legally November last year. 

Moved expecting get work permit degree December. 

Had figure new plan quickly lol. drive? accepting deaths personal comfort. smart phone? accepting deaths personal comfort. Saying life precious protected cost dumb platitude one actually truly believes. Point #5: Holy freaking shit. man, IDEA thing fiance wanted tubes tied would *solve host health issues*. hell anybody's business hers??? disenfranchised American experiment prior revelation. downright disgusted now.

TLDR: ""land free"" , women aren't. None us really, wtf?!?! Tell it.
Im American im watching Trump kill 200k people want shut precious economy.
Im honestly glad rest world notices, wish country like Germany France comes saves us stupidity. People born stupid way describing. huge social, economic, cultural forces work turn kind person. really fix system need systemic change - trying convince individuals see light. Yeah get that, pal. user said people coming taking seriously disrupting education process helping it.

I really promise everything going abroad isn’t difficult might imagine. things Americans tend overlook legal/admin requirements. said before, four year degree base. arts degree SE Asian university meets requirements. STEM degrees graduate degrees often able gain employment high paying private schools. 

I would encourage consider Europe. reason stick Asia transgender. Spain particular known affordable, think Florida prices. Spanish teacher couple went lockdowns us several months could got flight home. received full pay entire time.

I’m sure competitive field is, give USAjobs.gov search might find something doesn’t require leave career.  ... yes, people can.. mentioned what's going countries immediate response ""I care goes third world countries."" guess see everyplace US.. starts whole election system created litterly devide people 2 camps. wierd. Like nothing democrats Republicans. already representative government FHM: Johan Carlson. appointed government others like Tegnell civil servants. Canadian here, sadly true. im not, i'm angrily replying moronic rhetoric. Yes mental health crisis, yes half pathetic ""i cant go outside see friends"" people otherwise wouldnt anyway, using fight covid regulations. yeah, im angry mental health bullshit. cluster b cluster c major depression, life. Still doesnt mean science isnt real suddenly ignore guidelines wah-wah. guy born poverty, shitty country, america always looked big great, life goal live day, look shit happening there, realize anyplace would better US lot people dying India lockdowns. seen news. Media kinda skipped 100 million migrant workers shut cities forced walk 100s 1000s miles home (or ""somewhere"") food supplies, water shelter. 

Some publications covered disaster March &amp; April (including riots widespread physical abuse willing comply knowing likely meant death / starvation), became politically untenable report trying convince worldwide public policies ""just"".

Now reporting turned reporting Covid deaths, Covid deaths help continue support lockdown measures. Interesting works. Unless vaccine 100% success rate must continue lock down. Even vaccine 99.9% successful still thousands upon thousands deaths worldwide. lockdowns stop even single person losing second life worth it. Whether safe depends much details occasion answer reddit post. Mind also logistics field training, avoid crowed situations then.  much pro choice. Part believing real choice women - want lower rates abortion best options allow access birth control education, provide support raising children result poverty etc., provide support women leave violent coercive relationships. feel sorry us. Feel sorry people think COVID thing. u feel sorry described reddit lmao huge amount people can't basic mathematics understand basic scientific principles... Often people treat opinion equal to, greater than, fact. man, 43 percent world running water. think we're ok even like president. since called kid ugly, moving baby momma don’t want live two kids admit liking 70 think opinion going matter, anyone value opinion think empathy? Bro, comments posts say terrible trump. Pick side fucking troll. USA perfect sure fuck nice worry bombs going sleeping.

You worry police shooting sleeping though, good trade-off.  half guys would find downside it.

I mean, Jesus create disease first place? praise. Biden moments lucidity, he's doddering old man, generally speaking. speak coherently entire hour incredible. 

Isn't weird guy lucky break top 5 ended nomination despite nothing rise ranks continuing draw breath? love see it, folks long leave American culture behind mean, feel like impacted pretty little. life going pretty well, still live US, desperately desired immigrant location history world.

I guess get emotional weight Twitter, last years really sucked? otherwise, times pretty fucking awesome. New tech awesome, people cool, things alright.

Just wear mask keep working hard. okay. coronavirus situation worse Spain France? US like 1000+ coronavirus deaths per day whereas Spain France around 100. Even adjust population death rate much higher US.
The situation might change coming weeks though. gatekeeping mental health issues. Truly incredible. covid too, lie whole body aches.

Weird came want end conversation basically telling thousands going mental health crisis due isolation, losing jobs etc problems real like yours. stupid, selfish, jerk, congratulations. pretty honestly feel though everyone made comments like Reddit qualify sort refugee program would greatly improve productivity also morale. people build useful shit raise happy families super patriotic, least ones know. would need re-staff Target get rid creative writing PhD courses though, think could handle it. Yeah, learned learning European history. It’s odd word, novelty makes memorable.

So opportunity use it, will. Well, fucked Bernie over... twice perhaps would hope think bit delusional works, *everyone* page. Otherwise, we're playing big game Whack-A-Mole.

Blame lack unified response. mean point dies open bottle champagne wish comedians late night show hosts US felt way. 4 years tired overplayed Trump jokes  Next time AlTeRnAtE CaPs twenty GOP candidates stage Red Americans went reality tv star represented best interests.

To fair, 20 candidates split 'mainstream' significantly, contributed heavily winning.

Most early primary contests results would like 29% reality star, 22% Zodiac Killer, 11% Rubio, 7% Kasich, etc., line many like 1%. primaries work via whoever win's state gets half delegates whoever wins district gets delegates district... would win state (because likewise first past post) less third vote (IE: 2/3+ voting 'mainstream') walk away almost delegates since would similarly win districts less third vote well.

And happened many early races... time everyone dropped out, commanding delegate lead, way pass delegate threshold would later races landslides him, happen. later races go largely momentum media. securing many delegates early races, media basically reported bag, mathematically impossible lose, etc. (Just like cycle side)... type reporting lowers turnout opposition candidates later primaries... CNN tells guy already it, waste time even going primary guy kind deal... So, pretty much exactly Pope said. call ""build risk"" industry really common even normal times. COVID, cost building massive redundancy nothing compared daily impact lockdowns. smart move, even goes directly trash bin. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh no! difficult change! better try research little bit deeper mainstream ""China bad"" narrative tends make labelled ""tankie"" people reason.

Incidentally, people never able rationally argument discussion even presence scientific evidences. Go figure! Supposedly? New Zealand already live events since Covid round one. Fully attended sports matches least, one literally last night capital city. Also pop culture convention two couple months back, bunch shit can't fucked remembering. Small gigs happened continue happen. big concerts planned much lead time ended delayed second outbreak hit biggest city (where held) outbreak appears contained I'd say they'll live concerts Christmas, moment one city restrictions expected end 10 days (24 days they've missed clusters). Australian states pretty good too, they'll Covid free live shows long US does. Italian too. Even consider that, day school reopening, already counting 8k cases average. see graphic (Spain case), actually school reopening game changer curve. raising lot school reopening (with high positivity rates) schools added gas fire, but, speak, spark started it. 12 days school reopenings Italy curve substantially same.

I saying change, again, nobody knows. situations extremely different beginning development. Round 2: *fight!* agree principle, think companies big powerful. 

If McDonalds invented teleporting fast food food appears house, business would dwarf overnight. 1 10 burgers caused severe sickness, causing people pass randomly day eat one? matter us private business, would unacceptable service society clearly crosses line. food safety standards cost businesses money time implement. believe Facebook crossed similar line. common sense food safety time start thinking similarly psychological safety social network. words carry living lives then!&lt; Yeah, many people think masks infringe ""muh rights!""

So many people dislike science cause makes feel small. Sucks many people needlessly die result. People spreading dying CV going magically cause *less* disruption. ""open up"" terrorists short-sighted morons.

There's good choice. best bad ones. clearly, accepting science cracking people care spreading priority 1 world. reason vaccines take long there's reluctance fund since inherently profitable. 18 months two years reasonable they're main priority fully funded start. Also, SARS vaccines almost ready go basically disappeared, like totally unprecedented. Also, least bit unethical society require healthy practices members society individual wants something damages health society. People willing make health community priority deserve live society.

It's also binary death-not death choice. They're finding large portion even asymptomatic people end neurological, cardiac, and/or kidney, damage may last forever. moral society try prevent kind damage much try prevent death, quit carping death rates. They're whole story never been.

Also, personal finance advisors recommend individuals emergency fund : first big enough maybe one event gradually building 3 months expenses, 6 months, years worth, 2 years worth expenses, businesses emergency expenses. poor often enough get even they're ones gov't focused helping. anyone that's poverty robust emergency fund carry fiscally responsible fault go bankrupt.

There solutions sociizing educating children without crammed memorization factories. think people managed past modern tools make easier past? pessimistic life look like 2018.

Mitigation mental health problems high priority state, opening everything cheap out. focusing helping people learning better coping mechanisms.

This opportunity state reorganize priorities help people need emerge healthier much stronger society opening economy pandering short term business interests quick cheap ""fix"". like giving candy starving child. makes giver feel better solves nothing long run. “Covids! Mutate troll out!” Yeah sub pretty sobering. decent exit plan would least year making anyway election weeks problem there. 

Being kind old start young decide life’s pretty much winding anyway (and rich enough retire) tough spot moment. I’ve heard exact thing too. Fox News thing? one asked family. 😳 answer person questions considered ""hostile"" US.

I answer you, asked question know better answer law school said people intelligent enough answer questions trying avoid them

I avoid it, digged deeper know wanted effective ""hostile"" tells lot person.

OK, still understand said Oh, actually looked numbers realized thats could say.

Yes actually looked numbers, that's Look, always like tell people, check use knowledge widely available. 

As said, check trust pretty face confident demeanor.

Have even stated something yet? chance dying covid different everyone, many people, getting spreading vulnerable loved one would bad dying. damage getting could cause can’t really quantified. time many damn people Florida. 

Problem solved. Another trump turd post infections United States trending upwards average number cases last seven days 10% prior week, according Reuters analysis. average, nation reporting 44,000 new cases day 700 deaths. r/murderedbywords Central America fucked since Cortez burned boats. 1980s issue. know America stands anymore. They've pretty much burned every bridge comes democracy, free speech, equal rights, freedom press... They're different path now. could take snapshot today go back time, lot Americans would terrified beast they've created. Oh US useless testing then, still today also.

You seeing positivity rates 1% testing enough. don't. Trump turd post  think schooling. schools, media, movies perpetuate idea America amazing, great, perfect. could possibly go wrong there?
It's xenophobia, institutions built upon racism, hate immigrants. 
You can't fix society like schooling. need way that. Honestly, love capitalism money human life. America really long time. Rather dying, friendo Seems like good news, it’s really not. Elimination terrible strategy. happens they’re 0 cases (supposedly) open back up, new cluster pop week later? Back lockdown go, everyone. way measure much Vitamin body without needing go doctor lab work? Thank you!! Napoleon's definitely empire (at least ignorant definition) right, lasted less America's empire period (~100 years I'm generous). 

I appreciate comment thank educating me!! Trump turd post proclaim center world though.. see anything bad, last two posts could make interesting discussion. since seem think anyone disagrees like kill black people Since category coronavirus politics need super careful ""play nice"" mod bots dont delete posts. unfortunately coronavirus become political issue. government actually job, would science issue.  causes heart rhythm side-effects deadly, drug’s side-effects known prevalent women, said study author Dr Sabine Oertelt-Prigione, chair sex gender-sensitive medicine Radboud University Netherlands. don’t provide sex-disaggregated analysis drug like this, said, “what happens potential new Wullum Nielsen, University Copenhagen author latest analysis, said: “I think study … suggests deeply ingrained norms difficult change.” kidding right? people act believe eternal damnation know bullshit. sub US hate sub now? would think so.

Tourism also contributed 8.0% Australia's total export earnings  ""101 ways politicise vaccines."" Wired. would really like thoughtfully respond post you’ve got lot misconceptions laid far debt equity function financing. Id suggest looking maybe YouTube video “debt vs equity financing”. short equity shareholders say use system keep wealth actually consistently taking substantially risk debt investors, debt investments days require debt secured sort existing asset whether businesses real estate owners cash hand. “Shareholders” often take higher risks exchange higher returns, want keep actual piece business potentially help grow it. usually provide cash front help grow ect, keep % income forever. don’t follow conclude wealth kept one tier population based upon pure financing concepts I’m describing. business fails, shareholders often lose everything banks collect whatever collateralized assets contract. think you’re putting general hatred wealth amassed really understanding I’m saying position (educator, R D, I’m teaching). There’s lot I’m covering well, people major finance, it’s small business topic lol make conclusions based upon little bit I’m covering shareholders vs debtors (how gain lose money debt vs equity deals), perhaps YouTube questions get additional detail. short is, easy shareholder business make money never lose everyone ever would it....and unfortunately business many lose asses(t)s saved roughly 3 Million people cost 30% GDP Europe.

1. need military successfully steal election.

2. ""majority military"" fucking means ALL. CinC. Fewer enlisted people, vote, might vote last time, succeeds stealing election way allows say actions constitutional, absolutely will, they'll support 100%.

There going military coup. Texas 23900 excess deaths Sept. 12th. +1300 since.  took Orwellian imposed lockdown nightmare get there! Well early tell good luck economic systems. It’s like you’re close actually understanding concept critical thinking skills hoped outta like 1:1 Harvey Weinstein.

The dude gets called racist that’s is. also publically downplayed pandemic saying internal killer. Last year it’s 166. use “only” front that? Hopefully Covid restrictions even fewer kinds get flu year. letting women vote. changed.  selected state cooler climate. Like San Francisco always winter. That’s interesting! Considering Finland seen best educational system world. Joke's rest world. I’m definitely looking that. looks like one maternal line, goes way back 1600s Sweden - thanks baptism records! confederacy never left land. guess define empire powerful government goes outside legal territory stakes more. military presence lands outside own, wars peace Italian here, tbh schools opened 14th Italy, least 10 days France Spain...

We already study waste water University Barcelona, claims traces COVID-19 found March SARS-CoV-2 detected Barcelona sewage long declaration first COVID-19 case, indicating infection present population first imported case reported.

Similar studies Italy Brazil found traces wastewater earlier expected (Q4 2019).

Also, strain majorly found US (NY) related European one, apart first early cases Washington California linked China. However, genomic lineage Lombardy reveals early Italian infections largely *unrelated* Chinese outbreak lineages contain viral strains isolated first months outbreak China (black branches, dots); let us hypothesize transmission chain directly involving China (i.e., country pandemic originated). Notably, closely related viral isolate clustered outside Lineages isolated Central Europe, second half January.

Looking current [genomic seems European strain descent Chinese strain, seem like *cousins* instead.

Lastly, Western media love lash China refuses investigation, truth categorically refuse international pressure led US-centric position - understandably, since US actual game point finger (election period, inability take responsibility domestic failure). winning scenario China one-sided review, they're defensive:

* China agree investigation, US say China hiding something therefore must responsible.
* China agrees investigation nothing found, US say China destroyed evidence.

If make sense you, maybe look recent UN speech Trump. speech virus Trump, really.

To noted, initial opposition, China support investigation coronavirus origins, US refuses numerous attacks (claim puppet organization, finger pointing responsibility shifting, formal declaration leaving WHO, etc.). standstill.

Just something, mean should. I'm glad whole separation church state still founding principle US. /s There’s definitely difference, would define social media? Still though, agree lot political echo chamber-ness going I'm astonished people wear Trump hats, shirts, flags cars, everywhere go.

Wearing political merchandise everywhere looks absolutely absurd. look insecure. Yeah well US backed totalitarian dictatorships great they? publish story like this?

Serious question, I'm impression quite normal article particular sub echo chamber since late March.  tf writes articles lol reason established universal education expectation individuals would even could learn things like logic critial thinking terms long colourful history totally disproven. noted many people critical thinking skills, orders magnitude ever before. 

However, Internet set way erodes basis skills. order think critically, amount information dealing rather narrow. much information critical thinking skills mean fuck cognitive capacity integrate anything else process. 

Quite simply, Internet set allow much information flow node-to-node possible, includes human end-point nodes well. Nodes slaves flow data, way round, different form node. computers servers, almost linearly expand capacity nodes order keep flow data expands. can't people. information moves system, greater burden placed endpoints - people - absorb operationalise information without way meaningfully expand processing capacity. can't network together efficiently like computers. naturally resort dropping important processes would otherwise sort bad information good information, make ever flawed assumptions nature information, simply keep data. entirely natural evolved heuristic, fail safe designed allow us hone senses relevant information discarding confounding irrelevant information. natural setting, emergency, ain't bad thing discrimination happens low level, e.g., ""a thing went bang, focus listening bangs"". happens thing went... something, know what? happens thing goes something again, again, again? several things something time, thing different things? 

Cognitive overload dangerous thing. Internet built way constantly triggering state cognitive overload. We've got point overloaded near permanent norm. normal circumstances we'd know we'd reached maximum capacity abnormal changes behaviour psychology would obvious us. Now, don't. live constant state incognizant overload, Internet blame. incredible speaking tongues even thing. person literally making shit spot. Lol awareness simple majority may voted best him, voted didn’t, need 75% territory reasonably claim ’most’. Read article. quotes people many different countries including third-worlds developing nations. they're fully self aware; they're speaking position pride country superior US anything. 

They're looking America Trump handling pandemic. accounts, America abysmally bad - first world country, US excuse badly. bring excessive American pride discussion, man. dismissing valid concerns they're coming somewhere lower GDPs. Given eradication possible, talking never dropping restrictions. realise crazy sound's.  would make interesting person... anything significantly sooner date would take caution. Look CDC says directly White House interpretation CDC message currently. Yeah, we’re watching. Trump gets again, that’s you. It’ll another generation come back adults table. know it’s percentage really, smart half able sort out. words Ricky Gervais: every nation, ethnicity group people right made fun of. sometimes there‘s way around punching down. else could make fun disabled children?

The introduction joke live show like: next segment probably won‘t make to
the netflix-cut. They’re taking line. tools need social without physical distance.

If case lockdowns social distancing would cause deterioration mental health countries seeing think would ever get bad American refugees would probably best refugees. 

Open social people, loots bootstraps mentality speaking language world understand. Like said, flipped little earlier (my last Republican vote kasich primary) yeah... ugh Okay. real make up? can't believe sound like kind person would nominate Supreme Court. can't even believe organization like exists. thought Catholic, mainstream Catholic like several others Supreme Court. people dead year compared previous years. deaths line exactly coronavirus hit country. still believe ""they would died anyways"" line obviously educated issues living bubble ignorance.

Geico cavemen problems using modern technology. I'm far expert field, thoughts. 

Typically US, current president gets elected often not. Someone people ""comfortable"". 

The side internet, especially reddit, huge echo chamber. People hate current president, you, like him, get downvoted. means less visibility types posts, people make less likely voice opinion future. **But mean exist.** means people stay quiet discuss opinions echo chambers. 

So see internet, especially reddit, mean people exist. different echo chamber somewhere else. People like surrounded like-minded people challenge beliefs. human nature.

But, case difficult judge outside world's opinions inside, let tell you, they've really gone shit. America appears broken right now, ready self-implode, look awe scale damage caused poor/lack leadership.

The US, China, Russia kind blended one point. Need tone big balls content.  200k dead people loved ones would disagree. one dozen friends states seen anything bad this. wear mask thats sign pandemic lol. poor poor people tho  well substantiated. recovered Covid-19, generated immune response direct cause making virus clear out. vaccine help all, also current strategy- give enough people immunity cases fall. 4 Marvel movies set release, there's tough competition. Oregon great locking getting close election. Exploded cases adding presumptive cases totals &amp; opening exposure. Perfect timing. You’re guy argues think freedoms violated forced wear mask. 

Start arguing shirts shoes first first. hate wearing shoes shirts grocery store always hated it. obviously don’t job since you’re unessential, work something. Let know dont wear shirt you’re done you’re allowed protest masks. chop chop, get working.

Try enough pay taxes scum feel sorry us too. example believe trump win November. 

A guy basically switching side still tell piece shit.  known case fatality rate moving 1% puts actual fatality rate far lower. Along better treatment, even everyone got infected right now, certain one million would die. Reason 1: jealousy, reason 2: virtue signaling, reason 3: low IQ 
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  I’ve wondering fire crews’ precautions. previous years, firefighters would deployed country, flying commercial, 2-week intervals. many fires, access running water limited folks living close quarters.

Anything domestic contained within borders, **there actually much international travel going on**. test every single arrival quarantine 14 days begin with. Every airline allowed one flight per int'l route per week typo. Think saw news headline days ago said rules relaxed slightly, followed up. Also iirc foreigners banned entering China days ago. There's simply credible int'l traveller transmission vector arrivals measures.

And epidemics special case China's ""things fine"" surveillance system. futile counterproductive censor can't, censorship basically guaranteed make things worse. case wonder, also learned hard way SARS 2003. Mate... countries aren’t even testing humans properly, think time testing frozen stuff?  US other, potentially safer vaccine candidates. Can’t really blame pumping breaks considering happened. fall category two then. Hey question.

Here's quick test:

Are millions Americans dead yet?

&amp;#x200B;

No?

Then we're yet. really like thread went Legit trying figure out. wasn’t point. Simply put it’s stereotype academic institutions make people write papers Ancient Rome. Definitely college, rarely high schools. could possibly know that? lack personal responsibility too. education Mexico imagine better US, still aware enough use internet learn world. excuse. flux capicitor!!!! Case fatality ratio state 2%. Belgium’s 15% last time checked

I feel sorry foe Belgians  I'm getting anti-maskers dick nosed grocery store work at. I'm grateful job damn make hard go everyday. obama classic neoliberal president. fuck working class. Thanks want leave nobody wants us. idea downvoted. point virus run spreaders. vaccine dramatically accelerate process slash amount deaths/poor long term outcomes would take happen ""naturally"". believe vaccine end mitigate pandemic normal life resume, believe herd immunity useful concept. Papa Johns version America Hoard Opening hospitals get overrun. medical professionals Florida put it? Ah no. stop consistent run propagandist lies spewing CCP. 

I'm sure nation billion people, many people overlooked testing. 

Let alone addition Bird Swine flu midst COVID pandemic. Absolute joke. agree, like horse blinders right cliff.

Sometimes wonder generations feel way. anyways *something* horizon, scary threat wipe us out? Problem internet without learning logic mega strict policies. It’s tough hell aren’t highly educated wealthy. Fauci himself, vaccine worked on. Estimated date roughly December 2021.  know live. That’s feels tbh. cares happens cash long role keep getting paid.

If loaned money friend pay rent, goes buys new X-Box, I'm gonna get sneaking suspicion lied me. given loan, known X-Box money.

These companies clearly need loan keep employees. took anyway, drawing limited pool resources intended help people. would like Mitt Romney going getting stuff local Food Pantry. think model pretty good measure. explains basically metrics uses compare measurable quantities observe (serology, total tests, fraction positive tests, etc).  


It's clear beginning number positive tests nowhere near number total cases, typically factor 3-4 (and closer factor ten first months epidemic). expected, especially true given somewhere range 30-50% cases asymptomatic.  


Honestly, curious go Youyang Gu's model. measures country state real time interested (R\_t, total infected, daily infected, total dead, expected daily deaths), best performing epidemiology models. honestly far easier trying glean information calculations raw data. Yeah, duh. privacy HIPAA rationale school districts using. 

Something pearl clutchers would know spent half second reading attending school district meeting. thing happened nursing homes back march opened receiving guidance. Canadian here. Girlfriend animal husbandry/welfare. Underpaid. Underappreciated. plenty younger people fill ask anything. 

Unfortunately tough position everywhere. Wait, butt stuff one girl looks like could playboy playmate month? funny people think they're righteous. Like...when Jesus comes back, blasphemers first fall. always seem omit Jesus love. Love neighbor love yourself. God judge...etc.. Didn’t company like... help cause opiate epidemic? people US ancestors immigrated here.  quite welcome go back came like here.  Maybe hateful ignorant people left country would salvageable. Oh look, username accurately describes owner. Really fucked democracy begin with, elect government plurality supreme court justices life. wish. wife’s best friend Canadian live side damn continent practically. 

I wish. chosen one all. problem religion. Trump actually perfect metaphor country’s flaws, without redeeming virtues. He’s one dimensional villain would rejected unrealistic movie. 

Seriously struggle name one positive thing him. Even something normal wholesome fatherly love towards daughter creepy weird him. 24/7 news cycle. dont even journalists on. pay people come give opnion pieces. spread devisiveness. can't tell what's right choice you. here's would opportunity: immigrate either Germany Norway.

But I'm single dependents. worry things like ""how kids going handle integration whole new country, leaving friends extended family behind, taking new national identity, etc""

Still, struggling things sounds easier struggling lack universal healthcare, lack decent education system or, y'know, national government plain give fuck half citizens die fully preventable illness. 

Just take, mileage may vary. Oh nooooo, please don'ttttt. able survive without youuuuu. coworker believes trump moved US embassy Jerusalem 🤷‍♂️. He’s great guy, gullible stubborn comes money politics. Come on. (It’s always NZ passport.) Lol please get fuck go China Let fucking burn let's build something oppressive empire ashes DNC fucked big time 2016, 4 months faith left institutions Dunno, Confederacy lasted 5 years... someone screaming ninety minutes. worried would allow dry butt stuff. I'm sure worse.  I’m boat. Two kids Mississippi. screwed. read article, I'm pretty sure 199,999 people got COVID one person got it. Nuclear holocaust, probably. He'd need reason abolish term limits 2024 Seriously. odds I'm interested not... Amount matters

Like need people think like you... way ever change minds science facts, asking people ""self isolate"" throwing bus. Even give up, many people won't. normal everyone says normal. Better get used it. someone mild symptoms please describe cough? small cough every minutes feeling something stuck throat? chronic cough? currently gives IFR five ten times higher influenza. Right would roll red carpet, long corpses libtards. would act like first world country drop nukes Japan go steal Iran's oil (if read French) 

With help friend Google Translate can. 

But anecdotally see videos France many people wear masks streets. Whereas New York City - least Manhattan - vast majority wears them. Democracy relies good faith people representatives. illusions. Fuckin fascists. Thank sharing. Hang there, things get better. wish husband peace love every day gets better you. Yeah technically. mean less? Causa that's blacks have, less vit. would actually apply anyone immediate physical danger? Well, could've dropped demonstration bomb designers intended. Or, know, attacked military targets country brink. ye fkin weird, think jus cos people can't stand alone thoughts. like spending entire life constantly afraid dying, madness. world make sense? Vote better time, even it’s 16 million Americans fought, 400,000 Americans killed, 670,000 Americans wounded helping world fight fascists ships, planes, tents ditches around world WWII 75 years ago.

Mentioning without whole nuclear bomb 400,000 civilians part wholly disingenuous borderline propaganda.  Silent majority 🙄. Y'all lost last election 3 million votes. minority, majority. Get fact winning based archaic systems 18th century trying play like reasonable 21st. Hell embrace minority gets fuck everyone else. Whatever helps sleep night. think it.
Imagine pro-military treat vets saints covid hit everyone like ""bye grandpa. fault old fart"" They're actually considerably underestimated. know excess mortality country. full accounting over, I'm quite confident we'll find cases deaths significantly underestimated. saw Hey Arnold episode yesterday Helga selling newspapers bogus articles 5¢ kid bought one said, ""I paid 5¢, true"". great’ simply enough

That's got hit right daddy issues Trump 4chan Reddit considered social media that's ideas originated weaponized Facebook Twitter. Get know neighbors, they're probably boat. Team let become homeless! can't handle entire neighborhoods people working together protect homes, give every time. Rookie mistake, spears/javelins lot better. 

Unless trained bow going much better range javelin, take advantage easier aiming higher kinetic force. 

They're easier make too. 

If actually make functioning bow shoots 10 feet going need fucktonne woodworking skills. that's even talking arrows. 

If manufactured bow bunch arrows, arrows still run eventually good luck making something shoots straight unless steam kiln press. 

Post apocalypse javelins way go, sharpen bunch thick sticks strap back good go. 

Bows also take lot maintenance people going able full collapse society. 

Javelins need sharpened. Vote better now, it’s  feds could come money. mean will. major power lasted full century ending conscription. take army broad cross-section population, warfare becomes divisive rather unifying. causes war longer need clear high bar justification civic discourse. all-volunteer army, killing foreigners help wealthy allies secure profitable trade relations longer heavy lift national leaders. seems like one narrow issue, really goes heart unraveling . . . unraveling Western Empire leading medieval era. There’s middle ground Twitter account. Everyone either sees second coming Christ, see literal devil. I’ve never seen someone says “he’s ok” “he’s great.” post text. China lies. That's fact. lied start. You’re never actual flu. describe discomfort.  It’s far away different cold you’ve have. someone certified case influenza tell feels like dying. 

You can’t compare someone else’s “discomfort” own. I’m happy don’t get level pain. 

The logistics CV19 booster depends whether someone wants die not.

But I’m cotton-headed ninny muggins Exactly this! use analogy: internet like eat buffet. fed nutritiously, actually go way make salad salad bar (in regards internet use: take time look facts Snopes sort fact checking neutral source, read academic study, things like that). people go make salad, speak, lot people won't. Yep! live Australia way higher taxes US I’ll take universal healthcare day dog eat dog system. 
Over 16 million Americans fought, 400,000 Americans killed, 670,000 Americans wounded helping world fight fascists ships, planes, tents ditches around world WWII 75 years ago.

There functionally difference efficacy face masks hand-washing.

I'm fine trade off. Yes says ""To keep reading The Week’s concise, refreshing balanced take world, please register details below."" ""Bandied about""? 

So, sub guilty better scientific information scientists themselves? discussing information meant ""bandying about"" irresponsibly that's led rise anti-lockdown anti-social distancing hive mind? really fault responsible concerned people irresponsible unconcerned people acting like idiots?

But concede point, managed find prediction come true. Using justify anti-social behavior still deplorable, though. Faucinator! that's bailouts stupid politicians corrupt.  parent stepping up. know. parent seems elected officials getting COVID Republicans outspoken masks, etc 

I realize elected officials diagnosed covid Republicans thus thought it'd super interesting see list plus party affiliation. 1 million violent crimes year, including 100K rapes 16K murders, I'm sure Americans would't want criminals street.

I know, know: ""Internet Headlines Spark Angry Rants!"" Everything working intended America yeah, plus going fall/colder seasons accelerate... alongside flu, overwhelm medical system potentially. cannot happen stupid like talk? high paying job would recommend? may worded wrong I’ll edit comment also. 

I mean way see worlds deaths record many people died without underlying health issues total time...with recirculated air. Social distancing really effective prevention coronavirus. Yes, data masks reduce risk. There’s many different types masks used folks, varying effectiveness. Masks work best party wearing one, too. can’t control.

Social distancing something control virtually 100% effective. It’s thing physical distancing (stay x feet away people, circulate air, etc.)

Social distancing means stay home. Don’t go out. Don’t go restaurants, don’t go bars. Avoid indoor spaces people it. Order goods online. People follow guidelines virtually 100% success rate avoiding virus.

Of course everyone follow social distancing 100%, masks, physical distancing, washing hands ways reduce risk go out. stay home, so.

It’s best way stop coronavirus. mean, exactly pandemic started. Gave big banks trillions dollars citizens $1,200.  *Let hunger games begin* south Florida wears goretex parkas hits 68F? Good. every right obligation protect citizens. Unlike southern neighbor Clutching pearls absolute horror notion fine business people, creators economy, makers dreams(!) would thing! could agree need GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT basically every facet American Way motherfucker ALWAYS going fuck everyone else first chance get. long get nut, alllllll good. Bitches. !remindme 2 years ^ China quarantine every single person enters border test 10+ million people local case found. hey, definitely local transmission trying cover up. why? Florida fucked containment sure, hospitals state surely unquarantined interstate travel screws hope making decent study this. It’s like Diamond Princess - kept everyone cabins would learned something virus travels location infected nooooo got infected staff going room room delivering meals  know virus impacts brain heart, two vital organs anti-maskers lacking. Can't find try volunteer life Shocking! NOT!!! know well internet stranger. give u award werent broke Probably combination bots, brigadiers, lockdown fatigue. Goddamnit Florida south people stay inside ac summer. fall get shut ACs off, open windows get outside. opposite north. didn’t criticize anything, merely suggested got politicians pockets zero proof. Doesn’t get textbook anti Semitic that. You’re poo-er Broward Dade people winter. Summer god damn sauna. raining afternoons ambient humidity feeding mold stained houses giving everyone fungus foot crotch mushrooms. Sane people stay inside inside AC.

Winter may reduce transmission. may not. wear sick. yiu think everyone Asia wears mask times ? wear filtration mask. Problem solved. Red Cross provide? Everybody else that, though. truly infuriating says ""make people respect us again"" humiliated us level never seen history. really? Asia seems getting along wearing masks fine, done years even pandemic. US always seemed like putting eggs Phizer, Moderna basket anyways. Oxford vaccine didn’t start trials super late US Nobody cares want. Put platform get elected. trial participants predominantly tier? Ron kissing Putin’s ass. Someday need another Kremlin puppet. Right? Theyre suggesting 9x ratio confirmed cases measured still retain detectable antibodies here... 

It’s majority means significant stat implications spread, testing outcomes. remember everyone thought gonna bodies streets like god damn holodomor. also remember article saying “covid already worse contagion (the movie)” like month pandemic. Just. Great. hat kimbo girlfriend works call center talks constantly anyways, im you. Herd immunity status: mixed blessing. Sometimes flu vaccine gives **strong** immune response means “flu-like” symptoms immune system makes antibodies. Makes miserable would like smaller dose booster. that’s available 

I hope vaccine available booster forms. I’m still encouraged vaccines future. Coronavirus quite difficult make actual vaccine for. mean people London protesting BLM back May cases continued going down, even staggered reopening things... recently cases increased again. need it, least right now, numbers low, infections found people entering country. detected quarantined chance infect residents. Rona&lt;racism.  Indeed. need eliminate (or near TTI system allow). people carry minimal restrictions. approach East Asia taken.

No one stopping this. I'd like Francis could stop pedophile sex trafficking ring catholic church  soon open running problems rest world dealing isolated heavily rest world caused irreversible economic damage people. 

The economic damage isn’t covid, it’s response covid. deaths significant economic impact either. People outside workforce greatest risk covid.

American way, take tax money meant pay employees (cuz that's socialism!!!) use enrich executives. benevolent healthcare providers *open economy* safely... least flagrantly dangerously.

And I’m saying people spreading misinformation. It’s okay scared overreact especially many unknowns like March. Oh see coming from. American tired anti-American bashing. Yeah knows. could range real haters bots hostile country USA. 

I think fact loud dominant (culturally - music, movies, etc.) people focus us. kinda sucks traveling one like ""Oh American! Tell culture!"" everyone around world idea already. (To fair, someone asks USA (Filipino-American) one gives damn follow questions culture. wanted know race race obsessed). 

I anti-American discrimination well. Skin color aside - leave USA together. 

My suggestion come quips them. takes lot historical learning - maybe Belgium guy talk King Leopold 2nd killed 5-10 million Africans. study done folks Netherlands finding 19% ashamed colonial past.

This narrative like game telephone. story gets worse every time told. People trying get us believe sub hotbed hysteria misinformation March April. 

But shred proof true. Well want do, change rules?! fair become billionaire. mean, anything net worth negative six-figures, read Art Deal matter time. 

Plus, ya know, jobs. execs put PPP funds towards personal wealth, job creators. Obviously using PPP funds appropriately would detrimental jobs. look it. suddenly say ""wait, US 7 million cases, 33 million"" virus suddenly much less fatal. 33 million study projects almost certainly low anyway, again... Less fatal.

Like imagine report came tomorrow saying everyone US right now, would say that's good bad news? get reasoning it. government pay costs actually getting employees, employees get exactly used getting, less, employees stay matched employers. problem ""greedy corporate hands"" makes benefits go away. I’m open evidence say landlords bloodsucking parasites. proportion estimate based percentage dialysis patients whose immune systems produced coronavirus antibodies.

This cannot extrapolated population general. Dialysis patients super-spread situations far likely catch general population spring, far less likely upped testing PPE summer.

The title clickbait and, scientifically, completely false. seriously doubt given low compliance west mask usage.

Simple masks suck, uncomfortable claustrophobic bring anxiety attacks. mention bleak depressing future pitching is.

You'll never see someone's facial expressions again. suck warmth interactions people make everything clinical. Weird someone would want kinda future honest. actually confirm tier? Age pretty obvious look ID driver's license. say I'm healthcare? going make calls confirm beforehand? self-certify... .... What? rational reasoning baseless conspiracy thinking incivility? cases, feds came confiscated PPE-- including states peaks.

MA get Patriots owner use private jet fly masks China, labeling ""humanitarian mission"" contents stopped confiscated feds again. Mom's nurse. None want beta testers vaccine. We've never coronavirus vaccine before. Could turn us cronenburgs.

Nevermind huge chunk already exposed point? G-damn hurt read. amazing much damage done couple years. Sure stellar reputation holy crap 30-40% us really f-d us big time areas. problem use correctly, pay back interest rates lower market would set at. this, companies incentive pay employees. comment responding meant. give $1000, tell go towards food, spend elsewhere pay penny, gave $1000 extra steps. That's fucking terrible odds .  aware 1/7000 comes death? blame lancet research readily available data set.

But WaPo publishing it, title, without saying ""yeah weird sample group"" disingenuous. question, though, why? Powers must money invested companies. high-risk, giving vaccine high-risk group punishing them, fair? highly upvoted comment? Volunteers fully aware placebo. volunteers instructed continue wearing masks, social distancing, washing hands. PA, districts several schools give infection quarantine data students specific buildings. Mixed clubs, buses, families, community etc. damned. Serious question. happens significant portion population gets infected COVID? Let’s take state Georgia example, population 10M. 300K confirmed cases. CDC says ~11 infections ever one confirmed case. means 1/4 1/3 states population infected virus. reason states like GA SC seeing steady decline cases Rt’s ~0.8 neighborhood? see less less people wearing masks going bars, yet new cases continue decline. What’s going on? gov florida opened state completely so.. get ready guys! church cleanse child molesters instead sheltering them. pope moral authority. Fucking Revolt pussies 2nd amendment for. That's misinterpretation original point.

What simply saying that, result pandemic, mask wearing prevalent general result habit. obligation.

Why feel strongly this? using interesting argumentative logic actually speak original point. enjoy discussions anonymous people.

There several specific measures discussed Andrew yang proponents explore issue, concerns, negate it. Also, market tendencies support basic argument ""if x gets more."" feel sorry too. Someone wanna give visa get hell out? Lol FDA historically strictest world comes approving new drugs vaccines. isn’t really surprise Yup brag smart self made.  dialysis patients. accurate cross section population anyway: dialysis, way likely wearing mask avoiding many people possible last 6 months. watch someone trip across street, amusing withering around floor pain broken ankle. Amusement turns concern. world stopped laughing long time ago, feel humiliated. hope there's effective vaccine soon. Stay safe guys. really need Disneyland Universal Studios revenue huh.

Two potential nationwide super spreader hubs ability enforce safety measures customers. end well. Expected who? many experts think that. Also April day mass inoculation *starts,* normalcy would still 4-6 months away. variant we've states months. suspected since March. exactly new news. Perhaps evidence it. believe vaccine. hope wrong. coronavirus vaccine before. going produce shit. want Guinea pig. Ya I’m curious studies done across population see antibody levels changed since start able model much bigger actual infection rate may be. Kennedy Center Performing Arts got millions laid damn performers, okay liberal organization. yeah, protein spike felt familiar literature read back March. believe trials attempt recruit wide variety demographics, reasonable chance exposed (hard test effectivity one exposed virus), would presume skews participants Tier 1. live Alameda County following closed/disallowed: playgrounds, community centers, team sports kinds, schools, indoor dining, gyms, indoor recreation (climbing, bowling, etc.), bars, theaters, live music venues, tattoo piercing services, theme parks ""in general"" mean wearing mask ""all time""? even wear mask time right now.

OK let's try simpler time.

You asked thought mask usage limited someone sick, general. said general.

Meaning advocating healthy individuals wear masks. opposite works Asian countries, could easily construed wesring masks shoukd permanent thing. brought ourselves. I’m sure mean that? implying wear masks staying home? pile trash shit thrones garbage crowns. soon poor can’t eat, eat rich. rich needs careful little wealth leak others. Andrew Yang popularised contemporary idea universal basic income. doesn’t somehow negate fact landlords bloodsucking parasites.

If give homeowner renter 1000$ every month: homeowner 1000$ every month. landlord 1000$ every month. renter still fucked. 3 Tiers. Anyone named two defined Tiers essentially Tier 3. billionaires, course! Given alternative, shutdown rational choice. think happen go 7 million infections 14 3 months? 28?

If care lives care economic consequences, consider happens millions crippled long term health effects coronavirus. People chronic breathing problems, heart problems, create trillions continued healthcare costs.

Also, young middle aged people surviving coronavirus part receive adequate hospital care. happens infection numbers skyrocket hospitals overwhelmed? Schools close whenever dangerous difficult get kids school required time. streets can't cleared time, there's school day. Remember kids travel over. used take 45 minute bus ride school every day.

I also lived coastal city prone flooding. snow days, flood days. water got higher 3 inches, school. Kids nowadays ever get since somewhere time adult finished city passive active drainage systems. rights! 70+ years: infection fatality risk 0.028 0.09..... optimistic. research shown *at least* 10% mortality age group, twice high CDC's currently confident estimate. demand money repaid along profits made it...its fucking simple, continue allow get away shit? believe NYC around 22% month ago, according one antibody sample.

200,000 dead *with* lockdowns restrictions. apply critical thought based upon science infectious disease think many would dead without restrictions.

People spread disease. Limiting interaction people reduces transmission. Less people die.

It's really difficult concept understand. It’s really scary right now. parents taking every precaution can, still messed up. dad’s friends unfortunately passed away it’s taking toll mentally. see stress parents call staying indoors long deeply affected them.  Pretty stupid “politics” isn’t allowed here. Anything involves closing businesses, affecting way life, messing economy inherently political. Found trump bot.

So even get one day sunshine week summer, long get burnt crisp, enough. body actually use much? Seems like sever overkill. Kinda like vitamin C, use much discard rest. curious.

Yes limit going I'm afraid too. respond right comment proof efficacy signal. That's largest scale trials for, control group. control calculate efficacy. emergency approval large scale trial. US absolutely large scale trials control groups. vaccine getting emergency approval without efficacy signal 50%. FDA also placed time limit 60 days second booster case efficacy signal comes quicker they'd consider reasonable timeframe check side effects.

In short, US standards still holding, safety criteria proven. published data large scale trials efficacy, criteria. So, yes, emergency approval unproven vaccine. kill you, shown actually works. Even US stupid enough damages could come releasing ineffective slightly effective vaccine.

They're saying want FDA approval particular vaccine, happens they'll release data, nothing released publicly proves efficacy.  say goldfish memories except alberta whatever reason. Every doctor I've ever gone given vitamin test wanted take like shit ton (10k+ IU)'s vitamin day advised taking like 30k week fat soluble therefore load lot week etc.

You may need take much 3k iu even 5k iu aren’t concerned it’s safe, concerned China could one vaccine US. course ridiculous root vaccine research matter comes from. aware (and is) things, right? though? know actual cases vastly higher even days different degrees depending location. 

Not accurate particularly comparable. It’s perfectly normal iron supplement empty stomach make people feel queasy.

Giant jerk wads.

Awful. lack national response also backwards ways cult acts. Thank info. Another question Im poolman. Work 4 days week, 7 hours sun, fully protect sun. Would still need vitamin D? That's confuses DeSantis you? go school situation GOD AWFUL. don’t feel safe leaving apartment, people don’t wear masks. president went store mask it’s making headlines. labs person ride van students second location. now, state manipulating numbers don’t even know bad really anymore. main reason living paycheck pay check goto work sick hell can't afford skip day. Poor people get paid time USA. live like money matters co workers. Sick workers goto work make ends meet infect coworkers. Even job offers paid time state requires long enough cover covid infection. 

So put different way - poor people spreading virus? It’s thing eat run i. morning I’ve never problems. think mileage may vary. Depends live. England often natural sunscreen called ""rain"". eww.  US world's largest food exporter. far. Never mind integrated supply chains US part of. Pretty much them. wonder got mad fine told DeSantis undo along outstanding fines. Funny much ""relaxed"" were... Shame them. go that. I'm busy trying keep at-risk husband alive. quarter Americans think orangutang sort American hero.

Yes, we'll live either way. depressing.

Total eradication something spreads easily pipedream. testing Let's take another moment appreciate man done country. Despite pressures president contemporaries, Fauci remained unbiased, uncorrupt, continues advocate science. continues relentless disseminating accurate information EVEN face death threats family. promotes unity message, meticulous word choice maintain tone neutrality.

He perfect model scientist, physician, public health figure act. advocate supporting following recommendations guiding friends/families/others same. How? life insurance policy paid up, whatever. wants stupid free it. far away possible. went “only rich pay vat” UBI, vat budget restructuring.

US 'bad' 50 different states thing 330 million people spread across hard control create policy around type thing.

You've seem lost track point entirely, scientists calling lockdown opinion. elected officials make decisions based data. Science tell us anything, field study. wish got meme ""Science"" saying ""If anything greater death rate flu, put lockdown measures place!"". Go virtual ""Social distancing U.S. Covid-19 pandemic initially voluntary rather response governmental jurisdictional restrictions,"" LSU [reports study's ""The analysis suggests stay-at-home behavior increased nine times late January late March, decreased 50% mid-June.

Kaiser Health News investigation found used prominent position medical community promote practices financially benefit corporations given hundreds thousands dollars — including drugmakers, indoor-tanning industry one country’s largest commercial labs.

Dr. Holick also stating studies Vitamin effectively cure Covid vaccine needed all. [This study also simply looked samples made determination without study people recent study conducted Dr. Holick associates looked samples Quest Diagnostics 190,000 Americans 50 states found deficient levels vitamin 54% higher COVID positivity compared adequate levels vitamin blood.

That enough make determination Vitamin makes one less prone getting Covid, much less cure it. junk science nothing more. given virus. thought men? maybe anti-vax flat earthers? No, defiantly damn millennials boomers ones blame causing much divide!!!

What pharma companies gotten caught anything bad baby powder lately? reason distrust Oxford example. didn’t poison Americans decades least. 👌🏼 78 year old grandmother got mild case covid described even bad flu. basically ended half family's desire take anyway seriously. biggest factors are, long person spends outside direct sunlight, much body exposed (without clothing). live Washington state work office job, go jogging spend time outside, vitamin production basically near zero. Also, work night-shift job outside night time sleep day time, production also low. depends lot factors. people really need take 10,000 IU often, many others get 1000-3000 IU (common amounts daily multi-vitamins).  Ahh, touched nerve. handsome lockdown advantage, it?

National Guard shopping.

**Coronavirus: New York Creates 'Containment Area' Around Cluster New governor calling National Guard help support containment area. Cuomo said troops deployed ""to deliver food homes, help cleaning public spaces.""  Here’s tip: don’t get reference, don’t comment. ruins things. although vaccine important final step fight, ready winter go through. ultimately pointless worry right now. need focus basic, practical things like hand washing, mask wearing, distancing. think people Florida smart? Oh boy exception early days Wuhan, never requirement stay *inside*. Nobody prohibited going outside property, every lockdown made exceptions solitary outdoor exercise close home. various places reopened, they've mostly opened outdoor activities first, many cities used strategy moving indoor activities outside much possible.

If staying inside telling others so, misreading misrepresenting official advice.  FaR rIgHt CoNsPiRaCy!! KiLlInG gRaNdMa!! Magnesium deficiency EXTREMELY common. taken interesting rabbit-hole. Totally fascinating. Even interferes anti-retroviral medications. WTF. One biggest factors people would raise overactive immune system causes cytokine storm, interpretation revving system good thing.

Well week two ago, study released finding correlation cytokine storm outcome patients. Putting nail coffin theory. 

Basically folks bounce facts ways tenuous logically, barely make enough sense follow rhetorically, make lifesaving decisions. say so. pain gets much worse, trouble breathing general time hospital visit. Hope make swift recovery! ridiculous, could least artificial body test on. Putting people's lives danger.

And regardless, actually know - make vaccine would *most likely* work first place. KNOW doing, perhaps make safe effective vaccine get go - without testing whatsoever. I'll take along healthcare mine sucks balls. deductible

Probably restrict numbers don’t make excuse. think D3 ACA law (aka ""Obamacare"") requires plans sorts (insurance, Medicare, state ""marketplace"" plans, etc.) fully cover one preventative checkup year. form coverage, able get checkup year covered, think $0 copay.

I know easy cynical mess healthcare system, ACA (aka ""Obamacare"") actually bunch improve worst problems. National single-payer like Canada's system still necessary next step, things much less bad thanks partial ""bug fix/patch"" passed Obama. Lockdowns temporary strategies used last resort destroy economy provoke resistance regular people. border keeps closed, threatening economic sanctions? Totally different in:

* Typhoid Mary never symptoms. That's accept doctor's explanation sick
* Typhoid Mary get reinfected - ill entire time.
* Typhoid Mary seek treatment actually actively tried avoid doctor chasing case - changing names keep working different families ended dying. Hence actively spreading disease. Joe rogan put months ago signs part ""we"" US post. least try make look convincing US going troll. want deal reality deaths high NY/NJ nearby states also screws cult-agenda. kidding aside. adequate testing testing expanded symptomatic cases entering hospitals symptoms. understand quarantine process better now. people (I know anti-maskers still people) wearing masks. think people better washing hands using hand sanitizer. Businesses time adjust make work flows line current guidelines social distance. getting better remote work able to. I’d include companies maybe let people work home one day week whole week permanently. Businesses able test contingency plans refine learned didn’t work. 

We learned proper ventilation. know steroids help. know Vitamin helps. closer vaccine many companies working one. 

So lot poor decisions early on, roadmap. think people wish could eliminate risks going full lockdown. 

The issue becomes increasing deaths despair, economy would take years decade recover (keep mind means many homeless broke), drug alcohol addiction increases, child abuse increases, domestic disturbances increase. honestly even best partners/marriages, stuck inside weeks months puts strain relationships. 

I could see lockdown plan going lockdown definitive end date. allows people prepare hunker awhile. Show Die state. point COVID depleting Vitamin levels Calcifediol worked well RCT saw 96% reduction ICU admission compared control arm.

It's something bad side effects, feel like study truly results like everyone would start injecting patients vitamin would see massive reductions ICU admissions well deaths, see happening yet? slow testing then. Problem solved! Take morning would like point state 80,000-110,000 tests day. testing more, although 1,005 bit concerning. That’s good know.

Nursing home residents starting look nervously Cuomo. leadership would Trump went golfing last 9 months never tweeted gave interview hosted press conference. Far fewer people would died utopian scenario. out, i'll threaten invalidate argument internet!

whooooaaaaa Still thinks America defines science? deal. country's covid cases increase tens thousands per day. convincing more. run autos 24 hours light. 

They need darkness. America dramatically higher mask usage Sweden. Almost one wears mask Sweden, official government advice [it's Defund police, ubi, open borders, gun control, cancel culture literally lefts attempts break things don’t like. Vitamin like all. fat-soluble hormone (a steroid), supplemental variety usually take skin produces upon sun exposure (cholecalciferol).

Your body uses mediate calcium levels bloodstream, important. That's people severe vitamin deficiency get bone problems like rickets. think repeatedly take massive doses D3, end much calcium bloodstream (hypercalcemia).

More likely I'd imagine, swallow 10,000 IU vitamin D3 day, absorbed body. case several beneficial nutrients fat-soluble; provide fat anchor digestive tract, pass right you. Sharing flaring. 12,000 people Montana? Depends state in, actually MAOI, always gotta careful taking those, leads things building believe Wonder helps explain Africa. thing consider recommended daily values based nutrition help prevent things like rickets. studies showing reduction respiratory infections mild symptoms using doses much higher nutritional recommendations. Dr. Fauchi said takes 6000IU daily ten times recommended nutritional value. I'd suggest reading research coming conclusions much take realize nutritional recommendations one data epoint created intention preventing COVID. China sleeper cells stop work send back ppe medical supplies Wuhan.

I thought virus started Microsoft. can't pick one study confirms want hear. scientists set national guidelines take consideration hundreds different studies act accordingly. EU official guideline 800 IU per day. US even lower. RIP economy. went looking statistic once. find anything non-Floridan Florida deaths pushed back snowbirds' states. felt like happen. Better sure works. Thanks information. D3. I'll cut 5,000  Pfizer one possible. Moderna readout stop time. Like Pfizer counting symptomatic infections certain time second injection, behind Pfizer chronologically. AZ allowed conduct trials USA pending explanation serious adverse events. 

AZ/Oxford going applying foreign-origin EUA allowed continue United States trial lack report SAE. That's happening. 

For Pfizer actually readout, need created something pushing 80% effective first try. new technology virus family notorious sketchy immune response. would *incredible,* unprecedented achievement drug development. 

Absent even interim readout Nov. 3 pass news vaccine kind. New lockdowns incoming 3,2,1... USA fewer cases world. isn’t bad compare results worst case 300M American die. would give Trump A+ keeping us alive. Oh well Arizona massive outbreak May. see lot mask wearing report since mandate, easily 90% morons covering noses. want stuck inside house already depressing pandemic. reduction GDP draftable army members

As long decide need draft people 70 years old, think we'll ok. said years, months thought deliberately infecting people major ethics violation?

I know UK willing break lots laws including international law get want surprised really. Oh, one, everything same, restrictions all.

What stupid question  means trump must get 1000 years Mars ? tell me, love sun! I’m Missouri too. It’s insane. block party street last weekend. Last night people pouring building someone throwing party. live near Power Light KC every night streets lined cars people going dinner partying. I’m really worried coming months hold us. Dr John Campbell saying months man Poor Western countries, helplessly misled Chinese without chance defend themselves. lockdown affected Australia's food production supply. price food also increased. Australia already committed keeping supply chains pre-COVID. idea Australia's lockdown somehow responsible food shortages overseas supported reality.

I'm really sure point is, especially since also literally nothing help issue. exactly think Australia could done go lockdown? wife pissed bought cow pasture.  Well, ""who wants leave stupid"" now? NJ took longer state reopen economy wouldn’t exactly say managed keep flat reopening. like flattened curve kept everything shut down. really top comment. I’d give award wasn’t broke. Meanwhile, France, illegal *not* accept cash, many places minimums paying card. Apple Pay, etc., big yet.

On flip side, stores required give change. Someone's going put 2 2 together go effectively cashless. seen place yet. must fun parties. taken cautious approach nursing homes. Killer Cuomo dumb rocks Deblasio even mental fortitude handle first round half-assed lockdowns. Ok bruv.
You're 200,000 deaths rising.
Its going get worse gets better
The current strategy nothing working.
What would ""other experts"" suggest?

Its really glass houses point, country acted fast followed sound advice. Yeah sucked, free roam streets unmasked controlled.

Your country laughing stock world circle drain shouting ""we number one"" Amen! similar thing happened mom's cousin Nevada. blind, rarely left house. ended getting transported hospital Utah. called brother lived St. George come give blessing (so dumb, right?) went hospital. Needles say, dead due covid.

My coworker lives Utah Co commutes Davis Co. sister say BYU two going rodeo last weekend. get life goes on, going packed stadium middle pandemic really necessary?? 

My boss came work sick back March. ended testing positive covid, told health department come contact anyone, quarantine week finally allowed testing anyone. pandemic really shown everyone's true colors. 

Also, sales people going door door selling stuff. guess least wearing masks, like stop knocking door!! missionaries. parents old neighbors come Idaho went around neighborhood visiting old friends. telling parents x covid. I'm like stay fuck home!! Ugh. frustrating.

I truly hope grandma beats covid complications afterwards. 💙💚🧡💜 supplement vitamin sun light vitamin D?

Edit: Okay hell website? laid like gotcha clickbait tabloid? worth, went disney weeks ago (I'm local). felt safer grocery stores around here. Disney knows they're doing. Capacity super low, everything wiped constantly, attractions closed dont allow distancing, seats cleaned rides, mask police over, close multiple seats parties rides. think got within 10 feet anyone magic kingdom entire day. week schools opened. riots everyday Aug 23rd month. Gee whiz. Praise Sun! fuck respectful discussion 200,000 people dead negligence. 🖕 Oh hush. Men can’t adversely affected anything. They’re never victim. SJWs told Apparently lot Americans think overblown get Trump office. bubble I'm afraid going burst soon, hopefully I'm wrong. fair question! But, I've already COVID. set good example (and usually wear mask socially distance) doubt personally put others jeopardy. think suggesting , 2020, can't really viruses appearing magic use science determine source. example, bats found source possibly look vaccine bats, on. I've taking mushroom supplements since pandemic started. Supposedly, mushrooms claimed great immune boosters perhaps that's due high amounta vitamin carry. one ever recommended stopping going outside. Daily walks still recommended quarantine sunlight known necessary humans function normally (as well physical activity also hugely important.) Lacking things weaken immune system average individual.

It's also recommended chance catching coronavirus open-air outside little people around next 0% (such normal outdoor activity like going walk neighborhood whatever.) lmao peak reddit midwest ill-equipped deal kinds surges, especially since prepare take threat seriously begin with.

My husband ICP / epi major hospital system Chicago entirely agree. rural parts Midwest ill equipped taken blase approach, metros definitely saw threat got shit together. know coming they're planning. 

The mental fatigue burn human factor extremely real, worried HCPs going much less tolerant PPE shortages kick seasonal resurgence, especially since nation MUCH time prepare stockpile produce like crazy. 

People keep calling hospital workers front line workers. aren't, they're last line; last people see way death. Every single regular fucking american front line, good god actual front lines SHIT job taking crisis serious, demoralizes ones selfless enough risk lives treating ill.

Healthcare workers going hell compelling argument never put position forced risk lives simultaneously threatened pay benefit reductions, government population continue make destructive decisions increase workload already overstressed health care system.


The silver lining we've narrowed relatively effective set therapies hopefully improve overall outcomes throughput covid ICUs. here. South Dakota mainly rural areas local hospitals Iowa saying people allowed come hospital Sioux Falls full. state denying it, however multiple people Facebook say otherwise, take worth though. Either way someone lying incorrectly reporting information. go? fault suck “By promoting fraudulent data, aggressively deploying disinformation, flexing institutional clout, Beijing transformed snake oil lockdowns ‘science’, crippling rival economies, expanding influence sowing authoritarian y’all cult? fear mongering. many people treated naval boats? Wasn’t board tizzy Houston’s capacity. happened there. 

But go on. oil remains cheap world divests dependence fossil fuels. Awhile back got blood work done found extremely vitamin deficient. doctor said something needed brain use dopamine properly (it awhile ago memory best) taking supplements greatly helped me. think would much already super low begin with. Since also started working outdoors every day think sun light much I'm sure start taking sound like heard lot critical theory lol

wypipo! taking vit like 5 years! (2500 IU)

Something like 70% Canadians get enough, shits cheap hell not. ""we idea many people infected know certain study claims"" ? getting sunlight frequently even without pandemic. really news. Sunlight known kill viruses (and things) long time survive well directly it. also news sunlight necessary health humans (and many animals) helps maintain normal bodily function. That's fair enough. mostly annoyed even mention vaccines referring to, unfamiliar readers might think they're taking random untested vaccines haphazardly giving people.

It seems kind dishonest label late phase 3 vaccines 'unproven'. Yes that's technically true efficacy sense, terms 'risks' article's headline, fairly reasonable degree confidence they're safe. article try justify suggesting potentially ineffective yet safe vaccines still constitute 'risks' create false sense security. Again, *technically* true, headline impart reader.

Not sure got downvoted reply way. thought response reasonable. anything prevent next one. Humans still expanding areas wild animals live. still massive animal farms processing plants kept tightly together monitoring taking measures prevent zoonotic pathogens spreading evolving. 

More that, plans new lifestyles majority population live, get around, get educated work safely almost improvement healthcare readiness.

We fucked. basically open second punch assuredly coming AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas health officials reported 3,283 new cases Saturday coronavirus causes COVID-19, along 121 new deaths illness. really need herd immunity entire population. unable unwilling follow common sense advice slow spread, goes long way.

So, depending many idiots think US, 10% may decent number already. Could also people suffer vitamin deficiency, tend go outside/be active therefore likely unhealthy due various reasons anyway? Maskhole Denying reality situation coping mechanism. say neighbour others nearby wretched virus - nothing severe winter's cold plus cough drags on.
..and youngsters - late 50's mid 60's. Guests receive long-haul symptoms parting gift. High horse?

The poor world trampled death hooves punishing restrictions promoted people yourself.

History judge lot kindly. Time buy Sunny within 100 mile radius sell cure Uh, DUH. people mean second wave period time they'll lock indoors again. many longer term chronic side effects? even started getting numbers yet.

Everything kill make stronger. Nah, reason. reason want show severe cases spiking like new cases. Dropping data report comment hidden motivation. is. guys want nanny state. It’s deeper wages man. Peoples lives ruined Europe too. way live. causing problems fixing. forcing victims stay home abusers, children miss valuable education, prohibiting elderly seeing family. backwards, rich greedy america LOVE lockdowns.

For answer question, don’t think it’s specific number lives really. don’t draw limit specific number deaths “oh that’s it”. disease bad enough justify lockdowns. disease significantly worse, might worth it. it’s not. gut biome it? funny think NZ's lockdown makes unique comes issues. realize every country, Sweden included, seen increase unemployment, right? record, NZ's underutilization rate actually rose less Sweden's unemployment. easy use lockdowns bogeyman everything bad happens though even facts support false claims, especially one certain narrative clicking link provided read little effects New Zealand's initial lockdowns children?

Which part article says that?

'The CPAG report said it’s driven growing unemployment inadequacy core benefit payments.'

Growing unemployment exists countries regardless lockdown. one escaped effect pandemic.

The inadequacy core benefit payments also nothing lockdown rather sub-optimal policy. ""no underlying health issues"" - clearly obese (BMI overweight (25 &lt; BMI &lt; 30). No, second surge yet. already took todays dose lmao. I’ll go back 5,000 tomorrow. I’m severely deficient that’s take high dose doesn't, ~~pray hard enough~~ pay enough priest.

FTFY. rapid antigen tests home Christmas? that?  get rashes face, hands, sometimes thighs hour sun exposure. dermatologist said polymorphic light eruption. subsequent vitamin deficiency caused hair fall took supplements. Dude stop, wtf!?  RIP anyone autoimmune disease... ZOE study, believe Wrong. Amazon, buy KN-95 masks (the Chinese standard) cannot buy real N-95 masks unless front line worker / company. Check see.

I trust Chinese companies slightest point, buying KN-95 masks risky itself. Remember baby formula? Joe rogan must happy hear Covid-19 scam. 

The moon fake. 

Earth flat.

Universe created 7 days.

Praying saves everything. doesn't, pray hard enough. Theory originally put forward Republican Georgia. need say more?  think Hillary deeply unpopular candidate, even among Dems  basically it. problem extreme right-wing politics done far-better job making feel so. humans require extreme register threat we're doomed. That’s even her. Yeah, like said he's dirtbag.... year jail excessive. believe system ""makes examples"" people. precedent?? 

The problem now, challenged, maybe even supreme court people proudly support case.

There people sidelines waiting cases like this. shortsighted give excessive sentence like that. Cavemen win again. well said Thats ok buddy - full credit - first person entire sub balls answer question, even decided whatever reason walk away tossing gentle insults way. Happy redditing! Yep think may come study recently said real classic symptoms persistent cough fever actually: headache, fatigue/lethargy /or loss smell/taste. fines help economy? I'd argue hurt it, taking money circulation. 

You could say help increase/shore government revenue, debatable would help economy. That’s spell Malmö. Yes. People stupid. ZERO critical thinking skills. see first hand family TIME. Bruh, nobody cares tough are. hope didn’t spread at-risk person saying lockdowns, especially maximum pigmented people really bad idea? racist! /s Vitamin often times part preventative labs, may covered. I'm still waiting people return gyms bitched endlessly closed here. Every time drive past Planet Fitness street me, barely anybody peak hours.

Good know study date. /s  Yeah. 

But among rich countries? We’re first.

Where right wing morons screaming can’t include third world countries numbers now? we’re similar level, seem issue including them.

So yeah, we’re well undeveloped countries. Maybe slightly better. Good job. enough population leaves would get less electoral college votes? source? thought already knew that? I've heard that's theory dark skinned people getting hit worse too, absorb much vitamin sun saw bumper sticker Florida years ago. ""Welcome Florida. GET OUT!"" Careful wish for. Yep I’m now. want beer mate even apologize. celebrated transparency data. Let nature take course. live cannot save everyone. That's life. predict pandemic, human behavior/product production think significant amount damage already done people's mental health - point question bad get. like joke, get covid 4 times, asshole. Correct. Canadians consistently polling 80-90% keep border closed. many Canadians even like hockey, fuck's sake. installed reptile UV bulb bathroom last year. miniscule amount UV light dangerous amount figured close zero natural sunlight get winter blasting naked body low dose like minutes getting shower could good.

I get really bad ""eczema"" (I'm starting think psoriasis worsens) scalp winter add couple drops tea tee oil scalp showering winter. made far manageable.

Edit: also someone sleep disorder, would like mention adding lighting light blue-green range spectrum high intensity make wakeful, that's placebo effect. Make sure use softer, ""warm"" lighting getting ready sleep though. base strategy rest country basically suppressed successfully since early year. look pretty good shape currently. deeply disturbed thinking reinfections. Common human coronaviruses shown 6-12 month immunity. thing norovirus. SARS different species CoV viruses length immunity unknown.

My concern government population cannot get together enough get vaccine year. we'll playing whack mole long time.

I reasonably confident going wearing masks generation. Wearing gloves vs hand sanitizer..?

I’m sure asked many times I’m brand new sub. Now, feel wearing gloves using hand sanitizer redundant public. entire time, I’ve wearing gloves rather solely depend hand sanitizer prevent spread Covid via touching. Many people talked prefer hand sanitizer kill virus contact. believe hand sanitizer effective more. gloves, careful anything touch gloves spread touching face bodily contact. includes gloves virus use phone. Obviously, little concern comes face wearing mask unanimous solution regards that. Nobody putting hand sanitizer face.

But, people often differ comes hands. always perplexing seeing amount people incredibly cautious wearing face mask yet completely leaving hands exposed. Hands available avenue spreading coronavirus. (of course, could always get family member home feel safe wear mask). take precaution wearing gloves making contact phone, car steering wheel etc. take gloves I’m away public. understand take 48 hours covid virus die surface gloves. 

Please educate including measures are. want efficient cautious. still feel don’t know enough coronavirus including air-borne virus is. Greatly appreciate it. think real shit hit fan starts getting colder outside outdoors activities/dining good options more. timing thing right spring somewhat fortunate, we've wasted chance bring control Can't wait go soylips Unfortunately, federal government *can't* ignore him, placate somewhat, least next five weeks. need trade goods continue moving across border, Trump's easily petty enough cut spite. one point CDC something thought 10 times many people exposed tested positive, see reason think still somewhere ballpark. W awwwww ss2as2a2wwwvc2vwvswwsww vcd. Qwas w Damn you, wypipo! factoring excess deaths assuming due COVID, that's case.

Also, pretty obvious talking confirmed deaths beforehand. Again. Stop sensationalizing.  took ""Florida"" title, I'd naturally assume ""Florida"" someone removed !Remind 1 month Loss smell/taste distinctive symptom covid.  I’ll check back month so, won’t second peak anywhere near first, it’s denial... it’s things actually work. FL locked wrong time initially never saw full community spread till later say NY Michigan. worst well behind us unless whole country gets second wave, unlikely. 

I never denied things bad, simply said hospitals never turning people away/out beds... fact.

You initially implied FL hospitals packed gills called deferred, moved goal posts totally changed said. Ever traveled Australia American? Never treated better life. probably hang salty socialist losers. USA absolutely leader free world functioning democracy probably thing keeping China becoming aggressive towards AU. Australians government well aware this. probably run anti american loser crowd think Germany successful functioning society US says all. work prevents sun exposure would highly suggest supplements even outside virus.

My sun exposure hit miss shift work know struggle. deficiency huge impact mental health. diagnosed bipolar nothing working properly someone finally enough sense request full blood work. Turns extreme vitamin deficiency resolved mental issues gone too. Going full Swedish model one state full retired people?

I'm sure climate still worth anyone's grandma grandpa. Seems bit silly way.

I click open state's contact tracing app, right welcome screen state's count, change day before, total number ICU patients.

It's *relief* see last number going down, even first 2 going up.

Am still going careful try catch this? course, much unknown long term affects such. knowing cases severe even 2 months ago, that's fabulous! Something must working! right. FDA declared review policy pandemic couple years, decide want go back requiring correct labeling. callous risk lives US, that's become norm here, it? ""let eat cake"" mentality above, concern lives. go Covid ward area hospital. See himself. douchebag. sure sire flu mutates rapidly, far doesn't. mean “fake outrage”? think they’re pretending outraged? Unless you’re 50 serious heath complications, you’re going fine. can’t hide house forever virus 99.5% overall survival rate. fair, antibodies *can* last three months (or less) - we've seen many cases it, declining antibody levels places hit early like London (see 4th-to-last-page mean antibodies *always* *often* last three months. Quebeckers complaining too? They're actually ones affected, closing QC-NB border.

What saying? complain everything. Frick, get more, backyard least, tan hell given type skin I'm pale... ain't good sign. China developed vaccine H7N9, everyone still friends, hoo-ha whatsoever. right wing upgraded IMAX level projection. fair, people got sick party could’ve chosen go party... even mean, BOT? Kraft parlors

Nice. Wait check hernia I'm sure they'll find way blame liberals. Admitting fault means admitting God Emperor clothes. people stockpile toilet rolls, guarantee it. flip side, stores required give change.

So theory someone could pay 20 item costs 3.99 refused change? speak obvious that's fake news days perpetuated mainstream media. Instead actually logical conclusion thing really needs locked schools simply can't operated safely, kids whatever want. Mask mandates would take care rest. bad can't either things. see crossed border recently (Canadian, went States get married begin process extricating bride). I've mandatory 2-week quarantine since returned. would actually okay allowing American tourists in, long escorted hotels locked rooms two weeks, guard posted door. they're desperate give us money, cool. B be. L rhetoric played out. Get new material. proper. family also postponed Disney vacation kids birthdays. disappointed way.

I'd like add friend still hospital Florida 19 days Covid. severe lung injury barely walk 10 steps. take daily ways need way identify economic refugees fleeing real persecution. Canada's neighbors 2 oceans USA. claiming USA safe really reduces pesky asylum claims. system totally broken, neighbors claimed asylum, vacation homeland every summer. perfectly understand producing quality researched content takes time resources, means money, course. still, competition, i.e. lies, free easily availble. many people go free lunch.

Maybe micro-payments would solution. want buy monthly subscription, I'd willing pay reasonnable amount access particular article. problem many newspapers; nothing. think micro-payment model would quite lucrative them. could even integrate support micro-payment browser...  Well Sweden best Europe, good compared countries regarding increase spread. Oh right words mean want mean! Sorry forgot that. legit sound like mother i've taking empty stomach months. According earlier comments live Denmark, using danish Ø spell Malmö, local pharmacy Malmö?

But serious finding mask Malmö, let know. know least one pharmacy one ICA loads (the pharmacy ICA usually visit, probably stores well). What's opportunity exactly? Orange juice companies love fucking hate get really high amount community spread, want slow down. Every day get better behavior, businesses get better adapting, health care providers get better treating it. Buying time saves lives long term health complications. Yeah it’s already happening UK surround areas. Sounds like wanted anyway, covid covid Deaths lag cases many weeks. Tell ranking December so. Healthcare worker here, we're already staffing issues. Lots Younger staff making stupid mistakes getting covid public, can't work hospital. Pacflific theatre WWII Japan responsible starting like 9/11 times 11,252.





Think 9/11, literally times 100. Twice. Times 112.529



Or would put Times 111.529 since seem want blame Japan consequences actions.



Moral story, start world war, killing millions, commit warcrimes whole time, complain someone pissed attacked grew tired crap pound submission. Alt-leadership? I've 10,000 IUs years. RDA heavily underrepresented. closer 9000iu, 800.

My blood work nearly perfect. doctor gives 10000ius patients, he's one modern doctors constantly reads new scientific literature studies.

Unsurprisingly brother primary care residency training give vitamin pills least 5000iu day everyone, minimum.

Modern medical study explaining FDA misreported RDA vitamin whole factor 10: iu supplement day safe literally 99% people, 10000iu ideal majority population ideal vitamin levels, still may within normal range wide spectrum. Covid news?  believe system ""makes examples"" people.
I dont believe bears....but still exist, maul fuck piece shit not....the justice system meat grinder profit ....no matter believe, get close fucker take life away they'll never stop benefits go short term profits long term investments. fact things like Banks can't fail big reason shit also never go away. edited title article gone site.

 current treatments

There’s really working treatment it. online school taught one thing it’s college worth much material learn class. college get meet interact people interested thing discuss actually intellectual things, join clubs learn new things diversify interests become well-rounded person, build relationship profs give recommendation letters grad school, build connections, stuff really can’t online school. 

I want go back in-person classes. I’m learning anything online school I’m hating experience. miss going school library study going classes meet new people. classes aren’t person next fall think I’m going take gap year see take trip across country something. Hmmm... Good news coronavirus control winter sets in...

oh...My...GoD.... WinTer ComInG. NJ took longer state reopen economy

They also hardest hit early shut down. exactly supposed do. also true ""kept everything shut down."" kept essential businesses open. opened public parks beaches around time states around them. Movie theaters indoor dining also started NY. Vitamin deficiency linked higher risks depression mental illness. understanding part area brain vitamin receptors found. also hormone would assume also impact.

That said I’m doctor. I’m simply someone struggles vitamin deficiency work. found started seeing psychologist bipolar like symptoms. Turns needed vitamin D. Actually factor excess deaths. daily max 2700. Factor another 20% you’re excess deaths may actually 40% more. depends define it. know raging crying race? stasi huge troll dumb, followers believers dumb. mother fucker making blood boiling. That’s good, zero way I’m planning trip Florida virus control.

I heard Disney cut food concessions park first reopened. still case? ever case,

As comparison go Manhattan last week, there, noticed tourists out. Certainly usual numbers people, can’t imagine coming from. still lot things closed. Sure aren’t crowds, but, like, like fun vacation, worry whether person next close. Exactly. use fear control us keep us subservient Who's auditing? asymptomatic tested positive months ago. proven otherwise, I'll proceed based reinfected amount time yet. We've made lot progress treating Covid, there's lot harm deaths caused infection. Wow. would’ve thought? Like million bucks. Never better. Lots places, like San Francisco, lifted lot restrictions lately. aquariums zoos San Francisco allowed resume indoor operations approved coronavirus safety plans, reopening changes took effect city also allowing elementary schools reopen in-person learning rolling Sept. 14, slew businesses services allowed reopen, including indoor operations limited capacity hair salons, barbershops, nail salons, gyms fitness centers, outdoor family entertainment. Seriously? thought Beaverton (satire) article first. “Yeah let’s throw old folks lion’s den they’ve worked years enjoying restful retirement. Great plan!” Don’t worry, soon you’ll able file refugee status things keep going way. ""Life hack"": trick go in, CTRL+A, CTRL+C paste word document. course, isnt country cant. wont #1 forever. time focus shift someone else well looking like everyone us right now. gonna time soon itll eventually happen.

Real talk want get refugee feasible way now. Plan that. like living really nice apartment meth lab. Chickens coming home roost. also, quick search Twitter comments documentary missed. Safiya Noble great place start. Okay there's another even bigger dumpster fire going another part world. changes exactly? Ya incredibly poor red staters keep voting best interests sure great.

Maybe poor get first. Maybe better give elderly first. Maybe pregnant women. know I'm damn sure Pope got clue either. first problem. people can’t handle observing. Thanks.

Thinking now, sort seem familiar. Ya, we're still mired first. We're good think are. Fun fact: Canadian immigration system many ways much stricter US one. Far less family reunification, chance expensive treat medical condition. feel guys. country shit hole government stupid people. said even shitty make chuckle Americans want refugees immigrants now. deliberatly patronizing, made fun suggesting rome ""stable"". think fair cotinue conversation level. offered detailed analysis anything.  

I obviously meant stable broadest term contrast US. regard rome able form continious political identity, despite external internal conflicts. US highly unlikely so.  
Almost every time someone points unstability US system, someone else points peaceful transition power, sadly pretty much thing still working even seems changing fast. crowding thing - lots people don’t control unfortunately.

Those us live dense urban centres make do. Doesn’t US one lowest, lowest case fatality rates? Oh, there's learning logic, machines learning. Learning interests put headlines front us make us rage-click.

*Okay, time hit reply button let reddit's algorithm learn disdain it...* Yes always thought aliens understand choice Trump hand power. people even bothering ask him...he choice. hand power...there's reason lead believe way that. one going bail US. screaming freedom independence forever, made point trying police world.

Lol. don't. Learn read. I’m fully support long committed whatever takes keep participants safe. time Olympics start, people rich countries like Japan would vaccinated they’d capable testing vaccinating visitors country. really think try? paying attention?

Luckily, military seems willing play along. funded gas taxes. Anything related DOT is. I’m sorry man, industries going great pandemic. But, really think won’t bounce back it’s over? Depends pushing. hate break it’s late...

Now, using cloth face mask p.m2.5 filters. also considered safe easy use cloth mask pocket filters. also bought sanitizer box Puraka store disinfect masks make sure I'm safe others around me. N95 filters safer, enough least healthcare workers fight others' lives well. sure did, irony seeing comment reddit, cant even see opinions differ main consensus. Happy cake maple syrup day look population density too. Exactly! shitshow.  felt sorry while, sympathy left. father still thinks USA world would worse Hilary Clinton. smh Seriously got serious four years ago already legit love north simply need reunite now. getting time kinda got this

Anyone seriously trying leave *now*? Way late I'd leave country gives flying fuck people arent rich country wants let essential worker class country. Gotta rich worth damn. I'm baffled I'm here. :( really sums republicans think nutshell. So, showing.

I live that. someone said done convo messages ago sure seem far done ya weirdo downvote can't read article American hypnotized christian nationalism play here, really looks like they've gone full anti-christ. guy followers really think he's chosen God plays it. assume US country Earth immigrants? Well that's false. places within US stricter gun laws Canada. he’s trying dismiss speech grounds trump using teleprompter. doesn’t matter uses one not, it’s still speech try discredit used teleprompter straw man. Username checks India universal healthcare...  stink jealousy. Yeah, ha ha, that's thre first reply. idea one from. Fair enough. ???

He asked speech, gave one, pointed thought sad picked one. 

I really understand trying say here. Incase know havent looked quick googling suggests quite quick routes regaining Italian citizenship. endorse message. 
Social media killed human race. Yeh, I'm 

Yeah, were. said ""[steps across border]"". Well that’s stupid then. 30-40 mins day outside sun isn’t enough don’t care then. you’ll probably catch and/or spread others. that’s cool man. I’m still going wear mask stay fuck home. mind asking, extra energy help mood? tend feel pretty low energy winter feel like might work case tried supplements yet There's always happy middle ground. Large museums buy art time, beyond that... I'd surprised Vatican's investments real estate less trillion dollars millennia... accounting sex differences Covid research could deadly

SJW Cultists disliked that. mugged someone since ever. People also speculate herd immunity could reached 40% masks level distancing due outbreaks primarily driven super spreaders rather individuals. check username twice Blame medical ethics excessively conservative lives stake. skipped phase 1 phase 2 (at least phase 2) gone straight phase 3, time get small-scale safety results. that's trump meant, say it


(Feel like ask every thing Trump says jfc) global pandemic? I’m closer San Antonio, unfortunately, outside New Braunfels would absolutely take offer! I’m need professional contacts well new friends :) husband know family far Covid hasn’t helped us getting social. Thank much kind offer though! Except didn’t get reference either didn’t ruin comment I’m pretty sure dead aren’t going get again. Stupid title. Bullshit. *the state skit reference*
Dead set super fun. Clean gasoline spill setting fire. Joe Rogan says told compare US Canada

Yeh, I'm though.

If want measure cocks, look US India.

India *(5,915,753 cases)* fast catching US *(7,250,345 cases)*, three times population YET half death rates almost three times less active cases half less critical list.

Three times population. Less deaths. Less active cases.

But okay. cold right now. Sorry ruin party demand freedom harm kill others. philosophies selfishness cruelty.  even sicker underlying conditions born with.

Apparently means deserve die. started taking vitamin 5000 IU daily beginning Covid hearing positive effects noticed substantial mood enhancements. also take 20 mg Citalopram mild disassociative anxiety experienced symptoms depression years. HIGHLY recommend starting vitamin regimen. true. started taking higher dosage vit March 2019 living UK grad school Kept higher dosage getting sick often (theatre, acting, touch germs passed like crazy) returned states. 

I'm also immunocompromised due low dose, long term corticosteroids. caught virus mid March swear vitamin + early doubling, tripling prednisone dosage saved ass. lungs shit, they've scarred bronchitis pneumonia, coughs linger, etc. gone lot worse

But COVID needed nebulizer. 

This know vit helping actually thinking steroids bad thing it. kinda feel like miracle. 

Please take vit now.  differentiate vitamin deficiency bad mood depression it? guy really wants limelight, he? really, no. unpopulated regions, relatively evenly spread across populated parts Canada, BC, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta... Maritimes great though worst hit far, double Ontario. Please - spreading misinformation.
COVID least 10x deadlier influenza. Atlantic bubble extremely flat curve handful cases time. Ontario Québec good shape currently. Manitoba implemented new restrictions, otherwise think Western provinces decent shape. would illegal corruption going on. Simply bad leader illegal. really stupid can't even follow simple argument? course making joke jest whole ""stay inside 2 weeks"" movement we're 6 month mark lockdowns starting.

In honesty though, wish best luck situation hope ride wave come better, even means looking new work! Oh please, don’t let vitamin thread degenerate argument much take. cities worldwide people live apartments. I'm major city yard, 70% residents last checked. percentage increases metropolitan area whole.

My city, like many others, also consistently encouraged people participate socially-distanced exercise closed number streets traffic create space walking/running/cycling.

In areas cities really possible create space everyone socially-distanced exercise, there's tradeoff increased contagion social contact possible increased vulnerability lower baseline health, think NYC proved conclusively social contact dangerous, least short term. medium term, they've also able partially reopen masks outdoor dining, New Yorkers probably spending much time inside usual. Well, live Kingman maybe that’s why. hEaT sHoCk PrOtEiNs Betting COVID seems like bad idea. remember guy commenting hundred cases attributed Sturgis 2 weeks event low number attendees. 2 weeks that, ND one highest cases per capita country.

We'll see. deaths pretty much plateauing cases dropped cliff slowed testing? Sorry, stereotypically Ontarian me, assuming Ontario Canada 😂. It’s never stock live. must level average person pays attention to, Vitamin studies level. Toilet paper, hand sanitizer, Lysol, etc, level. called delusion.

Unless joking, hard tell days. don’t know situation one hell year. I’m firm believer people changing giving second chances hope situation allows that. not, hope peace friend. pay small amount pocket order today.

Maybe first inform ask doctor really nessary!

There claims vitamin past Dr Michael Holick personally profits vitamin industry. studies could repeat effects.

Take grain salt. nothing like single supplement improves life like magic. supplements really thing going sun? way getting good vitamin D? difficult winter Canada get outside enough, heard multiple sources supplements good enough. know it. see pics post, least limited group people. That's something guess. mask sight... media reported Fauci experts Trump administration said? overplaying hand means?

Sometimes wish conservative, must nice cake eating too. real often get written troll brigadier energy trying intelectuales honest. That's quite true ALL. 
Neighborhoods Brooklyn Queens seroprevalence 50% getting hammered right 3%-4% positivity rate people going business usual. Heck, reported reinfections, too. media pick it. NYSDOH actively trying go back initially tested positive. China? believe numbers? Russia, believe them? Dr. Joseph Rogan colleague Dr. Alexander Jones also saying months. Netherlands don’t miss - love never worrying enough closest ATM is. lucky work home January I’m lucky currently seven people office. see point. 

In case, mask tell everyone fuck stay away. Sadly everyone that... wear mask can’t honestly say there’s downside. It’s uncomfortable prevents communicating effectively. miss smiling people seeing people’s smiles. Yea, aware that! many around ""ask"" mean anything partying tape face Bahahahhaa think ppl give shit? We’re fucked entire comment point think meant “vampires”? Lol idea person school obsolete soon. Isnt mostly one region Canada like, level hard hit european countries rest canada fine? Isn’t funny free speech everyone keeps secrets Since last study saw stated something similar (about month ago) I've taking Vit supplements. think NHS actually advises everyone take winter UK, I'm gonna keep hopefully see mood improvement also warding covid. Scottish winters get real depressing, here's hoping. brain tumor years ago surgery within couple weeks diagnosis. I'd really like people going similar situations open hospital bed too. Maybe could get people refuse isolate sign waivers get triaged first. Yea, sadly neither candidate wanted student loan forgiveness main docket... neither man wanted universal basic income... Nah like Trump. Sorry disappoint you. Besides true influenza kills people possible spread past.  Yes, general public world laughing us. appreciate thought. least world see sanity remains. aren’t frogs slowly boiling death ignorance here. Na cut several family members year plan never interacting again. real evidence necessity vitamin supplements healthy humans?

It seems Dr Michael Holick conflict interest profiting companies field. Whitmer fascist. Look giving people access vital information necessary safeguard health families... gall, woman. Getting extra wonders mood health. guess works Hollywood... Russia's problem less denying virus exist ""ha small number people die, risk death big deal pet bear"" attitude. Yes massive difference free even lose job. free even never worked.

Also mentioned deductibles.  needs happen need get rid electoral college. reason Trump office first place. “of people, people, people” form government isn’t really. probably get worse gets better people believe “two party” system. choices Democrat Republican. don’t get amount screen time. argument basically finished fight start kick nuts instead punch face.

Using metaphor bombing city nuclear weapon absolutely disgusting, even come close actual disproportionate inhumane warcrime defending. ever opportunity visit Japan, would highly recommend visit memorial museum Hiroshima. day-trip bullet-train Tokyo. Trust me, strongly affect way feel this..

All human suffering death ib wartime bad.. second think whataboutism able justify military decision test 2 nuclear weapons civilian targets.. far one darkest pages human history also tested low vitamin d. 50,000 iu 8 weeks. last test put back normal ranges, doctor told go ahead refill. finished second 8 week round. cure issues I'm having, know hurt either. Actually much, less deadly young people children. thought dumb Person make false claim Biden, person B responded refuting, person C nonsensically took refutation praise.

Exactly this, thank you. I’ve applied waiting hear anything worth smiling two almost three. It’s definitely going happen administration.  running LED's heat issue power ya! won't. Bruh.... know plenty work thing mask rules disappear November 4. recent update mask policy, they’re starting think things going opposite direction now. betting wont pass ny? wouldn’t say New York experiencing surge Even Herman Cain tweeting hoax masks work. People enough!  Michael Holick

the author one studies also profiting vitamin industry. also made claims vitamin past questionable. 

Take grain salt. Global pandemic redundant eventually end restrictions b/c people tolerate economic pain worse healthcare pain I’m trying remember sketch comedy thing spring breakers partying plague like disease like SPRING BREAK cough cough cough breaking sores. definitely wasn’t real could anything State SNL Mr Show don’t know look keep running clips real people thing.

Maybe Dead Set? think not? Sex House?  I'll take bet. find works? found difference comes SAD winter depression. need 15min twice week able utilize vit taken. :)  Non post weekly updates trial enrollment Twitter Here's Florida's current case/death charts, running 7-day deaths steep decline, now.

Florida currently 64.93 deaths per 100k, whereas New York 116.23 per 100k. Florida ways go catch Damn 25 45%? Didn’t realize magnitude. delivery circumference don’t go far though, blind living alone would harder going directly pick up, maybe next time I’m situation go gangsta route bribe 20 bucks deliver farther. Montana got locked 29 days. highly doubt lock us again. Even thousands fleeing bringing them. Hahaha HIV little common Covid-19. What's next strawman? realistically need placebo challenge trial, proven dosing regimen way. would sidestep lot ethical concerns, imagine they're that.  small business owner owns minority common voting stock due financing several partners shareholders hold majority board simply recapitalize company. equity partner providing set funds quarterly yearly ect exchange specific financial goals business ie, miss dividend=no capital option debt assets could done first place got lower rate. 

There many ways structure business agreements/obligations private equity make various payments effectively mandatory. addition tradition public equity, legally speaking, you’re consider adding dividends arrears PPP money it’s probably companies interest take money no? It’s like money gets forgotten, get things squared back away money’s gotta get paid still, however, like said I’m focusing S&amp;MB side. 

I’m trying make concepts super bite sized, said said nobody would understand wtf I’m saying. 48 million civilians died non nuclear bombs WWII!


Maybe concerned tens millions civilians died due conventional warfare Japan started build brutal empire?


Vs type weapon used.


We bombing Japan regurally year conventional bombs. Hundreds thousands dead. surrender.


We bombed Tokyo, months earlier. tens thousands dead. Conventional nbombs. surrender.



Bombing Hiroshima Nagasaki hundreds planes thousands conventional bombs would resulted same. Hundreds thousands dead. surrender.



Millions people would died trying invade Japan. 



Your argument basically finished fight start kick nuts instead punch face. Well, explains sudden worsening OCD symptoms Whats theory behind that? women vitamin ? people that's enough though, especially winter. Well, expect willfully endangering people come contact with? round applause?

What's next, denouncing crotch grabber shaming? This. stupid headline ways get vitamin sunlight supplements No, actually handing huge fines Americans abusing ""Alaska exemption"". Thanks Facebook I've read studies taken vitamin 3000 IU daily 2 years least me, make mood better I'm northern part world. I'm Pfizer, compensation may vary location sign NDA. $120 per visit me. think 7 visits well. answer you, asked question know better answer to.

What would define ""answer"" already met, avoid it, digged deeper know wanted actually looked numbers, that's say.

Then say said, check myself.

We know numbers even stated something yet? I've seen ask question, according logic (not mine), hostile.

Its mostly utility theory gestalt psychology. reason took time answer sneaking suspicion might gain something it.  next several months vaccine had, death count going absolutely skyrocket. Enjoy press DeSantis, everyone scared enough COVID tourist industry withers vine, guess enjoy job losses too. Yup, thanks checking, bud. Probably wants exercise using excuse find. take meal. empty stomach vitamin. bad annual flu outbreaks well? Might related surprises people? It’s do, live. happens country ruled dictator Local newspaper published article saying link Vitamin covid whatsoever, basically saying hoax  Dr John Campbell mentioned March, IIRC Based personal track use higher doses boost up, worries. remember AZ governor late 80s. kid then, dude booted. sharing show there’s will, there’s way case. Sunscreen blocks vit d? I've heard many people still claiming hoax disappear election. 

I get people pretending sick get say ""I'm cured"". pretend dead been? Fauci taking 6000 IU's daily, putting money mouth They're fully aware there's placebo, placebo. statistic environment thinks, otherwise perspective think environment thinks.

Since environment case world, makes statement kinda pale. people still choose limit interaction. restaurants bars open mean I'm going attend. Certainly going sporting events theme parks. Better hope god Trump loses then. Otherwise companies people delaying things reason Joe Rogan told nothing worry Poor vitamin status caused bad outcomes respiratory infections since long one ever infected human. prudent assume may substantial effect disproven, happen.

Of course important confirm relationship figure effect sizes, takes while. Nein (in German) true, even tiny bit deficient really impact person.  Great, going bunch college kids fucking ""prevent covid."" make headline ""taking multivitamin reduce Infection impact COVID-19"" know survival rate like 99.98% right? Dr John Campbell saying months. deserves fricking award amount good done year....! Covid19 doesnt see gender anyone else playing Contagion bingo? Considering milk isn’t healthy probably cut that. was. study SARS vitamin D, plus vitamin deficiency strongly linked immune system problems. There’s reason colds flies thrive winter months- less sun. relieving overtaken developing country 3 times population US? mean, take like victory... complacent society, yes. whole settled lot bullshit long time. Downvote away...it's true. people elected sub par human beings allowed things get bad. I'm fine independent thought.  means follow values.... neither work I'm confident enough ideas follow crowd.

I'm proud intimidated fear tactics. Turn TV off, knight see world differently Wait nurse isn’t milking exploiting hero worship telling like is?

 literally shaking right crying corner! took year levels start rising real amount. told unsafe go outside wildfire smoke. week half live smoke thick could barely see couple blocks away. known back February help Covid. nothing new remember TP shortage also vitamin shortage along vitamins vitamin effective. Correct. never shut entire economy protect virus survival rate of: 0-19 99.997%, 20-49 99.98%, 50-69 99.95% 70 94.6% wouldn’t facing catastrophic failure coming. CDC numbers. know people terrified media spewing can’t sleep night. can’t say “muh Fox News” like rest sheep leave EVERY media conglomerate. think right thing need look deeper it. Great video logistics around this:  Obviously India screwed beginning, high population many overcrowded areas. India 4x population US, kind surprising already passed US count. India handling quite well 4 month lockdown decide open everything completely fuck up. compare US's absolute garbage management situation. leader actively proven lie knowing acknowledging virus threat Woodward situation. Gosh you’ve got internet disposal still buy “USA shepherd rest world” American exceptionalism BS? Please read book country’s history. (en espanol) wasn’t main covid sub mid March. main sub China flu, swapped mid March Trump’s first covid speech. funny, came comment living New England means I'm taking Vitamin anyway combat depression, especially long winters. Guess I'm set! word looking ""argue."" ""argument"" noun.

you also conflate unwillingness \[argue\] inability so, despite indication latter. reason \[argue\] tankies always goes way. anything conflicts say dismissed western propaganda. value engaging serious discussion someone denies objective reality basic presupposition. go back denying genocides. Everlywell vitamin test via mail. It’s kind pain wrong like me. thought said touch test finger meant drops blood finger couldn’t touch drip didn’t get good sample finger stopped bleeding took weeks finally email bad sample, sent replacement test kit free. (I also 15% referral link you’re interested. Saves $7.50 $50 test gives $35. LOL.) got replacement kit I’m going try weekend. Vitamin known since day 1, ridiculous. first studies even linked COVID April/May. people afford houses new cars new cell phones new big screen TV new PS5, etc etc etc.

I know anyone making minimum wage afford apartment live alone halfway decent neighborhood (no drugs, gang activity, etc.) without government assistance. know anyone grand burn ""latest greatest smartphone technology."" people pay cellphones remain cellular plan usually takes 2-3 years pay rate $10 month top regular bill. Big screen tv? Black Friday deal tv that's actually 2 even 3 years date store trying get rid of. New car? like used decent shape. New PS5? They're selling previous consoles games saving remainder.

Or... they're living credit cards net worth - pay statements full - would actually couple grand red (and that's conservative much people borrow buy credit). Two years ago president called Americans died losers suckers Get here! didnt say anything protesting though. Im saying theres reports saying protests didnt spread virus either reports false events like spread virus Underrated comment right here.  HCQ again, Jesus. AZ trial participant?
I got selected haven’t decided I’m going it. They’re saying 1/3 saline here, it’s 7 dr apts haven’t said compensation yet. idea? I’m worried long term health affects dying. people got Covid near start pandemic still experiencing health issues. 

On personal level grandmother mild case polio young. recovering fine life past 10 years terrible damage polio hip. 

I’m eating restaurants I’m planning getting airplane time soon, overall life feels fairly normal again. I’m lucky enough work outside though. 

I questions current CDC fatality rates. lowered right fairly extreme precautions taking? let precautions virus able circulate readily cause overload hospitals? Could affect fatality rate navigate virus first flu season? 

I don’t know keeping precautions keep healthy fall winter. still uncharted waters. year sucks usually live life fullest I’m trying ok spending time hobbies. It’s actually 100% terrible either- I’ve learned lot year.  bad (it would bad, bad) border around state. Unfortunately decision impact everyone else. story? one really great job. Can’t believe comment isn’t higher up. came this. explains women generally less affected Covid 19 They’re also much higher people color. partly explains disparate impact, time complicates ethical research vitamin D’s efficacy. Agree, commenting US put hold. second AZ incident highly likely caused vaccination. opinion, AZ vaccine dead water. Source school study: study itself:  There’s cases goddamn state nations combined. part makes trash-eating seagull okay “ok, time guards down”? That’s it’s called CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE moron!!

He’s done research looked genetic sequencing thinks it’s modified humans, that’s it. course can’t proven, cannot proven virus came nature. live Utah, cases keep getting higher higher. governor sending thoughts prayers out. amazing many people see virus political issue assume going go away November. community spread understandable many people dying? that’s headline? wonder much simply people outside less-likely severe case coronavirus? article states correlated higher levels immune cells suggests least partially effective. it’s great demand government, even projections pan guys significantly better US. Hell even compare today’s US numbers future Canadian projection still talking 20% deaths US. (Canada equal 160k deaths projection US currently 208k)

Of course better US low bar since US ranked 8th deaths per capita remove Andorra San Marino (microstates)— behind Belgium Spain want compare “western” nations (the others ahead US South American). rate US going right pass Ecuador Spain pretty soon since looks like Brazil Chile Bolivia growing pretty quickly well 

Canada currently nowhere close that. one downplaying it— saying guys hell better job compared US. please demand government that’s way it’s supposed work Believe not, according Johns Hopkins, indeed 16 cases reported Australia yesterday. sounds like horrible granola cereal.  thought going ship Long Beach, California... :-) US government stands exists funnel much money wealthy possible. treat guy like fucking god there's plenty scientists disagree him? Update* got downvoted least 50 times far dollar every time past anecdotal responses failed predict waves . . . one reasons NY death rate high virtually impossible get tested back then. far cases whatever official number is. fat soluble. Take eat something fat (a tiny bit fat works). I'll even take fish oil omega 3's. everything right, enough people high risk activities, whole lot infected people, lower risk activities start getting even careful people sick.  Mor half population less 35 years age. Hence reduced death rate. Age demographics reason spain italy high death rate. following comment isnt sufficient evidences rule origin yet

 I'm wrong though, evidences rule country origin New Slaves. Lol comment aged well it?

&amp;#x200B;

You're inept moron stats prove it.

&amp;#x200B;

Get fucked facts idiot. I'm going back life eventually,  live Pacific Northwest already issues S.A.D. 

Suffice say I'm really dreading winter. live alone, social distance thing along intend continue throughout winter. know going real grind, worse previous winters. know friend mine 4 years old daugther, sick 2 weeks now. doctor said flu, without testing anything. monday kindergarden called said covid cases quarantine. she'll get tested 10 days. mother get tested new boyfriend, spended lot time last weeks need get tested too. quarantine. lifes *Remscheid*, Remscheid incidence value 70/100000 (infections/people). 

like said, little girl quarantine she'll get tested 10 days, weeks sickness. mean could reason curve still high going get hand. looks like try hide real numbers keep everything open problem destroying public healthcare system gradual irraversable, see intermediate steps like allowing private providers interfere system increasing average cost per services public hospitals, pushes away support public system private sector takes money. conservatives say like like single payers system actively support policies degrade, devalue ultimately destroy them. heard mansplaining. first time I've victim Swede-splaining. bought mask yet? local pharmacy Malmø out. Sure, babies supposed drink human milk though. cow milk. Kinda big difference. Winter coming. can't indoor congregating midst 100 year pandemic. nothing, give 8 12 weeks build again. Easy foresee invested fantastical thinking. CBC full panel time.  predict go 11K. less 100 days left, average 10 deaths per day. currently 9.25K, add 1K. 11K gives lot margin.

RemindMe! January 1, 2021 Vitamin special test. part CBC. That’s known group people flouting guidance regulations since April.

Parts NYC NYS might smaller outbreaks, part mask regulations, social distancing requirements contact tracing keep things check (by check means less 2500 cases day, less 5 percent positivity, less 30-40 deaths day). can, natural selection would mean infectious strain would spread faster hilarious wrote ten characters ""-something"" instead changing one digit bad trump bad too. Keep crying. That’s true regarding AZ’s candidate. won’t know anything it’s efficacy publish signal. Precisely think they're rural numbers low, take many precautions.

I'm dealing right now, took job rural county one coworkers said exactly that. ""We worry much county's numbers low."" another coworkers quickly corrected mentality did. kind complacency that's going trigger outbreaks rural yokel can't critically think. video relevant political decision:  Ill ask baby one next time... they'll plans involve vacationing outside US  second wave. SKULLS DECORATIVE HALLOWEEN SKULL THRONE Roosting chickens? know means. Eggs Sunny side up! Man u India u understand conditions better  here. wealthy , access internet afford holed poor left fend themselves. Loss livelyhood huge terms numbers unaccounted due unregulated sectors. people voice(internet) concerned. Also population demographics pretty good india. half population less 30-35. thought too. Right border ""30 something"". Womp womp Looks like people Nova Scotia nearby provinces something right. What’s secret? Vitamins ADE K fat soluble. need eat something fat get absorbed still humans believe Covid19 isn’t going away. chance stopping long gone

Edit: ah, remember sensationalized titles like make take NYT seriously. stand doorways we're safe?

also, second wave we're first wave? clear. milk 10 percent daily value according FDA incorrectly set. thinking liquor cabinet yah Yeah, tough spot sure. reinfections increasing, still requires lot work confirm. past month, number confirmed cases went 0 reinfection takes lot work, time, samples infections. available time. number suspected cases higher. anyone jumps conclusions ran almost 100k test, 1% rate huge jump cases something keep eye I’m gonna wait around third country like “no, go first”.

The reason good everyone stop socially distancing wearing masks effects vaccine kick immediately; it'll take time occur, want people going caring, likely might fully protected vaccine, ending infecting immunocompromised neighbors elderly relatives. take appropriate precautions, reduce chances happening.

As Dr. Offit pointed out, vaccine ""magic gold dust"" returning normal. know that's lot might *wanting* believe, *sounds* good all, remember: best scenarios always realistic. reality, vaccine one weapon arsenal COVID-19, along mask-wearing, social distancing, gathering restrictions, closures/cancellations. *replace* them, *complements* them. everyone, skeptics, trouble grasping accepting beyond me. Thanks Khorne “Experts” habe warning Easter time , warning summer vacation warning school openings. warning coming surge. Innovative tried. 2 anti maskers come visit. surprise. One 10 hours away ""Hi town."" Neither experience ended us closer getting along better. wish actually let stay home away them. Reports nationwide increase coming everywhere. great time DeSantis reopen Florida, ignorance recklessness dont count re-election 2022. lot African Americans Vitamin deficient black skin blocks it’s production. Could reason worse outcomes? bad. Corrected definitely strange Ive heard. vitamin world still get fucked dont know immune system reapond it....Very true. CNN worshippers manipulated hourly freedom fetish need controlled, needs education consistent message. people rebel ""no shirt, shoes, service?"" Add ""mask."" Simple. get consistent message. waste time minority victim complex parasites? arent even worth including statistics like faith science. Want willing different things.  Yeah drink alot milk eat cereal fuck ton afterlife. report moron bad information Dear Cons,

Glad help.

Sincerely,

Retired teachers believe plandemic hmmmm almost staying inside fucking time bad sun helps? crazy! would known! agree wear mask vaccine available average joe. I’m gonna wait around third country like “no, go first”. Nope, it’s available it’s individuals responsibility either take not.

Have vaccine, hopefully bring death levels bad flu season level consider with. never moral superiority thing “oh god, killed someone passed flu them”. 300k+ RTFA news means possible - know before. news points new area needs investigated. news means people infected assume they're immune need take precautions. news means maybe people assume long haulers (sick months, often symptoms disappear reappear) actually reinfected. FFS, grow brain head recognize good bad. crackhead...girl tune people out. Thank God fiance share views that's matters me. Know mean, house full plants lights timers. Lovely! Helps mood hugely especially daylight hrs. short. wake mid winter greenery bright lights Gtfo doom gloom Trump proud grand-fatherland.

Seriously, avoid state costs. Clearly, can't. always thought odd side effect depression meds suicidal thoughts tried Wellbutrin. went mild depression thinking killing 24/7. wanted fuck everything sight hear common side effect Wellbutrin. Either way, wasn’t long. think would go along long term best interest country. also think eont come full lockdown probably regionally based. state technically one system, within system 3 different funds. One Teachers, one public safety (police firefighters, emt, etc.) another basically employees state local government qaulify. used defined benefit plan municipality paid half state paid half. changed state sometime 2010. started making Teachers pay 5%. change made Governor state legislature time. Again, Teachers. 1st year implemented required localities raise pay 5% loss, applied year. gross pay went up, net pay adjusted compensation one year. Also, next several years state legislature voted ""defer"" share cost, never paid back deferrals, even times strong tax revenues. So, original published online paper. annoyed post article even include references itself. really make habit.

This sound like everybody supplement Vitamin now, actually severity cases refered hospitalized people least 40 years age. None ones age died.

This study \*not\* say, reduces risk infection. make up? That's still extremely slow increase. Alex Jones saying years started saying specifically reference Covid. he's evil propagandist wants sell vitamin supplements. deadly viruses covid-19 stupid science denier. Winter going suck warn surge didn’t happen? gotcha, thanks. Stop lying backwards think. mean matter “drop restrictions” even zero current infected. Wouldn’t title still hold true? Obviously it’ll future date it’s certainly strange title. Chinese-Style Phase III Trials anybody know research determine whether MERV 8 filters effective aerosols? technically vitamin hormone think? also needs adequate levels vitamin &amp; K work properly. Try get fat soluble vitamins food possible - less chance overdoing it. I'm right far. Canada partisan US, sure close - there's almost nothing except keeping border closed agree on.

Username checks out. b4 whataboutism &amp; fingerpointing @ USA Probiotics would help right? point money magically make difficult problems tractable. Also, vaccine safety something constantly monitored (albeit well). vaccine deemed safe today may withdrawn 5 years road. could another coronavirus crosses humans one current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines makes *more* susceptible cytokine storm presence new coronavirus example. unforeseen side effects take manifest.

The accelerate development trials current vaccine candidates, less certain long term safety efficacy.

I'm saying elongate process; clearly time essence case. definite drawbacks pushing vaccine quickly.

Finally, true far researchers resources devoted finding plausible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine historically viruses, divided among many different candidates faith particular candidate necessarily higher. That’s fair. wouldn’t credit 100% NYC’s improvement early infections. However, think severity initial impacts plays outsized part steady decline there. Look everyone we’ve found supplement denier!  Oh justice that. One officer charged shooting neighbors walls.  think there's much concern antibodies VS cells simple reason much easier cheaper test antibodies. found ways steal data ""It flu Covid"" ""Biden's fault"" obviously. possible attribute excess deaths covid. may may related.

I believe would best report excess deaths percentage expected, consistent ratio states. hard tell without digging numbers ""20k excess deaths"" means. future, would nice reported number percentage, everyone quickly know severity (20k South Dakota would catastrophic).

I bit searching found [overall mortality around 860/1000. Texas population 29 million, equates 200k deaths. excess 20k equals around 10% increase.

Texas also fast growing state, (more 1% year) deaths expected happen year (not sure numbers report take consideration). relatively minor, still important.

To even precise, needs adjusted reported age. 

Just took another look [CDC 15% total excess Texas, 20k total said. Subtracting covid deaths, leaves around 5k. probably within range normal statistical variation. final data likely change significantly, theres really way analyze 5k deaths point really important attribute covid point.

Coronavirus never “going away” I’m really sure goal? wrong benefits locking country outweigh negatives. clear point negatives outweighs positives. i’ve taking 2,000 daily thinking taking max amount. Obviously answer Karen Facebook 

Trump never acknowledged first wave 

Fauci seems think first wave can't ignore president one power actually something federal level. Trump actually ignored much get away things.  No, think repeating Chinese propaganda showing literal military men white quarantine suits running street spraying huge plumes white smoke (or something akin) buildings ""disinfect"", showing us hospital boats docking entire football fields worth stretcher beds set like field hospitals, quarantine tents, showing us words bold letters TERROR, STAY INDOORS, FEAR, etc. BLM popped everyone ignored fact Portland fucking fine. like.... wear masks yet riots protests ignored. simple. hospitals get Italy. sky fall. like lot people I'm surrounded by, default view like pretty overblown.

The average person read nuanced numbers grub dig truck reddit ""more information"" (which I'm sure even good thing regard - people need know wash hands wear masks). social distancing mental illness normalized. see way people behaving now? insanity. go virus stuff. Shit Schools open city (America) rates going up. Sweden fine, coveted previous posts. death rate 10x neighboring similar countries. Pandemics always end socially end medically. Ughhh. never mask restrictions. Yeah would rather go 0% cash high, crazy high. people handle 10,000 day. 5,000 safe. wuhan lab😏. fr theyre reports couldn’t possibly naturally made I’m pretty sure Chinese scientist knows Joe Rohan screaming 6 MONTHS now. days get shorter cooler people close windows cases rise, likely dramatically. transmitted aerosols. need focus high quality masks (KN95, KF94, N95) teaching people ventilation. 

Schools likely go distance year, probably new stay home orders well. Regular masking helps, probably enough prevent worse third wave. Canada trying social distance Americans. physically hurts, atleast multivitamin empty stomach. Loaded vitamin Joe Rogan slamming DMT arteries reads this. He’s saying months. average outcome “anecdotal bullshit” outliers “prove” point? Lmao it’s threads like turn antimasker.

And people wonder antimaskers constant “quite frankly always wear mask it’s easiest thing do.” Y’all aren’t helping pro-mask case. screening temperature check, everywhere, lie rest it, well know. proof try teach kids brats grow up, adults can't practice preach. Never say I’m Alberta. probably could made money didn’t change fact alberta still sent billions dollars provinces years. IKR bet never watched YouTube videos! cause always number 1😎 absolutely right. backed countries. 

Without knowing source, could heading new pandemic every year know, Florida reopened pretty much everything true, ***vastly*** true boomers.  Seems way reading well. Maybe something changed since late 2019 tried use cash many places said bother phased date mentioned. matter time though less 1% GDP cash. East, one four provinces 'net-receivers' like Alberta now.

Alberta receives payments sends out. (Because fucking squandered resource wealth.)

And Alberta, probably understand making billions dollars absolutely shitty made dozens hundreds times that, sold (and our) future criminally lucrative oil deals.

Look Norway oil. look Alberta. damn fools.

Hard working not, sold leaders never damn thing (other live high hog eye future). bad anxiety many many years ago last several years nice.

After 3 months pandemic wake anxiety fear. thought getting back normal life makes anxious too. also getting random panic attacks. It’s weird I’m scared virus anymore

Anyone else this? slow mutating virus that's going happen would take far longer virus article talking did.

As virus benefit attacking immune system virulence possible evolve weaker. people tried stressing depressed? german speakers:

A pretty cool report Ischgl Austrian Public TV Broadcaster (ORF). Government question split imo. National vs state response. ""More 1,000 New Yorkers tested positive COVID-19 single day Friday, marking first time since June 5 state seen daily number high.

The number positive tests reported daily state steadily inching recent weeks, trend possibly related increasing numbers businesses reopening, college campuses reopening children returning school. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday 1,005 positive cases tallied previous day 99,953 tests, 1% positive rate.

From late July start September state seeing average around 660 people test positive per day. seven-day period ended Friday, state averaged 817 positive tests per day"" Agree. Death rate 0.1% nothing pandemic it'd 140,00 use actual population numbers. (328/37.6*16,000)
and WinkMartindale says,  future predicted number. usa much higher end 2020.

We're way way way way better USA. usa huge peak July. Canada didn't. option single parents working parents. Also, everyone afford buy child computer. able hang Corona? here. bad anxiety many many years ago last several years nice.


After 3 months pandemic wake anxiety fear. thought getting back normal life makes anxious too. It’s weird I’m scared virus anymore 

Anyone else this? get corona, get corona

Remember Spring Break concern? Needs CCP nope. Like every week.  least need fear protests spreading virus civil unrest. Oregon hit daily record cases week. protests caused outbreaks, Portland would hotspot months ago. surprising kind Governor Florida has. randomized control trial segregate groups compare data sets, observational study you’re simply looking group people. data set group 235 people sufficient data make scientific claims based on.


Also RCT (randomized control trials) you’re actively controlling variables would bias study way, whereas observational studies you’re examining one group people similarities trends. even get paid public preschool kids qualify free pre-k would pay get remaining slots lottery ATM's sketchy. used one years. doing? google found highly speculative articles. seems like idea comes economic study saying cash become net loss companies cause less 7% transfers. seems kinda cause amount transfers made cash probably differ quite bit depending store looking at. also think major groccery chains stuff would take minor loss avoid bad PR

I live safely say hasnt really political push cash. isnt push get Sweden legally cashless 2023. Sweden isnt going cashless direction politics. Rather going direction cause convinience also companies.

In 2012 major banks Sweden released collabarative app allowed quick small bank transfers easily via phone number basically last nail coffin quickly giving someone money like last general use cash. *political* push. 

What im saying wont law 2023 makes cash useless. places gradually go cashless, places basically already are, probably areas use cash quite future. blood banks check COVID antibodies donate. Free way check good thing too. normally drawing blood getting shots?

Last time blood drawn fainted waiting room hit head table.  need pull trigger either. Like said another post, nuanced. However topic goes actual numbers people affected. Someone else mentioned job types. don’t numbers that, certainly something could looked contributing factor. people say racism big reason, don’t see numbers support that.

I speaking people say Covid affecting black people, proving racism real. dumb argument. mask mandates joke...people wear little enforcement. Why? anti-maskers turn crazed lunatics say anything them. saw footage National Prayer Walk DC Christian right largely unmasked there, too. Oh hypocrisy marching pro-life can't bothered wear mask protect ones around right now... accurate, strategy prevent hospitals overwhelmed setting rules recommendations could sustained long term. wanted avoid going back forth severe restrictions could confusing population lead less adherence recommendations. knows right call long run, they've kept word recommendations pretty much spring. Move here.

I'm still waiting first one.

On second thought, don't. We've got one worst outbreaks earth. vitamin d. iron. much projected number US? I’ve taking Vitamin since 5 years now. Started taking lived Bay Area live Midwest. Gave pretty quick energy mood boost.

It’s relatively cheap supplement, give shot think it’s something need/want.  quick, mods! Corona do? haven’t.

I'm boat. Covid also sound healthy either, especially family high risk. else supposed do? mean half activity DeFreeKarmaNSFW, technically wrong, rest activity making nonsensical responses, remaining comments spreading misinformation COVID-19. Must changed since last end 2019. Shame, cash pretty antiquated. fact Sweden 99% cashless (their GDP less 1% cash point) means places still take it. Oh fucking Love WFH keyboard bruisers. love whenever talk/type demonstrate utterly disconnected rest society much contempt essential workers. know, approve even admire essential workers they're told going work home work home. But, evidence recent Coronavirus post essential workers crying throughout day, causing mental breakdown. 

You work home disconnected keyboard bruisers need people like me. I'm willing treat Coronavirus survivors willing treat people nursing homes. eat indoor restaurants go gym. actively encourage essential workers engage social activities, otherwise they're going last. Zoloft backorder major pharmacies. 

I getting worn occasionally envy WFH life. enjoy people need help. mental deterioration spilling workers treated. Yeah, it’s mind boggling see people upset simple thing do! One coworkers worked angry telling granddaughter gotten irritated skin mask wearing day, asked her, “Don’t think irritated skin better COVID-19 though?” Like? Come please! live PNW taking Vit years start taking daily last April reports starting coming out. 

Holy shit feel better two weeks passed. amazed LESS depressed, tired weird facing total bankruptcy isolation due Covid. 

Take daily vit folks. really seems work. means controlled experimental setting researchers aim change single variable order measure effects. Thus it’s impossible know sure vitamin deficiency **causes** greater susceptibility COVID, factor causes vitamin deficiency greater COVID susceptibility. latter case, fixing vitamin deficiency would effect COVID susceptibility.

Vitamin K1– involved blood clotting. Vitamin K2– body needs move calcium belongs bones. Otherwise could end veins arteries = heart disease. 
K1 get eating leafy greens.
K2 animal bacterial sources like grass fed butter (best), fermented foods like natto, ideally gut bacteria. MK-4 MK-7 forms K2. 

The main concern people going start mega-dosing Vitamin increases body’s need K2. creating deficiency potential health effects. fools think changed virus long contagious inside closed space? Wish fucking knew two years ago started taking hopes would help depression. county California reopened indoor dining, they're talking reopening Disney. see things moving toward another lockdown rather going full Florida.

Magnesium citrate high bioavailability; among highest chelated magnesium salts. 

It’s magnesium oxide cheap magnesium low bioavailability. Yeah, what's big deal? Everyone knows fuckup somewhere China, need know how. bad luck? development rural areas? Cultural practices? activities? I've gotten sick exact rate supplementing vitamin D. 

However, extreme measures taken control pandemic left respiratory illness free since measures put place wonderful. hope increased cleaning, hygiene, mask wearing cold flu season stick around. How's weather mother Russia? problem attitude first place. It’s selfish thought. listen last denier pleading ICU people wear masks, think anyone listen him?

It’s vehicles burning fuels.  Funny enough, 50,000iu weekly vitamin last year due large deficiency -- still year next week. Part Celiac (we absorb things well) part working indoors more, indoors gym, etc -- even though live Los Angeles.

I went London first week December last year, got sick near end trip. Relatively mild, kinda weird feeling. Came back, girlfriend got extremely ill 3 weeks, best friend ended going ER also extremely ill 2-3 weeks. fine less week felt like mild cold.

China tearing highways quarantining hundreds millions. Quite effort propaganda. Florida. surprised, possible point. pretty much sum understanding virus March 2020.

Luckily, understanding evolved, see drastically different policies across Europe. strained hospital system Lombardy reason lockdown Bretagne.

A hard lockdown, also, sustainable.

Etc. good thing system period. generally better get going out, though, rather trying supplement it. There's decent number links vitamin healthy immune system. complicating factor outdoors main way synthesize naturally, usually coincides healthy activity, probably also going correlate healthier diets. So, chicken egg scenario. vitamin support healthy immune system healthy lifestyle result higher vitamin levels chance?

Either way, pretty heavy correlation that's observed repeatedly bit stronger average health industry nonsense. Wuhan virology instute labs. Case closed. live Key West say great certainty many residents shocked, appalled disgusted.

Don’t forget average 5 years supplying. it’s like 15 years get 100k 6 years post secondary many additional qualification courses. rich greedy america LOVE lockdowns.

Yeah. Good don’t draw limit specific number deaths “oh that’s it”. disease bad enough justify lockdowns. disease significantly worse, might worth it.

Significantly worse youre able say means exactly. Doesnt embarrass write that? like youre taking pride willfully idiotic. Yeah deficient got blood work done since covid even frequently eating mushrooms.

The good thing I’ve playing lot golf friends can’t go sit bars. Getting tons good sun way. people run megadose vitamin shown benefit people deficient every time see something it. 

Public health agencies handling messaging strategy account stupid people, unfortunately part population capable processing information without misunderstanding harm selves end getting dumbed messaging.

Previously, I’d supplement fiber (Metamucil) Magnesium citrate uh, keep trains running time. long perfect... point could set watch it. 

Recently, hasn’t perfect... like haven’t supplementing magnesium all. checked back bottle whose main, large front label says “magnesium citrate,” see back label says “Magnesium (from Magnesium Citrate, Magnesium Glycinate, Magnesium Malate).”

So wonder trains haven’t running time. magnesium forms (glycinate malate) negligible effects pulling extra water intestines. modelling behaviourism already poor far reality within field.

Hey cheers will! Hope great time bud surprise sub lol NYT publishing story proves serious news organization anymore. coronavirus situation France Spain example worse US. blame horrible leadership. I’d suggest there, especially want kids. Unless ton money. USA pay-for-play extremely minimal social safety nets. family moved around lot couple years lived near Superfund site designated area.

Americans fat. fat contracting covid particularly bad situation. rest world probably fine lol. Honestly, feel bad U.S. also feel scared shitless ourselves. example, im German unfortunately US supposed biggest ally, whether like not.

 like it, we're DEFINITELY gonna like fact US tons nukes military bases Germany... mean, first lockdown cause issues food supplies already? makes two us. Supressing things help good shoe precious government wear. Nobody really gives fuck feel bad. whole shebang quite obviously fake gay. eat recalled onions caused outbreak last month? Yeah, got lifetime ban r/conservative.

Finally, supplies ramp up, regulations phased requiring vaccination prior travel, attending school, etc. thing Australia accomplished last couple months holding giant beach ball water. 

Once restrictions relaxed, cases come back. 6th grade science teacher failed, allowed social media FOX News convince 'masks work' First week Fall? Fuck it, we'll live! *taking supplement* help? 

Every time see study, *already sufficient levels vitamin D* helps you.

Absolutely one thing another. “right” answer. atleast one part equation factual numbers supporting greater conclusion. 

As point, would also another factor able supported numbers. numbers are, without research idea. Wouldn’t hard find information though able find another causation. 

This kind research would important, black people, different kinds groups/classifications people. Unfortunately, instead research, lot people want #1 cause systematic racism, aren’t willing research. make statements supporting conclusion, instead research find real issues. hurts everybody.

I guess Sooner later, almost hospitals around world collapse...all dumb antimaskers must proud themselves! 👏👏👏 Deaths aren’t accurate either people die Covid even make hospital.

Hospital admissions better indicator. admissions hit certain threshold, leaders administer appropriate restrictions.  one ready go. called saline solution. safe. 

I rapid test kit too. fast. 0.05 seconds. called Nickel.

You want efficacy accuracy ? got wait till next presidency. almost 100k tests, still around 1% concerning Russian vaccine? *destroyed lives thousands ruined businesses causing mass income inequality furthering gap poor wealthy take decades repair. 

Not worth it. matters. happen data collection completed? Due situation, vaccines could approved using preliminary data trials continue. got ;D learn spend summer inside?

Just, stay away groups No, Obama Dems along. /s Sure rest world looks US media.

Went restaurant day without apparent guidelines followed... later learned owners simply paid fines, profit margin allowed it.

A competent governmental response would increase fines point simply eating cost business longer possible, instituting severe penalties habitual offenders (pulling business/liquor licenses, imprisoning managers owners, etc). AFAIK lockdowns definitely expected toward colder months. beee faaaaiiiirrrr Worth pointing vitamin amounts decrease naturally get older. 

There correlations vitamin levels ability survive COVID-19, easily skewed natural variations COVID-19 age increased risk elderly. 

Not saying there’s causality here, important always recognise correlation often one side penny think he's beyond that. entire stream consciousness never ending serious lies fairrrrrrrrrrrrrr Placebos indeed interesting Unless law mandates certain intentions behind marriage (unlikely), perfectly legal.

Plus Canada Child Benefit pays untaxable basic income parents (based gross income). ranges $100 $600 per child something like that. family ok last year get $400 month two kids (hey covers daycare least) sister gets $1,200/month two kids. hard, worth it.

People go festival victims terms believing leaders willfully stupid ignorant idiots getting serious contagious virus is. Either way lot people going get hurt happen. point though becomes less following outside viewpoints expand world view get echo chamber instead giving credence dumbass flat false ideals.

It's like idea giving flat Earth anti-vax people equal air time, ""alternative viewpoint"". ""round earth echo chamber"", live reality. dunno... kid crying last night rubbed tears shampoo eyes kept crying more. effective all. NC public education didn’t prepare either things actually wanted drop completely saw post history realized illustrated exactly trying say.

You seem fairly socialist left leaning people. **I American**, live country. thread relates article international community 'baffled' going country. left yet immediately responding used emotional language inferred anger.

You made post titled *The vast majority people either complete morons mentally ill due way modern societies shape us*.

You made another comment *Right, ~~lying unprincipled sack shit.~~ conservative.*

**Clearly** think highly anyone country opposed worldview. Well guess what? **Neither people oppose worldview**. country divided point neither sides communicate effectively includes **you** well right.

I see part problem advocating basic human empathy country lacks spades, evidently preparing buy firearms upcoming civil kind crazy town?

Clearly people going find way talking navigate this. Oh shit guess I’m wrong. thought flu mutate quickly, immunity wears Yes, this. prove need stay closed here. (private school follows alongside county policies) teacher relieved MDPS announced push back October 14th opening. husband’s state health lab, running covid testing doesn’t feel comfortable sending two girls back even date. sucks much already, told: open hell going lead many wanting send kids back they’re going go back themselves. ready little hot boxes transfer covid along blindly vulnerable.

This bad news. complete lie upvotes lol. People sub **wish** covid-19 would last forever. it’s case. good chance long term disability internal organ damage though. Viruses tend weaken time. days later hanging response? 

Sorry left open way ignore responsibility completely. supposed point lack response hour replied you?

You ought able defend claims make. think liar someone who's apathetic beliefs reasoning spread? sarcastic, I'm worried all. risk dying covid minimal. Even 70+ year olds 5.4% infectious fatality rate according CDC. Also good luck waiting vaccine get back life. Might years.  America, everything bigger better. Even free falling collapse relevant world influence. We're gonna lose fast head spin. Yes, there's effective treatment vaccine. matching human control group, really learning anything. Monkeys humans, uncontrolled study useless. that's ethical concerns really come play. infecting people may vaccinated ineffective vaccine, infecting people vaccinated placebo. Eventually, someone die possibly would've never infected all, killed directly due actions researchers. data easily obtained normal Phase 3 trial without ethical concerns. Even starting five six traditional Phase 3 trials predicted completed. I'm sure wealthy, incorruptible human rights South Africa testing reporting honestly state fine theres always people screwing others.

..... lol Lol. People acting like he's going use military keep power force. loses, contest election (legally) due diligence ensure monkey business mail ballots. done fairly regularly US elections close. Remember Florida hanging chads? I’ve 84 countries. you? think world expected Americans somehow smarter rest population planet. turns out, easily hoodwinked predatory politics rest us. UK Australia going rabbit hole. Good luck 🇬🇧 got friend. someone lived US six years (not anymore), heartbreaking. seen promise US. “god’s plan” took office, immigrant ass started panicking moved country. still follow US news politics closely home country country currently reside. wish best US, greatest country world. great uncle panicked hard dead. :/ Damn TV! /s  get license bufu. someone buffoonish Trump would taken power Ancient Rome, would put sword. joke. handled problems like this. boat full people...the boat fire...40% people want put fire out...30 percent chained around fire protect denying exists even asses burn...30% think sides blame think burdon carry anyway sit ot out.

Everyone dies God..... really hope part thinks believe it’s satire.... They’re told continue wearing masks social distancing. already told that. Herd immunity usually achieved vaccine.  understand people talking herd immunity without vaccine.  Covid19 like 50% common colds, except deadlier.

How often cold life?  Feeling like herd immunity?

We hope vaccine cov19 there's money made it.  Colds rate billions needed vaccine research usually annoyance, need eradicating like measles polio. Agreed, we’re bad. Sir you’re going need tone suggestive language, it’s 8AM. Well guess gonna hear want hear. would daycare safer alternative? Still large groups children adult workers I’m worried much safety, besides trying support getting takeout Thank you, apologise snapping you. patience frustration bubbling alot shitshow soldiers on. good excuse I'm sorry.

 wrong thing do. fact adapted well new environment great. 

I'm best hold till spring. looks likely thats things may start moving back normal, least give us clearer idea timetable it. think 2000 Election lot days.... imagine we’d gone way? they’d let Florida entire recount close? Shit. great time something like ranked choice voting him. crisis conscience vote. needs viable candidates. vote someone like one fascist monster would cause downfall democracy allowed win. Still less risky trump pisswater injection. Wish employable skills. I’m English teacher. Lol. lost ancestors' farming skills, can’t even that. need read article. It’s clear choice full knowledge give consent.

On side vaccines trials maybe Chinese government early reasons believe safe? example, Moderna vaccine could theoretically stored work. restaurant.

None freezers come close -94. *my* county WA state (east Cascades), sheriff would probably recalled enforcing mask mandate, wasn’t. ELISA NAb assay, recorded values few-fold lower GMTs convalescent plasma panel; actually cite say comparator method J Virol review self-inoculation anyone pushing back vaccine response lower end plasma range, seems quite cute bet would done vaccine responses higher. Sorry, nobody stockholm waits red lights crossing. live Teachers make low mid 40's US Dollars. 5% goes pension fund state.

In USA live Victoria Australia, die Covid-19 (not necessarily Covid-19) death added Covid-19 death toll. actually matter killed you, long tested positive died added Covid-19 death toll.

Is flu always counted? Remind people giving fuck Pope thinks now? ran fearmongering material 'person gets infected 10 quintillion times' articles?  said educate they've successful. that. I'm sorry understand conservation. get it. going STEAL ELECTION. happening right front face can't even see it. 

Wake fuck up. Oof way avoid it, like general health guidelines people followed something. Thanks sharing. didnt know that. course makes sense looking Qantas sees business.   *You'll get sick winning!*

Narrator: *They did.* probably need 200 group (vaccinated control). Give enough Covid exposure approximately 50% control group gets sick. Wait 1 month preliminary outcomes. fake NYT quote health officials Oregon, Minnesota, Chicago... zero mention riots spreading event?

There’s reason don’t allow comments anymore, it’s children spreading this. Im confused saying country second waves yet. really looks like Spain France have, looking worldometer graphs. UK 🤔 hundreds still die every year. First off, that's strategy. Second, surely reinfections like could bad news waiting vaccine well? That's covid.  That's complete botched incompetent response covid causing lot that. fact idiots allowed go maskless doorknob licking parties every weekend prolonging much beyond ever country facing part it. many Good people dying absolutely stupid response us morons hide houses avoid people months can.

That's what's taking toll. together. us trying fix it, morons charge response. I've done 16 weeks home schooling daughter. ideal quite satisfactory.
Plus entire state 14 active cases.
Compared 750.. 8 weeks ago Bc see past one two mistakes they've provided many great products world??............... Ok.........

I'm saying screw ups big deal, are, we're going judge companies solely failures, good company exists. Name one infect track record monumentally successful. Go ahead.... Lockdowns attempt regain control poor governance.

How bad defines many need infected die considered 'too much'. Evidently france 16000 new cases days worth government incompetence. cities hospitals overwhelmed? Cities shut temporary field hospitals made never actually ended needing them. heard hospitals city getting close capacity, never heard entire city overrunning capacity unless NYC back big spike. live one cities hardest hit first spike back April (Detroit). cases per population around NYC had. temporary field hospital shut never ended needing it.

My source [Johns looked biggest Western European countries case fatality rates higher US. didn’t look every single country since I’m work it’s little slow. contradict it.

Y’all world getting “back normal” (whatever frack means anyway) test balloons. What's bullshit LONG headlines?

They're avoiding uptick, good them. Let's leave stay hopeful carry way.  people followed guidelines instead actively protesting need another lockdown.

Anyone desperate hold onto way life people agree DEMOCRACY support vote someone corrupt influence foreign money, need reevaluate moral compass. Gains attained illegal means lasting allowed stand.

The disdain many people feel toward shove narrow, unpopular worldview throats others cause demand recall EVERY single action taken illegitimate, corrupt leader. history comes see administration result coup foreign, authoritarian influences, provide rationale needed push undoing it. 

Moreover factions trusted large scale again. freedoms civil liberties guaranteed constitution re-asserted. So, period produce lasting gains achieved illegitimately. Sadly, great deal death, destruction, pain anguish sides happen. must make shadowy foreign overlords happy. much longer, India's gonna overtake US within maybe month  faked? vaccines tested around world trials haven’t completed yet. admit nurture, nature?

You're flake, way. There's always recall vote. Jes sayin compare death capita US behind Belgium ; France, Italy, Sweden Spain behind. Remove New York fiasco (1 6 deaths) equation numbers bad.

in general decision made virus balancing cost benefit - far fortunately covid seem existential threat seemed beginning Lmao answer perfect God hate fact we’ve less 1,000 deaths end lockdown life going back normal. wish country cared us enough let 203,000 (and counting) people die reason Inspired post, little digging works (Finland). Apparently long one parents grandparents born Finland apply residence permit, questions asked. 

One thing people probably know pretty common Finnish immigrants say Sweden instead, since Finns considered inferior race 1940s. get US first travel Sweden anyway, passport proper stamps, assuming anyone happened care. people ""Swedish"" grandparents might actually partially Finnish instead... homemade cloth face coverings, however, show fabric releases large amount fibers air, underscoring importance washing them

Wash clothes wear, got it. What're you, mom. personally re-enactment 1933. Without hope liberation 12 years time. think ima go antivax first couple new vaccines know much disbelief one day glanced mom's facebook feed filled brim evil things godless liberals doing. heart breaks you! another field go change would offer less stress even stress? know I’m considering change. would mean huge drop pay, least would sane hours. 

I hope journey takes healthier, happier life! Take care safe!!! ❤️ True, enough cause psychological damage risk health others. forgot leave shit sub Americans say tuna fish instead tuna? himself? There's better chance live events returning US (already Midwest/South), countries supposedly ""handling covid better"".

You really think Australia New Zealand live events 2024? need get guns like yesterday. number makes sense realize five cities make half population. you, news covers guys ourselves. Also Chik Fil good it’ll probably eat again. I'm practicing, young dentist good amount savings. dream become Canadian since highschool; still flag wall 🍁💕 main issue think dental degree easily transfers :(

I Maine weekend. could see Canada. unreal able cross happy dance (my dumb little ""I'm happy Canada"" dance) 😔 mention concept fake news. Anything scared fake news liberal hoax, pandemic scary fuck. ability dismiss news really allowed people ignore going Covid. case, anyone finds out, going jail know happens there. Dude parents believe shit it’s weird. think he’s anti christ they’re excited revelations prophecy occur can’t zoinked heaven lmaooo don’t think anyone see primarily reason don’t sign gmail watching YouTube. history pigeon holes echo chamber can’t escape like similar types videos I’m self aware enough realize opposite ends every spectrum. Yin yang etc etc YouTube doesn’t show “thinks” wanna see certain videos echo chamber. 

Even turning history feature still haven’t gotten YouTube correct recommendations. pisses end watch one skateboard video that’s cool (while interest skateboarding whatsoever) main feed Rodney Mullen Tony hawk “SICK 5 minutes INSANE skateboarding”

It’s become cancer society. great’ simply enough,” added.

Offered without comment. Sounds super illegal. Dude- there's reason people skeptical. goal post kept moving months gone by. initial reason shutdown need shut hospitals overloaded- hospitals empty, started moving goalpost-we need stay shut testing-we need wear masks-- hey numbers daily infections tanked, still need stay shut down- oh can't reopen vaccine - oh trust vaccine- need keep wearing masks social distancing - going away- get used wearing masks new normal- literally saying flu season coming keep wearing masks social distancing. elect doctors run country. Doctors covering ass, course every recommendation keep social distancing wearing masks stay shut down- politician wants reopen everything back start easing mask mandates. one wants come back vote them. doctors never going recommend getting rid masks ok get back normal. game plan normal ok . Why? Democracy decline US unilateral authority. Right wing authoritarians ethnonationalists everywhere. multipolar world might actually allow nations across global south uplift imperialist subjugation.

This reads nauseating, American exceptionalist, self-bloviation That’s actually really kind thing offer. Good helping less fortunate escape nightmare country I'm unemployed pandemic need money. Nope need tradies people build houses. Reddit.com i'm not. executive-level project manager aerospace company chiming in. supply chains fucked. nobody buying shit salaries gutted avoid layoffs. tariffs lackluster executive support pandemic due political grandstanding good things, know. hey, piss-ant existence surely litmus test americans, adjust accordingly. think industry return US sooner say, Canada Australia sooner?

Because countries locked even harder. Consider going Groupon booking massage therapy appointment. think touch vocal conversation important psychological health, massage therapy combines relaxation (great tense shoulders painful lower back/neck). really isn’t pricy think.  death rate America like fucking .03%. Literally everything fine retarded antifa burning shit reason. article stupid fuck. mention like half deaths literally nothing Corona. wasn’t election year “pandemic” would everything would open again. Everything ruled money there's little room common decency. Anything decent viewed socialism anti American. bullshit. like shady cabal powerful elite. democratically elected president, support vast part population.

Being adult democracy means all, collectively, brought shit upon yourselves. feel sorry them.

They're reaping fruits decades labour. Trump got elected one day, corrupt system allows whatever build decades. idiots voted taught decades.

I admit could predicted myself, hindsight really easy tell they're sitting throne accomplishments. Insight insult. feel sorry countries deal extreme lockdowns basically imprisoned weeks end shitty govt facilities guise health safety.

Yes there's cost freedom, lots people US aware costs choose pay freedoms. Sorry country can't open ours. What's price? Yeah, again, drastic measure may cause bit distress immediate future needed taken reeled back time preserve well-being population. know certain, I'd imagine government implemented programs given alternatives parents/guardians kids subside quarentine. case? it, place uneventful lately. /s Yeah first he’d sexually assault her, he’s kind guy positive shortly. fair, big mother fucking emus. wouldn't. much?

America hates me. hell trying live trans person. want live somewhere I'm hated, equal, fully participate society, sure children safe, cohesive community, full anger fear despair, billionaires set things fire, life pawn political game. know that's asking lot. Many people live circumstances worse. want America dreamed growing live real, place becoming tolerant seemed full possibility. thought America Bush lowest point, Trump appeared. I’m wondering divided nation repaired? know see extremes news, still, huge issues. saw guy motorized shopping cart Costco wearing Trump mask lol. true, feels bad  defeat communism? long ago that? curious. believe higher covid rates lower income communities near attributed people likely work essential/multiple jobs (no WFH), live people closer quarters, possibly less informed due things like language barriers education signed 3 shots day pseudonyms. start getting shakes go 4h injections. 

Funny see anti-vaxers accuse company unethical.  sort controversial. Meanwhile, Mike Bradley probably wishing never gave interview NYT. imagine inbox pretty much fucked foreseeable future. 2020 - year stupid became weapon mass destruction.  I'll tell various problems discussed:

First off, straight ethics, even got round pretty quick. (Normally challenge trials conducted least decent treatment)

Second all, there's significant problems ""dosage"" virus. need know much realistic exposure; little nobody gets infected; much looks like even good vaccines work.

Third all, setting takes much time may spend tons money even get anything approved earlier. please fast-track Minnesotans? Dude already like way there, culturally geographically. know Trump handled coronavirus stupid way, also quite difficult force people things still vote you. America full idiots hate they're told.... Unless husbands. butt stuff. sad bc us trapped bc failed education system. country take unless valuable skills. able work fast food job valuable skill... There's left wing America, dude. There's far right nationalist party center right neoliberal party. Even Bernie Sanders would center left best Europe.

Stop chugging fox flavoraid. ...and multiply exponentially. week since new cases peaked. privy miracle cure, I'm sure rest people would like know is. Anyone get tested MI time. Bully proof windows, troll safe doors Please help us. I'm funny ... Please... Help Problem US summarized - there's cockroach kitchen cabinet. Half household raging mad cockroach.

Wait. Got news report show BLM murdered them? I’m guessing mean illegitimate; profit school, regionally accredited accredited all, pulling shady shit behind scenes. ton people got conned continue conned outfits like that. *“But think, think would be, think would very, very, think we'd very, solid, would continue we're doing, we'd solidify we've done, things plate want get done”*

-Bleachy Donny he’d re-elected

And you’re piece garbage trying vilify Biden’s speech impediment, he’s made multiple amazing speeches, idiot’s dementia getting worse worse need peaceful divorce point. Red blue American can’t coexist 1 government anymore. put asbestos it? Exactly. changes needed. Especially seem hellbent destroying whatever jungles left, releasing god knows kind zoonotic disease next. experience graduated college 2009. job market decimated. didn’t find work 2010 part time.

It’s gonna suck, you’ll get it.  incredibly rich, perfect time return guess ~300 years pretty common lifespan large states. America probably exception guy bought new house believe. However, houses buy basically free many towns. lot older people died, leave old houses around next generation basically keep falling down, areas 1/4 houses unoccupied. Japan went big real estate boom 80s prolonged bust.

Friends parents bought house around $1 million equivalent 1985 worth less $50k today. isnt uncommon, Japan shrinking zoning codes make easy straightforward build compared almost developed nation. Scarily, change 2016 saying support critical thinking skills, also added paragraph that, saying support teacher's right teach information proven false, true, conspiracy theories. Im disgusted disappointed country. don’t even want coexist anti-science states anymore. We're position Benjamin Franklin feared come fruition: apathy.

When Constitution signed, woman street asked ""Mr. Franklin, kind government given us?"" ""A Republic, keep it"", replied.

Both Franklin Jefferson foresaw challenges republic - people could become apathetic responsibilities keep representatives line; corruption, bribery, undue influence could win elections. even watched Trump talk? He's monotone gets mixed words time. 40 million people facing eviction. Fact. population California 39.8 million. Wrap around head tell everything fine. *“But think, think would be, think would very, very, think we'd very, solid, would continue we're doing, we'd solidify we've done, things plate want get done”*

-Bleachy Donny he’d re-elected country fake split France Netherlands. That’s  Since previous comment auto-removed political:

This point exactly. point commenter seems emigrants US allowed mistreated refugees US. point people fleeing US likely anti-refugee, favor elected person would such. Yes, think Biden would better would actually take advice experts employs would trying enact preventative measures national level, least spread awareness issue. problem Trump ego big good. ignore experts favor own, clueless opinions. due part 77 cases reported fish processing warehouse coast.

The warehouse within walking distance one main grocery stores area, town 5000 people.

Combine fact seeing cases reported around world simply handling frozen food, hot spot going catalyst many infections.

Please bleach wipe everything bring house, wash hands, diligent proper handling cooking raw food products. America burns China takes over. thought America oppressive surprise. bet China concered. neither actually. Come Norway. brown cheese, fjords, (mostly) boring politics interesting, back used 4chan kid, always imagined kid posting among adults. couple years ago looked 4chan again, incredibly obvious mostly children posting there. even top 10.

Top 10? I'm sure would even make paper, let alone front page. Possibly ""Help Wanted"" section? Yeah I’m sure they’re laughing Myanmar Cameroon. No, things Americans get hung debating minutiae (politics, religion, gun control, healthcare, etc.) sometimes comical comparison way countries handle them. Genuinely feel majority, put what's going also international media hype it. Free??..What money used pay procedures? certainly got pa iui something. government make money..a genie bottle? Share secrets😂 hear many people talking bubbles like that's reason someone disagree wrong. 

They never consider might bubble themselves. 

Like Trump voter ever voted bubble, anti Trump might bubble too. studies research report contact tracing new cases link settings people likely infected? Interested better determine risks. Belgium/Europe especially would interesting. Especially interested risk in-door dining controlled settings (proper hygienic mask settings, dining people inside allowed contacts, ...).

Something like ""For Country X, contact tracing estimates/determines 50% new cases come non-controlled social events parties, 25% indoor family settings, 5% restaurants, ..."" etc. said probably false too. number infected probably going way higher turn IFR lower currently have. 

The largest control group Sweden seems fine, least worse EU countries. big data. people forget that. Companies collected information created personality profiles us. Anybody think weird certain personalities seem prone believing bullshit. 

Did people think Facebook information sold could sell Pepsi? play lot games people different countries. Part ""guild"" 2k people around world. Yes. world laughing us. worse worried us Lol thats worse Reagan actor. Keep going back further. consider reddit social media. forum. many similarities things like facebook instagram, time, nothing like sites.

That said reddit becoming like traditional social medias profile pics weird emoji/awards. Learn code knew possibility risk factor still launched product. It’s babies children ffs... love podcast! They've released Youtube extra graphics well. yet somehow....all people willing literally trafficked country, scrub toilets pick oranges..... confirm, baffled. Again, teachers show symptoms, students mostly stay asymptomatic spread disease teachers parents. perfect attack vector virus, everyone thinks good idea continue person schooling. Youre making metaphor even retarded already love penguins. saw baby last visit. Technically Tasmania, I’m sure visit beaches too. admit especially love tuataras though, really enjoyed genome sequenced. They’re bizarre creatures. Also kudos computer science gang figured make much, much easier run genomes. first scientists managed human genome 20 years ago blow mind much effort went recording DNA. Seemed like impossible task anyway, setting genetic disorder diagnosis fascination genetics.  mean white supremacists dirty cops trying make look bad Caesar like competent politician/general roman history. Comparing trump caesar would major compliment trump. 

Also Caesar progressive populist Trump reactionary conservative. Polar opposites. Trump much Sulla Caesar. Protector old ways true romans rather beacon liberalized empire. state literally force keep life support regardless DNR/DNI.

I'm tempted write *This fascism* but… even worse. abuse power rooted 'Christian' delusion, basically living Y'all Qaeda ISIS. know, remember reading early 1900s, wanted basic right, one listed. asked, slapped firm no, peaceful protests, still no. started burning shit down, finally got attention.
And woman, right vote. thanks suffragettes.

We citizens country afraid encounter police fear dying traffic stop, afraid walking street, now.. afraid asleep fucking beds home.

If you’re angry people wanting basic human rights, you’re paying attention. Fascist. Yeah half half, like tenth rest. OK CCP reddit. rest world , especially China, fine.

That's dip emergency food funds. That's 100 million + homeless.

Canada fucking disaster losing 25% small business thus far many closing up.

We street riots think minorities killed police here? LMFAO.

This site gone pure CCP shit. getting sloppy bad. Pick CCP. didn’t mean insult. I’m sorry let affect like that. Regulating internet...that's big word much explanation would go would look like. would love see sources claims ""foreigners."" Thank kind redditor! truth America master propaganda, far Soviets ever were. achieves entertainment-industrial complex, presenting world noble country, people.

The reality truth entirety country lives backwards state without fully realizing lot. Individuality prized suffering, corporate dogma worshipped, even political class comprised entertainers, showmen frivolity. Shopping glorified, billionaires deified, worth individual reduced bag coins little else. corollary history might ancient Romans, replacing colosseum Hollywood peasants dot streets makeshift tents, eager catch glimpse every spectacle distract plight.

Such nation without true form social cohesion cooperation would therefore require massive military apparatus police force prevent collapsing, lest social unrest tear apart within invaders attempt exploit weakness. US experiencing beginnings unraveling unrest grips cities, steady drip propaganda longer able placate it.

They've tested 24,000 people Turkey, Indonesia Brazil hopefully passes third round testing safe use. i'm boat smart well behaived come place, people speak 3 languages, including english. Thought local language quite hard learn. Came this. mean lots idiot Trumpsters still say administration almost completely dropped reelection press. RIP boi Albanus Tunisian. still subset population likely take precautions coronavirus. They're likely older, sedentary, know they're greater risk may likely take greater precautions. young people area give much single fuck virus. would assume subset would different subset tested here. 

Not would deny real percentage overall population still likely low, good representation entire population. know, thought so, fiancé could get job mental working immediately struggling get work there. Atm they’re relying artwork commissions rather getting paid functional projects. sure why. cousin US makes ton $$$ traveling welder. hey one aunts electrician, hadn’t really considered much directly functional science.

Racists like called racist. Gaw, g'wan. I'd sandwich town day week. Syria win! Man would love evangellicals go heaven. Worth get hair. need sorry. ourselves. hope Oxford Vaccine. (as layman) thought adenovirus vector vaccine would safest, potentially effective bunch, gut punch hear multiple cases transverse myelitis...There much corruption around Moderna project. hope vaccine shows positive results bit right now...  start zombie shit think point Mexico would gladly pay tombstone long certain people went head first. even stupidity - confirmation bias lowering distress cognitive dissonance makes us feel good, intelligent validated know lot idiot engineers IRL explain really rudimentary scientific concepts to...

But gets amount people claiming medical professionals internet pushing *political* perspective virus would overtly reject scientific debate even dispute science ranting political conspiracy zero data back up. 

I one supposedly cardiologist telling virus ""flu"" posed threat ""healthy"" people. expressed dismay supposed doctor saying things like this, continued tell *he* could assure hospitals claiming people died ""COVID"" make money.

The guy told he's two colleagues die sad totally normal virus infected with. underlying conditions said. Like normal concerned co-workers dropping dead around ""underlying conditions"".

I hope political ""doctors"" either trolls vocal minority. people I've seeing internet horrifying. fucking mother thinks that. cannot read sarcasm Well gents, seems like net neutrality actually died facebook came about. reality bad stuff happened 4 years ago. oompaloompa took stage. Haha, Aussie married US citizen went hell immigration app get US permanent residency (still pending). everyday like, babe SURE wanna live lol. used see us decades, even decade might stretch. lost hope means get discouraged seeing playing out...

On side note, know land NZ expensive compared here! beautiful there... definitely list possible places end up. 2.8K active cases city India. friends playing football long time really want play (same group 8-10 people). think safe?

As always problem algorithm, human behavior. sue responsible. ""president"" regards bringing manufacturing back US, actually see possibility within ""near"" future. work production finance semi large manufacturing company things keep developing do, restrictions higher labor costs make China less favorable production.
That could make way opening production US low-income jobs. Manufacturing US means less language barriers many raw materials able supplied locally. Plus less import/export issues easier getting money US China. bad people think is. strange me. idea people believe life bad. feel sorry them. *Capitalism breeds Innovation* Yet another election choice douche bag turd sandwich thank people use 6% talking point assuring juvenile diabetic husband can't die Covid. yet see replies random insults things like ""Sheeple!""

Misinformation spreads like virus Internet least citizens critical thinkers generally well-informed resistant it. 

I used think Internet solution misinformation (""everything fingertips!"") learnt past years called access means nothing without discerning critically-thinking populace. feel sorry us too. 

In fun news, read young kids Finland taught early primary school analyze media, think critically, &amp; fact check. Maybe someday line thinking make way here. feel creeped watched feel like comment reaching part algorithm  It’s funny doesn’t feel like we’ve felled virus even though statistically seems have. Haven’t heard anything overrun hospitals like months ago. huge reason behind quarantining. Lolwat 
 
The USA developing country. People bankrupted stranger called ambulance them. people would much rather live basically country. Especially current demagogues charge. fuck wrong using stratrgic food reserves? That's like shitting prepers using stored food disasters forget death negative consequence someone covid might experience. enough lingering health issues many ""recovered"" term it: long haulers. heard report today scientists looking severe cases seem hyperactive autoimmune reaction body's immune system stays path, quality life going suck.

Herd immunity Covid would really suck lot people survived initial infection. still data end result infections good sign asymptomatics found severe lung heart issues infections. parts body, like reproductive system? That’s every president   Thank God don’t live there. less sunny places, blacks worst affected vitamin defficiency. farmers normal levels even black. Go check bad blacks Europe USA doing. wife black take it. Speculation likely multitude issues. first issue disease, second natural disasters like earthquakes floods. Last least, massive migration many cultures came Middle East. came, brought different styles warfare nobody prepared for. people managed fend invaders Egyptians. That’s managed survive damn long. 

I’d look video, it’s like one hour clip contains lot info you’ll forget pretty quick. full shit. bookkeeper would know loans ever need paid back. companies took money immediately returned worried public backlash. that's *only* reason returned money. could kept it, would never pay back. sure angle bullshit. still believe myth? US promoted terrorism, example created Al Qaida. imposed dictatorships throughout world name capitalism. ally Saudi Arabia monarchy, currently committing genocide Yemen. Israel apartheid state.

The US harm good. Origin life would nice know That's already likely going happen current numbers. got around 1000 deaths per day nearly 100 days left. Opening likely make worse. much would cost t-cell study probably asston right ? feel sorry well. Please mention it. still cavemen.  frontline workers case outbreak interactive essay showed mask effectiveness percentage population wearing dropped transmission shred proof

How couple hundred shreds?

[womp womp](http://wwe.reddit.com/r/coronavirusvirus) Yeah pretty obvious someone snow boots. I’m American not-so-distant cousins Norway. longest stay 6 months. Please help. hate country. DNC prefer Bernie Sanders, still got richer. south africa worst hit south putting yogurt swallowing it? Or, using thicker drink like soda? Also, many military forgotten admin coast guard long ago. Refresher: left unpaid long enough donated food feed them. isnt sufficient evidences rule origin yet I'm pretty sure giving free money. likely contract fee paid passes trials. perfect GPA work organic chemistry research lab R1 university. like school, don’t know it’s safe stay 2 years. intend go Canada grad school never look back. Seems like path countries take get there.

Ever thought emigrating? prospect watching gives severe anxiety. :| truly worth it? :/ Thanks advance bet lot people said going leave trump elected regretting lack courage right now.  fall US fall Rome, bronze age collapse global crop failures start climate change exacerbated coming US civil war. Thing opposing views aren’t interesting people don’t care either bored tears madder hell. It’s like genre music hate someone telling listen it’s good exposed it. 

In end, dirty people likely die least lead majority outcomes country. knows many years take? eventually shit settles age continues whittle GOP think country polling majority happy policy fourth. it’s going ugly. Probably civil war ugly assuredly Americans die silly attacks stuff. It’s awful. seems realistic. reality tunnel certified fresh 43.5 cases/100,000 population average last two weeks presented Danish authorities. know Swedish numbers calculated way.

ECDC numbers 98 Denmark 36 Sweden difference 2.7 phone number call time describe symptoms. phone call evaluate suspected covid. 

To sure tell go hospital test tell hospital coming everything prepare you. 

This number also doubt health. call, evaluate condition need seen doctor make appointment call ambulance go location. advice need, trained professionals give answers/recommendation need. dollar every one ""things actually improving"" posts since march needed stimulus check. remember around may everyone thought pandemic ackshyually would second wave? remember. enough circumstantial evidence indicate came lab Wuhan definitive proof.

There circumstantial evidence came lab.  Haha well put. really become number big care about. I'm sorry butt seems many applicants less negative towards butt stuff. Endless profit seeking power drivers things, internet social media medium time. get ViSA US instead? bad worse one. liberate country nukes?

More likely US turn new NK, hope send nuke, mostly ignore you. grandma ovarian cancer 67 something. baby 46 years. Still get grandpa sign forms Medicare. *one* ovary. Even gyno thought stupid. fair apart japan, others much smaller countries like 5 mil people most, shit Ah, US way! feel sorry you

I dont think all.

Just like meme, usa living rent free ins europoors head. left vague reason. need even try guess would be. People would likely change ways quickly. Unfortunately, COVID like airborne pathogens circulation pretend is, face high mortality rates (relative airborne illnesses) long-term health problems. Lifting restrictions prevent spread virus likely worse impact economy. Plus lots dead people, us actually care about. people never felt guilty spreading diseases may kill people

Who's making threats? never said going to. I'd also infected able to. can't tell, isolation standpoint, extremely unlikely ever ever get infected.

I provided example showed consideration people care another example someone don't. **YOU** made claim ""people never felt guilty"".

Are exhibiting mental condition appear mentioned posts? threats. mental illness schizophrenia?

Ah, mention mental health. Might make suggestion avoid/ignore things exacerbate condition? Maybe browse puppy/kitten pictures instead what's going real world.

I know support numbers likely subs deal people looking support highly suggest so. reason obvious, almost everyone would potentially die covid already dead Africa. Underrated comment IMHO major second wave NYC unlikely current immunity combined current rules social distancing, mask wearing, white collar workers staying home schools hybrid mode. Denmark, Finland Norway locked Q1. hard understand? Reddit embodies echo chambers much jealous sure, Sydney+Melbourne make 40% population. Add state capitals, 67% accounted for. Good news - harming relations many countries make easier gut military spending end destructive foreign policy: hard go war without allies. failed second, question, that's unfortunate shit simply happens.

This incredibly disturbing way looking showcases messed Swedens view vulnerable people are.

In countriew one highest death rates world something gets dismissed ""shit happends"" Americans voted actually voted *against him*.

He used shitty mechanism government, place ""protect"" smaller states larger states. reality, diminishes voting power large swathes country, increases voting power small parts. Seriously, feel sorry China Usually take 2-3 weeks vaccine actually reach peak antibodies production people rush party getting shot could catch covid. fooling us. COVID bad, although seasonal, still spread kill summer. There's evidence flu continues spread somewhat - asymptomatically - summer.

But winter might worse. There's evidence Australia Argentina supports this. Closer decline Moran Empire. 1 person complicit people party literally made America great. mean still great people America, countless innocent people there. I'm still holding onto hope.

Good people America, reading this, hang remain good. Words live Lack obesity helps So, he's volunteering poor people guinea pigs slightly tested vaccine rushed market. sound generous, sounds sinister feel good story spin put it. live Britain. I'm position gloat. US President essentially admitted ready perform electoral fraud, prompting base commit electoral fraud, using cronies make electoral fraud easier.

And, top.of that, admitted accepting peaceful transfer power loses.

If ""gets elected"" again, *very* good chance *didnt actually get elected*. Can’t seek asylum life threatened? attitude supporting senicide/eugenics ask ""Sweden critics"" sub ;) 


^((I agree point)) Accepting applications. Texas already 20k excess deaths FYI, it'll likely somewhere like 25-30k dead one year COVID19. Note, we're 6 months in. Puts tinfoil hat: Trump seeding name pop culture US entire life. every popular form entertainment mentions name symbol wealth success. Fresh Prince Bel Air, Home Alone 2, Sopranos twice, Simpsons, etc. surprised often hear name. Ha-ha-ha-ha stayin' alive... Oh please tell consensus countries, given people definitively page regarding pandemic.

Sweden know they're doing, seem know better most. Unlike many countries, necessarily neighbors, we've consistent strategy beginning. goal overload essential healthcare services limit spread among vulnerable groups. failed second, question, that's unfortunate shit simply happens.

Besides, Sweden used cudgel COVID-19 debate, going poorly lockdown fanatics show (as here) celebrate, going well anti-lockdown fanatics show celebrate. Live let live, death part it. Ohhhhh got it. scene mouth closed up? ""What good phone call unable speak"" Wasn’t everyone shitting China’s “bad” response sub February? Go peace friend Australia, borders open up. you’ve got education you’ll get fairly easily. watch wildlife...nah kidding Monetization strategies problem. unregulated business like always running roughshod anything, everything along way profit. vaguely say think removed society wish cooperate society.

So imprisonment wearing masks, trying real hard dystopia guess. view US deteriorated significantly past 4 years. become clear country racist, bigotry rife, questionable ""democracy"" politicians bought, poverty see developing countries. ""The land free"" sounds hollow mantra Americans use without even believing in. Glad service, enjoy feeling utter superiority. Internet definite net positive. social media? I'm sure anymore. fun first came scene find benefits may brought far outweighed negatives. I'm torn thinking AZ shady transverse myelitis incidents, another trump move try give American companies edge rivals Honestly I'm right you. used panicked thought student loans huge expenses, kind realized thing; point big number really stress about. I've spent years living super frugal thanks childhood trauma penniless. past months, I've finally allowing treat despite fact probably worried frugality ever. realize spent doubt best years life allowing fun fear destitute later. figure I'm gonna dead next 5-10 years anyways war disease environmental collapse whatever else, truck try embrace little things go Proving point perfectly Sorry see Mom like this.  
It's truly baffling; people used like respect suddenly following crap, though slowly lobotomized 6 month period TeamTrump vs world/science/logic. Christians often health nuts, newly conservative/racist. 

 
I'm Canada, people anti-mask/anti-covid mixed dizzying ramblings 'Trump 2020' Trump-centric comments. vote US politicians here, course. Ask they're talking Trump start praising him.  


Maybe fear-response Covid? idea we're kinda helpless without instant solution could driving people seek saviour sorts? reason humans clung religions ages.  


Of course science followed basics - wearing mask, distancing - while, we'd mostly fine vaccine available, seem enough segment population. Anyone thinks heaven eternity good thing, really pondered *eternity*.

Being heaven eternity, would indistinguishable hell. Honestly? don't. USA ruined world many times greed, arrogance, stupidity carelessness. time going get taste medicine. whole point bring end times raptured

Only generic christians, sinful christian satanists (very sinful christians) scoped that.

Even though they're 11% population, christians commit 50% planet wide genocides, practice xenocide... imaginations. Oh vile, soo vile. Im sorry skin utterly thin. Bye now. I'll vaguely say think removed society wish cooperate society.

HA! Oh again, hypocrisy shines bright.

I provide link(s) laid claim making reports even asking commentor removed ""stasi"" quote (though 2 days later changed ""superheros"").

You dole reports frequently see people beaten reporting yours.

So using report button far less, say regard ""abuse""?

I even report comment (yet least, we'll see). hope causes take step back examine themselves

I would suggest too. Read back vile rhetoric saying thread. need help wont even patience/energy reddit and/or absorp blurt.

So okay downplay issues probably read hate filled messages ? Studies?

Forget that. Gimme hookworm NOW! COVID-19 immunity come! I'm sure pretty much articles stop November 3rd video explains I’m convinced half accounts respond Twitter bots. There’s way people replying real..... Take u/DarwonkaIsTrans's comment 'the morons used torture me..now i've realized dumber suffer.'

In view could almost comment either side political spectrum. state mind sides seem have. 

I disagree u/DarwonkaIsTrans's comment advocates apathetic approach problem discourse. I'm saying problem true discourse happening anymore. comment ignores fact what's happening US greater implications everyone solely right. can't sit back let 'the morons' want laugh.

That meant comment. Maybe team wonder someone group finally make sense large population vibes on. 2020 people still fucking clue nation goes zero great great ground. Lemmingsology number cases consistently declined since recommendations set place. Suggesting work high death toll due factors, like Sweden much greater number infected Nordic countries acted. agree let protest seen lots reports claiming havent spread protests suggests events like safe  much extensive damage done orangutan-in-chief, doubt biden able undo much sure that? ones know they're bs-ing, hope causes take step back examine themselves. need help wont even patience/energy reddit and/or absorp blurt. spoke immunologist recently learned different kinds immunity. wondering concern anti bodies, cells able retain immunological memory. 

Basically, best kind immunity mediated neutralising antibodies. blood, infection would stopped tracks. pathogens long lasting anti bodies would considered immune. 

In many cases tho, antibodies disappear time, leaving cell memory. cell immunity useful, trigger production antibodies detect presence pathogen. However, body takes time produce antibodies, time become infected contagious. infection would probably shorter lived less severe, still infect others. 

The issue cell senescence. Basically die part ageing process. Meaning old vulnerable people would lose cell immunity, people would still able infect them. rUsSiAn HaCkErS wife could divorce take two American refugee-spouses. list hot non-crazy ones? Butt stuff required. least give least feel guilty infect though. least that

So making threats me, classy. also highlighted point perfectly. think protect others yet woukd feel guilt killing random qualms social interaction, I'm certainly it

That's sad state affairs feel need even one person life, pretty lonely existence ask died (yet?) real human interaction.

Another threat?

Not dead would lying said mental health lowest ever far. I've gone 6 months without seeing family, stuck nothing working home sleeping. Sometimes wonder continue. that's left life what's point living anymore. real easy face-to-face interaction. could even go zero human interaction without issues.

Also: **It Happen Here**. podcast came March 2019. Ad terrifying accurate 2020 comparison.

As Canadian (Me, podcaster American), hardly believe what's happening there. people realize admit nothing happens vacuum. If/when guys dive civil war, affect alone. Yet, nobody around seems take seriously. whole world change, neighbours, drastically hit. insane amount everyday supplies come US, primarily food.

Everyone likes say ""At least we're America"".

But lot ways are, anyone realizes. suffer hard US goes belly way podcast predicts. God accurate year, surface barely scratched.

Your govt really butt-stuffing you. be? saying 43.5 cases, almost 3x would make Sweden 14. Thats good news Density misleading. 90% continent desert. Check Spain, France, Argentina, India, UK, etc. massive spikes past couple weeks. Many countries (eg. France, Spain) higher cases counts per day March April. France registered 16,000 new cases yesterday. Argentina 13,000 yesterday. India 85,000. Etc. UK hit daily new cases spring peak.

[France find rest here: ""I feel sorry American"" election propaganda get real hard sell. USA already country cared far businesses rich people getting richer trump, it’s crazy much worse made it?!

Employment law EU protects employee expense company. Whereas USA rights, virtually holiday countless people lost jobs received $1200 last 7 months!
In European countries governments paying topping wages staff don’t lose jobs end all.

Trump gave money rich companies covid would cost everyone receive proper unemployment free healthcare.

But don’t worry America, top 1% richer covid that’s great hey? That's totally fair. 
 
When I'm browsing far right, like redpill, think interesting see heirarchies language comparing insular communities.

No, sOcIaLiSt states like California Canadian family making comparisons America's decline fall Roman Empire since well Trump elected, might give idea bad looks us 


It's obvious public education healthcare systems job supposed valid point. ask anyone evidence Biden slobbering mess, will, without fail, always link selectively edited montages youtube. look actual speeches selectively edited from, find full speeches proving opposite. 

But point. thought dumb Person make false claim Biden, person B responded refuting, person C nonsensically took refutation praise. Interior western US. mean Florida doesn’t reputation smartest people. Trump another 4 years office, erode what's left American democracy nothingness.

I totally feel that... without individual cause revolution American society, would several generations kind evolution would begin. kind needed something outrageous spark upset country direct brink collapse order snuff shenanigans. Without individual values winning playing fair, normal citizen would never realize degree chess crooks/politicians playing. No, never have, give shot.

This anecdotal easy imagine slightly relaxed behavior across population (still within recommendations) could increase rate infection lot. Holy smokes Ontario bars stripe clubs open right now? thought Canada smarter states can't rich Guinea pigs? works well safe, means give poor. completely agree. example alma mater made news recently huge outbreaks Greek housing. actually talked students said school started testing _everybody_ (which great btw). Many students tested positive idea even infected due lack symptoms. Aka whole system broken toilet pandemic making easier see shit seeping through. oke rich people got gold plated heated toilets good! /s think one biggest factors testing.

In one area 50,000 people virus know yet. almost testing whatever reason. people find ones sick show doctor hospital. Statistically means 5,000 people go hospital 350 die. testing, media reports 5,000 cases 350 deaths fatality rate 7%.

In another area 50,000 people widespread testing. testing finds 20,000 people, 5,000 go hospital 350 die. media reports 20,000 cases, 4 times many place, hospitalization rate 25% fatality rate 1.8%. far better place still pretty high.

But missed 30,000 people virus never got tested. actual hospitalization rate 10% actual fatality rate 0.65%. never knew able test everyone.

This think basic problem leads wildly different numbers reported different places. Cool. try responding someone else needs tried serious crimes ever real democracy again. wildly irresponsible different false positive/false negative profiles.

No, absolutely feel humiliated infuriated world views America today. Things bad *Burmese* people feel pity Americans. fall grace. propaganda right here.

Ignorance, failed public education system aimed preparing people workforce instead teaching critical thinking skills led many problems face today... voting guy.... PrAiSe hErR CuOmO!!11!! rate movies going right now, screams top 10 film next year. People looking V Day, vaccine made widely available think that’ll good enough majority. 

People aren’t going wait around people vaccinated “I’m going wait see side effects are”. vaccine accessible, it’ll individual vaccinate (and I’m sure colleges businesses require it) Well think virus well understood conclusions people drawing based extremely tiny amount evidence likely completely incorrect.

They eventually figured approximately 20% world's population got ""Swine Flu"" H1N1 virus. see reason virus less prevalent fact probably since seems perfect qualities maximum contagion.

But actually good news every case know probably 10, 20, 30 even know about. means lot contagious lot less deadly. 20x people thought 20x less deadly.

This guess think wind up. find one contagious viruses world ever seen average fatality. time passes virus humans adapt eventually become ""just another virus"".  binary way thinking things. Florida could easily swallow another 6 months reasonable practices slow spread. Also could use influence important battleground state ensure another stimulus package passed. Younger Americans vote nearly level older Americans do, many refuse compromise full blown revolution. Protests mean shit refuse exercise political power constructive way. Younger folks blameless. Ahhh, stand much corrected, thanks pointing detail. Seems like odd population base anything on... frequent medical setting given needs care yet said, different risk profile anyone else.  die?

Image load, link original story? it’s insane Maybe get cool arm too! Honestly, man, America's bigger threat people even China. I'm sad them, yet. That’s good know. thought FDA kinda pushover lately  elect man unfit lead every single measure consequences really feel ya. Good luck safe. Key word: Approved.

Salk tested polio vaccine 161 kids Jan 1953. less year he'd rolled 1.6 million children. 

And 67 years ago. 

At point human history could species dump planet level resources R&amp;D process using 1,000s scientists around globe produce vaccine way right now. 

To say ""Human History"" meaning absurd.

The first human discover Viruses 1892. first time someone even figured could inoculate disease 1796.  lean towards ""right"" side spectrum. hated trump since 2016. past year made hate more. He's also sense ruined life. They’re downvoting truth Fascinating around. cases, delta see daily reporting, short lived antibodies easy testing spread.

Look forward full read tonight, thanks! also data July - actually caught 1 10 cases. sound right, given serological studies found undercount range. 

We've probably improved testing since then, catching higher proportion total cases, would expect undercount still probably 7-8. Somewhere 50 60 million? Anyone except get vaccine first. I'll eventually get need first one. proves protests responsible outbreaks. were, Portland would US' hotspot months ago. feel sorry too. someone give award here, feel better?  plan start beginning already concern this. 
Just congress people retarded enough proved pumped market.

Great Job !!
I feel bad all! Cuz plan meant beginning. Bond villains really exist real life. group get vaccine basically tiny subset ""general population"". know rates even oddball conditions general population exist - that's much stable point reference actual placebo group. pro butt-stuff, that's like US Yet, unfortunately, Lmaooo comment made laugh!!! really doesn’t. don’t know history you’re going assert that. accelerate decelerate ongoing trends. wear mask drive thru Exactly - anecdotally, person know who's dialysis also person know done absolutely nothing non-essential since February. even grocery store. 

She goes dialysis twice week, that's literally outing. husband thing does, son drops groceries (outside, contact).

Obviously, expect hold true everyone, I'd expect balance lower infection risk. know what's really humiliating? people think everything would fine different set self-serving, corrupt assholes power instead current set. whole concept political power country controlled duopoly needs go... 

Anyone else sick tired holding nose voting lesser two evils every 4 years??? know 2019 US ranked *48th* freedom press?

That last year. 500+ acts violence committed clearly identified members press.

We’ve never utopia. Far it, new. Comparing cases state pointless. According worldometers NY 487,000 cases. ny 500k cases 33k deaths N.C. 200k cases 3k deaths? Yeah pretty sure case counts inaccurate.  Yes, that’s trials work vaccines. Patience, get one works soon multiple, faith smart humans political agenda besides saving human lives, good people. got brother/sister. makes think virus around? look case number death number? absolutely time low. wouldn’t open economy back up? call call it? Ron Paul went hospital today probably heart attack listening son speak. crazy! *always* go auto dealership blow past Mercs, BMWs, Toyotas Fords run straight new Greely back lot, broke rolling truck.

Nothing screams ""QUALITY!"" like ""Made China""!

:D Sorry man (or woman). live area lots people social distancing, feel like Florida special kind rough right now. Good luck ============= j=====
H llo anyonf there? Entanglement last long. sending message back time

We thovght minor. Butttt childre changef. see years. became deranged. Hunger human flesh. Fiftefn years now.

You make treatment CARRIER LOST &lt;&lt;&lt; entire Bay Area could red tier next week. counties reopen everything Nobody would go target Corona. dumb comparison America really needs stop pretending version capitalism good people. New York suggests either people scared amazingly good despite improbability all, small group spread actually really major thing compared public spaces indeed get enough infection rate within people commingle socially work reduce ease passing around again.

My bet little those. ""Ezekiel 25:17. path righteous man beset sides iniquities selfish tyranny evil men...."" Source? understanding, practically every surveillance system tracks suspected, probable, confirmed cases separately. one confirmed case, specific case definition dependent mix lab (rtPCR), epidemiologic (contact infected cases), clinical (signs symptoms) data; case definition less same, least high-income countries.  mean, we're long beyond essential workers. still working yet still employed? would think few. I've going work since end May library. Fortunately(?) transferred help curbside laid many necessary people, sucked regular department. closed public meant basically microfilm/database retrieval, book perusing (turned scanning), research would normally wanted people themselves.

I think might better different jobs normal even aware changes suck. new job, resentment baggage expectations.  hopeful fall subsequent waves due accumulated immunity 6 years till vaccine. crazy made getting government assistance like trying get limited edition Yeezys Supreme merch instead of, idk, based actual need. skipping lot bad stuff you? 😅
I like particular type appeal. kid cat exactly  It’s nuanced issue Ahh okay, see. here, cell mattress 72 hrs (a drunk tank 4 walls mattress), transferred prison custody trial prison. no, never prison, drunk tank :)

So 1-2 years, like ""the big house""? Interesting, sounds scary hell, US prisons :(

Any idea COVID situation prison vs jail? I'm guessing jail traffic = infected people coming yea? Or? past three weeks, won’t trend continue? don’t think new restrictions would effect then. mean baby die. mother would almost certainly want child born. bad example ***circus theme heard background*** Ask special ed teacher tips handling this? current teacher isn’t experienced, ask talk someone classroom experience. may suggest changes environment, use conditioning. classroom, set limits enforce positive way. Expect slip ups continue positive enforcement. Still early year, hopefully school developed training parents. Good luck! worldwide numbers Corona double 8 months

AND there's obviously less deaths counted covid really are, especially start know exactly world shut reduce spread thus amount deaths pandemic would cause. FAR worse common flu. sheriffs Wisconsin too. N.C. 32 50 deaths. N.C. well compared states. I’m sure Cooper do. main reason living paycheck pay check goto work sick hell can't afford skip day. Poor people get paid time USA. live like money matters co workers. Sick workers goto work make ends meet infect coworkers. Even job offers paid time state requires long enough cover covid infection. 

The poor forced infect one loose home apartment.

Infecting coworkers sounds awful loosing house sounds worse people. 


The upper class salary option working home get paid time vacation days afford get sick. poor exposed general population, increasing risk exposure face face jobs benifits easily replaced sick = loosing job. 

Capitalism set deal back bone work force absent 2-3 weeks recover.

Source: poor person who's gone work flu bc shift manager would fire take one 5 unpaid sick days get year. Right....... ""no death"" tiresome please, no!! can’t take 4 years madness. Hard no. looks like he's gained ton weight. Anybody read history book. takes someone common sense truly understand history trying teach. Nazi use star identify discriminate unwanted people based race/religion. suggest identify people danger public. knowingly HIV still go unprotected sex without disclosing, think going jail? 

Your comparison joke. also get another dong kids ? literally wouldn’t answer reporters question regarding peaceful transition. pivoted said question better suited Democrats. 

We’re strange time, sold notion bad turmoil gonna fix bring manufacturing back America. He’s pro fossil fuels anti renewable energy it’s sickening. Now, bunch ignorant people well versed Bill rights constitution even scientists constitutional scholars can’t prove wrong. It’s literally bad fiction novel. term “hiccups road” makes zero sense. Yeah, that's he's saying. Key word ""approved"". Well right things... surely pull ahead end... right? Get ready. going huge clusterfuck India, US's stupidity last dwarfed news another country's tragedy. Unlike US, see control this. want BS create thought bias

It's BS...it's science. Kahneman writes way human brain works ways fool others fool us. 

 But, mind flimflamed brain manipulated people greater understanding human brain works, that's certainly choice. you? United Nations meeting, officials expressed concerns seafarers forced work will. trust J&amp;J though? Ok. Nutjob. Ya, undercount makes total sense me.

I'm medical settings fairly often adherence masks obviously quite near perfect. Sure, risk groups stay home entirely yes, positive people absolutely seems quite lower anyone working retail hospital / medical center also positive people walking around know / care.

Social / family interactions could add higher risk tone suggested holds there. Someone going regularly clearly risk everyone around consider seeing dad ""who little old"" far selective. reason build pod too. lot people saying sensible things (doctors, immunocompromised, etc. get first), actually brilliant political logic pope's argument. moment powerful wealthy immune disease moment stop caring (if think care before...).

Vaccinating poor last might mean never vaccinating poor. Don’t forget 18.7% oklahomans voted Joe Exotic Governor 😳  Poor people lack money survive also substantially higher risk. also happen higher risk. That's early statistic, FYI, testing ramped up. closer 1/5. Things like make people shake fist ""capitalism"", that's capitalism, corruption. Back square one repay loans then. math point. Lets even talk 70x make sense.

I'll agree 14 times worse conclusions wrong. 

I'll give parallel example using logic. CT power ball lottery 14x better odds costs little Florida lottery. Therefore play CT lottery.... bro odds low states going win lottery. waisted money. 

That's like covid, odds low states. One state ruined economy profiting outcome, dead. think expectation become less deadly (as in, mutate literally less deadly), acquired immunity early life make functionally less deadly. 

So basically, endemic, everyone gets child. remain completely immune forever, immune system retains enough memory virus future infections mild (common cold). Every time get infected, immune system would reminded, people would ever die it. 

This seems make sense, especially since OC-43, coronavirus question, known [high mortality (~8%) right circumstances. may really dumb question, looking [charts like past thirty minutes still understand mask wearer talking potential COVID carrier likely catch COVID COVID carrier wearing mask talking person without mask. Could someone help explain that? Probably protestors Portland. fair press pretty good job undermining absolutely idea talking about. Don’t embarrass yourself. close Walmart get job one try start union?

And much local businesses pay get people this? Yeah it’s ethical dilemma. way around would good idk probably legal nightmare watched videos law enforcement, beating people social distancing. take seriously. one person friend, mother, son daughter, would saying thing? Let guess. believe everyone bunch firearms buy gold silver “impeding economic collapse” result “evil fed”, “international bankers”. believe college useless. everyone go technical school. victors always write history. Women must want give birth babies men fight death defending them. vaccines secretly harming infecting everyone, including giving kids autism. Illuminati new world order run everything. 

Well, least it’s pretty obvious believe many crazy things. So? people straight hardcore believe anti-mask, what's wrong registry? suggest get COVID, wont get treatment. go ER gunshot wound, sure. people, never catch COVID anyways, what's problem? happen every time major federal loan/grant kicks in? Every dollar get gravy them. Every dollar 99% gets good they'll see lion share return investment. Interesting, thanks compilation. Seems like need brush H1N1; realize extensive.  Ah yes, groups people nuked environment continue horde wealth.

China always played quick blame everyone else game. anyone trying teach kids read home, let highly recommend Bloomfield’s book *Let’s Read*, 1960s [more recent stories bit dated mid-20th-century-American perspective gender roles etc., apart it’s best way teach reading seen.

Bloomfield one top expert linguists world, developed teaching kids. first 150 lessons book use regular spellings, sound word completely predictable. lesson focuses one new sound spelling, one new thing learn time, there’s lot less confusion typical basic reader. solid foundation, gets kid several thousand words, irregular spellings introduced, words time. sentences stories great job mixing previously learned words occasionally (cf.

My just-turned-4-year-old 1 lesson per day (each takes 10–15 minutes) past ~8 months, almost book (245 lessons total) gone knowing alphabet reading typical second grade level, still continuing rapidly improve. basically independently read anything limit attention span point, took little fuss pain.

Some early lessons take bit struggle they’re within limits typical kids’ focus/attention (if occasional lesson gets frustrating, stop come back another day); depending kid I’d say start anywhere age 3 7 years old. vast majority 5 year olds able handle without much trouble, adult support. can’t. one take them. world around officially blocked “greatest country earth”. Well done, America. Agreed.

Sort Doctors **love** patients evangelize learned reading something WebMD. Overturn Electoral college. corrupt.  votes win. somebody living Japan. hard time fully believing this. Despite constant criticism Japan isn’t testing enough, positive test rate still around 4%.

The plausible explanation think based Reddit post read weeks implied heavy mask usage inoculating effect, keeping viral load low enough body develop antibodies. spokesman confidently declares ""not impossible"" sun emerge around 7am tomorrow mysteriously drops horizon evening. Losers please leave, productive members society really don’t want you. offered solid place new country (with either job least money hold could find job) would heartbeat. haven’t “proud American” years year shown truly disgusting country be, many okay it. realize assholes everywhere, least move somewhere government doesn’t actually hate citizens Well fuckin shit Good thing already got like seven cans cabinet sucka strictly looking dialysis patients. idea come conclusion office answer here.

The rest seems great.  may fine stored warmer -94F, time test certify that, stuck proven otherwise. 

The thing could fine 70F, gets testing can't it. one still hold 2 illnesses.  Im taking statistics, please. realistic state word. 40% Americans willing support racist corrupted leader world right now.

1.0k case growth NY full lockdown, even Florida full lockdown today, may still peak 50-100K cases day.

1.9k next Thursday, 20k?

Did ever determine 2 people illnesses tens thousands got vaccine placebo? Voz aura? irony that's old people ruined everything.

They vote most.

They ruined environment.

They ruined economy.

They wear masks least.

Of course young people working jobs require people-to-people contact, still find way blame corona.

Most people helped defeat fascism died. you.

Most people helped reach moon going grain. you. internet problem tbh. reinforces stupid makes stupid people stupid. Canada 148,000 cases. NC really bad compared rest western world. Sorry...  Well, Colorado Springs seen several, one says squat it. Even lady saw one. stores also. think Best Buy. 

Someone robbed auto repair shop Powers killed employee. Shortly lady employee auto repair shop nearby started carrying.

People Colorado Springs serious 2nd Amendment. Personally, feel safest place right next law abiding citizen carrying. still alive see someone carrying, figure everything going OK. openly carry want hurt someone; carry want protect themselves, likely protect also, although dude nose hanging Costco seem care others.

It seems like anti-maskers 2nd Amendment folks highly/excessively individualistic; reason seem go together. need +55 website. get paid extra let stuff butts?  say ""percentage"" Trump lowest approval ratings president history.

News flash: majority Americans hate him. Well said! thoughts exactly. try go outside lot, almost never near group people am, wear mask. almost never go indoors either, unless get groceries, I'm remote location. Canada isn’t Indiana. *rubs hands together*

Mashed avocado, lime juice, sea salt, pinch ground cumin. 

If want kick up, add diced jalapeños dice red onion (wash diced onions want soften kick onions have). go overboard miss lime juice. 

If want add rounded flavors, mix diced tomatoes salsa. Maybe little cilantro.  Well, gonna feel lot sorry millions scrambling whatever border get months... Dude entire sub covid death fan page. want Long Island Ice Tea Covid Vaccines Lol. I’m Old too, alas. Hey man, nobody's perfect. make mistakes, never stop growing people. try little bit better today yesterday.

Don't beat hard past mistakes. done can't undone. learn mistakes keep moving forward. feel sorry rest world deal decision bunch stupid Americans made. Researchers said muscle soreness fatigue reported 36 percent individuals age 65 taken vaccine. higher number younger individuals, 64 percent, reported similar side effects.

Interesting. perhaps suggestive weaker immune response older individuals? I'd love get visa UK. still early hoping something like 70%. 98% would incredible great news. Fun fact!  That’s keep hold back stash eat first couple days. Great news! need some.  types (premillenial dispensationalist Evangelicals, specifically) generally think they're going Raptured sky goes down. pure selfishness really. mean like God sending signs choose ignore them. news, usual. better treatment.

Some better capacity provide care.

Some decreased intensity illness due mask utilization.

Some increase identification lighter cases testing capacity improves.

For non-profit work (where work now), you’ll likely get rural TX hourly rate mentioned almost inevitably medical insurance, 401k plan, etc.

That said, think argument defense American Exceptionalism reliant upon defending outcomes, rather process, ideology. 

Most things tend toward uniformity, usually (but always) pursuit best form, biological, societal other. Often see consensus around best practices. also often see stagnation, good suppresses emergence great lack diversity methods stalls innovation. America less built idea change good leadership dangerous.

Many good people working together steadily best across board creates really nice society. Europe good example many want emulate that. diversity, risk, sacrifice difference leads breakthroughs advances. Controlled chaos. 

I think people understood AE much political philosophy much expression American culture, would make sense. Americans tend like, defend, differences always better, product system emphasizes individual freedom, matter stupid individuals may be. 

I think helps explain Covid response. Americans 100% agree science oppose mask mandates simply like idea government kind authority. And, end, Americans probably higher tolerance sacrifice. part chaos choice. Moreover, Americans really people committed like many nationalities. (theoretically) committed idea shared governance.

Anytime lockdown brings first wave, open going create second wave (unless extremely strong public health response). yet many average Americans vote Republican detriment.

When maskless, armed AR-15 protesters arrive? test, cases *taps head*

There’s weekly update released every Monday. complete. personally aware nearby high school athletic teams quarantine schools state list. Florida messed up.

Florida never bothered restrict driving, even 251,970 injuries 3,004 dead, every single year.

Florida also restricted fatty foods cigarettes, even lost 51,000 people dead, every single year factors..

What's worse, nobody Florida seems these, statistics outlining preventable viral based deaths..  least, enough much them.

WTF Florida?

You'd think would learn... Glad live there. Florida 50% COVID deaths Canada. That's absolute numbers. Per capita, 250% more.

Fucking mind blowing. ""say cashless society""

Hope none idiots visit Sweden 98% cashless point 100% sguer 2023 (I think). well said. Insightful, dead money. Congress President lack authority issue lockdown. there's new administration, could issue guidelines recommendations states, could tie Federal funds guidelines, Federal funds tied specific, related, large coercive. try best distance take pandemic seriously understand new evidence comes adjust strategy I've lost faith experts recently. Like BLM protests supported medical community media despite completely going distancing requirements scolding everyone months. Winter coming.  Yes, *are* studies suggesting doses much higher current guidelines may beneficial. suggest Redditors independently experiment that. Current guidelines state 800 IU per day. CDC likelihood survival age is:

0-19 years: 99.997%

20-49 years: 99.98%

50-69 years: 99.5%

70+ years: 94.6%

Clearly death rates population primarily driven number people 70+. US 11% population.

In African countries bet much smaller fraction. would also guess African countries jam elderly together crowded facilities months die, probably protects well. American standard. No, follow standard. Get yourself.  twins???? I'm middle Canada (no Ontario) spend way time outside winter summer.  Snowmobiling best thing world even it's-30c. COVID bad, although seasonal, still spread kill summer.

you get almost vitamin D3 sun traces food animal sources, like salmon shit like that

plants vitamin D2 usually found supplements too, lot less helpful comes ""vitamin levels"" since blood test looks residue vitamin D3 blood

Among rich countries, UK US definitely worst - shouldn’t big surprise anyone. One consider talking doctor. True headed woman made vaccines past. also adapted vaccine largely development already rushed/built ground least.

I'll happy safe effective vaccine though point. 6 months felt like years. laid dream job overall, miserable point. life set perfectly prior this.

It’s actually indirect light getting eyes helps. eyes closed hitting bare skin, wouldn’t shit actually. again, there’s UV. bright, full spectrum light tells brain it’s bright time wake get ready bright sunny day. helps maintain normal circadian rhythm mornings darker days dimmer. helps maintain normal levels melatonin serotonin. 

It’s especially helpful people get winter months it’s still dark, drive work it’s still dark, spend day cubicle unnatural fluorescent lighting weak ambient sunlight, often obscured clouds, drive home it’s dark. Using light box either first 30 minutes wake first 30 minutes desk work mitigate lack light. 

Actually, wrote research proposal this. argument spending bright, full spectrum light rods fit traditional fluorescent slots could mitigate depression boost employee productivity year round, especially winter. major limitation unsure distance would issue. argued that, unlike light box, whole office lit luminous full spectrum lighting might work distance due greater number light sources.

Pfizer looks good too, little weary Astrazeneca transverse myelitis popping trials Thanks reply.  I've read recently really high amount people actually fever. 9/11 way measure disease. 90% 9/11 deaths people nursing homes preexisting conditions likely die within next year anyway. experienced pain vitamin daily... Alcohol usage hand... Man China: Farts.

Western media:

*Out-of-control methane leak discovered China* dead body. Actually CDC quietly updated count 200k 9,210 late august. 9k arent even technically COD virus never isolated pure form, approved test evidence causal relation bw non-existent virus &amp; symptom death (nor could theyve done zero case-control studies necessary begin evaluate causality cant ever possibly case-control study w non-existent virus). 

Worldwide 2% less deaths compared previous years. yes, far less flu. 1. two countries hit first respond properly either, also entirely different social adherence guidelines, population density, healthcare systems, political leanings. fair comparison, like say Denmark, Finland, etc. Regardless, compared overall EU, Sweden still double average rate. Spain operating complete nonsense still, even using drugs proven dangerous ineffective first line therapy (my original background pharmacist, know drugs/therapies field becoming bioinformatics scientist advising CDC, developing pipelines used tracking viral/microbial strains, publishing numerous epidemiological methods used COVID). comparing one country following mainstream scientific/medical guidelines another really prove point.
2. ""During half-time"" ok spout nonsense. ""swedes"" ""a well known epidemiologist"" mean anything - whoever actually is, I'm also well known scientist agree ACTUALLY CORRECT. like 99% scientists/epidemiologists suggested opposite correct, science based approach let novel virus run rampant country mutate killing people. Appealing authority, especially someone like me, work medicine. need evidence claims.
3. ""if going half-assed lockdown even bother it? bounced back soon restrictions lifted. IFR isn’t high all. "" - yeah, point, need full lockdown properly control reopening slowly. always strategy mainstream medicine/epidemiology going back centuries epidemics/pandemics, employed successfully around globe disease countries properly. IFR considerably high, actually. Again, background seems lacking seem seeking rare fringe scientist may said something agrees you, instead overwhelming consensus belief system.
4. ""Pro-lockdown"" means trying control virus know to. want us shut PROPERLY 6-8 weeks, entirely restricting activity truly getting rates low enough, opening back mask/distancing mandates clearly people selfish childish that... mean, am, someone actually knows he's talking about, arguing someone blatant facts. childish millions others trying argue experts justify opinion. fucking stop. People ""believing"" Sweden's approach fucking matter. People thought would work back March countless scientists spoke publicy it, proven work - still people like thinking work somehow. Misinformation powerful easy people jump whatever conclusion want rather actually listen experts. fucking sad dealing second virus stupidity. also recommended take K Magnesium vitamin doctors. also seems commonly accepted r/nootropics. take 5,000iu day 180mcg K2 (MK-7).

The form Magnesium also important. common Magnesium citrate oxide bioavailable. prefer Magnesium Glycinate. Theronate supposedly good though too. Covid disease may rapidly deplete Vitamin levels.

source? afraid may confusing cause consequence, immune get infected/have worse symptoms SARS 1 infected around 8000 killed around 800 people world. similar story MERS, bird flu, many deadly, rare, viruses. likely disease kill seriously injure percentage people contract suffer effects, also likelihood contracting disease. massive spread virus means considered scarier SARS 1, BTW also disproportionately killed people older underlying health conditions killed 0 children. Also many survivors SARS 1 lingering health issues, due fewer cases far smaller number people suffered long COVID.

And lower impact SARS 1? less transmissible could spread people showing symptoms, also people took seriously. US beautiful everything here.

Why would even want leave? Nah man, world busy dealing *actual* refugees guys created, family there. think 1 every 200 people dying many since ones dying 1 foot grave anyway.

But I'll give something positive think about. Herd immunity 67%. need careful 1/3 community fine. second good. think alot people need one winter depression. adjusted population deaths would 80k, still bad. deaths control many came LTC homes new cases mostly younger. cases continue rising matter time LTC homes hit again. already couple outbreaks them. death rate younger people 0, potential long term harms. That's title. 

This piece asserts ""population heterogeneity affects herd immunity"".  I'm understanding correctly, idea people mingle become resistant number immune people needed herd immunity goes down. Possibly 40%. 

I believe Sweden yet 40%. Sure, human milk created humans all. Cow milk hand isn't. think distraction cannot put effective pcr facilities. Cross reactive cells protective, tests actually help nothing controlling pandemic.

Btw think mass testing cell immunity outside studies feasible technically. March 2019 sample likely contamination. one hit one sample mysteriously disappeared, subsequent detection virus earlier Nov 2019 anywhere world.

Nearly everything else cite ""Q3 2019"" really late December 2019, still Wuhan.

The exception Brazil testing Nov 2019 persisted later samples likely actual early initial infection. consistent origin virus October–November 2019 Wuhan (from bats) currently accepted [COVID-19 officially considered emerged Huanan seafood wholesale market (HSWM) Wuhan December 2019. However, epidemiological data show early cases COVID-19 related HSWM thus site emergence (11–15). Phylogenetic studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 might circulated Wuhan early October 2019 virus spread low-level person person (the latency phase), imported HSWM detected December 2019 also someone infected Wuhan November may traveled Brazil created small cluster cases persisted importation pandemic March. evidence origination virus outside Note mean origin mother strain possibly China, means could anywhere. bet somewhere Central Europe East Asia.

You're talking ass making shit up. Apt description. Federation American Scientists:

Also... don’t baby powder sell? Thank response. That's comforting hear makes sense. daily routine thrown something like happened 100+ years. conditioned handle type drastic change.

Now think it, anxiety started felt anxious waking weekend nothing do. pandemic, always busy something. Now, much.

I hope gets better.

Thanks again! Nice see countries favoritism choose promising there. plan taking vitamin D, please eat something oily like nuts else vitamin won’t work. also take fish oil tablets along vitamin D, also works. hundreds South Korea. 1 million dead 10 months. said true, numbers true too. understand putting quotes around something means, right? middle school? would make sense. Damn, beat it. Take upvote. man, brutal little state 16k deaths alone. say young. said younger. 4000-5000 IU per day family since March. yes, primary care doctor says that's fine. think I’d rather read soccer story minimum, least helping get vitamins need! comparison, Trump's death toll 200,000 Well sure sound like do. “Johnson Johnson, wonderful place work” many millions lives want ruin consider lockdowns bad Deaths lag positive tests. want indicator death rate, look many tested positive 2-3 weeks ago. average, people die 2 weeks testing positive. die quickly. struggle weeks succumbing. nukes. Nukes make wars great powers unwinnable. Would nice work no, don't. Sorry, wrong. talking particular trial/study, multitude studies observational administered calcidol/vitamin patients ICU. 
Chris Masterjohn, PhD nice job parsing ton info come last months: saying cure, proper + Vitamin levels demonstrated effective lowering ICU risk. think people curious level herd immunity required return life without restrictions. eliminate new cases combo level immunity + level restrictions, soon restrictions relaxed cases would start increase again. we’re currently seeing relaxation restrictions areas reasonably high levels population immunity. Example, NYC estimated 22% population immunity. Canada letting anyone in, US. Even countries better US allowed enter. nothing US politics. keeping virus out. know. Trump reelected Amy Coney Barrett elected supreme court manages mandates religious views throughout American judicial system,the US could shit show biblical proportions, refugees could result that.

So what's solution ask? cruel tailspin ""social media shaming"" plagues society top actual virus? done horrible anger poured people author desperately cries???

Simple: PUT MASK 15 MINUTES STORE MOVE ON. think works J&amp;J... That's one sided article. I'm taking time counter every point I'll comment first point article. time Rush called virus common cold, Trump banned Chinese nationals January 31 one month later Feb 21 Nancy Peloci still telling people China Town afraid continue normal. beginning Nancy taken opposite view point president. president wants open Nancy wants stay closed.

Many mild cases due low viral load infection. kinds cases scientists believe lead mild symptoms also weak immune reaction. feel mild cases may therefore carry weakest immunity reinfection may still risk there. officials shut either protests.


And anti-lockdown protests going month half Memorial Day. people packing beaches.



Were anti lockdown protesters upset protests get locked down? upset police national guard used forcibly break send home? arrest them? think US less “continuous political identity” Rome? What’s supposed refer to, specifically? give examples? That’s pretty broad nondescript. keep holding point, aren’t actually backing elaborating, counter it, say different way.

If it’s system governance you’re referring to, changed, monarchy, republic, dictators thrown in, ruled emperors (sometimes 2), assassinations power grabs occurred, Praetorians auctioned position bit, fought seized, that’s history early 200’s CE - including external threats civil wars. It’s like transitions peaceful. blood streets times, literally. I’m absolutely making light current issues suffering going through, we’re political enemies strangled, heads removed posted Rostra, bodies tossed Gemonian Stairs left rot 3 days plain public view hooked thrown Tiber. Domitian reportedly dressed like woman get city barricading Palatine uncle (who didn’t make it, killed manner described above, I’m mistaken). father finally made back Rome, ended emperor ended year chaos civil war.

If it’s “Roman-ness” you’re talking about, could entire thesis easily defined. could ask group historians they’d give multiple answers. Byzantines considered Roman long time, though I’m camp disagrees. That’s likely I’m biased early empire fan.

As much there’s lot unrest turmoil recently, stable continuation transfer power remained US. Hopefully continues Nov-Jan, even doesn’t, that’s one event - Rome many. that’s literally talking start: Rome didn’t clear act succession, US always has. That’s extremely important thing have. seem falling common trap, romanticizing letting many centuries us change perspective. It’s something truly remind sometimes. place called “Rome” many, many centuries, mean stable, retained identity (which hard thing define first place).

You also still really acknowledging points, offering vague statements. Example: Senate; tossed there, claimed they’d existed “1000 years”, didn’t bring aging countered. assume - given responses point - that’s wrongly called someone actually studied topic hand.

Despite attempt mansplain field study me, I’ve enjoy talking Rome. Try get bothered “lol” next time, yea? It’s 2020; it’s used end short comments time, doesn’t necessarily mean someone laughing YOU. (which, I’d like note, genuinely wasn’t), learn laugh - it’s really liberating. anxiety really helpful started that. aside, hope stay safe this. won’t argue aren’t scary uncertain times, are. Even stupid ruthless dictators wanna grandchildren see garden wall bunker. think that's true either. They've several cancer vaccines, none made past stage 3 trials. Even outside 24/7, still enough people. also need take magnesium got infected May, recovered, got late August. tested 4 times make sure actually *does* virus reinfected, positive 4 times. means infected twice. Nice ignorance. Damn makes sense now. Started taking care way better past couple weeks also started taking daily dose vitamines. Took one morning empty stomach half hour later felt awful. Never taking one empty stomach anymore. Bars open since beginning may. Bars forced close 10, bar seating allowed. Restaurants bars operating reduced capacity. 

The statewide metrics k-12 schools pretty strict, week changed allows many districts open long case count per 100,000 stays 30 (among metrics).

Speaking anecdotally, Memorial Day weekend saw state plates RV's driving around I've seen one time summer. smoke/fires came reducing testing numbers. little week Memorial Day/fires went 10-15 counties reporting cases every day, almost 25-30 counties per day. 

Smoke cleared week, testing centers opened lo behold cases spiked. guess heavy Memorial Day spread mixed colleges reopening across state. 

The smoke masked problem. fortunate bit done since July bring cases still effect, see runaway cases outside university setting. going excuse

easy, hoax.

a floridiot posted facebook today numbers fake people actually dying something else.

they **never** believe coronavirus even 10,000,000 die It’s vitamin hormone. professions named paid well proportion value society. Either way, live knowing 40% population supports him. horrible. Yeah, I’m western Washington lot people unhappy sheriff. Eastern Washington basically another state lol Meh..ymmv. take vitamin supplement never upset tummy. again, take multi vitamin totally upset tummy, take vitamin that's need (been taking years levels always low without it) Trump said day now, year minimum. 250 mcg (***micro***grams) D3 Nice dog whistle Yes. gall claiming finally brought us respect... countries preparing start vaccination start 2021 best case. get antibodies infected idiot also thought could sit sauna use heat kill virus lungs.

And sample size small around NW IA, small towns, worn lot different hats. Never lucky enough move civilization, aka one larger cities. 

Also, gay dude...there's question...leave backward regressive area. procedures they’re using come where.... lol Yeah it’s clear second waves (or return increasing case numbers don’t want use term) don’t necessarily happen immediately reopening could instead take several months emerge. time though seemed reasonable think would. retarded conspiracy theory talking about?

Vitamins sold EVERYWHERE, otc DIRT CHEAP. Shots cheap.

Do want government injecting things not? I'm confused logic people. ignore everything everyone want, cos best. Go America Connor!? indoor activities? downvoted saying someone doom gloom Whoops. kind worked, still fixed Nothing study suggests supplementing vitamin anything. Correlating serum levels vitamin outcomes infection confounded many issues. many studies found correlations low vitamin levels negative outcome find later observation can't validated prospective study supplements provided improvement outcome?

Regardless dad dying, bar not, make difference - simply sheltering place. traveled put people risk asked knew could potentially kill people offered remorse.

You saying wanted go beach simultaneously saying stayed condo whole time different things. 

You study psychology can't identify cognitive dissonance. \*taps temple\* end first wave never second wave. “a never ending serious lies”

Is “serious” collective noun lies? like 👍 ever worked kinds jobs condescending fucker? college.

My mother nearly 50 years experience field, multiple degrees. father well, construction compliance side.

There good jobs. feeding people, challenging best, showering people, taking bathroom, literally cleaning afterwards cleaning chairs, clothes adult diapers. Many need nearly constant care. Many extenuating health issues makes care well far difficult.

That sound like fun you? ever showered 300 lb. invalid using crane shower chair? Ever wiped another adult's ass? Several times day? Ever cleaned urine? Vomit? Laundered clothes filled another person's waste?

This addition behavioral issues come elderly/disabled well state federally mandated rules programs must followed letter occupational therapy behavior modification.

The residences understaffed. workers underpaid. Many call even limited time off. get paid holidays off, work every one.

On top laundry, food preparation, medications (for multiple residents, specific dietary/medical needs well constant cleaning top everything else.

In addition everything, smallest detail hourly basis needs meticulously documented suprise state federal inspections regular basis.

I even get additional complexity billing recording outcomes required Medicaid.

You never worked Direct Care single day life. 

You shitty, immature fuckhead. STFU. observational study assign groups one treatment another. less robust form study lot room confounding, requires patients get meaningful results. 

A randomized control trial takes group patients randomly assigns two treatment plans. typically blinded. much stronger form evidence thus typically requires fewer patients get meaningful result vitamin b content? multi doesn’t keep up? thinking height Roman Empire. 200 BCE Punic Wars conquest Macedonia, Roman Empire major power say. Plus 1000 years nice round number. Although suppose Rome still republic time.

500 years would also worked well, since Rome founded around time point out. Keep lie. got called bigot travel ban put place handful countries totally unrelated covid.

The racist component around covid Chinese virus rhetoric led axts racism asians country despise them. ones know permanently destroyed respect them. reason people know lost loved ones. Wow whole year covid problems, I'll take thanks telling hoes since April believe me. Winning!🙄 really want know, number reflection government collected data. example, people died retirement homes automatically assumed corona, many countries didn’t this. really ok. Nice, best luck. Hopefully dizziness nothing major. 10,000IU 

Per day?!? safe upper limit vitamin around 4000 IU per day? read taking much 5k IU day lead toxicity. literally implied forced. put familiar terms; similar Timmies, better. Approximately zero North Dakotans cancel even modify Thanksgiving Christmas plans. We're getting started.

I'm done caring people refuse distance point. fine, go church, go bar, attend sister's wedding friend's baby shower, invite whole family Grandma's 90th birthday. 

Nobody's going inconvenienced might well let fucking burn, could use fewer old conservative assholes around here.

Number 1 7-day average new cases per capita 7-day average deaths per capita. hey, oktoberfest! guess question is, point? reap benefit end-times, bring faster?

Those get raptured generally think peer didn't. lofty ringside seat, gloat suffering fools left behind. 

Pretty sadistic entertainment, imo. 9/11 comparisons need stop. understand person statistically going die next 12 months dying slightly early comparable 35 year-old dad killed work terror attack? Comparing COVID deaths worst terror attack American history insult victims 9/11.

With way, exactly citing statistics excess deaths, loss human life years COVID vs loss human life years response COVID, statistical chances dying COVID considered valid arguments? first response arguments disregard appeal emotion insulting 9/11 comparison? 

Stop bringing Trump politics. simple assessment whether lock country stop COVID weighing costs option... requires looking statistical data data completely disregarded. Trump feels irrelevant. economy relevant **because human lives attached economy**. People dying due lockdowns. People losing livelihoods due lockdowns. seem happy let go broke die long pat back tell ""saving lives"" ignoring excess death data proves not. 

If put rose-tinted glasses COVID deaths thing matters lockdowns consequences, sure lock indefinitely. back reality need accept consequences lockdowns. need stop ignoring them. *Uh-oh*.

Colleges even open pandemic, let alone football seasons. Ideally, colleges United States remain closed there's vaccine (current estimates *distribution general public* range March September 2021; definitely *not* going 2020 thing, NYC right cancel ball drop, etc.). Yes, opposition sometimes says away in-person school *too* long harm good, understand logic argument one bit. long we're protecting lives vulnerable elderly virus even yet know long-term complications of, think *very* good deal. In-person school probably already going become obsolete within 5-10 years anyway (in high-end communities, least); pandemic seems sped progress little. *how*, may ask you, bad thing??

Additionally, *everyone* school, issue ""my inequality!!"", opposition claims, every school district missing instruction amount? mean, come on, *leader America's national teacher's union* said so!

Unfortunately, know well, everybody getting *serious* pandemic fatigue, hankering return normal quickly possible wanna get back ""old lives""... time fall/winter spike public health experts long worried about? covid around last year. continue eradicate deadly viruses. make one new norm? comparing countries' responses. saying India's human tragedy bigger story US's (admittedly tragic) incompetence.

I made clearer.  reversible MAOI fine eating cheese stuff. Watch serotonin syndrome, though; essentially like taking second antidepressant. Shit. I’ve taking 4K/day year half feel pretty good. I'm going look gift horse mouth. vaccine that's available me, I'll take 100% question. like I'm paying anyway. government is. need write novel explain may big deal companies called out....

Its wrong. 

We care legal, wrong. 

The bottom line legislators willing put stipulations actually substance receiving money. 

By design.   picked random thread found random idiot wolla, you.

Why always you? 

Don't clue? least 12-16 hours day

EDIT: mRNA-1273-P301  headline pretty misleading. woman got virus May, recovered felt fine summer, got sick tested positive 4 times late August/early September. 4 tests confirm really infected second time, caught COVID-19 4 times. 

Also it’s interesting note took antibody test shortly got sick negative, meaning likely either failed produce antibodies faded quickly. studies show happens infected people. thing spreading disease she’s choosing path, she’s choosing path others exposes. can't beat em join em. mother ultimate proponent vitamin supplements. years. studies came out, felt extreme amount vindication.

COVID-19, died. Older people less responsive immune systems underlying comorbidities, heightened risk dying contract COVID. people absolutely nuts incredibly selfish. Well shit. [No one taking see sub in. I'm ok said. people ok spreading rumors negative effects, that's problem live it. Good point, edited comment reflect that. Actually live broward county, fl, compliant nationwide restrictions like everywhere else. much ton small businesses like pool company went under. vivid dreams nightmares.

i need many months years wait vaccine? well aware overdose believe toxicity really starts taking 40,000 IU day referring page makes fun Unruh: respirator style protects you, people around you. agree sentiment (correlation equal causation) would bet causal. 

People refuse distance, refuse wear masks, wander bathrooms without distancing masks. Staff better. I've work since March checking trusted coworkers. Restaurants utter shit show. idea I'm gonna pay rent restaurant opened middle June absolutely refused return. I'd rather live car catch transmit shit. Well, way curriculum designed, skills build top other, unless kids held back grade (which reluctant do), continue fall behind Good lord. debunked thousands times. 6% count people effects virus like respiratory failure death certificate. actual percentage much higher.

Christmas weird. understand reference. lick frozen fish straight package /s forgot Florida south finally cooling enough shut ac spend day outside. Obviously never south, lol.  Well said. It’s shitty dilemma have. Tomography PCR test one reliable? One relatives got hospitalized based tomography got symptoms also. PCR test turned negative. confused asf. one reliable? PCR Tomography? Currently, hospitals doing? comment made like packed gills speak. See, that’s thing. “Expected come in...”

But don’t? difference make, really? They’ve got another year two grades could possibly matter (eg acceptance gifted programs), even worry it? 

Maybe there’s something I’m seeing. I’m sorry comment comes across insensitive. don’t see matters, especially since kids won’t really learn read age 7 anyway, since brain hardware isn’t ready it. coworker test positive said felt fine whole time. came back work told everyone one household got infected says bull crap hyped. coworkers feel same. relaxed safety measures ""have place"" since Covid-19 ""hit close home"" nothing happened.

Can someone explain science behind one household spread like wildfire another seems one person gets infected?

From understanding seems asymptomatic rarely spread it. may case got exposed low infection dose therefore mild case become highly infectous much lower viral load expose others to. gotten much higher infection dose likely would severe case symptoms much contagious thus likely infected entire household.

Does assessment sound correct? Thanks mention Syria still civil war. 😂😂

I always count guy bring stupid new level. all, company required law keep paying dividends Wall Street. Whitestone spokesperson Amy Feng said real estate investment trusts like Whitestone required put 90 percent income toward company continued pay dividends commerce returned shopping centers; it [declared](http://ir.whitestonereit.com/file/Index?KeyFile=404873404) on June 16 would pay another $4.5 million dividends, separate payouts July, August said PPP funds walled funds separate bank account spent pay employees.

Dialysis patients would likely stay away crowds, probably accurate is. find interesting WaPo (the allegedly liberal newspaper) doesnt think almost 32.8 million people lot.

I understand OP copy pasting, though. Thanks share. It’s almost like there’s supposedly family friendly political party full naive idiots think ignoring humanity’s flaws/natural inclinations instead figuring deal running programs! Yes liar, someone asked meant general sick said general. completely different asia.

Also worth noting alot mask usage pollution cities. let stop little tirade. great job unraveling democracy, constitution, undermining free press, ignoring virus imagine 4 years. very, mutation around since least February. Also, certain contagious, animal studies inconclusive. good summary Yeeeeee-hawwwwww!!!!!  I’m sorry last report 2018 says 47 billion. spend 2 billion year salaries, retirement, insurance, etc. I’m pretty sure could swung without taking money colleges much lower financial numbers.

GO JJ explained already.

USA made world news leading country infections. makes sense another western country would compared usa per capita terms.

That prove point all.

If leading pack yard stick measure against. Yeah, bad bad bad.  Kids act way better front strangers front parents. way better wait pandemic person school today, restaurants 50% capacity, bars closed, people required wear masks enter businesses.  Also, individual counties could choose write stricter laws state. counties south Florida stricter regulations, longer, rest state.

Desantis blocking local governments imposing stricter rules unless ""prove"" need. this, felt kind safe living working South Florida, wearing masks everywhere public become normal. spin stats presented real issue. Approaching 10% infection rate really, really bad. Saying 'fewer than' marginalizes downplays severe is. said, ""line"". arbiter. say follow laws, makes different places lax restrictions right now, people enjoying themselves? 

If suggesting sufficient people follow laws (AND ordinances/mandates), wrong. can't expect people educate Covid-19. expect people set aside desires sake strangers. 

It's government set rules citizens. Obviously Covid handled differently countries around world, approach safe criticism. question is, many people okay kill secure rights happiness? answer, opinions.

My original point public, pose risk people. Acknowledge don't. Downplay want, risk there. No, ingrained habit result previous disease outbreaks. see can't happen western world.

I also never said anything wearing mask ""all time"" either. much. hair loss going thyroid issues. husband would never say something like me. offered us shave heads would help instead. thought supposed ignoring CDC, they’re politically compromised something complete dipshit charge top new wrinkle. believe northeast wouldn’t surprised all. recent outbreaks south, west Midwest seems like there’s lot testing hard imagine missing many agree Mortality rate cases approaching 1%, hopefully cases translate less 5 deaths. I'll pass personally. please feel free continue wearing mask forever far it’s two people aren’t sure it’s even condition... proceed caution IMO tier 1 scared? cannot even admit American people problem

Well ones support certainly are.

But recall sort response public health ever before, seriously. Bad things this. herd immunity flu, sure herd immunity covid? document focused solely measures mitigate supply chain disruptions. says nothing whether effective. not.

It's funny yet provide sources NZ's measures document also address illiteracy impact immunization programs, name many devastating effects lockdowns.

Food production main issue. Australia lockdown otherwise going address impacts poorer countries.

'By contributing availability affordability food, trade remains crucial part solution countries’ food security concerns — particularly moment people’s incomes pressure. therefore critical keep trade flows open, ensure food supply chains stay operational.'

Yeah, Australia numerous countries form lockdown signatories keeping trade flows high horse. I’ve taken one week kidneys pain. feeling? flights land NYC every day Florida, highly doubt people quarantine required two weeks. It’s matter time virus spreads here. Let’s get ahead ourselves. First need table. Fair enough, way know Swedish well (although danish ø raises questions). I've got couple workplace they're single use know, exactly sustainable ever introduce general mask recommendation, seems unlikely though.  normal temperatures 48 hours prior injection. deep freeze distribution. 10,000 IU's extremely dangerous. ever want take maybe 3,000 IU's.

Nah. conversation worth time anymore. converse gotcha! slicksters. well absolute numbers huge they're generally looked compared lot western nations federal government many state governments taken virus seriously likely spend least effective, expensive solutions available. school Alabama dropped $400,000 mass temperature scanners students, instance.

Imagine better uses 85 million could go toward.  leadership one Ron “head in” Desantis keep conversation over? cases going Florida, Texas, Arizona, California July, deaths super low too. deaths started rising states. get bad NYC states terms deaths, rose 100-200 day states. Unless something drastically changes Wisconsin, see death's rise. cases = deaths. hard comprehend? guy worse COVID. It’s differences gut biome.

That's hilarious. pathetic group people one day studied people agree time: serious dumbasses. Except Chinese government lied covered virus. We're rightly allowed skeptical 'information' coming China. Frankly skeptical need head checked. Economists talking stop disease spread... exactly wheelhouse 4000ui day keeps virus away! works great mood improvement. glad I've drank probably thousand gallons milk lifetime lol There’s proof Trump rally. wishful thinking leftists part. need ventilators?

The truth kinds complictions caused lots viral infections. Many *not* dire. since take months fully disappear, also considered ""long term"".

Here's another article NYT. Try reading one. Maybe start shake narrow, privileged, smug, first-world perspective.

[Hunger growing scourge China kinda already hinted(via WHO) naturally spread cross infection, originating bats. Aus want believe it, China said engineered foreign country explanation - Aus choose believed either. like Australian walking random person colored skin 'so from? ... mean originally from?' fuck wrong Florida. that’s coming someone lives Texas. personally believe lockdown answer (except times like March), balanced approach protect people's livelihoods wellbeing appropriate.

That said, anti-lock movement UK full nutters like Icke claim faked sinister conspiracy (yet time real caused 5g?), anti vax idiots, moan wearing masks keeping personal space though enormous infringement human rights.

Balancing risks mean lockdown- means distancing, reducing numbers people see masks etc, turn reduces need lockdown. protestors moronic, ban people driving, still enforce speed limits seat belts. Oh, I’m sorry that’s case. I’m glad you’re taking steps get better. know people there, people don’t even know (i.e. me) thinking want happy. Best luck &lt;3 anti-masks required? understanding isn’t required Okay, much last minute shopping SO. what’s harm?

There definitely harm take much.

Keep 1 thousand UI per day, more. dislike implications reinfection. 

Dislike strong enough sentiment, perhaps, capture range emotions consider negative and/or unpleasant. 5000IU 10000IU? No. People clinical trials monitored. different clinical trial. article mentions it. No. think slick not. I'll raise dunning-kruger effect Mr. Smartypants. Misleadership unnecessarily complicated daily COVID death chart Quebec.

As see daily new deaths low single digits since mid June. 

So far there's scant evidence recent surge new cases going lead surge deaths. likelihood result combination increased testing increased spread among young people returning school work. even care people spread medical staff looking suffer.  Yeah, worked well decided Covid Democrat hoax. Antibodies last longer six months. disappear. seeing ‘antibody last three months’ misinformation lot recently. We’re #1! take 50000 IU week use Magnagel daily. Doctors prescribed, helps sleep. Take minimum 10,000IU per day

The question ""what ethical / moral choice?""

What would do?

There's right wrong answer - hypothetical scenario. obviously - relevant today subject restrictions. also take vitamin K2? help getting calcium away blood bones.

I'm extremely high risk covid sooooooo I've locking house room I'm hospitalized happened 4 times god knows many ER visits since March shit hit fan take sources then? Canadians know take Vitamin supplement, especially winter. make northern reaches less susceptible? lot anti-maskers COVID-deniers convinced emergency orders health department orders constitutional even legal authorities enforce. hope story gets around. People need stop morons. canada lot less dense population also earlier phase spread. Protesters means-testing health reasons personal data (including DNA) would given mainland organization. organization could said information seized CCP.

I remember hearing public safety also cited one among long list reasons listening news

The fear DNA collected mainland organizations seems somewhat overblown. Firstly, already means acquire HK hospital systems. anti-government faction, tend treat HK government public officials extension CCP anyway. need voluntary program something already easily? like CCP imposed upon HK despite massive dissent.

Secondly, extra information glean already have? smart phones already sanctioned spying devices record daily speech utterances, personal communications, possibly handing CCP. still using smart phones worry much CCP taking info?

Given CCP evil, fearful simply taking DNA data? Would afraid implant microchips test too?

Anyway, jokes aside. type politicking done anti-government parties HK generally highly partisan akin type disrupting politics played conservative parties ailing democracies like US UK. seems like long initiative driven ruling faction, fight tooth nail regardless merit cost/benefit citizens. ask honestly - think anti-government factions support anything done ruling regime even net win citizens? Sometimes, seems much ask HK political parties treat civilians disposable pawns fight pro-Beijing government sweating bullets thrashing took local elections last year. likely repeat given everything happened last year.

History shown us Beijing government disqualify many elected officials like keep grip. Given anti-government protesters successfully destroyed city economically encouraged international sanctions world, CCP even less lose comes taking authoritarian actions HK. That's happens people destroy leverage going full-tantrum mode whole year. also lying opportunist. Seriously! There’s also lot drinking driving going what’s point DUI laws? I’d even go say counties lot violent assaults legalize assault too. think you’re really something.  RDA 9000, 800. 800 legal outdated misinformed number. big Vitamin mistake. whole magnitude.

I've heard too! honestly understand big deal is. wearing mask goes antimaskers constitutional rights, wearing clothes goes mine. I'm sure would upset people stopped wearing clothes.

Honestly, mind wearing mask. another fashion accessory. Also, nice able go somewhere random stranger tell much prettier I'd look smiled more. store requires masks can't compete one doesn't.

That’s problem. problem women often excluded drug trials studies potential “hormonal interference,” therefore dosing treatment guidelines built around men. yes, gentlemen, bad reactions medications. thing is, it’s predictable there’s awareness treat it.

Disney bubble wants be. believe they're making solid efforts social distancing, I've still seen pictures weekend days show quite people gathered. I'm outside 90% day.

Noice. Make sure buy vitamin supplement winter tho. wear mask! winter gonna suck. bad death isn’t negative effect disease Let guess think it’s 6-24x higher. It’s not. Confirmed cases within 40% actual cases. Almost Vitamin supplements D3 anyways. hard get D2 D3 cheaper easier make manufacturer better every way. people get D2 prescribed elderly doctors dunno new science like 80 years old almost dying. still wouldn’t implement lockdown. Because: A. scenario unlikely happen.
B. Lockdowns doesn’t really stop spread, slows delay new potential clusters open again. many fucking times need posted? Oh, nice. Well, I'm sorry hear bad weather. hate cloudy week too! Unlikely.

The problem is, China pull off, pull off, actually fighting against? almighty God himself? Read article. concern first big surge cases huge financial hit hospitals, especially public hospitals care poorer communities. Many large numbers sick patients, manyCovid patients remain hospitalized weeks sometimes even months, caring covid patients costly (ICU care particular enormously expensive). Many patients neither health insurance funds pay care received. time, “elective” procedures (such knee replacements, example) generate revenue hospitals cancelled months virus, even restrictions lifted many people haven’t seeking care (or even going screenings like mammograms colonoscopies) afraid.  
So, hospitals dangerously low cash. means another big surge happens, may literally unable provide care sick people need help. buy oxygen, medicines, disinfectants, IVs, etc etc they’ll need? It’s scary situation. every hospital place, course, decent number are, communities depend may fucked. bet neighbors happy. RDA 9000. Food get max 1000. Dr. Underdosing you.

I love Rome, although might different perspective definitely less knowledge, I'd love learn engage fruitful discussion topic.  
But again, point I, maybe clumsily, tried make politicals system stable enough, carry centuries. trying say free internal conflicts anything like that. taking macro perspective history. sense would also claim HRE stable system, better arrangement. take close look it, pretty much definition political chaos mess, reason institutions existed long chaos. 
I hope somewhat agree me, taking definition stable. also think founding fathers kinda thought, Rome HRE elements stable goverment took inspiration attempt create own. I'm sure know well.  

I think main thing disagree see future USA (compares Rome). Again, certainly know do, advantage outside perspective. humble opinion, say profound sympathy american people, completely, irredeemebly fucked. current conflict beeing equivalent Marius/Sulla civil war best case scenario.

India also country lot deep poverty. We’re talking people reliant daily wages, people living crowded slums, whole families rural villages financially dependent remittances family members cities. government reach—especially many poor workers informal sector—to provide substantial relief.

The desperation crowded conditions mean lockdown basically impossible enforce India. Even it’s illegal, poor try keep working somehow avoid starvation. density urban slums make lockdown largely ineffective there.

CDC bungled testing shockingly badly start, we’ll never know many cases NYC had. Sorry, bad. weeks? 6 months, minimum 4 weeks go. 4 weeks meet rediculously low averages lol. people think well versed critical thinking one bias towards entire nation.

When people ask whether ones brainwashed sometimes, maybe achieve world peace. CIA lied plenty times citizens. Project MKULTRA .ICE camps also present today. barely scratch surface  scares me, need stay social media... Got peer reviewed study substantial sample size back claim up? I'm seeing lot detail constitutes ""obsessive behaviour."" entire story much informative headline. mean, every single state drop restrictions 70% USA still stay home right/safe thing. 

Saw recent poll 70% still think big issue. people, like me, still stay away. 

People crying opening businesses PA sure open up...you still won’t get enough business 70% still cautious, safe thing. Pretty sure Paris Hilton qualified advise pandemic response fat donny read today scientists think wait two months 2nd dose safety reasons. would true vaccines  chickens coming home roost would valuable. proven infection protocol near 100%, via rhesus monkey trials something, need placebo. 

I mean, sit room 5 infected people ventilation 8 hours five days row, I'd say would close enough 100% infection probability give valuable data. really know herd immunity, pretending reach really putting people risk. ""Thank God burn whole house paint anymore."" Yes, people ""going walk"" nearly enough. Ok, story popping every day since March.  people America poor. means India iran poor. Food stamp, free internet, cell phone poor. read single blog, thanks Ah... lockdown fatigue sets in. could possibly go wrong go wrong go wrong... Yeah I've seen articles park rangers stumbling upon people states reporting police lol Whatever case. still facing 40 million people losing homes, world laughing us, closing civil war ever seen. amount ""we of"" fix that. must tackle present future prevent societal collapse help Seasonal Affective Disorder long dark winter months I've taking 10,000IU 2 years also. people kooky ideas Usenet. used called Kooks. People knew full it, entertained kookiness all. 
Now would Facebook group, YouTube channel would followers would wear tshirts repeat drivel.   Generally, yes, problem challenge trials. 

But even without it, vaccine effective, prove infection protocol via means (monkeys, sitting room infected people couple hours, etc) gives high confidence interval, still learn lot quickly. one way find out!!! Illegal PPP rules, generally. think that’s misunderstood me. cannot buyback stock PPP funds per Act. stole Robin Williams believe FL recalls. assuming talking EUA actual end date, 2 years. believe trial design documents said 4 months safety efficacy signals based assumed infection rates. What's title? proper English sentence please? fair, people say ""and look who's administration running CDC"" numbers. Also stay away calling people sheep. ends hurting argument invalidating it. one wants see. solid point null void silly statement. Oh, really.... thats New Yorks second run bad...?

Yeah, probably last decades, everyone (according WHO)... 

There possibility bad reinfections... case we're screwed anyway.  cross immunity, believe is, infections bad. many transmission .... Here's latest case/death charts Missouri, running 7-day deaths cases spiking running averages.

Missouri ranks 33rd per capita Junior Senior year spent go school take seriously? Holy shit, dreaming? Thank link, however vaccine seems still trial phase correct wrong reason second stage longer using genuine placebo (saline placebo)? 

Also many vaccines turned bad much recent times. Two examples Polio vaccine used Africa confirmed month cause Polio outbreaks region MMR vaccine banned Japan 1994 causing adverse reactions 1 900 children. Downward trend continues here, contrast states. re-watching think he's talking total population infected, immunity

He's saying modelling planning take worst case scenario new virus 80% population infected total (without measures). asymptomatic see total amount infections see 80% minus asymptomatic. mean reopen? doctors stupid. see they’re doing. /s What's drastically better existential dread? Title news report misleading. surprised. Deaths still accurate total testing numbers metric really measuring capacity test individuals. positivity rate important total positive infections. Typical 'Murica confrontational discussion style 😁

Sorry, fucking hate reddit can't stop browsing reading things piss off. need find better way waste time phone...

I'm interested arguing opinions either. nice day. True  Yeah true. opposite actually Covid: Economy lives?

Inept government: Let think...

Covid: Thanks, take both. tbh didn’t even restrictions. I’ve saying people (me included) half assing mask wearing, going out, eating bars GeT uSeD iT! Stop lying world 7 million cases “most” people 300 million population? wow I'm nurse Florida. I'm also severely asthmatic. outside like walking ugly sauna, like going outside.


Since I'm nurse working 12-hour shifts, usually wake sun rises get home till sun starts setting. really get much sunlight last bloodwork indicates vitamin deficient. doctor told *had* take supplement.


Many people work home looking work, means lot time spent indoors. Unless work outside make point exercise outside, probably likely vitamin deficient not. Even lived outside every day day, Pacific Northwest, would still enough vitamin D. doctors tell us take it. Look added second account Let’s remember 1 day increase trend. others pointed out, NY conducts around 80K-100K tests day, far testing back April. would take tens thousands, probably 100K, cases reach level damage NY faced spring. low quality post thought symptom screens airports? cancelled? Yeah, still thing. assumed Minnesota so, TIL mass event taking place month ago could explain surge.  boils to, take responsibility myself. want responsible want responsible you. take precautions go without forcing you. Science like already said showing bad.

You're trying push views weaponizing empathy using emotions people want make feel good. say Democrats follow talking points. Take responsibility man. everyone needs baby peers.

Btw average covid death 77 years old Florida. average death age without covid 78.... Makes think little. Maybe bad fake media makes be. Alright everyone. Time shove done butts Yeah, I've taken anything pandemic ""Mayne healthier individual. I've working more, popping c wrong about? saying wear mask corrected new information came out, wrong about?

The virus airborne, virus affects young people, virus still spreading, 23+ states seeing increases cases. 

You say doomspeak maybe thats pretty dire situation we’re in.

Under reacting Trump 200,000 Americans dead. Thats bad? 200,000 fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, men, women, children could still alive today people listened science baseless personal bias Oh look,[ another covid brigading thread downplaying numbers otherwise inactive account. 

Meanwhile, fact land, Canada's death rate, per capita, half US. current trajectory, could increase sixty percent next months. big deal, stop downplaying this. forgot criminals wishing harm part that's wrong, since give shit safety others care people get hurt long reinforces bias, probably actually kinda selfish deep down. Good point, thank - spiritually enlightened saying since beginning humanity, ""change must come within"". much pains say it, Americans chose reality incredibly important lesson learn. 100% wont send child in. Actually, heart quit beating. That's really killed him. see putting death certificate! /s would like detailed response I'd happy provide one.

First, primary article linked referencing meta-analysis purely large-scale statistical analysis multiple sets data. extremely powerful method drawing grand conclusion overall large set similar data, also drawbacks.

First studies differences, including conducted, populations studied, methods data collection, on. differences studies weaken conclusion meta-analysis, differences data could result differences studies rather measured outcome.

Second, statistical significance always equate clinical significance. skilled statistician knows nothing medicine could perform meta-analysis large set studies support nearly conclusion want, even regarding data completely unrelated intended scope study. say easy lose forest trees performing statistical analysis numerous studies multiple, varied populations datasets.

Lastly, opinion importantly, important understand correlation equal causation. study shows ""statistically significant"" connection one thing measured outcome mean two directly related. example, lets suppose conduct study relationship number birthday parties celebrated throughout lifetime life expectancy. Obviously people live longer birthday parties die younger age. One could look results study conclude people throw birthday parties live longer, thus everyone birthday party every day entire life, reality study proved people celebrate birthday parties year (if that) birthday parties dead people. (Now worth mentioning control groups help strengthen case causation, still opportunity third independent variable steering ship towards correlation).

So getting back topic hand: study referenced top thread article discussing meta-analysis multiple studies measured vitamin patients along all-cause mortality rates. Ignoring irresponsible recommendations first author, meta-analysis nothing suggest correlation versus causation vitamin usage. fact, even recommend caution dosing 1000 units per day: National Academy Sciences–Institute Medicine–recommended daily allowance 600 800 IU per day, intake 1000 IU per day reported safe daily use almost adults, according recent Endocrine Society clinical guidelines.12 Still, authors expressed concern efficacy absolute safety doses greater 1000 IU per day, caution reasonable.69,70

Now, getting back MAIN article reddit post, extremely small data-set also little show coorelation vs causation. could well case patients supplimented vitamin also likely generally healthy lifestyle, fewer co-morbidities and/or better health insurance. importantly, none patients study anywhere near suggested serum vitamin levels suggested author meta-analysis commentary.

So summary, medical statistical basis taking 10,000 units Vitamin like reddit armchair doctors thread insisting on. Dude don’t even leave house  Yeah among wealthy, seems spain, UK US ones worst. I'm fearful may reclaim worst position winter settles in. know else scary? Major economic recessions. know many people die those? deaths lockdown slowly catching deaths coronavirus. Except aren’t gonna stop climbing pandemic.

He put horrible position. can’t afford wrong severity virus keep overplaying it. also put us position NEED vaccine. never bank entire economy livelihoods vaccine virus. sets horrible precedent future well, another pandemic don’t figure vaccine for, absolutely screwed would bad 20% idiots Man dreams! lockdowns ended many states earlier. NJ stay home order since June. everything open now, least open now, though many restaurants keeping things outdoors, partially due staffing issues.

About thing verboten still massive gatherings. size permitted gatherings ebbed flowed spikes. Last check limited 150 people indoors (for major events like weddings, etc), 500 outdoor (religious political gatherings excluded). General gatherings might home, etc, limited 25 people. Well that's good, looks like I'm gonna drink milk (vitamin added milk Canada). Schools open many countries across Europe fyi think official COVID-denier excess deaths take deaths effect lockdown, disease Close stay closed adequate treatment and/or vaccine. Holy fuck isn’t complicated. Yup. comparable thing COVID 9/11 way world governments used strike fear people advance political agendas. pick history book.

Anti-maskers deniers exist pandemics always win.

By win mean enough people give interventions waves pandemic naturally burn treatment. Wow. would ever thought state governor denial, encouraged tons events social distancing ends getting cases!?
I feel bad hundreds within 579 picked happened shopping going school along side morons spreading feel serious. it’s worth, got Covid diagnosed vitamin deficiency. take daily supplement level, measured shortly recovered, right bottom edge “normal.” pretty well now, almost exactly month past first day symptoms. hospitalized. lingering lung inflammation, apparently prety common. young enough relatively low risk category, though.

Before started taking supplements, getting quite frequent fairly intense respiratory infections (a selection colds/flu/maybe mono?) improved started treating deficiency supplements.

No big point here, anecdote. He’s delusional around Taking 5000-6000IUs day whole family. aren’t deficient, we’re starting 30mg/mL need bulk out.  path untenable. don’t care partisan anymore. 
 
Vote put adult back room it’s late next 200,000. Isn’t even 5,000 day extreme amount? color from? also good help severity potential COVID infection. Staying shape. confrontational discussion style 😁

So would preferred method health care then? I'll come straight say health care free (paid taxes) matter for. means lot people paying others without using hey ho. People saying since May/ June. Guess agenda changed little bit media Whatever say, uggo. vitamin you? Also, really good piece anti-intellectual phenomenon US: wonder big check Soros.

/s Worst part gave probably like million people Spain back home.

This story basically says riding planes traveling symptoms.

""He sick vacation, cold sweats losing taste smell, Grailey told Evening News. condition worsened even upon return Watford, town located northwest London Grailey currently based work project.""

Lol remember demonized people made claim back beginning this. would thought sunshine would good ya? Let guess east?? know many billions dollars went east hard working “fools”?? can’t print money silly look national debt 16?? Better lock even more. Even one death many! tolerate second lockdown.

European countries example, heard anything second lockdowns France, Italy, Spain even surges. Joe Rogan saying months, since immunologist back Covid first started Really unfortunate see go trusted official target conspiracies. Fauci spent entire life working helping people preventing pandemics, credibility destroyed alot people viewed disagreeing reality TV show host thought injecting disinfectant would cure virus. considered extra caution better things escalate point can't anything? 

Exponential growth SCARY. notice enough care enough something already late. 

People understand concept push preventative measures cost looking overly careful do. better overreact shrug say ""welp, is"" late. must really personal growth. Downvoted stating facts? never seen anything like /s apology Canadian! got point there. Care elaborate experience? herd immunity 🤣 idea still try ""Dr."" Chris Martenson, neither medical doctor scientist. He's economist. *points spain france* Kremindme 1 week Think U.S. Many, included, competently different view young. Dreaming living USA least visit it. grew rugged pulled feet realize actually live there, downfall 4 years top it. still baffles people headline say.

It's hard believe hard process, hence much it. hard grasp bad become, grasping bad things North Korea example, isn't.  TL;DR:

1. ""Local experts say San Francisco’s low death rate likely city started sheltering place earlier major cities, helped maintain relatively low case count overall.""
2. ""San Francisco also tests people per capita cities included analysis ."" Well that's already happening already least China. They're testing version vaccine Middle East, South America Southeast Asia. course poor getting first see complications. We’re sure; I’m thinking lettuce got hornbachers. Fuck I've got mine probably included US national anthem money point Second month row can't pay rent.

there broad scientific consensus virus likely originated reality likely virus simply identified China first.

there's justification using word 'likely' virus emerges somewhere likely identified US, Europe China first due technological advancement.

true. support previous point. possible identified near place originates virus identified one area decrease likelihood originated there. fact, would seem increase it. mostly likely find lint dryer make likely lint came elsewhere. kind extremely poor reasoning makes averse responding already study waste water University Barcelona, claims traces COVID-19 found March 2019. SARS-CoV-2 detected Barcelona sewage long declaration first COVID-19 case, indicating infection present population first imported case reported. See (see PDF) Similar studies Italy Brazil found traces wastewater earlier expected (Q4 2019).

the likely explanation simply contamination false positive. /u/merithynos detailed explanation here: studies strongly suggest virus zoontic origins horseshoe bats: narrows origin virus considerably, true, china, laos, myanmar.

simply consider case highly contagious virus somehow spreading globally without resistance months prior detection. many birthday parties weddings resulting dozens hundreds local infections? yet believe virus place back mid-to-late 2019 believe reason burn across globe unconstrained conditions, burns across globe despite nearly every country taking efforts contain strain majorly found US (NY) related European one, apart first early cases Washington California linked China. However, genomic lineage Lombardy reveals early Italian infections largely unrelated Chinese outbreak Wuhan. lineages contain viral strains isolated first months outbreak China (black branches, dots); let us hypothesize transmission chain directly involving China (i.e., country pandemic originated). Notably, closely related viral isolate clustered outside Lineages isolated Central Europe, second half January. See (PDF)Looking current genomic lineage, seems European strain descent Chinese strain, seem like cousins instead.

your source preprint. even passed peer review yet imply 'unrelated' way. actually, we've tracked many mutations virus directly link back asia: mean origin mother strain possibly China, means could anywhere. bet somewhere Central Europe East Asia.

weasel words. china likely origin virus.

Also, arguments ""other avoidable deaths"" equivalent.

Instead going restaraunts parties, shopping stores. go nessecities, food, supplies, exercise. slogan make easy spread Going outside jog safe. Going lake fish kid safe. Going woods hunt safe, wear mask go cut grass. Obviously might different crowded city, car get places
You stop getting information blogs memory serves, said knew risks taking measures protect others. trip dying dad wanted go desperately; wanted see beach one last time, went stayed condo days could manage talk possibly shutting country started. It’s like partying visiting restaurants every night; cooked meals, played board games, hung around condo entire time. 

Let’s spin caring health safety others. advocating wearing masks since March, isolating since returning trip March (only leaving get groceries delivery isn’t available, one day paint grandparents house weren’t home), level best make sure I’m putting others risk. Trust me, take seriously. “These random people internet wrong predictions shouldn’t take COVID seriously” -you I’ll take whichever doesn’t kickoff zombie apocalypse It’s bad cities states couldn’t known steps would effective

/s Bleach sunshine? get crowded outdoor places, masks needed can't social distancing. would make things less complicated enforce. Anyone isn’t rich privileged lucky get all. dont believe US Code word sex, wonder much rates covid youngsters? Generally schools there's daily recess go outside play bit.

He’s trying cater senior population trying bring back tourism. typical him. Even restrictions lifted noticed restaurant house supposed operating half capacity constantly filled brim people. making wait outside etc. Cops would also always frequent joint get food, obviously enforcing anything. deaths still racking up? Take 4000 IU day Vitamin D3 droplet form, food. :-) Spring/summer vaccination likely outcome stands. *might* get approval west year, zero chance people get mid next year. - ban racist ineffective. Think way: if, knowing virus spreads enclosed public spaces, president decided ban black people riding buses trains? Reducing number people public transport *would* slow virus little, everyone else still using them, still gets spread, ban would mostly transparently racist act black people. That's China travel ban nutshell. 

- CDC part executive branch government, words, administration president. hilarious half-wits want shift blame mess agency whose dysfunction *also* fault. 

- followed news closely ever since cropped China. I, nobody Midwest listening handful news podcasts, knew serious shit started preparing February, *president United States* absolutely zero excuse acting like big deal well March April. 

- Australia reported sixteen new cases day, believe. New Zealand kicked virus's ass. Vietnam, country actually borders China, controlled situation. people like actually believe nothing could made difference. Eh, handling whole thing, US politicians, selfishness dumb behavior people. 

The fact government throwing us bus wealthy kind sick, unfortunately laws protecting assholes.

I’m still first one. buy that; people really overestimate much influence one person has. get level incompetency without serious rot compacency within organization. basically fat cats fed money decades without respond anything meaningful. got slow rusty. re-elected Rick Scott TWICE! Look he’s now. much optimism. Well, he's wrong. ones can't stay quarantine get first, means health workers poor people can't afford skip work.

Taking country's experience, poor ones afford quarantine, get proper equipment deal covid (proper masks, alcohol, etc).

So ones go back work first, virus spread faster them.

In country, slaughter. deaths poor people, go back work, spread virus communities. virus SPREAD, 1k deaths per day months.

They also ones can't afford proper medical care, ofc died.

Ofc, president denies virus also helped...  wonderfully sweet message! Thank much! go outside without using sunscreen works too. didn’t help Trump cut funding organisation researching coronavirus wild bat populations China. Ti posso dire la differenza tra Spagna e Italia perché la mia famiglia vive tutta lì e sto pure vivendo un caso di contagio fra di loro.
Mia zia ed il suo compagno hanno preso il covid (lei è asintomatica, il compagno no). Sia mia madre che mia sorella sono state contatto con mia zia nelle ultime due settimane. Mia sorella 2 settimane fa, mia madre 1 settimana fa. Mia madre e mia sorella hanno mangiato insieme 4 giorni fa.

Il tampone glielo hanno fatto 2 giorni fa mia madre (ancora non sanno risultati) mia sorella non potrà farsi il tampone finché non si sa l'esito del tampone di mia madre e solo se il tampone di mia madre è positivo. E questo sta succedendo Madrid, mica un paesino campagna.

A questo aggiungi che chi arriva Spagna via aeroporto, se gli controllano la temperatura è già un trionfo. 

I bar sono aperti, così come ristoranti, e ovviamente senza obbligo di servizio tavolo, si possono vedere ristoranti pieni e con gente nel bar ordinare dappertutto (e con la mascherina neanche sul gomito). questo devi aggiungere che il governo centrale non ha più capacità di decidere perché non hanno potuto continuare con lo stato di emergenza e ogni regione va per cazzi loro senza manco una direzione comune. 

Tutto sommato, la Spagna è mezzo ad una ""tempesta perfetta"" di proporzioni epiche.  think vaccines indeed submitted placebo tests. 

Here’s example they’re trying *really hard* test thoroughly possible. mosaic HIV-1 vaccine multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2a clinical trial (APPROACH) rhesus monkeys (NHP 13-19)

I also think pretty much anything *can* fatal right circumstances. poor sod recently died electrolyte imbalance caused black licorice. However, you’re much likely die COVID flu odd reaction well-tested vaccine. 

There *were* bad vaccines back 1950s actually harmful based live-virus vaccines, recall correctly. era hardly understood viruses vaccines, I’d still prefer see vaccines tested given broader population. Actually yesterday doctor told taking vitamin d, exercise directly outside (under sun) 15 minutes. point missed. bet mood winter live cooler climate drastically better. authorship Revelations actually pretty mundane, earthly, well-documented.

Just like Ani DiFranco's Little Plastic Castles? choir used masks practice, indoors air conditioning. guess lot undernose mask-wearing went on, can't say fact. Well need control. 4 people got sick group find 4 control group know exposure Covid challenge group factor. can't give group people placebo expose Covid, that's ethically wrong. Full employment funny term, though. knew several people *three* jobs. means 1 2 part time enough pay bills. think employment numbers tell full story. Keeping bills paid wonderful, wonderful unable save (and majority people living paycheck paycheck minimal savings). means that, easy get job, sufficient save retirement, cover medical bills, perform house/car repairs. majority people US (and are) financially devastated one single emergency. think that’s better rushing untested vaccine like Russia China besides, don’t approve, suddenly learn new skill disappear! Win win win! Theres many people following rules anyway spreading like crazy even restrictions, mention violence people deal trying enforce restrictions, what's point them. chance. 

Look Oxford ""ready September"" bullshit. October couple days bastards even found anything that's viable.  We're long way mate. one situations Trump right Dr. Fauci wrong. Dr. Fauci economist. need get vaccine public fast possible. Many businesses profitable vaccine available public. can't let bunch businesses go bankrupt scientists fart around. hard convey sarcasm internet. Especially people would actually say said. getcha Yeah vitamin known since day 1. That's would happen. Healthcare free point service everybody. US spends per capita healthcare country besides Switzerland, yet people still pay thousands insurance receive inferior care. US even produces proportionally less research European countries. Single payer universal healthcare cheaper everybody, giving poor destitute people fleeing potential death, starvation, persecution etc.(potentially caused US) healthcare negatively affect anybody else. racist trying hide behind nonsense uninformed opinions. probably won't, nationally. idiots shrug babble herd mentality. hope, I'm holding breath. Sadly, everything fit views people hoax. Internet become mess.

I'm always glad read well argued opinion *try* keep open mind different perspective makes sense, even necessarily agree it.

I wish people would same. live Florida. It’s much better since tourists left. Worst thing governor open path vacation rentals. Huge surge mask less beach restaurant go-ers. Tons restaurant employees sick community.

 [Source | Yeah, thousands U.K. citizens die every year waiting medical treatment. cancer treatment began day diagnosis. systems There's something fishy reported deaths India seem go down/plateau exact time reported cases go down/plateau. That's works. Panic buy vitamin D!! Great sentiment, logically, healthcare workers receive vaccine first. Protection HCWs soon possible lessen logistical issues within hospital systems ultimately affect ability care patients kind, COVID-19 cases. many clinics hospitals currently short staffed nearly every position exception hospital administration. Overburden responsibility current HCWs leading suboptimal care patients increased risk medical errors poor outcomes. 

When look back retrospectively, likely dramatic increase medical errors COVID-19 pandemic primarily driven lack appropriate staffing. vaccine COVID-19 could help alleviate burden would positive impact healthcare kinds patients across country.

Of course, assuming discussing distribution vaccine officially approved ready mass distribution. Obviously, volunteers studies allow approval vaccine would receive first (this standard protocol). 

If talking distribute vaccine general public, objective best option would vaccinate healthcare workers. there, would think forms essential workers risk public exposure would next. groups highest risk exposure gave vaccinated, distributed stratified fashion aim achieve 2 goals:

1) Distribution would optimize reaching true herd immunity.

2) Distribution groups people highest risk infection, well highest risk severe complications sequelae infection.

While speculative behalf, would estimate best way achieve goals would start groups already mentioned, followed distribution densely populated areas high priority groups neighborhoods high-risk, includes areas poverty.

Tl;dr - Agree poor high priority, healthcare workers top priority. helps correct problems within healthcare regarding staff shortages caused COVID-19 pandemic. national guidelines thanks poor leadership. shitty leadership also encouraging people wear masks demanding things open advice epidemiologist experts.

So thanks way economy recover vaccine. bonus central government full control. know 1+billion people save China itself. thank small fraction people selfless sacrifice goes bad. all, greater good. Chinese people support chosen one, they’ve frankly got choice.

Definitely me, thank sacrifice too. least something good (good vaccine?) may come bad government. People expendable, look HK “security” law.

True. protests 310 cities population 100k. Obviously *all cities* mean small fraction cities.
 
I mean literally every single one settlement called city, no. That's Idiocracy spot on. ""It's got electrolytes!"" whooah gives idea. even used worm infections clinical trials inflammatory bowel disease.  Ok plague rat. problem epidemiological studies consistently correlated vitamin kinds good outcomes supplement studies spotty clear overall effect.

Nitric oxide plausible cause lower blood pressure correlated higher vitamin levels vitamin itself. Per [WHO data sheet available rate localized stiffness swelling 24% standard dose most-used vaccine type (for world overall, would pretty standard US use different one lol)

Interestingly say fever placebo. vitamin supplements Isn’t whole answer. Seems read still need sunshine body integrate vitamin D. course correct could worse known risks every vaccine every disease? Download vaccine insert list known risks massive includes death. Go back read first comment. want adopt Canada's immigration laws structure. defending current shitty system encourages illegal immigrants low skills. That's sad truth entire world. Living utopia would almost laughably easy point humanity, attitudes holding us back. countries many methods immigration. There’s lot overlap, like super rich, family sponsor you, asylum claim, etc.

If don’t family, methods probably don’t apply average person. 

The main difference Canada methods high skilled workers, people work jobs demand.

The US uses “diversity lotto.” Education/skill requirements pretty low, countries excluded entirely. chances winning lottery low. (I think 20 million enter lottery 50k green cards granted.)

If you’re high-skilled, Canada probably easier. US doesn’t really skill-based path like Canada.

If you’re low-skilled, Canada tough, whereas US, there’s low chance could get lucky win lotto, you’re coming eligible country.

At least, that’s understanding. corrections others welcome. creates helpless electorate believes nothing effect whatsoever disincentivizes voting direct action. 

The sides despite equally bad areas choice important one effect lot people's lives. 

Biden clearly better many ways voting better encouraging nihilist notions inevitably lead even disempowered electorate. 

Voting Biden mean can't take direct action order better choices future, saying ""both sides same, nothing matters"" obviously much worse far outcomes concerned. EU agenda. UK hit 2nd wave, able negotiate leave Union they'll forced stay. EU's screw almighty Brittish Empire leaving EU extremely weak without strongest member.

Or crazy shit like this. I’m gonna get vaccine covid19 whether comes j&amp;j Oxford, don’t care. sarcastic, I'm worried all. risk dying covid minimal.

!remind me; 4 weeks said he's Canada legal grow 4 plants. asking r/coronavirus this? Seriously? fatality: approximately 0.031%

0.031% x 1.78 x 1.23 = 0.068% risk fatality (this upper bound, age fatality probably already included BMI related risk). know data marijuana use. lol 30k I'm guessing 25% capacity guess spread Cases spike happening states places aren’t hard hit before. That’s it’s time open Florida’s level. Every major populated western country see big surge haven’t before. point excessive restrictions longer. it! makes transition dark/fall/winter much better time year look student debt forgiveness colleges closed. Everyone telling stuff like “It’s big deal” “If die, die,” tell “Fine, don’t want hear backpedaling regretting decisions end hospital thing.” Oh no.

*[steps across border]*

Anyway...  I've reading lot studies HCQ things like Zinc helped alot seems Ivermectin better effective even immune system compromised virus. mind sharing sources HCQ little effect increase cardiac risk? I’m bit worried Sharknados hospital system honest. yet tens thousands protesters shoulder shoulder walking street jail passing covid covid denier. personally hardcore lockdown, since March.

But, asking good faith...they warned hospital system would overloaded first time. Americans complete shitheads ignoring virus, knowledge, hospitals overrun even people completely flippant danger. know city hospitals course, I'm talking nation wide here.

So risk second wave happen first time? 90% population still able infected perhaps? wear sunscreen every time go outside. dont want skin cancer.  10 minutes sub exposure beach (generally shirt/lots exposed skin) 10 minutes walking around street clothes (let's say shirt pants), leaving face lower arms exposed read article morning said, “The event scheduled take place Oct. 3, final day 10-day quarantine window recommended Centers Disease Control Prevention anyone tests positive COVID-19.” aware CDC changed recommended quarantine 14 10 days. God help us. dint believe usa headed tpwards second wave people already caught Americans flocking store looking sunny I’m one downvoting. Maybe information old, last update I’ve personally seen. long make illegal wear mask public again. places will, wont. problem unless everybody takes seriously much effect. We'll many idiots running around keeping going sacrifice lock nothing. us debt bound due education.... That's valid fair point literally explaining study suggesting ""ask doctor instead kid"" weird condescending response someone ELI5ing mumbai guy here, friend friend dad died covid, got marked pneumonia daeth certificate, trust 1500 deaths daily numbers, real numbers close 5000 including people get hospital time, people get hospital bed, people get surgery save lives time etc etc daily recommended dose EU 800 IU (20ug) per day.

yeah that's absurdly low. Holy fuck.....you've got kidding me. France locking despite cases per capita per day US. long hospital systems collapse get close to, countries lockdown b/c economic pain second lockdown way worse first counties went red 16 blue 18. Ya never know. Im curious, exactly many kill? people think generation I'm (upstate ny) would ever consider listening media matter again, they're wrong. We're done. media played hand. made us ruin jobs, social lives, etc. We're going anywhere near trusting media used - single opinion. second lock going happening, government squeezed necks necks millions class movement leaving abusive relationship. Maybe narrative people want hear forum, feasible assume people age, especially 25 - 40 going listen. look Florida headlines today.

If government wants enforce this, they'll crack protests too. good luck making generation stop protesting. Never going happen without literal war. New Zealand got cases zero came back government re-introduced crushing restrictions [threw additional 70,000 children Australia look forward to. Uh oh claiming didn’t fight it’s fake news absolutely right. *not* bad media makes be. fact, *nothing* bad media makes be. That's job, people need stop watching it. keep informed, keeps misinformed. PLEASE show crazy ass mother take supplements means anti vaxer think 9/11 inside job!! Glad people waking bit looking everything black white. what? She’s trained scientist handled nation’s response way better economist ever would. think economics actual science requires critical thinking math skills? Lmao would explain lot posts used perfectly (applied prior sun exposure reapplied frequently) sunscreen filters majority UVB rays (SPF 15 sunscreen filters 93 percent UVB rays, SPF 30 keeps 97 percent, SPF 50 filters 98 percent. leaves anywhere 2 7 percent solar UVB reaching skin). UVB wavelengths triggers vitamin production body. 

So sunscreen greatly reduce vitamin production. However still allows sufficient amount average person. didnt wear sunscreen would probably need around 10 mins sun exposure times week max bodies vitamin production. better option using mid range spf going decent walk (and monitoring skin knowing usually react sun). knew back February. It’s news. must testing go outside 15 minutes day enough. go outside hour direct sun, thats get skin cancer. You’d think stories people saying it’s fake, getting sick, saying it’s fake, pleading others wear mask would gotten person. /s Right.
You realize COVID-19 much deadlier seasonal influenza though, right? mean want reduce that, sure. believe individual liberties important thing person Remember, eating fish better supplements

because supplements fish oil oxidize

which causes oxidative stress (Cell tissue damage)

and course, study back least, consider supplements carefully wrong? ""It's start"" Tell people who've lost lives, livelihoods, feared lives(anyone who's straight, white, conservative) past 4 damn years. Try live president government would love kill trans. Go ahead, tell someone straight face say ""It'll fine 'soon'."" Agree totally. I've military, predisposition anxiety+traumatic events life. much apocalypse death strangeness dreams don’t chew big red then.. did. viral infections. Yep. public building since March 6. human beings see regular basis wife, parents social distanced backyard every couple weeks, coworkers social distanced backyard month so.

I seen 5 people person ALL, 6 months. meanwhile, pick one example, literally tens millions people worldwide face [hunger, disease, due effects lockdowns. No, electors chosen state legislature. 

State legislatures long time abided informal rule sending slate electors reflects popular vote state. bound US Constitution so.

In Arizona, example, vote close (and likely be) Biden ahead say, less 1% (if he's going win state, close closer), state legislature simply say, ""this election close call, appointing slate electors."" state's legislature republican dominated, appoint republican electors. 

The truth matter vote is. look states Republican-majority legislatures Biden MUST win chance 270 electoral votes: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina, Florida, could go on.

There literally dozens ways Republicans use kinds tactics steal election. almost realistic scenario even difficult this. all! That's ask doctors said anything still infectious. I'm sure would send home let know type information. Username checks out! population young. would say happen continues trend down? Username checks out!  illegal?! People upset protests, BLM marches happened officials condemned anti-lockdown marches supported BLM protests people got fed up. know, get it. paid attention biology class, know works. logic could easily overdose Tylenol (IIRC that's brand distributed US; mean paracetamol/acetaminophen clear), get point. Yeah, slowly surely. It'll nice see nothing significant happens Florida rest world follows suit. Well, except Sweden Japan things largely fine entire time sans lockdown. Well need English teachers long skin cancer *also* real. That's great you, everyone's body different. people absorb less high dose actually lead major problems line certain people.

I mention accepting dosage information randos Reddit smartest thing.

Consult doctor find dose need body. End story. Yes, One thing don’t don’t want.....covid. Welp, least Florida might finally turn blue

/s No, I'm saying one option clearly better voting option worthwhile. 

I'm also saying sides nihilism lead worse outcome worse 2 options gaining power, also leads people even trying create change. 

Personally, dislike Biden (I think ""a devil"", think he's general centrist US politician), it'll easier push kind change want office Trump office.  test subject selection process. 200k *with* lockdowns. admit didn’t save anyone Good thing I've riding around convertible summer. DeathSantis even require people gyms wear masks. Stupidity around world. That's European variant, right? won’t.

Coming soon: Festival Covid. many people gonna due wanted point Texas likely already passed 20k excess deaths, stated "" Texas likely end 20k deaths year"". think estimate.

How well Texas handle it, real opinion simply know little handled. 


Some notes statistics:

They take account population growth. article linked, (I think CDC also mention recall it, could find right now): totals compared simple model expected deaths based number deaths past three years, adjusted account trends time, like population changes.

In post above, say "" leaves around 5k. probably within range normal statistical variation. "". CDC takes variation account. Eg hover diagram ""upper bound threshold excess deaths"". 


As calculation percent excess deaths, NY Times link above, show ""percent normal"". US excess death 20% normal. Texas 24%. 
  
As flu, Texas think 3500 deaths per year. Covid far deadly 2 x influenza. even easier relax pretend virus exist. It’s impossible talk Coronavirus bringing political reasons spread bad us many dead much ethnicity socio-economic standings. either English French-speaking culture plus, course. There's fair proportion non-Euro migrants status, they're already rich families often related former country's establishment.

I'd describe Canada's immigration policies classist racist.

So far 204k deaths .064% population 318 million protests cities.

There 310 cities population 100k. Obviously *all cities* mean small fraction cities.

Perspective thing easily lost. kids- flu much deadly. 


The trouble kids don’t kill parents bringing home flu school. might kill parents bringing home covid. genuinely believe core problem ‘college kids rioting?’

Given level injustices occurring, I’d say 99% protesters incredibly well behaved. since we’ve several regional police forces tell us it’s White Suprematists posing BLM protesters starting trouble, I’d say it’s difficult lay blame feet protesters.

And again, it’s police and/or city governments telling us this. (just) media. 

The guy White House openly criminal corrupt. he’s encouraging police corruption letting virus run rampant. might core cause ‘protesting college kids’ dismissive. says unlikely. science language yes happen.

- 50-69 years: 0.5%

- 70+ years: 5.4%

Americans double standard always. Can't beat China, defame China. Shame. Ummmmmmmmmmmmm, no. leave doctors decide kid. makes sense considering effect Vitamin ACE2 receptors: might preventing COVID-19 fully latching intervention RCTs Calcifediol used 1-week regimen showed 96% reduction ICU admission. Obviously studies needed since 96% could outlier effect big benefit vitamin COVID. Either COVID depletes Vitamin using metabolized form like Calcifediol regulates immune response, actively impacts viral replication. Idk enough immunology differentiate two. It’s dildo  Michigan Covid restrictions. Right people gathering going house ever before. Plus set RECORDS amount tourists visiting area. forget 200,000+ dead Americans, millions got sick, long haulers continued symptoms, economic impact.

That would valid comparison normal 2.2 million people die per day 1864.

The reason number casualties civil war shocking represented large number population. reasonable comparison would need lose 318,000 people per day Covid even closely related loss national mean literally every single one settlement called city, no.

Tourists valuable. well-treated even misbehave. 

There tourist crowd, expat crowd. Yes, quality lower variety less considerable motion.

You'd shocked many people successfully live foreign countries lives limited income never learn words local language.

If smile lot, unthreatening, piss people off, nice old people kids, fine nearly everywhere world, absolutely including Muslim countries.

You need study pisses people off. example, spent time Indonesia, _never_ identify atheist, never ever ever. People think eat babies. people might well ask religion - asking personal questions taboo. one ask (possibly learned caution parts) prepared claim Buddhist.

---

To take reverse side question! - life revolves around sophisticated social scene, moving pretty harsh.

I moved Amsterdam New York City late 2016. expected would lot less scene here, expect ""a lot less"" was. Maybe going somewhere I'm seeing it, think so. spent tiny amount time Berlin ""scene"" could follow. Amsterdam expensive middle class! 

If moving Siem Reap wherever, scene proportionately limited.

I'm older guy spent long time art music scene I'm fine tradeoff, still stings bit. true friends here, they're fairly reclusive. lot email videoconferencing. decades' worth friends New York City Berlin (many came NYC).

But then, everything stopped slowed anyway.

I would say, ""Do it!"" Figure way without pushing financial corner, go! bit cushion portable way make money stay years one place, maybe go somewhere else. Worst case, end back America wife (husband, etc) like friend five years Indonesia. mean they’re one got elected first place. lot people America believe nation built Christian beliefs values. bad internet? Coulda fooled me.  I'm American living abroad America suck, want say fuck Europeans lol guys shit That’s works 😂 said internet made people better informed ?

This place shithole kind contradictory information. best, strengthen beliefs instead changing them. part makes question atheism.

Literally nothing short incontrovertible proof higher that. Atheism something faith in. question it? without clear indicator author's intent, impossible create parody extreme views obviously exaggerated cannot mistaken readers sincere expression views parodied. Easy find toxic places like counties greatest populations still phase 1. :( Findings also suggest immunity could last pretty long too. Go visit sure. would gladly spent holidays US lot enthusiasm, live? shudder thought. Capitalism gone rampant anything profit mentality. mean can't even trust eating killing longterm. even consider Trump factor.

I really feel decent people there. Many countries - even USA - lists notifiable diseases must reported government occur. Strange COVID get mention except Hong Kong. romans build political legal system stable

They didn’t even clear act succession lol. Aw I’m sorry guys apart, know hard is! definitely easier process married couple vs fiancé visa, latter restrictive. Hope works get reunited soon :) Profile checks know looks countries happens to, mean they're correct way. I'm saying popular perception misses nuances objective truths hold. 

People shitting US ages, nothing new. second wave started schools opened France. Early reports infections caused people returning work.

Despite set work home seeing work successfully lockdown, large employers insist people coming back office anyway. assumption coordinated strategy save businesses rely society working way lockdown.

Thats theres second wave France places like that. 

News media best convince people live life. Post virus, get spun lockdown fatigue deliberate policy. Im currently trying convince wife visting *Disneyland* pandemic irresponsible. friends rolling eyes try explain precautions French society taken prevent virus spreading working wouldnt seeing exponential increase cases.

I explain everyone know unsafe irresponsible believe statements repeated everywhere France ignore infections since deaths low moment.

It going hard convince people change month two thousands dying again. like hard convince people wear masks lying masks use. Can't can? unfortunate. there's one thing country effectively, indoctrinating children believe America righteous unparalleled greatness. I'm assuming grown up. time test whether beliefs founded reality. subtle really subtle Foundation reference.  That's plan. said fuck went back school knowing I'll pay it, wont.

Either country gets better get universal education healthcare, gets worse collapses. point fine either fight either outcome, cant stuck middle. purgatory. But, spread well. controls, spread widely older people around filling hospitals. agree you. takes years, maybe *decades* get enforceable action. We’ve gone really far woods we’re even sure lost way. Grandpa always ""really good ideas"", always voted. Hopefully pandemic change World's weird aversion challenge trials. So, pagan civilization?

That's awkward. Yep. read effective approach. Like showing anti-vaxxers effects getting vaccinated. Videos women weeping children died preventable diseases. It’s valid point, think discussed Biden gets White House. then, effort getting in. Herd immunity thought 60-70% findings suggesting immunity possibly doesn’t last long person would consider second wave New York likely, rapid first one slow could prevent dangerous consequence corona: massive stress hospitals. go even this: Mom dad mean know anything! Mine extremely sweet (he told genius solved issue making editable copy something Google Drive) even 9 years old, tends assume know anything. told random fact world, we're maliciously withholding information. they're sending best Butt stuff Fuck CCP well Why? give flying fuck numbers speak themselves, USA 2 million fucking active-cases fucking INDIA!!

I think could seasonal virus worse cold weather. warm nations really severe outbreaks lots deaths (in proportion amount population infected)? entire continent Europe twice population America, half many cases 11,000 deaths. better us, they'd twice many cases twice many deaths. repeatedly called media ""the enemy people"" got downvoted saying social distance forever  adjusted percentage account population demographics. 

So basically, dialysis patients accurate representation population basis demographics - age, gender, race, location, etc. adjust things giving groups tested less weight basis many people whole country part demographic group. 

Unfortunately, good way adjust match risk level, behavior, health (like rates seroconversion) total population, done. yeah lets test poors first Paint wall brains. cant keep placebo approve vaccine.  Like poster said, I'll pass too. bother want bother either Apples oranges. HSH, non medical admin ran place cliff covid.  covid hit, LOCKED PPE 'hoax'. wrote employees bought own. one earliest outbreaks US, late February. 

When hit, initially unrecognized tried cover cases. went far hiding bodies. staff sick mid March slowly began combining units. last week military took building, gave orders put infected uninfected open ward together. 

There report already admin said matter, dead anyway. bully totally unqualified. 

Not saying Cuomo need looked situations different. 

This public. outside provider infected there. refrain saying would give nightmares. ignore asbestos.

Edit: JOKE: get vaccinated, vaccinate kids, pets 0.17% New Yorks population died IFR 0.5% low gets western population. IFR drops countries younger population Though I'm terrified. waking nightmare.  wonder: drop largely due tourism (as many claim), 11.5% come from? tourism like Q3/Q4 2019. Yes, already shit? problems pop group get vaccine, would good compare side side group got placebo exact time. truly concur vaccine causing side effects. Brazil might lol  read replies twitter account think selected God rule nation. number downvotes get number people Trust hard care this... pattern we've seen over. Disbelief, spikes eventually masks. due leadership issues, quarantine fatigue among general population, mixture both? hope so. Though lot rural counties taking pretty hard. seem laxer attitude whole thing. least state. Smallpox arguably worst 500 Million deaths 20th century. people use car several hundred times year way. mother February, tested positive antibodies 2 weeks ago. 

My stepdad time. tested positive April July negative 2 weeks ago (he took 2nd confirm).

Their cases exactly mild, require hospitalization. Covid aware time thought ""California Flu"" got sick CA family business (they live OK). kind resent sentiment. “We” didn’t bring upon ourselves. People standing risking lives fight bullshit. 

When hear “we” makes angry, younger civil minded populations blame game.

Edit clarity.  Covid disproportionately affects poor yes care poor rich Serious question: so? masks, mutation virus, example? Russia Iran documented large outbreaks especially dubious numbers, reason single out. ironic, one protesting safety reasons?

I think many people like would streets protesting, helping local stores enforce mask policy, risk getting infecting things.

But mean look sub versus evil twin sub wife kept Summer/Fall schedule clear could canvas, attend events election. we're online/phone banking/post cards. Population Canada around 38 Million.

No idea many doses vaccine needed. Thank posting this. concrete data optimism gives little bit much needed hope 1 billion doses estimated end 2021. Signed deal 100 million doses US 1 billion $10 each. Side effects range irritation redness around injection site mild fever goes away one two days. completely norm vaccines. 

Obviously need wait phase III data far good. think all. America brought themselves, seem want 4 years. all, seemingly good many. think gauntlet vaccines went basic. Whopping sore arm understatement. America loves socialism. instead typical social benefit programs, America's socialism redistribution wealth bottom up. happens states gonna way bigger issues miscounting Covid infections deaths. Whaaaaa? long term effects care group get vaccine. long term effects placebo pretty well documented. cities, maybe. Everywhere else, doubt masks stick around. 50-60% effective vaccine (at 40%, approved all) still gets ~30% boost population immunity going top ~15% population-wide immunity overcoming infections. leave much room spread virus. fraud? article states nothing wrong. Except would fasted approved vaccine human history. see long term effects until, well, long term. Floridian, stay fuck away Hello Russia. I've noticed thats ok. Russia call kind people liberal opposition. ashamed russians always try act like russians. always happy country fails something.

Youre also completely ignoring statistical significance dying isnt great bar.

We're looking world ***now***, like like be. also sense piece shit supports cops killing black men. could die vaccination.  vaccine might job die anyway.  die something else.  

Welcome club... happens. Assuming America sure turn fascist dictatorship self fulfilling prophecy. still time. Go vote, encourage friends vote. Protest. Burn shit do. Sitting Reddit day whining that's fall apart actively anything prevent pathetic embarrassing. I'm even American really ""get ready"" anything. realize personal decision.

There's little net loss. things cater international tourists car hire struggling tourism industry better places outbreaks.

But rebound people burning disposable income they'd saved lockdowns. Band-aid 2 Tylenol paper cup It’s called mikvah, they’re extremely hygienic places. probably know (and confirm fact high risk activity transmission) making proclamations “needs stop.” Unless fact high risk (which, proper procedures place, seems unlikely), *doesn’t* need stop. 

Decisions made based sound evidence, based feelings assumptions “safe” “dangerous.” lot governments let end.

They power now. Let's see actually give back.

Lock everyone another year. Let's see survives get out.

Welcome Costco, love you. could afford to, would’ve moved country months ago. don’t feel safe anymore. People truly believe ridiculous things. Multiple people told COVID sign end times. weeks later people tell COVID truly big deal die, time go God needed them. hate living here. True. Even pets US better life people earth. Sadly Americans never realise privilege. yet support death penalty 🤷‍♂️ India quadruple population US. spoken. Yes really trust J&amp;J will, we'll accelerate vaccine, ans become endemic due population growth. daily thread full skeptics. worry downvotes. wouldn’t add since serial testing. seen false positives throughout testing regiment. democratic presidential nominee centrist whole life tough crime AG running mate. radical left? might work, require lot people die first. Historically willing pay kind price, disease eradicated herd immunty absence vaccine before, people like dying. That's precisely know *really* believe it. 

If Trump gained power ancient Rome premodern state actually took religion seriously, got struck fires, plagues, record numbers hurricanes year, he'd lost Mandate Heaven 5 times supporters would terrified utterly demoralized now. They'd sacrificing dozens white oxen desperation burying people alive temples. There'd like 3 4 pretenders challenging authority getting support army. someone send Amazon link best kind mask buy? asbestos Look goalposts move. Nice. (a little earlier though) understand.

I feel guilty something every second day. Guilty beliefs grew up, guilty positive carbon footprint, guilty enough stand facing now. Guilty small misstep ideal Covid behavior. Guilty useless depressed even though I’m still healthy good job. Guilty scared spite privilege.

If makes feel better, therapist says guilt socially constructed, unnatural emotion. it’s sign current worldview beyond past performance, sign growth, acknowledged let go  smell baby shampoo best! tears? Moved Canada successfully 2016. Best decision ever made. recently Charlotte ... almost bad Florida live. Mask wearing indoors visible poorly managed. People don’t distance line.

70+: 1 19 die Make shotski em It’s still 10% population, 3 million new known cases since then. Thanks! Noem couldn’t even explain basic premise virus works. Bro, fucking comparison joke. HIV incurable STD killed 40 million people takes considerable amount intent transmit. COVID respiratory virus 99.8% survival rate easily transmitted accident without mask. want create registry people like think politically annoying like Nazis Jews. literally justified ""identifying people danger public""- trying do. fact sarcastic honestly fucking disturbing. averages 10-12k influenza deaths time flu season.

We shut society nonsense. good news. Still requires lot time though. disappointed integrity sought undermined,"" Ms Mikakos said statement via Twitter Saturday morning.

It left accord went looking trouble? Also people rant ""war police"" ignoring year 35 officers killed ""gunfire"" 135 killed Virus Shall Named. Also, sting eyes, like leading brands. lot people’s lives ruined really bad flu season I've always said vote ticket complain. vote, get complain. deep philosophical truth came Homer Simpson, ""don't blame me, voted Khodos."" Based monkey trials always thought one looked like one best. terrible time alive. acknowledging aftermath sickness dying (it HUGELY impacts work force since care economic points). 

You’re also comparing apples oranges lottery. One winning money dying. Small odds still mean large swaths deaths we’re scale 20 million people. means 2000+ dead per month (one 9/11) Florida’s current rate needs ~142 proper mandates like CT.

Also fact math 100% correct 14x likely die COVID Florida absolutely fucked statistic late game. 70x without taking account population indeed pointless statistic agree. can’t teach empathy dude. best friend’s young dad ICU vent 74 days. lived fuck that. He’s rehab still, still can’t work. Socialism - THEE! - Scrooge McArshole know country even top 20 racist countries world?

Especially Oxford/AZ. think convince them, possible either a) never contagious throughout b) actually super contagious hours, family got lucky get infected. average person normally 10% 30% chance infecting household members, see Table 3 testing done July. Anyone following [Youyang Gu's note July 15th model estimated 9.3% prevalence, nearly *exactly* estimated prevalence study. Pretty incredible modeling job ask me.

Based this, current prevalence (as Sept 25th) 15.7%. Fixed. 

Still, despite double population US, India half covid deaths 5/7ths cases. live 😢 Sauce? Sorry ask repeat yourself, makes R(t) estimate cases bad? serves reminder fitting exponential curve, it. hahah bf lives Australia I'm like 👀 I’d careful grandparents. risk age group it’s typically advised much contact. Please exercise caution. covid deniers dig mass graves.

That's powerful punishment. first lady noted Friday masks available ""social distancing encouraged!""



I told deniers encouraging masks social distancing equivalent slavery concentration camps. Certainly life anyone would want live! theatre sheeple. Murica. Freedumbs!


When armed maskless protesters arrive get everyone's faces?


/$ get killed, jailed fired liking butt stuff actually. responsible adult bringing kids fucking theme park pandemic. hardly surprising. Desantis made shitty bed gets sleep it.  Please leave want here. understand perfectly actually, comment. That’s Russia paid it. Don’t trust Russia anything Maybe correct spelling “Untied” along. complete hogwash. actually read details G mutation.... know one going since March prominent one US. horseshit article promote F.U.D. nah, proletariat get pay it. Well - think radical leftism also partially blame? mean, I'd blame Trump office, divisive identity politics. Especially ""NO"" civil war starts. Thats good/valid point. seem directives verifying fall tiers. see real deployment disaster. Hope I'm completely wrong.... belong here. want out. eject button? mean, probably touch low, there's way we've got 4-10x undercount. 

Even wanted attribute 100% excess deaths COVID (which think really reasonable guess), still would 40% confirmed. we'd counting 3 5 deaths worst, I'd guess really probably 3 4 (but that's guess).  researcher, you’d think dream scenario, many underlying factors like testing availability, classification COVID death, false positive rates, etc. it’s nearly impossible compare states standards. Don’t forget suggested deserves third term spied Obama nonsense. I've unemployed since March. job, industry really, coming back long time. poor leadership, would already crisis turned catastrophe. 

Probably homeless December sort relief. think half country fire, mass rioting, government becoming totalitarian monstrosity rigs elections gives socialistic policies 1% opposed lower/middle classes, right vote jeopardized, 201,000+ deaths disease apparently ""virtually affects nobody"", looming threat civil unrest reach critical point near future. Um, wow. There's need dignify response, I'll let leave there. Okay. what. Can’t make shit dunno. mean Scream like untouchable cornerstone classic cinema. want it. Absolutely. Cases deaths way reported, recoveries way reported. Gives everyone feeling a) bad, back work school.... little flu b) government great job. Thank you. least people confident wearing masks, infect possibly cause someone else's death.

Would worse cause someone's death able see person's facial expression solely mouth? much really missing seeing someone's mouth?

You paint picture something like that, yet also online interacting people without seeing/hearing expressions/vocal tone. must bleak paint be. Show major pharmaceutical company *hasn't* done something like that?

I'm defending them, saying...the options great looking clean record. Well, bad apples every profession. Politicians, police, doctors. OH, yes, racist doctors too. seen new ""doctor"" COVID task force, Scott Atlas? guy total loser. professional opinions ""politically motivated"" plastered across whole nine yards. Even colleagues grilled crap him.  entire Bay Area moving ahead would mean cases positivity trends dropped however. actions might lead things rising back up, would course new trend certainly doesn’t seem likely time weeks later given latency step.

Edit: also, think things spike, logically would change opening rules metrics rather moving ahead data. It’s like would first time state made adjustment them. It’s like waking nightmare. Reading article makes living U.S. feel even worse, good reason. anything good comes entire situation fixing political system people like become president, least long. Thank you! a) indonesia

b) india's response horrendous. actually indonesia's self-taught anything commendable, especially virology far one's subject expertise long reliable representative sources used. someone health field, I'd hope people would want continue learning infectious diseases diseases general even over. people ? nothing really. quite fond cancer powder sounds like it’s great young crowd, elderly elicit immune response....and fact sounds pretty mediocre best old crowd.

Maybe use one healthy young ppl find another vaccine old young dummy mind pity long they’ll let sane Americans emigrate countries away shithole. Re-election chances actually extremely low point. say can't happen obviously, would definitely bank it. IMO They've put long could state insolvency mass bankruptcies. state us getting killed due tourism shit. probably last hail mary diving depression. herpies too. Spain uniquely mismanage theirs? middle rapid 2nd wave. said France. way excusing US management virus. largely left individual states. unique mismanagement. 

This morning:

Spain’s Covid response plunged real though, best even joke shit. really antivaxers latch onto literally anything might aid furthering delusions (even jokes fly head). Without semi lockdown would tripled deaths You’re cardboard rocket  actually kind surprising since Florida caught much later. New York hit country protocols place. took one narcissist big mouth unravel 250 years democracy (plus sycophants built landing strip him). Neat. Damn Hong Kong already third wave? Wonder wave Canada would done end war Pacific? Like except jail others pointed out, merely quoting title.

By know distinguish US countries. Case numbers US comparatively high, means deaths rear-view mirror, closer herd immunity.

My view driving spread US minority people, genuinely care, others higher risk. minority spreaders taken probably slowly approaching herd immunity. That, combined cautious majority, good news containing virus distant future. say vaccine, mean something take one time, something regular, perhaps, annual, basis? live? Lol jk picky Yeah, guess what, haven’t found, can’t report lmao. want do? Give day day reports best guess many might undiscovered? like tone. read rooms ritual practiced windowless many women visit day. add measle outbreak among community. also lived close community lived Brooklyn, would paint bike lanes want women riding neighborhood shorts. cases, law unto themselves.

So ventilation many surfaces contact? measle outbreak? Infants contracting herpes Rabbi's? Wanting unaccountable island metropolis 10 million people? 

Just wanted stricter oversight christian megachurches attendance. feel religions feel ritual violates covid protocol addressed proper authorities.

These folks, need monitored like everyone else. look history added probably NJ quite ago. believe ones eliminated investigation added confirmed, stopped listing separately. realize 95% people feeling sorry Americans living overall Worse conditions Americans? problems, doubt. we’re also still great folks. hope world forgive us rid madness. Oh boy can’t wait asbestos injected directly veins. boys think happen? Ovarian cancer, breasts?? Addiction???/s I'm literally using India (Indonesia) low point express exactly fucked US is.

But jump great...and coincidentally close sharp fall saw fires itself. news going many testing centers closed due poor air quality.

Lots businesses closed. imagine there's probably decent backlog tests they're working now. worried unless numbers remained significantly elevated next Friday.

Still, always, practice caution. freak out...yet. Careful. Covid loves butt stuff. going get today, mom mentioned fauci said wait mid October. guess I'll stay home two weeks. Ah well. butt stuff deal, psychologist, support message. it’s working you, it’s working share concern, think sentiment bit ridiculous. I.e., everything nice jolly sudden Trump things got bad. Trump take us trillion dollar disaster Iraq. Trump create mess Libya, create super unpopular time healthcare reform let extensive loses Democratic party 2010, 2012 2014. fact, loses main reason Trump power enact laws wants Senate became Republican 2014. Trump entered political process. whole ""Arab Spring"" epic disaster largely forgotten, even though created enormous instability Middle East contributed mass refugee Western Europe, led widespread right-win election victories EU.

This happens elect fucking meme President United States finishing idea happened. start people need most, regardless leaders are?  Sanders centrist. Democrats support drone strikes civilians, market-based healthcare, subsidies big business, racist crime bills. America progressive party. Kith shit please omg us cult Identity politics ""hey please people treating us like shit"" all. hate-filled vindictive, morally defective grotesquely hypocritical. 

It's people colour saying hate white people complaining racism, women saying hate men, complaining sexism? 

How fail notice this? N95 Surgical/medical masks Cloth masks Haha actually doubling hating condoms

What fuck wrong Clearly man takes dumpfs leadership, lack thereof. Doesn’t mean didn’t get elected due votes big number Americans. Blaming Russia election exonerates huge amount US citizens (or were) a-ok Trump. kick warn him? Costco pretty strict that. Oof. Well, still American response still laughable. CA upbringing. hate seeing resources wasted something one wants.

(Of course. kid. 4 Bluray. 3&amp;4 like Matrix 2 &amp; 3, SW 1-3; soul demands reject existence. without 3&amp;4, 5.) say that. 70% us held hostage lunatic fringe !remindme 30 days would pay tons money get marriage convenience. Butt curious refugee Literally that’s what’s going fair, India quadruple population quarter space, population density 8 times US.
And India still developing nation, accounts. still decently. 2 month lockdown unprecedented executed amazingly well. Can't say US. tourists still going spend much International Travelers. international Travelers going come back trust Florida safe either going banned going strict quarantine requirements make effectively worthless go Florida. Florida government seems think act like big deal governments case. points made totally understand. 

What absolutely never understand California require in-bound travelers quarantine 14 days like states implemented long ago (NJ fur example). definitely shouldn’t be. That's pretty optimistic, yes, overall rate would suggest something much higher, appear significant strides made mitigation.

That is, course, assuming speaking metaphorically. everyone got infected right now, health care systems would entirely overwhelmed. Flattening curve basic necessary strategy exists.

Plenty us seen first hand results this, simply enough refrigerated trucks us make mistake simultaneously. Yeah fuck shit. I'm saying get it, definitely qualify get first. us deserve it. us never voted party even whole lives... empire lasts forever. Instead barbaric tribes, Russian hackers. sucker homemade tortilla... UK, hovering right around 1% August/Sep, 7%. USA around 1.8% Sep.

Edit: said ""moving"" - heading direction likely reach next months. fact approval rating insane us Europe. Death rate equal US civil war. Protests cities. respect global scene - gone, maybe even good. Democracy moral values thrown aside obsolete ""post truth world"" ""alternative Facebook facts"" - Europe simple seen crooked, weak plain dumb. 
And yet still - half sees problem fact vote guy. guy zero virtues, flaws. Unbelievable. Fuck. That’s perspective. ignorant, dog whistle statement. anyone believes trash, pity them. Fools forgotten failures, lot them. Social media destroyed internet. used connect mostly intelligent people intelligent people (or weird sex fetishes). connects morons morons.

Maybe others better. heard, press enemy people. /S 853k 2.3 million?

Edit: could make depressing game show. Look man coukd wronf I’m pretty certain read today it’s two month wait.

At least, FDA probably require two month wait last dose, even I’m wrong, original point J&amp;J vaccine could review still stands Same, literally today. got email owner company saying we've hemorrhaging money last 6 months. record year last year doors would already closed. effort save company cutting salary 25% across board.

Sprinkle little dog-like loyalty dubbed patriotism lot people embracing bad idea they're proud admit America problem.

At least myself, care people caught problem, seen many Americans staunchly defend country/insult countries legitimate issues america has.

When hear number 200,000, picture Trump saying US ""the biggest numbers"" bunch overweight supporters eating US propaganda screaming ""U.S.A! U.S.A!""

I hope country get shit together, feel individuals country trying get circus. republicans demonstrating bipartisanship work drive boat. aint gonna fix problems create problems facing exponential climate disasters pandemic. cant find middle ground non fact based policies. Yeah, governments care live die, nothing new there. plenty potential ways govts support people crises like these. neoliberal govt anyway near capable achieving (or wanting all). 

I've seen plenty people around whose jobs affected still complain restrictions. Obviously talking people lost employment, fuck's sake.

And case. comfortable people dying need pay rent, that's still horrible mind. True, India can't really contain virus. think ever could, given is. wait vaccine rollout. due stupidity people India high numbers, inherent disadvantages. second. data makes quite Nope real actual problem  fucking know Yeah, low positivity rate strange exactly jive findings. huge sample size either still pretty astounding results. wonder cycle threshold Japan uses PCR tests. Low viral loads + lower detection threshold perhaps. really sure. Nope educate yourself. Hasidic community wields incredible political power people actually live NYC know it. Learn ""Democrat"" [Simcha holds progress entire Democratic party NY hostage unless demands Hasidic constituency met.

And question answers itself: openly held religious gatherings hundreds people public pandemic worst thing happened shamed Twitter. Zero arrests. Zero legal consequences. That's political power. Got spare room? think means they’ll stage coup successfully. guess become like you? Thats worst part. clear majority apparently listening us ""mob rule"" masses idiots waving Trump flags ""real Americans"" deserve power reasons. surprised see Philly fan. rambling about?

Trump breaking norms left right *in addition to* actually breaking laws. biggest check power, impeachment, joke hyperpartisan era. Trump, guilty sin caught red-handed soliciting election interference Ukraine, exonerated Republicans Senate without hearing single witness reviewing single document. 

If Trump another 4 years office, erode what's left American democracy nothingness. LOL feel sorry people read New York Times. first time European colony New World collapsed due stupidity. even longest-lived. Hello fellow Australian.

You definitely go finally get COVID control. amazing place incredible food (mostly) friendly people welcome open arms. Granted, they'll mostly want talk America maybe never ask Australia. said, meantime, never run sights see country. Sadly, that's at. 100% solution, see adding already abundant population neglected unwanted kids increasing services provide helps, either. take abortion equation, add hundreds thousands kids already fractured system. 

People want protect life born folks cry tax dollars used provide lives. “younger civil minded generation” age majority low voter turn out. definitely brought shit? been?? gonna roll fantastic healthcare plan? LOT crap mixed in.

But Yeshua Nazareth preached message would fix world everyone followed it. okay... carry real honest God gun? it’s seemingly fed social media’s buzz words idiot memes. It’s regurgitating crap put bots sowing division.

Edit: word often wonder many people believe mainstream masks (cloth simple surgical) meant protect don’t care unprotected.

I used assume made clear everyone masks keep spreading that’s work everyone wears one. day finally got argument older woman always see walking dog. two brats it’s like they’re following around park joke. doesn’t distance humble surgical mask finally snapped told keep selfish maskless ass block away dog. don’t come park avoid antisocial people like her. stared genuinely asked bothered much didn’t mask, would rather risk catch *it didn’t affect me* all.

Then hit me.

Maybe they’re psychos. Maybe think “oh that’s nice people don’t want catch wear masks. hate life anyway”. Hiccups...Covid! 14 day quarantine! /S release already lol...but real long out? 6 months? know why? cases rapidly increasing now. good job before, there's really safe way end point. know people distraught put effort stay home see family friends spreading rapidly anyway. would say decently anymore technically *most* people vote, voter turnout 58.1% nothing write home about. Well, best luck you. Also don’t Canada, socialized health care rush quickly butt stuff tear something. Pretty well known... exactly?? many TVs scare/stress point getting sick? 2 teams outbreaks start season since false positives, looked like shitshow first season jeopardy, I'm willing bet players took precautions home theres literally millions dollars line. Yup moving Mexico Lol. claim refugee we'll actually pay come here.... world needs stay lane mind business. Yes, I'm particularly amused parents freaking actually take care kids *all day every day* now. Life's crapshoot. kids risky. may stop working pay babysitter whatever get once-a-century global pandemic. People expect lives always work perfectly way wanted to. 

That reality. Many people learning hard way right now. Good night too! Yes, also, shouldn’t watch show Netflix realize social media evolved monster needs put down. It’s extremely obvious addictive nature rampant false information social media needs neutered. Uhhh.... time become one “reputable” companies shady business practices (JnJ) 

The downside industry they’re deals peoples physical well instead trivial tech related purchases.... Hillary Obama rest world going remember whole country based people sick shit everywhere else world. created precisely different everybody else doing. Sex education, free birth control, healthy economy. Start there. seriously, watch Trump's press conference, they'd think America great pandemic, whereas rest world watching what's happening US shock; supposed lead rest countries disaster take guy least put sentences together thank much...

Sure irritating. mostly that's it. got thinking less stupid shit true real. Stopping putting entire existence perspective, thanks Dengue. Many exposed Dengue there's line thought may cross-immunity. Sounds like trump, except wants take away everyone’s healthcare. Nice try though, kiddo. Supersize it. police raided wrong house. boyfriend start it? Neither committed crime. country process destroyed, yes. think people protesting, really easily distracted. know really sucks? Moving developing nation hopes better life........ countries Europe added rules back place control second wave... none lockdown. feel like don’t understand lockdown is/was you’re confusing rules April lockdowns.. feel sorry Americans, they've yuge fifth column country known Democrats. Masks work folks! Considering treat refugees? Doubtful): Except Roman Empire didn’t nukes military create world full collateral damage :-( truly wish luck. go, please send help...  mean it, I'll take deal. I'm Seattle, lost great-paying job May, took old job used healthcare June I'm tired spit on, kicked, cured worse trying help people. paycheck third was, longer healthcare see getting better. I'd make work Canada I'd able see doctor broken glasses. I've stopped talking Trump-supporting family years ago, family left farm burn mere weeks ago they're homeless too. 

I'm happy never coming back happy springing good half-dozen people know flee across Canadian border we're longer allowed cross. Amazingly colleges require sorts liberal arts courses improve people's minds make better citizens somehow course logic one them. said again... Woof, anyone brings Monty Python puuuurfecct me! tell live Yorkshire nice flat... OoooooooooahhOooooooh! Bible refer false prophet? Well country somehow normalized everything dinosaurs can’t taught schools, astrology, climate change denial, antivax. 
The anti-intellectualism runs deep every person participated across political spectrum blame. 
Normalizing one fuckhead stupid idea allows else normalize another. remember beginnings public internet, believing humanity's knowledge would lift everyone greater heights (I mean REALLY believing) watched figured curating fear drives astonishing profits side effect living alternate reality. 

Not sure goes here, even post Trump.  Thats Trump succeeds. talks simple terms simple people. hear think, understand this. big word mumbo-jumbo fancy people talking about. 

I feel bad america. terrible culture, terrible entitled ppl think world revolves around them. killing poor planet innocent animals well. disgusting race downfall. Single Aussie Melbourne! whole 12 cases today! (We r lockdown tho hopefully much longer!!) How? miracle? Like idiot president said rona would go away? Lol it’s way simpler brush another country better factors control like weather, follow steps countries followed prevent spread horror! Fun fact: California larger population Canada. cult then? Russia doctor defenestration epidemic well helps explain official counts far off. Including one course.  god real, fake ass holier thou dumbasses would receiving good graces. he'd taking us instead. would heaven. People given tools ready use. like giving guns toddlers.

Shit gonna get fucked up. Probably entertainment related. know reasonable number people involved promoting enabling live events (concerts, plays, sort thing) , scene basically destroyed. Mike Judge prophet warned us Vote. Vote. Vote. problem there's internet. echo chambers exist due algorithms social media show want see hear.

Cant believe guy JAG worked Seals. political office way military service American health care? Yes actually pay attention, Biden does. Trump one who's words argued upon daily meaning spouts random insane bullshit lies. think Trump better leader misled even human anymore cultist robot. 

Pity gone disgust. Support president wearing logos like racecar human equivalent dog rolling back showing stomach. thoughts personal strength, cowardice giving intelligence logic reality star con man tells think. 

I wish stupidity would equal measure pain incorporated. Maybe would wake up. Dem, lib. Fuck anyone votes Trump 2020. compromised disgusting. medical professionals Florida put it?

Depends ones. According covid hoaxer family, ""I friend friend works hospitals says nobody covid unit, over, good"". I'm tired science denying, brain dead fuck heads actively trying kill mom. feel sorry fellow Americans rational, sane, humans. Wow know Bubonic far back. reason know black deat plague Justinian.

Really thinking hard putting dual citizenship use lol feel stupid sooner. Whenever use Canada example, nation ""got right"", everyone tells fair compare difference population. There's never good answer people, always money ""freedoms"" nations figured shit cry it. privileged Americans, truly ignorant buy headline...

Also, many pathetic Americans throwing pitty party comments. 9/10 white privileged anime nerds live parents idea they're talking about. dont live USA maternal language spanish. really give fuck think English good enough Well, no, Trump god awful he'd never chance without good decades spent undermining system. Fox literally came prevent next Nixon removed. system already maintained violence destruction police state. Without police violence, lines rich poor would never maintained. would homelessness, anybody could find empty home move in. would hunger, instead us throwing away 30% food produce maintain artifically high prices corporate profit, people could go grab food they're hungry. violence deprives us basic needs forces us work capitalists, class society gets everything good reason. destroys lives. That's want burn old system make one suck, nothing lose. George Carlin called He’s forcing anyone go outside

OK, person working somewhere employer back normal means requirement social distancing/masks/etc. make lives many people, especially vulnerable people, quite dangerous. one thing work home matter free choice. need work office restaurant, hotel, bar, etc., want safe. pandemic FL far over. help also America many things government control rents out.

North America dig heels defend democracy, continent- wide.  scenario we've got coasts, well north south.

Viva America, Eh? Take pinche hosers. cases going India, deaths also plateaued? Like event like that: series things. Drought. Massive influx refugees, raiders, alien cultures causing internal division. Earthquakes. Volcanoes. Civil unrest. Famine.

The idea one event easy deal with. once? much. also lot deaths probably went unaccounted for. huge percentage population poverty deaths probably never counted. everyone. I’m moderna want one shown safe effective Look murder totals number shootings year.

The testing occured July. 

The results varied significantly standardised US dialysis population, seroprevalence ranged 3·5% (3·1–3·9) west 27·2% (25·9–28·5) northeast. Comparing seroprevalent case counts per 100 000 population, found 9·2% (8·7–9·8) seropositive patients diagnosed. Yes, much likely neuter EC anything else.

I think it’s important point darker skin getting sunlight lot harder. Look chart page. Also varies weight. whole article pretty informative. also made warnings vitamin sound overblown. goto doctor find need.

Definitely check make sure you’re taking much, people checked levels now, would deficient, especially darker skin. Actual cases people much rare, people taking huge doses. good thing companies test vaccines comorbidities immuno-compromised since groups first targeted receive vaccine?

You never know force someone ""willingly"" accept infected virus test vaccine. may coerced it. Especially start offering 200 bucks poor people.

I would gladly volunteer shot virus vaccine order test it. let idiots ruin everything.  doctor dose blood work every 3 months get plenty sunshine levels right normal/high normal.

I asked prescribes lower dosages patients said depends blood work, he's never life seen ANYONE overdose Vitamin puts patients high 100,000 IU per day.

Can elaborate ""major problems"" high dose cause? doc never experienced anyone ""major problems"" Vitamin supplementation. People Third Reich nice folks, by-and-large. Even actual nazis often friendly gentle folks.

I tell husband look say ""It's tuma!"" fairrrrr ""not fast"" - american really wants visit canada again, would like give plague Nobody going outside much early days pandemic, especially places total lockdown like Europe. I’m going limb say people say don’t symptoms get tested it’s quicker convenient. taking medications time, especially birth control stop calling vitamin call sun already?! E allora dove sta la reale differenza tra Italia Francia e Spagna? Cosa ha fatto partire contagi li e non da noi? Io viaggio nei 3 paesi ogni settimana e non vedo tutta questa differenza nei comportamenti. Oh missed lol fast, 100% Canadians. people make laws going make law CEOs would get mad put someone else power. start obligatory Reddit movie quotes course! Make sense. there’ll tons people think trolls like think Covid-19 hoax. now. aren’t wearing masks? Today new episode ""Donald Trump saying stuff""... hospitals get overwhelmed. Whew! woke eyesight little bleary. thought said:

""Pope get Covid-19 vaccine first, Pope Francis says."" Shareholders equal stocks. don’t yet know % money went mandatory dividends given relative rarity compared traditional debt financing net income allocations shareholders rather dividend, it’s probably less 5% money, certainly less 10%. It’s bad thing money go shareholders. It’s different money going bank credit union, it’s different type financial contract. stock buybacks, supposed zero iirc, outlined could help specific type business overall it’s use private small/medium business I’d upset used 1-3% PPP money. Yea except winter coming schools reopening (hybrid model) still many people indoors. would also surprised see many people still aren’t wearing masks here. really struck meme saying ""compare life classmates decade on"" going around, pause realize, ""Wait, moved Germany, _so_ much better basically them!"" 

Baffled horrified two good words, yep. Maybe next time, elect someone pretty obviously one worst human beings world top leadership position country. People preexisting conditions get first. poor otherwise generally healthy wait. list best responding countries show many democracies. clear type government system simply matter. matters whether government wants something it.

If government care dealing it, ask want to. either intentional incompetence really care.

Like poster said, America capable organising war invasion requires incredibly complex logistics planning, deep pockets resources, top really good health care. 

It inconceivable can't beat back pandemic. think confusion people regards preventative measures vs treatment. Covid disease may rapidly deplete Vitamin levels. Since Vitamin critical proper immune function, supplementation helps lot. study posted someone shows much. 

The issue is, lot information people’s level getting infection. came first? people severe cases already low serum level disease rapidly deplete it? think it’s latter. 

So, opinion is, supplementing good idea get outside much. get infected important take vitamin D, C, zinc. becomes depleted fighting virus data suggest C well. Zinc inhibits viral replication common cold coronaviruses. Cold Eeze exists. known impacts SARS-COV2 way, possible. hear it?

No. What?


It’s vaccine truck coming street. Dr Fauci also said Vitamin deficient, supplement. 41 percent US citizens Vitamin deficient rates higher elderly. go Quebec?  Well environment one thing lack federal control states usa: situation must statistician's dream

As statistician, assure situation dream. Paywall free: vaccine available American wants best-guess range scientists, investors federal health officials first half next earlier Q4 2021, likely Q1-Q2. may ready frontline workers high risk people end 2020. That’s less certain though.

You don’t need downvote wrong. quick google search would worked. Same. science mixed Covid, vitamin cheap, going give problems taken reasonable amount comes yummy fruit flavored gummies. totally agree, personally can't think better system. Apparently body make maximum 10,000 IU daily turn production. Lots debate correct amount supplement. say don’t take 6000 IU others say taking 8000 IU daily. governments recommend 1000 IU. I’ve tested blood levels patients, taking high 2000 IU daily deficient Vitamin ideal amount must vary. opinion, take 2000-6000 IU daily check blood levels 1-2 times per year. Considering fact Minnesota cases entire country Canada yesterday, don’t see happening anytime soon. 
Remember Donald tried block shipments masks Canada..., DEA welcomes online confession. Would like go details grow lights? 😎 lights though...? Even people still hospitalized considered contagious cases, unless sustained fever. virus shed live form first days, afterward shed dead genetic fragments, infectious. See people upset anti-lockdown protests marches happening started beginning April?


Why take people several weeks get upset people allowed protest? TLDR: factors causing increase dreams.

1) big events tend result increase dreams across society: 9/11, late 1980s earthquake, etc.
2) people started different schedules March, started sleeping pandemic, could allow increase REM.
3) media could caused self-fulfilling prophecy reporting increase dreams, might cause people notice dreams more. terribly written article. read half thing without even knowing vaccine they're referring to. upfront said expansion high-risk groups given one several vaccines late stages phase 3 trials voluntary basis, already approved areas emergency use - would make whole thing sound less scandalous, let's push second half article. Gotta get sinister vibe nice early. Nice summary here:

""Low magnesium levels make vitamin ineffective

Up 50 percent US population magnesium deficient

Summary:
Vitamin can't metabolized without sufficient magnesium levels, meaning Vitamin remains stored inactive many 50 percent Americans. addition, Vitamin supplements increase person's calcium phosphate levels even remain Vitamin deficient. People may suffer vascular calcification magnesium levels high enough prevent says it, generally lie, unless accidentally blurts something incriminates himself. tends babble. Read up, mate. “point time” referring to?


""On **25 February**, authorities closed hotel Innsbruck one employees tested positive, means authorities reacted immediately case Innsbruck - capital province Tyrol - became known.

It’s totally unrealistic expect people physical interactions all. welcome post articles run counter opinions overwhelming majority scientists medical professionals. you’re agreeing confidence someone didn’t completely change argument. Neat might get flack saying this, we've shut hospitals get overwhelmed since March. hospitals still feet them, longer responsibility.

South Korea -- 52 million people!! -- fewer 12,000 cases (the US 7600 yesterday alone) 276 deaths (the US 203,000 deaths).

I've getting vitamin shots supplements years now, wonder that's why. I've always wondered never got contagious things. Maybe finally answer. experiment.

Not sure means relevant. points treatment possibilities people taking studies like mean taking supplements keep safe. 

This says 30 micrograms per day standard long term calcifediol supplements safe calcium levels closely monitored prevent bone study dosed patients 532 micrograms start doses 266 micrograms. seems fine hospital patients closely monitored treated week three, dangerous done long term preventative.

The study gave patients hydroxychloroquine promising time know actually worsens outcomes. possible calcifediol protected hydroxychloroquine negative effects instead covid19.

While study randomized controlled, dozen people random selection may put healthier people control group. 

Interesting read, thanks posting it. conclusive many reasons, suggestive in-hospital treatment options hopefully followup studies done statistical power. riots protests cause fire consequence, France would chaos since least 84 years. Riots/protests reaction problem (asking change). study purely correlative, there’s evidence yet taking supplements anything. Lack vitamin caused many things

Masks, social distancing, avoiding crowds, things outdoors instead indoors, good ventilation indoors, nutrition (vitamin legit), rest, avoiding chronic stress, etc. atm even US tourists welcome sound like reasonable risk factors virus. I'm sure translates higher risk disease though, mean factors may make someone likely contract virus likely symptoms require hospital care.

Worth noting factors also pretty much going go away next year. in, people currently kept safe WFH rules going next year.

Once start working, fully covered health insurance, maximum additinal payments 10 euro visiting doctors. Prescribed medicine also usually 5 euros. Everything kids free.

In larger cities, specially technical fields, one get speaking English, companies use official language duo native labor available.  understand people willing volunteer challenge trail help. it. 

Fucking stupid. pay people damn near anything except challenge trail that's ruining whole world. lol mad? covid numbers gonna blast there's nothing it, peebrain. don’t know, know vaccines aren’t effective elderly due weakened immune systems. Fun fact America, it’s close media portrays as. comes covid person know personally died old guy sexual offender pervert prison 25% use lungs got sick. I’ve never come crossed riot, I’ve never stopped working, life literally hasn’t changed fact wear masks every time go public.

He's Republican politicians supporting (all them) _cartoonishly evil_ would've ever expected see lifetime. absolute monstrous assholes every opportunity, even ways short-sighted they'll fuck everyone sheer greed viciousness.

A huge chunk _Americans_ part ""baffled world"", even saw grow around us like fungus. hard believe anyone stupid mean citizens, manage.

And cartoonishly evil except cartoon affecting real people's lives, health, future. Shit fucked people could fix feeling effects enough truly care. Skeeter, ain't hurtin' nobody... First go voting! may move out. Why? Cases per million higher western Europe rising That’s delusional think. fast track covid though? waiting period? Lots places going mass production trials conclude, hoping testing successful. totally reasonable long trials held reasonable standards. people running trials certifying vaccines real key ones here. older, cable-loving folks, bastion propaganda foaming mouthpiece fear &amp; hatred, Fox ""news"" Entertainment. forget shout O.G.'s Murdoch major contributing part shitmess last 30ish years.

Half America voted soundbite confessing sexually assaulting women. I'll take tombstone pepperoni. Almost key word. say that. We're suppose think antibodies dissappear months cells exist get reinfected virus.

C'mon part keep fear mongering going. Could catch it, would catch it. 


There currently approved vaccine. even one approved, available everyone next trying accurate possible who's already got many people need get get vaccinated slow many people need get ...... slow spread.



So, increase spread, slow spread?



So percentage population willing spread Covid-19 to, percentage die? attempt slow spread? I'm sure done they're easy population measure - they're getting blood work done regular basis. 

I think difficult determine might compare general population, actually think likely undercount overcount.

Reasons likely overcount:

-Dialysis patients hospital frequently therefore exposed people completely sheltering 

Reasons likely undercount:

-Patients higher risk probably likely shield much possible pay attention PPE 

-Dialysis patients measurably lower seroconversion diseases general population 

-Dialysis patients likely older, less likely essential jobs choose socialize (partially accounted demographic adjustment)

I may also missing factors well, ones immediately come mind. America today??? TODAY? Let's travel American time rich EVER held responsible Learning history helps us repeat it, important lesson right now. mention gives greater context literally everything experience life.

(The short answer is, often, yes.) **From there, particular order, Western analysts cite climate, demography, magic**. Africa hot, say sunny, humid. Sunlight, scientists argued, degrades virus, humidity (maybe?) slows down. Quite bit Africa isn’t actually humid, however, sun, like sun world over, seasonal. fact, several East African capital cities home majority country’s coronavirus cases, get downright cold.

Thank pbs kids thought shitty parent whole time tv tablet. saying US rigorous standards? neither slavery cruel/unusual. digging hole. Pretty basic civil service work. 

I'm really asking practices imposed, implying deniers much less talkative see damages done. two America’s you’re either one other. literally half country, (who college educated) making average 50-200k per year. people afford buy houses, medical care, pay student loans, cushy work home jobs get expense everything office. 50% America makes sure things run, farmers, fast food workers, retail workers, Amazon employees, Uber drivers, basically society’s bitches. medical care, access education, public transport system. Tell grown adult - 20 years old familial financial support system supposed mental capacity work 2-3 serving/retail jobs, go school, car, pay rent... that’s impossible. It’s crazy ridiculous many people push backbreaking labor literally making 7.25 hour. anytime fast food worker ever attitude, remind myself, make 7.25 hour, probably absolutely hate life. It’s really sad, we’ve effectively created two worlds America. One live coastal city beach access finest medical care food world. could stuck rural shithole closest hospital 10 miles away hope don’t need ambulance bad, food 20 mile radius processed, frozen, fatty. difference quality people’s lives sad astounding. flu kills hundreds children every year. curious think lockdown close schools avoid that? Agree made masks easy use Willingly accepting deaths fellow people personal comfort. Fuck world never ceases disappoint depress me. Baffling? heard Biden? Shame Democrats putting clearly sick old man stage. even became candidate what’s baffling. 

Trump hasn’t impressed lately either definitely express much coherently Biden. think otherwise, you’re delusional. Well age well... **208,440** today Sadly shit ton people reddit think US shithole 3rd world country actually believe it.

Indonesia really well. large group friends Indonesia online talk everyday, lot deny ever existed, confused conspiracy theories Bill Gates Trump side created covid form eugenics, believe traditional medicine (so, medicine) cure it, really low testing rates people think high there, etc. I've seen buy lots scam products claim repel covid ever infecting them. officially there, would say god protecting Indonesia getting it. prevent spread, literally hosed people chemicals, seems really dangerous harmful potentially human rights abuse me. kind money place like America does, even sort basic unemployments benefit place this, many people worked shouldn't, often unsanitary crowded conditions.

I even say better US. problem US developed country. Indonesia not. America major poverty, nothing comparable Indonesia's poverty, I'm poverty America. America financial means educational means good response good role model world, fact politics willful ignorance makes especially horrendous. also making lot worse rest world, including countries like Indonesia, leading way helping others way could be.

Oof.

You know shit. know thoughts read couple biased news articles. Fuck electrol college. Fall Rome Even algorithm show truth, believe lies already made mind. Can’t rapture go heaven without Antichrist, dontchaknow don’t understand it’s Donald Trump, moronic cartoon businessman. him? Sure, including butt-dry counties sandwiched conveniently two butt-wet counties even laws open butts moving vehicles. They'll make killing. Yes, someday CoVID19 lower fatality rate flu, it’s anytime soon almost certainly widespread utilization viable vaccine.

As people move indoors, relax precautions see things get bad again, many cold months happening beginning year don’t see 2021 flu deaths CoVID19 deaths.

There’s probably evidence pseudo herd immunity reached 17-30% infection plus distancing plus masks, keep basic precautions people done little whole time want even fewer precautions. think title said “near” Unfortunately, think default choice people willingly challenge views seek opposing ones. Especially easy ignore side days. requires active choice seek subreddits opposing views see Facebook groups supporting cause believe in. much easier hang back spend time corners internet agree with. think past least everyone kind saw read things newspapers tv.

Depends it? kneeling national anthem major statement - fans right say endorse vote ties dollars. actually hate, mostly LGBT community minorities.

Are sure? Gilette ad pretty derogatory towards men, Ben Jerry's saying Trump voters intrinsically bad? good look feel..., nothing LGBT minorities. tried going temp agency mean time?? always get work hope trump use nuclear arsenal kill virus mom evangelical Christian, stance many accounts Bible God using imperfect men fulfill will. mentioned publicly known actions taken, reply “George Soros” “do research.” asked specific evil actions George Soros taking orchestrate nefarious plans, couldn’t name single thing, proceeded melt saying didn’t time look all. zero chance reasoning people like this. faith Trump hardwired DNA, along belief witches, demons, rapture, Noah’s flood, talking donkeys, demonic giants, six-thousand year old earth, Adam Eve, eternal damnation, speaking tongues, drunk Holy Spirit, impending apocalypse I’m you.

I’m curious protests riots suddenly allowed though kids can’t get proper education. Halloween cancelled protests fine. Dear world. Please remember distinguish Americans republicans. 


As older American, assure Republican party’s love corruption fascism thing since born. comparative list...

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CORRUPTION MEANS...

* Burglary, election tampering, lying (Richard Nixon). 

* Secretly selling US military weapons Iranian terrorists, lying (Ronald Reagan)

* Pretending president’s close family friends didn’t attack U.S. 9/11 (Saudi Arabia), covering blaming *their* mortal enemy (Iraq), sending American soldiers die fighting interests people attacked us. calling democrat dared call traitor (George W Bush &amp; Dick Cheney). 

DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CORRUPTION MEANS...

* deadbeat brother uses notoriety sell beer (Jimmy Carter)

* Cheating wife, lying [Bill Clinton).

* white (Barack Obama). article May. Look Denmark's trend now. covid want pity Fearmongering. Keep Italy. Great work. saw argument tv epidemiologist said *if numbers keep rising like younger generation take 6-8 weeks till virus spread older generation happens then.* said germany matter country, counts every country. tv show * Markus Lanz* wanna check Thinking back learned Monarchy Divine Right high school assumed wouldn’t make come back. landlord, talking taking almost always best strategy, even else fails courts able show responsible wiling deal problem. dont know paying best strategy, asking landlord would absolute minimum pay doesnt pay stuff like taxes pocket would nice, depends situation. ...and people shitting place, yes. 

Okay, so, got San Fransisco. Kind thing. bowled traced Itaewon club outbreak despite people leaving fake names/details.

The Chaebol system allows close relationship corporations government telecoms companies could give tower dump data tracers. could also monitor card payments, CCTV mass message localities details recently infected’s movements. 

Compared UK poxy app plus outsourced minimum phone bank tracers, whole different level professionalism technical expertise. USA 3 times many cases per capita sarcastic. Lockdowns horrible idea much worse world good. Whaaaaa, people hear talk. Grow little boy. word friends Mumbai region hospitals capacity turning away countless numbers patients, triaging also factoring ability pay. 
So many people also getting sick hospitals aren’t able keep necessary hygiene. total mess pandemic overwhelmed country’s capabilities States. 

The bright side country relatively young people are, sadly, used enduring hardships. don’t know especially decent vaccine actually months horizon feel like could’ve waited little bit longer ultimately better outcomes Long term. hope doesn’t become like late May early June bars. Looks like anomaly dude Canadian, care undocumented (my American wife waiting PR 3 years know slow buerocracy be) send fucking Republicans please. saying wrong? 
First compare total number infections population density said country. gives closer representation actually well country done combatting virus. Brazil laughed UK third many cases USA per capita Fellow Texan here. Welcome! you’re living Austin area, feel free reach tips, etc. I’m familiar goodly amount clinics hospitals town. :) Taking America’s population density account disingenuous shit ton land unoccupied. Americans live cities suburbs. Also, population density absolutely nothing case mortality. spread.

America ramped months ago death rate never spiked much cases. Americas case fatality rate way lower western countries haven’t seen death spikes even though cases went back months ago. Well ever tried working poor person? How'd pay? scream 5? least *something* good happened 2020 Small town Ohio aint much better bub Obviously America perfect, right mind would complain?

That type thinking leads nothing done income gap social programs. directly part problem. mean questions fucking stupid. Like post said proposing idea option. Trump loses he's office, period. He's going fight anyone stay. crazy. Waiting vaccine could take nearly decade. fastest effective vaccine anything developed 8 years. *never* vaccine developed kind coronavirus. Furthermore, everyone take vaccine highly unethical force everyone take it.

A world wait thing world small businesses close down, big corporations control everything, mass unemployment homelessness, generation socially undeveloped undereducated children, mass loneliness isolation, skyrocketing mental health problems suicides, etc. etc. etc.

It makes literally sense anyone would want order stop virus 99.997% survival rate ages 0-19, 99.98 survival rate ages 20-49, 99.5% survival rate ages 50-69 94.6% survival rate ages 70+.

Please stop letting fear make think ruining world good reason good idea.  You’re really going end show country handling virus better us? US 20% worlds Corona deaths, case wondering even 5% worlds population. I've drinking green tea goddamn day. go church every Sunday, wanna bring demons me?

Yeah, long got yr breathing holes properly covered expose genitals. Tit tat. One main things done full nomination selection FEC board members - right toothless can't anything there's enough members hold quorum. 

And Joe wins win senate going continue. would argue flipping senate might important flipping White House. Prisons US evil. Twitter, really seems based around people follow, videos watch YouTube. soon start following watching video person certain part political party, everyone else associated part party gets recommended, putting deeper echo chamber rabbit hole. essentially try anything. Follow someone blue check mark obscure reality show recommended.

Hashtags also help, too. Literally input topic hashtag you’ll see whole communities live around hashtags. could certain protest, political movement, tv show inside joke, etc. It’s sometimes hear stuff like [Topic/Label] Twitter sometimes describe communities.

I swear rabbit hole phenomenon back day started YouTube. almost game sometimes see far YouTube would take kept clicking related vids. could start watching funny video day somehow end looking 9/11 truther videos like 10-15 clicks. it’s gotten even better seek something like whole Q thing, get tip iceberg video, recommended another, another, another deep. feel like I'm playing plague Inc point humans start getting desperate.

Guys, noooo. this? That's horrible. joke.  Breonna Taylor's family settled 12 million dollars, juatice people whose property getting decimated? first vaccines months away, point, effectiveness younger age I’ll probably start letting guard that. much life get back to, even put long is. Doomed might going bit far, certainly good. thought CCP covid war. flu definitely mutates quickly. get vaccine every year, beyond that, know. I'm medicine. Finally good news change  Police made enemy people, enemy gets shot sometimes, matter race. way going get well finding way remove corporate oligarchy control government. frankly, see real way happen.  we're pretty much doomed collapse decades upcoming. self perpetuating system. less educated electorate likely vote folks going make education priority. sure belong Reddit nuanced responses links reliable sources?

Thanks! That's true lol. Covid going away, eventually herd immunity, vaccines such. however going lot global pandemics future generations, hopefully medicine become faster responding them, countries learn previous pandemics nedicate spread thousands years ideas vetted spread smart people. (Those could read write) brain dead moron drunk idiot make bullshit get bunch idiots believe maybe even decently smart gullible/biased people. Humans evolved handle constant social interactions internet it’s destroying brains wired. Well I'm French admit Napoleon's lasted much less time American Empire.

Given eroded America's social structure always been, given total absence social contract allowing people move socially spending power, actually wonder country managed remain number one long.

All empires end though, seems US. China's time coming. Both. Please stop hostile repeatedly asking questions. testing high case number zero gone. Even low case counts interstate travel places cases means still there. Canada public ed (and private ed go university route) gives us critical thinking skills prepare us workforce. okay covid (though we're second wave), millenials gen z struggle get jobs know finally get there. Fun facts.  god damnit... Says person using technology items lives slaves countries. People died suffered making products love admire. Apple products shoes. point anyone say prioritized lives revenue things. 

Capitalism baby! love it. wish knew daughter future, leave country? stay hope best? It’s terrifying  Seems rather ironic given voted equally bad candidate third party options available. actively contributed problems still voting evil alien. 

Yes cartoon, serious, citing serious conversation. Justice improves everyone's lives. big ask. Friend mine said “Open everything back up. shit’s killing old people fat people.” pointed he’s implying it’s ok overweight friends die. told stop putting words mouth. last weeks I’ve googling process transfer US Pharmacist license Canada... far looks like varies depending territory you’re looking locate to. Let's start country blackjack hookers! Call Australia somthing cool like that. Hope taken. US goes down, rest world going too. single non dictatorship run military could take US navy's stance open sea trade monitoring, preventing terrorist cell growth middle east/Africa. Lot countries evil governments like Turkey Russia NK Iran holding back expanding due threat US sanctions. look TIP report, lot countries human trafficking laws threat US sanctions- world police super power things would get actually bad 

It would either turn global fragmented shit show Chinese 1984. Antuna like amiright?

Ok I'll show back bunker detract message, numbers little off. Roughly 60%+ entire US population lives paycheck paycheck, without even $500 savings. next 10%-20% lack $1000 savings.

Wealth inequality nearly peaked, middle class gone.

The top 1% holds wealth, 10%-20% holds remainder. Everyone else working poor; debt bound circumstances. anything think I’m underestimating it. Look forest, whole picture, last 100 years. country, long far, contributed global advancement prosperity. guess lot die hards don’t know accurately fact check Missouri resident... shock all. Hell yes universal healthcare! think money come from? Massive tax increases. personal salaries goods. sounds marvelous reality wont work . Long waits drs CHOSEN you.And Democrat 40 years. Things got insane corrupt. Proud Democrat! anymore. promise world without telling masses achieved. Rant over. think stereotyping *lot* people. 

Trump lost popular vote, likely lose again, people politically apathetic terribly positive country. worry bud, two weeks he'll bump back over. many jails prisons kind common. going tell? going listen? held responsible. guards say instructed it. Administrators say ""We idea happening"" end that! go jail become unwanted dog kill shelter. People may know abused care enough stick necks out. ""If broke law, happened you""/s ""Under change, students designated facility security monitoring considered congregate housing, like nursing home prison, viewed state risk community spread. Therefore, inhabitants count one case.""

Have this? closed systems. Employees go home end shift communities. 

Ridiculous. came close rejected stocking position bike delivery job college, know miss least one menial job, interviewers pressed “overqualified.” talk much putting seasonal decorations Target felt like building models much loved bicycling (when didn’t care much either) get move interview. thought lot then, since. think it’s possibly layered. people know training costs money, we’re “overqualified” simply applying job need eat, there’s decent chance we’ll bounce soon better opportunity arises. mean, that, took couple years. nefarious thought I’ve workforce educated, they’ll likely fight better conditions, higher pay, possibly even unionize (in companies that’s fear). say 9,000 deaths Canada likely least 2 million cases. Back IFR.  Watching hunger games right thinking thing. I'm exact boat. Got laid March 23rd nobody hiring industry. Heard couple months, heard since. lost car, going lose apartment December without unemployment benefits. Single lost last living immediate relative Covid. Worst part could go get two part time jobs still make enough rent. going homeless nobody seems care government. states governer seems give shit Trump rails constantly, I'm voting Biden that. friends Canada said would take Border situation no-go. Honestly know do. voted every year even local elections since turned 18 shit still happens. politicians realize game, messing livelihoods people getting fed status quo. know sure hell am. Ok Republican's plan improving Healthcare unbelievably large hospital bills average person needs pay even basic care?

Democrats plan can't enact. Republicans doing? level sterilizing immunity probably can't said top three 

Can provide context claim, especially may relate BNT162b Pfizer? America probably changed must less think. politics changed, 99% political drama little impact nation, general.

Before COVID-19 country still accelerating technology development evolving business models. spite this, America near full employment, wage growth across board, inflation staying low. days return COIVD-19? would guess will.

It perplexing realize seeing news America (and probably nations) like looking tunnel, seeing tiny part it.

Remember party tried include government oversight disbursement PPP loans party fought passionately make sure oversight put place. &lt; 300 deaths covid New York August similarly low Sep. continues, already less covid deaths flu upcoming flu season. ""China has promised provide doses least 62 countries, signing formal agreements allies like Indonesia Pakistan. Meanwhile appears be blocking cooperation efforts countries tense relations, Canada.""

Essentially shared global use internet previous organizations (hierarchical) evolving towards network based structure. One right wrong better worse.. is, mean got us here...! Trump unfortunate growing pain process think going wrong way personally. Reconstruction could much thoughtfully carefully done... definitely highlighted that's sure.. along areas need 4onbe updated Even pro mask people set ways... ex wife flew Atlanta New Orleans person cheated May things bad over. always taken multiple vacations per year god nothing going stop that. lot people like different ways. can’t sacrifice. Sacrifice means they’re punished. They’re entitled pieces shit. Oh, didn’t know US!

/s

Yes, wish Americans thought He’s like someone sold soul satan. matter do/say people still trust support unconditionally. Sounds like chinese culture used be...hmmmm problem there's internet. echo chambers exist due algorithms social media show **[their algorithms conclude]** want see hear. joke empire feel sorry America. system pretty good worked hundreds years make us supreme global power - yet abolished slavery knew right, give agency power individual, protect global world order that, whole, making human life better around globe.

Only hard left would believe America needs pity; people put perspective idea single president, 3 years, really much influence daily lives.

Keep triggered hyperbole news media though reddit. grown ups still laughing you. Population Canada around 38 idea many doses vaccine needed.

I would think initial phase would vaccinate vulnerable essential workers. elderly nurses / doctors / hospital staff get vaccine, would huge win society would enable almost full opening economy. person spitting black people trying go desegregation schools. case ever wondered. Jesus christ hell wrong people? Yeah..we majority. bigger mouths. You’re gross. racist minority population insists orange pussygrabbing moron president. There's nothing decent people cheat election. Covid least problems. I’m sure internet net positive yet, really depends much society becomes fractured. Us able agree facts terrifying me. good quote Tristan Harris Social Dilemma “The internet equal parts utopia dystopia”. I've cried fucking much today. see streamer LSF start balling they're Sweden wearing masks. that's high expectation. We're far off. We're fucking far off. we're 40K cases day.. I'm cutting mom. can't keep delusional relationships. need make boundaries myself. JSKLD:FFUCK FFUCK FUCKK FCUK Nah, Republicans dismantling democratic institutions norms decades. let hook. true though. Canadian feel bad all. fact media biased actually get large swath population buy rhetoric like mail discarded ditches, handful votes found garbage etc surreal me. painfully obvious seeds uncertainty sewn trump co.

I hope heart things resolved November, y'all start growing together instead apart again. think main issue unbridled drone #1 time, lot people don’t see life. Don’t get wrong, privileged, always improve. crazy thing Republicans managed reach many poor people. large party rich Dems party poor, there's fracturing last 30 years. Plenty rich Dems, there's reason poor Republicans policies help them. *ideologies* align, stopping abortion gay rights help pay bills get job decent healthcare. 

Dems never stopped caring things, care women's gay rights well. people honestly cut noses spite faces. keep purchasing vaccines yet proven fully still tested? guess afraid guys run vaccine. possible end purchases work out. know eligible seeking asylum foreign country. Depending outcome next presidential election, guess plausible, would experience refugees US. Something tells white oxen folks would want slaughter... serious, need - /r/IWantOut 

If pro-Biden though, could get done first? Trump... well nevermind, attention probably wandered getting far so. Number 10 deaths per 1mil. BTW, one went without respirator, one went without PPE, ships sent, hospitals built... take thousands people murdered Cuomo Wolf others sending virus positive people nursing homes, would much lower. Patriotic muricans: best country world. I've never personally travelled feel best country.

also patriotic muricans: ackschually, czech republic starting lot deaths, too. Let's even contemplate happens birthdays. industry booming right now. town, property crime getting bad people becoming hopeless living streets. It’s protest “violence”. Heh. they'd done Caligula, mad, too. Zuckerberg lot answer for. graduating class sizes 11,12,and 13 years gonna place expect rest World it? mean aside China Russia. *most   dont wanna say value

You want say explicitly terrible thing say. understand want beat around bush. Even worse, say 'Keep America Great', like there's somehow *improvement* past four years. Morons.   would highly recommend Fall Civilization pod cast excellent video [The Bronze Age don’t take kindly folks don’t take kindly viewpoints round parts. Oh boy. guess means elections begin.

Right?

Right? Hmmm... Keep triggered hyperbole news media though reddit. grown ups still laughing you. I'm Minnesota. promise endless talk aboat weather, homemade Jucy Lucy's, passive aggressiveness. zodiac sign loon favorite word ""ope.""

Yeah, I'm signing asap. Get reddit, Putin. lol won’t get sent back there’s major incident yeah okay Honestly, easy perspective sit reddit front TV day however really bad. 

Things still great sun still rising. Positive cases going state things returning normal. don't. understand logic environment cultivated decision. Fuck automod, entire post political. really 2 america's us know shit leadership know science fake coronavirus. Honestly, he's image business Republican party. He's nothing without made sure much liberty needed get moment.  I'm landlord. stop paying rent immediately. take time, depending live, landlord evict you. am, like least 3 months. (You look long takes are.) asks rent paid, tell temporarily laid supposed start back day now, catch rent resume working. might lead delay starting eviction process.

Immediately start looking roommate situation. am, bedroom apartment 2-3 roommates cheapest housing, probably less half studio apartment costs. likely find place move November. 

When moved, secure move-in date, tell landlord out, pay rent owe can. He'll glad need evict you. get agree responsible lease beyond November. Email something like ""You find someone take apartment December, right?"". Even fails reply, fact contradict something may helpful ever takes court. probably won't. lawyers cost $300/hour more, inevitably sit around hours waiting 15 minutes speaking judge, worth it.

Good luck! H2N3 couple years back went around. sucked lot bedridden ten days. Wouldn’t describe feeling like dying however.

I’d take couple days heartbeat meant single shot, highly effective vaccine didn’t need booster shoots / multi week waiting period use. got coworkers screaming I'm stupid believing numbers supposedly person X Covid dies car accident, counted COVID numbers fake Companies still require social distancing/masks yeah it’s dick move employer doesn’t, it’s probably see necessary stay afloat. state grievances hope change mind quit like workplace policies. It’s obviously ideal, 7 months, businesses need flexibility determine need operate survive makes employees uncomfortable, well place tried surviving ways 7 months already. 🤡 Yes, that's true majority drugs pharmacies.

Also, much water kill you. go prison sooner. really depends circumstances. 

And pretty complicated situation. prisons harder get in, harder get out. can't release serious criminals treat site send hospital require 24 hr armed supervision. main way seems get guards since prisoners transferred facilities go quarantine either prior upon transfer. jail outbreak generally transferring anybody another jail prison. 

And jails lot people coming going also smaller populations options. places generally runs 120 people relatively small. people get arrested never leave holding separate rest population. figure person gonna we'll move single cell week long isolation make sure develop symptoms. get sick point stay covid test done. that's positive we're going get possible. Failing go one single cells ends hall end ventilation ducts. 

From hear prisons worse gets can't get rid it. guards means points entry. least jail captain fairly reasonable pull rank force safety measures. They're happy let people go free enough single cells precautionary quarantines time really want deal full blown outbreak. nurse care less census I'm trying keep everybody safe.  i've seen trailer That's sociopathic. Ok. change fact body naturally death. 

Rest assured though, absolutely gutted opinion random reddit. Thats true, let's pretend Reddit one biggest political echo chambers Internet. imagine unfortunately 🤦🏻‍♀️ parents joke, jokes supposed funny. 

What hot mess greed driven slavery. Y'all actively promote riots reddit twitter wonder shits burning around Lol think support Trump.   would definitely donate kickstarter exact app. want move Scotland YEARS, immigration process pretty tough. I’ve resigned finding Scottish husband instead. knew skip prekindergarten, skip kindergarten too?"
