0,2021-05-15," Literally doesn’t feel like I’m putting much effort wear mask. It’s literally piece cloth. continue wearing it, especially feel sick (cold) anything. 
There’s probably still variants , I’m vaccinated idc don’t wanna take chances [Efficacy rates explained terrible CDC explicitly state obvious fact couple states tried play ""they outright say schools keep masking rest school year, so..."" quick search find answer looks like depends state. states allow, one, kid go regardless parents want. Might worth looking into. lot people ended indoors together, too. BLM Riots spread it.

The areas Trump rallies also primarily Trump areas. great idea. Breakthrough cases still possible, could accidentally create superspreader situation happen bunch unvaccinated students close proximity unmasked positive person extended period time.not going buy groceries. worse, someone lies vaccinated status go maskless gets covid know it. effect sparking first waves denialism distrust experts. You’re unnecessarily aggressive. need chill out. 

And *did* compassion people I’m stopping *experts* say I’m putting people risk do. 

So stop speaking right now. make stats support conspiracy theories lmao you’re good! far hasn’t variant that’s evaded vaccines Science CDC spoken. Many Reddit miss masks, panic gloom doom. made it! Took US get crap together envious position vax demand!  Restaurants eating issue. Shops long spend anyway. 30 minutes most?? Ok one else see irony reality little kids masks adults not. whole point masks community protection.  decisions remove masks inclusive everyone thus timing decisions take consideration. 

I'm arguing wrong time, either everyone unmasked noone is.  Trying isolate groups never good way go. People whatever want. comical seeing science crew decide science isn’t good enough now. 

CDC says it’s safe many know better. 

I’ve telling people whatever want months. wanna quadrupole mask hide blanket it. fun. 

Now it’s time rest us go back living lives free fear paranoia. matter holds up. knows money fight control. Yeah comment ""hence word 'complied.' wearing mask told stopped told could stop, ground judge someone still wearing one interacting service workers? None. decision made yourself? Nothing. you? Nobody. nothing person, living nothing life, acting though thoughts really they're nothing. small person taking mask go restaurant, celebrating ""freedom"" mocking anybody tries care others. good. Love life. Go on. nothing know last year making someone outdoors, speaking closely face face long time, possible.

sounds like Trump I’ve fully vaccinated since late March wondering. It’s don’t believe can’t find 45 minutes go get vaccinated sometime 7-day week you’ve got bigger problems.   Well, kids died flu one regular season died covid year US. numbers include high risk kids - don’t see reason believe significant number kids high risk covid flu.  Yes. complied regulations. 37% fully vaccinated. first shot enough pretty much immune. already risk people. people think anti-vaxxers waiting green light CDC take seriously? taking seriously along. swear first read thought sending 700 thousand COBRA vaccines Suriname like damn, LOT snakes Suriname. It’s long day... I'm mostly right you. exceedingly frustrating terrible lesson &lt;12yo see adults required are.  feels like everyone else said ""we got ours"" sorry. Yes protected it. Moderna great vaccine far shown effective Indian variant. Make sure go back second shot wait 2 weeks full protection. **May. 16, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

We know:

* unvaccinated people stop wearing masks soon mandate lifted
* case loads still pretty high (coming still high back early summer 2020)
* still plenty people unable get vaccinated (children, people health conditions)

Referring vaccine eligible bud. AMERICA BACK!    I’m saying tested mother brother, tested positive. paragraph blurb copied. Use context clues, I’m teaching 1st grader right now.

“Brody’s mom, Nicole, older brother got sick tested positive COVID-19. two weeks later, Brody got sick.

He bed week. never tested positive virus, doctors called presumptive-positive case due exposure, family, symptoms.” *you* grow realize masks really detrimental general everyday life. actual legal grounds empty threat?

Either way, vaccinate daughters tell him, how'd ever know?  likely location. enforce every single day would talk doctor. People fibromyalgia absolutely get vaccine. felt really relieved son able get MMR. care much chicken pox, pretty concerned measles. know pure speculation, think announcement prod fence get done. kind need put “wait see” folks feet fire removing masks pretty significant way so.

Duh! 50% effectiveness rate, compared 90+ Pfizer, Johnson Johnson etc take done zero research types people virus affects. takes five weeks first jab full immunity. anti mask/antivaxers going abuse policy walk around unmasked unvaxxed, putting 12 year old risk.

I understand downvotes. literally laws vaccine cards already books. 500,000 dead people wear masks. expect dangerous behavior selfish people end now? think ""really bad"" overselling it, given bad side effects get. understand it, easily manageable side effects often.  mod fully mental maybe studies came vaccinated people virtual zero chance getting severe covid spreading covid makes masks pointless. Microchips made anything magnetic anyway. Help me, please, maybe I’m misunderstanding *you*. saying took test result came back negative?  never ran President Obama...but *most* presidents get votes president them, simply size electorate much larger due population growth. ergo...it's real feat get votes previous potus. there's that.

How selfish people write human cost mild annoyance best? Wearing mask cost money hurt. did, I'd get it, I've worked 12 hour days hot sun shit told one day shit might save kid, I'd wear two.

What's wrong everyone?  Yes!

http://russfoxx.com/portfolio/magnetic-vision/ Good point. Hey new car tells wife drive. CDC one public health agency. Others around world agree advice think masks remain least sort herd immunity acheived.  Really, come on. Vast majority kids little symptoms, case numbers falling aren’t likely even get it, wear masks susceptibility even lower. Vascular damage? Got evidence kids 12?

Follow science, listen experts saying. ones wear mask questions. 
Our son first dose now. Second beginning June scheduled.  ""Sometimes used interchangeably.""  mRNA COVID-19 vaccines Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N), Moderna (MRNA.O) likely effective coronavirus variant rapidly spreading throughout India several countries, according laboratory experiments. Death possibility (albeit remote one) vaccinated, long covid (albeit hopefully remote one)? Yes, protective immunity another 5?weeks. 12 , good luck kid. Hope there’s hidden vascular damage there. Yeah

Now CDC saying officially time loosen masking pressure end hard mandates phase personal responsibility matter unvaccinated going high [Yes Pfizer Moderna effective it. Probably people change state mandates revoked. TJ's following local ordinances, mask signs still stay up, really worth one fight workers it.

I expect signs come mandates depart. Also, feel little rude wear mask workers, also probably vaccinated, still to. proportion population Vermont Bachelor’s advanced degrees almost double Mississippi.

What amazing coincidence. Exactly. cares get vaccinated not. 😂 It’s interesting see people reacting similarly matter nationalities... Stay safe Taiwan! rude genuinely trying learn thought process, you’re wearing one case data wrong vaccinated ppl spread it?   Yup. That's issue ICUs potentially critical, need round clock care people ventilated. Yeah...I went local Trader Joes mask see - figured would take seeing others without masks. every single person - aside one older man - masked. want seem like douche, kept mine :\\ Eh they'll week. Everyone will.

Policitians generally want first last. Bro many facts man chill tf Reddit. Yea! I’m confused...I thought I’m vaccinated can’t give covid anyone. would wear mask rules say don’t to? doesn’t make sense me, confusing “Also likely die” lmao. Would love see numbers “likely”. one ever seems mention actually sick lol bad, dude. forgot I'm Reddit need /s end sarcastic statement. Vermont fewest chain restaurants per capita. People realize awesome GOOD mom pop every single town vermont. I've traveled lot much travels focused food. best meals entire world right Vermont. Good! Vietnam extended quarantine restrictions Indian variant I, retail employee, personally confronted easily 100+ customers mask situation

Had one customer pull knife Went Trader Joe's today - one person masked. think might take time people relearn wearing mask okay. apologies question asked many times before.

I keep hearing vaccines prevent *catching* virus, prevent getting sick. herd immunity work that? unable receive vaccine going permanently danger vaccinated people spreading disease longer track? 50 years everyone constantly catching spreading covid without knowing it, symptoms? think....you understand....germs  Yankees incident qualify “superspreader event”? We’re talking eight people, one showed symptoms (and already recovered). 

“Superspreader” suggests sort large-scale pervasive public health threat, certainly not. *is* clear indication vaccines job far preventing serious illness, hospitalizations, deaths. 

Is weird/interesting situation? Yes. anything concerned *at all* public health sense, reason throw masks back we’ve vaccinated? Absolutely not. guidance corporate major chains basically says ""Offer mask. refuse oh well tried best."" work major hotel chain same.

Plus option repeatedly call cops keep people trespassed. We've call cops handful occasions unrelated Covid cops i've interacted showed without masks lol. can't even imagine business trying trespass anti masker damn cops show without theirs. know they're vaccinated still. today Everyone os wearing masks indoors. Ide say Everyone tell - opposite. lol.
I still wearing mine fully vaxed. number one stat confusing people.

They think 95% efficacy means didn’t work 5% people. vaccinated people somehow 5% chance infected.

Let’s remind everyone actual clinical trial total 43,548 participants underwent randomization, 43,448 received injections: 21,720 BNT162b2 21,728 placebo. 8 cases Covid-19 onset least 7 days second dose among participants assigned receive BNT162b2 162 cases among assigned placebo; BNT162b2 95% effective preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 100%) observed across subgroups defined age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, presence coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases severe Covid-19 onset first dose, 9 occurred placebo recipients 1 BNT162b2 recipient.

21,720 vaccinated, 21,728 placebo.

Vaccinated group, 7 days second shot - 8 cases

Placebo (unvaccinated), 162 cases.

Again, vaccinated group **8 cases 21,720 people.**. That’s .037% them. ....yet open another month! That’s entirely different producing negative test. case here. Spanish flu eventually died down, that’s without vaccinations CDC nearly every state government: safe
 
Puzzled-Bite-8467: safe
 
I know going find shocking, I'm going go experts. Honestly put couple weeks spent like hours shit first opened get appt mom dad. 

Pretty easy though. made apt, walked it, waited 10 mins got jab. went bar.

I think easy coworkers friends family like quit procrastinating go lazy dork. People will. I'm 32 btw. initial craziness old people died like whatever I'll get next weekend March 2020 flashback Don’t bring damn kids Starbucks then. ain’t complicated. fully vaccinated thinking yourself. 

Meanwhile, people getting vaccinated fully vaccinated 5-6 weeks. People like types businesses care *them*. Teenagers became eligible. Kids eligible. Anti vaxxers absolutely stop wearing masks; additional covid spread. fact EVERYONE WANTS VACCINE GETS ONE FULLY PROTECTED. another 5-6 weeks. 

You must one lucky ones eligible opened public. CA eligibility opened everyone month ago, even got vaccine day (which nearly impossible, appts) still protected today. yet, mask mandates everyone lifted (lets pretend vaccinated people). answer question. [And Central Valley state per capita income would lower  Yeah gonna say lol, difference gonna make? local grocery stores gave week 2 mask mandates. That's pretty bleak. necessarily incorrect, bleak. reason one vaccinated. So…. keep masking. according Economist. compared countries excess deaths last year reported deaths COVID. Brazil actually matches quite well. Excess deaths closely match reported COVID. Much better Russia -stan countries cases apparently undercounting deaths order magnitude. 
  
 
Edit: Data US shows reporting fairly accurately actual number deaths. now, when? always unvaccinated people. continue take precautions individuals? grocery stores, etc, never going require proof.  lmaoooooo worry that, iirc, potential mutation far effective current vaccines. mean decision happen certain day, doesn’t it? can’t decide overnight day finally came. took months get point. workers? Wait minute would see decline business? taking business places masks required everyone everyone wants get vaccinated able enough time get full protect (another 4-6 weeks). Starbucks *losing* business. I'm sure plenty people getting vaccine (adults teens), immunocompromised, kids feel safe Starbucks similar businesses. 

People going lie vaccinated. ""what if"". internet thousands social media posts anti vaxxers proclaiming never wear mask. Source? even allowed that?

are people gonna let him?

is gonna massive backlash potential rioting? 

will places follow?

curious see come  Makes sense. wouldn’t wear mask didn’t need one. Also need remember live global society. Odds good come whether starts not, regardless ""here"" is. I’m hoping anyone gets sick. Hopefully anyone gets infected asymptomatic get long lasting strong immunity. amazing achievement. think outside reddit people ecstatic ""No, science."" edgy far, according CDC, 118 million fully vaccinated Americans, 9245 breakthrough cases, tiny fraction resulted hospitalizations deaths.

So, breakthrough cases essentially non-factor. fact, going forward, CDC monitor/report breakthrough cases *only* result hospitalizations deaths.

If CDC doesn’t consider breakthrough cases pervasive public health threat (and that’s correct — aren’t), shouldn’t worry either. problem! Also likely die, since vaccine also prevents nastiest shit happening. point don’t care don’t care enough help themselves. people 80 years study, yet peer-reviewed, looked **175 people aged 80 99**, found extending second dose interval 12 weeks increased peak antibody response 3.5-fold compared three weeks. vaccinated acquaintances really need stop worrying people might think you. see public wearing mask I'm going think twice it. sounds like guys projecting though that's feel people wearing masks. really sad. IKR? sands time run eternity! 

""Two weeks!"" I'm seeing survey defines workers office workers. polls I've seen shows there's lot parental hesitancy getting kids vaccinated. hope hesitancy goes some, point there's guarantee approval kids usher massive increase vaccinations. 37% Californians vaccinated, okay, get upvotes.

The question, question asked, ""Does make sense businesses open allow people come unmasked without verifying vaccinated?"" answer no, unnecessarily put children risk. Unvaccinated people interact children, notoriously willing put convenience ahead others, consequently, children die. avoid wearing masks slightly longer.

How long? many angels fit head pin? That's thing focus on. assess it, like assess things, go along. right now, many, many cases, many many people perfectly willing spread Covid.

I'm pointing reddit even close reality. disagree? 99%&lt;. Well seems least complied. CDC didn’t make message clear all. really made difficult many workers. can’t easy them. much continue That's wrong. Vaccines prevent infection. still chance become infected, still small chance serious illness death. Even vaccinated, still carrier, still shed enough virus infect another vaccinated non-vaccinated person. important part many overlook. Transmission still possible among vaccinated. That's epidemiologists article recommending continue wear masks least another year. Vaccination prevent severe infection transmissibility. likelihood lower, still exists. fact exists means still severe outbreaks careful.

Also, variants emerge render current vaccines obsolete. protection anyone. can't claim ""all good."" Actually can. vaccines 100% effective. even less effective variants, predominant strain USA.

Remember, Vaccines reduce disease, eliminate infection. infected spread others even though personally aren’t feeling ill. bad time shot gets full approval need job portion source:

“Currently authorized vaccines United States highly effective protecting vaccinated people symptomatic severe COVID-19. Additionally, growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely asymptomatic infection transmit SARS-CoV-2 others.”

I believe Faucci also said data shows vaccinated people don’t carry transmit virus can’t find one right Lmfao actually serious right now? following science Sure go: portion source:

“Currently authorized vaccines United States highly effective protecting vaccinated people symptomatic severe COVID-19. Additionally, growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely asymptomatic infection transmit SARS-CoV-2 others.” Absolutely insane people think workers verifying vaccination status unmasked people before/after entering store reasonable. fuck getting paid thing?

Edit: context, stayed home, working homeschooling year. got tested weekly. disinfected common areas nightly. took pandemic seriously trusted science. choosing now. key, carry mask you, doubt, use it. Yes correct. states don’t trust humans quite yet LOL. want specific numbered vaccinated drop them. Won’t long really tell yet, can't even travel power. think knows name. we'll probably staying home.

Fuck that.

Rather let go waste, might well help rest world. context vaccinated ...
Vaccinated people wearing mask protect protect others...wtf...what talking here? can't people get it.
Anyway, comment still valid. let vaccinated go free without mask ways protection important. MA-VT 70-71% number 'first shots people 18-64'.
First shot 65+ 93-97%

MA VT top two states vaccination moment. big grocery stores still complying mask mandates one location? cases good? Lol Explain .04% number holds across different studies every study done different length time. number directly correlated long period looking percentage vaccinated people got symptomatic covid length study. chance getting covid getting vaccinated rest life. kept reminding conspiracy-absorbing sister South Louisiana Trump one started Operation Warp Speed, unless thinks get her, worried jab. finally got last week. 
You gotta meet people are, aware motivations fears. Insults winning debates change minds. changing minds motivation people online. tests they’ve 1,200 cases. want compare Hong Kong, they’ve 11,000 cases much smaller population. starting get yet? Okay, acceptable risk then? point people *not* monsters eyes following cdc recommendations? 100 deaths? 50? 10? Zero? Sure bud...you know true...just hope like grow even talk you. look comments, tell really give damn then. Good luck. vaccinated people I'm worried about. many anti vaxxers think follow honor system put mask? know NY didn’t drop mandates yet major city like possible kept well could show CDC data second group, showing literally cannot die hospitilizaed shots.

Citation needed. works ways course. That's point comment. better stop going going in. going in...don't think? people vaccinated wearing mask, mainly courtesy others...therefore comments. Vaccinated people wear mask protect others themselves. Hope get comment mean, state 74% adults least 1 dose, .93% positivity rate. think figures represent low risk anyone following cdc guidelines. transmission without masks would inevitable, isn’t risk overwhelming healthcare system essentially zero point? acknowledge child could bring virus home vulnerable relative unable vaccinate due various reasons, would quite rare. seems attempting zero tolerance policy virus instead simply protecting vast majority risk mitigating risk health system. 

I know we’re looking probably reaching herd immunity anytime soon, ever, restrictions lifted, really wonder serious outbreak would look like risk fairly protected. walked around Wal-Mart yesterday without mask- done every week since got shot 3 months ago. Nobody said anything me. Obviously aren’t aware data children pertains COVID else would know foolish comment is. state in?? yay Israel hit number zero vaccinated 60 percent. haven’t even hit 50 yet. waited another month. wouldn’t combusted.  know situation bad NL. Sorry hear that. thought fact send 700 THOUSAND vaccines means they're perfect shape themselves. NL obviously shares ties SU, think NL sole responsibility either. I'm glad help. 
Thusfar EU sent way vaccines US did.

The relation NL SU rather complicated. SU's independence, Dutch aid often framed still trying colonizing country politicians. Conspiracy theorists don’t really think.  NL instead USA? Suriname country. help countries worse. point people conflated ""follow science"" ""do thing least risk, even risk incredibly minimal"" sometime last.year said poorer areas India hit hard must used immunity?

I'm kinda pissed, ngl. pressured go back work can't get vaccine. Well experts say must true experts completely right everything. remember CDC director crying impending doom March 28. remember CDC advising us sanitize surfaces frequently. remember said wasn’t spread aerosols. remember 6 foot distance recommendation schools. remember said lableak theory crackpot. remember British variant would bring worst surge yet. missing? makes sense things better better US people leave. sub always US focused. 

I think gloom remaining comes rest world still struggling pandemic yet contained vaccines. Walmart vaccines available walk basis, Walmart town hour's drive away rural half county. Lots people access transportation get far. reliable enough vehicle rely catching rides offered. really need mobile vaccine clinics go isolated rural areas. nature science question, not? care wellbeing people choose go unvaccinated, choose lie wear masks, another choice they've made give even less protection.

People access vaccines. masks still wear they're yet protected. want? wouldnt waste time that. Looking surinamese cuisine recipes hand definitly worth time. CDC also told us, last year, people need wear masks telling us everybody wear masks.

It's almost responded adapted quickly changing scientific evidence circumstances, adjusting changing circumstances now. Grandma vaccinated weeks months ago. not, chosen be, fuck Grandma.

Polio higher R0 COVID also spread via respiratory routes. nice, one instance slow react suddenly ruins credibility right? wait, thought issue reacted quickly masks mandates? also ignoring they’ve around decades? 

My countries health organization started recommending masks *after* CDC. actually waited CDC’s guidelines. know, cause CDC respected internationally.

Ridiculous, usual. CDC place ""TOP EPIDEMIOLOGISTS"" frank countries much better track record comes expertise Epidemiologists. Remember CDC started recommending masks early 2020 started recommending way late. Granted messed things first, still CDC slow react think vulnerable groups vaccinated, time move on.

I've supported restrictions throughout followed guidelines support restrictions England. world difference protecting vulnerable time vaccine virus rampant, current situation vulnerable vaccinated.

People lost businesses years hard work put it, community organisations rely events charity gone forever, everyone covered furlough scheme: people lost awful lot. people done bit help protect vulnerable, never met. can't reasonably ask people continue giving much vulnerable vaccinated.

If live lives when? Wait another year vaccine combat variants pop up? 'Just feasible good country, fair stand lose lot. say, people done bit waited vulnerable vaccinated: 'time move on, get country going people enjoy themselves.

As 'people safer new way', live lives risk attached actions. risk acceptable 12 months ago, even 3 months back, now. mind. blown. Nowhere article mentioned... Indian government increased gap Astrazeneca doses 12 weeks. going get first dose ASAP (maybe even tomorrow), hoping would fully vaccinated within 6 weeks make return football.

Seems like wait 3 fucking months get fully vaccinated now. much protection first dose? enough remain safe return football? ask someone free vaccines, someone answer want give them, fault. Why? Bringing things given relevance claim ""when vaccine available all"" acceptable risk isnt 'dodging point'. literally bringing relevant point fact.  


You keep presenting moral issue, refuse acknowledge risk never zero. I'm asking specifically risk morally acceptable you. goal 'available everyone' unlikely possible due 6 month group, then? make sense include Jan 2020 flu deaths since COVID-19 yet. said, locked down, basically flu season winter, single digit number pediatric flu deaths.

Netherlands want remain good terms Suriname, lot people Suriname live Netherlands. Moreover, Netherlands still feel responsible well-being Suriname. finally, Netherlands many vaccines anyway. Might well give away them.  might Dutch way. translated title, probably translated number differently instead literally translating it. highest number community infections reported since Apr 14, 2020, 40 community cases reported. Singapore's ""circuit breaker"" started Apr 7, 2020 lasted nearly two months. masks scam begin with. Vaccines 100% effective. Uptake 100%.

Even good vaccination programme still going problems.

In UK areas India variant prevelant we've started see uptick hospitalisations mainly older un vaccinated people. That's despite us high take older generations.

I think cause continued restrictions problem. Good them. CDC guidelines dont really make sense since measures prevent people lying. There's way tell apart anti-masker, anti-vaxxer science denier. Immunosuppressed individuals come hug thank vaccinated mask on. Australia ban criminal penalties try go third country. NZ ban, sure whether permit transit another country.  assume either vaccination problems hesitancy, supply.

The 2 smallest Islands vaccinated one go, differences striking. Saba already vaccinated 85% adults fully open already, Sint Eustatius reached 37% May 5th (their goal least 50%, otherwise opening further). Thus difference hesitancy islands. 

All larger islands already vaccinated 50% adult population, makes believe supply problem. Pfizer requires -80 freezers though, would probably also logistical nightmare...  UK got right complete bullshit one (immunocompromised including cancer patients, lupus, every disorder get vaccine, recommended per CDC FDA), plus someone immunocompromised couldn't, going walking around WalMart. They'll likely sick level they're hospital, home care.

This correct. Organ transplant recipients, one large group, drugs allow live fairly normal life also actively prevent covid vaccine working properly.   Netherlands people seriously immunocompromised eligible since March 24. Anyone registered annual flu shot general practitioner (including asthma, diabetes, less severely immunocompromised people) eligible since last week. trust people all. I'll keep mask I'm around strangers while. gonna long time probably.. sigh   fact one randomly catches coronaviruses hiking trail. People randomly catch plague hiking trail every year. conspiracy theory zoonotic transfer much easier plague. No- innovation medical field made public funds- especially past decade billions billions stockpiled medical debt number one reason insolvency.

It greed holding back worldwide herd immunity deadly pandemic people India organs lungs even brains rotted black fungus(from covid treatment susceptible fungus) low rate? Supply hesitancy? know wondered French West Indies esp St. Barthélemy doing? year? Brazil well vaccinations Exactly, one month ago. Dutch around one month behind, like said above.

The difference US opened vaccinations seniors priority groups done. Seniors priority groups take relatively longer here, groups want vaccinated US. actually good thing (for country whole) bad personal level (considering healthy, relatively young adult low risk severe COVID). Netherlands even planning open all, invite year going gradually age, instead opening flood gates like US. Well think US can't shit much focus rest world things naturally died down. Honestly though know whats going India UK extent. idea things nations seemed well. EU de-facto export ban, US did. Well see made mistake. meant July, June. Sweet! I'm expert now, guys!!!!

Awesome!!! vaccine protect recipient Virus’s effects, everyone else getting vaccinated, it’s personal choice point.

People choose weigh risks make decision. sure everyone obsessed making others mask up.

Take vaccine let others deal consequences actions. 

Also, Texas Florida masks afterthought they’ve fine. Masks unnecessary point. Here's question: turn raving lunatic (of course, *delicious* accusation lacking empathy compassion) someone disagrees public health policy?

You lost, buddy. over. Done. That's pissed pissed government fucked vaccinations way send 700k jungle hospitals full. CDC organization made tons professionals around world. may agree policy decisions, work pretty good would extremely rare someone vaccinated enough viral load become asymptomatic carrier ability infect others. impossible, vaccine effective.  Either they're young healthy concerned variant that, they're older vaccinated concerned variant they're vaccinated. never concerned covid-19 first place.

The people concerned largely keeping avoiding crowded areas conversations strangers.

My mil lives Bedford (not Kingsbrook neighbourhood) second dose several weeks ago. still mostly keeps minimizes trips outside house general, pick grandchildren school several times per week. matter whether UK citizens? Putting India red list prevented returning. I’m honestly scared now. feel like CDC completely abandoned immunocompromised people like myself. suffered Guillian-Barre Syndrome 18 getting vaccinations college. told get flu shot rejected Moderna vaccine trial it. I’m position many unvaccinated people allowed maskless around whereas able function quite normally society due mask mandates. debating whether gamble get vaccine get COVID start staying home more. CDC didn’t think virus airborne, wouldn’t told people put masks.

Masks slow droplet transmission. could wear masks get it, since it’s months. That’s don’t get. seems reasonable tell adults wear mask months going normal activity. seem reasonable tell parents either lock young kids roll dice getting sick. “Experts” U R fine, it’s okay. winked, it’s totally cool! Stay home forever? Wear mask forever?

Expecting everyone society wear mask forever protect small number people also feasible, would suggest figuring manageable level risk situation partner/child/whoever. Covid ever going away, masks distancing are. Nah. We’re moving on. don’t highly effective vaccines available, never will.

Time rational, non-nutty people start pushing back rhetoric. either somehow idea Google works 2021, you’re bad faith troll. Got it. whole point people saying ones get vaccine. Kids can't. Easy tell kids stand sun hours lathered SPF100 nothing given chance use it. Even 12-15 year olds became eligible going take weeks get vaccinated. American honest. It’s national thing, “human honest”. us us aren’t, don’t trust you. Yes   can't quite follow two. assumptions pulled thin air?  Yes, assuming you’re authorized vaccines United States highly effective protecting vaccinated people symptomatic severe COVID-19. Additionally, growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely asymptomatic infection transmit SARS-CoV-2 learned nothing past year?  fully vaccinated risk spreading others.

the adults continued risk spreading bad outcomes COVID unvaccinated adults. think CDC well aware summer coming rock hard place current policies provide incentives vaccinate,but obviously Liars would unmask new policies.

Those vaccinated strong overlap improper mask usage. liars already potential vectors.

I think parents get vaccinated choose safe activities next 3 months (there's plenty them, nearly summer) schools open back up, think pretty safe place influenza much risk kids COVID. Maybe. I’m honestly educated enough, that’s case maybe see future. late guess rest guys it’ll interesting. shit Sherlock, saying though first comment told guy ""read again"" twisted actual words CDC. many, kids 12 eligible every 9-12 high school country would full kids 12+ I'm sure CDC took account adjusted guidelines Americans truthful vaccinations. Plain simple. They're harming people selfishness, give shit ramifications fReEdOm.

What happens fake vaccination records job healthcare field going university? Asking sovereign citizen /s clear there's large majority non parents subreddit, especially young kids. lack empathy constant parroting ""kids low risk"" ""just wear mask"" disheartening. Kids low risk everything. mean try protect them. kids low risk getting hit train let play train tracks. Last comment. good condensing thoughts. 


Don’t take grocery stores. new guidelines likely affect them. Yeah pretty much, called parent caring child's safety tool.  moronic brother law died Covid last year thought lie. Everyone family happier calmer now. lies fake drama him.  Trust Republican...ever, anything, all. They're incapable telling truth, they're incapable grasping it. Many people lied medical conditions obtain vaccine early &amp; jump line. crime too? crazy me. always ask, what's difference, always talk unproven experimental vaccines whatever. Completely ignoring vaccine still cleared medical agencies world, based decades vaccine research manufacturing. Meanwhile flu vaccine yearly game whack-a-mole. get control, discourage foreign travel? unreasonable demand?

Yes. us worked tirelessly past year work travel see world, unwind, nice weather good food, history sights...why feel bad so?

Fully vaccinated, wore masks, locked down, want life back. Variants always exist bad affected way things I’m afraid. think they'd similar response too, possibly even stronger one. vaccinated keeping people safe wearing mask. CDC didn’t think virus airborne, wouldn’t told people put masks

This completely wrong. Airborne means aerosols produced breathing linger air contagious. Masks also protect big droplets expelled coughing, sneezing sputtering. droplets big fall ground 1-2 m, linger air, protect need cloth surgical masks, N95 respirators. months parts scientific community denied fact aerosol transmission real, instead focused big droplets, despite evidence showing contrary. changed stance regarding aerosol transmission like 3 weeks ago. Science editorial pushing official recognition airborne transmission published July 2020.  ""I interest virtually impossible thing""

Good?  COURSE WILL. passing mask exemption cards day one never makes sense begin make general statements ""people"" ""everyone"" way society begins collectively accept children ""less than"" way longer included definition everyone, people, person.  One reason make sure get vaccinated flu every year. kids vaccinated flu since 6 months old. Good you! news today, experts determined water indeed wet shit. It’s gonna months anyway get vaccinated. Already vaccines starting role them. kept isolated months parents concerned virus that’s basically another flu them. really trusting people honest. trusting unvaccinated people start getting sick things opening up, reconsider getting vaccinated. weird choice, may necessary step get things moving worst danger mitigated. hope see spike taxes system again. nothing RN's union (who advocates caution CDC right now). I'm gonna sit searching info relevant conversation. I’m sure easy spot liars get covid months. still get virus vaccinated.

*And* enough time passed adaptive immunity create antibodies. link says, ignored. 

Don't distort facts omission. fear-mongering shit mad old. It’s discrimination.  Plan simple , people wont want share “ didn’t get vaccine “” info won’t wearing masks . 

That’s works , telling one group freedom punishing another group wearing symbol group marking discrimination. ask Jewish person . don’t see difference thinking don’t wear masks don’t get vaccinated don’t trust experts? Kids also small percentage total hospitalizations. Never greater 4% share given time, often 2%. Parents aren’t going risk kids tho, I’m realizing it’s moot point. science says kids highly unlikely affected, parents taking pandemic seriously aren’t going suddenly flip say isn’t big deal kids get Covid Commission ordered 1.8 billion doses explicitly allowed contract sell donate countries, hopefully that. Letting rest world go unvaccinated worse everyone. significant extent. need one render vaccines ineffective useless. That’s waiting actually rooting happen, too. 
Real-life data Singapore suggests vaccines (at least Pfizer Moderna used there) helped prevent severe disease Indian variants. good number breakthrough cases involving B1617 B16172, mild symptoms. breakthrough cases able spread virus others though. it’s big brain move reward actually vaccinated ones, incentivise hesitant ones getting vaccinated, let antivaxxers get virus either die, change minds get vaccine, recover antibodies anyway America get mess ASAP. care family community. fully vaccinated. stopped wearing mask outdoors entirely. Even people indoors without masks . feel people. Unfortunately solution short mandatory vaccination mandatory masks literally forever, covid isn’t going away gonna keep wearing masks till September, stay home want get sick easy tell someone vaccinated,  ask election 

(from twitter)  Wearing mask become identity people. Wearing mask means Good Person^Tm. wearing mask means Bad Person, would walk outside judging every person saw. Now, take mask, also become Bad Person? can't it. shit. hardly ever harmed covid. Wtf, one part comment concerned politics?  Addtl addtl alternative: vaccine works get it, dont worry whether others vaccinated. QED. end day, data information trending towards vaccines preventing transmission. happy. Yeah, going say... mad respect nurses hard work do, trust nurse interpret complex scientific studies CDC much trust cop interpret Supreme Court decision. apparently minority lol  called mind damned business. want CDC definitely prove vaccines effective, still waiting proof masks really work. 

All mask studies pretty weak since nobody using control groups actual infection tracking. Congrats. kids can't get another week. already saw morbidly obese person walking around grocery store shirt said “I identify vaccinated.” Like, dude. shut country year protect high risk people like you. truly conflicted returning Costco even though I'm vaccinated.

Then ignorant

If vaccinated, yet still concerned catching covid though realistic possibility, better go buy lottery ticket belief winning jackpot also realistic possibility inconsistent Well somehow live driving phones, even though texting driving cause many deaths simmerlike distribution people wearing masks believe vaccine mind controlling device gonna start wearing masks get vaccine.

It makes difference. So, knock Brazil way, possible children susceptible bad outcomes children live extreme poverty horrors entails? Thinking things like, excessive pollution, malnutrition, close-quarters living conditions favellas, poor medical care, etc. stepdad one ""I identify vaccinated"" people pisses mom can't take vaccine since reacts negatively medicine take. something happens him, going take Jesus-level mindset forgive him. yikes! kind sounds like it, though, people already treating such. really hard understand saying super-duper run sentence, way making fun anyone got infected. Apologies that's came across. ""chooses to.""

Then severe extreme consequences that. Thanks Experts, wouldn’t figured one without you. must fun parties. really need ""experts"" know know vaccinated people still get spread virus vaccinated people wearing masks going spreading further. vaccine sham works limited extent means cure actual problem bandaid stab wound. aunt fully vaccinated caught Covid 7weeks ago died dont pretend vaccine makes invincible anything close it. seems something whole lot people aren’t thinking about.

In people’s minds, “immunocompromised” people tiny percentage stand inconvenienced. Kids 12 vastly larger number everyone seems quietly agreed care about. Surprisingly, laws help keep safe. Others required go speed limit. They’re required stop red lights. laws require others certain things help keep others safe. fail things keep others safe, rights drive car/truck/bus revoked. 

The kids also wear seatbelts cars include safety features keep safe case accident. got first vaccination yesterday \:)/ Florida think rationale incentive there’s going ton irresponsible massless people breathing you, shouldn’t hold getting vaccine you’re sitting fence. blip starts going back toward trend line. 2 months we're still stagnated. 

Go urban hospital see numbers done timespan. Mine went 2 34 patients. overburdened, appreciable change.

Exponential decay relevant public health issues anyway. got lots tipping points small directives influence one way another. small change funding, slight shift time cause bigger effects broader level. 

For instance...mask mandates statewide covid trends. Upvoted it’s right thing upvoted gritty. people also attending super-spreader events whose participants come back infect children ineligible vaccination, might different take. people deserve consequences lies stupidity.

FWIW, significant percentage sex sex-offenders part cycle abuse abused. victims often become perps given tools manage pain appropriately. get choice. anti-vaxxers get choice chose badly. Yes vaccinated probably die go hospital covid. Every little bit helps ten percent nothing shrug off. link ten percent figure?  know concern ending mask mandate people lying vaccination spreading disease people cannot get vaccinated (kids, immunocompromised) point I’m sure alternative is. 

Our choices pretty much either this, keep mask policies place less forever, require kind vaccine passport. latter two aren’t gonna happen, choice left essentially throw hands let everyone whatever want. Many people whatever want entire time. 

I’m excited going back normal, really, really sucks people absolutely cannot trusted right thing. people easily lie walking hazards without consequence. Mortys rights too. Yeah, trust all. 28 states flyover states. decently populated(NC,TX,FL) single one 1k fresh cases day. Positive rates still around 5% testing US that’s mask policy enforced major cities. states also still require masks essential businesses including grocery stores major work places recently. I’m sure data indicative cases like mask policy’s loosened next month two. guess next 6 months telling.  Well shit sherlock. Americans defy rules put forth anything. soon try make prove anything? bet, counter-measures hacks. American way. People completely naive think everyone simply roll comply lol. People lie quite industrious ability keep ahead sort enforcement. true facet enforcing almost anything anywhere U.S. mean, try, going work. learned nothing? think he's antivax something. Like said want stay home day free so, people dying prerequisite. Man inherently evil. policy flow foundation. really matters. get Covid, case incredibly weakened vaccine, I'm cool that. Death hospitalization relevant stats me, one takes life takes financial independence.  kind degenerate s*** would make fun somebody infected infected infected yeah they're a****** spreading stories earlier true a****** making fun even true means they've following guidelines good enough catch think pretty good better people lot people wore masks went gym thought good I'm convinced Yeah az many schools switched already. like, kids vaccinated? Why? (This approved 12 up). annoys rollout change big companies dove immediately, puts lot pressure smaller businesses conform well.   cares. got vaccine fine. stay inside &amp; keep wearing mask rest life. 

The rest us move get back normal. new mask rules puts kids (mostly ones conditions) danger. monkey could tell this.  area (Chicago burbs) general public couldn’t get vaccinated easily start May, confusing process sign-up. 

So I’d expect large amount people starting process. numbers get better go. happy keep wearing mask around twats trust around people know gotten vaccinated. hidden majority Americans felt way actually scared coronavirus. people know, work liberal profession short entertainment industry, simply petrified mass media made people be. ambivalent best. older co morbidity did, otherwise wise basically big deal. never militant mask looked forward vaccines. looked forward vaccines reason end get back normal. far keeping kid school, please do. parents absolute militants mask keeping 98% rest families district want go back normal going back full schedule school. Blended learning learning wasted motto teachers significant extent. 

I guess depends perspective. 

All else equal, means instead reducing risk symptomatic COVID 1/20th would unvaccinated person, instead reduces 1/4th compared unvaccinated person. 

Note ""all else equal"" trying tell that's efficacy works, becuase works (it's compared unvaccinated without factors.) comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There’s bunch far left hippy dippy anti vaxxer cranks y’know. think state, experience, pleasantly surprised everyone grocery store still masked today. Starbucks too, believe longer requires masks.  abundance data. fact CDC even tracking infections vaccinated people unless end hospitalization death. No, say that? I’m saying assumption variant isn’t issue cases haven’t increasing unsupported. they’re nurses doctors. Australia hasn't, AFAIK let enough citizens deal back time, others wait untill turn.

Also I'll ask people traveling anyway. people realise that's virus jumps boarders.  believe vaccine vaccinated worry someone isn't? 

I baby *can't* vaccinated. People certain conditions can't vaccinated. Though may difficult imagine, us care people ourselves. vaccine keep getting spreading virus non-vaccinated people

And seatbelts guarantee die accident, make hell lot less likely. borne data countries reaching higher proportions vaccinated population. non-masked vaccinated person likely rat masked unvaccinated person 

1) say dispense masks? 

2) wrong, less likely get covid first place 

3) anti-vax crowd anti-mask crowd high amount overlap, many anti-vaxxers think going mask compliant? get sixty percent country vaccinated I'm expecting return ""This new movie beloved franchise awful that's good thing"" articles. going go like 3' shit sandwhich Pfizer seemed one manageable side effects true statement based limited data have. contrast, anecdote (that X% sister's classmates got Covid none lingering symptoms) data, something could possibly know degree certainty, assuming neither doctor parent classmates.

I also think I've quite clear fact children kept home- they're attending in-person school, camps, outdoor sports appropriate safety precautions. I'm going closely interact unmasked adult strangers may may vaccinated think Covid ""nothingburger"" kids.

In conclusion, I'll continue assess evolving evidence published, continue believe want ignore evidence contrary. uneducated lurkers, blame them? Make sure you’re driving anywhere you’re it. fucking course will. Since Americans honourable anything? issue ""what kids"" argument this~ get parents worried, people honestly believe CDC, top agency Earth researching diseases, kind meeting gleefully laughed, twirled mustaches, said ""LOL let's get rid masks let kids die!, Trucks child bodies muhahahahhaha"" something similar? 

Of course not. acted based data. add this, think current folks charge would signed sure risk kids basically nil.  awesome person

I’m sure buddy. got bunch Vogmasks 6 year old, they’re great loves them! Wears school day problems. also asthma airway issues make high risk. family members got Pfizer got AZ. either negligible side effects side effects all. unwell chills, fever general weakness period 12 hours starting 8 hours getting vaccine. hadn’t slept well side effects kicked 1am, still OK work home next day. said that, vaccine could give side effects. lie.. sick catering people willingly accepted faith. one really happy cdc lifted mask bans.. still mask pocket go feel around crowd inside outside... want walk around maskless unprotected say let find hard way.. fact government take extra 300 million doses give third world countries begging kids vaccinated, say sorry pretty bad asthma wearing mask difficult still it. last year really deep funk. can't believe little people care can't read good.  statement isn’t supported data vaccines, know isn’t popular point sub J&amp;J AZ vaccines protective mRNA vaccines Yup. right on!  mostly impacts immunecompromised, Im really sure else could done know it’s really low, also know much it’s impacted individuals community I’d rather wish one yes, I’ll prevent kids going I’ve seen classmates go through. One hospitalized month. One can’t taste anything told 60% lung capacity may never come back. I’m sure people can’t wear mask bit longer help others want vaccine can’t get yet. that’s selfish point view won’t minor things like wear mask indoors help others. Children need fucking vaccine Better hurry get vaccinated 

but seems like local doctors don’t want ways actually able safely Yeah given. this, dipshits create need whole vaccine passport thing they’ve railing against, won’t either wear mask go get vaccine. take antique lol everyone without mask thieving liar 

And vaccinated, matter are. Whatever Newsom point recall science. Obviously, look ""medically exempt"" really, we've given chance smart situation. choice akin driving curvy road midnight without headlights on. Automod used mods cowardly put stamp something.  know people aren’t completely tribal one track mind. possible think. expunge people throw truth away. There's certainly tons old people there, Florida close Maine oldest average age, there's also ton people. Maine's low population high percentage elderly puts top. someone vaccine would care? FYI, California pretty open. eating indoors, going movies, going church, swimming, drinking, pretty much whatever want.

If referring mask guidance, Newsom made announcement CDC made theirs. Nothing said changes stemming new guidance. r/dataisNOTbeautiful “It’s early! need least 50% fully vaccinated - many still waiting second dose!” 

The kind arguments I’m seeing CDC guidance, people making stuff ignoring science now. Like 50% magical value, single doses provide protection all. That's 10% average student loan debt total. Massively helpful. Thank you! Haha Half coworkers already maskless despite spewing anti vaccination lies found could get away without wearing mask Rushing door. google failed then. Great hear mean we’re talking group people worship pathological liar, reason mask mandates exist first place, whose ignorant, callous behavior responsible country’s absurdly high death toll, refuse get vaccinated. think one second won’t first people stop wearing masks I’ve got oceanfront property Arizona sell you. 99% people scour reddit details,

I would prefer followed CDC guidelines, I'm even asking independent research. basically saying everyone CDC NIH idiots kill us all, correct?  *puts piece cloth face*

OH NO! FREEDOM DIED! wonder [Archived link pass Or, know, dying. Even US, Hispanic Latino children disproportionality vulnerable Covid. 

The Mis-C data offers one example  took one two months really transition thinking. 
Creating workspace separate rest household helped. 
I went WFH situation strong aversion came around. 
Maybe option already gone though… came say 4 :) Im totally you. posturing positioning. backed corner. 

But worry, actual nurses likely ignoring plan masters summer vacations like rest us guess we’re experts since knows people lie. mean unvaxxed infect won’t mask. Yeah almost certainly true. countries (US, Israel, UK, New Zealand, Australia) elsewhere absolutely be. them. belief somehow country island global pandemic large part world fire, stupid.

Admin naive thinking, oh honorable society honor system. completely ignore fact large chunk poorly educated morons absolutely moral compass. Thank you; great read Surinamese perspective. COURSE LIE care lie -- burden decision impacts them, vaccinated.  Nothing stops continuing wear mask want to. Risk equals continuing wear masks months save hundreds kids? Easy answer I’m shocked feel differently. didn’t say don’t believe CDC. said keep wearing mask short term feel comfortable. Fauci said maybe month two ago would eat inside restaurants new cases got 10k indicating low spread. seem reasonable me. may change mind eat inside restaurant sooner ditch mask completely sooner. 

I didn’t argue CDCs guidelines argue others continue wearing masks somehow stating current preference wearing mask I’m inside store 10 minutes upsetting you. 

Me wearing mask harmful others. Yes! time businesses come together celebrate end pandemic resume full work days more! Good thing businesses still requiring masks /s difficult make much sense probably helping much, even vaccinated. better bet would dine unvaccinated get takeout eat outside.  Wearing mask 10 second walk table sitting hours unmasked joke question anyone thinks that's actually anything. Joe Biden campaigned making masks mandatory yet government complete opposite.

You know time works, yes?  people downvoting people I’m talking about? bastardise piece vital medical equipment use signifier political allegiance? long vaccinate, cause alarm. cause celebration!!  Vaccines work Indian variant everything I’ve read. anyone downvoting, explain observation wrong? ""Had locked closed schools, number pediatric COVID-19 deaths would lot higher typical flu season.""

Not necessarily. know, barring underlying health conditions, covid-19 present children adults. Children typically present symptoms alike common cold. Thus, risk death children extremely low. Flu car accident way likely kill children covid-19. said, still elementary aged children mask vaccinated. still LOT know virus. I've read ""long covid"" enough keep masks play little longer. Honestly, think July August year vaccine approved children 12. 🤞Here's hoping... Vaccines ended pandemic! Time declare national celebrations! Well yes, still challenge could overwhelm hospitals. UK vaccinated enough people yet. Great news, keep fine work! Threes truth lies. Old article wish CDC better job addressing us kids 12 indoors. Even recommend wear masks x percent community vaccinated honestly think replace use anti-bacterial soap regular soap.

Either way, say functional hypochondriac back then. enough, used also worry massive amount stress social gathering home simply making sure house clean.

You’re going live this. Everything said possible CDC said OK unmask you’re vaxxed going back unless cases get control again. won’t vaccines work. I’ve got mine I’m worried  BioNTech vaccine 75% effective South African variant 95% British. efficacy Indian variant would according results somewhere between, probably closer value British variant.

By way, even though likely infected South African variant variants vaccinated (if variants spreading equally), mean effective spreader infected. infections caused superspreaders viral load still reduced significantly vaccine, meaning lot less likely infect anyone.

All sensationalism mutations far really translate real situation. enough people vaccinated, vaccines slow spread **any** known variants enough stop exponential growth without measures. means us living normal lives again. Risk groups probably get booster Winter, slow community spread minimize personal risk infection. less variants vaccine effect wearing time.   HR - company we’re allowing employees go maskless long bring vaccine card sign it. actually going fine. registration vaccines mess, utter failure. Around 40% adults least partially vaccinated around 13% adults fully vaccinated. Assuming 80% adults wants vaccine, means already vaccinated 50% adults currently want vaccine. Hopefully government manage push vaccination readiness 85% coming 1.5 months reach 85% adults least partially vaccinated beginning July (1-4 July) goal. what, exactly, going stop this? solution country clearly vaxxed people wear masks forever subset community ‘might’ infect children low risks point. You’re going let go.

Have heart though. Many people still wearing masks anyway now. study? talking CDC guidelines here. 

The latest guides based studies research? can't understand gov willing gamble everything people gone through.

Untill global pandemic control foreign travel discouraged new red-listed countries locked immediately weeks time everyone's chance come back. small portion student vaccinated, school rescinded mask policy Thursday wasn’t following CDC guideline beg with. didn’t clarify ages health situation hospitalized. 90s, you’d get taken hospital precaution anyway. understand that's different many unknowns surrounding coronavirus time straight fucking idiot. I'd rather kid grow weird brain, heart, lung damage.

Don't bring ""poor social skills"" argue children put risk adults discomforted mask. something else. would silly suggest otherwise since kid 16 fully vaccinated mathematically end school year locations anyway. wait weeks completely normal 2021-22 year. fact many doubt something like vaccines show privilege first world countries, look India variants becoming ever transmissible leaving unvaccinated people likely catch die. pandemic over! time put masks, put away vaccines, celebrate! Order gin tonic, earned it, America! many people described fun? facility work (6000+ people), allowing fully vaccinated people go without masks. company arranged people vaccinated site arranged people get vaccinated offsite. know people get vaccinated, mainly shut much hoax is. policy change came work Friday. Monday going shit show. Totally anecdotal realize area might represent average American area since part taking covid seriously since beginning state announce changing mask mandate reflect CDC guidelines honor system now. mall yesterday pretty busy literally everyone wearing mask still. honestly shocked since good vaccine uptake half adult population fully vaccinated. 

I expecting see least few. ones saw people sitting tables actively eating/drinking couple nose/chin it’s basically change announcement. got 2nd shot I’m technically fully vaxed yet personally planning still wear mask crowded indoor places like mall, grocery store etc numbers low doesn’t bother it’s extra bit protection. surprised see apparently everyone else feels way! think wear masks another months. read think wear forever? seriously telling rather risk brain heart damage kid wear mask around people? takes months figure side effects children vaccine. Show empathy.  lying unvaccinated people go maskless, 1) infect cannot vaccinated (children, immunocompromised, cancer patients); 2) raise rate breakthrough infections; 3) increase probability new variants. behavior existential example ‘moral hazard’.  Better upgrade N95s.  CDC said masking necessary vaccinated people. Yall say ""follow science"" science disagrees fearmongering worldview ""big brother needs protect us lying science""

The goal changed ""flatten curve"" ""wait vaccine"" ""we need 0 cases/day live life again"" ""honestly even hit 0 still panicking, guys"" People eat raw eggs?

Yes, people Japan eat raw eggs mix rice, also use raw eggs dip sukiyaki/hot pot dishes. eggs Japan really fresh ‘Breaking news: one person entire world covid now!’

‘How supposed know person is? started one case look happened. I’m gonna stay masked cause care others everyone same. it’s still possible get COVID spread even you’re vaccinated, happened friends cousins great uncles therapists’ gynocologist.’ book comes out, actual facts

So said teacher right, grammar spelling though guess. never mixed masks. want public going creating N95 mask shortage crucial healthcare workers. r/oneJoke I’m lying lmao, don’t defend antivaxxer, it’s bad look COVID nobody knows stay 5 years. know vaccines work like magic case risks stay within unvaccinated. 

As right now.

the vaccines surprise everybody. Probably effective human creation ever made. Nothing human-made gets kind response far. NOTHING . cars, computer programs, electronics, planes, bridges. NOTHING.

it's miracle change lives dramatically terms protection viruses Right?! VACCINATED need wear masks anymore

Out real world, opposed ivory towers CDC, completely idiotic.

This decree gives people feel like wearing mask permission wear it. assume almost everyone, whether vaccinated not. institution person going set arbiter whether someone vaccinated, even technically possible.

So effect, US said ""it's okay everyone stop wearing masks."" idea anyone public health role would say anything remotely like this, especially spent year trying get everyone *wear* mask.

I predict another notorious self-own CDC.  Yeah, parent really excited progress potential take kid world set us back looks like another year.  vaccine crowd “let’s grow variants escape vaccine protection” crowd. Hope back square one coming months. solid understanding psychology. That's mask recommendation persisted long did. Otherwise could said vaccinated people could drop earlier. probably will. lie eat hot chip Fingers crossed, we're yet. heard DNA vaccine. googled it, said DNA vaccines safe mRNA vaccines.
Anyone details? thinking herd immunity including folks natural immunity, also. understand last forever. vaccinate enough folks within window time many people natural immunity, trick? can't tell smiling haves make need work observation skills.  Buffoon spelled U bro agree masks quasi-permanent like security checks? Oh well... guess I'll fly less future. Yes premiums might go up, isn’t exactly people pay insurance? insure get sick…?    Yes, made sense time give 80% protection hospitalisation people possible. 

Then numbers went super low. 

Now maths changed new variant, makes sense give 50-65yo extra 10% give 30yo first dose. Yesss love mom pieces, know best days. rough childhood mental health problems. I've always said loves much knows to.

Even knowing still makes crazy sometimes 🤪

ETA: went Dr nurse made small comment heartbeat little fast. Within next week sure something seriously wrong heart point Dr hooking heart monitor 48 hours. tells anything 🤣🤣 surprising people would distrust CDC guidance continue going extra precautions. We're talking agency recently admitted virus airborne admitted sooner would've deeper impact reopening heavy restrictions be. possible completely contained virus?  everyone says they’ll lie* meta. sisters nurse. anti Vax plenty vaccines refuses get. Mainly sees many unnecessary seen inner workings privatized health care pharmaceutical industry... well realizes care profit wellness. wants support good health, profit margins. course fucking will! It’s almost half Americans selfish assholes give fuck anyone themselves! cool thing I'm vaccinated, trust him! He's rude, ultimately poses threat me. kitchen?! Many many things... need 60-75% population fully vaccinated Herd Immunity really relevant Covid. US currently 37.1% population fully vaccinated. (47.4% least 1 dose). might well forget herd immunity. Sorry Pessimistic. 

Data percentage vaccinated CDC. Herd Immunity Threshold Wikipedia.. legitimately something thought year. introduction Covid-Passport (like many suggested one point) way see avoid people liars. tell,in places world-wide, record specific person getting shots. record shot used. personal record getting shots, piece paper scribbles... aren’t already forged, soon. Obviously bringing covid-passport would bring legal challenges, you’re kinda left trust model... We’ll see goes, guess! longer protected reinfection February 2020. India's densely populated areas already estimated 51+% population already Covid, yet folks mild asymptomatic cases caught Covid three months. Natural immunity quite short lived second infection often worse first.  Anecdotal, course, ""masks required"" signs dropping like flies around area. starts nuanced term habit becoming nearly meaningless sloganeering entering wider circulation.  facing extreme shortage vaccine one cares politicians, that's [approval rating lower cockroaches traffic mean lie. Downvoted truth? name Este lives Orlando. Trust science, except don’t like . Dont need expert know people lie People chose wear masks became political statement, point blank. tatoo v forhead. joking part based numbers still see half people wearing masks right People paying fake CDC vaccination cards. pretty stupid vaccine free.    Jab England.

Jag Scotland.

 (the divide clear cut - someone jumps tells I'm wrong) COURSE HUMANS GOING LIE, HUMANS! HAVENT LEARNED ANYTHING PAST PRESIDENT GLOBAL PANDEMIC?! There’s way could get shit together time. would absolute shit show. one really wants lines outside everywhere QR codes scanned. It’s hard though? Neither forehead temp checks scanning ticket barcode. Anything like cause bottlenecks, probably making people congregate becoming counterproductive. may seem simple government doesn’t efficient rollouts. recreational cannabis rollout like slapstick comedy. 

The passports aren’t gonna happen. Yeah cruises maybe flights you’ll required show proof wear mask beyond that. People still annoyed take shoes checkin shoe bomber. medical surveillance state stuff isn’t mainstream. turn wrong feel free give shit. hard say. dont know facts. Maybe 5 times people one jab exposed virus. clear two jabs better...  And? Aren’t protected?  care I've buying annual stickers vehicles state parks years, even go twice per year. nice able go whim want, obviously great past year outdoor time. first year we've hiked year-round. see us keeping up. vaccine protects you, TF cares? vaccine doesn’t affect transmission, disease course. Hospitals 5+ year low. Let go move on. virus circulating mutating actually trains EVERYONE’s immune system respond better variants. It’s amazing people understand basic science behind viral behavior.   Frail person hospitalized when? 4 weeks second dose, that? article isn’t people India, it’s people U.K. Americans would definitely hide zombie bite lie vaccination status. Even really already Covid, situation India proving natural immunity quite short lived. Mild asymptomatic cases providing, best, three months protection reinfection. Liars gonna lie. assume vaxed keep distance  Exactly!    may low vaccine rate communities might prompted people get vaccinated. many low vaccine rate communities leaders would refuse follow guidelines refuse enforce state level mandates regarding guidelines. Essentially, communities local leadership already refusing enforce mask occupancy mandates anything push vaccines people. best friend similar happen. 24 hours symptoms, went away, came back twice. think ten days came back second time, it.

It’s also possible you’ve caught something (doesn’t covid), I’d watch see lasts, yes, it’s possible could vaccine-related. yesterday overheard man bar say “I identify vaccinated individual” 🤦🏻‍♂️ Mmmmmmmhm never want smile someone share facial expressions public again...? Idk. I’d understand weeks even months, forever? Nah. far higher 66%, based upon 2 weeks get far higher 5-6 week timeline two based upon. shit lol Honestly, won’t lie. vaccinated don’t mask. shocking news, experts say water wet. want vaccine feel bad everyone else doesn’t… thoughts won’t wasted you. Sorry sorry. hope start get countries vaccines don’t want US  Exactly. studies like 1 dose still gave 80% protection going around. sample sizes small. CDC still filled Trumpoids. Take caution information coming likely quackery. first thought heard CDC whatevs called (I'm American) said longer necessary vaccinated people. business I'd keep requirements, personally. trust anti-mask types people get vaccinated tell truth. awesome crowd. Third major combat event done now. Cool, got first earlier today. We're past point 

Not quite yet. got Moderna vaccine soon allowed get second shot 5/7. cares. get yourself. That’s worry about. ""experts"" i.e. everyone who's ever met one magat nutjobs related idiots say safe 3 feet, said difference safety 3 feet 6 feet negligible. Sure, debate that. I’m wondering agnostic position we’re taking natural immunity. It’s one thing say “we don’t know,” superabundance cases study, question becomes, “why don’t know?” forget study it? study ignore results? like results? It’s head-scratcher. immunocompromised reduces efficacy believe. That's people taking immunosuppressants though know applies you. Definitely case-by-case basis. think person responded panicking sky falling. first talking point usually ""people can't take medical reasons"" really people allergic ingredients. still comply state local laws. Also private business rules. Children 12 significant risk Covid-19. Fairly certain 2 year safest group covid 19, even vaccinated people.. You’re one taking risk, really. you’re forcing others take risk may want take actions. something like this, disease anything, affects unwillingly subjects others potential harm, think whole singular. can’t wear simple piece cloth sometimes, I’m sorry you’re kind asshole. worlds biggest introvert....except comes going games. point it’s high fives hugs talking strategy people around President Biden publicly announced it. I'm sure company ignores news, but, might simply take time catch up. Sorry suffer meantime something deemed meaningless :\ Article paywalled right endanger fellow citizens public spaces. regular mask nothing, want n95. different perspective parent child chronic lung disease. Perhaps healthy child, would fastly different perspective. 300 kids died COVID US. CDC puts IFR 17 20 1,000,000. Focus things actually dangerous children instead scaring piss something negligible. miss days helicopter parents germaphobes laughed instead catered to.  know sundays always lowest day week it’s super cool see numbers teens entirely speculation, extremely unlikely variant immune vaccine. Please stop spreading misinformation. cares? everyone full access vaccinated, want wear mask, let wear masks.

People say wear seatbelts don't. 

It's choice longer putting risk since everyone vaccinated now. 

You're taking risk getting vaccinated. see still wear mask others fears (vaccinated since January).

Open discussion. that's odd, many bars &amp; restaurants Los Angeles places, one big free all. figure taking chances semi-crowded bar/eatery willing roll dice anyway. could understand family place like bowling alley lots kids who're unvaccinated, adult venue figure patrons decide want drink &amp; drive make best judgment covid safety.

That's...a bit much. That's extremely unlikely even variant come countries enough vaccines. 3

I wished they'd waited bit longer people get vaccinated. there's still plenty people getting vaccinated daily don’t know else CDC supposed proceed assumption vaccines effective are.

With caution?

We went hellish year. bit caution unobtrusive safety measure realm possibility. can’t force people get shots, anti-maskers continue refuse shots, can’t get shots otherwise want can’t get vaccinated, people want shot getting it. 

It became 12+ days ago. I’m sure many people rushed immediately get shots, take weeks widely vaccinate cohort. way forward CDC pre-existing guidance

What mean? 2.5 weeks ago, began slow-walking rollout policy changes. feasible proceed CDC finally threw hands said “ok, want deal Covid? Fuck it, Covid want.”

I get you’re saying, really attitude want government body whose charge protect public health. Exasperation good place make policy.

 UK ministers announced return overseas holidays – travellers required show proof negative tests, vaccine passports horizon – Guardian also learned anti-vaxxers people arriving Britain poorer nations make significant number buying forged pandemic month MPs told 100 people day trying enter UK using fake Covid test certificates individuals attempt get around current entry requirements, include tests travel cost individuals hundreds pounds. taking account, referred numerous studies transmission, infections, symptom severity. period April UK (and still is) well vaccination. Sure added risk travel really worry high enough rate vaccination I'm still seeing people wear masks inside stores dropped mandate, I've seen masks outside, great. understand big fuss either way. inconvenient wear mask wear shirt. debate?

I'm fully vaccinated, really need wear mask. someone wants to, sure. cares? follow science! 

For real though please go get vaccine move life. Ooo science gatekeeper. think science defend itself. 

Not anti-science, think like government organization CDC perfect.

I perspective parent child chronic lung condition. Perhaps healthy child perspective would different. Immunocompromised vaccinated. It’s live vaccine risk getting vaccinated.  shit, people currently lie medical excuse wear one  question is, even matter lie? you’re risk get vaccine. CDC knew reasonable way enforce rules. They're naive.

Where people getting notion from? would think CDC assuming this? issued advice **specifically individuals vaccinated**. seems even Dr. Walensky acknowledges interview ""This Week"" linked article:

""The guidance released Thursday individuals individuals risk vaccinated. vaccinated safe, vaccinated safe. still wearing mask better yet get vaccinated""

""This permission widespread removal masks... decisions made jurisdictional level, community level"" Idk going make things better worse you, masks aren’t effective want be. 

I work school setting counselor room 20 kids ranging grades K-5. still mask policy effect. doesn’t matter. Kids take off. lose them. fall off. chew them. double masked kept distanced still caught covid. 

Kids young good distancing also young effectively mask. view bigger issue restrict lives dutifully brought us point. endured hardship got vaccination numbers solid point. There's reason punished victory here. 

To otherwise would let antivaxxers hold us hostage. follow science? Well that’s dumbest thing I’ve read today. Thanks that. swear people want covid restrictions forever know, going let go, no…. Please tell part saying useless and\or harmful? Someone correct I’m wrong, someone isn’t vaccinated doesn’t want wear mask person endanger themselves? that’s case matter much? expert 70+ million probably lie daily basis, especially ones Trump flags, rest potential. Immunocompromised people get antibody test determine need continuously wear n95 mask.  terrible parents disagree. may say, they're saying ""gotcha"". another adaptation think millions people dying suffering long term health issues hoax. No, it’s pretty close.

See Hoping gym chain drops mandate soon - put masks stores, working sucks. Really cares? wasn’t vaccinated got sick stupid enough go get infected, get deserve. whole plot force people comply die. Either way; entire family bubble vaccinated I’m worried. Okay, write like mate, wtf... xD    Go Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿! people can't get vaccinated? Immunocompromised first get vaccinated (such myself). Also, children 12 significant risk Covid-19. shit.  authorized emergency use. I'm sick weak argument CDC cancelled. expensive people lie way. be? CDC guidance prior shift purpose enforcing mask compliance unvaccinated reached point American adults ample time get vaccinated. 

We're past point guidance abruptly shifted. safe vaccinated people, known so, since real world data collected Israel February. Sure, there's follow up, evidence prior. 

The shift coincides inflection point supply outpaced demand concretely. 

If vaccinated want take masks, free authority CDC President United States backing you. Enjoy summer! course people lie! matter people vaccinated, protected. matter people not, liars not. What’s problem? risk vaccinated , wanting vaccines vaccinated. want roll risk, consequence death Covid alone. move now? gonna spend 2021 bickering masks ?  Looks like great time. can't wait huge venue full people - coming someone who's generally introverted. obese. I'm glad should. However UK using AZ using lit Pfizer too. really isn't, people severely hurting kids allowing interact children go school. party liars continue lying. also super annoying. I’m wearing masks still (although follow cdc guidance first foremost) feeling next weeks/months going frustrating lot us. don’t need policy make lives miserable. Covid anyway. Same. They’re sick, they’re infectious. count vaccine working. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  12-15 age cohort *just* become eligible. None fully vaxxed yet. many people won’t get sick, I’m hoping people do. make choices life. guidances place. based upon science, based upon liberal hysteria. It’s strange see happening fast. It’s like abortion climate change time really dig heels establish really strong feelings side. Say me: free football tickets  Comparing % population least 1 dose 50 States, 10 Canadian provinces 3 Canadian territories, Mississippi comes dead last.

States North East Hawaii top

Source:  Canada-US regions see full list Thanks sharing story too! helpful talk others sharing struggles. I’m glad experience vaccine manageable. I’ve heard people symptoms disorder actually improve getting vaccinated. really hope get it, end one those, I’ll still happy things stay don’t get much worse. significant number patient polls disorder gotten worse.

I wish none us worry it, I’m grateful kind people understand. makes less isolating would dealing own. 

Do careful, even vaccine. still haven’t released data well protected. don’t know high vaccination rate live, it’s still safer meet outside, distance, wear mask (especially indoors) know protection immunocompromised auto-immune. well! already Los Angeles. lose couple people like you, gain much larger portion. given choice going mask required place one require it, people choose go one without masks. Thus taking away mask requirements makes sense. kid can't get vaccinated CDC proven pandemic become politicized incompetent I’m Texas elderly chronic illness vaccinated. Italy countries get vulnerable residents vaccinated AZ would stop deaths.  moderna Pfizer available give younger adults. coworkers side country joining percentage!!! Aw hellz no. think generally right except one thing. population people yet vaccinated, plan get vaccinated wear masks seems pretty negligible me. I'm suggesting permanent lockdown. comparing idea needing lockdown sake kids idea permanent flu lockdown, flu Covid comparable risk levels children. Basically trying say think kids needs lockdown Covid, needed lockdown higher risk (to them) flu?  One percent? zero kids 12 vaccinated .. Zero kids 16 fully vaccinated. 50% adults vaccinated. get info? - last year's encouraged people cultivate magnify hypochondria even worse before. This. It’s awkward time kids twelve. files computer? idea permanent lockdowns never table, someone always bring up. makes immediately dismiss ideas.  Come northeast, fine here. social cohesion, educational attainment, average income comparable northern European nations. also far likely die something else covid compared covid together.

As 20 year old could partied year long probably less likely die covid compared car accident.

Safety personal opinion. CDC could say maybe 0.01% children die infected risk small enough opinion. Schools part country start early mid August. Regardless stance forcing vaccination public school attendance, practical way happen (at least first semester). shooting breeze, area, handful brand-new Walmarts nice suburban areas much nicer 30 year-old Target buildings. kids growing thinking Walmart nicer Target. Teenagers Jnj vaccine well, won’t bother going whole 5 week timeline.  Oh ok hell could Menards permanent work home? home improvement store, lol.  B1672 B117 time. 4 different index cases identified current clusters. technically, we're actually 4 different outbreaks time. Yeah but. care others? Like least know could like ""they chose problem"" dont. care others. think might latent hypochondria society coming full force right now.

Like can't lefty Trump supporting family members weird situation I'm actually following CDC they're still hunkering layering much anti-bacterial skin peeling off, right?   theory vaccinated even infected spreading Covid least spreading easily. They’re still collecting data make definitive determination vaccine non-responders. titer testing pregnant, fully vaccinated four different diseases wasn’t immune to. got pregnant, got lot shots discharged us hospital.

So yes, I’m vaccinated covid, since January. trust I’m 94%? particularly. Yeah I'm concerned it. also I'm resigned fact people act proactively. think we'll see regional outbreaks US over. new India variant shows ability escape current vaccines, besides vaccine rates many US states low stop spread. India variant like 2-3x contagious initial Covid strain, last variant either. enjoying lull lasts, like enjoyed last summer northeast.  Oh yeah nastiest chills time felt hot, blanket yet also fan pointed face ice pack.

I used asthma kid that’s gone otherwise I’m healthy, nausea stopped 30 hrs brief breaks took Tylenol threw up. woke 5am went bed 12am recovered nastiest case indigestion (I starving eaten 10pm).

I also Pfizer, absolutely zero reaction first shot, barely even soreness. Weirdly enough barely even noticed first needle go second one hurt real bad.  see indication we're talking right now, are, that's pretty short sighted. we've past year+, looking two weeks thinking needs happen prevent another terrible year? Enjoy view high horse! end, lack social life work disliked work home.

There's social life *at* work, too. fun way ""It's way easier communicate collaborate person"" type thing makes projects much smoother. that's stores employees confront anti-maskers. bad business put workers way crazy people. reason wearing mask, even though vaccinated, signal everyone around wear mask hopefully help convince anyone unvaccinated anti vaxx continue masking next 4-6 weeks. Eventually stop wearing mine given vaccinated. now, want play part encouraging anti vaxxers go maskless.

Bottom line: empathy care others. level risk willing take them

Absolutely. characterize nature likelihood risks. know much long COVID, negatively impacted many kids died hospitalized. me, it’s big deal wear mask brief period time I’m store. Personally I’ll keep wearing mask little long. I’d like see people vaccinated less 10k new daily cases. weeks month maybe I’ll change mind regardless Sinopharm uses dead coronavirus.

J&amp;J, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V use genetically modified adenovirus (a common cold variety chimpanzees).

Pfizer &amp; Moderna deliver mRNA instructions create covid spike protein. International travel going require vaccination. question that. Countries want deal let anyone in. Currently Las Vegas cuz I’m vaxxed ready live!

Anyway, idea vaccine cards. 

Since don’t want mandatory checks prove vaccination (mainly workers don’t deserve conflict would cause), VOLUNTARY station vaccinated people go want…and hotel give wristband something declares officially vaccinated?

You walk around unmasked assure people around wristband you’re dick.

Those maskless without wristbands would obvious people careful around them. 

Also make people without wristband much self conscious fucking lying everyone around them.

Probably worth grocery store setting, definitely could useful resort setting I’m in. See options 2 3 then. Sucks really isolate, unfortunately can't realistically expect everyone lock lives time past 14 months sake small percentage people alternative options avoid Covid. way understand it’s chance mutation thing able strike back next winter. unvaccinated people higher chance happen. would continue wear masks would really helpful effort. sure going happen. all. also ignoring statistics occurring. incidence rate serious symptoms children low CDC determined something spend time concerning with. Drive carefully, child far, far likely seriously injured killed car wreck experience serious covid symptoms.  democrats care economy optics much Republicans. Accuracy horrible metric use analyzing ai/ml results unbalanced dataset. 

Per article, 4 5 patients complications detected, 80% accuracy. many false positive there? 50? 100? many false negatives?

For know, said 200 people going complications 4 actually still missed 1.  Yeah, kind ""no shit"", correlation ≠ causation kind thing. think get past 70. Especially talking total population. hit point required school along vaccines public schools require, give us incredibly high percentages 18 group. 18-22 going see huge boost late summer many many colleges requiring next semester. Combine incentives making even easier get vaccine whenever want keep numbers coming adults. Obviously rate keep dropping, think least continue see somewhere .1 .2 percent per day time come adult vaccinations. get vaccinated, still undergoing chemo doctor told wait immune system recovers.   Feel pain getting kit, 12 week lead time.

Sure know VPN, Multi Factor Authentication vital - load businesses got hit early on. Also ensure MFA email (office 365).

We delivered security training time giving laptops. Talking fishing emails social engineering. Making sure people reuse personal work passwords. also moved 3 word passwords expire - sure feel this, decision think getting old.

If looking cloud, look immutable backups - incremental synthetic backups helping speed costs. Air gapped, off-site write holy trinity. Trader Joes someplace feel like wear mask time anyway. Well keep wearing mask like CDC said. Idk, see 60% crossed, Israel least enough bring new cases sharp drop. given rural population generally less vaccinated population dense cities (if I'm mistaken), means take vaccine high chance getting virus either. regional. lead large county country Dane County, Wisconsin. State capitol, university tech, high information. They've given least first doses 63% entire population, 12-16 eligible starting Thursday. 53% considered fully vaccinated. 95% (!) 65+ census population fully vaccinated.

Places like well 70% kids eligible. agree. It’s guud   Same...I went Walmart...Walmart saw randos without masks. Food understand, hell people thinking toilet paper essential surviving?? live CA eligibility opened public 1 month ago. time, appointments. available ones May. given people need 2 shots, still need wait 2 weeks second become vaccinated, need give time fully protected.

Even someone CA got first dose **day** eligibility opened up, would STILL fully protected today. yet mask mandates fully lifted. people got May, need give June get full protection.

Teenagers became eligible.

And no, gave people warning need get vaccinated x date fully protected reopening date, would push further. -Avoid non-covid illnesses

-Set example non-vaxxed kids Mississippi 5th worst rate per capita [statista difference much harder implement good diet, exercise, mental self help, etc. etc. etc. give 1-2 IM injections. I'm disagreeing premise many hospitalizations preventable, I'm disagreeing premise care vaccinated. obviously good financial reasons care. cares? long vaccinated, unvaccinated person unmasking poses threat you. idiots hurting themselves, which, honesty, seems perfectly fine me. meantime 90% spread virus asymptomatically vaccinated unvaccinated alike spread vulnerable people ""Im vaccinated/asymptomatic I'm bulletproof incapable transmission lmao.""  2nd dose vaccine yesterday, side effects bedridden me.

**Fully vaccinated estimates**

Using date 95% adults dose 1, get second dose 31 days later (1 month Moderna), plus additional 14 days immunity kick in, put us date of: Thursday, August 26th, 95% adults fully vaccinated.

Notes: 

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC data, however, percentages take account entire herd, higher 2020 population compared 2019's used CDC. Also note 12+ number available 2019 population values. covid rate one year higher, it’s higher two years neglecting health. it’s personal (and families) attention, can’t genuinely tell states combating childhood obesity obesity general NEARLY much covid. 300k year something could easily addressed. You’re making quite assumption think vaccinated adults following current cdc recommendations crying Reddit year staying home. Sounds like scenario crafted head make feel better point view. numbers people getting vaccinated plummeting people getting shot already gotten it. long wait people getting vaccinated moving on? may come shock you. fewer children sick COVID-19 compared adults, children infected virus causes COVID-19, get sick COVID-19, spread virus causes COVID-19 others. Children, like adults, COVID-19 symptoms (“asymptomatic”) still spread virus Choosing continue wear mask whatever reason, stupid not, doesn’t harm anybody. wearing mask throughout pandemic helped spread virus. Big difference. updated guidance based on? studies? Serious question, trying get information.  vaccine that’s correct plenty hospitalizations could negated person choices. It’s thorough argument. know friend getting 13 year old son vaccinated next week. last group 12. question good date FDA approve use age group?  matters folks want can't get vaccine due health issues :( collectively can't bothered protect weakest amongst us  Yes, never mentioned. I'm asking others don't. I’m parent child cannot vaccinated yet due age. waltz Costco unmasked, don’t want expose child cannot take child errands. Reading way phrased made realize depressing answer, “what number dead kids” familiar phrasing. US gives precisely zero fucks kids die school shootings every year, course “tough shit” attitude applies well. 

Thanks least helping see they’ve callously tossed aside time. I’m taking libertarian view. got vaccine. You’re fucking own. think bigger question care random person internet (or really anyone) chooses do? Someone wearing mask hurt get it

The CDC say WEAR MAKSKS, said wear mask. big difference country, Romania, sending incoming AZ jabs Moldova Simple, say state without 50% population vaccinated can’t team go college football play offs. Saban would blow darting people J&amp;J shot within 24 hours  mandatory going school almost exceptions. I’m sure rates before, know least states, like California, recently limited exceptions well due low vaccination rates led multiple outbreaks measles, etc. Yeah school wear two masks (big nose, doubling keeps place) cannot wear glasses mean, that’s two different studies two different medical teams two different parts world covid commonality, showing similar results. would shelve scientific term “may be” moment understand may common parlance may scientific terms same. likely causing issues children large enough sample yet scientists wait studies data come saying anything conclusive. Good god. country screwed.  Right. “He never tested positive never tested him”.

Sorry jab, read article. unfortunately couldn’t comprehend it.  UK requirement anyone age 12 wear mask teachers expected wear one teaching them. death 12. odds young children dying tiny. TBH, there's two types antivaxxers: want wear masks forever, never wore mask whole time. Three things happen:

1. Fence sitters either get vaxxed not. doubt many last guy store wearing mask. I’m guessing 2/3 - 3/4 end getting jab. Many rest get antibodies old fashioned way. 
2. Kids 12 get vaxxed. Younger hopefully stay masked they’re eligible vaccines. 
3. unvaxxed &amp; unmasked going get us herd immunity hard way.  Neeeooope. I've learned anything pandemic, half people country care killing fellow citizens know them. He's bear.  enough children would tested show effects, asymptomatic otherwise. could cause dangerous variant nobody knows! :/ No. angry! fully vaccinated too, everyone interact family ties, coworkers, bosses, etc. protects much. No, go bars. needs school. needs go doctor appointments. occasionally needs public various things. He's largely kept friends, school, teachers, extended family, year. impacts. complete lack compassion empathy display past 15 months astounding. ""Too bad kid could die trying get education, like go bar friends."" organizations inherently politics way. They've asleep last year... Tiny group people? Including water food  Well, technically.... “Never tested positive” doesn’t mean tested negative. could mean never tested — point. forgive unnecessary jab. I'm US free speech freedom express opinion? lying purpose... even opinion, right? would think way subreddit last year everyone would arms mask 35% population vaccinated people politicized much lot people don’t even want vaccine Got - thanks! answer question directly, CDC probably doesn’t data you’re interested in. Yea. infuriates me. concern children. country really doesn’t give two shits kids. Right. Fuck anti mask people. obvious.

But literally 74 million children, half cannot vaccinated, exposed people lying vaccinations businesses over?

Tough shit them? They're completely innocent.

And yes, kids get less. get that. get it. get long haul. die.

What number dead kids worth best slight inconvenience folks wearing mask cases dropped enough kids risk? really want fucking know.

Is wearing mask hard inconvenience we're gonna accept certain number dead kids it?

No one seems answer beyond ""Tough shit. Deal, lmao."" true all. Flu vaccine works blood cancer people, Covid vaccine much. Wouldn’t sure that. OSHA came guidelines suggesting employers require vaccinations held liable side effects injuries vaccines may cause it’ll technically considered work-place injury. make statement, earlier, original comment. thought basis questions, statement made: ""isn’t still small risk associated spread virus, since there’s always chance mutation?"".

Ohh meant I'm correct there's always chance mutation virus propagates. see mean now. Thanks clarifying! shitty thing antivaxxers put people can’t get vaccines risk.

Regardless, shouldn’t criminalize choice like that. Make hard maybe, vaccine passport system made impossible go events. That’s reasonable.

But say 2022 someone gets covid dies could gotten vaccinated year prior, that’s them. Sure burdens healthcare system etc. people assume risk willingly avoid getting vaccine. failed every corner certain level IQ society refuses play rules. see different.  also wrote comment partially response BraidyPaige saying it’s likely getting struck lightning. That’s necessarily true. It’s self correcting problem covid. Fuck. No.  doesn’t really matter it’s due child infected someone vaccinated breakthrough infection honest.

It matter taking away masks social distancing children vaccinated could provide vector rampant virus spread among children increases likelihood dangerous mutation. That's I'm asking - likely something CDC considered new guidance masks needed indoors adults vaccinated? Personally I’d thrown fit pharmacy saw would least phoned legal knowledge see could sue malpractice. could infected someone HIV many diseases Yes this! Desktops VPN issues

Ours do

*Cries compliance hell*  I'd also look Sierra counties. Sierras San Joaquin Valley least impressive people. No. I’ve hardly heard cases like well. However, friend mine tested positive around Easter tested positive last week, 2 months difference. asymptomatic times though, maybe plays it. FUCK BUSINESSES GOING VERIFYING PEOPLE WALKING AROUND MASKLESS VAXXED???? feeling majority folks even aware world outside US never seen passport life.

Just hunch though. Personally, someone autoimmune disorder/immunocompromised person, I'm waiting see studies effective vaccine works people specific immune issues. much, much likely die caught covid19 non-immunocompromised person. 

So me, I'd feel tad bit better waited closer everyone fully vaccinated closer herd immunity (in specific area, we're 35% fully vacc'd 45% one dose vacc'd). people outside specific issue? That's understandable. I'll waiting either see studies showing get efficacy reach full herd immunity. He's risk severe COVID, tho. point. technically comorbidity. say whatever wants actual state NY seems done masks, especially upstate. see people wearing masks anywhere, walk stores even employees mask near even CDC announcement. There's one feels like actually enforcing mask rules people care. mentioned, teach college. ""open"" lot classes, including mine, online hybrid.

They keep masks K12 kids chance vaccindated, sitting close quarters poor ventilation day, (though state governor moron told people to) keep healthcare settings, risk kids getting covid going store extremely low. long kids staying store? high viral load going be? 

I worn masks religiously since moment told to, MADE tons masks, given away... done them. still wear church forseeable future bishop says so, otherwise, I'm done. whole family vaccinated. Everything keep seeing Sep 6+ Q4 under.

But I'm lazy find sources things change take will. keeping eye though I'd love kids (5 &amp; 2) vaccinated. Uhhh lmao Im giving business places dropping masks right now. slap face disabled immunocompromised customers (and employees) cannot get vaccinated still need shop. masks dropped couple months reach herd immunity. loathe throwing essential workers chronically ill wolves pandemic entering store chooses this.  work McDonald's? make statement, earlier, original comment. thought basis questions, statement made: ""isn’t still small risk associated spread virus, since there’s always chance mutation?"". responding overall yes, correct, still risk mutation allow virus continue spread freely among children.

I think communication across comments little mark, worries man discussion, sometimes harder communicate text. there’s way determining why/how would mutate evade vaccines. could infects enough children mutation appears way could mutate someone immunocompromised. would likely never know patient 0 vaccine-proof variant is. Regardless, unchecked infections, likely virus could mutate worse.it doesn’t really matter it’s due child infected someone vaccinated breakthrough infection honest. Seems you’re focusing wrong part issue.

Edit: key point, idea evolution store, previously stated. expert opinion CDC means less baseless feelings? I’m honestly shocked changed opinion Trump instead doubling down.

But guess typical republican behavior care issue affects personally. Good job .nl! Stroopwafel everyone!  They’re still required state. 

The science doesn’t matter anymore guess. like it?   find hard believe. don’t share needles ever common knowledge medical providers utilize tools like Google meet kick off, share, discuss projects. share screen like would office. I'm actually pretty confused part think needs done person. Here’s Alan Arnettes comments:[Everest 2021 first expedition cancellation citing Ahh gotcha. fair, interpreted question way commenter did. still, look link, see already new variants less affected vaccines. still think answer question yes, virus allowed spread among children, would cause virus mutate, possible could mutate make vaccines ineffective. u wait long get vax you’re worried. knew coming think there’s still lot unknowns, unfortunately. ex. eight Yankee players fully vaccinated got Covid week, seven asymptomatic. impression asymptomatic, didn’t Covid. So, think still don’t know certain things. baby already battle certain health issues. Wearing mask grocery store doesn’t phase point.  many US though?

Per article:

Médecins Sans Frontières, Doctors Without Borders English, said Thursday government's ""failed response"" pandemic led thousands avoidable deaths.

""More one year Covid-19 pandemic, failed response Brazil caused humanitarian catastrophe,"" Dr. Christos Christou, president Doctors Without Borders, said briefing reporters. ""Each week grim new record deaths infections — hospitals overflowing, yet still coordinated centralized response."" Still mandated CA 😢 knew large-ish fraction general population ethically challenged, 2020 taught big fraction friend group willing watch 500K Americans die absolutely nothing help situation. even purposely make worse. would say he’s 50 overweight, get whatever take get pfizer later on.

Lol....trust another American citizen. really. 2% 5% population dying people afraid nothing bit much accept. enough vaccine really matter. done want live look around see vaccinating non-believers still necessary. Hopefully get tough.  situation unique completely different allowing huge numbers people roam around inside stores maskless

Most schools area open I'm sure zoom teaching issue. probably rest assured knowing students getting vaccinated setting different exceptions made fully protected yet immunocompromised everyone else knows willingly potentially putting risk. overall different situation removing mask mandates general public  Thanks info!

Cancer patients chemo get vaccine though.  sister, chemo pancreatic cancer, got vaccine weeks ago. Obviously, nearly effective literally mentioned talking absolutely justified child wear mask want. get upset people trying imply states shouldn’t open vaccinated people afraid think fear overrule public health experts say.

And record, felt way people said shouldn’t mask policy WEREN’T afraid public health experts said wearing one. nothing? Vaccines aren’t 100% bother? vaccines worked 100% shouldn’t worry getting virus! Masks 80% effective there’s reason wear them! people might wear masks wrong touch faces more, it’s bad recommend masks! case, vaccine verification system (not CDC cards), even possible forge, would positive benefit society greater 0%. would wager would greater benefit costs implementing. Well every virus running around wasn’t dangerous covid19. problem turn slippery slope covid19 run rampant far behind milestone need hit achieve herd immunity universal solution.  realize long long time away right? Damn Sammy. hurt you? went store Wisconsin thought I'd see masks. I'd say 80-90% still masked. saw one dude put shortly came in, looked around saw people wearing them. feel strange wearing one now. Several costco employees grocery store employees on. CDC relaxed guidelines reflecting results study. 

The CDC knows do, relaxed guidelines vaccinated individuals even though less 50% vaccinated.   People caught SARS years ago maintained immunity Covid-19

Not trying sound snarky, source?  Disney always treads carefully. first park chain close last fully reopen parks. Well that's expected. happened though. Surprisingly Six Flags moving slowest outdoor masking...

Sea World/Busch Gardens, Universal, Cedar Fair, Hershend got done Disney. Six Flags, despite first park chain open back last summer, still masks required outdoors, though expect change really soon. Especially since Fiesta Texas, one 4 Big Parks, direct competition Sea World SA right road.  I’ve never seen obese woman’s whole ass target before, walk Walmart might first thing see. reality, no.

But since they're several rungs Wal-Mart like pretend marketing decisions think point illnesses similar symptoms. Testing negative mean covid, symptoms also mean did, drawing sort conclusion case make sense. never goal. goal make sure medical system go like India's.

We achieved goal vaccines covid rates going down. vaccinated need fear anymore unvacced.

People get sick died, vast majority Breakthrough cases fully asymptomatic exceedingly mild. unlikely much damage. many people idea vaccine passports work. know seeing people general? me. sick really didnt see people outaide household all. LOL you’re welcome check post history fixated this; I’ve posted several times going back months.

Have nice day enjoy vaccine, know did!  exactly year half? Except miracle vaccines free protect us idiots.

This victory celebration like funeral sub. I've always concerned long COVID, catch even mild case.

If vaccinated? There's proof long COVID possibility vaccinated I'm sure people would assume otherwise.  type blood clot described typical blood clot avoided blood thinning haematologists advise taking aspirin AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine affect occurrence rare vaccine-associated thrombosis thrombocytopenia (VATT), driven immune response something AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. obviously know, overcomed Covid-19-infection make immune rest life. catch get sick months. Thats vaccinating case mandatory. seems likely Covid deniers declare “vaccinated” act spread vectors virus. know, “freedom”.

And let virus circulate freely among large groups unvaccinated vaccinated people. Perfect breeding ground variant preventing happening. 2 nm better vaccine. /s won't. problem vaccinated. people would behave problem mask vaccinated mandate. people behaved recommended pandemic reached level start with. moronic decision located? Honor system  Wear mask forever. Stay home forever. you. really care. I’m vaccinated rational people. fearporn worship ridiculous. nice day. awesome, thank you. memory, estimate quite similar. 

Given position ethical one, fiscal, remains unchanged. nice know correct fiscal impact infinitesimal compared overall posted revenue. less 500k operating loss yearly 26 billion profit suggests store could operated effectively indefinitely far less 0.01% 26 billion profit.

There's reason believe choice would cause cascading loss stakeholder confidence. might ethical, future-focused approach would boost investor confidence overall; ideal world certainly would, little that's worth.  whi? I'm vaccinated I'm fine Murphy's mode thinking time. NJ crazy place get wayyyy hand days. Let's keep zipped bit longer. What?

No.

The non-patented precursors short supply choke point.

Pushing equal distribution across whole world good idea. 

It’s far better roll vaccine countries make damn thing, they’ve reached semblance control get crank vaccine everyone else.

The US absolutely start exporting now, using less make, get pushed allies across world need vaccine (really gotta focus India move mountains fight aren’t crisis mode).

But whole world time rate wouldn’t go well. It’s apparent correlation noticed early vaccination effort. Indeed, antivax states seem much lower educational attainment. always gonna risk. look numbers. Cases way deaths too. acceptable enough open everything then? I'll call bullshit can't pass covid outdoors.  Outdoors less likely like someone can't cough can't breath outside.  documented cases outdoors... hundreds millions covid cases.... Significant amounts disinformation decades-long campaign stigmatize intelligence education. Vaccines perfect. someone got vaccine, make totally immune catching disease.

Same way people chicken pox vaccine catch pox. course did, mention previous comment. Sure 50% still vaccinated still big deal.  California still 2000 cases per day.  trending still lot. used worse numb it. agree things miss, me, clear separation work home life huge. ""being"" work big mental impact me.
 
Additional reasons were
 
1) we're highly collaborative team, zoom discussions same

2) electronic engineer, use ton equipment daily basis access home. away tools massive hindrance Hahahahahaha joke. fucking course not. People faking illnesses making fake ADA cards coming imaginary laws avoid wearing masks. Honor system?? LMAO. Let’s even get whole conspiracy theories, blatant lies we’re propagated literal POTUS half US. HONOR SYSTEM??? Ya fucking right! Pfizer already supplying canada Michigan plant.  Moderna released export clause though would help ton. me. fear Cleetus walmart I'm fully vaccinated. 

My chances getting covid person store less getting car accident way store. TIL: target classy metadrama. concern, take modmail. volunteer myself, family members.

You’re welcome. 😀 Thank you. meant comment. mean another year - would make 2 years never said others couldn’t it, simply said take ignorant. Others absolutely - job doesn’t consist fuck all. year? would say maybe 3 months point almost everyone needs persuaded vaccinated vaccinated left actual antivaxxers. would wait get vaccinated? Oh wow. special. sure consolation, every new doctor I've seen asked Spiro acne, assuming I'm cis. least doctors know. ""success story"" ? “Unvaccinated people putting danger” 

Would make sense everyone chance become fully vaccinated. it’s early “their decision”. still 2.5 weeks fully vaccinated I’m pregnant—I’m high risk serious reaction virus. isn’t dangerous it’s dangerous unborn child. rolled freaking early. agree thoughts individuality it; haven’t enough time people want vaccinated get vaccinated. CD friggin C came said anywhere basically without mask vaccinated. bother vaccines work? agree, unfortunately people going get used idea unmasked =/= unvaccinated threat, fully vaxxed wearing mask required Hey everybody guy karma farming!


See. Nobody cares. think yourself? Probably haven’t even removed mask signage.

That's wore mask Walmart today even though I'm fully vaccinated hardly anyone store there. Push button get banana. Early pandemic CDC recommended masks. CDC fallible. I'm really sure someone's mental state would impact ventilation. cases, patients put deep sleep sometimes even given paralytics discomfort vent. problem today mostly developing countries Asia lockdown. Mask mall would insignificant compared considering vaccinations natural immunity western countries. mutations forward come outside west. know people fully vaccinated.

That bearing fully vaccinated person. Hence original comment stating lie bed they've made. chance get vaccinated. widely available, literally excuse.

It's point unmasked, unvaccinated go run risk world they've preaching afraid last year. They've got permission it, get sick - well TS them. got vaccinated Thursday

Help please Would appropriate to, like, laminate vaccine card wear around neck something public places? want people feel safe around 😞 unvaccinated get sick, that’s choice. That's pretty much move. really think matters no? feel like getting bitched weirdo. 

I got yelled burger king crackhead looking guy cutting line week lol. 

I walked like 3 people milling around away line stood sec said guys line? thought said walked ordered. 

Dude flipped lol 

We wearing masks heard wrong.

Like seriously? get fight ghetto burger king next office? think lot us knew bad numbers start adding up, think many people don’t care? didn’t. there's literally ZERO reason people get vaccinated.

I mean, there's whole scarred lungs, chance blood clots death thing Covid 19 going on……seems like great reason get vaccinated. Correlation equal causation. There's one theory way flu went away like viral interference.  go mask vaccination status identifies undocumented... be! Good you!! Remember Corona beer's public image took hit early  Maybe difference would make first vaccine shot non mRNA less effective. Like maybe dropping 20% effectiveness. It’s crazy think children, virtually unaffected physically covid, people made sacrifices last year. Support claim won’t. already supporting evidence. variants, keeps mutating rate, eventually new strain. won’t suddenly emerge emerge. 

Now support claim won’t. fair, nothing glorious going Walmart. Unless want bust camera lol “Normal” Covid would unmasked, don’t data for. Comparing current covid rates vs previous flu rates disingenuous. agree thats call government delivers spam bills box front live  It’s year variants. Support claim WILL.  Places like Bangkok super worrisome 11 18 days could discussion pushing back people get first shot right away April 19th. Whoever still waiting 2 weeks post second shot day continue distance wear masks, thats minority individuals. telling country 37M pass one 330M? imagine large part due age say it’s real eye opener. Like wow. things open. discussion masks. good time drop indoor mask usage would probably kids get vaccinated really bolster herd immunity. would accept genocide getting free vaccine walgreens? 100% guarantee 6.000 Americans going die Corona regardless many Americans wore masks. Masks help help extent. often indoors Disney anyway....a rides que indoors stores. allow take eating. big deal sure data accurate. please provide source? Worldometer suggests survival rate ~98% US. Based current deaths 600,000, would need 300M cases US, 90% population. wrong.

If simply taking deaths dividing total population, either ignorant dishonest. hilarious picture like 4 Big Bird. guys ultra hairy legs sticking absurd. Like bad Santa looking stuff lol Actually Salmonella contagious. People like obviously oblivious calamities places like India covid overwhelmes entire health care system hundreds thousands dying, young old. 

Because many complacent like you. Reach family friends encourage get vaccinated still haven’t. Help set appointment.

I’ve asking random people come across like workers fast food drive thru they’re vaccinated yet. they’re not, tell walk pharmacy towards end day ask one. Many wage workers don’t time energy go make appointments  part Florida in? 
I’m right outside Orlando enforced. Amen dat  next years booster! :P great, vaccine highly effective available everywhere cost lines appointments get places. Yay science! think going legitimate trend towards hybrid schedules fully-remote positions. companies resist try make everyone come back 40 hours week - lot workers leave. home safe, also saves time money. think CDC mostly cares absolute death counts. 
See decide label Telling anti-vaxx anti-mask crowd they're safe go out, lie, spread around irresponsible point.

Good thing CDC say huh? said safe fully vaccinated go maskless indoors out. First off: “if N/S distinction true”?

Holy moly, actually don’t think discussion you’re even entertaining that’s 

You test baseline toss people COVID vaccinated. J&amp;J South African study scientifically sound. masks precautions meant prevent spread vulnerable elderly people. point believe vulnerable elderly ample opportunity get vaccinated. always risk thing going away 2021 2022. point start making way back normal? one forced go walmart. grocery stores pickup delivery options. mitigate risk time let people make decisions themselves. I’m McMaster fan- believe me. signed EO past Monday saying teachers can’t enforce masks relieved. I’m done arguing students wearing masks. Heck, I’ve stopped wearing it. teachers school vaccinated chosen to. It’s honor system, grocery stores retail. gym instance, gives bracelet wear you’ve vaccinated go maskless. show vaccine card. I’m guessing shows/games/cruises/etc, show vaccine cards attend maskless all. CDC guidance definitely considers human behavior.

They said much last year questioned many unscientific suggestions(thermometers, hand washing, 6 feet rule, etc). That’s undercount sure. Take USfor instance, it’s actually around 900k 1 million per new studies. post studies, wanted. I’m understanding believe everything you’ve told vaccine efficacy would care unvaccinated stupidly decide wear masks? Full disclosure: I’m 65 fully vaccinated since March. FUCK NO! super CAPS express opinion more? Covidiots regularly removed masks inside stores checking masks door. 

Why world would anyone trust tell truth vaccination status? imagine regulated state probably overwhelmingly enforced private businesses.

As kid though remember going bowling alleys Alabama filled second hand smoke. bowling alleys smoking now. am, access test (even calling state COVID hotline recommendation) virtually nonexistent early pandemic. Heck, access care nonexistent someone meet broadly recognized symptoms time. Lack positive test equal issues.

Even still, person dealing symptoms able receive care them. ALSO cannot know everything know virus yet. sure people keep assuming know everything, even enough. yup, sure feel like I'm judged too, hopefully one bother choice to, know, something within cdc guidelines. [Severe cases Covid-19 might impact quality man's sperm, thus possibly impacting someone cannot vaccine real idiots (including afew doctors) seem believe problem's fake putting anti vaxxer performance

I really hope happen live prob gonna end heart attack 0.2% Agreed. Considering population California, that’s impressive true. company. wfh pandemic we're gonna start moving flex work. 

I like look I'm fuck, also badass setup home. gotta spend money want flex work. like half employees already remote (sales) biggest deal. said doesn’t take skill take responsibility. Sure CEO takes management skills, doesn’t mean it’s anything fuck all. Yup I'll never forget told district manager blizzard state emergency sure close knew WalMart doing. Two hours closed given green light close. worried long term effects like blood clotting. also diligently strap car seats every time get car reduce risk injury car accidents driving around always scary danger. worry lots things parent added it.  missing point. People apply much rigorous review studies like. encourage questioning things agree with.

Which bias studies get published celebrated easier get peer review reviewers go easy you. age-specific safety requirements children cars, reduce risk serious injuries death? so?  literally said last comment. fact said pisses off. Oddly enough neither company. we're working flex work policies competitive lol.

Go figure need smoker cold day see blows. easily blow someone 6 feet away certain conditions, always go straight air. say doesn’t take skill? said involved fuck all, sure skilled it. think fact Walmart got rid mandate convince them. can’t speak everyone, Target requires mask, Walmart doesn’t, I’d rather go Walmart. yup, people gonna listen that. People never wanted wear say ""oh im vaccinated"" That's standard classy though, it? seeing whole ass public. can't keep up. individual stores within still enforce masks? dont expect things change around bit, i'd really love mask wearing optional need reach 85% vaccinated even think opening up.

That never ever going happen. deeply disingenuous comment. several rungs Walmart? think one. can't think comparable big box stores Walmart target. Except shop target think they're better Walmartians. toothbrushing required either! trying figure people come stuff

do throw whatever wall see stick's kinda misscomunication took wrong way

honestly, microchip stuff feels like least realistic thing could say well work everyone supposed wear mask? makes think event worse that? 1 500

Or 0.5 250 Lol, make big difference. cite sources? can't find anything definitive known 2 months. Russian government says trials they've run show really great vaccine; best vaccine.

I take whole lot salt, even so, really good design. use killed adenovirus vector like AstraZeneca J&amp;J, use two different adenoviruses first second shots prevent vector immunity problem. So, totally believe good vaccine. option mRNA J&amp;J, definitely get it. There’s also places practically never mask mandates indoors anywhere US past 3 months so: restaurants. Anyone claims keeping mask you’re seated helps doesn’t understand transmission works.  struck lightning basement. care likely high risk therefore likely deal negative aspects. continue spread without care world.

That said, relatively low infection rate growing inoculated population likely starve virus thus allowing remain ignorant dies can't gain foothold anymore. Sooo... big FU kids 12?  fact think working home synonymous uncompetitive playing animal crossing enough know detached times. I've teams marketing agencies worked 90 hour weeks pump work client keeping company afloat. I'd say satisfies high stress competitive. I've top performer previous positions plan one new role, company headhunted based previous work, evidence suggest work home make less competitive. industry in? Track coach? heard someone sound tired winning since last administration. Excellent! Please keep up, France, I’m scheduled visit December! No, surge 26 states dropped mask mandates. support poor closing legitimate business forcing people work creating even people need help stupidest idea I've ever heard. Covid defined deaths. honor system work US. many people abide this. seen 2020 many willing sacrifice people beliefs. Probably certain counties, casinos coast don’t want people getting table smoke break. That’s actually case state. always jump ""new normal"" line....it's meaningless cliche. They'll while, they'll stop unless needed again. vaccine 100% efficacy. what’s stat then? Target stands empty days change minds. true. results held Israel, studies Healthcare workers height virus US, UK. last 2 included current variants. real world studies good. explanation February, every study gets released real world numbers holds up.

The variants problem MRNA vaccines, new theory likely never be.

If anything, odds testing positive go virus numbers go down. there's kind movement bots desperate go back office work. Really weird.  laughably incoherent comment

Take break dude, you’re embarrassing weeks option go somewhere mask mandate. Let guess - ""pro life"" people, right? required state unless state legislature passes law requiring it. Secret day: punishment ignoring ""mandate"" issued governor. really required. Lol. Untrue. nurses union calling CDC reverse guidelines. site endless top medical professionals also onboard. Costa Rican here, worst part even though built Healthcare infrastructure 80 years, we're still getting outpaced vaccination rates neighbors like electric Salvador built vaccination centers last year also considerably less rich also still access issues. lot extremely rural people make all-day event “going town,” live middle nowhere, vaccine access isn’t are. detailed map show much higher uptake cities rural areas. probably need take mobile clinics get small town doctors’ offices want get it.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Interesting No, worried unvaccinated spread it. “In life either kings pawns, emperors fools.” 
– Napoleon Bonaparte  Hundreds epidemiologists disagree rash new guidance CDC. guess missed that. follow science? considered assess predominant opinion subreddit given time notice it’s shifted? Schools keep vaccine records. Less likely Yankee player lying it.

Why worse teen lies it? obsessed locking even vaccinated children they're group show vaccine proof schools? Adults going tribal casinos, beaches Florida, protests whole pandemic. kid sense inclination get vaccinated protect others, likely need it, still want careful adult would accept. 

You want teens vaccinated, masked we're going end pandemic. Making mask vaccinated one else going help that. watch people brain throws error tell appointed Ronald Reagan. science mrna actually simple. 99.9% medical community concerns mrna vaccines creating long term problems. teach immune system handle certain viruses. amazing breakthrough take time research it. see people bring 10 kids walmart. follow science?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s functioning enough needs be, complaint poor people supported government. Big surprise, biggest thing people helping poor   Well kids can’t get vaccinated course So... words legally binding. ignore mandate rather shed tear it.  top firms lose talent bring back. 

lmao no

The competitive people care go office not, they're sitting home playing Animal Crossing. never told high stress team job was. Cause sounds like really know competitive people *willing* do, say nothing extroverts *want* do, say nothing people *want* live. Imagine extrovert likes living city center wants fucking win cost, regardless situation.

Now imagine you.

Which one think gonna get higher offer? I'm saying is, kind person shop Walmart due walmart dropping masks already shopping there.   It’s weird, you’re acting like would impossible CDC communicate states major retailers “hey, we’re gonna update guidelines 2 weeks. Here’s advice update yours”. that, appears didn’t even consider implications announcement would state retail mask requirements. 

From I’ve read, Walensky didn’t even make decision Wednesday Biden administration wasn’t notified Wednesday night. sloppy. pandemic. Everyone gets voluntarily (excepting kids, statistically hurt). 

&amp;#x200B;

People get flu. People get pneumonia. called endemic, french ""we ignore miniscule"". Lol what? Society fully functioning that's whole point. Good luck trying make entire culture humanity revolve around wishes. basing incredibly tight labor market skilled jobs highest demand work home ever? top firms lose talent bring back. best bonds country second rate talent. Well, bad news then, probably already 3 months circulating USA knew (dec 19- feb 20).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As sciency person, would think disregard study based self-reporting (kids lie, kids hypochondriacs) sample size 120. think you’re vaccinated, responsible medical expenses.  would assume can't really speak vaccine prevents getting seriously ill dying. Transmission still possible, that’s people still getting sick, although mildly. young handled well, Yes, individuals died overall children handed better others. think 70% possibly. first disease susceptible didn’t take precautions before?  Reasonably restricted like places open banned, yes. saves human lives cost slight inconvenience makes sense Tell don’t go gym without telling don’t go gym. people take way far. friend mine gathering 3 couples vaccinated one cancelled day five second vaccination. Like wtf might confusing total population vs adult population. Vermont currently 64.1% total population least one shot, 72.6% population age 12+, 77.0% aged 18+, 97.2% aged 65+.

Source: think like 10 million people U.S, majority people dont want erase immunocompromised people anyone can't medically get conversation necessarily, since variant based main virus, vaccine offers protection that, may get “stay home” sick “ I’m dying hospital” sick. Hell no. People cannot trusted, proven thousand fold pandemic.  things restricted perpetuity? Like need ""prove"" bars exist? funerals happen person? What's metric? terrible words like ""everyone"" ""people"" redefined among society lately include children. ""Everyone"" get vaccinated"""" used reason whatever [insert desired activity behavior], children longer worthy enough included definition word. Well.. there's 0% chance catching covid walking alone. Ergo... funny see people overly cautious like that. 

It's ok find funny. Maybe different sense humor. dont make rules. got J&amp;J might less effective. maybe got vaccine place cold chain went bad.

Every country results studies mrna far, even effective teens adults. according worldometer, taiwan conducted 571k test far since pandemics... 

just example, HK conduct compulsory testing domestic worker 370k people week ago second round.

arrival HK 6 tests. affected would make sense, diseases like decisions others affects people risk even decide safer can’t fully remove society. people upset go little less wear mask they’re ok putting people’s lives risk go back way things  Well came back Walgreens entered without mask one cashiers told need mask. told impression Walgreens allows vaccinated people enter without mask said policy still wear mask. Ultimately gave mask shopping 1. companies need tell employees policies 2. people need take chill pill. choice near future vaccinate child. many? Relying honor system people honor seems… little risky. big FU kids 12? 

“Children 0.00%-0.21% COVID-19 deaths, 9 states reported zero child deaths
​In states reporting, 0.00%-0.03% child COVID-19 cases resulted death Children 0.00%-0.21% COVID-19 deaths, 9 states reported zero child deaths
​In states reporting, 0.00%-0.03% child COVID-19 cases resulted Middlebury? That’s “to certain degree” meant. Like entirely shut down, restricted. didn’t put reason. ones used places like gyms they’ve allowed open certain degrees provided wipe machines limited capacity used places. Young adults major spreader disease diseases general fully reopening bars go back disease breeders doesn’t make sense like, ""How think things stayed running away?""

""I never really thought it. Anyway, work home, maybe upload minds cloud?"" school 16 kids Look personally lock youself inside never take chance ever risk whatsoever. rest world won't. Including elevated risk, like me. ye pretty weird barely see anything india sub considering biggest corona hotspot world rn

on every thread barely replies Flight tracker shows flights India going host countries ramping vaccinations. went Wal-Mart today likely could've gone Dollar General precisely thought ""I know Wal-Mart pulled mask rule I'm sure Dollar General going make wear it""

So 100% see people choosing shop based like instrumental convergence. we're worried fully vaccinated people following/ following rules. People worried risk posed unvaccinated people following rules wearing masks. that's biggest worry people unvaccinated choice CDC got act right pandemic. There's reason doubt science. enforcing even states yet change it. One friends went mask less IL one said thing her. free keep wearing still scared don’t force others  didn’t get place. State's sub thread governor dropping mask mandate made comment let anti-vaxxers die off, nobody shed tear got upvoted lot.

Then, person made comment said ""but get immunocompromised sick"", responded immunocompromised risk without pandemic. 

Wow hate vitriol insane. person made comment along lines believe people care people can't get vaccine. complete bullshit one (immunocompromised including cancer patients, lupus, every disorder get vaccine, recommended per CDC FDA), plus someone immunocompromised couldn't, going walking around WalMart. They'll likely sick level they're hospital, home care.

Meanwhile, state hit 70% least one dose mid week latest threshold. governor literally moved date 4 days, they're acting like makes difference. You’re right, let’s keep charade going another 2 years know, care, live fear. Yes trust nurses union institution stacked top infectious disease specialists epidemiologists who’s literal existence based around containing infectious diseases 

Jeez people sub sometimes... Ah no. 40000 infected 700 1000 deaths per day seasonal flu levels. Current barista Seattle here

Unfortunately become (polite) mask police year. Didn’t think going part job past never like this. Increased caution means washing hands often maybe avoiding crowded social events obviously sick people. like fuck catch get groceries. least federal policy could nuanced still mandate essentials require mask nooooo that's much effort guess. Back full lockdown  vaccine also never available certain immunocompromised people. dodging point.

We live far ideal circumstances bunch people create narratives justify less ideal moral stances, convenient.

We within power change that, arguing even try feels impractical.

I'm that. think better. can't, be. unattended take roughly number days get 1 180 180 180^2 (32,400). Got second dose today feel like SHIT. 102.9°F fever right now. CDC TOP EPIDEMIOLOGISTS. Highly qualified veteran ones that.

What hell going sub? CDC doesn’t take advice epidemiologists, they’re ones formulate advice first place!

All read NYT article run it. disappointed sub. Yeah, problem it’s exactly easy count previously infected unvaccinated add 70%. Say infected March 2020, really going antibodies still? August? next year? every day new people whose antibody protection fading 0. vaccinated individuals it’s much easier assume they’ll get booster available since already got vaccine first time around, can’t really assume unvaccinated previously infected individuals. Probably best approach assume potential sources future transmission. automobiles? covid far people could tell, opposite true here. think also missed CDC compromised highly respected veteran epidemiologists right? That’s they’re Center *disease control*. They’re entire existence based around handling situations like this. Extremely admirable. really think countries COVID-19 cases check can. That's true, that's China's decision. China sovereign Nepal. Install federal passport program tracking vaccinations nationwide, refuse become public health threat face house arrest heavy fines get vaccinated, violate move tougher means. lose sh\*t, past pandemics tough measures taken including forcefully quarantining people. eradication Smallpox similar steps taken process vaccinate entire planet. measures like happened past before. stores actually asking verify vaccination status? BS. education system excellent, high graduation rate high school, high proportion kids go college graduate higher degrees.Many people work land service industry. two industries VT has. young people love state much jobs suck. Many leave get great jobs elsewhere migrate back 30s 40s miss state much. Vermont full educated intelligent, well read,well traveled people beginning pandemic understood value masking, social distancing vaccination. ??? They’re free riders US pursuing mass vaccination. quite sure get you’re coming from. work close/personal national retail store. I'm still required ask customers mask 100% time.

My 2nd shot 2mos ago. care mask not..I'm good. get paid (nicely) job &amp; part it. 

PLEASE extra nice retail workers right now. fun. Seriously...it *sucks* UK altering reopening schedule today.

There evidence B.1.617 evaded vaccine induced immunity meaningful way exactly happened. AZ vaccines prohibited shipped EU put embargo vaccines leaving EU. Regardless vaccines paid way airport time shipment diverted use Italy. ability produce AZ vaccine longer need batch put us behind. US program well underway allowed doses sent overseas Ironically virus causes infertility men. Yep states opening up. pandemic going fully July. Yes, kids get vast vast majority cases mild asymptomatic. letter academic report. limited data, consider small studies; can't disregard evidence available N small. ""people lie"" known limitation survey-based studies, methodological standpoint, many feasible alternatives assessing long-term symptoms. Even clinical trials, self-reporting standard many symptoms.

Personally, think ~50% likely overestimate, include considerable proportion asymptomatic kids- point tiny percentage, risk parents (understandably) would prefer avoid. Mask mandate might going away Memorial Day depending emergency powers questions ballot Tuesday.

I read PA hadn’t voted “no” ballot question since like 90s, I’m guessing it’s likely passes state legislature rescinds mandate immediately. flu shot swing ever year guess mutations time mutations taking hold late mass produce vaccinate. CDC even acknowledge tje obvious aerosol spread like week ago. Again, low none. using flu point comparison analogous. vaccinate Covid incredibly effective. cannot vaccinate incredibly effective way flu.

If COULD vaccinate flu way would absolutely stop death children, least many is, say, 95% FEWER would die without (or thereabouts), would absolutely want us mask could vaccinate hypothetical vaccine.

But can't. flu different.

People WANT like flu, accept risk flu, accept risk Covid like accept flu risk, take mask off. they're same, matter much people WANT be. let emotions cloud judgment convenience this.

I agree must balance. point vaccines everyone. choice convenience putting cloth face dead kid. kid shot get shot.

I get saying. ""But dead kids! ton!"" SOUNDS really reasonable frame like ""We admit defeat point!"" Except don't. literally don't. ARE. easy. great narrative get us feeling back normal. want part normal shrug kids could saved easier.

That shit wash me. dead kids prevent, method LITERALLY HARM, dead kids save.

And see side this. Like ""Should outlaw CARS? CARS kill kids entirely preventable ways!""

But overlooks children killed cars entirely preventable ways, consequences. kid killed drunk driver, arrest them. kid killed parent's negligent driving, jail them. tire blows kid killed ensuing accident one else's fault, accept sad move along.

A kid killed antivaxxer Covid making law arrest dissuade someone driving drunk, drunk driver WANTS thinks freedom to. kid dying vaccinated statistical anomaly blown tire. CDC science well researched experts universities states seem skeptical saying it’s early? Maybe lack data back guidance? Idc say, want see data proves cases go current vaccination levels cases spike masks required. That’s thing I’m interested in. They're also basing new data said so. Also, seeing Israel went 8-10K day 20!!! yesterday, 56% population vaccinated (60% 1 dose) restrictions whittled away. 

That drop happened right around 50% one dose hit mid-March. Initially percentage breakthrough infections, none. AZ saving many many thousands lives around world. Literally, look much rate death dropped many European countries alone.

50% drop due AZ. accounts hundreds thousands lifes saved. EU held hostage second batch vaccines route Australia rely in-house produced vaccine needed go TGA accreditation. virus really affecting country roll-out started much later affected countries vaccine likely never available infants 6 months. then? 


I agree vaccine proof would ideal, live far ideal circumstances. may possible state level, federally likely pipe dream.  yall foul lol support you! kids. Wrong, Netherlands isnt even sending AZ News outlets still report many use day. think friends knew information. 

I one almost kick house suggesting it. Everything polarized attempt really engage, understand discuss sides. Belittling, shaming ass pretty bad tactic winning someone disagrees you. wins votes right circle. Yeah seeing sub go full HECK I'M DONE kinda sucks.

My state full morons thing bunch morons = bunch opportunity variants take hold. family happens them. Big picture, makes uneasy hell. notion wealtier nations 'passing AZ' based zero evidence. Netherlands isnt even sending AZ

Secondly AZ saves lives, regardless rare side effects. country deaths dropped 100 per day less 20 per day. Half change due AZ, rest mostly Pfizer.

We've zero deaths due AZ.
So thats thousands lives saved thanks AZ.

The statistics even impressive UK.

Bottom line: AZ great vaccin, safe many many lives! UK 7% people vaccinated opened 40s. Social distancing measures relaxing month, still word masks. Israel Gibraltar indoor mask mandates despite 85% adult population vaccinated still hesitancy remove it. Unless vaccination rates pick lot steam again, Canada EU going people done also relaxing mask rules much US now. Hey....

The thing I'm getting vaccine

I know..... UGH know..... I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But thing I'm gonna get (the vaccine!!)

HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAH zero policy?? still getting 40000 cases day 700 thousand deaths day! Major rush even half Americans vaccinated yet. waited 16 months. could waited another 40 days. Wasn’t July 4th benchmark. think Biden wants show things sooner promises look good  every company field remote, means product remain competitive company remote. mean specific risk allowing people go general public businesses maskless without vaccine verification sort, me, personally, that's vaccine available (and include kids, though people want admit that), plus reasonable period time allow children vaccinated. What's reasonable? Depends availability.

But also problem simply skirt, easily, people present proof vaccination kind enter business make law. We're that, either bite bullet letting kids die stuff cloth face, convenience sake, wear mask wait bit. US pretty far ahead vaccinations thought? least people one shot? fact think enough people focusing on. Covid starts ripping unvaccinated, we'll reach herd immunity know it. perpetual thing. We're closing 50% vaccinated. 2/5ths rest already Covid getting would lead herd immunity. Even public library doesn’t stinking use honor system. i’ve never seen question asked reddit  Dude, base opinion zero evidence.

Romania whatever wants, great Moldova getting vaccins safely used vaccinating elderly. Also please note Pfizer Moderna expensive, wereas AZ J&amp;J cheap.

AZ used developing countries mRNA vaccines expensive. J&amp;J vaccine likely real workhorse vaccinating world. 

As Netherlands unlikely send AZ. Last time send vaccines abroad Curaçao send mostly Pfizer Moderna. wearing mask equitable though? Wearing mask dosent stop going concerts,movies,games,etc. dosent stop living life simple thing protect others. understand cdc went advice top epidemiologists. CDC fubar. Good point, probably becomes blurry enforcement. instance, unvaccinated people asked wear masks decline park asks leave. case, they’re technically refusing continue serving guest guest isn’t following rules - rule determines whether they’ll serve without mask hinges vaccination status. I’m guessing state could least try go Disney that. might lose, doubt Disney wants pay litigate (and also take risk losing, think heard businesses get fined $5000 per violation, Disney serves loooooots people every single day adds lot money days worth enforcing policy like state takes issue it). mean, yeah, sure, get infected, contagious, asymptomatic, fully vaccinated also hook Victoria's Secret model. happen, chances slim. Yes, point. point get. highly vaccinated countries, much US, also dropped indoor masks? also measures place like mass rapid testing vaccine passports. US basically nothing now. Seriously people trying find excuse mask mandates lockdowns must continue mean, maybe places. here? people never intended vaccinated ones never wore masks unless absolutely get it. Lifting masks get vaccinated means nothing people never cared either.  they’re winding down, they’ll need start reversing process. Pfizer got approved kids 12+ days ago. Parents already booking appointments children. would comfortable 60% adults least one dose? blame state local civic eadership. Every county fairgrounds, Walmart, high school football field, churches...there places prominent local citizen leaders help. National guard available distribute. chose to. No. You’re wrong. 1 year old cannot get vaccine. won’t eligible another 11 years. Many many people able get vaccinated despite willingness to. refuse mask get vaccinated still putting people risk. Before, knew ok public could see people wearing masks keep distance weren’t. can’t take daughter literally anywhere anymore. don’t tell dOeSn’T aFFecT chILDrEn absolutely does. side effects hit like train though. severe headache, vomiting entire day. subsided next day. would take again. Surprising India included, numbers worrying say least. hear police survey rivers stop body dumping know real picture far worse it’s reported :( certain point US. Low income high income American women children middle class. Lol. don’t base opinion upvotes Reddit. base experience today seeing good 50 50 split wearing masks vs not. Less half US population vaccinated millions yet eligible. Epidemiologists supportive CDC's decision making sound. kids can’t got back TJ's mask obedient city, everyone still wearing one. think lot nobody wants first/only one, slowly becomes common, people start going without. Happen link this? Would love read graph this: mortality rate like super low people age? big deal? Yeah, can't imagine making good product line work timely manner without knowing coworkers well, vibe them. Sure, could it. would take much longer. And, course, less fun. That's part I'm mad this. got first shot Pfizer vaccine soon available me. wait 21 days minimum 2nd shot. least two weeks fully protected. go deal unvaccinated, unmasked people grocery store food. close way fully protected edict came down. vaccinated? Oh well, life live, put hold long enough high risk friends family members, since shot can't give them! Phew! know bonds fade, right? I'm sure fine accounting comp sci. really things, though.

Also continue work home forever, shut-ins thread want, eventually *wouldn't* know coworkers. mean it’s pretty clear votes majority agreeing maintains lockdowns lol Right. modified adenovirus present coronavirus ""spike"" protein. wear mask. Maybe we’re different huh? No. I’m saying always going day announced day prior that, previous rules effect. always going “overnight” appearance always going change one set rules one day another set rules next. 

It’s like saying “my job decided fire overnight!” No, probably didn’t. always going day knew day told. can't spread COVID shot. Israeli govt. proved this, pretend still reason. Good, hope people willingly get vaccine die it. cares That’s currently expected fall, around September. 
 
If think waiting table restaurant five minutes interminable, yes, it’s long long time away. 
 
For non-fruit-flies, it’s 4-6 months. CDC say everyone doesn’t mask anymore. vaccinated people even says still large crowds. think rely people honest think others last year haven’t living real world. It’s pretty abundant people can’t trusted live honor system. look hoarders TP gasoline. Lmao comment quoting death stats children also perfect example. never going reach 85% vaccinated. never open up? don’t think way things going right, needs sort verification system. proposing realistic though. Getting vaccinated helps it’s done. scientifically true wearing mask socially distancing incredibly effective there’s reason shouldn’t continue things also vaccinated. gains get opening risk lives people, doesn’t make sense Sorry, majority society disagree medical professionals. Suriname living New York :D sis nurse currently. one currently allowed go outside weekends Whats punishment dont? did. also know can't keep fucking vaccinated  impression never met coworkers switching WFH? bonds existed beforehand. even didn't, data show performance suffer all. would thought? Unfortunately, true. 

It *is* true mortality low among children, accurate say ""kids die."" 

Death issue, though. kids dealing lot anxiety around contacting covid they're concerned life, they're terrified they'll kill grandma immunocompromised sibling whatever. 

And, um, please drag ""But kids spread covid!"" chestnut. primarily true elementary school kids. articles I've seen indicate middle school up, kids spread covid adult level. 

Somebody, either thread another one, said (paraphrase) ""Well, people worried kids, keep home another month half vaccines kick in. adults wear masks another month half bunch kids?"" I'm like...well, yeah, people really fucking worst. 

I just...I can't even. 

We started lockdown pulling kids school protect elderly, general attitude seems ""Eh, fuck kids."" get it. It’s easy say aren’t one risk though. returning things put people risk? Society still fully functioning there’s reason allow people walk around without masks open things back lives stake 2018-2019 flu season, children died flu died COVID, percentage children vaccinated flu.

There’s single child 12 vaccinated COVID (other statistically insignificant number might participating trials), COVID still lower death rate flu. think CDC would claim masks vaccinated people potential benefit. would say risk low enough society large wear them, guidance. Apparently think spread sickness caused guidance negligible, think bullshit. political organization. maybe optics them. 
Idk still keep acting like everyone vaccinated. I'm done arguing though. hope reflect argument, made good faith. remember redditors pretty young, among group they're introverted idea good night sitting around playing video games.

Group projects- every large scale project group, they're like 24 they're gonna charge something large scale anyway know- require people good interpersonal connections. Or, least, ideal do.

And get texting talking zoom, get little things happen office every day. Jokes, small talk, etc, end resulting people knowing better, end understanding other's work styles better, result better, efficient products. competitive companies, makes company people successful.

But talking people think hour zoom convo good enough. get it. Pardon me? No, it’s don’t think I’ve ever seen large number written like Maybe among 80+ year olds Granted, layperson, thus expert, understanding wearing mask COVID-19, was/is lowering potential exhalation contagious individual much protecting wearer. 


This part gets me. keep hearing ""wear mask want/if concerned"" retort criticism guidance, despite protecting people around wearer, wearer themselves. feel like missed memo, here. also huge number people natural immunity. doesn't

It relies vaccine effective available everyone. idea need trust people nonsense. need get vaccinated, morons longer matters. right someone vaccinated longer care honestly point. Agreed, there’s point say “Well, we’re safe variants, time open up!” It’s virus deadline mutate vaccine resistant variant. variant could emerge anywhere, time. long wait around mythical vaccine evading variant emerge? month? 6 months? year? would look pretty silly we’re still masking social distancing year variant still hasn’t emerged.

The question everyone who’s lifting restrictions mandates due variants is: now, when? think we’re safe variants. “When COVID completely eradicated” wrong answer. Would great stores checked see people vaccinated - don’t, it’s pretty much masks anyone now.  That's probably saddest part last year me.. country larger portion expected group friends ended assholes. took pandemic see true colors few. thinking can’t vaccinated

We need move beyond anti-science rhetoric. Vaccinated people certainly care groups mentioned, they've gotten vaccinated. Trust epidemiologists. Yes, politicians already gearing re-election campaigns. know people go first 100 days office new president? that's real time got get anything done elections worry donors appease. Yes. Efficacy trials, effectiveness real world use. sucks that’s life. people need take extra precautions like can’t get FLU vaccine risk. ccare random strangers internet think me. Shaming doesnt work people care opinion shamer. Lol

Well know mRNA immunity lasts 6 months likely much longer. guess two people know we’re trial participants 

You lead horse water, can’t make drink Lol what? One third Americans fully vaccinated. even hit 50% Americans one dose yet.  .04% chance? .04% chance ever testing positive lifetime? compare % chance testing positive getting vaccinated?

I'm doubting effectiveness vaccines, statistics like need context thrown around. Comments like Reddit garbage finally know lots people pointed out, don’t understand CDC apparently overlooked aspect. far know never mentioned inevitability offered solution explained reasoning related it. visited Walmart, Kroger’s, Home Depot, Old Navy, Planet Fitness today without mask. Loved it. seemed like even split wearing masks without. Nothing wrong all. Freedom choice ricks. unvaccinated people take advantage guidance. Data shown vaccine provides protection COVID severe effects. think younger people would weaker immune response? think there’s gonna boosters? You’re strong insults, rather weak substance. Perhaps you’re masking COVID. Good luck that. personally know two people vaccinated testing positive COVID.

""It currently unknown long immunity lasts"" Well, no. obvious reasons.  Always nice auto mod agreeing :-) western industrialized nations higher income persons often fewer children...   Right it’s children can’t vaccinated shouldn’t re-opening now. It’s incredibly dangerous seems irresponsible pushing really seems little downside keeping things way Say hello era endemic SARS-CoV-2 Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think fertility fears 100% unfounded, think one fact become distorted used support data VAERS (IIRC- vaccine adverse event reporting registry), report things happen taking vaccine. It’s specific kind collection method bc information doesn’t get confirmed submitted anonymously. 

The VAERS COVID shots show ~90 miscarriages last time saw cited.

This couple hundred million shots even attempt correlate it. means literally- 92 women COVID vaccine point miscarriage. 200 million shots shouldn’t surprise anyone.


So that’s one avenue seen misinformation perpetuated. true statistic used, without context, basis drawing causal relationship shown. people unvaccinated schools, ie 12 believe; yeah... Good call. I'm pretty confused think form close bonds necessary create great projects fucking google meet lol So? shot cares next guy his. cant give scary. I’m worried people thinking can’t vaccinated legitimate reasons children aren’t. There’s reason trying “return normal” things still dangerous people largely safer new ways things Employees don’t want wear masks, either. Vaccine passports used create supposedly safe zone. Presumably, people would engage risky behaviors safe zone assume safe.

If really safe zone, third vaccine certificates fake, leads sickness death would otherwise occurred.  US difference counties mandates without like 1.5%. work it’s margin Evidence first study long covid children suggests half children aged 6 16 years old contract virus least one symptom lasting 120 days, 42.6 per cent impaired symptoms daily activities. interim results based periodic assessments 129 children Italy diagnosed covid-19 March November 2020 Gemelli University Hospital Rome (medRxiv, doi.org/fv9t).

However, becoming increasingly apparent large number children symptomatic asymptomatic covid-19 experiencing long-term effects, many months initial ...duh. Children spread viruses. parents know things. slowing 12-16 approved absolute number still huge. 2 million+ people per day much anyone planning on. 

We want hesitant areas get vax'ed cluster. opposite places like Bay Area Dane County, WI NY suburbs Connecticut. like they're going become immune epidemic, rural areas poor uptake remain susceptible full hammer. flat average, big problem.

Unfortunately town 70% adults think BS get vaccinated work three businesses go three churches, go nuts. COVID care *at all* 20-30% population longer susceptible. magical card give youre jabbed name, date, lot information. card, mask, sale. think cdc’s original guidelines 2 weeks ago really odd. like 2 situations vaxed people could maskless outside (which overly restrictive dumb).

My theory 3-4 weeks ago everyone 16 became eligible saw much less first shot numbers last week half. education fail bad? math. Unless start talking specific numbers assume masks offer statistically significant boost lowered rates transmission.

We know vaccine likely around 80-95% effective. 

In lower end range boost 5% would warrant mask wearing indoors least. increase prevalence covid society. cause sickness death, business failure, unemployment. Polio also mainly spreads fecal-oral transmission route, much less contagious easier contain respiratory virus. Also, definitely concerned mutations viruses, however middle pandemic Covid lot worrisome. Listen you, talking tough. never vaccine passport. Indiana, applied vax minute emergency alert came phone telling age group (30+) allowed. got first shot last week. early take masks. States place. told in-laws (who shockingly took virus little seriously expected to) could go vacation together (as tradition) got vaccines, would protected (immune disorder/immunocompromised). got first shots past week.  


I held hostage worked. I'm saying necessarily that, know.... works works lol Use brain. Non-vaccinated people going get infected result policy. means incidence covid society become higher. means people get sick die, businesses go under, people lose jobs.

This affects whether vaccinated not. Actually is, that’s kind point 

Masks prevent transmission (less effective vaccines quite bit actually!) 

Vaccines prevent transmission significantly masks 

So, simple math

Being vaccinated = masks redundant individual 

Simple enough you?

You also fail realize individuals hospitalized *all* advanced age co-morbid conditions there’s evidence transmission occurred vaccinated individuals hospitalized people. 

You’re logic mind boggling. Again, stop spewing nonsense safe. blood clots occurring extremely rare. 

The reason Canada stopped using PERCEPTION AZ safe could caused vaccine hesitancy, May enough vaccines ramp vaccinations anyway.

Even AZ safe, there's enough idiots believe it'll kill pulling rotation increase vaccine uptake. understand COUNTRY choosing use individuals feel reservations.

The problem Canada idiots also ""vaccine shopping"" people higher age ranges choosing take AZ appts instead try get others... open age ranges wider get people come use AZ supply.

The reason stop using supply. There's supply issues want stop giving AZ alleviate problems get larger supply later.

The US chose use AZ tbh probably smart decision - safety reasons vaccine uptake bad. Reddit :D There's virtually department stores left US It’s honor system. you’re vaxxed need go in, invest n100 masks. Interesting see people continue wear foreseeable. think will. also see people's obese asses hanging Walmart. see someone something mean good idea. Thank always updating daily numbers/percentages, it’s comforting helpful family. God bless :) Can’t go wearing masks forever. curves flattened good vaccines available. don’t want vaccine roll dice risk. rest us part whole time got vaccines want move forward go back normal life. Netherlands Depends state details custody agreement. far yesterday 8 months. long since first guy got jabbed think well Clearly want personal responsibility occur unvaccinated.  people supposed do? We’re talking entire swath people conditioned oppose literally anything person suggesting (D) next name. way possible reach people convince get vaccinated? chance someone spread COVID they're fully vaccinated near zero. Stop fearmongering, statistically possible. Netherlands needs vaccines. People 60 given AZ currently, Pfizer, Moderna Jansen given 60.
The shortage vaccines yet, end month start change.

So right Netherlands needs AZ much vaccin.

Actually logical vaccin send would one dose Jansen (J&amp;J), also still short supply well. counter bill gates says, facilities indeed shuttered producing 100s millions vaccines patent law- namely, Bangladesh 🇧🇩

Profit kill us all. indonesian real world results excellent hope Thailand sees effect. know mass vaccination occurred. Lets revisit topic six weeks. country makes vaccine still havent got one... won’t. realize going unvaccinated people stores without masks going forward. wasn’t already vaccinated needed go in, would invest box n100 masks. Obviously ideal, 50-60% efficacy par standard vaccines. Really highlights good mRNA ones.

Edit: take back - that’s flu shots. vaccines incredibly efficacious like mumps polio. Hey guess live one. sucks. can’t shit without potentially harming thanks selfish dickheads everywhere. stuck home year now. need go hardware store auto parts store grocery store, nobody fucking wearing mask. 

So that’s cool. fuck everyone who’s immunocompromised. Pussies. healthied harder like patriots. 

Jfc.  Hundreds kids dead. hundreds thousands like adults draw line wearing mask much inconvenience save hundreds kids? vaccinated. think it’s trolls vote following cdc guidance knows. 50-60% effective. Tops. absolutely correct lot replies completely missing point. grandma babysits kid next week? teacher? friends parents? right, kids die it, fine. glad worry them. whole fam bam quarantine 2 weeks praying they'll fine covid child death ALMOST non-existent. kids young 12 get it. 13 yr old got yesterday. many dummies using new guidance declare pandemic over. We’re yet. 

VACCINATED people choose wear masks indoors. Unvaccinated adults/kids still need required wear masks indoors. 

How they’re going enforce that? idea seems like govt/business leaders need fill gap still require masks everyone now, becomes okay unvaccinated wear masks. Exactly. It’s employees wearing masks make feel safe l. wait staff it’s way felt “safe” ready get rid mine NJ Murphy knows better cdc sooooo still 2 kidneys? donating marrow? forced adopt rather kids?

""Doing what's best society"" *really* big worms.   sub high percentage people fight move towards normal tooth nail.

They'd happy kept acting like pandemic long actual threat gone mass vaccination Excellent explanation! Thanks! That’s really human behavior Understandable, Wikipedia get number? NYT tracker says 47 percent one shot. Fuck, no. Yea. hard smartest lone student. Mississippi banned statewide mean cities haven't. Personally, seen Mississippi restaurant smoking side probably decade (though yes younger). 

There vegans Mississippi. liberals Mississippi. 

Can please stop grouping every citizen state together using butts jokes saying they're worth helping wouldn’t go far call shithole. Florida Texas pretty good places live. North Carolina Georgia rise. little bit late India bit large Netherlands provide vaccines for... Yep, totally agree. another thread someone suggested might spur people get vaccine, IMO endangers people exactly reasons saying. chance yes. Yes 3k+ people work fully vaccinated continue get regular tests one tested positive since. personally tested 4 times since fully vaccinated never tested positive. risk factors expose others potentially carrying virus absolutely everything said done, average risk factor positivity rate protection provided vaccine (in cases equates ~0.05%) ""The two COVID-19 vaccines approved European Medicines Agency (EMA) St Maarten BioNTech/Pfzier vaccine Moderna vaccine; issued free charge registered St Maarten  source CDC. Yeah, I'm Gen-X pretty much unamused foolishness. see plenty people older generations too. True, Maybe based citing percentages lower 80% first dose, 92% second seems consistent I've heard. 46% first dose less 80% cited, I'm little unsure saying vaccines less effective studies stated. live cow country huh AZ perfectly fine prevents severe illness death. Let’s try spin negatively. Yes, Brazil actually France's longest border one country Ok huge fail part. skimmed article read walmart got confused walgreens. Sorry right. terrifying normalized obesity is. Thanks lizzo people even celebrate Maybe meant would difficult get bed hospitals overwhelmed, hospital would rather give bed someone younger better health, idk No, can't ask Sue CDC bad guidance? Sue company following CDC guidance? 

So many people suddenly understand others failed trust CDC. Yes. Vaccinated people still get covid. Yankees 8 players test positive PRC never allow true unimpeded independent access Wuhan lab. case, allowing independent investigators access one year, anyone doubt they’ve scrubbed clean now?

And turns outbreak occur lab? would world prepared do? Would nations even want knowledge public domain? There's LOT social media hand slapping fully vaccinated people choosing longer wear masks required. people handslapping believe vaccines effective enough. believe unless near total vaccine compliance, vaccines really work. even fully vaccinated, unsafe around people may also fully vaccinated. Also believe fully vaccinated people wearing masks longer required endangering health lives young children immunocompromised (who ineligible vaccination may fully benefit vaccines) fully vaccinated could still catch Covid spread it. fully vaccinated people wearing masks businesses longer require ""disrespecting"" employees choice there. fully vaccinated people choose wear masks required selfish different anti-maskers. Many say ""mask long takes"" show care people. really getting weird. Wear mask rest life makes feel safe something good people. hand slap shame people following health officials. makes look histrionic irrational. completely destroys credibility. Nobody going expected verify status. someone's vaccinated they're safe. they're not, fuck 'em. industry work in, going back office pretty roundly seen improving work life balance, longer boss’s beck call hours. competing companies also stay home. cream rises top. You...won't.

Not according people thread saying vast majority office workers back while. I'm quoting pandemic performance compared pre pandemic, competitors. data says people better interpersonal relationships better means nothing you? That's interesting lol

I say nothing. paychecks written synergy. McDonald's much happier deal high turnover poor performance rather increase wages cut margins. gamer?


Used be. Can't say play often enough call one. states 50% vaccinated....

CDC wrong many times last year half too. vaccinated people unmask dilutes anti-vaxxers social issue really think CDC failed consider that? trust CDC before? anything changed CDC alter faith guidance? Basically want get anti-maskers infected reach herd immunity sooner. Pink?? read past Home Depot Walgreens also keeping masking requirements place, retailers said respective ”We decided keep current face covering policy place time being,” Walgreens spokesman Campbell O’Connor said email. “The safety team members customers top priority continue guide decision process.” Workers gotten least one dose given fuck all. CDC handled covid well... held up. studies bit better worse.

Asymptomatic covid prevented, too. USA UK, tested Healthcare workers weekly caught even Asymptomatic cases. new virus anymore.

Also, cares lifetime risk? need booster we'll get it. Even recovered SARS took one vaccines protected happened 20 years ago virus DNA different variant could spin covid 19. 

Getting covid even trying prevent. Preventing deaths hospitalizations goal. hit park.

Covid us forever. Every virus known man novel. Many killing millions first time settling endemic. True way much easier. millions dollars medical research required. move eat less. easy anyone it. actually try can. people try hard Agreed, would “don’t believe masks, COVID, vaccine” threat anyone? still spread getting vaccine According (website Yahoo article latimes)?  know customers vaccinated? damage CDC done genuinely extraordinary. genuinely think frustrating would businesses really don’t care, whatever counts ‘win’? People need boogeyman. Many using unvaccinated people fill role  free ride United States pursuing forced vaccination extending non-pharmaceutical interventions. wow true? i’m doubting claim, source? i’d love read nonsense posting absolutely reason called out. I'm sure. sounds like they're pretty safe position, like fully vaccinated probably little worry regards risks. ""Trust Science"" so? would prefer throw AZ doses trash?  really sucks immune compromised, cancer chemo patients, kids can’t get vaccinated.

How many going baseball games grocery stores? fearmongering .001% possible infections end. Stop masking vaccinated. thought straight away. Business enforce mask mandates *customers*. force *employees* get vaccinated get fired depending replaceable much affects profit margins. What’s taking long? transistor chip. fuel efficient Almost unvaccinated people enclosed space? Yes, masks. Obviously. Certainly conspiracy theorists beginning pandemic thinking either demanding nobody masks “freedom”. wearing mask fully vaccinated seems definition “following science”. Ofc, you’re risk paranoid willing take risk, could always wear mask lol Exactly.

That’s literally happened people downplaying virus got infected, passed along family member died. realised selfish idiotic been, simply wearing mask keeping distance could saved them. Yeah shit shit. idiotic.  Last year, local research said 25 local cases max confidently control.

206 way pass that, need careful, vaccination rate low, could go badly quick. shit. Ever Walmart? People bringing every random animal think always ""It's comfort animal allowed ask it."" *Republicans Way herd fall line giving free shit. nurses union calling CDC reverse guidelines.

[That's many nurses anti-vaxx Yeah, I'm gonna go scientists. county already. Feels great. Fully vaccinated. going live music next week, first time 16 months! never said shouldn’t discuss public health. Discuss away. meantime get used normal vaxxed people unmasked people lie it. actually think, employers, people get vaccine join fellow workers without mask

An employer ask employee vaccinated liability reasons. get people vaccinated. good thing. There’s big difference medical grade ppe (which designed regulated protect medical workers viruses) cloth mask buy Amazon used mainly source control. entirely, severely limit potential expose others virus, by:
1. Get vaccinated ASAP
2. Wear mask (N95) times public
3. Limit going work, supplies, basic medical attention, continuing education (if they’re still student specialising) unless done online.   misunderstood recommendation. 

I assure don't. said fine vaccinated people wear masks *most* places.

Correct. exceptions mass transit, hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons include schools.

This local schools -- family members work -- announced Friday students could stop wearing masks vaccinated.  seen efficacy rates flu shots produced last decade? 3 year old going daycare preschool since May 2020. I'm concerned seasonal flu Covid honest. might want take look article, they're still fucking It’s gonna amount ends pandemic, 70% though. 

So much population want vaccinated us take masks? 

If it’s less 70%, stance fair. it’s 70% higher, there’s point waiting. non-CDC epidemiologists arms CDC! chance asymptomatic transmission vaccinated extremely small. There’s loads evidence this

Small percentages big population adds up. can't believe 15 months still explained. Oh need significantly testing handle this. 10% positivity means many missing cases.  That's still problem vaccine 100% effective, lifting mask mandate ends spreading covid more, we're putting vaccinated people unnecessary risk ... convenience?

It's terrible idea.

Also there's still people can't get vaccine yet. know two people fit category dealing chemo treatment recently given clear get yet. either going vaccinated catch eventually.

If let run wild unvaccinated population there's going decent number breakthrough cases. People need stop treating vaccines like magic bullets treat like imperfect highly effective bulwark community spread. us able limit public interactions people vaccinated. UK [worried new fast-spreading variants would overwhelm healthcare system even infect unvaccinated people.

We've made lot progress vaccination numerically there's enough unvaccinated people cause problems, especially new variants higher threshold herd immunity. terrible place. 

Then leave People keep saying immunocompromised people can't get vaccine. know plenty have, question whether gives protection. Go risk map see high risk areas, quite bit country lot people vaccinated couple months now. Pretty sure said wear mask times no, logic would need wear one home. Oh come on, understand use Google I'm wasting time know experts saying even vaccinated next someone doesn’t mask carrying virus data show vaccine working fine.. kids age 12 can’t get vaccine yet? trust unvaccinated adults still wear masks really sucks.. taking 2 year old places behind development socially. vulnerable don’t trust anybody. everyone thinks criticising modifications law/guidelines blame ones still wearing mask judge them. choice, dont look like alien without mask either. still feel safe,,, stay safe home. Dutch much better. sitting 2 million doses, around 40 million US adjusted population. share total deliveries, Netherlands even worse US. really shame. Luckily vaccinating quite quickly well now, doses going used eventually. answer this. vaccines prime system fight virus. personal risk Covid high. one vaccine associated blood clots, risk Covid related blood clots much higher infected. evidence vaccines dangerous short long term. Get vaccinated others. part.  Reality simple: mask ""policing"" sustainable.

Our real method get policing getting number vaccinated people far higher non-vaccinated ones -- we're making good progress on. agree, risk definitely zero, you’ve got shoulder risk life no? much longer wait go back normal? It’s ok anti-science stance, one! used quotes. Try without them. Don’t expert know fellow citizens lie. Masks never foolproof. risk reduction one mask much less individuals wearing mask. Combination reductions risk much better simply one, it’s double protection unvaccinated individual Thanks I'm expert, tell high degree certainty people say whatever think need say means exercise compassion strangers. how? It’s pretty obvious anti vaxx aren’t changing mind. Getting 70% lofty goal begin with. level risk life deemed acceptable. Unfortunately, average person gets say is. Shhhh, you’re dealing someone clearly knows CDC! scientists don’t know shit! 

Wait, whose anti-science people again?
the anti-maskers psychos know better worlds top scientists? mean normalcy?

Me family 5 pretty much done everything we've done before, mask on.

The restrictions put affect life changing even talking point, people feel need talk masks take away freedumbz been. Water also wet Meanwhile, US sitting 70 million doses. public universities, public institutions: police, firefighter, schools, military, etc. Every one groups pocket people get vaccine (for varying reasons), choice emergency label removed. logic doctors nurses never take PPE. Netherlands colonial power ruled area back day, I’m guessing still ton ties maybe young Dutch people like Peace Corps style service there? Launching equator gives direct launch capability orbits ""inclined"" angle w.r.t equator 

It cost launch equatorial orbit 40 degrees costs equator launch 40 degrees inclination - launching geostationary orbits (that equatorial) lucrative market equatorial launch gives advantage. 

If want good coverage high latitudes, geostationary satellites drawbacks want orbits least addition those. Se Galileo vs GPS example. seemed like even split wearing masks without. Nothing wrong all. Freedom choice ricks.

I mean even best areas they've barely hit 50% fully vaxxed, 50/50 split makes sense according new guidelines.  think overlooked children gave parents children 12 middle finger. 

There's potential vaccine 2-11 year olds coming September. CDC could waited then, let's honor system dishonorable people. Yep! understanding 3 cohort trials running right now. 6 months 2, 2-5, Yeah, last year way faith seeing experts places like Australia New Zealand recommending CDC. SCIENTISTS figured it’s safe enough proceed removing mask recommendation despite population wear masks regardless. 

You’re acting like CDC like overwhelmed parents done shit. Good thing Reddit comment section set straight! still get virus vaccinated. take full effect it. We’re going Corona variants running around awhile bc anti-vaxxers modern day plague rats did, result see one credible website there. (and 2 pages results show suggested search)  may get hit asteroid, too. Better keep indoors. one denies Dutch did. genocide Banda Isles. commit war crimes Politionele Acties. coerce local population producing prices market Dutch inhuman circumstances. things right apologise. However, right Indonesia effectively replaced Dutch colonialism Javanese imperialism. Coercing East Timor, Papua Moluccas unitary state without proper devolution.

Finally, Indonesia get special treatment when, opposite Suriname, fought two wars Indonesia nationalised Dutch property. point ties gone. don’t know you’re getting downvoted, you’re right.

Because ""have live this"" chose nothing let COVID simmer levels kill thousands people week. There's reason significantly better so. always exaggeration people lying policies get put place. idea always gets used unemployment benefits welfare discussed “people lie get welfare game system” used justify giving benefits . 

Let’s look probability here. 

The chances public space someone lying vaccinated, wearing mask social distancing, actively contagious case covid high begin especially community spread lower now. 

Couple chance getting breakthrough infection chances child getting sick odds become even lower. 

Everyone get vaccinated lie wear mask, you’re jerk, whole “people lie” overblown argument. children sure

But immunocompromised children, children cancer, cystic fibrosis, asthma etc there’s increased risk children haven’t vaccinated submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Jesus christ, actually serious insane bullshit you? sound like full clinic trial Phase II III. complete phase III approved India? way

Next blow mind telling sky blue, grass green water wet infect large number people ineligible vaccine (children, cancer patients, suppressed immune pSystem). Um CDC said masks nothing beginning pandemic people hoard lmao leading scientists top health organizations deemed community spread dropped sufficiently low level...

The day CDC put new guidance New York Times ran story saying 4 5 experts expected would need wear masks least rest year. CDC guidance coming ""expert"" disagrees vast majority people field. don’t get sudden outrage, like...we KNEW anti-vaxx going stop masking anyone dared say masks. surprise. don’t grand moral compass everyone expects. CDC doesn’t really incentive ever tell unvaccinated it’s recommended wear mask, see ‘restrictions forever’, they’ll stop anyway, probably sooner later. It’s is. Seems like bash CDC push narrative drive actual discussion. saying “unvaccinated people go maskless risk me, even though I’m masked vaccinated:” solution? Wear masks forever?

To continue public health measures like masking, social distancing, limiting mass gatherings spread falls 10 cases per 100k per week, metric given initially indicate we'd emerged pandemic. guys really thinks CDC didn’t realize unvaccinated people won’t wear masks Reddit community pointed them? 

I’d like think average CDC employee little smarter average user here. knew people don’t wear masks won’t wear later, ok it. Nah, still get it. vaccine drastically reduced chance though, 100 percent guarantees symptoms far reduced.

Nurses doctors, I'll listen doctors. Look Brazil new variants that....  CDC makes decisions based science also political influence.

You're half right, CDC INCREDIBLY conservative face mounting evidence vaccines incredibly effective, certain activities (like outdoor masking) previously thought risky, actually not. data needed vaccine efficacy simply say vaccinated safe cases.


For us ACTUALLY reading studies vaccine efficacy show they're incredibly effective stopping serious illness asymptomatic infection, well preventing transmission get breakthrough infection, well fact they're still effective variants currently circulating, well fact teach immune system well order true escape variant virus would mutate point basically new pathogen, well real world efficacy data shows breakthrough infections make .009% vaccinated individuals, know science clear efficacy vaccines ability stop infection. many scientists taken surprise sudden change mssk policy?

They freely admit article they're completely risk averse focusing ""zero risk"" profile. want eliminate even minuscule chance risk, let's clear ever decided public policy, start now. risk vaccinated people dropped point effectively nill except limited circumstances. enough get people back normal choose to. already were, according article people may receive couple visitors instead five. useless potential spread, however Singaporeans good manners unlike US, actually care people. Yep same. Nothing lose helps others feel better it’s bonus. gloom? Sub gleaming optimism. March - December peak mayhem here-One memorable panic inducing posts turned total waste time culling minks.

Since alcohol wiping carts I've gotten sick far less. I'm relatively healthy, loathe sick.

 I'll continue masking shopping they're banned, honest. don’t trust people lol. hope right. incorrect. Given enough viral load, vaccinated people get infected die (and likely spread too). already lot breakthrough infections reported. many countless people still dealing dizziness vertigo? one talking that... wish, sadly Indonesia way big Dutch donations significant impact. Dutch enough vaccines help country size. incorrect. 95% efficient reducing infections. Given enough viral load, get infected despite vacciations get sick (this explains breakthrough infections vaccinated people die). Masks reduce viral load. really idiotic many people including CDC treating black white. CDC explain viral load etc. public trusted knowledge educate them. Yeah probably selfish. selfish wear mask it’s 80 degrees warehouse, within 15 minutes start time practically see paper masks soaked sweat. breathing hard thinner masks get sucked mouth almost choke you. fiancé works lips bad shape winter masks work.

I got vax, started wearing mask required problem wearing mask grocery store. tired people wear mask things like shopping telling people wear day Manuel labor selfish wanting mask off. 💯  Nope, that's included risk factor statement. Obviously something like fucking ebola much worse odds catching zero  seems exact counting makes sense... reliable it? looking China India... found them. crazy given Americans demographic could get vaccine already April.  fantastic thread. learned abt Suriname, abt French Guiana, rockets, satellites, orbits, Brazil France Dutch sending covid vaccines. great read. Thanks Lmao 10/10 would again. doesn’t change logic behind said though:

IF Netherlands sending AZ it’s still better sending nothing. CDC says masks necessary early on.

Then said mostly spread droplets many experts including (who molecular biologist) screaming air (aerosols).

Then, make insane decision get many people vaccinated first want strict studies did. Despite Israel UK proving 1 shot get herd immunity faster reduces transmission community leading much less death/capital.  

And even need get easily manipulated Trump administration. Minks farmed.

But idea virus got humans. Pretending ""scientists playing guano"" that's certain thing conspiracy theory. send 100 millions Indonesian adult? Look bottom line ONE day alert literally one going wear mask fucking shit. work directly hundreds tourist general public every single day, fuck opinions. Period. Availability adults still expected end June. lived US would gotten vaccine April. I'm sorry, think us dangerous disease have? vaccinated safe 

Note vaccinated dramatically reduces chance get seriously ill die COVID, eliminate it. documented cases people became sick died COVID 2 weeks past second shot. fully vaccinated, back normal. vaccine makes us essentially immune virus goal year now. achieved. 

I understand little surprise shock things back normal year legitimate trauma. probably followed jubilation end year legitimate trauma. 

If not, choose remain miserable things better able believe that, honestly know tell you. I’m referring specific country, rather herd immunity one’s country won’t solve problem entirely. need corporate globally tackle pandemic. Afaik send yet, said would. undecided. Netherlands currently behind. keep mind Netherlands far behind. seems like way behind age groups vaccinating, lot people willing get vaccine here. vaccination grade seniors much higher US (we rely poll data Netherlands, lost actual count). takes long us go age group. likely also reason deaths still quite bit lower Netherlands US.

The Netherlands behind US one month. decreasing quite quickly coming weeks, expect Netherlands ahead US terms adult population vaccinated somewhere June, due higher vaccination readiness (75 80% wants vaccine). goal US 70% adults least partially vaccinated July 4th, Dutch goal 85% adult population vaccinated time. countries questionable able meet ambitious goals, due supply problems due demand problems.

Also, Surinam former colony Netherlands, badly need help. opinion mainly Dutch responsibility take care former colonies much possible capable asked so. Consider Surinam fragile healthcare system well, cannot handle constant high level cases, Dutch healthcare system ""can"" (with consequences).

People vaccine available good PPE it’s time move on. feel immunocompromised, doesn’t mean never go back. Redneck states, bunch hillbillies never travel.

Appreciate advice. one metrics specific Europe. think Mexico, Singapore, Australia Europe? Dipshit. said *may* reached. He's talking situation happened. 


*what about?* begrijpened lezen jonge. None red neck states Yeah understand people keep talking *idea* mythical variant respond vaccines. Despite fact many variants respond vaccines. immunologists said along likely will. vaccine manufacturers said along produce boosters adjust vaccines necessary.

It's relatively new concern people flat-out created reason remain afraid.  Right say end June far. I'm saying would nice could trust figure. I'm pregnant get chance dying quite higher others group. shocking priority group high risk folks include pregnancy, asthma, problems breathing. biggest symptom shallow breathing. First world problems... Texas' numbers dropped despite reckless decision drop mask mandate early. Vaccines numbers dropped. doubt correlates age but.. \*speculation alert\*.. could also indicate *dose* *effect*. example, demented 70 year old likely hit larger viral dose 70 year old insight behaved ways minimise exposure. fully vaccinated person gets covid viral load small even transmit severely affect person got infected. There's even couple studies suggesting vaccinated people can't transmit virus. need trust science accept vaccines work work well. Arguably, worse covid.

I even know arguable. Alcohol *definitely* killed people COVID ever will, continue to, ruin countless lives result actual death. 

Anyone believes forced vaccinations greater good society explain Prohibition 2.0 good idea. people autoimmune diseases even eligible yet NL. asked pre covid lol. recieve covid vaccin, keep stroopwafels Let rephrase that, theres proof long covid ISNT possibility vaccinated.

And see wouldnt possibility, long covid known affect people didnt even need go hospital, didnt even serious illness. first shot gives tons protection. 2nd shot ups efficacy 80% 95%. started process great shape. top that, home TP business TP (that thin single ply stuff come giant rolls) apparently completely separate industries separate supply chains, mass lockdown happened, actual shortage home TP, longer pooping company time, along surplus business TP could easily converted home use.

It took Costco maybe 5 months start selling business TP stores?  would say 3.5 antibody response doesn’t necessarily mean 3.5 times protection. 

Also article talking study conducted people older 80 First, subjective call, weight additional 9 weeks weaker coverage vs stronger coverage *eventually*.

And 3.5 fold increase immune response. know translates real world. Efficacy increases 95% 98%? Chance death remains approximately 0%? hard say. Hell nah variants spreading Taiwan?  NYT update headline, removed “homegrown” Antibodies way measure long immune system recognizes pathogen. example, cells, type lymphocytes, also target specific infections stay blood way longer antibodies. doctor, ask someone else specifics. know laboratories offer cell immunity test SARS-COV-2 days.

As far remember, something like happens Hepatitis B immunity, keep far longer specific antibodies blood. hand, think adults better able fight Hep B, sure due adult vaccinated children. Consider much public opinion changed topic past 15 months. It’s natural id say 3.5 fold bit ‘slightly stronger’ isn’t it? CDC estimates 41% 5-17 year olds infected US. Also regional differences accounted 

I live state that's freefalling hard there's entire swaths near zero community transmission low-density high vaccine uptake 

I'm going feel perfectly safe listening CDC ditching mask vaccinated person heart major city might yet  dont know else say dangerous virus relative anything existed (while also taking risk factor account). mean, locked 1.5 years virus problem anything before. im idiot online acknowledges this, leading doctors surgeons deal immunocompromised people also agree CDC quick broad statement. timing fine since vaccination rates substantially higher 6-8 weeks.

[KFF Vaccine Monitor, May adults (56%) nationally say gotten least one dose COVID-19 vaccine, (9%) say haven’t want right away...another 14% want “wait see.” One five (20%) still say definitely get vaccinated.

Even 9% probably over-representation imminent vaccination intent, since every adult surveyed already least month get vaccinated.

And need mask mandate protect 12 15-year-olds? They're much risk begin with, get fairly strong protection within week first dose, take week non-school activities parents really scared encountering unmasked people meantime. 

If want mask 12 15-year-olds vaccinated, it'd lot longer 6-8 weeks. link, 30% parents even want vaccinate now. Child vaccination rates probably take schools require vaccine (meaning fall earliest, FDA conclude full review then). can’t convinced, ultimately forced take vaccine. pandemic needs end requires participation everyone. Great. still shortage, country wants nothing us anymore gets this.  almost like still wear mask added protection (and based CDC recommendations currently discussing). CDC considered this, well current levels infection country trending down, combined level vaccinated people puts less risk time pandemic. 

Also, sure talking 2 weeks 1st 2nd dose, they've already 1st dose, already exceedingly unlikely get serious case. 2nd dose booster make already amazing results first dose even better. factory farms careful biosafety practices lab researchers playing guano. nothing like plague. Nowadays, people usually catch plague hiking groomed trail animals nearby carrying plague. catch plague small, incidental contact. coronaviruses, fine long purposely touch wild animals farm animals unless know doing. put people vents near death. last-ditch procedure covid, they've tried meds oxygen. people end vents die, generally vent-- virus absolutely wrecking lungs. CDC.org mention that. definitely wear masks long time, even though I'm vaccinated. Maybe street crowded places makes feel safer think makes people feel safer too. dunno specific vaccine method, probably mRNA one. So.... Johnson Johnson? dunno. seem know lot ☺️ one article quoted giving particular date. could end month people wont part.

They take vaccine answer question:

What long term effects COVID-19 vaccines?

That's problem right there. People hesitant (a) personal risk probably small (b) feel risk vaccines may higher risk nothing. (&lt;-- note said feel). vaccine? Astrazeneca? Wish countries could’ve proactive enacted similar tested tracing policies even local cases. Well done. No. normal sense anyway. destroy data magnetic storage media - like rotating hard drives, floppy disks magnetic stripe credit card, unless magnetic field astronomically strong, harm integrated circuit.  Country sends vaccines former colony shocker  Every variant that's tested neutralized Pfizer Moderna vaccines

Not neutralized, effective, albeit significant reduction cases. I'm trying hard feel way, living florida dealing assholes want mask want vaccinate, I'm finding hard so. honestly point care get covid mask havnt got vaccine. almost Darwinism, something like that. 

I know sounds fucked....but idk. people want protected potential carrier, get vaccinated. longer look them. look now. 

Until recently, one could insure safety. depended group effort that. aren’t point anymore. wanted deliver science individual level, also understand decisions made community's level,"" Walensky said.

The CDC guidance calling universal mask avoidance. There’s room govt business leaders still require really doesn’t bother me. teach 5th grade general education. well fitted nosepiece prevent glasses fogging crucial. found ear savers really helpful - sore ears started using (it’s strap goes behind head ear loops attach it). far actually mask on? It’s issue. Guess what? anti-vaxxers shed masks months ago. They're going spreading virus amongst regardless CDC does. Maybe everyone gets vaccinated get something show vaccinated. Perhaps tattoo numbers arms easily identified vaccine record traced number.  people US though. keep vaccination card wallet, mask pocket. see associate building I'm going in, ask policy mask wearing. say still wish see customers wearing masks. I'll put mask on, forth. used get angry people, I'm ok look nature's continued process thin herd. high risk kid. finally able vaccinate week, though. ""experts"" darj smart. COURSE PEOPLE LIE really matter though? It’s like CDC recommending/mandating masks actually caused people wear mask. wouldn’t wear properly anyway would “comply”.

At point, make sure everyone care gets full course vaccine, take necessary precautions protect others can’t get it, F everyone else who’s stupid trust science.  I’m expert also say that. Uh, duh  want 100% protection covid-19. vaccine schedule would best this? Third dose Pfizer 3 weeks second dose? Fourth dose 3 weeks third dose?

Assume healthy person, 40 years age.

2 doses Pfizer gives 95% protection original Wuhan covid-19, less protection variants like South African variant. Well, infrastructure put place sovereign country. Indonesia wanted land though, threatened invade. Netherlands really want another war jungle especially piece land set independence anyways. appealed US UN.

In end Indonesia wanted annex Western Papua New Guinea. US wanted join Indonesia. care Indonesia basically colonised it. Even 12-15 year olds, they're going instantly inoculated since got approved. 12 13 year old can't get another week, there's additional 3-4 weeks second shot plus two weeks fully immunized.  don’t know Brazil vaccination right now. Public protocol needs balance actually do.

For example, people think best way prevent teen pregnancy STDs teach sex tell kids practice abstinence. Obviously abstinence would 100% best way people issues related sex. But, enacted public health policy, completely ineffective.

The best thing prevent covid would every single person wear mask one go indoors other. going happen. Currently, people wearing masks likely vaccinated, people wearing masks likely unvaccinated. think there's point maintaining mask mandates point. People it. absolutely false. vaccine primes immune response virus doesn’t make seriously ill. doesn’t put shield around protect carrying virus home children trust *all nurses? won’t get vaccinated? Ok people recovered covid don’t get vaccine? fall Read sarcastic I'm saying someone vulnerable *should* take extra steps - also fucking idiots don't. People need account worst society. means someone vulnerable needs factor roughly 74 million people might less worried someone know personal inconvenience. ""why to"" argument weak sides. AFAICT comparison starts Jan1, 2020 ends current date

There [effectively flu season United States ). Hospitalizations flu we’re 98%. 

According CDC website, [less 5 children died flu since Covid entered hundred died age group covid dangerous seasonal flu

The CDC data back claim. Covid less threat children adults, that’s quite true. Covid still significantly deadly children Flu is. People aren’t following pandemic guidelines though public officials downplay danger virus year. many people refusing wear masks even though aren’t vaccinated many people refuse get vaccinated. United fronts *but* pandemic. “It time people sleep beds made.”

You’re exactly right - kids 12 made poor choice old enough get shot. need suffer consequences!  mean even going check? one checking. nothing stopping unvaccinated person taking mask hypothetical checkpoint, employee won’t follow around store. CDC hasn’t said it, many experts said haven’t identified documented examples vaccinated people spreading virus  like think average CDC employee little smarter average user here.

There's like zero justification this

All professions think ""smart people jobs"" largely filled average people like general population

You anything average get bachelor's days work white-collar job like wearing mask! I’ll probably continue wear one years chaos, TBH. Possibly wouldn’t make difference? I’m nearly expert think would make sense. potentially affects everyone long unvaccinated unmasked people get together continue spread virus among themselves, virus opportunity mutate - although vaccines seem protect current-known variants, there's guarantee they'll protect future ones. vaccinated could easily find back square one. makes feel better, flu dangerous kids Covid think people unconcerned variant vaccinated? I’m surprised wasn’t mentioned all. new guidelines seem make easier un-vaxxed go shopping etc without mask, looks gave kind free pass. stores allowing anyone come mask now. Anti-maskers seem freedom before. 

It's possible hesitant people become comfortable idea see vaxxed people ok time goes on. Ffs get vaccinated yourself. Stop worrying whether person next crowded store is. real concern unvaccinated people ability serve incubators mutations.

Wearing mask going stop catching it. able travel countries vacations, going public concerts sporting events, actual restaurant experiences, bars, etc. 

I’m 100% pro mask vaccinated btw, saying it’s leap say “everything mask on” cdcs website literally says immunocompromised people protected. 

With mask requirements trump yards vaccinated free walk around without masks spread shit. plan wear mask 1) positivity rate community consistently 1%, 2) community transmission categorized “low”, 3) 70% people community vaccinated. much plaid *Common Sense says they’ll lie. 

Fixed headline lock kids away, needing vaccine Sure, it’s risk. much life risk. determine society, levels risk we’re willing tolerate. We’re willing drive around possibly get killed. go flu season without vaccine masks. we’re deciding level risk you’re willing take regards masks. It’s complex issue science still clear. Vaccinated individuals low risk complications transmission. data robust enough Israel data conjunction vast hospital network study data cited CDC. vaccinated, still wear mask. CDC doesn’t dictate actual policy. facts dry way allows government make policy decisions.

I would actually argue adopting mask policy people want vaccine, gets one, helpful vaccine hesitancy effort. First you’ll less free without vaccine. employment may jeopardy you’ll higher risk serious disease. think incentives really steer toward vaccine.  Yes people honest responsible far. God dam act like shity elementary school kids. lot people either don’t get selfishly don’t care. 40% population totally exposed Covid bad idea. understand superspreader statistics anomalous? “Trust Americans honest” bahahahahahahaha find someone lying vaccinated? 
Ask election 
-Not joke saw r/jokes. Best one year new America? Luckily, I've fully vaccinated since beginning March. yes know fully vaccinated individual still spread/transmit, I'm ok small risk. participate high risk hobby adrenaline addict think risk assessment might bit different average redditer. *most children*

The staggering majority. I’m teacher doctor contact immunocompromised children, I’m vaccinated. life hold tiny, tiny risk? 

Indeed, parents children immunocompromised ones responsible, solely, shielding child appropriately. teach English, there’s way could wearing mask. Even it’s another subject, it’s gotta pretty damn annoying wearing one hours day. won’t. course public schools right require vaccination.

It’s governments job make best choices public health. It’s parent’s job make best choices, based knowledge perspective, children.  think least 40% people see masks wearing masks incorrectly, gap around nose—even journalists politicians. never see anyone correcting them. even perfect masks effective vaccine. could make crime lie vaccinated. what’s game plan then?  Stay home forever? Even n95, have, far less safe vs weeks ago businesses requiring masks. Masks mainly protect people. 

So fuck me?  Stay home forever? Wear mask forever? mask lost symbolism new CDC guidance. you’re wearing mask, technically means either 1) unvaccinated 2) following science. rule change, mask symbolized opposite. see left freaking can't group nurses together. union nurses article almost assuredly different nurses refuse vaccinated + engage conspiracy theories. 

The comment replied saying group nurses focus attention trying make vaccines mandatory group B nurses. exactly they’re saying deadly, virus going concentrated underdeveloped countries high population density enough hospitals, vaccine.  Amazingly written, like reading novel. lot nurses family, say thing common terrible work hours, sleep hygiene, they're crazy way. wear forever. Lots people refuse get program. think desperate people get vaccinated going studies saying people would restrictions/mask mandates lifted. mandate flu vaccines outlaw private motor vehicles. ballpark deaths among children society make large sacrifices lower numbers. would disagree it’s selfish. tipping point risk continued lockdowns preventative measures outweighs risk unvaccinated people. point going need understand always risk covid even vaccinated % population refuses get vaccine. “I think already it, last july something, nose running couldn’t smell wife boiling water. Pretty sure it”  I'm sorry plight. Yeah, sounds great people tout ""but kids low risk"". kid ICU. something I'd want parent deal with, kid ICU days well. Oops, always confuse :)  I've living pretty normal months now. difference me, wearing mask, really affect me, wife 3 kids all.

Hell kids 4, 4 2 wear masks better adults. start shedding vaccine proteins unvaccinated. ROFL think real issue CDC offered guidance TWO days CDC Director still peddling need masks capital hill. addition, failed give proper warning businesses figure approach fly.

Why wouldn’t given week warning upcoming guidance changes? CDC comical failure throughout, latest example. Theoretically vaccinated ppl protected, ivsccines usually generate antibodies. knows long. Still, understand quite possible ppl need vaccinated. I'll probably see Europe US getting boosters ahead getting first shot though 😶 lie likely die suffer consequences happens next pandemic 10x 100x worse

With regard mortality? spread. 

A virus deadly trouble reaching pandemic status first place. See: ebola People lie care - I'm vaccinated I'm wearing masks. get vaccinated, get virus ..... know, good luck. place turn big science experiment see vaccine crowd fares I'm really surprised quickly stores dropping mask guidelines seeing enacted quickly. saw store mask mandates pandering customer wanted safety. I'm also saying that's wrong wanted masks required stores well. However, see tide turning people getting vaccinated realize average person going keep wanting wear mask fully vaccinated. soon? Personally, feel definitely people life disagree me. However, always going people think sort movement forward soon. live area 70% adults least gotten first dose vaccine still people stuck March 2020 mindset. People seem unwilling process situation US rapidly better two months ago. lot probably due trauma last year hopefully time help heal begin move on. Luckily, anyone feel ready move forward still keep restrictions we're beyond point we'll get mass compliance everyone else. 

Can people fully vaccinated still spread virus people vaccinated? [Probably [really yet vaccinated? [Watch maybe [a look Comment - Vaccines variants issue.

[Old Comment - Additional stuff, thoughts.

If food bought last year Covid lockdown/emergencies/etc., time eat donate food pantry. expired, eat toss instead donating please. want prepared future emergencies, go ahead buy replace it, guess.

If American waiting turn get vaccinated, turn.

If vaccinated, turn help people get vaccinated. 

If strategy get older Americans vaccinated, please spread word. 

I think need get point get hospitals back normal operation get family doctors/GP's doses give like flu vaccine. like tons extra doses. Novavax help here.

The vaccines FREE US. FREE FREE, like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE. Go get one. Now. something stopping going get one today? Talk it, we'll get worked out.

More come. see ""highlight reel"" sub, rather FAQ. Kids never anywhere near risk already vaccinated, community spread way western countries, need get Yes unvaccinated required wear masks, since nobody checking anything. shit “sure” will! ;-)  isn’t flip understand facts. It’s called nuance. believe COVID dangerous adults understand much less dangerous children than, say, flu. local one still previous signage up.  big Couchcuntatoe himself. Exactly. We're hitting lull, know certain number people ever get vaccinated, guess scare folks hesitant scared getting vaccinated. idea hit even 60% population vaccinated within 6-9 months fall surge, might hit sweet spot. Guess we'll still wait months see. Noooo, humans lie? Replace ""experts"" ""anyone sensory organs least two functioning brain cells"" title bit accurate. Zoos aren’t run way were. We’re going next weekend.

You book ahead specific time. indoor exhibits closed. even 40% capacity, masked distanced. notice plans change time soon. Empathy who? Everyone risk could vaccinated wanted to. like stupidity. gonna obsolete soon. I’m fully vaxxed don’t wear masks outside soon mandated lifted won’t wear inside either. mean epidemiologist? work CDC? don’t feel comfortable mandate lifted doesn’t mean it’s safe do. trust CDC make right recommendations administration they’ve clearly seen enough data make call. whole “well yeah, but” “they may say it’s safe, but” spreading misinformation. Walmart, already effect customers. new rules take effect Tuesday employees.

The Walmart ""Masks Required"" signs still up, actually look them, say something like ""Unless Vaccinated"". get vaccinated stops #3. It’s possible become infected, virus won’t reproduce enough body give kids. amount relying idiots protects kid much getting vaccinated. worry still unvaccinated want be. continue wearing mask they're surrounded unvaccinated unmasked people store going certainly increase chances transmission.  always thought shutting schools safety adult staff kids. avoiding beaches aquariums, that’s personal choice. We’ve known since pretty early pandemic risk catching Covid outdoors much lower, though didn’t stop politicians shutting beaches anyway Hmm hard one listen doctor nurse lol   epidemiologist AMA Reddit maybe little month ago. said variant slipped past current vaccines boosters, would likely slip past immune systems infect us actually does, ruins experience bars clubs hurting big time. Tons places going business. me, period right getting shots lightest it’s probably whole life. weird! Let lie. Let unvaccinated diseased pack buildings left right… 2 things happen. 1, die stop pain ass society. 2, reach herd immunity much faster. don’t see downside point. Homie CDC political long time. Remember H1N1?  Hospital stays aren’t free. Every person spends weeks ICU costing tax payers insurance payers hundreds thousands dollars. Sensationalism never justified many cookies would like? I’m baking em “educated” homies  work bar Chicago people straight flexing don’t mask. Coming bar, still requires masks, without wearing one confronted saying “the cdc says….” Well shit.

People fighting wearing mask whole time, they’re 100% going lie. know several people refuse get vaccinated, even family members. don’t believe government actually believes people honest. think it’s experiment see happens. Certainly many people will. also large subset unvaccinated feel way appearing vaccinated vaccinated people feel wearing masks - want people know think one them. /r/OneJoke people could trusted wouldn’t mess begin with

It really perfect display selfishness. take expert come conclusion ...or kept news yet aware new honor system mask guidelines. Yeah, ever going everyone lives bubble. There's still collective responsibility. wife baby beginning COVID February last year, similar thoughts months immune system developed. (We'd already said accept guests flu shots, example, even flu serious newborns.)

At point though, really know alternative trying reach level normalcy. US probably never reach vaccination rates high enough herd immunity. Hopefully antibodies passed child protect early life.

You're rough spot welfare future child. wish best even vaccinated myself, I'd happily hope others whatever protect you. give example measles outbreaks, keep kids inside vaccinated measles there's outbreak.

If MMR vaccine, measles outbreak merely sad news headline. lock it, cancel school, try convince people vaccinate damn children.

The happen covid. happens flu. Yes unfortunately people cannot get vaccine. know everyone get vaccinated ability to. cannot wait people get matter what. option get many people vaccinated possible open country. CDC thinks point trust them. 

And mutations issue vaccines have. pharma companies making boosters troublesome variants. going issue compared beginning pandemic know virus was. Boosters made, tested administered quickly. Yes, mine got yesterday too... definitely wonderful thing. 5 weeks fully vaccinated June 19.  We’ve done experiment Michigan Texas Florida already.

From I've read they've similar results lowered u/Wizmaxman, u/Lyrrad0 u/Delvin4519

Legends that’s personal decision, every right get vaccinated  Moderna? Sorry answered somewhere else.  guess CDC recognized stopped endorsing mask mandates level, it'd pretty much everyone. likely determined point due vaccine rates declining covid cases. Whether math sound argue, idk, doubt sincerely thought people refusing get vaccine would also wear masks meantime. Yes, slightly risk. Still extremely small though 
they must **grow** virus make vaccine.  
Covaxin uses traditional technology similar inactivated polio vaccine. Initially, sample SARS-CoV-2 isolated India's National Institute Virology used grow large quantities virus using vero cells. on, viruses soaked beta-propiolactone, deactivates binding genes, leaving viral particles intact. sure got 1/3 from, assuming number reduced designing harder forge verification, still would benefit. I’m sure number be, 5%? 10%? I’m guessing number people anti-vax also anti-mask relatively small (but vocal) either would bother would know go forging/circumventing decently designed system. anti-mask anti-vax would get vaccinated. VV would wear masks. current cards course easy forge. test results. It’ll need sort harder forge document digital pass checked independently.  way wasn’t already considered cdc making new recommendations. want vaccinated easy opportunity get vaccine. refuse take masks allow virus spread amongst develop natural immunity. chose protected protected. masks off, approach community immunity quickly.

Fuckers.  don’t understand incentive, though. dangling carrot, it’s giving people carrot right bat hoping right thing.

1) I'm fully vaccinated

2) trust science.

As far I'm concerned Darwinism finest point. someone tell wear mask medical condition. I'm like ""yeah I've terrible asthma whole life abd wearing mask going 7 hours right now. think ok."" anyone resembling intelligence log shit know lie. Want know they're lying vaccinated?

firephly Reddit: safe!
 
I'm going go door number one.. WalMart follows advice former, think safe say they're following science.  I'm okay this. know vaccine 100% effective, I'm willing risk returning normal masks entirely optional everyone chance get fully vaccinated. prefer pretend like thing spread around real quick maybe many folks vaccinated everyone else hitting spike infections stumble heard immunity. isn't. Please stop spreading know anyone got covid?

I sure fuck want go did. buddy even get hospitalized, perspective even get sick, two months, waking pneumonia six weeks after. took six fucking months get back normal.

Dude healthy, early 30s, EOD army vet, fucking ruined year.

I find astonishing unwilling mask on. simple, easy thing protect people around (and yourself). reddit conversations last three days suffer performative eye-rolling goes ""trust science!"" science say people still wear masks. 

As people still wears masks going to, everyone around won't. 

As would *tyrannical* CDC say ""everybody please another weeks.""

As exact rules could least phrased ""still wear masks *if* unvaccinated moron read entire sentence,"" instead ""put aside mask *unless* hey wait going I'm done yet."" 

As - long CDC correct - matter anyone fucking listens them. 

Half conversations ended people shuffling cards like 'why trust CDC?' 'you're people trust CDC!' 'you think smarter CDC?' 'you *hate science!*' said goddamn word medical expertise. 

The half want people die. sounds super cool, street food sounds absolutely amazing, wish cool food like :/ mask advice seems rushed formulated presented poorly. True, though vaccine make immune. still hurt vaccinated people spreading them.

No. That’s way virus works exponential spread. stays underground, cases, clusters, it’s widespread. seems sudden, it’s not. Classic. America's fault. Never heard one everyone ripping masks off... fairness, border disputes Suriname Guyana go back colonial era (And since Guyana achieved independence 1966, British ultimately responsible territorial defense decade). something British Netherlands never resolved. remember Guyana 16-17 years ago Surinamese gunboats expelled oil exploration crew disputed waters (though international community recognizes Guyanese). issue Venezuela claiming half Guyana. again, border dispute goes back colonial era conflicts territory Spain British. think every South American country border disputes neighbors.

COVID less dangerous children flu. Covid far dangerous adults flu. adults get vaccinated. Children get vaccinated gets approved (which soon) prevent transmission, significant risk virus.

If think still need wear masks children vaccinated, saying need wear masks forever. Children always risk viral infections dangerous COVID: Like flu, anywhere near great vaccination for. Children reason CDC wrong, still wearing mask.


I think lot people point got caught political/symbolic aspect this. shell-shocked year this. facing crisis year so, proud wear mask symbolized ""pro-science"" ""saving lives"" helped feel superior virtuous compared weren't.

Now, excluding immunocompromised folks, wear mask either:
1) following science or
2) Unvaccinated

This makes lot people wail try justify shell-shock. Look, totally understand lot people, emotionally connected mask, despite scientific guidance, still want wear it. That's fine, people make irrational decisions time follow science. problem try come weird explanation convince following science. not. anti-science emotions important still wearing mask. Good chance fire dwarfs then. Experts said masks work, too. Sorry bluntness, learned lot. us decide keep healthy. 
The New York Yankees eight players positive Covid allegedly vaccine month ago. Interpretation info counts something, too.
You know body best. That’s one coworkers thought. Guess who’s COVID today? Whole families? one age 17 fully vaccinated yet automatically since little kids can’t get recently approved people 12 16 🤦‍♂️ won’t surprised children would cleared take vaccine 1-3 months though. Plenty states already open 16 y/o vaccination. matter whether anyone wears mask say that.

But didn't. 

And funny hearing rationale people tutting critics, contradiction. Several people pounding table like 'you can't tell CDC say!,' wanting clearer phrasing simpler rules would demand censorship destroys civic trust, also think CDC lying. 

That's people mean, say CDC knows rules would accomplish nothing published rules anyway. means CDC *wants* CDC *said.* 

Literally dozen arguments saying CDC undoubtedly right could get people right thing different word choice, versus redditors acting like that's thing antivax wingnut. 

Is more... reality team sport? Treating expertise matter blind interpersonal trust? would explain lot. Like say ""trust CDC"" even though rules obviously followed, mean, ever *question* CDC. Trust, never verify. claims exist evaluated. view science pure authority. tribalist mentality would explain ""you must put mask on"" treated equal opposite ""you take mask off."" 

As CDC saying ""you *cannot* wear mask"" instead ""do whatever want.""  unprecedented situation like entirely rational people take extra precaution costs essentially nothing abundance caution. scientific consensus mostly clear act like there's nothing left discover skepticism definitiveness scientific consensus ""irrational"" naive extreme. insistence contrary rooted interest ""science"" anything apparently strong desire feel intellectually superior people. less likely get side-effects Pfizer Moderna Astra Johnson?

I exams coming up, need decide getting shot day rescheduling much later. Can't really afford get sick, buddies Astra commission four days first shot.

I’m going bother second article first one starts completely full shit. 

It says Florida statewide mask mandates Disney open since July. Florida counties local mask mandates, stores required masks, WDW, past week, required masks worn times keeps people 6’ apart queues. 

People need stop acting like Florida great even though restrictions. far truth don’t trust anything else say that. people continue wearing masks ones already vaccinated. Wouldn’t accelerate unvaccinated crowd towards heard immunity one way another? any, he's clearly pushing narrative wear masks 4 months, kids permanent social skill damage

Imagine teaching kids empathy wear masks protect around them. important lesson could get actions could save lives futures around them. Funny parents lack empathy say make kids wear masks, enabling cycle ""me first"" mentality. interesting scenario playing out. direct passage hatred one generation next.  local Walmart morning. still giant ""face coverings required"" sign front entrance. everyone inside, customers associates, wearing masks.

Numerous people vaccinated still gotten Covid. ""freedom"" go without mask vaccinated much gamble getting shot MAY protect you.

I guarantee thousands people story.

I see science involved decisions anymore. political strategies favorable polling. George Carlin famously said “ever notice people abortion people don’t want fuck anyway?” seems like ugliest ones won’t wear mask. wearing mask really won’t cover kind ugly. course lie I'm pretty sure CDC knows this. statement probably based low transmission rates among vaccinated assumption getting vaccinated already, meaning hurt lying Masks already sold end January! hate people spread lie ordinary people buying masks March. none! Furthermore, hospital supply chains retail supply chains different. Redfield still head.

Haha, no, he’s not.   Maria Van Kerkhove World Health Organization’s technical lead Covid-19 caused unnecessary deaths numbering potentially *millions* something requiring little effort (reclassifying pathogen airborne) advised multiple experts - never allowed hold position power practice medicine again, one could argue failure rises level criminal charges.  good thing wonder time many nursing homes respiratory virus outbreaks given year, many infectious disease research labs are. suspect higher numbers realize. beg pardon?

Duh. Also, NZ allows citizens relatives citizens enter NZ transit country. However, unlike Canada, NZ demand negative PCR test transit country well.

It combination allowing direct flights, also demanding negative PCR test result transit country makes impossible Canadians return home. Keep mind get PCR test done transit country, immigration enter country, country allowing non-residents (otherwise, technically remain airside i.e. airport transiting typically). right, thanks! sort thing I'd do. Tie measures percentage people county vaccinated. 

And make also age group. enough age group vaxed sure eat inside go bar. not, not.  Honestly, people care herd immunity anymore, people want able say ""I got mine"" bury pandemic go lives. already seen many people basically say ""fuck anyone cant get it"" thread.

Use fear control behaviour Covid crisis ‘totalitarian’, admit scientists

Members Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group Behaviour express regret ‘unethical’ methods

Scientists committee encouraged use fear control people’s behaviour Covid pandemic admitted work “unethical” “totalitarian”.

Members Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group Behaviour (SPI-B) expressed regret tactics new book role psychology Government’s Covid-19 response.

SPI-B warned March last year ministers needed increase “the perceived level personal threat” Covid-19 “a substantial number people still feel sufficiently personally threatened”.

Gavin Morgan, psychologist team, said: “Clearly, using fear means control ethical. Using fear smacks totalitarianism. It’s ethical stance modern government. nature optimistic person, given pessimistic view people.”

Mr Morgan spoke author Laura Dodsworth, spent year investigating Government’s tactics book State Fear, published Monday.

Ministers faced repeated accusations ramped threat pandemic justify lockdowns coerce public abiding – claim examined forthcoming public inquiry pandemic response.

SPI-B one sub-committees advises Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies (Sage), led Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser.

One SPI-B scientist told Ms Dodsworth: “In March [2020] Government worried compliance thought people wouldn’t want locked down. discussions fear needed encourage compliance, decisions made ramp fear. way used fear dystopian.

“The use fear definitely ethically questionable. It’s like weird experiment. Ultimately, backfired people became scared.”

Another SPI-B member said: “You could call psychology ‘mind control’. That’s do… clearly try go positive way, used nefariously past.”

One warned “people use pandemic grab power drive things wouldn’t happen otherwise… careful authoritarianism creeping in”.

Another said: “Without vaccine, psychology main weapon… Psychology really good epidemic, actually.”

As well overt warnings danger virus, Government accused feeding public non-stop diet bad news, deaths hospitalisations, without ever putting figures context news many people recovered, whether daily death tolls seasonal averages.

Another member SPI-B said ""stunned weaponisation behavioural psychology"" pandemic, “psychologists didn’t seem notice stopped altruistic became manipulative. much power intoxicates them”.

Steve Baker, deputy chairman Covid Recovery Group Tory MPs, said: “If true state took decision terrify public get compliance rules, raises extremely serious questions type society want become.

“If we’re really honest, fear Government policy today playing roots totalitarianism? Yes, course is.” Wearing mask =/= shut down. going need assume many people unmasked public unvaccinated.

As fully vaccinated person care? Cases falling, vaccines longer required! Order mai thai!! Yeah, wish tied vaccination rate, ""once reach 70% vaccination status, masks needed"".

The ""if vaccinated"" clause useless it'll free all. Hell no. trade ""I medikal condition!"" ""I'm aready vaccsinated!"" Australia copied Hong Kong. started February.  Australia didn’t go nuts toilet paper lockdowns March.

In Australia didn’t hear “tainted Wuhan paper” rumours.  first shoppers grabbing extra wouldn’t go again, later folk reacting half-empty shelves warning friends get sold out.  (Which obviously led selling out.) reread posts...good god, trip. I’m unbelievably glad pessimistic posters weren’t right, lol. bad period time.  Pandemic dead buried!! proof finished pandemic resume normal life more. Let's order croissants!!! That's fine, fact, normalized. reason Japan handled Covid well (among reasons) wearing mask sick worried getting sick ingrained society decades. Even Covid, uncommon see plenty people wearing masks anywhere crowds, [this 2011. normalized mask-wearing like America, would saved lot lives. realistically, expect happen here. Japan hive-mind way nations are, least US. ""Experts""

So anyone pulse. pandemic over! Let's party!! pandemic over! Let's party, people!!! comparison, Vietnam population 100M, third US population number daily cases 40,000. US got point seeing 129 cases per 100M, we’d declaring end COVID. goes show considered worrying outbreak relative. Countries like Vietnam Taiwan treat small outbreaks super seriously they’ve largely successful throughout pandemic.  Want proof vaccines work?

According NYTimes data, four least vaccinated states (Wyoming, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi) also 4 states seen either flat increases cases per 100k residents last two weeks. Cases declining states. China's extreme response clearly right decision. effective reported? Probably scale. prevent disaster would made NYC look like side event? Yes. 

Everything we've learned virus since first national lockdown worst case it, fatality rate. airborne spreads without symptoms, easily mimicking flu even deadly cases.  We've likely reached tipping point damage done telling people ""get vaccinated act like not"" surpassed damage done telling people truth ""vaccinated means safe anything else life"". never vax crowd always thorn side, vaccine lazy, ones want *tangible benefit* key getting us closer something approaching herd immunity. scream ""Trust us, vaccines work, pretend *don't* work go out"" blue face they'll want something more.

And end day, mandate removal forced unmasking. Masks offer degree protection wearer, entire one way street *only* protect others. keep wearing like. ""anyone wanted it"" gotten vaccine yet. 36% country vaccinated, issues accessibility people disabilities minority neighborhoods communities. Also, children yet opportunity vaccinated, families kids 16 still heightened risk. 

If unvaccinated people lie go around without masks, prolong pandemic continuing spread. people choice going out, like asked return working office going grocery store. hope wear mask they're vaccinated, completely eliminate risk infected, especially unvaccinated carriers walking around without masks on. Masks silver bullet.  Im completely understanding people’s anger frustration. It’s gonna take time people adapt mostly normal way living. It’s best judge people going forward everyone gonna take time assess personal risks. It’s shitty year us I’m glad we’re finally moving somewhat past Incorrect lot Californians partake census, numerator/denominator, number bottom fraction, off, true percentage vaccinated californians lower asserted.  someone else U.K. tell point living is? feel like Indian variant surge testing going inflate cases become self-fulfilling justification keeping restrictions eternally.

I got mental health better this, many plans feel like it’s going come crashing we’re going become one zero COVID dystopian states without benefit normality aren’t cases.  lying unvaccinated people go maskless, 1) infect cannot vaccinated (children, immunocompromised, cancer patients); 2) raise rate breakthrough infections; 3) increase probability new variants. steady trend downward. thought would wait certain cases per day within 65%of adults vaccinated range. little early. probably right call. Clearly troll. 

Bye. Yes, one person. political talk, pride. reflect people really think here. little weird random event. Basically dropped note saying pandemic US. vaccinating people... Rapidly. 85% adults least partially vaccinated beginning July (1-4 July) 60% fully vaccinated go. time reach that, already hit demand problem, currently 75 80% adults wants vaccine. CDC real BIG disservice saying vaccinated people longer need masks without showing proof vaccinated. anti vax republiklan family went kept saying vaccinated not. makes mad already vaccinated working pharmacy. 
This type attitude going keep pandemic around awhile. Anti-vax continue complain masks still needed.
CDC also disregarding children started get chance get shots. children coming pharmacy shot excited, make happy. CDC waited longer say masks longer needed. 
Does CDC even backup plan fails anti-vax going lie say got vaccinated? pandemic going continue roll along. everyone getting cut go ahead. 

This guy Thailands. Exactly one reasons joke TIL, wow. Based science child survival rate 99.9995%. 200 53M positive cases died including tested child population. Tons children never even got tested, rate much higher.

The numbers even lower 0-7 years old. absolutely mind boggling amount people still think they're vaccinated still spread virus.

Guess makes expert. Fake ID dealers business rough clubs bars closed. surprising considering new niche similar always using strategic decision making. told vaccinated people wear mask—not wasn’t safe—but didn’t want unvaccinated stop wearing too.

Science can’t tell 99%+ reduction chance getting serious cases covid enough go back normal. person responding qualified educator children? Higher Education failing massive scale people person talks exist majority primary system. Paywall vaccine available everyone age 11. 

I never support forced vaccinations. 

We cannot live lives way forever people refuse get vaccinated. 

Simple that. It’s insane suggest otherwise. Restrictions rest lives people refuse vaccinate. Absolutely not. Like said previous post, people refusing vaccine haven’t wearing mask anyways. live area you’d expect serious COVID, people wear mask threatened kicked out. People maskless indoor gatherings since last summer. CDC made right call here. Kids access soon enough immunocompromised screwed either way considering we’ll probably never reach herd immunity. Yep, 13yo niece got first yesterday, waiting 10yo niece next.  adults family (all vaccinated) mostly stop wearing masks (still situations).


At point, let rest covidiots will.  We'll eventually reach herd immunity levels due infections rest them.  you’re assuming CDC didn’t take account? Respectfully, believe accurate. understand motivation think data showing happening. First, J&amp;J vaccine requires one dose, least-used vaccine (fewer ~10 million doses USA), let's ignore it. look [plot ""number people received first dose"" vs. ""number people fully number people ""fully vaccinated"" trails 3-4 weeks behind number people received first dose. exactly we'd expect vast majority people received first dose vaccine went got second shot weeks later.

If ton people skipping second dose, ""fully vaccinated"" curve would flatten much sooner ""first dose"" curve. Instead, they're tracking other, offset time.  make difference.  287 children died covid united States throughout entire pandemic. half country vaccinated. Far children die drowning every year. Far more.

UK also limited supply US demand. despite UK opening 35s next week, still lot people get it. US stalled though looking unlikely they'll able reach similar numbers. I'm glad trust CDC. still remember CDC said scarves could used face coverings last year.  

They seem wishy washy based administration IMO, that's opinion last 14 months. CDC knew people would lie. put responsibility individual people. Smart move CDC. CYA day. looking data Israel well.

And even gained natural immunity, getting vaccinated seems like best bet assure long term immunity. Haha, im far you. got haircut didn’t wear mask. generally go flow rules state. business “no mask, service” policy I’ll wear it. really feel like I’m 2-3 weeks types policies going side eyed bit.   people can't get vaccine? Even HIV Cancer patients still get it. ""233 longnut drive avenue"" variant Ya, thinking today. Walmart Costco decide end mask policies puts ton pressure competitors, follow suit. people stop carrying masks altogether puts pressure small businesses might want change policy yet. Still spread covid “trust science” circle jerk happens doesn’t work. Top comments frequently “losing faith humanity” disgusting people taking CDC recommendation wearing masks distancing twisting match narrative freedom/keep businesses going, recommend vaccinated people don’t wear masks side coming twisting match theirs, “what variants, CDC didn’t consider people lying, etc.”. 

People always take science apply interpretation match applied science (policy) political beliefs, self reinforce think right side completely wrong.

This pandemic great example confusion, interpretation science side, heel digging camps, conservatives taking less cautious approach liberals taking cautious approach, extremes side rejecting CDC recommendations based previously held beliefs.

A complete joke. Thanks. Annoying kind embarrassing get lumped anti masker group simple mind slip I’m vaccinated.

I respect right enforce masks establishment. I’ll go elsewhere evens out. don’t disagree point. It’s risk. always nice blame everything. 38% adult population vaccinated children 12 eligible. seems logical keep simple, inexpensive, effective precautions place. 

I honestly don’t understand what’s difficult wearing mask anyone excited remove continue protect everyone we’re eligible vaccine transmission rates dropped. mention disabilities transportation accommodations. nonambulatory first weeks vaccine available. plenty folks continue nonambulatory need extra assistance, simply folks without transportation waiting friend/family member vaccinated able transport them. Thanks explaining that. So, what's solution controlling people do? without solution there, going accept people want make adjustments end factor in.  Needing people mentality... I’m tired seeing many people going sides calling idiots aren’t exactly others want. It’s genuinely sad see.   Open season anyone unvaccinated. You’ve accepted risk.

My friends wife hospital right Covid. She’s unvaccinated vaccinated. CDC say whatever want, businesses probably still require them. right to. It’s strictly same: effectiveness vaccine scientifically measured. Policy proposals/guidance CDC straightforward. Yes, CDC based guidance scientific research, weighs factors well. 

Case point: discouraged mask use early worried PPE shortages. scientific basis saying masks effective, CDC (rightly wrongly) thought supply chain concerns important. 

So I’m saying CDC absolutely wrong issuing guidance, I’m also aware might weighing different factors coming decision. lot cases, things black white (ie, either ISN’T right time end mask mandates), spectrum gray. case, valid position say cautious end spectrum. 50x WHO. kid significant risk covid 19 vaccines (specifically MRNA ones) protective elderly younger people? want know Dad (fully vaccinated Pfizer, 70 Parkinson's Diabetes) protected (28, fully vaccinated Moderna) masks going away. I'm following CDC guidelines like told would. like mask guidelines announced felt important wear normalize others. think important wear mask state without mask policy per CDC regulation order move things back normal.

If still want wear mask fine though would weigh personal risk. person without compromised immune system, without comorbidities covid, fully vaccinated, dense crowd? Probably drop mask.  son high risk chronic lung disease gets sick easily non-pandemif times perspective different child would considered healthy. nutshell. businesses care profits safety. sucks feeling helpless job bullshit like this, hate it.

Makes sense. makes sense antivaxxers feared COVID, don't. cover need unmask without getting vaccinated experiencing social consequences. clearly fear social ocnsequences far virus hence shrieking oppression basic public health measures. CDC appeased worldview.

You can't think normal logic live normal reality. Pets damage homes guy. Cats scratch carpet, etc.

It hurt you. person matters. 95% infection, pretty much common cold less people 5%. 

You completely lost sight reality think restrictions masks etc relevant something essentially common cold. people vaccinated point US made choice likely group like 12 kids really doesn’t matter much for. I’m afraid you’re wrong. US fully vaccinated 37% population UK vaccinated 29.6%. they’re needed they’re needed. proper thing say right “we don’t know” like numbers are! know.... case water. Like case covid-19 except h2o...

Except expensive, bottle costs less.

I mean, duh, get together. feel you, dude. I'm really sick lack nuance around masks whether suck not. Like acknowledge value fully compliant mandates still hate them. I'm tired hearing ""ItS PiEcE cLoTh"" rhetoric time someone appears less stoked wearing mask. share ADHD diagnosis, I've wear mask 35 hours week whole thing, yes sucks. pinches bridge nose, gives headache, makes face itch, say lot nuance gets lost terms non verbal communication. Also, really get raked coals bringing circles, actually make little harder breathe. understood point. simply worth grinding society standstill specific people risk alter lives independently rest us.   stay home instead? charge damages deposit cover, even take court it. add another bill, send collections. advocate masking feel sick? Exactly. That’s something lot people don’t get. It’s important keep masking mandates cases, **even you’re fully vaccinated.** believe wait kids vaccinated fall ease masking. one situations overraction far preferable half-measure.

There significant number people United States would severely disagree statement, ironically unfortunately falls along party lines state federal governments fear mongering unconstitutionally stripped people’s rights them. too, dude. Antivaxxers become mainstream. live Vegas. parents work casinos. They're saying 90% people maskless. Remember like 30-40% US population fully vaccinated (last checked).

In news, I'm glad Vegas popular fully vaccinated people! can't lot people lying, right?!? No, vocally care them. One person possibly causes *damage around them* one overly *cautious health* that's ?

That's akin thinking guy doesnt believe jackets work par guy keeps spare rain jacket incase rains.

Being cautious trumps ignorant.  Dude, they've lying year now. vaccine makes easier, believable lie.  may want read CDC guidance again.  solution continue mandate people wear masks public regardless whether vaccinated. CDC make recommendations wants, local governments relax mandates people fined wearing masks. like it, way like get car smog checked every two years, want drive car that's happen. 

Unfortunately, know local governments mandate people wear masks law enforcement enforce do. people die. one people risk, would stay home next years pandemic control globally. remember... 

You right animal, landlord right take deposit give carpet expensive shampoo, full replacement get cat dander next person. legally take mats cleaning fees damages move out. say next person moving moving pet free zone reason need accommodate potential allergies. 

You right evicted it, still going footing bill whatever needs done make apartment cat free again. 

Have fun that. Yep dec 19 me. Worst flu I've ever had. Def COVID cares people lie? Everyone access vaccine point choose get it. for, get covid it’s also fault well. need move lives. I’m going continue wear mask protect others refused vaccine, don’t care enough protect rest society that’s them. initial aim get one jab everyone high risk groups maximum effect quickly case levels high. 

Now high risk groups least one dose. choice second doses high risk, first doses low risk. 

The maths changed new variant, increasing cases makes sense get extra 10% protection 60yo rather 70% 20yo.

Oh bunch middle-aged women flipping wearing masks Costco? know, terrible 42s? cares do. Get vaccine scared. Let worry themselves.  enough vaccines now. We're active ingredients Sinovac Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines (probably due Bolsonaro's comments China), we've received first 2 million doses (out first 100-million-dose order) Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine we're yet receive first J&amp;J doses makes matters way worse ones willing lie wear mask vow never get vaccine.

That’s understanding — Prime Minister Boris Johnson Britain said Friday vaccination protocols would changed swiftly deliver second doses people 50 combat spread coronavirus variant first detected India, warning sign countries easing restrictions even though vaccination campaigns incomplete That's fine, point scream CDC recommendations year, finally favor wear one say ""yeah but"" buts. I'm vaccinated I'm allowed demask. Shush. Totally fine want wear one, force keep it. put risk. hold us vaccinated hostage anti-science sentiments. arena Saturday, long lines sprouted entrances seven hours main card began around 10 p.m., fans standing heels, others wearing cowboy hats, UFC shirts least one pair American flag dungarees. quarter state’s total population fully vaccinated time, medical experts said large indoor gatherings carried added risk. Rochelle Walensky, director Centers Disease Control Prevention, cited accessibility efficacy vaccines CDC’s Thursday announcement relaxing past recommendations . say “well, duh!” Maybe.

H1N1 (Spanish Flu) never became endemic. possible COVID go way pop decades. even need experts. KNOW people lie we've spent last 15 months listening entitled assholes making fake medical conditions justify wearing masks.  sure, I'm Canada know it'll happen either cares though? get vax, protected. decide to, deal consequences... think key point you’re less likely spread vaccine mask. Everything hoped accomplish masking better accomplished vaccination. Wearing one shot doesn’t really make difference.  [Here's discussion might thinking of. positive detection old waste water samples March 2019. there's reason skeptical this. One, big one, match epidemiology. test also specific, could RNA junk false positive. lying I'm gna bed mamma. Next up, water wet! Stay tuned info break. Wow. Nice work.  real kicker home made cloth masks perfectly acceptable apparently. established science, could told us beginning... Exactly phrase ‘new normal’ makes sense. Normal relative whatever comes really contradiction. back using vaccinated population force unvaccinated comply public health measure. 

It's social pressure. Similar we've done past months despite people increasingly vaccinated. Technically could abandoned masks, would complicated efforts. we're limited demand, drop pressure. CDC said guidance individual completely leaving state local authorities decide mandates kept. 

There’s issue safe vaccinated people. Specifically happens unvaccinated people ignore guidance drop masks too? apologies, reading comment realized missed ""here"" nurses. never meant generalization commenting personal experience post mine stating lot nurses refused vaccine. experience, true. likely said physicians, RTs, Rehab staff, etc. case work can't speak directly. ""Water wet"", adds Director. Lawsuits what? Perhaps flu many times less dangerous??? Ever think that? Ever think general? expert could told thay  states going get herd immunity hard way. it’s still going happen. Anyone met anyone knows people lie. Spend time theme park boards, people stuff kid’s shoes ride roller coasters aren’t safe theme; reasonable chance getting caught. course lie this. Unless you’re mass transit. kinda contradicts completely safe you’re vaccinated. 

To clear believe you’re safe enough wear masks you’re vaccinated mass transit exception interesting caveat. experts? fact ""mitigation measure"" seems lost lot folks link [archive link anyone trouble accessing article thats fine.

People keep wearing masks makes feel safer. Buckle bc vaccinated teens vaccinated. cares immune system compromised long kid safe Please show company hired panel experts examine this. need free money also    lie like lie us: without remorse. colleague's mother got spent three months hospital finally succumbed. siblings trying cover bills incurred cost funeral. makes queasy (and angry) thinking it. Yes many businesses masks social distancing affect (cruises, bars, clubs, hotels, etc). businesses drastically affected year cannot continue like much longer. cares? Saw post recently, might Twitter, said something like, authorities recommend practice, already two weeks. suggest change, keep two weeks, see happens. Seems prudent me- I'll waiting 2-3 weeks see numbers look like change go nuts shitcan masks, gloves hand sanitizer (s/) .  Doesn’t take experts figure ridiculous stupidly US government across nation handling covid vaccinations.  variant posed reasonable threat vaccinated individual date. spike protein conserved across variants. 

Moreover, Pfizer Moderna proven update mRNA form booster rapid turnaround.

It really matter that's CDC issued guidance. Y'all seem think trust means ""don't ask questions.""

Nobody disagreeing CDC vaccines. rules would fine, people followed them. 

But won't. 

So either rules matter, people might die... or... rules matter. 

Insisting CDC planned everyone lie, intentionally announced rules nobody would follow, ""trust"" much ""4D chess"" nonsense. inventing secret motivations layers insincerity avoid asking, ""Why would say that?"" 

And insistence changes self-reassurance cargo-cult behavior, pointing obvious disconnect gets shouted ""trust science."" Guys. science rules matter. rules matter, fact people follow bad. rules matter... them?

And gets *weird* ""why rules, stated way?"" treated like asking CDC lie. Rephrasing exact rules focus still needs mask would dishonest way. Neither would recommending everyone keep wearing masks matter *anyone* wears mask, want stubborn among us keep wearing masks, that's going happen.

We expect CDC lie. think appropriate CDC lie. think CDC currently lying. 

But... you? casually asserting said one thing mean another reads like accusation defense. “Experts” must California, like me. Let start saying Democrat, also fully vaccinated, emphasize comment. tell based talking parents states across country, kids 12 vaccine yet, likely even get Covid, data currently shows multiple places chances children even ending hospital forget God forbid dying, less .01%. stay safe God bless They’ll lie, they’ll die. mine vaccinated…quite frankly, they’re fucking problem anymore. even need lie though.  Who's seriously going ask everyone they're vaccinated? Good thing need be. Get vaccinated fine. getting city level, imagine residency issues make things difficult?

Not undocumented residents, personally drive 15 miles away get vaccine I've heard people traveled lot farther C.D.C. use standardized method reporting helps facilitate comparison states, you’re one that.

That's probably best post like this.

But ultimately, important number going whatever number state chooses use easing restrictions. Except big surge hit them, agree. Michigan recently lifted mask mandate fully vaccinated today. going enforced? Lol wear masks Walmart still I'm fully vaccinated, want raw dog Walmart air anymore No. trust vaccine enough protect me, even encounter untrustworthy jackasses. Especially given it’s *outdoor* event. Sheesh. Reddit generally dislikes children dislikes reminded exist  pretty hard time seeing would difficult someone Alzheimer's someone without.

I doubt was. way see it.. essentially nurses/doctors telling family lie, order it. lazy, also many medical profession think unethical take life saving measures people likely going die, extending suffering. Hence things like 'slow codes'.

Could also way pre-emptively triage. concerned resources getting stretched, dissuade people unlikely survive using resources. Someone dementia could end vent weeks months, even survive come off, could use many hospital resources recovery.

Could also government/political pressure keep ICU numbers down. mean, pre pandemic stereotypical antivaxxer probably shopped exclusively Whole Foods. grandfather relatively fine dementia. got covid couldn’t even walk swallow three weeks later. Neurologically covid serious damage vulnerable. 

He passed week that. China exports: vaccine diplomacy; since released virus
China export: china bad!!! Methinks y'all misread this. supposed like commute? agree. majority Canada's COVID-19 deaths occured Long-Term Care Homes due terrible conditions places elderly people Dementia Alzheimer's likely placed Long-Term Care Homes many major covid outbreaks occured. us look beyond selves selfish self absorbed empathy many many people waited turn line getting vaccinated fully protected (both adults teenagers, became eligible), kids, immunocompromised people.

I'm guessing get vaccine week care did? I'm guessing young kids teens became eligible? immunosuppressants know people are? risk U12 dying Covid less dying flu. permanently lockdown lives prevent dying flu too? ever put car? Sad. see employees getting shot killed beat asking someone wear mask? coworker got spit asked lady put mask on. line thought, reason never telling someone put mask is: going wear mask pandemic, going react rationally asked wear one.

Edit: [Just one example, percentage folks think take vaccine said done? Referring Total population numbers here.'

I'm guessing get close to, quite hit 70%. Maybe 67-68%

Not want, obviously, better might expected. pandemic scientific issue then. 

The pandemic social construct ended Thursday May 13th share says tested negative? can't see policitian holding long. two weeks. said 50% gotten one shot, best two weeks, worst 5 weeks+. Lol obesity epidemic talked all? That's gotta joke  know retailer would let anyone without mask. customer didn’t keep mask whole face told leave 2 warnings. Quite times security escort people would leave voluntarily. didn’t fuck around came people’s safety Covid. know that, ignores people 50 turning vaccine. wife’s shoes, would opt Pfizer Moderna. blood clotting problem literally one million, women 55, that’s *only, tiny* concern would have. go together, you’ll probably get one. lot complicated nuanced getting safe, simple vaccination zero cost. I'm asking chances COVID-19 virus mutating due spread among children something prevented current vaccines. speaking wrong language? second person misread I'm saying.

I'm asking since something I've seen anyone talking about. I'm sure answer ""we really know,"" I'm wondering there's data hinting towards answer.

I'm probably expecting much comment deep random thread sub. I'll try research. politics supported it. CDC purely scientific organization. think he'll okay. lives parents, vaccinated outside errands, owns online business without employees. 

Also we're CA, mask mandate place June 15 bit time get first shot maybe even second he's quick, time complete 2 weeks after. He's aware risk, procrastinator, he'll minimize exposure done. 

But he's kicking now! agree lack warning unhelpful, esp folks advantages has. Good! mean... year + now? companies using CDC recommendations justification requiring masks... cdc says masks aren’t required you’re vaccinated... would seem awfully hypocritical mention science still required masks now. Sounds like “may” happen. don’t want kids.  Yeah mitigate risk situations. Weird…parents also mitigate risk keeping kids home. Oh I’m sure will. took feel little weird wearing one, least me, it’ll take feel weird wearing one too. hope people won’t get aggressive either way. Yeah I've bitching security awhile consultant helping that. Mostly I've annoyed CEO cheap lol laptops. ordered 15 past week everyone slowly transitioned that. Maybe 10 people need vpn quickbooks we're also moving everything cloud based q4. 

So all. bad. like dude we're taking 5 months even get product in. Worldwide chip shortage. Buy now! He's like oh yeah makes sense it!

I moved teams phone office workers 8 months ago worries there.


We got hit couple times gift card scams. clearly troll LinkedIn new employees

Lol first day onboarding warning that. dude got jammed 8 830 met day one smh haha Horrible horrible government. Hell nope. also every clinical indicator flu, safe assume flu? don’t actually know period prevalence covid19 all. discovery samples taken pneumonia patients early September 2019 Europe testing positive SARS-COVID-2, serological studies California showed Covid19 antibodies likely 10-50x people initially believed spring 2020 data becomes impossible accurately use, coupled reliance qualitative PCR/NAAT testing diagnostic criteria zero objectivity epidemiological perspective, we’ll likely never know. It’s like keep library sources internet comments, look yourself. far better metric YPLL, (years potential life lost) traditionally applied epidemic/pandemic scenarios measuring burden presence particular disease context morbidity measured life expectancy. metric conveniently ignored throughout covid19 pandemic single metric could thwart much health promotion surrounding severity disease. went Trader Joe's Georgia everyone wore mask well. Thanks pal super useful Exactly. I’d rather larger conversation obese nation people age FAR likely kill someone. isn’t talked all. Don’t wanna fat shame. absolute joke. Yup. article said ""wear masks least another year,"" nearly burst laughing. 

Fat chance that. people still can't get vaccinated. real choice aside bringing daughter anywhere public. whatever want. places open now. People need quit dramatic extreme like OH GOD WORLD CLOSED. No, not. People asking us continue wearing piece cloth faces bit longer inside stores public indoor spaces. immune system sucks doesn’t good job fighting things off. get cold get horrible cough every. single. time. usually lasts least month slowly dissipates. It’s afraid covid. type person get cold feel better 5-7 days. I’m type person gets cold minor inconvenient symptoms. Ever. miss work, need see doctor, get bronchitis sinus infection. Masks covid restrictions great aspect life. Trust experts bro. science bro. expert bro. Please bro. trust bro. Trust science bro. Congrats! still ongoing widespread testing various settings, including nursing homes &amp; medical settings. Cases getting picked (though somewhat rare &amp; mostly asymptomatic).  Yeah makes sense Someone brings trans women make multiple comments getting ignored statistically matter, resentful 'cis women' attention.

You're see-through plane glass come surprised 600M last quarter Disney cares one thing thats money 50 likely die car accident Covid... Yeah, like people going inspect laminated card much. seem like lot effort would make stand more, less.  Yes yes yes!! People acted like selfless last year tried protect others...bullshit. given rules follow trying protect immediate family. people actually cared wellbeing others society. really shows now. People care - vaccinated that's matters. lol think I'm less politcally motivated. two week old daughter. wonder long approve infants? least may protection wife's vaccine. CDC really changed scope places feel safe going one day. That's racist! Dang shame. Good thing phone already one though. Like fake CDC card? Oh shit idea [archive link anyone trouble accessing article It’s alright, worst passed yesterday, nausea, vomiting, splitting headache, soreness, fatigue, tiredness, today mostly gone except I’ve picked dizziness. Weirdly enough redness swelling injection site. No. people least likely get vaccine likely lie it. Agree. parent 12 year old gets vax next week, still 5 weeks go without full protection younger ones none likely fall (though 2 months ago said 12-15 would fall too, and, well, true). thing is, know he's high risk severe covid, type 1 diabetic. 2 years ago, spent 3 life-threatening days PICU 24 hour stomach bug...because dealing diabetes illness is. top it, covid patients get isolated meaning harder care conditions like diabetes properly. needed 24 hour monitoring labs every 4 hours observe risk brain swelling. Would get kind care covid patient? schools small town 400 students, 8 diabetic. increased risk severe complications death get covid. that's them. high risk kids, too. story every school. 7 day ticked 18+ 7 day ticked down.

Somewhat inevitable think. There's way first dose number indefinitely accelerate get everyone wants it, assumes equal willingness access every eligible American. realistic.

I'd obviously love keep increasing, long maintain healthy first dose numbers, think we're ways hitting wall people *never* get vaccinated. even number gone look polls December. think we're good spot. Culture war baby!

But feel messaging confusing, along response ppl who’s opinions respect 

Like I’m person doesn’t mind get covid doesn’t want kill someone else it, seems like fine go back normal? Idk honest, would think people going much trouble vaccinated want convince others are. Kids spreading getting sick it. There’s tons reports kids dying facing long term affects. heck last year? know haven’t gotten vaccinated you’re using tired talking points morons whole thing. Grow stop whining piece cloth. shouldn’t amaze many adults seem crybabies claiming others living fear man it’s getting old. Nice! got second Modena shot today eastern side State.  Indian variant? biggest (initial cash) expenses working home expanding VPN access mobile phones redirected calls. Fortunately fibre bandwidth good site licence software (inc Microsoft teams). shipped office monitors, keyboards, mice risers wanted (not many).

Recently cash going security, improving backups, auto patching software, consultancy, etc. many industry getting hit. attacks encouraged poor security quick rollout remote staff seems. matter time hit seems.  America, Canada wealthy nations begin recover start return sense normal, really hope become lackadaisical happening areas world.

You mean, like COVID? I'm sorry, article feels like mindless fear optimistic happen, even quickly many Americans hope. **In five years**, expect Covid-19 like flu, circulating lower rate deaths every year — longer public health crisis necessitating lockdowns.

Nice. Implicitly making sound like could take 5 years go back normal (even though question ask support 80 percent say people continue wear masks indoors** strangers **for least another year**, outdoors crowds.

With due respect, far removed normal people experts? I'm vaccinated. I'm extremely low-risk demographic. ample population immunity. Cases plummeting (including states removed mask mandates month ago). 

I've happy part past year. no, plans remain wearing masks indoors another year. infected them. lack treatment. Sadly, given done warning, people like brother may end getting covid result. Even gets vaccinated next week, take several weeks kick build antibodies. elected coworking membership covid still go. walk office live city, office shitty basement studio apartment. like leave home, bc day depressing -- even lived ex giant house, went coworking place, quality home. pals coworking spot, i'm self employed coworkers, go every single day work. ton reasons like wfh. everyone gets monotony lives burbs.

Can't imagine would acted ww2 fighting common enemy kills Americans. 35% people fully vaccinated telling people mask like lol.   proactive step could saying get vaccine date x date lift restrictions vaccinated people. warning result people getting covid unnecessarily getting vaccinated right immunity kick in. remember people dying covid today offered vaccine weeks ago. cannot fix stupidity. Lol theory still thing... time. Cute. let take risk, make life comfortable enjoyable rest us. We’ve sacrificed enough. roommate tested positive around year ago, told us quarantine month case we'd exposed. 


She stayed isolated unit left food door.  Im expert. don’t understand statement made, seemingly, cuff. like, must known people would lie. I'm liar, also say people lie. Source: lie that. “Why wear mask? pass wearing mask inside store, going liable? You’re covering medical expenses right?”

Actual BS argument person tried job.   blind actual human behavior defies belief. hope govt business leaders come realization it’s worth risking virus tearing half population point vaccines approved kids months.   downvote you, downvotes matter anyway. primary concern?  way!!!! certainly agree sentiments, believe it’s extremely poorly handled politicization IMO neutral issue added paranoia skepticism amongst people falling along party lines. consistent message sought understanding best respond virus locking us months, would different. Instead, sizable portions population sides scale extreme paranoia virus almost complete indifference Indeed is.  Ah yes, CDC director said dangerous new wave coming March. cares people get shot wont wear masks. CDC Director stated they'll endanger themselves. shot protected. ive seen americans lie lot less feelings mixed. Like, course they’ll lie also anyone wants vaccine, barring children, opportune month, continue inconvenienced anti vaxxers, anti maskers? trying rude. I’ve wearing mask work 8 hours day since august I’ll comply rules, I’m fully vaccinated what’s point theater? that's really mask. Smooooooookin. lifting restrictions tied overall vaccination rates. Won’t lie don’t say anything gonna lie, probably valid argument anyone could make.  went Cave City Kentucky yesterday cave tours stuff family. Seen thousands people shit. I'd say less 10% masked up. vaccination rate 36.2% fully vaccinated. yea, they're lying. I’ve shots, family isn’t fully vaccinated… still wear mask! least 75% people I’ve seen weekend maskless… statewide indiana, full vaccine rates aren’t even 40% Pretty shocking see “PhD scientist” basically claim masking effective vaccines stopping transmission virus. also completely omit naturally acquired immunity, also going effective masks. 

We masked cheap somewhat effective; somehow morphed masks ironclad ways prevent transmission supported data.

The cherry-picked point Taiwan completes anti-scientific comment - Taiwan one effective countries quarantining infected people entire world. basically like China smaller island. Vaccines liked this. outbreaks caused small pockets unvaccinated people. California actually good job cracking these, surprised me, voters often far-left here, especially communities problems. California took action, think two states deep south mandatory vaccination requirements children exemptions. genius said would okay stop wearing masks? Me, husband, daughters got RSV early 2020, felt like wanted die 🙃🙃 people Trust me.

What do? different Texas?

Before, mask mandate, meaning anti-maskers banned places. one, they're allowed go places unless business mask mandate own. 

This thing, applied entire country. people drive seventy highway believing they're immune car accidents, people die car accidents.

You said backwards. people die car accidents, people drive 70mph logic vaccinated people walk around unmasked long unvaccinated continue wear fairly obvious, problem practice equally obvious, opinion.

There logic all, obvious otherwise. Vaccinated people walk around unmasked, period. depend anything unvaccinated people do. Again, entitled opinion kidding think logical. else done it? Everyone wear half mask awhile smooth transition? Define ""effective"" . Effective asymptomatic covid? Effective mild covid, effective moderate covid? Effective severe covid hospitalization?

Because variants emerge, vaccines ensure safety moderate, severe hospitalization.
Isn't main thing focus on?

A mild fever symptoms disappearing 2 days never problem Covid. main problem pneumonia hospitalization death.
ALL vaccines currently available protect us according current data. Uh, what? course will, I'm fully vaccinated. I'm worried Covid anymore. willfully unvaccinated infect either recover die. Either way, problem.

Fuck em. Well stated It’s perfectly reasonable assertion.

The people shouting others follow science longer following science they’re acting on:

1) personal anxieties (“the mask encroaching freedoms”/“it’s early recommendation”)
2) faulty information/disinformation (“I don’t know what’s vaccine”/“I don’t know enough vaccine transmission”)
3) political reasons (“mask enforcing government control”/“I don’t want take mask don’t want seen Republican”)

If truly following science trusted CDC - like you’ve trusted past year COVID - wouldn’t wearing mask anymore you’re vaccinated (unless immunocompromised public transport). 99.9% adults lol  ...and poor understanding psychology. got bad flu February 2020. Still took shit seriously. Come on, hard. ""Jab"" British thing?  Yep, it’s great preventing severe illness, it’s indication people vaccinated J&amp;J still spread virus. Additionally second coach confirmed last night also mild symptoms went away fairly quickly, good overall- make guidances hairier (until studies come out). guidance specifically says vaccinated, still need mask distance. includes kids.

It going get mad, least mad something that's real.  Rofl go ahead downvote away almost literally quoting word word director CDC. Per transcript, ""If fully vaccinated, start things stopped pandemic."" course quote needs context, saying ain't “it’s prohibited “ answer

They probably say quiet part loud. job straight said would panic customers. answer always free stuff. Find thing people state/county value most, give free shot. Tons craft breweries? Free beer choice. Crippling gambling addictions? Free lotto ticket. Progressive suburban neighborhoods? Free subscriptions gluten free meal plans. !remindme 2days reasons microbiological standpoint. Let's gooooo!!! 💪 Here’s don’t get, people started wearing masks CDC guidance won’t listen cdc. 

It really really shows bad metal health effected this. They’re going people told first place don’t trust them, trusted enough wear mask told to. 

It’s really interesting study. Schrodinger's virus continue amazed I’m gonna tell grandkids “So CDC blew whole thing open declaring anyone vaccinated could stop wearing masks, pulled surprised Pikachu face Americans started lying.”

Wait...they probably won’t get reference... 😥 Nothing video said anything masks work. Can’t comprehend video designed children? idc politicians work made tomorrow, customers need masks regardless vaccine status. anti-vaxxers covid microchippers much hassle point But…they’ve available easily. Isn’t individual responsibility? seat belts. know going, ya?

never heard anything body expressions regulation. call statement BS afraid vaccines “unproven long term side effects” don’t concerns apply virus even among 99% survive initial infection?

Actually, aren’t concerns even greater virus? never vaccine suddenly causes problems years road. Conversely, plenty viruses this. Chicken pox virus cause shingles later on. Hep B hpv cause cancer. coronaviruses like SARS MERS caused long term respiratory issues. need stay inside, that's mask for, genius. shit. I'm gonna keep wearing mask. Starting enjoy anonymity errands also skipping makeup used feel almost required Yeah lol would people lie Swine flu brutal well. sick nearly 2 months that, way work we'd pull carpool people could puke. 


Someone come work attendence points wanna get fired. 


70 people, hotdesks attendence points. got it, keep working.  brother his, he’s 24

I reckon get 90-95% start issues uptake. people drink, drugs, smoke, get sick, go hospital expect Doctors heal them, again. People stupid, act self interest, make logical decisions. sympathy people, hope end hospitals full people like denying care others health issues can't get care. chose take vaccine, wear mask, get sick, stay home, let nature take course. First name: Noshit
Last name: Sherlock

Can confirm people lie. agree you.

Also,

Your username fucking funny honestly, think people honest. people honest still huge problem. semi concious observer could tell kind obvious Exactly. care someone else does. made decision based understand risks be. see risks made choice. That's ever needed  I'm fully vaccinated believe science, care anyone near without mask anymore. Let anti vax idiots lie get covid. They'll start die slowly lol lie die. Wouldn’t dead now? Yes, we're race. need people vaccinated, *yesterday*! I’ve listening BS alarmist freaks long wrong every single time, forgive think you’re prediction worthless.

You’re people thought Ron DeSantis going kill state Florida, Texas lifting it’s mandates would lead disastrous spike could definitely catch virus somebody’s slip stream cycled you.

You’re addicted worry mask. stupid theory basically wear masks eternity “could be” super variant whatever. people Science Real signs ignore science - that’s you. also need eye exam get driver license need glasses write license. 

never heard anything body expressions regulation. call statement BS  used work Walmart door greeter. Arguing idiots draining left. Didn’t know - surprised it’s news especially anti vax outlets. 79% we’re 65 doesn’t say much older 65. Wonder 80+. 

Still good enough odds get back normal life tho. he's still alive he? can't wait see people like react little fuck people give whole thing. bad all. Let thing reap rewards. Maybe won’t get summer, come fall/winter viruses love thing won’t disappointed see herd thinned bit. 🤷🏻‍♀️  shit   love state aware are, also hate state fucked everything gotten. Housing incredibly hard. Every year see homeless people streets. 

&amp;#x200B;

On certain parts Redondo, see nothing RVs camping outside street underpasses tents makeshift sleeping areas. Walmarts always packed people sleeping cars parking areas. another month get back normal? A: Nope! wait enough people get vaccinated removing masks always wearing them. Vaccines widely available many people afraid get shot don’t want it. kids, risk statistically low. rest population suffers selfishness others.   hospitalizations can't almost 100% prevented free (to patient) vaccine, still valid point. one guys sisters mom's brothers wife's niece took vaccine immediately dropped dead? Yes could still rear ended drunk driver.

The point is, level risk willing take them, right? Yes, countries supply mains constraint distribution speed makes strong case delaying it. I'm states. obesity crisis (and relatives' friends') radars years now. Also, individual level obese may likely kill COVID young, obviously true population level. COVID killed people past 12 months obesity related diseases normally year (~300k). 

Source obesity related deaths:  Ethics &amp; morality hopefully help probably much unfortunately. sure seeing that. find, lowest since July steadily I’d guess no, without changes (cash payments, sort barrier don’t it, like can’t get plane, dunno else) Yes, sure hell wear seatbelt do. Taking basic precautions safety kids makes sense they're faced disease carries risk long term problems respiratory circulatory systems. we're talking right now, year now. Unfortunately yes.  Nope. Next wave cases, go! argument could literally said hospitalizations. brings urge FAR greater things attention cause hospitalizations. 🚨I work hospital though, know. 🚨 [They one highest rates childhood I’m curious help vaccines authorized younger children. Walmart isn’t bad get outside peak hours. think turned 30 realized place one little better taking showers. I’m teacher, students still testing positive weekly basis. It’s precaution. Takes effort. I’ll probably wear one whenever I’m sick now, get others sick. I’m yard work.  brother describing first Covid patient, youre fool say dangerous. nation 100% vaccination almost zero hospitalizations almost zero deaths. want argue almost component youre arguing semantics. vaccine prevents hospitalizations death almost everyone functioning immune system. wait see Thailand works out. Disruption menstrual cycles known side effect, shouldn’t permanent result body’s immune response. would also appropriate compare menstrual cycle disruption vaccines, unfortunately it’s tracked research (women’s health appallingly studied).

Also, course link news article. You’re replying post created linking news article.  China still little cases? sealing truth?  I'm really talking Alabama particular, I'm talking people across board lazy, apathetic, reluctant resistant getting vaccinated.
 
Get fucking shot. Everythings opening back up! hope Indian mutation can't evade vaccine get us locked again. chance hitting 70%? Sure I'll trust whoever says they're vaccinated plus got bridge sell lol. /r/brandnewsentence someone option getting fully vaxxed (like us point), cares MAGAFCKS get vax? sure matter even desere treatment... I've made comment responded people asking it. back off? Christ. Honestly anybody purposely spreading misinformation profit prosecuted. know free speech everything, seems fall category illegal shout fire theater whatnot. current weekly average deaths highest Texas June. live someone get vaccine. want get sick 4 year old son.  intentionally dense isn’t good look. Yeah, relative risk what's key here. mortality rate Covid average adult something alarmed about, mortality rate someone vaccinated, child, got similar lots risk assume daily basis, like flu car crashes. can't live life without assuming risk... Covid used much risk, thanks vaccines, isn't. internet already waaaaaaaaaaay better US. from, 24-75% indoors 5% outdoors. eligibility expanded 12+. going next reason keep masks ""couple months"" I'm truly curious now.

The variants. couple months: “yes, 80% country vaccinated virus, quadruple hex variant India prevalent form virus vaccine hasn’t rigorously double blind tested variant. would irresponsible lift mask mandates face risk, especially children unvaccinated!“

Damn, people. Get vaxxed, get booster fall, move life. Can’t take vaccine? Stock N95 masks accept got shitty hand... miss part also said still low risk? worry you, though. draw short straw get hospitalized it, hospital bill paid combination taxpayers, others insurance plan, patients hospital. get large enough sample size, people going draw short straw. population level, puts big financial burden society matter average age people refuse vaccine. Like said it’s also low risk vaccines 100%. also many people lying able wear mask lying vaccinated I’d prefer keep wearing one. kidnap anti-vaxx force vaccines  Confronting customers without mask part daily existence past year. Every day least one wanted argue. Yeah, I'm vaccinated. I'm risk anybody's children. Go bark tree unvaccinated.

But, parents probably children continue taking precautions. stop outdoor entertainment like this? Studies repeatedly shown fine. missed previous comment that. 

Funny though people saying “just keep kids home” ones crying asked stay home whole time. expect kids able handle “staying home” better grown selves. Interesting.  Thank you! people lost risk perspective I’m parent! worries. want people informed make best choices! Holy fuck can’t believe didn’t think Okay, enjoy last another metric, embarrassment state. Same! Well, got first shot. center near full past 6 weeks finally, FINALLY got appointment past week! Kinda mad wait long also, nice hear (and see went in) busy place getting people shots didn’t say made selfish jerk. said leads good chance look like lot people running around lying vaccinated. I’d prefer still wear mask low risk. It’s totally gross people snapping candids random people choose go unmasked past day social media shaming. logic “unmasked = endangering others” can’t true US. I’m trying empathetic want keep masks that’s cool. say let unvaccinated people go maskless want risk infection loved ones. could give two shits people put civic duty public safety. Let Darwinism work out. Anyway, I’m confident vaccine going protect I’m without mask. don’t cozy strangers anyway. feel bad parents kids people imunocompromised, antivaxers would get damn free shot, people would protected herd immunity. me, miss accountability working office. I'm distracted home. point I'm open either way work now, even though bullish wfh start. fact you’re posting bs statistic says idea you’re talking about. clear, immunocompromised people actually *can* receive vaccine, don’t know exactly effective them, depending condition, treatment, etc. Adults genuinely can’t get rare cases. mean didn’t say everyone else thing me. you. I’d prefer still wear mask low risk still. 99.5% survival rate says otherwise totally get thank sharing story me. know someone POTS well know debilitating heart goes you. I’ve weighing hands, agonizing getting jab, too.... worried setting already haywire immune system. I’d read encouraging reports RA forums course, rheumy recommended it. don’t even get flu shot every year cause fear ramping immune system. I’m definitely anti-vaxx anything, know fraught decisions autoimmune diseases delicate balance ride functional non-functional. little reaction first jab besides fatigue reaction 2nd jab significant. watching carefully little flare 2 weeks post vaxx could coincidental. best luck you, hell, especially us vulnerable. end day, never forget rheumy telling ended hospital Covid would far likely would end needing ventilator. don’t need to, though. almost certainly won’t catch covid, even symptoms mild none. inconvenience irresponsible people. Even made infertile (hint: doesn't), I'd ok small risk that. always adopt.  Hi! dad wants get vaccinated vaccines country Astra Zeneca Sinopharm. searched little bit around internet want get Astra Zeneca. question wait month 2 Pfizer vaccines arrive get vaccinated now. heard pretty bad things Sinopharm one, mind get vaccinated it. True people free think however want. I'm saying America value individual freedom. covid numbers flatline nothing 

Which obviously won't. idea ""no COVID"" pipedream since day one. virus recede, people become resistant it, people forget even exists. new strain common virus humans resistant to. new strain problem new. Nothing makes particularly dangerous. Good job California way almost 2% people get Covid dying. death toll would much higher.  Sure, second shot important long term defense. important lose sight last thing want vaccinated percentage drop get caught guard again. Congrats! husband father got second doses last Friday, mom got Wednesday, 17 year old sibling got second dose yesterday. I'm happy they're getting all! 

My father-in-law gets second dose next week. mother-in-law still fence, we've agreed patient try answer questions her. sister-in-law's fiancé (the couple lives laws) helping us get board though... disagree. It’s poorest folks Alabama. government manipulated failed time time again. Give incentives!!! ones need most.  Ya definitely slap face. lot people MONTHS MONTHS get vaccinated. Like eligible way back January time. 

The general population allowed schedule starting mid April many states. back still chaos, push date May (especially tried schedule ahead time, appts then). people given notice oh better right second else...

Even someone got vaccine day eligible mid April, would still considered fully vaccinated today, since takes 5-6 weeks. It'll fine. vulnerable vaccinated. curve flattened. Kids high risk. choose get vaccinated, sleep bed made. Go bar trivia anyway. Sit bar. decent trivia people want team weeks anyway socializing bit meantime anyway. Honest question: news headlines panicking vaccine rates dropping inaccurate? 7 day average going up, shouldn’t nothing worry about?  lot contradicting decisions

I feel like missed some. know first months two said masks useful said let's conserve limited mask supply medical personnel. else there? Washington post really hates new mask guidance. like 8th article telling us it’s bad adhere masks, mean shouldn't. children elderly vaccinated. Masks work downside continuing wear vaccinated herd immunity. honor system get others sick best? trust others much? sure don't. trust 17-25 people voting poor judgement. Im anti-masker. limit human contact. waiting full FDA approval.

I think continue mandate masks FDA fully approves vaccines.

Anybody open discuss allow anti maskers punish children, immunocompromised, healthy minded skeptics? Hey, congrats! That’s great! Except kids 2 might never able vaccinated. going eventually deal like deal flu. many options:

(1) get vaccinated (and wear mask abundance caution)

(2) pickup delivery groceries

(3) family members shop her

Your anxiety nonsensical. There’s way say serious face addressed/talked NEARLY enough/ much covid FAR lower chance killing you. states international? asshole genuinely asking. data Indonesia showing 98% effective preventing death 96% effective hospitalization. clinical trial results indeed worse  1.5 years old. Thanks, might anxiety thing.

I instances worst anxiety I've ever experienced toward end last year start year working office covid taken seriously been. (lax mask wearing, coworkers take seriously all-- one caught 3 weeks) children don’t die even much complications COVID flu I’m mistaken  ya good point wondering common is, i'm vaccinated *shrug* I'd rather miss participated vaccine trial? know you, I'd consider great deed obligation. way comfortable guinea pig; incredibly appreciative people took risk everyone else's benefit. don’t say 🤔  many clients refusing vaccine tested positive virus. say naturally built antibodies. convince get vaccine parents also mention vaccine administered? one got choice “if” received vaccine. mandatory time wasted getting everyone. Polio didn’t much chance change. 

SARS-cov-2 adaptable without necessarily needing mutate, has. Current vaccines help. However, already people vaccinated still infected virus. I’d say bit concern virus along long lasting damage person’s system. probably die spread people die disease. frustrating thing care people actions affect everyone themselves. ranks 50 50 could convince wear mask protect children. I'm loath wear one protect unvaccinated. live get one time. 386,000 Americans living Leukemia.   Going 95% 98.5% isn’t 3.5% increase effectiveness. increase means *3.3 times* effective. risk becomes 1/3 was.

To calculate that, take 100% - 95% get 5% risk one case. get 1.5% other. Divide get 3.33.

As another example, N100 respirators (99.97% filtration 0.3 microns) “5% better” *166 times* effective N95 respirators (95% filtration 0.3 microns): take 0.05 divide 0.0003.    doin red science blue science today? Since we’re topic... it’s hard see irony getting groceries seeing massively obese people standing outside little Caesar’s pizza mask on. think mask rule may premature month so, another year go.

It's like black white.

We definitely continue mask mandate maybe 2-3 months. rate vaccination, go down.

We relax number cases go down. base policy number vaccinated people.

Yesterday WA +2000 infected cases, high last year, WA issued 6.5m doses population 7.5m. 

Measure result, action. management 101 probably difficult concept grasp vaccines gotten effectively prevent attaching first place, new list prevent death severe disease allow attach, 99% vs 50% vaccines called 'vaccinated' adding confusion Canada states get either dose second shot short supply find take answer question though, said risk virus mutating children, negligible risk.

That's risk virus mutating impact younger cohort negligible.

I'm asking risk virus mutating *due spread among children* way would cause *not affected current vaccines*. comment take either elements question account.

What answered different question: ""Is possible virus mutate would cause severe symptoms young people?"" That's asked all.

Thanks link. already aware already lot strains, primary basis question begin with, that's really great breakdown known variants. I'm guessing answer question is, ""we really know."" park fine. inside building park. walk around Epcot eat/drink example.   Shhh already cuz everyone around sure af act like it. Drove past whole ass wedding today mask sight neighbors partying. Pizza guy dropped pizza mask. Illinois btw  students eligible get vaccine. mask distance.

Many highschools 14-18 years old... antivaxx idiots worry thou, would say throw em wolves. immunocompromized allergic people want vaccine, cant get one whatever medical reason, ones need protect vaccinated heard immunity. However, heard immunity works certain population percents, antivaxxers making may actually reach heard immunity.  Children aren’t level serious risk aren’t spreading it. 

If you’re elderly vulnerable haven’t vaccinated don’t need honor system need people take responsibility health take extra precaution. force EVERYONE keep masking them. 

Personal responsibility time. 

Time ditch masks. you’re concerned stay home “safe” We're nowhere near herd immunity Okay thanks Nearly half Americans fully vaccinated. unheard almost nation. America obligation hegemony help nations, especially nations less well off, get vaccinated. immunocompromised person, really hoping would wait actually hit 70% fully vacc'd area removing mask mandate - wish would dangled front middlers (people unsure getting vacc'd) instead jumping removing mask mandate entirely even hit 50%. They're saying we'll herd immunity (70% vaccinated July) really, really hope they're right, I'm also little concerned might early us want go again. Cant read article?

“He bed week. never tested positive virus, doctors called presumptive-positive case due exposure, family, symptoms.” Even single shot twice effective flu shot. essentially vaccinated first  risk sounding like republican, point out: kids don’t die virus issue resolved far better before! Correction: giving anything 8 billion people hard. blowback. employees getting physically *assaulted* assholes want rant masks. Absolutely fine. friend girlfriend made blood pact stronger due this. also thinks cases going ‘skyrocket coming weeks’ due cdc decision   reliable way determine someone vaccinated, reliable way enforce masks unvaccinated. Proof vaccination easily forged card. someone self identifies vaccinated, get take mask off. point, verification system would require blood draw, won’t go well. read article...

And...?

The AstraZeneca vaccine less effective mRNA vaccines Reddit...  


The vaccines GREAT!!! everyone fretting shit really matter? Now, California close borders let anyone who's unvaccinated. world successfully work marketing project without actually strong interpersonal relationships people working with? 

I guess every marketing group likewise acting autistic, bar pretty low, still. makes feel optimistic! Hope right. days can't decide hate (usually deblasio). comes another wave. Sorry healthcare workers. So, basically, translating away BS: new Starbucks rule: 

Masks optional Definitely valid point agree also. think we’re speaking two truths here. wish there’s attention action obesity like covid (partially due death rates also due cost puts health care) don’t want paying people’s lack action covid. Holy shit might end Reddit thread civility. There’s four five weeks left school year areas go June. don’t see big deal continuing masking weeks. Re-evaluate situation get closer August-September (depending area start dates).  provide info? Company size? Industry? Thanks source info! **WHAT?** 

**HANG SEC. CAN'T HEAR YOU.**

**FILLING TUB GAS**

&amp;#x200B;

Should people pump gas plastic bags fuel shortage? Please don’t, officials ridiculous death qualifier problems caused covid. professional athletes use inhaler thanks getting covid. Long term health problems also serious concern. personally know two kids, 9 12 got Covid beginning last year bunch shitty symptoms won’t resolve. GI issues, visits cardiologist, multi system inflammation. Pretty sure GI kid get feeding tube. got second shot today, far feeling pretty good County info correct. State pulling SD's ""% eligible population"" data reporting ""% total population"" reason. teenagers exactly getting vaccinated high rates right now. Furthermore, smaller towns may schools including vaccine eligible aged non eligible grade levels 

Seriously, parents refusing let kids get vaccinated, even are. sister's ex straight threatened sue vaccinated nieces, eligible, he's actually vaccinated Newp. want fyi.

Thailand mostly sinovac. forcing people get sinovac.

None developed countries use sinovac.

China even use sinovac. one produces it. use sinopharm people.

Sinovac credibility... relate. lol’d way hard this. Cut arms, legs, dick off. part 99.5% survived! got second one today! relieved.  No, 1 month since vaccine available general public takes time virus die down. hitting 50% levels today.  like hit 70% covid gone tomorrow. 

If someone got vaccine yet definitely anti vax.  month. anti vax people 3-4 months. Anyone know Mississippi ranks education level US? 

I’d bet money it’s bottom 3 states. I'm saying risk Covid UNVACCINATED comparable risk flu vaccinated. whats best individual, whats best society.

You apply lot things. 

For example, kids poor creates lot problems society.

Smoking kills indirectly. Commute also kills people.

Alcoholism known break apart families. Millions families.

Yet ban this. Arguably, worse covid. originally said probably want 70-80%..

Depends mean ""normal"" though. Things getting better hopefully continue move positive direction, covid probably around extent while.

Also, varies lot region. Mississippi worst, 25.8% fully vaccinated 32.5% least one dose. neighbors much better. I'm glad enough shit time learn lesson wind hospital. thought vaccines nated people still get covid become contagious, what's point guidance ? makes even worse people can't get vaccinated could, yes. Many cops declining vaccinated. behavior thus far indication than....no course can't trust people make right choices. words, mine. explaining satisfied partial vaccination wrong. attached monetary incentive get vaccine. would get people it, even think pointless. us literally cannot jobs faces covered--I'm musician, able play instrument anywhere except closed office year. cannot *teach* properly Zoom. made work year, exhausted do. I'm sure see like important job you, that's job can't it, kids want living can't learn it. 

I'm still going wear mask crowds strangers, college students getting shot getting back normal classes. I'm 5000% done Zoom teaching. hated it, students hated it, done. flu shots prevent ya know Marketing, accounting, comp sci, couple Remember, masks help prevent infected spreading, really wearer contracting.  people choosing vaccinated MA. issue one coworker, going issues there's lot indicators going mandatory post general approval, especially many employees choosing get share vaccination status willingly forget also Fauci ardent supporter risky Gain Function research viruses, singlehandedly got Obama's ban lifted Trump. me, actually *confirm* opinion covid politicized? Vaccinations common there, one...?   pretty much required handful states anymore, idk means It’s end world wear one, year, florida summers even less pleasant mask. happy stop. You’re close. Hang there.  much Cuomo's ego?

Unless sign business’s door requiring it, masking.

I don’t care people assume somehow “a selfish jerk” masking CDC finally says don’t to, **I** know done, opinions change that. Here's article written [Ralph Baric gain function work coronaviruses newborn home. I’m taking chances That’s true, anyone 12 interesting! agreed, continuing AstraZeneca certainly makes sense South Korea case problem immunocompromised, cancer chemo patients, kids, willfully unvaccinated (even though deserve it). 

This reality people every flu seasons since beginning modern society.  Got name one kid happened to, even vaccine? It’s tiny portion population that’s immunocompromised, sorry gonna wear mask them. Besides risk COVID way due prevalence decreases. choose get vaccinated, dug graves, I’m responsible bad choices. They’re adults, decide shit human hair 70,000nm current silicon lithography 5nm, chip quite easily injected bloodstream. it’s still safe thing stage vaccination takes courage accept mistake apologies it.  


You good person. man” haha live New York idiot.

Well, know... would lot easier remember whatever bullshit spouting stop deleting comments, Saucey\_bitch\_boy.

These hit run tactics indicative someone low self-esteem superiority complex... might sound contradictory, hear out.

You seem compensating inner feelings inadequacy, latching ideas feel superior. Thus obsession me. Whether influenced team (perception management), organically really obsessed 'proving wrong', obviously invested great deal identity idea 'normal' return soon. betting man, I'd say probably little bit (perception management obsession).

Truly, I'm flattered drawn attention.

In honesty, I'm talking u/Saucey_man (the redditor), I'm talking person behind keyboard... real human. Look man, hope normal right around corner. really do. father three young men, really think want inherit fucked world? Na dawg. want grand-babies. want boys live, laugh love.

I believe we're yet. Could wrong? Sure. believe better err side caution.

Now, like continue little tit-for-tat u/Saucey_man, I'm game... realize, I'm one trying prove anything. think start seeing surges places masks aren’t required? Hey man, people mad you, I'm going politely ask go ahead get vaccine. safe, free, easily available, unless younger Reddit's TOS allows, qualified it.

I get it. new, seem necessary, never know might sit table away restaurant could risk, know natural immunity bit weaker vaccine immunity. freshman, students.  Yes, I’m sure know CDC /s Imagine thinking zero data supports it. I’ll prob keep actually, helps allergies, winter cold, smile ppl small talk. Don’t worry shaving beard. already research field required wear mask it’s like meh. Oh okay. Well hope that's case. Seems like big thing researchers overlook  waited 2 weeks would meant every 12-15 year old possibility get least first vacine. 

It would also meant every 16+ year old chance fully vacinated. government talked Dutch government, knowing USA respond. situations usually leave Netherlands solve. They've done frequently past, NL solve problems Suriname. really question of:

Will people incentivized get vaccinated vs

Will unvaccinated people get hospitalized die due removal mask restrictions

Personally I'd really like see data someone talk it. We're trending right direction maybe matter. okay people concerned fate unvaccinated people public health decisions like this. Even stubborn/ procrastinating/ hesitant..etc

The I'm vaccinated care happens people mentality really good argument I'm still ready let go mask indoors, even though I'm fully vaccinated, work 2 coworkers probably going get vaccinated required so.

I also know happens breakthrough cases. Like still developing clots even they're fully vaxxed, testing positive virus? trust vaccines enough work Great another circlejerk post. Maybe address real reasons majority vaccine hesitant people avoiding vaccine. That's 20 million people, give take. shabby. happening. End story. issue. COVID 3x less dangerous Children Flu. Transmission rates already getting crushed vaccines. Approximately 60% US form immunity COVID numbers going around half million day Vaccines alone.

In US, COVID ending. gods like this. 👎 gonna comment number correct one please? US case fatality rate 1.8%, 6 times claim .3%. misconception COVID individual problem. actually societal problem, course. Runaway epidemics tons collateral victims, even among people sick. seen spades last 15 months, massive business failures, supply chain collapses, millions people losing jobs.

By turning stores retail establishments super spreader events, going prolong exacerbate damage society, whether spared actual disease vaccine, not.

We need start thinking societal terms. remember odds dangerous mutant variant coming form America rather small. population low compared India places, odds dangerous variant vaccines can’t protect come place. Wait, didn’t test positive, assumed? contact symptoms? 

Like, it’s probable related. *has* better case study “Kid never tested positive virus flu like symptoms, 4 months later chronic breathing issue related unconfirmed case COVID.” Starbucks sucks think what's nice decline, unlike last summer, we're seeing explosive growth certain states/regions. MI's big blowup seemed last major micro-surge, even states saw little backsliding seem trending well again. Worrying outbreaks many Asian countries previously contained Covid. Taiwan today similar number cases, Singapore recently went lockdown, places like Thailand Cambodia went zero cases last year sustained outbreaks now. That's workers, office workers. Excuse me? CDC charge public health America! Also 188 number many infections? Probaby less COVID. normal year 60,000ish people die flu. 400,000 people died last year COVID.

Let's Monster Math. really division, that's hard people. .31% Flu deaths average year children. round 400 COVID deaths children .1% COVID deaths children.

Simple math. Without restrictions sample sizes large, ratios stay same. Flu literally 3x dangerous Children COVID. ... get volunteers? control variables?

What imagine [surveillance be?  I'm fully vaccinated, point choice want wear damn mask.

If unvaccinated idiots (not cases legitimately can't get it) want wear mask get shots, point.  I'm gonna carry vaccine card around proof. never wore mask outdoors?  point actually protecting unvaccinated children. child vaccinated wear mask indoors among strangers know vaccinated. Vaccinated people course remove masks. think people use opportunity wear masks even vaccinated. Personally, quarantine shelf stable items corner house week. room temperature, covid shelf stable. it’s right thing do, based current understanding Tread carefully friends. written one-person two post blog disguising kind science publication site. holds PHD Philosophy/ Psychology... 'publications' dating advice (which little fanfare).  


She dog race debunking anything related virology, vaccinations behavior Covid19. Even worse, comment response (ever, btw) - challenges assertions, demands citation provides none. refers wordpress blog 'we'.  


There's plenty credible information COVID19 current vaccines there, coming actual medical scientists - never mind self proclaimed 'rogue scientist'.

Saying needle nose away misinformation would rather generous.

Stay safe. Right businesses suddenly dropping mask requirements. competitors do, well lose lot business. Oh I’m sorry, misunderstood.  agree. US offered send ""Strike Team"" India doctors turned away. Yeah, agree everything said here. general attitude US authorities seems ""let's hope best get economy open again!"" rate, charitable interpretation.

Something country faced millions citizens long-term effects pandemic. least people seem pretty well disabled, presumably need medical care period years longer. would slightly comfortable US national health-care system would provide citizens, course don't. mean, cis men would definitely classify effects taking spiro find positive effects negative effects. Mitochondria, duh. never taken basic high school science? way please no. need traffic complaining hot cold office simultaneously. come back, use thermostat wall adjust temperature liking. totally fake install keep calling us can't figure wear sweater. Someone posting Facebook feed think bad masks discouraged went outdoor art festival wore mask horrified everyone going around maskless. mean, I'm sure everyone maskless vaccinated, also true 50% people vaccinated perfectly CDC recommendations wear them.  goal first foremost make death preventable make sure COVID handleable healthcare system. Death preventable vaccines. data countries, Healthcare system longer threat US. measures ending. goals met.

Exactly. goalposts moved overnight 100% eradication covid masking social distance rules dropped. never believe impossible anyway.   Saying ""thank science gods"" sounds dumb. Thank god common phrase trascended religion literally everyone says it, regardless beliefs.  read article? I’m scared, I’m use wearing masks  hearing speculation 60% vaccinated (Or least one shot) county (or least state) sounded reasonable. Many places close already. dangling carrot help vaccine drives. tying local vaccination rates means recommendation specific region too.

I live Florida county near 55% partially vaccinated. drive hour county 30%. WDW county 42%. guidelines places seems ridiculous different situations Per 100K Daily new cases align differences vaccination rates.

But 60% vaccination goal realistic doable within next month basically entire country. Less time get get rate new vaccinations back around April. I'm suggesting masks forever. I'm even suggesting much longer. 

I'd also think ""Cases per 100K per day certain number"" rule would work back up. rural areas vaccines always gonna slower. nationwide ""No masks recommended anywhere"" 70% vaccinated country. help ensure mandates go endlessly.

And I'm suggesting based I've read people know lot do. short subjects? kids? volunteer them? volunteer trials? ignorant hypocrite No, turns lot things told mild COVID affecting heart blood clots false. good reason keep wearing mask unless anxiety/mental health issue you.  long run, might cheaper state employers literally pay residents employees money get vaccinated. Poverty wide-spread state like Mississippi vaccine hesitancy. Try use carrot, boost numbers use stick (i.e. must vaccinated get Medicare/Medicaid, etc.). Yeah daughter yet able vaccinated I'm still careful.  soon everybody house vaxxed up, I'm going worried Measles Pertussis. 

I finally found comfy cute masks, though, probably come back cold season.  America terrible place. Coronavirus Trump painted picture vividly. Libertarian views like ones driving masks pushback work people around moronic sacks shit. even close call. No. No, got vaccinated. See get either. vaccines working beyond wildest dreams! things manufactured distributed every american less year! Covid going every day! celebrating unprecedented victory especially sub nooooo!

We science free fits instead locking even harder punishing done right thing beginning! got vaccinated moment became available.

Yeah lets punish folks anti vaxxers sit back laugh us! Murphy already extended another 30 days says let expire gets legislation wants combat virus give vaccines. Murphy lifting Memorial Day US kids died flu 2018-2019 season died Covid entire pandemic despite general death toll magnitudes higher Covid

Despite sub wants claim kids vaccination age insanely low risk, extent they're danger random accident COVID. glad everyone shares wife’s opinion would never pharmaceuticals vaccines approved use children. covid, entire chest especially left side heart pain ranged severe aching sharp piercing sensation yeah, “fell it.” also family history men dying heart disease smoker younger days, concerned. prove vaccinated? concerns me, idea unvaccinated folks freaking meltdowns stores want participate society, benefit number people unvaxxed immune catching + vaxxed likely many places. Hopefully safe hold without COVID restrictions. won’t Support claim citations COVID ability mutate new strain eventually. never herd immunity even miracle forced vaccinations US reaches 90% vaccination rates still international travel.  world never reach herd immunity vaccines last years.  need renewal covid go away completely, contagious. 

Herd immunity keep spreading far vaccined countries mean covid them.  isolated pockets.  Covid tests international travel yearly bi yearly covid vaccines likely going part life on. Yeah know, I'm ready set aside mask yet.

But question going breakthrough asymptomatic cases? remember reading somewhere people asymptomatic cases vaccine still winding blood clotting.

Edit: go downvoting me, I'd NEVER tell anyone get vaccine. tell dumbass coworkers get every time subject comes up. I'm asking question here. Maybe dumbass question, that's case feel free downvote. 5 months old, worry every transmissible disease got shot yet?  Also HV. seems lot us here! Fair. Also… 🐻⬇️ lack perspective. wasn’t big deal you. people allowed feel differently do. grow up, start realize things… losing protection. trading one protection another. masks, were, best 60% effective curbing spread everyone wore them. know are, I'm at, masks orders ignored back September compliance time low. Also Remember people wearing single layer fabric masks, N95s equivalent.

Now getting closer 60% eligible population vaccinated vaccines seem 95% better curbing spread. opened new cohort well, numbers keep rising.

So trading best 60% effective transmission stopper population using anyways 95% effective transmission stopper population using.

You gaining effectiveness, things better despite mask mandate ending.

For example. 80% local population uses masks, means spread reduced best 48%. exactly 50% population vaccine spread reduced 47.5% essentially identical, we'll 50% population sort immunity. Infact, 61% sort immunity right now. math number gets us 58% reduction spread.

So right better mask last summer mask.

I can't make decisions you, I'm parent children, offer advice. children still wear masks, indoor activities safer year. masking plus current vaccination rate would put Indoor activities within acceptable risk level me. like everything, risk assessment weigh children might lose. I've seen comment billion times yet one adds think would safe eyes. never get 100% vaccinated, ever. Masks can't last forever, never get zero covid 100% vaccinated what's tipping point then? people I've talked like working home always came similar conclusion... miss commute, miss spending least 1 hour get ready work cool work... appreciate 'effective' pay raise got use gas, repair wear tear getting new clothes, shoes, ties, haircuts on.

At end, lack social life work disliked work home.

 So, would case you?  Maybe that's cdc said masks early. Quit whining kid trial subject. wife open it, wait cdc makes things worse allows anti vaxxer, anti masker, covid deniers get lazy, selfish asses want. Canada likely pass America % people gotten least one dose next week.

I hope everyone ends gettiing jab! Hasn’t like.. year?  Inject ask people stay home 

Damn seem leading expert human medical trails. Nvm, one yeah, see technically small shred irony frame things specific way. Science saying caution unnecessary, COMMANDING MASK. I'm showing extra caution socially conscious decision look opportunistic anti-vaxxers/maskers, I'M IGNORING SCIENCE LIKE REPUBLICAN.

I totally see it, really do. value interpretation much do, see should. pregnant isn’t lot data women first trimester getting vaccine. vaccines usually encouraged (even flu shot) pregnant people compromised immune system temporarily need help get. got first shot 8 weeks, I’ll get second later week 11 weeks. concern fever (a possible side effect vaccine) really dangerous fetus first trimester. I’m anyway I’d rather take risk vaccine COVID; isn’t much data group people early pregnancy. Miscarriages common first trimester millions happen every year—I absolutely respect choose wait safer zone second third trimester. wanted share example group people may comfortable getting vaccine right away; higher risk severe COVID reactions infected. Crazy surprising American. Thank God work home completely optional whole time. Pretty much one office enjoyed working home. Everyone back office within weeks back since.

The people kids lasted like two days. Lol Part covid killed many sick, old people got it. get twice.

Those got covid vaccine likely breakthrough case, covid would way deadly them.

Those testing positive vaccination arent evenly distributed across population covid deaths were. They're highly skewed. President Biden joined push set aside patents Covid shots, entered roiling debate ensure poor countries get enough vaccine. COVID-1723 didn’t, said COVID mutates slower slow, completely different fact evidence COVID could EVER change enough new strain like flu annually COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, laboratory diagnosis. need consider clinical picture, epidemiological picture, lab result.

If every indicator COVID except positive test, it’s safe assume COVID. Sneetches get streetches. assaulted. People got shot it.  ""How check vaccine status"" subs new ""what variants?""

Man ain't truth! study centers still actively recruiting children vaccine trials placebo arms, call around find one, kid could get vaccine months early get paid so. Malaysia, Thailand Philippines fewer deaths would recorded normal year. article postulates could social distancing, feeling tourism probably plays bigger role, possibly crime.  never did. vast majority locations didn’t enforce policies. don’t blame them. don’t get paid nearly enough potentially assaulted douche bag trying make point believe mRNA means microchip RNA, gives body instructions produce microchips, assuming getting enough silicon diet. vaccines safe effective Jesus Christ stop spreading anti vax fear uncertainty doubt around vaccines. Awesome! US reach 60% adults least 1 dose early next week, hopefully momentum continues least 70% end june. mean anything, hospitalizations deaths.

A number long covid sufferers would like need vaccinate naturally immune people, count too.

Almost recovered covid folks know got vaccinated could get card. denying science CDC? way ends enough people taken chain transmission. three ways: vaccination, recovery, death.

I'd rather get vaccinated risk long-term disability death, I'm idiot (most time). know change vary business business, anyone know clause/provision suggestions indicates masks still required vaccine sites? Seems like oversight unvaccinated folks allowed remove masks place people also need go get protected situation, maybe discussed somewhere! now? makes think thousands accountants, engineers, software architect, managers, etc couldn’t step CEOs? something specific job think professionals can’t do? work CEOs every day lot experience draw on, know work load like responsible producing, I’m pretty confident assessment training anyone CEO. except people kids 12 Try sticking fridge arm instead. Way cooler (pardon pun). children primary driver community transmission

I think need broad asymptomatic testing order establish this. seen study. vaccine protects - like every vaccine throughout history. Unvaccinated people direct threat you.  story literally says never tested positive (and tested). read article, epidemiologists surveyed.

Also, appears immunity Pfizer superior natural immunity. vaccines, I'm sure. Actually wouldn’t. work CEO company every day probably much better idea day day work involved do, job likely much challenging don’t think judge me. Wow. know explain care people. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Got it. hey wanna say really valid. i’m used it’s gonna feel super weird. hopefully get used change! gonna take time, we’ll safe vaccine!  Absolutely right move Japan. worth take risks here.

Meanwhile Canada, let citizens PRs return India.

Well, technically, allowing people return 3rd country, 3rd country letting people India citizens residents 3rd country. Besides, Canada needs negative PCR test 3rd country. even transit another country last likely least 24-48 hours. makes impossible.

US, UK, EU, Middle East, Australia letting citizens PRs return India, Canadians can't return. Bummer habits hard break place gives Sinovac, Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Sputnik-V, J&amp;J, Pfizer, Moderna? unicorn country?

Don't get Sinovac Sinopharm another choice; they're better nothing, performed well trials. Sputnik-V depends well trust Russian clinical trials; they've reported great results lot people think they're fudging data. really trust them, say Sputnik's best vaccines... that's big ""if.""

If choice get vaccines immediately, first choice would probably Pfizer. Pfizer lot great real-world results Israel, Britain, US. Moderna (which got myself) another great choice. probably good Pfizer, Pfizer one got data-sharing agreement Israel, Moderna quite well studied. flip side, larger spacing doses (like Moderna has) might give longer-lasting immunity.

The wild card, though, J&amp;J clinical trial South Africa South African variant taking off, know real-world fact well variant - then, lab studies show Pfizer Moderna also well there. mean unvaccinated people infecting unvaccinated people. don’t know, that’s asked question honest, I'd personally shoot Moderna Pfizer happy either.

That's why. always politics people. we've seen society past 14 months?? Fuck no. would we? did...you read post replying to? Yes that’s good point. lives always risk. bad flu would put down. take precautions, shouldn’t keep restrictions unreasonably long time tiny group people. Right, personally need feel safe. Wait eat inside others, wait go back gym, skip friend's wedding, etc. complicated. One elderly vaxxed always going stop major threat. haven’t wearing beginning, first stop. someone lived Thailand knows culture reasonably well announcement likely enforced likely apply pressure anti vaxxers lot Thailand. political concerns rather genuine fear might die get unwanted side effects. prime minister also idiot publicly voiced fears getting vaccine dragged clinic. Even public think faked relieve political pressure. 
Also Facebook heavily used Thailand course goes misinformation spread non english language harder detect suppress therefore allowed run free.
Thailand right thing eventually, may take effort persuade fearful best thing success vaccination bringing rest world. 
It take year Thailand get vaccinated government incompetent. Right calls private sector import vaccines vaccinate anyone prepared pay quickly vaccinate city folk government focus poorer rural areas. Currently behind scenes dealings going allow private sector vaccinations everyone getting cut go ahead. Wait seriously? That’s unbelievable. smoke cigars steakhouse Mississippi?!? nothing approved yet 5 year old, he’ll wait least fall. Vaccines vary country, answer depends live. US, two mRNA vaccines basically equivalent efficacy, effective J&amp;J, though even one protects well severe disease death. I’d choice though, would chosen Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna—shots 3 weeks apart instead 4, you’re done week quicker, slightly lower chance side effects, bit commonly studied it’s used places around world far.

Live Da Nang since Jul 2019. war struggle Covid-19 ""We shall overcome"" bad, meant, science clear: want take off, can. 

If want to, that's also OK. personal decision now.  sub authoritarian sometimes. Watch downvote too.

Note I'm first shot, get second shot 19 days. safe. target safe place expect certain quality from, products public image. mainstream drop mask policy anyone waits target seen conservative average. (not politically conservative) asked another thread thought I’d ask too, 

I compromised immune system believe cdc guidelines suggest mask regardless , anyone concerned vaccine resistant strain mutation we’re hasty lifting restrictions . know they’re suspending patents (or whatever terminology is) countries start vaccine . it’ll bit reach vaccination global scale biggest relief vaccines given freedom caring people do. 

After 14 months watch everyone else, it’s nice go back giving fuck. coworker mine doesn’t want minor children getting vaccine it. think she’s even swayed 19 year old son well. 

She COVID January very, sick kids never got it. madness! going check people vaxxed? thank - keep masks experiences obviously going anecdotal, tell one person entire office continued work home long could have. one. completely optional, one pressured.

None us set schedule - come go please long duties fulfilled. interpreted joke fact u/hatemakingnames1 replaced y’s i’s (Pennsilvania, Mariland) sure? second dose, voices kept telling buy Microsoft products. Let people want. I’m wearing mask high risk friends family members. 

No need worry someone else doing. doesn’t hurt you. “May be” Throw evidence folks. guy calling bullshit. I’m anti-social, Holy shit! Live let live people, FFS. Maybe I'm missing something, really answer question. understand direct health risk children contracting COVID negligible, also understand life managing risk. question long-term risks letting virus spread uncontrolled among children.

I know one big arguments sending vaccines every country we're worried new strain could develop current vaccines effective against. really get people applying logic children - transmission lower children already tend asymptomatic? risk relatively low community spread among children cause dangerous new strain? Also, appears immunity Pfizer superior natural immunity. 

That's good know both. can't believe pointed lmao Anything discuss problems :P  always tough early adopter change socially enforced convention. 

Similar weird one first people wear masks, considered weird one first abandon them. 

But science clear. vaccinated, time take off. people wear mask shutdown. 

It really annoys people try make masks somehow equivalent allowed leave house several weeks months. 7 counties CA higher GDP entire state Mississippi. isn’t thing exactly, closest parallel we’re going spanish flu, pittered without vaccine. lot ppl died back then, fact world rebounded spanish flu without vaccine gives hope we’ll good something close 70% vaccination rate, believe get to. takes start unmasking give others feeling OK start too. props you. elderly neighbor, widower, lives alone. main thing sits inside starbucks reads paper every single day. Yes, do. update knowledge catch science. That's trial established baseline controlled quality tests. remember back last year, commercial antibody tests low prevelence absolutely useless. sending back positives viruses entirely creating misleading picture disease spread. danger. 

Here, one created baseline vaccine. Even N/S distinction true, *vast* majority people test positive natural infection would caught prior vaccination. ~ 20% population infected. Compared number breakthrough infections - already believed big - microscopic. ongoing *unvaccinated* infections tiny fraction pandemic total. 

FWIW body treats prior natural infection shot, that's clear vaccinating people known past COVID. u/Lyrrad0 Shows peoples' priorities are, it? I'm going mask longer work sure. I've wearing one hours day year hard. That's unfortunate lol rough coincidence. .its better company used named Isis... hunch Target came pretty early ""still masks"" subsequently followed important competitors saying masks required vaccine. suspect, hope, they'll join unmasking.

I totally appreciate may side fence respect that; ready get Summer vaccinated.  Really? people prefer hear   Even Illinois going completely normal vaccinated (ie. everyone) June 11th. Dewine amended lifted mask requirement vaccinated people now, CDC announcement. mask mandate unvaccinated people ends June Hard laugh vent shoved throat though lot people going find soon enough. Imo, issues insane ones chosen largely (80%?) secretly anti-abortion issue. heard vaccines tested cloned cells stem cells aborted fetuses 30 years ago believe vaccines spiritally tainted.

There's rhyme reason issues raised. ""trusted"" community figure spouts utter nonsense, even better sounds dire hard prove, people arm fake outrage really want vaccine want sound like religious nut. I’m literally quoting data. People seem forgotten majority infections covid19 were/are asymptomatic, studies theorizing immunogenicity vaccines based ability mitigate symptoms doesn’t make sense *if can’t observe signs/symptoms first place*, qualitative/observational selling point doesn’t actually address issues. must ok others. getting vaccinated. 

No long-term studies long term ailments. 

So you’re antivaxxer who’ve already caught COVID, tested positive antibodies, also 98%+ chance hospitalized? take vaccine? remember correctly, Bahrain uses various vaccines (Pfizer, Astra, Sinopharm), though I'm clear proportion..
 
the one mostly uses Sinopharm UAE.. Tell mask up. evidence children risk serious health issues virus. Zero risk never going happen. right now, we’re approaching seasonal influenza levels risk, acceptable pretty much everybody last 100 years. want wear eight masks hamster ball, knock out, we’re going stop you, enough people okay current risk rest country going move on. realize reddit representative reality, right? Otherwise we've President Paul 2012, President Sanders 2016 2020, right? Conservatives would control like two district seats Congress, video games like Dark Souls knows what's popular would super important part world, one would use dollars instead version crypto, etc.  going “no, number made up” slap fight; please provide sources judges score fairly. Thanks. People saying never stepped red area lives experts Republican anti-vaxxers time. red part Reddit's favorite whipping boy state, Florida, almost everyone wore masks grocery stores, one wore masks outside it. wonder Publix looks like now... tell wear masks stay away others possibly home. ??? talking now? right sub? Unrealistic expect 85% Wait, did? When? think it’ll take behaviors change. Specially city mask wearing wasn’t issue, it’ll take everyone change behaviors suddenly drop mask. 

My prediction June 15 deadline met, people California start drop mask. comes daughter's health, care everything health related including long term ailments. live least 90 yrs im going mess uniformed parent. Yeah

I totally see lot vaccinated people choosing shop place make mask go wear it.

So getting lead changing rules could result decrease traffic lot chains still making everyone mask wrong grandfather jailed jaw broken one guards. managed escape killed DEA tried flee Mexico plane full cocaine. 

Heard cuisine pretty good though.

Edit: replied wrong comment. bad  8 fully vaccinated Yankees testing positive sounds bit much then, right? Based statement, saying would .04% chance one fully vaccinated Yankee staff/player testing positive? would chances 8? things kept happening restrictions (only slightly less so) it’s government support less fortunate lower class meantime. Clearly couldn’t allowed continue giving poor people money evil need “get lazy asses back slave labor” wrong, incredibly wrong. 

Just take 5 seconds look sub see links tons studies continue show vaccines incredibly effective preventing infection, even breakthrough infections ability spread others EVEN LOWER. major study posted yesterday reenforced this, helped CDC come decision guidance. 

The reported breakthrough infection rate .009% vaccinated individuals. Please stop spreading nonsense misleading largely incorrect. Yeah, problem (as saw India) it’s easy go celebratory screwed within space four weeks. science vaccinated people fine good crowd think unvaccinated individual take masks go life celebrating bars uncertain. CDC cannot science people play honor system feels good, model. negative consequences, any, won’t seen two weeks uptick six weeks impacted hospitals. CDC may even gambling modest uptick drive us 80 percent vaccination rate that’s takes. 

IMO context big city, waiting two weeks lifting mask mandate makes lot sense. states showing uptick follow suit increase freedoms. signs trouble lot cover holding steady two weeks may avert surge. asking you, I'm glad, feels nice. That's true live near CHOP wore masks camera there. People sleeping Portland months. wearing masks 24 hours.

They legitimately studies protests. look up. note even without masks, spread. really hope point. Id curious comparison NH VT. Similar demographics (White, educated) different politics freedoms NH. kidding. Someone would offer lot money leave flexibility. mean lot. Eh, I'm going stop going hit higher vaccination rate. Since getting vaccinated taken couple long weekends hotels go back going stores, live Georgia.

Over past year people proven actively would prefer kill everyone around them, know can't trust them. Or, bear here, unlike you, I'll acknowledge made mistake fix it. ""anti-science, emotional"" way, guess.

I wish could make go talk one parents 287 dead kids.

Now see there. creating another straw man. version going pick arbitrary, nonscientific point people wear masks more.

Your problem is, argument made, that's argument made me. someone creates argument suit narrative. someone address problem hand.

You answer okay kids die put little cloth face, make shit think I'm saying I'm not, persuade people thing kill kids.

So who's monster?  Where’s death rates young kids?What death rates kids flu everyday risks? 

Having symptom doesn’t show necessity lock and/or wear masks people don’t even wear correctly super porous. 

Stop anti science 1. risk lives others lives every day 

2. rest comment blatantly incorrect  guess he's talking adults only.  seriously this? Chill out, dude. Nope, even spec trust daily thread always ""most"" rational, although sometimes gets *too* optimistic (and I'm optimist). regular threads, like this, get pessimistic normal people are. hits /r/all? Shit, that's stereotypical redditors come get ***real*** pessimistic. 

I could speculate why, kinda long story, think. Long story short: redditors predisposed hating real world wish different, things going ""back normal"" scare them. mean piercing generally removable. 1. You’ll provide evidence third cases fully vaccinated 

2. vast majority UK’s vaccine rollout used AZ it’s highly effective. Again, Seychelles isn’t applicable due heavy use Sinopharm approved western countries.

The US learn nothing Seychelles, except maybe Sinopharm subpar vaccine (which isn’t relevant US). learn Israel UK.

J&amp;J topic discussion, vaccine lower efficacy. There’s need apply data mRNA vaccines J&amp;J vaccine since already ample data it. You’re allowed lie point fraud. Also, difficult prove beyond reasonable doubt (the criminal standard US law) someone genuinely believe something. Actually running circles around you, paying attention prefer hear pontificate. 

The reported breakthrough rate among vaccinated individuals .009% percent right now. Masks vaccinated individuals necessary low risk profile. 

You keep throwing hypotheticals, fear mongering, science CLEAR here. masks coming little (or even Baker) point. question gets board tries stand way. Either way CDC federal government opened gates. capitalism? agrarian society from

But saying no, perpetuity reopen parts ""have proved"" they're ""low risk""? lowest single case day US since last summer, 0% people vaccinated 56% people age 12 least one shot. need ""prove"" bars exist? funerals happen person? What's metric? nothing personally; wearing mask would accomplish little disease transmission standpoint. point overall effect changing policy. #1 here. Getting vaccine 4 June. really got TBH. I'll still likely end last unmask choice told retailer remove maybe late summer beyond let alarmism really get last 14 months. yet sure feel comfortable indoors public sans mask.

Yep, sums kind clearly empathetic caring person are. Make sure don’t go “accidentally” coughing people next time say don’t need wear mask cuz you’re “totally vaccinated” everyone get vaccinated, people though people legit can't get vaccinated medical reasons True, capitalism always money people. That’s inevitably it’s disheartening see people realizing system needs change 662 non-covid. don’t want 0 deaths, you’re also cool certain number dead kids ultimately you’ll pick arbitrary, nonscientific point don’t want masks anymore. Monster. Oxford-AstraZeneca approved western countries. addition Sinopharm, also using AstraZeneca (it goes different name there: Covishield). third current cases fully vaccinated. cases among unvaccinated. 60% population vaccinated cases ever. U.S. less 50% vaccinated. 

The research success mRNA vaccines readily applied J&amp;J (e.g. Yankees also lack real world studies J&amp;J compared mRNA vaccines). 


There similarities U.S. Seychelles. discuss U.S. consider regard? ability come go tremendous. Actually, I’m biologist who’s involved running clinical trials backgrounds virology/epidemiology. 

And dick keep sprouting nonsense obfuscating data

And congratulerions, linked 3 opinion pieces single study Lua Dua Kee? independence wasn’t uncontroversial say least. It’s almost different people varying opinions here. ,, go, dropped these. Wait, actually saying bond people working project really matter?

Also, lots people work home second half fiscal year, I'd say comparable. firms first bring people back take advantage, ones suffer people reddit love working home complain laid year now. Uhh literally 14 months waited 85-90 percent 65 plus vaccinated. putting people first? balance cost benefit teetering towards commerce. Get Vaxxed can. let fate sort rest. 

Also check studies Israel well control cases even 50%   acquaintances drove Nevada get bit earlier. agree that, right, people driven much get shot. Still vastly better vaccine all. I'm Arizona governor lifted mask mandate schools 3 weeks ago, letting school districts decide. districts made masks optional outbreaks (duh...). One districts, Prescott USD, many kids quarantine reinstate mask mandate. correlation people voted? medical community disagrees you. choose believing experts CDC, I’m choosing CDC. They’ve seen data clearly shows vaccinated adults low risk. Get dude. opinion basis scientific fact. fact, kid probably coming bar anyone. COVID, bars generally good places kids age twelve. Yes like insinuation.  Agreed, there’s lot complexity nuance. understand risk hospitalization death children low (and context, I'm biomedical scientist works pharma, uninformed assessment). I'd still prefer get it, especially since degree long Covid (symptoms persisting 120 days) observed approximately half pediatric cases: realize they’re trying do, think we’re putting safety people human lives first like Turned passed sight needle. returning normal though, it’s time adapt. county 57% first dose.

(not) actually dont pose risk children. COVID literally nothingburger kids. less 1 6000 hospitilization less 1 8000 death rate. kids likely die car crash way Wal-Mart catch covid die it. commonality seem see people safe, they're ready say ""Fuck everyone else."" get back feeling normal.

There course, many, many exceptions, ton ""Let's hold line one beat together."" friends who, minute vaccinated, forgot everyone still waiting risk entirely.

Or worse, ""internet logic"" shit pick narrative use desires justify it. ""I want walk around without mask, clearly everyone risk someone deserves it."" ""What kids?"" ""Kids low risk, pffft!"" ""What kid scars lungs rest life?"" Long silence. ""Life's full risks, buddy! Get helmet!""

Which easy say heard someone loaded ambulance struggling breathe. Then, less so. It’s though, people still getting it. I’m saying completely stop, continue necessary distancing rules implemented reopen parts society/business proved implemented changes make low risk spreading covid. it’s inconvenient doesn’t mean shouldn’t consider safety risk used trust fellow Americans

Awww did? required wear masks school majority kids symptoms COVID presents low risk kids, kids could still contaminate others. That’s required wear masks. Now, present risk vaccinated adults. didn’t people get vaccine/wear mask/stay home? store lmao Putting appointments fee clinics Walmart would go along way. can’t assume everyone online. No, Netherlands still needs AZ doses right now. Definitely sending AZ, likely Pfizer. according they're 60% adults first doses higher seen elsewhere. that's true they're better.

Even still I'm using Canada comparison - Canada passed 50% adults getting first dose earlier week **way** behind US terms started vaccinations. Given like 1/9 population, still. big difference US number weeks enough shots available anybody wants one. Ontario (the populous province Canada), vaccines still available anybody 40 except hotspots (it expands 30+ Monday 18+ May 24).

In US they're currently dealing problem wind vaccination operations low demand, they're reluctant wind much makes access difficult try convince people get vaccinated. May exurban/rural TX county. county officials told residents local business owners last spring summer consider Covid precautions strictly voluntary state mandates would enforced within county. Masks always optional public place local businesses given right choose whether require masks property not. never stopped church services, local festivals, indoor performances, dine-in restaurants, mask free shopping. fully vaccinated rate around 30%. care. never planned getting vaccinated never wore masks unless absolutely get it. message local authorities take whatever precautions feel necessary strictly personal individual business owners' choice. pro mask I’m pro vaccine, full Pfizer. aren’t gonna mandate it, there’s nothing do.

It’s widely available everyone get it, also going drop masks point. Like want keep wearing one, go ahead that’s choice, think lot people follow CDC ditch mask next weeks. living isn’t incentive, idk is. No, don't. know many people sadly anti vaxxer, gave anti maskers well. I'll keep wearing mask till kids fully vaccinated, kids work fully vaccinated. valid way write number Dutch language parents 70 got Sinovac shots felt nothing. soreness shot site first days. new mask guidance relies honor system.

So basically work. bigger problems...... quarantined 4 times, covid twice. used ton saved sick time quarantined sick......It called worked, paid assumed expendable since day one pandemic. We're sending stroopwafels, we're sending vaccines.

No stroopwafels you! Getting run bus that! using AZ Italy lot.  Well... least promoting [losing weight mean america whole- similar finding ""average"" something. They've made clear (most professionals) low-risk area 80% vaccinated would pretty safe. idea that, lumping locations one whole, means take time. 

This state actually giving damn covid making decisions regarding whether want fully implement CDC recommendations wait till cases go vaccinations go up. 

They fear mongering, message somewhat unclear essentially blanketed statement. Actually, comparing VT MS obesity rates would get nearly result. MS highest rate, VT fifth lowest. AZ isnt possible since Netherlands restricted 60 only. would political nightmare send AZ, would equivalent telling 'you guys important, vaccins unsafe people'

But importantly Netherlands still needs AZ second shot population.

Most likely choosing vaccin send purely practical grounds. one-shot Jansen might practical send.

It might also practical send Pfizer. Sending one type vaccin reduces logistics involved, could smart move Yeah, get either. opinion everyone mask nobody mask. complicates things. We're quite yet, especially 12-15 year olds eligible vaccines. Seems another 6-8 weeks would appropriate. bad... Somebody get jab County. There's places people refusing get shot somehow political statement w/e It’s 24h. people shopping Walmart’s required. masks required Walmart I’m willing stake money solid amount people taking shopping elsewhere. People shop feel safe. 

If don’t believe go check Trader Joe’s thread let know overall sentiment looks like. fact stores real way verifying vaccinated makes taking bad idea. move mostly achieving herd immunity amongst anti-maskers. 80% 5 weeks plummeting.   Adults .04% chance testing positive vaccination

Source? wow sub they’re petitioning mask mandate put back place  guy lifts off. efficacy rate (~95%) held up. That's different .04% number. 1% vaccinated adults trial got virus, 20% unvaccinated adults did, efficacy would still 95%. .004% vaccinated adults trial got virus, .8% unvaccinated adults did, efficacy would still 95%. That's 95% efficacy still hold .04% number can't.

I agree rest said, gripe simply usage .04% number. question, though. point feel risk acceptable?   I'm fully vaccinated, give fucks wearing mask. store requires it, I'll wear one otherwise I'm fucking done it.

""Trust CDC"" fucking OK I'm trusting them. India? wear save children's lives

Will it, though? science doesnt really seem support this. positivity rate 1%, uncontrolled spread longer occurring. Combined vaccination rates mentioned, makes incredibly difficult active virus find, let alone transmit enough new, vulnerable hosts period contagion ends. makes odds new uncontrolled outbreaks INCREDIBLY low. US reported covid mortality rate 0.00%-0.03% 44 states reporting, plus PR. less 2019 flu mortality rate children, vaccines available everyone 6 months older flu. science really overwhelmingly showing negative covid-19 outcomes heavily skewed age towards elderly. risks children incredibly, incredibly small. 

There comes point balance struck continue encouraging people get vaccinated. extreme low positivity rates high vaccination rates, hard convince holdouts vaccines really work continue ask fully protected keep masking, social distancing, etc even science doesnt support need so. Whatever, nurses’ union bunch bureaucrats. epidemiologists like CDC. feel bad went eat large ass Wendys J&amp;J shot :( Eligible Americans matters. They’re Canada due shortages. I’m states. issues here. Hey goofy, poster said kids would still wear masks could get vaccine (which soon). 

Believe not, kids handle masks pretty well don’t care politics... don’t pretend it’s miserable wear one gas station. 

Chill. Deaths arent thing though. long term health effects covid give them. need certain amount velocity maintain orbit. earth's gravity low earth orbit much weaker ground, zero velocity fall back earth like rock, got lot lateral velocity still falling like rock....but *miss* earth fall, that's orbit. 

if take pole, got zero pre-existing lateral velocity steal earth's rotation. take equator, already got lot lateral velocity, virtue earth's rotation, means need less energy attain velocity need maintain orbit, use less fuel, carry payload vehicle. We're half way generation time since work home became realistic. predict next 10 years WFH continue rise.

Yeah dude, interpersonal relationships literally tens thousands years history change 15 Both. kind weeks pre post covid.

oh 15 months data says otherwise. I'll first admit I'm wrong end laid next year replaced hot shot extrovert anything get ahead, even commute. horror.

You competing companies also stay home. cream rises top. sure would be. I'm acting data metrics, interested ""vibing"" team extroverts ""it's fun"" work person.

So data says people better interpersonal relationships better means nothing you? That's interesting lol

Are gamer? send vaccines St. Maarten? vaccines?  Noupe  basically everyone. think agree then? equator ""widest"" part planet (the furthest away axis rotation), moves fastest Earth spins. gives rockets launched direction Earths' spin (eastwards) extra speed boost saves bunch fuel. .........like Death consequence, long-term health issues must also considered. thought said “700” first, like “Hmm. feel like 700 adults.” vents? didnt discover early vents worse thing do??? found vents majority cause early C19 patient deaths. Oh yeah mean life threatening, still sucks AFIAK Walgreens rescinded mask policy. Cellphones essentially required modern world even simple flip phones tracked. call voluntary phone. far know Seychelles variants known evade vaccine induced immunity. high prevalence B.1.135 (which isn’t) government would likely pulled AZ too. There’s indicating AZ would effective Seychelles. 

Again, neither  Yes missing minuscule “o” grammar akin type lapse COVID fear hype children contracting harmless virus (to them). What’s mortality rate children? Last checked almost nonexistent. said certainty Seychelles situation entirely due Sinopham, AstraZeneca questioned South Africa. I'm disputing that.

I'm saying low risk risk, wearing mask substantial inconvenience anyone. all. Especially saves lives.

There harm continuing wear months.

There harm wearing them, even harm minimal.

If harm continuing wear them, continuing wear save children's lives, ""Because hate masks."" terrible reason stop. isnt 166 test per case high.

166 test per case per day high. 166 test per case 1 year not.

HK 12000 cases 14M test.

Taiwan 1200 cases 560k. better ratio? TIL Brazil shares border France therefore European Union ? Tell much manual labor life without telling much manual labor life Went two stores tonight without mask, including Wal-Mart.

It felt weird 14 months, also felt oddly freeing taking first step religiously masking long. You’re good every variant. It’s massively different. NH 60% least one shot, number 4 country. VT likely eek percentage points NH, New England chance achieving sort regional herd immunity. Im LA went bakersfield get first shot still tough get LA. Got second shot month later here. They're ideal, they're also significant at-risk protected. Hospitals safe overwhelmed vaccinated population continues grow. Basically people worrying something largely matter anymore. kefir would make lips glow:) make luciferase express binding hACE2 inserted lactobacillus cell membrane, spike. lactobacillus sets shop, glow start shedding virus - asymptomatic - helping us get people quarantine faster. think way earth spinning. already travelling like, 30,000 kilometres per hour equator add rocket thus using less fuel. escape gravity well... think.... Whereas closer poles travelling quickly. ..... think.  fuck cares either? quite scared covid always wore N95 vaccinated. 95% effective vaccine like anyone else US wanted it. reason worried anymore. Different clientele say Walmart example. Either way yeah think people changing coming weeks. neither relevant topic  covid killed nearly twice amount kids flu, right? flu vaccines readily available adults **and** kids, right? antivirals chronic, potentially life threatening cases flu? antivirals shown **not** work great covid?

So... part concerns scream “anti-science” you?

And many, many children suffer long-term, life-altering effects covid infection? MIS-C, etc.

This isn’t emotional—it simply advocating children may able advocate themselves. primary role parent. variant shown able meaningfully evade immunity, seeing convergent evolution variants.

“Epidemiologists”, mean read NYT article talking opinions *some* epidemiologists right? 

Ya, pulled ass destined endemic like flu one UK's health experts even said earlier year would learn live certain level hospitalizations/deaths move country-by-country vaccination levels rose enough protect people prevent epidemic surges Cdc medical community. led political hack... smarter 99.9% medical community say mrna simple safe amazing beach through. training education everyone dies chose getting shot, fuck em Nice. sounds lot better personal reports I've heard family friends took mRNA J&amp;J.

Yup, may chance participate trial (they city) thought second-rate better Pfizer/Moderna. confidence Novavax. wish delayed. 

They happen tell going available general public US? Americans hell year. It’s good see least start return normalcy. still lingering fear new variant could emerge among unvaccinated set us back, including fully vaccinated. didn't... lol asked funny... answered you. mandatory masks PA. non-enforceable governor order wear masks, ignore. wore masks beginning. got vaccinated soon could. virtually risk getting severe covid spreading covid. asthma wearing mask isn’t always easy responsibility. going continue wearing shit reason so. people want wear don’t care, science says able move freely without mask people demand stay masked aren’t following science. following feelings don’t care people’s feelings already safe know someone went Disney today unvaccinated Covid 8 days ago. Wasn’t wearing mask. God bless America  doesnt amtter, since shots 95% variants.  you? Consider vote politicans support right work.. Remember november, get vote highest rates childhood vaccinations don’t personal belief religious exemptions allowed, unlike states. medically necessary exceptions made. 

Mississippi West Virginia two states strict rules years. NY, ME, CA recently joined gotten rid personal belief religious exemptions vaccines. mention walking alone? lot people know choose get vaccinated fear safety vaccines, selfishness indifference.

I always reply vaccinate POTUS ex-POTUS, it’s safe. course conspiracy theorist told didn’t really inject Biden Trump actual vaccine, probably saline solution. give people.  ""The weatherman said there's 1% chance rain today, I'm going stay tunnel anyway. never safe!""

&amp;#x200B;

*Thomas never seen bullshit before.* end day vaccinated matter many unvaccinated people around you... spreading virus gonna get sick them.

Getting vaccinated greatly reduces chance getting COVID. eliminate chance getting COVID. huge reservoir unvaccinated people interact still non-negligible chance getting sick. really think ending mask rules trusting americans right thing, all.
I think assuming anti mask/anti vaxers right thing, forcing vaccine hesitant hurry get vaxed basically accelerating herd immunity among everyone ever get vaxed. risky move point... sigh. really know else could do, keep waiting something end that's never going to. almost like CDC personnel changed Presidents... think completely reasonable wear masks another couple months majority fully vaxxed. see big ask. Well damn, guess expert then. entering assumption immediate future go store see someone mask vaccinated, see someone without mask vaccinated. Uhhhhh ya think true. airborne = N95 masks nurses doctors prepared for. wrong stupid. Science GOOD. people special circumstances going wait pandemic longer everyone else instead freaking unvaccinated people lying.  air restaurant circulates everyone get sick one person sick unless good ventilation... matter 100 feet away nearest person. (By everyone mean unvaccinated people obviously) everyone lives part country that’s high risk. 

We aren’t gonna reach ideals levels vaccination. Everyone knows that. far understand, herd immunity long way coming. new CDC guidelines suck cannot vaccinated, thus risk. rest vaccinated folk, much longer wait easing back normalcy? Especially risk contracting 5%. There’s got incentive taking vaccine, think that’s part CDC announced change. Shure lie religious medical mask exceptions. say dropping mask mandate caused decrease cases. Texas' cases dropped *despite* mask mandate, indicating mask mandate unnecessary point time states Weird! I'm vaccinated, still wear mask, STILL LIFE. Fucking spare me, dude. CDC led Robert Redfield disappointing CDC. Rochelle Walensky thoughtful, science-driven physician whole lot trust handling pandemic.  source claim?  Pretty much like expat then? Even vaccinated people catching virus based I've seen cousins. Idk fully vaccinated everyone one dose got sick want spread people can't vaccinated whatever reason, like best friend severe anaphylactic reactions vaccines gets would supervision allergists. Imo selfish focus gonna get sick I’d add Canada Europe list well, yeah. really highlights difference privileged countries others. Maybe care unvaccinated people infecting other? right. Luckily, free follow guidance.  Nobody stop wearing mask. live somewhere there's mask mandate. still people choose mask others don't. We're still vaccinating 2M people day. Clearly still people want it'd 0. goes eligible. really matter though. get sick get sick stupidity now. Yep work retail store assistant manager works 40 hours week top school moment pull away walk ins available near store. Though I'm vaccinated want put danger spreading it. they’ll keep extending end date mask mandates another year, another year, another year, we’re never going reach scientific ideal vaccine compliance, know it, us vaccinated effectively confined wearing masks rest lives. 

It time people sleep beds made. trying start anything, want suggest alternate viewpoint — think fact people still see taking steps protect others punishment big part problem, reason things got bad did. 

As teacher works kids (in person school year) sides 12 year age minimum, fully expect continue wear mask students least opportunity vaccinated. protects them, since unvaccinated, seems like least do. Vaccines protect 95% time (although mean illness less severe basically 100% time). 

We need vast majority vaccinated virus cannot spread, that’s herd immunity. vaccine clinical trial subject, masker, “covid real” person, would say this

1. people going lie

2. policy incentivizes people

3. won’t vaccinate can’t vaccinate. change time. 

The question dropping mask good point terms balancing number covid cases there, early enough incentivize potential hold outs impact vaccine numbers (incentive diminishes covid numbers approaches zero)  220 people. $3200 per person.

That's... terribly helpful. instead knock larger chunk smaller amount people?   Well that's something deal happens. mRNA technology could probably booster available well variant became widespread. 

No sense getting worried theoretical. current pandemic ending soon US that's something happy about.  also impacts kids age 12-15 since none considered fully vaccinated another 4.5 weeks. netherland people. That's great hear, better. Wealthy nations responsibility ensure everyone world quickly vaccinated. Disasters often hurt already struggling best interest end global pandemic soon possible. need solidarity cooperation combat mess. someone who’s fully vaccinated, would care whether conspiracy theorists wearing masks not? Yes! seems that, like rest us, CDC grown tired whole thing basically said ""fuck whatever want, going anyway"" Yeah, started bleeding couple days first Pfizer, even though I’ve BC year haven’t period entire time. already heard wasn’t freaked anything, find interesting anything lol.  would matter country’s COVID policy based deaths hospitalisations, U.S.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Almost people get first dose end getting second, really anything worried about. uneducated morons moral compass never wearing masks begin with. What’s point? Yep joked Venn diagram people lying vaccines wearing masks correctly circle.  Thank information, that's interesting. I'm Netherlands, AZ playing important role here. Heck, they’re willing pay money fake card instead getting FREE vaccine. fuckers idiots voting power. Lots nurses gotten vaccine yet I'm going trust say Same, I’m giving week two. there’s bump whatsoever, I’m done masking covid, I’ll cold flu season. 


If there’s slight increase cases, I’ll follow social cues types people ditching masks (read eyes). it’s idiots selfish assholes, mask stays on, people seem top things without masks, probably same.   [The accurate picture state USA I've Dutch intern mean context?   Went baseball game yesterday. Probably 90% people weren’t wearing masks. Felt amazing weird. lot probably weren’t vaccinated doesn’t matter me. always stopgap measure vaccine came along

37% country fully vaccinated. mention live area considered ""very high risk"". Logic indicates masks stay people vaccinated. anti-masker type last person expect telling truth. Selfish people tell self-serving ‘truths.‘ careful saying that. pointed yesterday, accused hating children. short, Dutch still butthurt history..... Well sound like hypocrite can't say anything USA occupation native American nation Australian treat Aborigin colonization.... least Indonesia Papuan go school get treated slave, Netherlands tell history books hide younger generation Opa Oma slaved Indonesian 350 years ""colonization"" absolutely agree, dont know ur getting downvoted this. vaccines seem effective beyond 6 months, problem simply know long vaccines effective. That’s EU made sure enough supply booster shots 2022 2023. It’s like “emotional support animal” certificates buy. Meaningless bits paper use browbeat anyone asks something don’t want to. It’s premature people fully vaccinated. I’m curious see happens unvaccinated people though. Dutch among brutal colonizers places world, like Indonesia, never got story Dutch Guyana though. put car occasionally. necessary risk.
Allowing maskless shopping people scared get vaccinated necessary risk. possible we'll need every year, alright, I'd like see data indicating protective effect wanes short period.   Form support group companies stores called ""Isis."" (Egyptian goddess, anyone remembers!) Maybe Corona Beer Co send refreshments. Yeah reason western countries already ordering like 5 times vaccination doses citizens. general expectation seems virus become endemic least circulate years antibody levels strongly decline 6 months year. might make booster shots necessary, maybe yearly, least vulnerable people. also companies working combination flu vaccine.   Life death / severe long term side effects incentive enough. person vaccinated, care. worry risks unwashed masses take themselves?  infections spreading Asia working say least. Yeah leading scientists top health organizations deemed community spread dropped sufficiently low level... covid isn’t bad children...   Idk data Belgium already said possible / likely people need booster shots already starting December ‘21. 22 doesn’t seem off. Tell Cuomo lifted outdoor mandate people working...

Oh...right...you can’t...  will/can squish quickly.  forever, kids get vaccinated and/or community spread drops sufficiently low levels. Children still very, low risk Covid. nothing stops vaccinated people continuing wear masks state vast majority people still do. think CDC didn’t account made new recommendations? guys even watched show?! sucks lot, definitely understand still coming bad outbreak. There's something dementia patients losing control ability swallow. Patients getting pneumonia food liquids going lungs fairly common thing. they're losing muscle control/tone there, maybe that's ventilating difficult? Doctors really treat covid, that's problem. lucky doctor that's actually ball covid. Long covid treated.  Hahahaha…. probably educated state, along best healthcare country, definitely helps high vaccination rates. rural areas Midwest Georgia higher population mortality New York City. line thought rurals mistake. even miniscule population vaccinated still hospitalized, seem logical slightly larger number vaccinated people would carrying virus asymptomatically/with mild symptoms able transmit virus?

""Vaccinated transmission low"" good enough say ""you need wear mask anymore."" going go around making policies assume vaccinated people non-infective, *is* good health policy.

Unless think CDC winging it. needs someone willing give carrot wield stick. Yeah, considering US still allowing travel outside county, bound wind here. cuts restrictions nerve wracking still go work daily mess. Except flu vaccines effective, flu still dangerous covid regardless vaccination kids. 


Taking vitamin effective flu vaccine. results two studies suggests vitamin may almost 6 times effective preventing influenza vaccination.* wtf? I've backpacking backcountry since March 2020. Last thing remember, Fauci told masks work. Roosevelts need good news! science says vaccines work. you’re vaxed wearing mask you’re empathy, narcissism, overly scared. I'm thinking gets pushed forward long safety data remains clean mRNAs. 12-16 trial one vaccine group get sick fluke; immune responses robust metrics adults. definitely screwed. Sure, really Motivation doesn’t make difference can’t get vaccine.

FFS, people entirely forgotten kids exist? problem still shit-load unvaccinated people, many also stop wearing masks there's mandate social pressure so. pose little risk me, would certainly pose risk children. way knowing every random stranger encounter vaccinated, I'm going chance it, family simply avoid lot indoor locations foreseeable future. might joke. 1 3 people know dying long nobody tells do.

Yeah definitely joke. exactly well. I’m basically seeing small group friends don’t kids aren’t still staying home time. I’ve fully immunized almost two months, exception couple family gatherings fully-vaxxed family, life pretty much previous year. can’t decide everything going normal; pandemic won’t “over” people care like decide is. truly hilarious.

The number individuals vaccinated hospitalized several fold less 1%. 

In-fact, il let secret. efficacy mRNA vaccines preventing asymptomatic infection (aka transmission) upwards 80% *one* dose (90%+ two doses).

Again, stop making stuff up. know thinking thing. would determine who’s vaccinated not? easily lie. naturally acquired immunity lasts longer vaccine spread others they're vaccinated?  1% hundreds thousands millions hospitalizations appreciable number vaccinated people strutting bars licking peoples faces. dad situation mom. fun situation in. feel ya, wish mother best health. I’m worried you. I’m worried people aren’t vaccinated begrudgingly wore masks lying ditching entirely, infecting asthmatic three year old who’s already hospitalized viral infection.

Science says it’s safe vaccinated people ditch masks. Public policy says there’s way tell vaccinated unvaccinated, certain subset population qualms lying teeth vaccinated, either vaxxed people wear masks unvaxxed don’t. Hard disagree. government agency tells boldface lie, even supposedly good cause, destroys trust, rightfully so.

The fact they’re willing lie - much less brazen manner - incredibly telling.

I’ve never anti-masker, made question everything ever said else willing lie about? degree narcissism attitude. played rules got vaxed. I’d rather smile people let know I’m threat suffer/live fear.  number vaccinated individuals hospitalized *extremely* small. boatloads evidence this.

“Profound incubation period” lol. First doesn’t really make much sense language perspective, incubation period vast majority infections caused coronavirus 2 11 days (average 5 days) relatively standard airborne respiratory viruses.

Stop making stuff up. I've lost son respiratory failure years ago. cannot always protect little ones risks, Covid, definitely take measures protect best can. Thank great Mom. First, highest, ""honor goes Hungary, also nation.

secondly kind thing happens first hit, hit known virus here. first reported case march 4. virus already active area well that, testing limited deaths overlooked normal flu/pneumonia

we lacked strong national plan governors shoot hip that. coupled us densely populated state things going rough ahead game.

compare thay several states got hit months later, every opportunity learn NJ NYs mistakes still massive death tolls. states actively banned efforts slow virus down. grace favorable environment, better time year hit exceed numbers

as unemployment comparable PA well NY Maybe could thought better year attempt get ""I climbed Everest"" patch? Covid profound incubation period, number vaccinated covid patients hospitals appreciable.

You infer population people think ""clean/safe/immune"" readily spreading virus... spending money? disenfranchising colored people anything else? American might case. pretty much anything want right now, post response proposal ""wear mask around kids"". subject thread America. barely left house 14 months United States, that's really you. WFH great realize job done remotely full time, done remote India third cost.  would absolutely accept compromise job offered it. anxiously awaiting word return plans. mRNA vaccines retain efficacy 75% *asymptomatic infection* caused B.1.135, problematic variant.

So...what variants gonna test population? 

Oh wait...you don’t know pulled line nowhere note got Johnson Johnson vaccine, none mRNA ones. end day none 8 seriously ill virus. basicly it. people getting side effects side effects overblown peolle talking feeling like got hit train etc feel tired like long day work day want rest wakeup next day feeling lot better. you’re vaxed it’s problem magnetic microchips shit

You're either sitting gold mine need immediate medical attention. Could go either way, guess. Like kids younger 12? see indication we're talking right now,

Really? think guy responding talking ""partially"" talking right now? think talking about, then?

When tried tell five weeks instead two, actually trying talk issue year now?  I'm supposed trust someone thinks Trump great president, downplays covid thinks mask assault freedom? going about? seldom left house 14 months everytime I've worn mask. think data suggests safe take I'm vaccinated. trust science. trust vaccine. works. I'm willing bet life that. CDC making public health guidelines based honor system It’s MRNA shots . get Pfizer first moderna second etc . difference side effects tend prevalent take two separate brand moderate side effects. thing I’d argue there’s studies efficacy changing brands long efficacy lasts it’s etc I’d rather shot personally future studies results come based shot trials company’s cross shot trials they’ll won’t focus priority data persay. way know say moderna efficy lasts long don’t second guess cuz one there’s not. There’s one it’s latter. never life seen someone wear mask publicly outside Asia. Don’t confuse discredit people wanting keep masks place protect people keep numbers low non existent people enjoy wearing mask 24/7. magnets fry computer chips?

Not meaningful scenario (disclaimer somebody chimes ACTUALLY...)

Magnets around magnetic computer disk drives, even huge danger people think is. concoct fairly specific scenario screw computer disk magnet - sticking floppy disk refrigerator magnet would probably it, example. OP response similar question [on another thread 42 years old, shape, comorbities, rich... lost shit lottery disease. still find plenty ppl lining draw ticket. bet risk everything upside. Amazing. They’re not. want to. Businesses want many people stores possible want make money.  distinct scientific definitions? First dose yesterday 😁 Canada here: would like accept (Vermont) federation. Tbh kind is. Masks suck close nothing possible vaccinated person. I’ll respect wishes companies want require masks, won’t wearing mine required it’s simple. reason terms personal safety safety others, legal obligation so, would I? I? many 5nm transistors fit inside human hair’s cross-section (4,900,000,000 sq nm). You’re sick man, leave burritos alone.    believe Covid hoax different flu mom’s anti-vaxer she’s outright told she’s going this. confusing design rule size transistors chip size complete chip hundreds thousands transistors. Better numbers today  Dudes face made entirely thumb knuckle skin guy gets it! probably wear mine summer outside. pumped finally mask order rescinded time wildfire season! stores don’t enforce it. long you’re respectful polite there’s issue wearing mask. local Costco following “local mask mandates” issue shop today without mask. cashier polite helpful checked out. I’m vaccinated I’m completely done theater masks.  lady gets it! yes, clinical trials indeed worse walked local grocery store greeted brand spankin’ new “masks recommended required vaccinated customers” sign. back! Enjoy weekend everyone! feel good. 

And you’re nothing worthless tr*ll. 

Get blocked, *sshole. would thought we'd trying get pop clinics local spots like churches schools. he'll, even mobile trucks! Like, schedule time date truck come neighborhood. still helping. get saying sending AZ doses better nothing. AZ works safe vaccine people feel bad getting it.

It's honestly disturbing wealthier countries neglecting use it/passing countries simply *perceived* less safe really not, really passing decrease vaccine hesitancy. ""I consider feelings"" yeah made clear. Pretty sure I've waited guys like you. ""Nice guy"" liberal types barely want work help anybody around them. Feel good wearing mask year like something. Never really willing go deep. I'm gonna change mind tonight. Feel good. change think improbable teenager could lie vaccinated status?

Furthermore, actually happened several healthy, fit guys Yankees. Immune systems weird shit cannot vaccinated yet. No. not. Welcome aboard (almost)! I'm pretty damn sure weightloss matter fronting get 2 free shots shoulder, obesity would cease real problem worldwide guy gets it! I’m saying someone that’s immunocompromised, suffers anxiety vaccinated. Don’t dwell mutations. It’s completely control form draconian measures change that. virus ability mutate around vaccines might, thus far that’s showing case potent variants still match efficacy vaccines. Stress, anxiety living fear weaken immune system. Stay vigilant, live life enjoy every moment add “Fuck Covid Carpe Diem.” understand concern vaccinated person isn’t necessarily concern, it’s policy issue. 

I’m happy CDC confirm vaccinated person won’t serve carrier virus, lifted weight shoulders makes excited return many things gave Covid. think can. reality though, fully vaccinated little worry about. without, worried exposure, likely wear masks. without, believe masks, vaccines, Covid, likely contact spread Covid likeminded people point near future.  many antimaskers matter. keep seeing immunocompromised people thrown around group can't vaccinate, want people know untrue. fact, they're encouraged risk covid far greater mRNA vaccine. includes cancer patients, etc. people restricted allergies ingredients vaccine - polysorbate peg. allergies super rare, like infinitesimal. vaccine science miracle works. children obviously can't get yet that's due age supply. We've got 11 half year old (God damnit), sucks can't get shot, we'll continue amend behavior slightly get it. means stupid indoor crowded things, etc. think parents same. CDC recommendations literally say masks still required hospitals, planes, close quartered living facilities like prisons Yeah they’re upset don’t visual identifier asshole   mean sincerely. hope somebody love gets severe case covid. suppose could be.. something.. that, immediate medical condition one means:
 
Vent: maybe survive, 
No Vent: definitely die
 
You cross bridge swallowing food later. world never get better,.. everyone’s top priority (selfishly) “staying comfortable”. 

Small personal sacrifices contribute greater good,.. get us faster. proof theory people belief system simply intelligent enough figure community spread works. Thank you! It’s gonna spread matter what. We’ve seen time time matter? want get vaccinated go get worry other's don't. exhausting. It’s like think CDC hasn’t thought that. DFW state mandates lifted March, stores restaurants area still required patrons abided. weekend since CDC announcement I’ve lot places requiring more, neither staff customers. course they’ll fucking lie. Come on, people STILL believe entire thing hoax.  Aren’t like 2/3 Americans vaccinated? think would likely find people vaxxed 7 lucky number, must even comfortable right?  call support animal ESA technically psychiatric support dog PTSD. debilitating anxiety attacks keeps safe public.

But trained behave public similarly service dog someone blind otherwise physically disabled. get pets public working maintain focus job throughout day. One thing could get respirator, eye protection, go somewhere, short periods time, could relatively safe. obviously keep distance, forth. immunocompromised, cancer patients

Cancer patients *are* immunocompromised, that's they're vulnerable.  shit. Source?

NL slow logistics vaccine, seen here: 

""Aan de beschikbare vaccins ligt het niet. Aan het einde van deze week zijn er 4,7 miljoen dosis van de vaccins van Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna en AstraZeneca geleverd aan Nederland. Meer dan een miljoen van die geleverde vaccins zijn nog onbenut. Dat zijn vaccins die nog wachten op een kwaliteitscontrole, dienen als veiligheidsvoorraad inmiddels onderweg zijn naar priklocaties van de GGD huisartsen.""

I'm assuming Dutch. Source: Right question transmissing to? protecting point? point say unvaccinated adults electively decided become vaccinated society need bend shape protect them.

I know small number people unable get vaccine due things like active chemo. point people likely living conservative sheltered lifestyle anyway regardless everyone else doing, readily available extremely effective PPE use need go out.

And clear data school opening majority transmission actually teacher teacher teacher student much less student student student-to-teacher transmission.

Additionally, kid kid far covid concerned. 12-plus kid much higher risk five six year old. Even among generally low risk category point 12 plus crowd majority 200 deaths occurred US, able get vaccine. subset community ‘might’ infect children low risks point

Kids low risk anything even bother protecting all? Right? low risk getting hit train, let play train tracks.^/s vaccinated people become infected virus, transmission seems rarer still

Anyone link published, peer-reviewed paper supporting this? bureaucrat says fact make fact. I'm thinking surprise announcement large number Yankee team members testing positive even though fully vaccinated.  personally risk level I'm comfortable with. I've got kid 2 recently feel comfortable public indoor places with, covid cases pretty low vaccination rates looking good, I'm okay starting take stores places. parent constantly weigh risk levels things, family covid risk low enough stop cautious. people even read sources posting, post first thing came quick google search? already variants vaccines less effective. say wasn't. I'm wlw plaid lol. surprised high percentage people picture wearing plaid  I've couple MLB games now, masks still required times unless actively eating drinking seat, almost nobody follows rule. Seating also socially distanced outside, long drink hand sip employee comes by, really easy get away with.  What’s careless trying bubble kids attempt spare facing danger all. risk child facing Covid much, leaving house anything much risk accept. great point ignore mutations altogether. people

Fixed I'm doctor, vaccinated they're not, really problem, right? I’m thinking choose lie Putting discomfort people I’m protecting infected someone else waste time. Especially people get vaccinated want protected.  Thanks, found helpful! Let us know Monday goes friend Yeah shit

It's like CDC current administration moon last year. can't even get 70% country get vaccinated fuck gonna say, ""honor system guys!""

I predict gonna crash burn like Hindenburg CDC wrong science. Vaccinated people low risks contracting spreading covid, really need wear mask.

The issue human behavior, infectious disease science. really good way verifying vaccination status (and yes, got little card, faked), either rely honor system, treat vaccinated unvaccinated way ... ... ask wear mask.

BTW, whole mask debate, ironically, important unvaccinated ones risks. already fully vaccinated. pretty much fine. pocket concentrated unvaccinated people risk. clear, commenting “ professionals around world” bit comment. CDC US agency. course will. point everyone wants vaccine could’ve one (save kids, soon follow also there’s mountain data saying kids rarely seriously affected).

So go get rona die you’re truth denier, that’s 100% need experts tell us water wet? Yeah. get it. 12-15 year olds getting approved. 12 couple months. Opening limited capacity long everyone wears masks good compromise. least reach 60% vaccinated and/or everyone chance get vaccinated + 6 weeks, kids 11 would put us mid late October.

So many people said early on, let live lives even wear masks. changed ""I want wear masks anymore I'm vaccinated."" Well there's still people aren't. late reign back now. like July 2019, know, Sars-Cov-2 discovered. they're sure covid. I’ve never seen many anti-vaxxers claiming received vaccine before... good sources talk normal vaccine clinical trials covid trial actually supper different comes safety metrics normal vaccine trials. coworker worried made fast. feel well. I've followed every restriction even enacted high risk family members.  we're vaccinated want keep wearing mask serve example people likely never wore mask begin with. I'll still wear mask wherever required live non mask mandated state I've seeking places they're required. I'm expert, they'll lie. never waste time good person good things. 

Last week Laundromat (next Liquor Store),.. noticed broken glass bottle sidewalk outside. asked Attendant broom dustpan could sweep broken glass shards. 

Would anyone stepped cut foot open?.. idea. sweep know answer. 

Thats little thing quite pandemic,.. example “making difference”. keep eyes open making difference however whereever can. attitude “nothing matters” isnt gonna get us there. stay home forever possible mutations even exist yet? mentioned anything lockdown three years plus?

The poster mentioned right global pandemic control

How long suggest waiting, three weeks? Totally agree course like hearing it, blue conservative. Like need experts tell us this. That's alright...they sift natural selection. Perhaps time people start minding businesses like good ole days :)   We've herd immunity many diseases decades, yet still get new cases those. people can't get vaccinated, therefore never fully vanishes. soon Walmart made masks optional, things fell apart.  suspect CDC political pressure let people get back normal life regardless numbers say. Also, media knows COVID longer grip public's attention media wants get back issue climate change. Greta Thunberg longer cute kid was. Time.

4/19 President opens vaccine everyone.

I made appointment 30 seconds 4/19 got dose 1 4/20.

I wait 3 weeks required. 5/11. got dose 2. two weeks immunity. 5/25.

I literal first person line immunity yet, exposed liars Walmart now.

So yeah, everyone get yet. File one ""Duh!"" Indeed. Venn diagrams also show potential sets, even empty. 

And neither shows size sets, tiny sliver higher number people big circle.  CDC obviously best experts. also saw last year political pressure made downplay virus. mention new mask free guidelines coming day congress basically made big deal long American people suffer need loosen restrictions. I'm claiming CDC level expertise here, I'm giving opinion. Obviously believe think right.   vaccine es wonderful perfect. virus spreading, lots vaccinated people still get sick die fault own.  shit, Sherlock. arent vaccinated? trained ESA anxiety. Technically would psychiatric support animal someone asks her.

I problem someone asking service animal, though. help anxiety attacks PTSD job well.

She wears vest working public specific actions help me. always tries keep making anxious (dogs generally sense better do). start panic, she'll bump thigh lick hands. work she'll lick face. anxiety attack, cuddles necessary part training. finally offers physical support standing back up.

But observer see dog vest slack leash heeling close underfoot. sniffing ground objects large portion focus face - even paying attention her. also shouldn’t paying “certificate” comes mental health professional who’s treating condition. It’s literally prescription ensures keep ESA pet housing. That’s it’s supposed for.

 people lie take advantage anytime someone sees dog public assume it’s fake. feel awful real service dog owners. point comes personal responsibility. need mask wear mask. choose to, hopefully informed decision take chances. probably gain immunity old-fashioned way.

A good argument supporting mask policy relief vaccinated number hesitants pulls vax side. true, save lives. probably cost lives. guess we'll see next weeks way hesitants choose. US says need masks mean pandemic over. Look rest world. Look what's still happening here. becomes endemic yet. would feel comfortable 6 reasons. Well hope too. mean, Brazil developing vaccines now, depende president buy we're screwed   Yes like overlooked lot stuff throughout pandemic.
Right advising people mask beginning this. People need support animal abuse bring pets everywhere them. vaccine 100% effective. impossible standard.  Also, incubators new strains vaccines may effective. Yeah, shit. masks work best protecting others.

You’re still wrong. someone gets sick, doesn’t make fault. rely judgement people qualified provide safety. every day cross bridge designed engineer, eat food inspected government, ride car brakes designed mechanical engineer. Specialization takes decades intense study. rely virologists, immunologists, epidemiologists countless brilliant, focused people provide future. vaccines save life life another interact with. I'll judge that. Weeks** Bangladesh said

All need patent Congrats antibodies!  RemindMe! 2 months employees got access vaccine waiting 2 week period them, I'll tell said can't understand I've convinced I'm noble. risk health, housing, food? that's connected work.  dont understand work. supposed imply vaccinated people gonna fine unvaccinated people lie wear mask? 

Isnt data vaccinated people based current mask rules? 

Could backfire? Really stresses :(.

What immunocomprimised people...? That's terrible, I'm really sorry hear that. merely asked studies updated guidance based on. think legitimate question, particularly seems like political pressure release it. still significant portion population vaccinated still spreading virus. virus transferred bats (possibly another animal) humans minks back humans less one year. There's clearly fairly easy zoonotic transfer going on. don’t need wait invite. keep eye Internet book year eligible. mail post might arrive 2 weeks later. about? still 60+ group 31% first shot. months away herd immune. see this. Tbh, imagine family members give faster loved one too. Dementia really hard inflicted family members well, especially caregivers. source that? find it’s confirmed vaccine NL send. help countries worse.

Yes, 100% agreed. matter demand supply time country helps others first going depend otherwise benefits giving country. Suriname pretty low America's long list countries help, country lost 200 people COVID America precarious relationship. NL finally making headway restoring ties former colony. heard whole thing started Australia, panic stock shelves ""clean"" next shipment coming Wuhan ""tainted"" everyone wanted get clean stock. pictures empty toilet paper shelves Australia spread around world caused panic buying everywhere. Probably little truth remember reading about. *Officially reports first officially acknowledged cases that, girlfriend immunocompromised meds take (The doctors said would way worse take meds even though would make C-19 much worse still does), even get onto sort fast tack system government think actually immunocompromised guess. 
She's first one last week said anything getting second yet.

Haven't seen year half since live different country. Yeah, total lack respect others trying argue save lives.

Bye now. Yeah, need act globally prevent serious mutations even infections. whole country may reached herd immunity it’ll less effective could start large campaigns Pfizer CEO said earnings call expects 6 months eligible vaccination last quarter year 2 years September think Netherlands last among Western EU nations. We're getting rid AZ vaccines presume. 66%, need reach 75% heard immunity, covid weeks. Yes, anyone chooses vaccinated live die choices they've made. *want* die, something control over. control choose walk traffic take base jumping fun new hobby. 

You seem want protect people forcing things absolutely want do. understand convinced somehow noble.

Are vaccines free, accessible, available? Yes, yes, yes. everyone mask point least easy access one? Absolutely. That's control. people choose lives them. grateful deciding choices dumb make choices them. don’t appreciate narrative calling people selfish simply listening latest CDC guidelines March 2020 different CDC. One manipulated hamstrung.

And individuals take personal responsibility health. did, got vaccinated. 

Otherwise would arresting people forcing needles arms. want? colonial guilt strong. get shot beaten up? stories people getting attacked customers telling people wear masks. doubt requiring show vaccination cards same. Don’t underestimate selfishness people.  would Bangladesh able recreate entire supply chain patents alone within couple months? Covid associated less one death per day US past year 0-18 age group. Less, count 0-11 age group still ineligible vaccination. radically overestimating either effectiveness masks, fatality rate Covid children, both. Google ""vaccinatie wanneer"", end would probably make sense stores indoor testing, every single CVS Walgreens around drive testing. to, acceptable alternative. Sorry can’t respect others, complaints accusing others same. 

As said before, great night. Blocking now. need AZ second dose.

People family already received Biontech second dose first AZ dose younger 60. they’re vaccinated they’re spreading around like someone unvaccinated. also know vaccine isn’t effective 50%? so? Stupid number. Walgreens CVS explained primary reasoning they're COVID testing location people liable come inside sick get tested 

So want play little safer Yeah, tend get way people covering arguments favor child death willfully obtuse. need stop spread. use looking individuals. Lottery like Ohio maybe? prefer combination approach outreach programs empathetic faces say “stupid idiots” behind backs. care others much would like protect actions?

And protect preferences since would deliberate choice vaccinated *and* wear mask?

And like punishing tens millions people gotten vaccinations? No, don’t. Never never will.  worry much. vaccine supply exponentially growing (like covid cases January). currently, limiting factor doses, expected June, limiting factor ggd employees.
Besides pandemic wise, good idea also vaccinate poor countries (to limit chances mutations), fully vaccinated Surinam population result able go holiday there.
Also, least country occupied long. Hopefully one day, misinformation costing lives.   accidentally jumped thousand read Suriname getting 700 vaccines. confused Google ...lol work software consulting company we’re thing. three options: full remote, hybrid, full in-person. specify full in-person get permanent desk using number hybrid people set “hotel” workstations anybody claim day days. able switch modes need circumstances change. check, that's kind problem. cant get 1st shot till end june CDC well regarding COVID-19? country waiting CDC must handled COVID-19 poorly well. Countries like Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, New Zealand, etc. much better informed made much better decisions without waiting precious CDC. reason US well vaccines, CDC slow, poorly made decisions. yes jumped gun getting rid mask mandates, slow adopt mask mandates. messed times, correct. focus children sudden bizarre. big concern 8 year olds dieing COVID. We've known year now. kids still masked, adding level protection have. fact, CDC guidelines continue mask up. 

Anyone who's supposedly concerned children right likely comfortable *any* risk *any* cases COVID. possible realistic. people ignored. Q: tell someone lying vaccination 

A:  ask election mean like every variant? Virus gonna virus. Vaccine gonna vaccinate. Wtf headline steps away saying eugenics bad ok. Nobody deserves die even they're objectively stupid fuck. Except pedos/rapists. would step saw that. anyone give shit someone wants wear mask, even isn’t “required?” isn’t business don’t know situation. Nah, quite. Maybe circle SLIGHTLY goes side. dipshits dumb luck year somehow gotten infected I'll keep wearing mask even though I've vaccinated, want mistaken republican. elaborate meltdowns ? US curious ICU nurse here. tried scroll past without commenting, can’t. Making sweeping generalization “the large majority” nurses believing covid largely unhelpful, say least. clarification statement applying nurses doesn’t make better. can’t understand why, physician, you’d find piece comment helpful insightful — but, OK.  non-vaxxer work walked work first day news. couldn’t wait celebrate mask rule.  Wanted agree celebrate her. took look say despite getting shots still wearing mask summer due people go maskless shots 
She quit changed subject. liars force, there’s doubt Nope. Masks ineffective control. I’m vaccinated Covid I’ll still wear mask don’t feel like asshole feel judged 😆 Hell Yep. 0 deaths NEVER happen. Everything life risk. Even simple task like walking chance causing death really depends nurse! absolutely gone lots training - even doctors home countries.

That said, also nurses license &amp; LVNs, never go that.. said time time again, masks good job protecting *yourself* protecting people.

Vaccines protects *yourself*.

I give shit lie day, protect *YOURSELF* don't. got called snotty work yesterday told dude fighting wearing mask free enter property. pretty damn simple.

 going goddamn nightmare June 15th me, California dropping mandate, job following. Great plan. I’ll leave home. person wear mask things. I’m frustrated wearing mask Target person isn’t, wouldn’t think. I’d say Fauci political hack. 

He lied American people masks, said Cuomo good job— the, wk, said next Mother’s Day things back normal 180. 

Also mandating masks outdoors long scientific evidence vector spread (same outdoor dining) political theater. see plenty difference. reason interested ""winning one"" ""your side"" internet accurate understanding reality. don’t think need wonder much. 

We actively working study serious infectious diseases labs like around world. wouldn’t stretch say sometimes things slip cracks get out. It’s easy claim something “bat” wouldn’t devalue already important research labs need keep us alive. Also it’s better people blame people vs institution might studying it. 

That’s say assisted living facility COVID outbreaks sites, it’s hard believe you’re working essentially bio weapons. It. Doesn't. Matter. anyone reliable source whether Pfizer Moderna effective particular variant? 


When tried searching 50/50 yes no. I'm hoping least able prevent severe illness death hard finding information actually correct. making informed projection based rate escape variants emerged date. There’s hypothetical risk antibodies decaying etc haven’t seen yet. seen however SA variant reduced efficacy 75 percent, selective pressure imagine another variant 65 percent another one 55 percent. would enough circulate continuously evolve further.

We would hope vaccinated individuals would rarely get hospitalized exposed escape variant cross reactivity, reasonable project would happen (at rate somewhat higher seasonal flu, say, 10x higher) would want booster time point knock further.  keep saying there's evidence presented evidence people indignant, understanding, acting (whether arguing/voting certain way, arguing certain people need hurting, taking handwaving actual violence). Hell there's measurable uptick violence Asians year, get worse gets narrowed maskers. I'm not, profile specifically created push agenda.  mean. 35 year old woman pregnant twins, severe swelling walk 10 feet without needing 5 minute break minimum, c section last June, started hemorrhaging table vomiting profusely... (so clearly dealt lot)... 2nd Moderna shot kicked ass 24 hours. Badly. 

My husband reaction sore arm. 

Just hit hard, mean get hit hard dramatic.  bad? kids get MIS-C? happens child, never ""that bad"".

Have seen country reacts school shootings? people expect? person arguing clearly compassionate/empathetic bones body. I'd like let know appreciate view making community-driven choices alone it. Let's vaccinate asap. Waiting data right seems ridiculous harm good. vaccine helps virus mutate build immunity it

This first I've heard claim, source? suspect may misunderstanding evolutionary pressure works. immune system killing insufficiently mutated viruses different from, ""helping virus mutate build immunity."" I’ve fully vaccinated almost three months. much generous am.
Those Americans refusing vaccines jerks. studies? Link plz can’t find the. CDC transparent studies. google studies, it’s msm saying “studies show”, “the data says.” want actual documentation showing studies I’ll believe CDC. squares make circle. speaking doctor scientist - theoretically Moderna Pfizer vaccines nearly exactly identical effects people. u/thelonewolf527 better idea lift restrictions CDC center disease control prevention... hmmm 🤔 sub seems really fired masks don’t understand ! I’m vaccinated happy wear one Well, everyone vaccinated feel safe shopping Walmart, shots masks become superfluous. anti maskers anti vaxxers, shop too. people still pretend covid threat vaccinated people avoid WAL-MART, vanishingly small amount science deniers.  Back cool. never cared got covid not. knew infected would responsible thing self-isolate. soon vaccine became available, got first shot. infected covid shots. immediately went isolation two weeks. point unable maximum intensity workout. didn’t lose sense smell, wouldn’t known anything wrong. understand many people aren’t lucky healthy me, done everything possible protect around me. mask mandate falls, mask. People refuse vaccine limit ability achieve herd immunity contributing deaths cannot get vaccine, whereas relatively asymptomatic get infected like first time.  want die, let them.  delusional. studies released even week showing vaccines effective variants. intentionally misrepresenting studies say frankly pathetic.

Please actual research stop trying spread unsubstantiated fear. irresponsible simply embarrassing yourself. Vaccine status PHI you’ll never legally allowed ask it.

That’s none enforceable Yes, CDC crunched numbers realized irrelevant Historically CDC political agency, however, COVID-19 pandemic, specifically Trump Administration's handling pandemic, resulted ""dangerous shift"" according previous CDC director others.

How considered part medical Community told people masks work Airborne virus? lost credibility became political people need stop fucking equating ""Maybe wear masks little longer, given skin noses all."" ""Let's go back square one lock everything never go outside again!""

Because two equivalent, unless someone agenda. fuck point vaccine?  people acting CDC update, get impression think masks actually effective vaccines. Lol. Well least talk mad shit anti-vaxxers thier faces lie it. fun, ""Oh feel bad poor ignorant anti-vaxxers, dumbest, ugliest, weeziest, ignorant, weak lung'd, anti-social, un-American, super ignorant, family hating, old people sacrificing, scared little jerks worthless, like though!"" Faucci even said he'd fine running someone infected long vaccinated so..... gives shit? super sarcastic work nursing home know could still get infected pass along kids.

Just know, single case vaccinated people passing COVID anyone. children situation before, is, danger unvaccinated people spreading COVID. Well, know 29% Americans feel comfortably lying absolutely anything. Pfizer say back mid April. Last week experts, work Pfizer, said people probably okay without it. science says mask wearing, N95 similar masks, really doesn’t help much prevent getting disease around infected wearing masks themselves. Wearing masks much prevent spreading germs others helping greater good.

That’s thought first it’s accurate information anymore. good evidence mask wearing also protects wearer. Lol, like, shit lie. people weren’t wearing masks though barred entering businesses putting people risk before. won’t be. I've always considered kitchen folk functional kind crazy. Perpetually half bag, carrying around lot anger, prone outbursts, otherwise work-functional. fucking pomeranian? Come on, now. beginning literally said masks bad parent 2 kids 12, worst news cdc could happened. People don’t want wear masks get vaccinated lie go places mask less now. It’s lot dangerous us go places kids since people could spreading still masks somewhat protect others around them. wife fully vaccinated kids eligible get it, things got LOT worse us thanks dishonest antivaxxers. People significant immunity (80%+) 50%. Obviously higher places, lower others. 66% Pennsylvania adults least dose instance.  r/choosingbeggar. confess… read article commenting. Take away, boys… reasonably expect (more likely not) find strains escape current vaccines. South African strain shows escape it’s quite there. world 50 percent immunized unmasks enormous selective pressure towards escape variants. 

The common cold corona viruses escape every years, example. main hope get shots enough cell adaptability future infection biggie.  wish mine like that. capacity limits masks optionals. Eligibility age 18-50 started April 19th much country, Johnson Johnson paused time. means even people got appointments immediately still fully vaccinated week two. announcement would needed come month later statement true. anti science? threads always attracted different audience non-stickied posts They’re insane Maine. Brain. getting results paid get.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here's states dropped mask mandate. 0 experienced covid surge. Netheir states ended social distancing business restritions experienced covid surge.  someone please give logical reason matters don’t get vaccine downvote cause we’re Reddit? everyone wants get it, everyone does, matter Johnny doesn’t it? vaccine works shouldn’t anything worry about, right? Johnny ends getting covid y’all won’t anything worry since vaccine say works. “CDC medical community”, “Go look medicine subreddit” -TeddyBongwater wonder flue numbers also impacted levels sanitizing that’s going on. Even though proven isn’t super helpful preventing COVID infection think really helps diseases transmitted primarily via surfaces (which think Flue Norovirus are). get link? Half country barely fully vaccinated, yes, continue wear one. Robert Redfield still head. hack. decision makes zero sense. 12-16 yrs got go ahead less week ago, protectrd yet. School 2-6 weeks. wait 4- 6 weeks? Makes zero sense stupid post. months mask mandates vaccines still rolled out, particularly children, spread still going big way, mean “never move on”. old children’s yarn sea simplest thing would tie lifting mask mandates vaccination rates, done really understand

Just waiting months means nothing people actually getting vaccinated. cut ties person went high school proudly saying going use religious exemption reason vaccinating children. 

I told want person abuses system like life. right? jesus christ lol COURSE people gonna fucking lie, people always fucking group difficult first place I'd argue *terrible* grifting, society devolved point grifters rarely get punished. Cases reasonable level ffs mother hearing issues relies reading lips lot. mask thing difficult empathize that. 

However, stupidity woman finds new ways baffle me. Months ago telling sister exempt wearing masks “insert BS ADA claim”.

I watched implode asked wearing mask going help read lips people wearing masks... Exactly. ""Masks forever"" go well ""open office floor plans"" average employees. matter much higher-ups love them, suck, people want work there. business attire vs. casual attire another great example. Good point, kids flu don’t get sent home school automatically two weeks get every kid close contact home, also.

That’s biggest fear daughter: medical impact getting sent home two weeks impact life. need give every vaccinated person government card.  solved then. Don’t think CDC - team highly qualified epidemiologists - would’ve factored decision? People free unmask mask. going go well recent “it’s okay, drop masks!” announcement. understand administration’s desire transparency really need get someone PR perspective get messaging it’s mess they’re currently doing. entire post saying people lie vaccinated wear mask Genuinely trying combative, isn’t still risk getting covid even vaccinated? know there’s news people state dying getting vaccinated thought could whatever that. Freedom choice Ricks? feel like area many kids vaccinated. Every day see moms shopping kids definitely wear masks school mom let wear one store.  end day, blame lies democratic countries utterly failing responsibility protect people. utter nonsense playing blame game, called alarms sounded well advance expectation novel pandemic. What's weeks, US citizens still saying ""it's flu"".

Don't kid yourselves, china sent sirens first sneeze. world would've called ""sick men asia cried wolf"", reddit going town memes, ""china trying scare us fake sars"". Mask mandates correlated reducing Covid spread, lots people fence vaccines persuaded—I think there's much bigger benefit focusing vaccination efforts. Something something birth certificate  Ah, yes. Sunday sermons honesty paying off. like ones compassion “love thy neighbor”. Uh, shit? Ah yes, Nurses Union. many nurses anti vaxx peddle MLM shit? 

Nurses aren’t doctors definitely aren’t scientists. Okay. Wear mask forever want. couple weeks heads-up would’ve nice instead springing us like did.

What would done change situation you? older brother already this. tells stores vaccinated refuses mask up, claimed we’re close enough herd immunity doesn’t need jab. also claims getting would big deal him, “old people needing worry”.

He still wears Proud Boy shirt defend January 6th attack. Yes, bet could name 10 states might 10 states definitely 100% accuracy. Yes people lie, matter anyways others vaccinated? You’re entitled opinion. I’ll give that. don’t agree think it’s “me first” opinion, everyone opinion still lifting restrictions tomorrow. issue Indian variant might stop us lifting restrictions June or, worse, make us go backwards. people lie actively infected keep eating indoors Arby's. TIL expert don’t need masks regardless now. There’s reason distinction vaccines commonplace now. WalMart one first follow science.

just allowing everyone crowd store mask regardless vaccine status science Yep totally screw everything up, continue Question: say ""who immunosuppressive treatments past,"" including people still currently going immunosuppressive treatments recently stopped, include immunosuppressive treatments regardless time passed since completion?

I ask friend happened get diagnosed testicular cancer beginning 2020 go chemo summer last year, since finished chemo also gotten Pfizer vaccine. mean effectively covered due past immunosuppressive treatments, even though finished chemo July/Aug last year?

Could also link said study? Risk give take friend. want protect kids time can’t wrap bubble wrap forever.
If whole goal trying ensure 0 kids die that’s never going happen. kids die vaccinated flu rather unvaccinated covid. I'm gonna guess hospitalized actively refuse talk admit got it, get tested, develop long covid, long term effects, admit those, either, they'll pretend they're unrelated issues know developed. we'll see whole iceberg lost productivity, illness, well see tip. Stop trying make boosters happen. Thank saying this. I’m frustrated right almost everyone work boyfriend’s family vaccinated stopped wearing masks. still fully vaccinated recently found asthma, I’m still cautious. mention, literal scientists said still get possibly die even you’re vaccinated. also possibly still spread it. They’ve also said may change minds later it’s NOVEL VIRUS idea things may change future.
Just sick it. Anti-maskers one thing, new issue people get vaccine want hop right back normal living like don’t still work frustrating. vaccinated never scared 1 bit coronavirus. teacher vaccinating teachers school seemed like good idea school also let us know would best interest take shot. wanted anyway whatever. However, hadn’t going store today would mask on. always thought dumb wore cause problems. Now, would tell little white lie go business normal. studies long term effects mRNA?  Well, there’s one thing pandemic taught us, it’s people trusted!/s realize CDC modeled exactly said? Herd immunity strictly vaccine rate. Many non conformers antibodies already. We’ve seen happens restrictions lifted states like Texas Florida. seems like there’s lot conflict mask policy CDC’s leadership, timing announcements last days gotten really sloppy think probably reflects everyone CDC page #NotSurprised Sure, end sometime. cannot continue mandate masks people vaccinated - fatigues people causes mask mandates less effective. want see continued mask use pandemics, flu season, outbreaks, etc, use sparingly. People vaccinated quarantined COVID required wear mask. People lie vaccinations die (sorry) people immunocompromised understand increased risk take consideration. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Wear mask. hard it? Wouldn’t help variant gets population? Didn’t CDC say teeny-tiny print, don’t know people suppressed immune systems correct reaction vaccine work? Aren’t millions people Lupus, RA diseases require immune suppressing drugs?

One life doesn’t matter. CDC money. many people dying time - costs much money. many people dying society going permanently shift economic’s - it’s okay people die. 

I wish CDC would shut hell unless admit mask guidelines sliding scale money key factor.  guess don’t understand people that, whole lockdown, said anti-vaxxers morons think know better scientists CDC, people refusing wear masks think CDC wrong. really don’t understand. Right, think outdoors always fairly safe even vaccines. indoors another story especially since people get vaccinated first ones take masks also people come ""small cold"" care people. probably still mask inside stores sanity. Uhh, seen case rates recently? US case rates absolutely plummeting since mid-April show signs slowing down. work healthcare, gave us thing put badge signifies got vaccinated. provide vaccination card receive it. people got vaccine go maskless now. It’s grifts way course technology improved masks like medical devices. known covering nose mouth prevents reduce virus/ bacteria spread Yankees case interesting. It’s showing still get infected vaccinated vaccines working prevent severe infections. Sounds like one person symptoms mild. without constant testing likely would never known. 

I’m quite curious sort happened. sit room somebody Covid positive long period time? one time exposure? 

Regardless, end it’s showing effectiveness vaccine stopping severe cases occurring. Anti-vaxxers them. Even doctors, believe not. Remindme! 36 hours suspect right, crazy part is... one stopping that. Like, want stay home forever, means, so. Finding remote job might problem doable. Idunno people feel like force lifechoice rest us that. unvaccinated people unvaccinated choice. Children infants cannot vaccinated. Also vaccines lower efficacy people medically vulnerable (persons leukemias example). Paywall point survival fittest. people dumb enough get vaccine. Can't care anymore people   able now, they're couple weeks away good protection little month away ""fully vaccinated"" Seems like forgot whole ""asymptomatic carriers"" thing?

I guess somewhere five 10% people actually honest visited retail small business frequent days ago. posting sign ""Vaccinated? mask...as long show proof!"". also checking ID. 

I told owner ""please take money!"" got good laugh. 

You're going able tell gives two fuck employees customers...  Wouldn’t easier tell kids talk strangers aren’t wearing masks? seems like circumstance occurs rarely young kids lives, makes sense put mask rare circumstances rather continue failing strategy telling everyone mask stay home. think giving credit significantly critical thinking they're capable Maine oldest state America average age. assume that's driving number. lot people get pissed off.

Anyone would follow CDC recommendations without teeth follow honor system. people already partially fully vaccinated.

30% Americans absolute morons believe coronavirus conspiracy made Bill Gates going lie people taking freedom. people unlikely ever get vaccinated matter do. lot people ALREADY refuse wear mask even government/business requires it.

Assume live state like Florida Texas, 80% people walking around without masks vaccinated. seems socially acceptable conspiracy theory say CDC recommended masks don’t work asymptomatic people shortage didn’t want seen unprepared Disinfecting nightly isn’t “clean,” it’s Adrian Monk. saw comment one doctor particularly nasty variant RSV floating around late 2019.

Let die There’s also natural law (or constitutional) allow government force people stay homes, close businesses, wear mask (ever), yet are. vaccine for? Either believe vaccine move lives live forever lockdown. I'm choosing former. moron, also predict lie Er, one : incredibly frustrating, I'll never respect either groups people again. Including parents immunocompromised family! We’ll get kids stuck time go back school. I’m team, trying help everyone let go idea dumb fucks forefront consideration everything do. I'll go one step actively hope eventual infections. Darwinism strength, fit situation. people mentally fit survive.  85% highest I’ve seen reliable source, overcompensating try convince people get vaccinated. don’t know “heard” information herd immunity, it’s quite off. Maybe 

I problem wearing mask even though covid antibodies. bother all.

It bother govt starts telling people wear mask based put bodies. 

Not saying I'm going one people lies I'd lying said cross mind. care continue speed mutate among non vax?

Lemme ask related question. STD many partners spred to? agree everything except last part. anti-mask stretch done literally everything right since pandemic began complaint. here's thing, feel like earned right take mask off. 14 months everything right fully vaccinated months now. wear mask stores require store public 3 year old son still wear (so anxious wearing one.) store place business allows vaccinated people go maskless, I'm going without one.

Don't reward good person following science take reward away shame accepting it. vaccinated people earned normalcy. Here's *choice* unvaxed person has. Get it, pass &amp; kill other's vaxed.  Cool, im expert ""remainder"" also includes high-risk groups getting vaccinated legitimate reasons (like sister-in-law breastfeeding waiting see research vaccinations breastfeeding, mother blood clots, diabetes, hypertension whose doctor legitimately concerned getting vaccine leaving choice her). think happen. *do* think might come two different sets rules, based whether patrons vaccinated not.  telling parents internet saying they're going change pandemic habits, lol.

I kid 5 chronic lung issue. constantly ridiculed people changing pandemic habits.

My kid may small chance getting even smaller chance severe, lungs ones he's likely get can't risk simply someone wants bring kids birthday party know 90% adults vaccinated, wear mask, wash hands going bathroom. 

It's worth risk. Kids chronic conditions there's very, little information risk compared healthy kids.

I'd rather wait months. We've started going eat occasionally go stores. kid issues wearing mask least. go park such. We're getting back semblance normalcy, rate parents around us. 

It's getting tiresome defend decisions parents though. They've never seen child struggling breath either though...so understand. exactly lie? Serious question. far I’m concerned, pretty much knew entire time different masks different efficiencies. mask miles better mask. CDC say said. valid argument, going India probably trumps it. going vaccine resistant strain pop up, odds happen India likely hundreds millions infections.  Michigan this, dropping mandate vaccinated people removing mask mandate 7/1 I'm shocked 10 year-old get vaccinated, I'll perfectly content let anti-vaxxers lie. us got vaccinated part help build herd immunity, let rest people get us rest way hard way.  something sociologists psychologists likely (and should) study. human need ""right"", ""better"", ""above"" others real seeing play real time.

It's almost cult-like mentality. ""We identify group bc wear mask. means know better you. take mask, look like you. else know we're better, like YOU?!?!?"" mask validating personal self- perception. Taking masks strips perceived valor. Lol I’ve already people lie vaccinated. people don’t want wear mask going people lie vaccinated. begins. cluster contribute hospitalizations mean elsewhere. faulty reporting US. likely spread quickly - quick contact tracing. states dropped mask mandates, new CDC guidance abused, going mayhem. guys really live fear? Yeah, I'm gonna keep wearing mask grocery store close people. friends feel comfortable enough eating restaurants. makes sense. people would eligible sooner. low population takes 653k people hit 48.65%. problem IMO fail realize people unvaccinated lie claim vaccinated since incentive get vaccinated ... nobody checking proof (especially heavily Republican areas states) bother?  See, thats said co-workers, higher ups always shooting us due ""workplace safety.""

Honestly, I'm hoping right temporary thing lot people get pissed off. promise won’t lie vaccinated. haven’t worn mask year either it’s changing. exactly ugly? BiL risked PP’s health, behaved like jackass, generally shitty human being, sound it. u/nokenito isn’t making comment BiL’s mother. PP anonymous forum, sharing life experience happened affected PP PP’s family.

The pearl-clutching scolding isn’t warranted. Never wore mask never going to. Mandatory vaccines conspiracy theory already bunch mandatory vaccines. soon COVID vaccine gets full FDA approval absolutely want mandatory.  ESAs airplanes went away somewhat incredibly selfish ill informed choice helps put everyone else danger stops us getting back normal. So, thanks guess? dies dies six month gap uptodate CDC waaay reasonable. need six months studying confirm medical professionals already know.

The political pressure prevented CDC operating normal timeline. ""China enough contain virus"".

""The U.S. local governments anything contain virus"".

""I lie instead contain virus"". make decisions based remote possibilities? so, hope never leave house.

I remember panic corona surviving surfaces ages people wearing plastic supermarket, dousing alcohol, washing clothes, showering washing goods bought. Kaiser Family Foundation, health policy nonprofit actively studying America's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, splits remaining holdouts four groups. late April, 9% people say want vaccine ""as soon possible."" Another 15% comprise ""wait-and-see"" crowd, followed ""definitely-nots"" 13%. Approximately half number says they'll take shots ""only required.""

 
These stragglers often labeled ""hesitant,"" term laden ""anti-vax"" undertones. survey responses convey spectrum reasons delays. Take ASAP contingent. one 10 said main barriers busy able take work.

 
This polling also helps counter stereotypes. Misinformation campaigns targeting Black Latino communities, KFF's analysis shows groups support misconceptions vaccine safety rates white people. considerable contrasts involve worries missing day employment paying pocket COVID-19 vaccines. Hispanic respondents report knowing shots free charge twice often white survey takers. ""thanks"" - every kid 12 Yeah first thought too. sending vaccines countries barely anything vaccinated yet? friend medical says talks doctors nurses even vaccinated yet, mess. I'd happy get vaccine end year, looking hopeful.  Yes, agree that. think least fact USA competent administration less 4 months, time, faced difficulty transitioning due lack cooperation information previous administration. 

The rest attribute making sure America enough, anything go awry. see even thread Dutch upset access yet leaders sending vaccines another country. one's country seeing much decline yet due supply shortage, questionable sending elsewhere. Looking county data 16-19 vax rate higher 20 29 age group. Also two half days 8% 12-15 year olds vaccinated. I'm fully vaccinated 7 year old. I'll still wearing one to. see many people bitching little piece harmless cloth. respect fellow humans enough wear one I'm potentially sick, good role model daughter. Lol, that's r/onejoke material. Actually experts government's business hell do,
 think answer part problem already lying though, don’t need degree see that, eyes. Huh?! Americans’ fault countries struggling COVID? really don’t know know dumb point is. never wore mask got infected lmfao Yeah looked yesterday, people ridiculous. They've whipped complete hysterical frenzy. Nurses barely taught interpret data, that's physicians for. rather frustrating loud medical topics beyond scope medicine. mean, yes hopefully. know get there, though. 

We keep mind long vaccine lasts, variants, endemic smaller populations. Obviously sit panic it, continue make safe choices. W/ laughing smiling also socially acceptable theory UK, except government never confessed Yep, we're slowly getting point vaccinated pro-maskers anti-vaxxers similar levels anti science. Good job big brain bud. Clearly agency crunches math many people don’t care dying page Yeah. confusing though. articles still saying June 15th. would fine me, mid-June right I'll fully vaccinated. articles saying Newsom reconsidered date, official announcement. Yet. know said. epidemiologists experts behavioral science increasing vaccinations?

Of course not. fucking way /s believe locking faces allowed social distancing rules. 

Cashback! possible new mask rules take consideration certain % lie also certain % continue wearing masks even dont need to? enough people vaccinated course vaccinated doesnt large impact dipwads mask up. Individual losses still awful govt. concerned overall trend. Meanwhile Pfizer raking cash baby yeeeehaw   Yet it’s surprise states like NY, Ca, Wa, known educated populations skeptical. right trust follow guidance states cared much since start. You’re right that’s bad 60% one dose 56% full dose. states 4-6 weeks that. even close. Well, nurses unions keep pushing solely unique informed, accepting hero praise, even going far call second Year Nurse, yeah, get lot raised eyebrows. You’re goof agenda. 

The story written February, updated earlier month. read September elsewhere no, didn’t source that, know study babies preteens could take “the better part year” complete
 
in linked story means? means “most of”. again, think “most of” *this year* means December 31st sometime 2022, good you, words meanings, seem willing anything understand them. vacinated yes. 

Just ask em election. many Covid cases didn’t get counted traveled back home state spread around? Damn... guess I'm expert society get decide we’re going continue respecting people’s civil liberties. right disclose personal medical information/status. 

I’m disappointed readily people willing give away freedoms. want live country get stopped asked papers go building? 

If you’re concerned Covid, get vaccine, doesn’t matter people are. you’re unable get vaccinated, that’s unfortunate mitigate risk best can, it’s rest world’s responsibility mask forevermore. 

We don’t ask people vaccinated ***anything*** else (any number diseases deadly COVID) except registering school travel. absolutely circumstance show COVID vaccine without show others (eg. you’re sharing vaccination record circumstances it’s *already* required). shit…? God damn like wearing mask though. *everyone thinks they’ll lie

Fixed you. Exactly! Thank immunocompromised person. not. even close. what? go without mask around vaccinated people get virus, life hard imbecile.  I’ve spent plenty time outside around others parks, hiking, national parks, etc. People masked unmasked I’ve never seen anyone purposely cough child another adult matter. People outside spend time families. personally live area people getting vaccinated perhaps experience skewed. But, honestly believe people going zoo spread political agenda coughing unvaccinated children? vaxxed still wearing mask, people going use simple reasoning presume sick immunocompromised. want perceived, fine. Yes, people wrong, mainly sending false signal. (In way, one that's lying) content available USA TODAY subscribers.

So actually say?

What experts? Psychologists?

I expect people may lie, probably typical anti-vaxxers - they're proud anti-vaccine, can't see claiming vaccinated. Who’s gonna buy chicken nuggets soda now? first year bought annual passes state parks we’ve going lot ever before. probably keep up, anything support system added thing do. Polling among vaccine hesitant shown able go without mask one best motivators get vaccine. trying get hump towards herd immunity, one biggest carrots offer that.

Moreover- CDC guidance supposed based science. science indicates vaccinated people risk transmit COVID-19, lie interest furthering compliance- lying destroys credibility. health reasons don’t allow get Covid vaccines? I’ve filled lot vaccine consents older people lots different health conditions listed get turned getting vaccine. here. people knew cared would willingly pulled burning building, willing mask get vaccinated save others. makes sad. realize you’re saying gasoline fire people don’t trust vaccine rollout?

They’re scared view situation lens distrust; media, government, ultimately vaccine went accelerated development process.

You proposing punish anyone asking serious questions happening trying best make informed decisions.

We literally got rid Trump, think good idea?

The solution empower critical thinking information, education.

A significant percentage people unvaccinated convinced easily, nobody convincing them. 
On contrary, people shamed, belittled getting vaccinated, isn’t working.

We experts medical science virology could easily construct rock solid case takes every single question person may safety vaccine account.

How come I’m seeing case released public en masse?

Everything I’ve seen doesn’t consider questions people have, see lot stereotypical “dumbass anti-vaxxer” myths, like myth fetal tissue vaccines, microchips, examples always diminutive unvaccinated whole group lot unvaccinated nowhere near concerned bullshit.

What I’m trying say given importance situation, would benefit everyone resources used immediately bring people in, cannot act like it’s waste time try convince people really isn’t much done convince first place.

We absolutely cannot, must not, dehumanize less informed.

People must educated, job must done educators.

And obviously, inevitable always significant percentage population unable comprehend anything false beliefs. 
But make percentage hell lot smaller work effort put making encompassing argument safety getting vaccinated. well said. want see Americans vaccinated, that's really count right now. perception COVID-19 vary course: many cases came go (thank God) (for example) add little heart 11 contacts phone. 11 friends clients us anymore killed monster. more!

get vaccinated, people. Please fast evidence carrier vaccinated. people (about 10,000 US) contracted covid vaccinated I'm aware single instance vaccinated person infected someone else. farcical many people confused inconvenience oppression *while simultaneously trying oppress others* political means. Actually said along won’t actually know don’t work: mask, vaccines, actual deadliness coronavirus, basically every issue surrounding coronavirus 75 years. point historians look time history without people around alive clouding things opinions. historians nothing coronavirus able study objectively medical advances 75 years future. won’t like hate Trump, Fauci, CDC, WHO, China, players debates going media, halls Congress, public today. book comes out, actual facts coronavirus. then, every study probably slanted opinion conjecture. I’m also fully vaccinated continue wear mask crowds store. used get sick flu bad sinus infection least four times year- last year zero! Already see happening. concert thing required proof vaccination enter.

Holy shit went bad, everyone lost cards, one shot 2, screaming, crying, calling police volunteers asking proof.

Yeah half fucking people agreed fully vaccinated go STRAIGHT LIED thought would allowed go proof anyways! making bigger deal actually is. Naw! really think people lie!?!?! bigger issue individuals even asked vaccinated, (technically) even lie. idiots, pretty much guaranteed yearly covid vaccine. never eradicated, booster shots necessary keep control. Hilarious mean, confessed multiple people, including Tony Fauci, think contributes social acceptability. expert mean practically everyone bigger issue nurses, whether good, bad indifferent, nurses. great skill set, majority probably excellent caregivers. But, they're infectious disease specialists. They're virologists. access sophisticated spread models world. datasets analyze every corner country globe.
 
I'm way suggesting nurses amazing people, really, they're one step mail carrier comes qualifications make statement science decision. cannot wait 1 month wearing masks literally 12 percent USA population get fully vaccinated, don’t know say.

If like 5 million people, might point, 12% huge number Americans. amount would allow us get 50% Americans fully vaccinated.

We already know number people willing get vaccinated nearing peak right now. 1 month wearing masks, actually hit peak # vaccinated population? unbelievably rationale compromise. would still allow date prior major national holidays 4th July. covid goes ultra instinct but, actions affect others. can't mean 'ol government leave alone make choices? 

/s mean, July states enough people vaccinated really matter but, mean still concerned welfare people refuse masks? (Yah get immuno-fucked people, hey I'm one em!) can't really stop people without getting whole nest legal bullshit. Weed stupid. So, sum up, newborn baby concerned safety removed stove house year because, literally, stoves kill maim life hundreds thousands children per year, consider wise decision? Unfortunately we’ve probably hit (or hit) lead vaccination rates. part, people actively want vaccine received it. We’re starting convince people aren’t motivated, tough do. There’s realistic chance never achieve herd immunity vaccine conspiracies/misinformation general antipathy. disagree, think right summer starts kids school things outdoors, speed timeline hopefully we're better position come fall.

CDC isn’t trusting anyone. know (some? most? all? don’t know) people lie take masks even they’re vaccinated. They’re naive. They’ve simply decided risk manageable given far we’ve come vaccines future progress we’re yet make. don't, I'll read Google translated article. Thanks! People completely misinterpreting CDC said want over. Wanting something ignoring reality opposite science.  That's joke, that's good science real life experience. What's confusing CDC waited till got past 50% population fully vaccinated. thought 48 49% turns reading article today like 36%, expert consensus still seems immunity form (vaccines infection) needed 70% population covid become truly manageable.

Hearing CDC guidance come news segment Kansas dealing variant scrapping even pretence mask mandate confusing hell. mention little India parts developing world vaccinated. always confused this. But, emotional support animals? important people mental health issues registered doctor. What’s problem emotional support animals?  one stopping masking up. case going turn another flu like thing everyone going ""need"" get vaccine made guess wether work well every year?

I put need quotes gotten flu vaccine decade honestly remember last time got one. asinine post I'm actually sure posted it.

Children *are* issue infect unvaccinated adults. immunocompromised individuals used taking precautions mean magically unable catch covid. takes one slip exposed. 

The random appeal authority solidifies really know talking about. OP never offered advice immunocompromised individuals comment letting physicians handle even make sense.

Here's physician would say: every eligible person needs get vaccine, one lie vaccinated not. That's pretty straightforward, yeah? New Zealand nowhere close coming thing. NZ Aus last places dealing covid. definitely seen vaccinated people hospitalized Covid even weeks vaccination I’m afraid, aren’t people would normally hospitalized flu. 

More people infected Covid also increases risk mutations, Covid opportunities grow mutate. large, current vaccines cover mutated strains fairly well, can’t predict effects future mutated strains.

My point is, safety Covid population level effort, vaccination decreases risk damage Covid, doesn’t eliminate all.    I’m going Louisiana brother’s wedding next month, it’s little concerning, remember I’m fully vaccinated worried it. Uhh never Said that? Yes, think CDC account this. still very, low risk Covid.

Masking low effort. course, fully vaccinated, one worry point. science says, risk really sick hospitalized death slim. you’re vaccinated don’t need trust anyone. That’s problem unVAXed. many days 1 jab? Including 1 jab patients without providing jab timing bit misleading. 

Like got infected day jab, obviously jab going help them. essentially unvaccinated case. 

For stats include 1 jab people, crucial provide us timing jab paint accurate picture. CDC list credibility last year. Yes, unfortunately we’re getting pressured schools send kids back - schools adamant protecting anti-vax teachers scrutiny saying “fuck all” parents kids.  International news reported UK continuing lifting restrictions week, apparently wrong misreported.. actually happened?  want ""discourage"" foreign travel even though vaccines work known variants lock good 3 years world fully vaccinated? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Why both? Honestly need drop science-speak minute say ""You cannot spread COVID vaccinated"". true practical intents purposes hedging even little bit gives people wrong impression since terrible dealing large small numbers. Actually, chances vaccinated person contracting Covid 5% chances non-vaccinated person. non-vaccinated person's chances far 100%. US, 10% total population known positives. So, average vaccinated US citizen's odds like 0.05%.

This one 2000. trying minimize risk post, accurately describing math.

I fully vaccinated continue safe behavior including masking foreseeable future. state lifted mask mandate March since Rt gone down, along every metric. going disaster people predicting. thought would, wrong. Happily. Large cities close 100%? That’s news me. Anyone teaching school already knew true. ""Oh, Johnny's allergies"" ""we might taken week off, child made trip Disney souvenirs brought two years ago"". Honestly, full capacity events concerts come back, deal masks months. mean I’m ready go, it’s things mask nothing without, I’ll gladly things mask. Remember cdc said masks weren’t helpful afraid would mask shortage? Pepperidge Farm remembers.

Fuck cdc. great, i'll take it. NY one states (along others) probably drop indoor requirement early july point. i'm honestly okay that. Biggest relief able ditch mask outdoors. Even though feel bad unvaccinated kids still wear their's also motivating people havent bothered yet. know two people signed hearing news school work. give shit fellow Americans can't get vaccine yet like kids &amp; immuno-compromised still go stores order survive.

This would different country basically 50% vaccinated. Yeah live 'masks mandatory, unless exempt' signs shop restaurant windows etc. no-one provide evidence they're exempt.  fully vaccinated still wear mask ppl like blend 🤔

I'm fully vaccinated Biden said, ready drop 😷 smile 😁 agree. it’s enough insure public safety. I’m expert also expert, say people lie. Watch let sit freezer sell anothet country profit. average redditor came conclusion, CDC. benefits outweigh risk people FFS. Yup. teachers work complained returning work year. 40% staff received vaccine even clinic work. Listen never said people get vaccinated! live real world. getting vaccinated. now?

Everyone wearing masks forever solution either. Especially unvaccinated already wearing masks. export, think people trusted genuinely honest times crisis.... Okay okay I'll stop, I'm laughing hard. course lying idiots lie. Chill bro, ""bad"" parents kids died, since *I personally* know people mean anything all, fuck sickly children cancer patients whatever. care like least 100k people die kind 9/11 type event otherwise much boring give fuck about. I’ve living reality many people would rather vaccinate wear mask forced mask wearing regulations wanting sticking publicly shamed. I'm expert always lying, I'm telling truth that. Risk reduction attainable goal.  isn’t going made mandatory participate society, that’s thing

I disagree unlikely made mandatory participate society. However, completely disagree choosing treat fact vs conscious decision made society. choosing let COVID continue run rampant give it, there's natural law universe requires case. Cancer patients people suppressed immune systems get vaccinated. vaccines approved them. One would think ending pandemic would incentive enough.

Sigh. WoW raiding guild one. I'm top tank guild. mindset point. I'm sure become new conspiracy theory CDC trying bring back eugenics. That's understating efficacy. 

[A case Pfizer, example, company recruited 43,661 volunteers waited 170 people come symptoms Covid-19 get positive test. 170, 162 received placebo shot, eight received real numbers, Pfizer’s researchers calculated fraction volunteers group got sick. fractions small, fraction unvaccinated volunteers got sick much bigger fraction vaccinated ones. scientists determined relative difference two fractions. Scientists express difference value call efficacy. there’s difference vaccine placebo groups, efficacy zero. none sick people vaccinated, efficacy 100 percent. Unfortunately cannot force everyone get vaccinated. also wish everyone would get vaccinated, live real world.

The antivaxxers already wearing masks. getting point vaccinated people people wearing masks. family member heart transplant, even though shots, still undetectable levels antibodies =/  Exactly. Venn diagram anti-vaxxers anti-maskers basically single circle. 

There’s probably dozen people whole country anti-vaxxers still dutifully wear mask perpetuity rather lying vaccination status. Yikes Americans lie according experts? shit Sherlock…..  Instead “experts say” read: “antimaskers say they’ll lie” aren’t hiding it! quite vocal actually! immunocompromised person look forward wearing N95 face shield rest life 30% population refuses take free safe vaccine can't bothered think welfare others. Truth generally gradient. Would benefit wearing masks months? Yes. people going massless anyway? Also yes. live reality ton anti maskers abiding rules waiting official word cdc ditch masks? I've pretty cautious whole time. I've worn mask wherever required seen friends/family outside done takeout. I'm fully vaccinated would like keep wearing mask indefinitely serve sort example people cautious begin going start see wearing mask, even necessary so. Plus first time months everybody decided stop bringing fact there's almost certainly massive overlap people want get vaccinated people wearing masks anyway. really matter practical perspective go-to lie changes ""it's flu"" ""I medical condition"" ""I'm vaccinated!""? Same, I'm still seeing people outside masks on... kind hope stays way. like see problem is. want get sick less often?? Yeah. two kids old enough vaxx. Wife fully vaxxed. punished letting scumbags run around mask vaccine free?  case would make sense lift mask mandates places low risk...not everywhere regardless high risk 100% sure? That's incredibly negative perspective ignores lot basic biology virus. likelihood happening high. basically made article old megacomment.   problem is, know masks help prevent spread asymptomatic carriers. haven’t vaccinated, could easily know it. could go somewhere without mask spread either aren’t eligible get vaccine, kids 12 showing worse symptoms newer variants compromised immune systems can’t vaccinated. 

Those people continue wear masks, know masks prevent giving someone else prevent getting it. unmasked person carrying COVID breathing disease, spread wearing masks haven’t able get vaccinated yet.

I two kids age 12. non-vaccinated people walking around spreading disease unknowingly, puts child risk. they’re saying choice wear mask store important child’s right store safely. Yeah I'd rather safe. really data prove overall efficacy declining. say I'd wait till happens, I'd back real data. test this? people masking social distancing, people without masks face face? There's little that. ask 2 questions. service animal, tasks trained help someone disability.

Emotional support animals covered Americans Disabilities Act (they really exist back then). Question 3 answers best here: tell emotional support animal exposed enough (line level hotel workers see lot). it' protected ADA call cops remove said individuals trespassing. Yes, ugly pretty, thing that's effective want someone leave won't. fucking shit. I’m wearing mine anyway despite vaccination. I’m teacher kids get vaccinated I’m taking risk vector them. Yes! would think less mRNA safe immunosuppressants rather effective. Like immune system able identify COVID-19 virus can’t enough rally response fight off. lie most? Ourselves.

Can confirm, cant trusted LOL what. can't wait people see entire year change effort nothing.  get immense satisfaction knowing societal response (and Covid itself) caused millions lose jobs never get back, wiped small businesses granted market share larger corporations, enriching already rich making people like even better off. Keep coming don’t understand you’re saying. person worried children *could* literally safer wearing mask around children home making children same. non-zero chance could become infected. (and person you’re going here) arguing mask home? No. point everyone draws line somewhere, “but children” crowd make compromises. unvaccinated doesn’t make carrier virus. infected virus makes carrier.

It mistake assume anyone wearing mask sick. 

Normal, every day human beings “moral hazard”, thinking, feeling human beings cannot reduced simple disease vectors. Normal, healthy adults treated like diseases. What’s more, people diseases less moral likely infect others.

The moral hazard see rise authoritarianism guise altruism. One upside Republican anti mask/vaxxers mostly killing weak children now. yeah.... way see 600 people dying per day right now, literally people chose get safe effective vaccine.

I care lie.  Great believe that, believe experts someone Reddit. people attacked wearing mask. F×cker Carlson urged people confront wearing masks. lady attacked day later guy demanded take mask. course people lie..duh.  Well problem vaccinated people masking “for months” absolutely nothing make difference purely theater. unvaccinated people it, well it’s choice probably weren’t wearing masks outside store business setting anyways. 
Should choice send children public school, choices tangible impacts lives others? schools right require vaccination, like established regimens? Look, us care friends, family, communities (aka others) keep wearing masks washing hands safe. 

Let others wear masks, get Covid die off. Darwinism take care it. 

But us vaccinated people believe science keep wearing protecting ourselves. 

This way, idiots trouble makers die move happier times without lying, cheating ignorance. unvaccinated people lie go around without masks, prolong pandemic continuing spread

Honestly could give fuck point. I'm vaccinated, people know care vaccinated, far I'm concerned, long nightmare finally time get back normal life  I've enjoyed getting flu year, know people still walking around sick. I'm also risking small % people still get sick getting vaccine. recall actually started saying masks don’t help aren’t necessary...because shortage. CDC public health, hard science. vaccinated?

Not symptoms Covid

[Pink real pain ass people need enforce mask mandates certain businesses/places work. employees got access vaccine

Your employees get access vaccine. Everyone North Carolina eligible April 7th, retail workers eligible weeks that.  people excited wear masks??? Personally, quite enjoyed getting sick year stupid yearly illnesses cold flu?? Talking group makes think germ bukkake. still trying answer questions false positive tests people acquired immunity COVID19 via either infection vaccination

if vaccinated test positive without symptoms need quarantine, risk others -- yourself. free wear mask avoid crowds long wish.  Yeah science says we’re pandemic masks help so....... Omg yes! don’t know aren’t campaigns debunking myths. see erring side caution. vaccine 100% effective. saying still spread even risk small, antivaxxers took ran it. Yep, certainly dont disagree that. 

Unfortunately, think SARS-Cov2 going “long tail” we’ve done realistically do, amount tragic preventable deaths likely going continue (possibly years). 

Also amount conspiracy-idiots, fact-deniers disinformation Bots going make next emerging pandemic even worse. would like believe that. I'm 100% sure variants develop come countries spread irrespective vaccination status. might less bad vaccinated folks, immune function stable entity - days bad sleep bam highly susceptible infection exposure. hope I'm paranoid, think :/ Masking protects people.  Israel vaccine passport system. Much easier drive cases unvaccinated people can't go bars, restaurants, clubs, etc. Ssssh! I’m trying start new conspiracy 😉 Yep seems everyday embarrassment part country gets bigger bigger. worry, wasn't. people (including vaccinated people) freedom keep wearing masks avoid social gatherings bitching moaning freedom demand others wear masks stolen them. Good thing trust science vaccines. family vaccinated, worry anti-maskers more. I’ve saying well. 2020 CDC always right must mask stay home, say maybe fully protected people don’t keep measure clearly theater? Oh, wrong! cop out. one saying mask mandates place year. saying, let’s keep another months spread largely gone. 

There’s still lots incentive get vaccine plenty demand it. woman went tv crying scared month ago? Well, one specific group right lie more... that’s always do. even know released new guidance two days ago? 

It's mentioned new report, obvious answer ""yes."" CDC's reasoning vast majority students fully vaccinated yet. 

This consistent previous update says fully vaccinated people need masks places. Heres experiment we'd need do: infect million unvaccinated kids flu, second million covid. data exact study, can't compare them. plenty reason think covid would much worse non-h1n1 flu kids, one sure.  would also like take credit someone else's comment.  hoping article would detail brands think working working People making emotional decisions. Even recent CDC update, recently someone tell attend outdoor happy hour despite fully vaccinated. said understood science, year ""inside"", ready. People change overtime, think light switch everyone. CDC decision based science, again. CDC says page transmissions vaccinated people still studied preliminary results says likely. CDC become political unfortunately. herd immunity forever away, mainly worldwide pandemic people keep traveling...

If wait herd immunity (on worldwide scale) reopening economy never reopen, provide source suffering.

If vaccinated, CDC told relax. spreading COVID others, likely spread you, test positive COVID need change anything unless actually symptoms (they still trying answer questions false positive tests people acquired immunity COVID19 via either infection vaccination).

The best real world data vaccines effective? Vaccinated old people nursing homes shitty immunity longer dying COVID. they're statistically extremely unlikely. flip coin get heads 40 times row, almost never happens. 

They've studied vaccines millions. sources second paragraph reduction superspreaders vaccines (in context mutation)? tried explain friend day I've read claim here, would like official source. Yes...yes do. 

The CDC makes mistakes sometimes. CDC made mistakes pandemic...like early covid tests work initial advice wear masks. 

I know reddit tends respect scientists government humans sometimes miscalculate. think may here...hope I'm wrong. Well physically it’s over, socially hand… oh boy. states children arent exempt mask mandate already? know theres age cutoff, nobody’s checking kids ID co firm age. Wow enlightening read. grateful team hard work, saved many lives.  Honestly, way people circle reacting 7 Yankees players tested positive vaccination get sick really annoys me, basically saying proof need wear masks social distance long haul....And really pisses whether would admit not, they're basically spreading version vaccine misinformation. ""If bad, need tested know it?""

/s vaccinated people spreading virus. small viral load effect others much. people realize this? scared get vaccine? viral load get get going negligible even meet family unvaccinated people get sick. indoors ton unvaccinated people related fault spreading virus them. ones spreading anymore...they are. course lie. didn’t get vaccine don’t intend to, live community that’s frowned on, socially appropriate thing advertise lack vaccinated status shunned. rational thing mask one shuns me.  Sarcasm buddy OVERLY negative. 33% vaccinated population. 42% vaccinated count minors (they can't get vaccin anyways). mess. tempo first show July, 100% sure. oh, say so. Republicans would never lie, would ? MIS-C, blood vessel damage, unknowns long range data. interesting article. Thanks sharing Come u r ridiculous CDC United States mostly done pandemic vaccines. world significantly lower vaccination rate. mixed messaging addressing different groups people. Free-for-all coming América self-entitled selfish I'm really sorry position, must stressful year you, really clear end sight. Haha, good luck that. Absolutely way get 50% population absolutely hates masks wear now. ship sailed, one lady Minnesota executive council said… “the horse barn gotta gotta do”. also think it’s ironic last year every article expert told CDC right, second CDC says maybe fully protected people don’t keep measure makes difference them, CDC wrong. going disaster people predicting. thought would, wrong. Happily.

This I'm at. watching numbers, hope I'm wrong thinking get worse.

I'll still extra cautious young kids can't vaccinated, I'll happily proven wrong watch cases drop.

If me, wife I, I'd lot less worried. point, even miss stuff used do. indoor things we'd (children's museum, restaurants) we're going playgrounds, parks, picnics. strain us keep summer, hopefully things settle even fall. Don’t new mRNA vaccines work guys. know quite immune compromised people successfully received vaccines issues. elderly transportation. People logistically can’t get there. Others medical conditions. let’s forget basically kids. stop fucking selfish. still need protect kids others, vaccinated risk child longer, risk remains generally low due age immunity. clinical trials underway likely children ages qualify vaccination soon. Thanks soft paywall website says literally thing CDC website.

Stop spreading misinformation, encouraging vaccines help lessen transmission ""common knowledge"" set stone making seem, especially sources repeatedly say ""scientists still trying learn well vaccines prevent transmission...""  I’m shocked, say. SHOCKED also get avoid side effects vaccine. Pfizer vaccine ass 24 hours feeling like flu. Much better getting COVID see people would pay money pretend vaccine think whole thing fake anyway. I'm pretty sure that's meant. end day basically going spread virus getting sick either mild symptoms... enjoy life fully vaccinated. making problem worse. shocking news, water wet. Fair enough. I'm open sourced journalism supports claim. appreciate help — looking forward reading it. favorite quote House. ""Everyone lies"" explicitly denied reason. unless they’re lying us… Selection bias. didn’t bad time, you’re less likely post comment it. 

Same reason people like stuff quietly enjoy ton comments things like YouTube critical something  third country believes election rigged. makes government think honest reality? living 2020, think we're expert enough know plenty Americans fine lying. think point that, helpful not, laws already exist many states. They've temporarily overridden public health orders, orders disappear, laws immediately resume. Literally anecdotal small sample size. that's loons thinking, 900,000 thousand people died USA anti-vaxxers still uncompliant. afraid take mask despite CDC guidance you’ve driven fear science reason. 

That opportunity self reflection. shit head made people's lives miserable. 

Your moralizing remove annoying. true! child serious conditions stayed radar long time discovered them. diseases signs easy miss write off.  send young kid back school without masks vaccinations, would get thorough physical bloodwork done first. Lol agenda except see kids wearing masks anymore believe safely settings opinion. Saying available ""in September"" guess like somehow crystal ball ""read somewhere."" Sure, maybe conceivable could September earliest highly unlikely know trials complete approval given. I've fully vaccinated since February, vaccinate kids, followed rules typically vote left. Might want rethink agenda have.  correct, I've adjusted OP specific. Denver, everyone still masked. fine continuing wear mine. course people lie, assholes. you’re vaccinated fear ? Let people make choices worried implications let's ban high fat / calorie / high sugar... Fast food drinks.

If need high fat eat avocado,. taste high sugar eat pineapple

Cant afford 2$ eat healthy afford combo meal? use Kahn academy math skills suck Really? Degenerates willing kill 400k+ Americans instead wearing mask might lie? Whooda thunk it?

Degenerates degenerates. Let lie. they're *mostly* hurting themselves. 

Their existence wreaked worse havoc world. Like voted Trump. TIL I’m expert... Yup whats alternative, vaccinated people show strangers covid cards personal info everytime someone wants challenge? 

I’m gonna wear mask. think people made decision realize this. think possibly around observing behavior average American. wonder even know badly retail grocery customers behave areas, even pandemic: screaming peoples' faces, spitting, etc. 

There lot people lying. Wait i'm confused. point mask [per prevent spreading people via airborne droplets. using properly secured n95 mask, cloth masks little protect you. understand wearing mask double masking decision made safety? people know person said felt little we're fine. Everyone Reddit says almost died. get disconnect.  Except still told socialize except restricted circumstances. Maybe enough it’s enough lot people. need change discussion away whether eh enough whether people wrong toward whatever need see get take damn shots. “right” isn’t important getting people vaccinated powers adequate job selling benefit people. Authorized 12-15 kid got shot Friday exactly said. agree 100%.

You agree stairs fatal danger babies age 0-3. significant number children *die maimed life* stairs *each year*! agree baby gates crucial *literally save lives*.

From I'm sure whether agree, please clarify me:

1) Stairs fatal danger babies, put gates houses babies live, train people live visit use caution around gates baby injured.

2) Stairs fatal danger babies, outlaw stairs buildings worldwide never leave house really, can't sure somewhere, set stairs mowed yet.

Given situations, parents often things create safe environment possible, as: using baby gates around stairs

I'm pretty sure 100% agreement #1 reasonable solution, despite fact *babies literally die year* decision.

But COVID stance opposite that, that's part I'm curious about.  5 year old 1 year old aren’t vaccinated. Masks prevent infected people spreading it.  don’t feel safe take store mall knowing unvaccinated people infect them. nothing life zero risk. I'm surprised people learning is. chance spreading covid unvaccinated individual low worth worrying about. However, little risk much risk choice keep wearing mask limiting trips out. refuse feel guilty wanting resume life 14 months fully vaccinated.  why, vaccinated citizen, still wear mask.  Heard like wearing mask. It’s like shield don’t talk people public. LoL could told I'm dumb fuck. course lie. Lol kidding. countrymen pretty f'd ""rights"" (read: entitlement). you’re vaccinated people know care others aren’t? You’re protected spite? Another manifestation lean supply models stores inventory large brands; essentially selling items consignment. usually results contractually agreeing suppliers certain shelves certain brands. even outside brand could supply TP time need, stores find shelf space place Charmin Quilted Northern shelves sat empty. Mexican brands reached areas, placed end caps front stores. get that. I’m type 1 myself. said, 36% increase isn’t much. (I thought risk multiple times higher, actually.) Looking data, 117+ million vaccinated, increased bad outcome odds 100x emphasis still found going numbers, would still 99% protected. (Only 9,245 117 million got mildly sick. 100x increase risk realistic margin error lol) people wear masks forever fine want that. Many us tired them. 

I’m vaccinated, haven’t heard breakthrough cases severe. lot us would rather risk minor illness wear mask everywhere. don’t think makes us selfish pricks sub make us be. CHOP/CHAZ march. CHOP something different. experts get paid millions extensive research.  tired lazy running narrative. People concerned variants potential consequences dropping masked mandate rooting pandemic hoping never ends. fucking collective trauma genuine fear things taking away progress. mean afraid actually happen rational - read many god damn posts wear see masks soooo detrimental people's mental health, better damn well see respect understanding seen people around die isolate loved ones months end still fear vulnerable people lives traumas. needed can’t public health records checked verify someone indeed vaccinated? Seems like something possible. true unfortunate, passports option honor system is.  numbers that, respiratory viral outbreaks pretty common nursing homes. many patients already bed-bound due illnesses injuries. exacerbates respiratory illnesses catch. hand, majority patients mobile, makes easier contain (once recognize danger). usually ""newsworthy""; happens, rarely large enough scale get media attention. learned volunteered nursing homes. flu season, advised wear mask times within facilities, cautioned certain patients currently sick. prone upper respiratory issues, precautions much benifit, patients.

Edit: volunteer work pre-pandemic. 2000-2010. Getting second shot soon agree. I’m two weeks removed I’m done it’s possible. Making plans summer fall, ditching mask everywhere except it’s required, eating out, going movies....I DONE.

Not interested petty partisan pissing match we’re people won’t get shot. think need experts determine people lie. Could anything leisure business mandatory business family acquaintance emergencies.

I want paint broad brush banning travel, travel, really come absolute quarantine measures. Ah yes, bars clubs, cornerstone economy realize agreeing me, right? there's thing guarantee safety? feel everyone get vaccinated, walk around afterward believing they're completely immune disease.   Yeah man can’t different body chemistries may react differently, everyone’s exact it’s mental thing. expert, already lie vaccinated/already it/have medical condition/having rights violated, wear mask shopping 15 minutes. US 7 day average lower lowest point Jun-July 2020 spike big winter spike! back tests harder come by? need experts tell us Americans lie? CDC hasn’t competent pandemic. it’s terrifying violation privacy. thing send people accidently delete thinking nothing important, fail read thoroughly, disregard like knowing always claim ""must got stuck spam folder"" Since one else mentioned it- sorry loss Antivaxxers antimaskers people. people refusing get vaccine ones weren’t wearing masks first place. sympathy inventory less zero people like this. hell cares? want virus, get vaccine. What's obsession worrying people lie? irrelevant . Lol learned enough year whether trust Americans protect others pandemic Ok still tracking device majority people willingly enthusiastically adopted. shit they'll fucking lie. someone answer honest question, us least, vaccine available anyone right? care someone else isn’t vaccinated are? even vaccinated, chance can’t mad unvaccinated person? don’t get shit they'll lie. Us Americans self centered assholes around. fact anybody believed anti masking twat waffles would follow rules astonishing. People compromised immune systems may develop immunity response take vaccine, risk choose get vaccine. effects idiots sadly reach far beyond lives/households lot people live countries access vaccines. mention aside obvious health risks dog kitchen present, working kitchen *incredibly* dangerous place small dog. still don’t know Biden Administration CDC thinking. isn’t going incentivize though intent taking vaccine. theoretically put anti-vaxxer/anti-maskers double bind? supposed wear masks (which hate) unless they've vaccinated (which hate). So, go unmasked, say they've vaxxed hurt pride, say sticking man assholes (like usual) also chance getting virus. wear mask protect ""shedding"" vaccinated, they'll hate that, too. confusing. I'm good essentially assholes matter do. think really hard predict.  chose pfizer see fewer complaints day day life. knocked completely one day nausea. next day significantly better, evening, completely back normal whipping huge dinner starving.  I'd say whatever choose, time right days off. unlucky enough hit nearly week later, lucky enough still weekend. I'm sorry loss. £25 vaccine card, could go get fucking vaccine free... Curious see coming week's vaccine results be. We'll full week 12-15 year olds able get vaccine, see CDC updated guidelines impact people getting vaccine. serious? virus greater 99.9% survival rate people. 

Their fate????

They’ll fine. promise you. Thank much posting. I'm thrilled able check data via GISAID. probably right *months versus weeks*, hope. think anything wrong that, want keep wearing masks power them. fully vaccinated individual, personally choose wear mask (unless business requirment one) worry whether around wearing mask whether / vaccinated. "" shouldn't"" ""100% won't"" makes air side caution. We, diabetics, 36% higher risk requiring hospitalisation contract Covid Vs non diabetic. still know factors cause people get long Covid, get hospitalised, others die, walk off, immune system already shown propensity bit dick, want chance luck. correctly worn N95 way effective vaccine. immunocompromised definitely consider those. Thank sharing experience long term work home. Yes; you?  incentives able socialise freely enough? wear mask going make difference. People stop anyway. shit shit. It’s people. made new rules ""hope"" people would right thing. Unbelievable.  ""it takes time notify thousands stores""

What email  shit?! Younger people likely experience immune reaction symptoms. taking kid vaccine, I’d plan Friday school let rest watch movies Saturday. well hydrated seems help, maybe grab favorite beverages snacks let lazy day. Experts met Americans. couple friends stand this. said got covid symptoms one day, 1 year old showed worst symptoms, better. I'm like, works. People massive idiots. think lifting mask requirement vaccinated individuals government's attempt encourage people get vaccinated. However, relying honesty people naive. people thus far refused get vaccinated already proven flexible morality. Lying fully vaccinated, already lied ""medical exceptions,"" much stretch.

The vaccine 100% effective vaccinated people still (asymptomatic) carriers carry virus externally clothes person result physical contact everyday objects people. Besides, lie people, virus care claims. headed fourth wave infections US? And, large majority infected anti-maskers anti-vaxxers? Yeah, back lady work argue masks mask policy (and State mandate!), didn’t want wear one pitching fit. 

One arguments was, “well, already Covid!!”

I wanted say figured had, considering stupidity. UK hasn’t opened adults yet, they’re 38 year olds Whatever, two weeks up, care less want get vaccinated wear mask. keep masks on, don’t think it’ll huge problem clear name live Florida vaccine passport option us. Best luck! guess I’m expert exactly person needs get vaccine. got covid already either around lot people spreading it, wear mask follow protocol general. 

It seems antibodies make robust asthe vaccine. imagine know prefer petulant safe. Like child. 

Get vaccinated. ingredients included boxes vaccines? Well stay masks on. still right keep mask that's awesome! think multifaceted, that's definitely part it. lot lower peak pandemic, still high started wearing masks (back spring 2020). feels lot lower since know bad get, pandemic isn’t over.  think learned honor system work people none. gEt PaId, oThErS gEt MoNeY!? Holy fuck, almost choked burger. Oh gee technology would allow real-time lookup national database something… like driver license passport. takes one mutation spike protein... Tax payers money maybe insurance companies…? How? Lol go read it. clearly says safe vaccinated people remove masks. Wireless connection speeds:

25 United States 26.7 Mbit/s

81 Thailand 9.3 Mbit/s

Broadband connection speeds:

3 Thailand 213.14 Mbit/s

11 United States 170.88 Mbit/s

Considering United States’ wireless connection speed much better Thailand’s, United States one fastest broadband connection speeds world, would say Thailand’s internet way better United States’?

Also, United States 9,147,590 square km, Thailand 198,120 square km (the size South Dakota), seems like odd Stupid comment. vaccine available everyone yet UK. Good, let natural selection take fuckin course Dude. Use punctuation. reason. run-on sentences difficult parse. Here’s problem that: immunocompromised highly allergic people legitimately cannot get vax. It’s small group people, rely herd immunity survive everything vaccine for. people get vax don’t, that’s another vector get them. 

Additionally, every person covid infects new opportunity mutate. mutates more, eventually get selection pressure favor mutation infect large pop vaccinated ppl.

Lastly, believe young children still cannot get vaccinated danger allow unmitigated spread. 

Personally, I’m immunocompromised luckily able tolerate vaccine. said, I’m still going wearing mask public I’m groups ppl don’t know foreseeable future. Oh well yeah obviously best means protection. Sometimes see wearing n95, times isn't. definitely knows. getting cold/flu 2020 nice bonus shitty year. Yes  bet I'm sister! sounds exactly like something mine would come with🙄 believes delusions still can't keep straight 🤣  Oh god, thing?

I flu nearly killed september 2019. I'd never sick like before, after. stuck like 3 months. Covid US yet (or say) positive must've gotten it.

Thanks giving different possible answer. relief. addition points others made, there's also greater risk virus continuing mutate bodies passes through. guess that's pretty inevitable point though despite US considering spreading much countries still, considering pass many animals besides humans continue mutate well.  Wait, vaccine passports? yet rules allowing vaccinated people special freedoms? anyone, even single person, think could work??

What's next? 
\-no ticket controls cinemas stadiums, staff simply ask paid 
\-no card PIN required money withdrawal ATM, simply state name much currently bank account 
\-if police suspect committed murder, ask did, say no, let go Society kiss ass. Comparing individualist societies societies brutalize citizenry misbehaving praising latter good one bit.  concerning exceptions unvaccinated kids, I’m actually ok this. main thing get us point vast majority people either vaccinated, infected/recovered infected/dead (herd immunity achieved combination). don’t think society moral obligation protect willfully unvaccinated. everyone opportunity get vaccinated, relaxing restrictions. Seems like we’re there, give take weeks... Tennessee. aren’t even trying, nobody wearing mask. Everywhere went people would say “you don’t wear anymore”. (Yes I’m vaccinated, yes I’m still wearing it). Came back Ohio I’d say 80% around still wearing one. Yes, crazy, right?   be, severe denial claim become politicized. personally wear mask college starts late August, covid nearly dead others wearing masks anyways. However, willing going places restaurant pool friends.  speak someone pays attention current events news.

Obviously don't.  course. I'm saying people care masks wan't get vaccinated statistically likely gotten Covid.  50% vaccinated, expect see 50% people still wearing masks rule change.

I guessing it'll nowhere near percentage wearing masks. Shit, I'm even lie. They're proud vaccinated succumbed farce Covid was.    honestly don’t think move government taking right now. think they’re realizing ICU capacity going able absorb whatever additional surge get. basically saying “anyone vaccinated safe, don’t wanna wear mask you’re putting risk may die. you”. 

I think approaching point can’t continue keep country lockdown forever when30% country refuses get vaccinated. would literally go least latter part year.
I say, even though understand large population people cannot get vaccinated there’s much else do. different depending person. I’ve scheduling flu shot days don’t anything next day, even knocks ass day. It’s still worth it, yes, people really strong immune reaction vaccines, fever, soreness, fatigue, etc. immune symptoms. I'm saying bad thing all. I'm saying silver bullet, hardly protecting them. immunocompromised would feel safer wearing anything short properly fitted n95. think better strategy would convince paranoid idiots need wear masks protect vaccinated people. They're running repatriation flights although there's criticism quick enough. would businesses ask see vaccination card? Yes covid political issue somehow. Fucking scumbag going places like 40% adults vaccinated 99% adults go maskless. KNOW they’ll lie. supported trump, deny reality climate change. don’t believe science education lie almost everything. Kamala runs White House, Hilary runs sex trafficking business. conscience. decency. Zero care humans (see border wall vaccines). scum. course they’ll lie masks. It’s obvious. following science. lie, may get sick die. It’s sad, natural selection. fair, copying pasting heard elsewhere pretty much I'd expected.

Best luck you!   fuck em then! everyone's personal responsibility protect self, choose get vaxxinated get sick die covid damn fault. continuing stay locked forcing masks everyone unsustainable. time open back up, vaccinated great, protected. someone chooses vaccinated choice fault die. earth 5000 years old. recommending third dose transplant patients. US hasn’t made statements yet. common belief undetectable amounts amounts may mean immunity. Even though third shot isn’t authorized US yet, people anyway. I’m anxious speak doctors see getting third shot. vaccine alone enough, according CDC, trust And? What’s percentage people actually fall category?

If sensitive infection, probably weren’t terribly safe public covid. doesn’t significantly change mobility. Yeah, going county like dad's 32% adults least one vaccine shot, yet 99% adults go maskless. Well advocating state local governments establish vaccine passport system. agree that.

Interesting anecdote, four us got second yesterday laughing one guy always acts like he's dying gets sick would one wrecked tomorrow. Fast forward three us fine he's apparently unable leave bed. matter. concerned, get vaccinated. 

Punishing vaccinated bunch anti-vaxxers take masks make sense. pose risk themselves, rest us. 

We've bought enough time ensure anyone wants vaccine could get mean CDC hasn’t built sterling reputation reliability past 14 months.

You're starting sound like anti-vaxxer distrust CDC. CDC, President Biden, plenty level-headed scientists voiced position. time toss masks aside. Lol exactly side feels too. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 game TV show thing...

""We ran tests determined lie! father!"" -experts, probably let's make penalty 5 year minimum prison sentence. Let non-violent drug offenders go, fill clink idiots deserve it. Honestly cares enough people vaccinated reach herd immunity. always knew lot people would refuse vaccine. see different outcome. people take vaccine. contrarion everything. Besides, world vaccinated either. Lines map going stop thing. making monumental effort get entire world vaccinated ASAP Nah could super unlucky get it. really doesn’t take expert.... “Step-vaccine doing?” Redfield's failure unsurprising. Anyone would [claim Aids epidemic God's Judgment bound take reality seriously. promise you, people lie.   really sucks people able protect themselves, least point people dont give two shits ones predominantly punished Yes lie. continue wear mine. people sure, areas, vaccines widely available enough point care unvaccinated people public, get vaccine yourself. 

And y’all take head ‘not everyone get vaccine’ bullshit, walking around unvaccinated mask still risky walking around vaccinated without mask. I’ve done part. People chose vaccinate deserve get back lives.    understand you’re coming from. find concerning people charge health getting new results studies new guidelines ever week. don’t think locking would’ve done much. Many countries worked little. hope confidence CDC restored day. used part government trusted most. whole COVID incident don’t trust all. feel like CDC isn’t prepared deadlier pandemic either. don’t know believe anymore. think enforcement laws going lot different pre-pandemic.

If walked bank 2019 wearing mask, I’d wager teller would finger hovering panic button don’t outright call cops kick out. now, even 2 years, don’t think they’d reaction.

If there’s one silver lining immunocompromised, they’ll able wear masks future without people looking funny thinking they’re rob place. I’m sure someone’s already figured make fake vaccine ID cards  Don’t worry, will.  We've seen people lie throughout simply inconvenienced wear mask. continue lying. opinion. perfect best track record, especially last year. know science changes based data, still remember CDC recommended scarves face coverings pandemic.  Well happen scientist, one employed CDC. trust whoever want.  think anyone's fault own. That's said kicking himself. making assumptions. Right lol, fully believe taken account CDC made call. also looks like seeing many states offering financial incentives vaccinated folks, comment reminded of. Everything fucking crapshoot point, think lot year uncertainty going shape, well, society next couple generations. Guess we'll see. nervous fall, though. know fucked up, i'm crossing fingers hard throwing caution wind going accelerate spread point complete burnout fall. see us getting way. danger kids. Children significant risk covid. get vaccinated rely wearing mask ""protect"" kids. Demand dropping isn’t entirely worrisome: demonstrates reaching saturation.

We concerns people skipping second doses (sans J&amp;J), vs weaning demand.

Once emergency label gone, public employees need get it, reducing unvaccinated masses. already chip? /s trusting nurses non-nurse shit.

Drives nuts people know ask nurse friends medical advice issue have. They're trained diagnose recommend treatments, go see doctor is. Really? vaccinated person going get infected covid, remain asymptomatic, infect vaccinated people? virus effectively spread conditions lmao I’d like see sources proving otherwise.

It doesn’t even matter it’s true vaccine effective preventing fatalities reducing severity infection.

It doesn’t matter even unvaccinated people get infected, that’s risk accepted.

Oh Taiwan Singapore U.S. don’t quality healthcare, vaccine availability. way. main reason wore mask worried parents would become ill risks could lead severe covid symptoms. they're vaccinated, studies quoted articles claim get covid getting vaccinated unlikely wind hospitalized, least now, covid threatening family measles point.

 basically like bit dad tells guy paid bus driver get bus, would go around smugly telling everyone showed bus driver. Honestly pretty annoying. goes show it’s theatrics adjusting back normal world take time folk. “our brains”.

A lack critical thinking skills. don’t disagree don’t think it’ll disastrous. Maybe bit worse would masks really hurt economy? problem economical, take steps reverse policies impact first (social distancing, travel bans, opening schools etc.). Masks really burdensome. went concert night country. Definitely republican territory. single person mask on. Look breakthrough data. There's deaths. 

Why world would belive something like 100%? Omg. People crazy targets. They're red Walmart instead blue. Everyone says they’ll lie. 

No one thinks work. It’s clear relaxation bad idea. can’t help ourselves.

Did experience last year?! can’t trust anyone act anything themselves. Thanks! Blaming Trump Covid-19 idiotic, dems ones calling racist wanting ban travel China. sad, it?  Sure. You’re sad. lol keep making assumptions. That’s you. never said didn’t believe CDC.  still get infected Covid even fully vaccinated? Yes can. I’d prefer cases get little bit lower. That’s preference. Wearing mask inside easy simple. keep sad something effect you. Can't even trust honest reporting facts car accident. making alright progress it. managed keep last month’s pace, I’d right you, drop-off worrisome. They're going term 'transvaxxite' apparently. God hate Facebook much. Well, herd immunity gets high enough, they'll protected idiots, like people get MMR Polio vaccines. time last year colleague Arizona claim virus already asymptomatically infected enough people town trigger herd immunity therefore making unnecessary wear mask avoid risky activities. pointed fact people office cough go around early 2020 testing proof. temporarily banned Facebook disseminating misinformation. Even countries like Japan 99% mask compliance outbreak now. much evidence need show virus spread regardless measures taken slow go store observe many adults masked versus percentage people county fully vaccinated.

Though guarantee differ significantly yeah, rough kids can't vaccinate.

The absolute worst would parent immunocompromised otherwise high risk kid. I'd keep bubbled home. also AZ one given majority Indians know CDC; however, CDC made infallible people. 

It opinion factor children 12, especially children high risk like son. son's pediatric pulmonologist knows son CDC. 

I think CDC wants people get vaccinated. That's great. Work government give money vaccines I'm sure fencesitters would get vaccine. 

I trust honor systems, especially living pandemic rest y'all folks. pandemic shown many Americans selfish, a-holes give care others thus unreliable follow directives honor system. Can't wait insurance companies jack rates roof morons. guidance safe wear mask indoors/outdoors fully vaccinated, except transit. trust science following guidance public health experts relates local laws. People choose still wear mask, judge little bit, like judged “well actually, decision implement mask mandate political move freedoms etc” folks beginning. also know long term effects covid-19 infection.

 encourage look long-hauler statistics UK, nearly 1/5 infections suffered long term symptoms ranging fatigue brain fog body pain. group, roughly 40% said significantly impacts work, 20% unable maintain job capabilities.  Well course people going lie fully vaccinated. one truly care themself. mean let's real people gladly spend money fake medical card able avoid getting free shot knows reason point. 9/11? It’s silly comment mainly people won’t die directly virus, huge spoiler alert: everyone die point. sooner others, whether “right thing” not. order half country braindead anti vax conspiracy theorists Please don’t worry, still ask one. 😂 close enough herd immunity numbers keep falling?  I’m hopeful. asymptomatic carrier spread even you’re vaccinated also factor new variants.

Taiwan, Singapore relaxed rules started seeing huge spikes. premature relax rules now. ADHD gang. meds extra awful checking in.. feeling better, hope? round Sunday news shows major networks, Dr. Walenksy revealed subtle marked shift agency’s emphasis community individual protection. acknowledged Fox “for 16 months, we’ve telling people cautious, careful, cases going up” made clear C.D.C.’s new bottom line individuals could make choices. TV appearances, Dr. Walensky rejected idea pressure public elected officials frustrated year pandemic restrictions prompted new guidance, saying stemmed entirely evolving science shows vaccines protect getting severely ill coronavirus variants also spreading them.  Lying maybe don’t ask don’t tell assuming anti mask/anti vaxers right thing,

That's assumption, certainty.

At point, people like wrong thing *just* spite contrarian. 'doing right thing' accepting nice crisp $100 bill, they'd burn ranting Obama aliens.  confirm. I'm going masking indefinitely. much upside exchange minor inconvenience: (1) Prevents getting sick. (2) Keeps face warm winter. (3) make kinds faces public everyone none wiser. (4) talking pretend Shredder and/or Optimus Prime.  Cool, give extra shot latest Windows update latte too? Rt went places starting March April 2020 well vaccines there. mainly seeing seasonality right now. real test late fall/early winter 2021.

What places US fit criteria? countries? countries mitigation measures place, like closing bars universal masks adults? mean, wear masks school New Zealand, also 0 cases year. Happy look up, hope realize I’m one loons believes there’s chip vaccine?  Props enduring mask usage working out. can't it, tried couple times, going wait mandate lifted work gym again. Why? Masks prevent transmission others. provides minimal protection wearer.

Remember whole narrative must prevent asymptomatic spread?   Well would freedom breaking everyone enforce control anyway...

Sooo lie is. This: lot people still getting first doses.  true. remember wave followup facebook posts antivaxers catching covid lmao decision start thing, whether thought necessary greater good not, undermined long term credibility.

This. still continue wear mask. 

But foolish (politics aside) denounce use mask, even moreso outright saying WONT HELP CURVE SPREAD VIRUS. Therefore part never blame ppl refuse trust anything CDC says. 

The CDC catastrophic harm trustworthiness long time come. one likes cheater freeloader can't convince someone contribute goal herd immunity least silver lining enjoy schadenfreude suffer later. article joke. pandemic taught anything it’s trust people. ""friends"" already said plan lie sort thing. Never mind lung conditions Yeah, choose trust scientists doctors rather random Reddit. know something don’t, maybe drive Atlanta headquarters set straight, sake country…. Masks least obtrusive measure used, think it. Social distancing lockdowns far difficult putting mask. 

I don’t see caution thrown wind (after hellish year). Right fear getting covid? Seems like don’t care getting covid don’t want infect others, getting vaccinated going bars fine right? Easy. Don’t go inside Starbucks then. It’ll pass. know it’s bad little bit. 

If happen underlying predisposition inflammation (ie asthma, RA, autoimmune diseases), immune system little harsh response foreign protein. 

If anything happens requiring emergency attention, please seek. 

I hope it’s soon. “Likely” would mean majority. it’s zero percent, people got vaccine shouldn’t care personal choices get it. think there’s place world sure. healthy active 2* year old, don’t need to. ESP since I’ve already it. saying “likely” ludaaa 5 ‘variants concern’. Thousands upon thousands variants. cute think younger people frequent doctor offices regular checkups. CDC given people warning. friends going put unnecessary risk inside stores real possibility could catch covid right vaccinated right (before immunity kicks in). weird friends. I’ve never seen types people irl. live liberal area. Ya likely die kinda bs lol 33M people know caught 585k deaths. I’m sure number people caught far more. 2 kids 4 years old. That’s easy. Ohio still mandate businesses believe June risk virus mutating impact younger cohort negligible. novel virus scientists made great strides research last 18 months, cannot definitively say evolution store.  black white. many people middle, including adults got vaccinated (eligibility opened within last month!), teenagers, kids, etc. 

So giving middle finger people waited turn get vaccine scheduled appts May fully vaccinated 5-6 weeks.

Are people stupid else able understand policy putting subsets population unnecessary risk could put piece fucking cloth faces another 4-6 weeks give people opportunity build immunity? reason unvaccinated people won’t wear masks. What’s thought process here? Thought vaccinated people can’t spread. I’m curious wear mask Cuomo last 12+ months: trust science 

Cuomo now: trust Yep. spent prob like 6 hours course couple weeks trying get appts mom dad major risk. open everyone Nevada procrastinated worried. Got first jab couple weeks ago, prob 3 weeks could That’s much logical Reddit guy. Get ready downvotes lol. 1-2% high enough consider ""likely."" Compared (effectively) zero chance death vaccinated people, word ""likely"" makes even sense. Wait, mean Apple's new M1 chip Yes. let’s throw camps. mean spread thing? Contract covid infect? thought vaccinated don’t infect others Quite bit restruant shops, wanna get heat. COVID vaccines (Pfizer, J&amp;J, Moderna, etc) prevent majority infections, may case Sinopharm vaccine. nation-wide level no, locally yes. guess though, I'm means expert. True. mainly see going two ways.

(1) masks = one taking precautions protect unvaccinated, people still unvaccinated get vaccinated safety, vaccination rate either increases stays roughly falls get closer closer 100% (good luck even getting 85/90 people understand works either care learn scared thinking unsafe widely spread misinformation).



(2) masks means people stop caring they're burnt ready get lives, get vaccinated, vaccination rate starts diving now. see anything like 65% (at best) terms vaccination rate lot people get sick &amp; die. 

After typing realize might read best-case worst-case. I'm really hoping see option 1 happing, realistically option 2 likely lot closer happens (at least immediate future - I'm still hoping really high vaccination rate somewhere line). kid's school NY got hit nasty strain right moved west back late 2019. Heard friend there, shut school weeks cleaned up.

I wonder strain. 9 10 dentists agree Doesn’t need expert expected tbh I’ve shots- need protect me. ❤️ ""the point American adults ample time get vaccinated""

Many us eager get vaccinated announcement came still ""partially vaccinated"" feel like pulling rug us. work public eligible April tough. Biden, CDC, state governor said ""honor system"" protection get wait second dose. effectively did. 

Although, specifically said everyone continue mask mass transit. think add examples list highest risk activities. Yes, permission everyone shed masks. *no way* enforce lack compliance unvaccinated adults. become endemic unfortunately affect quality life &amp; productivity.

While think COVID going continue circulating while, kinda doubt reach levels substantially impacting quality life productivity. South low vaccination rates, also pretty darn high natural immunity levels. might less secure vaccine immunity, everything I've seen thus far suggests natural immunity still pretty good.

Worth noting majority South done away masking guidelines month, still seen cases decline. Obv, lots factors go -- probably notably seasonality -- goes lot lots Redditors (myself included) predicted  Eh  You’re missing point. good day. Businesses won't. opens many doors lawsuits. kinda thing flu shot. free/cheap many people get it. last couple years I've days feel off. I'm better. Meanwhile co-worker come terrible flu day two later.

You ultimately can't force people vaccinate, endemic nature COVID dictates outcomes be. work lot Anti-Vaxxers highering additional staff inevitable sick time coming reopening.  countries already centralized medical data base. not. would huge undertaking. First dose ok, second dose commission day after. wasn’t bad think COVID though, definitely worth side effects all.

Edit: nobody else household issues guess held news longer needed to, full anticipation people would lie vaccinated wearing mask public. Time deep state release ""Super Covid^^TM"" cares pandemic move christ Source: people Lol preventing deaths incubation new variants would lead trillions dollars economic damage can’t afford encouraging people wear mask mall months idiotic. OK.

Look precautionary principle. Morons like reason pandemic got bad first place. didn’t say didn’t. 

 reply someone saying masks don’t matter even someone unvaxxed anyone get vaccine tomorrow. trying get see people may still cautious. people want continue wearing one, thats ok. long Im allowed wear one people dont look like Im trying attempt biological warfare dont care people do.  vaccine roughly 95% effective, considering many states reaching 40% vaccination rates, I'd say that's negligible risk vaccinated people point. Astrazeneca's efficacy Indian virus variant, efficacious it? Even then, think Europe normal take second BT dose matter everyone breaks rules increases chances bringing new variant abroad. Children medical conditions either self-isolate wear masks keep safe. Well, Duh. suspect lot politically motivated. ones spoken claimed can't breathe care contract virus. Careless regardless. picking quote slightly earlier interview.

I'm important context. suggesting CDC guidance regarding unmasking applies unvaccinated people, certainly not. 

The guidance clearly vaccinated people only.

[I think infographic pretty blunt u dont need fucking expert.

""new revolutionary study planets top medical laboratory says people lie!"" know what's even easier wearing mask?...
Not wearing one. vaccine mask obviously pointless. get it... vaccinated, protect virus? Omg... think it, too. Ugh. I'm semantic satiation moment. 

And one letter ""plait"" ""plain"" pronounced different ""a"" sound. Ugh. proposed improved spelling??

Related, can't stand blonde spelled without e.   since vaccine protects liars dyers? Thankfully vaccine manufacturers lie. dont know New Hampshire today lol Yeah agree, we've seen health care professionals last year provide disingenuous informatiom/prospective COVID. Definitely applies disciplines well. suspect large part politically motivated. Glad hear areas case experience. Data huge number fully vax'd people, hundred deaths tiny percentage. one go around thinking can't happen. bit like husband’s reasoning continuing wear mask work. He’s butcher, mask acceptable substitute beard net, finds itchy unpleasant. So, he’s wearing cloth masks beard pouch instead. Also, “I think it’s probably better breathe people’s food not.” free countries. Even U.K. vaccines aren’t available low risk younger age groups yet.  point exactly. unvaccinated fact get vaccinated tomorrow want. them. 

Also, plenty children medical conditions make high risk. 

I agree problem truly vaccinated people going maskless. However lack way enforce mean unvaccinated people (some choice) exposed. maybe huge issue most, shouldn’t quickly discounted. thing is, masking surely useful pandemic, every little bit helps, far Covid goes, masking arguably proven relatively poor long term solution, especially compared vaccines. US many European countries got hit big winter wave mask mandates place, Japan, country low vaccination rates good mask wearing discipline, able stabilize cause downward trend cases. 

I link it, tweet European doctor stated masks could never true replacement social distancing, best method containing spread without vaccines. concluded mask wearing 15% efficacy rate. Like said, without vaccines every little bit helps, even J&amp;J vaccine 60ish% efficacy rate additional big bonus either making infections mild asymptomatic, something masks cannot do. [knight I've thinking lot feel like best case scenario would employers require masks customers employees wear masks least almost (if truly exception) employees vaccine. done, value whether customer lying matters lot less since work force protected.

I'll discuss boss coming weeks since county yet changed mask mandates, coming I'm sure. already customers asking clarification time signs door telling people still need masks.

I want let people store without masks still several employees vaccinated. Well, ones risk now. reach “herd immunity” take thinning herd. Lmao total lie.

The articles like linked show 30 people across Singapore tested positive virus fully vaccinated, small number within tested B.1.617 B.1.617.2.

Please stop spreading misinformation

In fact, here’s direct quote article 

“We knew start vaccination 100 per cent efficacious prevents severe reactions infections likely reduce onward transmission”

And Indian variant specifically:

“Seven staff two patients among 43 cases cluster fully vaccinated, said. either asymptomatic exhibited mild symptoms, none requiring oxygen support.” absolutely maybe might lie sure. Since mask wearing became thing sick single time. Longest I've gone decades without nasel throat infection...usually get 4 combined year.

Sure purely anecdotal seems coincidental.

I'll probably stop wearing people stop stores stop requiring them....but back mind I'll thinking 'don't dare breath me' near stranger. appreciate saying voices appear growing larger size. CDC left open many ifs I'm going object somebody fully vaccinated going without mask indoors, something I'm willing point medical/science community large comes agreement. 'no shit' report. realize everyone get vaccinated ever? Interacting worth unvaccinated person always possible. long vaccine, fine needs go see another dr that. getting vaccine. Pfizer Moderna living virus risk catching it. Coming Biden, Trump, too. fortunately get vaccinated, care lie. literally addressed also noted communities cases high consider keeping mask requirements, children vaccinated — including everyone 12 yet eligible shot — people compromised immune systems keep faces covered.  permission shed masks everybody everywhere,” Dr. Walensky said NBC’s “Meet Press,” “individual assessment risk.”  might continue wear masks inside couple weeks.

I'm vaccinated, want help continue norm indoor mask wearing everybody wanted chance complete vaccination course. (Obv, however, judge vaccinated person deciding differently going without mask)

I got Pfizer dose basically soon able, barely fully vaccinated. that's despite fact refreshing browser look appointments basically constantly week. I'm sure others took maybe little bit longer find appointments.

That said, I'll probably drop masks couple weeks Also expert, yes, lie. y'alls reactions first dose? People covid generally tend stronger reactions. say *""I wear mask I've already covid""*   Fuck it. Let won't, die. Either responsible wont. There's nothing anyone it. Freaking duhh. Yeah, took bit heard new recommendations realize people risk basically ones choose get vaccinated. (Maybe true areas &amp; obviously people can’t get vaccine.) 

Also, wonder long insurance companies start asking applicants they’ve vaccine &amp; haven’t either charge higher premiums decline coverage. still pretending Chinese data isn’t fake? soon   fully vaccinated, go pretty standard, pre-covid routine. fully vaccinated rural area, urban area, matter. Vaccinated vaccinated. Going soccer game weeks. Cant wait beer hot dog feel crowd energy again! people got virus got vaccinated.
Don’t add percentages together, that’s works. even thing ""CDC vaccine card?"" Mine issued county PA. I'm vaxxed I'm keeping mask. cold flu season allergy season bomb. third Americans Petty stupid ignorant vindictive assholes; hold much hope. thats fine. everyone needs engage. one person enough make sure idiots go unchallenged. time though, can't think country people basically locked homes prevent spread, roads literally broken prevent travel Wuhan quarantine kicked in. might wait while. Children risk though. There's local guy mask reads, ""I'm wearing make DUMB people feel safe"" told still wearing mask, must one dumb people. happy me. said, ""It's choice whether wear mask"", clapped back ""Oh, care bodily autonomy person's right choose want body? going change stance abortion?"" walked away think cognitive dissonance must reeling. full vaccination catch Sars-cov2 hundred times lifetime leading 100% normal life asymptomatic would actually happy. means vaccine working immune system judge little bit

I see would judge somebody personal choice? Like what's harm wearing mask? Good, shouldn't. vaccine make virus magically disappear.  point discovery science new awesome vaccinated. means regardless vaccinated status around you, you’re safe enough covid don’t wear mask regardless. means choose get vaccinated die, well, die. Either ways population society move on. course ideal risk given data seen, cdc determined technically correct. 

I think it’ll powerful message don’t get vaccinated decide leave behind. eligible get it, continue die. vaccinated mostly care. Sure it’s going suck someone situation want vaccine can’t, probably sorts crumby situations going too.

Society moving without you. think message good enough compel bunch people get vaccinated. got stubborn ones, may changed mind anyways. Either ways, aren’t relevant feared, data suggests. Dogs instinctively dirty animals. nowhere near place sanitation important - especially grocery stores restaurants.

My wife two small dogs, take dogs anywhere legitimately welcome. figure privately owned restaurant rules obey go there. often go without dogs. restaurants welcome dogs outdoor patios, want go dogs Saturday afternoon take places welcomes them. lot times servers bring little doggy bowl water them.

We see good number dogs patios also. I'm curious exactly think bad could happen? Yes, dogs dirty, unless wash them. stupid things like roll around cow patties fields. anybody get sick patio restaurant? dogs leap guests leave muddy paw prints? worried about?

By way, agree dogs dirty. Like muddy paws wash paws. Personally allow bed want dirty paws tracking dirt clean sheets. think lot people even sleep pets get sick. think dogs ""health hazard"", cosmetic hazard.

Honestly, think dogs responsible measurable amount sickness general population, something like 1/3 households America dogs 24/7 foot table eat home. dogs caused even 1% owners get sick bad paw hygiene nobody would them. wear helmet flying? fly helicopters even don’t wear helmet. really need reevaluate stances safety you’ll wear helmet reduce risk that’s already incredibly low refuse get vaccine chances death covid much higher.

There deaths covid yesterday US (559) aviation related deaths US 2019 (452). wear helmet riding car you’re 86 times likely die car plane. stop helmet wear fire suit add roll cage car?

You don’t find odd you’re willing reduce chance death incredibly low likely never happen refuse lower chance something much higher chance? I’m saying huge risk dying covid, I’m saying chances much higher death plane accident.   Great job! younger population. reckon hit 90%? It’s looking promising. I've fully vaccinated since April. mask staying unless I'm compelled to, even then, I'll shop competitors force vaccinated patrons wear masks. 

I comply guidance way suddenly disregard it. Really??? Wow! tell show get 8 year old vaccinated tomorrow?? Willing make road trip. Stores got around offered reasonable accommodation curb side pick up. could get stuff, allowed store. course people lie

People assholes forces people business. private person feel like don’t owe nobody answer explanation anything. It’s life choose keep business Thank! Confirmed troll. Give break. think white suburban people least excuse experience usually provide shittiest answers. seems likely me, even relatively robust vaccination achieved US. flu vaccines indication (and may be) also need re-vaccinating people pretty broadly. makes unlikely, view, even US hit high hurdle herd immunity (predominantly vaccines), would STILL maintain avoid reintroduced.

I think it’s much likely low level endemic probably competitive / displacing effect respiratory viruses. American here. haven’t vaccinated, I’m gonna lie say am. EG friend doesn’t car, offered vaccine appointment place that’s awfully hard get lives without driving. So...just go party kid?

Nobody problem continue wear mask take precautions *for family*. problem folks seem think still require vaccinated wear masks, implicitly admission must trust value vaccine itself. also asking society-wide solutions individual problems.

We're discussing elderly anymore wide swaths population. We're discussing marginal cases (and general kids count because, again, risk level there), everyone else wants vaccine get one. Roughly 30-35% Americans definitely lie. anti masker Vaxxers may lie. warned contact vaccinated breathe 5G nanobots. So, better wear mask.  Exactly. could easily done research “clean” anyone vaccinated, avoided hassle double-counting anyone. wonder didn’t?

And really, _are_ saying “we don’t know,” like said another place, good follow-up question would be, “then didn’t study chance?” reason think choice can't vaccinated say, would 12. fortunately, kids 12, really nothing worry science proven far. Fortunately peace mind, science proven hospitalization God forbid death, less .01%. person can't get vaccinated whatever reason again, yes continue wear mask feel comfortable it. God bless stay safe! question is: LIE MOST, DEMS GOP… illness R0 20, 95% people immune, reduce effective R0 1. 

If nobody resistant one measles patient infect 20 others. 95% resistant, one patient infect 1 person. 98% immune, like Massachusetts, effective R0 0.3. 

Missiouri measles vaccination rate 85.8%. Man. Really eye-opening headline.  know bio dad will. know can't trust anyone else. friends sharing completed vaccine cards get hang know we're almost completely safe fiest time year* Definitely agree nullvector. whatever reason, Walmart always goes downhill time feel like Target actually cares appearance stores. Everyone knows they'll lie. Officials know they'll lie too. lesser two evils think though. Vause alternative would checking vaccinatiom cards doors businesses that's gonna cause even issues.

Don't get wrong. Checking cards would preference. understand want go route political perspective  Yep, one get vax wear mask either. America beautiful place. really mind masks - i've grown used them. guidance ""everybody still wear masks"" i'd happy to. now, guidance. Im vaxed, they're telling need socially distance wear mask... so, missing? Trust science they're telling want hear, trust do? 

As compromised immune system - i'd expect would need take extra precautions, like go crowded public spaces wear masks..... foreseeable future. 

And willfully anti-mask anti-vax... again, I'd expect they'll wind helping us reach herd immunity too. friends positive antibodies July 2020, sick since Jan-March 2020. got sick thing family had. think that's pretty definitive. Lol, umm... trolling? given opportunity end pandemic squandered it. They'll need deal risks decisions now.  Thankfully anti-vaxxers pose large threat vaccinated, inconvenience  mean obvious, that's studies variants. Ok, this? vaccine can’t wear masks still retain health, don’t not. Seems fair me. agree you. live area middling well vaccinations, also worst since pandemic started comes case numbers deaths. I'll wearing mine enclosed public places see things pan out. *would* go California ima need wait taxes chill there. go visit Disneyland though, heard nice USA single herd. networks people get vaccinated groups keep virus alive. 1 two deaths still 100% far anyone concerned. Also people like 90+ years old... Exactly, sentence literally contains best incentive. human ounce empathy least...

but 

 “tHe cURe iZ wORsE dISeaSE” peeps

Well objective data safe effective tool crush thing 3-4 weeks vaccine hesitant people rolled selves tomorrow. Bingo. Darwinism finest. You’re clearly responding someone saying drop everyone, vaccinated. Don’t change meaning you’re wrong. seems low  basically, people sensible enough got vaccine probably continue wear mask near future whereas antivaxers (based stereotype) haven’t wearing masks, continue wear masks. won’t get publicly shamed anymore say they’ve vaccine. Sounds good, super glad don’t live America... I’m New York masks still required. People using don’t worry I’m vaccinated light chuckle after. They’re already lying don’t worry. Dang, California nice :) Ever thought joining kind? Migration likewise (Government Vaxed) species may be? would suggest Californian want vaccine. Maybe move area Florida (Non-Vaxed) zone. I’m immune deficient. got vaccine, don’t know much immunity actually have. several hundred thousand people like PID (Primary Immune Deficiency). continue wear mask indefinitely guess. expletive, fuckers lie. need consult experts this.

The established fact virus spread well outside.

Otherwise evidence least year 2 indicates establishing true new normal without stuff took granted before.

Everything still largely nascent regarding research. far many people, especially government, unwilling face reality due economic calamity.

Australia New Zealand, two isolated western civilization countries Earth two handle COVID properly, natural isolation helps anyway. still extreme restrictions international travel longer hold time scientific community observe largest phase 3 vaccine trial history long term effects SARS-COV-2.

You’ve always able take mask actively working machines. think time, depending state’s mandates, enforcement anymore. went yesterday, three employees wear masks all. also numerous members also walking around mask. shit probably complain social media landlord keeps entire thing replace carpet pet ruined it. Hell yeah I’m gonna lie Children significant risk Covid-19. vaccinated immediately eligible. live lol Yeah, proof vaccination travel definitely concern policymakers, window they're longer needed gonna pretty short highly vaccinated country like UK. UK seem strict restrictions right US, still. investment fake cards seems unwise. Maybe, Government selection. Time tell. ask people already Covid included mask rules? Bank lobbies area appointment-only mask era reason.   means approved FDA. Authorized =/= approved. soldiers even required get vaccine. agree. (the scientists) smarter don’t really doubt judgement. However don’t think means disregard threat anti-maskers anti-vaxxers like OP said. Like many others pointed here, there’s still children immuno-compromised folks consider. go Florida. lol Okay reading comments decided agree reading bafoonery makes check unable engage. trying social distance stupidity.  Awesome, thank you. number meaningless it’s compared unvaccinated population. actual studies show 95 perfect effective. means 1 vaccinated person infected vs 20 unvaccinated infected across timeframe. post actual scientific intellectual discussion regurgated nonsense media? That's ridiculous assertation. 

""Pro-maskers"" (I know many people ""pro mask"" sense *prefer* wearing mask) concerned fact way enforce masking unvaccinated individuals. incredibly legitimate concern. 

If vaccine passport system like Israel, guidance fine. don't. never will. So, intents purposes, guidance says ""masks all"" (under assumption someone less likely get vaccinated also less likely continue wear mask, think fair assumption). 

I believe we've reached level spread many states warrants carte blanche removal masking guidance. Many (most?) epidemiologists would agree. another weeks, perhaps will, premature. That's anti-science. 

If lived Bay Area Boston, I'd less concerned. live area high vaccine hesitation, majority adults even first dose, much less fully vaccinated. Don’t care anymore. Used care liars, don’t anymore. Cared caught thing, cared got sick, ..but people killed incessant, childish, bullshit, don’t care anymore. Conspiracy theory: dems want mandates lifted know voters vaccinated many red voters ones suffer consequences lying it. help come next election fewer red voters alive. 

I joking course never know. test positive covid stay home. shit people love outwardly defiant I'm curious they'll find ways advertise they're flouting rules.

They human equivalent ""rolling coal"". worst things could imagine would do. already licking doorknobs toilet child medical conditions make high risk maybe consider bringing places might high risk exposure regardless mask mandate? Pretty good point actually. I’m sure people would take account risk posed kids. don’t think data long term effects virus kids although prima facie view fatalities among kids rare. don’t long term data decency pandemic. I’m sure parents guardians would want risk kids getting exposed virus would want others around mask up.

It’s essentially psychological/behavioural problem knowing around vaccinated, especially country quite polarized vaccine denialism skepticism quite popular. ""Who election?""

Based answer, know vaccinated not.  I'm fully vaccinated I've put away masks good today. wore mask yesterday going grocery shopping, final time wearing mask. next time go public, wearing mask. gonna interesting surreal experience finally go without mask. too. immunocompromised people life want keep safe. People much callous selfish expected be, I've seen things.

They say, blah blah blah flu. add extra virus people worry about? ago UK made decision give people one dose give fewer people doses, right? Back dealing variant like Christmas time? brother law swears Covid diarrhea near beginning pandemic.  hopeful today well, grocery store still vast majority people wearing masks - much me, fully vaccinated, went counter ask disposable could wear one felt place lol. needed microchips, Bill. It’s don’t trust vaccine. Typical Neanderthal thinking matter I’m vaccinated? Maybe look precautionary principle, insisting. Experts? mean literally anyone brain cell that’s outside worked anywhere near customer service?  isn’t one We're going take masks there's purpose it. free take precautions need meantime. 

That's CDC, offer guidance types problems. Additional courses certifications procedures  layman, I, too, agree lie. Idk love watching YouTube videos anti-maskers getting kicked trying explain law There’s difference refusal, hesitant lazy. same. people never going get that’s that. fence, others don’t feel urgency. guides intended convince people never get. They’re lost cause. 2 - there’s hope them. doubt see way that’s way see it. molecules smelling thousands times smaller aerosols spread virus. reason breathe mask Even “Idiocracy” wasn’t dark Like said, I'm going defer CDC rather than, well, you. Also, long ago receive first dose? takes couple weeks first dose get partial protection. don’t see people couldn’t. may enjoy much, certainly isn’t impossible. 

Is guiding public health policy? comfort club-goers?

Don’t get wrong: want business owners succeed. I’m saying didn’t jump head first policy steps could taken first, like scaling back social distancing. It’s still much better nothing. Reap sow all. catch virus go hospital average cost care thousands dollars. Even insurance, guess pays bulk that? didn’t need expert that... oxymoron Man wish never said that, forever feel like asshole every time point relationship number tests number cases good-faith discussion relevant. really think calling wearing mask grocery store work place ""suffering"" bit melodramatic. 12+ months think asking everyone hold another 2-4 weeks would unreasonable. It’s early masks public indoors. wait until
1.	There enough time everyone wants vaccine FULLY vaccinated, including blue areas appointments less available. Many age groups recently eligible states. Also don’t forget people without car access need time. 
2.	At least 50% total population FULLY vaccinated (that means full 6 weeks first dose)
3.	Ideally cases down, idiots stop us achieving summer least keep masks people left 12 older FULLY vaccinated TRULY anti-vaxxers
4.	The ideal would people keep wearing masks indoors public fall 2-11 age group could included. would also crush case numbers even more. 

Obviously it’s fine fully vaccinated people private unmasked indoor parties, public lot lying unmasked people means people still waiting appointments partially vaccinated people forced stay home even may unsafe environment work. people’s masks protect mask. definitely going people stop wearing mask one else wearing masks someone harassing still wearing mask.  trying hard concern troll? Maybe speeding second dose people 50 then. Experts lie hope right. surprised major retailers update policy walmart hopefully they're evaluating follow suit soon.   Honestly European entire discussion 1000% American.

We switched President denied pandemic nonetheless hoarded vaccines President promoted masks entire campaign day 0 presidency abolishing mask mandates effectively night. 

You guys really love extremes. Sorry dont care anything FREEDOM fuck people risk. I’m taking position whether mask unmask CDC exhibited imbecilic decision-making poor understanding risk uncertainty much pandemic. 

I acknowledge qualifications I’m skeptical competence.  know can't take immunocompromised know wear mask demand distance anyone then. Maybe idea morons die off. simply wear mask did. We're removing security WH, Congress etc. We're trusting people try overthrow government. 

Same energy. disagree. often things protect minority people inconvenience majority I’m glad do.

And we’re still mass transit, hospitals, prisons anyways. sure I’m public health expert. guess don’t think it’s worth risk people traveling. still impressive imo downvoted this? thinking political BS CDC would end Trump gone...  news, people wear sunscreen risk sunburn. Keep covid wave going America. going wear mask club?  live NY NJ, understand anger mask mandate lifted even neighboring states so. think we're little cautious side. I'm saying someone who's careful last year so, avoiding travel necessary, obeying masks, fully vaccinated, etc.

I've seen opinions posted community governors likely change mind next week, potentially even early Monday Tuesday, NY already scheduled reopenings Monday CDC's new guidance, CT lifting mandate Wednesday, on. want us set failure, need remain realistic expectations. 

Unfortunately, it'll matter weeks days, look closely Murphy's exact words, said look removing mask mandate *weeks*, plural. Therefore, expectation mask mandate goes two states around time around Memorial Day best, mid-June worst (which NJ's emergency order likely expire, anyway). point, vaccinated, whether others lie matter, it? problem un-vaccinated? worried growing variants? sounds like interested killing kids.  policy allows take mask off. stop everyone driving people without license? Assuming need go full approval process every year, mRNA flu shot could made quickly, they'll time guess prevalent strains. seems problem social distancing. masks problem? Tell people keep bitching moaning thought ""Vaccine passport""  case typical. CDC can’t expected issue guidance relevant small sect population. Whatever choose family makes feel safe never problem.  say anyone gets caught lying gets death penalty get rid least trash. Uhhh, no? plenty reasons people might want mask nothing fear. Stop harassing people choice literally harm you, unlike antivaxxers antimaskers.  data makes look like really fast rate vaccination first half April almost nothing mid-April today (very flat line). Today looks like massive data dump.  Well safe vaccinated go maskless, would cruel unusual mandate vaccinated. would expect backlash. really matter lie? It’s life they’re risking. Want protection get vaccine, don’t, risks you. many kids cannot yet get vaccine risk low.   US three times many cases per million people. US available everyone many takers. UK opening 35s next week demand high.

If unvaccinated would affected, fine. US perfect breeding ground vaccine resistant variant vaccinated unvaccinated population interaction measures whatsoever place.  It’s people don’t believe other. worry unvaccinated people it’s don’t believe vaccine. Yeah, CDC never fucking said people take masks off. Meaning policy results people able take masks off, SCIENCE SAYS know director CDC 14 months ago director today, right? extremely dumb part CDC make announcement. Masks kill people. Virus variants probably will. See happened India Omg cold awful! can’t breathe nose. tested negative Covid. It’s cold. I’ll take it. Better alternative. people vaccinated played rules year punished others may lie... get COVID that’s them. Others free continue wearing mask quarantine needed. So, knew already?

That one dose two-dose vaccine offers far less protection? I’m saying don’t go far. say “yes it’s safe maskless you’re vaccinated”. don’t say mandates dropped not. clearly punting that. take need social pressure unvaccinated changes things. Experts say water wet. Americans lie? 

No way… think CDC didn’t take account? Obviously see compliance rates cool it.  many people vaccinated, matter anymore, right? 99% people impacted, opportunity get least first shot now. always networks people get vaccinated (parts Africa,Asia,South America). one dose provide sufficient protection Ugh drive wild. legitimate emotional support animal talking someone dog park housing dogs. Mentioned dog ESA told mine too. course immediately asked website got paperwork from, fast was, much cost, etc. like “...my therapist?” Ridiculous.

She’s service animal I’ve found whole mix issues there. Like hotels refusing refund pet fee. I've seen people go workout masks long CDC made announcement. People end day going want. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

In hypothetical ""kids young get vaccinated"" CDC still recommends kids wear masks social distance.

The CDC clearly stated VACCINATED need wear masks anymore. big evolution evidence vaccines preventing severe illness, also preventing transmission others.

Plus people fixated masks anyway. work used correctly combination precautions. experience, people forego precautions proper hand sanitation wearing mask good.

And point pandemic really think it'll matter much anymore. think they’ve realized many people vaccine-phobia there’s nothing it, like lady said- “that’s them”. Cool, thanks.  believe primary driver people getting it. brother one wrestle finally get vaccination.   It’s clear CDC says fully vaccinated people don’t need wear masks, unless it’s public transport. 

You’re right it’s states either follow recommendation whatever want, like states mask mandates didn’t CDC said everyone wear masks Currently no, check back less two weeks, answer probably different. I'm assuming point asking specific question 12 crowd cannot currently get vaccine. totally get concern parent child 12 four primary reasons i'm stressing hard it:

1) Nothing stopping parents continuing mask take additional precautions keep children safe. multiple ways get groceries, socialization, restaurant food without even needing go place may infected be.

2) CDC guidance still recommends masks anyone schools daycares, regardless vaccination status. means risk child catching locations literally remain today

3) Covid seem affect children anywhere degree middle-aged/elderly people. last year, 74 deaths children 5 - 14 due Covid. period, 220 deaths due common flu. essence, children least, covid seems similar flu

4) September, expect vaccine available aged 5+ even reduce risk. children. lying vaccinated so.. serious? Get vaccine don’t worry likelihood vaccinated continue wear masks anti-vaxer lie wear mask?

Pretty fn high, right? relying ""honor system"" public places take issue with, guidance itself. believe masking remained mandatory grocery stores public venues long enough EVERYONE chance protect switching ""honor system.""

Then patronize businesses enforce policies deem necessary. Yeah lmao live India (arguably worst affected place Earth) I’m pretty certain could take much year get vaccinated. billion people line vaccines, we’re taking years without enough vaccines. Ha ha ha. COURSE people lie. often ones voted losing presidential candidate. Facts matter. Correct location. say while, yes, survival rate well case severity covid bad, finding children — especially asymptomatic — lots heart vascular issues rest lives. appreciate reassurance, still personally willing sacrifice children Karens think breath enough simple piece cloth. Thank you, regardless kind response. :) USA conserns which?

I mean we're selfish culture telling someone personally mask vaccination may intended impact vaccinations.

A lot people like need appealed selfish ways, change do. point, get vaccinated want to. dont want to, thats problem worry about. small number people cant get vaccinated, guess still careful take risk. Using known intervention (masks) prevent something known possibility occurring (new variants) covid spread largely gone precisely precautionary principle would dictate.  in, masks transportation sector quasi-permanent like metal detectors baggage checks? like honor system middle schoolers....you know liars. submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Edit /; cares Sure makes communication nightmare. try say things people end misunderstanding. Obviously? Please let governor Foghorn Leghorn know obvious. doesn’t seem understand. predict extend NJ heavy traffic two states, make prerequisite unmasking vaccinated. That's also probably they're lifting indoor mask mandate anyone right now; they're reviewing CDC data, using extra weeks develop tracking system. Well see results 'survival fittest.' test weeks. Great theory!

However, know spread covid get positive test. people get tested unless either feeling sick know exposed someone infected. time feeling symptoms, already capable spreading disease.

We're fully vaccinated well. issue wanna mistaken Republican wearing it, real struggle. whats best individual, whats best society.

If get infected may also infect workmates, classmates, family, friends random person line grocery store.

Americans believe everything starts ends individual's right whatever wants.

Other cultures (the majority little planet) believe so.  Definition likely (Entry 1 2)

And that’s I’m saying there’s definitely role vaccine world. I’m totally means. rates covid far high sever someone who’s older yes probably get it. don’t guys say, that’s problem deal with. don’t see issue person freedom chose effective vaccine. disagree, get (as have) don’t worry me. read comment all? I’m projecting everyone. I’ve acknowledged older aged. I’m glad you’re woods! Wishing continued speedy improvement. 

I didn’t redness first injection, second (Pfizer) left ~2-3cm thick red line around arm, starting injection site. Same- nausea &amp; splitting tension headache first. headache became full cluster got light sensitive. Myalgia, mild lymphadenopathy along throat glands &amp; chills wouldn’t quit 10lb weighted blanket. *no fever...* WEIRDEST thing. 

Everything except nausea stopped 36 hours nauseous 4 days. 

I also Behçet’s disease, lupus, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis Graves’ disease. immune system already hates me, feeling would bad. justification still needing masks now... Reddit science!!! Science science that... cdc says science backs don’t need masks, Reddit changes it’s tune fit opinion/agenda. things never change. vaxxers? Kids substantial risk serious cases. risk level less flu. Even height pandemic, many sides agreed send kids person school concern carriers elderly family members. comment plain stupid. 

Nobody saying vaccinated people wear masks going spread large amounts covid everywhere. 

People talking **policy** place supports unvaccinated people wearing masks putting people risk.

There difference science **policy**. way confirm vaccinated people ditched masks, I'm sure nobody would issue that. issue people way check therefore lot unvaccinated people ditch masks too. legitimate concern subsets population **don't want covid**. may give damn them, us do. That’s fine. They’re putting unvaccinated people risk. Honestly silver lining think tons employers move require vaccine. could rely masks distancing avoid issue, forces it. Depends live. I’m one maskiest cities US, one time past year saw guy wearing mask, promptly shouted hardware store patrons staff alike. No, saying perilously slipping along edge cases deaths flat wrong. Twitter Tik Tok whole “Wear mask you’ll look like Republican” campaign making REALLY dislike Gen Z. people taking pics people mask posting online. new variants claiming tear vaccinated people? Every variant that's tested neutralized Pfizer Moderna vaccines; since mutations keep recurring, many epidemiologists guessing there're many mutations occur. can't correct I'm making statement. I'm trying ask question. must failing communicate third person understood I'm trying say. one outside trials vaccinated age 12

High Schools exist separate elementary schools. Agreed, count one customers! it, care? 12 year old got first shot morning. moved away hard science went social science instead. r/wellthatsucks Honestly, point desk apartment good chair, nice view, hammock 10 feet away. whole hot desk office two days week keep going, I’m fine it. Diabetic believe risk condition covid. greatly prefer Target, switch Walmart, former requires masks latter doesn't. 

I get vaccinated order anything different life. thought ticket normal life, head spinning lol wife vaxxed time now. call one waiting for. dying. actively caused deaths thousands people. 12 year old got first shot morning. Interesting they're using word ""continue"" instead ""restart."" schools already followed Thursday's guidance CDC told vaccinated students unmask. 

Do even know released new guidance two days ago? definitely wearing one yard work! help much.

Edited say hate everything else. drive crazy, glasses fog restrict breathing help anxiety public. That's know everyone else around also fully vaccinated, certainly yet 12 year old got first shot morning. Saying ""being partially vaccinated plenty good enough"" wrong alarmist? OK 50/50 using numbers. would punish 50% people done right thing got vaccinated? read back posting? immuno-compromised can't vaccinate, still risk shopping stores next anti-vaxxers? many selfish?  CDC guidance wearing masks vaccinated people, one outside trials vaccinated age 12. Makes sense. Honestly I’m vaccinated, I’m done wearing mask, I’m done socially distancing, I’m done judging people I’m done checking sub ✌🏼out rona people thing behind us (in USA, Godspeed India) Agree everyone given opportunity receive vaccine. people want risk Covid fine geez give kid, sacrificed entire year school play dates protect old geezers, chance vaccine rip masks allow virus tear unvaxxed (and vaxxed) population. new variants will. people see others they’ll stop too. outdoor market today count hands many masks saw total. definitely vast minority. Yes no. What’s worse absolute minority telling impressionable audiences it’s “ok” morbidly obese. Agreed. Let cards fall lie. 

I feel awful high risk people (I one them, depending experts ask) fact is, unfortunate soul can’t get vaccine autoimmune disorder, last re-enter society sort normal capacity. 

I feel bad parents kids well seem like forward motion getting younger Americans doses. Hopefully won’t much longer approved vaccine available ages. hear reserve judgement end- I’m crazy anti-mask person anything like that, I’ve followed every rule since last March. I’m area got slammed Covid, take seriously. Yes, kids zero risk. also believe current admin would allow CDC issue guidelines think kids would safe. previous crew, yeah, I’d wearing like 8 masks said it. (and maybe I’m naive stupid) think current folks wouldn’t data didn’t say safe. that’s I’m super worried. want think good data safe.

That said, don’t kids might feel differently. Congrats baby that’s coming. hard wear mask indoors eating/drinking?

Not hard CDC says vaccinated, anymore. continue something science says longer necessary?

Not sure mean FDA approval. ferment make vodka.  words - terrible bad people playing along. big mask already off, everyone sees behind it. Lol cling alarmism 

People want vaccine getting Absolutely not. That's dangerous. No. fuck em. Let antivaxxers get it. 

Hope TONS fun too. persists, see doctor. 

Is related inactivity all? little mobility work help? Either way, that's starting get while. im saying least start like iceland, finland, norway, new zeland type government.

Its obtainable complete rework system 100%. Also general strike would probably squashed pretty fast via scabs, many issues. 

But yea shits really starting get tough, something give soon,  read it, would realise metrics European- only, idiot don’t need to, you’re vaccinated. You’re safe. unvaccinated? They’re not. that’s them. even real question? Fuck don't.  COVID-19 infections adults ages fell 80% five weeks first dose Pfizer (PFE.N), Moderna (MRNA.O) AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine, according Italian research published Saturday.

This news plastered sub! breed new variations bypass vaccine? Data reported provider administered vaccine state registry, CDC. daily number data reported CDC day includes various data lags. Typically 2 days.  Oh come on. difficult.

I right-leaning conservative generally mistrusts federal government everything does. even 100% confidence say CDC filled people stupid take account. provaxxers full force. people, vaccines wrong. cannot slightly doubt vaccine. Even authority it, still wrong. Lol

We consume second-hand information various news source. somehow provaxxers know better health department Norway. Curious. wear mask trial? hard wear mask indoors eating/drinking? I'm getting it... Constant masking norm many parts world long time.

Might seem smart possible least FDA approval. Ok? Government policy account one segment population. sure got downvote. end, Kroger decided bleed three stores based something government passed union refused compromise all, sure ethics favor either side completely, unless feel billions versus thousands argument automatically shift ethics towards lesser number. 

I like Kroger, care, media almost one sided this, creates caricature issue. concerned government couple fronts. First, passed hazard pay hazard largely gone (we endemic now). used this, governments often show late party. also sick governments taking easy shots risk, shuffle others (in case, businesses pay hazard pay pandemic winding down, politicos look like good guys). Could provide specific study? Thanks!  Yup said .. colds flu .. I’ll continue wearing mask part. good person everyday. Thank you. Several scientific reports wide availability course risk-tolerance personal opinion. risk still feels high, parents welcome keep children home, wear masks, whatever feel necessary.
 
The point risk reduced level longer necessary society whole adjust behavior manage risk. personal opinion personal responsibility. worries. wish body normal many ways isn’t. asthma health issues getting sick truly inconvenience dread much. wish could normal get cold every days that’s me. like whole life. know many people outgrew constantly getting sick wasn’t one them. 😐 Holy shit tell cdc!! new take must thought of. never left house I’m waiting fitting rooms open back up. I’m sick buying clothes don’t fit size thought pre-COVID. investigating new study/report Completely banning foreign travel locking whenever reported case? thanks.  lived lives normal. did, didn’t.

Masking protocols pretty widespread time, I’m guessing people involved vaccine clinical trial would prone obeying mandates. national cdc guidance garbage Ok fair enough, jumped gun there. concern got cold would even worse even still know that's true. always hear building immune system I'll admit idea that's real thing not. Rhinovirus hitting hard right now, know lot kids caught non-COVID colds last couple weeks school (assumption), masked up, including mine. guess main point pushing next illness road could bad understand precautions scientific lol Target even enforce mask policy? I've visited local Target several times past year nobody ever said word mask. That's insane. industry? work projects together zoom email? taxes tho kid risk. Look risk profile anything else daily basis. I’m sure it’s higher Awesome link, thanks! simple. feel like raw numbers make difference. usa Israel 70 percent population vaccinated would feel comfortable. country 2 million unvaccinated one 100 million. dropping going get low due population numbers. things done prevent deaths overwhelming medical system. 7 year old eligible 4 months vaccine nearly zero risk ending hospitalized. There's reason vaccinated people can't forgo masks there's nothing stopping parents keeping kids away major crowds concern. wear masks trial no? Wearing indoors outdoors except crowds vaccinated right answer... people seem largely incapable understanding nuance like ""except."" That's many people found fb saying hurdur masks work"" literally 100% effective you!  Fakenews fake coronvirus hero imagine works? vial vaccine like 6 doses. think people sucking chip floating around vaccine time pull shot? lol. I’m Dallas. went Starbucks today signs down, pile one table. tables still closed though. Everyone masks on. 

I also went Trader Joe’s also signs saw, every single person masks. 

Just observations. Los dos is! Even one shot, Pfizer Moderna 80% effective preventing symptomatic Covid. *Plus*, even though personally fully vaccinated yet, you’re reaping benefits large portion population *is*, far widespread immunity. 

So, combining two facts, chances you, even pre-second shot, coming case Covid amounts anything slight cold (to use turn phrase enjoy another thread) “vanishingly small”. 

That’s meant encourage go maskless discard precautions prior fully vaxxed — all. But, *is* meant positive note people still midway vaccination process *okay*. 

And you’re two weeks past second shot? Yes, move on. can’t responsible people city/country/world. don’t deserve bear burden. sending AZ doses reserved, focus mRNA population?

It surprise did, Suriname far used AZ. Dropping aid isn’t setting manning field hospitals. ridiculous comparison- mitigate risk situations. Risk mitigation communicable disease like covid getting vaccinated wearing mask vaccinated. kids can’t get vaccinated. wear masks, can’t control whether unvaccinated people public wearing masks not. 

This policy created last ditch effort get unvaccinated people change minds vaccinate, it’s sad it’s obvious created they’re transparent it. stopped Walmart today genuinely surprised people went without mask. one maybe...two people one? Like said, kind felt like douche.

But maybe that's good sign. People slow make switch *hopefully* less willing lie say they've vaccinated. Pfizer and/or Moderna vaccines get regular FDA approval (should soon) public universities CA mandate. private universities follow. help boost vaccination rate. state decides add COVID vaccine existing list mandatory vaccines 12 older, would also help lot. vaccine plan issue vaccine hesitancy? part? happy bodies stacked ice skating rinks again? Big cringe. Lol response? Hard say - antivaxxers tend cluster. LOL. sure got ""flippant""

That mask protects flu, measles, etc also protects covid people suddenly figuring 19 months in. something discussed length physicians. infantilize ongoing health issues...let decide wish negotiate world support so.

I friends cannot get this, vaccine, them, literally, another day ends Y. masked ""cool"", bit frequently before. know one friend never seen lips (nor mine.)  


One weird thing noticed hysteria surrounding this. ""active pandemic"" ...sure, relatively easy mitigation. second pandemic lifetime, helped mitigate first (although kinda easier since involved convincing people wrap dicks, mouths.)

Try following science. think so. Texas got lot flack dropping mandates couple months back (Yes, know lot places kept mask requirements) see major surge.

I recall UK started kids go back school folks thought that'd reverse decline cases they'd another surge, yet things kept going vaccination rate hit higher higher levels.

Now, finally like idiots saying (wrongly), like flu. effective vaccines. vulnerable population past 80% vaccinated. COVID another flu. I’d really like see bar graph comparing vaccination rate two states beside similar graph comparing education levels. 

Then pic Pam (from Office) saying “they’re picture”. Sorry, yes, deleted post. thought referring testing vaccinated individuals, also didn’t realize CDC types studies.

It’s definitely possible, quite expensive controls need put around them. It’s possible CDC felt enough vaccine manufacturers already conducting studies similar whatever might find wouldn’t add much information. I'm back forth will. definitely want feel like I'll heavily minority end getting hassled it. also wonder businesses ever make fuss wearing masks? could see business security concerns due masks idk. I'm fully vaccinated still wear one, wonder become less accepted?? Three four-year-olds trench coat? doubt it. Anti-vaxxers maskers avoid shops. sizeable percentage vaccinated population would actually like rewarded right thing. want mask sorry low opinion others. one tens thousands Americans participated vaccine trials fully vaccinated quite now.

I certainly masking anymore unless business sign door requesting it.

&amp;#x200B;

because vaccinating 8 billion people hard  Anyone else remember months ago hoping general population vaccines June relatively normal 4th July? Even (in incredibly horrible worst case) eventually go back lockdown vaccinated ass gonna BALL I’m forced back house. I’ve missed life much. everyone would equally shitt vaccination rolouts letting immune system fight things exactly best strategy. even know many people test positive given people getting tested people testing home? sure looked unemployment numbers death numbers friend. Pretty sure NJ worst covid death rate per capita...on planet. idea national vaccine passport fantasy.

Oh totally agree. never happen country. normal. Google ""moderna arm"". mom second dose - lasted around 3 days. fact flu nonexistent past winter proof masks, proper hygiene, social distancing work. Mississippi still allows smoking restaurants. Wanna go broke? Open vegan restaurant Mississippi. 

Health priority. really way combat that. idea national vaccine passport fantasy. get accident way work tomorrow? chances happening far greater fully immunized person getting serious case covid.

Should give cars walk? Oh wait could get struck lighting also better chance getting serious ICU case covid! I’m Orange County, California senior role, less “work” typically defined done however responsibility had. can’t direct company still perform granular tasks it.

You also keep mind CEO work doesn’t define CEOs. 

Blanket statements rarely correct.  mean say need 70% vaccinated also say herd immunity 70%, exactly far stretch say including it. Forgot it? Probably not, ignoring it, yes are. answer yes. Losing child something wouldn’t wish worst enemies. reason anti-science doubt decision CDC alone making it. Gibraltar Israel still require masks inside there's still hesitancy around removing them, despite 85% adult population vaccinated. England 7% people done (despite opening 40s), still month away major relaxation restrictions I'd doubt would involve scrapping indoor masks too. even England seen going bit quickly comparison rest UK. they, said job tell vaccinated? That's expert scientists think CDC though Thank sharing that. unaware potential risks pregnant women face, appreciate teaching it. hope data made available soon, wish best luck everything. :) Oh really....would mind pointing variant resistant current approved vaccines?

Oh wait...it doesn’t exist 

The dominant variant UK B.1.1.7. nearly resistance naturally immunity vaccine induced immunity. Whether B.1.617 becomes dominant remains seen, regardless mRNA vaccines remain effective reduction neutralizing titers minor.

And again, breakthrough infections *extremely rare*. Less 1%, vast majority asymptomatic, we’ve already means.

Im running circles around it’s getting quite boring saying like enforced social distancing subsequent closures non distanced locations. ones opened since last summer due mask compliance.. Somebody call whammmmmbulance. Vaccine effectiveness least 97% symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, severe critical hospitalizations, deaths. Furthermore, analysis found vaccine effectiveness 94% asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. outcomes, vaccine effectiveness measured two weeks second dose. 

a 94% efficacy asymptomatic infections pretty much means it'll prevent *catching* virus meaningful way, prevent getting sick. can't spread something caught. Nope, gets sick fault getting shot sooner. walk CVS ask it. 3 minutes. there’s another major wave fall they’ll look bad, can’t hide hospitals filling up. act like hiding cases midterms 1.5 years absurd. Ok, low risk? They’re still required wear masks school, clearly there’s expectation reasonably get risk. gain reopening making people happy returning normal? gotten shot sooner. chose get sick. TIL country called Surinam colonized Netherlands recently gained independence. reached peak dumb american. People dating fine. Nothing changed two people date recommendation changes except need mask date go target together...  revenue conversion rates going down, say ""bonds""? probably even lower tomorrow since Sunday’s almost always lowest amount cases week. 

But even promising much 7 Day average new cases tanking US. 7 Day averages hospitalizations deaths also going dramatically, reaching nearly April 2020 levels. Maybe know dont give shit covid over. millions children low risk COVID.  don’t kids honestly don’t even like kids whole situation making sick frustration. cares you’ve vaccinated, still something serious repercussions even doesn’t affect personally right now. wish even waited little longer. I’m disappointed quickly people deciding move consider safe, reality end mandates might even take us back square one even deadly variants. thoughts vaccinated country world current situation? think would helpful US considered Seychelles sort signal take kinds cautionary measures here? strawmen.  forever. negigible covid 19 cases anymore. Look Israel.

There extensive history goalpost shifting comes level covid prevalence would allow us get back normal (""two weeks"" never lasted long), understandable people impression there's section population want wear masks forever.

I'd bet life even every country got Israel's level, there's still people saying need wait little longer. Bonds related revenue conversion rates. What's high stress team job ever had? Shots safe immunocompromised disabled vaccines recommended PEOPLE 12 years old"".

&amp;#x200B;

Didn't get shot? That's personal problem. I’m talking choose get vaccinated, I’m talking literally can’t. Millions children can’t get vaccinated lives risk people don’t want wear mask anymore? Doesn’t seem make sense Masking extra precaution seems rational considering breakthrough infections matter fact fantasy like make seem.

The variants issue relaxing simple precaution like masking indoors.

The Indian medical association stated 9 194 doctor casualties believed fully vaccinated.

Vaccine resistant Covid increasingly likely phenomenon world concerned ""going back normal"" convenience concerned squashing shit good.

A variant ""modestly reduced sensitivity"" Pfizer vaccine quickly become second common infection UK. someone work mess since start pandemic got pissed threw us essential workers bus, again.  


First tried keep us working without proper PPE central county wide plan, pulled back restrictions early, vaccine came prioritized age occupation took forever us working outside homes entirety pandemic get vaccinated. 


This last bit irritated. get I'm going die risk getting Covid low, work conditions Virus could spread overall risk quite higher compared desk jockeys home. want risk long term conditions virus need alert shitstorm heading way ditch work bunker down. Lol show anyone died mask on. healthiest year ever. Barely colds flus etc...   COVID doesnt hurt kids significant number.

&amp;#x200B;

There surplus shots month. Let antivaxxers die, see care. didn’t take long comment age well. BLM Riots

Uh huh. 

As noted many times, majority people BLM marches wore masks. majority people Trump rallies not. People still afraid COVID already go stores. I'm comfortable now. onyl people dont shots ones CHOOSE get them. Let antivaxxers die, see care. certain degree, don’t see shouldn’t? limited business openings social distancing businesses. Maybe there’s hurting economy people need supported government actually believe needs happen already regardless would step right direction  greatly misrepresenting data know it. year's flu season abnormal, thus cannot compared, ignoring let's look rest data neglected mention.

A typical flu season results 60000ish deaths United States. Around 200 Children, .3% Flu Deaths. far US, COVID killed 500000 people, 306 children, .061%. rather stable numbers show rate large sample size raw numbers. 306 sounds bigger 200, numbers lack context.

What context? Well one, .3% flu deaths children working vaccine high uptake. Without Flu vaccine, numbers would surely much worse. Secondly, children account .061% COVID deaths, however eligible vaccine fall, vaccine much effective Flu vaccine, much population already has.

The mask mandate risks COVID reduced several orders magnitude. Remember this. goal COVID restrictions eliminate virus. never was, never be. goal keep cases manageable. out, be.

Also, society seems done risk assessment decided masks Flu season worth it. happening. Stop trying use excuse continued masking. think he’ll get J&amp;J he’ll “done” sooner? realize CDC comprised epidemiologists right? 

That’s they’re center *disease control*

Oh wait...you read one NYT article ran CDC manipulative messaging. 

They originally told people mask a) wanted supply available medical folks b) people didn’t think social distancing replaced masks. 

For last months telling people get vaccine implied still get Covid transmit easily still need mask. folks felt lying. 

We want truth. 
- help don’t recommend use masks won’t supply. 
- think vaccines protect Covid stop transmissions government doesn’t vaccine passports don’t recommend folks wear masks areas lack proof. 
- enough data change recommendations even people lie don’t wear mask would see decline business people trust science wont wear masks anymore. every one 10 vaccinated wont wear mask anymore trist science, obviously antimaskers shop masks arent required. Time tell ""fading bonds"" metric tracked prioritized things like revenue conversion rates. nearly 15 months without issue, I'm curious see change. mean, would basically Children Men type scenario, good. Luckily actual evidence that. same! fast hell getting new signs. wonder many parents vaccinate kids. see way many mama bears social media ""did research""  it’s done

Well, yes, *could* go lockdown perpetuity. Close bars dine-in restaurants. massages prescription. clubs, course, concerts, live sporting events. us religious attend services online. Funerals weddings livecast, too.

Certainly would decrease communicable disease spread ***LOT***. 

Should that? mean people comfortable putting people’s lives danger, really kind people want look support thank you, that's happening Ok long antibodies even last? Went Wal-Mart today 25% unmasked including ourselves. surprised given area I’m in. 

It nice. one gave us shit, I’m certainly begrudging anyone still wants wear one. you, I’ll me, everyone make personal choice point. 

Assuming someone maskless anti-vaxxer, someone mask living fear....it’s dumb. you’re vaxxed, want fuck anyone else thinks it. Empathy feel good, sometimes need let people hit rock bottom enabling them. punishment. never really one members public willing abide mandate it’s lifted regardless. Strong, accurate.  really get it. data people participated trials last year showing vaccines less effective right now? mean, first ones vaccinated. indeed getting infected right I'd say yes, he'a right. Otherwise, know already need boosters? prominent German virologist said either get vaccinated catch virus. Things get messy get better. Yes.  Cuomo straight sociopath see doctor antibody testing. us months either little antibodies. studies say 3-6 months say 8 months longer. However, idea severity symptoms (once infected COVID) impact amount antibodies length resistance COVID would develop later on. Basically, 100% immunity.....for anyone. It’s Russian Roulette others it’s not. It’s far better medical opinion vaccinated actually it. I’ve seen 98 year olds tons health problems fairly well. I’ve seen 20 year olds went ICU. One family friend turn 30, runner (not marathon type runner) 3 kids 12 years die. Everyone educate unbiased, profit studies. Then, see TRUSTED medical professional talk person. Get 2nd opinion necessary don’t go news, FB Aunt Edna’s telephone advice. 

Sorry Aunt Edna’s there. random name, swear! People need stop ""back square one"" hysteria, vaccines work variants announced many times easily tweak resistant strain comes along. people want go forever  Looked comments thread, haha. certainly one! Again, misrepresenting facts completely. know plenty point vaccine efficacy.

The chances getting infected vaccinated slim. April 26th something like 9000 breakthrough infections united states roughly 100 million vaccinated individuals. That's .009%. 

Also get infection, viral load minuscule even unlikely pass on. chance? Sure, like chance might get struck lightning leave house. fact likely get struck lightning get breakthrough infection. 

You epidemiologists fear mongering, misrepresenting VAST data vaccine efficacy. 

Just stop. go mask think Publix gonna checking vaccine cards make sure you’re ok go maskless? Looool. Bubba aisle three breathing hard cough “doesn’t think it’s Covert” Wendy rounds corner, ready breathe in. Well, based comments thread, I’m one learning country called Suriname? gotta remember there’s loud minority people genuinely enjoy following restrictions continue follow long scientific evidence shows they’re longer needed Nice, three kids don’t pay books. Thanks bot, maybe activate sarcasm detection mode next time ? I’m higher Ed. They’re allowing telework Fall semester one working completely remotely unless really unique situation. Right would certainly call current rate vaccinations ""rapidly"" 1 million vaccinations per week population 17 million. Yea, squashing pandemic.
Everyone low income countries says hello None exist. Papua, Netherlands blame USA, one want join Indonesia, thing Timor Leste. time period WW2, USA try promote anti colonialism try make every European colonies set free (the thing happened middle east encourage Brit get out) Perhaps tad bit early we’re hitting hesitancy wall might hit higher % quickly. change guidance also part combat hesitancy. Showing people “can” get vaccinated Stop trusting nurses non-nurse shit.

They nurses, narrow field view. True.. CT  2026 current prediction many epidemiologist low spread. However, vaccination rates remain lower 70% US, prediction never. something modeled, probably been. threshold vaccinated rate virus continue decrease even zero controls. Maybe there, maybe aren't, know CDC guidance referenced anything expected spread everyone starts going maskless. anyone point study expected spread based vaccine rates I'd really like read it. Rapidly word would use describe vaccin programme right now.. roll extremely slow Yeah - skipping vaccination one hole dam vaccines. 

""Well need COVID one...so kid *really* need polio one??"" always going bad idea. why, UK, heard news, knew would never - we're cynical.

Unfortunately, alternative tell everyone stop, rather tell everyone carry on. ongoing foolishness - stark exception vaccine roll-out - Tories' handling whole thing. Except didn’t quite remove burden responsibility us.

The anti-vax don’t face consequences decisions CoVID19 care still 100% covered insurance policies.

Keep 100% coverage vaccinated young kids vaccinated, back old cost share everyone else, let insurers charge risk insuring non-vaxxer.

That fix all. It’s way fix behavior capitalist society, make people feel FULL responsibility decisions. wake May 2020 morning? PA adopted CDC’s guideline moment released. Northeast states taking times. guessing UK citizens. Articles seems scaremongering me. long quarantine monitoring protocol observed, keep control.

Now, mess quarantine process, thats government.  I'm going say CDC messing COVID, literally took year, multiple white papers handed various credentialed experts, recognize primary role aerosol transmission plays spread virus. Even website still pages updated stance. 

If CDC recognized aerosol transmission soon known, would much different place far as, let's say, OSHA regulations mandating certain protections workers. behind 8 ball many times pandemic. anyone know topical immunosuppressant eczema would interaction vaccine? That's be. Positive allowed board flight world. Period.

Australia's solution perfect. Yes limited flights, still better Canada allowing 0 Canadians in. &lt;Vietnam watching one person *take mask* order sneeze cough.... think Nurses focus making vaccines mandatory profession (minus medical conditions course). Far many nurses refused vaccine. ""Mainland China reported 12 new COVID-19 cases Friday, including first local transmissions three weeks, national regional authorities said.

Four cases local infections eastern province Anhui, linked case, surnamed Li. State media reported mass testing carried two cities province, Luan Hefei.""

None confirmed cases Anhui vaccinated. Good them. Gonna go cdc one. time talking public health, relates actually do, do. 

Are saying one discuss public health sub? not, can’t discuss whether people wearing masks?  Yeah, certainly case well. sure relationship Netherlands Indonesia currently is, say anything it.  not, supply still limiting factor.   popular narrative reddit, that's why. Why? rate almost whole EU. Again, layperson, expert, believe feeling strategy going forward vaccinated going contribute spread much, one group longer group concern.

The second group folks whatever reason cannot vaccine, allergies one ingredients vaccine immunocompromised, though medical reasons well.

They take precautions stage, think CDC lacked clarity explaining choice mask different before. move cloth paper mask real NIOSH N95 readily available. 

I friend Filtration Engineer designs air conditioning filters living, granted medical expert, always felt N95s even improperly worn mask choice vulnerable groups soon manufacturing capacityhad caught demand.

He ever tells folks vaccinated strongly consider using NIOSH N95 instead paper cloth folks wore COVID-19 prevention prior.

At point layperson cannot say exactly is, things need change, restrictions need relaxed, guidance needs updated etc. 

I also add reddit, folks going retorts, part deal here. Personally, best level headed posts, also remember many many people real world kinds misconceptions daily basis easy see someone might say continue wearing mask like. Germany redlisted UK CDC makes decisions based science also political influence. 2020 perfect example that. unwise blindly accept them. many scientists taken surprise sudden change msk policy? data needed vaccine efficacy simply say vaccinated safe cases. That's irresponsible could cause outbreaks. misinformation. research. Many articles discuss need exercise better caution. interest, know working shit covid situation position Australia, going repatriation flights? Higher R0 mean something infectious. Polio shed 3-6 weeks opposed Covid's 10-14 days. yes one person might infect people, slower less contagious proper precautions taken. Also, yes possible spread large droplets, main pathway infection aerosolized like Covid. EU like 70% Pfizer-BioNTech, 20% AZ, 10% Moderna/J&amp;J. Pfizer expecting vaccine ages 2-11 got first shot Pfizer disappointed, don’t hear Bill whispering ear able connect wifi networks, 5G 7G. Another *year*? remotely justify that? listen anyone made outlandish statement.

Look, masks never silver bullet anyway. Studies shown 15-20% reduction spread, half population vaccinated working *much* better. People like masks look around see everyone wearing feel safe, always stopgap measure vaccine came along.

Good guy Netherlands saying “unvaccinated people go maskless risk me, even though I’m masked vaccinated:” solution? Wear masks forever? I'm dropping masks based science, wish getting guidance tied local vaccination rates modeling rather assuming people choose wear masks choosing remain unvaccinated. Like, numbers show community spread likely keep dropping without regulations 50% whatever number vaccinated, let's use determine drop mandates. Right states half many vaccinated adults others. risk calculation surely different states. Every adult wants least partially vaccinated within 2 months.

!RemindMe 2 months idea downvoted. right. force people go get vaccination wear mask.  too! excited. We’re ten days. tickets last year use year. goooooeeeees. don’t know you’re getting downvoted, you’re right. doubt CDC ever announcing time “unvaccinated take mask off” majority anti-vax going unmask pretend they’ll never get real green light know they’re going cave get vaxxed. expert also say people lie tested 636 people Taipei yesterday. positive rate That’s good hear ! That's half point. Target anything special called ""several rungs above"" Walmart. Walmart, little less ass showing. That’s outside, mandate dropped... OK. they're one rung then. Inee tarjay fanatics dont like that. 200 UK vaccinated 19 million people time took Netherlands vaccinate 2 million.

We cannot change past went. focus going future. Currently, Netherlands vaccinating quickly US UK makes sense, behind. importantly, goal set Dutch government actually quite realistic achievable given supply demand (~80%) actually th US July 4th ambitious goal. Currently given 7.2 million doses biggest problem RIVM wanting use excess vaccines age groups. Instead vaccines went bad. Finally GPs took upon run website show extra vaccines available.

I agree RIVM support program GP's. think vaccines actually going waste large amounts. Know one story GP Zwolle, bit single story GP made mistake well. Currently RIVM also system. vaccines left, tell RIVM ""vaccin makelaars"", pick vaccines redistribute them, thus left vaccines going waste, even without prullenbackvaccins July goal supposed April goal. continue on.

I sure correct. Never seen it, could send link source? knowledge goal always finished vaccinating (fully vaccinated) adults mid Q3. could seen vaccination strategy document. never changed, looking current models, looks like early Q3 instead mid Q3. earlier expected. since March started explicitly say vaccinated (first dose) every adult wants beginning July based new models. Also goal never changed newer models, closer get that, realistic goal becomes higher expected deliveries. realized going start immediately, thanks tip! ugly comment. worst case scenario mutates way vaccines ineffective. happens globally, couldn’t also happen West again? 

Virus spreading like wildfire nations low % population vaccinated, couldn’t theoretically result variant vaccine resistant enough cause problems? numbers numbers. Links provided anyone read them. Nothing misrepresented. 

Yes, unusual flu season. unusual thing many people things CDC recommends prevent flu.

These measures work. Asian countries, standard wear mask ill crowded places prevent transmission viruses. that? No. right. America, accept certain number strangers die wear masks.

Good luck, stranger. Yep. Even people wear mask malicious, many follow crowd. ""oh, everyone's wearing mask, better too"" without. Believe 99% people scour reddit details, live lives need to, get things done. half wearing mask half forget theirs, welp, they're going make effort go back car go grab it. would suggest? vaccine hasn’t open kids 12 long enough get two doses. even close. article never explicitly touches it, based number women narrative, can't help feel sexism within scientific establishment also played role. “People that? go stores lie?!” us can’t safely get vaccine due immune system disorders.  would think virologist immunologists CDC better understanding current situation based expertise general biologist specific area study.

You can’t enforce masks either. countries discourage foreign travel, year now. Doesn’t stop people traveling. database everyone got vaccine in..... -_- Us non experts say thing. Look medical exemptions arisen nowhere. normal times kids school? concern CDC apparently transition period stopping masks specifying vaccinated people, public going ruin plan lying status. Without guidance, people could simply reigned via universal mandates. hope CDC believes plan robust bad faith actors, might risk yet another surge. I’m Oregon relaxed mandate too. Went Costco last night within first 30 feet seen half dozen without masks. Whole families too. close closing store pretty empty. asked worker asking mask people door vaccine, say yes allowed in. Better still, sick pay stay home. nurses shouldn’t stay silent everything forever every nurse vaccinated. 

Ah, gotcha, see saying now. totally misread intent original comment think letting kids talk them? Cause kids can’t get Covid unless exposed it. N-95s respirators available now, saw Home Depot. someone immunocompromised don’t barriers protect themselves, wear better mask. ...they though?  think majority will, longer strange thing. Beforehand saw someone mask, might stare bit point out. Now, people take much notice. new virus pop somewhere, imagine good 30-40% population start masking regularly again, even government advice. agree w/ 100%. 
A. Remove symbol ""oppression"" rallying cry. people love outwardly defiant I'm curious they'll find ways advertise they're flouting rules. Probably Facebook.
B. prod leisurely getting vaxed reasons asked walk around w/ people know prob lying status. people probably wondered point vax everyone masked up.
C. also obvious message choose get vaxed face consequences personal decision. come people eventually help us meet herd immunity one way another. emotional support animals also known pets.  trying find studies seeing vaccinated get infected. vaccines 90 % effective, still get infected, Pfizer Moderna serious cases still clear enough viral load spread know infectious disease works, reading Monday sounds pretty fun me.  flu vaccines. think confused. Immunocompromised people exist. Well implication we’re past point matters, it’s individual assessment risk, adults month get vaccinated people risk months more. mention we’re past prospect another wave. 

The CDC weighed decided risk posed doling power beneficial led unvaccinated people go maskless, also entices vaccination normalcy everyone without risk surge. understand why, [look Table 2 describes limitations study reporting outdoor transmission. single one reports reliable, apart transmission two-people conversing outside hospital Shangqiu:

Incorrect. outdoor construction site transmissions study typical study limitations would absurd call unreliable. Politicians politicized virus pandemic. result they've pushed propaganda constituents absorbed willing act break rules it. Hell people can't trusted Obviously. people still buying vaccine fearmongering.  100% This. Since clean bad thing? decree Jesus  economy doubt. Kids low risk getting sick COVID, still good carrying transmitting virus. takes orders magnitude higher viral loads symptoms.

For people kids likely experienced fewest times sick life kid turned 6-7. little petri dishes spent last years giving every kind transmissible disease neighborhood point temporary immunities lock. vaccinated felt risk dying disease great chance. fully vaccinated 97% less chance comfortable moving on, lying vaccines going hurt anyone 97 times 100 liar say roll dice see many let weed population way herd immunity. (keep safe compromised ones great risk) you’re teaching kids smart live entirely without risk? Ohhhh yea dude particular prob shouldn’t get vaccine problem science says vaccinated people drop masks. Instead, happening many places (including NC, live) mandate dropped everyone, vaccinated not. CDC recommended vaccinated people drop masks didn’t address fact zero way enforce that. way make unvaccinated wear masks require general. reply keeps getting removed containing high quality information I'm loss why. I'm molecular biologist tell post incredibly negative likely wrong. that, allowing mutations could potentially make vaccine less effective.  4 year old gets sick conspiracy theorist someone doesn’t care, it’s fault? Love it. Dr. W CDC doubling Week. 

Q:What unvaccinated?

A:Get vaccinated get sick.


Q:What Yankees?!?!

A:It shows vaccine works asymptomatic could spread virus.


Q:Why soon?!

A:A major study published says vaccinated people difficult time spreading virus.


Edit: word word course.. best summation remember. Mandates dropped, businesses communities maintained them. brother family worn masks social distanced since start pandemic, plans get vaccine ""until know side effects.""

At least they're taking precautions seriously? What's frustrating daughter wants vaccine allowed.  🤣😂 news, water wet! even play game? go data. CA tier system thats based positivity rate, daily new cases per capita, ICU availability (collectively known ""the science""). Vaccination status completely irrelevant. ""the science"" says ease restrictions...we ease restrictions. Simple that. I’m still clear goal is. children able go public without interact mask-free anti-vaxxers? anyone serious concerns children’s safety due covid, means, keep bubble vaccinated—that’s right parent. outcomes easy less severe even catch vaccinated. 

The difference going hospital oxygen staying home small fever, still big difference. time self admittedly wanting 'feel safe' 'show others I'm conservative' rather based scientific reasoning

I've saying whole pandemic. insignificant amount people, following CDC guidelines letter showing member specific political group and/or feelings safety safety others.

I'm usually downvoted say this, bring guess. Scientists don’t know jack shit virus vaccines. don’t even know long vaccines effective they’ll effective variants. political move. 1 million(ish) per week, per day. start slow, things sped significantly, continue so. live area comparatively wealthy high educational attainment statistics. seen one person store last 14 months without mask. state lifted mask mandate midnight Saturday, I’m keeping close eye happens now. fully vaccinated. continue wear mask places business, I’ve also enjoyed single cold flu last1 14 15 months. 

I tend agree. past week, I’ve pretty pleased new administration handling pandemic generally vaccine roll specifically. now, given one prove vaccination status, going excuse hesitant anti-VAX community spread other. Darwin laughs beyond grave. Here’s hoping don’t spread Enough vaccine resistant mutation emerges.  Except everything heard dropped mask mandate businesses communities not. there's that. Maybe. Google say sure number lol. unable leave house matter mask mandates indoor social situations not? That's lot deciding caring people serve problem. Go brother. Get served little people take mask only.... consider people’s health. 

I consider feelings. 

I care making people sick. 

I care making weary around me. 

Those two different things. 
You’re absolutely pathetic trying demonize me. response comments like pretty much boiled ""get program, pal!"" feel concern.  exciting. kid that’s getting speech therapy zoom (he’s 2!!!) can’t wait person/maskless education resume.  CARES?  I'm calling inconsiderate literally refuse consider people serve you. Maybe take issue rings true hurts consider might bad guy  Here's couple extra tables.

Notes:

* Data [CDC vaccination demographic Texas (\~9% US) excluded CDC demographic data.
* 12-17 group 2019 Census estimates: Assumes 0-17 doses given \~34.3% ages 12 17. Vaccine authorized ages 12-15 May 10. good portion Anti vaxxers anti maskers can't afford shop whole paycheck anyway.

That said, I'm fully vaccinated, shots, two weeks gone by. prefer shop stores require masks simply because, quote Dr. Gregory House, _Everybody Lies_.

Short requiring unequivocal proof, relying public right thing has, part continue fail. I'm sorry, odds vanishingly small. Especially since teens create better antibodies. never understand restricting children anyone else.

Adults .04% chance testing positive vaccination, many weak immune systems. vaccinated 16 year old going spread covid catch unvaccinated person. vaccine multitudes effective mask. better wearing N95 24 hours day.

If want teens get vaccinated, incentivize way icentivized adults. Possibly lowest risk.  vaccinated put force field around you. still get disease carrier. prepare immune system ahead time combat disease, need figure fly.  FYI looks like comment posted twice  Yeah time repercussions anti vaxers one get covid. I’m sorry didn’t realize data covers 5-20 years post covid effects. Would like share us? Yeah, we’ll never get point. think CDC really screwed here. think purpose get people vaccinated allow business everyone vaccinated open run without masks. I’m happy see businesses near (grocery stores drug stores) keeping mask mandate now. Problem is, major competitor drops mandate, they’ll well fear losing business. 

With masks, concern taking 7 year olds Target grocery store something, I’m sure sucks often quality time Dad weekends. We’d run errands fun things like park something it’ll cut time me. provider didn’t even bother little cardboard CDC things, entered medical record.

Shitty provider then. Gonna pain ass track ever need show proof.

The good news is, we’re stop giving shit vaccines masks since vaccines available everyone, someone wants risk lives unvaccinated, that’s them. never trusted American People telling vaccinated people wear mask. dumb decision caused people get vaccinated. 4 year old able get vaccinated soon enough. then, follow local guidelines help prevent cat aching illness. Including wearing mask. hope serious. kids. also read understand statistics, went back school soon reopened. course you’re correct. 

[Here CDC Director Rochelle Walensky saying Meet Press morning new guidelines issued without counting vaccine mandates. 

They’re going honor system know people lie. science backs anyway.

We don’t know better top health experts world. city went 99.5% people wearing masks store 50% day CDCs announcement. whole vaccine honor system joke, even consider thing. Better kept mask mandate hit certain vaccine % nationwide.   Well, know reddit is. Whatever fits narrative  patriot morons going free-breathing everyone’s kids now. Experts right That's one thing people seem missing. one person vaccinated mean everyone else chance yet. one hell time get 75+ year old parents late March first shot. rolling decently last weeks everyone else, there's still ton people unvaccinated even willing get it. It'd one thing could walk clinic pharmacy get shot spot, still case. There's still backlog appointments many areas. mention opening 12-15 year olds couple days ago, still need make appt week out. Way premature IMHO. saying like applies minority population? I'm 20s, work want things, seeing effect mass spread India, I'm willing give luxuries bit longer. peoples lives. last sentence bad affected privileged thing say. shoes, doubt youd willing accept it. compassion man. silly scientists... frequented subreddit get educated!

So spent year yelling begging, trust science! soon scientists don’t agree stand don’t know shit driven politics? sound like conspiracy theorist! Underrated comment. understanding incorrect. vast majority people (99%) get vaccine get able transmit covid. emphasize variation Pascal's Wager. infinitely better get vaccine get vaccine wrong.  True, pandemics going thing. west spared earlier SARS epidemics passed Asia. guess lethal viruses would probably stopped earlier (like Ebola) host dead. ones spread much airborne. whatever learned masking hand washing helpful. also hopeful mRNA vaccine technology. 

At end day, needs accountability China spread due lack transparency. next country origin hopefully sound alarm immediately. Even now, countries need vaccinated everyone's safety. can't vaccinate US expect completely safe. heard school ignore treat process natural selection? 

People dumb enough lie spread people also deceitful. wrong here. less absolutist solutions that. example, vaccines aren’t approved children 12 yet, likely within next 6 months. Delaying relaxation Covid prevention measures age groups approved would address issue. (I’m epidemiologist, I’m throwing numbers sake example that’s “mandatory masks literally forever”) news: water wet. assume community spread low everywhere. live border Idaho, think vax helped us plateau holding steady number metric originally set. virus devastated small town Republic here, US huge country. important consider regional issues reading comments. expand. People stretch truth. Hahahahaha live liberal area everyone took masks, social distancing seriously 80% adults vaccinated. There’s large outdoor nursery that’s always busy weekends. Last May went every single person masked. Today 50% masked. felt like relief go mask less see others well. know it’ll take time felt like great step towards normalcy. Dont adjust pay though? There's absolutely 0 chance CDC account people lying vaccine status. likely thought vaccine rates high enough proceed, plus people getting tired restrictions. may agree decision, c'mon they're dumb. No, I'm not. CDC respected organization. disagree announcements undo work. Well that’s strange literally place enforced live, degree actual effectiveness, RiteAid. 

None Kroger’s went bothered enforcing it. None restaurants went *could* enforce it, tried. It’s region-specific. Go mile outside city you’ll find one wearing masks place enforcing them. problem. Turning scientific data political shit. I'm fairly liberal, everything class warfare. Get yourself. hand, maybe good time natural selection job Well there's also culture soldiering putting it. would need change too. mean that’s nice I’ve teaching full time throughout whole thing haven’t sick either, actually see students’ faces nice. Take immunology course. Go learn something. simple solution require people show vaccination card. idiots wont get one treated like stupid, diseased 2-class citizens. Doesn’t really take disease expert know people inherently full shit? Doesn’t really take disease expert know people inherently full shit? Doesn’t really take disease expert know people inherently full shit? mind true emotional support animals actually trained; bothered people brought pets misbehaving, using people actual special needs shield protect entitled asses. Lots “People going lie vaccination wear masks spread variant put us back square one” talk morning. matter. really doesn't. people want us keep wearing masks also ones got vaccinated. people refusing masks whole time also ones never getting vaccinated. Vaccinated people shown transmit catch virus, wearing masks accomplishes nothing. Meanwhile many people getting tired masks seeing places still enforcing masks past month two now.

The US never going hit herd immunity. 30-50% population ideologically opposed getting vaccinated. Unless we're going force people get vaccinated (which definitely ever happen) serious enforced vaccine passport program (also never going happen) we're done pandemic we're ever gonna now. People abuse ESA rules bring pets everywhere pieces shit. ruining many people actually NEED service animals go lives. 

Dogs belong grocery stores, restaurants, etc, unless absolutely NEED help patron disability. 

Ok, come downvotes... I’m vaccinated, I’ll keep wearing masks perpetuity means straining breath dirty creeps everywhere. Oh guarantee lie. took statement CDC mean people stop wearing masks. Like willing us said vaccinated people stop wearing masks. vaccinated going love mask free shopping experience. Yes, mean ugly human. try harder.

Dealing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among health care workers  FBI badge (female boob inspector) also say people lie. Denver area here. shitty mall yesterday 90%+ walking around, people without middle age white people I’d assume antimaskers anyway.

However went restaurant 50/50 people standing around waiting table. staff given (not blame them).

As someone 5 year old it’s strange grey area :/ wouldn’t given week warning upcoming guidance changes?

On hand, would kind weird say, ""Vaccinated people wearing masks safe today, Tuesday.""  lifted mask ban work fully vaccinated first person see without one someone know didn’t get vaccine store doors mine long thing printed door could come without mask believed something needing it. thought 48 49% turns reading article today like 36%

48% first dose number. 36% seems right fully vaccinated, track number less important me. forget us still waiting appointment one passing judgement. stop judging others them? actually overstating based article. highlights vaccine efficacy based healthy volunteers represents likely maximum effectiveness. is, fact, effectiveness vaccine sample studied sample perfect reflection real world. Real world effectiveness LOWER published efficacy might work properly people article says much: vaccines typically lower real world effectiveness trial efficacy. fam/friends fully vaxed hang w/? NYT “The science quite clear this,” said Zoë McLaren, health policy expert University Maryland, Baltimore County. Mounting evidence indicates people vaccinated highly unlikely catch transmit virus, risk “is definitely zero, it’s clear it’s low,” lingering concerns among scientists even vaccinated person might carry virus — perhaps briefly, without symptoms — spread others.

You’re thinking WHO.  #ConfidentlyIncorrect official database. gonna believe antivaxx people think fine asymptomatic.

Never trust anyone dealing entitled assholes like fucking pandemic. think they’re compassion. doesn’t matter 90 year old grandma 30 year old lupus thinks. feelings? live knowing world hasn’t blessed holy water spews mouths?

Until get virus. it’s fault trying. might call that. call something else entirely. One reasons able without major changes significant portion population normal activities, mask not. Many people leave houses unless absolutely necessary. go stores times entire year. think underestimating many people removed vectors almost entirely. Well Well Well,who's conspiracy theorist Well, yeah. That’s problem making mandates vaccinated people, non-vaxx aren’t going sit around wait guidance makes feel discriminated whatever. Pandora’s box open absolutely wearing masks. lot stores, museums, libraries, etc near good enforcing it. security guards door don’t walk without one. take inside, asked leave. every place good, many were. Local social media plenty lists places weren’t enforcing it. people opportunity go places know others would masked. that’s gone. started wearing masks CDC mandated read international news obvious airborne. fact told us wear masks announced airborne affect trust them. area live even close majority vax, feel like we're cyclist begins coasting finish line celebration right passed competitor. think decision geared towards psychology many Americans seem oppositional defiance disorder. That's good hear. oldest niece (16) able vaccinated two younger nephews not.

Personally don’t want risk even mild case Covid. Personally? Nothing, vaccinate fast try give incentives people actually get vaccine. applies countries them. vaccines effective, miracle I’d say. got lucky. need vaccine already got Covid though?  Yeah expected stay home forever lol ever say that? absolutely false. vaccine prevents covid ""The evidence get, appears it’s unlikely vaccinated person transfer virus someone else,” said.
 vaccines especially effective preventing asymptomatic disease, Chin-Hong said transmission Sure, both? spent many years office environments every employee generous sick pay every year people would turn sick would watch infection move building weeks. 

A bit enabling bit behaviour change might right mix? They’re saying doesn’t matter people lie it’s decision require masks. It’s community’s decision. They’re basically punting this. need trust you, there's plenty evidence. line reasoning ignores families young children can’t yet vaccinated. example, son asthma young vaccinated. basically means, among things, longer take store me. also means gets singled wearing mask nobody else is. couple weeks heads-up would’ve nice instead springing us like did. Plaid style decades. going anywhere. Woopsie that's typo. obviously meant per week. Thanks. can’t many others won’t. It’s waste time me.  guy/gal diagrams. Stupid app. Sorry! problem shouldn’t argument. Masks probably trivial inconvenience think faced pandemic we’ve lost collective minds it. Think that. folks saying they’ll sit wait see vaccine? It’s excuse never will. clinic trials hundreds millions doses proving safety effectiveness isn’t enough, never be. We’ve completely lost soul nation people won’t take part free, easy, bare minimum measures protect work together get back normal way life.  promise lie. dead ass tell whoever asks medical procedure socially cast brag it. Nowhere document say 90%. pulled ass without reading w/ acknowledgement many kids remote year.

But that's true every state US true every country world. Yet demographics fairly similar over. 

Plus like kids age demographic much stuff remotely hiding others wearing masks. insurance premiums. tax bill.  Poorly worded post title, Americans honest lie, nothing unexpected here. Huh... thought everyone super duper honest everything (like mail ballots) that’s last election super duper legitimate? hypocrisy staggering is, called Ludicrous Speed! whole family Sears Covid 2 back '87 FAT CATS took away American businesses moved manufacturing China. Hell, think brother Doug still shed   Yeah. good points difficult consider you’re particular situation. hadn’t really considered this, honest. I’m vaccinated, I’m gonna keep wearing mask make sure everyone can’t get vaccine remain safe. dare someone test choice remain masked. AMA credible enough actual fucking cases lower now, mean can't start edging upwards, especially communities vaccination rates willfully low. Case point, look India, declining cases surged like crazy weeks, still 175 million Americans unvaccinated - compare 33 million infected within last year, still room surge. read. document provides estimates multiple sources. one agrees subject. CDC works 60 countries, staff U.S., even staff respective countries carry work, working ministries health partners front lines outbreaks occur. - source CDC.gov honest, people longer trust experts. thinking this. many people (percentage) aren’t vaccinated might immune caught CV19 last year?  mean it’s something least. what’s “total adult presumed immunity” area? 

I’m vaccinated month now. I’m eating indoors cafe first time year. feels dangerous wrong. I’m customer here. going take lot adjustment. Atlanta United game last night! people wearing masks except stadium staff. recently went target guy without mask said kids vaccinated. Sure....  Still: I’m gonna trust anyone claiming make broad assessments rest country act based Texas hit season bad last year. take genius figure out. COME ON🙄 Well me, don’t know believe anymore. I’ve lost lot confidence CDC. don’t think anybody knows including CDC we’re really dealing with. CDC switched positions topics constantly. beginning, said pandemic control 2 weeks lockdown enough stop spread. open up, covid still spreading like cancer. CDC comes says wear mask they’re pointless you’ll touching face don’t work. say work wear mask. come say stay 6 ft apart, change opinion say 6ft may may work virus spread x amount ft (I forgot number). msm starts questioning effectiveness, safety vaccine produced Trump produced short period time. CDC comes says it’s safe point Biden president msm supported vaccine Biden Trump. FDA says J&amp;J safe vaccine. people got blood clots died J&amp;J vaccine say it’s safe. week later study say it’s safe. CDC says still wear masks vaccinated. say you’re fully vaccinated wearing mask outdoors indoors okay. couple weeks later say you’re fully vaccinated, don’t wear mask outdoors indoors. 

Basically I’ve lost trust CDC tremendously joke organization well. don’t know believe anymore virus don’t think anybody knows fuck going on. know something deadly came US, we’re fucked based response people government. I'm glad.

You look around sometimes, far Covid, starts feel like sane person left field people put selfish wants ahead real life death needs others.

To see another person trying giving beacon light trying, fucked time, particularly others shouting treating like I'm unreasonable stating seems, least, obvious. worth token effort save lives children, number kids saves far less important intent act, lacking intent says us people.

I appreciate you. No, Pfizer Huh, TIL. would’ve assumed title held Florida Arizona since ton people retire there. think CDC hoping showing vaccinated go lives encourage hesitant go get shots. apparently haven’t realized folks want entire time anyways. problem logic though,.. individualized-risk.

it now.

This I'm sure I'll ever stop wearing mask public. I'm fully vaccinated, know half population still I'm really worried go much percentage. Variants real concern, even vaccinated. Look Texas Florida—no mandates haven’t seen uptick cases predicted “the experts”. Maybe population states hasn’t met scientific definition herd immunity, don’t think it’s good sign they’ve opened that’s case? Like maybe overblown normal, healthy people little worry need destroy middle class course year? Well cares everyone wants get vaccinated people get vaccine still wear mask socially distance want risk equal less non-related activities children without concern, i.e. eating new foods, living home steps, cooking stove use home, family history cancer, etc. There’s much protect somebody doesn’t want protected. course don’t disagree high level, masks truly trivial inconvenience shouldn’t big deal wear one still compromised among us. boomers want get covid die let thoughts exactly. Businesses won’t ask proof basically change means quarantine means social distancing mandates done with. Surprised governor (NC) said mandates gone mention needing vaccine wear mask whatever. 

The positive thing means experts probably think death case rate really good spot enough herd immunity vaccinated people covid antibodies. basically think waited safer knowing would open floodgates. end businesses mandate want good imo even reading posting?! 

“Assuming reproductive number SARS-CoV-2 (R0) 2, vaccine effectiveness (E) 95% ,19,21 herd immunity threshold vaccination critical level (Vc) would estimated 53%. hand, assuming transmissible variant becomes predominant, R0 5, Vc would estimated 84%. means 53% 84% population would need vaccinated COVID-19 achieve herd immunity prevent continued transmission virus”. 

The last section. conclusion study. 

53% current vaccine effectiveness. 84% potentially (not yet existing) transmissible variant. Please please read. Absolutely lie. good news is, endangering now. Self-correcting problem. also pass kids become asymptomatic carrier.

THIS PROVEN

PLEASE STOP SPREADING MISINFORMATION Thanks, honesty best policy 😎 seems nearly impossible enforce. honestly think recommendation effective way end pandemic America (ignoring potential variants outside states fucking shit up). worldview impossibly individualistic. allows ""stop living fear"" crowd whatever want, rest us choose get vaccinated keep masking up. Obviously demographics stuck middle can't get vaccinated/have continue masking. them, would offer idea hopefully anti mask/anti vax idiots get wish let immune systems jobs, shit sooner. Republicans lie. It’s do. Already seeing people lie.. may overdue announcement rushed surprising state businesses create guidelines. It’s presented poorly emphasis vaccination lost message masks. Anyone identify anything though won’t engage troll. reaffirm reasonable precautions parent:

Thanks Lying kinda normal here. look dating culture. Ghosting lying considered norm even vile. trusted science suddenly change mind?

&amp;#x200B;

If getting rid masks causes covid spike, hasnt happened 28 states repealed mask mandates?  **At least** 50% higher official toll, 5 million. probably bit That's true study, extremely concerning given much world relies vaccine. There’s amount factoring testing prepare adequately bottomless selfishness people we’ve seen pandemic. Also, reasoning you’re fond using simply mental justification give shit. Let’s real. Nope. wearing mask   Yup, know several people already lying vaccinated. gone far get fake vaccination card and/or vaccination passport. know others claim Covid need vaccine consider exempt. Well already accelerated that, didn’t we? commentary I’ve seen suggests vaccine helps virus mutate build immunity it, similar bacteria mutated time resistant antibiotics. sure! Hang there, man. mandates gone eventually. not, definitely job seeker's market.  mom already admitted went Home Depot without mask vaccinated :/ Congrats. least admit selfish Yep, we’ll survive. wish others understood  live fear stupid people, especially anti vaxxers. want kids around healthy kids, ones prone measles polio Yeah agree. point US, nearly everyone risk vaccinated wanted to. cares? ease restrictions let everyone thing. think wear masks another months.

That sounds arbitary decision CDC made, happens another months (July? August? September?) makes dropping mask mandates reasonable? vagueness much CDC's public health guidance failure. Sadly, don’t trust people all.  Unfortunately really indication “vaccine passport” get lot blowback. Hopefully still becomes standard healthcare field though, especially since they’ve hospitals years regarding flu shot. Luckily got this, 2nd dose 20 days. World famous provider. Track down, bring app is.

  use ""official CDC seal"" figure one notice? making vaccine card crime, using official logo it.  

The officials changed rules aware people would do, care.  Lol, yeah, could see someone saying tell still physical layer cloud head explodes their.

Oh blissful must live world computers appear form ethereal magic. seem surprised science-based organization changes recommendations get new data lie, hurts them. Non vax people still going get Covid, that’s consequence pay ignorance. continue wear masks protect them? swear variant-hype journalists trying churn ad impressions. 

The vaccines work, wow shocker 😴. Worlds best scientists billions funding wins again! two kids micro schools entire pandemic. unmasked, entire school size anywhere 4 students one teacher 6 students one teacher. lot instruction occurred outside helpful. know situation public schools different think extra steps elearning essential protect students families public school setting. 

That said, big reason opted micro school wanted small size, concerned effect masks would kids. years increased screen time seen children losing ability read facial reactions interpret them. might seem important, something contributes empathy. kids 5 4. extremely important time social development. want keep people safe, think may downplaying downsides kids experiencing throughout this. 

At one time necessary evil protect people, risk kids far lower drowning, choking driving, even height pandemic. example, 2016 around 4000 kids died car accidents. would argue seat belt mask, it’s really. potentially real social emotional consequences constant mask wearing think consequences downplayed. 


I sure feel cdc still requiring masks school now, frustrating hear many people say masks kids big deal breath talk know long term consequences covid. also understand long term psychological consequences isolation long term social distancing mask wearing. Seriously, people want get vaccinated lie it, know businesses going enforce rule requiring proof vaccination hard implement employees trained security police. USA, best incentive seems obvious me.

Cash.

$50 cash given anyone completes second dose Pfizer moderna, single dose Johnson &amp; Johnson. Cash! Darling, ever get idea? healthcare worker. Yesterday saw 43 patients, 33 COVID treatment testing. 78 days ago. never happier! 

The problem *won't* last. grieve refuse vaccine. pray live this. facts coming countries make think otherwise. infect cannot vaccinated (children, immunocompromised, cancer patients);

Those individuals/families continuing precautions anyways regardless unvaccinated people (per guidance). one saying cannot continue masking. rate breakthrough infections

If they're vaccinated count towards breakthrough counts definition. Even so, 0.008% chance infection, hospitalization, infection vaccination one studies CDC based decision early last week. probability new variants

You need high spread crank probability variants realistically. Yes could randomly happen, enough people vaccinated spread minimized good vaccines variants likely crazy spread among remaining unvacced US anyways forward. Besides, every variant far completely covered vaccines. second finding led last week decision. 1 surprise us? Yes. 1 neutralizing variant occur herd immunity too? Yes. also tweak vaccines boosters finally needed. Can’t just.. ask see vaccination cards? last two years taught world nerfed enough. vaccinated. Don’t wear mask. don’t care anyone else does. It’s simple. Jesus Christ people. Duh Lol,

In Canada ICU's officially 100% capacity pandemic even started. 

Hence system collapses 30 extra people admitted ICU city 1 million. I’m fully vaxxed store policies still place individually, keep mine wear see mask signs it’s nbd don’t want make grocery store workers life miserable they’re still enforcing company policy totally right.

I plan masking future I’m sick anyway, shockingly low flu numbers year showed us really way, going forward hopefully lot people start seeing as-needed hygienic measure.

Also fucking keep whole strangers staying 6 ft away lines. Love that, please let’s forever many willing uphold biggest lie recent history, refuse vaccinated, makes think wear mask? loved one can’t vaccinated? worry then? way, expected, good news! low chance mutations happen resist vaccinations, reporters love bring possibility, clickable headline. Venn diagrams don’t overlap less depending what’s circles. circles don’t move. stay shape even nothing one circle. 

The Euler diagram though. Seems like good reason continue wearing mask. 75% 1 4 chance get variant exposed. odds high me. made claim ""long covid observed \~ half pediatric cases"". incorrect deceptive. need actual evidence convince anyone bothers read article. fact good study mean need accept bad one fact.

&amp;#x200B;

Anecdotally, 14 YO half sister returned school 3 months ago. school require masks. 95% school 400 kids got sick. None still sick.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The evidence shows COVID nothingburger kids. likely die suffer severe illness normal flu covid. less likely catch adults, less likely get sick, much less likely spread it. big deal them. 

&amp;#x200B;

In case, paranoid feel free keep child home.  No, know they’ll lie.

Gotta get immunity one way another… Sure, edging upwards much different surge. India less 5% population vaccinated plus lower rates natural infections, comparing US India isn’t best comparison. 

Is room localized increases cases? Maybe, places low vaccine turnout, aren’t likely many restrictions mandates anyway don’t really see much difference cdc guidance makes.  what? Quarantine ever?  Well it’s hipaa force someone disclose medical information. Precisely. boggles people keep using “people going lie” notion it’s invalidates CDC’s decision. 

People seem forget CDC isn’t bunch academic epidemiologists rather bunch highly qualified epidemiologists infectious diseases experts who’s role help shape public policy regards disease control. completely aware people might lie, they’ve simply analyzed data weighed potential outcomes determined responsible, enforceable evidence based positon take. NAUGHTY WORD AUTOMOD think need realize, people 18+ vaccinated never going get vaccinated. science says vaccinated go back normal, wait won’t follow science. Better analogy demanding kids wear helmets 24/7 since fall stairs lol Dont need expert figure one bud Yeah. :( Ummmm shit Insane what?   kid eligible get vaccinated yet, anti-vaxxers could spread her, so... ""experts"" mean ""fucking everyone"" Well someone distant family supposedly died blood cloth getting AstraZeneca vaccine. also overweight pushed hard sport playing died. call BS blood cloth vaccine. it’s like AstraZeneca US doesn’t even matter lmao. Walmart Amazon would like personally thank government care attention public health.  bar last night friends masks, we've vaccinated. single person wore masks. There's way every single person vaccinated.   I’ve never understood people refuse wear mask. It’s simple thing protect others. would ask virus wearing one? would take risk? Haven’t seen half million people get sick here? watch news? ( I’m using term general population). would care family getting sick? whole thing baffled me. hassle wear mask. fact, felt great winter, really kept warmer. didn’t get sick, cold, flu, upper respiratory infections, Covid. know probably never got measles, mumps chicken pox? Cause got vaccinated kid. friend sick year shingles. got vaccine. people death wish???!!! nothing burger article. realized saying ""some people wear masks"" going translate ""we're done wearing masks!""

Pretty sure know made announcement.. bunch amateurs reddit see potential issue, think pros would too. people could trusted wouldn’t mess begin with

If *Americans*, try pin everybody else.  Yes trump president. think influence CDC saying? LOL... kidding. shit  masterful cherry picking avoid cognitive dissonance I’ve ever seen. Bravo. I'm saying, brother gets sick, nope, fault society's commenter implied. fault getting shot. Tell take personal responsiblility. Look Texas Florida   college, interned company software developer required long sleeve shirts ties everyone (real fun St. Louis summer). heard, recently basically dragged kicking screaming 21st century updated dress code policy business casual (khakis polos men, sure women). Seems one really wants work wear shirt tie work somewhere else wear t-shirt jeans.

Same thing’s going happen here. I’m deciding two offers and, things equal, one requires mask one doesn’t, know one I’m choosing. They’re going find want require masks permanently, they’re going sweeten pot huge pay benefit incentives one’s going work them. relied symtoms.

But many scrofula patients actually simple case auge?  Everything I've stated rising variants, transmissibility, waning immunity backed epidemiologist studies, research submitted Lancet, NEJM research. fear mongering. going magically disappear vaccines suggest. People really need cautious optimism right back started last Fall/Winter. cannot discount variants could spit India. incredibly reckless disregard that. that's fine. walk dangerous path, ignore scientists peer review question. That's fear mongering. That's making sure conclusions backed sound data. this, unfortunate. Look concept exponential decay. know blips happen fact it’s still going down.  know people lie, know covid skeptics wear mask probably shy gathering together outside mask-requried places like grocery stores spread amongst anyway. 

Everyone get vaccine asap, ubiquitous walk pharmacy places, mad scramble over. really excuse. point vaccine, unmasked anti-vaxxer probably going give covid form, close 0% chance give symptomatic case without wearing mask. 

So us fully vaccinated need wear mask really protect us much, protect conspiratorial, conservative, lazy walk Walgreens get shot? fairness think one reasons delayed recommending masks selfish pricks going buying truck full. Medical personnel hospitals literally able get beginning pandemic. OK people concerned kids going unmasked people going at? understand. one thing essential workers jobs day exposed regardless kids be? Schools daycares SUPPOSED enforcing mask policy still. I'm saying lives need hold, know plenty people done activities kids whole past year, close knit groups friends play with, took camping woods vacation last year since theme parks closed. kids want McDonalds, get drive thru go sit park house picnic. Things done without isolating locking away like Rapunzel feel guilty. need get creative. Even whole ""I babysitter watch kid grocery shop"" argument hold curbside pickup delivery houses parents concerned exposure. can’t believe it’s difficult Americans wear masks. doesn’t even cost anything. It’s like asking shut shop down. share pain unvaccinated kid looking forward outings summer maybe vaccinated later fall. Seriously. People need move fuck on. always pro mask mandate social distancing, need get back normal. someone ADA service dog additionally doesn’t clear physical indication disability - people get fucked. people taking advantage ESA ADA protections selfish interests - actively harming us legitimate disabilities. get much shit day 100x difficult deal repercussions experiences people fakers. Haha, thanks! “Medical procedure” lol getting almost 2 week cold. got gnarly!! Tested covid still, bacterial it’s random virus going around. lab tech mentioned half staff point another last weeks. Lucky us! Um, people die Covid, die from? worried actually killed then?? I'm thinking they're also factoring school year ending children pretty soon all, that’s unnecessary kind sad. one ever reacted whole life pandemic human history People already defined include felons. Makes sense, kids general yet vaccinated masks schools makes sense. That's exactly point—it's medical choice, financial one, weird commenter framing financial-based decision. new rules based fact effective vaccines are. assumption fully vaxxed sit next person active Covid risk there. herd immunity matters many people get it. individually vaccinated feel confidant go live life worry Covid that’s amazing Pfizer moderna vaccines are. Yes rare cases MILD Covid post vaccination, needs talked ridiculously good vaccines are. Less one million die Covid post vaccine issue new guidelines embolden people want bother explaining ""a condition"" prior desire vaccinate. feel time ""move on"" finally take masks, take ""personal responsibility.""

That's probably 40x number people making scenes. Don’t states surplus vaccines point?  I’ve done part compassion year, I’m early 20s time matters me, I’m willing give longer. wait kid get it?

You trust cdc? Remember beginning pandemic every intelligent country wearing masks CDC told everyone masks help, wear them? Hey people voted looser restrictions living virus still around. votes matter, doesn’t matter Oval Office. That’s biggest drawback democracy like one US mind controlling pandemic. end day, matters votes can’t keep voters unhappy may lose next election. shit, cares. It’s time move on. Get vaccinated, protect yourself. Especially non-mRNA ones too. Disinformation omission. understand MRNA works, makes zero sense MRNA cause long term problems. 

And many people horrible covid damage lasting year already end site. Permanent damage. Many people permanent damage, go read r/medicine  Per CDC,
""In addition, reactogenicity data adolescents aged 12- 15 years obtained reviewed, similar adults aged 18-55 years.""

The TLDR temporary side effects vaccine 12 15 cohort 18 55 cohort I'm fully vaccinated tell wear mask probably rest life. Amazingly, rural towns Washington state went last months (or nearly all) customers wearing masks. Thank god experts, otherwise would guessed could possible? N95 masks really work. shitty bandanna doesn’t much aerosol spread viruses. don’t filter particles small. 

I’m sure helps somewhat, strongly effective wouldn’t gotten big waves masks wearing parts country fall. Europe wouldn’t third fourth wave. 

Vaccines MUCH effective masks. person contact also needs unvaccinated well. decreases probability even Exactly. Get vaccinated, flatten curve. Check check. goalposts moved “don’t take mask toddlers vaccinated” never plan. lot people made ""perfect"" enemy ""good enough"" lately. countries kids wear masks school. I’d say look countries. People lie benefit, that's culture US nowadays. Social media social situations, fluffed resumes image filters, exaggeration one-upsmanship, disadvantageous truthful. time someone proves passing lie, probably benefitted lying revealed truth damage you.

&amp;#x200B;

It's anti-maskers lie vaccine sort. people opted get vaccine, medical field, issues masks personal reasons wanting take form covid vaccine. already breakroom discussions sure lie vaccine would denied entry somewhere without one Telling truth longer value Virtue America!. Especially Washington!  square one mean covid deaths cases numbers past winter there's definitely chance ""easily"" find back regardless variant. would put possible highly unlikely category. vaccines tend work well variants lot ones we're seeing transmissible deadly. CDC recognizes hence recent guidance, can't make public policy choices based solely worst possible outcome. Tacrolimus Honestly youre living pathetic life Ive seen long time. even vax'ed, children not, since approved yet younger ages. know someone love stubborn, want get either. feel like whole ""you stop wearing mask now"" help convince anti-vaxx anti-maskers conspiracy 'keep people masked' 'inject experiments'. Rather, shows anti-vaxxer, anti-masker, get vaccinated/wear mask, rejoin rest world!  


It make getting vaccine less 'scary' holdouts. ... CDC headquartered United States locations least 60 countries hired professionals from... Around world. ... CDC headquartered United States locations least 60 countries hired professionals from... Around world. ""5 reasons to...."" articles back! world healing! think could sure see something wear mask vaccinated. guarantee going see rural America require vaccinations order work majority places though, area problem. It’s like Israel getting one two cases week. country 10 million getting thirty new cases disease every day, that’s herd immunity. CDC’s assessment almost certainly due studies backing article: think dropping mask requirements vaccinated people increase vaccine uptake.

Paired statement “We don’t care breakthrough infections unless they’re hospitals dying data hard normalize” rather “We’re going run study try quantify breakthrough infections risks” suggests bit cavalier attitude this. states laws that, society saw problem took action limit it. K Yes. agree use great descriptors categorizing young people ages. Kids children could mean scope younglings different people.

Do source community transmission schools linked teachers rather students? I'd interested reading study. biggest issue COVID rush study behavior virus various settings, many studies invalid design implementation standpoint (not claiming point based one those, adding conversation). me, glut studies made difficult sort wheat chaff. 

As soon indicated virus airborne, I've treated precautions avoiding like avoid smokers. outside get whiff second hand smoke, unlikely it'll affect day. stay indoors poorly ventilated room smoker, clothes could stink nose may get runny, etc. Maher among fully vaccinated people contracted CDC calls “breakthrough case” virus. “some evidence vaccination may make illness less severe,” CDC’s website reads, appears case late-night host. agency explains, “COVID-19 vaccines effective critical tool bring pandemic control. However vaccines 100% effective preventing illness.” Certain people will.

Certain people wont. companies said lift mandate even pandemic? know mine sent directive masks temperature permanent (i.e, end time.) never compare diseases, since experiments never made? seriously, think terrible place, leave? really weird person getting downvoted getting upvoted.

Masks far effective preventing one spreading preventing one catching it.

Wearing mask home FAR better protective measure kids parent wearing mask public.

""My mask protects you. mask protects me."" Put sharpener away, guys. one's got *edge*. bet someone work immuno kids home real hoot thing. Yet I’m sure continue put it. them? You’re still right? Trust it’s fun soaking n95 Sac Central Valley summer(especially last year fires lasted almost month.) you’re gonna die. guys get kind digital certificate? country get certificate vaccinated see national contact tracing app. dying enough incentive. faking vaccine card already crime? keep seeing perspective pop up. It’s really really sad :( would suggest best approach? higher threshold vaccinated people? Covid stay sincerely wonder immunocompromised people expect/want. cynical. People proudly share antivaccine opinions public wearing mask. Idc all. see issue all. Anyone vaccinated wear mask get sick, sure some. Collateral, mostly non vaccinated anti makers get sick. masks forever? don’t agree effort near zero. need see others’ faces remain open society.    sure point you’re trying make. 

Vaccines may protective, you’re really safe least majority people around get it. 

I nothing vaccinated people wearing masks, data support it. problem many unvaccinated people claim vaccinated wear mask. suspect we’ll end vaccinated people wearing masks unvaccinated people wearing masks. 

I don’t think removing mask mandate vaccinated people help vaccine hesitancy, ‘risk death people love’ didn’t it, much will. (Except million dollar lottery mean) you’re saying right non-vaccinated person shop without mask greater kids’ rights go public. Got matter? people wanted vaccines got protected. worry unvaccinated people do. us jobs ""just stay home""?

People forced continue working shitheads like reject common courtesy endanger people option stay home. Also, science changes based new data. CDC making best incomplete data, decisions/recommendations evolved new/better covid data. Everyone little info work start pandemic. year ""inside"", ready. 

And that's FINE! That's totally okay, get it. folks ease back busy social situations.

But nothing masks, covid-19 anything like that. brain used something done year.

This sorta thing okay, gods, asshole it!  right...they dumb would like think calculated well thought through. However CDC said week truth....that vaccinated people need wear masks inside. Maybe quite calculate Walmart many retailers would RUN get rid (effectively) masks EVERYBODY. Maybe unintended consequence CDC telling truth vaccinated people. Maybe, retrospect, CDC given guidance businesses keep full mask mandates since vaccine passports since people likely lie. aware different people different life circumstances family, right? nearly simple great many us. example, live alone densely-populated area, means spent vast majority past 14 months entirely alone. family live opposite coast me, seen since December 2019 wanted follow guidelines unnecessary air travel.

Life significantly different many us pandemic. Masking least it. phase absolutely feels like return sort normalcy.  I'll wear mask airports probably forever. getting sick year. realized gross people everything, covid Ironically people continue wear masks willingly got vaccinated first place. cases B.1.617.2 variant found Oklahoma Friday, May 14.  cases identified across age groups; symptomatic.  17 people confirmed B.1.617.2 variant fully vaccinated Moderna vaccine two partially vaccinated time virus’ onset, according news release.

This one super contagious. think highly likely see regional outbreaks areas lower rates vaccination. seem good theory would caught legal battles months even years. think New York tried maybe passport seems completely optional. Even though there’s precedent us requiring vaccines schools travel, think state governments realized moment rolled would lawsuits would order injunction thus putting pause passports anyways. time gets sorted legally would probably side pandemic. Yea ok. know man, everything litmus test, it? think problem CDC knows never going reach herd immunity.  There's thing ""back square one"" almost 60% American adults currently least one dose vaccine least 20% probably 30%+ immunity prior infection. We're vastly different spot 3 months ago let alone year ago. !remindme 36 hours

Please update. 425 days since US issued travel ban UK. Assuming things eventually get back pre-pandemic ease travel, I'll never take granted again. title “Five reasons vaccinated people don’t need panic variants.”

Most world needs panic. Well disagreeing science knowing people abuse something cant enforced  think pharmacies continue mask policy they’re giving vaccines it’s place sick people often go. Thank you! reason expected put shot last year real unprecedented danger posed public health. subsides, too, restrictions Dude I'm liberal find kind frustrating also bit hilarious. I've followed rules letter I'm happy rid mask places now.

My fellow liberals need stop treating wearing mask kind social statement live lives. Well speak personal experience, live Texas say mask adherence much much lower states like Virgina Maryland. Outside Houston, Austin, Dallas-Fortworth, San Antonio, mask usage small businesses low. Even large cities here, mask usage dropped rapidly last month two   Yup. Personally, say bring on. One friends bartender bar mask mandate weeks now. immune compromised doctor told get vaccinated. Since mask mandate got lifted, double masking work. want see semblance herd immunity fucking work peace. COVID-19 back 20005. kids older 12 get vaccinated. younger 12 can’t accept risk face COVID go ahead bubble forever, face danger course normal non-pandemic day Covid It’s true. spreads schools teachers lunch together. Kids get sports. Nice paywall article.  Rt gone down,

One question wonder keeping mask mandate states would driven Rt even lower (like Rt coming reasons like vaccines, seasonality, general immunity people already it).

But probalistic model much? Like we're talking percentage points, 15% range. think people would've learned happened Texas, guess not.

Anti-maskers *do care* law is. already wearing masks getting vaccinated. Mask mandates change much anything anymore. likely change anything. 

Yes, people lie vaccinated avoid wearing mask. people probably already wearing them. give excuse use make look better avoid conflict. lack one, however, likely stop them. 

Most people wearing masks likely continue wearing them, regardless whether they've vaccinated not. already took effect, probably disseminated stores yet. WalMart one first follow science. think trader Joe's technically beat announcement. ""Service animals"" trained perform specific task, guiding blind person busy sidewalk.

""Emotional Support Animals"" hand, fancy way saying ""pet"". animal species breed specific training owner like aspect animal. People call pets complex name attempt able bring pets places allow pets. parents get it, lie tell people got it. shit Thanks, stats kids somewhat comforting... Although, medically fragile kiddo, I'm still terrified get vaccine. really need expert tell us that? RI adopting Tuesday, lifting restrictions Friday.  emphasized “masks aren’t required” part “for vaccinated people” part. people still understand works problem time? Honestly how? It’s perfect still think screwed up. topical immunosuppresant? adults country eligible vaccination entire month

Hey, us get vaccinated right away floodgates opened. signed soon Washington state removed restrictions (April 15th) waiting list nearly two weeks could get first shot. Finally got second shot yesterday. friend mine another week behind schedule, sitting around indecision.

While many vaccine clinics greater Seattle area worked initial glut even seeing walk-ins, us willing able travel rural areas get shots (or lie multiple pre-existing conditions sign up) earlier still waiting. suspect major urban areas boat. aware still get covid vaccinated right? main point vaccine stop side effects greatly slows transmission. Get vaccinated, flatten curve, stop spread. easy Yes, get hell get lives. free wear mask forever want to. free get vaccinated. free keep kids inside isolated forever think that's good parenting.  Yes, remember people ignoring guidelines awhile now. Many antibodies whether know not. We’ve seen unmasking states like Texas Florida still fine. concerned vaccinated fault. Transmission low point, especially heading summer Agreed. I'm group that's going continue protecting kid I'm worried hospitalization death.

It's worth taking chance affects development know yet. Seems like there's lot long haul cases kids places spouse worried would lead less lung capacity permanently semi permanently.  course will. CDC royally screwed here. vaccinated people taken virus serious enough care wear mask one way other. ""rules"" enable anti-mask/anti-vaxx people. Damn. type line work do? haven't. I'm sure MLB rules point, maybe they're following state guidance, even wear mask walking around concourses, pretty much never wear seat. wear one little get away with.  covid risk. 

They take lots risks - jumping, running, playing, climbing stairs - lead lifelong injury death.

The risks prefer keep children safe ones media focuses on. Yes, forgery medical document identity theft behalf CDC. It’s fairly serious.

The problem vaccinated people don’t carry cards. don’t. Also, Aren’t many places asking see card, either. Oh god social lifers want stay home year long longer care tbh. give covid unvaccinated person get really sick, well could care less know yet. allowed original clinical trials, they're testing now. signed study myself. I'm sure mean know quite successfully received vaccines. know efffective? trial? Also, make autoimmune condition flare really badly I'm extremely sick back prednisone. that's comment about. reference efficacy. think risk vaccinated person low, also read CDC’s announcement strategic decision rather something driven consensus public health. think announced hopes driving vaccination %. don’t think changes I’m going handle this- mask outdoors unless it’s crowded, mask indoors, avoiding crowded indoor places entirely. It’s I’m comfortable point. How'd last Roaring Twenties turn out? seem recall lead depression world war. I'll settle return Boring Tens thank you! TIL I’m expert. Yes point need think economy   course they’ll fucking lie coworker like this. obsese anti mask vaccine. keep thinking ever gets infected virus...good luck good old US medical choices financial choices. Choose wrong you’re bankrupt, dead, both! Freedumb! difficult lol.

1. Coworker get vaccinated
2. Coworker gets covid
3. Coworker spreads covid me, whether get it, bring home clothes, objects etc.
4. give kids, parents, immunocompromised family members.

All could avoiding idiots get simple prick arm. fReEDoM! looks like systemic absorption minimal unless Netherton syndrome. drug would likely interfere goes systemic, using topically. 

I'm doctor quote it, found information like here: We'll fine. We're isolated clean rooms here, much people might like imagine are. Masks filtering 100% everything either. Especially pets, like do, fact life there's sorts germs around you. worry we're going ""isolated microbes.""  selfish inconsiderate are. you’re apparently also willfully ignorant. stay home can’t handle piece cloth know guy next children museum zoo Pfizer Moderna vaccine matter? others go 30% possibility 10%.

I still think premature adult population vaccination % children get vaccinated. nobody ever cared enough shut country down? one saying need masks pandemic over.

They're saying FULLY VACCINATED need masks (except high density/high risk situations...) They’re kinda lying though.

The folks aren’t vaccinated mainly putting (and obviously others aren’t vaccinated) risk. Honestly chance. rest us live lives Covid ravage remainder reassuring AstraZeneca among them. bodes well adenovirus-based vaccines. ""I identify as"" part code hate trans people. believe anyone choose identity, using phrasing advantage. never said that. post even staying home! Honor system Congress..... Hahaha epidemiology background, reading infinitesimally small risk covid children? Honest question. expert here. didn’t need report tbh. death bad death covid really really isn’t problem kids. death rate higher 18s *vaccinated* flu unvaccinated covid. kid 20x likely die car crash covid.

Public health policy balance. Risk inherent life risk kids low level it’s okay. lol you’re literally suggesting something conspiracy theorists touting: mandatory vaccines  Gonna go joke t-shirt identifying something else.  yet still VOI CDC nations around world declared VOCs... complete idiot: also think lie Keep masking crowded indoor spaces make mask well. least kids vaccinated fall.  people lie vaccine wouldn’t wear masks. undercounting. Lots Biden voters basket. Walensky either really dumb really naïve. really think unvaccinated people lie claim vaccinated? think really severe case ""Beltway Bubble Syndrome"" ... Like everybody kids age 12 want kids masked indoors need lead example.  Grifters gotten good grift. Texas opened fully several weeks ago continue declining cases. explain that?

Also article right many ways. I’ve heard many hesitant say reason get shot still live fear wear masks anyway. 

The shots work. want stay safe get one. OP [here's study found vaccinated people reduce household transmission done England year UK variant widespread.

[Here's source saying super spreaders cause 80% two two together pretty clear vaccines reduce super spreader events. Exactly. Added businesses deal vaccination police check vaccine cards , maybe fake.
When send advisories maybe give structure best accomplish it. ""I identify as"" part making fun making light trans non-binary people struggles. like people make fun trans people saying things like ""I identify Apache attack helicopter"", example. disrespectful. Even treatments disease? looked much tax revenue would generated starting economy again, never saving lives. I'm future point, I've pity refuse vaccines. Documented medical condition, sure. someone trust science wacko get Covid get vaccinated, fuck em. little cardboard CDC things bear official logo CDC, makes official federal document. Therefore forging becomes federal crime. obvious, really can’t people forging official documents, right?  transphobic. That's presuming achieve herd immunity without mandates. someone one highest possible status one major cruise lines get cruise \_a\_lot\_, Diamond Princess disaster going take heck lot upset cruise industry ""tough regulations"" even consider setting foot cruise-ship again. There's bad track-record cruise industry handling infectious deceases stemming nature piling thousands people together tight spaces weeks - mishandling (and perhaps lying) Norovirus COVID-19 shows. awful state handling COVID-19 out-break Diamond Princess shows industry greatly clueless seems little absolutely possible stay technically compliant laws regulations.

Before changes I'm pretty sure venture again. I'll miss fun company I'll happy venture something could turn months isolated small cabin windows (hint - Carnival that's Jail-cell like - one thing got really upset compared to!). 

How anyone think putting many people together confined space call safe beyond me. much cruise ship means close lot people: gyms; casinos; theater; dining rooms; buffet cafeterias - time surrounded dozens hundreds people cabin. beyond increased risk, way cruise lines (particular Carnival Princess Cruises) responded makes brainier former cruise-nut: going. Really care CDC says, cruise line industry whatever. saw passengers ain't going happen family. don’t think would need 2022 least kids get vaccinated. huge herd immunity protect well.  Science also says vaccines help masks - lot more. much safe vaccinated people drop mask. ways people protect themselves. Take personal responsibility stop asking everyone bow few. Jesus  know exactly long vaccines last. Pfizer said need third shot 12 months, know gap going happen. get closer year immunity wanes. Great. know avoid easily. Hate?  Yeah I’m saying it’s silly statement **Emotional Support Animals** - Untrained pets. get ESA letter licenced healthcare professional people diagnosed mental illness professional believes ESA bring therapeutic support companionship patient. privileges ESA letter gives allowing pet non-pet approved housing, cabin airplane travel. still restricted places businesses like grocery stores restaurants. ADA, owners public accommodations required allow emotional support animals, service animals.

**Service Animals** - ""Under ADA, service animal defined dog individually trained work perform tasks individual disability. task(s) performed dog must directly related person's disability."" ADA specific requirements qualifies service animal. meet requirements protected ADA allow access places grocery stores restaurants. 

If ever around actual trained service animal, even seen one, pretty easy pick real service animals pets people throw vest behavior. (Or basically small dog old lady shopping cart)  It’s crazy fast shirt ready go know picked specifically wear public. Like picking outfit first day school. wish making read would think sounds made too. Oh, one ""it's flu"" people.

Please continue actively try harm around anti-science psychopath, seem pleased yourself. Still, shows masks work effectively (if worn properly) cheap easy implement. 

Consistently throughout pandemic, people shitting tools alone, holes really work combined. Vaccines obviously much stronger tool thing lead immunity, people either try find ways around can't totally sure one mutations might able cause chaos especially many people still unprotected. like 2 days saying vaccinated people need wear masks outside? Suddenly need wear anywhere? matter mixing with? 

It premature sends mixed messages (as usual... Poor messaging speciality). probably stores would like continue requiring masks know customers largely unvaccinated otherwise vulnerable, government mandate backing anymore. I’m wearing mask forever.

Problem solved. What’s stop people asking proof vaccination? Didn’t say Pfizer looking vaccine approval around September 2-11 year olds? Oh, oh oh oh. That’s different. kids already Covid. think people severely overestimate risk force others make *feel* safe? We've authorized 12 Canada though enough vaccines vaccinate yet. everything suggest works well children able vaccinated near future.  August 2018, Bogle Sunflower Plantation Canada close sunflower fields visitors Instagram image went Viral. image caused near stampede photographers keen get instagram image 1.4 million sunflowers field. Yep. got 2nd shot week ago, like ""finally, nightmare over"", doctor said get ""too excited, might need booster (3rd) shot fall/winter"".  get sick asymptomatic form virus like cold less

For lot people yes, people know advance one be. importantly limiting amount COVID community immensely important. 95% effective vaccine little presence COVID community 95% effective vaccine almost surely going need. 95% effective vaccine community spread means get exposed COVID daily basis vaccine going enough stop people getting spreading it. Experts lol like anyone 1 braincell spread like wildfire among vaccinated too. dont vaccines stop infection serious disease? recommend do? Keep masking prove effective vaccines are? “Duuuuur everyone else vaccinated, I’ll safe”

That’s legit logic lot use. First thought bullshit, second think won’t matter people wearing masks vaccinated vaccines effective variants strains, stop spreading misinformation! may 100% effective, provides sufficient amount protection. different anti-mask, anti-vax crowd continue spread misinformation vaccine effective, is. CDC vaccine manufacturers release data points contrary, vaccines effective COVID variants. fyi new administration didn’t make decision, apparently found night before. cdc did, new administration trying hands since last mire involved cdc creating distrust. articles ive reading. think would better cdc recommendations least consulted federal state governments announcing it. Like, give heads this? sure even would helped case. state thing left businesses require masks. thats going away... frustrating. Try telling parents internet saying they're going change pandemic habits, lol. agree I'm seeing lot angst new masking rules, feels like flip cares lie? chose get vaccine, loss get sick it. absolute lower bound, 36.4% population honestly say fully vaccinated. Yeah real- right time? happen. saying wrong it’s would waited longer. needs work. need silence anti-vax loonies. Let’s hope beginning end pandemic!  Depressingly cogent. truth. trusted CDC last year, gonna stop now? asthma risk factor. im sick hearing shit biggest problem vax v unvax... adults opportunity means obtain vaccination, point restrictions all? 

We wore masks protect vulnerable populations waited vaccines... vaccines vulnerable population months. So, then, keep mask mandates wait general population get vaccinated... happening last 2 months. So, point, fully reopening telling people received vax operate risk - get antibodies old fashioned way. read morning got Johnson Johnson, great vaccine think less effective mRNA. Still, job preventing hospitalization death want. baseball players may known positive. 

Please know I'm still fan Johnson Johnson! great people want one done whose life circumstances make difficult get two shots, still effective vaccine! forget?

&amp;#x200B;

***U.S. secures 300 million doses potential AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine*** President Donald Trump demanded vaccine, U.S. Department Health Human Services (HHS) agreed provide $1.2 billion accelerate British drugmaker AstraZeneca’s vaccine development secure 300 million doses United States. Probably got memo yet. They'll coming around shortly. takes time notify thousands stores adjust signage inform employees.
 
You'll also stores managers intentionally drag feet they're unhappy new rules. happened mandates started, inevitably happen end Believe feel sorry people brainwashed conspiracy theories. 

Just they're idiots putting risk mean can't feel bad drank kool-aid. care? Could also past, heard earth rocking place 20 thousand years old people get make choices regarding bodies even think choices stupid Went Walmart yesterday SW Washington literally saw zero people without mask. One chin diaper another nose sticking out, everyone one on. vaccine guarantee safety. said elsewhere post, someone work recently got virus despite vaccinated. I've vaccinated, I'll continue wear mask number cases decreases reasonable level. schools already announced going “masks optional”… even though none students could vaccinated yet (at least elementary schools). ""experts"" shit. vaccinated cares person next not. 

I'm fully vaccinated give damn I'm fine Emotional support animals don’t require training, aren’t service animals. Technically federal requirement service animals trained either, often support someone’s disability. Emotional Support Animals aren’t purpose. housing related service animals “everything” related covered Americans Disabilities Act. weird, strangely opposite findings CDC led remove mask recommendations fully vaccinated individuals.

who listen to, random obstruction, CDC? confusing... ""Uhh"" yep, US Texas NYT case count graphs bookmarked check every day. Texas decreasing saw plateau shortly removed mask mandate. I've rooting 1k average daily cases months can't seem dip 2k. would say US ""decreasing"" ""absolutely plummeting."" 34k average daily cases still whole lot.

I'm asking mask forever, 0 cases. I'm saying early. new wave? know, maybe nothing significant. prolonged plateau, also bad? I'm expecting one. I'm expecting change vaccinations graph due this, expecting negative change cases graph due it. would happily take I-told-you-so, I'm wanting much everyone else. !Remindme Texas sub-1k US sub-10k.  state this? doubting you, want follow along. BC, people map terms covid regulation support/vaccine support.

I’m mind less put behind us vaccination levels high enough. Hopefully added flu shot future also. Masks great allergy sufferers like me. lying since day one, looking Karens Chads. it’s frustrating can’t get kids vaccinated right now. shot safe. Let sign waiver get kids one shot. need around people. I'm misleading misrepresenting. studies suggesting saying. studies suggesting enough data come conclusions. vaccines promote optimism, needs cautious. making blanket statements untrue. data refute I'm saying. need research clearly see one side it, risky.

""Preliminary data Israel suggest people vaccinated Pfizer vaccine develop COVID-19 four-times lower viral load (the amount virus body) people unvaccinated, suggesting they’re much less likely transmit virus"" quoted means study needed, peer reviews needed. running positive considering data research needed conclusive. submit spreading misinformation explaining facts, including asterisks data. others sub need to, going lead people dangerous path complacency. would’ve time change plans involve around people. Time plan we’re going handle this. Time research order decent quality N95 masks children can’t rely much people also wearing masks. could go on. 

For normal people think would also helped prevent conflicts due maskless people suddenly appearing stores word gotten around.  guarantee someone assaulted due confusion caused suddenness move. 

Springing public without warning plain dumb variety reasons. worth, data says people putting risk. matter much 6-8 weeks cases really plummeted, window time then, they're really danger themselves. Unvaccinated people still asked mask. know ignore recommendation, already happening. schools enforce, guess. perfect scenario means tho, sure definitely worry kids little bit this. hopefully responsible parents keep safe just... power end this? We'll see, guess. yup, still masking lot places, though mostly habit make others feel safer. accurate hurts. pretty funny there's tons misinformation vaccines whenever ask someone gotten it, stammer sputter like asked lipstick collar. Trying explain post-infection immunity temporary handwaived. One person told allergic RNA. just... never shut work, made office people work home. Considering still people Covid quarantining contact of...two days ago, I'm pretty sure we're still mask work, regardless vaccine status. also turned part parking lot temperature/mask giving station upgraded shitty tents toll-booth things lights solar panels. We're long run, regardless CDC says, think. definitely lie it.

But lot people lie, like proud anti vaxxers , want KNOW cool special defiant always see people point low hospitalization rates fir kids w/ acknowledgement many kids remote year. make since see many severely ill they've quarantined. Heck 2 college age sons go school that's remote year well.  know mine sent directive masks temperature permanent (i.e, end time.)

If makes feel better, *highly* doubt they'll this. point, masks become *huge* negative working company, else equal, people would probably choose work somewhere else *without* masks. company (and others) drop policies point competitive job market. guarantee it.  That's true B117 strain. fact, Brazil thousands child deaths result. Incidentally, also primary strain going around American Midwest right now. Fortunately, mRNA vaccines effective it.

Also, masks primarily protect others anything wearer might spreading. some, far less, protect wearer. year, know now. work requires proof vaccination wear mask work. last week, guy work got virus despite vaccinated. vaccine 100% effective. got vaccinated, continue wear mask, know neither guarantee protection. do, know. graduate school studying epidemiology H1N1 hit. well aware it. Congrats! One step keeping kids safe! stops serious disease sure, *may* (preliminary studies say YES) dampen transmission infection amazing many people correctly said ""Follow science CDC guidelines"" past year want ignore jive beliefs. I'll check out! Pantsuit Politics good episode May 7. really.good listen reflect well. progressive disagree nearly everything Republican party, covid one area frustrated sides politicized this. shit grandmother, uncle, father GBS. diagnosed back ‘60s grandmother two became pretty obvious thing. killed father grandmother.

Obviously either share genetic environmental risk. hope latter sake. 

Anyway get vaccine. One brothers not. researched CDC suggesting people GBS get vaccinated. would never question decision considering severity GBS.

But research, despite warnings flu shots, scientists don’t believe vaccines cause GBS. believe almost always infection triggering immune response. dad sepsis.

My uncle convinced caused flu shot. going argue become anti-vaxxer tries persuade everyone else skip vaccines. tell needs others get vaccinated protect himself. people want play fire. Let get burned want Covid seems unlocked scary part human nature they’d rather wait home every single risk eliminated rational. You’re vaxxed, community transmission low, go fun. Instead hear “what if’s” variants “I’m masking 80% population vaxxed” like why. Neither gonna happen, resistance living life worry-free again? cant testing expensive Taiwan.  SW Washington. I'm guessing people resistant change.

For me, I'm planning wear mine employees begin taking off.  LMAO good. upvote Masks reduce spread. doctor Earth going room covid patient without mask. 

Your “correlation” masks stopping spread look data, like saying people taking HIV medication HIV must medication causes HIV

This anti-masker logic cite areas cases risen even mask mandate. keeping 12 kids away indoors vaccinated. play kids outdoors, hiking, bike riding, etc. I’m terribly excited change merely opinion. Glad decided get vaccinated! RemindMe! 1 day. 100% masking curbs transmission ten percent, isn’t enough something spreads exponentially. noticing recently many people going around maskless since mandates eased, it’s like “look people vaccinated!” Yeah, doubt it. It’s likely heard beginning part mask mandates eased tuned part completed vaccines. still running biking wearing mask completed first shot, get next June. I'm expert. lie. time, realized saying ""some people wear masks"" going translate ""we're done wearing masks!"" lot people. say someone role organizing enforcement mask policy within library system... knew next day conversations going handle announcement. thing? Boring. I'm bored people like you. unbelievable. Yeah I'm honestly hoping workplace same. Sounds heartless I'm done arguing idiots. I’m talking shutting schools, I’m talking masking within schools, among kids young good distancing. That's terrible. :/ 11 year old we'll mask solidarity w/ avoid places w/ poor ventilation/unmasked peeps. It’s actually like providing life jackets want don’t drown even though boat clearly sinking. It’s don’t want wear life jacket. One co workers said cause tested. 

""Oh cool where'd go?"" 

""No make test myself"" 

K bud could mostly Tuesday fully Memorial Day restrictions leave. Can't wait! I'll make honest request response honest question respond. Define mean ""infinitessimally small risk."" amount people lie low easy get shot person going hurt themselves.

If treat everyone like child control behavior going bad time. They'll really consider lock deal it.

Looks like they'll lockdown they've [more 100 cases per day 14 Might bit late current growth rate. Taiwan screwed.  Crazy Maine, got brain! many covid deaths among kids would school mitigation policies? hard say.

It's pretty irrelevant since moving forward vaccines may slow spread measures. I’m quite curious sort happened.

So I'm merely speculating scientist, vaccine creates physical barrier preventing virus getting nasal tract. I'm vaccinated, breathe virus particles shove cotton swab test viral particles, would turn positive, right? might even breathe back out. even though virus there, nowhere go, soon gets system, antibodies quickly kill it.  - redcaps questioning mask mandates Let’s exaggerate. one saying stay home. masks indoor situations. consider failing strategy? covid-04, one previous versions Yeah. One anecdote supports theory kind thing helped convince mother get vaccinated couple weeks ago. governor state said business restrictions ending 19th May, thought soon thought better get vaccinated. that, hesitant, worried side effects such. policy helps vaccine hesitant people come realization world going wait make mind, they're going get vaccine they're going get sick.  got J&amp;J vaccine 70% effective. I'll still wearing mask everywhere attempt avoid getting it. lucky far. \*sigh\* Dying reason avoid COVID. Many 1.7 million Americans who've contracted disease confronting puzzling, lingering symptoms, including aches, anxiety attacks, night sweats, rapid heartbeats, breathing problems loss smell taste. Many living life unrecognizable one go Double Secret Probation real. adore comments assume locking children rooms zero stimulation interaction us, adults, children. assume parking front TV. 

So many assumptions. much judgment. cool  They've said fully vaccinated people drop mask. Kids vaccinated all. course schools would continue use masks.

It's mixed messaging, frankly, even clarify it. research blindly trust ""the science""....hmm..... fucking cares  Right, people getting flustered this. last 15 months, I’ve followed science. Wear mask, done. Get vaccine it’s turn, done. Vaccinated people go back normal, done. 

My biggest question stores still requiring vaccinated employees wear mask don’t require customers. It’s moronic wearing mask restaurant take table. 

And yes, anti-mask/vax people going go back normal. science says I’m going fine. biggest covid denier family nurse. constant source friction throughout entire pandemic, whether quarantining holidays getting vaccine generally trying reduce exposure. I'm tired reading here.

Aside kids 12, everyone vaccinated. reasons can't unless allergic, find take dose 1. immunocompromised folks make less response, still vaccinated, still produce decent amount immunity.  Costco: true king Exactly. metric community prevalence COVID, vaccination rates. High vaccination rates lead low community prevalence, relaxing restrictions based demonstrated progress. part problem experts... either tell us something everybody fucking knows, tell us something people know way nobody fucking understand. agree lot lockdowns lifted. see reason lot restrictions can’t lifted. think shops, restaurants, movie theaters, etc, etc open now. hard still require masks locations somewhat necessary grocery stores pharmacies really anywhere indoors you’re eating/drinking? Seems like there’s happy medium. new CDC plans seems opened world like everything better COVID gone. We’re long way that. side effects second dose kids? sick fever moderna. son get second dose 3 weeks I’m curious expect. word? check reading onion article Ez way tell difference someone vaxed vs. vaxed....just ask 'em election ever seen Americans truly honest anything? Even themselves? can't even honest war broke us two. makes think honest piece fabric? areas US, people want get vaccine getting it. state (PA), governor remove mask mandate 4-6 weeks 70 percent adult population fully vaccinated.

The thing is, people chose get vaccine likely already wearing masks (and likely continue so), wearing masks begin going suddenly start people get vaccinated either. updated CDC guidance eliminate whatever lackluster compliance anti-mask anti-vaccine crowds lie vaccination status. make mistake, absolutely will.

It's possible businesses public domains continue require masks regardless, we've already seen, comes enforcement. Businesses already hands antimaskers without legally-bound consequences (ex: state mandate) free assume every patron employee vaccinated. group, new CDC issuance gives less backing continued mask requirement, again, encourages people lie.

It's easy think consequences fall anti-mask/anti-vax crowd, there's plenty vulnerable people ineligible vaccination (younger children, immune-compromised, etc) whose infection addition problem group continue strain healthcare system prolong placement public health mandates.

In short, still overcoming pandemic pace least common denominator society: petulant, selfish, willfully ignorant minority idiots would rather drag pandemic long possible suffer mildest possible inconveniences wearing face covering gathering large groups. I'm SD daycares open whole pandemic schools open since fall. effectively non-issue kids. There's cases course, far know, deaths cases long-term complications 18. urge every parent, get vaccinated, afraid children everything else. 
I say, too, I'm supporter things SD. go far enough curb transmission, killed lot people need to. mean remote schooling year right thing either. US monitoring outbreaks variant. states better reporting others, widespread problem. Testing variants ramping up, tracing faulty. combined, think we'll see fast spread throughout US coming weeks. It’s easy tell non-masker actually got vaccine. ask “who election?” I'm classed ""a bit fucked"" due T1 diabetes, today 9am became fully Astrazeneca vaccinated, Alan Partridge voice intensifies ""lick face"" data date (as Jan. 27, 2021) show increased risk COVID-19 infection severity COVID-19 disease people asthma.Jan 27, 2021 experience, least half people explain already know it. play dumb continuously either try win argument get way.

The half, well, never get it. two year old. risk significantly less yearly risk flu well risk getting car. cases low enough high rate vaccination area risk vector COVID also significantly low. Come man enough facts, Reddit. Florida Texas r bad! Reeeeeee! need experts know they'll lie. They've lying year least 10% population got infected 580,000 dead. want see someone vaccinated not, ask got jab, ask Trump lost election. think going see cases outbreaks. see people encouraged get vaccinated. think might presented properly knows.  know stats show flu dangerous 18 covid is. Get kids flu shot get covid shot flu shot adult members family, waiting period, live life again. 

Your chance carrier vaccine extremely small. you’re worried check data Israel. They’ve great reporting population high vaccine rates high variant percents. Unfortunately Moderna awhile mostly deployed US, going take time get results countries variants present. . Pfizer Vaccine Moderna work similarly surprised results translate Moderna. expert know they'll lie. Yeah, think expert know people lie get trouble get stranger back. like CDC earned trust: took months even partially acknowledge aerosol transmission, delayed recommending masks long apparent necessary.

They're better WHO, sure, CDC exactly sterling track record issuing science-based recommendations far pandemic. risk factor dude. Fucking annoying people think dumb shit. understand CDC thinking. can't naive diseases vaccine against/before vaccines, comparisons could never made? 50 years ago say measles worse chicken pox? Thanks contribution detailed even learned stuff. 

(I'm Surinamese living Netherlands, family country know way life young persons POV) tattoo unique QR-code neck get vaccination easy check go. mom T. Ffs I'm tired shit people. sourced CDC website says differently, want go pix11.com? CDC hesitant say coronavirus airborne although information existed said airborne, information also existed suggesting not. CDCs job investigate verify, spread rumors (even rumors end true). also CDC updates guidance get information weigh public health impacts guidance problem is, ""the remainder"" right includes younger children. ok. Yes, portion population go kicking screaming back normalcy years come.

I care wear mask rest life, make wear one.  drive kid places car? take doctors sick kids around? Let swim pools jump trampolines?

Everything risks. risk kid dying COVID getting seriously ill low getting lower cases go down.

Maybe CDC looked numbers correctly interpreted using statisticians? community transmission low

Well, community transmission low everywhere, that's risk assessment comes in. vaccines stop infection cases. Especially mRNA ones. Even ""triple mutant"" indian variant Pfizer showing 70-80% efficacy blocking infection completely. Vaccines work. work well. Well according doctor is. bad don’t like it. understand vaccines work right? gay frogs also prevent infection. Texas lifted mask mandate downward trend slowed down. completely plateaued April, hospitalizations large cities started creeping back (some hospitals partially reopening Covid wings even). 

People tried act like metrics went down, complete horseshit. already going down, mask mandate appeared grind halt. least stagnated recovery efforts.

Even vaccinations increasing, we're seeing urban increase hospitalizations downward trend still come back pre-mask mandate removal. think huge portion frustration lack updating science. Like knew months months touch transmission isn’t thing. Yet still know people obsessively wiping groceries etc hadn’t seen new research. 

The podcast also discusses bad risk assessment one side estimates risk (especially hospitalization rates example) side underestimating risks. really think lot reflection trauma, anxiety, politics played every decision made. lol headline peak r/AmericaBad content.

Let guess, “experts” say non-Americans *won’t* lie vaccinated right? Americans lie!!! I'm assuming businesses still require 100% mask usage indoors. Vaccine cards reliable enough system since counterfeited Microsoft Word ballpoint pen. came say yep, will. People suck. want over. sucks most—we want thing, half us want handed us rather moderately uncomfortable moments. disgustingly ironic though, people refusing get vaccinated people ridiculed anti-vaxers health concerns children. Throw politics American rights mix fight worth fighting. else sucks? People audience raise doubt vaccinations little evidence. People parents respect don’t feel comfortable taking one uneducated person podcast decided share. real virus stupidity, spreads faster coronavirus I’ve seen. 

Edit: spelling. course they’ll lie, that’s expected.

 else could garner public’s support digital certificate system? Oh actually Fauci anonymous account? Fuck dumb politicians making stupid decisions I’m similar boat. I’m fully vaccinated, I’ve stopped wearing one outdoors, I’ll probably wear next weeks dust settles rule changes happening.  sucks folks legitimately constrained vaccine (eg, certain immune conditions). I'm one, talk reminding shit pissed Trump Ill lie.  already actual virus.  Im going get vaccine virus had.

I target consumer vaccines right now.  bet millions shots wasted people like me.  disease wide spread large population asymptomatic cases shooting anybody wants instead targeting specific groups people effected most.

Feels like reaction covid gigantic misuse resources. Feels like could handled better focusing attention risk. would keep unvaccinated children public settings social distancing possible wear masks, thing right even though vaccinated, trust CDC secure understanding others may COVID great risk health vaccinated. get vaccinated soon possible keep away strangers. ""going science.""

CDC offering NATIONAL policy.

CA nurses - going science

AL nurses - ignoring science.

&amp;#x200B;

Herd immunity U.S.? San Francisco offers reasons optimism feeling understand vaccine actually understand viruses spread.

they do....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Already trailing nation, Alabama sees pace COVID vaccines I've fully vaccinated months still wearing mask. Fuck that. many republi.... Anti-mask morons lie vaccinated. Watch numbers spike again. people way, would indeed force people wear mask get vaccinated. closet authoritarians came open 2020 going go back without fight. Right adults get fucking vaccinated Yeah shit.  wonder people would feel safe wearing one don’t want break social norm. would feel safe without one since it’s 2 weeks since second shot everyone Walmart still wearing one yesterday would felt place taken mine off.  “moving on” kids vaccinated? Yankees living experiment right now. 8 vaccinated people team covid. Including one covid, doses vaccine, got covid again. 

Mostly asymptomatic, don’t know asymptomatic cases long term effects. 

I know that’s unlikely, lead early dementia something, nearly everyone going get early dementia. One - 

Another - - one progress due comprehensive - please no. I'll go say hi team see webex point, another choice. Vaccinated people sre safe, need employers force employees vaccinte.  Always been. Children 12 aren’t common spreaders. Look guidelines: don’t mandate full mask wearing anyone 12. us point anyone wants vaccine get America. get vaccine trust work (because do). Link?  WalMart removing mandate unvaccinated people, going mask police.
 
The CDC knew reasonable way enforce rules. They're naive. They've used assumption calculus concluded still safe lift mandate vaccinated people even though?some/a lot/most? unvaccinated people take advantage leniency. simply know long vaccines effective

I think that's confusion conclusion coming from. could cultural thing maybe ""Probably"" best word, sounds like he's trying say ""Possibly."" Clearly you’re knowledgeable one. new variant said spread faster... surely point there's got limit? That's continue wearing mask even though I'm vaccinated.  Yeah think that's bad check latest opinions  focus deaths really hides impact Covid children.

One study showed 10% children symptomatic Covid end long Covid symptoms.

This NIH article even alarming mentions long Covid common even among children initially asymptomatic infections. general something affects ones health months infection, safe concerned long term implications infection. news: water wet. Im sure contradiction shows conflict.

The CDC clear vaccinated individuals drop masks. Kids vaccinated. Seems pretty simple.  ""experts"" lying effectiveness masks since beginning anyway many reports covid around way first official reports people claiming already comment making fun reporting symptoms pretty easy they're words know brain able decipher I'm saying brain know speak words coming brain able understand since language Since specific actions trained do, couldn’t designated service animal? practice may worth rigamaroll current setup works well.  Texas 20 million people. may never 1k cases day. can;t use absolute terms comparing states, go illness per 100,000. 

&amp;#x200B;

Florida, fact, zero covid restrictions cities allowed either (the governor banned cities counties enforcing them). 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, still increase. Google ""florida coivd graph"". Cases went down, still going down. COVID defeated since almost old sick people shots now. 

Also, Georgia many people NC, also saw case decline. MD extremely densely populated. AZ isn;t big almost everyone lives together area around Phoenix.

&amp;#x200B;

The point daily covid cases WENT 28 states got rid opf masks, even Florida local politicians prohibited restrictions. That's right, fully open 100%, everywhere, masks, covid still went still going down.

&amp;#x200B;

Positive rates matter. fact, cases even matter. matters hospitalizations deaths, needed expert tell this?  Btw condoms break 8% time, since Pfuzer/Moderna vaccines 94% effective could actually say vaccines effective condoms. yes wear condoms, despite 8% chance failure, answer earlier question. Personally I've heard kids getting extremely mild symptoms Covid, bad common cold  No, perfect time alarms. need see science says go let's blow amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments. 

If believe made mistake, please let us know.

Like 80%+ vulnerable population vaccinated. 

If COVID spends next month two ripping younger unvaccinated population it’ll suck given comparatively modest impact won’t big deal hospitals whatnot. Even fully vaccinated I’m still wearing damn mask. haven’t sick virus cold since pandemic started mask. anything I’m grateful pandemic happened keep wearing face mask feel comfortable  would surprised that's true. gonna strengthen antibodies even get virus again. like limit much take lol. getting viral load everyday gonna matter asymptomatic can't spread others. medical condition prevented wearing mask. It’s called introvert didn’t go outside first place. God, loved excuse isolate kitchen. 80% infections. ""Plummeting"" title refers deaths, fell 95%. would say considered plummeting. Christ, read article even headline. “Experts” aka anyone 1.5 brain cells agree. Unfortunately, people saying continuing trust science anti-science people previously trusted science decided science longer trustworthy. change guidelines messaging needed happen. people oppose really think could continue telling people get vaccinated also continue masking/distancing/etc? message sends vaccines don’t work point getting them. think part led vaccine hesitancy. Personal experience, corroborated many hospital admins, 30/70 split. 30% great, hard working, 70% crazy lazy. Thank understanding! Damn. Bold take. wait second. deny masks working like them? either way previous response reeks ""covid bad, masks work"" know true people access type masks. ones readily available ones mentioned before, ones probably taken consideration Lol experts oh no, blowback people already complaining. better give demands complain louder! I'm going same, working crowded public place entering public places. Even reassures others like little apprehensive. idiots voting power. They're fucking idiots scream voter fraud every time lose election. 

But they're happy commit vaccine fraud won't. vaccine protects death also getting headache... Also basically spread big viral load get anyone else sick either.  car insurance. guy covered. promise will. boss super anti vaxx already told need make copy vaxx card multiple times make up. refuse know make one. CDC what, tell what’s safe people do? certificate helped avoid paying deposit monthly fee animal apartment. Best thing I’ve printed years. Rates low like 40% people vaccinated, warm people outside sun outdoor things, ventilation less issue sunlight kills covid pretty quick. summer gives indian double whammy strain months propagate time starts getting cold people go back mostly indoor stuff again, get another wave around October. humans terrible would liars lot places already mostly maskless. like entire country taking first time ""I speeding observe going fast""

-Werner Heisenberg TIL I'm expert. Fun fact. I'm glad pointed lol. CDC government agency. governments directives since Reagan administration towards economic security concerns.

This disease research largely done private entities unless it’s impacting economy like COVID justification get involved crack epidemic, early AIDS epidemic. flu deniers thing? reason employees wear uniforms. Creates unified presentation make customers feel comfortable. Agree doesn’t make sense scientifically is. got vaccinated month ago worked courage take first flight. amazed effort guy front made wear mask 5% time. Would anti-vaxxers lie getting vaccine? wouldn’t think since honestly believe whatever believe vaccine/covid sticking I'm PA. Governor ended mask mandate vaccinated people. I've gone places changed policy match state worn one since. I'm done. I'm liberal, followed rules whole time, I'm done. I'll eat dirty looks long - I'm breaking rules I've fully vaccinated 2 months. end. mean, everyone dies point. kinda ironic big deal people make someone dying unnatural cause even moments away dying ""natural"" (or accepted) one. Especially ""putting down"" seen humane preferred method dealing animals many people consider members family (and deserving love humans live with). anyone doubts I'd point [anti-vaxxers causing measles outbreaks That’s ok, it’s available them, putting risk lying, really people loss America.

Exponential growth gets big small changes parameter, also shrinks dramatically small changes parameter. fuck cares? want risk another statistic let them. That's part freedom. right stupid want long hurt somebody else. high risk vaccinated point that's you. let fucking dumb. start forcing one thing becomes slippery slope. get forcing behavior save people point risk let them.  Ok understand premise joke right? I'm actually claiming entirely complete fact, saw giant gaping flaw announced. Well guess can't anything even we've vaccinated still worry potential edge cases specifically remember still protects hospitalisation death,
which perspective matters.  What's child infection rate again? Whatever, open back up, everyone get vaccine chance get it. rest people don’t want fine let die, apologies though immunodeficient. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Also, mandates lifted, people claim want control us. Weird.... Well speed bloody vaccines it’s far slow last month two think delusional anti-vaxxers delusional anti-maskers vaccine available entirely truthful? Get outta here. Panicking helps nobody situation. Panic yourself. us (myself included) can’t yet get vaccine immunocompromised continue vigilant precautions take invest kn95s. absolutely lie. What's alternative, police see someone without mask stop ask see vaccine card? Yeah, let's see fly defund police crowd. Every damn special interest group complain they're targeted. would end straight white men (I'm straight...so say that) could asked show vaccine card, make news. matter who's lying vaccine not? certain point, chosen vaxxed, chosen put risk. people complaining unvaxxed masked people putting risk, get vax worry? I'll believe scientific studies sufficient sample size conducted actual data, instead self-reporting. Would believe study shows average penis size 13 inches involved self reporting? lack better study doesn;t mean one would make sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

All go CDC data, shows nothingburger kids. wnat kids, spread fake science. Dude, brought shit like month ago argument antivaxer vaccines, adamant one would legitimately lie vaccination status.

I shit not, like couple days later, story california bartender selling fake vaccine cards came out. Yeah feel scared taking mask off, know got it. would majorly hypocritical stop following science advocating year. despite that, rate dying car accident astronomically higher getting sick COVID. policy administration giving up? add another circle that? rhymes ""lying"" Omg hope get felonies. Hopefully adults vaccinated indeed enough prevent widespread school outbreaks. guess we'll see. That’s good know PA mask mandate already effectively vaccinated people. FYI. PA health department updated policy immediately cdc announcement. would liked people 12 could weeks get vaccinated bump numbers up. CDC’s responsibility maintain healthy workforce keep economy running. 

Weird. [About makes mention stewardship economy. 

They say something scientific data driving decisions, though. Base public health decisions highest quality scientific data derived openly objectively

Can link learned Center Disease Control weighs macroeconomic indicators say, controlling spread disease? Cheers. going back OP's post, far away vaccine offering protection.

Yes. That's started comment ""right.""  bit odd haha. Anyways orange/brown/white shirt bottom right fav  want good representation sets' sizes sizes intersections, best option probably [UpSet need expert know people going lie. 🙃 shit. actual numbers many people can't get vax due legit reasons 100, 1000, etc....? know you’re talking people lying, that’s legitimately happened household. April/may 2020 whole household 101+ temperatures county testing people required hospitalization. waited miserable 3 weeks.

Of course still wore masks got vaccinated soon possible, lack tests early/mid 2020 definitely thing. Doubtful.

Well made properly worn damn near 100% clinical settings. lead horse water, can't make drink. shit they’ll lie think difference states Maine AZ FL also cities jobs, young people Maine get fuck cause there’s nothing them. It’s nice place live. nice place start career, social life, etc. WELL EXPERT LYING (DEFINITELY LYING) SAY PEOPLE LIE! ESPECIALLY INTERNET!

/s Almost like mutate break past inoculation goal; sure result. might dumb question, wouldn’t considered service animal? I’ve always told, service animal trained specific tasks. sounds like they’re well trained environment too. So, like, *Mayflower* sailed back 1600s, England load biggest idiots? we've working gene pool ever since? I'm honestly confused countries trusting vaccinated people catch spread covid. know much less likely, still likely. least country directions ""get vaccinated turn comes, still take precautions"". definitive proof covid vaccines stop spread covid? i'd LOVE that. can't wait get vaccine, know even totally safe catching it. (I safer regards dying huge plus course) Clinical Social Worker here; stand nurses. okay? never argued that. People responsible taking vaccine clear wildly successful little chance serious long term adverse effects, free, go doctor get it, need insurance. system suck need complete overhaul? Absolutely. remove responsibility people live society therefore personal responsibilities. jobs also responsibilities, like letting time get shots. programs bring shots can't come get them. cut ""it's system's fault"" bit recognize people specifically making point flaunt getting vaccinated, spread propaganda convince others, intentionally lie, bought fake vaccination cards, etc. I’ve already read comments local news feed like “well, guess I’m vaccinated lol”… frustrating. youngest can’t get vaccine later year, nothing really changes me. agree more. CDC knows they're doing. Well work Turkey red list. equally could pick another country effect Human nature tends towards selfishness. Vilifying side accelerates that. flipping factories war-time action done necessity. lot optimizations made society help war rolled back afterwards oppressing minority groups fun guess. Seems like medical consensus variant exceedingly unlikely different enough make really hurt vaccine value. 

Decent chance could still lead mild cases, overall expect variants drive hospitalizations/deaths. 

The way explained mutation significant enough make vaccines useless, would basically changing COVID together likelihood make far less transmissible (e.g. big change spike protein) That's little unfair. imagine everybody who's sneeze cough last year half wondered whether covid-19. know did. reason believe pretty strong reaction vaccine. Experts say they'll lie??? COVIDiots say they'll lie themselves... need expert relay message. think data transmissibility Vaccinated people fully settled. saw CDC said believe probability transmission vaccinated person low. still, zero. far knowing vaccinated people still catch virus, yes. :-) Vaccinations Kevlar force field around bodies actively repelling virus. know. also know it’s rare uncommon vaccinated people get breakthrough infections efficacy symptomatic COVID 100%. will, however, take 95% efficacy even mild symptomatic COVID well far looks like 100% protection Severe disease death day. however continue mask personal reasons, well noted, transmissibility vaccinated persons fully settled yet. Better safe sorry. Good thing they're real people, might care die. don’t trust anybody, you’re vaccinated you’re protect anyone could type vaccine. Even so, tbh. trust science situations, parents often things create safe environment possible, as: using baby gates around stairs, following food safety protocols, safely educating children hazards stoves fireplaces, trying avoid cancer-causing issues filtering water, visiting doctor, avoiding lead-based paints, etc. get risks small, implement safety precautions. said needing advocate implement safety precautions regard covid young children. person responded provide links elsewhere *long-term* concerns regarding children get covid. It’s legitimate concern parents want protect children government won’t. Went farming supply store yesterday majority customers conservative, highly opinionated, vocal. employees looked worst weekend lives. Well see long lasts. people get taste freedom it’s like live normally there’s way anybody wearing mask anywhere anymore. immune compromised doctor told get vaccinated. 

Unless there's something additional going friend get second opinion. COVID vaccines perfectly safe people types immune system deficiencies drug related suppression. vast majority people either inborn deficiency drug-related suppression also still derive good deal protection vaccinations. CDC accounted this. You’re gonna fine.  first thought. Throwing rule early asking disaster gut tells CDC accounted unvaccinated taking masks.

I lots respect nurses, hard job do, public health experts. 

Lastly, scientists agree, CDC agency charge public health response virus saw ability make change it.

To clear expert stretch imagination, point folks accept guidance changed, ifs wherefores understandable, necessarily change things. course they'll lie.  Headline says doctors baffled kinda got tricked. mean, labs work infectious diseases extremely robust protocols prevent exactly that, chances something “slipping out” actually pretty low. 

Even then, let’s assume happen - highly unlikely, impossible. scientific community wouldn’t hide it, would they? Scientists would want publicly identify went wrong could implement new protocols nationwide prevent ever happening again, especially since safety culture nowadays places blame structural rather personal failings - ie: expect humans humans make mistakes, mistake happens it’s person’s fault, rules systems place simply adequate enough (this baring gross negligence course). institution would nothing gain covering caused outbreak - especially forward could help contain outbreak prevent another one lab. 

Scientists study infectious diseases aren’t nefarious villains, they’re people care saving lives - that’s whole point studying infectious diseases! kind people dedicate lives pursuit kind people withhold life saving information like that. exceptionalism lot cases. article BBC summed well. present sympathetic light people they're interviewing heading India funerals weddings distant cousins etc. considering UK stage allowed wedding funeral like 6 people attend, bit pisstake. people assume ""it'll never happen me"", ""I'll alright matter"" coworkers do. vaccinated, plan it, brag taking advantage change. angers selfish. 



This toxic mindset get nowhere. got vaccine believe works matter someone else gets vaccine wears mask. part experts say extremely unlikely get seriously ill spread Covid. let people get skin. saying flu. flu kill family. Covid-19 did.


I'm truly sorry hear this. Everytime read someone lost family members Covid breaks heart. really hope make peace past year. IKR?! I'm 30 something y.o. I'll probably encounter virus thousands times lifetime. I've probably encountered viruses I'm vaccinated hundreds times never even clue. Might've even tested positive checked right time,who knows? point transmit get sick much possible. covid vaccines things splendidly, enormous win science. story players stands prove even more. today's news, water wet. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lots people wearing masks rural community. Fewer masking CDC announcement. Went CVS day despite removing mask mandate, saw people wearing masks inside first time year. point? Fauci less 100% forthcoming multiple issues multiple times. 
Personally, think time full open time drop masks. think data needs come that.
I've vax Pfizer since January (healthcare worker) I'm planning masking I'm stores etc . . . quite time. cuz there'll plenty unvax around believe CDC/Gov plan get many vax possible go horde immunity (😹). entail ton ppl still spreading virus around, getting sick, die, etc. . . perhaps that's way get many dumbasses country I'm planning going way possibly wind sick and/or asymptomatic spreader sake jagoff's smugly announcing, ""dude never wore mask, never stopped partying."" vaccinated, others lie want. affect what? I'm vaccinated. give shit non-vaccinated person lies vaccinated order wear mask. they're putting non-vaccinated contacts risk.

The immunocompromised people continue double-mask get vaccine rest us get vaccine going get it.

Let kill end hospital kill themselves. care less.  Anti-maskers kind people would cough face make point. children often understand abstract concepts like disease spread radii well adult could. young kids, I'd still worried. really aren't. worn mask 4 months since got shot, nobody anywhere said done anything me. 3 different states, gym, walmart, target, home depot, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cases going 46/50 states. remaining 4 gotten low can't really drop 70%. 56%, covid literally dead there. drop basically zero 45% adults. 

&amp;#x200B;

If trust people responsible state's well-being, 28/50 say masks. don’t give shit that, personally. long get herd immunity (huge if), couldn’t care less think virus conspiracy order get Trump White House, dumbass safe work that’s good enough  Doesn’t help don’t backing management. afraid bad Yelp reviews…. identify vaccinated. What’s wrong that? How’s different man identifying woman? that’s somehow accepted today’s society. CDC knows many unvaccinated people lie status. issued revised standards vaccinated people anyway, mind. me, says risk vaccinated people low, even lying unvaccinated people mix.  sub reddit studies show obvious? Watch read Expanse think varies place place culture. many places it’s totally normal bring dogs pub, say. it’s well-behaved dog, don’t see issue. Yes, dogs aren’t well behaved, people aren’t well behaved let go pretty much anywhere. Experts? Common sense says they'll lie. fact defending states response crazy me. made horrible decisions nursing homes, closed extremely low risk areas, still bad second wave. really naive think covid hung around NJ NY first awhile. child dies car accident someone else something reckless endanger health (say drunk driver parent fails use proper child seat safety belt), I’d upset asymptomatic Covid career refuses get vaccinated decides lie vaccinated goes without mask indoor location. point, vaccination options would keep getting spreading disease, it’s different drunk driver gets behind wheel instead ordering Uber unvaccinated anti-vaxxers. Thing is, really matter? vaxxed, unvaxxed, masked not, can't get sick. they'll get one another sick. Get vaxxed morons morons. It'll like drunk drivers kill drunk drivers. cares? Good riddance! I'm confused. use punctuation? you’re vaccinated, care don’t want one don’t want take precautions? Honestly curious. Everyone ready new spike possible new variant? seems like US sure is. Can't refuse service? Oh trust agree general consensus seems goal eradicate biggest covid denier family nurse.

This statement come zero surprise doctor, PA, pharmacist, Hospital Director. Unless develops variant vaccines effective against. someone states. worthless sacks filth refuse wear masks lie wear masks. doubt mind all. That's 54% population 1 30% 2 jabs. 

But importantly ~100% vulnerable groups. hard say, 2nd Moderna shot worse 1st tired day. Went work took easy. really different everyone. 

If think COVID 1st Pfizer shot likely Mild bunch IMO. CDC couldn’t get effective Covid test deployed ? guidance misguided. mean It’s meant incentivize fence sitters get vaccinated, I’m sure even confident strategy won’t backfire. honestly don’t care. vaccinated. want get COVID fine maybe fine. give rest vaccines South America. health reasons one take covid vaccines? Yes, told either lie get want tell truth get want, plenty people choose former. 

I find bit humorous people pay money get something given free though. Kinda reminds bottled water gym whatever. like...you realize water bottle costs less case water. also keep arguing reddit. Legislation always solved reddit comments. Lol yeah shit. Go twitter read replies CDC announcement. Inswear half upset fact get feel morally superior public anymore really know else could do, keep waiting something end that's never going to.

I think could waited another month two 12+ year olds time get vaccinated. right there's much else could really done. People adamant vaccination never going it, would kind give us little bit defense continue cases decline across United States (as we're seeing right now) summer. honestly think we're super close essentially coming close possible ending crisis across country, we're tripping right finish line this.  Brace COVID vaccine version ""Show (vaccine) papers! "" implemented oversight/control/ enforcement mechanism. 

 Also, know vaccine card forgers already prepared that....

 next idea accurately identifying vaccinated ppl going be?  

 Imposing societal expectations, rules laws, effective mechanism enforcement, going devolve enforcement coersion: Enforceable threats, shaming, fear &amp; intimidation.  lasting change achieved tactic. lottery payout policy making life miserable choose vaccinate what’s needed say first vaccine past week waiting second several weeks now. complaint going terribly slow so, people knows problems (not old (+60) immunocompromised) getting vaccines reason family immunocompromised live area heavily masks, among things, disagree there. also work people immunocompromised. Right. I'm arguing that. People choose, yes. asked would threat anyone, would risking safety, threat unvaccinated people taking precautions avoid contacting spreading Covid.

It's choice point though. opportunity vaccinate, chose it. I'm arguing choice, talking consequences.

When mask orders social distancing restrictions lifted vaccinated people, little worry - even unvaccinated people. point time, unvaccinated people assume risks protection. virus spreads exponentially, that’s nothing new. nothing whether vaccinated people, must think protected serious illness death, wear masks. people hear headline ""put aside mask.""

Only stupid people. Imagine trusting neighbors again... horror  Polls far shown who've already taken vaccine risk averse people still terrified getting covid vaccinated, checks out. Fact is, pandemic made ton people traumatized terrified going out, still see kind masking (if ever). Easiest paycheck ever. subreddit turned cesspool. share concerns you. also read studies CDC links behind recommendations make conclusions. lot people clearly not, want information supports personal agenda.  hurts heart got downvoted. too. I'm sure coincidence ran day. Lol. Nope. Vaccinated people shed virus like unvaccinated people. amount vaccinated person shed get virus going small virus mutate. Unvaccinated people spread virus could mutate something vaccinated crowd can't take much happens..right vaccines cover variants including indian one fine right now. Things would drastically change virus vaccinated people safe...especially booster shot every year. already get basically booster shot every year flu... It'll thing new variants covid. Yeah people vaccinated, supposed punished people lie? top public health experts quit pushing herd immunity months months ago. 

Because it’s going happen. 

We aren’t going get enough people vaccinated. there’s going variants every year like flu. 

If wait herd immunity never go back way things were. “living life” means never dining indoors restaurant going bar, good you. that’s people. live, tried grocery store, they’d tell them, it’s safe inside reasonable accommodations, someone grab groceries them, curb side pickup. also rare see someone wearing well fitted mask wasn’t properly covering face. But, lie, God, punish form plague disease... 

&amp;#x200B;

:O guidance doesn’t /rely/ honor system (a) vaccinated people protected unvaccinated people, (b) millions people, including children young 12, vaccinated every day, (c) vaccines tested children ages.

This part someone mentions sympathetic outlier (immunocompromised people, children, immunocompromised children) CDC didn’t think first. head obvious I’m massively ending mask mandate hiring, probably. main issue businesses look way unmasked customers waltz in, poor employee goes offer mask, act like personal attack. everyone okay that, business concerned profit margins. area, grown used this, especially police dont help either. couple grocery stores tried call 911 aggressive anti-maskers, police refused cooperate said ""police matter"", even though area mask mandate. everyone got clue, stores businesses scared report stuff.  agree they’ve given mask war? statement policies, absolute negligence human behavior start. Like bunch lab nerds didn’t meet behavioral psychologists point studies show vaccines highly effective. point risk getting adverse events closer level risk like flu. also shown infected unlikely infect others. also shown parties vaccinated, likelihood infection two significantly decreased. onus protection becomes unvaccinated. mostly ok without mask flu season, equivalent risk profile without mask vaccinated covid.  agree lot people vaxxed month two now? wearing mask much bother you? 

[Public health experts: we're going keep wearing CNN May 14th Yeah already asked, waiting response. anyone source I’d take that.  Lol, true. guess everyone “a moral compass” justification whatever want I'm fully vaccinated, intend wearing mask every place business, we're vaccinated. interest bio terrorist spreading deadly virus causing fear terror work retail. What’s alternative? rest lives, selfish assholes can't get vaccinated? antivaxxers important immunocompromised people? CDC also took like what, 8 months recognize airborne transmission indeed thing? ""expert rule"" dangerous. People feel entitled solid answers adress concerns, ""trust us, smart lab coats, going work"". know rate, many students high school teach getting vaccinated recent weeks. know typically absent second dose come school reporting horrible reactions it.

It's actually heartwarming always thank it. One thing think lot people consider incredibly lucky got SARS-Cov2 mild (infection rates mortality). happens next pandemic 10x 100x worse still refusers deniers disinformation spreaders?.. gonna apocalyptic nightmare. prefer 70 ten thousand? Good thing matter, vaccines work.  link? I've unable find it. screw kids careless parents? realize medicine practice right? professionals always agree, oh insane pressure last president might something it.

Sure though, let's listen nurses, next let's listen CNAs custodians. whole article daft seem hellbent bashing CDC actually discussing anything point.

Have good day, go take walk something. No, wear mask anytime I'm situation might exposed (always wear one indoor public spaces, wear outdoors prolonged close contact people outside family group.) get hard understand? actually vaccine affect you? Honestly it’s unvaccinated people playing Russian roulette covid no? I’m expert, also say people lie. Source: Trust I'm surprised vaccinations added state ID yet. considering adults refusing vaccinations already mostly wearing masks. primarily rural areas low vaccination rates. assure nobody's wearing masks anyways. issue pre-widespread vaccine availability. vaccine widely available, let Darwinism take course think CDC took consideration coming recommendation? But...it isn’t going made mandatory participate society, that’s thing. can’t rely won’t happen legal level, unless it’s specific businesses. couldn’t even scrap together vaccine passport apps time. I'm expert fucking know people lie. People fucking worst. That's question doctor. Zero percent risk attainable goal. vaccines available already less effective mutations already there

Yep, binary thing - vaccines 95% effective OG COVID that's amazingly high. looking like 75% effective South Africa variant that's till pretty good that's lot smaller 95%! We're already screwing treating 95% 100%, treating 75% like 100% disaster SA variant takes hold. Measles x 1 = 95%

Measles x 2 = 99% least I’d agree *except* many cases, I’ve personally seen news, anti-maskers getting sick going “I didn’t think it’d happen me!”

I also hear way much conversation people plan evade workplace restrictions they’re back office. 

Basically, last 18 months particular 5 years general shredded faith humanity. U.K. 2nd lowest infection rate Europe behind Iceland. Also tourist £££ CDC discussion behind closed doors doubt also crunched numbers competing interests commerce human lives. People discussion among now. all, affects lives directly lives people love. people putting two two together claiming CDC's job better them. People love punishing others refusing go along them...

&amp;#x200B;

If vaxed want be, care. problem. It’s “follow science” “science” conflicts priors. Political theatre, around. don’t grand moral compass everyone expects.

You bring interesting point. dislike Antivaxxers average poster sub. may convinced gather execute them. (kidding, course) 

They generally moral compass worth using, may think do, they're likely thinking preventing people getting vaccinated right thing do. Obviously that's wrong, see way. Oh interesting. That's good know. Many adults know plan continue children want extra layer protection, plus want model kids. people stupid fully vaccinated people 2 weeks beyond final shot two shot regimen 4 weeks Jansen. 4-6 weeks first shot depending vaccine. even though younger teens eligible vaccinated, none fully vaccinated yet since approved age group. schools following CDC guidelines. how? It’s pretty obvious anti vaxx aren’t changing mind.

The hardcore anti-vaxx lot smaller percentage people would get vaccine made mandatory participate society going forward. Hell, even lottery Ohio least attempt. Tieing mask wearing unenforced honor system completely got rid incentive someone fence get vaccine, got rid protection people anti-vaccine/maskers since people went along masking everyone else was, people gonna stop now. offence like, fucking shit they'll lie means subjected 'horrors' wearing piece fabric face. LOL…no, it’s not. traces 5nm. billions traces chip.  7th 10th graders became eligible vaccine week ago. need two doses (3 weeks apart) plus two weeks considered fully vaccinated. school know US students chance get fully vaccinated. recognize guy...he's actually toned list. used say stuff like anyone leaving house wear full PAPR SCBA, along tyvek suit (with zippers, seams cuffs double-taped). Also claimed open doors elbow (not bad idea guess, unless pull side) immediately sanitize elbow. first bullet point ""what learning"" section says unlikely pass on. Please read again. reflexive lockdowns Australia.

""*the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said would lockdowns least 100 new infections per day 14 consecutive days.*""  Like said, they're going mental gymnastics matter reinforce conclusions want believe. Herd immunity doesn’t mean new cases.  I'm actually hoping speeds things bit. Let maskers/ anti vaxers lie get COVID. I'm praying lies resistance take us closer herd. Children really issue. trying prevent severe cases deaths, positive tests. Cancer patients immune suppressed strangers avoiding pathogens, coronavirus. probably let physicians tell proceed rather assuming adjusting behavior based assumptions. 

Not sure are, around lot people wearing masks months. whole last 15 months. multiple studies showing likelihood fully vaccinated people transmitting virus small. people risky wear mask risky wearing masks already been.

And masks still required places ""large number"" people described likely time, still seeing issue. hope masks still mandatory flights, else visit America, again.. guess many same.. Good parents stuck rock hard place. 

Where live, schools already dropped mask requirements, Governor dropped mandates month ago, people outright ignore signs store…but can’t afford quit job put kids bubble. I'm big fan masks, masks much less effective preventing Covid vaccines, incentive get people vaccinated (which is) help children/immunocompromised mask mandates. People lie vaccinated going wearing masks effectively, anyway. FUCKING WORLD NEEDS EXPERT FUCKING ANYTHING TELL THIS?! fucking joke. mask preventing spreading it, getting it... still lot kids can’t get vaccinated yet. one seems give shit anymore. #1 thing driving crazy news. So. Many. Redditors. think they’re first wonder “but people lie vaccinated?! anyone considered that?!?” Agreed. whole “live life” phrase overly emotional nonsense. living life put seatbelt? transmissibility new variants screwing lot countries right now. They'll really consider lock deal it. ""Stop testing, testing positive cases have.""

I feel like someone said something similar. timing. couldn’t wait weeks opened age group bit announcement? poorly handled around umm.. I'm sure right place question. past 8 days pink eye(redness along irritation, rubbing feels nice). 2 days ago spotted [this weird skin collar bone. 

I symptoms could COVID? know there's way sure, testing centers filled brim patients. go sure shot way contact virus already. So, someone could tell me, probable symptoms indicative COVID19? kids aren’t eligible yet.  It’s interesting seeing friends pretty pro CDC following guidelines Announcement day like “yeah I’ll continue wear mask” Like decided ignore CDC go personal agenda instead aren’t reaching 70% though. assume current rate continue. It’s going continue. 

Not people plan getting vaccines gotten them. However, don’t make enough population carry us 70%. numbers stop climbing make 70%, they’ll start slowing well even get close floodgate flow slows trickle, stragglers getting vaccine. Fully half GOP won’t get any, well 40% black community. believe cdc made recommendations? Also, exactly pressuring remove mask guidelines? Biden, guy pretty pro mask? I'm honestly curious. Went restaurant friday wait staff wearing masks. agree. feels amazingly weird think take time get used me. People area saying publicly Nextdoor “identify” vaccinated, wearing mask anymore. don’t even guess they’ll lie—plenty admitting it. You’re considering kids approved soon. Dude went coma year come back DT. Guy thinks it’s May 2020. unfortunately people think vaccinating children protecting Trust people hoard hand sanitizer toilet paper since beginning. happened there? Plus vaccines available already less effective mutations already virus continue mutate. people fucking scumbags. live Europe. company used work counted 'essential' staff got covid flu vaccines work, skipping queue age group. HR said they'd serious conversations anyone refused get flu covid jab. I’d read Brazil difference kids low rates MMR vaccine, protective severe covid. Maybe info outdated? quick search found (make sure kids up-to-date MMR vaccines UK also 'non serious hospitalisations', basically described Guess I'm expert. Well, still waiting, help Surinam one go, fine that. vaccinations going rapidly speeding up.  sure. unvaccinated go scientists continue mask up? Obviously no. There’s problem. believe CDC fucked grandiose manner Alex Jones going blow gasket. everyone wanted vacine gotten it. exceptions mass transit, hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons include schools

That's guidance schools separate, completely invalidates point. last update adults. Right people panic buying gas. That’s like thing point. literally definition negative effect cisgendered guys.  feel that. state never mask policy went grocery store today honestly surprised see like 90% people still wearing masks. I'm fully vaccinated plan wearing mask potentially crowded public indoor settings least next 2-3 weeks see things shake new CDC guidance. really feel need wear one outdoors anymore though. yeah I'm kind along lines play safe see happens. Hospital stays USA expensive. person could easily go debt getting COVID. I'd argue bad financial health choice.  understand CDC's information risk vaccinated people think ""overlooked"" children, understand risk low even unvaccinated.

""18 under"" demographic 24% US population. 300 500k+ covid deaths people 18 under. 24% population 0.06% covid deaths. that’s taking selfish stance. sure it’s different far away stance assholes taking. It’s easy want say there’s still people want vaccine can’t get due whatever reason need to, point, shame every idiot getting vaccine getting it. sake everyone else’s. It’s you. It’s convincing people don’t see point getting vaccinated get shot showing life look like. rage want ending pandemic enough carrot fact it’s not. Societies complex beasts. 


You think about: 
\- science 
\- behavior individuals 
\- behavior individuals group scale 
\- alter behavior group scale. 
\- Related above, enforce it. 


If could make guidance spreadsheet every single individual US column gives recommendation based current status expect follow it, we'd golden. Unfortunately work way. 


So articles threads like these, there's 2 conflicting point views: 


Point view A) : 
Society best serve many people vaccinated cost, can't expect fringe should, let's toss carrot stick little enforcement, hope personal responsibility honor systems urge many possible go get vaccine. significant portion lie, overall come ahead. 


Point view B): 
Since impossible verify everyone honest, significant portion get vaccine lie it. They'll put vulnerable can't get vaccinated risk (masks measures work best sides follow them), unrealistic risk stay nuclear bunker forever. Since can't easily verify who's vaccinated isn't, better keep blanket mask mandates weeks larger portion population vaccinated, reducing residual risks non-vaccinated. point we'll able lift mandates. 


So yeah, I'm vaccinated know I'll safe. I'm also able trust know me. making policies scale lot complicated single individual's situation. virus girl.

So that's China able kill fast. think CDC wants people follow guidance. they’re saying accurate. Human behavior different story one knows sure going happen. think premature essentially drop masks everyone especially kids vaccinated fall. work states COVID response team, already people asking I’ll make fake proof vaccine card them. (Don’t worry cannot would never) I’m certain lying. thread wearing masks.

Flippantly spoken like someone never deal medical issues outside control. Learn compassion. Walensky, CDC also says students safe they’re 3ft apart schools, claim ZERO scientific basis even COVID-19 wasn’t airborne.

They lied intentionally, plain simple, wouldn’t put past again. thinking **Euler diagram**.

**Venn diagrams** always options present - even areas kept empty. 

[Comparison CDC says vaccinated people take masks says continue wear. CDC says 12+ year olds vaccinated says nope, stop vaccinating children.

Mixed messaging everywhere, whole thing ridiculous one cares us immunosuppressants anymore either. Oh wait, never did. trickling declining daily. rate 70% ever happen many states.  fair point. think vaccine passport program would good solution. Anti-vaxxers ""right"" ignorant plague rats, rest us right exist public without putting us risk. they're ready rejoin society, free access vaccine.  Much way idiots without masks make argument inconvenienced, someone vulnerable take extra steps protected fucking idiots? become selfish society? went country able flip factories make tanks fight world war fighting three ply fabric. Good fucking grief. taking one slant scientific studies reading. CDC limits studies breakthrough cases

This NEW policy putting place information breakthrough cases well established point, including huge study posted Friday saying vaccines 94% effective real-world healthcare study - statement way base.

No, isn't, studies consistently shown exactly that. vaccinated, risk INCREDIBLY low. tons studies done here, Israel, Qatar, places world show exact thing. PLEASE READ. one reason India much trouble. 

You people need stop bringing India, makes look foolish. 3-5% country vaccinated, country BILLION people. experiencing current crisis. NOTHING like India either vaccine rollout day day hygiene practices social norms. way apt comparison brought stoke fear. stop. positive outlook account variant emergence, account waning immunity.

Again, study study showing mRNA vaccines still highly effective variants. new one posted Oxford today shows Indian variant actually less concern South African variant (for vaccines STILL effective). please stop parroting ignorant line. 

As waning immunity, 6 month data mark still 90% efficacy measured continuing trial participants. indication drop steeply point, anything saying contrary speculation conjecture. DATA refutes far. 

So please stop. Everything confidently espousing straight misleading misrepresenting facts tons studies shut everything saying. risk vaccinated individuals zero? No. However LOW basically background noise supports dropping precautionary measures people vaccinated individuals. 

So please, stop. clearly wrong. Much way idiots without masks make argument inconvenienced, someone vulnerable take extra steps protected fucking idiots? become selfish society? went country able flip factories make tanks fight world war fighting three ply fabric. Good fucking grief. House - ""everybody lies"" would loved able things summer kids (9 6), vaccinated, everyone masked, could taken zoo, parks, gardens. don’t know person next zoo without mask vaccinated not. also pass kids become asymptomatic carrier. 

So would think wear masks everybody eligible vaccination much ask, country.  And? get sick asymptomatic form virus like cold less spread viral load cut 95% so... matter. scared virus fully vaccinated idk tell you. Wear mask forever. exactly point guidance change - provide visible incentive get vaccinated. “Get vaccinated pretend doesn’t anything don’t change single thing” never going effective strategy convince lazy hesitant. Precaution point concrete proof vaccines effectively prevent infection well transmission validated studies - need precaution among vaccinated people gone. issue tell vaccinated isn’t - would better use time effort would figure validate. get businesses don’t want vaccine police they’ve already effectively mask police - isn’t much different. Except places required going disappear, exposing kids access vaccines. forgot say ""immunocompromised"" ""pregnant"" like eight times. I’m expert KNOW they’ll lie. becoming [common unlikely pass vaccinated.   Covid going end joining flu seasonal rotation illnesses vaccines, imagine. basically impossible stamp something subtle respiratory virus, especially one carry animals. someone expecting smallpox-like vaccine win remember wildly different smallpox (severe obvious symptoms) respiratory illness ask realistically trying exterminate influenza. interpret CDC ruling. said fully vaccinated individuals risk spreading COVID others, risk infected others.

The non-vaccinated mask adverse crew going continue handing Darwin Awards other. 

If parent young children, still need protect others, though risk also low. problems slowly cajoling resisters along, eventually keeping planes, cruise ships, schools time right (I.e. 100% shown available want it). rest unfortunately become politics Okay control that... enjoy life fully vaccinated person cause one spreading virus anymore. people scared? fully vaccinated good enjoy. Others still wearing masks. Sure, get “let Darwinism take course” intended pointed people willfully endangering themselves. I’m saying, it’s important forget people declining vaccines also willfully endangering others, can’t choose get vaccine currently. What? course it’s crime lie greeter. It’s absolutely damn crime forge federal document. Republicans. Anti-vaxxers. Anti-maskers. “Is based science”? seems like bold statement. CDC made up? yep... fellow new yorker here, hairguynyc, that's I'm concerned about. Cuomo could drop mask mandate tomorrow, I'm worried he'll still keep ""must seated"" rule bars real reason. would continue decimate industry. Wearing mask transmit deadly disease bending backwards? Selfish. really think nurses union called revision masks doesn’t care vaccinations? feeling worried too. sounds like want find excuse listen legitimate concerns masking. issues, dont choose one care about. there's difference service animals emotional support animals. service animals allowed anywhere, emotional support animal isn't, though difficult enforce. I'm expert looked much it, work grocery store someone animal control explain me. issues someone bringing emotional support dog. we're allowed ask animal help disability, there's nothing stop lying can't ask proof. Recent study showed low antibodies observed immunosuppressive treatments past due disease like cancer.  Tbh, think consequence us ""Vaccinated, dont care"" crowd decided acceptable. indeed happens, know blame. act actions happen isolation, laxation masks vaccination lead loosening pandemic protocols well, increase odds re-emergence.   common person doesn’t understand “science” big ass process gathering data. know nothing scientific method. Data needs interpreted, conclusions drawn analysis. 

People keep screaming “trust science” - “the science” collective opinions formed tangible people, influenced agenda. “The science” actually data there, anyone interpret draw conclusions. “The science” statistics/data shows us Covid still around, Covid still sucks, masks pretty effective, vaccines effective. info transformed public policy entirely subjective. Science neither right wrong, resulting opinions be. One single high profile case COVID shut entire NBA season. it’s prevalent, it’s “no big deal”. “science” didn’t change opinions sure did. OP said allowed travel, said discouraged I'm agreeing with. I'm debating fully vaccinated people, I'm talking rest. many 10000 came back India last month fully vaccinated? Less half? Pfizer best results vs South African variant 75%, comparison 97% known variants, opinion cause concern... 

What mean lockdown China? We're long gone past stage hot takes coming ""the CDC guidance terrible people lie!"" getting pretty cringey. people really think they're much smarter doctors scientists thought that? Yeah. You’re right. can’t that. aren’t United community. It’s would force vaccinated protected live rest lives they’re not, I’m that. Oh yeah agree, feel way, lot friends happy news came out. Mostly unvaccinated ones Average new hospitalizations lowest point since April 3 **2020**, basically days started keeping track metrics nationally. expand, yes, people lie think it’s normal difficulty changing behavior felt necessary safety long. I’m personally happy drop mask soon, admit probably feel uncomfortable while. I'm omniscient confirm this. can't fix stupid. hold-outs get sick, it. hope one dies, will. hospitals expecting another COVID wave unvaccinated. children, 12 vaccinated danger children, least variants common U.S., minimal. always calculus cost minimizing spread disease cost economy aspects life. Mental health, especially school-age kids, taken big hit year. Time ditch masks get back normalcy.  Everyone lies, including experts. said people wear masks last year? Oh right guy heading COVID task force. blatantly lied everyone there'd masks health professionals. guarantee next mutation, one break vaccine? 

I know want go away one saying travel banned, cause know want argue.

Plus mentioned anything lockdown three years plus? Maybe, maybe get wish coronavirus mutates one virulent deadly.

No I'm suggesting show little restraint caution. already gas station attendant try convince wife ok remove masks because, due medical privacy laws, nobody really ask you’ve vaccinated not.

We kind stared like hurry ring shit up, Patrick CDC staffed highly qualified epidemiologists scientists. Surely must taken consideration issuing guidelines? People free mask want; one follow science unmask they’re fully vaccinated. didn’t realize I’m expert, I’ll try live title read again:

Direct quote - ""Early data show vaccines help keep people symptoms spreading COVID-19.""

Awful lot qualifiers sentence go away ""unlikely pass on"" Agree. Despite fact masks get publicity, really big deal. ban in-person gatherings pretty much killed life used know it. People suppressed immune system often cannot produce antibodies response vaccine. Even get vaccinated may protected. That's fair. immensely frustrated solution folks particular situation seem given act like we're 12 monkeys forever. it’s them. It’s also immuno compromised, cancer chemo patients, kids. hard continue mask indoors months kids get vaccinated really bolster herd immunity?

And somewhat deserve also don’t want see thousands deaths among willfully unvaccinated many innocent families suffer well.

I’m calling shutdowns “not living lives” whatever exaggerated bs. I’m saying masks easy effective. Let’s keep months kids get vaccinated. ask election. Went grocery store without mask today (governor lifted restrictions “vaccinated people only” stores dropped requirements completely. I’m 3 months post vaccination FWIW) didn’t feel right all. felt way aware facial expressions lol ""It time people sleep beds made.""

The problem logic though,.. individualized-risk. like wearing bicycle-helmet choosing wear condom.

Infectious communicable diseases COMMUNITY wide health issue (IE = takes small percentage unhygienic people spread sickness wider population)

Pandemics beaten using coordinated teamwork. doctor know nurses. straight don’t care Vaxxed. people huge family get together November. That’s choice parents. don’t agree choice it’s make.  political aims. worried kid health, worried economy etc.  I'm sick ignorant comment. know vaccine even effective us. comment reddit! Weak troll Look stats coming out. United States, let alone multitudes second third world countries, never reach full vaccination. You’re free always wear mask, saying one follow science unmask they’re fully vaccinated. Surely decision relax masks made knowledge people lie. can't say messaging, know anyone wants vaccine opportunity get it, time let without wild will. Immunocompromised people adjust new reality point, point. effort wear Mask near zero. means benefit wearing Masks little bit 0 would worth it. mean get protection it. likely response get 3 week interval plenty sufficient, considering studies place around 95%. There's little reason believe waiting longer give robust protection that, delaying second dose additional weeks means weeks less protected, likely good reason all. 

What ultimately want vaccine antibodies. Antibodies disappear months matter dose. want generation memory cells ready activate upon re-exposure virus.  

Stick tested interval protected within slightly month starting. fact protection least maintained even extented interval second dose good know countries shortage doses (which makes easier plan), take tested intervals there's reason so. really think CDC didn’t take account people would lie? scientists epidemiologists decided policy never considered that? one wants vaccine still? 0 people vaccinated yesterday? unreasonable expect fully vaccinated individuals travel. vaccines work variants. BioNTech works South African variant. Unless lock like China never get rid virus. That’s it’s always America. don’t even guarantee health insurance children.

I’m saying par course. I’m parent two could give zero fucks government doesn’t do. I’m going make sure kids safe. sucks can’t actually look but, said, good parents take things hands matter what.  people take extra precautions first place? think stance regards willfully decline vaccine, also wear masks public. Hospital work outbreaks unvaccinated nurses staff refusing vaccine. takes idiots ruin everyone also Starbucks barista... store refused service anyone wearing mask. That's case almost aspects pandemic, virologists, immunologists epidemiologists nurses, doctors even politicians. People cherry pick whatever information reinforces viewpoint reject anything contradictory message prompted public health officials many states, including Virginia Maryland, District Columbia align new guidance encourage primary-care doctors — might vaccinate patients time — administer doses without worrying much wastage. two weeks ago, supply outstripped demand, forcing public health officials rely doctor’s offices, mobile units small sites vaccinate people want go way shot, hard reach hesitant. recently spent 20 minutes gently debunking conspiracy theories parroted patient mistrusts media’s reporting pandemic, believing vaccine would make sicker virus cases deaths overblown. Quel surprise, need experts tell us this? Indian variant probably isnt gonna ba problem UK keeps vaccinating ""But good news **increasing confidence vaccine works variant**, strategy track - virus gained bit pace we've therefore got bit careful Mr Hancock also defended easing lockdown rules England Monday, saying government's strategy ""replace restrictions vaccination"" first line defence virus.

[Covid: Increasing confidence jabs work Indian identify fully vaccinated. Experts say they’ll lie. shit Sherlock, don’t need experts saying this.  shit-talking mostly stopped everyone realized tenfold vaccine supply almost country, lower case numbers per *n* population segmentation similarly populated countries. one ever left house, could REALLY cut spread!

There comes time take reasonable precautions, every possible precaution. allowed drive car, even though one dangerous things average person every day. take reasonable precaution installing airbags seatbelts. Interesting. Personal experience, 5 years dealing regularly late husband dealt cancer, I’d put 10% outstanding, 30% great, 40% reasonably competent, 20% either fucking useless fucking nuts.

With caveat one hospital system, maybe better job mostly filtering really bad ones? 70% elsewhere bad 20% encountered, holy fuck, that’s nightmare. multiple times would gladly smothered 20% sleep. Especially two particular, one crazy one useless. little vaccine card nothing special either. printed regular paper. anti maskers would know looks like. print one. would bother printing aside saying already vaccine. heard ""I need wear mask anymore"" hear comes 25th wave. definitely gas hoarding bags made give said fuck let's see happens. Given stores people time come plan instead info foisted us day. obvious get go sub gonna turn conspiracy nuts soon restrictions got lifted. clearly know CDC you! guidelines necessary? vaccinated, wear mask. unvaccinated abandon masks, put risk. 

Vaccines widely accessible free charge. 

CDC pretty clear. places kept medical settings public transportation time, possibly schools. wish area like that. news can.e CDC considering removing mask mandate vaccinated people, people area went, cDc SaYs dOnT WeAr MaSkS aNyMorE. reduce spread among adults, also reducing risk kids “Urges caution” “high degree confidence” sends mixed signals. Yep I've since announcement. Keep mask hand others want mask well. There's zero harm wearing mask, also time start getting back normal we're vaccinated. point nurses trying make mandatory nurses. union making priority. think that's fair point. death hospitalization relevant stats... age group without vaccine? Good, least right keep medical information private kept safe. Really least problems though Biden charge.  America, baby!!  like three weeks end December beginning January, became clear weren’t major vaccine evading mutants settled down.

A lot people never grasped fact. read link; good pleasing reading. understand, everything we've through, caution fear people variants. also think well researched, rational thinking like ""megacomment"" needs become prominent genuine cure said caution/fear. anywhere near 55 percent I'm happy it. Unfortunately us south, we're still low 30s hitting wall vaccine hesitancy, lifting required masks businesses puts quite lot people unnecessary risk. makes sense states close threshold, we're nowhere near yet.   government agency going tell wear mask. protect family community however hell want, try stop me. people still wearing masks though?   didn’t go stores last year? clearly said it’s anecdotal. Lots different meatheads wackos well. Reviewing even recent 5 comments illuminating hearing claim 'all pneumonias matter'.  ""Experts say they'll lie""

Biggest 'No Shit Sherlock' I've ever read.

Trump election vaccines real. go get trash bag gasoline light cig.... tire repair place guy working asked received vaccine, said yes—he asked going hurt became zombie. guy really convinced vaccine going turn everyone got zombies. Kinda weirded out. I'm hoping ICU staff trained/intelligent healthcare staff elderly care facility gf works. went kinds hoops obtain vaccines staff, less half willing take shot :( many could function made requirement, people working risk elderly. frustrating provided examples precautions taken every example risk provided...how unrelated? point take precautions seemingly small risks - help minimize risk. Even conditions, 7 year old unlikely develop anything minor symptoms covid statistically insignificant risk. parents could also keep places lot people months they're overly concerned. Really, rare children need places lot adults. Yep. One brothers said exempt wearing mask asthma. #1 - I've known whole life; never asthma. #2 - asthma make inclined wear mask (Having respiratory illness make inclined). #3 - actually asthma, wearing mask affect asthma ALL; wear mask every day never caused attack (I've actually fewer attacks since wearing mask). told put d*mn mask, get car. many excuses, little truth. really matters Americans get vaccinated. mask option vaccinated have. mask off? fine. Mask on? fine

what counts Americans get vaccinated.

get vaccine people please fast New mask rules trust Americans honest vaccine status. ~~Experts~~ Common sense say they'll lie.

I fixed   Exactly! pandemic time resume normal life. one glad enjoy Tom Collins friends family! don’t grieve anti vaxxers much trouble cause - 12s still can’t get vaccinated yet, deserve better! LOL like say, ""I know tell care others."" 


Hopefully never situation rely help others even inconvenient them. news around world, appears India past peak terms infections. However, deaths likely peaked yet sadly probably weeks now, least country may entering downward trend cases. also masking social distancing 

oh wait TIL I’m expert vaccines masks together helps always thought masking schools prevent children asymptomatic spreaders at-risk adults home. risk people vaccinated. 

I also think smart err side caution masks dial back new data becomes available. don’t think pointless rather smartest option data time. Taking shot dark guessing Seattle area? went downtown Seattle first time like 9 months yesterday, almost every single person still wearing mask *outside*. Obviously take businesses amount time stop requiring them, surprised see outdoors open air. nursing home decision best could make time, Murphy owned it, unlike Cuomo. totally sure areas high low risk. hell, took year us get conclusive data surface transmission low. second wave bounce back states jack shit, nearly bad others. top bear mind limitations US pretty strict laws kind thing here. suspended basic constitutional rights. allowed, narrowly, short time periods. despite Trump screwing royally, even adult oval office still likely would 100-200k dead. US ill equipped behavorially deal pandemics. robust healthcare system, arguably best logistics planet, that's reactive. proactiveness limited monitoring outbreaks premptively activated aforementioned logistics, former dismantled trump, later hamstringed him.

we simply society equipped prevent outbreak, frankly might never one. basically mitigate recover well. I'm expert, CDC already taken account lifted mask recommendations? You’d surprised many nurses don’t know anything vaccines science behind them. I’m lab person, expertise goes basic immunology. Nooope actually say ""masks helpful"" see others claim ""masks work?"" recall saying ""we need healthy people wearing masks."" huge percentage population incapable of, (as point out) afraid understanding science. IMO, need find way explaining (for example) vaccines good thing without needing use technical terminology. Continuing pound “if smarter you’d understand” narrative clearly working. Spoiler alert, we’re never getting herd immunity. Sadly, know them. But, fair, they've started lean far right ways well. Propaganda scary powerful. odds dying covid low. wearing mask sort death sentence. deadline works well elimination policy need motivator get people vaccinated.

But I’m even talking vaccine hesitant people here. I’m talking 1 month ensure USA gets 50% fully vaccinated. point, couldn’t care less vaccine hesitant antivaxxers.

The science shows people **fully vaccinated** risk transmit COVID-19. wouldn’t want additional **12%** USA population reach **fully vaccinated status**? Especially matter 1 month happen, since ~40 million people scheduled get 2nd dose within next weeks. would following science. **Please cease argument.** I'm going lie, actually trend really enjoy. Maybe love lists? too. Jumbo shrimp  I've asked people they're surprisingly upfront proud vaccinated. surprised abnormally honest it. We've 500k deaths U.S. COVID-19 even largest quarantine effort past century. think fair say COVID-19 flu two different levels danger. Sorry, trying relate unrelated thoughts discussion here. **Your reply useless harmful. Please cease.** feel like Fauci knows took consideration. really strong anymore. cares? that? nurses know don’t know Covid? Didn’t realize majority educated population shops Walmart. Oh wait don’t Walmart game town likely live rural America :) continue wear mask. trust issues well, anti-maskers Covid deniers consistently proved right past year. reason we're grey area people insisting there's issue grey area issue while. difficult transition society partially restricted almost restrictions people following restrictions unilaterally first place knew vaccine target spike protein. Maybe microchip Americans put checkpoints everywhere? solve problem.  sure needed expert tell won't. Anti-vaxxers proud loud choices. vaccine guarantee safety.

Where exist anywhere else society? absurd logic. really sure number is. feels like it’s still early dropping masks inside stores, it’s worth hassle looked anti masker something. 

Humans creatures habits, we’ve wearing masks 12 months it’ll take good behavior change. 7 yr old asthma &amp; Type 1 diabetes choice get vaccinated, could die idiots allowed go places masks now, plenty kids preexisting conditions. people take vaccine whatever reason able mount proper immune response protect themselves. need expert tell that, I'd think Hjadams123: understand trepidation. CDC's new recommendations corporate response them, well Florida's ""Let's Completely Open"" policies, confusing. 

Additionally, Florida DOH continuing policy sharing variant data forced local media outlets. creates even confusion. CDC adds producing limited data variant spread every 2 weeks. 

I watch CDC data. also pull media-obtained data. 

There really way tell go. 

What tell county Florida vaccinating 100 people per day. around 560,000 residents, yet we've vaccinated around 39% population. DOH vaccination sites moving onsite, appointment vaccination. However, local pharmacies opened walk-in vaccination. 

Whether vaccinate rest population contagious variants take hold anyone's guess. 

**Please engage useless arguments CDC Policy. Since zero control vaccinated mask wearing, point it.**

Thank you.  I'm imagining venn diagram people vote ""Obamacare"" anti-vaxx.... thinking circles overlap closely.  think tend overstate many people actually fake medical condition, fake vaccinated. majority people can’t/won’t deal kind confrontation, despite political opinion, don’t want publicly shamed others. psychopaths Twitter/Reddit say make fake vaccination cards accurate sample real people. Every single republican know (including *raging* republicans) zero problems masks, generally vaccinated.

This honor-system regulations generally work; yes people cheat system, people comply requirements avoid shamed public peers. might right. read, they’re official position pure science, strategy, worry knuckleheads world pick fight physically hurt someone situation escalates due wearing masks person got fully vaccinated always asshole doesn’t mind business regardless fully vaccinated someone always something say act violent. problem two sided war everyone fights one side other. caught middle tendency end like grape road, Miyagi style. Ooooh good show  in: water wet. 11.  relevant? know. vaccinated fine. ones refuse vaccine catch covid fluff choke death care. shut protect celebrity’s grandparents!! Well f*ck them. don’t know 65% adult population ever vaccinated. It’s basically walk shot point want it. I’m upset. I’m sad you’ve conditioned afraid even though top scientists area infectious disease say take masks you’re yet convinced. 

It means you’re driven science you’re driven fear.  Except every state followed CDC determination want make decisions. Private businesses - may want keep masks. think prefer masks don’t want look proof vaccination. studies show breastfeeding actually give anti bodies children. surprising that's 90% reason breastfeeding valuable. go get this, threw away year lives protect others, it’s time personal responsibility.  compromised immune systems. Vaccines blueprints immune system, magic force fields, work immune system works. Doctors report fully vaccinated people hospitalized covid, likely reason. also people allergic vaccine (rare, exist) can't get full regiment. Exactly.
We need take people’s questions come, provide answers questions haven’t asked.

Even questions frustratingly misinformed. 
They need answered respectful way, else push someone away truth.

We agree media landscape proven untrustworthy times, someone questioning legitimacy information coming media, need empathize provide information way address ultimately prevail fear.

We cannot get stuck disagreeing unrelated issues talking vaccine.

We need aware issue unrelated, provide empathy person bring issue, connect information strengthens argument safe get vaccine.

This may include validating belief someones distrust see experimental vaccine, suggesting one alternatives use traditional technology.

As time goes on, options become available people, know them, thus easier inform people they’re comfortable getting vaccine.

It’s always important remember we’re human, kinder other, better us. best wishes free democratic societies every where. overcome this. Remove caps. forgetting asymptomatic people.

I glad allowing make health decisions. mask, vaccine, covid. service animal, personally dislike word service role. ADA Psychological Service Animal whatever officiating documentation require. However, role service animal found help emotional support animal. I've fewer attacks less anxiety attribute companionship training. But, always there, ready able, snap episode even drag away street need be. people telling us ""I need wear mask, already got vaccine"" vaccine even made.

How think things would change? also read CDC’s announcement strategic decision rather something driven consensus public health

You're misunderstanding public health bit here. Public health exactly intersection scientific evidence strategic policymaking. science supports removing mask mandate vaccinated people, even face bad actors. wiggle room decision around assumptions make prevalence bad actors I'm sure modeled different scenarios different levels people lying abusing policy change. easy tell who's vaccinated area; we're ones still wearing masks. also fact people content first dose vaccine. Others flat get second immune response first shot don’t think they’re downvoting hurt anyone. think they’re downvoting way call entitled without type out.  all. know vaccines reduce ability get infected - prevent completely. very, very, well though keep developing anything minor symptoms reduce viral load much unlikely able transmit it.
 
A people testing positive vaccinated nothing concerned about. Already :) feel like everyone opportunity vaccinated. I'm vaccinated. assume decided against.

I get enough people vaccinated could reach herd immunity that's clearly going happen.

Honesty question. attacks. choose get vaccinated choose wear mask care? harm community? think timing matters too. We're heading summer spread lower anyways. Additionally risk 12 small, infinitesimal, really concern holding transition benefit ways (more normal school environments, etc) minimize already nearly non existstent risk. think timing matters too.

You’re claiming currently *no idea* deadly coronavirus is, whether masks work, - bafflingly - **if vaccines work** bias somewhere? vaccine studies double blind studies control group reviewed dozens countries. biased, we’d fucking know.

We know vaccines work. don’t wait 75 years. That’s CDC that’s we’re thread. 2.71M vaccinations compared last week's 2.37M. Includes 220k 12-15 year olds, group obviously making impact.

I've also gotten head colds hypothermia summer. long vaccines last meant... people blatantly ignore context make incoherent point could told people wear cloth mask, like later. Oh sure, 100% they’ll lie...because people shitty hate species think county 33 percent vaccinated. small handful co workers bothered. can't put words grateful vaccinated. local hospital small, hope surge. Publicfreakout subreddit Karens getting caught unvaccinated yes know fully vaccinated individual still spread/transmit, I'm ok small risk. 

So ok putting others risk saying ""Experts""

Anyone half brain cell knows damn good well dumb fucks already wear masks get vaccinated would lie. 
There’s way won’t end terribly. variants circumvent antibodies, although vaccine provides protection, there’s way smart idea. 

I’m starting doubt critical thinking department people government. Even nurses Union put statement asking rethink this. choose continue wearing mask. diabetes well controlled, shouldn’t matter much all. 

The immune system impeded conditions diabetes sets up, well managed diabetes allow conditions set up. bear mind removal mandate could potentially allow bans masks happen, many already laws. that's cracked anti-maskers yelling ""their freedom""

most never freedom wear mask stores. illegal wear mask many location, due security concerns. exceptionalism.People simply prefer save money important things mandatory quarantine.  last year taught us anything, roughly third Americans give rat's ass lying. completely fine it, long lies suit purpose help ""own"" people hate.  Damn, thought thing. I’m expert!!! mean, KNOW already. lot people caught making/distributing fake cards trying use them. shit ton kids still can't get vaccine. people genuinely disheartening news seems kind pointless. I'd surprised used it, knows. Still bad idea knowingly lie public undermine credibility Clearly brain. government cannot force people take drug undergo medical procedure, even it’s shot. job school require can’t mandatory entire population. sooner later people get virus probably die vaccinated , natural selection I'm gonna keep wearing mine worry people assume I'm vaccinated (even though am) probably stupid walk around holding vax card .. may immune think long think, vs. immunity acquire getting vaccine hope tells friend, CDC recommends **EVERYONE** get vaccine unless allergic it. It’s price. people getting fake cards getting won’t get vaccine regardless factor. mandates get shots want safe dude forcing to. I’m vaxxed chose get vaxxed health choice unless talking Ebola level pandemic endemic etc mandated vaccine would save humankind. news, today Sunday. Nah  They’ll probably fine due herd immunity claim right along hoax. Sadly fewer people think. mean CDC hasn’t built sterling reputation reliability past 14 months.

The issue vaccinated people choose wear mask, unvaccinated people need stay masked. supposed enforced? places said, screw rely individuals honest. places willing it’s easier everyone wear mask.

Examples life past weekend: elevator lobby building, public transit, gym, indoor pool, museum zoo, library, bank ATMs. require masks probably aren’t going check vaccination status. Question—-do think 1 month fewer daily cases? exact way thinking - move made ramp slowing vaccination rates. actually convinced vaccine hesitant coworker get shot this. get second shot next week don’t want confuse kids I’ll continue wear mine well! mask always fogs glasses, it’ll nicer wear masks help her, protect spreading covid. mortality rate children Covid-19 less death lightning strike. CDC policy focused science focused. example previous head CDC, Robert Redfield, [said AIDS epidemic ‘God’s judgment’ homosexuals believes spread United States 1980s due lack traditional family view likely doubt contributed active efforts limit spread covid early parts outbreak.

Trusting proclamations CDC uncritically bad idea. plan continue wearing masks since they're vaccinated? aren’t “all together”😂
It’s called survival fittest... buddy  don’t know better top health experts world. 

Top health experts often disagree substantial margins. wouldn’t say know better so-and-so health expert, it’s impossible take one expert’s opinion absolute truth. science CDC goes said 4 months ago stop wearing masks vaccinated. POTUS friends waited till push getting shit border crisis, terrible jobs reports. pushed finally (even though CDC pushed months ago) would look like good. don’t mind vaccine, wife nurse, mail she’ll vaccinate home :)  yet they’re still 10x trustworthy group nurses really matter. Anyone legitimately concerned take vaccine protected.

If dumbasses want fake it, they'll roll dice immunity gained natural infection.  I'll lie. Call selfish asshole. give shit anymore.  labor unions get involved third rail. Happens teachers unions Oh gosh, lost family Covid-19? I’m really sorry hear that. point care lie? want vaccinated US, be. don’t? Let risk it. 

I think point lockdowns precautions protect people prevent hospitals overwhelmed. 

We that. People want protected, vaccinated. Enough people vaccinated hospitals won’t overwhelmed. 

Game on. Time resume normal life. 

Send vaccine surplus nations need it. Make strengthen allies it. Oh dang personally heard one case reddit? Good thing they're still wearing masks. little doubt contain it. know system 100% leakproof.  Monday night report thelawyercraig twitter gonna fucking crazy probably significantly happen far, man pissed mutates stupid anti-masking anti-vaxxers caused keep spreading. need expert know Yes. catch covid I’m worried since ive vaccinated. Humans meant endure limited social interaction year. would bet issues started spike 2 months across age groups. literally came comments knew someone would get good roast Christ. world I'm going check tomorrow scoop!! Well last two days Taiwan. We'll see happens now. 10 percent positivity 200 daily cases  believing vaccine would make sicker virus cases deaths overblown.

... HOW?!?!?!? people look around see clearly hospitalizations falling like rock following vaccines, whereas rocketing following COVID?

Too many people mistake critical thinking overthinking things. Every one knows they'll lie. supposed admit know it. Naw, protected three roommates’ covid cases, don’t wanna mistaken republican. mask also protects others it’s really accessory cover double chin. public interest state mandating pregnancies, (which greatly detrimental health effects mothers also highly traumatic depending circumstances)

but public interest fully vaccinated public, infinitesimally small chance negative outcome vaccine.

You're trying compare two things even remotely similar. r/iamverybadass Part wants ask people kids flu shot every single year entire lives, they’ve never slacked forgot it. would probably start fights. children

Are statistically insignificant. amount below-18 people dying thing ridiculously tiny. Like 300 nationwide. Tragic, tiny immunocompromised, chemo patients

Those bigger issue, I've yet hear significant info them? I've seen maybe one Reddit comment guy can't get vaccine he's chemo that's it. many people *actually* condition?

And case, immunocompromised people wear N95s limit hang with.

I personally think lifting mask rules tad bit early it'd happen point. really HUGE difference two weeks now. It’s need move towards normalcy definitely going see happens huh? meantime cat bag much wrong hands.    Yea I'm pretty sure vaccine way better, good level immunity it.  Agreed. I'm trying point even disease milder vaccine, still people going die milder version. (immuno compromised people, people chronic condition delicate health).

I'm asking reserve bile people refused get vaccinated. They're entirely self-damaging group. Well, turnabout fair play government called ""experts"" lying us last year. ESA’s service animals need “registered.” online sites send certificate scam. Anyone knows shit ESA’s laugh face present one. documentation ESA needs letter physician/psychiatrist/psychologist stating individual need one. pay $100 “register” ESA you’ve conned deserve landlords/bosses/etc laugh now. here. Masks unless required to.

I want ruffle feathers businesses require masks. They're enough stress dealing idiots want get vaccinated looking fights.  hope live, kinda also suffer. Im probably bad person is. Maybe unpopular opinion here, finally. vaccines effective scientists say are, vast, vast majority adult population either a) vaccinated thus care, b) actively choosing unvaccinated thus chosen accept risk. tiny percentage people unable vaccinated high risk illnesses masking anyways seems. children starting eligible usually already attending public schools lower risk profile generally. I’m sure point Reddit would comfortable stores removing mask mandates, 50% adult population vaccinated, vaccines readily available adults. seems like it’s time start rewarding vaccinated people, even unvaccinated people take advantage new rules Ideally state require people get vaccinations diseases immunocompromised. research term ""barely legal"" applies, means try appear less vaccinated actually are. friend spelled nomola. you’re vaxxed don’t worry you’re vaxxed wear mask.... you’re immune comprised stay socially distant. many COVID-19 vaccines Oklahoma administered? 

 
In Oklahoma, 1,580,832 people 39% state received least one dose. 
Overall, 1,273,983 people 32% Oklahoma's population fully vaccinated. think things change around me, state never mask mandate. people wearing masks wearing masks non-vaccinated. doctor actually told that🤷🏼‍♀️ conclusion also important:

The surge India especially concerning. “That’s giving virus lot chances pull evolutionary slot-machine handle maybe come jackpot,” Friedrich says. vaccine rollout going well many rich countries, poorer countries may widespread access vaccines 2022 even later. “We amazing vaccines,” Chandran says. “We need figure way get everybody.” Yeah, let’s see following headline plays across anti-vax havens: MPs started collecting people force take COVID shot. say nation full people started January 6, yet without hint irony suggest gov something would lead another January 6th. guarantee half kids see walking around gym without mask arent vaccinated. Sadly works better smart people smart people already got   mean sure huge number, attitudes people thread basically ""you arent people like me, fuck you"". Maybe small percentage (definitely 1% low though), still people screwing waiting bit longer. anywhere near herd immunity yet. thing, mean can't get spread it. past vaccine thing. Experts say water surprisingly wet already lot breakthrough infections reported.

""A lot""? really. consider sheer scale things. reality is, fully vaccinated far higher chance getting car accident way store contracting breakthrough case COVID.  95 million fully vaccinated Americans, less 0.001% got breakthrough infections, CDC reported end anti vaxxers get covid die, human gene pool suffer all. went Trader Joe's yesterday (in state ending mask mandate Weds, still required now) noticeably emptier. I'm complaining. r/nottheonion Tier Hi, I’m Experts. well undercounting COVID deaths USA 50 percent.  landlord idiot then. certificates don’t mean jack shit make pet ESA. need letter doctor. hope next place go smarter scamming system hurts us actual need ESA. states say allow them, though. I'm sure law fall seems like could ""state's right"" issue. Everyone says: lie. suddenly CDC scientists reliable? understand people want wear masks makes feel secure, step reality point. People always lie. goes country. Copying comment left elsewhere thread.

Thanks. appreciate that.

To clear, biggest worry kids getting covid getting seriously ill dying. know overall risk low, lose sleep that. 

My worry long term effects (sequelae) known yet known right children. [SARS-CoV-2 readily infects spreads brain see acute impacts loss sense smell, headaches, ""brain fog"", etc. Influenza infect spread brain tissue like SARS-CoV-2 does. Infection - mild serious - also significantly linked (though causation established) host psychological neurological outcomes 6 months post infection Things like depression, anxiety, mood disorders. way study conducted essentially abstracts away social effects (like lockdown) patterns saw likely biological nature. There's fire, lot smoke. Putting things together fact children's brains growing environmental factors negatively impact (see: leaded gasoline pollution impact childrens' executive function), leery exposing children that. Especially since knowledge tools something it. Ideally would state would coerce people get vaccine immunocompromised, wear masks threat unvaccinated people actually negligible unlikely. Children going die relaxing mask mandates. head CDC Dr. Wallensky gave interview one Sunday talk shows, said agency (and Biden administration) decided appropriate country transition public health mandates private health guidance. specifically said public start take responsibility health &amp; safety themselves. 

I think they're frustrated certain factions refusing get vaccinated political social reasons. So, Dr. Wallensky bluntly stated they're own: fate health lies hands. get hospitalized fault. tone pretty strident, considering coming liberal progressive administration.   comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   think they'd sometimes, actually want go somewhere they'll shut *affected

and get fucking vaccine  Cannot agree incubation week year, too. could get little scratch stray cat year later start get sick oops late. Dan Cortez coronavirus subreddit seem understand masks work risk factors, 50% viral load infection vector means. Ok good luck Think judged antivax wearing mask people idea required wear vaccinated 

I feel matter what, mask not, gonna judged ignorant people   Fortunately, nearly every person willing without contraindication already chance (for MONTHS) get vaccinated free. Furthermore, feel like return normalcy would result hospitalizations car wrecks activity-related traumas actual severe COVID cases, wouldn’t worry much hospitals overrun again.

Although it’s certainly still *possible* (albeit far less likely) get severe COVID despite vaccination, almost get likely either anti-vax or, tragically, contraindicated vaccines. 

If you’re anti-vax type ends hospitalized severe COVID, shouldn’t *probably* won’t receive lower standard care, don’t surprised there’s lack empathy among healthcare staff. really, reallllly appreciate everyone getting vaccinated. It’s tough year. know death flying extremely low also know wearing helmet helps reduce chances even lower wear helmet flying. also enable help others crash helmet

Please post % [Risk death covid cdc Sigh. One family common-for-him virus (he's got preschooler) tests widely available, two months later got antibody testing negative, he's insisting ever since knows therefore needs masks, precautions, vaccines. He's also vocal anybody strong vaccine reaction definitely already covid probably asymptomatic (did know herd immunity last May?). course, anybody strong reaction proof dangerous vaccines are. figure hope there's something wants requires vaccination first! CDC said things start spike change, roll recommendation back. 

I think that's going easy roll back. point, horse barn galloping across field hope turning back. reasonably abundant.

That said, would never forgive him. No, issue difference what's best overall terms public health, what's better individual. 

Those necessarily thing.  Arrived Vegas moment mask mandate lifted vaccinated. Suddenly almost noone mask anymore age. It’s terrifyingly obvious anti maskers/antivaxxers force fair, mRNA vaccines new technologies long term observation studies beyond first doses healthcare professionals, now. flu vaccine methodology mostly old technology, tried proven many decades.

I personally weak immune system waiting data/studies efficacy immunocompromised.   think Tomorrow day lot businesses make decision masks, many companies want make announcement weekend presume, places like CVS, Walgreens, Best Buy, Macy’s, Levi Strauss, Gap, Target evaluating guidelines still probably make decision coming days. expect people live far outside reality tell truth? explicit, people telling untruths. article links several studies involved CDC decision: Duh Sh$t department...   ... faith vaccine actually protect you? FUCKING SHIT Make 40005, Citizen! anybody wants instead targeting specific groups people effected most.

I believe that's first vaccines offered 60+ high risk, things went along, got lowered individual areas. places kids 12-15 get vaccine well!    go choice vaccinated voted for?... haven’t flu shot years. I’m never gonna get covid vaccine. voted Biden. sound like genuine idiot. I’m seeing folks mad people still masking instead mad folks refusing vaccine. Makes sense. complete misinformation place subreddit like this.  


This article highlights research led decision:  Aannnddd decided attend conventions year. say? Humans lie? no, never! /S I’m pregnant vaccinated I’ll probably still wear mask public places bc people lying. Also, think “hoax” science behind CDC saying people go without masks they’re fully vaccinated. But…. People vaccinated so… don’t see doesn’t make sense lol. realize literally gave people needed first right?

Healthcare workers, elderly, front line workers, got general population

But course don’t realize that, you’re self proclaimed moron lie vaccinated Hey report back results? I'm QUITE interested goes workplace.   understand. can't US introduce digital vaccine pass like countries? makes easier travel, visit places, etc. people form mobile phone. ...si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses. many manufacturing sites AstraZeneca US Emergent's Baltimore plant offline given J&amp;J?

Lol moron zero faith vaccine protect them. got everyone else did, feel like everyone forced to. guess going look 3-4 weeks chart shows roughly half people got first dose gotten second. Im sure safe assume get second one. hope. plan lying. plan ever getting vaccine. wearing mask. think people going lie, wrong. People going Fcking tell face. wearing mask. what? TIL Virus got first detected can't called origin call UK Variant instead 'british' variant varient mutates 3rd time called 'indian' variant! subjective racism it? would people loophole around mask mandate anyway lie vaccine status? anyone give clue?   week duh: Duh.

You work retail see first hand despicable, brazen, careless population is. One, actual people can’t get vaccine. also happen likely vulnerable Covid. Two, everyone, year traumatized, feels vaccinated enough feel safe non-mask wearing non-vaccinated people around that’s perfectly reasonable state mind, especially we’re nowhere near herd immunity vaccine-resistant variants could come time. COVID shown us comes assholes hide they've bitten zombie movies, least 1/3 population would lying bitten even visible wounds process turning undead cannibal meant getting go bar get hair cut.  70 million plus bunch deplorables American culture seems love liars crooks clear message headlines mask lift also subject establishment city rules. I’ve already seen fights businesses LA wearing masks scream, “I’m vaccinated!” throw fit.  Nah That's requiring card mandatory. way move forward. No, CDC NEVER said “lift mask restrictions” said “vaccinated people need wear masks.” never point time said unvaccinated people take masks off, there’s 0 logistical way enforce “vaccinated don’t need masks” policy lead masks going away everybody. Hell, states getting rid mask mandates entirely, 100% CDC recommended.

It’s funny year ago people bitching CDC doesn’t take account businesses need money survive coming policy people acting like CDC took account possibility unvaccinated people stop wearing masks too. That’s do, talk science that’s it. science says vaccinated people don’t need masks, it’s everyone else’s job figure police it. since can’t, getting rid would cause us go path CDC want, since never said unvaccinated people don’t need masks. Vax, political libertarian reasons

Add religious reasons. Plenty religious leaders (or con people like Christiane Northrup using religious imagery) milking pandemic strengthen congregations framing vaccines terms persecution.  science, would tied vaccination community spread rates/number cases. It’s amazing woke people went “don’t tell body!!!” “mandate vaccine make illegal receive it” Pay people. Offer money get jab. coax another 10% rocks. take new guidelines this:

If vaccinated - sub I'm assuming - forget anti-vax people. They're risking health, yours. interact risk getting covid fully vaccinating.

If choose vax - fuck em. loss. 

Now significant portion population least partially vaccinated - group risk anti-vax people concern - punish stupidity.

If anti-vax folk want pretend they've vaccinated - fuck em. get sick them, us. least planing helping stranded Australians? make sure *others* don’t look inane dangerous opinion think basis reality. Y’know, start jab hand throw real punch dominant hand move block jab. test outdated, specific tests disproven effective regular masks protecting wearer.

Covid particles .1microns, yet showed results particle sizes 3 times larger. bad study disingenuous use evidence. got 'rona already, they'll fine. among them, also claiming workers back office now. correct, emergency approval granted Phase 3 trial conducted, since Phase 3 trials conducted results released. Unvaccinated spreading amongst unvaccinated. Go ahead let them. I’m vaccinated likelihood impacting like cold 99.99999999 percent . That’s point vaccines Also scientist, thinking well. vaccines cause covid vaporized instant touches body. body still needs mount immune response fight virus, takes least little time. wonder yankees players tested next day instead day did, would even tested positive? lie. get vaccine, wear mask either lol. simple.  Cry anything like place work maybe 5% people without vaccine still wear mask. 2 people 30-40 people wearing mask. probably less 40% vaccinated. Get vaccine hide house. Hi, helps, I'd recommend coworker read One 6 people quoted piece expert communicable diseases. Epidemiology big field people definitely knowledge average person long shot, aren’t particularly authoritative.   fair... there’s barely enough time fully vaccinated since opened eligibility everyone. busy schedule trouble finding appointment, might yet. would pissed wasn’t fully vaccinated suddenly deal customers w/o mask zero warning.  want transmission virus end - amongst everyone. Children vaccinated. Think social dynamics. tell children need mask watch adults masking?  say do?  Set example. Wear mask public places.  little data vaccine effectiveness yet. evidence exist thus far indicates reduced effectiveness e.g. B.1.1.7, predominant variant US. looking much less effective preventing mild disease, also implications transmission effectiveness black white. Keep eroding vitro antibody neutralization, eventually they're going help whole lot anymore. Maybe still reduce hospitalizations vs otherwise severe disease going increasingly break exactly finished viral evolution yet. lol yeah, person probably saying ""follow science people"" like two weeks ago. Businesses could still ask proof vaccination. run business sign door says don’t wear mask you’ve fully vaccinated asked provide proof vaccination.  Americans honest…hmm…I’m sure it’ll fine! trust science brah.  would qualify probability high enough CDC warns good chance.  people still continue wear masks actually vaccinated, functioning brains. fear still wearing mask confused republican anti vaxxer. Cars really dangerous, risk closer getting killed lightning strike. Went first full capacity sporting event since January 2020 (been several since full capacity) even though [people like freak end time, amazing see everyone there, worry vaccinated, scenes.

I’m public event right now, almost everyone still masked. class morning 50/50, know everyone unmasked fully vaccinated already. data work changed lot start this. Let’s real; country, didn’t really lock down. GameStop Jo-Ann Fabrics saying “essential businesses,” giving employees letters saying so. places really shut offices probably pretty low transmission risk comparatively anyway, jobs done home. That’s us. That’s two weeks didn’t work.

Mine didn’t either majority businesses followed CDC guidelines, vaccinated, low risk take kids around places everybody masked.

Businesses around changing policies following CDC, vaccinated adults/teens unmasked, problem don’t require vaccination proof. families members can’t get vaccine left devices. virus still around elementary age kids area. would stupid shielding kids let fully exposed. politicians lie neither we. representation American society whole. nurses. 570,000 dead Americans year. “Experts” say they’ll lie? Experts. Ahahaha. like everyone knows they’ll lie. Probably experts slowed us getting masks people ""people would touch selves much. So, anti science knuckle dragger. least know kind person talking dumb conversation.

Here, one adequate brain No, new mask rules put trust people honest status. new mask rules put onus unvaccinated, unvaccinated terrified. immune compromised high alert regardless “rules” (read suggestions) say masking. Unvaccinated children less blip radar respect chances poor clinical outcomes COVID19.


What new suggestions CDC provide impetus vaccine hesitant people get vaccinated. Here's one: though link journal article: absolutely agree that's hard sell individualism US tends bleed even left side spectrum accounts basically everyone. Thank you. truly shocked read news knowing live area 7/10 adults vaccinated, children aren’t vaccinated, we’ve got kids attending school person.

What expected CDC guideline, i.e. X% vaccination rate adults children 12+ community case rate less Y, safe remove masking requirements. still like 30000 flu deaths, mitigation partially affective, whos say affected amount travel. Sounds like mandatory vaccinations; gross, stop supporting police states.  neighbor said October 2019, travel anywhere. reason wearing mask 2020. absolutely lie  mean entire internet? buy masks anywhere. took word it. 😬Why jump rabbit hole?🙄🤣  Perhaps getting diseases regularly kept contracting worse version diseases.  Fair enough. know, article goes talk importance herd immunity. really see mask much inconvenience anyone. maybe worry since I'm vaccinated, that's going change mental state. human mind weird. Yes. spent 15 years working studies worked ran everyone ever dealt CDC I'd say generally touch actually implementing public health practice, terrible messaging, ivory tower. science makes clear people hear kinds messages CDC apply apply. CDC used info point people course going lie vaccination status, we're halfway herd immunity (with way reach given data vaccination relucatance, missing 2nd doses, kids unable all), mask mandates important ever maintain area herd immunity achieved. goal get abandonment mask use, end mandates, thousands unnecessary deaths, I'd say achieved goal. spent 3 decades actually communicating health information huge range populations, say pretty confidentially nobody kind experience would put announcement irresponsibly.  Medical personel buy masks walmart... CDC lied prevent mass hysteria. We're wearing outside anymore either we're 3 weeks second doses. took walk, sat park, snacks, enjoyed last cool spring weather summer kicks up. nice sweat mask avoid people quite much. 

We've also going grocery stores avoiding small, crowded, self checkout, like Trader Joe's. Masks on, course. Feels good, man. Feels really good go grocery shopping, sad sounds. stay away experts?  logic behind though, essentially medical theater. Holy strawman batman. arguing force people vaccinated, matters people whether vaccinated not. clue turned federal government could override Florida's ban. might case interstate international travel. Since obviously going affect Florida, states could sue Florida ban.

Also really doubt Florida's ban hold court.   Wait, what? authored comment response someone else thread thought content germane discussion (about risks.) words comment words. authored it. understand ""what heard elsewhere"" came from? Unless mean primary scientific literature cited? terribly confused.  someone could confirm Indian variant closer British variant greens virulent harder vaccines like SA P1 variants use charge people murder that. stopped made people get tested. Bro don’t run cycle wearing mask it’s silly useless understand getting water thing. Oh come on. It’s anti-vaxxer see time time CDC wrong. 

I fully vaccinated. doesn’t mean want unvaccinated spreading cases other. like living case count positivity rate low. every business going use honor system. Maybe see that’s issue? reason (and many) fuck-you selfish, ignorant Covidiots. wanted vaccinate - vaccinated, wearing mask joke anti-vaxxers. right choose get virus, die case be. Natural selection. in, experts declare something obvious Dude, sounds like bunch rational people. state that? big ‘no shit’ energy Theoretically possible ""a good chance"". answer nothing. accept risk could easily get covid (with mostly everyone unmasked month two) people got vaccinated accept risk potential long-term side effects shot might known yet.

Each person made decision plays them. expect much sympathy (not personally, people take vaccine could) though six months later road catch bad effects everyone got vaccine say told so. Yes trying reduce risk infection serious disease equivalent completely sheltering kids aspects life /s. 

Would mindset parents teach kids drugs? drink drive? 

Stop trying convince person good parent. They’re protect kids. Fuuuck that.... Respectfully course. feel like anti masker lol REFUSE wear unless get asked happened. part. wore mask go got vaccinated soon could. FUCKING DONE this. So.. logic, shut economy let millions spiral depression every winter flu huh Keep mask on… still don’t get everyone’s issue shit Sherlock bandage come off, don’t see needs “ripped” off. cost caution here? least giving year olds chance vaccinate would wise IMO.  antivax type easy pick out. I’ll keep mask close wear around Yes, see videos arguing store security germ theory fake need wear mask  Breaking news!! Water wet! don’t understand don’t implement vaccine passport data base shows proof fully vaccinated. People easily lie forge vaccine cards. wish could way easily pull documentation sure. don’t care happens anti vaxxers around me, care children immune compromised can’t get shot. honesty system going backfire. meant I’ll lol look applications list.

Meanwhile, where's link device small enough fit needle? Finding random example thin substrate proves nothing. [Lasting immunity found recovery True. national union “society” isn’t blasting CDC updating mask guidelines. comment directed idea national union group people majority, last reported, refusing vaccine. speaks credibility union people represents. like anybody point, they’re worried COVID, get vaccine.

No research says can’t fall sick even wearing mask. avoid falling sick getting vaccine, it.

Oh, research absolutely says vaccine effective reducing infection rates nearly 100% effective producing fatalities. Cloth can’t same. vaccinated.

Some us kids age 12 sadly can't get vaccine yet. 

Hopefully 12 vaccinated. think anyone uses fake certificate infects another person charged serious crime. like shooting bullets air hoping kill someone randomly lands.   That's pretty pessimistic. Taiwanese people reflexive though.

Nothing changed unvaccinated

the vaccinated protected transmit infection even vaccine-educated immune system. free wear mask not.the unvaccinated vulnerable COVID-19 get vaccinated soon possible eligible wear mask, safe distance, wash hands then. Nothing changed.

what's changed 3 vaccines US work like magic.

get vaccinated people, please fast can

kids 12 get vaccine today. 5 11 get vaccine end summer.

until use precautions used 14 months. ahh yes, solid 100 people represent half America. could won’t. 1. aren’t 99.99% effective, that’s looking data correctly. Pfizer moderna 95% effective J&amp;J 75% effective meaning 1 4 got J&amp;J vaccine still get sick.

2. There’s difference infected covid catching disease. shot run someone sick covid definition infected, someone infected spread virus others, even though may get sick (ie display signs disease). SHIT.

I'm going stuck wearing god damn mask face rest life want mistaken one shitbags.

I'd rather someone think ""Why still wearing mask?"" someone think ""I bet he's antivaxxer."" Can’t believe it. got covid. feel pretty fine; I’m day 3 symptoms, anyone got tips make go smoothly possible? antibody test could used. personal guess US trial data strong free side effects they're delaying position universal booster regardless shot people got before. guess longer random asshole internet, considered Expert. That's community health works. state still fire hospitals starting less full. Here's hoping backfire. I'd personally love ICU space things covid. study delaying second dose, data first dose, second. went 13%-39% 2 weeks first dose 95% showing antibodies getting second dose cancer patients (compared 100% control covid immunocompromised people cautious Good thing stupid proud stupid. data shows that's extremely unlikely. thx award! lol non vaccinated person I'll okay keeping mask long necessary. kinda used now... Like security blanket *really* hope start seeing hundreds people going prison this. inaccurate. everyone unvaccinated get infected. mean people done nothing safeguard others extremely lucky. would accurate say ""will probably get infected"". I’m fully vaccinated fully trust science (and kinda afraid seeming like don’t)… I’m sure trust strangers around me. mind unless cost careful outweigh risk it’s worth careful. costs *literally nothing* wear mask I’ll keep whether it’s required not. feel like straw man argument. Nurses aren’t scientists, let alone infectious disease experts. say regarding masks holds water me. I’ll listen guidance fact backed opinion pieces infectious disease public health experts. Nurses, er no. Exactly line thinking. Also, South African variant breaks vaccines easier, heavily vaccinated places Israel seeing increase variants population. Vaccinated people getting infected transmitting virus rare. think insurance companies going take hit trillions dollars ICU stays? premiums going up, worries.  Truth. Southern Maine vibrant relatively young, except isolated pockets rest state really old decaying. see abandoned houses time, example, rotting away. keep hearing seen anything saying take vaccine. group people must extremely tiny, maybe thousand. danger every virus. Early pandemic, wear mask job get harassed, co workers got threatened offering masks. people combative.

Retail workers given rough time pandemic. news posts reddit back day. anti maskers whole new level.   Ya “scientists” asking cautious mask up. shall trust it. 
No research says can’t fall sick even vaccinated. avoid falling sick wasting days miserable wearing stupid mask that. Anyone intelligent thought head knows better trust people things. Good news, liars easy spot gets easier day. fucking shitlords lie disabilities use special parking spots, course going lie vaccination Wow that’s amazing insight right there. could guessed people would lie? 🙄 get paid one experts? got exact feeling dec 2019.... everyone office caught it, said worst they’ve ever felt included. Literally thought going die , kept thinking dramatic felt never get sick. rock loser. make clear? believe (please check lawyer) animal behaving right ask leave regardless ADA. Later, fatass: ""You've become thing swore destroy!"" Considering half Americans vaccinated better see half people wearing masks else I’m calling police they’re idiotic enough spread people can’t get vaccinated yet like kids. may vaccinated still get die it. vaccine effective anyone worried virus get it. believe science brah. years increased screen time seen children losing ability read facial reactions interpret them. 

Sorry sounds like hot nonsense. Children see families unmasked time. Even screens, people unmasked. OMG watched people driving? passed law state, useless law passed, ever. Nobody cares, even police.  link:
 
But reiterated evidence far increased severity illness particular mutation coronavirus evades vaccine. Ah realize post, worthless subreddit. comment much higher shit lmao Taiwan following Japan's ""don't test, cases"" approach since last year. COVID test cost $150 administered match symptoms COVID-19. 

Unfortunately time can't tug everything carpet anymore. Fewer, since number fully vaccinated people increase next month. already know polling soon hit plateau terms willing get vaccinated. 1 month 12% population get fully vaccinated effectively mean unvaccinated demographic WILLING get vaccinated would towards kids whose age groups don’t emergency authorization for.

I think 1 month trade unbelievably reasonable, follows science, gives people collective goal work towards, importantly, reduces transmission risk mutation risk most. Still par lightning strike. keep kids home raining outside? (SC, USA) venting, got scolded bar last night neglecting put mask walked towards door smoke.

It honestly really putting. wore mask since told wear got vaccinated ASAP March. Got rapid tested almost weekly year.

I feel like dick think I’m going make personal choice stop visiting establishments ignore new guidance. 

Really made feel like piece shit. Like I’m sitting bar mask hours, I’m going give covid walking 15 feet door point need scold regular customer? Even showed vaccine card. never variants, especially India growth mainly caused loosened restrictions mass events I've covid, fully vaxed now, early 30's perfect health. state lifted lockdown too. I'm still ganna wear 1. Why? protect others possibly save life. 1 childs life save ends curing cancer aids. 

And, dont wanna deal peoples bullshit. wanna blend noticed Nah sound like college professor  friend breastfeeding, hesitant get vaccine. Yesterday, announcement made, booked first appointment. Hopefully many people that. kids getting screwed? ride school dangerous covid 19 them.  here. son vaccinated lot worry cease. Til I'm coronavirus expert there's carrot. yet anyone explain way makes sense. mask mandate dropped. there's infrastructure verifying vaccinations. everyone goes without mask life returns normal. scenario impetus hesitant people get shot? care either way. know someone unvaccinated went Disney world unmasked yesterday Covid less 2 weeks ago. Don’t trust anyone. shit. Good enough though. It’s over. going get like week ago wasn’t eligible I’ll get second dose 2 weeks even that. people refused mask public care others, least comes COVID, know problem lying vaccine.   weeks, kindness fellow humans?  Masking really makes elderly less afraid come back world, makes undergoing chemotherapy mask stand like lone ranger. Wearing mask sets good less confusing example children (who still need one). 

Masking public show caring public. think consistently made poor decisions made pandemic worse. late understand importance masks. vaccine pause nightmare. 

Masks become part life. people think eachother idiots regardless mask not... sounds like normalcy returned. People choose get vaccine, (at point) get infected. vaccine fully FDA approved, available anyone wants it, people want responsible cost care. (Some people cannot vaccinated, due medical reasons. people continue covered, course.)

It's lot cheaper get vaccine ($0.00) spend couple weeks hospital.  Vaccine even lot cheaper single office visit. clearly not. were, would different guidance based local transmission levels.  would statistics science right? I'm sure matters though. point wanted vaccine got it. didn't. it. I'm safe. care people decide. I’m worried about. thought amusing story share Reddit. Survival fittest tho lol   expound, say same. People lie.  yes don’t want incubating variants putting immunocompromised people children risk based blog research. get you’re saying; there’s lot messy data. there’s _much_ data able get meaningful results filtering messy parts. We’d still many thousands cases know about, meet criteria, study. goal immunity COVID (no matter get there, vaccines otherwise), somebody ought staying late work figure put number this. could help us better quantify risk even face vaccine hesitancy. know you’re lying though? vaccine give lifetime immunity. expect people need booster year up. Ooof. sucks it! Lol Hmm... right understand denying amount corpse died COVID-19 ? strange think normally find bodies rivers... especially hundreds per day.  lie eventually get virus. hope many die bring home vulnerable love ones die. called Darwinism. normal world (actually pretty much every administration pre trump) CDC authority matters like this. lot smart medical professionals. However publicly contradicted boss, day day out, yeah there’s going confusion. Doesn’t take away fact CDC prestigious disease prevention organization planet, question.

Also, going make mistakes. Many health organizations around world dropped ball pandemic. Doesn’t mean aren’t qualified. I'm guessing people definitely lie taken vaccine.

Source: turned minor health issues good enough excuse never waste time wearing mask I'll always claim take vaccine even never take it.

I might take someday right know long term effects I'll pass now. exquisite, lie like rug. seen anything that's good. still done trials pregnant/breastfeeding women vaccine though afaik. Planet Fitness dropped mandate, care? That's go can't wait wear mask there. go get vaccinated. export, import. People lie.  That’s I’m curious… expect? different % vaccinated unmasking, lockdowns, never unmasking, … what? retail job. assholes never wore mask walking saying vaccinated decent poeple vaccinated still wear post door still supposed to. 'have infected' got first dose yesterday. dad also infected positive long-term antibodies, getting vaccine. I've already said children statistically insignificant. COVID cases already pretty low compared early peaks, hospitals overloaded, first dose offers significant protection itself; surprised get zero deaths children Ohio entering vaccinated lottery. I’m guessing types incentive governments give out; rewards vaccinated open everyone rather specifically targeting holdouts. could wrong, whatever get people vaccinated I’m almost certainly it. **I say divide nation. real, let's it. original non-vaccinated Government vaccinated. Two separate nations people. really like it!** vaccinated proceed there's coronavirus, long violating state local laws/executive orders rules private property. Oooh really needed link regarding whole ""no side effects year thing"" people say 2 YeArS nOW"" cares! Really?? antivaxers getting antivaxers sick..... sounds like natural selection Well smart people decided risk mutations immune vaccine extremely unlikely. would suggest get paper together publish it. mutants higher R0, require people immune provide herd immunity.

To illustrate: measles R0 20, thus require 95% vaccination immunity rate provice herd immunity. Anti-vaxxers driven down, here, ±92%, we're getting epidemics, especially bible belt. last 2013-2014. Thousands kids got ill, 185 ended hospital (and likely suffered brain damage) 1 kid died, first fatality 30 years. country (not USA), pondered remove mask,but yet still 70% population vaccine , remove restritions us farce 14 months now...and never going get 70%...

If want stay masked bomb shelter, one stopping you...

The rest us suffered 14 months...why make us wait longer you’re afraid? Nevermind fact CDC vaccine card laughably easy fabricate. !remindme 24 hours  Would sensible thing attach metrics guide state local policies. guess much ask, even though would effective way carrot people vaccinated, likely actual goal this. genuinely fear damage done guidance feel anxiety felt months. Sad. don’t care either way. stay away you’re idiots…  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Sure, they'd probably want revamp hiring process somehow they're managing hire majority people end anti-vaxxers.  It’s hard determine exact numbers natural immunity. There’s going number recovered individuals also vaccinated, don’t want count twice, don’t really know exact case counts, everyone got test exactly right time, etc. vaccination numbers easier reliably count, natural immunity nebulous. 

But *there.* contribute herd immunity, don’t exactly know much is. It’s never simple. It’s hard enough verify people’s employment status required law. brains, comrade kinda compounds point. disappointing people opposed science modern medicine Yeah, I'm sure they're allowed share not.

I asked ID, know lot people update quickly (especially move city city state, especially pandemic DMVs issue)

I also know someone got vaccinated state. Afraid turned down, gave another person's address..  CDC cancel right wear mask? double mask...or go buy better mask?  privacy? cellphone on, FB Google tracking every step. know retailers eateries step hour hour.

And consider many sporting/entertainment event venues Clear Bag policy, go metal detector! that's invasion privacy.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm spreading information all, voicing concerns potential outcomes. invest energy stopping anti vaxxers spreading conspiracies misinformation. that's much detrimental humanity someone like bit overly cautious weary ramifications vaccinated crowds unvaccinated, unmasked people?

I’ve observed stay home order fully vaccinated, still wear mask? still contribute reducing spread indoor areas? “Emotional difficulties usually peak children around age two decline steeply primary school years”

🤣🤣🤣 Someone hasn’t 3 4 year old...  people? CDC recommends everyone isn't' allergic vaccine get it. vulnerable people first line get vaccine. problem mentality increases chances non vaccinated hosts virus mutate...possibly something can’t stopped current vaccines. we’ll mess again.

It’s “both sides equally bad” argument.  Guarantee lot states gonna require proof vaccination. Though Florida I'm sure liars present understand point come now. US fewer people vaccinated England much higher case numbers, yet they're still month bit away fully reopening even going measures place. US basically putting end everything now. many years schooling take come conclusion shit?  fairness...a lot us thought absurd 99% sacrifice mandatory restrictions 1% could voluntarily taken well vaccines available...so “I got mine” really isn’t relevant... Natural selection? care them. hear one time. counter argument: walked around Strep Throat 5 days without knowing it. symptom fatigue; felt unusually sleepy day. fever, pain, sore throat. infected least 4 people. One almost died. Even though know contagious (or even sick), still feel guilty making people sick. suffered I'll effects bacteria (other fight urge take nap work), man almost died unknowingly infectious. feel guilty rest life. Covid might make people sick (or all), might kill others. That's get tested. got first argument maskless guy indoors yesterday. 

He’s quoting CDC guidelines though hasn’t actively ignoring CDC last 14 months. 

My best argument - applicable - completely flummoxes mask resentful types say “sorry, bro, private property, house rules says need mask” said would reduce viral replication rates 3 4 orders magnitude. say potent enough use therapeutic drug. would expected reducing replication amount would give immune system time produce anti-bodies.  missing? please put plastic blow brains out.  still measles outbreaks. Look Disneyland years ago. Herd immunity good stable herd. matter company doesn’t want outbreak. That’s CDC specified vaccinated people remove masks. It’s fucking show dog, dude. fucking papers. might care someone love close can't get vaccinated yet made vulnerable assholes. might even care people like even know personally, general sense care concern basic welfare others. tell body  sound seems currently need either provide proof vaccination negative COVID test, that's pandemic going on.

The ""vaccine passports required go anywhere forever"" fear-mongering thankfully going happen. seems like place pandemic time really want travel want get vaccinated, negative COVID test option. Fluids sleep, like pretty much illness won’t lie. It’s none fuckin business. masks me. I'll honest you. I'll laugh ass gets infected enjoy every second it. timescale of, say, 3 - 5 years, think place earth Covid endemic? destined become one seasonal cold strains. funny way makes feel guilty laughing know true  I’m pretty sure nasty adenovirus around time too. got absolutely dog sick year something tested flu negative. Doctor guessed probably adenovirus, seems likely Covid, almost certainly yet. see issue lying. vaccinated rest easy. people going maskless regardless. already vaccine high efficacy, even mutations issue coming years. Let take risk that's want. free country. Nothing stopping getting vaccine. come around. Atm bunch immature children think power wills. stop people know get sick see one trying force get one. significant number people United States would severely disagree statement

I understand, confused skeptical response first learned situation disease response made sense me, believe charge probably would made decision. 

When there's uncertainty domain virology better err side caution enough potentially catastrophic results. underestimate virus open pandora's box lose agency point onward many vectors infection contain. initial evidence China indicated infection fatality rate ~3.5x turned globally (~1%) well extremely high *r* value (how many people infected person likely infect.) high *r*, even diseases low IFR extremely deadly.

I wish we'd honest public debate acceptable risk rather way things played out. want know deadly disease needs advance we're going lock next time. valuable human life? much quarantine cost? *r* *IFR* ranges automatic quarantine? may easy questions answer politically believe whatever response pandemic next time, needs unified hopefully evidence-based.

If responded way disease like Ebola we'd fucked. feel like failed national fire drill diseases. take precautions necessary meantime. Fully vaccinated free operate normally.

If 15 days first shot mRNA vaccine, least take solace fact immunity substantial. got this. 

But no, rest us obligated suffer 'because reasons'. It’s kind thankless “job” definitely gets annoying. Bashing head closed minded person’s fact-less opinions feels hopeless, challenging exposes closed-minded others happen reading. Lol experts needed know this.

I’m vaxxed. I’m simply...done. 

Anti vaxxers acquire COVID-19 within next year won’t wear masks. die.

It longer problem. It’s now. state offer priority grocery store workers, waitstaff, many groups. heathcare workers teachers got priority. 29 year old waitress 23 year old store clerk literally could even make appointment april 19, said appointment dates MAY. understand states passing vaccines like candy mid march boat. Yes right transport state could make appointment week, case weeks ago.

To reiterate, saying ""everyone ample time get it"" overgeneralization undermines situation literally millions Americans ""half vaxed"" right now.  CDC confirms new guidance issued accounting fact everyone would vaccinate. hope hospital doctors' offices keep requiring masks long time. I'm immunosuppressants ton people go GI doctor. important note India using vaccines less efficient ones available US. Neither vaccines used India approved use here. ""too many people lying. must hardcopy certificate ID"".... already see coming. “I medical condition prevents wearing mask, don’t disclose condition you.” -every moron pandemic.

Of course people going lie received vaccine. currently buying fake vaccine card instead getting vaccine free. people also took hydroxy chloroquine, hoarding gas plastic trash bags pipeline shutdown. I'm fully vaccinated shopped Wal-Mart without mask...I seemingly got lot dirty looks people still wearing masks. nice wear mask, really enjoy shopping. again, there's giant vaccination operation street 30 minutes, including 15 minute observation period. know people vaccinated yet. That’s fabulous idea ( ) still cases fully vaccinated people getting sick.
Opening everyone Australia vaccinated would end masses cases spreading community.
We hospital beds medical staff cope Covid outbreak country parts Australia.
All old people vaccinated. parents getting first shot next Friday. 

The country areas full old unvaccinated people poor access hospitals. virus start spreading parent’s small town it’s 25 bed hospital service several thousand people ( mostly old) population would decimated.
With zoom internet people wait everyone vaccinated.  work casino..they lie, talk us lying... Fuck mask linked story irrelevant position. ""If they're vaccinated, safe. vaccinated, safe. still wearing mask better yet, get vaccinated,"" told ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz.

Which exactly saying. vaccinated blessing CDC throw masks settings medical public transportation, living jurisdiction anti-science disregards highest public health authority land.

You saying something opposite CDC, wearing masks situations warrant it, extending fall. took experts say? geriatric children?  reason US cases UK 5 times poplulation. Naturally country 330 mill going far cases country 68 mill. Plus vaccinated nearly half population readily available everyone 12+. point people arent fully vaccinated either waiting get second shot, 12-15 age group given go ahead receive never planning get vaccine first place. know several people want anything authorities suggest. form thinking yourself, think doing. needs clarification Ill say show ADA papers. point. cares. people vaccinated wont affected idiots kill really want to. risk pose pay consequences.  Thanks! Happy oblige, guys want take shots, lie vaccinated, take second shot create mutations! leave comment? think form passport occur NY, NJ, MA, that's they're delaying removal mask mandate, rest country. :O lie McDonald's order know gonna lie vaccines. Liars all! Dickheads refused masks, refuse vaccination. mingle us took civic responsibility seriously. People gave year, life sheltering home, keep others safe. assholes think it’s ok go mingle us unmasked refusing (still) safety guidelines assholes buying fake ass vaccination cards. real issue. Here’s support government getting involved. perpetuate never ending cycle stronger stronger mutations Covid people freakin man woman COMPLY! RISE BERATNA Look, I’ve worn mask since day one, I’ve fully vaccinated since January. There’s science show benefit wearing mask anymore. It’s theatre point. CDC disagree me. points: 

1. It’s you. 

2. It’s state local authorities 

3. mandate stays mass transit, hospitals, prisons. social end here. suddenly everyone magically vaccinated weekend Agreed honestly cannot match energy. past year exhausting. know sucks immunocompromised people, I'm also done expecting government find perfect solution really think one exists. Risk small child transmission I'm concerned kids really anymore. Immune deficient people, I'm sorry. Stay home. There's large portion community selfish care you. part help people community family.

But fuck anti vaxxers anti maskers.

Let get covid. See much really like letting disease run course.   reminds question would get job applications asking ""if conditions right, would someone steal?"" would answer yes every time, apparently false. People steal. Everywhere. found ignorant braindead anti vaxxer! mean I'm expert essential worker heroes fast track access vaccines many states, walk today get vaccinated. 

Literally ones risk unvaccinated, remaining unvaccinated today, choice. Smaller populations easier vaccinate. I’m expert people won’t lie

I’m expert. lied cause I’m people    take expert figure out. anyways really vaccinated mask people gonna get sick liars family. might sniffle day. “Experts say lie” lmfao shit Sherlock CDC President Biden say fine. advocating position extreme shared scientific authorities head federal government.  masks forever? risk always People working small retail store. One infected unmasked person contaminates environment. Yes, get it. I’m curious see happens two weeks now. could wrong. sound conspiracy theory ish. vaccine rolled know significant portion population get vaccinated. matter what. goal herd immunity two ways get immune, get vaxxed get sick, point they're betting reaching herd immunity hard way. honestly think that's schools opened. Kids significant portion population. regulations could months months approve vaccine kids, they're putting hope kids get immunity contracting disease reasoning statistically get severely sick die. honestly think that's plan is. true, wish guidance something risks children. relying ""honor system"" public places take issue with, guidance itself. believe masking remained mandatory grocery stores public venues long enough EVERYONE chance protect switching ""honor system."" Yes continue mask fully vaccinated, relying ""honor system"" makes impossible working public avoid interactions unmasked patrons know vaccination status of. ""essential worker heroes"" exposed risk anticipate control over. need protect liars. risk very, very, low anything mild symptoms even get infected, actually looking like September October able vaccinated too! you. truly shocked read news knowing live area 7/10 adults vaccinated, children aren’t vaccinated, we’ve got kids attending school person.

This. strongly suspect higher percentage people community anti-vaxxers. one friend sends annoying anti-vaxxing spam. paints sort martyr blowback guess gets anti-vaxxer. ignore spam heartily sick it.

Some people know personally Covid right now. One person sadly passed away. late game! WHY? beyond frustrated saddened.

I'm going keep wearing mask. people personally know (though seen person died years) got Covid, something right. I've vaccinated, know, even want run risk catching mild case. mind masks all. problem people like you, me. I’m group wants every reasonable measure get us pandemic including social pressure keep unvaccinated masked kids get vaccinated really bolster herd immunity. I'm pretty sure plenty people going able mentally visualize spread infectious diseases whenever stuck large crowds going forward years come. vaxed. comfortable going public everyone masked....well that's 

I feel bad cannot get vax due medical reasons. people get haven't? sympathy get sick. 

I wish affect rest society adversely Anyone experience ""Aftershock"" side effects 2nd Pfizer dose?

I got vaccinated last Friday, May 7th. next day typical symptoms - headache, chills, general fatigue, body aches, 24 hours. I've felt fine since then, today woke symptoms except chills. 

At first thought hungover, one small drink last night, lasted day since 5am. could still that, could stuck something else, wanted know vaccine could reasonably eliminated cause. Venn diagram people don’t want wear mask people won’t get vaccine basically circle, yeah.  Honestly itll people come stores buisness's say "" condition"" ""my doctor said dont to"" probably one universal lie ""im vaccinated"". mention buissness bribing employees getting vaccinated ""small bonuses"". Therefore employees saying companys release mask mandates. Biden's comments made pretty clear, people taking risk hands. opportunity get vaccinated, free charge, like rest us already done.

And yes, CDC disagrees you, continuing wear masks until/through fall.  Hey CDC director, 15 minutes over. Thanks absolute dumpster fire information last 14 months.  Neither I, idea referring to. Yes, CDC also said safe vaccinated abandon masks. states local authorities decide want hold vaccinated population hostage, sure politicians may find unpopular primary season, general election.  also missing point. ✌🏻 You’re allowed use reason logic discussing covid. dare you! cdc doesn’t disagree. I’m factoring social pressure unvaccinated saving thousand lives important wearing mask crowded indoor situations.  comes two days restrictions due ease across country. got time healthcare workers got course. exact people get vaccinated almost exact group lie it.

(Not they're immoral. Rather, anti-vax arere ones anti-mask.) Noooo really.... Six Indian variant hospitalisations Bolton despite vaccine - Secretary Matt Hancock told Andrew Marr Show five people hospitalised Bolton Indian variant Covid-19, despite first vaccine added ""frail"" person received jabs also hospitalised new coronavirus variant. absolutely lie, stop wearing mask time soon. self enforceable. vaccinated, wear mask risk getting sick. follow guidance get sick, well, sorry stupid.

An unvaccinated person following rules hurting themself like minded idiots.
 
There's reason ""enforcement"" lie die. problem liars ears. . right stopped giving shit masking. choice manage personal risk using vaccination. I’m masking protect ignorant ass. thing fake animal service dogs.  great card. happy Charles managed get far ahead England? shit Sherlock CDC said completely state local authorities. hope consider social pressure needed keep half population unvaccinated letting virus rip them, like they’re mass transit. Yeah politics argument weird people angry decision Biden’s voter base think it, can’t say sure paywall detract point, it’s even 5%. 95% effective trials, 95% fewer infections among vaccinated control. Based real-world data, number vaccinated people actually get Covid like 0.02%. took minute digest numbers, statistics weird math. outlook actually better tend think.  boss told can’t legally ask employees they’re vaccinated trying accomplish argument trying make feel superior? agree choices parent great, make choices. Get bent.  y""all interested please read thread even variant escapes vaccines unlikely cause serious illness vaccinated another source unbiased, realistic information pandemic Take away government CoVid related aid anyone gotten first shot yet (unless medical exemption 12). Require businesses employees vaccinated want get another PPP loan (medical exemptions only) sort CoVid related aid. 

They want continue spreading CoVid, that's fine, we're longer responsible them. Totally! get it, stand behind decision tell truth. Private companies right refuse business reason, enough people choose bring business elsewhere, companies required vaccines die out. lying, wanting reap social benefits vaccine, without putting work actually getting it. wants lie order recieve social welfare. choice getting vaccine that's problem. hiding lying feels ""deserves"" handout society. excalibur, i'd like one. gonna lie Water wet. Fire hot. course people lie. vaccinated, haven’t heard breakthrough cases severe. 

Would deaths qualify? Google: Covid deaths fully vaccinated. Here's one quote found:

""Breakthrough infections resulted 835 hospitalizations 132 deaths, according latest figures CDC."" It’s clear comments I’ve received people willing sacrifice immunocompromised order get back normal faster. get it, I’m surprised. past two years eye opener selfishness human race.   I’m retail worker, wearing mask along glasses radio frigging sucks. Welcome! ""They report areas, hundreds unused appointment slots. fail mention next county scheduling six weeks enough.""

Can show work here? link valid news source showing appointments six weeks anywhere? seems like making shit up. 100% this. antivaxxers know real life nurses half peddle MLM woo. dont feel bad, fuck them. die. excommunicated, people even lie church! good idea nail salon anyway (especially workers). There's much silicon dust fine particulates masks really helpful environment. vaccine available adults county since middle March. low incidence well 30% vaccinated. conservative area.

Someone got hospitalized. Given odds, likely someone refused vaccinated rather someone cannot vaccinated. wonder feel (if survive) receive bill. mention long lasting complications. tiny thing get free vaccine vs alternative. never said epidemiologists delusional, simply overly conservative risk averse focusing ""zero risk"" mitigation strategy, freely admit article. even state would like see masks used next year, mean actually happen. however completely delusional, trying poke holes increasingly vast landscape studies defend regulatory overreach increasingly slim risk reliance ""studies released even week"" proves point even more.

I've referenced plenty studies previous posts, welcome look actually research. Israel study, Qatar study variants, UCSD/UCLA healthcare vaccine study, Pfizer/Moderna 6 month efficacy data, March interim results national healthcare study updated results yes, released week. recent releases week vaccine efficacy, breakthrough transmission, variant coverage LATEST avalanche data released year show thing, vaccines INCREDIBLY effective provide greater 90% risk reduction depending scope individual study, mention CDC breakthrough reports decided (this week) start focusing serious cases recorded 9500 reported breakthrough infections 100 million fully vaccinated individuals, making breakthrough rate .009%. 

Let's even go multitude studies last year debunked need outdoor masks, prevalence contact transmission, ability virus survive UV light. 

Yes ongoing research, consisting lot interim results preprint studies, single data set type report would suspect, sheer VOLUME research that's released steadily course year show basically data, well PLUMMETING death rate reported cases vaccinated communities support message, vaccines incredibly effective bring vaccinated individuals risk profile minuscule level. 

You're ignoring this, attempting discredit data that's collected year, opinion poll group doctors risk averse admission shows exceedingly risk averse. 

It's completely delusional, lose credibility it. Idk man, trying let go judging anyone mask point. I'm fully vaccinated parent children young get vaccinated yet. I'm wearing mask I'm afraid trust science says take off, I'm wearing one continue set good example unvaccinated children old enough need mask public still young recieve shot. crap would feel 10 year old going family one wearing mask? I'd feel self conscious. I'm going stand kids. So? unvaccinated get vaccinated tomorrow want to. shit Right. entirely fault public health messaging CDC themsleves.

Remember Redfield-""A mask effective vaccine""?   Nope.

Last saw around 10 million immunocompromised people US (and general estimates surveys years say around 3-4% population). lot diseases cause it, even people cancer fall group well.

Also people young old bodies fight without killing (basically bodies stupid try kill invaders ways also kill us).

So thousand people give shit them. Yes, danger every virus, difference chance reach herd immunity keep safe (just like every vaccine already). 

This issue people selfish. claim wearing mask oppressing freedom, actions forcing others stay home unable work take care without risking death. hypocrisy finest. actions hurt them, unfortunately.

A good measure modern civilization taking care moment I'm sure makes us point. Welcome comeuppance stage COVID-19. Pfizer said expect trial finish September approval October November.

By point, probably question whether we'll still considered emergency situation. think enough people get vaccinated reopened fast, we'll see. we're not, expect approval 2022. asymptomatic people transmit COVID-19?
Yes, infected people transmit virus symptoms symptoms. important people infected identified testing, isolated, and, depending severity disease, receive medical care.Jul 14, 2020 recently got second shot. Many people still waiting theirs. say suppose take week vaccine fully go effect. think kept mask mandate June, see didn't. can't handle another tourism season restrictions. course! Consider difference density. much US, smaller cities 100 miles apart, lagging vaccinations “Welcome Bumfuck, population 6” places between. I’m 49th state vaccinations per capita, last looked, (thanks, Wyoming!) today, 55% city live vaccinated, demand still pretty steady. We’re like collection bubbles homogenous country. Humans inherently trash proven otherwise. don’t know anyone think opposite. think people need honest realization inline CDC said. matter policy implement, you, me, us likely get covid point another. transmissible expectation, stated CDC, never able achieve true herd immunity. Officially would need somewhere 80 90% vaccination even chance herd immunity (updated February). currently peaking around 50 60% US. belief covid around many years come.

I say need mentally prepare for. personally rely belief vaccine prevent serious symptoms covid protect worst problems. such, matter much become infected, almost certainly point another. That's world live now. included proclaiming “follow/trust science/CDC,” saying “nah I’ll keep masking.” I’m going without mask

There's harm vaccinated folks masking though. also remember ridiculed wearing mask CDC advocating masking sure Covid spread touching surfaces, think science infallible either way. want say something may may find helpful. I’m trying tell feel. kids myself, know hard dial back fear dialed up, feel like don’t absolutely everything power (short going grid living isolated land similar, even possible) avoid getting covid, get get long covid die, it’ll fault. I’ve pretty close extreme end careful past 14+ months, teens got first shots new availability 12-15s, last members household so, I’m finally trying make pull back exhale attempt relax first time this. five weeks, they’ll fully vaccinated, *have* let go. 
 
Please read comments. There’s someone reporting though under-18s make 24% population, accounted 300 deaths 500k+. Another said group never made 2-4% hospitalizations. haven’t independently verified numbers, let’s say moment they’re accurate. 
 
I think question ask “at point, face evidence kids small fraction risk adults, CDC lifts masking vaccinated full knowing many unvaccinated simply lie order mask up, [37% US fully perhaps another 10% one dose second yet, point people can’t quite find way dial fear longer ultra careful, place emotionally there’s nothing get let ultra-vigilance, matter good news is, trusted source?” point become covid-believing unconvinced, unconvinceable, equivalent unreachable closed-minded pinhead covid deniers?
 
Myself, I’m keeping things clamped tight everyone house fully vaccinated point. keep saying, would idiotic run race 14+ months, drive car wall ten feet finish line letting someone get avoidably sick prematurely lax. point though, fully vaccinated, there’s really remaining reason continue constant fear pandemic become ingrained, second nature long. find approaching finish line, were, reading stats, I’m thinking fearful someone place (who’s obviously careful me) reason continue feel, vaccine available kids. 
 
What I’m trying say is, bearing mind toll taken us thinking people love, you’re looking fall under-12s vaccinated, look data, listen trusted CDC, get place say “the risk continues non-zero, stats say risk always lower ever imagined, creep half population vaccinated, thereby slashing number available getters/spreaders, risk getting much closer zero ever continuing hold tight, hurting loved ones needlessly, refusing convinced things much closer ok not, circumstances?” 
 
Had under-12s, I’m claiming could take advice casually say “ok, continue careful, it’s longer justified *that* careful”. perhaps, person position, may help get place greater peace you’re currently able consider being. Even change nothing precautions, find way place even know you’re overdoing it, risk far less knew, may reduce fear feel wait, greatly improve emotional well-being.  mean... yeah. 

Yes, everyone, vaccinated higher risk? UK variant, variant first identified UK.  prevent say 'first identified in' 'by' given location, variants simply assigned number. like artist formerly known prince known symbol..... 

The key difference US everyone needs vaccine access now. long must govt wait people get vaccinated? (rightfully) putting end experts people common sense? N95 masks herd immunity achieved?

We KN95s, they're actually comfortable cloth masks.  whole point cards? throwing window? didn't. think way around ""They're vaccinated, worry anymore. mask usage longer affects them."" Who's Hannah holes?     really. One patient alone Boston immunocomp created 20 individual mutations alone long covid course. correct assertion, common sense covid work way think. npr. Anti maskers basically shitty people, yep  yea. sign up. covid gonna really true though? I’m sure everyone assumes case, given covid spread entire world essentially. take podcast? absolutely way tell someone vaccinated not. CDC guidance masking effectively ended masking requirements. unless check COVID vaccine cards door it’s honor system got news honor system fucking work US ALLOWED wear seat belt then? car, body accidents hurt anyone else…. Say what? statistically relevant. Statistics drive policy, personal anecdotes. Duh. don’t need expert tell us certainty. nurse, drives *me* nuts! answer always same: please ask doctor. Good thing CDC tell everyone stop wearing masks post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Experts? experts? decent people common sense? Masks supposed protect oneself. vaccinated teen carrying unknowingly, due vaccine antibodies, passes unvaccinated teen, much severe reaction, plus kids spread unvaccinated kids health conditions, even worse, teachers family. Masks protect people you. example, piss gonna wet, even wear pants, wear pants safe. pretty simple, enough people world vaccinated ready this, let alone people unmasking, especially kids logic live, regional vaccination rates range 5% population whopping 20% densely populated areas. plenty vaccinations available, nobody left willing get shot.

it's like one student contribute group project expected get easy A, except group makeup 80% ""that one parasitic student"" physically impossible prudent 20% work demanded *because that's herd immunity works dammit*. Actually like 600k deaths now. Glad hear they’re getting side wave. Hopefully get enough vaccines arms prevent another.  I'll take word watching you, seriously, course people going lie come man trust people act like adults take care ""mandate"", give ammunition, wow wow stupid, burns. follow science? U fucking anti anti mutherfuckers better stay country know % total TP buys, saw people buying TP pallets , guess planning profit selling huge markup, end world pan out, tried return it. Costco even changed return policy give TP refunds ex, wife lies  I'm liar I'm totally gonna lie it. real. always another months idiots.  Amen that, Brother. health care professionals first receive vaccines, trial participants last year. vaccine components stay body short time getting cleared out, side effects would happen first weeks injection anyway. People really care getting sick. care cured.

I bet general public thinks effective vaccines think vaccines like rabies vaccine. take vaccine right around time likely gotten sick effective. take vaccine nearly 100% kill rate. read studies? media cherry picked number makes way much 95 percent effective that’s reported original vaccine studies many others (and studies linked. It’s misleading). clearly made mind also. moot point. fully vaccinated, let world burn. shit Sherlock determine someone overpaid? seems like people like relate CEO compensation typical worker pay say they're overpaid based difference... compensation supply vs demand type thing. position majorly affect performance company owners company easily justify spending insane amounts get right person, especially revenue hundreds billions. top companies competing attract best best virtually ceiling much pay them. things something worth however much somebody else willing pay it. Check Brazil. Don’t want ru. unvaccinated here. Including children. Breaking news lmao I'm young, free vaccine cheaper wages. I'm finally getting ahead I'm jeopardizing all. imagine losing wages needed expensive medical treatments. lost wages incentive enough.   don’t need expert know that. embarking schadenfreude phase COVID.

Aside kids 12 handful folks allergies, 95%+ folks get seriously ill opportunity prevent it. That's good! commend good parent wish like you. 

Though want clarify, 2018-2019 flu season, children died flu died COVID, large percentage children vaccinated flu.

There’s single child 12 vaccinated COVID (other statistically insignificant number might participating trials), COVID still lower death rate flu. hope comparison gives little peace mind :) husband fully vaccinated. know vaccines received shown 100% protect serious illness death (yay!), 100% protect illness (real-world effective rate Pfizer 90%). So, protected serious illness death, could still get infected pass along kids. risk serious illness/death them, low, zero. also understand risk long-term effects infection even illness serious. take responsibility parents seriously taking reasonable measures protect kids infection. 

Consistent masking low-effort, effective means additionally minimizing chance exposed. another thing provide additional protection family. Yeah, shit.

Most us would lie much less. 

I'm glad experts consulted here. Thankfully actually much closer does. least mrna vaccines effective. effective infection symptoms. Ofc saying still possible unlikely Would “biologist” go Internet lie? Experts need weigh one! Yes, but, like vaccine, herd immunity serves important protection yet able get vaccinated. 

Up now, mask wearing actually protect others, ourselves. Okay lots unvaccinated people wearing masks indoors huge part spread US. 

No need try dunk people trying understand spread Covid sub explicitly spread Covid know nurses acting recklessly ignoring guidelines whole pandemic. Probably spreading COVID sick patients whatnot. Definitely don’t see monolithically great anymore. good number dolts. Holy eugenics get cat h colds flu bugs easily weakened immune system. Still wearing mask. Plus, even though one vaccinated, vaccinated people still get sick Covid complications afterwards. However, chances people dying probably eliminated significantly reduced. Vaccinated people still getting sick Covid. I’ve already, want get variant again. you, I’ll me. How’s that? given worldwide pandemic COVID/SARS viruses circulation long time come, potentially forever (like flu).

the best argument vaccinating reopening vaccination provides high level protection even immunocompromised seniors nursing homes (aka, Petri dishes) largely protected vaccination. really. surge among unvaccinated. Definitely something like ""right back started worse"". agree, enough carrot. Well-said. underestimate number redditors happy wear masks forever.  Agreed. think early. wait till least July 4 opinion (where around 70% hopefully one dose) reevaluate.

The new CDC guidelines also screws patiently waited till April 19 (which ever state approved 16+) get shot got Moderna. We're 6 weeks away April 19. course they'll lie course epidemiologists know well. seems confused sending mixed signals every day. doctor, actual MD unlike yourself, told get vaccine history GBS triggered vaccines. reason I’m supposed get flu shot. trust science science says drop masks? probably flu became prevalent every year. Never reached herd immunity flu kept mutating. Likely COVID. We're talking USA here, elsewhere world they're struggling even getting vaccinations, let alone vaccine hesitant people. Awesome. fun. Society obviously give shit vulnerable anymore. take groups better long run since taking masks idiots let us reach herd immunity faster. Water wet here. Went store nervous unmasked. Everyone masked. Now, Kroger store, requiring masks everyone, I’m optimistic lot still mask here. (In Seattle, clear) become expert things obvious common sense? Australia 
 
They now, publish outlash decision imprison citizens travelled back reversed decision. Allow citizens return. Yes. numbers/percentages would help bit though. Apparently much ask you, right? so, appears so, leave replying someone actually intends help. own. guess that's going out. never support anti vax masks pre vaccine though  Post pandemic resolve banish certain terms forever. would put forth 'herd immunity' one feels like nails chalkboard 'cancelled'. Maybe replaxe couple difficult pronounce latin words discourage non-scientists conjecturing subject. No, lab blamed came paper believed cause COVID, identifying Sars-Cov-2 threat humans. believe paper dated started research April '19. Yeah believe humans COVID August '19 whenever everything Wuhan started.   Oh, yeah, definitely can’t speak China would like - I’m sure government would cover happened clue strict safety protocols are. (For reason, authoritarian regimes don’t always seem robust safety standards. genuinely don’t understand why, since preventing mass breaks usually beneficial matter equation use).

The real problem that, without hard evidence, claiming virus managed escape lab (presumably one scientists there) actually pretty dangerous. spreads fear necessary science and, importantly, paves way even dangerous theories.

It’s nature conspiracy theories “A Chinese lab accidentally released SARS-CoVi-2 ccp covered up” fairly easily lead “That person perceive Chinese decent secretly bio terrorist” “all laboratories studying viruses dangerous scientists too.” all, you’re willing believe first one without real evidence, would need evidence believe others? degree forced so. least care rights, evidently don’t No. Face customers? Yes. doctors note idea didn’t occur time, “it’s prohibited “ answer, didn’t stay there,  passing covid catching it. 100% effective preventing covid age group.

Those arguments knew good vaccines really were. 

You're protecting people much better getting vaccinated wearing mask. Much, much better.

Getting half teens vaccinated likely better masking adults also vaccinated. people made fake medical exemption cards mask Kroger's least vote feet find different bar drink ;) I'm sure follow saying, honest. Two weeks now, millions people vaccinated cases continue decline. Contamination environment relevant people even one mRNA shot. missing lot people never get vaccine rest us can't expected mask forever them.

Then weeks turn months, keeps going going, what? protect group protect themselves? mean people taking vaccine still masking miniscule impact spread compared people wont get vaccine STILL wear mask.

Mandates can't stay forever, like legally...most using emergency orders bound see legal challenges longer stay place.

At least major signal CDC spread unmasked vaccinated people minimal need worry, we're waiting anti-vaxxers, we're going waiting years unmask.   news, years intense spectroanalysis combing historical records, scientists confirmed sky is, fact, blue. 11. kept thinking going worst it, too! could beenso much worse. Mind quickly explaining sets pandemic apart 9/11 terms response? face customers all? know old job said needed doctors note “didn’t want panic customers”. walked back days made quit anyways. Depends live. Northeast 50 percent fully vaccinated couple weeks. 95 million fully vaccinated. 132 deaths. 0.00014% rate.

Fate would pretty pissed you. :) exactly  Well based Lowe’s Home Improvement morning, I’d say good amount people lying. I’m vaccinated still wore mask, it’s well hard. likely, people realize things besides flu similar symptoms. case would recommend therapy. ones anxieties stark contrast objective reality, there's shame seeking professional help. people left can’t handle that. don’t conform exact ideas, they’ll find way “cancel” you.   Duh. pandemic situation eradicate 2023 2024 unfortunate truth. live, county leaders officials gave residents local business owners permission consider Covid precautions strictly voluntary last spring summer. result, masks never widely worn, physical distancing never enforced, restaurants never stopped dine-in, crowd activities events never stopped held. Vaccines freely available walk basis age 12 up, prediction county top around 40% fully vaccinated end summer. message local government always ""if concerned, means take whatever precautions feel necessary, within county limits strictly voluntary personal choice"". us care wore masks avoided crowds could vaccinated. made choice, felt necessary. vulnerable family members went pandemic already high risk, continue taking whatever precautions feel necessary. rest? made choice too, that's say. think, point vaccinated offer enough protection virus killing acceptable risk many people. Therefore, decide go maskless without vaccine , you’re taking huge risk life. raise fair point, thanks. intention politicize *do* believe politics keeping vaccinated. I've removed unnecessary information, hope acceptable resolution. Doesn’t take expert figure u see title? sad, like anonymity. Plus, seen much reduced common cold flu?

Then add nut jobs vaccinate, wear masks social distance I'm happy wear mask ever health benefits pissoff antimaskers. You. Dont. Fuckin. Say? young kids?  Community transmission low enough places country chances contracting severe covid crowded bar probably sub 0.1 areas country. Higher rate dying car crash nobody would think twice getting car. It'll stress test immunity vaccine.

So we'll get see well spend 8 hours enclosed space infected person.

Yankee baseball team already found great. Depends state. Alaska Texas, there’s decent amount time. Washington, you’ve got great point. 95 million fully vaccinated. 132 deaths. 0.00014% rate.

Oh no. Danger. bad, they’ll get turn soon enough expert, cares unvaccinated lie it? vaccinated loved ones vaccinated. somebody unvaccinated point, cares. Let get sick infect people refuse get vaccinated. Entrust?  IDK I'm right mentally compare Patriot Act 9/11 I'm overreacting, think masks plexiglass may never disappear certain contexts, buses, airplanes, terminals. I've feeling significant minority people going wear masks rest lives, especially areas large Asian populations like mine. Yep, seems me. currently vaccines used even milder illnesses effectiveness around 60-70% consider good, Covid vaccine effectiveness anywhere lower 90% strain everyone losing mind. Im saying shouldnt keep eye strains fearmongering pretty hard one. one washing desinfecting groceries last spring. Well shit Sherlock Water wet vibes  expert ones lying ones aren’t getting vaccinated anyway. 

Get vaccine, wear mask do, recognize good place start opening back up. it’s clear cut issue CDC specifically said it’s individual state/local authorities decide kept. That's CDC explicitly said guidance people start moving away masks social distancing applies people fully vaccinated 

They've said repeatedly throughout debate policy still strongly recommend unvaccinated people (including children 12) continue masking maintaining physical distancing public hope good results coming despite variants India. many quality sources news information paywalls bother. Ah reminds lady last year said ""if got 2017 flu shot test positive covid-19 put dog covid-19 shot that"". shit that's word word lady said, faith things get better gone exponentially since then.  Like story two guys donkey type sigh? Awful melodramatic They’ll get antibodies one way another guess. Feel bad people around catch get it. Fucking paywall honest, things going get worse get better.

Part thinks completely okay companies fire workers refuse vaccinate without real reason, half think that's slippery slope... end day we're dealing peoples lives. able make decision could possibly end someone's life, quality life forever without repercussions.

We already laws place meant punish people unintentionally causing harm another person. time started using them. Coronavirus liked late. Can't take one back. months ago. disagree anything post here, statement ""But fail mention next county scheduling six weeks enough."" - make statement past tense. 

It sure seems like intentionally disingenuous. nowhere country takes six weeks get vaccine. Log internet bothers much. cares random people Twitter saying. live area go without masks want don’t wear mask. somebody gives stink eye target fuck em. never understand people say don’t want wear mask fear judged others. Lol idiots reason dealing ""hoax"" rest lives. I'm 39 years old pre-existing conditions second shot back late March. Older workers pre-existing conditions first dibs shot.  Kids sick deadly disease dyeing baffling doctors? Really? want circumvent paywall, see: Or, website regularly read, think subscribing website. think wearing mask ""grinding society standstill"" serious problem. Get help. Hell no. I'm wearing mask indefinitely point.

Plus, allergies best years. Score! 132 minuscule number comparatively., considering millions vaccinated. reality is, like diseases, society accepts certain number deaths society continues function onward.  Even unvaccinated never reason wear masks outdoors unless close someone's face. hospital physician. lied daily multiple occasions. people drive seventy highway believing they're immune car accidents, people die car accidents. logic vaccinated people walk around unmasked long unvaccinated continue wear fairly obvious, problem practice equally obvious, opinion.   Duh lol. still riled super league bullshit.

had burn comes two days restrictions due ease across country. unvaccinated population declines ratio vaccinated unvaccinated rise. Paywall whiplash! came home work Thursday high spirits knowing going end way sooner expected, even ecstatic PA removed mask mandate vaccinated people. encounter immeasurable disappointment NJ turned one 5 states kept masks.

Knowing NY's history vaccine passports, think they're going use extra time implement form vaccine passports. Probably special concern region; *think* we're traveled-between states country? (IDK.) mind; lets go back normal lets get back normal, even more... ahem, *skeptical* friends think would mean end world.

I actually went local park morning see anything really changed, disappointed see 50% people wearing masks. Outdoors, crowded all. Wonder vaccinated. Vaccines 100% effective, still small chance infection, enough people vaccinated create herd immunity risk greater.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  shit Yes, yes people lie. Guess many Q people go stores massless say vaccinated. We’ve got half population trying politicize chose public safety personal freedoms. justify saving business’ keeping open, showing dining / shopping person way business conducted now. 

Now vaccine still chose personal freedoms public safety would rather lie right thing. 

The solutions spreading corona easy yet half people see personal attack. 15 months we’re still fight tooth nail disinformation lies. Nope.

Not even close.

There office workers work remotely forced back office militant capitalist exploiting system actually tried protect middle class. protections? 

You service industry workers forced work pandemic overworked underpaid.

The bar owner different class service industry friends. Depending country, usa, states uch pa, already paid relief s.b.owners. much ppp went towars employees?

And students constitutes real learning? criminally underfunded educational system usa? somewhere else? 

We struggling. competition. I'm confused. corona vaccines also. even safer approved people flu vaccines. ask election know exactly vaccinated. OK link cdc guidance says vaccine reduces risk spreading covid 90%. said still possible unlikely. That's current guidelines exist teacher gets sick routinely 5-6 times per year. masks fucking awesome. flu, colds. incredible. Havent sick like 2 years. teaching full time person since September. you’re vaccinated cares? Mask mask.  idiots harass demand wear mask outside telling trust science  point concern me. We're nowhere near herd immunity risk spread mutation high anti-vaxxers/maskers take advantage CDC verbiage. requirements PROOVE *authentic* vaccination, that's different story. would never happen. know speeding officer, speedometer work.  article missing point. new rules changes trust vaccines protect want protected, even anti-vaxxers lie. choice whether want substantial risk Covid. last fucking time us health conditions can’t get vaccinated.  No. Group-safety ongoing omni-present. around you. depend every day (and benefit it, dozens 100’s ways probably aren’t even aware of). 

If live (or belong to) group community,.. part responsibility look safety health others. Thats 1-time thing. constant thing. annoying orange?  clear animals registered emotional support animals. really need doctor therapist sign statement saying need pet emotional support help treat psychological disorder. Awesome, another place can’t go immunocompromised person. I’m depressed. That’s fair, agree. Thankfully people JnJ. Even household group someone tested positive, likely bother get tested quarantine anyhow. bring work? Ok? said?  Apparently someone immunocompromised. Probably makes sense rest us. think restaurant workers last year vaccines out? balance required. scientists always going WAY protective don’t really care negatives going back normal. Vs Trump admin took way far disregarded everything, think CDC striking happy medium hoping move encourage people get vaccinated indifferent. got vaccinated still got covid? Kind shitty take mate know immunocompromised trust people Voting showing IDs need trust people vaccinations. want proof require both. HUH DOY

#WE DIDNT NEED EXPERTS FIGURE lie getting sick, feeling well, ending hospital dying enough incentive?! 

I think lot people can't comprehend happening world. unprecedented lifetime. That's I'll never stop wearing mask. pandemic permanent there's variant kills 100% people.  say wear mask, anyway. Set good example. care everyone wanted vaccinated already is? need expert tell people lie?  problem kids, adults, can’t get vaccine time. Masks aren’t 100%. Even unvaccinated people still wear masks, it’s going much person standing next talking Covid isn’t wearing mask. Awesome, made feel much better. Thanks.  Got second Pfizer yesterday woke today nothing headache. kind figured would case. swear, feel like Reddit users particular severely dramatic. discount got people badly, people pretend like body aches headaches feeling hit debilitating funny. like ""man flu"" feel 100% dying.

I used feel way kid. finally realized literally suck push past feeling. Holy shit. I’m expert really think cdc, Biden administration, nearly every state governments health agency considered fact? They've done calculus, even assuming people stupid. They've determined safe.
 
We switching state enforced safety measures personal responsibilities safety measures. Dumb people dropped mask might get sick. Sorry they're stupid. Even 7/1 think soon. got vaccinated ASAP, days allowed, actually finessed appointment wasn’t supposed month. So, it’s completely realistic responsible people helped us pandemic opposed working us, could waiting full vaccination even end June, early July, still exposed anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. entire pandemic unfair, final spit face. should’ve either held mask mandate mid-summer, start cracking vaccinations. don’t want get vaccinated? supermarket. planes. movies. It’s different legitimate health concern, I’ll gladly pay taxes fellow Americans need, I’ll also gladly wear mask that’s takes. True, though new variants causing worse symptoms kids don’t know long term effects lungs. child kid’s school hospitalized month. Another child school still can’t taste food told doctors 60% lung capacity currently don’t know he’ll ever get point breathe fully again. families anti-mask families fought school kids wear masks. different opinion. 

When kids go places, wear masks continue so, science says mask wearing, N95 similar masks, really doesn’t help much prevent getting disease around infected wearing masks themselves. Wearing masks much prevent spreading germs others helping greater good. assuming CDC publicly announced covid airborne, pretending airborne operating such. Even early CDC advising public health bodies minimize risk infection event airborne. CDC public facing agency see making announcements dodging again. long term studies? concerned long term covid effects without evidence long term vaccine effects evidence though? People don’t want get vaccinated won’t get vaccinated either way. can’t keep wearing masks rest lives bad choices. might places already. remember case CA someone charged lying sex partner HIV giving them. seems like law could apply here, right? Private schools online academies making killing 2021. Enrollment went open completely full waiting list many them. Public schools become indoctrination centers. Many parents permanently removing kids public indoctrination centers. need continue encouraging travel companies require vaccinations. Several focus groups shown vaccine hesitant people would get shot immediately came summer cruise.

Selfish problems require selfish solutions. We've known vaccinated need masks months. reason kept social compliance. inflection point vaccination reached, diminishing returns punishing vaccinated. that’s great, 100% choice. support freedom choice medical privacy. 

Now everyone else could stop believing they, government, international bureaucracy say whatsoever medicinal treatment average American gets, could go back normal. guess never happens. 🙃 Right. example, mRNA vaccines thought about75% effective California variant. Effectiveness measured unvaccinated (placebo control group). 

At 75% effective, means that, else equal, 4 unvaccinated people would catch symptomatic COVID, instead 1 vaccinated person would. That's great, start going bars now, risk go 4X unvaccinated going bars. 

Now, ""all else equal"" part big part protection - lessens community spread people get vaccinated. want people get vaccinated instead saying ""oh well, problem."" adds protection people vaccinated. They'll probably proud even lie it. OP thread talking non-vaxxinated people lying vaccinated therefore causing mutating n vaccine resistant well penetrate younger populations easily.

Do get that?

Which makes wonder many people gave Clap Herpies to. posted another thread. 

The probability someone lying vaccinated, wearing mask, close someone extended period time, actively contagious case covid, isn’t going high. Jokes them. pretty simple. Vaccines working well. communities could possibly devastated covid non vaxxed communities. little darwinistic herd thinning call pandemic over. true. true,.. pandemic stats would one constantly rising curve. wasn’t, enough people (thankfully) followed guidelines masking, isolation social distancing. 

Every smart good choice make, especially public, likely noticed (and setting positive example) far people probably realize. even *if* ""just flu"" - flu still dangerous virus kills thousands people annually (in typical year). CDC basically passed buck health safety $8 hour retail employees point. felt pretty uncomfortable started wearing mask. I'm used I'm uncomfortable idea taking inside. think totally normal. 
 
The non-normal part trying enforce rules people discomfort. variant emerges won’t US. much high vax rate virus develop meaningful mutation. countries different stories, mask mandate (or lack thereof) effect good news is, point won’t lie... Really, mean Apple’s M1 chip 1 transistor?  could cover Time magazine many layers hate ignorance represents.  F yes CDC screwed this. conservatives around Texas think lies BS method introduce authoritarian stuff.

Now I'm sure ""trust science"". 

Ive got toddler cant vaccinate yet im even stressed. Seems similar NYC. I’m curious next week like tho That’s totally fair. add last year hopes vaccine. data says works well. thinks fair say right don’t known variants pose risk vaccinated folks. scientists specialize field find assume it’s safe forgo mask places CDC written out. 

I get fear though, I’ve worked retail (grocery non grocery) since began definitely fear unlearn. say I’m going cautious get close without mask. called months ago. sub result pure fear mongering pandemic starts wind down. sub EXIST without virus present collective consciousness. interact kids 12 others can't get vaccine whatever reason affects you. outdoor place like zoo park risk kids low regardless peoples mask use. keep distance, stay outside enjoy summer. Note: anti vaccine anti mask. Monday 3 kids vaccinated well husband I. And, continue wear masks inside regardless state/federal mandates. certainly idea, may mean something like lack muscle tone support ventilation. time, hardly seems like blessing force upon someone advanced dementia, benefit of... months years advanced dementia. US 36%... lower bar 14% call good? made professionals doesn’t make good. Jets made professional football players, completely suck. CDC blew pandemic big time.  man met 12 people lifetime, gotta trust 'em. Sounds like you’re probably unintentionally coming idea vaccine passports… people never going wear masks get vaccination. 
But increase confidence people vaccine's effectiveness preventing illness. Many people doubting this, number would lie vaccine.

This change politicized, GOP.  fact people STILL asking shit like says needs said. surprise anti mask people stupid top liars cowards. complete phase III approved India?

They not! Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Also vaccine proven 100% effective.

Heck, even CDC afraid reality, point removed “vaccinated infected” data VAERS data website. it, showed higher infection rate vaccinated people non-vaccinated. higher severe illness rate.  Took 5-6 months all, year. Backlog already fucked due federal employee shutdown begin year.

On bright side, least good next 3+ years lol new rules stupid. compelling vaccinations point. Travel/Education/Work requirements, likely summer out. There’s considerations take account besides covid point. Another 3 months heavy restrictions terrible economy.   Surinam like Netherlands' struggling adult child. Netherlands struggles, Surinam worse probably get own. need help huge loss face one's children beg neighbors help could taken care within family. Let us know goes. type RemindMe! here? real meaning plague.  Kudos whoever higher ups work instituted policy. Might good give positive feedback, help counter b.s. may recieve. start? went Walmart yesterday masks required. NC dropped mask mandate vaccinated.  point effective. still provide plenty protection spread severe disease. easy. us children. adults vaccine, kids eligible. liars endanger kids. result, lockdown *increasing* many responsible, vaccinated Americans.

Further, liars perpetuate vaccine-receivers consistently exposed virus. increases (IANA epidemiologist, numbers) odds breakthrough case may turn breakthrough epidemic, means another 2020. I’m NJ still masks I’m going Florida 2 weeks can’t wait face naked Publix Putting qualifier good idea. opens abuse, plain simple, especially enforceable. Either lift mask mandate none. I’m assuming haven’t gone game last 72 hours, right? I’m heading game next week first time since 2019 I’m pretty pumped hopefully without mask 7's key number here. Think it. 7-Elevens. 7 dwarves. 7, man, that's number. 7 chipmunks twirlin' branch, eatin' lots sunflowers uncle's ranch. People die flu time don’t talk that. vaccinated, compare death rates flu percents dying similar. Plus, one add context died extremely old extremely vulnerable. Funny mention July 2019, nasty flu strain going around summer. I’m sure bunch people remembering that. Firstly, 2/3 adults, total population. Secondly, know exact threshold ""herd immunity"". country in? you’re US go get tested peace mind negative test, sign vaccine immediately. CVS/Walgreens/rite aid new mask rules terrible idea. really matter though. people get vaccinated catch it, pass ones vaccinated deal consequences stupidity. compare cfr among vaccinated, order get measure vaccine efficacy multiplied disease severity. again, flu severity factor vaccine uptake among vulnerable kids biology, US. speaking parent cardiology patient, gets flu shot every fucking year. OP saying all. OP saying grown adults getting vaccinated danger kids. adults get vaccinated eligible would save lot lives. still required times unless actively eating drinking

It's like restaurants around beginning. clearly absurd, non science based policies. Either masks need times need all, taking nonsensical. like switching back forth raw condom intercourse. Dammit America Even educated people stupid Apparently everyone gas station morning vaccinated. Hell, I’m lying right now. They'll lie?

Don't mean already are? already seen reports people getting fake vacation cards! Yeah, personally think going spur people get vaccine there's enforcement. people getting going lie stop wearing mask instantly. incentive get vaccinated get reward without even it. whole change made free anti-vaxxers. I'll watching numbers next couple weeks see happens...  live, would lie get appointment April 15th, *I* would considered ethical violation.

FWIW, notification list local clinic get leftover doses end day never got notified. Guess people list needed. Back trump president supporters said make rules mandates people would right thing. Biden want look that, right thing chance. Ah yes, asking people mask order prevent pandemic spreading.

The hallmark authoritanism. great man named Caillou said “thats 🙂”  That’s interesting since Maine leads US highest percent fully vaccinated. may lose top spot though continue slow down. Well, duh. seem like terrible human take expert figure wouldn’t frustrating would allow vaccinated citizens leave return without stay hotel quarantine system. comes time accept tiny bit risk let go. elderly vaccinated already. risk fairly low, especially vaccinated travelers. Yes change stance new data/information. Anti-covid/maskers/vaccines refuse budge made stand. That's difference science belief.if anything respect admit needed change policies Yeah. Hard explain wtf happens COVID. live Michigan pretty strict restrictions still spiked significantly throughout March April. think anyone fully understands beast yet. least masking makes sense simple do. I'll stick entire family vaccinated regardless. Best patient, doubt. Covid aside, post-ICU outcomes people dementia terrible.

I'm pro-mask pro-vaccine, Democrat progressive, think hilarious. 

It's poking much needed fun cultural trend gotten completely control, point absurd. fair, Texas may ""opened up,"" anywhere big cities people conspicuously wearing masks recently (like, week). stores publicly saying they're required last couple days. 

So, expect numbers continue trend despite Great Unmasking (we're like 55% vaccinated Austin, think), might reliable numbers impact another weeks, least.   Similar concept vaccine passports, idea carding people vaccination card somewhat feasible? course carrying around hassle still. experts right here. fuck thinks Americans going tell truth? Hes Texas subs, I'm assuming Texas.

Hes also full shit, downward trend slowed noticeably removed mask mandate, several weeks, hospitalizations started ticking back slightly. 

Removing mask mandate measurable negative impacts Covid recovery, people gaslighting bad caused nothing reason. 

The data literally right front looking it.  There’s also million fucking diseases hit immunocompromised hard.

If don’t think you’re safe, wear mask. damn right they’ll lie. fellow Americans narcissistic selfish. It’s disgusting. But, is, is.

Around here, think big deal.   like people named Adolf WWII happened. Yeah, infection models complicated hear. Texas may people antibodies already due previous severe breakouts, idk.

Masking simple vaccinations. data I've read shown symptomatic infection happens extremely rarely fully vaccinated people. Transmission also seems low based emerging data. far I'm concerned, fully vaccinated covid-invisible probably depends state, tho, right? Like Michigan, mandate lifted vaccinated people. think schools power saw unvaccinated people need masked here. Still problem schools that, tho. know Florida aggressively tried prevent kids wearing I’m telling truth! got my...uh...3rd dose Diezer COVID-18! stupid, covid obviously fake, nobody ever died it, old would died anyway, can't get vaccines anyway asthma! /s you’re university student: read abstract matter Anybody thinks anti maskers honest they've vaccinated might dumber anti makers themselves, that's saying LOT. I’m that. Luckily it’s summer snd spend lot time outdoors. 

It’s little thing like buying shoes. kids need new shoes. I’d like go try make sure we’re getting shoes fit (as opposed ordering online possibly send back get different size shipped us). course, don’t think I’m taking shoe store now. 

That’s one example could rattle lots examples well. Even masks required skipped lot indoor activities last year, think we’ll skip indoor activities mix adults around. Luckily schools still continue require masks adults obviously none kids vaccinated elementary level. BREAKING NEWS: Water wet. CDC says, cases non-existent within weeks. /r/nonewnormal recently discussing obtain fake vaccination cards healthcare system definitely broken vaccines free everyone catching covid offered free vaccine still fault. Agreed! “It’s pandemic. think employees ugly, ugly people.” Even states lower numbers, look bit closer, you’ll see 50-60% urban areas surrounded lot single digit numbers extremely rural counties, much like electoral maps. Taking vaccine rural counties probably boost numbers, meantime, they’re far enough apart slow spread significantly. know one state didn’t even *have* single case last summer, joked “nobody lives there.” isn’t far off, it’s hundred people, heavy farming community; don’t go anywhere. vaccine mostly protect you, *do* get covid anyway, unlikely severe. People lying hurt ineligible vaccine. many science deniers 🤣 half children contract COVID experience long term symptoms lasting 120 days. Relaxing mask mandates way soon. hospitals needed time (near beginning things) masks readily available like they're now? Surprised pikachu face two choices.

Remember, one point regular people wear masks health care workers could them.

No one believes anti-maskers going anything idiots they've along.

It's rather unfortunate people reason pandemic continue go on. wanted life go back normal, people vaccinated. know shitheads can't think anyone besides generally care actions affect others.

Especially ones printed fake mask cards. CDC well aware lie. Everyone aware this. born day. pain can't get vaccines, I'm sure else CDC continue vaccines safe are.

They can't compel people get shots; anti-maskers continue reject them; can't get shots want otherwise can't get them, majority people want shot getting it. can't expect masks work indefinitely, either, people becoming sick every day. People eventually embrace risk, many others already done. previous guidance, CDC way forward, guidance updated.

The idea everybody vaccinated stems need eliminate COVID; ship sailed last June, cows still expected return barn. COVID replaced pigs, stay. Finally, CDC threw hands said, ""OK, want deal Covid?"" worry it; much Covid want. already know vaccine want live.”

I can't say blame them; I'd probably same. feel bad can’t get Covid shot, allergies, whatever else, don’t feel bad someone gets sick refuse get vaccine. like every anti-vaccination talking point. think that’s opposite unvaccinated person gonna lie. know someone Covid less 2 weeks ago unvaccinated went Disney world without mask. think honorable??? fucking course they’ll lie Ah, okay.

Of course, admitting masks haven’t 100% easy, great, much fun! heresy certain circles, but, that’s truth. It’s simple that. Sure, people aren’t vaccinated won’t wear masks forced, many still wear masks indoors they’re told to. Now, none that.

In general, virus gonna virus, vaccine gonna vaccinate. Variants really matter. I'm glad New York Times happened run article day CDC made announcement highlights poorly CDC guidance thought out.  Hopefully messaging becomes better new guidance. still theoretically spread covid vaccinated? Yes. chances reduced it’s something society worry about. 

There lots things life minute risks don’t adjust lives (at time phone could explode satellite could fall sky) vaccinated people spreading covid needs join acceptable, tiny risks. It’s wrong problem CDC trusting unvaccinated still listen mask up. won’t. Either everyone masks one does.

What cdc saying scientifically accurate they’re trusting people actually follow they’re saying, know unvaccinated won’t.

Sure, “not wearing mask correctly” easier see make decisions based people, “lying vaccine”.  think US many anti-vax types think. mean rates pretty high still going up. you’re vaccinated care you’ll fine yourself. also strange many people chomping bit open yelling CDC wrong incompetent, ignoring advice trusting *their* biased judgment...up announcement two days ago. ""CDC made career scientists whose judgment trusted""

People trust CDC. say guidance matches want happening.  going hold halt world antivaxxers come around? won't. yet see real overall infection increase, vast majority hospitalized people could vaccinated turned down. hopefully surge areas small anti-vax clusters. Actually, is. You’re behind times.  Look numbers: expert. People lie. never tell lies. Perfect, go on. Thank let’s simplify point... could get vaccinated. Within 3 weeks week holdouts getting vaccinated cases would unbelievably rare. 

Right PA county celebrating low case counts finally are.  Yet 350K county clocking daily numbers Israel know fact whole infected families refusing test. decision start thing, whether thought necessary greater good not, undermined long term credibility.

We capacity selflessness great amounts, we've seen history. lying, politicizing pandemic politicians media caused people act fucking tribal. Slap them.  got one UT Southwestern first shot second shot people first time weren’t getting one. It’s MyChart. hope don’t get point need vaccine passport, I’m sure provider printable form get laminated. Pharmacist here, like 30/70 split. 30% great hardworking, 70% ""crazy lazy"".

I’ve hung hearing often “we know immunity vaccines lasts longer natural immunity,” we’ve vaccines around much less time natural immunity. part failed make sense me. Things like happening. Except country would measures place like rapid testing, contact tracing vaccines passports, probably occur infection rates much lower.

Falsifying federal documents felony. worried it, report yes factors. also love diplomatic scientists officials : 'may' new variants transmissable.

sloooolwy put hand fire burn badly :P I've never expert anything. I'm thrilled apart experts now. thoughts exactly. appears working too, based people know fence vaccinating 12 year olds. They’ve got appointments now. I’m disappointed twelve years olds doses nine year old it’s come even immunized, summer probably safest time remove mask security blanket people don’t consider anti-vaxers still somehow willing take wait see approach puts us risk new variants. keep kiddos sheltered little longer means safely return school fall. Bloomberg’s Covid—19 tracker March 27 said 4 months away covering 75% population daily vaccination pace. could kept pace would reached 75% July. Instead, it’s May vaccination rates plummeted point still 4 months away current pace.

I’m sorry it’s that’s last bit sounded like lol

I agree though.  many venues screenings say Negative covid test suffice. They're Vaccinated spectator section Dodgers games. think foreign countries gatekeeping based vaccine status antibodies traditional strain may provide adequate protection mutant varieties. They've seen number re-infections particularly Brazil. don’t agree. think CDC little sense people actually do. Lol No, all. 9 yr old 4 old understand ok mommy daddy wear mask vaccine, elementary school dropped mask mandate last week, 9 yr old continues wear mask (the daycare never toddlers wear em) unavoidably go store, wear masks understand. 

They're stupid. know can't drive. can't drink. Etc. one ""GOVERNMENT BAD CAN'T TELL DO!"" echo chamber participants, feel sorry you

I get vaccinated someone tv said should, believe science modern medicine WANT CONTRACT DEADLY VIRUS

crazy, know people can't vaccinated? Immunocompromised cancer patients first get vaccinated. CDC recommends everyone 12 get vaccine unless allergic ingredients. Also, children significant risk Covid-19 I’m really interested whether anyone answer. could another reason timing. partner immune compromised wait last week get vaccine. body enough cells built could attach vaccine make effective. Could doctor said 'dont get efficacy low' type scenario. ask election. runs assumption people wont vaccinate wont wear mask wont lie vaccine status. like mandated vaccine passports US either. Antibodies end-all-be-all immunity. think still measles antibodies you? still ain't gonna get measles. gonna need booster shots covid data points long lasting immunity. news run many things matter like antibodies fading claiming immunity 3 months one point. Where's mass reinfections then? Nowhere found.

Here's study showing memory B &amp; immunity covid shows signs fading.   That's point, they're spreading could give me. Many pregnant women getting advice OB - included. also know people prior anaphylactic reactions vaccines thus advised get it. 

And honest, regardless reason behind getting vaccine - choice medical advice - becomes responsibility unvaccinated individual protect health. choose careless wind hospitalized, hospitals thankfully longer overrun. Yes, clear without mandate, people trusted follow guidelines keep others safe.

When belligerently endanger people around you, need told do. governing bodies for.

You chance voluntary compliance. work government step protect people anti-science conspiracy theorists extremists. I’m sure lot people might still bit hesitant taking mask that’s fine. really matter though. unvaccinated pose threat unvaccinated, they're adults, access vaccine, free charge. actually need keep track vaccination status time. shit. needed expert this? Well could specific original comment. Anyone reading could taken comment many ways. now, UK lags behind US, except total first-dose vaccine % population. However, idea that’s talking due lack detail comment. know that. don’t care. ya gonna shitshow   Michigan people vaccinated 2 weeks required wear mask Saturday. Yesterday, seemingly 90% customers vaccinated. I’m expecting cases rise one saw coming. people calling personal responsibility even longer Kind gray area. it’s one unvaccinated person (or household unit however many, you’re exposed people every day,) everyone else vaccinated, yeah, probably. wouldn’t go mixing unvaccinated households yet.  spend amount time worrying caring it? think accurate say shut country people like that. shut relieve pressure hospitals. 

now bunch people caught covid either died recovered, bunch people vaccinated. pressure hospitals relieved. 

i personally prefer leave people please. care less choose get vaccinated not. Yeah, true. deliberately ignored public facing authorities, however, many scientists considered models. 

For example, talk herd immunity without factoring natural immunity, bound unrealistic false right gate. Masks protect people around you, self children significant risk Covid-19. point care? people want vaccinated ones don’t care won’t. Soooo Reddit care fucking much. much guys hate near end America. Get fuck Employee: 'Hey boss I'm vaccinated, I'd like stop wearing Boss: 'Oh ok, check vaccine Employee: *hands Boss: *reads Boss: 'ok good, enjoy wearing Employee: 

Doesn't seem hard me. people refusing vaccine, I’d agree you. Vaccine hesitancy lot complex though. fuck getting downvoted 😂 Jesus Christ I’ve lost faith humanity reading comments sub Lots people saying vaccines look less effective mild disease. Apparently Times India ""unreliable news source"" (?) triggering automod autodelete google quote want source, elsewhere too.

""“The vaccines may less effective mild disease think they're less effective severe disease. combination less effective mild disease, they're almost certainly less effective transmission,” Prof. Harnden told BBC.""

Immune escape (known L452R) enhanced transmissibility go hand-in-hand erosion vaccine efficacy, really understand people think stretch point.

They always phrase caveats avoid panicking public things extremely well studied yet. Exactly. Similarly already covid, tested positive, quarantined got negative test. immunity really care person next does, since meeting elderly immunocompromised people. son's pediatric pulmonologist shows CDC data children son's chronic lung condition, I'll get board. 

Until then, I'm hurting anyone vaccinated wearing mask. body, choice. surplus vaccines, everyone really wanted vaccine gotten one. Also, children 12 significant risk Covid-19. COVID-19's death rate correlation poverty, unless poverty prevents obesity. see it’s impossible adult conversations you.

And yes vaccinated.  Yes, goes show CDC weigh lot different concerns issuing guidance. undoubtedly scientific evidence backs ending mask mandate guidelines, may moving quickly reasons.  Time celebrate then, let's go sounds like real piece shit. sorry work someone selfish  Hm, see, like 1-2% percent difference efficacy, I'm reading right? excellent reassuring then, thank you! Yes, must comply executive orders laws states localities. However, noted remain meaningfully step scientific authorities well top federal government, perhaps citizens jurisdictions voice opposition maintaining anti-science stance. Almost 0% chance death point contention though statement immune compromised ineligible. Vault-Tec entered chat.  earned block. Goodbye. GET VACCINATED. nearly half america ignorant buys conspiracy theories (anti vax starters). people really think one know covid big deal CDC inconsistent throughout pandemic. vaccination rate high enough make recommendation. opened vaccinations 12-15 year olds wait maybe July lot teens vaccinated. lot people don’t understand fact community spread virus vaccinated people still get covid, yes includes severe case covid. Also, doesn’t rule apply people natural infection. evidence vaccination protective. Also studies show one dose vaccine enough people natural immunity second dose might useless cases. guideline based science cdc trying convince people get vaccinated. arguing people masks fucking work showed CDC guidelines SARS, MERS ( covids), flu, swine flu, avian flu... Etc. Pulled study study done past mask efficacy. 

Why fuck would masks sudden stop working? Especially disease attacks respiratory system.

I know lied, think long term damage fucking mask hoarders would done. pushed goal posts herd immunity, using science efficacy vaccines let people know hey really need mask anymore. bullshit less 10% spread COVID doors, weasle lawyer talk.

They said, 

masks work short supply please hoard, emergency anyone caught price gouging prosecuted fullest extent law. fucking Americans pull together fight disease, need time study find best protocols procedures slow spread treat victim's. hopefully come cure vaccine.

Thing low supply PPEs , part, individual American citizens. There's clear evidence countries corporations ones initiated hoarding. Hell China started buying even thinking going lockdown. Oh I'm sure they've heard. slow change. Like fucking glacial. could give everyone got it. probably don’t want determine vaccinated isn’t? Haha. It’s basically national pastime. don’t think we’re time utter necessity? we’re even asking anywhere near much effort was. Wear piece cloth stay home/distant. That’s it. Get free vaccine. Go back normal. vaccinated? Science says vaccinations work 100% safe, close get. shit sherlock. People make **fake service dog papers**. course they're gonna lie vaccinated. would excited wear mask anti-vaxxers get see shit eating grin. seen shit 43 year olds, TBH. little harder breathe. Maybe much you’re air conditioned space, sitting, you’re moving around, generating body heat, especially it’s warm humid, yeah, you’ll start breathing harder, it’s uncomfortable. Plus, sweat doesn’t evaporate well, start feeling like need chew air inhale. Like said, worth preventing something worse, know vaccinated people, isn’t anything.  continue taking risks feel comfortable with. see rest us fully vaccinated need pretend vaccinated. ""their own""! Liability damage do. cause 90 car pile interstate responsible fixing car. free buy auto-insurance sense free drive car public roads. insurance cover cars trucks pile up.

There important difference actions choose privacy home actions take business opened public. Putting welcome sign front door pit people fall funny. maybe funny get sued injured people.

Hypothetically could allow business put sign saying ""hand washing optional employees"". would argue sign needs much prominently displayed bathroom. impression local board health live would fine restaurant failing meet inspection. board shut outbreak failure comply. 

When get injured work medical bills covered workman's compensation. effectiveness vaccines still studied certainly much less 100%. employer puts proximity dangerous situations dangerous people employer needs track damage gets done. certainly they're advertising pet free place can't get dander out. better hope right, otherwise, they'll send bill deposit cover it, send collections pay up.  point going happen. inevitable mask restrictions lifted unvaccinated people wearing masks. vaccines work. infect want, I'm vaccinated I'm done wearing masks Yep. see posts like going soon people going lie counterproductive. Unvaccinated people wear masks inside. enforceable way prove someone vaccinated / unvaccinated? official vaccination document. cards reminder slips. maskless person entering store: “Are vaccinated? Yup.” sound like expert continue so, CDC agree defer random Reddit opinion. Politicians got first.  Nope we're gonna lie even wear mine shower, never know dangerous viruses could be! Oh. actually kinda sounds like person needs mental health intervention. believe wait kids vaccinated fall ease masking.

The CDC agree you, defer guidance. Unless specifically referring mask guidance kids themselves, case expected wear them. Unvaccinated kids still expected wear masks fall. 

However, vaccinated adults today, longer need wear masks vast majority circumstances.  That's they're saying! can't read headline one quote taken context.

Let's follow science, people's feelings.

Also, get health info Twitter.  ""the point American adults ample time get vaccinated""

Really want drive home waiting 2-4 weeks would made BIG difference everyone eligible April 19. know state (VT) outlier people setting appointments April 19 looking 1st dose beginning may unless able log 8 (so work time day). much people say ""I care safety unvaccinated made choice"" bunch us limbo meanwhile, seen 1 person group bring up. really great. pace going average probably reach lowest point since pandemic started sometime next week. looks well probably reach &lt;20k cases first time nearly year today too.  there's lightning storm, take shelter instead standing open field, yes. I’m glad kids still seem mostly safe serious infection. None kids anywhere near 12 likely vaccinated another year least.  expert confirm people lie Calculated risk. They’re going replace carpets cat dander, best recover depreciated value old carpet, plus unit vacant they’re it. 🤷‍♂️ “Everybody lies.” - Gregory House expatriate, sometimes people live lie make believing lie. children’s level anxiety fine. 

I think I’ll focus empathy others. Something that’s desperately short supply today’s world. 

Thanks suggestion.  bowling alley last night couple people said fake cards bought someone filled out.

All think is… you’re one putting harms way lol. course fucking will! literally cannot trust people anything personally benefit them. case, lying personally benefits they? like we're gonna allowed check people's vax cards (which could easily forged anyways) pick coffee sbux. already. mask mandate still applies mass transit. anti science?

And would hardly consider wearing mask “holding hostage”. That’s overly emotional phrasing. would continue wear masks save thousand lives kids vaccinated fall. does, he’s right (for once). works, many aren’t completely vaccinated still need restrictions stop high level hospitalisations. Models show relaxation tomorrow may possibly much, many unknown factors. People extra careful weeks might enough let vaccination rate catch up. deal waiting rooms 2009 pandemic flu season every year?   wish worked like that. Unfortunately, anti-vaxxers continue keep virus alive years come. continue catch it, spread it, varying cluster-sizes throughout world. long virus able thrive (even small groups), everyone potential carrier/spreader; even vaccinated individuals. vaccinated individual still pick virus, spread others. need continue wear masks, even vaccinated, eradicate virus. Everyone able get vaccinated, needs so; eliminate potential contact points virus. Unfortunately, people seem think cannot spread virus vaccination. Or, think getting vaccine affect them. Costco Indiana already telling people don’t wear mask vaccinated store. course nobody wore one. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️    Nobody lies!!! stupid dangerous is, least makes sense TP Basically, vaccine works *better* mask ever preventing getting sick preventing getting anyone else sick. may consider vaccine substitute masking, unless mask required state, county, business time.   Risk reduced. reason U.K. think good idea take time delivery? 

&amp;#x200B;

Article behind paywall. You’re going judge people without knowing they’re immunocompromised going chemotherapy can’t vaccinated? 

And it’s completely safe keeping mandate mass transit vaccinated well?  think confusing vaccine hesitant vaccine resistant/vaccine hostile.

For someone actively vaccine(Vaccine resistant), unlikely anything get take it. 

Vaccine hesitancy different- necessarily it, reservations concerns. may open it- necessarily sold putting new product body, especially see clear benefit.

Given tone discussion- easy see someone could wonder benefit vaccine- lot mixed messaging, suggestions vaccine work variants, still wear mask, still avoid crowds... extreme amount caution likely raising concerns it.

For them- best clear, simple message: vaccines work, get it, go back normal life. That's strongest selling point offer get us top herd immunity.  say let idiots wear mask get vaccinated. Darwinism finest right there. phone faster using Thai simcard rural Thailand ever literally anywhere US.  this... piece cloth face much burden majesty stay fuck home. Thank you! Thank you!  cynical incredibly mark. went Walmart today fairly poor uneducated area states. 95% people still wearing masks store. anything people need take eventually get rid them. 132 270 million. like odds. Mask off.   Washington Post today story couple died. immunized three weeks think first dose local production Oxford vaccine. Serious question:  put ""under Biden""? really want vaccinated, believe politics keeping vaccinated, unnecessarily politicize lead in? 5 thousand people America far died vaccine. Let's run familiar theme back.. ""it's 5 thousand"" biggie. Remind 48 hours, damn matter though? They’ll hurting themselves.  Americans economically stanchioned rest world. worlds goverments stop supporting america way shape form. That’s cool. People free mask quarantine want. hell lol?????? matter? family vaccinated, really matter? God damn political bullshit. think individual assessment important thing note. 

I'm fully vaccinated state plummeting active cases ever decreasing daily new infected that's already 150 feel perfectly safe following CDCs suggestion start moving away masking fully vaccinated 

Someone Florida logged 2400 new cases might feel safe pulling trigger yet that's perfectly valid think think ending mask mandate us. It’s got vaccinated, isolated, took seriously.

Anti vaxxers refuse get specific vaccine simply irrelevant. consider world now. Lol people say follow science CDC don’t agree... Thank answering question, though quite way intended. soon request proof medical information make decision based that, opens doors ADA lawsuits based discrimination. can't require medical proof service dogs mobility scooters reason. remember beginning pandemic, place employment telling allowed wear mask work. wish banned prohibited wearing mask future. concern CDC’s announcement. want all. want all. want all. want now. Thank much, kind stranger. ton respect professionals. hard turn message, clearly science evolved. Wish government could follow facts versus dig pander.

Can imagine going congress one week prior opposite message. CDC swallowed pride this. Virgin Liar: “ye... yeah I’m vaccinated! I’m safe”

The Chad Truther: “no I’m vaccinated, gonna it?”  Wales older population England well Scotland NI, allocated doses UK going age groups. Also take pinch salt, believe saw somewhere Wales stockpiling many doses rest UK, case sudden drop supply. Social distancing important wearing mask. Masks social distancing possible. 

And one want go businesses needing wear mask. Meaning get people come establishments. 50% population gotten first doses. time start loosening restrictions. people like stay home.  think states trouble enforcing compliance. would one thing vague, President Biden TV issuing statement safe, CDC issued guidance. 

While governors local authority, exactly mean based anything reasonable. I'm sorry single source. would monster compilation news articles FB posts. xheduling system actually went 6 weeks. 2-3 weeks operationally. got six week figure personal experience. 

The whole 'get vaccinated' experience got complicated fast California. family friends spanning 3 different counties different eligibility tiers. 

It got insane. counties varying numbers locations available. teachers got 10 percent set-aside ( 87% Mt. Diablo school district Kaiser Permanente, sending tailspin). Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda SF counties opened eligibiilty tiers differing times. private hospitals got locked second shipment vaccine taking long inappropriately distributing first shipment. 

I watched daily. advantage one people transcribing health officer reports. personally snagged elderly people afraid things online registered myself.  Contra Costa extremely aggressive vaccination efforts. knew people eligible neighboring county, worked CC, eligible called (they know).  Coworkers lived 25 min drive away (but across county lines) parents get appointment. Well overnight became resident Contra Costa....when somebody gets around auditing system efficiency, gov entities do, going find whole bunch two bedroom homes 10+ occupants. 

The rollout vaccines bumpy stressful. places enough personnel open sites places outright receive shots promised. One thing clear. need detailed emergency plan place, playbook, handle next pandemic. Santa Clara County struggled horribly this. never let happen again.   get severe COVID fully vaccinated, that's fates way saying time go. refuse live fear anymore. I'm ready go back normal, normal includes masks. People lie?!?! reach herd immunity, control smaller outbreaks. company implement delay get newly vaccinated people immunity implementing masks policy? clear point company on-site vaccination set up. say thank people know lying listening Fauci, great vaccine works. won’t able hold back crack. Overlap people wearing mask (or incorrectly) vs. people never planning getting vaccine? Nearly 100%. really change anything. 'Simple' sounds right. Seems reasonable. people got vaccinated played rules year punished others lying? That’s happens. find difficult imagine 60% people drive country license, whereas 2/3 America right fully vaccinated. mention, something stupid without license, go jail. one's gonna go jail wearing mask one's ever gonna find out.

To counter point then, get rid driver's licenses since people drive without one? Like ""I license care someone else drives without one since know I'm obeying rules"" work here. "
