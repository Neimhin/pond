It’s easy rule. Move New Brunswick Delta starting take hold US. Israel thought close done considering reimplementing lockdown mask mandates. UK thought close done, delta variant 90%+ new cases expecting hit 50,000 new cases per day mid July. CDC tracking breakthrough infections May 1st, know effective vaccines preventing infection result hospitalization. Realistically could still contract delta spread others even symptomatic. still want go around claiming deaths amongst willfully unvaccinated population recipients award named English scientist first posited Theory Evolution, unfortunately sticking name next word ""award"" triggers automod ban comment along ""civility"" grounds. Dude specifically mentioned Israel though…. I've enjoyed getting cold strep past year, right enjoying subdued seasonal allergies. Plus fully trust over. next couple weeks Ford lifts mask mandate

This good news! heard mentioning lifting mask mandates removing capacity restrictions. hear this? Oh, I'm well aware. I'm(selfishly) worried little Texan whose school longer allowed require masks.  Lots restaurants strip malls suburbs patio seating. drive eat outside. covidless world pure utopia. Flu never stopped existing. Covid came stay.

I part took measures protect myself. got vaccinated. want see people's faces refuse keep wearing masks. 

If try force vaccinated people wear masks, I'm afraid things get ugly. Enough masks got vaccinated.

Those still vaccinated, means, keep wearing get vaccinated.

If guys want people take jab, stop giving reasons take jab. point taking vaccines help things come back normal something close it. nothing changes, there's point taking vaccine.

In fact, I'm worried I've seen lot friends saying take vaccine they're reading articles saying people still wear masks. Stop that, please. difference though one vaccinated earlier lockdowns. people shots I'm willing bet lot less comply new restrictions defenitly make feel like take risks least. say one nearly many Thanks. Really wanted check reassess risk. That's right answer. also far far countries struggling even get vaccines can't afford kind delusion incredible.  Basically getting everyone vaccinated soon possible best chance beat virus. rate time boosters Delta they'll run Greek letters moved Klingon. Looks like pandemic essentially restart square one winter virtually zero immunity whatever variant dominant then. important note CDC also longer tracking breakthrough infections May 1st. means get good gauge well vaccines protect delta variant infection. wouldn’t know. let subscription expire.  “our fastest iPhone yet” think alarmists grasping children newborns vaccinated. Almost feels like we're taking vaccines point crazy shot vaccine rankings fast ""This picture younger.

Maaaaan every picture younger.""

RIP Yeah. Using umbrella raining ""help protect"" shins getting wet **as much** ""helps protect"" hair same, *nothing*. 

I know people seriously mean say ""it's 100% least good option, worthless,"" way talk sometimes sure try hard *not* imply much. everyone 100% rational pure logic reason, mess begin with. “Many new Covid-19 cases among vaccinated people, according Ynet news service. Last Friday, 55% newly infected vaccinated, website said. July 4, 35 serious cases coronavirus population 9.3 million, compared 21 June 19.” 19.[Half new cases vaccinated  Yeah that's variants created allowing virus evolve real time among infected. Shutting transmission rates via vaccination cuts off.

Vaccination path currently know rely ton people dying unnecessarily creating bunch new variants along way (some probably immune current effective vaccines yay!) Anyone dying point opportunity vaccinated decided it. literally chose dying taking 15 mins 2 days month get small shot. I’m way late party, wanted know read comment absolutely right thing.   unironically great time queuing AZ. volunteers lovely, like Glastonbury. Someone record player queue.  good. vast majority vaccinated people wont catch covid. vast majority get break cases reporting cold like symptoms. Eh, vastly different big overstatement. use different ingredients make lipids keep mRNA safe waiting injected, they're extremely similar. actual impactful mRNA code pretty similar. 

There's decent breakdown here: Holup, there’s *new* Ontario?? Agreed. wear masks recommended wear masks. Since risk levels vary I’m reluctant one-size-fits-all solution. Hey get fuck ""knowledge"" ""facts"". /s  MissionAccomplished.jpg second Moderna shot knocked ass good 24 hours damn happy long term benefit have. One day illness worth able go crowded stadium anytime want worry. Thank caring others!  selection pressure reduced symptoms

I see true. majority people, severe symptoms cause lower mobility (i.e. stay instead going out). Therefore fewer people infected strains/variants cause worst symptoms. Even person dies, they've spread fewer people someone mild symptoms who's offering everyone come contact with. beautiful suburban neighborhoods see movies? dont exist? dont places? point vaccine divide used set us one another. Unless course it’s inner city vaccination hesitancy, it’s fine 

You could vaccinate every human United States wouldn’t stop global evolution virus . It’s like taking drug dealer street . There’s going unvaccinated populations everywhere world there’s also millions vaccinated questionable drugs . 

I agree getting shots single important thing think need take breather That’s polling suggest. People don’t paid sick leave can’t afford miss Self isolating giant mansion done thing earn. great news! Israel getting 64% delta variant from? Meanwhile, many churches US since last year as, hundreds thousands people dying covid US: ""you're sinning living fear trusting God come church without mask let 10 unvaccinated people sing loudly period time."" Or, ""you need vaccine mask think living fear that's sin.""

NY hid thousands deaths IIRC.

If developed countries, transparency tends best, misreport/underreport/hide deaths, yeah, Pakistan shit too. Canada authorized ages including children 5? one hand I'm glad percentage range I've throwing around (86-90ish) confirmed figures doubt country going achieve without forced vaccinations... means final stage herd immunity remaining unvaccinated catching covid. 

Stupid antivaxxers. Exactly. I’m vaccinated, unless know everyone space vaccinated well, I’m willing risk small (but Delta, growing) chance picking something giving someone isn’t able get vaccinated. choose to, they’re pigs. child someone died COVID may ever well enough vaccinated, take responsibility seriously. Honestly, Putin&amp;co massive fools believe low key peddling bullshit Russian news, cheering on/supporting western antivaxxer groups backfire. this, economic mismanagement Putin's actions Karabakh war - seems Putin's image ""genius"" least bit misplaced.  Great news, glad got Pfizer doses. Uh, smallpox existed centuries.

It vaccination actually got control. I’m thinking putting money iron lung manufacturers get ground floor next polio epidemic. 🚀🌛 kinda feels like want vaccine, already got vaccine. know there’s people still getting that’s feels. live Ontario, Canada. originally spacing vaccines 16 weeks apart, supply increasing, rapidly moving people 8 weeks less.

Sadly also even public - 64% number leaked, could context know. Meanwhile UK 88% number 2 doses pfizer vs Delta, separated doses 12 weeks gives broader immunity.

This study mostly aimed Alpha, irrelevant. Indeed, even sequence Delta, know portion study could done wildtype definition Delta specimens relied largely proxy measure aN501Y-/E484K-result mutation screening combination date geographic location,which used infer probable Delta variant specimens.

In short, tells us nothing Delta. Yearly covid boosters going become new normal forever thanks antivax idiots

Well depends well vaccines protect variants. far extremely well.

Supply expected increase significantly next months. Additionally, vaccines currently limited 40 meeting various exceptions (border healthcare workers) due low supply, much vaccine hesitancy vaccine ineligibility. 

While true people afraid AZ due clotting risk, fear shamelessly stoked media outlets rather anti-vax groups, helped slightest mixed messaging Prime Minister state Premiers. fear Pfizer AFAIK.

The idea flu really prevalent either. people take pretty seriously adhered lockdowns, appreciating long periods calm minimal restriction between. significant frustration lockdowns, seems stem fact cases slipping quarantine border workers vaccinated aren't. It’s difficult, still can. They’re “exiled” there’s “national lockdown” NZ. least get basic facts straight. two pfizer doses, symptoms started Thursday, tested positive Friday. definitely 100% effective.

Pretty much told straight up, basically decided get infected. acknowledged thought worth it.

One friend finally got letter vaccination gov apparently must wait October least. Me? letter, schedule, nothing.

Edit: I’m japanese 25% number? compare last fall / earlier year? ""all"" over? Nah, going need six months.

Six months cases really start reduce 1,000 day. hope that's can't parents duped false propaganda. sat teens full risk benefit analysis understand risks covid, Delta variant, ""covid climate"" pros &amp; possible severe side effects vaccine. difficult risk benefit analysis like come favor putting kids classroom unvaccinated. teens gave consent pleased handled decision maturity. data support risking Covid instead risking vaccine effects. vaccine side effect (except anaphylaxis)that can't also result covid infection harder treat result infection.

Like people getting hospitalized, sick unvaccinated. adds herd immunity numbers. We'll get there. Unfortunately lot people going learn hard way vaccine immunity better way go. Yeah, California. numbers _do_ mean, unfortunately, herd immunity impossible.

Using R0 5, (I've seen numbers ranging 5 8), 100% population, right youngest children, would need immunised 80% effective vaccine reach herd immunity.

If vaccines 70%, add anti-vaxxers people can't get medical reasons, means fall well short. tell people there’s vaccine shortage? say certain date we’re shipping rest countries. get take it? It’s disagree you. Biden telling us it’s patriotic duty get vaccinated, seems counter productive find way get fully approved. mean, appealing patriotic duty get us get vaccinated weak. actually something increase doses arms? Otherwise it’s like pretty please, cherry top? Pretty cringey point. really care talking about. thread UK travel. see turnout booster shots goodluck Many countries wear masks flu seasons though, limit spread.

I agree mandate go, hope masking specific virus ""in season"" sticks somewhat, limiting spread. Agreed, zero requirement mutation less deadly, already know delta variant deadly variants. thing new variant become resistant vaccines, world hurt. That’s point, it’s already dangerous enough.  real. 67% state fully vaccinated. Thats huge majority small minority. Even US whole hasnt even hit 50% fully vaxxed...

Also, seems good preventing spread well, ""herd immunity"" pipe dream vaccines?  


Not vaccines (and still think 100% great high risk people), narrative changing pretty quickly here... misunderstanding something?

Can't wear masks forever. known since early maximum transmissibility occurs onset symptoms. share Covid usually sure it. Therefore symptom severity selection pressure. would like getting birth defect things happen parents born.

Severity symptoms appears related mostly age underlying conditions known unknown. random variability thrown in. four major variants concern differ symptoms across broad mostly overlapping range. ""deadly strain"" ""asymptomatic strain"". virus different effects different people based mostly immune system reacts it. Thank you, Japan! ""This it, Mr. Frodo.""

""However, daily average testing past week also almost doubled, result summer holidays starting (an average 60,051.0 tests carried out) positivity rate 1% (down 0.2%).""

All benchmarks also going down, good thing world getting shit together solving covid worldwide would avoid massive financial losses new potentially dangerous new mutations.

A practical even selfish motivation doesnt change fact it. Given every thread ends discussions US, might well give flair everything now... Behaviour could played part first surge, complying covid regulations instance (social distancing, quarantining, masking, etc.)

Show Moderna showing significantly better efficacy 2 doses regards Delta (as 2 dose vaccines), think information exists anywhere shows that. also rather restrictive lockdowns Ontario compared anywhere else NA.

No, core age demographic ruling party voters went first. They're still talking vaccinating health care workers. need phrase life. answers much. coming USA, test quarantine day 5, plus need day 2 8. awhile now. bit expensive. think Netherlands 12-59 group slightly lower 85% end - lot closer 80 85. I’d love wrong though. 71% 12+ right now, beyond next week seems like mainly 2nd doses. Haha sure do, thanks tip. Loosen man control group people get vaccine infected past months. people kind immunity like high antibody levels. led unvaccinated group less new infections monitored time frame would normally expect. since efficacy vaccine calculated difference, high.



Example: Vaccine prevents 8 10 infections. 2 10 people non vaccinated group covid previously, 2 10 infections prevented control group. Difference 6 10 infections prevented: 60% Efficacy. Newest Olympic sport gonna outrunning covid long we've got ~40% refusing vaccination disease variants going keep passed around indefinitely, herd immunity never anywhere close reached. ***Yearly covid boosters going become new normal forever thanks antivax idiots***

This factual truth, sadly.  Good luck dad. Yes, hopefully vaccine helps mild case. 
And f idiots around aren’t vaccinated, this, right reason should. link this? can't find data anywhere. Hopefully one surprised this, obviously point vaccine… Israel pfizer efficacy Delta variant similiar sinovac is, it‘s warning infection had, too. 

But drama sells clicks.  youre saying literally doomed. ask Putin live Russia vaccinated Sputnik soon got chance February. blame government first foremost, absolutely everything fail create mess, think personally every right blame people too.

First, need trust government (I personally consider enemy) know Sputnik safe enough works, enough independent evidence vaccinated people Russia countries like Argentina. jank vaccine. case evidence, checked antibodies level vaccination, family members developed high level antibodies. Second, risks COVID high vaccinating anything obvious choice there's alternative. worst, vaccines useless. COVID killed half million Russians wonder 15% choice.

There cases ""voluntarily compulsory"" vaccinations people pressured vaccinate work, people vaccinate voluntarily.  history repeating mean adults freaking masks worse children wearing anyway and/ causing big scenes everyone dying anyway… yea probably Finland also 12 weeks jabs. need modified mRNA vaccine delta delta+ soon possible, sure dont read news that? thought would ""easy"" modify mRNA new variants like day so, trials going on?

While true mRNA vaccines modified produced quite quickly mini safety trial hit arms, problem lies Delta fast we'd need harsh restrictions contain will. take months vaccinate large swats population say months road different variant pop make whole exercise pointless. 

At billions people around world still waiting vaccines vanilla SARS-CoV-2. 89 people died 20-29 age category UK far YEAR.

Again, sure additional 5k - 10k deaths die next 5 months realistic honest. interesting question is: new (lower) effectiveness hospitalization mean restrictions “natural” “voluntary” restrictions, total hospitalizations grow? 

If doesn’t, seems cause alarm. does, effectiveness isn’t enough even rather well vaccinated population, would worrying likely mean restrictions expected necessary quite longer outbreaks. Right, freedoms work? 

Okay, know choose get random ass moron decided roll it. seriously understand viruses spread that's line thinking. It’s crazy folks strong response others didn’t. Everyone know fine some
Folks say felt like death. fair, “just about” “closer ever” also pretty similar meaning, context Delta vaccine available next month.  Isn’t true vaccinated people also catch pass Covid around? thought vaccine mostly prevented severe symptoms still catch virus pass others regardless vaccine status.  New Zealand? Never heard Thankyou **very** much response :-) Plan: Measures remain until:

1) Vaccination program complete
2) Cases level outbreaks contained test trace contracts bought out. parking spots leased restaurants etc. legislation needs make possible required. Try saying parent child experiences long term complications worse dies result COVID infection. it’s true majority children experience complications, kids immune risk serious live long complications mention fact don’t know long term consequences COVID infection children. also risk child becoming infected COVID vector additional infections worse next mutation blanket statement shouldn’t care children getting infected won’t experience severe case logical fallacy.   also paperwork. People can't bothered paperwork webforms. think honestly accounts lot vaccine hesitancy too. go digging health insurance card. reason people vote. active Covid, actual need sufficient supply. 

Singapore jabbing 1% population day targeting 2/3rds fully vaxxed early next month. Given density reliance international travel, need able open borders restore economic activity. Canada also leaving time two doses. value lowered recently believe 8 16 weeks. study expansive, I'm wondering end seeing data future pointing vaccines actually working better using longer span time two shots, opposed Israel inoculating standard rate 21 days shots. Yeah give 1 year old covid test horrible, brave, 2 much worse, hysterical . Thankfully came back negative able go back nursery. (Scotland). stalled everywhere. Selfish people. Unvaccinated people dont 0% protection infection. case would billions cases. Humans something called immune system. narrative presenting simply false. getting confrontational? 

Oh, person 1 makes comment, person 2 steps disagree, person 1 replies back, that's called ""getting confrontational""?  Classic Reddit.  Even surgical mask, long Japanese wearing would hold similar transmission blocking effect wearing N95s Good thing profile international community events high profile people massive networks supporters members sport together , could imagine mess world athletes catching strain something spreading amongst athletes fly home share many fans supporters happy see congratulate success. mention potential international fans attendance ? 


It'd like scene horror movie unbelievable oversight security safety. around country. Outdoor dining, liveable streets, drinking public moderation, less cars city centers, etc. look graph pretty much flat now. Correct. referring 250k AZ batch blocked less 3% total doses used Australia.  difficulty taking numbers face value control things like known prior infections, % vaccinated area, age, health, order draw conclusions them. might also worth compare current hospitalization rates typical seasonal influenza get sense much worse problem now. compare hospitalization numbers back December last year. interesting question is: new (lower) effectiveness hospitalization mean restrictions “natural” “voluntary” restrictions, total hospitalizations grow? 

UK here: yes. past month so, hospitalisations become slightly double (admissions tripled since trough). still restrictions place, mainly designed stop super spreading events.

However, important thing overall hospital numbers remain low, deaths tiny fraction (less 10% alpha peak, according one unqualified statistician called paenusbreth). UK, opinion government restrictions lifted, overall threat NHS low virus cause deaths overall. still yet see we'll come winter. Contrary fools gallery, wearing well fitted mask effect oxygen levels whatsoever - big denier selling point turned people wearing them. I'm asthmatic worn P3 double filter half-face resprator since beginning, February 2020 precise, anything breathing clean air car fumes aftershave, deodorants, perfumes, etc, help asthma calm down. realise general public wearing N95s Japan?  I'll pissed lift mask mandate kids get vaccinated. think that's fair them. opportunity attend camp also avoid COVID. would love wear mask, over, may well part wear it. easy thing do. reason still dragging people refuse wear it.  People cancelling holidays too... Also, slow crawl vaccination super frustrating everyone... Antivaxxers see personal challenge. vaccine 100% effective still catch COVID vaccinated (but chances severe case extremely low). ideal world you’re vaccinated wouldn’t need wear mask unvaccinated would continue vaccinated know past year large percentage population doesn’t care. continue wear mask public indoors even though fully vaccinated simply can’t trust fellow Americans right thing. open border EU visit family. UK: Hold beer UKs mask mandate seething shitstorm this, that. never clear messaging population use mask correctly masks offer protection wearer people. N95s could stopped mess last September government mandated use things actual work. I'm kansai perhaps things different are. Serious question, covid death rate UK first came would sub even exist? Honestly, think would ignored it. Like now.  I'm Canadian well (YVR, BC) many differences Canada, Israel, UK, USA. Every country rolled continues roll vaccines differently vaccine hesitancy different. 

We shall see autumn happens data shows us.  


BC crushing Covid right 36% 12+ year olds fully vaccinated. 78% first doses. 87 cases past 3 days. That's 29 new cases day. Everything continues trend down, uptick since peak April. would think restrictions lifting see slight uptick nada. scientific sense, ""mild"" means require hospitalisation. intense fever life, severe fatigue brain like scrambled eggs, long lungs ok symptoms gone week, that's classified ""mild"".

In statistical sense, much point drawing distinction someone losing smell week. need stay home fortnight recover away everyone else.  realise we've mask mandates like year UK?  Playing devil's advocate teachers students masking schools? School US teacher wore masks year, district may wear next fall.

Vacinated teachers also need quartine come contact covid, unless show symptoms test positivite. general worked worst periods pandemic. total 14k deaths, thousand, that's still 100k like here. applies vaccines part national incoluation campaign though. took AZ J&amp;J somewhere, would subject rules.  shreds say, oh my.    add statistics that. UK wave since May. Yesterday, 9 deaths.

It also said even restrictions, amount deaths anticipated less bad flu year. Time open travel fully vaccinated.. Considering us wealthy nations hogging vaccines, ""99% world"" get back normal. would Japanese model incredibly low vaccination high cases anyway progress pandemic due low numbers caught leaving horrifically exposed wave delta? model? want us follow fucking model? actually dumb? Understandable, looked depth that. said, adopting Japanese style mask wearing mandate. They've little 1k deaths, unemployment 2.3% economy tatters simply people want wear flimsy bit cloth faces. tell masks work, look Japanese figures yourself. BBC news, general they'll tell masses whatever current government wants push agenda-wise. Deaths dropped, hospitalisations, I've pointed people still going suffer needlessly physically, mentally, materially without Japanese style shift towards masks. could also mentioned positivity Rate Last 7 days 1.0%, week 1.1%. source above. again, countries actually reached 70% coverage adult population. may close, certainly European thing. fun isolating entire world next decade then!

Covid can't eradicated, way covid stay closed forever. See thing disagree article, plan? Like seriously, guys actually want restrictions permanent? assume not... UK vulnerable fully vaccinated, 86% adults first dose reaching point cant find people get vaccine, reopen summer, would we?

At certain point ask alternative is? Similarly asked lockdown alternative threatened overwhelmed NHS.

You need plan. ears here. massive fuck Aus government. Perhaps worst history. dealt harshly next election. UK, case numbers basically sometime early winter, deaths barely risen. anyone done analysis is? time lag numbers taken new variant really mild? getting confrontational? Basically said voting.

**This wave UK started relaxation rules. shows always waves.
-- Restrictions supposed completely relaxed 23rd June. delayed 19th July. People allowed eat inside restaurants 17th May. Cases already started rapidly rise then.
[Ease regards last point, we're basically saying thing! Mild clinical sense means require constant medical attention. Severe covid means intubation constant monitoring. Moderate like need hospital bed case turn severe. (I think less correct I'm wrong means correct me) see “only” around 60% vaccinated (of total pop., 18+). Unsure demographics look like e.g young means higher vaccination rate adults not, Israel longer great outlier vaccination rate. effort seems stalled? Ontario Israel encounter Delta around timeline? Italy bit lower, hoovering around 64/65% adult population; doses administered especially second doses. I'd surprised Italy reached 70% total population (doesn't make much sense talking adult population, kids get covid well). Technically 40s get AstraZeneca based personal choice reaching GP. Eh, think Israel's current numbers affected fact like 30% young population 18 ineligible vaccines quite time.  Ok sounds like issue self isolation requirements rather Covid itself? article actually provides interesting data disruptive effect latest wave schools quite balanced way actually read article.

What's alternative loosening restrictions? suggestion wait Covid completely eliminated? delta variant that's simply going happen threshold herd immunity achievable via vaccination due high R number. Well, read enough comments people got wrong end stick ""let's wait see happens"" Ducth approach. There's point need accept countries better things. know difficult Dutch accept that, self-criticism national trait. nervous return normal

Well, say, looks like we're run experiment we'll see.

But, keep saying seems difficult get through, 'everyone'. I'm sure there's great many people quite happily back crowded bars helping us 200,000 daily infections fine. Indeed that's I'm counting scenario.

The issue percentage people people return 'hospitality' infections running 200,000 day greater profit margin 'hospitality'. order 10 barrels beer expect we're returning normal sell 8 expiry date **just** 20% customers stayed away made loss.

Maybe used business, first x customers give x/y profit, cover fixed costs - don't, last y-x make profit. 

I'll give odds Johnson begging people return pubs mid-August, haven’t it’s costly it’s better use vaccines administer quickly possible. science won’t show answers. matter studies today, situation far variants go different time trials trials began. 

As far Canada doing, population could end ultimately better protected long run, risk leave individuals partially protected lengthy duration. Many people caught Covid waiting second dose. Nobody really quantify aggregate risk whether strategy left better off, worse off, same. I'm sure many people aware this, even California locked mandatory mask mandate.

It's Texas Florida thing Duh Tour de France technically biggest spectator event France, spectators scattered along hundreds km roads outside 1 month, I'd say kinda safe covid. Seems like additional vaccine doses better solution giving up. CDC focused public policy; personal safety. 

As far concerned, long hospitalizations staying down, isn’t reason people wear masks. CDC doesn’t care potential long term/long haul symptoms people mild cases develop. wave UK started relaxation rules. shows always waves.

Source: trust bro. nothing unless want go full lockdown every 3/4 months allow people leave home. 

How starting use propper hygiene, washing hands constantly, wearing mouth/nose covering whenever KNOW symptoms vote agree nice I'm saying truth.

False, I'm petty.


Nice strawman fallacy right sum three quotes btw. mean finish line?

I mean like long distance runner finally sees finish line approaching, lower speed start celebrating early; get defeated person would've gotten second place fool slowed prematurely kept running crossing finish line. US getting left behind.

The US always behind basically everything; enjoy obnoxiously boasting moaning always hero, constantly behaving like selfish self-serving schoolyard bully. awful people still waiting vaccines can't get them. time surprised. 

I got first (back super rare) second shot centres even though important meeting work issues: 

\- get second appointment 6 weeks advance cannot cancel postpone 
\- stood line 1.5 hours got shot + 15 Min waiting time (the 2nd shot somehow managed far less efficient first one took 30 min total) 
\- super far away city centre hassle car  
\- offered second dose 2 doctors nearby doctor work would faster efficient

I making excuses no-shows, trying offer explanation. I'm considering moving back Ireland now... can't afford probably quite time, even matter. harm already done.  Face masks shit. Especially everyone using multiple times. understand fandom masks subreddit. good vaccine uptake

Israel lot vaccine hesitancy. They're currently 62% one dose 57% fully vaccinated. Better US 55% 47% respectively, still nowhere close herd immunity. 


(Data ) I’m wearing mine. 

I don’t trust unvaccinated people wear masks don’t desire get even asymptomatic case COVID, due long term side effects people developing. 

We’re still even 2 years &amp; disease changing symptoms &amp; severity. I’d rather wear cloth face develop something serious years now.   viewing sure case vaccines? Might UK mostly uses vector based vaccines (astrazeneca), alot Work modify new Variants, Heard, mRNA vaccines easier modify new Variants. Vacations main reason increase tests Currently Korea, confirm. vaccination clinics everywhere Seoul, commonly used search engines map apps way get waiting list unused vaccines end day. Drop million doses country today, guarantee people lining outside clinics 24/7. Look recent studies percentage people developing long term side effects asymptotic, mild, moderate COVID. 

It’s avoiding hospitalization; it’s avoiding long term organ &amp;/or neurological damage. Exactly supposed know vaccines haven’t even around full year yet? Time tell protects vast majority people long Covid too. true. best thing vaccination, fully vaccinated, course letting fully vaccinated people logical things do.

Just like many countries already diseases one vaccinated. even exponential growth cases, cases never lead kind pressure ICUs we’ve experienced before. 
 
But claim baseless. 
Triage past Covid waves 3-5x hospital capacity European countries. springs wave eventually became suppressed restrictions spring weather (and spring food). selfish. Nearly relatives refuse get vaccine. believe misinformation rumors receive thier whatsapp. call naive believing existence conspiracy behind Covid. Accidentally commented wrong post, thx anyways hehe perspective, people country aren’t hygienic. You’d encounter people spitting streets, sneezing, coughing without properly covering mouths. Masks help lot parts world. Outdoor public spaces aren’t safe every community. better societies, guess would much lower risk. ""The approval administration vaccine endorsed managed NSW Health Sydney Local Health District,"" said.

""Acknowledging College determine vaccination priority, welcomed opportunity offer vaccine students given approvals provided.""  Pure speculation time. long covid 5 months. sucked, recovered living normal life. experience anecdotal, majority people long covid recover IIRC virologists believe much less harmful distant future, almost everyone bit contact virus one way (vaccination, also breathing small doses). problem next noone immune response initially, kind like remote tribe native people settlers arrive. continue change time. chest infection developed fatigue syndrome 4 months. ballache. still, nothing else do, better death plow wait slow recovery care anymore, we'll read history books 10 years now. tell rules I'll give fuck playing games smoking weed comfort home  bag white power power   

KKK*etamine* ? Thank detailed explanation. makes sense egoistically gives hope see New Zealand 2023 planning. Canada we're without trials. love see it.

Pfizer/Moderna hybrid here. really doubt US. Maybe low vaccinated areas strict states (I’m assuming we’re talking US here). However I’m gonna hedge bet say governments low vaccinated areas actually don’t give shit won’t reinstate policies (we’re gonna find that’s gonna good decision not) UK found vaccine worked delta alpha - odd different feedback Sure. I'll change it.

The ""our order"" ""our vaccines"" vulnerable (50+) fully vaccinated though even 40+ actually. Everyone else's one two shots bonus children Liberal party donors get looked after. Yeah, great vaccination rate Cali, us much. There’s reason life expectancy much higher West. hospitalizations deaths COVID remain flat

That’s true. We’re seeing 20-30% hospitalization increases multiple locations. True, said ""our"" debatable word. assume doses Australia's EU's, less imply ""EU bad"".

But yes, agree, nitpick guess. point pretty much everyone eligible vaccine (only 70% population 16 older therefore eligible long time) wants vaccine (some religious groups decline them) given least one dose, that's number vaccinations plateaued. However, month ago, started vaccinating younger people starting age 12 well recently direct recommendation vaccinate age group well, progress next weeks (as already seen past two weeks so). However, probably still push numbers 70%, simply Israel young. live Florida what's 'round anything like what's 'round please please please avoid getting close enough anyone public know push shove them, way likely get sick get shot I'd prefer avoid continue alive schtick, kinda prerequisite happy life deserve it. Take care enjoy please Study efficacy safety Pfizer vaccine &lt;12s beginning. Results expected possibly September. &lt;12s see lot severe symptoms deaths Covid regardless. I’m assuming post live NZ.. residents generally accepting approach? Either way, NZ one success stories covid management. Would absolute tragedy levels got infection rates hard hit areas. looks like we’re actually seeing hospitalization surge low vaccinated areas… expect see mandatory masking even social distancing closures return areas? Downvoting citing scientific study see sub nutty ever   even know third dose option. I'd take dose month that's took. Incidentally, lots places already use strategy like deal measles. even new untested idea. general idea future traffic light system red, amber green countries based Covid infection rates given time, presence new variants. NZ high levels vaccination Green countries likely allowed without quarantine amber countries might require shorter quarantine negative test delivered, home quarantine. 

But still likely many red countries may change regularly seasons variants. People arriving countries likely still need quarantine, prehaps even unvaccinated allowed full 2 week quarantine. That's situation likely still exist another 3-5 years. 

NZ yet decided strategy follow vaccination campaign done. may mitigation used flu, may elimination, used measles. Neither strategy would involve lockdowns total border closure today. Elimination would require border measures described above, along contact tracing, quarantining positive cases close contacts.  literally work UK used AZ mostly Israel used Pfizer. Maybe difference. Guaranteed you? Lmao fine getting new vaccine everytime considerably dangerous variant comes along :)     let rephrase it. wait Pfizer safely wait it. Glad did. point would lost much life basically gain.

A single shot inefficient delta. giving people immunity dominant variant ""basically gain?""  think people want Zero COVID, it’s simply going happen. Even Australia New Zealand open do, virus waiting them.

And long COVID? worthless metric know somebody suffering long term COVID would suggest worthless metric UK, there's similar debate country answer always is: well, wait every willing person medically eligible vaccination offered full vaccination (plus standard 7 14 days, depending brand, takes build immunity second dose). one day more, one day less.

Open that, putting unwilling people risk offered vaccine. Open that, protecting people willingly decided want protection (or people can't protected, e.g. they're children 2 seems plan approve vaccines now).

Also, important note Israel fully vaxxed longer. Antibodies wane, rely memory cells. cause seemingly sterilizing immunity wane well, fear! many studies recently pointed robust memory cell response, may long term immunity severe illness also able fight virus quicker lowering viral load allowing virus shed much, lower transmission rates within community.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide I'm glad granddad okay, got lucky. post previous comments read anti-vax, want point readers healthy lifestyle protect covid. all, absolute worst case scenario get mildly ill, best case even exposure still protected, there's zero reason fully live life.  careful hurricanes though are. specific choice wait see played countries need vaccinate since really cases. example New Zealand extra cautious safe opposed disorganized. don’t know much one, look forward finding n=1 successful!! Sending dad good vibes 

RemindMe! One month dont get it, months ago general vibe Australia happy delayed roll-out flipped media angry politicians delayed roll out. mean basically closing country costing money? Seems like penny wise, pound foolish choice me. wearing one doesn’t protect or, importantly, children. Especially almost one else wearing one. That’s case almost everywhere around here. Maybe 1 50 people wearing one grocery store.  Yikes, makes even less sense then. Negative, specifically waited see would go nations. could would totally isolate example knew classmate flu certain point vaccines genuinely hysterical approach whatever Ah ok, nuanced caring staying alive. figured.   We’re sorry wealthy, connected students got vaccines intended vulnerable less wealthy less connected First Nation Australians.

It’s appalling. blatant? look article title. read quote pasted above, referenced, also read article itself. None references commenter posted, I'm sure reading article supposed help. bit strange question - orthopedist wants give cortisone injection shoulder. I'm fully vaxxed tough time getting comfortable return normal week. 

Is reason believe cortisone injection would impact vaccines effectiveness me? know stuff works. definitely never car highway, setting much likely die due fellow american's idiots

No disagreement here.

With COVID many still unknowns especially around variants I'm way limiting day day life feel indoors unknown people shopping mask easy way limit risk one things individual control comes COVID. Thank goodness every 15+ person get vaccinated now. 

Last year, Netherlands almost open now, hardly infections - tell dangerous delta variant is. hope everyone stay vigilant get vaccinated. Certainly looking way. also important note vaccines target part virus essential activity meaning upper limit much vaccine evasion possible.

If spike protein changes drastically longer function virus cannot enter cells, thus loosing infectious ness. 

So equillibrium evasion vaccines. Didn’t realize UK formally annexed Slag Isles initial supply come US restricted exports country.   initial Pfizer shipments came Europe example.  good planning Canada's part securing orders manufacturers bases covered.  sure US would involved early ordering process.   US made sure covered first started allow vaccine go elsewhere. Asking citations long covid complications children time seems bit uninformed. duty bring scratch slept stone 12 months. Don’t look article titles. text scroll scientific evidence supporting theory coronavirus escaped Chinese lab, recent studies suggest virus evolved nature, group scientists wrote Lancet Monday. authors researchers February 2020 dismissed lab leak idea conspiracy theory.

And linked article Lancet speculation, essential determine SARS-CoV-2 reached humans

to I'd say let us see actual data instead hiding science stuff important add context cases rising exponentially UK. Whilst agree deaths low, cases doubling almost weekly.... means deaths rise.

Will rise proportional cases? doubt it. Probably slightly less proportional, due vaccine protection severe disease improving every day people double vaccinated + 3 weeks.

And excess deaths skewed lost lot people early.  Fear mongering control masses. Get vaccinated live life normally again.  Well crisis never ends, ever. sound like lockdown all.

I agree. 16 concept risk really off.

I'm afraid dying. I'm afraid getting sick, losing sense taste smell, fever, possibly long covid. Ohhh Cmoon man, heck! closing remarks end article especially enlightening. see people convinced get vaccine. harder people try, harder dig heels in. live county st 33% now. coworkers gotten getting it. 

(And yes understand choice make - worried mutations occurring population vaccinated, mutations different enough infect get vaccinated). Yes. from?  easy afraid disease variants able work office job home. Thank AZ matter It’s travesty way rare negative events get attention. unpatriotic. want make America strong recover, surely want pandemic end? that? Get vaccinated cowardly pathetic man Boris Johnson is. Pubs opened up, Testen voor Toegang (required access) proven joke. People copy otherss QR code enter without secondary check.

Keep mind mods read every comment instead focus reported ones. refreshing hear someone rational what? small possibility getting harms way? Might well never go outside put position possibly get hurt. Stay inside, safe there. Doesn’t sound like lockdown all.

Also 16 concept risk really off. think break Reddit could healthy you. It’s bit complicated that. Oxford vaccine seen best option years research sars 1 technology mRNA proven point chief health officer federal government wasnt sold tech. It’s conspiracy pal hope approach take non-eu citizens well. waiting since last summer get work visa. getting second dose next week. Hopefully, make things easier people vaccinated can't life discern title trying say vaccine efficacy Delta north 60%

Because media keeps talking ""efficacy"" without clearly stating mean that, Reddit keeps quoting it.

Completely preventing infection, preventing symptomatic mild cases infection, preventing severe disease death different things different numbers attached them.

Talking ""efficacy"" comparing vaccines situations without specifying mean, exactly mean (e.g. ""symptomatic"" quite open different definitions), means nothing.  cope oxygen shortage?

I guess that’s government asked oxygen producers send supplies hospitals dozens die shortages. rebel,” Richmond, 69, said chuckle.

That's problem right there. many people South love word. think calling rebels makes strong cool standing rights.

But rebel purely sake opposing someone like -- *no matter government tells do, I'm going opposite! --* make cool, makes stupid. They're still letting someone else control actions, putting lives risk boot.

What stupid hill die on. It’s Australian variant it’s Peru  nah. flu nothing like COVID. Quacked still get infected pass virus full vaccinations so, open borders fully vaccinated good idea. Studies confirmed people autoimmune diseases still receive high level protection Pfizer vaccine. people claim can't shot simply wrong. contraindication mRNA vaccines alergies components, rare. example chemotherapy contraindication.  think means 30% compared unvaccinated people, still sounds high. flu variants every year. make headline news?

In fairness sometimes whenever new severe strain detected, noise. flu part normal life, years severe strains pop up, vaccines available (and times anyway). H1N1 non-issue vaccine day 1, coronavirus category. Even event true mutation another variant, we've conquered vaccine technology aspect roll new one. We're place time last year. wrong everything try discuss life? Lol stupid reject Moderna. Nerrrrrrrrrrrds!!!!! always wanted come New Zealand visit Lord Rings filming sites. really beautiful country hope honeymoon spot ever get married lol. really hope get chance go one day! still end hospital (even though that's unlikely) rare occasions, even die.

Edit: Also, people infected, faster new variants created, eventually forcing creation new vaccines (luckily, read would easy reuse technology create new vaccine). Exactly, unvaccinated freeloaders might rude awakening. But, don’t care, it’s choice. unvaccinated kids, I’m super concerned them. There's nothing odd creeped creepy behavior. guess I'll reserve thoughts subject another forum. stuck island indefinitely must suck long term.

This ""island"" large people recent past never life traveled farther size birthplace, ever. Humans survive fine without taking vacation 10.000 miles away twice year, surprisingly.

That said, think NZ island somewhat different set options handling pandemic e.g. central europe. British government coming great common sense ideas. aware cases go know chance overrun health system meaning justification restrictions.

Really sensible good shit people would expect it. Well done. ain’t problem base life around reddit lmao, go fun go make friends Underrated comment. oof October 2020, 9 months ago, date sources available. think also something fact USA vested interest getting Canada vaccinated, countries REALLY want border open. weren’t major factor economy might able strike many vaccine deals. Delta dominant strain across Canada now? know Alberta dealing number months already. think study actually least somewhat representative, we've dealing distinct variants countries. Still waiting talking stuff April 2020. hit nail head. longer case.

At start pandemic stupid comparison, thanks vaccinations, brought in-line. need stop afraid cases focus deaths hospitalisations.

There flu variants every year. make headline news? 1.8% mortality rate people, especially younger people aren’t effected badly take chance  Yeah, live New England pandemic us, fooled shit. People lower vaccinated states fooled either, never cared probably never will, too. Yep, they'll delta spikes, again, care. Total curfews first 3 months, partial curfews internal travel bans, 3 week long total curfew again, weekend, nighttime curfews total curfews 18 65 4 days ago. NZ going Moderna? Cost? Can't find news stories it. Seriously? remove whatever comment says political original comment? honest, corona given countries excuse lock borders shut non nationals out. well, inhabitants country hate foreigners. 

Early understood need reduce travel, traffic light nonsence increase costs taking multiple tests (even vaccinated) getting silly now. longer covid, political. No. Humans don’t get sterilizing immunity viruses replicate mucosa Yeah I'm sure kind lockdowns live, sure hell want repeat shit endure am. love think Biden sexual capacity. think something odd that. It’s bit sick. rather annoying earlier spurious claims ""just like flu"" overshadowed fact genuinely like flu going forward vaccines! mRNA vaccines? Sure, vector based vaccines lower efficacy still effective, even mutations. I'm talking AstraZeneca J&amp;J. strain come anyway India Nigeria. vaccinated 86% people even giving one too, else do? Wait little longer reason? Unvaccinated people rude awakening.

If vaccinated, protection. overwhelming majority cases, hospitalizations, deaths unvaccinated people. 

I'm sure vaccinated people fear mongering vaccinated people. protection extremely miniscule possiblity still catch it, spread it, end hospital concern me. I'm going wear mask unless required. goal never eradicate virus, always rather optimistic expectation. need version coronavirus slot among endemic ones linked common cold. Nobody needs care stops legitimate fear complications death; least line expect flu year. Nobody ever seems bothered thousands people die flu year, even H1N1 lockdown, imposition mask wearing, social distancing, etc etc. say UK done nothing it, good vaccination rollout affective though. might want move final colon url outside paren.

I'm sold this. think one booster going knock everyone gets shots. think virus likely circulate among unvaccinated forever though. No. saying every single scientist agrees covid endemic. VACCINATING CHILDREN. So, still following mate, eventually everyone get covid. 

The number children severe small, tiny, minute, judged morally correct give vaccine vaccine actually risk. yes, government plan rightly so. Followed able understand concepts like fact? mean know people planning honeymoon New Zealand 1 month trip. Even vaccinated decent chance still catching COVID. would tens thousands $$$ lost honeymoon destroyed one test positive day leaving.

You everything right, still lose entire vacation. That's big deal lot people. No, 0.84. Check summary page source. Clearly says 0.84. I'd rather lockdowns COVID healthy 16 year old. think idea many old people die covid, yes. die flu, pneumonia, viruses.  Believe science would able live either way mate. That’s truth. It’s easy place get residency all.

Comparing green card process States, even overqualified graduate Master's degree, obtaining residency New Zealand night day. easy fuck, be. I've seen America send back good chunk incredibly well educated competent graduate students trying get residency nightmare incarnate. 

But sure, keep gate keeping lmao. assure psychiatric disorder ADHD. amount deaths anticipated less bad flu year

It's always dangerous equate flu people always believed thing others get violently angry comparison, principle much right thing saying right now. Coronavirus going disappear, point accept yet another endemic infectious disease largely dangerous still refused get vaccine (let's set aside developing countries yet access vaccine now). 

The flu causes thousands thousands deaths normal year, yet nobody bats eye suggests need impose lockdowns control spread. flu easily transmitted, basic concept same. We'll get annual biennial booster shot continue live normally. can't stop existing society virus; viable. Yeah people fail understand making mRNA vaccines simple thing. one thing know make is, entire things facility capable actually making it. simple generic pill paracetamol. biologic. theoretical point, I'd like go someday radar year next. wife go international trips every 4 years so, maybe 2023 covid interfering sort normal travel business pick good location. Yep. I’m honestly sure wrong 2weeks Pfizer doses? Really? That's shortest world. nobody physically stopping getting plane That’s incorrect information.

The 95% number earlier advertised doesn’t extend Delta Delta plus variants. variants efficacy high 70 low 80% range. people would say potential life altering complications (brain, lung, heart damage) 20% chance (1:5 odds) seems pretty high.

“From medical studies new variant: ""If test positive, two doses vaccine one dose 28 days roughly reduces risk admitted hospital 70%,"" told reporters.

Two weeks second dose, Pfizer (PFE.N) BioNTech's vaccine found 79% protection infection Delta variant, compared 92% Alpha variant. Oxford-AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) vaccine, 60% protection Delta compared 73% Netherlands around 500-600 last week, today cases, buckle neighbors!  Also NZ citizen here. You’re generally right saying people “aren’t happy” doesn’t fully reflect vast majority people understand aren’t first get vaccines strongly support govts response far. Shoes American thing. done countries destinations USA.

Belt issue since metal detectors introduced. virus formerly known Covid-19 No, barely got vaccines USA. though pay huge premium vaccines compared rest countries order get sooner.  That's thing, people talk flu like cold, certainly bit worse that. kill thousands every year longer makes news like ordinary traffic accidents make news, they're background noise. That's great. People support DeSantis *love* anything goes “liberal dummies” want. “freedoms” Florida (I dunno freedom reporting covid cases thing though) support gets. 2 weeks Purple Strain! Purple Strain!

I wanted see you 
Bathing purple strain No. idiotic question.

Covid already endemic. going away within next several decades. wonder markets media catch up. Ah, PCR test, explains price. Germany get antigen test [on Amazon 80 real tell 

How they'll feel couple years world moved treating Covid threat need actively mitigate hemorrhage money people continuing restrictions Two weeks waiting two Yeah like said cant travel.  require negative test results arrival? guarantee, course, definitely reduces chances covid case popping up. 

Our kids going overnight camp next month.  twice-daily temperature symptom screening week beforehand (which IMO overkill), kids need negative PCR test 72-48 hours arrival, negative rapid PCR upon check-in, negative second rapid PCR day 5 camp session. Counselors staff quarantine on-site 2 weeks campers arrived staff strongly encouraged vaccinated tested weekly.  feel comfortable situation. thought Reddit, Facebook Thanks US government. I’m solidarity. I’m thankful kids don’t (known moment, least ) underlying conditions I’m still extremely concerned won’t stop concerned able get vaccinated. situation underlines I’m still masking acting sense nothing changed despite vaccinated myself. I’m longer demographic concern, conditions able vaccinated are. listened podcast yesterday interviewed immunologist, said wouldn’t happen. also said viruses tend lose fitness mutate. usually become contagious, yet less harmful. Sigma variant sigma males share you. done help US? understand works. response 'deal it'. Either travel fork money quarantine. choice. forever. there’s “numbers” can’t look bad nation. blatantly doesn’t care Covid base eats up… Win-win England makes 85% UK population overwhelmingly controls UK politics. also basically travel restrictions England rest UK (there minor exceptions). speaking public policy England UK basically synonymous. Oh ya know one, figured particularly bad one. know could get bad recent times lol. hope keep Canadian border closed forever. got 4 million doses one shipment. many people. Ungrateful say least. could sent India. It’s politicians speak talk public… nothing new. mostly unvaccinated 3rd World

This scares me. Ive heard going years world vaccinated. Arent rich countries shooting foot hoarding vaccines preventing open sharing IP? Right? kinda expected approach (…ahem…) another administration, hoping changing guard “head sand” approach would give focus science measurement. 

That said seems huge amount pushback almost apparent sabotaging certain states (looking Florida 👀). 

I personally know people who’ve fight doctors get tested Covid vaccinated - however symptoms. getting number?

CDC 18+ 64.4%

Utah's dashboard 12+ 61.4%  literally densely populated part continent might well saying something like ""LA County fine, LA part locked down"" zero idea means Long Covid symptoms. dunno. popular amusement park Calif past weekend. packed seemed like ones wearing masks (we vaccinated). workers wearing masks. every packed shows line literally one else wearing masks. anything sad scary… may odds ever favor Good idea. Also remember fully protected 2 weeks second dose. long dose NZ make people wait dose? Zürich one, Geneva two (one pediatric), Luzern there's others Switzerland. BBC reported last week 15 pediatric longcovid clinics operating (60) adults: given many millions... sure border open. given countries allowed travel to.  guess coincidence virus started city lab studying Coronaviruses located in. far sensible comment entire thread Well fucked peak, 60+ people rate 450-500 per 100,000 7 day average whilst younger people rate 700-750.

So quite evenly distributed, far pronounced current (40 300 instead 500 750) US thank giving AZ vaccines. funny Canada letting vaccinated Americans Canadians vaccinations way less effective ones American's getting.  I'm surprised downvoted shitter sub usually throws fit someone points complacency ""we community transmission wait vaccines"" keeps biting countries trying ass. Haha, yes garden variety flu, even go doctor, hit like truck kept bed 2 weeks.

You *do* know pandemic flu 1918 killed people WWI, right? globaly decline, vaccines variants taken account. Efficiency going down. leave, really can't. People want get go holiday pay 3k isolation fees take another 2 weeks off. that's everyone. Irrelevant vaccinated recently recovered. That's always important read past headlines...

If probably resolve confusion. LOL Australia New Zealand gave zero help US since began . statement clearly says nothing. Exactly handlers want Nz citizen here. rollout slow people happy it. 

Our economy depends getting people tourism work businesses, need people jabbed happen. Also people like want go overseas see family can't unless immunized, rate going one least October I'm least risk. Scientist often post drafts paper submit peer review publications online archives. drafts subject terms conditions final edited draft paper gets published. lets scientists get around journal's paywall. also defense someone stealing credit work.

The reputable online archive servers filters place prevent unrepeatable sources uploading pre-prints. like peer reviewed journals, online archives equally reputable bad papers occasionally slip cracks. scientist treat preprints much like journal articles. majority idiotic family members proud anti-vaxers. matter time inevitably need bury least one stupidity. Pisses much. dual citizen friends living Japan HK coming U.S. covid vaccine. annoyed U.S. got much vaccine brought areas people want letting expire.

I idea trying say. saying US brought vaccines countries want vaccines? totally unrealistic though, that's happening. whats long covid clinic lol. talk like set every town. getting BS can't leave NZ? leave. residents/citizens get back in, quarantine. There's thing empty beach Mallorca summer. NERDS!!! Finally light long tunnel. Wait able travel countries come back? young man Hostels Europe seemed half Australia me. Seems like traveling country main sport Australia. guys traveling internationally? 

This funny guys can't even admit badly response virus. Everyone would agree already left forgotten sub Yep, headline really ""Evidence continues mount vaccines highly effective delta variant"" Yeah whole North East US well Virginia Maine. going daily lives over. jabs, pfizer 90% effective preventing catching delta covid. single jab 90% effective preventing serious symptoms hospitalisation, 35% effective preventing catching delta covid. People allowed want. might quarantine two weeks return Yeah failure. Locked 5 million people 25 million think great. Denmark New Zealand Canada haha, came gripe two appearing next other. LOL largest city 20 percent population. Meanwhile rest first world back normal. read headline ""Nambla"" variant became concerned! I'm Central Europe go well. Lol Covid case fatality rate 100%. even close. Yeah totally back normal north east US travel around world. Unlike seat belt driving laws, can't mandate ppl get vaccinated.

You absolutely mandate condition schooling employment. already across country. vaccine full FDA approval right many politicians business leaders cater irrational. Except New Zealand small island country middle nowhere. Hawaii great well. Except people come go Hawaii right New Zealand still stuck people allowed out. Previously COVID death metric really simple. corpse test positive COVID? it’s COVID death. 

But sounds like got hit bus shot face, tested positive COVID, you’d STILL end COVID death list. 

That said, even remove COVID recorded deaths, 2020’s deaths still significantly higher normal. Many people avoided medical care pandemic died things proper intervention would prevented. link shows GDP growth March 2020 - March 2021 -2.3%... terrible comparison OECD countries.

NZ quarterly GDP growth positive still far behind western countries like Canada, USA, UK, etc. key concern doubling may stop exponential growth. 20 cases leapfrog 320+ weeks time there's firewall mitigation measures activated. 70.2% people home state Utah received least first dose. Never thought I’d see that. shouldn’t increased number vaccinated people, compared January, keep hospitalizations check? father child underlying condition, life can't go back normal release vaccine age group. Especially new data showing vaccines far less effective preventing infection preventing serious symptoms well cases vaccinated individuals infecting not. September cannot come soon enough me. remember US whole well vaccination rates, certain regions even certain towns laggards various reasons. what's difficult they're refusing get shot despite access &amp; availability. Unlike seat belt driving laws, can't mandate ppl get vaccinated. really tough uphill battle specific areas country. 8 million metro area.

That’s plenty places small pockets infected running small pockets unvaccinated. Same. felt exactly like bad case food poisoning, slightly better nausea vomiting. still unpleasant day. Hr 100 starting 3am till 8 9 pm like 90% feeling better next day. Vaccines work, yes, “we vaccines” correct. Many countries don’t enough vaccines reach herd immunity, disease still kills every min. people talking like already? every country USA Britain Israel. would prefer multiple short outbreaks squashed donin Europe, eugenics lots disabled people fighting get care longcovid clinics. Australia realised covid aerosol yet, seems NZ has. “The “vast majority” deaths occurred winter summer surges confirmed COVID, Rudman said. spring — COVID rates lower many medically vulnerable residents least partially vaccinated — county discovered bigger gaps died COVID versus died COVID” uk get em free did. I'm behavioral health now. anywhere close though Canada land border US distance NZ Australia distance London Moscow.

Australia NZs closest neighbor, European Union actually New Caledonia. can’t visit US driving barring nonessential trips Canada United States, including tourism, remain place least July 21. Thank you!!!! 9% fully vaccinated (Source: Yeah dude, seriously, like conspiracy something. virus know specifically target unvaccinated?!? serve proof man-made nanotech virus built-in AI!

True enough, high vaccination rate. Unfortunately many countries/areas US low vaccination rate, still suffer high hospitalizations deaths. unfortunately vaccinated people suffer too, able access health care things crush sick unvaccinated people.  surprised, vaccine came available, almost drove stl 3+ hours Springfield get one since appts everyday open. .... Welsh required wear masks hospital?  info kids area? Specifically kids 12 can’t vaccinated. Thanks!! dunno got downvoted lol. guess sharing scientific info bad thing. New Zealand appears smarter us. Apart that, also admitting, ""I mind virus using body breeding ground new variants might cause new outbreaks kill millions people worldwide. mind one bit."" Well, financial motivation so. COVID care 20% extra Medicare reimbursement, uninsured COVID patient care reimbursed federal government, could receive $9k cover COVID funeral.

Maybe cynical, think random. CCP investigated found nothing wrong :-/ 8 live thats minimum, higher kinda recommended various aspects pandemic mishandled every country easy say country better country b. vaccine rollout UK amazing death toll terrible. others pointed logistics isolating somewhere like new Zealand difficult somewhere like uk, travel hub, roll roll food supply. 

New Zealand fortunate deal widespread community spread, allows effective track trace (an area UK failed dismally). 

At moment important metric much risk anywhere vaccination rate. 

Paucity vaccine remains biggest hurdle getting everyone vaccinated. 

While endless decisions need carefully examined everywhere looking backwards who's done better helpful. 9% fully vaccinated 14% 1st shot vaccinated. Life normal here. 

People leave country want less flights. rush vaccination country places need more. also planned use vaccinations next order arriving soon.  According know far, emergence variant unaffected vaccine *and* still dangerous us unlikely. vaccines target spike protein virus, virus uses spike protein attach cells. order virus evade vaccines, needs change spike protein, would mean infect us anymore. hear California’s stellar vaccination rate realize rate considerably lopsided towards urban counties (some counties haven’t even cracked 40%) small percentage unvaccinated still translates millions people. Better nothing guess hospital level transmission worldwide untold story. Controlling hospital transmission would saved lives. Yes, ceilings changed. That's key thing vaccinations. We're seeing links spread (which never go away) serious hospitalizations--which often lead death--reduced orders magnitude. 

The good news know ceilings negative impact dropping. I'm sure proof far they've dropped yet. would always contextual sample. guiding light, great news. Canadian sitting waiting room 2nd shot, good news. would take 45 days everyone wearing mask eradicate thing. lets deal forever spend trillions constant vaccine programs instead.  Even though apprecciate place optimism helps liften moods (I facing everything 1st worlders going months current vaccination rates continue) admit place pretty much turned full pro-normalcy.   Far 'nothing', UK huge amount help people around globe, we're shouting it. pipeline:

This precisely we’re accepting it. pissed away year half try stop hopes others would same. Even die roll well… didn’t get D20. 

Masks social distancing going pose end virus early on. went mainstream, little nothing could eradicate entirely. 

So ultimately best thing get vaccine, wear mask it’s deemed appropriate, stop living fearful hope dystopian future give *living* survive.

Edit: Also making blatantly untrue exaggerated claims vaccine harm good stop. It’s people like enable conspiracy theorists, reason don’t 70% vaccination US. **"" flu""** amazing 3 words could easily program someone put danger put life-altering health episode like .

I'm upset virus politicized could great opportunity bring nation together fight common invisible threat .

A part tired upset people part heart breaks wear mask? stay home annual event year? life experience small temporary disruption protect people love?

No one deserves hospital like family horrified today day they'll get news hoping miracle maybe he'll come home .

It's sad avoidable. wish people cared lives way rest us ( mask wearing) . I’d really like believe reports Israel don’t necessarily do. Granted don’t granular information evidence chain infections amongst fully vaccinated spread amongst vaccinated unvaccinated doesn’t bode well. explain Pfizer rushing booster trial though. think knew lowered efficacy report coming. That’s irresponsible, think district headed way too. kids home start school, again. said one kids high risk can’t believe people ok cramming 30 kids classroom masks, seems crazy me. exponential growth important regardless though? That's got lot countries trouble first time around, 20% rise cases tiny first quickly becomes enormous control. everyone dislikes live. It’s baffling people seem forgetting this. ceiling remaining hosts dropping rapidly. ever end? far right? No, everyone else far left. people downplayed Covid saying ""it's flu"" people scoffed notion Covid ""a mere flu"" equally guilty dramatically underestimating influenza.

I said many times, say “it’s flu” somehow manage simultaneously underestimate diseases, mean feat. Totally unnecessary. healthcare workers would leave. Delta going give us headache net years guess.  deeply exhausting. can't deal constant cycle hope dread much longer. know believe anymore risk getting COVID vaccinated point, I'm starting care. hate limbo we're living in, feels like borrowed time. look amount failures, important type failure. Australia's failures big breaches less centralised system relies private sector. NZ MIQ centrally managed government run military, less lapses like security guards relationships travelers, staff becoming friends frequent fliers. Also, ironically fact Australia's quarantine strict leads larger breaches people get desperate.

It's important note Australia halved capacity know control less managed isolation capacity NZ does. Moving away tourism reliable industry would good.  I'd thought would even people like ...95 vaccine cancer something. That's shockingly high honestly. Oh fucks sake. Covid bad, get wrong, bad. people vaccines, footnote. average age death COVID UK 83. average life expectancy 81. think that. Except ebola nowhere near transmissible covid. ""develop disease"" means symptoms. known host SARS-CoV-2 know of. moment evolved spill humans, became human disease.

If another similar coronavirus spills tomorrow, different virus. drinking Nestle canned milk..... actually know someone got vaccine injected asscheek. I'm sure good thing? live, ""hype"" 3rd wave UK variant materialized, killed shit ton people, came within inch overwhelming ICUs... New Zealand extremely vulnerable. lauded low death rates certainly celebrated course. But, achieved putting shutters waiting others take risks investing vaccine development production. made poor slow decisions late ordering. 

If Delta gets past containment measures rip population virtually acquired vaccination-produced immunity. average every study see. We're sitting 80-85% right lol.

Pretty good. thought that, policy team probably thought too. need to, India make vaccines. 

Largest producer vaccines world matter fact  wild sub two articles conflicting information right top other. Breakthrough infections exceedingly rare.

Oh my... 
Anyway... 
 Time year insignificant, matters many hospitalizations compared cases. 
 
Coronavirus seasonal, esp temperate climate zone. 
If country cannot keep R&lt;1,0 offseason restrictions, country open further. Ha, hear ya. We're disagreeing science disease spread all. agree. sounds like might differ opinion human aspect. 

Unlike CDC SAGE, governmental policy factor straight numbers human impact decisions. What's ""easier"" pure science standpoint may easier multi factored implements people behaviour added. Yes. Traits allow organism adapt survive environment (genotype phenotype). Regardless, I’m wondering vaccine “choosing” (the virus different traits) counter vaccine soon render vaccine useless. Lol I’m getting way ahead (and barely remember much AP Biology). regardless, knows? Tourism money know whatm ight scare away tourists? Seeing many floridians caught covid realizing wandering straight epicenter disease.

So hide numbers keep tourists coming , pretend everything fine ... long disney open Florida never want tourists people gladly travel "" happiest place earth ""

I think come COVID we've seen dumb decision making fueled making sure pocketbook hit . Delta, would variant.

Also interesting cases past winter.  It’s voiced lot recently, I’ve thinking lot choosing receive J&amp;J vaccine. came COVID last winter vaccinated March. I’ve anecdotally telling people contracting COVID first two shots. merit joke? science points J&amp;J response Delta variant? 

I feel safe knowing astounding science behind vaccine is. guess I’m starting wonder booster horizon us J&amp;J people. grats breaking mold US paid development vaccines. Go back curling. IHME modelling shows *will* get bad again, particularly under-vaccinated states.

The next year going pretty interesting enter phase pandemic wealthy world declares ""the pandemic **over**!"" pandemic over. would cold tested positive covid would cold gone unnoticed year covid measures suddenly spike summer? Lol. 

Also unsure assume would overwhelmingly asymptomatic. Unless data back up, bold claim make. Considering fact we're dealing new variant.

Everything depended negative covid test recent reports make want know kinds numbers seeing mice adaption model, K417N could observed appear accompany N501Y serial passaged native virus 30 generations P1 infect - delta plus? transmissible mice? literally mostly Australia. gucci bro taking yourself? went school Moderna vacinne co-creator. also went school Reddit creator. Americans Canadians.  Bruh, point 40,828 cases included way less Delta VOC Israel, conducted environment Delta *wasn’t main variant.* it’s useless judge vaccine efficacy Delta, useful Alpha older variants. Thank you. makes lot sense.

If hospitalization rates 0.9-4.8% could bring health care system several countries edge collapse countries, potential rates 0.39-2.06% still seem like huge risk take get rid mild safety measures 2-3 months earlier. Ironically, city that's locked state whose leader opposed lockdowns often ridiculed states 'snap' (3-day) lockdown strategy. refusal follow strategy what's allowed case numbers grow point much longer lockdown become necessary. see article hospital Missouri running ventilators? aren’t UK. surprised friend believes AU vacc hesitant people engages are. instance know someone west AU reckons they're pretty board (west AU is, reckons rest morons flaunting lockdowns) You’re angry situation didn’t even read question.

I’m saying existence serious pandemic increases deaths beyond directly caused pathogen itself.

It’s thing happens many natural disasters. Maybe didn’t get killed hurricane, hurricane took port brings fuel, died couldn’t get gas generator runs critical medical equipment. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ someone understand difference company US soil making vaccine US making it.  People morons. Yep! time talking billions people unlikely occurrences become inevitable. Sorry faced dude. I’ve never thought airborne. Especially church’s choir infection South Korea early on. 

I thought always - airborne, droplets, surfaces. makes sense. 

Why else wearing masks face shields? believe people spitting people’s eyes?

And running - didn’t say masked running breath could spread virus 13 feet?

How could reject entire means transmission? Frustrating. can't risk missing work side effects may experience, instead they'll risk bad case Covid maybe never able work again? people wear masks stay indoors. It’s always way, think flu. vaccine reduces chance 93%. Oh no! hope symptoms stay minor. feel pain entirely…I got first shot January tested positive exactly week later. Great, can't wait see kind abomination turned  know don't, makes feel little better. I'm aware real shitty hill defend, sometimes hard time staying quiet. better comment showed care much automoderator determined civil enough. u  Capitalism hell drug TL;DR: 57% population vaccinated. 55% cases vaccinated. fucking disgusting person, god. kids dying droves? Yeah

When consider many infections completely asymptomatic ones found due mass testing drop sterilizing immunity alarming high-school yearbook quote lol Depends state know BCS thinking locking tourists spiked covid cases there.  That's also variants created so.... wow hell, last week well!!! Efficacy always going lower real world settings clinical trials, clinical trials recruit fairly healthy people report efficacy seronegative individuals alone - real life, likely encounter patients unhealthier preexisting immunity unvaccinated groups may blunt efficacy. UK data maybe reliable seems progressed along delta wave Israel. considering pandemic far rest world new variants spread quickly, I’m perfectly happy continue mask grocery store let everyone else canaries coal mine new variant problematic. know kids even eligible yet right?  US really common cafes upscale restaurants pandemic endemic. Yes, course. jolly well forget thought virus leaving US shores.  mean yeah.

Nothing wrong making outdoor dining normalized available summer fun nice weather it’s also incontrovertible 2008 subprime crisis America’s fault. ever go country responsible AIDS epidemic? Stop adding racist rhetoric. seems forgotten Israel around 200-400 cases daíly. Compare 8000-10000 daily cases. need panic yet. ain't man... ratio unchanged.

If 10,000 cases 100 hospitalizations, ratio cases hospitalizations 100:1.

If numbers double 20,000 cases 200 hospitalizations, ratio cases hospitalizations remains 100:1.

If numbers went 10x, 100,000 cases 100 hospitalizations, ratio would remain 100:1.

You said: le. infections increase factor 1,000, hospitalizations increase factor 1,000. ratio two better now

This true. example, **the ratio change.** Stupid people? Yeah. Sad say bothering much. parts US, climate makes outdoor dining impossible extended periods time. example, Phoenix, average high temperature 30 degrees Celsius May October. Investing heavily restaurant seating may usable half year makes sense business perspective. It’s Really pointless, believe it’s counter intuitive believe pointless argument. Like said, matter spin it, cannot conclude ""a lot"" way, shape form, first, second, AZ, AZ, whatever. mild variant - fewer cases resulting hospitalisation majority people catching vaccinated. difference due vaccine coverage.  cities Brazil actually pretty nice walkable, say Argentinian, know cities look like. 

Give /r/SuburbanHell visit see big part US actually looks like. really possible, desirable. lot restaurants would look empty parking lot street looking like this: I've going maskless I've started wearing Brilliant. I’m getting argument correlation causation. I’d honestly rather wrong. referring ratio two things. one makes wonder EVALI vaping summer. ended blaming vitamin E acetate counterfeit vape cartridges vaping around years issues suddenly sprang nowhere. cases clustered zones like Illinois primarily young people. problem people acting like it’s that’s gonna cause things worse catastrophic loss life. follow CDC guidance, point worrying unknown unknowns. Yeah except flu overwhelm hospital systems entire regions within weeks appearing, so... no. accept argument continuing masks certain areas supermarkets public transport can't accept restrictions activities. Covid forever can't suck fun life. vaccinated susceptible Delta vanilla, one would expect true developed antibodies vanilla you. Absolutely. Almost everyone US acting like covid less half vaccinated. So, like, TX? emergency approval. Final approval come soon ending pointless counter argument. like people dying? mention think could wave colds flu.  That’s think too. me, I’d finding way make happen. Way, way testing cases spreading vaccinated people - often recently vaccinated who've one dose recently second dose, younger people vaccinated yet. cases high, hospitalisations not, vaccines - vaccination programme - working intended to. inevitable we'll learn live virus, we're it.  article prior Delta, Delta+, new Gamma lines emerging. Boosters formulated good reason. 

I hope you’re right, though. May, cdc stopped tracking told vaccinated people worry. think it’s fair say still lot unknowns. 

A year half hiv/aids epidemic, doctors didn’t know would kill you. currently idea long term ramifications exist exposure. fast-tracked vaccines, matter! 🤞🏼  Flu really lightweight disease children tho [He ruffles hair way disarm people get lower guard. also believe disappearance pirates caused global temperature rise? little evidence truly support asymptomatic spread, therefore reason would getting would myself, feel safe without want/need plan new stock reserved kids 12 vaccines delayed approved, otherwise yes - shipping everything countries need.

You wouldn’t sit tanning bed every day, assumption melanoma kills 5% people. avoid dumb shit like getting melanoma terrible.

Getting covid terrible avoid it. everyone two doses vaccine, that’s lockdowns end. wearing mask help reduce risks cats unvaccinated younger family members getting ""mild"" Covid, I'll it. bother much people sit argue day? SURPRISE!!! Less half people vaccinated. definitely small minority. i’m curious question pfizer vaccine well. far there’s numerous conflicting reports vaccines effectiveness delta variant numbers place. Israel saying it’s 70% effective i’ve seen numbers high 88% effective. sure what’s going vaccine got pfizer would probably panic clearly it’s working intended delta.

As far means believe it’s statistical meaning effectiveness. meaning 1000 people normally get covid total population example 95% protection would mean 50 people would get covid instead. 

but yeah wish kind official announcement true efficacy pfizer vaccine delta variant particular. yet another gamble Boris Johnson work, like rest. half population either half jabbed jabbed all, disaster waiting happen. knows, report India people getting fake vaccine? knows going countries big deal. longer necessary according Dr. Fauci people fully vaccinated. said scenario someone getting breakthrough infection + enough viral load infect others ""extremely rare"".  others want wear them, fully support that. I'm making personal decision based trust Dr. Fauci. Perhaps go someplace like Missouri, might consider wearing one. That's wish reported confidence intervals. confidence interval huge (like 45-95%) plausibly due random variation studies. like 62-67% there's likely something else going on. live LA, haven’t worn mask since June 15th.

I'm essentially trying differentiate allergies covid, though fully vaccinated. sounds like might reasonable approach accomplishing this...?   think makes strong case vaccinated kids delaying second dose avoid heart issues. waiting room worst part. Nevermind ""science"" also supports use masks, masks vaccines mutually exclusive. right-wingers turning around way apply people thinking repeating sounds nice surface.

R rate higher 1 delta variant (I’m led believe it’s 8), 250 spread 2000. turn spread 8 people each, you’re looking 16000 new cases.

right. literally makes laugh feel zero sympathy morons refuse vaccine. couple quick questions cant seem find defenitive answer for:

- much percent effectiveness Pfizer vaccine offer agains Delta variant one shot?

- much second

- importantly: say, example, protects 80%. mean exactly? develop symptoms, 80% less intense mean there's 80% chance fine 20% sick possibly hospitalized? always new variants. point draw line, recognize threat society large over, move on.

You’ve gone 1,8 64. 73 people delta variant, 3 people another variant. 64 spread another 8… infection numbers increasing 4-6 weeks agree since hospitalizations happen 7+ days sickness. main concern infections increase example 10 20 fold. Even though relative amount hospitalizations stays quite low, absolute number still become quite high.  Man numbers place. hour ago read article Israel (who inoculating people Pfizer time now) 2 dose vaccine efficacy Delta north 60%, there's studies UK Ontario (where am) saying shot slightly less effective vanilla COVID early variants. many times thing going posted?  Sure, study much reliable real world data /s  Yeah that's kinda weird sick leave [Study 95% CI)

It's life prefer minimize risk much possible that's perfectly okay. least consistent.

But I'm sure likely admit people wear masks planes visiting children thing *vast majority* people do. kinda already recognized noting people's confused reactions earlier mask wearing. 

People different risk tolerances one thing, anything, lack logical consistency laughing rolling eyes people. easy. 100 total cases entire country, 25 Delta variant? Wouldn’t consider 100 / 350,000,000 infected “over”? Actually 20 studies saying Except millions kids age 12 gonna go back school like 6 weeks. wrg, sx nmw blame people though? lived Russia, wouldn’t take vaccine either. way I’d ever trust Russian government’s jank vaccine. wonder 15% choice. people, nothing ever good enough. adults fully vaccinated would good start   What's people? Restrictions lifted one making anyone else take shot. mad people CHOOSING volition take what's deal? aw no, good luck anything like that, I'm downvoted meathead telling somehow preventing others vaccinating wearing mask.

Well whoever says stupid honestly really seen anyone it, maybe someone bitching much like weird.

I'm ""bitching it"", I'm replying people seem imply like wearing masks, means want stop others wearing (as implying).

I don't, keep wearing want to, would care?

Australia really experience pandemic like Europe North America vaccination slow best. Look nice vaccinations picked UK delta wave started. Australia trying best stay zero cases otherwise go extreme measures. There's big middle category antivaxxers vaccine avoiders would get vaccinated unless feel there's reason it. supposed rational, reality, basically nothing people realized simply could remain unvaccinated still follow guidance. Unless there’s way enforce “masks vaccinated,” rules simply ignored. right. worded wrongly, meant opposite increase showing. Considering hospital staff much effort work put last year would rather compare peak ever again. 

However mention, believe become problem hospitalization perspective.  joke. never knew employment bad America. That's pretty crappy benefits tbh ~~Take vaccine! way get back normal!~~

Take vaccine! permanent restrictions keep effective!* Whatever HaHa. read thread? seriously believe money? tell are. source countries playing geopolitical chess. 

So, let's test awareness. countries vax brands actively distributed world? Huh? Tell us. tell us brand purchased AU. tell us going.

Your nation state bigotry unfortunate. 

I doubt change, here's skinny: AstraZenica effectively nonce, failed. AU's sourcing deal stagnant, collapsed relevant time. 

So, AU Zambia? Nodda chance. real world, non weaponry war transpiring. comprehend that? not, we're done. think we’re done lockdown handled? people working home? get furloughed government gives relief?  think yes new variants + I've recently heard 2 people getting covid careful, still wearing masks, fully vaccinated. think necessary outdoors though lower transmission. Everyone live still wears masks go want awkward person looking like I'm spreading disease either. week next last start fully vaxed school starts. matter. I'm talking Europe UK outlier regards quarantine vaxxed Americans point. someone upset getting sympathy plenty countries choose point. UK wants lose leisure tourism due arbitrary rules, oh well, that's call.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel sympathy people wanting visit family friends leisure travel privilege like said, options.  (͡•_ ͡• ) Think *delta* today end day.

Not sure awkward choice words, intentional play words That's great, we're talking UK. pretty dangerous statement mentality.

Some people literally *cannot* get vaccinated disabilities. Assuming someone intentionally getting vaccinated means they're choosing death harmful. literally need people *can* get vaccinated get vaccinated, can't obtain herd immunity without able-bodied people getting board.

We can't get people US that, though. R0 8 (which also likely overestimate anyway) mean pandemic growing.

R0 measure spread completely naive group (meaning one immune) zero mitigations going on. huge chunk people vaccinated and/or previously infected ongoing restrictions, means Reff (the rate actual current spread given factors) nowhere near R0. cousin ""health ambassador"" mega-store. counted people employee screenings. Corporate team came ""corporate business"" screenings. One woman's response tells drag longer needs to. 
 
Cousin: least one dose covid vaccine? 
 
Corporate gal: No. course not. hope didn't. 
 
Cousin: (Learned ignore customer's crazy responses interested women's reasoning) that? 
 
Corporate gal: ""They"" intentionally giving covid vaccinated. Look statistics. Statistics lie. vaccinated getting now. ones hospitalized covid vaccinated. ""They"" infecting people make people get vaccinated."" 
 
Corporate gal could easily believe someone somehow giving covid unvaccinated people unknown purpose could believe vaccine works. borders exiled citizens normal  vaccines mutually exclusive.

You keep repeating defending position tons attacks, yet I've found *one* single comment suggesting case. Surprised herd immunity acceptable talk about. last year half sub really overlooked a) massive numbers asymptomatic untested cases b) benefits natural immunity. virus never presented serious danger people 40 years old. think US broke 10k deaths mark category. you’re putting risk, you’re putting many people risk, don’t want covid.

It’s like you’re saying going skydiving. affects you, doesn’t matter.

By going mingling without vaccinated, potentially spreading virus people, eventually kill someone. 

Hence, it’s important everyone vaccinated. talking about? vaccine transmit person person. That's whole point vaccine virus.Him wearing mask exactly zero effect kids' status immunity.

What wrote makes literally zero sense. wants keep wearing mask let him, affect you. anything, also reduces *your* chance catching something better. can't negate natural immunity herd immunity calculation. consider that, I'd say US closer herd immunity Israel, we've much bigger outbreak substantial vaccination top it. Nah dude. think covid huge risk, need stay home. Let others see covid less risk live normal human life. government doesnt need shut entire economy stop people getting sick. choose get sick tho staying home.

People get protection getting sick getting vaccinated, staying home isolating. Pretty sure Canada surpass US vaccination rates already speak Canada anyone wanted vaccine regardless age done second doses mid-September latest. point, ones want get vaccine left. Meh Lake Ozarks fantastic vacation I'm going continue wear mask. quote last line article we're commenting on, ""It's hard.""  say ""we're near end pandemic!"" also ""this new variant sweeping alarming fast pace 25% cases"" headline keep straight face point? made comment people want stay 5 days I'm saying, options, people. I'm going cry river someone can't go UK want stay room 5 days France Italy right there. freaking Croatia. UK overrated expensive anyway. Brexit vaxx it! Delta variant awesome - get 100k free Delta &amp; United mileage points asymptotically spread ! Yes, we’ve established it’s abnormal (and tragic) many deaths. R number mean? anything whatsoever word “normal” mask going get real covid faster.

Um . . . what? dying pool feces urine drowning lungs take free, life saving medicine.

That dignity. one refused vaccine died covid died dignity. died fools that's remembered. That’s applicable viruses though. Viruses spread person person. means put everyone come contact risk. seeing another human ever viable vast majority people. need give majority whole population protection virus people mingle without putting anyone risk got email vaccination appointment 2 days specified date. email also said please cancel appointment least three days date one cannot make it. course went got shot, understand throws people off, cannot make time short timeframe. cancelling appointment still dick move, though. Already crossed it. comes real world data? vaccinated? Sure matter avoid creating variants here. problems problems. agree though. Put fires can.  breakthrough rate 0.01% vaccines per CDC’s data. Masks nowhere near level efficacy. Undoubtedly. tend fly radar, may much deadlier ones too, kill fast, get chance spread die out. Natural selection favors spread most. ""According ministry, Pfizer vaccine’s effectiveness preventing symptomatic COVID-19 dropped 30 percent 64%, given spread Delta variant. data shows May, strain less prevalent, vaccine 94.3% effective."" Bro, know government hide many doctors family I'm essential power plant worker myself.

It's really comparatively much better places. Again, I'm sure long, maybe deadly wave again, til mostly fine. initial lock downs April 2020 impacted us dude always another scary variant justify lockdowns. mindset, shit literally last infinitely. governments never let go restrictions. even government's job prevent people. getting sick. scared covid stay fuck inside. Michigan entire month June. ate 5 outdoor dining places. turned away 3 places outdoor dining decided allow people use it. 3 normal patios added covid. 5 patios ate people using patio 3 locations. two either dining option busy resturant fathers day.

Any thoughts this? Good thing mystery juice, vaccine. get vaccines time, unless pandemic fades soon, likely need get one. girlfriend immunocompromised, wear mask everywhere go. I'm still going wear one over, keep protected Yes, witnessed 2017. folks like find name exact show. black cast member want covid, go outside pretty simple. let others take risks want take. Yeah, don’t understand fuck celebration about. administration failed meet vaccination goal. delta variant spreading politics going business usual seems. 

Never change, America. 25% many cases? also need remember lot asymptomatic mild cases reported testing widely available. Hospitalizations plateaued well point pandemic. COVID going away ""teeth"" definitely taken virus. vaccines effective variants. know must suck live country many cases deaths. ya always people waiting second doses though….people aren’t fully vaccinated position entirely choice. Yeah bad, definitely wasn’t trying say vaccines weren’t needed. fully vaxxed encouraged everyone know get vaxxed well.   Usually natural immunity brought explain vaccination needed. even comments similar time used similar statement. Based comments figured that's meant. 

Maybe science figured something new remember back natural immunity come people survive think 6 months. hope that's still. fuck cares. want vegetable rest life power you. let human beings live like fucking human beings. normal?  consider Pfizer given first mostly oldest age groups whole Moderna went mainly indigenous people lower age limits sooner.  concern long covid fully understand.

But argument people still dying it. latest 7DA deaths 17 day. country roughly 67m people that's rather low amount far far lower previous figures far deaths risen significantly like before. Ofcourse sad anyone die covid realistically can't stop anyone dying covid unless eradicate it. eradication covid practically Impossible short term. 2 diseases successfully eradicated worldwide covid stay us many many years. best ensure vaccinate people especially vulnerable ensure deaths/hospitlisations remain fairly low levels surge cases. think countries wait till zero covid deaths we'll forever stuck restrictions. particularly bothers yesterday's report Israel almost half serious Delta cases fully vaccinated. also people phobias hospitals/needles unwilling. went got hear woman screaming receiving jab uncle refusing go like hospital environment (will faint). understanding elimination means. permanent solution, point time. Elimination means accepting cases, means repeatedly constantly stamping cases appear. long term, endless process. Eradication permanent removal virus different global strategy. I've ditched outdoors (but pretty much rarely wore outdoors anyway unless mandated crowd). keep indoors everyone bubble fully vaxxed, area reaches 70% fully vaccinated, even then...I definitely keeping eye seasonality uptick Fall Winter, likely wearing indoors still. End pandemic America…..many places still gonna fucked years.  sending doses COVID-19 Canada? still marching on!  Problem virus using unvaccinated people incubation/mutation chambers. Eventually hesitancy going become issue people. We're talking UK. Note R0 slightly less 1 pandemic burns slowly. Depending close 1, could many years. Much faster snuff R0 way less one, rough terms requires immunity rate (positive antibody test) considerably higher 70%. Also note R0 considerably higher Delta variant, therefore requiring correspondingly higher immunity rate. TL;DR: 70% last year's thinking, Delta landed. There’s excuses there’s obstacles. obstacle. 3200 Spread across 10 months doesn’t last long. normal? Heh. got az modern 8 weeks later yesterday considered fully vaccinated. wonder compares (should close) I'm saying, there's ton options vacations Europe UK. feel bad people point want leisure travel American there's way places open us last year. Confidence intervals reason. Basically weirdness associated wide confidence intervals. probably enough sample size get consistent estimates 1st shot Moderna Non-VOC intervals huge (28 - 70) vs. tighter estimates Alpha (80 - 86), Beta/Gamma (63 - 86), even Delta (57 - 82). there's fewer them, maybe we'll better lockdown 2.0 happens. state govts really well lockdowns, track &amp; trace etc.

the things federal govt charge (vaccinations quarantine) disaster. Probably lot harder make message US main vaccine developed Germany. Pfizer manufacturing partner. Though lot science behind Moderna/Pfizer developed University Pennsylvania. good time live New England. Top 6 highest vaccination rate states. Starting tomorrow, Quebec able get second shot least four weeks first, instead 8. Wow idea vaccine effectiveness preventing symptomatic illness fallen far Delta Pfizer. 

Really heading 50% makes crapshoot compared unvaccinated. yes understand efficacy measured “50% time don’t get sick”, rather it’s you’re 50% less likely get sick compared unvaccinated group similar exposure settings. main problem Australia supply Pfizer. blood clotting issues put people AstraZeneca, govt fucked messaging eligible type etc., mess.

but basically everyone wants Pfizer, enough - procurement team fucked deal offered Pfizer last year, Australia bottom list new supply. 

we're gonna getting doses dribs &amp; drabs next weeks. would lot people vaccinated govt fucked procurement badly.  sound so, ignorant. excuse point pandemic besides attempting edgelord case forgot tragic things  vaccines (UK) door 2-3 minutes. centre run local doctors surgeries. couple friends first aid volunteers St John Ambulance, training giving vaccinations mass centres one day week, think one done 500+ far. I’m sorry must stressful  Lol what? know that. doesn’t mean natural immunity doesn’t exist. 

My point is, unvaccinated people get covid either a) die b) gain natural immunity c) unlucky get reinfected 

I get feeling many people misunderstood original comment understanding correctly saying people reporting long term issues Covid lasting longer year? \^\^\^This.\^\^\^

I bet one shiny red overcoat button Delta becomes dominant Ontario see rates drop fair bit. Much seen Israel. good news though immunizations minimizing hospitalizations. Others view differently.  true vaccines dont need used end pandemic, really want last 4 years covid? black plague lasted 4 years well technology wasnt end it.

We vaccines end epidemics pandemics wont mutate infect kill others. vaccines would mean longer pandemic taking lives it. really simple  mean like think saying would like see stabilize. Also, worth, think number cases US start moving up. large enough populations unvaccinated previously COVID still room grow. Time tell. Florida, example, 15800 cases week 11800 cases prior week... think Florida hit bottom begin rise, shall see guess. 

http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid19-data/covid19_data_latest.pdf Yeah! plain Darwinism fucks! predict something right? looking seriously people taking here, 3rd wave would coming soon. reinfected covid even before."
