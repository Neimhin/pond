0,2021-10-04," curious. so? I've lucky. I've one COVID test like idea brain tickle. COVID shots. guess willing test suspect anything. kid know expect, travel health...and cautious Covid entire time. family members lie summer allowed us assume vaccinated say already around days. livid because, yes vaccinated, still delicate state pregnancy. idea Covid would caught somehow would skipped trip known.  got breakthrough case well august getting mine May. mild cough. know - yet. NZ able enjoy lockdowns primarily due geographical isolation, low population, low population density, sealed borders &amp; international travel hub. probably developed country could pull result. 

However, measuring success? Life expectancy? Excess Deaths? lockdown free? NZ's story written yet Delta arrived shores nation largely unvaxxed (and tiny number critical care facilities) could yet shit. know 9-12 months whether NZ - aided abetted factors outlined - comparative success not. fear - hope - (thus far) slow vaccine roll may yet come back haunt them.  viral myocarditis, much cardiac damage occurs due direct viral cytotoxicity, i.e. virus infects cardiomyocytes (heart cells) causes necrosis (kills them). separate inflammation mediated damage see viral myocarditis rare complication vaccination. Firing / Quitting staff also increases percentage. necessarily mean vaccinated. know, I've board health recommendations beginning. But, Fauci saying ""too soon know"" gatherings Christmas outside bounds reality think ridiculous even suggested it. genie bottle now. People going avoid family gatherings stadiums full mostly everyone back living lives. It’s possible parents doctor given Ct value parents test? positive test wouldn’t ordinary doctor go 2 tests. 

In case, negative PCR positive via rapid antigen makes question rapid antigen false positive. small stockpile Binax tests self-administer. haven’t positive would always administer confirmatory test was. second came back negative I’d get PCR confirm, second positive, assume positive.   government snowball hell's chance getting right.

What surprised NZ low vaccination rate. long term health complications? Bronchial Scarring? Sterility?

What people cannot afford regular doctor, need medical exemption? swab use swirled around inch inside nose (I get tested drug store drive swab partner home test). Feels basically like picking boogers nose gross kid. I’d rate ‘mildly weird uncomfortable half minute, zero pain’. Done, moved day, easy. ok see ya see you’re saying think vaccines available us world. Also companies still making vaccines competitively speaking don’t think end goal- although wouldn’t say much initiatives. virus control right restrictions people willing mask up. make sense 800+ deaths 16,000+ record cases. 5% death rate. logical conclusion test people symptoms, missed asymptomatic cases. lucky many antimaskers spreading virus far wide. GA - ...hey wait second.  trusts immune system, even though idea immune system is. No. 

He said it’s early tell pandemic look like 82 days now. 

He didn’t say people *shouldn’t* visit families.  Since OP includes NY teacher, lets stick NY. NY mainly Democratic ""blue"" state. can't argue least 96% took vaccine due forced mandates Democrats resentful too. dislike comment friends much want, even Democrats anti-vaxx.

Case point, BLM NY chapter FOUNDER says he's anti-vaxx vaccinated Covid-19. He's one Democrat, many resentful. get vaccine every six months Same. Got 3rd Moderna shot flattened 48 hours. Speaking one critics, wasn’t thought people shouldn’t stay home 2021 holidays, it’s CDC advice equivalent abstinence sex education. What's alternative brain poking?  Okay shitting pharmacists *at all* mean? Like pharmacists created vaccines or..? kinda agree you. Thin herd stupid.  vaccine probably human factor much effect all. point everything else--travel bans, lockdowns, masks--seem affected much. comforting think understand control virus surge, truth largely beyond control What's goal post going back normal? mean want that, make safe. need take every defense covid. vaccine really good defense, there's everything-proof-shield put pretend virus exist anymore Interesting. experience disadvantaged families, families 1 breadwinner, etc. little smarts perseverance, apply Medicaid jobs - Snap benefits. takes years graduate Gold Card Share Cost, finally HMO like Staywell, Simply, Humana. keep banging door family services give need. 

But ask, keep asking. Otherwise assume want need it. piled work anyone fall cracks spread up. 

A church elder help you. Salvation Army help you. St Vincent De Paul help you. people trained work welfare services - ask. know someone got J&amp;J small community pharmacy. lost confidence jab months later, registered national pharmacy chain, got two-shot Moderna sequence. you, choice.


In meantime, rest us continue 'being careful', ours.   Hello secession, goodbye compliance. I’m genuinely impressed NZ’s overall handling COVID. NSW opportunity contain early outbreaks unfortunately spread got control result. possibly getting that? New Zealand managed maintain zero COVID 18 months restrictions vast majority time. managed much freedom past 18 months country. I'm loss see that's anything extraordinary success even manage quite make finish line completing vaccination program accepting community spread COVID-19 unavoidable. weird true? Especially take account fact without measures virus would spread infect people exponentially. would seen hospital overload September world. think late October/November would make sense. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Sorry I'm celebrating Christmas usual. guys stay covid bunkers. higher % ppl vaxxed Spain, me, parents brother go family Christmas gathering year either. reason? uncle aunt pseudo-hippies refused get vaccine rest family did. want catch Covid they're fucking idiots, want give gf family either. still pointedly avoid family costs, usual?

To fair, still approximately 82 days figure how, doesn’t mean shouldn’t pointedly avoid anyway. ;) makes sense.  Yeahh nice fearmongering dudeski, reality going get covid, endemic, flat doomist. heard Immunologist, saying that, antibodies drop, supposed do, keeping around cause issues, thats important one is, t-cells memory cells help make new antibodies. sayin reason is, always high antibody levels every shot ever blood would turn sludge. got booster AZ. I’m running chances develop harsher Long Covid I’m young 30s fighting 14 months. AMA. Thank you!!  What? Well, two weren’t vaccinated. Though one happened vaccinations available. one, entirely preventable chips fun

What chips exactly? know eating chicken breast broccoli would mean healthier life, right?

And reason dropped 150 lbs, turned unwoded acre back yard raised, veggie gardens, meat local farmers. appreciate looking well being. choice ""remain healthy don't"" maybe. - give activities, experiences, etc require sort closeness (traveling, hugs, playing board games, dating, on) others well activities require wearing made difficult wearing mask (sharing meal, smiling stranger, on) order maybe avoid getting virus easily get vaccine for.

THat's understandable, normal years/experiences, no? Would say 'not normal' remedies precautions would prudent?  prospect earning revenue is, part, got three extremely safe high-quality vaccinations novel pandemic virus record time. nonsense comment. responded 'alive vote' comment make sense... see party politics passive aggressive jab 12 dumdums upvoting it. I'm vaccination people really need chill out.     closer 7 months. got shot back early March heard b cells recognize every variant may come, likely. time, like redditor answered you, seems much worrying right now. thing seniors (which government pays portion healthcare) make 100K afford procedures. Taco Bell worker even afford go doc call sick prove sick. Since truly sick ones treated liars, usually fired mentally challenged person gets distracted 3 orders left make food. goes food/retail/hospitality; know ones ""Heros"" last year. many die heart disease would access procedures talked about. yeah, one anything stop many people STILL free healthcare. save many lives need procedures (every single one them) get it. old rich.  Really? I'm inviting anti-vax nutters family over. Want turkey? Gotta vaccine buddy. Here’s stumper:

Both parents, recently boosted Pfizer (around month ago), took 2 PCR tests separate locations travel screening.

On Friday, Negative (PCR) 
On Saturday, POSITIVE (PCR Rapid NAAT)
On Sunday, Negative (PCR)

Also Sunday, took rapid antigen tests another location also came back Negative.

But Saturday, positive &amp; live them. SO…

I booked 2 tests Saturday.

Test 1: PCR, self administered pharmacy drive thru, Negative.

Test 2: ONE HOUR LATER, tested POSITIVE Binax Abbott Isolate Rapid Antigen test (administered nurse)

SO…three people, multiple types tests, multiple locations, strange results.

To me, makes sense someone test Negative one Positive next. Negative highly sensitive PCR test, Positive 1 hr later rapid antigen test….in area severe community spread &amp; low vaccinations…???

My parents’ Dr told consider Negative. Even tho one first tests came back Positive. 

The folks urgent care place tested positive tell assume I’m positive. Today I’m high risk got monoclonal antibodies. Here’s thing tho: if, wild odds, false positive, means spent 2 hrs closed environment several Covid positive folks masked coughing etc.

I’m baffled think point. Also surprised parents’ dr, who’s usually excellent, advising act negative even tho goes CDC guidelines.

Any smart folks educated take this? Yip, plus make suggestions everyone, vaccinated, young, healthy. Maybe given family vaxxed nobody elderly, immune compromised, unvaccinated nothing gets worse OK gather. Aunt Mary isn’t vaccinated, Dad 80 year old chemo, new baby cousin Jules immune compromised? Different situation. week cousin Jose goes back job nursing home Aunt Kelly goes back office business partner chemo? Vaxxed people transmit non-trivial rate keep spreading around mutations get cracks gets still vulnerable. get people angry unsympathetic unvaccinated don’t care them, still lots people well protected vaccine consider well.    
Rather lashing Fauci starting inconvenient truths, maybe people could consider instead make gatherings safer aftermath less harmful others. get people fed anxious see everyone enjoy themselves, ‘fuck it’ attitude doesn’t help. Maybe feel gonna meet anyhow could take page ‘harm reduction’ put easy safeguards place like home test kits everyone. foreign nation destroy population equivalent Boston… like products, hoax vaccine misinformation manufactured overseas.     allow posts singular individual. includes posts someone hospitalized, dying testing positive. think error, please modmail us.

He said multiple times, including article commenting on, makes criticism asinine. Oh definitely. I'm kinda griping ok still job. I'm touch bitter situation. Initially, determined social distancing indoors something like 12ft original Covid, practical 'normal' living compromised made 6ft eventually figured messaging masks confusing everyone.

To social distance Delta something like 18ft, social distancing gotten short shrift since Delta took over. can't social distance practical way indoors many situations worth pushing. eat healthy exercise regularly, live 95?

“You know, it’s soon tell.”   again, claim grossly uneducated. selfishness thing heart, actions. intention. reason behind something. anyway deleting account adios literally plan already.... (NZer here). still going form lockdown 90% eligible population vaccinated. 10% left go firmly still rollout stage vaccination. access early countries. Probably safe call. people want see kids badly enough they’ll come you, dictate what’s needed see all.

Honestly travel around holidays kids probably best part Christmas 2020. eat healthy exercise regularly, live 95?

**DOCTOR 1: ""You know, soon tell.""**

**DOCTOR 2: ""If that, yes stand much better chance making it, even nothing life guaranteed.""**

u/Windex007 telling can't tell difference re: one two doctors better *effective messaging promoting public health?* I'll even give clue: doctor whose initials AF. interesting. share sentiment wanting maximum protection covid around me. Seeing Moderna data tempting. got 3rd Pfizer dose (booster) days ago. Seems logical think getting 2 Moderna top would help. 

But time, want get kind trouble getting extra doses, even though vaccines huge abundance now.

How handle dose 3 4? (Even though Moderna)

For Pfizer, dose 1 nothing, dose 2 mild, dose 3 pretty rough. him: May 5, protection mild cold. Hospitalization bad would also suck like deal congestion coughing would annoying. assume protection less. words, found much evidence *T cells* mechanisms compensate weak antibody level.

Subjects received vaccine trial gotten 40 percent infections past months subjects received placebo trial got vaccine months later. Pfizer presented data CDC evidence waning immunity asking booster authorization. 

I think CDC looked felt, 40 percent isn’t nothing aren’t exactly driving cliff yet, severe infections also rare accordingly CDC split whether boosters needed younger adults. Usually Covid deniers write articles. Whoa, bold move. I'm it! think she’s going get new one. basically didn’t suggest course action. I’m reading wrote right now. says verbatim, “Another option instead getting another vaccine might wait medications post exposure infections occur. several products currently tested likely fast tracked order get market antiviral.” 

That’s basically PCP said. She’s seeking new one ASAP. There’s nothing message saying look deeper her, try find solution get fully vaccinated, etc.

My mom opinion you, post-exposure antivirals shoukd relying on. wants fully vaxxed, want too. Illinois big Covid surge last year peaked early November...before real cold weather even begins. delta wave peaked September. went around despite PPE; ""and many case patients advanced severe disease.""

This really bode well winter senior facilities--not unless get boosters rolling. Right now, rolling Baltimore County, due inexplicable lag action county health department. Interesting, I've never heard people eligible one dose second. Well we’re already like 65% first dose. Eventually people get second dose hence 70% probably ceiling. people seem going nothing going on.



I think many people realize argument wearing masks, social distancing, opening schools, whether letting people die acceptable. Everyone needs realize third half country ok letting people die go lives like nothing ever happened happening.  everybody family vaccinated. give shit anymore. number naturally go catch COVID find horse de-wormer doesn’t work. surprise listen podcasts....he saying long time. often says ""we riding tiger"". It’s honestly sad one unvaccinated cousin won’t going gathering he’s baby vaccinated Exactly, airline thinks I'm flying employees, reason, passengers. sounds like math error, like lots people counted. two separate mechanisms. Virus particles directly damage kill cardiomyocytes. Inflammation cardiac tissue (in case lymphocytes) cause cardiomyocyte necrosis - however definitive thing. lymphocytic infiltrate cardiac tissue without much damage. I’ve seen heart biopsies. doesn’t really matter experience though - clinically, patients myocarditis following vaccination well clearly different pathogenesis clinical course compared patients myocarditis due Covid. think ""should"" done stop families celebrating holidays together? Back mid August, Israel reported 60% Covid hospitalizations fully vaccinated, mostly elderly got earliest vaccinations. jump started current interest boosters. use Pfizer, happened happen here.

So article nothing new. Waning already demonstrated sufficient put risk people hospital. details Google: ""Israel waning hospitalizations"". idea scientists super geniuses humans dumbest thing come pandemic. plenty normal people work business, teaching, art, etc live amongst us hell lot smarter Fauci. like many also aren't. time ""we"" (groups people) put people pedestal problems happen. holidays important everyone anything everything stop living way past 2 years. Why?  Yeah slightly sore arm, little bit chest pain third time. It’s month luckily it’s resolved. 
 
Still worth it, though wouldn’t take another booster least year, even probably 50mcg less next booster. theoretically provide protection.

However, far seems like neutralizing antibody levels a[ good protection COVID. neutralizing antibody levels drop, chance getting sick increases.

In words, found much evidence cells mechanisms compensate weak antibody level. may antibodies [primary defense also could responses correlate, people low antibody levels also tend weak cellular immunity. bad come though.

He’s shifting goalposts. He’s responding current information related incredibly dynamic situation. post perfect example. didn’t say “you can’t spend Christmas families”. said “it’s early tell” that’s 2.5 months away situation could change rapidly.

If anything, proves dismal state public education US appalling political situation forces us two parties essentially reinforces “their side vs side” mentality. People need understand virus isn’t static thing stays make sure feelings aren’t hurt holiday plans aren’t impacted…    Also number died breakthrough case compared total died oregon misleading, virus longer vaccine. number would slowly creep time ratio become closer 1:1 I’ve saying it. Insurance companies risk assessment, recognized risk increase. Expect premiums reflect higher risk cover vaccinated person. 

If ever away pre-existing conditions protections fully expect covid one area issue. Long term issues linked (and boy ton them) covid heavily resisted cover. Yes see responding guys 100% effective preventing death comment.

Also bit deceiving comment, anyone could run similar numbers come minuscule number unvaccinated well. numbers telling low transmission rates Covid oregon among vaccinated unvaccinated.

I love original comment getting downvoted quoting oregon health department statistics, I’m pro vaccination anti bullshitting. Shows rails extremist (on sides) entire topic become. gonna like influenza shot take every year. sound bad me. I've chemo 1000 times worse. issue vaccine, immune systems. good reason.

Constantly producing antibodies one particular virus always efficient use resources immune system inhabits world millions billions different types microbes viruses fight off.

Sure, exposure antigen X, makes sense body crank production antibodies antigen X. However, seeing while, immune system factory needs shift production viruses, bacteria, etc., encountering frequently.

That mean immune system leaving defenseless. memory B cells, store blueprints fight Antigen X, encounters again, crank production again. Yes takes bit time factory shift gears convert producing anti-Antigen X antibodies cells, yes time takes allows virus infect you, things kick in, immune system good position clean infection up, preventing getting severely ill dying. 

Again, immune system works. Scientific method applied. current percentage unvaccinated need hospital care infected far lower 10 percent.... article links scientific study showing reduced hospitalizations. I'm sure could want.  big surge area (50-100 new cases per day county 110k) wife attending indoor gatherings, especially grandparents 80s, one currently chemo. We'll reassess situation Christmas.  don’t understand efficacy measured. sure 10% vaccinated people end hospital getting Covid, percentage much, much lower. Hello guys, I'm currently sitting fence jab need people educated give hand questions have. 


Some background, I'm medical scientist experience cellular biochemistry, neuropathophysiology, pharmacology molecular diagnostics. recent delta wave performed 10,000 PCR tests sars-cov2 (N, E, S, RdRp genes). 

What current understanding outcomes points listed below?

1. Post vaccination acute blood work vs risk lethality actually contracting COVID; particular RBC morphology, deranged E/LFTs, Citrate based tests.
2. Post vaccination viral excretion, spike protein effusion (2P protein) cell-wall integration.
3. Effects cardiac load vascular cell wall integration subsequent increased resistance effect turbulent flow.
4. Blood brain barrier incursions risks bolus/complement clots areas like circle willis microvasculature end points.
5. Current sample sizes efficacy testing statistically significant? (for example, fertility tests acute effects performed sample size 45 men). GOOD   may survivorship bias here, ones conviction quit instead get vaccinated.

Unless work health care, CDC still recommends masks made least two layers washable, breathable fabric. big reason that, yes, surgical masks still limited supply, according FDA, must prioritized health-care workers.

I’m sure helped. drug companies, FDA CDC recruiting pregnant women vaccine trials research. pregnant, would hesitant there's data available pregnant women. agree vaccines there's data available, case. Unvaxed ppl love swa. don’t see happening without federal mandate. airlines reasons:

1) Insurance costs life insurance expensive insurers.

2) Public perceive airline safer.

3) Sick days, workman's comp, training new employees take place die, much much cheaper budgets.  I've heard antibodies significantly higher second shot 12 weeks apart vs 3 weeks. reason might longer protection booster. great medical scientist nurse's job, somehow questions became word salad. Blood work vs risk lethality? example efficacy testing efficacy testing all? 

I'm sure stressed somehow got confused happened, think would best calm find review studies read them. could link them, medical scientist, able find (I know done already asking entertainment thread).

Although, since vaccination rate compliance mandates extremely high, date entire area 4 million people less 3k COVID deaths. 

That's less two weeks Florida.  Aren’t already required Biden’s OSHA mandate? I'm agony moderna booster thing. busy month coming I'm going multiple craft fairs people may vaccinated. dragging feet this? got 2nd shot April. I'm Due.   *hollow laugh*

I'm outlier. Got Pfizer booster yesterday body/head aches bad hardly move, can't move arm got shot. said, experience mainstream would still prefer full blown covid course. Pfizer booster (3rd shot), felt like shit next day, confirm New Zealand island full 5 million people, applauded shouldn’t compared land locked larger countries. understand pregnant women worry consequences taking vaccine. It’s crazy watch kinda fascinating. Can't blame anyone concerns, I've jabs sore arm first one. no-one knows long term effects be, especially unborn children.

30s female - Pfizer April - little chubby - chest tightness flu symptoms, light fever, lasted week 
40s female - Moderna March - tight chest 4-5 days, elevated heart rate, low grade fever 1 day 2 (no loss taste/smell seemed muted)
Late 60s female - overweight - high fever flu week. Vaccinated sure 
Female - 30s - sure vaccine probably April/may - asthma healthy weight. Sick week

Secondly, video mainly focuses compare efficacy rates vaccines, people comparing 'efficacy' figures vaccine, primary figures coming vaccine trials relate vaccines (again, trials themselves) prevented INFECTION vaccine groups versus placebo groups. 

Yes, also published figures efficacy vis-a-vis severe disease death well video Vox highlighting ""more important"" number, that's editorialization.

The numbers always publish highlight first vaccine clinical trial vaccines preventing infection.

There PLENTY vaccines MMR, TB, Hep A, Polio, Tetanus, Rabies, etc. nearly perfect preventing infection person exposed.

You never hear someone missing work mild case measles mitigated vaccine took child. No. They're completely 100% immune measles.

That's also viruses (like Polio) virtually eradicated worldwide. goal vaccination perfect situation.

Now, global health community done essentially moved goalposts. fault that, YES vaccines perfect, they're GOOD ENOUGH potentially stop pandemic. bad news coming countries like Israel even Singapore, many moving parts explain rise cases, data vaccines clear greatly increase chances mild bout COVID (even Delta variant) infected, body bit head start fight it.

And we're learning respiratory viruses (especially coronavirus type) likely stay us forever now. We'll form SARS-COV-2, likely require us take boosters every rest lives, likelihood, unless technology changes drastically, we're going get less-than-perfect vaccines prevent infection, help bodies improve prognosis.

But say primary goal global vaccination programs vs. SARS-Cov-2 pure moving goalposts media health organizations underscore importance vaccination, especially face breakthrough cases. never primary goal. primary goal, achievable, always prevent infection, period. truth. control, got foothold certain communities game everyone.  was, NZ it. kept spreading mutating rest world NZ can't anymore.

This scientists saying. booster vulnerable virus circulation still quite high probably updated shot two year road virus evolution settles maybe 

But politicians seems think differently... course sorry, similar story here, mean there's community diagnostic testing, used hospitals NZ. would suggest stop feelgood excuses fairly evaluate risk/benefit statistics age group.

I asked clarify. Well that’s antibodies, T-Cells, antibodies supposed drop time that’s natural thing happen, what’s important bodies ability make new antibodies, Covid, yes may get sick, body get armies ready go get rid infection.  cares?

Those people fence get soon makes impact life (such able fly plane, keep job, etc) Read carefully? witchcraft? This! 90% reduced rate hospitalization headline be. Much better anyone dared hope vaccines first tested. thought strategy suppress community transmission went zero, whole country could safely go back level one (basically full freedom except travel). even successfully delta came along, time taking matter weeks. new strategy matter-of-weeks path back level one? another thread. Also, downvoted hell invisible now, making pointless old news half day. healthy people 18. higher chance complication, chance hospitalized. fact, obese 18, yes, go get shot. DoD part Federal Government. We’ve mandated weeks. roll implementation. true things outside pandemic too. Often times medical recommendations based raising risk levels amount regular person cares about. often impossible find information risk regarding behavior common still probably raises risk pretty acceptable amount people. Thank thoughtful response. Yes I'm used level criticism established narrative downvoted oblivion outright removed. biggest issue last part. highly subjective. Certain types people inclined get vaccine, also another huge variable. litteraly thousands known times scientist weigh data get published, comes observational stuff, almost make things point based one's interpretation. I’m boat you. comfortable bringing child holiday party everyone vaccinated? entire family vaccinated except son young. I’m still fence do. It’s there’s pattern something almost 2 years. /s ^_^_^_^_ that's statement generate clicks. Isn’t odds “short lived plasma cells short lived” above? half population fully vaccinate America. Plus, vaccinated give shit aren't. They'll hurt themselves.

Also do. Every country antivax; sadly Facebook, twitter newspapers papers stay America. Although, way less (74% fully vaccinated). know effects covid though, stillbirths miscarriages creeping higher. people vaccinated, know vaccine effectiveness starts waning six months - specifically Pfizer. going constant game catch-up next gen comes out. CDC kick rocks! missing another holiday friends family again! Medicare 'Medigap' policies ***are*** priced according BMI ***and*** smoking status. know provide insurance agent. Medigap policies also touch anyone kidney failure dialysis. 

The guy repairs lawn equipment said pays $150 month Obama Care insurance smokes. soon Americans actually get board, maybe. I’m glad you’re country isn’t full antiVa antimaskers set COVID parties kids. America full problems narcissistic population. There’s lot hostility gatekeeping within medical community anything resembles departure CDC recommendations, even advice give recognition fact hardline stance completely ignored, causing greater harm end.  vaccines use different dosages. Moderna higher dose medical care system beg plead goodwill others flawed, especially since look 2020 see Americans general (about 7.5 million) caring people help make look good. ask leaves PSTD abuse mental health disorders (many told actually do) cold. Mainly asked priests qualified triage mental health issues LOOK like need (or look homeless) denied help. one screaming need help told goodwill places sit shut elderly person remember pees needs more. 

I know beat welfare head get welfare thing is, DONT want burden society working 3 jobs taking care 3 kids forced (because could get sterilized terms) barely time take shower make dinner keep going those. 3 jobs, STILL make enough pay ever-rising rent costs every rising gas costs ever rising food costs. Every time made money something happening took away could save without letting kids starve go homeless. 

So goodwill others government fails, next? masks available drugstores gas stations? live. find online, usually accompanied reviews people saying they're true KN95. massively overstated NZ giving elimination strategy.

Until two days ago, plan lockdown aggressive covid suppression vaccination rate high enough longer require lockdowns.

For best protection COVID, really want FFP3 (N99). That’s what’s worn hospitals treating COVID patients.

You’re right though valves common masks. They’re tougher breathe simple surgical mask, less effective wet - valve helps (but obviously massively reduces effect mask protecting others wearer). enough people vaccinated vaccines effectively prevent outbreak worse last year's. outbreak happen unvaccinated vaccinated. numbers summer higher 2020. people taking chances vaccinated. like suddenly number vaccinated people jumped 30% August &amp; October. We're still way effective herd immunity. see avoid even rush vaccines next month. already happening right now... 2 weeks we'll start see effects. unusual premiums discounted healthier behaviors like getting exercise smoking. ... next variant concern people hospitalized dying something like 95% minimum unvaccinated. doesn’t say aren’t vaccinated, cautious. still case, wouldn’t displays KN95 masks every gas station, surgical masks every drug store. reason wear cloth masks anymore, want extra protection. signed booster received without pharmacy asking questions. pharmacist told (at least area) shortages vaccine want help many people possible, whether boosters initial course. good reason go get booster. Sign up! Perfect timing right winter, too. emergency-rooms teetering around 98% full, number deaths start soar coming couple weeks.

I follow discussions news channels people complaining blame government this. (vaccine-program, hospital modernization, expansion number intensive care beds etc). 
They claim numbers inflated ""by pen""

And laugh face anyone saying gone gotten vaccine already.

I'd say late nationally mandate pushback coming people created problem initially people may cared first exhausted care anymore. However, *should* still wearing public settings, businesses school requiring them. That's safest expedient way achieve goal getting rid altogether.

Unfortunately, fifty percent population remotely close enough achieve herd immunity, got whole generation young people can't vaccinated still. Kids may die significantly lower rates adults, still serve viral reservoirs, mutations occur, infiltrate, spread throughout population. Delta already shown increase hospitalizations mortality rates kids. I'd hate think impact virulent strain gets loose.   denied love ones dead
Like walking dead (3rd season think governors daughter) really confused me. thought body knows make antibodies, set life.  likely. Obese people large risk die covid. Red team: “shit.  That’s voters. guess shouldnt anti-vax.” cases BS. 1) really matter high vaccinated areas 2) easy manipulate. Encourage testing A-symptomatic people test positive get counted. Hospitalization ultimately death thing makes sense look at. MuH fREEdoMz!!! Unfortunately antivaxxers know tend procreate intelligent people. Could variety different things, ask question comes province (Ontario, Canada) seem low rate breakthroughs, overall cases, fourth wave pittance compared waves, already decline - uptick starting August, peak around September 15th. 

The things think may account success (and might useful consider places like U.K.)

1. high vaccination rate. Eligible population least one dose, 86.5%, 80% two. Eligible us 12+. Overall population 76/70.5. 

2. 3% population confirmed covid, whatever natural immunity comes - useful number, know many cases missed many people covid also got vaccinated (either after). throw number, makes think 3% population + 76% roughly total level protection - around 80%.

3. vast vast vast majority cases come unvaccinated normalize data, highlighting vaccines quite effective.

4. seems indication Moderna better protection symptomatic covid, might impacts things like herd immunity.

5. lot space doses, got us lot shit, seems like evidence continues mount could impact efficacy there.

6. lot mixed dosing, that's wild card though idea effect had. wanna say good one? Maybe lot second doses Moderna due supply.

7. cautious masking slowly opening up. Masking culture still embedded everything do, capacity limits still - lots work force still working remotely.


I know exactly UK compares, know also pretty good rate vaccination, also spread out, vaccine efficacy might different AZ primary vaccine think Pfizer second common? Also seem restrictions/masking culture requirements. Finally - timing, may loosened case peak, much high population wide viral load disperse easily. Rural areas less vaccinated California. see zip code level vaccination rate here. Many zip codes SF/bay area 90+% fully vaccinated  dont need idiot trying condescend me. making stats demonstrate complete lack understanding wonder didnt address it? dont address stupidly confident postion zero knowledge subject besides social media Google. I'd love know think thoughts matter. I'm fascinated mental disorders. Although last bit I'm entirely surprised at. Anti vaxxers generally believe covid think flu. actually concerned covid got vaccinated. really expect unvaccinated Americans worried covid considering they're still unvaccinated Yeah, mention I've worn cloth masks COVID I'd still wear even COVID disappeared overnight want flu. That's 0.7% reinfection rate.... Excess death stats might Canada around 50,000, estimates.  mean, paper straws disappeared don’t think that’s something would mourn wonder already due undercounting falsified data/backed data. Sounds awful surprising. meant unemployed anti vaxxers might extra vulnerable white grievance propaganda. check boxes dumb. chance mutating replicated  Bingo  Ah man, COVID Pfizer. Well, wild thing compare graphs, there’s still contest Oregon’s faired better severity length peak, let alone deaths. It’s even stark look highly vaccinated counties vs unvaccinated, like said. I’m sure folks seem think basic science flies window hits US, understand feeling way. gotta first vaccination today. asked pharmacist, give straight answer probably stupid question, thought I'd ask here: 

can share food friends vaccinated yet? mean, since mRNA vaccine, like I'm carrying virus, right? friend got vaccinated. Would tell anyone. Told got third shot, never said anything. Told son got vaccinated May. son got vaccinated. 
Whats big deal people?  Disposable surgical masks place too. made woven plastic still place hundreds years now. incredible amount waste. definitely undercounted cases hospitalizations positivity rate dropping it’s safe say Delta wave Florida right now. said would need booster shots vaccine came out

Does Pfizer CEO count ""them"" say get month's warning they're unvaccinated sick, get use hospitals. know, empathy left, I'm totally burned out. Let Dr. Facebook take care And? don’t look shape graph read it. Comparing scale deaths/cases per population, there’s contest. look death count. Oregon’s bottom 5 deaths even surge, FL TX shot top 3 4. Still unnecessary. Welcomed? Maybe people. unnecessary? Yes. brought states literacy campaigns early 2000's paid billboards read, "" ... % population illiterate, one call 1-800-..."" one personal favorites, ""Illiterate? Write free help...""  Herd immunity reached hard way Florida. thing basically happened India. easy justify arm teachers assault rifles!

I've three years gotten enough banked could take two weeks covid exposure (which, since I'm vaccinated, they'll never make do). cannot keep catering overly anxious middle class Americans. fear many vaccinated people feeling based science way live. people need serious help. Bahahahshshs I'm sure something else caused steady, gradual, [red suddenly shoot up. something bad happens, always three! CDC thinks sizeable number Americans heed advice sorely mistaken. Giving unrealistic unreasonable advice like makes look touch lose credibility.

I saw poll today said vaccinated Americans worried breakthrough infections unvaccinated people worried getting COVID. means messaging seriously messed up. October 1st  hospital network’s active covid patient dashboard pretty darn good visual: lot people initially took precautions got tired stopped. Anyone vaccinated probably socializing still capable spreading virus.  Must lacking thoughts prayers. Biden literally launched drone strike killed children...""oops"" didn't. famously pursued 'zero COVID' strategy outset. Ardern confirmed many times (for example quoted even round articles abandoning strategy saying ""With outbreak Delta, return zero \[Covid cases\] incredibly difficult"".

Scientific American article subject NY daily death rate constantly 500 day month. painful.

Some people realize much family, friends, society whole make certain personalities feel like outcasts, like wrong wanting attend someone's wedding shower party. Probably Jefferson. stats third shot / booster? anti-vax areas: “Rural north Central Valley case rates three four times higher rest state, exposing stark disparities” Well, let's wait see then. wrong, better everyone, glad!

But right, think final count made, victory. want right, want smart one here. right indictment entire human species, terrible tragedy all.

I hope right. That's correct. upload vac cards. show, get flagged monthly insurance go next year.

FYI. job always mandates annual physical blood test. participate also get jacked rates. fever shot, elevate heart rate common. heart rate would go back normal speed fever breaks. Nah gave containment eradication SARS-CoV-2 pretty quickly.

So virus become endemic.

The thing understand entire drive towards vaccination since done understanding would case, still vitally necessary.

The point vaccinations vaccinated infected infection fatality rate subsequent infections drops dramatically factor 10x/20x so. virus become ""just flu"" even possibly cold.

Immunity also start force virus make choices towards immune escape away virulence.

It going look like 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza, spread ever year seasonal influenza 1957. trick surviving first exposure virus, T-cells recognize virus immune escape difficult impossible virus achieve.

Everyone planet going catch virus, real, soon later. Get vaccinated, though, time happens big deal.

Right we're problems enough people got vaccinated, they're insisting natural way, high fatality rates they're clogging hospitals morgues. 1-2% people going die, needs dribbled slowly hospital systems fall over. everyone vaccinated, could discussion right live virus, instead wait everyone gets SARS-CoV-2 T-cells one way another.  Honest question, find home rapid tests? I’ve get tested couple times drive PCR tests. sell home rapid tests CVS similar? Guts then?

Edit: bellies clear. Pharmacists saved country. initial shots, ppl went back spitting us. boosters everyone nice again. 

Good thing identity isn’t good pharmacist cause would killed long time ago. hilariously touch statement average person behave.

This.

I mean people fully vaccinated took pandemic measures seriously last year got fully vaccinated way shape form another ""virtual holidays"" avoiding gatherings fully vaccinated friends family. reason, vaccine way go measures. safe be, asking fully vaccinated people keep avoiding socializing fully vaccinated friends family ludicrious.

I think Reddit Redditors stand avoiding gatherings precautions even already fully vaccinated nowhere near reality even previously-cautious people fully vaccinated stand. 

No one circle know avoiding sort gatherings, lol. We're planning continue spend time one another, Friendsgivings, see family, etc.  decide Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner whole family, us vaccinated don’t Covid, defying “science?” would safe gathering be, even science shows that. Yet CDC still seems pushing virtual Thanksgiving even vaccines. agree, shouldn’t large gatherings anyone regardless vaccination status. really you’re going vaccine area guard down, you’re really playing piece full practical information. It’s far interesting generally useful title suggests. article? remember highest estimate 700k Another stupid comment  Ireland got 60-70% adults fully vaccinated. First 5 months year miserable. Completely nonsense saw study day save it. happen source handy, you? Well, you. I'm vaccinated still continue mask up, sanitize, social distance foreseeable future permanently. 

Case point: around Tylenol murders took place. Guess every last grocery item purchase? Check seals, squeeze chip bag little check seals, avoid smorgasbord type restaurants, little ketchup packet hand drive thru window burger...yep check too, etc.

And hear living fear, I'll point 65 year running streak regards staying alive healthy. I'm making point sole exception statement India undercounting 10 May June (in 200k deaths), rest pandemic real number probably 50% higher official one. likely death toll around 2/2.5 million, certainly 450k also 4.5 million 

For Africa hand obviously wanted remind average age 20 years huge advantage, Africa total 200k deaths two African countries alone deaths entire African total: Egypt South Africa. 200k estimated deaths covid, officially first 20k second 90k... grossly mistaken function science. report facts, interpret information, giving conclusion. discrediting information, desire. People want routines disrupted. That's personal problem, scientific one. infectious disease expert take feelings account, regarding information tell avoid getting sick. That's works. all. 

So, supposed change virus spreads? people want hear, *their* problem? People gather tight spaces holidays. Folks want mask up, get vaxx, listen scientists say, somehow *scientists* fault? Americans self centered, stupid listen doctors, scientists? No, people selfish, generally stupid. doctors, scientists. general population stupid, selfish. Idk Fauci act like it’s fault mind reading. one interpret “it’s soon tell meet family Christmas” “it’s safe meet family Christmas”. said said I’m glad corrected he’s god it’s okay admit said something shouldn’t have. He’s wrong though. It’s ambiguous get. It’s soon tell. 

It’s good idea hang unvaccinated people right now. might still dumb idea get together unvaccinated people. 

That’s better headline I'm sure natural immunity great happen *Typhoid Mary*. Inborn genetic resistance great happen *Stephen Crohn* (*and managed stay away opioids*).

I get it? vaccinated like surefire silver bullet ready, generated immune response vaccine. Sure might still get infected virus, got silver bullet, plus additional immune response body ends throwing virus.

\*\*\*

Say werewolf, mainly goes older people continual food source, every also gets hungry younger meat. 

The town plan, everyone given rifle two silver bullets times case come across werewolf. 

But townspeople say chances dying *virtually negligble* werewolf mainly goes older people. others saying best bitten werewolf develop natural werewolf immunity. even decided eat wormwood chicken pens heard somewhere treat lycanthropy. Yeah hired really dedicated actors.   don’t think comparing COVID heart disease. Lots people manage heart disease years. dad died 93, heart disease listed one factors although auto immune disorder contributed decline. I’m saying heart disease isn’t issue, certainly is, it’s instant death sentence catch early manage it. plenty try stop kinds things kill us, something kill us eventually. 

I’m thinking, we’ve seen people deny COVID serious, taking seriously inconvenient. take willful ignorance apply diagnosis denial without politics. Sheryl Recinos’ patient refused accept diagnosis Covid-19. cough Recinos’ perfume, patient insisted, certain positive Covid-19 test could family medicine hospitalist California, wearing perfume. test result, Recinos told patient, interaction, summer 2020, outlier time. recent months, conversations become common. treated people who, two weeks hospital stays Covid-related breathing struggles, still believe coronavirus. patients questioned judgment, patients demanded given medications former President Donald Trump received Covid family members patients screamed something simple giving loved ones oxygen, necessary treatment argue harm baffling. I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Recinos, works 12-hour shifts 20 days straight. “So many us worked long many hours, we’re undervalued general would point undervalued pro-covid anti-vaxxers don’t believe medicine enough get vaccinated. sane people appreciate them.

Agreed. pandemic yet, wants get sick enough risk employment? **that** quote I'm saving... ""fully vaccinated"" point also debate. Given messaging 3rd shots booster part main series immunocompromised, think pretty clear cut 2 shots considered fully vaccinated group. bigger question people ""recommended get 3rd shot/booster"" group, probably something like 30-40% people would considered fully vaccinated standards 4 months ago. There's also small group people got Janssen vaccine less protection people got 2 doses Pfizer recommended get second dose yet. also complexity added 1-dosers. 

Its far simple issue, different risk groups people participating, number people, amount ventilation, many get negative test results going, many people people participating interacted recently, consistently people wear masks, masks wore, etc. 

Perhaps closest thing could get message app allows input data gives estimate likely covid spread gathering, severe outcomes be, much NPI would prevent spread, etc. Something like 19 calculator. thinking long slow crawl 75-80% couple years. think we'll finish year around 70%.

Once available kids lot uptake kids certain areas another 4-5% so.

Good news think 65-70% enough pretty much end it. Remember people get also immunity. think last major wave. CDC needs get head ass realize nobody gives fuck year.

They're giving guidance. may like it, they're us vaccinated. realistic recommendations like: Recommending family members get vaccinated staying home exhibiting symptoms. 

they are, recommending masks, vaccines. and, many parts country ""most us vaccinated"" case. experience everyone's. loses credibility public.

You single handedly decided revoke credibility ""nobody gives fuck."" argue half folks refuse get vaxx, give CDC finger, tired pandemic. We're tired pandemic. Avoiding unnecessary travel *is* *very* good suggestion stop spread pandemic. 

You're attitude *exact* reason we're still problems. People like complain what's advised *want* hear. They've talking winter surge...from beginning.

Understaffed= overwhelmed.    C'mon Michigan, get shit together. jam. Like, forget diapers about.

Someone doesn’t can’t afford can’t use fucking tshirts diapers instead.

You seriously can’t daft. lot vaccinated people get virus, asymtomatic. Symptomatic COVID data caring for, UK case, 85%. ""The state’s 7-day moving average daily cases 3,362 Monday -- highest since early May. ""

So, no, 4th wave over. moving Upper Midwest. Michigan outlier spring cases pandemic April starting go May. time going wrong way. have...  False. No, get vaccinated. need wear mask, sanitize, social distance. point vaccines.

The virus forever. Like, forever. we're going socially distance forever, fact we're already done that. got vaccinated. Almost everyone friend family circle vaccinated (besides nutty brother) except kids eligible. we're going fully normal holiday season fact fully normal family gatherings months now.

The ""overabundance caution"" completely unrealistic top people stopped listening months.

Probably still standing issue booster booster. CDC released paper week ago indicating Pfizer 120 days falls ~71% efficacy also reflected Israel seeing/saw mandated boosters.

So saying soon tell fair given US still sitting 60% fully vaxxed 70% least 1 dose.

People want get back normalcy half population year later still take steps necessary get there, expectation met? job market way find something pay decent wage pretty easily ruling bombing virus fast?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Coronavirus like infection plaguing mankind long long time. Specifically East Asian populations. Thank much info - missed announcement.

Does FDA typically actually grant meeting? I’m wondering date actually hope get shot #1 kids arm.   FDA approved everyone yet though  study says hospitalization death.

I'm half-remembering story saying 9,000 people died COVID, 43 vaccinated. others not. people want irrelevant science, problem biggest factor. Idk dude. Seems affect certain people differently. friend mine basically gnarly fever + flu symptoms week. almost went hospital/was starting worry. experience mean everyone else's lol Seriously. see stunningly self-righteous, martyred Facebook posts “poison” “forced” put bodies order keep jobs. happy get Moderna shot last January almost started crying, couldn’t stop profusely thanking everyone working vaccination site.  Aye that's case, Wyoming population 600k 20 30s substantial higher chance getting cancer mycorditits vaccine.

I think take chances getting mycorditis, continue grow old see daughter grow die COVID. Right? first PCR tests Covid 19 come early 2020....   can't control family does

They vaccinated. … That’s CDC’s recommendation. 

That said, vaccinate not. can’t make either. got third dose month ago immediate family gotten well. 

Awesome, got third dose weeks ago. family boostered, one sibling left, they're Moderna qualify.

That’s choice. 

… don’t invite unvaccinated brother Christmas let potentially expose immunocompromised, high-risk elderly members family home.   article referring test kits, referring machines used administer tests  I'd love hear affects way. make feel bad someone still cautious rather forget we're still middle pandemic something. run PCR almost everyday confused reported here. I've read couple different articles internet 2.0 report say something bit different. appears purchase equipment predominantly, without reading actual report, difficult say. report covered well....  like Moderna Hopefully next generation vaccines even better preventing infection longer months.  Saw 6m title got excited. nothing 6m olds… good news nonetheless. first vaccines approved FDA, NZ zero COVID community position start bidding war countries 100x economy. $700-1000 5 day regime, I'd say much better free jab arm gives much better odds hospitalized dieing really need release boosters holiday season.

They chips mentioned testing seals above: ""squeeze chip bag little check seals"". also mentioned fast food - another unhealthy choice there. 

If talking keeping precautions point future specific set circumstances (which actually feasible, zero covid come about), we'd talking difference risk tolerance. difference understandable. Instead claiming may keep precautions forever mentioned point stop all. years? really need release boosters holiday season. one fucking wears mask family gathering Asian countries unless you’re actively sick. Quit misrepresenting culture. idea little narrows down

r/unexpectedbatmanbeyond Unlike CDC regarding pretty much anything. Sure. going held liable long term side effects? Can't tell sarcasm PCR tests what? specific, can't order test kit something unknown.  Nope 50 somethings normal bmi males. Covid kill laugh . Honestly, public health people media last 18 months, Scott Gottlieb far best communicating general public. Everyone else downright abysmal. Agreed people get 3rd doses/booster/booster-2nd-doses/etc, can't control family does, risk must take account actual status, ideal shot. 

I got third dose month ago immediate family gotten well. one sibling left, they're Moderna qualify. Comorbodities? fat? old? 

You hysteria valid reason removing bodily autonomy.    that's major US airlines count Delta's vaccinate pay insurance policy. Maybe anti-vaxxers go work Spirit. There's nothing wrong holiday gatherings vaccinated people, one safest things do. many public health institutions seem scared say outright understand why, afraid hurting feelings antivaxxers? vaccines ever supposed keep hospital, promise preventing infection all. want admit moving goalposts.

That goalpost moving. trials vaccines (at least Pfizer Moderna) symptomatic illness, severe illness. winter spring ""vaccinations prevent COVID"" ""vaccines prevent severe COVID"". summer, strong evidence efficacy waning time began appearing breakthrough infections happening left right lowered bar considerably ""well, may get sick dog give loved ones, probably intubated."" Israel became clear efficacy severe disease, least people 60, also waning. waning coincided arrival Delta, made situation much urgent.

The whole campaign boosters part meant discourage ""vaccine hesitant"" --- many going shot #1. also agenda part concentrate vaccinating Yemen something.

I know vaccine normal course two shots three weeks apart. Many several doses separated months years. Polio vaccinations children 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months 4-6 years. Pariah state “separate”? cardiomyocytes stressed inflammation?  make sense? care people's political affiliations are. personally know 9 people died covid since pandemic began 4 last 2 months. unvaccinated wish gotten vaccine died matter political affiliations. teachers getting vaccinated 11th hour, probably none die covid get long haul complications. feel like ambiguity (if addressed depends vaccination rates spread) leads folks vaccinate also motivates push family members holding get vaccinated too. 

We passed hump ""individuals part"" getting vaccinated crossed conversations family members still hesitating. lol holy shit. there’s chance people coming visit wouldn’t hurt keep Antigen tests handy they’re place. gotten bit lax like nanny 20mo old cause it’s physically impossible work care kids long without help we’re least periodic testing w antigen kits maybe moving daily get availability kits. October, still soon tell? like things drastically changed couple months now, people likely vaxx travel anyways care says trying here? think tell story. Truth singular, shouldn’t worry others interpretation motives. countries managed keep 0 covid strategy going. countries can’t isolate rest world forever. allow posts singular individual. includes posts someone hospitalized, dying testing positive. think error, please modmail us.

🙋‍♀️ fully vaccinated (although perhaps time holidays arrive???) severe health issues. staying holidays feel it’s soon behave “normal” again. want breakthrough case, even mild. understand though, mixed messaging CDC. 

Also, relatives vaccinated, alter lifestyle masking/distancing lieu vaccination. ...my god. Get man Pentagon *at once!!!* many grandparents die unnecessarily COVID throw caution wind? bigger question … 

If need booster/third dose vaccine, [there still 82 days left till 

All need calendar shot. act like straight said law preventing people seeing families Christmas giving advice may good idea avoid family gathering things get bad.   know it’s anecdotal. I’m salty whole situation. mRNA vaccine nothing like Polio Vaccine. dozens countries patents different vaccine technologies.

Hell China developing traditional one shot vaccine.

These pharmaceutical companies love much already destroyed community live due opioid epidemic.

Morally posturing companies raise price HIV medications 400% f*cking disgusting. Thanks! info makes sense.

Yeah…my theory right vitality detected booster may’ve resolved quickly low stopped detected.

But since first test (PCR) negative, 2nd test (Binax) positive, suppose need assume it. Plus, symptoms &amp; not. Also; 2nd Pfizer shot 6 mos ago. It’s possible caught &amp; resolved quickly (didnt really replicate) &amp; mine may have. 

*sigh* 

It’s tiring &amp; confusing experience. again, nearly bad infusion neighbor told fully vaccinated 60 yr old brother died weeks ago Covid, husband oxygen &amp; way there. it’s much worse many. 😔 want dicks charge card transaction could stack. Also mailed toss mail fraud charges per unit charges. said first time. 

From Well, Margaret, believe way CDC recommended situation dynamic virus community, there's clearly lot spread, even vaccinated indoor setting, congregate setting, makes sense wear mask avoid high risk situations. Let's focus like laser continuing get those- cases down. **And people getting vaccinated also situation boosters appropriate get people boosted** know help greatly diminishing infection diminishing advanced disease, kinds data accumulating real   Agree. never said gathering. impression got, listening live, don’t know overall situation going be. wouldn’t commit describing winter would like. Yes. surprise New York. 4th wave mostly even last states still technically growing. hell 111.56 doses per 100 high lmao sure 140 per 100 much better still pretty considerable.   -Put fan window

I every year, fan pointing out. Gets way damn hot here.  ok, month might decent vaccination numbers. 1st doses especially effective vs Delta.

Take loss dude. isbsayong huge surge good idea, huge surge vsccinated party on. 

Best info thst idea next wave coming. didn’t tested till school year started (I’m teacher) Fair, buy tests. know, mine today signs saying appointment receive Covid vaccine. seemed flu shots available upon walk-in. studies US UK show it’s 90% vs delta declines time. also consistently 90% effective reducing hospitalization decline time. vaccines highly effective.  think saying vaccinated gatherings again. noticed supply issues. hardly even side effect. little fatigue first dose extinct it. They're vaccinating 1% population daily dude pace they'll 70% fully vaccinated end month

Edit: they're also gonna surpass USA total doses applied pero capita sunday next monday lol  4% going show en mass!!! /s  trial unblinded April 2021 ... easy know 6 reasons officially, really enforced. People going pushing limits everyday (i.e. large gatherings parks, pretty low risk activity, still rules). Eliphino He’s going to. Working Covid ICU don’t come back well codes partially code. It’s usually hypoxia induced brains haven’t getting enough oxygen awhile causes lot damage. Best case living facility trached dialysis rest life likely case leaving hospital I’m naively hoping 4 year old able get shot December. realize wouldn’t fully vaccinated Christmas, damn would feel good way 2022 fully vaccinated. Good letting facts get way fictional narrative. I’m vaxxed currently Covid. 

Only symptoms little congestion nose absolutely killer headache I’ve 5 days now? tested positive today. pfizer trial. also treat covid patients hours everyday 5 days week. knew matter time armor broke sure determined yes lol.

Yeah, city. US really ""*healthcare system*"", know, like every company information infrastructure. Obviously getting vaccine lot easier March, able make appointment walking distance apartment. got first shot hospital, one grocery store, really concerned flags going appointment.

Little tidbit ya. Yeah masking thanksgiving vaccinated family    click links know link poll, wonder who's polled fair poll. 

Polls generally wrong we've seen 2016 Trump polls showed Clinton would sweep election.  Yes Half country thinks thing overblown.

Ironically, especially Wyoming. LOL! also takes 2 weeks full immunity. usually go sometime Sept/Oct fits schedule. issues getting sick flu. That’s best analogy I’ve heard yet. really like one. Really puts perspective doesn’t it. wonder anti vaccine people would try turn one. source asymptomatic claim.  small study, unsurprising anti-vaxxers would pick provides fuller picture: vaccinated people similar acute loads, drop much quickly. also implies similar initial symptom severity, much quicker recovery. also shows lower level actual contagiousness, since vaccinated people level antibodies start number (in infections, quickly vaccinated) rise disease fought off. Except misty veil death. soon tell? 

Some 830,000-plus Americans vaccinated last week alone. … Millions people still getting vaccinated. 

And kids’ vaccines approved soon, too. 

And still 80+ days till Christmas.  actually rank third world tests per confirmed might want little research next time. Derperterd  kind moron thought would impact? pretty clear approval true reason people getting vaxxed anti-vaxxers would pick next convenient excuse. India much restrictions get delta control, along wave hit pretty hard, coupled rising vaccination rates. Getting covid control isn’t money. It’s national policy partly people react it, US…hasn’t well either those.  understand what's wrong said. ""Mandates work erode political power imposing them""

""Mandates consolidate political power something something authoritarianism""

Really moving goal posts around, huh? inviting vaccinated 20-somethings great shape garden party, instance.  He’s silly. Covid keep bunch people fr gathering Christmas aside they’ll dead then. Looking you, nut job anti-vaxxers. fourth mean second dose second vaccine.

So 2 Pfizer, 2 qualify, went got first time.

How get it? within county go another state?  recommended kids elderly unless you’re getting sick lot working vulnerable patients, people ignore flu shot.

Most younger Americans ignore flu shot. years gotten get check doctors offered them. times (including weeks ago) actually gone way get one. Reading diseases viruses lately made concerned enough protection, particularly since influenza, RSV viruses making strong comeback 2020 hardly cases. someone help out? Looking data regarding viral loads asymptomatic vaccinated folks ability transmit. discussion someone claims case unsure it. also pursues political power. called control authoritarianism. 

Where forced something 100% political power. 

By ""against will"" think lose livelihood freedom definately falls definition. talking Sinovac there…  mean, paying thousands thousands trolls deliberately spread misinformation US European websites news sources backfired trolls believe nonsense lies spread.

&amp;#x200B;

Who'd thought ... TLDR: People Delta mostly complain headache, runny nose sore throat. Coughing dropped 4th common symptom. Yeah really fault individual cities/states?

Theres nothing federal government ignores meetings pfizer. Super misleading headline. Per google translate, talking ONSET symptoms, disease progression serious stages. King's College Professor Genetic Epidemiology Tim Spector, one authors paper, said symptoms covid-19 ""different now, like bad cold,"" **and warned danger “People think mere seasonal cold keep going out, going parties. important people keep mind main symptoms related covid-19 changed since May. main symptom headache, followed sore throat, runny nose fever,"" added. main point vaccine prevent everything, done certain degree. know trials real world implementation effective is.

They didn’t “design” vaccine prevent severe disease death. That’s ended becoming effective predominant variant today.  advisory committee meeting. FDA usually finalize vote within day meeting. CDC ACIP votes things well, usually within days. vote, shots go arms. all, usually within week less vote, kid able get shot. [Vaccine requirements super popular Exactly. reason space multiple shots time, creates much durable immunity. vaccine bidding war, NZ ordered late. paying cost 10 million pfizer doses week latest lockdown, government slow this. imply Moderna ""better"". 3.3x dose, means could easily increased total vaccinations dramatically we'd cut planned third dose start. Certainly make strong argument older people getting bigger dose, though.)

If one limited amount vaccine, could either 2 large shots 4 weeks apart 3 smaller shots one 6-8 months primary sequence, think better bet would three shots, would likely create durable immunity. 

However, 65 people high dose flu shots immune systems need larger boost, idea high dose COVID vaccine seniors, immune compromised others makes great sense. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yeah, unfortunately they're undervalued people getting sick. general public, sure feels like her. Fauci backpedalled today.

Suspect got call WH asking ""WTF?"" passengers. point mandates improve public health, cravenly pursue political power. Christmas, everyone 5 chance vaccinated. guess boosters available well. case, pandemic me. give shit protecting anti-vaxxers. Correct. We're huge party holidays. Fully vaxxed course. aren't.

The population third now.

We'd need 2.1m dead close severity 1918 flu.

And even then, 1918 pandemic mostly cutting people 30s/40s, years expected life lost infinitely higher back then. I'm Ontario 30% larger population Michigan, we're 7-day average 600 daily cases like 4 deaths. Cases, hospitalizations ICU capacity actually dropping since schools opened Labour Day. 

Not pointing disparage Michigan, we're neighbours crazy see stark difference. best Michigan, formula seems working plateau cases. Covid denier? water buffalo bad reading comprehension? Thank you. folks would rather complain read; it’s human nature. two weren’t vaccinated.

This anecdotes really pertinent discussion it?  Got breakthrough case 5 months second Pfizer - confirm mild. Worst symptoms lasted less 3 days worse average cold, nearly miserable time flu. Talking like almost like evidence yearly shots far...but think scenarios 2022 beyond look safe far, probably next year update jabs better work infection.  I’m fully vaxxed got breakthrough case. think I’m good.   I'm US. get booster additional dosage six months Pfizer Walgreens likely others. type 2 diabetes hypertension I'm pretty sure obesity counts got third dose. work honor system anyway, either way. difference vaccination rates much higher now, look daily cases Northeastern states delta surge, close highs saw previous wave; also attributed good masking policies states. almost like size surge Northeast dampened due good vaccine coverage + adherence masking measures.Comparatively, increased surge saw due delta mostly low vaccination rates backwards policies enacted politically motivated states, ones got hit worse previous surge. I’ve seen, countries mixed first doses. guess, probably mutates much prevalent. Here’s hoping Covid measures decimated flu it’s spread therefore mutations near future Anecdotal data point here:

My wife works healthcare got Pfizer. work education got Moderna. age neither us known immune conditions.

 antibody tests done lab 7mos post second dose.

Her levels (Pfizer): ~120 U/ml

Mine (Moderna): ~1620 U/ml

(Apologies got units wrong.)

FWIW, wonder asymptomatic breakthrough infection, though (a physician) doubts it. look total population numbers. 80% Canada total population adults/eligible population? looking many hospitalizations vaccines. live like 90% covid patients yet vaccinated break shots 1 shot. glaringly obvious vaccines working great there's many people reluctant unable get vaccines. Disagree. Loads friends including liberal, younger got vaccinated right away don’t faith fauci think messaging mess. statistically, majority patients die. making case good, simply make sense (math-wise) bc chances are... they'll fine. They'll alive vote regardless whether took vaccine not. 

It's scientifically statistically proven COVID deadly disease... issue lies virulence. mandate/vaccine never really saving lives, preserving societal order prevent pandemic getting worse.

If pro-vaccine stop spread, I'm you. mandate essentially ending people's freedom choose better societal sake. pro-vaccine saves individual lives, no. right decide best people.

It's nuanced distinction important understanding resistance. feel like lot people would willing fly vaccine required airline though, especially one requirement. hope coworkers get clue! could want fake vaxxing seeing coworkers demise. I’m boat 19 month old twins due December. Told everyone don’t expect us anything. worth eyes. Sadly half time hospitals starting open beds, certain wave infected hit wall together. money, course.

For every flight hear diverted/delayed/whatever lunatic board, there's hundreds others every day make destination issues. incredibly naive think uneventful flights least anti-mask/anti-vax morons capable sitting still following airline's rules duration flight.

They're going wait federal government mandate like waited federal government issue employee vaccine mandate someone gets panties twist requirement, simply point Feds say, ""Blame them, us."" never anything useful anyways lol Grown men refuse Covid test regularly ER. argument persuades without test, can’t send non-Covid unit. 

They relent. Later, deny COVID+ results accurate. weeks half die. data Moderna booster following two doses Pfizer? two weeks flatten curve! got placebo last year real thing March. see really want booster since almost year since November. I'm worried about. I'm fully vaxxed pfizer 5 months now, considered obese. article acknowledges this, still magnitude increase quite suspicious. maths:

1 every 470 Americans died covid. far.

Plus cases long covid, heart conditions etc covid caused survivors. It'll gone Easter? Thanks links! great info much better system now. Yeah fairly aggressive asking booster think got bumped top call back list. get shot November? People do. do. I've done mostly everything remain safe protect around me.

It's frustrating dealing politicization vaccines. even vaccines weirdly one. 100 years vaccines working great, global studies covid vaccine safe, etc. 

The rebellion anesthetic people adopting identity. 

They somehow think sick people allowed private property forcing vaccinations. line head they'd ask people carrying black death visit would worried carriers freedom. imagine carrier could cured entering would rather sicken lead deaths.

Insane. still 45 states even gotten started much les peaked. I'm trial too, can't even get lab call back I'm supposed next study visit. Glad hear I'll get booster whenever finally happens. first part easy. people without immunity getting infected overall rate say 100 people per million per day vaxxed population getting infected 53 per million they've got 47% protection overall. break small age ranges things might look different vaccines may work better worse certain age groups.

The second part hospitalization confusing clear article. Unfortunately think answer 10% 53% get hospitalized based what's happening Las Vegas. We're getting couple dozen breakthrough hospitalizations per day 500-800 total cases per day. county vax rate like 51% majority cases unvaxxed. around 2/3 unvaxxed vs 1/3 vaxxed cases per day vaccines 50% effective blocking infection. 10% 200-275 breakthrough cases per day roughly matches couple dozen hospitalizations we're seeing. really understand done many disturbances planes. Vaccine requirements would get rid crazy people. means every 2 unvaccinated infections population, roughly 1 vaccinated infection (down 10 1 month vaccination). every 10 unvaccinated hospitalizations, roughly 1 vaccinated hospitalization.  Fauci: Flip-flops like fish land, gasping last breath.

Public: So...uhh...

Reddit: z0mG!!@$!# plebs trust ScIeNcE?#@$%^ exactly sarcasm, scenario help illustrate things like public health, make best decisions based immediate information have.

That said, even can't talk certainty outcomes, talk things going improve likelihood good bad outcomes. think we're pretty comfortable idea general sense (eat healthy, exercise, stop smoking, stop meth, etc. etc.)

But people, seems lost global pandemic works. people seem think like kind contract.

""Fauci TOLD get vaccine life goes back normal!!! BAILED end deal! I'll sue breach contract!"" cry, Fauci kind demi-god microscopic. burnt offering displeased him.

This motherfucker crystal ball. everyone planet discipline lock rooms 15 days, step foot outside, see another human mere 15 days, answer would RESOUNDING ""Yes, absolutely, gather holidays actually spit eachothers mouthes new form greeting Covid literally gone"". everyone decides they're tired take even basic precautions, no, really unlikely would wise gather holidays.

If people want hear want hear, sure listening whatever politician saying want hear. want hear actual scientist, going ready accept limit forecasting. farther away, less certain. adults manage talk medical issues without using terms like ""jab""? know, seasonal cold coincidence around someone covid could say favorite cheese Cheddar would people saying means never danger COVID point.

It really matter says point, people going hear want hear.  They're safer unvaccinated safe people vaccine. (Vaccine uniform protection).

I think, IIRC, antibodies whatever may start falling quicker compared vaccine. Covid couple months ago probably decently safe. 5 6 7 months might safe all.

Obviously look guidelines speak doctor. Getting vaccine booster make world difference. term become scary many there's evidence hundred years indicate word scary. iT’s fLu!!! 23% died oregon august vaccinated  prove this. Seriously. I'm vaccination, hell prove actually reducing hospitalization rates? That's idiotic leadership tbh I’ve following NYT map awhile, could watch red areas moving north like giant swarm. Clearly follows sort weather pattern. Wondering NE see increases, higher immunity won’t allow Even within family, hard enforce. long. I've always bit reclusive streak hard me, although miss going hikes, judo, fencing etc. people listening doctors? lmao since when? Exactly. still immune function might take minute kick high gear. That’s might still get ill, ILL. evidence waning antibodies means go back responding like unvaccinated person.  well could’ve already recovered covid hasn’t received sense smell back. know moms covid last fall still cannot smell. ☹️ Yes, Easter?   somewhat high values zero. mean 53% vaccinated people got Covid 6 months?

No, means 47% less likely contract COVID unvaccinated person. So, say looking group 2000 people - 1000 vaccinated, 1000 unvaxxed. 47% efficacy means would expect 53 cases vaccinated population every 100 cases unvaccinated population; words, 47% fewer cases per person. [Here wikipedia page vaccine efficacy want goes hospitalization; example, 100 1000 unvaccinated people hospitalized COVID, would expect 10 1000 vaccinated people hospitalized (90% fewer cases per person). They’d best protection every demographic they’d get vaccine. Single dose following infection best immune response. 

Any vaccine amazingly safe next zero side effects, it’s win-win zero drawbacks It’s 47% reduction compared unvaccinated. vaccinated people half likely get infected unvaccinated 6 month mark.

And 90% reduction hospitalization whatever chance already was. unvaccinated people hospitalized 10% rate, reduces 1%. know actual unvaccinated rate is, I’m pretty sure it’s anywhere close 10%. wonder 6 month protection would last much longer variant still original alpha?

Shot word used US. BS lot politicians vacation right visiting someone overseas. First off, I’m talking ability job better artist. I’m referring fact put pedestal reproach. question CDC. Also, things play COVID decisions make socioeconomic consequences doctor scientist might expert at. It’s also evident Fauci’s terribly idiotic messaging aren’t knowing….and that’s important science side job. 

There’s tons experts, tons smart people. huge portion country sucked Fauci (just like Cuomo), anti Trump. Birx wasn’t nearly popular, scene sympathetic Trumps BS. blindly give much credence handful humans. 

A lot idiots constantly say follow science entire point science isn’t things debate rules constantly re-written. I’m saying, weve elevated scientists something greater possible. CDC Fauci constantly editorialized things throughout pandemic, like not, top Trump dick politicizing covid, it’s one reasons huge portion people either follow every word like don’t trust all. This!!!!! literally word gives visceral reaction...  one point, Provincetown, reportedly 114% vaccinated.  

Likely due people relocating ""WFH"" yet counted town census. levels neck pain. Every article see things involves person selling little considering risk.

ACA plans can't charge anything except age, location smoking. agree - masking Cambridge high ... anywhere else I've been, much. Plus, nearly everyone know socializing pretty much normally. I'm pretty sure hanging unmasked someone's apartment four hours is, always was, much higher risk activity 15 minutes grocery store.  “Hazard ratios (HRs) 95% CIs unadjusted Cox model time-varying covariates estimated comparing rates SARS-CoV-2 infection COVID-19-related hospital admissions among fully vaccinated partially vaccinated individuals unvaccinated.”

Sorry, I’m done. comments feel purposefully obtuse point.  Idk seemed obvious me. get hospitalized mean might get cold flu like symptoms. everyone forget covid flu-like symptoms too?

Idk made sense, sure helps 90% avoid hospitalized, percentage protection flu-like symptoms. even die, still annoying get cold cough, sneezing, congestion etc. gives fuck. deserve attention. undersell it. **dramatically** less likely. know much would improve vaccine mandates, there's roughly 500k fewer passengers every single day compared time 2019: Thank you. minimum wage worker wearing KF94s much pandemic, since exposed unmasked unvaccinated people constantly. rotate some, takes bite grocery money.  Dammnnn 47%!? Alright need booster shot lol worry, due current government regulations, ADAM receive days replicated Little Sisters already harvested early 2000's. He's literally saying relying God. He's saying White churches fully reopened are. many ""all damn""? current research shows less 0.2% fully-vaccinated people develop breakthrough infection. states even reporting rates low 0.01%.

For reference, 0.2% 1 500, 0.01% 1 10,000. not. read study? never mentioned rate hospitalization unvaccinated. people power influence communicate information way *cannot* misinterpreted? almost if, shit hits fan, want able say ""That's meant!"" He's literally saying relying God like White churches see point comment. Moments disaster think delta exists tried exit strategy soon beginning summer. vote hiding pattern wait see kind attitude but. Plus, entering cold flu season anyway... keep masks around til spring? uncle (2doses) hospital. intubated taken make room people thought higher chance living. managed live that. Couple days later heart shutting down, think going make that. heard anything since then, guess lived? 

Depending risk people family visiting are, may interest get third shot eligible. sucks thinking might semi-immediate cause someone dying something could easily done simple things could done extra. Right moment rules change long record risky activities. dont trust doctors absolutely hate insurance companies. say little possible view yearly trip neccessary evil. terrible idea, especially donations, really know boosters would much even anything. 

There essentially two types long covid, ""any symptom"" variety, commonly anxiety, followed pain, fairly common, know vaccine reduces probability quite bit infected. [This study 50% reduction symptom lasting 28 days, infected vaccinated (compared infected vaccinated, including reduction probability first place). 

Then there's ""brain damage"" variety, generally measurable damage organs and/or continuous debilitating symptoms, much rarer start with, really much data probability changes infected mild symptoms. know serious long covid much common serious disease, vaccine good preventing hospitalization, also good preventing general, prevent infected mild symptoms? 

We cannot take 50% reduction ""any symptom"" long covid say vaccine reduces ""brain damage"" long covid infected first place 50%. easily possible reduces serious type long covid much - common sense, would seem probable vaccine prevent post-covid anxiety well, could still prevent ""brain damage"" really well. whether don't, know booster would better.

There's little harm boosters, least individuals receiving them, really data whether would reduce serious long covid. Three members Vatican Swiss Guards, elite colourfully dressed corps protects pope, decided resign rather vaccinated, Swiss newspaper Tribune de Geneva reported. Issue lockdown want saw many countries...

The 2nd third lockdowns saw lower compliance first.

So current lockdowns would work reduce cases ever eliminate virus. Ion’t know perspective wrong delta ending early august. 

I’m still hearing tons breakthrough cases. we’re headed fall. knows what’ll get cooked closed environments. delta waves subsiding across country. What’s exit strategy? we're mandating wearing kids getting sick. delta good getting vaxxed population (even tho hospitalization death, want vector mutations carry babies care for). damned pandemic keeps evolving, evolve along change protocols? number people avoiding travel lack vaccine mandates flights *a lot* smaller apparently think is. Airlines trouble filling flights more. clearance infection vaccine antigen you’ll high level plasma cells producing specific antibodies. provides protection reinfection. time goes plasma cells find way bone marrow become long term memory cells reactivated case subsequent infection later life. body need keep high levels specific plasma cells circulating since active infection host die off. pretty conical adaptive immune response finding waning antibody six months last dose unsurprising.  Also alpha, delta box fan move way air equivalent filter. downside fan makes things colder. one, dont blow guests, obviously two, turn heat hours. Bam, saved 100 dollars. complain still government's fault. apparently Joe Biden personally calling every CEO every company America telling mandate vaccines he'll throw gulag Siberia. 

Or something. lot birth defects associated vaccine we'd know many pregnant women got it.  nice able go get one, did. I'm hearing vaccines provide longer lasting protection kill you. That’s gatekeeping wtf doubling instead facing could Oh yeah, *terrible* side effects first shot (but second third). even shortness breath. felt bad went got COVID test (negative PCR), thinking got virus shortly first shot. Went away fast came on, 36hrs later. Would, without question, again. much better actually virus. recommended group, go get booster? judging rates severe disease, behavior play role. easily able compare breakthrough cases vaccinated versus cases unvaccinated. understand Ardern's decision give up. thought public polling showed New Zealanders supported elimination strategy.  Get 3rd dose now, did.

The defining feature social media interaction days seems cut groups half preach bad ""sneeches"" (Dr. Suess) are. really happy many people continuing wear masks help protect (and includes cloth varieties.)

This article pointing something truly useful, writings someone finds purpose life perpetually outraged.

A lot people great job right wearing masks. Good them. definitely fair share antivaxxers here… afaik people least get tested regularly mandatory anything fun want do. Like restaurants, bars, theaters etc. also employees get tested twice week. least someone refuses get tested can’t really go anywhere crowd. reason might longer protection booster.

The Pfizer tests showed much higher antibody levels booster (on average 6-7 months out) original 2 shots.

And would follow basic vaccine science booster 6 months would create durable immunity, body already built basic defense original course reinforced. many vaccines boosters 6 months year original shot. Influenza many variants way exchanges DNA influenza viruses someone/something infected 2 separate strains.

Common cold coronaviruses fall 4 subtypes, 2 infect humans.

The sars-cov-2 vaccines first effective vaccines coronaviruses. vaccines animal coronaviruses effective, common protocol cull herd infectious strains.

Summary reason common cold still exists (didn't even get rhinovirus) effective vaccines treatment due lack funding/research. There's still chance virus eliminated countries focus so. post said 5 months. 7 5? get booster every 4.5 months safe side?  original alpha?

Alpha variant, originally known ""Kent variant"" ""British variant"" popped fall 2020 became dominant strain winter. original SARS-CoV-2 virus.

**Russia reported all-time high numbers one-day Covid deaths six last eight days.**

You're welcome like terms *personal precautions*, sounds like pretty miserable rest existence (and certainly many many others), exactly point here. Fauci public health official talking everyone seems incapable remembering that. enough healthy young kids getting boosters yet. would opt video conference turkey sandwich call day. really difficult.

Assuming family would like see you, planning hurt them.

We're talking missing second year holidays. one lives forever. many grandparents die old age waiting covid ""ends"" see grandkids? don't.

BinaxNOW sensitive PCR, particular people without symptoms often lower virus amounts noses, good showing moment time contagious lot totally ""fail-safe"", one wants ""zero risk"" individual encounter susceptible person, rapid tests combined measures (outdoors mask), population level catch infectious people lower transmission. that’s needs stop fucking interviews. state country right now, half country always oppose whatever someone says TV. stay quite work background? opening mouth giving anti-vaxers even ammo spread disinformation. ? said it’s soon tell. means it’s soon tell. didn’t say safe safe. It’s soon make calls, didn’t.

More Info: using it: I'm surprised Boston break 1mil Wyoming tbh. thought bigger town terms population. kinda though. almost everyone that's dying antivax people. still plague that's dangerous everyone stopped, getting certain people often one knows that's given though.

There's plenty vaccines need X number additional doses super high odds protection decades after. something means shots last XYZ number months need re-upping constantly. does. think there's enough time data declare yet. So, people wondering said ""it's soon tell"" Fauci told ""it's soon tell""?

I mean, said it, like ambitious. He's trying walk back told really dumb thing say. want able take vaccine get back lives, take vaccine kept indefinitely lives. Got injections January. stack cards check-in desk. said important, could take one fill wanted so. knew could run stack made money (more likely charged/jailed), instead trying part get vaccinated. didn’t say bit visiting families got backlash though. said it’s soon tell not. filling football stadiums ok can’t aunt turkey leg celebrate Jesus?

It's whether people gather safely. can, getting vaccinated.

Sorry, use common. discovered likely mean 'loud tourist NJ' type drug. sure picked slang benefits get that. really meant post vaccination. 25, shit........healthy?? I'm baby week sure hell zero intentions visiting anyone holidays vaccinated. vaccinated 100% worth risk holiday roll around year. even family vaccinated (they aren't), getting could put us path people taking covid seriously. worth risk newborn already much figure out. doubt many Russians trust government, damn good historical reasons. probably would *prefer* western vaccine anything home grown. county, phased pre covid high schools, nothing value lost 🤷‍♀️   say delta wave would August? thank Noah Webster (as Webster’s dictionary) that, think. Pretty sure decided standardize spelling US, got rid U also turned hard s’s z’s.  am. Thanks! ….

No one talking that. fact true second wave kills young people disproportionate rate like 1917 flue (delta deadlier yes, overall trend vs noticeable spike spanish flu) good, also something holding back younger people getting vaccinated. Shoot, pulling vaccination map seeing cohort low 40's even liberal states discouraging.  headline arguably misinformation anti vax bait. People see headline automatically assume vaccine pointless. better headline would something along lines ""vaccine protection symptoms wanes remains effective hospitlisation"". figures important including one figure give false impression vaccine efficacy. Yeah, appreciate that. see nothing wrong there. Good luck, hope you’re feeling better. entire Northeast. Damn straight. Uncle’s stroke, efforts t’get back it, really gave boost battling own, ah, demons. test positive, skip party/gathering. People would prefer bury head sand hope best. test there's risk missing fun. rest irrelevant. would risk chance extremely rare side effect “know” they’ll 100% okay get COVID.

Whereas many us (at least me), tiny risk (&lt;1%) significant adverse reaction vaccine worth risk death Covid probably notably 1% risk long Covid like 25%? one study found organ damage 70% long Covid patients.

Also, got vaccine, least first one, literally crash cart room (I got employer/hospital), I'd suddenly collapsed, team people would right save me. pretty much problems happen brief window getting shot, so...that it. even trying say? source says result immunity. also start fade months. suppose think I'm correct then? thing would change mind if, road, discover cell-mediated immune response (T B memory, helper, killer cells) wanes addition humeral response (antibodies). evidence whatsoever pointing direction, fact, evidence points robust, long-lasting cell mediated response.

If covid becomes endemic (which near certainty point), would forms immunity ever chance wane? We'd getting exposed regular basis (maybe every winter). Nice false equivalencies. 

First all, unvaccinated person, someone otherwise vulnerable, public without taking additional precautions keep safe, 100% responsible everything happens them. Flat out, period, end story. 

I, millions others (nearly 70% population state), already done supposed gotten vaccinated. boosters approved, we'll go well, effect lowering risk us everyone community. 

For either refuse get vaccinated, can't point, need take additional steps protect ***own unique situation*** goes beyond needs vast majority population. wear high quality masks, avoid indoor venues, stay away people outside bubble, ***choose*** that, ***choose*** take risk own. one forcing that, stop trying place blame others. Clearly need prisons. Especially given J&amp;J's history.   Travelling *out* probably happen sooner general tourism in.  sorry that's factually completely wrong. myocarditis risk varies wildly vaccine age group. vaccines show elevated levels all, slight, massively. Please least rough look linked study making nonsensical claims.

The risk COVID *obviously* depends age well. Thus need protected well need protected varies, too. think old people received vaccines first earlier year? uh...cuz custom make mine go fully around beard tight.

You cherry-picking comments, downplaying positions ""could clearer."" wrong. lying. one arguing bad faith here. tool kind interesting. Suggests we’re around 82% pop immunity US. Exactly, ridiculous second sentence accurate whole point.

However, school shootings still localized events impact few. death rate &lt; 20 year olds 80+ year olds, COVID would taken much seriously. I'm sure also feel lot people immune naïve left order great huge wave.

I like  R number hovering around 1 across western Europe since summer, guess UK opened early got stuck high baseline. Ireland opened slower cautiously never big surge UK had, even though R number similar past months much lower base sounds worse virus, frankly.  Still climbing Maine several states.  almost vaccines 

*So practically immunity. main practical problem check? somewhat cumbersome, best cases, ask everyone status ... proof enough ... forget card pants?

From public health perspective, probably lot unvaccinated people wearing mask. Shit article. get frustration remember safety we've pretty confident vaccines safe primary vaccination. FDA want assess data make sure boosters safe primary vaccinations. sure boosters likely safe primary vaccinations comes safety FDA going go whim automatically assume safe they'll want look data first. there's also fact FDA also want work exactly best time give boosters. may get booster soon efficacy last long example. lastly FDA want confident boosters actually work. like last year FDA scrutinised data pfizer etc make sure effective vaccine they'll want boosters. 

I'm sorry news outlets scientists they're journalists. unlike journalists FDA want scrutinise data several times. never things whim approve something without going data carefully otherwise would undermine credibility. Neither Lamda Mu full immune vaccine escape. primary vaccinations, boosters, Delta infections there's going lot immune response population. Signed booster today. go 2 weeks People return.  talking one whole bone going missing, little bit lot bones? part US highly vaccinated? serious? 

It’s called NOVEL reason. It’s brand new 1.5 years worth data. honestly expect?

Killing  , America buy house cost two week hospitalization areas. They're really accepting risk clog hospitals consequences actions expect saved can't catch breath. hope either seem rely qualitative communication rather quantitative.

You meant say rely quality sources, [of you’ve provided qualitative … rather quantitative

… lol deflective [Quantitative data used researcher trying quantify problem, address ""what"" ""how many"" aspects research question. Qualitative data describes qualities characteristics. collected using questionnaires, interviews, observation, frequently appears narrative even conscious saying? almost certainly going eventually give virus someone might die it. Sure, might somewhat low chance, make choice them? 

These people utterly ashamed themselves. wonder country falling apart. People can't asked stand make easy sacrifices good everyone else. WW2 happened today, drafting, rationing, raw materials shortage, gas stickers, ban new car sales, would literal rioting streets. People petty now. Curious peoples thoughts immune US population currently …

It widely reported 30% US population Covid already end 2020. 

The US 64% vaccinated currently. 

Obviously there’s overlap people got vaccinated positive but…
with Covid cases rising 2021 vaccination rates 50% shouldn’t nearly everyone already defense Covid? Ugh, think “nope sounds way low”

Then realize it’s **re**infected. Sure, say so. gloat people died ? Yeah, definitely could clearer there, like places like article linked.

But combative? literally clarified heard say, linked article *with quote*, pointed fact right terms peaked. I'm lying anyone (again, *posted article quotes*). can't discussion good faith?  Sorry meant vaccinated continue use measures conjunction.

As noted, one efficient put together.  North Carolina Department Health Human Services begin reporting coronavirus reinfection information starting October, compliance new guidelines Centers Disease Control Prevention. 
 
As infectious delta variant become prominent, number refinections surged, according state health officials. 
 
Since start pandemic, 10,812 people became reinfected coronavirus 94 people died. 200 people vaccinated previously infected tested positive virus second time.

...

This data falls line health experts touting since development vaccines — previously infected virus make someone immune getting sick again. 
 
Infectious Disease expert University North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dr. David Wohl, said numbers show people vaccinated protected reinfection people relying natural antibodies earlier COVID-19 case. Yeah wife got J&amp;J got sick. Weeks later use put hold, wife high risk group history blood clotting easily. didn’t get clots vax, know way take another shot JJ.

And smell horrible. Disposable masks fill landfills smell like one too. shared prelim data study might made public? getting stuck j&amp;j first time around want rush get j&amp;j booster mRNA boosters look even better. J&amp;J's wane too? phizer bro wondering mixing different style would beneficial long term Efficiency relative unvaccinated people. 10x fewer chances getting vaccinated.

You estimate chance getting unvaccinated dividing number cases in, say, month, unvaccinated population. Could Delta maximum possible ACE-2 binding SARS-CoV-2 virus? Still better fuck entire senate needs completely reformed abolished. Less 15% country controls 50% senate. It’s simply democratic fucking wrong.

It’s amazing get downvoted showing context actually said. anyone actually watched interview, it’s clear wasn’t trying talk Christmas concerned health people right now. “…after Delta became predominant strain, full Pfizer Moderna vaccination 90% hospitalization 91% death.”

“…included 569,142 cases, 35,972, hospitalizations, 6,132 deaths adults COVID-19 across 13 US jurisdictions. these, 8% cases, 8% hospitalizations, 9% deaths among people fully vaccinated either Pfizer Moderna vaccine.”

“Once Delta became dominant strain, went 91% 78% COVID-19 infection, 92% 90% hospitalization, 94% 91% death.” Flu turns organs goo. Must Murdoch owned publication.  work perspective likely get fired nursing license revoked.

From legal perspective probably get fine. observing. affect way, interesting see people approaching pandemic unhealthy way match reality. he’s supposed say something truth make people like feel better? ""The US Border open 6 weeks"" - Repeat ad infinitum sure missed /s original post case risk getting woooooooooshed. 


[We   yet, use fall Pandemic downtime read *The Psychology Pandemics* Steven Taylor.

It came *right* Covid hit US, like actually even knew arrived, would really good primer lot us early days. covid vaccine? Recovered people seem get hit much worse JJ! Plus side- super high hybrid immunity after. delta variant discovered 2020. February 2021, ravaging India. May 2021, spread 163 countries. That's month Gottlieb said nobody would wearing masks past July. evidence there. paying attention. Yeah dumb. Cloth masks reduce transmission still. People can't keep buying surgical N95 masks forever. Cloth masks reused There's question somewhat better prepared medical response, mRNA vaccine technology stay improved, especially coupled advances mapping predicting protein folding development, businesses first time develop sort pandemic planning. absolutely agree human behavior one asterisk - world ever takes successfully puts dent limiting spread misinformation (a successful attempt hinder actual, non harmful free speech, AI tech likely would involved), possible get back place trendy radically skeptical point harmful extremism, entire social structures built mindset, barring that, there's little hope prevent future potential pandemics everyone needs board general agreement science plans needed limit spread initially transmission limited regionally. wear mask 8 hrs day teaching, get it.  sister, husband children got covid. husband’s mom family got covid. even lost uncles/aunts/cousins covid. Even experience, adamantly anti-vax anti-mask.  Exactly. Requiring mask mandates highly vaccinated populations already kinda pointless. Asking fully vaccinated people adhere pre-vaccine precautions go beyond cloth masks going spark backlash. Yeah I’m mandates state wear one 8 hrs day… Funny. That’s think nothing it. worked demo summers college would wear mask day Midwest heat… wearing one inside air conditioned grocery store isn’t big deal. Especially since I’m selfish asshole. Food industry, eh? Maybe nurses need start spitting IV bags. next variants

This. fuck knows what's coming next?! places spreading like crazy God knows mutations happening. Got J&amp;J noon Friday. Arm felt weird immediately weird sensations hours. 7pm feeling drained. Got chills, would break sweat, back chills. continued Saturday along low grade fever, one point chills sweating, simultaneously hot cold weird. pretty much normal Sunday, save extremely tender arm around vaccination site week. wife gently bumped arm one point hurt like hell. 

Still worth doing. No, fully understand completely missed point vaccine need wear mask. dates made up. 4 month here, elderly vaccinated Sinopharm hardly effective 60+ people, tried hide fact 4th wave. problem 2 months time 12% got third shot, many young people took opportunity instead older ones.

So experience situation 6-8 weeks US summer. Still many antivaxxers, deniers, unfortunately virus lethal swiftly clean genepool. Oh see now. vaccine isn’t going stop symptoms. certainly getting booster still wear mask 10+ hours day  I’m trouble figuring assess risk serious infection.

I live country essentially zero mask wearing (even hospitals), &lt;65% population vaccinated, restrictions unvaccinated vs vaccinated people indoor venues. 

There basically mitigation happening societal level. tools fact I’m vaccinated, staying away people, person around wearing mask. 

How make even vaguely informed estimate level risk serious breakthrough infection? honestly idea likely personally end sick, versus mostly fine even catch COVID US tried No-mask-as-a-bribe-for-vaccinating approach work. look top vaccinating countries (Portugal, Ireland, Denmark, Asian countries), common denominator trust public health policies government trying best. There's much pandemic time, clear communication restrictions one tool. mask vaccination uncontrollable thus unclear generate trust. Everyone wears mask long cases xx level per capita per day clear, enforceable, forward looking.

I'm sure controversial, work. reason why? Low availability mostly hesitancy?

I've heard Sputnik one actually pretty good, too... vote every year. mean, to, civic duty. Pain ass, really big deal...  Thanks. Good idea. ""You've upgraded Garbaĝe Suite!"" looked top 10 hits got Amazon, sure keep digging could find cheaper. also looked big box stores. Certainly better deals had, $5 50 ubiquitous seems US.  Saved lot lives thou 🙌 24M here. Heart rate crazy 2nd dose 2nd day. which, Im fine ever since. im sure got condition Covid affected everyone, disproportionately done damage lower income families, including lower income families US. Thing immunity vqccination also natural immunity. without risk hospitalization fatal outcome.  pandemic made regularly entertain thoughts using staples/super glue make sure people wearing PPE properly. fucking hard, morons intent malicious non compliance. 

So countering malicious compliance seems reasonable. Another way start docking hour's pay whenever they're caught without one. actually get booster another 'first dose?' I'm 5.5 months CVS let schedule anything like another 10 days. take one selfish asshole  I'm immunocompromised got side effects. mild, though. next pandemic expect state less 1000 people. cloth mask reusable/washable I'm usually going stores long anyway. longer/bigger risk double mask i.e. surgical mask cloth mask, already three layers, surgical masks better filter they're ALWAYS loose open sides, good either. least cloth mask better seal.

That plus vaccinated working far, hopefully booster shot coming up, it'll even better. Stop treating hospitals. Actually announce 2 months time, vaccinated admitted covid wards - willingly unvaccinated deal covid themselves. heard pregnant women say doctors telling wait, think borders malpractice.

My younger cousin reached April ask though getting vax. took time answer questions hear couple weeks ago thanked taking time talk here, tell got Vax.

A week later deliever healthy baby boy. Holy cow, difference Moderna Pfizer almost order magnitude.

37.4 per million Pfizer doesn’t sound bad, one per 26,700 people so.... Granted, people sought care, right? religious cult or... soccer fans, agree something always disagree others. tipo juventini e interisti... hard. want deny childhood special events memories like this, time, like child alive.  
If get least one dose Halloween, I'll way relaxed.  curious, deal kinds people? try educate easier nod along try get issues? well know worse report. Yeah, reason cautious optimism. Lambda Mu supposed ones going quash vaccines, haven’t taken hold countries Delta dominant. handful unnamed variants now, none shown ability overcome Delta. doesn't. go Amazon buy box 50 way cheaper day week. Im fully vaccinated moderna. 2nd day 2nd dose, heart rate crazy like going explode. 3rd day, everythings fine, little tired. Im sure got condition.

24M Unfortunately, fractured way thinking runs deep. I’m sharing I’ve learned people know pretty extreme “I’ll never get vaccine” space.

Ultimately believe risks associated illness, (and think themselves) non-existent - risks associated vaccination therefore significantly higher.

Simple put - believe 100% get nothing sniffles COVID, chance get blood clot vaccine “under reported.”

The rest irrelevant. would risk chance extremely rare side effect “know” they’ll 100% okay get COVID.

It’s hyper illogical, hyper selfish extreme, think.

They proceed believe impact negligible - well world (which exists serve only) needs go back normal.

It’s equivalent children think. people immature brains never fully developed. There’s chapters dedicated fact children quite time fail realize world actually doesn’t revolve around - much bigger, complicated place.

Whatever textbook term - we’re seeing across intellectually stunted adults right now.  year, though. first paper list... editors journal need publish (anonymized) peer reviews every part evaluation, one, needs scrutinized. American CDC said initially, frankly premature, surprised backtracked. Personal immunity mean can't get infected better prepared mount immune response faster, many ever see symptoms. (And ones likely avoiding hospital trip/death sentence.)

However, infected person vaccinated still spread disease air particles, saliva, etc. produce significantly less infectious particles unvaccinated rapid immune response, limits virus's ability replicate quickly cuts available viral load necessary infect another.

The biggest hurdle always going herd immunity. need, minimum, 60-70% population vaccinated exposed order create basic herd immunity, virulent diseases need significantly higher rates. (Things like measles, requires 95% effective, versus polio, needs 80%.) think CDC announced hoping would push people get vaccinated quickly, backfired people promptly ignored criteria took masks without vaccinating. fuck?


Last year didnt vaccines alot people outside texas Floridas cesspit vaccinated, going anywhere close last year. 


I think vaccinations restrictions lifted see spike flu cases compared last year. going anywhere near bad last winter.  crazy people would get forged documents. There's really useful way enforce vaccines, least United States.   Part makes hard weather horrific winter can't properly ventilate whatnot. feel like get sick Thanksgiving every single year. I'm sure I'm 5 hours stuffy house people eating chatting loudly masks rn... HR team nothing people wear use mask rule harass people like fire them. booger wall men's rooms notified HR plenty times nothing done. Corporations always done, fuck workers make sure share holders get money. Serious. planning travel Canada work last year, clear go airport hotel stops, stay room 10 days quarantine. going fresh air, trips grocery even masked. know enforcing level, sounded like nightmare, completely pointless since needed 3-4 days site. Obvs canceled. Collectively, humanity really long-term planning benefit individual directly memories short. people governments would never act example there's personal/financial motivation so. financial reason think big (see Elon Musk).

While might better prepared viral pandemic future technology, can't ever see us better behavior standpoint. human way. Unfortunately bunch monsters can't bothered anything prevent deaths.  get straight, you’re actually trying tell “primarily [this] *rather than* [that]” “[this] *and* [that]”. 

I’m dubious. people quit! article appears nothing Covid- survey done first time year.

So know many young Indians depressed non Covid times comparison (and even know specifically contributing it)

And interesting Indians less depressed international median level. reminds restrictions first lifted area last year. felt bad restaurant workers people going eat time selfish, entitled assholes. Spirit's probably trying figure charge extra $45 gate sit COVID-free flight.  Good! Get shit arm ASAP. one first people area get J/J shot. Two days later 20+ people work exposed Alpha self quarantined. 8+ positive cases knew of. dude. 

Get JJ boost go N95s. FUCK COVID! cannot get vaccine whether want not. Even then, kill dumb people dumb wanting vaccine? No. Everyone reacts differently sure go anecdotes otherwise. 

For record, one friends bed entire day Pfizer shot fit enough go short hike 12 hours shot.  somehow military days full MOPP gear. precisely can't nice things.

All guidance states continue wear mask, keep space wash hands regularly.

Vaccine helps prevent symptoms getting bad require hospital. stated cannot get vaccinated legit reasons vulnerable.

Classic selfish attitude lack understanding fundamentals situation .

Seems way. Pretty much every state I've looked shows trend.

California ~70K deaths, 43K year.

I even checked states well pandemic like Vermont 136 deaths last year 187 far 2021. Here's really, really simple estimation. Ignore complicating factors. 55% population infected, 56% fully vaccinated, resulting 80% population either vaccinated, infected, both. adults, 85%.

Explanation: initial estimate two updates, CDC estimating 4.2 actual infections every person gets positive test. multiple current case total 4.2 divide total population, that's enough infections account 55% population. also 56% population (67% adults) fully vaccinated. assume complicating factors balance (some cases reinfections would reduce number people exposed, vaccinated people less likely catch cases frequent among unvaccinated people) 55% population exposed, plus 56% 45% vaccinated comes 80% (.55+.45*.56=.80) Likewise, .55+.45*.67=.85   weekly updates informative throughout pandemic. Lots data episode. many cases know of, family pressure key. Feelings run strong getting vaxxed alienate friends, family, community, even job. relatives another state fear marriages get vaxxed.  idea didn’t hear this, made day! Thank you!   .5 percent points stand. 

OC right, too, fwiw. 

For example, seven-hour infusion every six months, kinda like OC. It’s far invasive normal reaction far “bad” **any** vaccine. 

A couple days nausea/fever vaccine practically nothing. initial ""99.7% survival rate"" Summer 2020 still circling around people. Delta variant deadly first variant hit Northeast. like they're 2021 Atlanta Hawks think they're playing 2020 Brooklyn Nets 2021 Nets.  ...Roll Tide course.

mask use low. think highest saw maybe 25%. reason Moderna much larger quantity? paper bag strategy originally developed healthcare workers, would store masks work (like supply closet)

It fine reuse mask, basically leaving alone table whatever using time disinfection method. virus last long surfaces.

The realest reuse straps mask overall shape deform continual use fit face well anymore. Wondering people thinking COVID tearing northeast. take news?  Would someone PLEASE clarify mask wear covid! read something different every day! No, won't. Plenty people local news FB comments - ""I mild case. I'm immune. fine."" Sure, people infected people infected - doing. That's eyes glaze over. concern. will? That's ""severe illness"" seems work. everything see, ""severe illness"" seems synonym ""hospitalization."" makes sense epidemiologists' point view, since large part they're concerned keeping overall medical system decent shape.

But lots things reasonable layman would call severe outcome get counted ""severe illness"" patient stayed hospital. Even go hospital, even ""long covid,"" covid still fuck heart enough going need treatment monitoring rest (probably shortened) life. America, assaults nurses staff common.  Exactly. besides shortage aspect, generate trash? Cloth masks protect fine situations experience like going grocery store. Plus I'm vaccinated cloth still seems like decent option. mask-shaming people wear masks now? article actual scientific info whether non-fit N95 better cloth mask preventing spread COVID vaccinated people? so, much?

I love author's bio goes buzzwords once:

""She interested intersection science future food, climate change, pop culture, racial justice."" ACA puts cap much insurance charge smoking. Compared cap.   cloth mask thousand times better mask. something better? Yes, surgical mask. anything better that? Yes, go out.

At point need determine good enough - I'd argue cloth masks good enough. Others different view. Cases low northeast throughout summer last year too. Lets see winter goes. I'm hopeful we'll okay see anything close last year happened south year I'm cautiously optimistic.  issue incidence vaccinated person actually contagious enough spread COVID much lower mask doesn’t really much. risk calculus people it’s worth outside specific settings health facilities. It’s particularly egregious places proof vaccination required. Thanks jumping in. I'm spoons (fucks) argue w people parade claiming reasonable really complicit foaming mouth crazies touting ivermectin. nonchalance killing many people. blue ones surgical masks  Yup. takes 1 unvaccinated ruin health many. Breakthrough infection reality That’s great. I’m glad option found school cares everyone’s health. kids also young fir vaccines. Crossing fingers it’s weeks. use they’re washable reusable. Don’t go box medical ones, keep hospital workers buy CDC-ACIP meeting scheduled Oct. 20-21 fits time frame. approved meeting would expect boosters start Oct. 22nd (providing supply available).  Love AZ vaccine, 2 instances Covid house catch gotta source kind information.  Something something tyranny, something something freedoms think main issue many people vaccinated simple care wider precautions. vaccinated people full support guidelines eliminating virus like knight save humanity. 

They got vaccine reasons, either themselves, sake job, family local groups. Thus protected feel like they've done ""enough"" feel warranted forgo wider precautions. 

It's difference scale empathy. neither smaller wider scale empathy bad. regardless scale empathy, people feel justified they've done duty rewards--regardless others around them. Many people disagree that; others disagree. 

Personally, wear mask sake children, immune compromised folks, people can't get vaccinated various reasons (even folks like someone know who's husband let vaccinated). lessen spread chances breakthrough cases. 

This harkens back whole mask debate vaccines; mask primarily stop vaccine transferring others, defend you. many people believe that, understand it, care. haven’t seen anything interpret 88% rate though. writing *means* would love see it. 

Does mean roughly 1-in-10 chance catching illness I’m around someone COVID? mean roughly 1-in-10 chance catching general next 6 months? Something else entirely? Reminds double masking articles earlier year. cares?  else going get job armed halberd?

I reusable N95 use going doors around people can't control distance (grocery stores, anywhere line involved), throw cloth filters dealing open spaces filter replacements N95 cumbersome replace reseal.   thing that's exactly make sure comes roaring back. Right. 

I’m explaining isn’t worth much, scientifically speaking. immunity same.

The Pfizer 88% effective preventing infection one month.

After five months, 47% effective.

Those two things same. wrong.  hope either seem rely qualitative communication rather quantitative.  Repost wearing masks! forget masks! rules state ""as applicable"". source linked state farm themselves, feel appropriate use title used far objective insofar policy concerned. Yeah, shit. care less vaccines prevent vast VAST majority people serious outcomes. That's entire point vaccines, lower risk Covid flu mild cold, do. 

Beyond that, care. figured early covid detectable

If already symtoms, detectable. Cases issue deaths hospitalisation. understand people think kids immune it. soon happened started protecting children. 

We went distance learning, masks, hand-washing, less playgroups, virtually sports. exposed it, resources pediatric icus. 

So kids going get exposed it, feel icus, resources everything goes badly.  Well he’s completely wrong. Many people stopped wearing got vaccinated. mean tune college gameday NFL look crowd. understand comment thread works? Holy revisionist history. said would BURN August, run vectors, we'd done it.

Personally, I'm waiting month flu shot. also need Shingrix told wait month two booster. covid caused disfigurement like smallpox, seeing believing, invisible cannot harm Me. would opt testing vaccinated rule. We’re baby weeks honestly worried people carrying without showing signs (we’re vaccinated FYI). Unvaccinated people likely show signs virus vs vaccinated people. Thanks additional info. Home tests really cheap (actually 80 cents) here. Testcenter pretty much everywhere free. one 2 blocks away. make appointment online (all time slots available right now). generates qr code. show entering. Sit Booth. small window opens. get swabbed. Get another qrcode take me. one leads test results online within 15-30 minutes. leave place two minutes. really surprised easy well organized was… it’s absolutely free. 

The online testresults added wallet official corona app one button. wallet shows code scanned bars etc. prove I’m tested. 

On top I’m already naturally immunized PLUS vaccinated. don’t even get tested. still people require whatever reason. example family gatherings it’s often simple rule one makes big deal it.

Edit: also employer give 2 free tests per week don’t work home mostly say wasn't? exists, different, makes part country's total immunity. people vaccinated infected developed broadly effective antibodies also strongly neutralize new variants. country prior immunity, vaccination targets need higher. even yet. Oh all. I'm curious covid still give flu-like symptoms milder cases even hospitalize you. testing always ask symptoms like cough, congestion, diarrhea etc. even I'm hospitalized still would suck get lesser symptoms. 

As reference though, hate even regular colds think jobs take even common cold seriously give time fully recover returning work. sister recently got sinus infection whole family coughing non-stop, can't sleep mucus dripping throat, overall feel like garbage. covid job like ""how soon come back""....like...im sick tell I'm better return instead hounding come back work get others sick.

The school told fine. Masks optional. They’d missing school tested positive … online learning option, it’s better don’t miss time. 

This made grateful live Illinois. Right, hospitalized young men. group much less likely seek medical care experiencing discomfort. Good news rapid resolution, definitely worth studying closely. Russian government Putin made important point domestic well foreign politics devalue true vs. false. purposefully created ambiguity ""truth"" could fabricated confuse people ultimately make lose interest politics - ""meh, same"" stance.

That course backfires need convince population time, mean it. one trusts anymore.  Pfizer tests showed much higher antibody levels booster (on average 6-7 months out) original 2 shots.

When using 21-day dosing interval. much data countries like Canada UK spacing doses 8-12 weeks. infections also rare accordingly CDC split whether boosters needed younger adults.

There's also risk myocarditis younger individuals, could become inadvertently amplified everyone currently eligible vaccine gets booster shot. jurisdictions gone far recommend Pfizer-BNT Moderna 25 crowd latter significantly higher incidence side effect presumably due higher dosage. haha jokes you. paid childrens' future taxes! research largely conducted Pfizer, focused vaccine. Moderna included study, say anything either way. (If emerge difference probably Moderna larger dose.) No, waning antibodies result Delta, variant. antibodies work, stick around forever. Eventually immune system rely memory cells create new COVID antibodies react infection. still get sick future, get severely ill body produce new antibodies fight infection. Yeah I’m much better. August 20-April 21 hell. Brain Fog Heart sure. heart misses beats brain fog times makes feel like took 10 shots Getting Pfizer booster &amp; flu shot today, kind side effects could expect? 1st dose hit particularly hard, 2nd one left tired miserable day. Vaccinated April, got mine weekend. ALWAYS wear mask indoor public spaces on. would love see others cold flu season sure. need stop putting ammo anti-vaxxers 50ct costs $15-$20 US. generally improved time frame? troublesome symptom dealing with? He's right, knows better. June 24, declaring ""we defeated pandemic"" ""the vaccination success Romania"". Almost 3 months later, Romania achieved 30% vaccination, worst infection rate ever (and worst death rate), guy talks misinformation. crazy fast Australia caught up, looking great minister tried lowball Pfizer blew face. Obviously starting campaign long supply issues export bans fell away helps, on-the-ground logistical effort something underestimate. Well done guys!  don’t know feel decide what’s logical isn’t. Getting vaccinated everyone’s best interests, thinks kind story scare people, ofc makes sense talk it. course not, Germany, can't go shopping hop bus cloth mask anymore. either FFP2 surgical, even kids. He's kind idiot really gets around. mother law moron well! mom 98 years old vaccine killed caught Covid! Yep. matter says, typical contrarian fashion, ""doing wrong"".  Wearing fabric masks filter economical protective.  said would peak August. looking cases, pretty much did. one little increase mid-september, overall looks like cases peaked right end August. Hell yea!!!!!! Start charging stupidity, they'll change mind run beer money. think possible OSHA mandate. POTUS told to. head OSHA canned replaced someone boss says. Whether mandate holds court another question entirely.    ate ton gelato booster yesterday issues arm less sore previous shot. recommend gelato. booster hit harder dose two. mind getting thing yearly take two days work recover fun. could react less I'd fine it. Still better alternative, earn enough sick days take due fever vaccine. Ah, see Walgreens upselling people ""October Special"" wouldn’t commit describing winter would like.

I can't blame him, COVID decent track record making people look stupid predictions made months earlier.


That said, I'm vaxxed, family vaxxed, I'm gonna go see they're hosting get together. booster recommended then, I'll too. trying live life here.  It’s safety. know vaccines safe. It’s whether second shot actually helps. can’t say “everyone get booster” without knowing effort makes difference. Without knowing, could huge waste resources, could leave millions false sense security. There’s way know without studying six months longer. JNJ vaccine significantly different mrna vaccines, known Pfizer doesn’t apply JNJ. Duty future.

The credibility gained successful product run, better overall perception company generated, much logical goal. 

The next seasons hot new product line make(err prevent) killing…


Seeing out. Amazes money throwing pandemic can’t hire elite PR firm help literal genius convey messaging effectively.  live Philadelphia mask compliance near 100%. least densely populated areas  went cvs friday 5.5 months questions asked. Walgreens said tho. “She loved children never would wanted leave without mother.”

So, naturally, failed important thing could right keep safe. God forbid take stock local hospitalization case numbers make appropriately responsible decisions regarding holiday gatherings. I'm rabid Fauci hate. I've used four sick days far getting second dose booster. earn one sick day month. I've got fever count two days. need continually get boosters, need school system work let us earn one sick day month-maybe one half-to compensate. Better covid, teach kids yet eligible vaccine half got booster, would nice burn quarter sick days it.  love half people commenting read wearing cloth masks much wear mask half cloth enough wear medical mask. People don’t read article, that’s old news. it’s funny opinions polar opposites nonsense wrote feel. Stop trying tell think/feel. argument solely, harm masks cause? make children wear schools pandemic subsides vaccines 12 approved? Additionally half people even pinch nose part mask. Hello, wire reason.  possible.

It's also possible matter then. ""Partly due Delta"" ""not Delta"" thing Yeah second shot kicked ass boster slightly better. I'll keep getting shots needed long gets dragged out, I'm looking forward it. Makes resent anti-vax losers put us position.  Dose :

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* said US one would wearing masks past July.  Pitiful. 40% pitiful. Unfortunately Reddit opinion flipped “but children” mentality. Covid serious threat children. Covid never existed adults existed children, would never required masks worn schools protect kids other. reaction purely artifice fact you’ve seen bad adults, it’s front center news time, humans bad processing measuring risk. 

Having said that, believe masking schools children vectors disease populations high risk. want get pandemic control, need stop spread among everybody, regardless personal risk level. also vaccine mandates make total sense.  - best knowledge right vaccinated people transmit virus. far less likely become infected, and, infected, remain infectious less time unvaccinated infected people, still infect others. Masks help that.

- public health agencies lose credibility when, instead clearly telling truth, skew messaging manupulate public.  That's read it. again, got tested say happen, IDK wouldn't. Using mutagenic drug seems like huge gamble me.

I molecular microbiologist though, maybe totally wrong.  Covid turning disease mainly causing problems lower-income countries like ones got rid west, example polio tuberculosis?   people still thing absolutely fine better thing?  Yeah. patient facing work scheduling cancer treatments scans major hospital. Hold times calls 40 minutes. Patients angry. voicemails 4 days old often 200+ voicemails. able get back patients timely manner pissed. short staffed. cannot wait leave medical field forever end year. Ridiculous lying last year's stats though - eg 58k excess deaths Oct 2020, almost 2k per day.

For comparison, July 2021 (last released figures) 72k. bit silly. vaccinated difference protection cloth surgical mask likely negligible. viral load already going greatly reduced vaccine. floor effect. works! Luckily us anti-vaxxers cowardly, weak-willed people without true convicition. fold like cheap chairs push comes shove talking big game quitting.

More mandates, please. Awesome. Exactly looking.

If goes well we're looking last week October first November. Get it! covid got unpleasantly sick, fully vaccinated Pfizer, last dose , mid march. said that, two bad days full flu symptoms bounced back pretty quickly. 8 days first symptom, none except residual fatigue. doubt vaccine kept getting really sick. hid hard like coming me...then kinda faded out. fact asked specific country claimed 80% fully vaccinated hospital admissions tell exactly one... ended sending article Dr. Fauci, tells indeed stupid. get that, shots already developed we're confident safety we've calling anyone claims they're dangerous idiots six months. also know protection waning shots Delta way infectious. case strong major news outlets less openly recommending claim preexisting condition get shot instead waiting broader approval. else needs discussed boosters authorized? 86% young Indians thrilled Covid times happy talk it! wish would listen get vaccinated. people may agree us, need die. God damnit. anything like AZ, might since tech similar, second dose typically mild.

Anecdotal: floored dose 1 (for 24 hours), absolutely side effects dose 2 (except *perhaps* bit tiredness, driven several hundred miles day). Yeah instead get read lines message. IIRC Pfizer, meeting held vote, following week 'kind of' overruled vote following week allowing preexisting conditions certain occupations. 'official' pretty sure walk walgreens get one. That's plan (i'm assuming they'll make decision, least Moderna) LOL. Community spread amongst unvaccinated, call natural immunity, killed manority people first place.  Bit random question money support (UK) claim life’s badly affected COVID? hospitalised long long time go surgery much more, left losing job, still paying bills unemployed unwell barely scraping always going negative bank, savings gone. follows similar route Pfizer, FDA advisory group meets week CDC advisory group meets potentially restrict further, days later head CDC tweaks recommendations, takes days Pharmacies adjust new rules. probably looking 2 weeks meeting anything new implemented. point Einstein actual SURGICAL masks though. different 3-4ply disposables became common last summer. husband uses 3-4ply cloth masks work (university). would concerned strict vaccination masking policy well every week testing everyone. N95s grocery store trips doctor appointments. Tell understand much without telling understand much. high cost health care America relative costs surgical masks US Europe?  That’s elegant. vaccines prevent infection severe disease.

That simply true. Vaccines confer sterilizing immunity infection:

- Polio IPV

- Pertussis

- Rotavirus

- Hepatitis B

- Varicella zoster

In fact list vaccines confer sterilizing immunity shorter:

- Tetanus (after 5 total doses, sterilizing immunity wanes 10 years)

- smallpox
 
- MMR (Measles/Mumps/Rubella)

- HPV Ya borderline misinformation article cloth masked proven effective.. gotta realize vaccines developed lightning speed already. Pfizer making everyone else look slow, really speed happening incredible. sure cure kind stupidity actually catch Covid. change tune hurry. sad. surgical mask, mean n95, blue ones one wears correctly saw one day said decision usually comes within days meeting. also saw tentative schedule meeting October 26th discuss Pfizer 5-11, might expect EUA Halloween. level denial remaining unvaccinated strong, literally death beds convinced vaccinated. going towards Zombie apocalypse situation, cause would DEFINITELY people denial died.   Protection infection wanes, protection severe illness. Infection equal illness.

So much hinges exactly meant ""infection.""

I poked around little bit seen unambiguous medical definition infection (as layman) could follow.

I would guessed meant ""Infectious agents actively reproducing within host body,"" seem laymen interested COVID-19 use mean ""Even one single viral particle entered host's body instantly wiped blood sharks frickin' lasers heads."" couple days, within week. panel meets votes FDA making official decision pretty quick advisory committees. Personally, I’d rather pay higher taxes worry insurance.

ABSOLUTELY agree this! Every year stress trying 'crystal ball' health needs upcoming year order pick appropriate plan maddening. feels like shell game revolves around hiding actual cost of, well, everything medically related can't see difference consumers pay (\*collective insurance premiums well pocket expenses) versus actually makes pockets health care providers support staff.

I feel like American public could ever see simple accounting goes in, gets paid providers (and staff, facilities) importantly gets siphoned flows shareholders we'd appalled. Anthem instance, largest 36 BCBS companies, market cap 91.8 billion. addition dividents paid quarterly (est. 1.22%). one example profit sake profit pulled medical machine goes stockholders direct benefit either patient population providers.

On small side note, split comment thread tipping culture would much better everyone paid staff good, honest wage make every shift gamble? got shots I'm keen every six months feel like that's unreasonable difference Moderna Pfizer vaccine?  generic timeline follows:

1. FDA Advisory Committee meeting votes recommend not
2. FDA internally votes approve (usually within 24h Advisory committe)
3. CDC-ACIP meeting vote approve (usually within week Advisory Committee meeting)

Once complete, shots go arms. NYS' mandates thus far incredibly effective. OSHA mandates take effect, ridiculous court battles over, many places left hide, especially healthcare. Oh, honey. middle America they’re storming school board meetings waving black flags “tyranny” put cloth faces. We’re trying survive. We’re even close parsing distinctions cloth surgical. Sounds like J&amp;J getting somewhere booster approval process week. sure long take husband J&amp;J I’m hoping soon. Moderna second shot almost 8 months ago point, I’m pretty anxious timing. they’re likely submit lower dose booster trying get early isn’t really option. somebody explain still controversial say vaccinated people required wear masks public, ***especially*** got booster? Mask wearing encouraged vaxxed unvaxxed people, really required unvaxxed people.

Or else, people going whatever fuck want, say fuck government, get vaccinated wear masks see point getting vaccinated cant full freedom back. Good one hand, good news. hand, submitted now? really wish bureaucracy would move faster stuff. COVID-19 harder black communities whole pandemic, since vaccine became available.

Black people likely job required in-person work lockdowns, likely risk factors severe COVID-19 like hypertension. They’re also less likely taken seriously hospital admitted observation/treatment instead sent home, less likely good insurance cover needed hospital care.

All adds black people likely known people community died COVID-19. makes understandable they’d cautious/hesitant return in-person church, even vaccinated. stupid article. Instead happy vaccinated people still wearing masks (even though required to), judge wearing medical grade N95 face shield.  


Instead pretending still April 2020, lets accept post-vaccine era. can't wear disposable ones without eczema flaring wherever touch. I'm allergic something them. wear reusable fabric. kids wear fabric, disposable too. 12 vaccinated too. Also way less waste. hate see disposable masks place now. fall people's cars, get lost easily disposable wind blows over. to-go containers contain much plastic masks though. single takeout order could equivalent pack 50 masks. Holy crap, that's cells would specifically produce Coronaviruses, viruses, roses, cats, dollar bills remains mystery. Delta burning India June?

Look previous admin drawn playbook deal one even went it... Unfortunately new guy vendetta destroy anything associated old guy room temperature iq. Prophylactic antibody treatment? Interesting.   


Comparing Excess deaths Covid deaths, Eg. UK, Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Slovenia, Sweden, German, Denmark. Peru Chile too. Mostly hesitancy various forms, fear side effects various conspiracy theories. Many people simply care.

Though vaccine shortages happen several times. example Moscow introduced QR codes summer. 

Another example, there's inactivated vaccine Covivac longer produced since company makes decided upgrade production lines plans resume supplies two months. Quite people would willing get ""good ol' tech vaccine"" Sputnik.  straight FDA.   nothing value lost 

If anything they've probably drastically reduced chances sabotage 

The amount stories come anti Vax nurses health ""professionals"" giving vaccine giving saline instead leaving containers fridge long enough lose effectiveness etc etc 

Between one selfish person putting everyone system medical risk , risk person causing departments shut risk sabotage really way, health organisation, take risk percentage day day basis Lol actually immigration thing. LOL. lol

Admittedly COVID infection rates may touch misleading widespread testing: subclinical infections may common vaccinated individuals diseases since tested aggressively COVID, likely found. PCR tests notorious detecting subclinical infections may contagious meaningful health impact looking antigen tests vaccinated individuals actually realistic test whether someone likely contagious. 

Infection prevention secondary goal every vaccine (and many cases, primary objective), best way reduce risk reduce exposure risk. least looking nationwide level, vaccinated person risk hospitalization risk death middle September unvaccinated person late June. cases 15-20X higher, 90% reduction gets back sweet, sweet time cases 3-4 daily cases per 100K across US. 

This ""at least prevents severe disease"" crap seems like attempt back support FDA's boneheaded decision broadly recommend boosters all. Mild COVID still pain ass many, fear infection definitely impacts consumer employer behavior (I still can't travel without pre-approval, large events still banned). 

Even third dose ultimately wanes, still almost certainly end provide superior protection two doses limited risk harm. vaccines require three doses, require two typically three weeks apart. FDA sown confusion whether boosters really needed, killing people it: vaccinated people unfortunate enough die COVID, well unvaccinated get caught crossfire aggravated community spread. likely serious long term health effects vaccinated people? 

Correct I’m wrong read cases (definitely all) counted long covid side effects mental health lockdowns. Personally I’ve noticed old health issues flare close friends due lifestyle changes due covid pregnant would prefer normal pregnancy induce physiological stress? I'm pretty sure OSHA legal authority set workplace safety standards Northern Michigan here, weeks windows closed AC blowing winter, especially big office buildings. I'm vaccinated wear nylon buff cover face state still mandate. Prior vaccination wore singular cloth mask made shirt entire time. wastefulness surgical masks seeing blow around wind depressing. Gottlieb pretty good whole thing. I'm spiking football we're red zone. I’m currently pregnant wanting get booster. think real issue fallacy people afraid take wrong action (getting vaccine) passive inaction (not getting vaccine). comments people concerned potential risks vaccine without weighing risks infection that. Unless you’re giving birth alone, it’s possible stay 100% safe infection unvaccinated.

Though lot sympathy decision vaccine first became available, since less known definitely risk. I’m glad “nothing” however understand it’s affordable especially - large family making median income. 

Nevertheless still 50ct Amazon that’s like $7-$10 whatever. sure effectiveness yea affordable Amazon Science would prefer testing longitudinal study first cohort life stages old age. 

Your ""science"" short term degrees better sacrificing youth, followed rain, therefore need sacrifice youth!

The ""scientists"" agree saying shot safe better talking unknown openly they're bunch consequentialists actual virtues stick to. I’m “fearful” disrupting narrative. don’t know person potentially unvaxxed take info. 

I listened reports stories side effects (even 45F relative marriage dying within week getting AstraZeneca unexpected blood clot crisis likely thing talk about) ultimately decided numbers favor got vaccinated.

But surely people freak panic tell them, certainly don’t want cause someone taking life saving vaccine account fluke happened me. 

My “story” isn’t data, it’s anecdote. reported proper authorities info. 

I don’t want add problem people making decisions fear someone-who-works-with-a-friends-cousins-neighbors-manicurist type thing. “infection” mean “positive PCR” mean “sick” context? three vaccines available US work great preventing severe disease covid. whichever available area fine
 👍  Make sure live times covid fullest. That's correct. vaccines effective relevant data considered. issue comment easily misinterpreted claim vaccines reduce deaths 2/3, number much higher data normalized age-adjusted share population vaccinated. particular, vaccination rates among 65+ high, population also includes lions-share extremely medically-fragile individuals. study linked independent vaccination status.) 

I asking unvaccinated. order understand efficacy vaccine preventing hospitalization, need understand rate hospitalization 1. cases among unvaxxed population, 2. rate hospitalization cases among vaccinated population. 

According OP study, rate hospitalization vaccinated cases &lt;5%. 

That sounds awesome. 

But: rate hospitalization unvaccinated cases? 

Without able contrast two, impossible understand quantify vaccines lower hospitalizations. Got mine morning! know, like another Greek letter. That's case all. unvaccinated unvaccinated person wears mask avoids indoor public spaces, risk serious disease low risk disease low. sick, several behavioral things improve outcome avoid hospitalization. Monoclonal antibodies huge help given early enough, close monitoring blood oxygen working closely doctor help manage disease progression 
keep ICU. good assume vaccinated unvaccinated rates behaviors. possible control differences behavior observational study looks health records alone. Give em minute, getting started. actually 2nd Pfizer dose. kinda scared fuck I've never chest pain rapid heartbeats life. went away slowly day 2nd day, still kinda scared bit.

If body reacted way vaccine, can't imagine bad would've reacted actually covid. problem mind people going gather matter what. thoughts whether soon sound silly face public behavior. like doctor talking guy eats whatever wants made clear interest exercising telling patient eat healthy start jogging. tell throw favorite veggie park away parking lots.

Prior pandemic, already scientific publications N95/KN95/FFP2 filtration material could sterilzed reused low/dry heat, easily obtainable home kitchens. confirmed late spring-summer 2020.

I used pre-pandemic stash N95s (giving relatives) February September 2020, became possible buy KN95s without depriving frontline healthcare workers. 1 mask every two months: elastic goes first, though productive sneeze also ruin one. long one donning new one every day (or every patient) frontline healthcare workers, effective respirator masks expensive.

I'm admittedly neither doctor scientist, I'm willing bet wrong. Yeah, desktop work   first read Albanians, also hell become October. - wow ask think contracted COVID? masks caused harm, wear forever social interactions

They many parts world flu season.

And I'm literally laughing ass simply fact arguing masks cause harm. That's fucking hilarious!!! 😆  Yet I'm downvoted. Sounds like wishful thinking. Let's see Northern US spikes weather turns cold, next variants start popping up, also whether people get boosters appear necessary. favorite part: low attention span briefings w cabinet, figured putting name every sentence improved focus. 🤦‍♂️

##GrandpaShouldNotRunCountry US home rapid tests (results 15 mins) sold 2-pack costs $15-$25 - people want extra expense.

In order get PCR test parts US find testing site availability, make appointment, perhaps take time work (because often appointments working hours) wait 24-48 hours test results. test results available event require planning coordination. people can't take work simply hate inconvenienced. 

Then bizarre, unfortunately, popular conspiracy theory testing swabs contaminated COVID that's COVID spreading. Also, that's how, US, government ""targeting"" unvaccinated - forcing tested participate activities. think stems fact occasionally people negative test go develop symptoms positive test shortly thereafter.    white part egg? Let's check [CDC Variant holding strong time way Alpha never did. 

There justified reason believe Delta may final form since virulent variant emerged cases waning globally reducing odds future dominant mutation. people working customers get like Dick's Last Resort place Philly scream insults you. Also, like quadruple normal flight prices ""for risk."" That’s bizarre argument, I’ll take “face” value. (See there?)

Masks uncomfortable make human interaction difficult. They’re also added expense waste environment. 

If masks caused harm, wear forever social interactions, since Covid going endemic since masks also prevent spread diseases.

Frankly, it’s obvious understand masks aren’t harmless since you’re advocating use pandemic 12s vaccinated. 

The appropriate framing discussion whether harm masks cause worth tolerating given potential benefits wearing them. agreement current situation, mask use worth it. I’ll glad that’s longer case. Who's talking lockdowns today except you? Vaccinations. Masking. That's today, case want discuss instead Spring 2020.

88,577 Excess Deaths TX since February 2020, vaccines precautions necessary. Got it. become religion, thus facts evidence never change fundamental followers. could find box masks $5 I’d heaven! They’re expensive causing lot excess waste well. 1st paragraph click bait rant cloths masks. 

2nd paragraph ""surgical masks still short supply."" 

So author woke said ""how fuck people today erode publics trust American journalism"" honest thought whole mask thing vaccinated, except like schools clinics?  also true almost pharmaceuticals. Government funds basic research gets developed pharma companies useable drug disease. Alabama deaths births 2020, safe assume trend continue. rule publications headlines written way makes immediately hate author? People working hours hotter weather still wear masks day. even kids whine like do.  That's wear all. I'm person shift wears mask work, I'm also one two people said shift vaccinated. shit fuckn' silly.  could easily find disposable masks fit Face I’d go back those, they’re impossible find right now, ever since school started can’t find disposable masks size. wear child size masks job picky plain solid colors. found brand fits perfectly normal solid colors, can’t find anywhere back cloth child-size masks find somewhere Eh file religious exemption.

Possible variants continue threat.    YES! favorite airline. don’t understand dated October 4. feel like I’ve seeing claim made Dr. Gottlieb least month.

Now physician graduate degree molecular biology, spent time virologist. One things learned pandemic I’ve wrong lot things. I’m fascinated Dr. Gottlieb feels safe making prognostication like this.  Lol. suggesting community spread good thing, immunity infection exists, community spread happened made delta wave whole lot less dangerous lot world, even vax rates low. biggest danger always run capacity treat people would survive otherwise.

If identify someone get told do, see vaccines mask mandates coming source ""your people"" despise, start believe people like listen Dr F JB. 

People around thing. Anecdotes people getting sniffles done get spread around. Rinse repeat. 

I mean, see stupid is, think beyond comprehension happens. kind thing happens pretty much every culture around world. policy may change though. reason many airlines changing policy Federal requirements contractors, apparently airlines fall under. likely adapt species. result, declining cases humans indeed improve increased virulence.

You're assuming evolution directed. not, completely random mutations.  Besides, directed, ""adapting"" species would mean adapting harm host, way ""this guy"" MD, former head FDA, successful medical investor using evidence. maybe worth read.

I've watching statements two years now.

The thing keeping traveling mandate requires wear mask airport airplane fear catching COVID suffering long term health issues death. love traveling Asia Europe much. fairly sure majority well paid travel set feels way. I'm team JNJ , looking results I'm sure booster big deal 

It looks like unlike MRNA vaccines, effectiveness waning JNJ, still 80% effective . booster take 80 95 , nice , made decision get JNJ beginning comparing MRNAs 90+ effectiveness , got JNJ, I'm sure care extra 15% , JNJ great vaccine, good enough Thank you! It’s frustrating say least. live dc area family doctors (even parents Harvard). I’m information there’s much well. It’s tough slope push. It’s crazy education different various parts country  seem one denying evidence wanting believe conspiracy feel better.

So would less dismissive, instead examine evidence open mind. countries missing deaths degree.   oh shit theyre track double deaths... Well numbers likely artificial picture surprised Lets hope. Reinfection could easily next story.  live there.

*sigh*  would someone pandemic trauma want spent downtime *reading pandemics*? empathy.

The people referring gloat capable this. were, lot things country would different. estimate population immunity, could vaccine immunity natural immunity 100% effective. Rather graph ""percent population amount immunity"", since know vaccine immunity natural immunity fade time. Unfortunately effective population immunity worse this. USA, I’d write opposite. “Dying choice”? Mutations occur species less likely make SARS-COV-2 infectious humans mutations humans. likely adapt species. result, declining cases humans indeed improve increased virulence.

Predictions value even 100% accurate. Anything 50/50 factored decision-making. Since I've linked evidence prediction, unreasonable.

Also, ""this guy"" MD, former head FDA, successful medical investor using evidence. maybe worth read. might part it, people also love shunned. keep charades like feeds victim complex.

Some people also can’t admit wrong. seems happening more, headline implying top inflammatory bullshit attract attention, article rather mundane, discusses details, usually highly opinionated headline might lead people believe.

but enough people use headline justify craziness means it'll get shared around, even many actually read  Delta one hand, greater rejection safety measures like social distancing (say, Alabama football games).

Guess what? matter antivaxxers like think ""unreasonable"". millions people vaxxes think covid vaccine ""unreasonable"", that's we're miss.

There drawbacks getting vaccine. hope vaccine passports updated reach booster shot. *fully* vaccinated order participate society. think data related BMI released seen personal characteristics cases age ranges. Pride often defensive response.

If people see country/region/state/whatever constantly denigrated, they're going develop siege mentality. American south poorer rest country US media constantly seems depict southerners stupid, inbred evil, wonder would respond going opposite direction. everyone else annoyed people abusing healthcare workers need medical intervention diagnosed Covid 19 even though want hear it? rule, verbal physical threats appears threatening staff, patients discharged arrested. Patient looses care physical verbal abuse used patient without security arresting officer. That's works Wow unbelievable. calculate efficacy natural immunity? calculation involve comparing group covid vaccinated? mean every one 1.4 million would chance get reinfected. Comparing boosters HCQ absurd. 

And there's difference whim requiring mountain data several studies start confirming exactly everyone expected. schedule appointment walgreens put date 2nd shot.  AGAIN, 

Every point made 100% valid. based 2020 Alabama data, trump admin, right? 2021 Biden means less ability bullshit. doubt many people dying Alabama years, first question completeness integrity data set. knock wood said that, jinx us?  Yeah.. fattest people live. course die faster anyone else since they're bodies already weak af. 
The risk death vaccinating getting Covid lot higher getting vaccine getting life threatening side effects .

One thing find someone trust severe symptoms Covid ask person experience. thing country country know sure they're ones? tell sure? Cooling issue -- still comfortable outside. people turn heaters collectively around mid-November, things might change. 2021 ye- ... *oh*.    mentioned another comment source, India barely (and mean barely - hit 10% country vaccinated August, months Delta wave began) vaccinated point compared US. Since real world studies confirm, time, vaccines less effective variant, reason think we’d see upswing even amount folks unvaccinated. say wouldn’t see effects all, extent India it. Obviously ended correct, trying put context time frame. know nearly identical to? Exposure injected bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides). 

I've reaction nearly identical. Start feeling cold hours later progressing extreme shivering followed high grade fever, headache, muscle aches, nausea, completely resolved 12-16h later.

I wonder LNPs similar enough provoking kind short lived intense immune response.  Still make since 42% Alabamians fully vaccinated, death's worse compared full year vaccinations 2020? COD warzone garbage pregnant person, fear getting covid - high risk killing unborn child - significantly stressful getting vaccine that, point, thoroughly vetted. understand initial hesitation vaccine new, there's enough time data confirm vaccine safe.  ask maintain principle even get sick, go ‘the man’ rely ‘big pharma’, hospital take chances home. better us all. least could respect abandoning principles, whatever worth. Talked co-worker yesterday said already decided OSHA mandate put effect (we agree numerous lawsuits happens) quit vaccinated. made sound like he's talked anti-vaxx co-workers they're opinion. also thinks OSHA mandate issued despite Biden telling to. I’m pregnant enthusiastically got vaccine. think well informed pregnant woman would same. said, completely understand many pregnant done so, medical community society large bears lot blame. can’t tell women selfish reckless consume deli meat one cup coffee day, better take medication (particularly first trimester) unless really, really need it, expect completely forget fear mongering enthusiastically embrace new vaccine tons misinformation surrounding it. can’t ways. Either pregnant women need terrified everything always place health wellbeing last, it’s okay make choices carry minimal levels risk exchange benefits provide. treated pregnant women like intelligent, mature adults capable making rational choices inherent risks everyday decisions, would far less fear surrounding Covid vaccine pregnant women would feel empowered make rational choice.  Like said, it’s easier folks complain read. 

Thank proving correct. 

The fact is, **QUOTED** transcript **BECAUSE OC SAID FAUCI DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING THINGS.**

lol  Keep mind people really bad reactions shot. arm sore NBD friends mirrored bad cold flu symptoms two days.  Americans, lot people wear cloth masks country too. They're inexpensive reusable, compared K95 masks (let alone actual FFP2 impossible get think - I've ever seen Chinese knockoffs).  1000x. People still cooped home 80% vaccination rate. Hilarious Oh Christ stupid. That’s white nationalist recruiters go work assume, aren’t already indoctrinated. Same. 6 month mark, got J&amp;J April. Going see doctor recommends week. worth pointing DNA damage neccesarily lead cancer. lots things everyday life cause DNA damage--including sunlight, exercise, alcohol--and time body either repairs damage replaces damaged cells. 


There drugs similar mechanism action used treat/prevent HIV seem relatively safe drug likely even lower risk taken short period time. know several people traveling flying time pandemic. Nearly un-vaccinated. exceptions. Tire tyre kind timeline based this? meeting good mean 2 days later, 2 weeks, 2 months?

I really wish articles come would explain little works expect. understand can't say x date get shot would nice outlined next steps rough times them. Fauci decent messaging place. doesn’t clarify means. don’t think he’s actually contradicting (sometimes) think he’s discussing things broad terms it’s easy manipulate terms. said he’s idiot needs better messaging. It’s almost like jobs devoted medical messaging messaging general he’s utilizing them. mostly Americans celebrating June. stupid well considering happening UK Israel. US's lower vaccination rates sent alarm bells ringing right then.  lol

You numbnut. smart play limit exposure vaccines medicines available. Seems like Vietnam plan followed it.

Stay safe healthy friend.  paid 50 cents per n95 Delta taking off. Knew prices last, stocked up. Study says decrease partly due Delta partly due time. time decrease expected along due immune system anitbodies work. 

But that's headline says, that's article says, too. Replace word vaccine covid infection. what?

Totally agree Australia NZ though. US.  Hey silly, ***quoted*** transcript. 

And I’ve linked transcript every single comment I’ve made. 

Lean edit means. lol According article double vaccinated tested negative flew US attend Emmys weeks ago. data- pregnant women getting vaccinated since December US many given birth point issues. Tourist groups want March, makes sense heading cooler seasons there. They’re also going away quarantine period vaccinated travelers (although doubt they’ll let unvaxxed travelers period) - people coming UK US can’t afford travel far sit hotel X days.   Make cost public. Make profit private.

Par course.

Nothing see here. irrelevant fucking ""mild"" 

Mild still means long term symptoms, mild still means fucking die. still talking point year learn I'm sick stupid shit parroted endlessly. Depends CA. Bay Area we've wearing masks, indoors outdoors, consistently pretty much since May 2020. Rates stayed relatively low, 80% vaccinated never delta spike. supplementary analysis comparing vaccinated unvaccinated (and explain primary analysis, can't match vaccinated unvaccinated, different groups people). analysis, outcome significantly common vaccinated group myocarditis (which discuss main article, noting cases cleared time analysis - permanent). many items significantly common unvaccinated group, including stuff vaccine plausibly prevent, underlining authors point lack comparability vaccinated/unvaccinated. low grade fever hours dose two felt crappy rest day, still bleh next day. booster fever jumped 101.6, lasted eight hours, nauseous good four took awhile could take Tylenol. huge post-fever headaches next day. nausea new, I'm really sure happened. could dealt fever nausea. fever kicked fifteen hours booster-I absolutely fine then. mean, worth covid, losing two days sick time I've got like fourteen days anyway ideal. Two questions...

Do think includes children? so, close 82% despite age group eligible would encouraging

Do think anything formula accounts someone may counted twice. Example positive getting vaccine isn’t getting tax support system 350 million strangers

I mean, already paying insurance, they're already degree anyway. pretty likely they'd end paying less overall went universal. imagine would come handy people guarding museum medieval weapons, instance. Oh man see 5-11. want get hopes up!   happened Sturgis ""superspreader"" event? *gestures broadly every article ever written vaccine*

Seriously. Literally hundreds articles published every day every resource imaginable drawing conclusion. conclusion ""get vaccine, there's almost reason to, get covid anyway get case sniffles die."" Serious question.

Is anything happen would convince vaccinated people need wear masks anymore? would take say ""this over"", least enough fully vaccinated people act like April 2020 anymore?

Covid eradicated globally? Everyone country vaccinated people coming country require proof vaccination? What?  USA definitely Alabama 1st world.   Yeah, CDC says. thing is, recommendation, mandate. sick mandates blame local government officials business owners. SF Bay Area. I'm sure said that, position northeast that's far removed truth. people got damn shots could panned way everyone. vaccines prevent vast VAST majority people serious outcomes

Long COVID makes avoiding virus worthwhile even vaccinated. yet seen confirmation break-through infections cause lingering symptoms.

That said, layered, well-fitting cloth masks made per CDC recommendations perfectly fine reducing transmission, particularly well-vaccinated communities, and/or combined reasonable distancing. Even poorly fitting ones still reduce viral load expelled.

When people slam “cloth masks,” never know thinking cheap, stretchy single-layer masks flooded stores. accept questioning those. Nope won’t look forward hits hard like second dose did.

I 3rd dose (Pfizer) week ago. confirm comment, hits pretty hard. 2nd dose mild tolerable. 3rd dose much formidable, ~3x worse 2nd dose. Nope week? State deaths cases flatlined highish level. going since start August. That's 2-3 weeks. analysts noted 2 month cycle Delta, though every case, UK notable exception. hand-wave plausible explanation people may susceptible infection, social networks uniform, seems take 2 months burn social networks. Maybe, maybe not.

I've looking 10 weeks State, based vaccination rates, ongoing numbers vaccinated per week, true previously infected rates, number remaining uninfected. figured 10 weeks needed get 85%+ population either sick stabbed. We'll see. may take bit longer. may need reach 90% total population.

People get angry feel someone blowing smoke asses. Gottleib appears unfounded optimism going case. sir you, you! Wouldnt every state? Deaths didnt really pick summer 2020, delta.     less effective? Every country undercounting, let’s agree one wants admit      OK, going recognize difference “and” “rather than”? Or?  still 3 months!  study included cloth masks surgical masks. Surgical masks 35% effective people 60, less effective younger folks. Makes sense. world proper caution 2020, 21 many places decided simply done effort. Freedom die vs. freedom live.  they’re rewashable making cost effective people can’t afford surgical masks meant single use? I’ve seen boxes surgical masks sold least $20 Pretty sure getting moderate severe case COVID fuck gestation lot vaccine. Lots head nodding ""mmmhmmm""s.   I’m sorry I’m sure reference to.  honestly don’t know like that. like totally different man. 

He even tried persuade sister taking jab. Well thankfully listen him, vaccinated now.  Maybe Windex95 turning 95 tomorrow  Masks punishment; attempt save lives. need masks long disease transmission high. People die. People continue die. 

**LUCKILY**, vaccines prevent VAST majority people kind serious outcomes, serious breakthrough infections almost exclusively elderly immunocompromised. 

The vaccines job allowing majority population go lives minimal risk profile, science says. categorized vulnerable, continue taking precautions account **unique situations** beyond needs majority vaccinated population. 

My problem people never going satisfied *zero* risk. holding fantasy Covid eradication even though nearly every single scientist saying achievable goal contagious virus animal reservoirs. rational people come state accepted latent minimal risk foreseeable future, go life understanding, freak they're living unrealistic nonsense standard pursuing zero risk profile. 

AS science, take look what's said scientists politicians GLOBALLY. Heck even Surgeon General came weeks ago saying need realign expectations, end pandemic *not* mean zero covid, zero cases. UK, Norway, Denmark, others dropping Covid precautions telling populations we're going learn deal ongoing minimal risk. 

You're going probably want try work accepting that.  effectiveness types masks?  think surgical masks comfortable struggle get fit gap cheeks surgical mask. I've opting cloth mask seem seal better. know longer ways I'm hopeful open borders normalcy October next year. Wife planning travel Bathurst 1000 race weekend.

Ya, really LONG ways fine - actually happens, think 1 year ago today thought we'd right now. One egregious sealions banned yesterday.  No, data released government Ontario. study done someone hospital Ontario made mistakes vaccine counts probably access data government does. info released study published. Commenters insisting molnupiravir ivermectin thing. 4 year old could look picture two say they're different. Youtube really needs report option misinformation. Exactly!! better treatment well  experience Walgreens book covid vaccinations FDA overrule anything. FDA advisors recommended boosters based age + preexisting conditions occupational hazard. FDA recommended later on. CDC advisors recommend based occupational hazard (but recommended people preexisting conditions). CDC overruled CDC advisors single item (occupational hazard) making decision line FDA.  it’s like dude knew said comments Delta would arrive month turn things back heads.

He known. happened affluent countries us. obvious, like Thanos, inevitable. Well, that's direct reason work, least part it, would go fixing issue? countries shown better ways get good vaccine coverage go those?  Went couple times, always roller derby probably didn’t get accurate view. That's lot less issue US EU allowed pharma company produce vaccine instead rigidly enforcing patents That's....not good. Possibly whole lot people osteoporosis hit certain age, particularly women  Biden administration Tuesday ordered Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey stop using state’s federal pandemic funding pair new education grants directed schools without mask letter Ducey, Treasury Department said grant programs “not permissible use” federal funding. It’s latest attempt Biden administration push back Republican governors opposed mask mandates otherwise sought use federal pandemic funding advance agendas.   remember going wife nice restaurant Sunday night first moved thinking “wow, it’s dead here.”

Then tried order drink…   Especially security firm requires use halberds, uncommon skill. Sunk cost fallacy. Pride. Hard admit wrong. Moderna also applying half-dose booster Pfizer's booster thing first two. with? called egocentrism, usually kids grow age 6-7 Americans even wearing masks apropos. majority Hoosiers sure hell aren’t. Wait, many vaccines require multiple doses. Nobody actually recommending boosters every six months forever.    True dat. breakthrough infection cases tragedies. Covid erectile dysfunction joke somewhere, methinks. somewhat safety. plenty safety data first round shots, companies put legwork prove boosters still safe. would take actual education, real facts. difference Civil War taught south parts country mind-blowing. 

In experience, lived parts country also deep south state, cultural divide enormous. 

Before non-southerner get southerner listen them, kiss massive amounts ass. grovel gibber praise south high heavens, celebrating unique culture special wonderful is, it’s much better everywhere else. There’s extraordinary sense state regional pride I’ve never seen anywhere else. many southerners genuinely believe live best place world, cannot imagine things might better elsewhere. 

Honestly, think it, think lot southerners can’t imagine things might better. Sure, boss man might treat like shit, you’ll get tossed onto scrap heap minimal retirement, that’s way is. Don’t let union hucksters fool thinking things different.  fairness, Delta already running rampant point knew matter time became dominant strain. time, ""vaccine-evading"" ""game changer"" variants media tried push disappeared. Lambda, Mu, C.1.2, others ceased exist Delta much efficient mutating. Scott Gottlieb said TV recently, subsequent VoCs likely stem Delta lineage, making easier develop targeted boosters. even time still appear necessary existing formulation. CDC reported vaccines 80% effective stopping infection(1), underselling them. Meanwhile, large study Bangladesh(2) showed surgical masks 10-15% effective stopping infection. masks certainly useful, vaccination far better I'd rather somebody unmasked vaccinated masked unvaccinated.

1)  find post article better matches claim title. I’m gunna pull Gottleib make predictions everything I’ve seen - Mu Lambda pretty much dead water. 

The UK excellent job detailing variants country everything shown shows Mu Lambda competing Delta rate. theory, variants could potentially “eradicated” sense worry really won’t anywhere spread. 47 sequenced cases Mu 8 Lambda all-time UK. 

Source: 15-17, 21, 23-24 help put things perspective. 

Obviously could wrong, saying anything definitively, don’t see variants concern Delta around.  real Surgical Masks? see local stores NONE say Surgical Masks N95 (P95) rating them. ""Surgical Masks"". would take chances three/four layer cloth masks took chances unmarked ""Surgical Masks"". No. correct. correct immunity heightened period antibodies system (same vaccines). 

Do think would normal system consistently produce covid antibodies indefinitely? waste body's resources. upon reinfection, simply produce antibodies, boosting immunity COVID.

Now, might worrying given news vaccinated individuals catching covid ""breakthrough"" cases. SIGNIFICANT noise actually getting ""infected"" given many locations daily COVID testing. Many people go test negative days later symptoms all.

This might problem thinking efficacy vaccine variants. study referencing SPECIFICALLY says decrease efficacy due Delta.

This body works. normal. study says vaccine 90% effective preventing hospitalizations 6 months. going produced antibodies quick enough prevent severe infection. south ever anything seething pit ignorance? say someone lives Louisiana I'm embarrassed daily this. Sorry, mistake. correct months later really took off. Februrary inflection point was, things started picking again. likely Delta. yes, April obviously full force there. 

And think painfully obvious well May going huge number would never vaccinate.

The point, need crystal ball see future. enough factors well play painfully obvious yet time start setting Mission Accomplished banner.  Perhaps. 

Point being, I’m explaining “natural immunity” isn’t important vaccine immunity, scientifically speaking.

This. deserves headline. material masks made of. us can't though. I'm allowed ever get boosters damage dose #2 did, well actually immune system it. Remember experience one everyone has.

We need make progress minor flu (which also deadly sometimes). need antivaxxers forced we'll never get 'bout sums Mandatory quarantine means country closed. Full stop. one take quarantine travel unless it’s absolutely necessary get somewhere. Personally, enormous glut disposable masks environment kinda horrifies me. bad enough seeing cloth masks ground there. I'd much rather wear something reusable even effective I'm vaccinated Moderna reasonably low risk. Yeah states pattern august peak. less vaccinated states still hit harder though. Easy. cheapest, least restrictive, thinnest therefore least intrusive way follow letter mandates without actually impacting comfort pocketbook meaningful way. 

I'm fully comfortable level protection vaccines provide others. Beyond I'm going bare minimum follow letter mask mandate. care less cloth masks effective options, literally care. Africa thanks you.  Yep. risk management. KN95s reserve times I'll big crowds travelling state (although largely put activities hold delta's raging). trip store town?

Despite fluke thing happened &amp; others, I'm incredibly pro-vaccine. Every vaccine history small number recipients reactions like mine, they're necessary greater good. say recent parent tried time vaccine specifically 2nd 3rd trimester (no studies published time pregnancy COVID vaccines), since one side effects fever. Fever one dangerous things unborn baby early pregnancy one common side effects vaccine. time, getting COVID pretty much guarantee fever, distancing control that.

Yeah, that’s don’t buy tbh. going plane something, I’d get better one, running store, cloth mask fine.  D.C resident here. New infections remain high here, daily death low. current daily death rate .06 people per day. Given population almost 700,000, easy things feel normal one person dying every two days average.

That said, mask mandates strictly adhered population prevents things feeling truly normal. Indoor masking pretty much universal I'd say 99% 10,000 people gathered Women's March last Saturday masked. Seeing many people masked outside pretty impressive considering hot, humid people marching. Despair, Inc.

What stupid article right 🤦‍♂️ ""It's soon tell"", seems like appropriate answer since Fauci doctor fortune teller, anyway controversial statement? clearly wants focus immediate problems speculate may may right thing months now. “Partly due Delta”

From study: [Reduction vaccine effectiveness SARS-CoV-2 infections time probably primarily due waning immunity time rather delta variant escaping vaccine Yes SOOO much danger. vaccines give plenty protection without mask. Besides, ones always saying unvaccinated die? biggest problem anti-vaxxing crowd also anti-mask anti-quarantining, anti-social distancing. get - trust new vaccine (setting aside works 20 years, tested people lot commonly given vaccines) whatever reason personal choice. However, vaccinated, continuing go life normal, taking choices away people. - skip vaccine want - wear mask minimize contact people numbers go down. makes Trump hack? us give shit people though. Wearing mask hard. Lmao  CDC changed recommendations explicitly advise vaccine pregnant women *August*. absolutely Thalidomide-type concerns.

Many doctors, obviously, kept recommendations line CDC.

I find frustrating women keep blamed ""vaccine hesitant"" advice changed matter weeks ago. 

We argue whether CDC cautious, reasonable women follow advice national authorities doctors. Nice bit fear mongering MSM! Yeah Ive seen target, Walgreens, Menards,home Depot Meijer. getting fake vax card federal offense now? report FBI this. Part differences 65+ camp supposedly vaccinated dead alpha wore invincible feeling younger generations (boomers/gen x/older millennials) face delta.  is. friends/family vaccinated. Post surge I’ll go back living life. Facebook  feedback much appreciated. I've loosely considered Huntsville end southeast again. Mainly big without big, got hills bordering city loosely remind grew northern California. 

I've heard quite sources comes lgbt, lot people quietly support ""lifestyle"" choices, frequent churches preach hatred it, choose speak rock boat. I've also heard lot promiscuity hypocrisy churches south too. seems like least likely landing point still stay open it.  Also lot doses mRNA shots given there's data work with.  Anyone die virus. young, healthy 18 year olds dying this. ""vulnerable""? No. ""unique situation"", trying go school. 

My problem got people like acting like ""we already done supposed do, rules apply us anymore"". Look, want much anybody else. Unfortunately, pretending like over, clearly doing, actually going make over. see type thinking much Reddit. Everyone wants ""follow science"" like science saying anymore.   data J&amp;J booster trials looking pretty good would nice jump vaccine that's constantly months behind everyone else comes research. mention, tired would be.  great news! term ""theory mind"" fits beautifully described. ability understand people observe interact world ways separate yourself. 

You test theory mind young children watch hide object box close box lid. another adult come room. Ask child new adult knows what's box.  


Kids age roughly 5 usually say adult knows what's box (the kid) saw assume others share knowledge experiences. state can't buy alcohol, sure greatest.     One day keeps complete breakdown away. Even NPR covered it..  Hopefully parts world mostly vaccinated same. way deal virus vaccination widespread.  real tragedy 5-10% vaccinated people dying. probably weakened immune systems vaccine would've marginally useful. depending community immunity instead personal immunity. community failed them. Finally good see report friend twice someone called liar it.  hope aren’t science journalist irl. ;)

Ok, going get mud-slinging contest here? simply trying explain original person claiming discrepancy was. edible might bad idea either. Easier said done. system several layers rules paperwork anyone leave wanted to. want get care belligerent, still entitled care. Hospitals stuck patients.  long term elimination realistic target. Short term fantastic policy especially last year saved countless lives. we've seen borders reopened covid cases inevitably come country cause deaths. way NZ eliminate virus long term whole wirld eliminates covid happening least anytime soon. unless NZ never plans allow tourists basically impossible stay covid free. vaccinations way forward vaccinate many people possible especially high risk way open inevitably another surge cases deaths/hospitlisations least remain relatively low comparison.   Yeah, I'll believe see it. Remember things getting better late spring early summer? Don’t bigger fish fry right now, Alex Jones?  Thank you, hadn’t come across yet. feel like brought talking vaccination rates    That's true, there's big difference one group trying keep one another healthy, another group everything sabotage safety groups.  Maybe get bunch democrats tell get vaccinated. contrarian enough run right vaccinate. It’s “stable” natural immunity. people get COVID-19 receive protection reinfection – natural immunity nonexistent. recent study found 36% COVID-19 cases result development SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. people different levels illness – moderate disease, asymptomatic experienced severe Natural immunity decay within 90 days. Immunity COVID-19 vaccines shown last longer. Pfizer Moderna reported strong vaccine protection least six Studies ongoing evaluate full duration protective immunity, including Johnson &amp; Johnson Real-world studies also indicate natural immunity's short life. example, 65% people lower baseline antibody infection begin completely lost COVID-19 antibodies 60 Israeli study suggesting natural immunity stronger? Infectious diseases expert James Lawler, MD, MPH, FIDSA, carefully evaluates study design retrospective Maccabi Health System study Aug. 31 briefing. briefing, identifies two concerning sources error corrected for: survivorship bias selection Furthermore, country globe natural infection natural immunity brought pandemic control. countries like Iran Brazil high levels natural infection prevented recurrent waves Lots space-focused employees elsewhere, don’t feel remotely invested Alabama (and often kids resent there, GTFO soon graduate high school). 

Lots native Alabamans, particularly space field, tend feel lot Alabama pride. ones work space field lived elsewhere time, eyes opened quite much mess Alabama (although always mention missed food). 

Alabama weird place. much bizarre unjustifiable state pride. Football fucking religion - it’s surreal experience. Remember everyone freaking saying football season going cause giant spike?

In particular, remember everybody's discomfort video packed Virginia Tech game month ago? Virginia's cases lower then.

Negatrons spent time talking vaccines work yet surprised they're actually working. time stop letting people make completely baseless unscientific negative predictions letting slide name ""well can't blame people scared &lt;3""
