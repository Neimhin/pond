I'm disagreeing. Bill Gates implying testing America broken. not. America best testing infrastructure world. thing that's working right now. Testing capacity nothing failure leadership idiocy population. Ok and? severe cases ""test positive""? http://www.chronline.com/community/the-gates-foundation-aims-its-massive-bank-account-and-disease-fighting-expertise-at-covid-19/article_620481d4-f066-11ea-a893-3ba836bfd8c3.html saying locked people apartments like China? would go well America lol. Zero Covid strategy FTW!! Actually 1 250k. study 1 5000. something could it... billions dollars...  time 10 supercomputers able take leukotriene C4. Everything backwards year. first case person MS. second question mark. there‚Äôs third yeah. believe sitting inside closed air/recirc air environments real problem. IMO patios fine. risk zero, think area case rate accelerating, patio seating acceptable risk. see parking lot Bengston‚Äôs today!!! also false positives! can't invent something thin air leverage. Rapid tests already exist companies. California 15K too. feel you. sounds like terrifying virus! Let's shut country boys nice B-but long term effects!! I‚Äôll tell what‚Äôs outrageous....  Korea conducted 2.2 million tests total. 

Yeah, contained outbreak beginning... functional government. Unlike Americans three basic things need slow spread. 

Because citizens selfish irresponsible citizens fucking retarded.

Welcome yet another reason left US decade ago. Yeah unfortunately that‚Äôs happened NY. Social isolation masks good kids. take scientist know that. Cool beans! incredibly rare conditions happen FUCKING BLUE could easily coincidence.

except condition ""supposed"" happen 1 100,000 people.

how big covid study? Western countries, number new episodes per year estimated 0.89 1.89 cases per 100,000 people**. Children young adults less likely affected elderly: risk increases 20% every decade Men likely develop Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome women; [relative men 1.78 compared condition caused flu vax stop 1976, outbreak swine flu, [influenza virus subtype [Fort New Jersey caused one death, hospitalized 13, led mass immunization program. program began, **the vaccine associated increase reports of** [**Guillain-Barr√© cause paralysis, respiratory arrest, death. immunization program ended approximately 25% population United States administered vaccine. Wishful thinking - hit October's end. Mitch McConnell...um, no! Waste time energy. He's also one individuals planet enough resources fix he's complaining about. concerns expresses purely performative unless actually something it. fall bullshit  Billionaires wringing hands helplessly account. Feels good!  bank thinking? I'm really fence do. may corona college campus. mild symptoms: slight headache, tiredness, little trouble breathing, chills. tested negative Wednesday I'm still experiencing symptoms want go back. Part care negative effects going back I'm failing chem school pushing me. Would crying wolf ask another test? extend quarantine? huge burden college rn, bring meals mail teachers make special accommodations me. thinking taking family restaurant (and sitting outside wearing masks otherwise) first time since February next week. think restaurants problem general, referring specific behavior? shouldn‚Äôt lift restrictions zero case recorded, otherwise cycle repeat itself. Exactly common sense using. However, go beach away everyone. packed really hard find place away people miles Santa Cruz We‚Äôve met deductible 100% plan after, I‚Äôm sure insurance flat covered didn‚Äôt pay simply deductible met Could post link videos? seen videos people Wuhan previously violated quarantine forcibly dragged homes go quarantine center, wrong upsetting watch it‚Äôs different welding people inside homes. 

I keep hearing claim, never legitimate sources confirm actually happened. Same. earned deserve freedom. precautions taking? Curious family member wants fly soon planning safely. precautions taking? Curious family member wants fly soon planning safely. US particular going big problem getting people follow current social norms working socializing sick. 

Yeah, pandemic shown us anything, ""attendance culture"" sickening society. cut lot worker benefits would keep sick people home sake profit, bite us end something like happens. definitely disagree.  Oh my... I'm going every concert next summer. wearing mask I'll say it. people die social distance forever. ban alcohol we'd save lives too. I'm LA results usually 24 hours. two days 6 times i've gone matter select few, even 90%, right thing. know non-trivial percent (even 1% non-trivial) wrong thing, need plan that. Unfortunately way likely actual lockdown, current administration would never implement.

If expectation good, everyone else like you, successful manager. Managing 10-person team challenges. Managing 300-million-person nation nightmare. got done Florida pay $140 cash it. boss paid work doctor‚Äôs office. couldn‚Äôt every Monday. sucked. think people enjoy feeling moral superiority masks provide, crazy fucking buy election, Bill. know full well party get Corona control, yet sit political sidelines make stupid fucking statements like this. Either shut up, get busy pouring billions national, state local elections oust Reds. republicans 35 million 2010. AKA, afternoon charity funding you. husband pilot well LOA months. enjoying time off, can‚Äôt wait start traveling fun. It‚Äôs killing stuck long. fortunate closer retiring we‚Äôve ‚Äúhouse order‚Äù quite years. It‚Äôs rough though many. What? Safety protocols work? Thermal imaging work? nose swabs 100% accurate? can't let politicians give  quite normal US. India almost every result comes 2 days test coronavirus.

In US test takes 1 2 weeks normally. much bureaucracy follow actually procesing results.
I lived US Bush Obama era. getting report 2 Weeks wonder.

It's Trump.  Go live Beijing mask rest life  ""Slippery slopes myth"" says guy insisted needed 15 days flatten curve back March üòÇ wait movie That's completely true. rich get time nights party, apparently. Exactly million tests day give accurate picture covid spread US whole. Lol wearing condoms. 19? make decision like crow prepared? Personally, I'd lean toward crow, lettuce tomato. idfc. give shot never hear words ""social distance"" life. zoom happy hours sitting giant chalk circles isnt me. sorry. learned chemo brain. makes feel better I‚Äôd I‚Äôm chemo lol that? go raw strangers? too, that's risky Alright so... something it. Dude wealth half country We‚Äôre lucky Seattle UW spearheaded initial testing efforts nationwide personally think completely reasonable version ""learning live it"" spread area low amounts. US particular going big problem getting people follow current social norms working socializing sick. Pls dm well. Thanks India already given up. people die lockdown anything coronavirus throw us Korea conducted 2.2 million tests _total_. 

The reason seems like testing better controlled spread early. Testing contact tracing work spread slow. US massive testing capacity since start summer still can't keep demand Americans three basic things need slow spread. 

My point here, Bill Gates, there's nothing lacking _testing_. We're lacking leadership, coordination fucking buy government population. testing infrastructure massively dwarfs Korea's testing infrastructure. need much citizens fucking retarded. California responsible another 13 million tests. Last checked California state tests daily. 

That said, per capita tests tell different story. CA still average, pales comparison states like NY Rhode Island. think step journey humans. used migrate food, used work 80 hour weeks, used get sick time. Hopefully situation positive changes: better personal infectious disease prevention resulting increases quality life economic output. coming australia, whos land locked tourism one covid import triggered national lockdown ""elimination"". lol. gonna dawg pay people triggers fucking shit politicians. Much easier let things run amok make dollar stock market, skimp UE benefits blame others it. dare Bill Microsoft Gates, lecture us Americans getting medical treatment efficiently. Next going probably talk medical care expensive ü§¶üèª. Well Mr. Gates, I'll know good 30% voting Americans, that's close one-third case maths bad, want anything ""free"". We're Americans means pull bootstraps work day long. People want need know Dear Leader, Donald J Trump, everything needs, wants, more. heard golfing lately, rich, fix him. digress. 
We want need coronavirus testing efficacy, even want Medicare all. Free stuff losers Trump loser, ask him, he'll tell you. Bill, ‚úäüèΩ.  yet still top 10 world deaths per capita, ahead Israel UK and...everywhere else. We're hanging Top 10 cases per capita, we're starting slip behind Brazil Israel. Maybe test even more, find cases get top! USA #1! plan, experience, enact it. moral failing. know many regulations FDA? known tombstone regulations. People something heinous results regulations. Consider Nuremberg Code, Declaration Helsinki, Tuskegee, Belmont Report on. might happen today, tomorrow, consequences. History judge us. People want done badly, feel like generally really really bad calculating risks. in-laws today social distanced lunch/hangout backyard. constantly walk closer me/almost go way social distance - drives nuts back away/dodge weave act like I'm crazy. then, end mother-in-law sudden goes ""I know rules oh well"" starts coming hug. literally jumped backwards like would stop! sure enough goes hugs wife (her daughter) gave let happen.

I get family want hug, parents high-risk (old + lung issues), parents also meet outside distance even higher risk (immuno-compromised + asthma). go hug me, making much nervous seeing parents.

Idk get it. Like, hit 200k cases kids going school weather getting cooler reason people acting like somehow less risky point. True look history like third 4th recent covid type pandemic  Lmao imagine delusional This. Small family run thing trust. cooks name building usually trust going things right. Vs underpaid person large chain. 17 days NYC - July. Felt useless lol. things pandemic?  problem. Damn  common ages filling beds women 20-29 men close second data range 

That also incorrect.

This graph shows age distribution Confirmed Cases, Hospitalizations.

\~66% confirmed cases 40, age groups rarely become severe cases. say? mods censored him. Boondocks here. Still great salary. Minimum wage workers area make monthly me, without benefits insurance. delete account never spread dumb thoughts indeed spent millions developing tests vaccines Covid? Oh, totally misunderstood conspiracy theory was. assumed thought period 0 infections false, you‚Äôre actually doubting times government saying lots infections. right? University Illinois actively working rolling spit test ones it. think long places them. bring politics this? ever going this? way us behave states, plan never happen, vaccine eventual treatment that‚Äôs equivalent Tamiflu glue hold us together yet next pandemic comes. we‚Äôve handled one, I‚Äôm fearful another deadly contagious, baby Ebola Covid. 2 cases, first one doctors determined undiagnosed. 2nd I'm sure seems like coincidence point. Hopefully that's whole point it? Flattening curve preserve hospital capacity? vast majority cases mild, panicking number cases? need focus makes severe case, treat it, protect vulnerable allowing everyone else go back lives. read anywhere second case TM, someone point it? never know worth was. extra treatments percent people dying much lower know many people died locked down. People estimate know sure. absolute enemy society reddit. I've learned assume everyone referring USA unless specified otherwise. people living heap dumb shit leading major second wave put much worse spot rest country . 
  
 mean hotel quarantine, right? Based. Derp herp blurp

What Sweden guyz. ...  I‚Äôm currently living Victoria say happily take another month lockdown means normal summer. I‚Äôm 21 years old wish nothing able hangout friends (I haven‚Äôt seen person 3 months). I‚Äôm also glad country live kept deaths relatively low. economy taking big hit economies brought back, unfortunately people cannot. Dude stfu. seems sort odd CDC made couple significant changes past couple days actually make sense. wonder something changed.  giant research university that's committed ton resources testing. Without UIUC, seeing result times am. Go hard go home! I'll take one obvious reason please Always article says so? said we‚Äôre idiots.

I KNOW we're idiots. human, least know don‚Äôt know.

Well literally said models 'fundamentally flawed', statement seems imply know something experts governments around world evidently know. Perhaps tell acting smug pretending I‚Äôm saving lives.

I think I'm saving lives. think following prescribed guidelines putting faith elected officials ability listen scientists internet randos. They're ones potentially saving lives. Time tell whether approach correct not. Masks containing droplets, aerosols Cases nowhere go up. Even extensive testing people following protocols, still new cases.

We increasing Labor Day, things generally stagnated. increase leveled off. decide travel around? vacationing, work, family obligations... That‚Äôs actually happened all, virus leaked hotel quarantine returning travellers. Still governments fault never less definitely result ‚Äòlaying restrictions early‚Äô people ‚Äòdoing dumb shit‚Äô - states similar numbers May/June opened similar pace, Victoria got unlucky Live Northern suburbs Melbourne, feels like we've hard lockdown since April seems like there's light end tunnel first time long time. Starting become hopeful paychecks meant unemployment payments Literally plain English besides white-anting, Americans bad inferring meaning context? Np, get trying make Australia/NZ hugely oppressed citizens closing state borders pandemic, I've encountered few. tend assume act way political reasons, due countries chosen different paths.

Made kneejerk flex wrong way comment, take personally. Concerns too, advantages totalitarian rule. Less this, (tangentially) moreso future taking us wrt internet open be. Democracy, times deep text generation/botting, social media, huge wealth inequality going make interesting dystopian future own, imo. Total digression, yeah. agree, concerning times ahead. got aged care homes spread rapidly vulnerable people close quarters know that's lost literally said kids get I'm waiting school works come outbreak. we'll see changes mind That‚Äôs ok. Europe‚Äôs cases rise Sweden‚Äôs currently remaining low.


The EU seeing large increase cases again. 6 months (technically 5 months change guess) Ha. I'm UK citizen work criminal justice system. 6 months sick leave 18 years service. done job that. Brain body need switched on. thanks! envy Americans... Hope stay safe. Covid joke media tries portray is. month 7 ""just two weeks"" end sight. unbelievable They're Western liberal democracies, political legislative systems heavily favour business interests. go on. similarities end there. Exactly! It‚Äôs data doesn‚Äôt exist people ‚Äújust incompetent‚Äù - it‚Äôs red tape.

I don‚Äôt think American legal system, understand, would allow Trump go ahead something like that. might allow it, would receive lot push back. long term complications covid becoming apparent, managing virus numbers may also negative element ""keep open"" counter factual. 80k cases... Alaska get test results back hour. I‚Äôm going school allied health program, actually us campus two days week crazy precautions. two weeks ago made funny joke classmate said, ‚ÄúWhatever, virus airborne anyway.‚Äù classmate, also taught evidence based practice read research, also going working healthcare, clue this. 

So unfortunately, unless people paying attention, don‚Äôt know. would rooting her, Islamic extremism enabler, much worse thing Covid. However I'm really happy folks NZ least one thing worry solved while. anything, Norwegian approach used model

But Norwegian approach core Swedish one, applied better faster. Anyways, right Sweden number tests Norway Finland (proportionally) they're also protecting care homes, they're basically level. Sweden applying quarantine policies people coming outside EU whereas Norway also applies EU, bar Germany countries Eastern Europe. rest pretty much now. countries discouraging outward travels keeping soft social distancing measures, countries (and Finland) control moment. We'll see comes next. Pretty hard pick who‚Äôs bigger idiot. Boris Trump. Yes, strange started don‚Äôt believe simply binary scenario lockdown nothing outcomes generate terrible outcomes different parts community.

So start discussion suggesting alternatives? They‚Äôre jealous. Unfortunately, skeptical rushed vaccine equated antivax nowadays. several comments downvoted saying would reservations jumping first line vaccine rushed. doesn‚Äôt matter explain pro vaccinations, pro-science, want know safe vaccine take it. Literally sorts insults thrown wouldn‚Äôt want first line.  think reason US fighting summer ebbs flows covid - \*some\* people right things; staying home, wearing masks correctly, limiting public outings - there's decent part population things. Every time go store, see couple people noses masks. Sometimes people workers. least area, mask mandates literally stop door establishments; people put mask go Walmart, take soon they're inside they're challenged door. 

Plus, weather turning colder, people meeting leisure outside often. That's bad news portion population willing basic preventative measures. headline says Victoria, Australia? goal changed understanding pandemic changed:

""Everyone get infected, bodies streets"" : must flatten curve health system overwhelmed. Health workers take priority masks expense general population fail everything fails.

""Not everyone get infected, countries dealing well spread, cloth masks actually something, vaccine research looking good"" : must prevent unnecessary spread limit damage vaccine solves problem.

""The vaccine close"" : beat it. think rush ones symptoms may end needing hospitalized hospitals need know results. 100% cases .

We managed eradicate community prior this.  0 weeks lockdown Sweden done thing.  ""My delusion powerful education""

/s sad. Compassionate caring young person. Condolences friends family. congratulate Victoria. 
I read headline see world Vic things job one else do, reality Victoria fucked up. rest Aus (Well, West Aus, South Aus, Northern Territory, Tassie Queensland) pretty much eliminated community transmission 3 months, Victoria decided lay restrictions early state, people living heap dumb shit leading major second wave put much worse spot rest country also affected NSW negatively still catching cases (although minor rate).
So no. congratulations Victoria. Victoria fucked lucky able catch got hand. Except don‚Äôt care anymore. sure likelihood another lockdown UK elsewhere overseas, states thing fairy tale unless get New York hospitalization levels across whole nation. Look, American live Netherlands. local version CDC recommended masks. US politicized it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* bringing loser? Nah I‚Äôm good. think 13 people‚Äôs fee fees got hurt twice tho lol. Yep exactly. Like NZ found cases one family started second wave evening announced second lockdown one city. caught early acted hard caught within weeks see reopening path assume Dan exclusively responsible every decision made handling covid outbreak, extrapolate individual, honestly say without doubt would made perfect choices every step way shoes? infallible? Dan somehow supposed super human mistakes? 

If consider solely responsible every decision made handling covid outbreak, think reasonable lay blame solely feet?

I could wrong however suspect might somewhat unrealistic expectations. 
But explain why? serious potentially fatal illness. let spread ? Scott Morison was? Well I'm glad finally balls say it. late everyone told go back office got sick. Maybe people actually act like airborne now. Haha kidding definitely No, improved contact tracing. know clusters now. Close contacts isolate 14days. also government payments people waiting testing isolate. TM MS, highly treatable . second wave actually occurred due bio security breach.  can't, moment open border chinese toursists start pouring get 700 cases. problem lockdown, problem untill whole world free it. I'm Argentinian, lockdown 200 days still highest rates daily new cases (And irreparably damaged economy). born latin America üò≠ built another one... America facilities available testing anywhere else world

Lol 2 options. Either adequate infrastructure there. there. 8 9 months, country largest number cases, takes days able tests, means infrastructure meet demand western Australia? numbers perspective: tourism accounts 3% Australia GDP. 3%, 70% generated domestic travel. Due closed international borders, Australians travelling domestically. Regional towns states besides Victoria currently booming domestic tourism apparently highest they've ever seen (at least lot regional areas I've looking at).

You remember Australia essentially back normal. Even NSW get around 1-2 cases day, stadiums operate us 50% 40,000 people. Great end lock straight back 725 back lock LOL makes masks completely useless.

Please explain. Sweden reached 70% attain herd immunity, 20%. Spanish flu went away 20-30% so. biggest spreaders get infected first, immunity (even short term immunity) makes massive difference R value. pandemic can't spread anymore simmers small groups. haven‚Äôt inoculated 30,000 people two doses yet. Colleges put robust testing plans place quite well. I‚Äôm grad student we‚Äôre getting tested week, undergrads getting tested twice week. school already able identify isolate one cluster. fairly pessimistic coming things far exceeding expectations. Absolutely right, good comment really hope correct.   Liberal many fronts also fairly urbanised educated. people aus nz pretty compliant first lockdown saw work well compared relative chaos abroad. Nz Victoria similarly pretty compliant respective second lockdowns reason. It‚Äôs easier bring people along see it‚Äôs actually working linking 60 minutes video? show fucking tabloid trash. Less ignoring nothing Show vaccine efficacious long record safety I'll consider it. stands, compared disease 99.6% survival rate I'm happy take chances community low rate infection. OMG wait till one trial participants gives birth kid autism.  Indefinite lockdown lockdown. NZ fooling itself. people start entering country again, it‚Äôll back. can‚Äôt hide away forever.  Hi! actually 4 flights last month pre-existing condition wore N-95 mask throughout airport flight experience (and still quarantined 14 days after). lot research beforehand it‚Äôs likely flights get Covid airplanes filter air cabin aircraft least 20-30x hour (please see Bloomberg article research). Additionally, lot airlines try seat people apart. hesitation airports themselves, remain crowded everyone still required wear masks usually move get gate. thing would‚Äôve planned differently wear face shield goggles something protect eyes that‚Äôs cause complete germaphobe nut. 

Additionally, ‚Äúexposed‚Äù vague term. someone Covid walks grocery store time me, mean exposed? Likely yes, since both, say, wearing face masks momentarily within 6 ft infected person didn‚Äôt cough sneeze talk time, I‚Äôd say chances catching Covid less 1% despite ‚Äúexposed‚Äù. 

These educated informed conclusions drew based knowledge. urge people continue wear masks social distance matter also wanted share flight experience people aren‚Äôt terrified actually fly somewhere. safe smart. needs way upvotes!!! Thank voicing rant that‚Äôs head last couple months saying Baby Hands done anything, really think giant companies billionaire CEO‚Äôs everything help?

Who made claim? I‚Äôd wager life 1% fucks enough make look like they‚Äôre trying. 

That case Gates. really stretching many giant companies think put facade charity relishing policies laws widen socioeconomic gaps drive profits?

Why talking companies? talking power anything maintain power.

Not person topic means turning cheek struggles impoverished, that‚Äôs they‚Äôll do. It‚Äôs way long long time.

Not case, thanks?



Are really willfully ignorant topic attempting discuss? Gates arguably single example American billionaire actually helping others quantifiable results. I'd suggest read spent time money. Harsh COVID-19 lockdowns allow virus disappear population matter weeks. transmission 0, virus population within weeks. virus population, go back normal. Almost new viruses stay forever, get point matter more. Took 42 days get mine. It‚Äôs amazing still spread man‚Äôs opinion. use money power implant way influence people‚Äôs lives. Parasites, one virus. Fuck billionaire capitalist class making ‚Äúheroes.‚Äù hypocrite. hmm-I wonder one wackos infamous survey experts would feel comfortable year said would NEVER ever bring mail without taking precautions again. Thats sure want setting policy everyone. yes suppose that's worth living 100 years live Tasmania got test weekend. texted results 24 hours. yeah ive tick bite two months ago. lots sports before. 2 1/2 weeks later got sick. aweful headache week. couldnt move fever. 
not sure was, much sports caused worse.

You disagree insult me. I'm bad guy here? Okay. self entitled piece shit American pastime apparently. can't tell wearing mask right now, EVIL!!! WEAR MASK!! WEAR IT!!!!!! WEAR FOREVER FOREVER MORE, NEVER OVER, COVID FOREVER, RELEASE, PEACE, JUSTICE, EQUALITY COMPLY DIE, NAME COVID, BLM HOLY VACCINE, AMEN.




look latest deaths, see old are? pre existing health conditions? low numbers deaths are? course don't, keep regurgitating sheep food. OLD PEOPLE DIE!!!!!! OMG!!!!! LET'S SHUT ECONOMY TRUMP GONE!!!!! reddit, expect? Follow reddit logic. Mass gatherings hundreds thousands past 4 months little social distancing partial masks spread covid. Masks work, stop spread covid. woman wore mask distanced got covid. Huh? Covid-19 changing world, covid-19 isn‚Äôt new. rather, humans experiencing epidemics new. seems new because, generally speaking, human sense world encompass decades best, usually much less. Anything happened born, often anything happened children, register ‚Äúthis life‚Äù. Life experienced right now, year. Maybe last year.

When one looks human history slightly wider perspective, considering even brief time-span century, one find epidemics happened relatively often among humans. Take polio example: 1910, frequent polio epidemics became regular events throughout developed world primarily cities summer months. peak 1940s 1950s, polio would paralyze kill half million people worldwide every year.

The fear collective response epidemics would give rise extraordinary public reaction mobilization spurring development new methods prevent treat disease revolutionizing medical philanthropy. Although development two polio vaccines eliminated poliomyelitis three countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan Nigeria).
What happened likely happen again: disease emerge, everyone scared humans mobilize, invent new forms therapy, new medication, new vaccine and, eventually, disease managed controlled. new disease show up, process start again. couple years flat ridiculous. Sweden right masking better anywhere else world. seriously willing skip going movies, concerts, live sporting events, festivals several years vaccination?

Why cant go walk Target right now? often prolonged close contact strangers Target? PCR testing methodology 100% specificity. erroneous results either pre analytical errors (collecting) analytical (contamination extracting plating 364 million per day go we're there? That‚Äôs nothing. read internet pastor said bad things covid entire flock everyone know ventilators pushing daisies. ones I've taken work past month half given results 2 days. exposed mean contracted. Every time go supermarket BLM protest exposed covid. Slifka, vaccine expert Oregon Health Science University, said: ‚ÄúIf two cases, starts look like dangerous pattern. third case neurological disease pops vaccine group, vaccine may done.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt quote it, concerning claim incredibly rare condition related vaccine, don‚Äôt explain cane conclusion.

Why else would incredibly rare condition occurred?

Yeah got results 2-3 days. really wish wasn‚Äôt crapshoot long you‚Äôd wait. well known (by educated people least) anything strenuous *any* virus puts extra load body body fighting recovering. covid exclusive. Yes. Obviously per capita. I‚Äôm happy sub finally upvoting quality comments like downvoting dumb shit like one :) Yet somehow NFL test thousands players personnel every week. would start with:
There many studies television makes us intelligent. Try watching old black white tv shows. incredibly slow. least ability rapidly absorb information think critically comes media consumption.

The comments Fluoride bull. gone deep studies topic father law dentist. high quantities water supply effected children‚Äôs brain development. studies many many multiples put water supply U.S. town‚Äôs water doesn‚Äôt fluoride. kids take fluoride vitamins daily.

Some things masks may true. also thought son might learning less school everyone wearing masks.

But grand conspiracy theory conspiracy theory. point mask limit viral load virus, might breath might exhale. fact, breathing small amount virus wearing mask could allow get virus without high viral load could kill you, allowing develops antibodies based limited exposure.

We pandemic. Quit conspiracy theories protect family community. Wear damn mask protect care about.

And get better sources information... going claim great system.  
It's not.

The point trying make, 1200 done statement remotely accurate.  
Like many things, seen outside US, complicated, due way country, general, overarching laws anything.  
Most laws handled state level, almost point 51 separate small nations.  
It's ideal.

I deny every country handled better.  

I'm straight ashamed handled here.  
And best vote bastards gave us response, every level. classic Republican whataboutism. Wait, personal choice get tested someone tell to?

It's crazy either way, different kind crazy. decided become antimasker? still unclear detected viral RNA live intact virus. guess viral RNA. many people make 6+ hour line? 1 100 positive, they're likely infecting several people unless masks, wear properly, social distance carefully. bet nearly impossible keep many people properly coordinated that.

Are getting home tests Canada anytime soon? fever sore throat. ordered test, yesterday, get take home. would nice see rolled everywhere. great option. Oh dang didn‚Äôt know! Haha thanks part oligarchy top. sense urgency don‚Äôt want people get tested miss work.

Wtf talking about? I'm guessing get test results within 3-5 days compared US major city. Bruh.

""The government needs ‚Äúget testing right‚Äù soon possible, Gates continued.""

Everything else said verifiably false. I‚Äôm going to. miss seeing people‚Äôs actual expressions, whether I‚Äôm getting dirty look not. 

Plus, lived millions years planet without face masks think faired pretty well every 100yr pandemic. That's enforcement mechanism, whether nationally locally. 

In county (Texas) local sheriffs specifically said going enforce anything related governor's executive order. 

Not mention executive order punishments violating it. Great point it‚Äôs something we‚Äôve known medical field months. Patients much likely self quarantine walk ER/clinic knowing they‚Äôre COVID positive instead 3-7 days afterwards would require coordination higher level states individually do; domestic flights federal government would need coordinate something like abdicated responsibility anything. incredibly maddening. Stop bitching Bill drop fucking cash mouth is. costs 150 bucks least normal part every vaccine trial, well-publicized Covid vaccine trials. elementary teachers starting 4 years education getting 55k don‚Äôt know values from, especially since high school teachers known making more. don‚Äôt know CBE differs much cities fly work too. similar routine, also avoid United addition American. last flight early August nightmare.

Most required get tests variety reasons, including visiting LTC, work, school.

However said true, putting risk standing there. Come winter know they'll do, can't stand outside. weird parents India Australia test done day, yet got report abiut 8 hours SMS received exactly 2 days later. 2 days enough effects virus kick in? anti masker trying sow discord. Everyone look posts subs posts in. Basically 99% politicians lol, like difference republicans democrats. feel like reasonable results returned within maybe 48 hours get payed for, point incentive process tests, tests become useless certain point anyways Could please dm recommend early 20's discerning.  wtf 2 months year they've already proved reinfection within 2 months infected .. even shared wrong?

I hope got vaccine, otherwise probably able get it, till least 3 months approved. contrary, test day surgery knew results way inside period.

It's possible, profitable Canadians fly US back Canada. Americans allowed Canada unless they're super strict essential reasons.

""20 million doses"" mean enough vaccinate ten million people two doses each, mean enough doses vaccinate twenty million? seen addressed, one would think booster dose would slightly different way initial dose, immediately clear ""20 million"" means vaccinate half many. 

apologies i'm stupid. hell going happen now? People saying coronavirus would gone september worse ever. hell narrative now? expect vaccines within year? vaccines impossible. Wtf. one people.

I wonder...do people get two tests day? Otherwise that‚Äôs 1 330 people, isn‚Äôt it? first read ‚Äúcases‚Äù ‚Äútests‚Äù nearly heart attack. We're many tests per capita many active cases per capita. good thing.  That's crazy. I'm NJ drive thru tests give results minutes. hospital allows one visitor per patient per day, long visitor says covid symptoms thermal cam says fever.

But patient gets tested covid visitors result comes back.... It‚Äôs unfair!

University Illinois running 1-2.5% US tests per day, offering testing system commercially. quite sure one‚Äôs picking up. basically eliminated major outbreak week. South Korea? Even numbers 10 times would still impressive feat. You‚Äôd surprised fast opinions change. Five months ago April people thought waiting vaccine released insane ""Veracity""? I'm thinking that's REALLY wrong word.

It's much WRONG word (even though agree you)...it's meaning sentence still super ambiguous. 

Through supplemental information (member GOP, acquires news social media, probably take covid seriously have--resulting eventual death, etc.)....I figure out. that's still shoddy reporting. funding comes bag private ones. amount supposed fund homes lesser affects even public homes. UK still failing miserably.... make US population understand outstanding safety protocols place working protect us.

Since spread never starts evenly distributed that's get system overwhelmed. know is.  know CCP's fault can't control people's culinary habits.  tried, people demanded freedumbs. Eventually, CCP became weak let people open markets again.  still open exactly way Corona, SARS 1, whatever viruses created.  Now, looking famine...""the great leap forward"" part 2...Mao rides again. 100% see mask, think even rabid pro-lockdown folks see permanent social distancing insane. Yes, lost younger people strictly covid. No, there‚Äôs 2.6 comorbidity rate covid deaths. Covid nasty shows many presenting symptoms, solely blame deaths. Obviously countries like China. people like smiling wearing lip stick example. always depression loved able don‚Äôt know, see people‚Äôs faces hang groups CDC probably using Internet explorer reason comment 1000th comment so, corona bad Christmas tells people go visit across country ever dumb shit. expect cases rise soon.

üòÜ guys downvoting legit question? supposed permanently locked something? wonder else CDC behind on. lol yea small businesses, Amazon ilk. Fuck article.  Lol... that's funny. us, can‚Äôt deny people preexistion conditions anymore Obama care. And, everywhere else first world better US assume. Oh great I'll never find husband rate üòÇüò≠  Seems like run standing president. *traveling save* *money everything* selfish stupid people move goal posts? care people die flu. It‚Äôs think people wear masks sick public right idea. difference know virus people spread days showing symptoms. I‚Äôm South Korea. Hubs got tested (negative) results back 12 hours *on weekend*. Amazing.  thought dead larger virus spread back march

Yup, since authorities said fine travel Italy, need quarantine test travelers etc etc get weekly results next morning  Wuhan keep making viruses quit cramming different species top other.  NYC roughly 3 weeks unfettered maskless normal life virus spreading February-March. Tests heavily rationed virus still considered distant threat.

Some estimates put number infected city residents almost 20%. That's another 1.5 million uncounted people.  isn‚Äôt US. live England, UK partner wait 8 days results. lose private homes profit motive? Without profit motive homes able provide better service, thus able compete? already restarted again. Testing one COVID metrics absolute number important, relative population size.

What? No. Definitely not. number tests means almost nothing without accounting population, distribution testing, accompanying protocols.

Ok, let‚Äôs imagine country population 1000 people, they‚Äôre able test entire population weekly 26 weeks (26 tests per capita). would enormous amount testing population, would certainly enough annihilate virus implemented appropriate travel restrictions quarantine protocols. absolute number tests 26,000. 

Contrast country of, let‚Äôs say 330 million people. manage complete 100 million tests 26 weeks (wow big number!) that‚Äôs still 0.3 tests per capita. Also, substantial number tests frequently testing retesting government staff certain populations (hospital staff, etc) high risk exposure. majority population never tested all, many people spread virus know they‚Äôre sick (if ever), 6 months 200,000 people died far end sight.

Which country wins? one 100,000,000 tests one defeated virus? No. He's saying can't wait see age poorly believes second wave. comment saying wants people die. believes will. temperature went normal 97.0 98.2 really. slightly higher usual temp hours back normal.

My symptoms fatigue, minor chills, brief moment nausea 4am went away minutes.

After 12 hours felt totally normal again. That‚Äôs is, say anything bad ccp, delete get voted hell back. Test results available 24 hours Los Angeles. Great - people going call doctors ‚Äòscript Astelin. drive demand pricing it, much like hoarding Pepcid Tagamet. public nursing homes don‚Äôt take profits. Still fully funded. Calorie controlled diet works better working weight loss. Though alone reason work host benefits.

However, people keep fit 24-hour fitness location locally? must impossible that's died childhood 1800's right?

And people pay good money restrict VO2 intake training (even though 99% masks actually minor comfort issue best) Yesterday centre Lublin (some festivities going on), coming Portugal people still abide quite well social distancing mask wearing, Lublin looks like going herd immunity.

It packed, masks anywhere, people top other, simply back normal. outright fail, major setback. #  feel like specific idea ""busy"" hospital look like. 

I suggesting question capacity perform necessary functions--not jam-packed people. school look crowded except class changes. coming EMT, many cars. Without visitors, they'll half many cars (or fewer) normal. local hospital difficult find parking; COVID--because visitors people electronic visits.

There times multiple local hospitals capacity can't offload patients somewhere else. happening Houston July. happened NY earlier year. Parts CA sending patients 100 miles away. trying prevent kind overload. happens--it late. Everything try keep load control failed. overwhelmed, people standing line. leaving go somewhere else dispatch sending ambulances there. look like Black Friday summer blockbuster cinema.

As-is, many communities lot ""extra"" hospital beds. ""busy"" Corona. deficient ACA rules made expand modernize. Almost every hospital near expanding prior COVID. Sometimes ER wait times 4-8 hours, depending condition beds. Corona happening top normal medical needs community; infectious, takes much space testing. stack injuries certain kinds cases rooms even hallways. can't transmissible diseases; especially around elderly people people chronic health conditions, likely come hospital. Even two random people come broken arms, can't assume COVID.

I've hospital locked suspected shooter. zero people hallways. hospital still busy. 

People fighting life. Hospitals lot inadequate resources insufficient personnel. Stays taking longer need lab delays. hospitals transferring patients long distances enough local beds. Whoa. stuff without spleen? Like, live example? Don‚Äôt need spleen?  trump still president January matter wins It‚Äôs probably 50% Indians 28 Thanks, you! got mine 2 days pretty easy made appointment day 30 sec. fever symptoms? could without social media smart phones confirm, reason. Victoria, Australia still much isolated rest Australia. remember NSW close 100 roads connecting VIC. 

Not mention China-style city lockdowns.

It's doable. You‚Äôre right, type test get antibodies. already got antibody test entered trial though don‚Äôt really see point getting one. case vaccines. thing safe vaccine. Vaccine safety swept rug long time. Vaccine injuries occur, quite frequently fact. Still vast majority, math might strong suit. second patient case transverse myelitis - first patient neurological symptoms undiagnosed MS back like July something. I'm sure that's entirely correct. I'm 40s blood pressure pretty high. may chance, people ran first trial visit half least 50, couple looked least 60. looked definitely senior citizen range. 

Honestly, healthcare workers recently seemed pretty alarmed blood pressure. first appointment. still gave shot. think that's good thing. lol Macau get results back 6 hours gets immediately updated profile, chinese immigration knows covid negative travel China test per capita count returned 48h max Yes. That‚Äôs fucking nightmare. That‚Äôs bad thing


Do understand many people die happens? let virus explode possibly achieve herd immunity, let virus explode hospitals would completely overrun. far think honestly)  worked Russian politicians he'd already vaccine imported, like Cuba Venezuela did. Instead, straight refused it. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation one biggest charitable organization world. way ""Jack Shit""

He literally one biggest philanthropists world ever seen. whine little he's doing. done lately?

Edit: up, read sources too. It'll save embarrassing next time something say subject.  12 hours Vancouver  2 weeks since recent test. Still fucking results. hope trump dies COVID. anyone know covid19 causes blood clots? wear full protective body armor riding bicycle?

Deaths still happen traffic even seatbelts airbags, clearly best thing get rid cars together. /s. There's middle ground. There's nuance anything mass hysteria. I'm vaccinated, enough seatbelt airbag. people want infected, free continue practicing social distaning, wearing masks etc. get vaccinated. won't. People want get vaccinated sympathy for, want infected, they'll get vaccine soon can. I'm definitely part group would get take vaccine first anyway Bill could pay wanted... honestly waste money point wear seatbelt cars airbags? spanish girlfriend disagrees mean Q2? 12.2% NZ Sweden's 8.6% drop. seem much worse even compared country without lockdown.

Meanwhile, Sweden's closest neighbors went *lockdown* saw lower GDP drop.

'Sweden's GDP fell 8.6% second quarter year, according statistics body.

The fall sharper neighbors ‚Äî Denmark registered 7.4% fall, Finland 3.2% fall. Statistics suggest Norway also fared better cannot possibly good narrative. Really though, looking Nordic countries, focused Finland instead Sweden. far fewer per capita cases/deaths, excess deaths numbers also much lower, they've similar freedom movement Sweden since May economy seems slightly better too. live Texas got 24 hour test I'm confused too. weeks ago. Tested deep nose swab Friday, got call Saturday. girlfriend got results day, like 10 hour turn around. Thank hard work!!! wish could upvote million times. Feel free too. moment I'm vaccinated moment stop caring whatsoever wishful thinking works.

Try wipe Influenza respiratory virus. possible.  Misleading title. good job. shit ain't over. large sample size, possible included someone going get MS anyways regardless vaccine. However, 2+ people vaccine group get MS 0 placebo group, causation likely Level 3 lock people inside homes. People could still go work/school head groceries/food. 

Being level 3 2 weeks also allows return level 2/1 soon possible essentially restrictions, especially risk contacting COVID. would gladly make trade-off benefit. let get straight. want billionaires help providing services provided government? Even locked everyone isolation rooms believe nation 1.5 billion people new case load less 1 per day past month? need scientist understand 24 hour clock? availability healthcare system works, tests conducted laboratory. Wow thought results 4-5 days bad lol voters incompetent ones - get exactly deserve. China needs fact fucked world. Likely database important note though foreigners come in, New Zealanders leave either. means instead going Aussie, Pacific Islands further, New Zealanders planning holidays simply chosen extravagant local holidays within country many cases. Aside weeks pain caused Auckland's 3 week lockdown resurgence domestic tourism meant tourism industry held quite well last months things considered. probably realistic expect surge domestic travel last another year so, hopefully year's time we'll quarantine-free travel Aus countries covid-free then, vaccine. That‚Äôs pretty much what‚Äôs happening though, that‚Äôs whole point article But... 2001 next year... Pay us good job That's lockdown elimination looks like. America team. We‚Äôre close competition teams. don‚Äôt wear mark you‚Äôre failure American patriot. You‚Äôre fucking team giving every teams advantage. 

Sacrifice countrymen. Care others. Support America. team anywhere wants anytime attitude.  countries regions eradicated virus going full stream ahead next year, rest us lurching partial lockdown heavy restrictions whilst cowering homes counting dead.

Close borders. Lockdown till gone. Let's give future.

EDIT: glimpse future currently stands us UK - particularly fig. 4 p. 12 - endlessly recurring partial too, go back 30 years? Yes is. 31 million cases worldwide. 62 claims reinfection I'm Austrian doctor waited 5 days result. much that.... Well......yes, 

better first time, saying much :) Re-infection thing. 62? 31 million covid cases worldwide saying 62 reinfected. number would much higher reinfection possible. Found guy hasn‚Äôt lost family member yet. Give time China US. US reported 10 cases day, unbelievable considering little they've done curb virus. US get 10k 20k would impressive I'm central Florida, testing handled like hot potato.

[Advent Health lost 25,000 tests one one largest hospital networks Florida.

Since then, testing routed dozens intermediary private businesses, far I've seen, results improvement, there's basically nothing coming Governer's office strategy deployment fastest routes centers results.


Some labs capacity can't get state federal help, others basically twittling thumbs built capacity earlier year tests directed them.

I heard NPR (can't find article moment) labs capacity test hundreds thousands daily basically empty moment one sending tests: hospitals, local jurisdictions, federal mandates routing elsewhere due previous arrangements. There's one federal level overseeing anything nothing gets done.

It still take week get test results back point. Sometimes day, sometimes seven. hodge-podge clusterfuck administrative hot potato.

We even Disney here, sports bubble shit, test people get results HOURS public? Nope. it‚Äôs good downplay sake downplaying Whatever pathetic excuse takes hold upset accountable behavior right? It‚Äôs kinda weird trust billionaire government. Scary didn‚Äôt know Gates spent lot time money (his money) help cure hundreds thousands people preventable diseases. problem. you‚Äôre interested lot material could point wish inform yourself.  Cool rights. you‚Äôre still choosing put others risk. Instead governments responsibility it‚Äôs yours. mom dies pulling plastic tube throat seen family won‚Äôt governments responsibility yours.

All care making money pandemic. don‚Äôt care 200k died. wouldn‚Äôt care 2 million died meant would maximize profits. üôèüèª I'm person reads internet could tell years months ago. know people acting shocked indignant.

Everyone saying ""No way, can't much longer"" go watch everything available pandemic started 1918. We're repeating mistakes people taking seriously mentally adjusted fact life years. provide care cost private homes, private homes go bankrupt amount people need care suddenly rises, enough available slots public home people. Private homes need extra beds. realize people New Zealand freedoms Sweden since lockdown ended May right? Level 1/level 2 alerts NZ actually entail less restrictions current restrictions recent 'lockdown' change that. Auckland one enter level 3 *two weeks*, rest country level 2, still allowed meet groups 100. group size restriction still 50 Sweden?

Still, I'll point obvious irony - consider recent restrictions NZ lockdown, Sweden also lockdown. Tourism generally bit problem. provides mostly low quality, minimum wage jobs locals, distorting property markel, particularly AirBnB. favours wealth holders wealth creators, much like extractive industries oil farming. puts strain environment, though provide incentive keep things nice. Tourists give almost nothing socially local community, whilst gaining thinist veneer cultural exposure.

Tourism restricted rich (as used be), less it, better managed, different. Well look US, Europeans place self made men, trying something, maybe failing trying again. (bankruptcy laws different EU)

But seems US changed maybe wrong impression? Took hour Houston. confirm completely mandatory law self isolate close contact (near enough person whilst infectious) covid person... 

Casual contact (e.g like OP) compulsory self isolate. would direction state health authorities...

That said, folks still work home anyway public backlash would enormous forced anyone work concerned risk contraction. China going doctor numbers least make believably low. China way 1 billion people - 10k 20k per day I‚Äôd suggest make instead would seem amazing would impress test Friday, took 6 hours result. guys getting tested? still seasonal. Sure case Florida. Yeah, see many people complain ‚Äúnothing improved six months‚Äù regarding COVID boggles mind people blatantly ignore much know didn‚Äôt March terms treatment virus itself. It‚Äôs like nothing them. reading couldn‚Äôt find it.  happen quote hand? realize PCR Test flawed highly unreliable?

The Pandemic based Test entirely possible, number Covid deaths inflated, Test.

Besides that, PCR Test suited diagnose, say whether someone infected, infectious, indicator hospitalizations deaths.

Here example that, entirely justified skeptical new rushed vaccine, new technology.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: studies long term effects Covid? different flu respiratory illnesses cause? much damage caused treatment i.e. ventilators, wrong drugs etc? SSI good job updating numbers every day. Paywall Ha ha - Anna, abrupt expression online good jarring... üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è yep. aren‚Äôt answers yet many lab results keep coming back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Auckland moved level 3 *2 weeks*. rest country level 2 period.

The biggest restrictions level 2 basically involved wearing mask, following social distancing guidelines group sizes 100. comparison, Sweden restrictions sans masks, albeit limited group sizes level 3, businesses schools left open restrictions people stay within household bubble. mentioned, lasted 2 weeks Auckland only. big deal making funny majority New Zealand still enjoyed freedoms recent 'lockdown' countries one. seems like good thing though, applauded? inability. Unwillingness. makes Bill Gates expert pandemics?


Genuinely asking name always comes sources please  inhabited parts Sweden pretty densely populated. I'm surprised Disney making deals reopen hit top trending.people calling fact OC Twitter lying cases going Ah ok. would interesting know countries made mandatory reliant individual company policy. exists hospitals work they're used confirm patient covid cases patient suspected I'd get long version too.  narrative within Germany often ""Our healthcare system downsized much close ruins"", 

The comments/questions quest missed important point, ""Look Germany good well"".

There lot sweden bashing going people easily read comments defences up. Especially people go normal lives waiting test results

Maybe takes long? told stay home waiting result. takes 24-48 hours. (Norway) least Australia 
(Or perhaps least Sydney, knows Victorians doing)

I think dependent company policy think, folks knew pretty accommodating early days lots things cancelled cause people contact covid-19. 

I'm pretty sure itd mandatory though.  hurts, afford country. loss international tourists made domestic tourism, yeah tourism industry pretty sore. CDC studies favor school reopening may fairly suspected bias. reference directly contradicts claim: ""a recent report Shenzhen, China, showed proportion infected children increased outbreak 2% 13%, suggesting importance school closure."" would suggest refraining bandying claims youth immunity. historically low mortality 2019 continued first months 2020.
Heard harvest effect? I‚Äôm Victoria.

I seriously doubt eliminate virus lockdown prove delayed inevitable.  dad already saying thinks fine host thanksgiving put again, like fire. live Victoria. 

I honestly believe ever eliminate virus. spread far amongst community Victoria suspect open return. Mistakes made early epidemic. one disputes that. 

Hopefully gotten better protecting them, many chronically-underfunded facilities meager Medicaid payments can‚Äôt cover significant additional costs Covid requires. 

Universal health care human right. flight

Is train take ocean or...? true. 7 countries populations 1 million higher per capita testing. noted US highest per capita death rate countries drives test demand.   ... Donald Trump send United States back 1960s. get another outbreak tomorrow, start new lockdown? seem sustainable. Neil Ferguson‚Äôs seal stamp approval numbers?   October 1, airlines lay tens thousands crew members cancel lot routes Feel them, state closed salons, barbers etc? weird. *Over there* seems like ""do want live life?"". sure simple that, fact people *over there* choose potential death guaranteed poverty/crime/begging/gofundmes criminal..

I feel sorry lot. Humans deserve government cares... whatever have. lockdowns like earlier anymore. Instead test everyone, isolate infected, immediately reopen.  can't take risks exist. dating rest gov Crazy. gf Gatineau got tested thursday still hasnt received results.

Edit: antivaxxer, delusional definition. leadership. take 2 years giving everyone. 1st key people (police doctors politicians old people) later people like you.
The key part people still get infected dying lower numbers. gov decide lockdowns over. Gates ZERO involvement tech. literally specifically said government response problem mentioned nothing health care workers. Honest god people become insufferable. Stop constantly fighting people side.

But . . . US STILL testing enough. mention, testing results take week, rendering test nearly useless stated. Actually let low information people know issue people situation cautious. afraid, CAUTIOUS. big spike late May. data easily accessible you. incubation 3 months.

You know, deaths doesnt happen instantly....
It takes time initial hit spread.
This issue, could actual almost though Finland's lockdown prevented deaths.

Maybe did, stuill option fyi, 2019 less 90k matter excess deaths counted 2019 only. uses average past 10 years, means 'under morality' argument relevant + (89k)]/10 = 91.7k. average death count excess deaths counted close 2019 numbers 'under mortality' anything trivial factor.

If thousand deaths less one year, one could assume higher deathtoll next say New Zealand's economy hit less hard? Again, did, free quote I'll admit wrong. can't you?

You're going lockdown hurtig economy, UK dropped 20% Q2, links show relatively similar, albeit slightly higher Sweden. also difference that's smaller difference GDP losses Q2 2020.

Could Finland redundant economy (i dont know), clearly seen lockdown hurt ones economy.
Look italy, spain, UK etc. taken massive economics hits, said, none data linked comes close showing lockdown damages economy. really, what's point?

It does, Finland obviously outlier.
Otherwise look nation lockdown clearly see lockdown hurt economy using trade services actually involves domestic trade use actual breakdown 2019:

Internal trade hurt, foreign trade hurt trade stop.
Why hard understand? rely service industry similar levels. New Zealand, whose tourism sector makes bigger % service industry, hardest hit. see trend reflected GDP drop Q2 2020. Again, deflecting main point - exactly figures show lockdowns hurt economy?

Because people can't work...
If can't make/sell stuff can't earn money...
Are saying UK, italy spain made fine?
They every disease, would still COVID death factors listed co-morbidities. That's counted every part world Sweden outlier.

Yes, Sweden obvious counted test large this? know health agency frequently adjusts numbers, quite often downwards, accurate.

Haha
And complain make statments xD
Sweden havent adjusted numbers.
Seems bone pick Sweden? Swede hurt saying same? study wrong, interpretation 70% count COVID death wrong. I've given link explain is.

That's im saying throw stones make idiotic statments pandemic everyone done adjustments facts make complaints people use Sweden comparison lockdowns work? I'm clarifying misinformation them. 

Again, Sweden didnt option lockdown...
And lockdowns obviously work, question effective really damage economy. temporarily restrict movements, many post-lockdown countries enjoyed same, more, freedoms countries so. also absolute work minimizing cases/deaths (NY good example), followed population complies social distancing guidelines and/or mask mandates. part disagree with?

So telling people can't work hurtig economy?...
What loopy world live in.

I mean, free whatever want Sweden statment free seems lockdown deal fact caused higher cases/deaths per capita. hand, social distancing requirements enforced well, helped contained outbreak. Good country that, agree Sweden's strategy could worked countries we've seen non-compliant larger segment population following social distancing wearing masks.

Again, didnt option.
Unless goverment would made coup rewritten constitution...
Why ignoring fact.

New Zealand could zero covid deaths, shot everyone contracted virus.
You illegal.

Our goverment doesnt power innact lockdown. Wonder we'd Microsoft buy many promising coming companies completely ruin could keep pushing shit world?

If anyone knows setting world back 20 years, Bill Gates. American here. Got test Wednesday results Thursday, saved convenient MyResults page lab tests. wish standard throughout country, course it‚Äôs not. Sweden cute, 40 construction workers large project there. Everyone work got tested day came back 24h except 1 30h tested child tested, requirement quarantine awaiting test results NC unless suspected positive clinical diagnosis. getting tested mean anything restrictions. knows. probably said would, mean anything among lies he's told. stopped trying keep track 20 THOUSAND lies presidency cba google it. Daniel Andrews responsible control Scott Morrison's actions could ensured effective quarantine international arrivals rather allowing private companies outsource security guards $20 hour. buck stop somewhere. exempt? Mongolia really hot either. Nothing convince mean way country refused use excuse 'it can't done'. want find fault find obscure places incredible mental gymnastics prove right therefore justified nothing can‚Äôt ways, make mind:

- Government incompetent test/trace/prevent 

- want government X, Y, Z obviously private sector can‚Äôt money/corruption/incompetence Surely brass section instruments effectively buckets spit?

Spare woodwind. Great news, however kinda wish reported numbers get really low. numbers drop people go thinking fine wear masks, slowly grows again. kept reporting fake high numbers really going away could get 0 go back ""normal"" instead people go now. 

I hope people sensible, unlikely. Lol, mad. *only* masks vaccine required. Otherwise everyone would want ditch them. Therefore, *imperative* governors let up.

I confidence NY, CA, PA's governments continue staying safe becoming complacent. I'm really worried, however, Southern Midwestern states. Polio injuries slightly dangerous, though.

Anyway, there's thing safe anything. get hit meteor reading stories kids. nice way set good example Australians Vitamin D. darker skin is, slower produce vitamin D. skin tailor made genetics' homeland. live northern latitude ancestors, likely Vitamin deficient. Everyone supplementing Vitamin this. Vitamin dosing hospitalized COVID patients shown drastically improve outcomes. Tests 30+% false negative rate. useful outside clinical setting kind error. Ginsburg make comments mask wearing coronavirus prevention strategies? I'm familiar any, would bit unusual hear supreme court justice participating public health messaging. assuming liberal justice agree behave like every person shares political persuasion times?

She's 87 year old women had, likely knew had, weeks live. really can't bring care kind public health example woman position setting. binary choice AstraZeneca vaccination. currently several alternative vaccines less worrying phase III results.   wait China wins race.

You _bet_ they'll gloat it, put thumbscrews Trump anyone else opposed trade deals can't refuse. Well work contract tracer it‚Äôs always easy determine source. could one many activities done last 14 days. there‚Äôs another case flight timing works it‚Äôs clear cut. often people multiple activities coils infected them. American politicians well Well said we‚Äôre idiots.

At least know don‚Äôt know. 

Better acting smug pretending I‚Äôm saving lives. live Greece. June, got results less 24 hours. I'm saying data exist; go CDC site testing data too. I'm saying tampered with. source stating testing data directly goes state health departments none routed CDC directly/first Eapecially countries. Americans stay EXACTLY! Working home may challenge (or maybe even option depending job), boon many others. honestly know really looks forward morning afternoon commute. waste time money resources. Wear tear vehicle, gas money, 60-90 minutes round trip commute severe stress anxiety bumper bumper traffic every damn day. thanks.  They've us conservative. can't accept without entire world view destroyed  Yeah, far, one every 50 New Jersey residents virus, one every 555 died it. county Florida 26% positivity rate bars/restaurants open University Florida schools person sheriffs refuse enforce mask mandates. We‚Äôre fucked Yes, given jobkeeper, $1500 fortnight, payment reducing soon, everyone eligible. shops closed except supermarkets, chemist, petol stations. Retail closed public still click collect. lot businesses like meat packing, construction ect reduced 30% workforce. $200 fine wearing mask. 1 person house hold leave shopping. 2hrs permitted exercise use 1hr day. Oh forgot mention travel 5km radius home, 8pm curfew, recently changed 9pm. People fined almost $1600 breaking curfew buy cigarettes, travelling 15km buy daughters favourite bread. thankfully pulled through, city couple million. Tuff luck getting US follow. flu vaccine supposed prevent illness entirely short term immunity. Short term immunity turns short term.

The corona vaccine supposed create resistance, still get infected get bad case covid. resistance would last lifetime close it. (In fact, current candidates, virus continues multiply nose, survive down.) word pandemic stringent requirements. waited requirements fulfilled calling pandemic. proper thing. aerosol transmission. verify talking, something people try well. Maybe we'd lot facts instead lot falsehoods lies. Well Murdoch‚Äôs Australian originally Wall Street journal, New York post Fox News US (in addition equivalent Australia UK) yeah names them......... yet every state fine. That's becuase everyone follow insane lockdown rules imposed australia either arrested forgotten taken camp reeducation. RemindMe! 2 years PM guy words ""social distance"". Netherlands, days ago biggest daily case number ever record since outbreak. even higher tip first outbreak. Friday press conference, government warned us could facing 10k cases per day **4 weeks** trend continues,

**Edit:** typing this, read reached new record today 2k new cases :/ Didn‚Äôt mean generalize broadly. NZ seem fairly liberal many fronts. I've tried looking find information never got mine. told quit calling result hotline. still don‚Äôt know February not. That's nothing. According Americans daily cases 0, obviously, virus actually real. hoax much time Bill got?

There shitload outrageous things going right now.

Yak 'em up, Billy ! Cope  Nope. desire protect secrets hollow moon  practical implications us? homemade masks useless all? Abbott built test get test results twenty mins. They‚Äôre currently fixing machines hiring ppl put together test kits public. Yeah absolutely disgraceful. surprises though trash corporation. Lol no, can‚Äôt emphasized enough. went wedding got make choice, infected didn‚Äôt. People dying pride selfishness ""people"" guaranteed receive cheques time US big corporations.  Well obviously would ideal, let's real, that's option lot people even wanted to. like avoid questions preach shit. 1 person indoor party COVID-19 rest bar gets virus. really think person talked every single person spraying spit droplets mouths enough time get everyone sick? ridiculous. guess alternative 1 person spreads another person spreads others within 1-2 hour timespan, possible via respiratory droplets. fucking dumb finally saying airborne? Like said, support mitigation measures. support isolating elderly putting limiting large scale social events, like Sweden did. also support mask mandates, something Sweden do, far know. Sweden kept schools open allowed businesses continue operating restrictions much less strict ones US. think follow path. cause deaths covid manageable worth avoid economic educational ripple effects lockdown. Sweden best example case. doubt they've achieved herd immunity point either.

They live differently USA parts Europe. (USA) can't keep hands faces away apparently. I've learned, Swedes notorious keeping distance respecting government suggestion without strictly enforce laws protocols. (I'm sure Swedes confirm/deny otherwise) That‚Äôs problem general public, little understanding medicine decides ‚Äúwell cause B, case closed, obvious, cracked code.‚Äù It‚Äôs fear mongering. Let experts research, let experts report, let experts follow appropriate procedures find (or not) shit seems like it‚Äôs related.

And observe people ignore experts call fake news refuse vaccine. What's problem these? okay stop people going crowded regions okay arrest someone trying break restrictions incite protest. German colleagues went back work sans mask. Looks like W Europe getting hit hard now. Winter coming.  Headline misleading, Hispanic, Blacks, Native Americans share children 18? must 41%, probably majority CDC calling airborne people take seriously 

Are suggesting CDC lying people deliberately get follow particular orders?  Thing is, thousands extremely rare diseases. group 10,000 going least one person _some_ extremely rare disease it.

Think like P fishing, try large number hypotheses one happens show data claim data proves hypothesis.

The fact _two_ people illness lot worrying probably reason scrap vaccine. fact AZ lied first case claimed MS helping either. I've disaster junkie years, reading plagues pandemics. science sociology incidents fascinates me, I'm always attuned medical news.

Back 1980s read short article New York Times puzzling cluster cases: young men diagnosed Kaposi's Sarcoma. really stuck me, turned news brief harbinger AIDS epidemic.

In early January, read article unexplained deaths Wuhan, immediate flashback first glimpse AIDS. followed news closely discussed one online forums call home. Several people scoffed concern, within weeks obvious something serious brewing. late February making plans work home. 

So yeah, history buff, SF reader, horror-movie fan helped catch really quickly. social introvert helped weather isolation really well. Troll says random shit, demands prove wrong. Startling. Explains Wall Street's sick obsession quarterly results, long-term plan. would much like parties point 0 access anecdotal evidence due another part world asked , seem informed matter hearsay new infected. Thanks explaining anecdotal evidence works point. 

So 0 stories NZ new infected exists? Claim? yes, know every story regarding covid infections street level? can't know, anecdotal evidence even debate potential counter argument said government? 

Just give example, Romania thousands cases April now, met Literally 0 infected 5 months direct indirectly 0% anecdotal evidence ... changed 2 weeks ago family member got confirmed hospital... 5 months , tenth thousands infected , got 1 anecdotal evidence retell anyone asks. Short term reinfection problem worried about. know little pandemic become five years now. vacinne 70% effective masks, 91% effective, enough end pandemic all. think weird all, also laugh anyone suggesting NZ ""totalitarian"" 1984 like. Compared US, liberal paradise.

Australia's somewhere middle, imo. Don‚Äôt see point. could make case anything. Scott Morrison locked borders international travel refused entry country first cases would probably COVID free now.  30,000 trial participants desease already shows one 30,000 patients... would guy trust this, virus, knows long tests results taking.... lockdown many obvious reasons. country far away mainlands land big europe small population relatively, bad idea; guess. I‚Äôm fan too, month it‚Äôs going fun here. Always America never able live people grow stop fearing piece cloth mouth nose. honestly cannot believe human beings equate piece cloth freedoms taken them. I'm someone vulnerable. I've stuck home 8 months, along millions vulnerable people across country (45% Americans underlying conditions put risk Covid complications), waiting people stop selfish idiots wear mask, social distance, stop calling hoax ""plan-demic' finally feel safe enough leave homes. Unreal. like believe virus real someone love hurt it. ever go far? people use brains given? people care anyone anymore? happened country? freedom wear mask conflicts freedom exposed deadly virus. can't both, pick one. Obviously, one two freedoms way important one. bit semantically tricky whether coverage implies rate total vaccinated given time suppose. look, got attention, probably deserves it. Wait, it‚Äôs metaphor? died far attend either wedding reception.

They caught second third hand one anything asked question many Americans fail ask themselves.

Everyone thinks ""their"" media fine. ""all others."" That's right. believe ""Live Free Die"". Merica!!!  metaphor. Got tested july 27th. Still gotten results back. *Cries American surprising see netherlands takes less serious belgium. (and belgium still massive surge) water wet. Hard get accurate information stage. People hypothesize classes contagious using meta studies, honestly haven‚Äôt seen major difference initial China outbreak infectiveness modern countries. Clearly mean NPR PBS, bastards! tabloidism. /s make immune systems extra frail  It‚Äôs wild. got tested less 24 hours later told I‚Äôm negative. still sick hell. days later go back doctor don‚Äôt test again, instead doctor quarantine act like safe. 

He didn‚Äôt want test said tests area producing like 40% false negatives. Fucking wild. Hopefully second one! billion people developed countries need 1 year develop cure, Greenland take 20,000 years left themselves. Earth warmed enough don‚Äôt need vaccine. 

They spent time last century procreating instead fishing. Lol... that's hyperbolic nonsense. trailers used hold dead bodies. also numerous news stories **funeral homes** rent refrigerated trucks hold unusual number dead bodies. Would like find links well?

1. NYC: Texas: Another good article NYC area: Demand various sites US: Florida: would fine wearing masks stores mass transit forever. seems like prudent thing do. wonder much continued mask use would reduce seasonal respiratory illnesses. know happen. people agree great firewall sucks, also realizing necessity seeing much misinformation ""free"" media what's happening Tiktok. Internet defense necessity dominance, something challenges dominance. Yes fucking cares anymore dude. try keep guilt tripping covid mass murderer literally don‚Äôt give shit. I‚Äôm tired pretending do.  not? country government run testing, free, 24 hour results back April. still drive testing get tested less 10 minutes waiting car lower chances spread. 2 week forced quarantines foreigners entering Korea. also illegal leave home Seoul without mask on. 

This shit hard. country refuses it. younger people basically flu. That‚Äôs point.

That fact supported fairy wishes delusion *my* point. 

As well point mind apprently rejects ignores. young, healthy people may *survive* infection high rates, say anything rate potential outcomes beyond death survival. longterm consequences even asymptomatic infection today might healthy, young body may emerge year, 5, 20.

You clue virus may damage young people's DNA way kids concieve future deformed. might damage hearts way become apparent decade. damage brains far likely develop dementia alzheimers 40. might make young people susceptible flu complications, hit young people especially hard last year itself.

You clue, one yet. We're still focused entirely keeping people alive stopping spreading healthy people. Cleaning mess going secondary happens.

Assuming Novel virus ""basicly flu"" orange idiot said something young people need concerned with, faksehood already sickened, maimed killed human beings needlessly, utter lie swallowed desperately want true point complete self-delusion.

Also, know young people get pass others higher risk? likely asymptomatic superspreader infect huge populations people? 

Seriously, really one ""fuck old, cripples gimps! young bucks deserve live world"" sociopaths? one right mind looking cases instead deaths. seems really low considering many millions caught general public?  needs defined. doctors part general public, normal use word. 

The term ""low risk people"" would make sense. emergency use usually reserved high risk people. High risk people could 40% populations easily. High risk work hospitals. High risk 60. High risk comorbidities. 

Now high risk people included emergency use, would really significant cutting deaths lot also infection rates. Thanks joining rest us real world, CDC! -.- Except Indian states given October. impossible deconvolute multiple factors. trial well, got first shot couple weeks ago absolutely side effects shot. know could placebo. Lmao go can‚Äôt defend racism country‚Äôs. ‚ÄúSay low IQ even though understanding history recite dictionary!!!‚Äù

So lockdown couple weeks?

Unbelievable. lot people society live life thinking things inconvenient personally personal problem. he's buying good publicity guys eat up.

I've heard pundits go around around whether disease becoming less severe ignoring analysis based assuming case rate represents infection rate.

It doesn't.

Hospitalizations should, theory, reliable metric... unless live somewhere like FL governor decided things like count ICU beds available even occupied Covid patients thinks COULD moved crunch, count potential ""overflow"" beds ICU beds current, past ICU bed availability figures numbers always look like improving, count Covid patients ICU also condition... which, course, many since immune function depressed, comorbidities vulnerable.

Hopefully they're playing games people's lives there, data actually helpful.

Wasn't Texas hospital group nurses said allowed test anyone notate Covid infections?  Sure economy suffering now, think long term cost saved government due ongoing effects recovered covid. put health people short term gains long run save tax payer money. called lack trust.

Well, Sweden also seems discovered infection rate reaches 20-25% (about 3x less 70% estimate) that's Stockholm, lower across country. 

That's moderate social distancing measures place _not even forcing masks_. sure?

Yep. even read response? 2 3 sentences... Last three tests got po-dunk Alaska took 15 minutes. family India takes less 24 hours get results back there.

This first time you‚Äôve explained weird boner America, would assume people already know reasons behind obsession shithole country?

Edit: aaaand deleted comment. surprise. know that's fair blanket statement. I'm planning first line vaccine, things I'm done masks social distancing completely kid's activities, going movies wife, gym hobbies, mind still keeping rules public areas like grocery stores. Omega lul hes paid actor ""Even it‚Äôs highly effective, it‚Äôs still going sure shot. get 75%, means one every four people get could still get moderate severe disease,""

So earlier interview says assume vaccine effective 75% cases. goes talk still wear masks several years lot people -in fact **25%** people still get moderately severely ill covid even vaccine administered . he's making completely unsupported assumptions. 

First, assumes everyone 25% group vaccine effective actually contact covid. Thats simply true. zero data suggest that. Even (the vast majority Americans caught covid-even though hindered vaccine-and post vaccine risk exposure significantly less today 75% (his number) people' immune' therefore 'carriers' could infect 25%. zero data logic supporting point.

Then assumes people within 25% necessarily get moderate severe case-why? people dont get moderate severe case. people get mild case. would assume people subset would get last moderate case. although dont know covid yet reason speculate vaccine still get covid milder case. 

Not credible. Guy background, still train. Mask way nose. one many reasons good question, would want take two vaccines right row vaccines basically working immune system. possible taking two vaccines could stimulate immune system much wind maladaptive immune response bad severe form disease. Best talk good doctor issue. Hell lol. said ""He came work heroin"" showed results drug test sent take accident judge ruled immediately.

I've pretty good luck East coast. local Walgreens free testing results come back within hour been. POTUS? bit sick tired bozo.

The man done humanity entire lineage. bitching money God.

Cool. outrageous? responsibility private citizen put basic infrastructure? No. 

Who saying is? Oh wanted anything political gain he‚Äôd finance bunch testing labs done it.

You did. 


Gates already bankrolling aid thing. actively fucking POTUS last 6 months. Yeah says article Wildly depends guess. Quebec, wait time 1 (one) car got results 24h, weekend. you? literally said don‚Äôt know someone would fly. recall asking uninformed opinion. COVID absolutely eradicated. everywhere across entire planet spreads far effectively. 

The current Rt around 1 areas world. That's effective efficient spread comes diseases. measles. Additionally, widespread vaccination campaign means there's going large percent population that's already immune. That's ideal condition eradication number potential hosts limited.

Talk lack critical thinking.  Lot trolling Gates. see much MS doing. money MS longer stay situation. something it, Mr Gates. Well making comments? seem weirdly defensive America I‚Äôve flown times covid is:

Face mask entire time 
Sanitize areas plane wipes brought
Sanitized luggage 
Wore jumpsuit like thing covered could easily remove later 
Covered seat travel blanket
Ate airport, items brought myself. 
Had change clothes carry on. Changed parking lot, put travel clothes plastic bag directly laundry 
drive destination isolate required 

About half flight attendants seen wear masks shields. ones shields usually wear gloves did! I‚Äôm saying, shield works direct impact protection, like getting sneezed / spat at. Notice medical personnel goggles addition masks. you‚Äôre concerned aerosols / tiny droplets swirl around air, face shield won‚Äôt much. everyone disagrees assertion death toll ""is high enough them"" Russian troll GOP operative.

Hawaii caught rock hard place right now, moreso anywhere else country. lose-lose scenario them. UK ~~considerably less tests per capita US~~ tests US, much (18th vs 19th world), number deaths. U.S. end death rate 5x higher world average? 

But didn't. Turns virus going virus. Spreading highly contagious disease that‚Äôs killed lot people already sounds like little inconvenience me. We‚Äôre starting learn long term health effects survivors. also outrageous billionaires corporations engineer system avoid paying lot taxes. see, NEED soda, restraint, unlike fat allies.

as locked till 2022, I've enjoying life zero (0) restrictions MONTHS now, along rest covid free state. deluded pathetic wouldnt matter government set labs. simply PCR machines available purchase. Weve bought everything get hands on. private logistics networks already far greater anything government could set ad hoc basis. failure government coordinating shut downs stimulus national level, securing PPE effectively. Theres much testing. Weirdly enough. I‚Äôve two tests got results first time 24 hours second time less 24 hours. 

I‚Äôve friends wait 5 days though. That's true. Idiots seem think states allow firing employee ever want. long list things can't fire someone over.


Also, employers required give two weeks sick pay COVID. Yes restrictions law still protections. guy put product reboot 15 minutes. worries. We‚Äôre still kicking asses.  Ugh. elderly catch Covid mean immediately puts death bed. Quit sucker sensationalized news. Jfc. Maybe I'll opt corona... would suck donkey balls. Health USA go together think underestimating impact would economy, sure, would great government that. 
What missing, changes implemented since Covid started. 

Of course flying plane put risk infection started.  HEPA filters, electrostatic disinfection mandatory mask rules greatly mitigated risk travel. things ""other option"". They've already done. still take years industry recover.

Edited one word.  exciting. can‚Äôt wait! Hopefully keep Atlantic bubble going. rest Canada getting worse. don‚Äôt give shit. different types tests. rapid test different standard test takes days lab process. went urgent care told standard 3-5 days. unfortunate truth us :/ hope tomorrow's results negative ‚ô•Ô∏è type person would preferred three seashells new version sex _Demolition Man._ Sweden try form ""herd immunity""

He considerable respect area work foundation. good contact tracing system would also include asking people attended large gatherings, protests. like Bill Gates doing, general.... admiration limited fact had/has much money plutocrats ruining US, done anything counteract influence.

Imagine funded unbiased news network, paid people collect stats coronavirus every state first hand, technical work show mass media used manipulate public opinion... even provided site better Reddit without shills, trolls, bots, petty tyrants. arent problem.

We ""richest"" ""most powerful"" country world according rulers yet every country world dusting us this. 24hr test results SK April. nearly October.

Why? government, levels, incompetant.

* labs country, many capacity given day, national organization load balacing tests right places, handling logistics planning ensure every lab runs 100% capacity? No.

* know law authorizing president mandate factories alter production lines time crisis. Trump invoked hundreds times defense contractors **not fucking covid.**

* 6 months now, federal government brought labs online? No, rely private sector. Tell me, private business would invest expensive PCR machines take years pay event gone (dear god hope) 8 months. wouldn't, don't. government giving grants online machines? No.

* government providing contact tracers every community prevent 50 cases day becoming 500 cases day, thus untracable level. local level, places. national level? No.

* government even actively providing free tests? Sorta, complicated. Yet every modern country. drive tests SK April. still free, easy use, drive tests community. stick fucking thing nose, I'm sure fantastic job tried gag.

None way. None it. politicians fucking dogshit media spends time focusing polling numbers focusing 200k dead fucking bodies. 9/11 almost daily even number one headline day.

ppl seem covering nose &amp; mouth. stores even hand disposable masks free customers. Hate say ... fuck him! Next time....whoops next time....take seriously. I'm claiming know long immunity antibodies last, people got reinfected 2 months, mean that's norm. We're tens millions Covid infections now, even immunity proven last 100 years, still lot people infected twice, even small percentage. 

Everybody different. always outliers exceptions. people get chicken pox twice, legitimate issue vast majority population. aren‚Äôt wrong; however, job isn‚Äôt one done home. handful us company need on-site, pretty much everyone else could work home Powers would allow it. one coworker particular situation allowed work home, coming sometimes. situation occurred, working home full-time. 7ish different mutations last I've heard. case aware somebody infected from.a different strain. government force wisdom inviting drug addicts house? think look like, ""They made enough 10 million people 3 months, make enough 40 million people 1 year."" 

In sort manufacturing, make lot items speculation. companies making X amount vaccines, ordered government, speculation approved. private companies speculating sales. government. Private companies can't take risk. 

But know demand trillions doses world. company gets vaccine approved, know produce lot more, likely sold profitable. 

So basically, idea companies going spend millions millions dollars making 100 200 million doses, may thrown out. likely plan ramp production quickly know sell 100s millions doses. Also, keep mind, competing companies. want produce much can, want another company, may approved month later take market share. There's known cases infections Ontario lines (as far aware). pass masks security enforces mask wearing distancing. entire line outside start finish, fairly well coordinated I've seen. people seem symptoms like coughing, noticed keep people extra far apart others. I'm certain reelection. He'll get votes sure may failure affects enough people fence. making record profits? backfire politicians get rid exactly don‚Äôt listen people saying ‚Äúflying safe‚Äù.

Dr. Drew, much love him, severely lets aspect. He‚Äôs even said verbatim ‚Äúno pilots flight attendants getting virus‚Äù patently false, news articles pilots getting barely weeks pandemic. mean, could probably pay test every American citizen seeing wealthy increased testing, naturally cases. countries tested less naturally fewer cases. 

In words, large number cases America's world class ability test many people. Brazil India testing capabilities United States, numbers far worse seeing right now. Source? else? Anything factual? Politicians going mistakes right election, keep dreaming Bill. T9 response? Could users subreddit please explain they've claiming US reducing testing? Translation -- can't arsed wear mask even 1M fewer people would die. 5 deaths per million, Iam14AndSmart America 600 deaths per million. I'm Louisville tested today exposed I'm symptomatic.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Wow, super insightful. see really offer lot conversation. wait election happens pump vaccine trump say saved day. sugar water. bill gates buy distribution channel biopharm lab work it‚Äôs important shut read ‚ÄúIT‚Äù 10. Discovered ‚ÄúThe Stand‚Äù much later it‚Äôs still one favorites. states talking about? I‚Äôm California could log right book drive test afternoon. test would take hour, including 45 minutes worth driving, I‚Äôd results 10am tomorrow.

Who limiting tests? ‚Äúit‚Äù? know answer wear surgical mask KF94 works well me. office 8 hours issue. M-O-O-N los angeles, im getting test results less 24 hours tbf can't return citizen? Afaik NZ allows residents essential workers travel country. even vaccines know fact useful creating herd immunity (like measles, example) less 100% effective. plenty people become infected immunized something normally leaves protected. mere existence people infected twice mean much. Lockdowns flatten curve. Social distancing, masking, hand hygiene always going around vaccine.  Also Victoria, state currently locked down, never actually achieved elimination relaxing restrictions first time round. places. ICUs hospitals area transfer patients state. I'm advocate lockdowns, maintaining mitigation vaccination, fact fact. actually single day.

Looking deeper 7 days since case linked Auckland outbreak trying contain.

Of course frequently detect covid-19 positive people managed isolation hotels.

And picked 3 cases community weekend linked, one recently returned India, went symptomatic 21 days return (despite spend 14 days managed isolation passed tests day 3 &amp;12). public health team contact traced people got contacts get tested isolate. Sounds like got lucky people social butterfly's, concern spread low.

The Leaks managed isolation / quarantine little worrying. two staff get sick now, plus case India weekend, plus however calling ameri-cold cluster got NZ (still unsolved mystery). Bill gates talks lot like politician amount cognitive dissonance seen pandemic overwhelming.

So many people nonchalantly taking unnecessary risks. deliberately limiting tests, totally different, right?  OMG. going sent back dark ages? I‚Äôm going look this. preexisting heart condition.

Vote life depends cause frankly mine wouldn‚Äôt surprised someday life well given huge population existing conditions.  extremely wary prescriptions. took away emotions bout decade til got off. trying scare u, making u aware real- I‚Äôve seen lot kitchen staff restaurants wearing masks rubs wrong way. seeing Tenet second time, understand better? app use? wearing mask, minding 3 6 foot distance, washing hands prevent economy moving? tired constantly ashamed American lately.

It's U.S. [only acknowledged airborne/aerosol transmission possibility July 200+ scientists around world urged acknowledge it. even then, said ""However, evidence needs gathered interpreted."", still fully bought covid spread aerosol.

On [WHO covid web still mention covid spread aerosol. #1 tip ""Regularly thoroughly clean hands alcohol-based hand rub wash soap water. Why? Washing hands soap water using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses may hands."" probably #1 mode covid transmission.  One week Louisiana got 6 tests total medical reasons, 5 took 24h 1 (the last) took 6h Spain **Conspiracy theory**

*The idea many important political events economic social trends products deceptive plots largely unknown general public* country region infection rate low, makes certain amount sense let people like even though husband quarantining.

Let's say 1% tests come back positive. long husband showing symptoms there's pretty low chance he's infected even lower chance are, quarantine letting go makes sense tradeoff limiting infection rates keeping society somewhat open.

This calculation changes dramatically levels infection country region significantly higher. 100000 deaths would White House hadn‚Äôt actively tried downplay discourage mask use intercepting shipments states play Hunger Games grovel supplies. seems average number I‚Äôm hearing. Thinking voting? must. honor Americans longer crisis botched. Rich Captain Obvious something say! I've personally seeing counselor since 18. recently felt stress high corona bullshit got back touch go guy zoom. recommendation: skip meds. Mental health relatively new field study prescriptions feel like throwing darts. Again, personal experience make decisions.

However, I'd strongly advise drugs. Check book called ""the depression cure"" ""fix me"" helped.

Rooting man. happen 
? Well government abandoned us start. usually factual experience. free show present unproven conspiracies facts? Sure, articles bound biased etc. ""sides"", common post Sweden daily/weekly deaths updates.

I dislike recent posts started show titles like ""Sweden currently better x country without masks/lockdowns"" used argument masks/lockdowns.

But remember several months, users would daily bombard subreddit posts incorrect ill informed anyone living Sweden would get offended. mods allowed daily barrage continue minimal repercussions

But maybe best thing would ban posts involving Sweden?  Nice try Bill. hell would know?? Honestly. pulling completely ass think comment doesn‚Äôt tell whole story. give long ‚Äòneutral‚Äô response true, don‚Äôt give key details- let‚Äôs call is, utter failure Trump administration, Republican Party goes along fuckery denied existence virus still plays down.

That‚Äôs partisan comment either, that‚Äôs fact. Lol. can't get tested I'm 50 years old .-. problem approach work countries close borders virus disappeared.
In European countries second lockdown pointless imo. new zealand? taiwan? got mine day, already ICU That's true. people get mild disease, sure. CDC says high end 40% people completely asymptomatic. ACA struck passing Ginsburg, case go Supreme Court. ties there, likely now, ruling lesser court stands. takes one day, I'm New York. thought 3-5 days bad scrolled through. Fuck shit. Obligatory: 

This post age like milk. Spoiler alert: government officials get results 10 minutes, tested around clock. Food thought. think really angers people truly love trump nobody loves Biden. 100% gotta keep bringing news headlines keep masses scared, we?  still 0 though. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll get regular flu work force stay home two weeks wait get pay. Oh bet I‚Äôd get actual corona two months later fuck starts people infected. don‚Äôt get earthquakes Auckland (thankfully). 56 volcanoes tho üòÖ I'm glad hear guys stopped killing since April. Though maybe kill all.  wonder people old buildings like wear masks even alone, usual advise wear mask social distancing possible. stuff airborne aerosols hang around hours all.

Also read people take masks bathroom thinking safe alone. Tests found virus stool urine *possibility* toilet plume could way catch it. really hope university looking people advised necessary keep masks public bathrooms even alone. reality Sweden ranks bit lower since lot countries shit counting covid deaths. still bad Health team sport. I'm low risk.

If obese, diabetes, cancer, hypertension old different situation make responsible you. Notice quickly pulled funding listened convenient info did.. He's infectious disease expert. know exactly herd immunity meant, he's negligent. first day college everyone get tested, got mine back 30 minutes max. take 2 weeks process test serious problem. went Sweden caught herd immunity quit job like year. Probably Netherlands almost 2000 new cases per day, vs less 40 per day Australia. like vaccine development. Better discard one that's dangerous work rest wilfully expose people potentially threatening vaccine.

This also matter confidence. vaccine kills people, less people take less effective overall. really failure Swedish strategy. vaccine ready ""too soon"" Infrastructure includes many facilities available this. working capacity beyond still lagging behind days, infrastructure best. inadequate best  sound like fellow MLS. Thank do, matter do. Ironically, Vietnam done tremendously well pandemic. I'm surprised word 'result' article. warning, may contain spin. Good reporting puts facts proper context mislead audience. 'Cancer increased 300% last year' awful headline story also needs indicate increased 300% last year one person year 4 people.

Also concerned part. Wondering 'pooled' tests included United States also authorized pooled testing, method tests samples several people expand testing However, pooled testing efficient areas limited outbreaks. mid-September, 27 50 states positive test rates 5%, according Reuters analysis, including South Dakota 17%.  Yeah, Swedish officials said loud clear they/we failed protect old don‚Äôt understand government isn‚Äôt paying people quarantine. Uhh, Swedish officials said multiple times failed protect vulnerable (elderly) people.

I relying strategy believe vaccine far away virus running course (looks likely, vaccine much closer) quite different saying virus hoax telling people inject disinfectant Well 200k already died thing supposed stop right? Apparently Americans not. thought common sense?? SARS 1 similar SARS 2 antibodies former provide protection latter. Also, bubonic plague, smallpox, typhus, polio, Spanish flu, tuberculosis order magnitude two nastier SARS 2, humans lived without cushy work home vaccines millennia. Definitly trash, think necessary uplifting either, depressing times there's nothing wrong depicted such.

There's also speculation timeing release, sort conveys idea ""The time come nation take stand againest common enemy"". There's always something speculate movie suddenly released stuck review limbo year. Exactly! live mom dad. Dad got covid cafe awaited test results. went get tested got call one customers family members customer positive. knowing dad positive dad got tested. asked him, ""should stay home get results?"" said no. Idk thats testing facility said advice. mean I've co-workers work tell theyre awaiting test results standing right front me! call tell he's positive. also say mom quarantine 14 days dad's last day quarantine. we're 18 days home total. I'm free 1 day. many inconsistent rules. manager work asking I'm gonna get tested I'm finished quarantining. Like dude finished 18 days isolation, I'm pretty sure I'm fine. dad house last two weeks....so fuck knows what's happening! testing facility said can't get mom I, outside people? know basis company decided continue trail second TM case discovered? 'ten penny' common saying states? UK, basically meaning plentiful worthless. I'm sure inspiration officer Tenpenny gta San andreas. Anyway real life name always seems belong someone fits perfectly, like there's country star called Mitchell Tenpenny sounds like every modern country star. Seemed fit guy well too. Serious questions. happens new infections inevitably start popping week two? UK here, daughter results 23 hours Antibody levels immunity. retained level antibody generated fight initial infection every single pathogen allergen you‚Äôve ever faced, would antibodies blood cells body. Memory cells retain knowledge rapidly produce antibodies needed future. Read fucking basic immunology textbook Yep, Denmark. original comment thread: *It [Sweden] deliberately close down. claimed protect vulnerable, seems made dog's lunch that.*

Did really need elaborate referred *the vulnerable*? u/dragoonxnucleon president üí™ non American, guys shut racist fake biased media 3 seconds imagine would differ per aircraft type, even per manufacturer    That's nature government. part problem, solution. would Sweden close universities encourage work home wanted herd immunity? Thats great. know specifics every airline. strains common cold also coronaviruses, we've looking cold vaccine decades. Stay room entire time close vents. time friends reunions eat paninis would back fire. I‚Äôve seen videos friend lives France socializing like nothing happened. hard say Malaysia? 
Sweden killed grandpa grandma since April. depending old grandpa's mom dad died. 

I'm glad things went well Malaysia. UIUC student hereüòé  mean last official number saw literally 7 huge jump compared that. far go test?

And many people shops still refusing wear masks? Yes, know ""exempt categories"", guarantee good percentage nothing wrong them.

Stop making masks optional. stop afraid stopping entry shops wearing mask. made simple gaiter wear mine attend medical appointment crowded office give shit social distancing. looked like absolute lunatic, 10/10 would again.  Bruh, bet ice cold soda would hit different yanking big ass tube throat. ultimate fizzy satisfaction. look test numbers. germany got 1millions tests per week. still 0.8% positive rate weeks. government media always telling us doomed. saying numbers aint rising. put perspectice. keep good work. keep calm carry on. stay safe. stay healthy. greetings germany want eat snack wait 10 minutes passed out. Everyone already finished point air replaced. took 12 hours, free testing DC, line would Sweden close universities encourage work home wanted herd immunity? couldn‚Äôt watch virus intense movies pandemic began. day watched Red Dragon movie slept like baby. Se7en also good one. üçø visiting parents South Korea, almost done 2 week mandatory quarantine, got test result back 24 hrs. feel much safer Korea everything Korean government Covid. Don‚Äôt countries control entry exit? main sources tourists effectively trapped countries come open borders virus even could.  Makes sense.

Just make sense case  Delta good. Avoid SLC airport can. place zoo teaming disease morons. MSP, SJC, SEA fine. cough Friday night, felt like death Saturday morning, tested Saturday afternoon, results today.

The booking process bit nightmare there's definitely room improve, actual testing process pretty great. could over? New Zealand showed us matter hard long lockdown can't erradicate virus, possible vaccine. 

Until vaccine comes, though, buy lot time locking down. NZ went 100 days without single new case. That‚Äôs three months economic activity didn‚Äôt restricted. latest outbreak looking fairly viable strategy clear Sweden's they've recorded lowest rate cases even though they're testing ever

You mean Sweden [eleventh-highest death rate per capita 574 deaths per million? Sweden? Yeah definitely sounds like strategy Sweden, Belarus, Japan, South Korea never lockdown, collapse.

‚ÄúNever lockdown‚Äù bit reductive cases, several fatality rates many times New home Switzerland opened back May we're absolutely fine.

238 deaths per million people (compared 5 New Zealand) doesn‚Äôt sound ‚Äúfine‚Äù. guess long businesses still making lots money it‚Äôs Besides going get infected isolate keep distance? saying masks social distancing work?

They work enough population make hundreds thousands people die, ever look studies regarding fatality Covid?

200,000 people dead US already. 961,000 institution CDC

I‚Äôm kiwi, median people dying US 79 years.

Is meant get 184'000-380'000 deaths way low number destroy economy for.

You prevent deaths without destroying economy, places like New Zealand 30'000'000 Americans registered jobless right now, true number probably much higher, going feed people?

I‚Äôd prefer pay feed people bury grandparents, wouldn‚Äôt you? Thanks lord savior Bill Gates!
What would without him? people put blinders remain purposefully ignorant uneducated, ignoring plenty information learn order keep specific worldview unfettered facts. elderly people, care homes Sweden domain totally incapable living anymore see 25% residents die within 30 days normal conditions, going meaningfully benefit going extreme lengths ICU extend lives cost. Dying dignity thing. Get gear ordered up! Nope. issue. widespread virus population potential cases need test.

So testing need related number infections last two weeks number population.

But US managed reduce test positivity 5% testing more, that's good. need turnaround time coming 1-3 days, financial support need quarantine, quarantine affordable them.  Makes sense talk 21st century √Ñttestupa never √Ñttestupa *any* century. Nani?! every plane I've window seats taken. I'm pretty sure get choice.  got tested got results 2 hours. course got tested directly US government so... depends. testing people post-mortem? not, number deaths would directly correlate number tests, deliberately tests. thinking entire read. Eff. winter coming. Literally. got that, post bemoaning fact people can't get quick test many states. talking quality test. 

The fact could make paper test tests saliva gives result less 5 minutes. approved FDA 75% accurate. However could produced mass quantities anyone could administer it.

We would lot better 10,000 tests 75% accurate 1,000 tests 99% accurate. Getting scammed data collection agency ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  husband got one Tuesday, results Wednesday. I'm sorry y'all's tests taking longer üò≠ think common - even uncommon - belief even crazier. irony serious lockdown, ""year parties"" becomes ""three months parties"", theory.

Not hot take around I'm sure disagree, rough time college choosing drugs everyone else was.

""Yes,"" I'd say, ""I realize almost certainly safe many cases.""

But, smoking weed completely took lives almost everyone knew, beer, anything else. 

Not trying judgmental, point takes people refuse smoke weed, otherwise almost everyone will. problem weed bad, everything always weed time bad. situations can't escape problem unless people put foot weed.

Sorry, anti-weed thing. 

It's global problem, problem caused behavior problem personally locally. So, action personally locally harmful, one possibly convinced they're one sacrifice fix global problem. 

Overwhelming majority humans cannot possibly bothered think way. What's point getting test result 2 weeks? time might fully healed. think that's protect undershirt, face. flew went Chick-fil-a. guy nose uncovered next person wearing gaiter. go wearing half face mask goggles.

And anyone gives grief eating airport found empty terminal measured temperature seats sitting down. ambient room temperature put 10 feet seat. see. Sweden evil genocidal eugenicist state covid-deaths (that deaths *with* covid, cannot proven deaths *by* covid). US good moral country even though average life expectancy brought homicide poverty.

Makes perfect sense. Hair metal baby, yeah!  Yes, obviously always aggregated, huge spike get suspicion maybe stopped reporting whole month (because low cases administrative burden) reported ton once, go back reporting often. wrong. Replace ""We Good Job"" ""We Good Job."" I've seen many articles statements suggesting nearing end past worst pandemic, unfortunately true. need stop acting like looking back retrospectively happened better we're still middle (or maybe beginning) pandemic. We're still 40,000 cases 850 deaths per day numbers falling may fact rising again. HEPA filters basically equivalent N100 filters, N95. I‚Äôm guessing Netscape furiously asking Jeeves guidance Isn‚Äôt promising considering would mean death rate order magnitude lower? Yes mean vaccine green light, mean want say 2B doses vaccine time spring, 20M sounds little low. impression huge manufacturing facilities counstructed every one viruses we'll need ok'd. Welcome JOB = INSURANCE land. Har test result less 12h Sweden. Yeah need watch tenet like 100 times understand plot. inverted time gravity concept confused fuck outta me. Please DM too! Almost none. 84% infections due droplets aerosols. realise stupid one right? fact US done pathetic job pat back Brazil India frankly pathetic.

Look Europe, look death rates Europe, that's first world looks like. America richest country Earth yet lets citizens die like dogs Americans even gall say ""At least we're Brazil"". Temp ubi needs rallying cry. need jealous Canada ‚Äúwealthiest country world ‚Äú Whether ""cutoff"" 10 11 12 varies (and depends groups studied obviously). 
The result stronger younger cutoff.

This probably best one: Age group specific tracing index patients:
Summary: Almost one could traced 0-9 yo., 10 others general case infectivity/school last one, schools closed 15 compared groups countries 14 group) Natural selection says hi stay awake flight since briefly stop breathing moment lose consciousness would force wake remove mask happened. watched movie Cats flight literally almost killed me. Thanks, nice appreciated. 10x. made sensible decisions less people would died. Even Tegnell knows Ah ok. good. 

I feel like heard type story various friends/family years. Tho usually road/tunnel collapsed due Earthquake. legendary woman good question. highest accuracy achieved Broncho-alveolar lavage samples obviously invasive proceedure totally unsuitable routine testings. guidance people taking samples use mid-turbinate swabs better results nose throat swabs.

Some PCR results shown false negative rate nearly 30%, verification work, appears nearly positive results accurate (The UK guidelines currently state positives confirmed methodology)  I, too, read 10.

In hindsight? There's probably shit 10-year-old reading. exactly 24 hour teasing insane. easy take 10 days quarantine every time suspect might exposure.

(My last test got 10 days, too) lol I'm sure either  visit hospital around May year precaution hospital tested patients COVID. got results 2 hours. 

Months country instant testing results figured out, no? policy makers let people die unnecessarily.

this part get. still true think people immortal. know this. Yeah wtf one even read graph all?? Pat back one highest death rates planet. Gosh hard sometimes believe stereotype American stupidity. Personally find masks way comfortable makeup look many people willing wear makeup daily. It‚Äôs boring work  anxiety attack. repost months ago. happened virus seasonal Yeah started wearing masks avoid getting sick possible permanent lung damage possibly infecting risk family... peer pressure. It‚Äôs getting harder harder justify quarantining long feels like one gives shit anymore, aside required wear mask go grocery shopping. Testing needs quicker. article posted important note first time hospitals used refrigerated trailers body storage. approached maximum capacity situations recent opioid crisis, trailers brought in.¬† think question would that? Reading comments content, insist, find original question whether vaccines plus efforts might eventually result virus ""going away"". flu different virus. People get Spanish Flu long since evolved something else ceased Eradication COVID happening. Anyone thinks misinformed.

So clearly, point time, much one, Spanish flu functionally eradicated (""evolved something else ceased exist""), somehow totally different story COVID.

But insisting eradicate Spanish flu, blaming mix-up reading comprehension? Overlooking blatantly ontradicted yourself, present eradicate Spanish Flu, know read comment content. descendants Spanish Flu still circulation.

...is ridiculous claiming need lock doors dinosaurs outside, saw chickadee. reasonable purpose discussion, Spanish flu ""eradicated"", like dinosaurs (cassowaries notwithstanding!).

I'll end noting understanding Spanish flu least transmissible COVID, hosts per capita. still given reason believe expect less successful latter former, long run.

There sort population wide suppressive effect going here. think over, we'll find ~50% people cross reactive cells prior common cold infections greatly reduces chances symptoms adverse outcomes. found study says 45 percent people antibodies hadn‚Äôt symptoms, think reinforces idea mitigating chance spread even one doesn‚Äôt symptoms  Remove ‚ÄúL‚Äù username, checks üòÉ Got tested last week, still waiting results.

Vietnamese friends tell visit them. air fields burn bad, California. same-same Cambodia, burning fields like there. Phnom Penh, also beauty then, pollution construction. 

But Vietnamese wear much Cambodians, also, Thai wear much (maybe Americans catch see Asian tourists think also Thai, dunno), I've never seen single person wear Myanmar (which hazy) Laos, I've whole bunch favorite place all. Even back motorcycle, dusty rust red red mountain, I've never seen masks worn Laos. 

Didn't see whole lot Japan summer. Snapped photos trains, nope, shared them, see almost one mask. Ditto Taiwan. I've Taiwan like, day, two days, six times now. People chewing betel nut spitting red. usually wearing masks unless ill. 

I saw Hong Kong much more. Japan summer. assume pollution. 

I personally fan masks level. immune system shot cancer, always gladly wear mask avoid getting sick planes. categorically expect people wear though keep getting ill. thought way, I'd get mad every single student coughing every single class decades now, giving yet another flu, even though flu shot (which apparently pretty ineffective -- get shot diligently get flu diligently -- getting flu shot week full knowledge likely get flu year I've managed four substantive colds already seeing zero human beings I'm staying home 100% due work right left house 2x since late July live partner orders food; otherwise, mainly eat grow garden plus hefty pantry, well-stocked). 

I mystified every time someone says ""Asians wear masks!"" Well yes, like, do, thing ""Asians."" people countries Asia, different cultures, culture looks wearing masks differently, homogenizing ""Asians wear masks!"" touchy little... want use word, yeah, problematic. ""Asians"" same, wear masks, probably none Red-Blue spectrum American politics either. 

Sorry ramble! I'm falling asleep. 

You'd think would sunscreen Vietnam skin concern? hard buy, except lightening one, even that's hard buy, like, outside Hanoi, Hoi An, Halong Bay, DaNang, Ho Chi Minh City. I'd love go back again. Inland best. Mekong favorite. I'm Tho girl. I‚Äôll always wonder.

You could get blood test antibodies. Report‚Äôs metrics mostly likely using net worth life quality. high speed internet even decade old electronics, new treatment disease vaccines, way world set back 20 years considering metrics.

Huh. explains lot. know may everyone‚Äôs experience, took test CVS able get results roughly 22~ hours. took test 3pm Monday results available 12:55pm Tuesday, next day. happened check website results since roughly 11:30am~. got test results 8 hours getting test Pretty sure could find continent still bunch money left over. that's penises get People country self-centered dumbasses. recurring lesson years. solution complete overhaul refocus education ground up, best it'll take entire generation properly reduce ratio population complete fucking idiots. I'm counting happening seeing one two viable political parties hinge entire platform keeping people uneducated scared dark. pathetic, embarrassing, outright maddening. ...... read 700 comments people Bill Gates could anything it... duh, remember CDC said masks ineffective Fauci said undisputable evidence asymptomatic transmission late January. it! help medicated American Population is.

Look many people given Benzodiazepine scripts per year dude. insane. Also, comparison money actually spent federal unemployment assistance; top regular unemployment, since unemployment generally paid state individually, state EI taxes.  
This year, date, federal government paid 430 billion USD (566.86 billion CAD) unemployment benefits.  
That number usually billion, way states handle unemployment federal government workers generally.

Compare Canada's CERB payment, which, date, 77.99 billion CAD (~59.16 billion USD).  

It keep population difference, come close.  
We 9.09 times population.  
We spent 7.27 times amount (and, mentioned, that's actually addition standard state unemployment.)

Those numbers far apart generally perceived be. Weird, mine took 14 hours. nurse apologized taking long apperently backed day. Fortunately negative. school Massachusetts regularly administers tests come back 12-15 hours. seen anti-mask propaganda. People believe act control devil worshiping politicians. Also, usually haven‚Äôt experienced loss COVIF personally thus believe it. Tons people don‚Äôt believe things happen do. many people sick, right? sick people, could spread virus people line, expected stand line 6 hours straight trying deal coronavirus symptoms? world messed right now.

And line positive can't really rely test results may picked standing line symptomatic people six hours. So, it, sure put right getting getting tested. course. ever get tired assuming bad faith? That's barely anybody lives ... nova Scotia shity province live almost bad new Brunswick think post-vaccine, people wear mask they‚Äôre required ‚Äî stores, public transportation, office workplace. private social gatherings, masks come off. 

Masks social distancing really two separate things always linked together reason. People vaccinated going indoor, no-mask get-togethers. Friends families simply aren‚Äôt going go years without seeing other. People haven‚Äôt without vaccine! need somewhat accurate self-administered rapid test accommodate reality. TIL person Ph.D. political science ‚Äúblow doll.‚Äù What's probability someone thinks breathing issues qualifies asymptomatic respiratory virus actually ""taking precautions?"" thinks high runner also would go run ‚Äúclear infection‚Äù. rest long. ‚ÄúI'll sweat mentality‚Äù.... also hate skip many days.  got test done yesterday told it‚Äôd two days. forgot ask included Sunday not...I‚Äôm quarantining (and feel like shit) everyone conscientious. You‚Äôre statement opinion US ‚Äúgetting worse‚Äù :) get sick. Also takes evidence catch recommendations. Theyre still saying droplet virus airborne hvac unit hospital equipped handle airborne virus. Also testing trash right now, many false negatives. take full precautions treat everyone positives including coworkers, especially since group test anyone unless they're symptomatic. airborne virus impossible socially distance untested coworkers, yes n95 evidence based practice. quote old post free vs. paid test experience US (degrees went wrong building first since labeled suite 101 paying enough Anyway, place super crowded, broken A/C hot summer day, kids screaming, heard someone asking 9:15 appointment ETA 10:30, pretty much everyone minority, likely poor, people waiting outside 100+ degree heat crowded probably free tests care, COVID walked across street building appointment. Everyone friendly, crowded all, A/C working. Even though 15 minutes late due going wrong building, wait 5 minutes. paid $99. $99 big deal people, is. I've read stories car lines miles long free COVID test, sitting 100-110 degree sun, baking got results back within 12 hours. people, goes system test half results day, creating massive backlog (at least I've read, probably varies town town). knows many days wait? $99 worth sitting hot sun day weekend waiting maybe week test results? me. many people, reality. they're one same, right? Also, make maybe 2-4 posts day. **The virus going eradicated.**  compared similar countries. He‚Äôs point. He‚Äôs amazing guy. Still reminds ‚Äúinterviews‚Äù government 95/IE case swiftly evaded every single question. fucking knows shit. Amazing person happy helping humanity rather everyone us does.. basically destroying it.  RIP We're literally working around clock get results out. I've three days since May. Demand testing equipment high supply non-existent. way get testing times get everyone's thick skulls need wear masks stop going restaurants. know viruses spread way. know survives surfaces hours-days depending conditions. we're told wash hands clean frequently touched objects. seen yet actual data shows much virus lifted various surfaces.  

While likelihood virus *can* spread way high, mean it'll happen easily. Airborne transmission still biggest threat. One single solitary drop critical thinking would cleanse remaining ideas feasible eradicate virus. critical thinking evidently short supply.   really test differentiate flu, fever corona? Neither flight then, right? reason allowed driving isn‚Äôt? impression it‚Äôs ok crossing Trust people right thing?  resident PNW, years horrible forest management resulted worst air quality world week. Trump nothing that. Oh can, pay 150 dollars it. Source: Florida. survived two bouts cancer.   Outdoors heavy mask usage vs indoors masks. Big difference. Actually, cheeks already like that! need ears! Lol  times I‚Äôve tested wasn‚Äôt asked. traveled state country. guess flying implied, drive 3 different states house 3 hours less. 10%?! like 110% Feedback loop. hear nothing screeching both.  definitely one major bright spot. advances made treatment disease, understanding viruses general grown substantially last 6 months. Public health severely underfunded last decades.  fuck you! verify numbers math yourself. video making simple enough anyone understand.  offense taken! I'm feeling better anyways, find weird long given said would take 72 hours. I'll probably call tomorrow see what's going on. Marbles, Wine Healthy food quotes story priceless. Yeah sterilizing immunity always goal people paying attention. Lots people interested knowy answers. govt muzzling scientists also early on. longest amount time anyone recovered ~8months.....organ damage may take time show up. scenario five age group ifr craziest shit I've read sub long shot I've read lot. People fucking _smallpox,_ bruh, **absolutely not** going COVID. Get grip. people forget part believe may infected, need quarantine await results?

The moment ran paid time off. Half Americans afford 400$ emergency covid, 1 2 weeks unpaid leave middle months hours cut past 5? Ah, yes protesting urban centers affect anything since Rona woke af Yeah, 3 week wait. I'm symptomatic, antibodies joke. drive side town town mean one largest cities US. Wait, anyone think wasn‚Äôt outrageous Gates said so? people obsessed him? I‚Äôm planning wearing mask staying mostly home (ie eating person going church person movies theater etc) doctor‚Äôs office stops saying everybody building must masked times. know darned well don‚Äôt hold onto immunity vaccines, covid different mumps chicken pox flu? buy envo use money. Im taking anything anyone. private sector outright criminal. gotten lot better. Early September drive tru self administered Covid test. got results next day night. July took week get results place. do, doing. Present tense. failure still existent battling CV19 Source? made asshole comment made assumptions frustration others. apologies hope get results soon. Actually* throat swab tests pretty easy yourself, unpleasant. take keep gagging, swab can't tell difference ""40 seconds"" ""4 reps 10 seconds."" mean, he's big tech anymore. He's big philanthropy.

 also specifically called government testing made mention anyone medical field

Did even read purposely misrepresenting said? Everyone guessing. truly impossible know, make assumptions based similar viruses. 

The fact people recover due immune response. immune response last certain length time. one knows exactly long it'll last typically lasts year viruses Covid-19 year old yet. Hospitals laid staff elective procedures stopped **we didn‚Äôt enough PPE** hand order protect healthcare workers patients. 

Elective procedures stopped order slow spread, stopped weren‚Äôt enough supplies. 

Someone should‚Äôve invoked DPA. Sweden fine got results cali less 24 hours

EDIT: person downvoted lmao. stated fact results Back March, virus probably much know. much test, social distancing hospitals overrun. time-out needed get things control. case count higher seems cases mild assymptomatic. Europe well slow summer came, wanted numbers prove distancing masks help.  Lmfao Rachel Maddow? üò≠üòÇüòÇüòÇ Curious positivity rate exactly. article states 4%. Earlier month, 8% many tests without positives, almost certainly testing asymptomatic people, making comparisons two sample populations difficult. serious effort randomly test sample population?

If going let news cases run lives, data publicly released every day every aspect test: exact location, whether person symptoms, whether hospitalized, cycle threshold level test. random meaningless comment. welldone changed minds?

I'm sure begin accusing ""the liberal media"" murdering him. course people, large, idiots really idea vaccine taken nearly decade develop. politicians realised could use people's fear act tough increase popularity. mind, there's known number avoidable deaths fine? Also, single government stating single intent wondering changed actually even make sense.

Edit: Lol Trumpista downvoters. guys would eat dog shit told to. No, already done. People learned live virus. dangle mask around neck whatever pandemic. extreme narcissist he‚Äôll say best job ever forever fornever ever. big problem opinion articles getting equal weight actual news, lot ""fake news"" originates. gives outlets chance make tenuous claims still deniability - ""we never said that! opinion piece!"" plan never let virus spread. lockdowns supposed get levels virus low enough spread could controlled testing contact tracing alone. US UK locked down. Sweden didn‚Äôt. sounds like US regulators aren‚Äôt convinced. Nah, Blackberry. ""Previously, CDC said keep ""good social distance"" around 6 feet, cover mouth nose mask around others stressing replace measures now. steps hand-washing disinfection remained same."" happen though? There's much article, 7% poverty part makes immediate sense - everyone's badly hurt economically. Actually I'm bit surprised low 7%, perhaps that's specifically ""extreme poverty"", whatever precisely means. vaccine coverage dropping? Well, lead less testing... Yeah money stimulus package comes thin air. talking ability reinfect someone, huge difference 0 cases 1 case. answer yes, reinfection possible. 

The percentage low (for now), possibility exists. One country took national response one country briefly tried herd immunity realized mistake. I'm sure great points comparison. Valid points.
The flu vaccine 100% guarantee, along many wearing masks, may bigger help. US here. Pay attention what?  Japanese Government never acknowledged wrongdoing payed little terms war crimes. want see something amoral disgusting look ‚ÄúNanking Massacre‚Äù ‚ÄúUnit 731‚Äù. agree America perfect definitely innocent don‚Äôt think Japan country matter is. exactly, well said. pro vaccine. much so. 

Also pro-mask. 

But anti-*mandatory* mask, anti-*mandatory* vaccine. 

If make mandatory, turn people like me, side, you. Came say look forward seeing data. curious, intend keep house working? Pre 9/11 flying easy community spread stopped, contact tracing improving progression sewage monitoring think much difficult now. several layers progression virus pass getting foothold again. that‚Äôs beauty it. get new outbreak tomorrow contact trace lock people down, everyone else able continue living like normal. whole lives. I've heard stories people dying hospital results came back. see data overall USA rates infection, deaths, etc chart form starting February? One links post stopped updating months ago Hopkins data set way.

Aside willful neglect misrepresentation, trying generalize example logical fallacy. simply work. claims hold water, similarly say news critical Trump fake news said so. again, you‚Äôre already latter claiming Chinese news untrustworthy.

P.s. you‚Äôve barely written paragraphs. isn‚Äôt much emphasize bolded text. Ahoy bye. I‚Äôm sorry family‚Äôs loss honest, outraged irresponsible statements. Tell would telling family ‚Äúif got Corona, got Corona‚Äù work? GED understand science better CDC It‚Äôs bad. US UK worse. I‚Äôm sorry depressed 24/7 can‚Äôt see family make friends without big ass distance constant restrictions isn‚Äôt improvement life quality ... Lockdowns definitely helped. Yeah guess right know it, also know troll people.

It's really sad even news agencies like Reuters behave like trolls nowadays. 

Also really simple easy understand piece information like ""there flu year"" (8 words!) seemingly become known outside covid nerd circles.

It's really like, total breakdown flow information.

Edit: getting minuses this? Many articles posted ""no flu southern hemisphere season"". Reuters know that? mean, they're NEWS AGENCY, better informed lol. check sub. crazy even that. Many us still think so.  got fight right, communism!! absolutely does. federal government coordinating national effort distribute tests labs available capacity. lack federal involvement negligent best absolutely criminal worst. Trump said many times would like limit tests, I‚Äôm leaning toward criminal. Much respect Australians governments. wish here. People care one bit government same. solution problem simple. Put money right people lobby groups. Wait it‚Äôs airborne? /s 45 would never Spanish flu virus still circulating still causing major outbreaks periodically. recently, caused 2009 swine flu pandemic.

We successfully eradicated one endemic human virus history: smallpox. people wedding held accountable selfish. pandemic everything you. Yeah, that‚Äôs important right now. üôÑ We‚Äôve 1-2 day turnarounds Michigan past month so. I‚Äôm little worried someone‚Äôs rubber stamping ‚Äúnegative‚Äù lab forms, took 5-9 days minimum. Australia island desert. I‚Äôm surprised ‚Äú7 week strict lockdown‚Äù didn‚Äôt bring absolute zero. 

US hope replicate country 330 million people. (Australia 25 million.) like USPS deliberately sabotaged...  strange accusatory defensive people get feel view point supported.

If rational discussion cost benefits many different approaches around world less politics played, perhaps better outcomes society could achieved. 

I don‚Äôt believe simply binary scenario lockdown nothing outcomes generate terrible outcomes different parts community. perfectly fine job herd immunity. dont know Bill guy about. w8 properly locked 4 real lockdown never quite went far enough last entire year... fuck up??? WWFD motto whole time 

(What Wouldn‚Äôt Fauci Do) feels like prelude another lockdown. Oh gee look that, works. really works. likely Trumps gonna win matter what. I'm happy this. facts. No, excuse me, American exceptionalism informed situation States. need find another economic problem /s going happen. people, including government officials still understood exponential growth is. Hospitals also overflowing moment everything dandy. 

Entire Europe sleeping, again. New measures rising infections joke. understand gets harder harder control later act. Oh yeah you‚Äôre loving road blocks? police entering homes wrongspeak? guess don‚Äôt know ‚Äúnear makes difference‚Äù means.

1:500,000 rounding error north 0.

I swear y‚Äôall *want* forever

Edit:

#I RETRACT STATEMENT. WORLD NEVER SAFE AGAIN, LITERALLY DANGER FOREVER outrageous american still think Covid like flu. South Korea still finding 10-20 new cases day among people arriving 14 day quarantine. that's one International airport. many entering US every day? really feels like they've given up. That‚Äôs true. Asians wear masks sick. don‚Äôt *all* wear masks flu season. ever Asia? fucking people work maintain life. don‚Äôt get paid waiting test. Reddit understand that? Reptiles can‚Äôt use Internet know don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up. beginning thought flattening curve spread fairly inevitable without vaccine(unless China guess) preventing eventual financial collapse, least small businesses. change trying get low possible vaccine matter what? Testing one things country actually do. Testing free everyone need contact doctor book test. I'd throw face. ""Why rush? think he'll get re-elected? expect lose? supporting loser?"" providing solutions press time? feel guilt sick. would hurt anyone merely ask another test. Quarantine good might contagious something else. 

They wanted back. back.

*And absolutely SYMPTOMS Covid. presents bit different everyone. sell panic. China-lover needs get medical degree issues health decrees. us going get vaccine demon. live agree, really isn't. wear beanie winter cold, wear facemask virus.  worst places were/are city centers run demonrats?  listen him? He's even doctor. weird Reuters know flu season.

The anti corona measures nearly eradicated flu winter Southern Hemisphere. expect thing happen north.

EDIT: post ""rules followed USA"", consider think followed letter countries Southern hemisphere - like Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, South Africa.  ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù wears on. hurt feefees? I‚Äôm confused...haven‚Äôt known months? obviously still wrong. get doctors actually use it? can‚Äôt even get doctors use health app. still take plane see family, assuming live US. accept you‚Äôre incurring small risk catching Covid. able get mine done 20 minutes. Total time drive, wait, consultation, test drive back home maybe 2.5 hours. one silent minority sees really going on, know alone. site run far-lefts think science God Bill Gates saviour. demon force vaccine profit it. suckered pressure mob downvotes. narrative showing deceitful twist reality. Gulf countries treat imported labour badly? Shocker! time write boss demanding air purifiers. people don‚Äôt understand phase 3 trials designed discover rare serious side effects, designed evaluate efficacy common side effects. 

Ok, case transverse myelitis coming within first 18000 doses distributed. might coincidence don‚Äôt know, seriously anyone developer claiming know sure it‚Äôs related must lying. cannot evaluate correlation little information. Add case multiple sclerosis within 18000 doses. Might well unconnected, least know exaggeration symptoms vaccination resulted serious adverse event. 

Now we‚Äôre closing real problem. Transverse myelitis correlated previous infections previous vaccination. Therefore, suddenly discover case urgent vaccine study, must proceed extremely carefully. I‚Äôm senior consultant Infectious Diseases pro-vaccination. current information study would never life volunteer study moment. asked colleagues couldn‚Äôt find one single person would volunteer. wonder present current situation candidates participation? Certain countries cult like following here, Australia, Sweden etc case curious downvotes. Potentially Depressing news thankfully promising vaccines almost far along. heard anything bad yet really hope stays way. cares thinks! Just... start living normally now, assuming you‚Äôre state allows it. Yup. Almost masters (just need 5 classes). It‚Äôs disgusting little one make. husband works hourly mechanic gets 22 dollars hour degree. go time ask raise (within reason) way make unless go back school get debt loans. 

It‚Äôs unfathomable.  Australia got mine 22 hours latter weekend, test saturday result Sunday. 37% false negative 5% false positive. tripping feel like social distancing little none around one year point aint happening.

That's prediction. already happened.

1. New York City: Massachusetts: Ohio: San Antonio: Arizona: Last, least, Milwaukee:  could see Germany locking necessary there's way country like Portugal locking again. economy can't handle it. Maybe reply hoax False. could drop social distancing mask mandates right 99.9% us, life would go on.

The thing prolonging measures constantly shifting goalposts. want first person thread that's fucking idiot 80 billion dollars. he‚Äôs outraged, can‚Äôt something? hiding news restricting couple times week instead constant marathon depression. might missed videos. That's really fucking disappointing people still follow all... already government's intention propaganda always obvious, corroboration, people found government largely truthful. Western world ""liberal independent free media"" that, assuming must truth among myriad outlets, denial choosing narrative fits one's preconceptions.

If really care, could important recent article China-Western relations. message applies far beyond thre covid topic.

http://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hue58k/a_fearful_asymmetry_covid19_and_americas/ Yikes! Florida took 3 hours get swabbed 5 hours results. 

Twice. put hotels early days pandemic. know that's still happening. Ok countries saying handled perfectly? Why? government, levels, incompetant.

They anything incompetent. government functioning exactly want to.

Why people assuming interests government aligns general public? don't. Hot bby probably never there. like from. Flown like four five times year vacations last twenty years last seven months vaccine. really surprised many people willing risk sharing plane 100+ randos pandemic. Sinovac inactivated vectored vaccine, vectored vaccine live. would reasonable compare vaccine CanSino Gamaleya's vaccines. Fuck Bill. mean lower mortality could also due fact 35% US cases still active including .5M last two weeks cases result dilute actual rate. rate actual cases outcomes 4.9 according worldometer vs 2.9 take cases think numbers basing assumptions might confounding factors. definitely going differences nations get better treating disease number factors I'm really convinced line reasoning main cause. Alternatively maybe I've got numbers wrong, getting 2% number from? get checked Lyme disease work job like this. hired 2016 4 year degree kind (not necessarily science) required. 2017 knocked high school diploma/GED. think initial degree requirement mostly bring people could stick something 4+ years way prevent bunch 18 year olds applying without actually limiting age. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs age discrimination illegal. Honestly anyone long pay attention detail able follow instructions.

Edit: mom actually test samples? might needed degree certification. work testing, scanning/labeling/sorting etc. sister husband work fast food make (individually). would totally jump ship become night stocker fast food worker I‚Äôm staying insurance covers family mom works restaurant, one employees came it. one knew tested coughed brother said ""Don't give corona"". weekend two weeks ago. result came back positive Monday. lot employees little get together Sunday there. Everyone called in, shut two weeks. Thankfully mom get it.

Trump insufferable twat, administration, forget part blame pandemic certainly lies absolutely braindead populace nation. got mine 10 minutes. India. Free. agree general sentiment appreciate info. FYI last time 2000 Americans died day covid May. educated ones there, keeping small pox around inside frozen canister something? 

Same reason still hang onto nukes. Yes, biological warfare frowned upon, never ""not table"".

Also, helps something culturable make vaccines, case need arises. hostile agent uses engineered smallpox trickier culture us, samples original smallpox would invaluable. get number 50%? ass? Hey uh marketable skills, recent negative covid test, could emigrate country? Idk went free testing site. Made account website paperwork. Next day result online. Less ideal government bankrupting private businesses denying right operate? Pick poison 4 years experience. Making salary started 4 years ago. pay freeze meaning extra money experience. 

I get pay raise pursuing masters. 1000 dollars year.... pay 16k worth student loans üôÑ saw chart flu vaccine. Every year different percentage effectiveness. averages around 50%. half people get vaccine protected. also often heard still get flu, bad. 

But, flu mutates every year sometimes more. make vaccine, guessing strain flu exposed to. Last year effectiveness pretty bad 29%. Coronavirus mutated quickly, good news probably higher effectiveness level. people get vaccinated, less chance others catch it. best bet get vaccine. 

Also, multiple vaccines. flu 1 year. Possibly production gets high enough, get 1 vaccine. increase effectiveness. Good her! I‚Äôm sorry go though! Gotta get experimental chemo. Flights pretty empty prices saving fair amount money. Moderna one vaccine developer, six others stage 3 last checked (maybe now).

AstraZeneka/Oxford orders 2+ Billion doses end 2021, Chinese developing vaccines, Russians well, India one stage 2 IIRC, Taiwan, Australia Israel also vaccines developments. people even getting N95 masks?? talking about? openly mocks them. dozens recordings videos there.  Obviously unimportant detail sinophobia drives views. live Arizona. pay freeze district can‚Äôt move matter 5 years experience (next year 5th) 50 years experience. I‚Äôll making started at, unless miracle miracle happens given bigger budget. 

Also rate treating teachers don‚Äôt think anyone profession 30 years. It‚Äôs scary.  live NYC, went Modern MD Bushwick. rapid test results less 20mins. Needed another test bc take stress test..went clinic Queens received results night..AND didn‚Äôt pay cent.. many people wear masks.  greatly exaggerated reddit. Yes would work countries continued keep borders closed vaccines distributed throughout populations. point is... people quarantine get infected food day 10 day 14 test positive counts like imported case? easy control international planes, China island, large borders. control? China Israel walls fences everywhere... dont ilegal transit trough borders? look Spain, every single day people come africa boats jumping fences Melilla Ceuta... live small spanish island mediterrenean far africa compared areas even got boats ilegal people... racism, right inmigration, dont seems legit china dont outbreaks ilegal inmigration, borders many countries, poor ones, China strong economy lot work. takes time government process index everyone‚Äôs DNA main database. Warrant DNA? Pfft, let‚Äôs Jack shit potential life threatening virus they‚Äôll submit DNA us. I‚Äôm honestly surprised Facebook wasn‚Äôt offering super rapid testing sites could gather info everyone Wow, amazing satire summarizes everything wrong discourse world today. 

I hope.  Cheese rice! Bill... put damn money damn mouth run god damn office vote you. I‚Äôve realized year take advantage it. takes certain caring person teacher. prey knowing they‚Äôd go way help kids. It‚Äôs sick.  traveled expensive. get sick feels like given. figured yet. reason people really thing can't afford to.  knowingly knew COVID &amp; instead self isolating 14 days flew two different cities... USA 3rd per capita covid testing, behind Israel UK  Yep. knew wasn‚Äôt going pay, husband mechanic makes degree 5 classes away masters. It‚Äôs load crap. would love that, damn much. room mates keep throwing parties, ignoring feelings don‚Äôt want get sick (I‚Äôm working solution right now) like, started coughing really hard, except show symptoms cold Covid. I‚Äôd love get tested live, 16 locations tests, need recommended doctor order receive test, doctor won‚Äôt recommend don‚Äôt fever, meanwhile governor said excellent testing response trying cut back testing testing infrastructure actually probably best world. issue many freaking people need tests. I'm Coors Banquet kinda guy personally. Gotta keep classy. So, couldn‚Äôt leverage wealth develop rapid tests? I'm thinking one Putin's minions. good luck next couple weeks thinking outrageous nobody finds strange places getting Winter weather September Yes, one biggest issues pandemic exposed (but us knew already) health care system patchwork uncoordinated makes national response almost impossible. incredible amount resources country. think frustrates many us poorly use them. Also overweight/obese, unlike pretty much *every* victim.  What's evidence far getting re-infected severe disease? Fauci said vaccine would work enough people take it, mean vaxxers still vulnerable getting serious illness anti-vaxxers?

Do need population immunized short timeframe immunity wears off, going work?  case, think society get without locking individuals properly mask experience symptoms see others experiencing symptoms. 


I'm aware asymptomatic mean ""not infectious"" much infectious symptomatic. Putting mask even symptomatic still helps decreasing spread (of course, best society would sick self-quarantine). 


The reason US many countries crushed pandemic lot symptomatics still improperly wearing masks (ex. nose-dicking) self-isolating social functions group recreation. flew Thursday flying back home tomorrow. Something get used middle seats blocked off. leg room. :) virus spread globally. going eliminated.  ironic see Reddit group people can't understand masks infringe ability socially communicate public. they're antisocial main form communication outside world Reddit social media. 

Don't get wrong, masks necessary evil people seriously clueless subreddit can't see people want wear lol. best part always cite Asian countries like Japan HUGE social problems lack community. got tested Dallas got results within 30 minutes. free! Pretty amazing. Thank Walgreens! Similar things happening elsewhere. confirms virus deadly people age 80 hard contain entered confined space huge number vulnerable hosts available...It's common sense..

This would probably hold true virus outbreaks types homes. 

My great great grandfather 86 got sick common cold long term care home. turned pneumonia unfortunately died it. 

People LTC close end lives tremendous risk sickness, covid not... 4th year teacher rural area. pay freeze I‚Äôm making made 4 years ago. Except got 1000 dollar increase 12 credit hours. (Was trying time get masters) get 1000 bonus finish masters. Realized crap quit ahead. guess 15-20 percent.  Sorry, realize rude point problem entirely avoidable.

If aware exists choose give birth anyway, contributing willingly? I'm saying problem exist, avoidable one. made claims. Crazy people living rock, know Wings! deaths percentage population. Total cases point almost completely artifact testing. Italy 300k confirmed cases, death rate would suggest actually somewhere 3 6 million cases. Ditto Spain, France, UK. Additionally, countries seeing new surge cases ramp testing. Deaths always lag, US slight downswing Europe upswing, meaning handful European countries deaths per capita US, several trending wrong direction US either flat trending right direction. major metro areas US experienced surge cases biggest ones declining. remains seen happen next several months, Europe probably look lot worse first, US look better months another uptick Meanwhile, [here though, whatever guys Maritimes NL, keep up. Good you. state, thankfully, always absentee voting (vote mail), without give reason.  
You file per year, ballots mailed year.   
It necessary thing, given truly remote rural Alaska be.

So wait November voice heard. Actually realm possibility. Covidtracking project estimates 50 million. incidents happen less likely people going take vaccine. percent people take already 60% 50% *week*.  Good know, glad I'm planning fly time soon, since N95s getting long tooth. situation I'd put surgical mask whole thing hope would satisfy them? think would impair breathing since pancake style P100 cartridges allow intake sides. Lol no, wait 10 days results CVS.. options around couldn‚Äôt schedule test appointment least 3 days even though websites said appointment needed..  see flu vaccine usually get milder flu Testing without quick results, thorough contact tracing consistent respected social distancing policies anything stop spread. gives tested individual diagnosis time testing, again, nothing stop spread.

Trumps unwillingness lead country pandemic entitled base believes falling in-line rest country (wearing masks, social distancing, etc) violation civil liberties. Given significant portion population caught right make decisions per constitution negates measures stop spread half may trying implement. either need large/majority portion population support anti spread policies worth it.

Trump encourages anti-establishment behavior words actions daily basis entitled base believe right. Claiming 2 terms one example.

Btw, flew Vienna airport day, took test airport results emailed within 5 hours.

Am American living Europe. see lot complaints media people getting tests quickly enough country. imagine labs really busy moment people running getting stressed. want say thanks work. lesson learnt stricter lockdown less economic damage long run. Selective lockdowns hand merely create stress uncertainty pulls economy long run. better said cover journalism area. Nobody quantified far reaching costs letting outbreak spread uncontained either.

In terms currently containing outbreak though, would say numbers success. go procedure hospital made take test beforehand. result came back day. long hospital needs make money, skip ahead testing order guess.  making money working? mean making little unemployment made ""rich""? first test July lost. I‚Äôve always gone free site fair grounds. *&lt;I posted COVID19 sub I'm sure sub right place goes ...

When virus appeared initially massive lockdowns etc. Clearly correct approach idea dealing with.

However better idea lethality COVID-19. nice Black Death either.

In view I'm puzzled many/most governments still treat virus grave threat.

Have missed something risks associated COVID-19? bill gates doesnt live america, hes rich. antigen molecule exists surface cell tends degree specificity cell.

Sweden's big spike late May. data easily accessible you. incubation 3 come twisted conclution? Finland got hit less hard didnt large portion population traveling februari...

Based actual comparison less relevant, relevant. can't compare two increadibly flawed data sources... Compare deaths per capita see Finland ha d√§r breeze compared Sweden.

It's almost though Finland's lockdown prevented did.

Already average deaths per year bit 90,000... Therefor less 90,000 deaths per year mortality...

Just fyi, 2019 less 90k matter excess deaths counted 2019 only. uses average past 10 years, means 'under morality' argument relevant factor.

[(92k*9) + (89k)]/10 = 91.7k. average death count excess deaths counted close 2019 numbers 'under mortality' anything trivial factor.

How hard spouting shit new Zealand hit less hard then?...

I said New Zealand far fewer cases/deaths.

When say New Zealand's economy hit less hard? Again, did, free quote I'll admit wrong. can't No... links show relatively similar, albeit slightly higher Sweden. also difference that's smaller difference GDP losses Q2 2020.

That said, none data linked comes close showing lockdown damages economy. really, what's clearly larger (not much larger) trade services Finland much larger new Zealand (percentage wise).

You're using trade services actually involves domestic trade irrelevant.

Let's use actual breakdown rely service industry similar levels. New Zealand, whose tourism sector makes bigger % service industry, hardest hit. see trend reflected GDP drop Q2 2020. Again, deflecting main point - exactly figures show lockdowns hurt someone deathbed happen covid system pass, person die covid casues put situation, age, cancer etc?

As **every disease**, would still COVID death factors listed co-morbidities. That's counted every part world Sweden goverment made clear counting way (over counting) propper way untill finalize propper report pandemic ""over"". helath authority speculates likely time early 2022.

Source this? know health agency frequently adjusts numbers, quite often downwards, know conspiracy social media isnt exactly paper/study local health authority.... Thinking beyond ludicrous.

Who's saying same? study wrong, interpretation 70% count COVID death wrong. I've given link explain comparing Sweden neighbours New Zealand short sighted, none Swedish neighbours options lockdown hit beginning. new Zealand small island country middle nowhere. wonder managed pandemic good done.

Do make complaints people use Sweden comparison lockdowns work? I'm clarifying misinformation them. 

Lockdowns damage economy. temporarily restrict movements, many post-lockdown countries enjoyed same, more, freedoms countries so. also absolute work minimizing cases/deaths (NY good example), followed population complies social distancing guidelines and/or mask mandates. part disagree with?

Sweden lockdown deal fact caused higher cases/deaths per capita. hand, social distancing requirements enforced well, helped contained outbreak. Good country that, agree Sweden's strategy could worked countries we've seen non-compliant larger segment population following social distancing wearing masks. First time comment full truth. said anything immunity? claimed young children \*less likely infect others infected, older children adults\*. opposite claim would young children \*equally likely transmit\* older children adults. Whether difference small large varies studies, seen single one claiming equal, several claiming less. don‚Äôt think anyone expects NZ crush virus globally. 

The crushing they‚Äôve done twice national level. ***c p l m*** would totally travel back time relive Era. well, 9/11 happened. Sweden currently 5-10 times death rate neighbors. chance whatsoever ever exceed Sweden‚Äôs given improvements treatment last 6 months likely vaccine next 6. country fucking mess guy fucks. issue government failure, know, opposite capitalism?

oh yeah, *masks fucking idiots*.

TBH blame airlines (specifically United) I'd add ...

I'm one 4k specialists 40 mln country capable providing vital health care service keeping online fucking priority.

What I'm getting is... system comes first. come 2nd. That's work public health greater individual health (as shitty sound). Unfortunately able NJ NY worst deaths per capita planet, mostly two things mentioned. Since getting new job haven‚Äôt much time keep research, transmission dependent environmental factors level shedding infected. I‚Äôve seen numbers show excess little 10 minutes close contact mid-level risk, go-to 15-30 minutes depending type contact.

I haven‚Äôt seen they‚Äôve made determinants viral load infectious average immune system, seems severity illness dependent viral load, fairly intuitive. It‚Äôs also discussed kids shed higher viral load, person present immune system also impacts risk level.

In essence, it‚Äôs complicated determine accurate risk, minimizing risk much possible safest choice matter scenario. So...maybe that's indication shutdowns anything regarding virus, whole lot damage world around us? neighbor mine severe upper respiratory infection March couldn‚Äôt kick. course couldn‚Äôt get tested. really suspected virus. couple weeks later took hospital chest pains, doctor said pericarditis. laid low couple weeks‚Äîwe grocery shopping ran errands needed‚Äîand slowly month got better. never asked got antibody test symptoms over. Actually probably closer 7m

Like...what? 

No, can't that. That's ludicrous.

My boyfriend thinks I'm insane get spun every time see sign says this, perpetuating absolute nonsense. Even know vaccine 50% effective? percentage effective would need resume taking precautions? 

As long lot spread area, I'm going take precautions, regardless vaccines. Many countries ? think need check math. strangely made peace fact live failed state.

Cases risen cinema closed again.

Not sure smartest move go honest, cases low P3/n95/kn95 mask, think risk would minimum, especially go early plan eating anything.

I really feel bad cinema industry, best make everyone safe, honestly best thing would banning people eating, take masks off. Also, sell kn95/n95 masks possible.

## ABSTRACT

**Background** COVID-19 pandemic enormous threat healthcare systems economies worldwide urgently demands effective preventive therapeutic strategies. Unlike development vaccines new drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2, repurposing approved clinically tested drugs provide immediate solution.

**Methods** applied novel computational approach search among approved clinically tested drugs DrugBank database. Candidates selected based Shannon entropy homology predefined activity profiles three small molecules proven anti-SARS-CoV activity published data set. Antiviral activity predicted drug, azelastine, tested *in vitro* SARS-CoV-2 infection assays Vero E6 monkey kidney epithelial cells reconstituted human nasal tissue. effect viral replication assessed quantification viral genomes droplet digital PCR.

**Findings** computational approach four independent queries identified major drug families, often overlapping fashion anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-histamine neuroactive drugs. Azelastine, histamine 1 receptor-blocker, predicted multiple screens, based attractive safety profile availability nasal formulation, selected experimental testing. Azelastine significantly reduced cytopathic effect SARS-CoV-2 infection Vero E6 cells EC50 ‚àº6 ŒºM preventive treatment setting. Furthermore, azelastine commercially available nasal spray tested 5-fold dilution highly potent inhibiting viral propagation SARS-CoV-2 infected reconstituted human nasal tissue.

**Interpretations** Azelastine, anti-histamine, available nasal sprays developed allergic rhinitis may considered topical prevention treatment nasal colonization SARS-CoV-2. such, could useful reducing viral spread prophylaxis COVID-19. Ultimately, potential benefit proven clinical studies. Who's dying cause we're wearing masks? one lol. Hospitalizations deaths decreasing weeks hear case counts. fucking cares 6,000,000 test positive Rona 99.7% survivability rate Staff limiting factor. Obviously could provided hospital care many people. Obviously taken sicklings care homes care homes set treat Covid they're experts transmission. would saved thousand lives easily. never staff treat people.

ICU treatment needed develop severe lung damage. Small percentage. Nobody putting grandma ventilator. wrong. Even restrictions, would still take many months years get herd immunity. 

But certainly seems advocating position since suggesting current approach stretches pandemic reason. Maybe aware message sends? Question: went shopping today, sparsely populated place. friend‚Äôs bday. feel jittery 5 hours trip face little red. symptoms? I‚Äôm getting tested tmr, worried scared now. know acknowledge stupid. never switched. They're two separate goals. short term goal mitigation, since that's realistically hope right now. Everything public surrounding COVID today effort mitigate effects pandemic. long term goal always eradication. It'll take while, want mitigating effects long can.  one hopes national administration works science around virus also considers consequences people needed actions contain virus. 

How many people could helped quarantine 2-5 millions dollars virus stimulus went Kanye West's company (as one example) used help people stay home necessary? see game, small moments like important! seems like reasonable conclusion. lockdowns failed. someone suffered clinical depression Bi-Polar adult life, heart goes everyone covid caused depression anxiety to. know hard, focus things life made happy know someday covid gone happy times come back, even better. Honestly, that's decent trend. Good luck Americans, seems blowing right direction maybe.  American companies ~~reverse engineer it~~ steal IP.

FTFY No. back July told expect back 9 business days. BUSINESS DAYS. 

Understand ‚Äúanyone can‚Äôt wait 14 days selfish‚Äù comment coming place massive, blind privilege. really believe people cannot go half month income selfish? genuinely curious. got results day 14. point ""you can't get sick plane"".

The point planes apparently superspreader events COVID-19. real question is: many haven‚Äôt caught?

Edit: downplaying number slightest, it‚Äôs tip iceberg compared full scope awful virus. still many unknowns 6 months pandemic, hope next 6 months shed light better time America. Last thought e scaled back testing... NZ corona virus reintroduced quarantine breach

The new community outbreak genomically linked quarantine cases. panhandle Florida long waits whole time. want pay $75, insurance likely cover, get one blood rapid tests. 
I fully expect Florida's numbers drop, due testing done currently (hurricane). past lot clean phase testing stations back up, spike again. Lots clean going people wearing masks. stores also given covid protocols due hurricane. going fun. rhetorical question. keep seeing articles people claim asymptomatic, except for..... Oh elites Spanish Flu targeted others late teens-20s age groups. strongest immune systems. Northern Virginia got mine within 12. I‚Äôm sure Bill Gates problem getting results. bet doesn‚Äôt feel sorry using privilege. people wear masks planes! aircraft's air system + masks makes planes low risk place covid Ok found this: [Loss Bcl-6-Expressing Follicular Helper Cells Germinal Centers early know long antibodies persist patients recovering COVID-19. However, mild severe disease, antibodies specific SARS-CoV-2 virus lack certain hallmarks characteristically seen antibodies lead long-lived immune responses. sought understand antibodies COVID-19 may lack unique feature study examined blood COVID-19 patients, specific sites body immune responses SARS-CoV-2 virus disrupts memory-making process preventing development cells help B cells form germinal centers. body cannot form germinal centers, cannot create memory B cells remember fight believe culprit likely COVID-19 cytokine storms‚Äîlarge influxes immune signaling molecules disrupt immune system‚Äôs normal result, person infected second time, immune system may remember best fight it, leading ‚Äúimmune amnesia.‚Äù unusual phenomenon vastly reduces chances developing robust long-lived herd immunity natural relied natural infection alone clear virus population large, would likely immunity recovered patients months could chance reinfection perhaps six months year later. studied phenomenon detail severe COVID-19 infections, far evidence mild infections create memory B cells.


Let know would like horrifying information new virus never seen 200,000 years existence. Measles virus also causes ""immune amnesia"" leaving people open multiple reinfections well making immune system forget past battles leaving open infections well. cuzin Pakistan got test back half hour ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Accurate AF bizarre title chose headline ""Philadelphia Pediatrician."" technically incorrect, major undersell.

Oh, invented vaccine rotavirus. doesn‚Äôt run President? Took 2 weeks get results. Labs backed lost bunch phone numbers well.

Depends live  discussing herd immunity proof response also herd immunity, guilty now. not. matters actions. 


Sweden's approach much limiting spread, countries. think he‚Äôs dodged taxes? fantastic job. Far better governor union - listened experts acted advice. result Colorado got control outbreak early maintained stable low level cases since. facts. might like facts contradict you, problem. mine. 

Why would bring red/blue this? Nobody mentioned politics time conversation. Maybe want check sub rules politics. ‚Äúover sooner‚Äù ‚Äúless deaths‚Äù thing? It‚Äôs fact would sooner mitigation measures. doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs desirable outcome. mitigation measures literally dragging curve time wise waiting vaccine. Y'all getting results 24 hours got mine back 4 days something foreign media snatched ran march people asked Swedish health agency herd immunity strategy option. 

China: new here?  Getting vaccine keeping safe. Maybe wearing mask couple months really big crowd keeping safe. Full social distancing 2 years insane. Tangent: herd mentality: using Worldometers data, 7 million reported cases, 204K deaths COVID-19. hit 70% exposure, that'd mean nearly 224 million additional cases. death rate 1/4 far (deaths per repoted cases), that'd mean additional 1.6 million deaths.

Herd immunity cheap, Sweden discovered. Australian population density actually quite high. Big areas empty space relevant transmission, rather **urbanized population density**. simple terms, size cities proportion people live versus rural areas.

Australian population urbanized US population - [86.2% vs yes, Mongolia certainly. government makes TV shows, happens. Exactly! This. Nobody talks validity statement. People quick call asshole even think masking symptoms heading work order avoid paying rent. 

I swabbed months back got really sick told expect results 9 business days. also told really important isolate home time. point blank told ‚Äúyou know nobody *afford* stay home two weeks awaiting possible positive result, right?‚Äù 

It negative, later tested neg antibodies. Expecting people go *half month* pay bullshit. onus public stay home ages. turn around time tests much, much faster. Hard convince people pandemic taken seriously wait long results. definitely huge part problem!!   Pretty easy solution here. eat. takes longer anything. I‚Äôm saying means it‚Äôs do. We‚Äôre dragging hoping fewer deaths get vaccine soon. we‚Äôre making ‚Äúover sooner‚Äù restrictions. make sense? let rip population, pandemic would sooner. That. Doesn‚Äôt. Mean. It‚Äôs. What. We. Should. Do. long fits narrative, facts don‚Äôt matter I've said Bill Gates, despite placid demeanor, widely known ruthless, competitive highly aggressive motherfucker would rip people shreds fucked up. never theatrical firing people way Jobs' was, less scary work for. also technical could see hedging bullshit faster most.

It‚Äôs real shame anyone countries think Sweden‚Äôs strategy one emulate sadly mistaken. remindme! 6 months bullshit. thats exactly means. ""Spread less"" mean ""no spead"". I'd say unrealistic expectation behalf BG. happening elsewhere either, takes days logistics hassle takes job.

If so, 14 days ... Must hard.  Thought American need anything continue partying on? go round coughing people wear masks etc.  - herd immunity achievable via natural infections. 

what hell about? Lol get job 2011 bachelor's science. cause thats official test Hey loved 90's! think elimination would worked America NZ, let's pretend containment much better. also like US bad outbreak border situation, certainly closed land borders visa office (ergo barring air travel US except residents select countries) start outbreak. 

Many countries contained outbreak well enough lockdowns, even eliminated, also returned relative normalcy. See Finland, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea Malaysia examples. Right. New York nightmare. getting this. That‚Äôs island happened horrible. That‚Äôs model do.

I would fucking fine Covid knew long term impact body, sadly that's given. all.

Sadly cavalier ""it's flu"" bullshit kept persisting ages. everyone pretended sickness 28 Days Later (but less shooting relatives friends) we'd probably much better place right now. constantly acting everyone around biological threat, world resume normal. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sister Costco greeter. Aka mask enforcement. turned away couple masks said ""we need groceries though, doctor told us stay home two weeks enough food long.""

I think sister would justified lighting fire. I'm planning flying time soon I've got hell decent FFP3 mask hardware store, pair safety goggles foam seal strap round head. healthy store plastic gloves.

If fly, I'm flying like that. I'll look like total dick actually care anyone thinks. like anyone recognise me. US. 24 hour response testing, every case close contacts contacts contacts identified contacted within 48 hours. every positive case genome sequenced see linked another case there's someone covid know about.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem countries like US let virus run rampant, sort ability control virus react happens top capacity deal it. could spent time investing infrastructure get top virus guess I'm sorry you. Spotted CCP bot parents too.

The parents teaching isolated. 

You need relationships peers ever want understand concept ""normal"". questioning eternal might Greenland? Why, happens October 1st?

I might bit slow! makes really sad. I'm ""risk group"" (other mental health difficulties concern getting 'long tail' symptoms) love travel, friends pilots.

I'd love flying right can't risk it. sucks. They‚Äôre compensating ones picked past she‚Äôs pretty smiling will, isolated area. take look australia new zealand. Politics trump statistics right reasons... believe ever got 0 infections ... probably 0 confirmed infections point. Yeah.

Some places Europe (I'd say, half continent), UK, Russia, Japan tough spot. Japan especially attitude corona since ""beat it"" magical Japanese people. posted 1 hour OP. 

Kinda contradictory info ... book different. naturally occurring bacterial disease protagonist comments got immunity likely military service South America bit bat. bat likely weakened form bacteria, leading immunity. Unfortunately humanity, killed said bat. Worst worlds. Little containment, massive economic hit. recall moment collective declaration ""pandemic over""?

I can. Presidental elections. 

I remember officials told citizens. Come on, vote, especially elder people (main group voters current President) - safer shopping!

Now look historical chart proven cases. Miraculously - two weeks second round elections, covid-19 cases started soar.

When government tells TV safe since now, cannot deny it, you? /s $XSPA ‚ÄòImportant ‚Äò people get 24 less.
Those business , politicians , actors , athletes, anyone visiting Whitehouse etc etc.

Know role plebs. work healthcare needed rapid results. found one CVS clinic area drive through, results 30 mins. book appointment first. hard find. CVSs take 2 3 days.  source report test results HHS? 


What find Data: Hospitals Perform COVID-19 Tests Using In-House Laboratory  required report state local public health authorities accordance  applicable state local law. Additionally, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, Economic  (CARES) Act (CARES Act Section 18115) implementation guidance require every  report every test performs detect SARS-CoV-2 diagnose possible case  COVID-19 (e.g., viral, serology). June 4, 2020, additional HHS guidance issued  specific data elements collected reported. new guidance, testing  sent state health departments, deidentify data report  CDC. new guidance effective August 1, 2020. 

""Laboratories required report state local public health authorities accordance"" 


Also see page 3 10 see report HHS. tests testing concerned, hospitals perform ""in-house"" laboratory testing use certain commercial labs asked report using HHS Protect System; provide data directly state,  probably already put ass like this.  Yes NSW isn't. wut? R\_effective irrelevant number, measured R value. throwing assumptions cross reactivity coronaviruses (on novel virus less) without data indicate that's case.

Re lower social distancing lockdowns. makes assume R0 sars-cov-2 lower R0 coronaviruses anyhow?

It's likely aware R0 common cold 5 (Re lower due endemic built antibodies within population - note novel virus definition endemic). maybe something mr bajillionare Get ass Reddit stop learning conspiracy theories. widely know. long time authorities maintained catch virus literally make sick person hours, lick snot smear sneezes face. became clear transmit droplets, told fall ground within seconds nothing worry about. Also, wearing mask dangerous wearing mask. Why? Because! 

At time anyone half brain could figure virus spreads way easily authorities telling us, large swath population already brainwashed thinking big deal. 

It's always science, much respect it. always ""Oh, evidence chemical X dangerous human health."" FFW 20 years later people exposed Chemical X cancer - ""Oops, seems Chemical X might possibly cause cancer know sure yet."" another years another thousand dead, ""Okay, many people died finally conclude Chemical X lethal"". Duh  Lol I'm pretty fucking glad moved china able go clubs 5 months I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre getting things. You‚Äôre proof people general starting become unwilling continue comply coronavirus restrictions ‚Äúpausing life‚Äù speak probably helpful information lot people. lucky job right everyone is. people may need job right now. Also, reading need job, many county city governments hiring people ""contact tracing"" jobs. Google ""contact trace job"" along name city state. think start showing faces people died day every local news cast. also think cables news station special run nothing photos every single person died country. long would take? Days? Weeks? Months? Maybe would finally hit home people. People need feel magnitude loss 200k lives right desensitized death toll. cable news also needs stop talking Trump 24/7 start telling stories people died let families speak. every day. UK: guys getting tests? Something important consider *a lot* rare diseases. fact one participant rare disease large group almost unavoidable, even specific disease extremely rare.

When disease appear twice, question becomes:

 * sheer bad luck?
 * select participants subgroup prone disease?
 * vaccine candidate causing disease? (or triggering disease someone already something making likely get disease).

When disease appears three times, possibility bad luck becomes extremely small, questions get lot scrutiny. Canberra‚Äôs COVID free quite time test four days ago. Got results back 10 min. $165 cash. insurance. Work paid it. NYC. Test came back neg. puts future UK tests per capita US according worldometers. US 296,185 tests per million population UK 314,398 test per million population. Businesses working around travel restrictions - zoom etc seems job pretty well. Tourists? (of either variety - coming going) - miss them. catching hate agree. vaccine stayin well away strangers (if mask) pretty much indefinitely. hate away spit fans. INDEED beg differ. 6 year old goes school. Last month wedding reception. 90 year old grandmother attended still alive well. go large church Sundays. get together family weekly basis. state fair happening 2 weeks well fall festival.

Also, baby shower last week. 35 weeks pregnant still scared virus 99% survival rate many family members coworkers described sinus infection. coworker within 5 hours Switzerland.

""Could take 48 hours"" ass lol. LA drive testing center get free COVID test results back within 24 hours. 2nd biggest city country scale testing like this, can't understand areas can't. Isn‚Äôt time related possible spine issues? People play sports make sports analogies. Winter coming... DoNt wEaR mAsK cUs cAnT bReAtHe um anyway guidelines stupid, contradict (""eat help"" vs ""no six people allowed unless aristocratic sport"") change every week often, grounded anything protecting image government, failed make impact since Britain second worst death Europe, majority people, visible, try best abide. want Yussss!!!! waited week test, negative thankfully American, see choice language spirited wildlife there... I‚Äôm surprised many people blindly support lockdown without demanding governments professionals provide information people communities impacted short term long term approach.

Not mention modelling used justify lockdowns fundamentally flawed. ban shops outside Walmart Amazon well! logic works it‚Äôs 100% effective.

If it‚Äôs 70% effective you‚Äôll need wear mask certain public situations. cost? Unfortunately, likely won't, we'll prepared it. mean, we'd hit year sexually-transmitted retrovirus, we'd really top ghing ... mean unemployment benefits increased, compensation job loss think get paid outright following restrictions.  ??? Black Death, torturing children? I'm pro vax, I'd strongly prefer take old-fashioned inactivated live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. people would readily accept vaccine made way annual flu shot nasal spray made. new tech vaccines would harder sell. unanticipated side-effects, many people become anti-vaxxers. Colleague South Africa felt bad. Went get test. hours results came back positive. 

Why America failing many months?  Scary considering gap wealth. Death serious life altering outcome getting covid. get covid die matter I'm dead. get covid survive I'm left wrecked lungs worse, that's worse death IMO.

All everyone wear mask keep distance. simplest task yet people can't bothered. stupidest? judicial bodies impervious political ideological bias. impeccably fair incorruptible judicial process Western countries famous served Julian Assange?  hard outbreak nightclubs shut 9pm. Isn‚Äôt amazing one man (Murdoch) world. read it. people getting upset fucking lunatics.  Bro, god emperor confess, tape, downplayed virus idiots? 

LOSERS SUCKERS üòÇ true.

WA, Tasmania, SA, NT, ACT cases within last months; QLD NSW minimal cases within last week.

It‚Äôs definitely possible suppress numbers minimal number proper contact tracing protocols. Victoria‚Äôs outbreak caused lockdown due mismanagement Hotel quarantines returned travellers coming seas, due largely use private contracted security trained infection control (no training PPE, sleeping infected guests taking shopping centres) took every precaution *for US rep travels states, meets hundreds people, keeps two offices*. holed home that's thought. Members Congress representative many us (besides political sense!)- travel planes, hold dozens meetings weekly even daily, show public events constantly. wore mask washed hands, enough. Yeah IMO ends Memorial Day 2021 matter what. Unless guarantee everyone gets access vaccine mid-summer, maybe large chunk people suck wait. turns ""whoopsie vaccine end 2021/early 2022 lol"", almost everyone (justifiably) start taking chances. You‚Äôve never heard learning experience you? Sweden situation think is.

Even NRO acknowledges Swedish response narrative quite nuanced buttress pro anti lockdown creepy, gonna ok? takes 2 seconds click someone's profile see subreddits active in. It‚Äôs definitely NSW. Testing quite low. UK, parents following experience: 

Day 1 - bit cough, apply test online.

Day 2 - Test kit arrived post. Took swap dropped post office day. 

Day 3 - Someone called 4pm tell negative. 

That seemed pretty spiffy me. remember shopping new stereo seeing 9/11 attacks TVs store once. one thing America known for,

is absolutely voting _against_ best interests, time time again. done again, ladies gentlemen. Previously, guidance masks worn physical distancing measures can‚Äôt followed. says masks alternative measures. Furthermore, highlights critical importance ventilation filtration indoors.

It also noted hasn‚Äôt even made change yet spite hundreds field experts calling change many months. Seems probably prognosis little time left. guess Philippines Indonesia like red headed step children area. always considered Australia NZ pretty unique places small populations relatively isolated least direct geographically, it‚Äôs way easier control something like there. like said, Vietnam think even said 0 deaths longest time. Weird totalitarian country easier control something like COVID. Kind scary price we‚Äôd pay adopt strategies. 1984 come lol. well yeah, breathing problem definitely lead thicker blood, make easier get oxygen blood stream. I'd say get results pnemonia. Large difference here, we're island nation, one agriculture long key industry along w/ unique ecosystem many desire protect. result this, considerable biosecurity legislation, even covid cause keeping passengers plane (for example) due suspicion bringing banana-mites (I assume that's thing) across state borders, quarantine officer would difficulty matter resolved, understanding.

As individual rights held health nation pandemic, provided decent room pandemic too. also legislation [was regional SARS concerns too, may hit Germany way.

... perhaps notably, Australians bill rights - rather they're assumed whatever explicitly taken away, along [five specific granted constitution (which otherwise deals state affairs), right vote, freedom religion.  Anecdotal examples fun toxic star like Great summary science. shame people Earth understand even believe it. 

I concerned long term immunity effective reinfections 5 years virus chance evolve form less human resistance. global cases Covid, likely becoming another annual ‚Äúflu‚Äù, nastier. shame United States part problem instead leading solution. makes masks completely useless. Let's end mandates know, right? So, political right? daily cases high begin with? share massive land border U.S province never got anywhere near 700 cases day. Ontario trippled daily infections last week August even around 300 so. Yup. We've found ""i"" ""TEAM"". He's hidden ""A""-hole. said weren‚Äôt working. starting learn covid everyone. fair Swedish ran numbers dead-counting... Yeah saw video now, he's actually pretty sensible ""and that's big If"".

Basically seems like trying explain exponential growth someone understand (how hard it, really?) making example. Andrew ‚Äúrename bridge myself‚Äù cuomo even popular played pandemic news? We‚Äôve wearing masks 6 months?? *Aggressive suppression ;) focus long time ago See, totally agree: failure process. I'm risk analyst: know processes fail due type failure (""human error"" ""human failure"" people-process-technology trilogy).


You're OP ""massive loophole/risk"". massive. Massive politicians refuse hear scientists, police refuse apply rules bc ignorance (""muh liberty""), people shoot people asked protect others.


NZ actually massive: massive success failure processes people. basicly government covering arses, 2 weeks back lockdown, Bojo say ""well warn 2 weeks ago"" nation trust you... Vaccine - agreed, especially crop vaccines, contribute towards herd immunity protects vaccinated. rest build resistance hard way.

Facemasks - protect people, yourself. refusal wear masks making people sick, purpose. Fuck you. agree. is. change fact that's needs happen, didn't. managed coordinated poorly. Hell, I'm still waiting weeks weeks unemployment back pay. Oh look WORKS I‚Äôve results 15 minutes?
Twice current pandemic pure hysteria (in UK), drummed mainstream media empirical data shows near situation April. Deaths plateaued important stat. No, first patient also transverse myelitis, AZ pretended due undiagnosed MS continued phase 3 trials. behind focus spread coronavirus, Texas leaders say hospitalizations guide decisions regulate social distancing businesses cultural centers.

I wonder medical professionals dealing outbreak Texas say this. hospital beds shouldn‚Äôt limiting factor. apologies good people Canberra! guys worked hard too! People downvoting willing little inconvenienced keep myself, family, contacts healthier productive. selfish bastards.  Kinder hard listen government saying constantly break rules themselves, long testing eye sight thats fine aye lot metaphor this. guess people willing sacrifice anything able party pandemic. Everyone died Alamo. lot defenders weren‚Äôt Texans. haven‚Äôt read article, got rapid results test $20 knew within 15 minutes not. assume mean children account 78% coronavirus deaths *among children*, ‚Äúthese groups‚Äù mean Hispanic, Black, Native Americans *of ages*? Two cases extremely rare, crippling illness enough reason terminate trial right now, dumpster vaccine wait next candidate. Victoria there‚Äôs mass hatred anger quarantine leaks caused second wave doesn‚Äôt seem outrage NZ (and NSW) Yeah constitution gives governors president near absolute power comes public health measures. fact SCOTUS ruled proves give fuck constitution. Yeah, terrorist attack new york 2001. ring bell? they're shit biased. dead caught second third hand.

none attended either wedding reception. first lockdown relative success, however government fucked much hotel quarantine led second wave second lockdown. Nothing first. missed point ""careful reopening"". lockdown, follow protocol mask wearing social distancing, knock cases less irrelevant move lives, caution, vaccine widely available. seems simple concept people grasp, apparently infringes rights live... ironic.  think unreliable quite accurate either. Less sensitive, yes, necessarily less accurate. 

In fact, one thing really hurting path beating virus, misnomer. FDA approving less sensitive tests, viewed lens diagnostic. clinical lab setting, using antigen tests. tests less sensitive, actually bonus surveying population for, ""infectiousness"". 

See brief explanation Harvard epidemiologist Michael Mina. really worth watch try get word spread.  White ants termites.

They destroy within. first lockdown loose poorly managed. equivalent American lockdown. second lockdown like New Zealand. live shithole country Yes Yah... still big deal. Brazil 4.5 million cases. looking 0.002% chance reinfection. Everyone knew reinfection possible going happen. 

Nonfactor. Cheers mate!! We‚Äôre almost there.
But said result local state governments, case Victorian government, necessary. federal government, opinion, woefully start vocal opposition Victoria done get point. think people best apathetic sizeable percentage completely unwilling follow guidelines.

Despite successfully working home since march office workers told go back save companies like pret costa socialise friends (unless spoons)

Lets face we'll told visit people Christmas tory MP gets caught they'll retroactively change advice could visited family ""so stupid"" follow advice (as Cummings got caught) 

People given caring. advice never consistent, goalposts we're aiming get lockdown change. one knows who's ultimately enforcing inconsistent police forces. Possibly dumb question exposed I‚Äôm frankly frustrated it. Long story short One brothers friends lied negative we‚Äôre exposed. He‚Äôs positive sniffles. 

They told rest us test would take week returned we‚Äôre asymptomatic. Would make sense rush ones asymptomatic opposed ones symptoms? symptoms, lot easier stay home. don‚Äôt, there‚Äôs temptation go feel fine Back people used actually buy newspapers called Herald Sun (Melbourne's main Murdoch paper) 'bog roll' useful toilet paper. also can't afford *not* proper lockdown. laissez faire approach we're soon, all.

However, full confidence asking everybody right thing government restricting little possible problem sorted time. What‚Äôs point?

The majority Australians go daily lives restrictions concerns catch COVID. 

The rest Australia get soon. 

Restaurants, bars, cafes, live music, theatre, domestic travel tourism - function. 

Australia‚Äôs economy actually done quite well Pandemic, certainly hasn‚Äôt contracted much US, UK much Europe. 

No international tourism tough, tourism operators expecting booming summer Australians choosing travel within country!

As elimination ‚Äòlazy‚Äô - mate, tell 6 million Victorians spent last months strict lockdown. 

Australia (Victoria especially) worked bloody hard reduce virus much. 

With arrivals island nation requiring 14 days (enforced) quarantine, robust contact tracing system (and bit luck) remain COVID free across country. correct say. decide trust government numbers brink election months ... scrupulous mostly unethical running political throne general chances NZ might same. 0% covid infections, good ... guess unlocking restrictions get covid map ... makes sense cases spiked Europe Us.

ps - know people get worked one random user said trust oficial numbers released government ... science behind another story likely sincere.

Question - Last Peer Reviewed Scientific Paper personally read? pandemic pandemic? Well. 11get better new infections eliminated virus parties I‚Äôd take bugs 200,000 deaths plague thanks story vague. many questions. many people wedding? many people wedding infected? one person brought virus nursing home? Jail? could anyone vaccine?

I'm vaccines all, say this... I'm... hesitant take vaccine fast tracked, especially administration (America). I'm saying take it.... definitely first line. 

Its one thing take vaccine something developed normally. quite another take one ""Operation Warp Speed"".... even name fucking stupid.

I'm kinda hoping vaccine another country wins. I'd actually comfortable that. stop spreading lies misinformation. virus doesn‚Äôt live forever. spread among community doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs alive infectious among whole community. People lockdown stop infectious. fizzes out. possible Australia keep borders closed vaccine released, hopefully keep tourism industry alive government spending. stupidest comment ever read. Courts overrule things law. dont know country come from, judging comment country either huge amount corruption functioning judicral system. Germany, court cases decided based law.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yes Disagree, leaders need learn lead. desire party/whatever big problem America, exists elsewhere too. Obviously lack safety net plays too. People buckled Europe while, started fun too, they're starting see wave 2.

We told people can't do, do. need teach people operate within new circumstances, blame them.

People much better job EU countries (like Czech) political leaders wore masks, refused to. coincidence people took seriously.

We point finger terrible American society, never lockdown. states one, mostly soft suggestion stay inside US. countries, like Italy China, way serious measures. leadership, I'm sure they'd big disaster are.

But whether want blame society administration really matter. Unless plan hope people start caring problem simply disappear, need top-down leadership. Mine took 17 days NYC July.  owns half percent entire USA GPD he‚Äôs fucking lecturing everyone.

Maybe didn‚Äôt solely control massive amount US capital, we‚Äôd better place.

Fuck off, Gates. can, pay $150  everything else life. Woaaahh... expect someone already visiting country. Cheerss!! 

Well explained sir. Thanks details. Damn, always wonder hard live US. again, thanks.

yeah, live jakarta living yogya like get 50-75% cheaper jakarta. strip clubs? Psst, hospitalizations come weeks positive cases. throw canary garbage. bad person. live bad society. Spoken like someone could always pay hospital bills. What's 'outrageous' American medical establishment privatised. pillow! metrics?

Edit: also middle road acceptable place be? adjusting population US cases, new cases, deaths, etc countries seen metrics, US middle pack terms virus response. Where's Jared Kushner need him? /s   Idk man. pretty much go work. coworkers can't assed even fucking wear mask around I'm sure hell gonma stay home become homeless waiting test results. 

Especially company's policy come work awaiting test results. Except commingle passengers terminal board especially boarding.

It's different schools cohorting classes, allowing students mingle hallways together mixing buses.

Defeats whatever safety might existed system. Eh? China's Sinovac's jabbed hundreds thousands people. long wait ""not bad news"" vaccines USA?  US conducted 100,000,000 tests six months. Testing one COVID metrics absolute number important, relative population size. Outside China, almost certainly bullshitting numbers, America conducted tests, absolutely. far testing per capita, 19th, one country (UK) 10,000,000 residents. testing per capita numbers Falklands Gibraltar hardly relevant discussion.

No country earth could running million tests per day right now. There's testing capacity issue America. There's testing demand issue America, AKA there's many dumbasses follow rules. let wear uncovered. I'm near certain, matter obvious make ""covered it"" - airline person still hand mask say - use this.

They going take word it...when company policy back up. quicker easier assume exhale valve properly covered.  ""All people happened suddenly get MS volunteered vaccine. coincidence!"" -- Oxford possible coming years, entire populous infected, lifespans lowered long term health effects. Scary think might cause life expectancy drop 15-20 yrs everyone world. would like become habit people wear masks symptomatic cold fly symptoms respect others, many Asian cultures do.

**AMEN THAT!** would very, nice people US picked tradition/habit/style wearing face mask person feels ill. would prevent many people coughing sneezing everything spreading illness everyone else. positivity rate reported state different positivity rate reported John Hopkins. Like looked positivity rate John Hopkins Saturday would find it‚Äôs ~8%. Kentucky supposedly cleans data removes people double positivity tests feels kind artificial me. Anyways positivity rate hasn‚Äôt changed significantly past two months whether use John Hopkins numbers ‚Äúofficial numbers‚Äù Europe got complacent. lockdowns actually quashed virus part, summer life back normal. Virus began slowly heat summer, one wearing masks social distancing. think wave bad first could easily much worse US' summer wave. places around US lately clear places people taking virus seriously anywhere Europe.

Europe looks US thinks, disaster, terrible management. Well, wait. Vienna, Austria daily new cases per 100,000 last two weeks (on par worst hotspots US right now) new restrictions they've announced are: bars close 12, maybe wear masks inside retail establishments. masks schools, restaurants, bars - office closures - school closures - limits gatherings - nothing would actually help. Good luck them. *you died dysentery* Speculation. Current phase 3 candidates look promising could enough data emergency use approval October November earliest. means itd approved highest risk people. limited quantities vaccine, average person might even see vaccine well next year case like that.

to physicians think emblematic perverted view ""freedom"" many Americans have.

This society issue administration issue. Well, Abbott ID test takes 15 minutes PCR test. yes many rapid tests antigen tests We're hitting new levels murica never thought possible deff let use (at least uncovered). 

Its worth wasting breath trying tell done. quicker hand mask. going put risk violating company policy. 

I've abandoned using true respirator. I've moved using KF94's calling good enough. add additional metal nose strip use ear savers get effective seal. 

Honestly - tried plug exhale valves masks, found KF94 better experience - filter medium resistance lower (specifically exhale), modified 6800. plug exhale valve, make tiny surface area filter material exhale go through. 

If going re-modify 6800, guess I'd seal exhale completely, remove inhale gasket - p100 cartridge becomes bi-directional.

Down vote want(although -7 much...), numbers possible. would rather wait whole thing shut open every months. That‚Äôs worse, it‚Äôs like tease. 

Unsurprisingly, happens days New Zealand reported 12% 3rd quarter GDP drop election year No. cause takes year vaccinate everyone know got reply, something said triggered automod, probably naming glorious leader üòÖ.   

It's nice actually discussion, without malice.  
I hate trying political discussion normally, always damn toxic.  
I'll try editing recommenting dinner.  Mainly sabotaged partisan interests.  mean post office, example, used great. fine.  got meddled politics ruined bit.  Paris ridiculously slow that's virus booming most.

Americans seem simultaneously think they're worst best country planet, middle-ground? sure downvoted. 50% Indians 28 yrs old Tourism killed everywhere bud. screwed regardless anyone did. Yeah nose swab fun. also passed drew blood I‚Äôm wimp. 

When got first dose thought got placebo didn‚Äôt feel anything... night started feeling kind sick. slightly warm mild chills. woke 4am feeling nauseous like going throw up. 12 hours rest felt fine.

I worried 2nd dose told people feel negative side effects first shot sometimes even worse side effects second. got second dose took ibuprofen got home went sleep. woke felt like million bucks, side effects.

Still idea got real thing placebo. I‚Äôm thinking side effects might real thing, also could‚Äôve psychosomatic reaction head. knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Cries Arizona* southern economies net recipients EU stimulus package. aren‚Äôt contributing shit. Nothing special really. 

Before put mask first time...I apply one adhesive metal nose strips directly over/on top existing metal strip mask. Stacked right top. 

When go shape/form mask around nose, WAAAYYY effective retaining shape - thus - providing great seal reducing leakage dramatically.

Ear savers - addition to, well, saving ears - also pulls mask tighter face. again, goal reduce leakage. 

Also...since I'm sissy, typically rip ear loops used masks. tie one old loops top current masks ear loops. me, save ears, also creates head cradle. ear saver goes around back head, old loop top. mask MUCH stable face.  live Portland. fiancee walk evening. passed 12 people. 1 wearing mask. Gates Says US Needs ‚ÄòOwn Fact Didn‚Äôt Good Job‚Äô Handling Coronavirus Pandemic

And over, actively shit job handling pandemic. Actually, interesting way measure real level social distancing country. look 2020 flu season compare flu seasons previous years. gauge compliance way. 

If mask distancing rules implemented there's still semi-normal flu season, know citizens countries should.

We could also compare flu covid spread; one country much smaller flu season usual bad covid numbers, something else might afoot, like virulent strain, widespread comorbidity genetic predisposition. absolutely spot 300k confirmed cases, death rate

The older population higher risk death.

Life expectancy much higher Italy countries states mostly due healthy food affordable healthcare.

Italy literally one oldest populations world, oldest people much risk death rate Italy high. could thought,uh? No, happens scary diseases /s.  Holy shit he‚Äôs actually skeptic lmaooooo See comment above?

Also, [this may interest conversing type person. gonna lie, hobby athlete myocarditis probably biggest nightmare, usually relatively healthy. Break bone tear ligament sucks, shit..  Influenza mutates rapidly, particularly parts immune system picks on. Coronaviruses, especially severe 3 (SARS, MERS, SARS 2) not. personally little skeptical vivid vaccine little faith US Government adequate testing releasing . vaccines take 3-5 years test develop . saying polio small pox vaccine that‚Äôs use decades  Gates using personal gain. Trump slew monster named Net Neutrality, Gates got butthurt since M$ one companies pushing NN financial gain.

All free drive-through testing problem. overloaded labs.

The echo chamber thinks Trump used DPA military production, COVID, lie. Trump used DPA force GM keep promise produce ventilators. Ford volunteered.

The echo chamber also thinks load balance labs, cannot. It'll take time money move samples massive infrastructure see labs capacity. assuming anyone willing ship COVID samples.

The echo chamber realize federal government cannot legally order lockdown, enumerated power. argument heard, sadly number friends square time, believe them. 

Also read link posted state massacre. simply questions much occurred outside square vs. inside. Australia, we're way achieving elimination (as community transmission) within next months (possibly Christmas). Right now, whole country averaging 39 new cases per day (most Melbourne, still lockdown while).

We days community transmission back around June. Melbourne (in state Victoria) second wave (partly failed contract trace properly partly people following rules properly). virus spread state borders right now, really two states (NSW Victoria) community transmission (Queensland almost eliminated second time).

NSW using strategy suppression contract tracing case numbers low. Victoria aiming elimination. averaging 400 cases day (some days 700) early August whole state locked 6 weeks. Melbourne that's still locked down.

I can't wait start get days community transmission virus spreadable feces one shit bathroom, flush spread air, tiny space absolutely thick virus. That's problem bathrooms specifically. dangerous. fuck would wear mask forever? irrelevant know I‚Äôm healthy. I‚Äôm incapable getting sick even wanted - I‚Äôm carrying virus.

Getting people sick, preventable, wrong. Making people uncomfortable big deal. waited 9 days Alberta, Canada. Yet Provincial government adamant they're amazing COVID-19. Toronto - thing. Didn‚Äôt even need appointment first one. walked left. 

Same deal extended family. results posted next day first test. 2 days families average though. U tell kiss ass friend 
Donald Trump. Dont tell us he's control president Sweden Netherlands doesnt count report deaths way, need look excess deaths. Netherlands lot deaths report. Sweden LESS excess deaths reported Coronadeaths. 

Excess deaths per capita (per 100 000)
Sweden	- 52 Netherlands China could take seriously restrict freedoms way do. Look every major western country. Unfortunately, antibody-based treatments don‚Äôt seem particularly effective. vaccine seems like strongest bet currently. Disaster Capitalism axe? report deaths recent outbreak? Either way country great job example world. countries New Zealand would corona virus right now. Early strong response leads elimination return back old normal. example followed future pandemics. Eradication real possibility. eliminated virus again. Thats good point incorrect assertion. CCP knows todays world cannot keep people traveling and/or accessing information way 50ies 90ies. Instead focuses ideological indoctrination means inoculate ideas. welcome dispute aware unknown concept widely studied written scholars, journalists CCP itself. 


Also, somewhat relevant, wondering realize Chinese travel abroad use international roaming great fire wall travels them. Shocking  countries actually taking seriously, there‚Äôs government-paid Covid leave form payment quarantining either virus, waiting results.

America‚Äôs government services social safety net woefully inadequate even *normal* times. pandemic truly exposes consequences that. several kinds vaccines, types getting cancer possible. long get? free express opinions. Lets wait see happens. Reality going matter, predictions. Except won‚Äôt let anybody in. killing tourism industry. saying wish US took seriously China did. took care suffering can‚Äôt actually deal anything. think China much better infectious disease control fuck China 13 days Missouri July family done shit Asia since covid began. stop. That‚Äôs true too, it‚Äôs still flattening curve means. Totally agree. Trudeau wants claim evidenced base decision making, better make sure people giving evidence qualified. sounds like small skilled multilingual group watching pandemics got pulled prime directive. happened time US pandemic watch became unraveled. I‚Äôve friend get results next day two others waited week theirs. think depends many people getting tested. time holiday weekend lot people getting tested labs get backlogged. ‚ÄúThe 40-year-old prime minister strong lead rivals polls due success containing COVID-19.‚Äù

Covid small part she‚Äôs popular. Even I, normally National (opposition party) supporter acknowledge done superb job leading NZ last 4 years (despite personally losing buttload money due policies). 

It also helps position opposition leader (Collins) snarky cow lol . 

I‚Äôm happy rest NZ now, us Aucklanders sit lockdown bit longer shitty traffic (our main bridge across city broke last Friday) Well you‚Äôre supposed isolate get result, no? become professional athlete billionaire. Problem solved. people get antibody test find responded vaccine 75%, act accordingly? Would 25% produce antibodies? guess applies already infected. trying sound like conspiracy freak. question is: purpose ? need rethink school kids eating lunch together. Whatever room unmask could infected hours, right? Lucky. desperately wanted trial don‚Äôt spleen. taken treat rare blood disease since birth. said spleen disqualification Y2K again? follow vaccine news want firm dates. possible specific yet. I'm going take issue assertion kids 12 rarely infect others. Rather, understanding rarely exhibit symptoms, spread efficiently age groups, perhaps efficiently. disagree please cite references. Except tourism industry suffering won‚Äôt let foreigners in.  track finally start flying regional summer. that's probably going happen *years*. disheartening close wait even longer. **Excellent! quotes come Chinese media!

*(Don't need China expert able listen Xi Jinping)* There's billionaires, there's Bill Gates. man given 32% net worth charity. donated billionaire twice. Bill Melinda Gates Foundation invested untold time, money, research into, among things, containing infectious disease. 
Don't get wrong: hate billionaires, think exist. there's billionaire like Bill Gates. Im happy trend percent filled ICU beds outer islands send critical care Honolulu dont ability put people ambulance another state. 

It also help state government completely incompetent. head department health out, state epidemiologist out, another person came contact tracing refused work weeks later department shambles.

None people government expected real work. 

Hawaii continually looses doctors. pretty terrible place work. 1000 doctors short state needs. 33 left island since January alone. 

Granted 20% unemployment bunch people falling insurance well.  guess happens resort corporations buy state product vacations. 

It interesting everything opens up. ‚Äúmay done‚Äù mean? One percent chance? Ten percent? 50 percent? 90 percent?

It‚Äôs statement sounds ominous doesn‚Äôt really tell us much Tell China Russia that. Same. said 3 cars line drive testing I've read it. Anything like frequently asked questions parts confusing? I'm wondering certain things gets first available want bother here. Damn. explains tech bubble buy groceries, go home, someone covid used elevator one hour earlier, breathe normally elevator, get covid. keep feeling like know vaccine behind promised schedule ineffective flawed way, desperately trying soften blow without coming saying causing complete anarchy? Regardless whether people agree point not, fact got downvoted pretty telling sub general Pretty sure known January. Didn‚Äôt? Aren‚Äôt. aren‚Äôt good job. good job handling pandemic. No. Bill solution anecdotal, mine. live coast morning 830, people wearing masks. say lack care claim exaggerated say I'm seeing opposite. I'm saying seeing mask compliance. redditor noted driving CA NV CO mask compliance (anecdotally) seemed greater NV CO compared CA dad flights cancelled rebooked onto flights couldn‚Äôt make Covid times. gave us terrible times getting money back refused offer anything voucher. 

We file complaints transport board chargebacks get money back. Sorry job, employing companies treating remaining customers like trash I‚Äôm hopeful good outcome. use money come better quicker testing?? He's got fucking money world it. well, relatively big wave ;) 

my point Busch-Diesel US didn‚Äôt go China‚Äôs draconian lengths contain virus. 

Most Asia didn‚Äôt even proper lock downs much people crammed smaller spaces ‚Äî almost due masks. Trump sign EO force sale USA branch American Company, probably owned pal Larry Ellison, citing national security concerns.  made MSPaint second wave broke hoping day. Wow, okay genius.

Maybe lunch New Zealand. that's small group protestors complained lockdows reasons people places like US.

The point stance utterly obnoxious.

But imply maybe slightly aggressive something earlier US could made difference, maybe whiners prevented something never ending madness now. post removed because:

So use 20-30 minute journey 2 hour journey... either sit wait turn bridge go LONG way around uncle also named Gene personally think pretty good, like movies like Dunkirk, 1917, Journey's End, kind that's adrenalin. 

It's depressing tragic that's war, time China weak people indifferent, movie presented historical event wake call still slumber, I'm rather fond development main characters.

Some criticize dramatic beening complete factual, feel retreat ending bit over-processed, wanted straight facts I'd watch documentary.

&amp;#x200B;

As public opinion, despite many fierce vocal critics still rated 9.2(1.28 million votes) app use. Last week September 18 Incident memorial day, company work organized office go see movie together, collegues liked too, though comment depressing watch twice. hundred thousand people died summer. clearly blow April warm weather. load hogwash. DFW area? never get sick life, immune system going fragile, weak disaster.

As counterintuitive is, getting sick healthy. Especially child  one paragraph article say talking specifically: percentage population covered vaccine coverage - good proxy measure health systems functioning - dropping levels last seen 1990s, meaning progress set back 25 years 25 weeks Pro-tip: fly hospital gown. tear end journey. Like wearing glove entire body. Florida, Texas, California, Arizona . . . 

Who knew cold there? guess right, age factor, sick people course also factor, combination pre-existing conditions. since age biggest factor survival chances, two people need respirator one 25 one 85, one put single respirator have?  3 deaths. 2 brothers 50s, one ex-Pm cook islands Dr caught patient, early 80s. feel like crazy person. 

Hasn‚Äôt common knowledge since beginning?

Everyone knows respiratory viruses transmitted way. That‚Äôs bs. There‚Äôs way 2 inmates got infected. broke? Earthquake? Bill gates shut something it. always mouth shut. Schools IMO biggest problem this. Like would tough obviously insane, could somehow picture mass gathering cultural events in-person college. schools year? think people realize innefective on-line schooling home compared in-person. Kids barely keep atttention they're school, let alone home tons distractions around. country, schools started september mom, teacher, already saying basically go spring material kids know it. Year in-person schooling would irreparable damage children even start social interactions necessary kids age.  Canadian here. Got results within 12 hours labour day long weekend COMING.... govt blocking FDA 3 new deaths. shocking, properly acknowledged leaders. Every death hits us hard. (We 25 :-( total) Another failure socialized healthcare. SMH guy Americas. √Ä Meudon, j'ai pris la test au laboratoire √† c√¥t√© du march√© maison rouge, si tu le connais. Mardi matin, j'ai pris le test, mecredi apr√®s-midi j'ai re√ßu le resultat. Eh bien j'habite en France, c'√©tait pas un probl√®me de rester chenous pendant deux jours avec une maladie. Obviously American might've much bigger problem stay home two days simple sinus infection.

Yes, otherwise. American, living thousand kilometers nearest foreign city, city Thunder Bay, Ontario, might well think ""Fuck it, I'll stay States then"". Legit question - list technological advances, new knowledge found since beginning covid? vaccine stupidity either. think Hawaii hurting bad right going take risk. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs right, sitting 20% unemployment. 

The people aren‚Äôt getting help federal government desperate situation without income. 

It‚Äôs incredibly sad can‚Äôt something federal level protect places rely almost entirely tourism keep population employed also isolated poor infrastructure outbreaks can‚Äôt adequately controlled. is. prove anything all. N95 masks 100% effective blocking transmission. fact far less reliable HEPA filters plane. make assumptions like woman caught COVID neighbor delivered groceries later came it. Obviously packaging infected her, right? Well turns used ATM 3 weeks symptoms showed scientists actually determined keypad route infection. know always obvious. Plenty saline comments section though hahaha contagion highlighted weakness grown prevalent Western government know nothing long term side effects healthy people exceptionally rare

Do even listen yourself? ""We dont know anything... they're extremely going assume apocalypse version 

And going shit 960,000 dead people lives never mattered. I‚Äôm going side reality

You mean reality big dick badass little virus gonna dare fuck selfishness kills bunch bunch people, ""Fuck em, weak deserved trying make sound crazy 

No, idiotic sociopathic ""I'm healthy young risk get risk might impose others fault me."" way you‚Äôre putting want kill old people unless hide home 24/7.

No, assert anything erroneously believe personal risk get it, ignore fact especially right, get vaccinated, comply safety protocols eventually get without feeling negative effects all, habits guarantee infect others, turn infect others, personally responsible untold illnesses, maimings folks shopping hours

Which big help infect kids hours later go home share mom gun ok dude

Try telling millions parent, spouse, child, friend loved one among 960,000 dead uncounted multitudes people whose loved ones sustained permanent damage minds bodies due infection. 

It difficult find some, virus cranking thousands new dead damaged every single day. seem quite eager help better. RIP Las Vegas  SARS hit Toronto relatively hard large contained didn‚Äôt really hit rest Canada badly.

Even pin drop compared covid 19 - 2 outbreaks lasting 2 months around 350 suspected cases 39 deaths total. Wrong, learnt acceptable British English. take eye protection and/or mask stay away air conditioning vents. filtered airports (or places) mean someone can't even see cough one vent come completely different place even different floor infect you. work, two symptoms fever alone, got administrative leave 10 days including weekend. tests coming back 14+ days. saying 10 days symptoms, come back work. Even test comes back. Fml. Idk Americans aren‚Äôt getting test results quickly get tested going back work got call back 15 minutes later results

Edit: live Texas slim chance 98% effective ‚Äúcould‚Äù one chances slim. I‚Äôve taken two tests. invalid. Taken third test couple days ago still waiting results. need get back work support family. think people anti-maskers would anti-maskers Trump President?

Not asked, yes, definitely. Perhaps fervor, ... it, I'd guess. Trump office, message would still there, Rush rest right-wing entertainment media. hard normalize numbers lack testing beginning backlog disinterest testing see. test Friday Alabama took 15 min walk-in clinic Republicans reading like, ""see beat I. big deal."" ride around Walmart scooter 300lbs mask type 2 diabetes mild case gout. writer, now, need give example nation poorly look subsaharan Africa put something like ""even ghettos America ... etc."" Yeah, Seattle took 16 hours. Got tested 3pm got results 6am send back 40 years instead live 1980s again? I'm you. like trying polite grieving family.

I'd like grieving family something constructive -- perhaps -- warn whoever listen quit knuckleheads little piece cloth couple months away friends INDOORS. JFC, weather's still nice, mostly, still go outside whatnot.  New York even close biggest city world. Norway here. County established drive-thru system could get tested seated car. test would completed within 1-2 days, said. public health concern, test came without charge all. would small either way tbh. 

I Saturday 24 hours - dot - personal (public) physician called tell test negative. told get contacted positive, check case, nice him.

So, yeah. agree Bill Gates here. outrageous possible general public stage.

Edit: think used test local university invented. suppose accurate cheap produce, there's that. cost what's causing lack efficiency. I'll admit I'm expert means, understanding, rapid tests much higher false-negative rate lab tests. Depending brand test, reliability vary significantly well.

For example, couple months ago, Abbott Laboratories came rapid COVID test. [A study found using nasopharyngeal swabs, third set positive samples (confirmed different test) tested actually ended generating lot news coverage. can't speak test might perform (or rapid testing may improved general), believe speaks results may vary rapid testing.

Also kids terrified setup that's big plus too. unsubstantiated pro-sweden posts posted daily sub.

please link one :)

only one post Sweden daily, literally transcribing
the press conferencees. long fint *unsubstantiated*..? countries get results earlier 24 hours (and also short wait time get tested)?

Also live US. scheduled appointment online, waited twenty minutes line cars, took test, got results next day. I've done twice already family members experiencing thing.  That's wear goggles one whole discussion hard believe? US has. Trump never. Yes death rate 10 times lower. That‚Äôs say Sweden messed up. don‚Äôt get ? gonna like century floods happen every 5 years now. Saying I‚Äôm worried one doesn‚Äôt exclude other. However survival us get sick depends efforts medical professionals. Wait, like halt done they're continuing trial? Source? say anywhere article antibody, titers, controls, etc?

This article metrics clinical substance (junk science). earliest case I'd heard late October/early November. Texas Med Clinic. 15 minutes every time. I've tested 3 times now. course many died. pandemic, scenario *enough* people die?

yes old people too. share deaths within same. fortunately spread let's hope keep way.

stop posting amp links. Bill, would done differently, late start now? 12% dip Q2 included nationwide lockdown. Q3 results arent yet expected much better rest country Level 1 2 whole time. Auckland strict lockdown 17 days. Yes, people take care comes pool people. get paid public side.

If want public side take whole bag, also take elderly private sector cares now. air leaves cabin, half dumped outside,

So saying planes spraying COVID onto us above? covtrails Registered Nurse arguing vehemently there's need doctors wear masks people need eat sugar, May.

&amp;#x200B;

I get want pep talk encouragement, many workers listed might purposely trained wrong, perhaps joke.  second case condition. It‚Äôs huge face Gates already, adding injury insult here. beyond ability political will. Regardless party it‚Äôs pitiful. agree US shitty politicians office right now. However:

I hate play devil's advocate here, first part statement really basis. know ""they good job""? measure that? GDP per capita? seems like 'feel good' statement really factual basis.
From perspective, huge percentage population essential jobs, people US shitty job listening experts scientists. rocket scientist know politicians idiots taking advice virology. I'm willing hear give solid reasoning believe scientists developing vaccines reporting weekly doesn't. vaccine tested thousands people one gets sick, could caused anything. That's exactly point large scale trials - find trends. paused trial investigate caused vaccine, decided safe continue trial, meaning indication vaccine caused one case illness. Clinical trials held extremely high ethical standards chance exposing participants danger, must stop trial immediately. even know person got sick receiving vaccine placebo. Jumping conclusions really helpful. yes, possibly. Depression forcibly kind problem. Major depression must treated serious potentially life-threatening illness. Depression adverse effect body mind. drains body energy, cause hopelessness, hamper drive increase worse feeling.

To get rid depression one take take matters seriously.

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Residents long-term care facilities (LTCFs) risk severe COVID-19. Facility-wide testing, even absence reported COVID-19 case, identify asymptomatic presymptomatic infection LTCFs.

**What added report?**

LTCFs testing conducted confirmed case COVID-19 found significantly higher proportions infected residents staff members initial testing 4 weeks follow-up compared testing preventive measure. majority LTCFs testing preventive measure identified infection, although initial prevalence significantly lower fewer cases occurred follow-up.

**What implications public health practice?**

Proactive testing LTCF residents staff members might prevent large COVID-19 outbreaks LTCFs early identification timely infection prevention control response.  2nd richest man earth deep connections every level US government going back 2 decades. Hell, 90's got law approved Congress simply could Porsche 959 legally drive around Washington.

 


Go fucking something it, Bill. Clearly yelling TV keeping image relevant.

 


Instead funneling cash foundation continue accruing massive tax benefits, directly help people smallest town next you? Make sure every kid town access education, healthcare real future. Pay parents complete online classwork better parents give incentives people follow guidelines.

 


Hell, pick smallest county Washington give benefits people live day announce this.

 


It'd almost minuscule amount money, could offload 90% duties employee good world getting TV pointing again, we're angry about. That'd be..2,256 people Garfield county 2013, people whose futures almost certainly permanently improve.

 


Did know gave every resident Kelso 100k year, itd cost less 12 million dollars?

 


Your yearly income speculated around 4 billion. 0.3% estimated make year. could literally pay debt entire town, take care housing needs likely short term medical needs. could even make come requirements financial classes, basic metrics help ensure lasting change, etc. access best minds planet, come better long term solutions can, I'm sure it

 


So keep yammering media? I'm done listening. want attention, go something. Otherwise, freakishly rich old man, trying make public image wholesome good possible, hoping one looks closely past present tax breaks professional choices. one dumbest takes I've ever read concerning Bill Gates. Well done. actual fuck trying say. like welding apartment shut me.  believe heard person repeatedly violated quarantine. found reference answers question -- Three scenarios occur person vaccinated two versions vaccines disease, particularly close * get stronger immune response. example children got inactivated polio vaccine later got oral polio vaccine.  * second vaccine causes immunity would similar receiving second dose original vaccine. Using different brand hepatitis B vaccine one doses would example this.  * immune response generated first vaccine interferes components response second vaccine, cases causing lower immunity. example, people got pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) followed pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine harmless helper protein attached it, called pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), lower antibody responses one part PCV vaccine people got two vaccines opposite order (PCV followed reasons, studies need done determine effects getting second type COVID-19 vaccine shortly receiving different one. If, however, find COVID-19 vaccines like influenza vaccines need get vaccinated annually, concerns switching types one year next less likely issue. test done last week. Results less hour. Im sure he's talking about.  basically already movie/book. Legend w/ Smith Incorrect per section states 'Dispersal patients age gender'. confirmed cases 40, age groups rarely become severe cases.



Doesn't matter hit level severe, they're still taking majority hospitalizations.


'Seriously ill respiratory' graph currently showing increase people severe category. He's private citizen done private citizen. can't hold responsible failures first world governments.

And absolutely White House Task Force. Trump promised administration would bring private sector management public sector. Instead got Kushner every team needs guy won‚Äôt sacrifice anything team.

Are really? would know this?

Pretty sure standard protocol FDA wants see &amp; save evidence relevant happenings. Yeah, controller side we‚Äôre hearing traffic going fall hard Oct 1st. Thanks perspective. Unfortunately taking American Airlines believe seats filled, i.e. socially distant. try board last though. countries managing corona much better. South Korea started outbreak enforced greater quarantine restrictions back 100 new cases day. every country saying fuck it, let entire population get think so. But...      
Not masks.   
Not PPE.   
Not sanitizers.   
Not testing.   
Not tracing.    
     
Someone feel free correct I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm told stock market better ever probably fifht fourth centenary read got covid survived,I swear 100+ people seem imune get vaccinated I‚Äôm back normal

I‚Äôm done Holy smokes. hope stay safe healthy ordeal. allowed take much time work? Baffled American here. pay $3000 staying 90 days. God wasn‚Äôt 15-20 minutes

I think matters much. could spread minutes, days later people spread it, etc, etc. casual nature really worrying, something like happened here, known someone present company time corona, entire company would send home management lockdown. Anything less irresponsible. I've heard ""dime dozen"" read restrictions Victoria? consider violation rights. Jeez sounds exactly like situation states. find that? Everything I've seen US around 10th cdc corrupted white house. curve way. Unless detecting almost every case going recording 50,000 cases 200 deaths. depends thread honestly, general sentiment you‚Äôre allowed anything anymore rest time must never see family friends. look people replied me, they‚Äôre real lifeblood place. people stop caring corona, they‚Äôre going unsubscribe, you‚Äôre going see less people like me, people like you‚Äôre used to. planting another misinformation cover Western media. make sounds like (to random readers conversation) CCP covered entire event, truth never denied bloodshed outside square. always honest it. West lies China told truth. whole point. still low levels transmission hit 11 million, level risk low won‚Äôt need lockdown, shut businesses, etc. would still keep precautions place nursing homes long-term care facilities, make accommodations high-risk individuals workplace. Canadian, please stop  love uneducated antivaxxer joins conversation Fuck that. I‚Äôll take virus running course years take lockdown years. Oh ya 3 deaths Toronto since beginning August second wave sooooo baaaad guys! bad achievement easily ruined people refuse follow social distancing guidelines and/or wear masks. selfish people complain lockdowns too. Iowa It‚Äôs makes decisions us all. ball fumbled critical time, turnover.  ....as opposed USA Canada either enough tests turnaround time get result week. 
The wuhan lockdown appears pretty effective preventing major spread China. time expect testing capabilities ramped meet demand. Ok, clear still lockdowns, efficiently quickly. 

Meanwhile people elsewhere world still arguing wearing facemask community protection! Ideology indoctrination? LMAO ideology? West that's pushing political belief says ""votes, free media, protest necessary sufficient condition government representation"". keep calling ""value"", matter much repeat it, turn belief value. China's position simply pointing belief, value. There's ideology China's part. US fess up, trump NEVER will. This. work medical testing facility Utah, months long hiring freeze help prevent spread, started hiring massive amounts people help. can't afford another lockdown fucking first one bad yeah virus get traction take hold entire country, people die whilst desperately try prop economy government threaten break rules fines, fucked, welcome UK government wants working class back behind tills risking life economy even pay working class livable wage. county population 300K True. Usa needs 11 million infected it. (x10) Plug details estimate risk level. reasons change results. Fewer vaccinations means disease spread. Something recovered from. Show form solid proof worried called ‚Äúrushed‚Äù vaccine. no, Facebook posts antivax pages don‚Äôt count real. People getting results 8-10 hours India. Many friends got done! show labs around 11am results emailed around 7pm. $34 test free done govt agencies take around 24 hours tho. used job traveled, know people like there, can't imagine enjoying aspect it. Probably antifa poisoned him. Seine-et-Marne, c'est deux jours, il semble que c'est pareil pour Paris.

C'est pas li√©e au technologie directement, c'est li√©e au faite qu'ils sont d√©bord√©s et qu'ils finissent en burn avec la masse de travaille √† faire. trump fought testing beginning. certainly want that!!! Well picked seat booked last week. Whether that's seat get knows. Ryanair going Ryanair. talking places hour. Hello fellow circle jerker. refreshing see actually trolling Oh cancer new anti vax talking point now, autism? Cool cool. think food insecurity supply chain issues going forward? think already passed part March May toilet paper, cleaning supplies, meat always limited supply. Who's saying that? initial statement already lacked nuance (considering extent duration lockdown varies country), reply simply reflect direct alternative. take health seriously already things. terrible take.

Masks, social distancing, hand washing target virus specifically; CDC says would control 1-2 months everyone masked.

Masks trivially easy compared losing weight, diet, exercise, yet people somehow managed make masks highly partisan issue.

""Get healthy"" little help people elderly, already cancer, immune disorders, COPD, etc. Healthy people suffer long term complications, understand little complications. Healthy people spread virus much everyone else. Etc. You‚Äôre deluded think don‚Äôt lockdown right now. Schools still online, public events aren‚Äôt taking place, restaurants still operating partial capacity. Eek ... PDF web page somewhere?

PS 'patient' anyone catches ... ICUs .. perhaps admitted hospitals? know done that. Americans thinking billionaire single handedly fix country, far problems world South Africa Australia coming winter reported milder normal flu season, probably doubt lack international travel. Would rather end ventilator? Vaccine found...
Gov: wait everyone gets 3 years Southwest doesn‚Äôt reserve seats. made sure checked early enough first batch boarders, back makes sense avoid people got afterward. I‚Äôm also stuck people standing crowd end. leave one else crew. Worked best me. don‚Äôt think understand concept herd immunity begin with, look up. 

For starters imply new infections happens, endemic status really means disease stay us. Vaccine not, 2023 people still infected sars-cov2 occasionally.

herd immunity mathematical sense already effect first person went infection came antibodies. it‚Äôs on-off switch. big deal, Trump presidency already set back 60; unless that‚Äôs 20 top 60 would explain rise fascism. stupid spent millions africa 
Like eraticating polio flu malaria giving children water many MANY internet dipshits made conspiriscys plastic ocean no. believe get results coin self interest arround numbers. happens everywhere. good time thought bit main travelling routs lockdown order made sense. second time reach 0 infections clearly data processing ... may lunatic, politics trumps science Mars soon enough anysol (anyday Mars terms) ... 'seem' lunatic:) Whats ridiculous traveling outside safe country middle fuxking pandemic lol. Call idiot tax symptomatic. boss, convinced hoax go away come election, ordered call wait test results weekend labor day we'd busy. quote: ""If everyone got time waited results, they'd constantly get tested never work.""

So worked 3 days sore, disoriented, lightheaded runny nose getting positive results. 5 coworker tested positive coming week. One sister heart issues. contracted covid, suffered heart attack passed away. cant imagine going through, emotional hurricane whats happening family, top frustration come back workplace boss, directly responsible safety enforcing mask policies, still vehemently denies virus real. 

I hate cog machine. didnt realise two possible options. Sweden, one wears mask cases low stable. Woah sub changed last 3 months. everyone thinks like said ""think effect virus worlds economy"" - Bullshit. restrictions horrible effect economy, virus. Also horrible effects people's mental health huge increases suicides many come. cruel restrictions. usher 'new normal' Yes! wear masks vaccine gets rolled install nationwide lockdown 6 months.

Then maybe return social distancing + masks. dangerous get exposed virus current 0.4% deathrate get even closer 0% vaccine released.

After ban large social gatherings forever. point life work enrich elites. Yes. US first cases per capita long shot already. wow sounds fun. Socially distanced concerts sporting events. Wow sounds like great energy? Can‚Äôt wait socially distanced thanksgiving yea one actually eat dinner. Can‚Äôt forget socially distanced Halloween parties. course social distanceD vacations. that‚Äôs exactly want worry entire time I‚Äôm relaxing somewhere. 

People aren‚Äôt going vaccine shows up. barely stop No, sick. Stay fuck home. it‚Äôs good. could spurious result also could real toxicity showing. big mistake many US states Europe: throwing open bars, indoor-dining, resuming holiday travel still community spread. 

Like partially dousing campfire: sparks wild fire. Let's bring US everything already mask mandates live yet ... literally one three people wear masks office undergoing second wave. fact literally couple weeks since supervisor told pandemic over.

How world going convince people wear masks years vaccines can‚Äôt seem convince people already mask wearing socially distancing? I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs pipe dream. Nah need work, meassle cold can't stop you. 1/5 patients seem get neurological problems. 3/4 get scars heart. Crush third time lol  looks like (Australia) learnt lot takes sustain numbers relatively little intervention, states incredibly! aligns case numbers they'll fall place states. You‚Äôd use violence get wear one rest life. ‚Äùif‚Äù pretty important. son four meters tall 2030 keeps growing rate now... idea many flu vaccine doses US 2020-2021 influenza season Germany 25 million doses (population ~83 million). everyone get flu shot, next issue run trivalent vs quadrivalent vaccines. remember one year trivalent free virus run rampant found 4 component vaccine. run always strain covered. Yea well, Bull Gates also says dogs can't look up. mean, they‚Äôve really crushed once. now. Totally. 

Of course better idea like either Australia UK people arrested fined thousands promoting protest wearing mask. shutdown near Beijing shorter Wuhan learned isolate test fast

That's trying say. Shutting everything months cases low sustainable; even China realizes now. Look up. ever happened humans via vaccination. we've achieved via natural infections ""endemic"" status. pandemics last 1 year. lasted 3 average Right believe there's conspiracy personal many public private lab testing facilities, multiple district health boards, administrators central government database, Prime Minister's office ""mainstream media"" cover covid cases. words, fucking lunatic. Edit add this: defending user's cancer comment. wanted add context useful info however.

Biology complicated... many success stories, along notable - hopefully less-frequent - nightmare scenarios.

I know specifics Covid vaccines rushed, say many immunosuppressant drugs currently market cause cancer. Humira good example, since inhibits biological process regulates cellular apoptosis.. aka, killing cells like cancerous growths (Humira targets Tumor Necrosis Factor.. TNF).

I know... Humira vaccine, mechanism similar therapeutics. patients frequently monitored health issues caused drug itself. BTW, Humira killed tens thousands patients, still market better nothing guess.

Full disclosure: pro-vaccine, anti-rush, although understand need so. said, there's reason EVERY DRUG takes years get human clinical trials. (sorry yelling briefly)

Also worth mentioning, SARS 1 related story. Vaccine trials under-way, pandemic ended, work halted. However, animals given SARS 1 vaccine developed autoimmune disorders.. want that. yes, animals vitro, humans vivo.

The info mentioned pro-vaccine hopeful, want first try it. might first group immunity. 43% needed sweden. [Quarantine staff routinely that, apparently due miscommunication work sites government.

We‚Äôve ‚Äúfence hoppers‚Äù. cases taken seriously, given jail sentences. ‚ÄúSneaking supermarket‚Äù isn‚Äôt common occurrence. dust nuke orbit. safe side. government power force inject citizens anything. Yeah. needed slow wait better treatments, training docs, creating protocols, finding respirators. can't stop it, need look Europe, 2nd wave cause stopped measures. Lately? 3 years least ... governments toned responses now?

I hate sound like conspiracy theorist ... know something don't?

Or suspect deadlier mutation might suddenly appear?

Or maybe expect mutation even different virus later date, using test run?

I simply understand what's going on. economies lives totally messed virus whilst serious mega killer. Amazon announced it‚Äôs hiring 100,000 people, fourth big hiring spree year. It‚Äôs selfish expect people live anti social anti human nature lives extended period time. don‚Äôt think understand mental health quality life issues go on. isn‚Äôt one note issue. consider things death sickness.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* countries case. Maybe others follow protocols. Welp 2000 guys first? Get arrested smoking weed go icp concert  long diligent persevere, can. keeping cases low requires violations human rights.

They would right. Victoria used military forces drones enforce lockdown. Agreed. Education, EPA, CDC, HHS, NOAA, Immigration, Justice... might easier name departments undermined and/or gutted politicians name ""small government."" B: Cause massive economic disruption

This one struggle disagree with. 5-6 weeks lockdown followed careful reopening much less economic disruption letting virus roll indefinitely, causing even mental, physical financial harm mention number deaths. Look USA. shit show, faring worse anyone else. (edit: reference, I'm American) imagine big issue States finances you‚Äôre isolating waiting test result. I‚Äôm Melbourne, Australia, turnaround currently 24 hours apply $450 payment loss income self isolation (noting turnaround 24 hours moment three days month back testing surge): read miscarriages way up, sadly, can‚Äôt find it. What's Age's excuse? They're owned Murdoch they've worst far. ABC fuck right too.

Nothing whinging remonstrating entire media here. wrong, charge, least Texas. 

and one guy charged $11,000 test (in news 2+ weeks ago). live really isn't. Precisely, government going employing doctors. people still skulls?  think amount people end dying regardless whether reduce cases time? Mhm, someone Victoria here. day loosened lockdown slightly second wave we're getting started people took things far. people starting protest lockdown could easily go downhill again. RNA detection outbreak indicator like ""you engage doublespeak, except reddit thread"". Ok, got it.  Kinda happy I'm isolated schools campus, we've pulling stops contain shit. group friends max 7 people. Hopefully make thru That's actually good news. new vaccine going straightforward clinical without investigated side effect would suspect.

People report every incident expected (and assume reports public) guarantee vaccine goes clinical it'll safe. (I surprised among many vaccines trial make it) Yeah I‚Äôm Florida haha. agree you, know areas would worse others. anecdotally people saying thread seems bit dramatic already know. It‚Äôs better nothing, it‚Äôs great. alternative would take multiple days get results, impractical. don‚Äôt think know word ‚Äúguarantees‚Äù means. 40 sure People Sweden grasping straws moment. 80-100,000 people Denmark went skiing Italy Austria Februar. That's similar maybe even compared Sweden per capita. wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúfree this‚Äù (pandemics) China doesn‚Äôt exist. provided two examples widespread pandemics NA evidence statement. people blamed Mexico Swine Flu, Americans Spanish Flu. Viruses mutate anywhere, mitigation works doesn‚Äôt work 100% time.

What matters deal pandemics, present future. control responsible for. experts ones letting trials continue US. general public.

This article experts saying public.  Schools NSW open since May, haven‚Äôt huge breaks. Occasionally little blips top them-easy access free testing fast result times. government preparing country lockdowns social distancing restrictions. last weeks compliance really reduced, people aren‚Äôt really paying attention listening government recently. (I think government bears responsibility this) 

As result infections rising country. Show source this, cause worldmeters US 19th. counting tiny countries, around 10th. Unfortunately, also picked industry destroying planet terms environment. Really, people flying, even over. ever. routine vaccine coverage - good proxy measure health systems functioning - dropping levels last seen 1990s

no **quite literally clickbait nonsense** - even literally zero people world got vaccinations since COVID started, 
""routine vaccination coverage"" - percentage people worldwide ""routine"" long-term vaccines like polio, dtap etc - would experienced **slight decrease** due newborns small number expiring vaccinations

what IHME data cited report *really says* read **rate new vaccinations** plummeted levels seen since 90s, course entirely due people avoiding doctors literally everyone else due COVID - actual routine vaccination coverage percentage global population barely dipped nowhere *near* low 30 years ago US cannot stand mildest inconveniences. expect useful change equal asking old woman walk water. gonna say anencephalic Apart fact actual science free look at, complicated boring dry media take couple interesting lines blow however want whilst governments around world try decide what‚Äôs best using combination science, politics, play media actually think best outcome. New Zealand great opportunity afforded relatively small population land borders able decide early lockdown hard stop spread. worked best objectives. ""Bill Gates says...""

50 Shades Gates Basically waiters place, one fulltime one barely fulltime (I'm guessing could see coming going). restaurant shut early never opened up. got unemployment plus $600 whatever got stimulus money. I'm pretty sure doubled income 5 months without working lick. could wrong think started babysitting someone along way I'm sure free.

I say rich but, yeah basically completely different station life past 6 months. flipped houses (including one live across street them) come number conversations foreclosures, auctions, mortgages, PMI, interest rates consequently allowed get details recent financial changes.

In end, good them. put pandemic scoffing conspiracy theory propagating aside nice people.

But yeah, think estimation 80% people America unemployment making added $600 check working says lot working populace. Iceland? Probably bigger cities resources also urgency since there's contact potential course see relevance comparing long term cost lockdown cost nothing all.

If this, another lockdown future. Well that's cos liberals stopped trump building wall

Right ?! Take ""massive"", please, we're Facebook... ""massive"" paired ""failure"" referring Brazil, US, UK others... wait till HR starts firing people long waits negative results thanks fevers flu season... see outrageous. Why? agree comment? still think Trump good country dumb - consider Republicans behind him, supporting him, too.

Edit: skimmed comments words. lockdowns quarantines, deluding virus safe, even Trump believe things. :/ Same. won‚Äôt go back vaccine I‚Äôm sure plenty reasons people left aren‚Äôt idiotic. People go dangerous places rest world pandemic. knew beforehand would cost return still needed/wanted leave, seems fair enough. sure provide nuance statements, okay.  problem Italy. generally takes 24-48 hours get result time get appointment test itself. Switzerland too. one need Trump anti-maskers. hand hard deny lot influence shape lots people's opinions. effect numbers.

Quite opposite corticosteroids. Never want again. decided pandemic elections run ;) Well proposed one alternative, albeit irrelevant discussion. It‚Äôs terrible number. There‚Äôs nothing decent amount people infected that‚Äôs known cases. Maybe seems huge looking Australia maybe looks ok US ü§î Almost every indoor public space require masks. Masks alone absolutely enough stop spread, helps slow down. people take seriously anymore, go restaurants, bars, party spread it. mask usage places. We???? mean republican leadership voters put matter 50% false positive? flip coin takes 1 second want able take kids park. haven‚Äôt left house much since March. missed entire summer. already promised 6 year old we‚Äôd make entire day go stuff outside regardless weather safely it. almost 2 year old park life, soon got old enough go often pandemic hit. It‚Äôs depressing. f‚Äôd royally Victoria 99% second break (genomic tracing) came poor hotel quarantine procedures private security companies looking hotels. learnt tough lesson, hopefully doesn‚Äôt happen again. Sydney pretty steady things pretty normal though lots people still working home careful exposure pretty simple, dont care always say ""IhAvE mAsK!11!1"" Trump Republican Party - call Yup, Canada same. Ontario often 6+ hour line get test, standing outside. may get results 5 days.

It's absolute mess, especially since many months prepare second wave... everyone wearing mask social distancing get it? shut-ins encounter anywhere online.

Comments endorsing mask usage disliked?! wrong people?!!

That happened think know it. Like others said, yes... masks would safer masks. would driving. activity fun. safer nay it, nobody going life life like that. 

Posts pretending mask usage new normal and/or make changes day day life insane. Source? happen, they'd need made majority exceptionalist morons.  You‚Äôve listed literally two incompetent governments (worst world worst Europe respectively terms Covid response) tried extrapolate seems legit one dumbest names sub ever seen think alberta actually gets pushed high range, generally hear Ontario BC low end tried That's I'm talking about, people think would die virus, survive. got people think survive brutally dying, weird. debunked trillion times. OP hates Sweden reason. Take vitamin c, zinc attend these. help. outrageous enough fork billions speed along.

Put money mouth is. general population? Middle next year. always case. FALSE ALARM, EVERYBODY. spoke person said that. full admitted trolling. Good news, y'all! Read article. vaccine likely 50-75% effective may even reach 60% threshold need ‚Äúherd immunity.‚Äù Plus vaccine rollout takes time.  Yay! Thank goodness! Sorry that, homie. should‚Äôve knew.  find 10% extremely hard believe. telling 2-5 million Americans right - 200k NYC alone? seems vastly likely percentages people throw - 10%, 50%, 78% - percentage subset severe cases. idea big subsets are. 

We need population-wide surveys looking problems. nobody interested knowing answers. made money this? entrepreneurs don‚Äôt typically things free talk year based certain politician‚Äôs desire vaccine election November, pharma company‚Äôs news release. 

The vaccine experts thought vaccine general population year impossible proven right. Again, getting closer towards top per capita satisfactory sort ‚Äúgreat‚Äù performance poster said a) far ahead numbers infections (we MUCH testing done amount infections have); b) lot - - Covid tests country clinically irrelevant since turnaround time week trolling. You: ""I think I'm unscientific""

Also you: claims true proven otherwise!

Where country fail educate you? Dude, said person believed schools can't able return 8 years now? must've high, sir. implemented adhered to, maybe. U.S. end death rate 5x higher world average? really attributing high death rate *because* lockdown?

Do ever get tired arguing bad faith? LOL. Unfortunately USA mask wearing seen political statement going rally 400,000 people around country sign patriotism. 11,000 - would daily weekly figure? fly Nashville tomorrow. ;-;7 F Wait, expect people stick swab nose? I'm expert, I'd wager people ain't going right. They'll get halfway, says ""fuck it, that's far enough"" 'cause fairly unpleasant. classic Republican whataboutism. spend money make happen us Bill. healthcare system worked better providing care I‚Äôm Indianapolis I‚Äôve tested 3 times. First time June, results 2 days. July, results 3 days, tested last week got results less 24 hours. people still wear masks socially distance couple years

Many already. couple years happening. administration botched pretty much everything pandemic. seemingly working plan, though details allocation light. probably find way mess Sweden go herd immunity even though Sweden supporters denies it. 

Here proof:

Tegnell Aftonbladet March 15:

""However, beginning reach understanding virus stop spreading reach herd immunity. must done calmly, slowly controlled manner healthcare system time deal it, must rush it.""

Tegnell Aftonbladet March 16:

""Anders Tegnell praises British idea ‚Äã‚Äãherd immunity: 'Where need go'""

Tegnell Aftonbladet February 1:

""- feeling close common flu danger duration.""

Tegnell Expressen February 21:

""It far ordinary flu,"" thinks Anders Tegnell.

Tegnell Norwegian public service TV April 17:

Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell says many indications achieve flock immunity corona Stockholm May.


And Tegnell desperately tries defend failed herd immunity strategy even citing Ivor ""The Fat Emperor"" Cummings dry tinder hypothesis. Ridicilous.

And BTW: Swedish following closely inside Sweden. Ten times many deaths neighbors nothing failure lasting problem might Swedish long haulers recover fully Nursing homes Sweden people already old, frail, sick, die. longer stay home, even care workers visiting multiple times day. 1/4 die within first month, even without covid. people put ICU, basically nothing help comfortable die. months largely unmitigated spread 

Where been? Hahahaha!! hilarious! First class comedy! Thanks laughs!  Well, plenty places cut spending without hurting nation. Lots waste budget, lining pockets politicians going programs. Voting 20-30 year reps voting fresh blood would help.

We look national debt problem day. looking solutions. sadly think one many reasons West take COVID seriously, all. fall Europe America started take note time already late. 

if memory served right, isolated cases SARS Canada, none (?) US, mostly viewed ""Asian"" thing back then. Yes construct perfect scenario like mentioned it‚Äôs easy, every scenario? It‚Äôs green light. batch doses at-risk groups like health care workers emergency use authorization. green light won‚Äôt come there‚Äôs trial data in. Canada. fiance Thank this!  means what....at least 70 million cases actuality? people immunocompromised can‚Äôt get vaccines? Fuck ‚Äòem, right? Oh ok, good me? see...........

Also, one September 4th August 24th. Try again? still Ah bill Gates, scientifically qualified individual is.  (and maybe paywall prevented seeing this) article basically suggests many ‚Äúexposed‚Äù few, any, actually became infected. Probably shut up. qualified talk this. money make expert. goes Elan Musk understand difference actually. assuming 3x infected know about, we'd looking 1% rate, Rachel used. one‚Äôs getting vaccine election.  American greed selfishness. we‚Äôd enough PPE. didn‚Äôt enough protect patients healthcare workers. That‚Äôs elective procedures stopped. 

We don‚Äôt produce hardly PPE, one invoked DPA.

So, likely not. international travel vaccinations definitely thing though. gets me. done hjorrible job, gates notes, people still seem think roll vaccine efficiently. 

A vaccine poses many challenges. One lot complicated make test. Two, requires two shots, logistical hurdle, although future vaccines might require one.

Neither Norway Finland actual lockdown spring, name one. Especially Norway adopted pretty much strategy Sweden, three key game-changing actions:

-they closed borders mid-March;

-they started testing massively early March;

-they sealed care homes immediately.

Oh, closed schools couple weeks, purely political decision - local scientific committee staunchly it, still Oslo peak pandemic. look like locked-down city it. Plenty people around, busy shops, crowded parks, masks sight.

Restaurants never closed law one forced inside home. Sweden gets criticized wrong reasons, namely ""tHeY lOcKdOwN LoOk NoRwAy!"", actually quite opposite - tried adopt strategy Norway adopted, failed (or put better - successful keeping death rates low). Denmark country among Nordics actually lock down. Wear mask, carry hand sanitizer, sanitize get close, give hug. Thank you, knows. comment doesnt fully align others beliefs topic go ham lol. that's stupid TV show that's it, surprised ppl responsible shit would apologize days I'm sorry hear that! hope able get care needs soon.

They're basically universally free US well.

And again, enforced strong social distancing purpose lockdown, try understand difference intrinsic social distancing populations SD NY. Well yes, that's happens ramp testing.

Unfortunately people without money left holding bags. *Only  said flattening curve makes take longer. mean that? takes longer? virus go away? Well anything prevent it, way goes away herd immunity. please explain comment meant implying herd immunity? husband getting tested due possible exposure told could still go out. not. guidance given also inconsistent.  need vaccine people forced comply. could eradicate human population less month could coordinate world wide. majority western eastern world could go back normal testing anyone coming outside virus free areas. end day you‚Äôre still wearing something oxygen hole.

Also, complicated situation involves lot changes occur. then, tip fucking server. Rachel Maddow whole segment it. can't find directly, seems important 65-70% US population multiplied death rate 1-3%.

Maybe donate 10 billion$ testing first known COVID death Brazil mid late Jan. started spreading *after* summer ended would suggest fits pattern OP (as present summer, spreading exponentially) Yep, gonna say same. I've gotten 3 tests point 20-24 hours. media called hospitals warzones said staff huge shifts non-stop patients.
I mean distance. close identifying them. Filming public place, distance, showing busy hospitals ton sick possibly sick people turning - validating 'warzones' claim. Seems extremely dubious say expected hospitals dead quiet 8 months gigantic pandemic? people world smartphones, none filmed apartment window like ""look nuts is, hospital near getting overwhelmed!"" ? believe hospitals busy one video evidence been?  Yeah, stop trying make fetch happen. going happen. SARA-cov-2 name virus.

Because want zero consistencies name things whatever. got suck know people identify math idiot based one word post. know dumb math entire life. pointed you, that's time bail.

Any, let's make proportional (google it). saying there's actually $5MM (google it) deaths! Omg! saying really 5 times worse everyone making be?

Prove it, dipshit. already working home. absolutely need flights right now? hear you‚Äôre saying yes would people defying mandate people country think one tell do, genuinely believe people would worn them. something seeing president abide mandate endorse. would seen entire Obama family wearing masks probably lot White House staff news time. would never said hoax, would pressers every day real experts believe science.

I also think virus wouldn‚Äôt gotten control Obama charge would actual plan. formed pandemic task force Trump admin completely destroyed! could much better prepared that‚Äôs really comes to. 

There also something leader cares goes gives speeches acknowledging people‚Äôs suffering asking everyone strong. instills hope dark times. Trump hasn‚Äôt even acknowledged dead shown empathy towards suffering, it‚Äôs causing even despair. Good. I'm prepared forever. can't imagine breathing people's shit grocery store restaurant concert. Here's hoping finally kills tipping culture. stopped aiming herd immunity 

Was never advocating basic social distancing

Has beginning least high risk areas.

Masks still encouraged (but also discouraged), start recomending *if* cases start rising rapidly autumn rolling in. got test done Wednesday got results back next morning. Maybe 'can't' right word made specific, definitely true hundred millions Asians already did.

But Asian countries even lower flu mortality nations.  sort knee jerk, assumptive response aren‚Äôt able set realistic expectations people level headed conversations. I've saying along is: worried virus capacity, stay home.

Let rest us get economy moving again. Money won‚Äôt feed you, clothe you, medicate you, treat tooth ache, grow crop, harvest crop, build house, arrest murderer, remove tumor, unclog toilet, literally million things need.

If everyone stays inside, everyone eventually dies. happen agree, care Bill Gates opinion matter. Neither you. /r/EnoughWillyGatesSpam end sight currently million dead Americans herd immunity.  worse that: freedumbers probably suffer badly, OTHERS will. 


IOW, give fuck ANYbody themselves. understand

You I‚Äôm honestly sure anyone flying told sacrifice vaccine...

Except that's started. First flattening curve. mutated bunch things ""until vaccine""...which may never happen.

So...you put faith vaccine. Don‚Äôt know, compare America rest world makes America look bad. doesn‚Äôt really matter European countries seeing record breaking case numbers much higher America‚Äôs adjusted population. That‚Äôs according experts sub love move goalpost virus. E-mail leaks kinda proved actual strategy herd immunity.

We can‚Äôt 100% judge it‚Äôs right wrong pandemic ends though.  insane two people read words come completely different conclusions.

Ill leave said we, specifically called government. inferred everything else. teachers many parents come literally said won‚Äôt get tested test children. one wants reason school closes.

buddy, I've got news, ending whether anybody else likes not. Norway entered chat. bite fingers? Maybe government's poor response pandemic going argument socialized medicine. ""Look incompetent COVID-19, seriously want us charge health care? die!"" realize achieve heard immunity we'd somewhere 2-6 million dead Americans, right? many friends family willing sacrifice towards goal? parts Sweden got hit worst also parts Sweden highest population densities. rural northern areas even close numbers compared say Stockholm. Got source besides ass? Live MA- pretty much ACA originally set up.

Spreading misinformation conspiracy theories like sub rules former epi lives Hawaii, worked public health (infectious disease prevention testing) decade, actually somewhat dependent income vacation rental, mixed feelings.

Personally encourage anyone fly reason unless guarantee remove properly fitting KN95 masks even moment drink water. Pretty hard shortest flights CA take 5ish hours time actually plane. inter-island (20-40 minute) flights serve everyone drinks results plane masks time. allow non-masks passengers, including face shields, nose out, poor seal, bandanas main airline, crazy me. 

However, comfortable risks. Pre-testing eliminate some, actively infectious passengers. Given that, recently Hawaii one worst states, means 100 random passengers would fewer infectious people 100 random residents. residents done perfectly good job spreading control since July, resulted 2nd shelter place order main island 70% population, tourists go anyway, weeks we're seeing major drops new cases positive rate.

We highest unemployment nation highest cost living virtually economic activity outside military, government, tourism. 1/3 employees lost jobs March returned. got laid first time 35 years working husband also work, due COVID, virtually everyone know. 

The downside get negative test within 72 hours flight, easy many places, supposed quarantine 100% 14 days actually done past 6 months virtually monitoring contact tracing.

Many European countries facing second waves sweden thus far avoided cases way vaccine widely available + distributed shouldn‚Äôt wear mask

[Um, Damn, that's strong metaphor. Masks absolutely necessary abundance hand sanitizer. It‚Äôs necessary evil hundreds thousands people, every precaution taken. air circulation purification enhanced without raising costs, acted reduce spread.

Piss wanker. rest world disagrees you. Got source even World Health Organization April saying evidence aerosol transmission? think understand. state, NY, WORKER tests positive get 2 weeks paid employer, whether part-time full-time. Why? employer get copy test confirms results test. Then, NYS reimburse employer total amount. take test private clinit urgent care. done NYS Department Health, process much faster. Either way, ANYONE working moment get two weeks test positive. Also, rent NYS frozen State helping lost job revenue paying state program. Furthermore, evictions resume October state already reopened. many states may different, emphasized New York live here. Dude get 4 hours max. India! Sort of, testing facilities public health departments definitely slow weekends.  Chinese CDC confirmed aerosol transmission virus back Feb. got seven COVID tests done central Illinois, longest wait four days (my first test). really right  Front line workers, across board, demand vastly higher wages. read poster wrote? doesn‚Äôt make sense allow visitors word mouth temp check patient can‚Äôt visitors without tested.  One probably picture couple thousand individuals mind try hard enough. Hundreds thousands nothing statistic.

This need start referring proportional terms, example: people died 9/11.  Imagine went back time saved them. least two people dead COVID-19. Many debilitating lingering effects getting it. Many soon get probably couple past seven months US, roughly equivalent one World Trade Center tower falling *every single day*, six months. That's many people died thing might otherwise lived. towers continue fall day get control. is. fifteen minute test. ample time manufacture them.

But what, there's organized structure society shift efforts that?

Because bend capitalism making tests using old ones gonna make so-and-so much money. What's claim made? 

Oh well, chose silence yourself.

Again, wanted say thanks encouraging words leave house sometimes. live alone need buy food?

It's better US people feel like come work even they're sick. Oh God, America would protests upon protests tried this

I think mean would Patriotic Americans Exercising Rights^(TM) someone tried this. Protests Antifa. Yeah, mean, trust word keep employees start-up employed bought out.

That's pretty far cry thinking he'll inject tracking microchip disguise vaccine though. Thank words encouragement. still reaching 1 appointment setup next week. mixed reviews I'm still looking case.

[Coronavirus Vaccine make sense limit visitation limit spread? test determine we've Covid19? first got really sick back March, tests rare hospitals full, sent home told quarantine. symptoms life threatening yet, there's nothing would done differently even tested. put steroids help breath. use nebulizer least 5 times per day, previously using maybe twice per year. 

Fast forward today, I've similar symptoms hit lime brick wall least twice since then. last 2-4 weeks time. sucks. able get tested every time March. I've always tested negative. I'm wondering got March I'm one people long term complications. I‚Äôm vaccinated. I‚Äôm low priority vaccination group anyway, time I‚Äôm vaccinated, everyone else getting vaccinated too. sympathy antivaxxers handwringing ‚Äúrushed‚Äù. opinion one random pediatrician. think still 48hrs Canada since got tested. Bill gates full crap. trust guy reason. Maybe try reading case patient, intense symptoms second time first, serious time. made much nicer. Thank you. lockdown makes sense approaching hospital capacity. Eventually cases going rise 11 1000+ again. Social distancing masks unfortunately become ideal scenarios. There's always one group would conform. Here's latest case/death charts Georgia, running 7-day 61.32 deaths per 100k population, ranking 17th among US Smh chadstone protesters!

Hell first wave test kits cdc took much longer 70% failure rate. them, including quick ones much reliable. people really get satisfaction saying wave 2 coming? long do*omers preaching ? Get life well, technically no. ""airborne"" black white. everything FAR virus spread air. Lighter viruses float far considered ""airborne"". heavier viruses coronaviruses heavy can't float far generally needs droplets cough transmit.

but people commonly think ""if airborne can't spread air"" refused socially distance wear masks. CDC calling airborne people take seriously ""airborne"" serious connotation.

I hope helps, people places high population density socially distance control mandated wearing masks. still think CDC incompetent somehow think placating anti-mask people going help. say ""fuck it"" recommend mask mandate. Fuck argument ""freedom"". constitution already ruled allow exceptions. last time checked, ""life"" comes ""liberty"" ""happiness"".

Socially distancing like pull-out method. Wearing mask wearing condom.

None mentioned. They're treating virus come UK know nothing it. 
The testing situation well ridiculous, saw local newspaper someone tried get test live near North London closest could offer Inverness 500 miles away. seem remember Boris saying testing key, gonna testing 100s thousands people day keep control, allowed slip away? country run complete morons. virus seasonal affected behavioral changes people across seasons RemindME! 3 weeks ""come check"" Bill gates science mate really shouldn‚Äôt Yeah plenty tests short, ones get cheap, people take weeks. dad work get tested every weeks. last time go aswell seeing hired work last week. 

We ended getting results ride home, 30 minutes. 9/11? Question: 

When Bill Gates become infectious disease expert?

Inventing windows absurdly wealthy make boob lord populace Covid rules. 

If wants testing, donate 10 billion getting done. Otherwise, shut cockhole Gates he‚Äôs talking risk pandemic years, literally TED talk it. would probably better listening month $600 ending went old field home healthcare actually employed still home kids getting regular unemployment think still babysitting someone. Exactly. guy saved millions lives, ask? much money us give charity cure diseases? there‚Äôs whole spectrum symptoms 0.2% death (could higher).

But using figure 0.2% death, would also mean outcomes would approx 0.6% intensive care, 3% hospitalisation, 10% seeking medical care say that? Sh said following precautions.

#shit already knew purposefully thick here, reason going get worse winter brings opportunity virus spread. Think dorm house many people. summer, times building full capacity likely less summer. wheather good people likely more. Also importantly, windows likely closed, people rely central heating. means one person virus gets in, average, rest people building way chances come contact person get infected. see time regular flu, although additional factor able survive easily cold too. coronavirus, seems virus really affected much weather. weird? looks like normal picture thinking something Italy 5x old people America, dude. positivity rate like 50% peak, meaning missing least 10x actual number infections. There's one strain COVID that's 10x deadlier lingered Europe. Age population accounts small portion excess deaths. COVID mortality strongly associated underlying health conditions, Italy healthier population America. whole point let snowball first place though right? 

Thats whole point contact tracing. $600 extra ended months ago. discrepancies across country? went got tested 9/11 could go back work results negative. got results 20 minutes. Wtf people wait days weeks something given minutes? enough support given alleviate wait tests matter issue public safety?? H√§h√§h√§ make sounds like (to random readers conversation) CCP covered entire event, truth never denied bloodshed outside square. always honest it.

Edit: strange, entitled, selfish, whiny hill choose die on. Really dignified whine people's problems worked own. 3rd graders think. look forward dignified mature response. Trump said back March Pence leading effort partnering private businesses. would drive-through testing anyone wanted Walmart CVS parking lots.

But yet are... late September... Still fighting stuff states left fend even face criticism trying respond blue governors. doctors use health app 

It's theirs, company's got forced mindless admin.

What wanting aren't? lot stuff happen automatically (lab results getting posted, example) 
He started working fulltime home healthcare late aug ( early sept?) old field I'm sure start waiting wont send kids school wear masks against.

But housing cost wise, I'm burbs Pittsburgh. actually really cheap area house. rent one 3br houses $1100 could easily buy one slightly less desirable neighborhood $75-100K  math mortgage way cheaper buy lot people pretty crappy financials get started. honestly think fine keeping house.  make rent depending house buy make mortgage. yeah making bank staying home.

My wife ran numbers AVP bank work full time (Overall great combined salary area) would made (or least taken home) slightly unemployment double $600 weekly bump. Uk test numbers kind bullshit, though Possibly yes. pretty much already know fatality rate disease ""lower looks"". case fatility rate US 3% (204,122 / 7,005,686), almost one believes that's true fatality rate (IFR). 

Figuring IFR new disease shaky data exercise theory fact. far general consensus well 1%, believe significantly lower that. relatively impossible tell many cases already gone unreported. fairly common estimate true cases 8x higher catch testing (an estimate linked site seems roughly agreeing with). Maybe we'll never know. true, yes death rate would quite bit lower we've thought ordeal. Yup. Everyone wears mask grocery store, even though active cases. two week incubation period, makes sense. Everyone smart enough realize want standing line outside liquor store middle January, wearing mask small price pay. Definitely qualified you. Wow literally read whole article waiting make kind point title article literally entire article. nothing lol. Courts overruling covid restrictions care civil rights. overruling restrictions serve business interests. Y'all seem understand that, folks got twice need get re-exposed. r exposed 31 million y'all. Uh STDs aren't? Bill gates could give us money ended lockdown, I'm pretty sure we're still keeping external borders closed regulations/restrictions imports though. exactly reimbursement systems perverse incentive?

All think spent early tech can‚Äôt / won‚Äôt switch over. point peak state county highest cases. here, tested twice week past weeks go week week. use rapid tests. 

I know they're accurate tests better nothing. see tests widely available throughout US. I'm Maine noticed indoor wedding happening local community center street live. masks, outbreak I'm annoyed would choose indoors all.

If committing entire life someone, commit extra year wait safe, keep super small, try new way getting married streaming partying Zoom shit. Anything maskless wedding people eat dance together indoors.  What? Yes. Definitely.

Ok let's imagine country population 1000 people. entire population tested three times every day one PCR machine.

Contrast country of, let's say 330 million people. would take 110,000 machines test everyone country three times.

There 110,000 machines available purchase, set up, validation testing. PCR testing walkaway test. can't speed up. Smaller countries simply hurdles larger countries comes testing. long clinical lab two, already necessary testing infrastructure. implement point care swab procedure. Look positivity rate Brazil, Mexico India. That's numbers look like countries poor testing infrastructure.

The ability test today nothing missteps Trump admin made Jan-Mar. Unless health-care worker front-line jobs. unlikely offered it. Offitt well-known expert vaccination, also pediatrician. would call second ripple. Gotta go back 50 years then. 4.6 million people die air pollution every year. shut world people? mean dont know long term effects virus. people coming cardiomyopathy lead sudden death heart failure even mild cases. Yes. first US patient sign posted door warning medical staff airborne transmission. posted reddit. also merely confirmed Chinese medical staff told us submitted academic journals...and ignores common sense whole thing. get 3rd time via surfaces cold food transmission Christian's persecuting themselves. Something fucked up, slipped net snowballed control.

There's finite amount contact tracers do. matter going ""oh got it, everyone bus stay home"" like, track every person bus, every person second bus people first bus changing lines, every person platforms, every person 12 buses platform people got etc. like manhunt escaped inmate, every time find clue 3 inmates escape. Meanwhile public actively harbouring them, helping escape team/staff going holidays starting tomorrow. 

It's doable people. Manageable dozen Impossible hundreds. took hours country. Wait, still spreading US? guys time? 200k dead?? ffs üö© billions people country still can't afford health care, still can't pay college, still go bed hungry citizens continue struggle basic income inequality racial inequality I'd say yeah, done jack shit far see. think helping others hard, sadly money gets wrapped foundations tiny fraction actually help people. Either way, congratulations defending billionaires. obviously need help get internet warriors nothing better do. Smh. MS autoimmune disorder. triggered virus. good reason taking hard look whether vaccine responsible case. Yeah exactly. ‚Äúlet‚Äôs open everything‚Äù people tried change narrative. point lockdowns wasn‚Äôt overwhelm hospitals exactly...I mean yeah that‚Äôs important equally important contact tracing fast efficient testing. open things happens control exposure. No, no, see 11 cases that‚Äôs going straight 200,000 dead Australia (the US everything right, really great, everyone calling US asking we‚Äôve done great job). 

People selfish 1. What‚Äôs inherently wrong roadblocks? used catch DUI. least important.

2. Inciting offence offence jurisdictions. real complaint prohibition gatherings (which think justified, you). Otherwise known as:

Checkpoints set make sure people valid reasons leaving Metropolitan Melbourne, stop flooding vulnerable regional suburbs.

Police well within rights arrest people inciting protests state disaster. one(s)? Excess deaths 275k. Calling 'true cases 8x higher confirmed' bad talking points force fed people. would put deadly flu, we've already established far deadly flu. CDC WHO. Can‚Äôt tell anymore one better this. hear cost benefit analysis stacks up.

Well, given we're two laymen (read: idiots) talking internet, I'm comparing mine yours.

Where line protecting economy? allowed international tourism still? continue events? Concerts? Sports?

Where economic line vs. life people? understand point, failure quarantine process? NZ 0 domestic transmissions months. way COVID re-introduced NZ imported cases, yet process well tightly scrutinised.

Obviously disastrous compared US, UK, etc. still quite bad given well NZ otherwise. Australian English worst. Hate it

Edit: downvoted opinion? Grow up. everybody likes horrible accent come reports talking virus like happened last week? harm?

The removal choice freedom otherwise free society. 
That's huge. 
Even agree subject. fail see evidence current pandemic decades current form. course forever natural reserves likely mutate eventually bit inconvenience deaths worse flu deaths. true would put deadly flu, infectious. think we've established deadly flu projections bad. Nice job going post history finding go college. Fucking creepy. 

Globally, people die air pollution higher rate covid. don‚Äôt shut world people would far larger negative effect anything air pollution. I‚Äôd argue true lockdown. estimated lockdowns thrust [100 people worldwide extreme poverty. decade progress issue lost. Poverty cause many deaths well people living able afford proper healthcare sanitation. US, wealth educational gap upper class lower class risen. shutdowns primarily affected jobs done lower class people children people fallen behind education. Wealthy children afford private tutors it‚Äôs easier attend online school meeting. case lower class children. article topic. issue affects K-12 kids also low income [college students well. It‚Äôs estimated current K-12 students expect make [3% course lifetimes due educational disruption lockdowns. Keep mind percentage higher lower income students. effect educational disruption alone US economy expected 14 trillion dollars. [60% businesses closed covid close permanently. put numerous people jobs massive ripple effect economy. 

I support mask mandates mitigation measures, isolation elderly immunocompromised. deaths due covid locked everything down? likely, manageable. Sweden didn‚Äôt lock death rate higher neighbors never overwhelmed neighbors economy wasn‚Äôt hard hit countries Europe. 

All things considered, think lockdowns worse virus consider nuanced approach mitigation measures. socially distance safe without mask. credible source? Nope, consulted professionals looked me, published findings form news article. wouldn‚Äôt mind would stop lecturing public like judges right wrong. Especially man particular. walked restaurant craving indian food. saw ppl sitting around, masks dining. walked hell back out. always find reality somewhere black white.

You're either rolling dice ""rushed"" vaccine rolling dice virus itself, ludicrously contagious. 

It's global pandemic. need risk acceptance hope come side it. it‚Äôs weather...OZ exempted.  course important point statement ""routine vaccine coverage... dropping levels last seen 1990s"" flat wrong, never mind ridiculously overblown title post government paying everyone stay home? Asking US. big reason lock work state unemployment varies considerably. someone loved games back then, NFS Porsche best NFS. NZ pure white ants, please ever change Yet president still holds maskless Campaign rallies proving point citations. first reference, Western media article cites Chinese media taking Tiananmen incident. article shamelessly lied ""The students participants take violent actions put forward radical demands."" died police killed themselves. Exactly! Meanwhile still idiots convinced flattening curve good enough refuse change mind seeing successes countries took strict lockdown measures. keep saying ""eradication never goal"" damn well been.

It's lot easier support population short hard lockdown trying sustain restrictions indefinitely vaccine distributed (years never). find new pathogen, make sense let spread fully understand long term effects capable mutating quickly enough avoid permanent immunity. give chance become another flu cold?! idea negative karma. true comment Yep. 1 3, pandemic means working home. 1 3, means financial devastation. former could care less latter. Well, convenient, then, GOP spine.

I've got 53 senators mind fill study. not. would put death rate flu. think we've agreed point deadly flu. Fine. Let disease kill seniors debilitate people long-term, apparently that's acceptable price pay. believe china‚Äôs numbers bridge sell you. mostly minority terminally online people. majority society (including liberals favoring lockdown) busy celebrating. Totally agree here, hysteria main stream media liable whipping disgraceful, need balance. We‚Äôre opening much cases basically zero. roadmap basically elimination

Edit: saying 'no elimination', ""final step"" roadmap requires two weeks new cases, ""COVID-normal"" requires 28 days new ~~active~~ cases active cases. get average fewer five cases day get relatively minor freedoms e.g. still one household visit home, end roadmap. wrong, Mark McGowan currently [89% Western Australia, something ABC notes dictators would happy with.

Funny eradicating virus community does, it. Protect peoples lives livelihoods, get justly rewarded. OK. Let‚Äôs wait see. say second lockdown IIRC. friends California photo business. flew across country bunch weddings Maine/Vermont/New Hampshire. indoors ones wearing masks. get people work uhhh...shouldn‚Äôt that? gives shit? made choice wasnt forced upon her. wanted marry friends it. Good hear addressed Right mate, haven‚Äôt flown since March told ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù job 2022 sometime. 

Frankly don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs thought mess retraining pilots, massive safety ramifications pilots haven‚Äôt flown 2 plus years suddenly charge high performance aircraft again. literally saying all, go on. No, comes salary. like South Korea... oh wait mean New Zealand..... oh wait seeing rising cases. many people take vaccine herd immunity. Instead, people fed measures let virus run course runs steam like Sweden.

It ideal outcome, outcome. Sorry vaccine done November. They‚Äôre still testing. small amount people might able vaccine end year, won‚Äôt available next year attempting number states Australia (somewhat unintentionally) eliminated virus. WA, SA, TAS NT COVID free months strict border place 14 days quarantine arrivals states.

Everyone always forgets ACT - similar success dealing NT, added complication feasible hard border closure integrated economies ACT lot smaller towns NSW (Yass, Queanbeyan, etc). think community spread since April May, new cases since interstate arrivals. around 10 weeks since last confirmed case, believe. Holy shit guys word describes literally media US CDC excess deaths. Well, mask mandate, things would worse, huh? Yes, Americans notorious disdain rules safety, many us good citizens whatever government tells us to, right? mask mandate, matter many selfish people businesses choose disobey it, still better mask mandate all.

This hold true, even mask mandate indeed extended release vaccine. Sure,  4 human coronaviruses currently circulation. 

Also, I'd love answer questions feel like valid situation. 6 states Australia say differently. Let‚Äôs see... Glad hear cost benefit analysis stacks up.

Still waiting government release theirs. what‚Äôs point (sounds blunt hear out)? Thailand went way attempting eliminate cases tourist industry (20% GDP) shambles government real exit plan remove tight restrictions open international borders. Though one might argue Australia much less reliant international travel Thailand, course. 

I understand want manage reduce cases elimination cost necessary seems like extremely short sighted lazy strategy. Focus numbers nothing else seems cause problems means forced close borders indefinitely solution opening keeping case numbers low. 

Completely understand desire keep low case counts elimination goal seems really bad strategy country wants form open travel future. Management keeping hospitals running well seems much optimal political strategy perspective (not necessarily considering morals allowing people die since kind separate political policy comes economic crisis management).

Genuinely curious thoughts way, opinion willing learn Australian take it. trying argumentative advocate loosening restrictions :)  people may goal beginning, messaging need lockdown overwhelm hospitals unequivocally stated goal.  declining rate important thing aware unless assuming something cautious of: go away soon. Seems like took 2 paychecks normal unemployment light fire make change. think people visited axe safe Covid. Don‚Äôt worry, neither Europeans, governments care Yea. kinda like it. Prime ministers talk show hosts, smile time. set giant industries sightly back, 20 years? No. change trying get low possible vaccine matter what?

When Australia NZ pretty much eradicated disease. 160 days since last transmission state I'm in, Western Australia.

This region world we're unique - Vietnam, Thailand, PNG, Hong Kong, South Korea, China (you're allowed believe it), Malaysia, along aforementioned New Zealand suppressed virus point pretty much gone, top head. Correct spot wrong.

Except, Vic unfortunate leak, large case counts community.. it's, ostracize region, kill thousands people, unknown consequences many - batten weeks reconnect peers/trading partners/country part of. chose sensible option, imo. White anting new favorite phrase. someone 65 getting flu deadly COVID. 50, COVID essentially nothing statistically compared diseases morbidity rates. can't afford another lockdown fucking first one bad yeah virus get traction take hold entire country,

It always going that. first lockdowns bought us months treatments improve, cost destroying Western economy. We'll see worth it. borders closed quarantines maybe... wonder you‚Äôre downvoted, don‚Äôt seem much idea what‚Äôs going Australia. might assume Australia clearly idea what's going here. Kiwi, never heard white-anting either don‚Äôt need 0 cases lockdown. sketchy quick tests. lol find evidence shows around decades?

Csn find evidence shows will? Exactly, made big point graph figures predictions think going happen. example look like doubles every 7 days. 

It clear jump cases recently, I've seen seems plateaued towards end last week. next week two key understanding growth rate actually on.  clear it‚Äôs seven weeks extreme lock plus ~~two~~ 3.5 additional prior weeks still pretty darn strong lockdown, ~~nine~~ 10.5 counting (and longer ‚Äòhotspot‚Äô postcodes)   I'm UK, got tested start May went hospital appendicitis. told would get results ASAP needed know safe ward not. said ""chasing up"" results.

They never told me.

I'm assuming since let hospital couple days later tell isolate negative still would appreciated actually told. alien invasion movies authorities also shown moving quickly.

It like, 6 months invasion government declares ""we think come space hostile."" Gotcha. Sorry that. thought disagreeing me.  care worse flu. still insignificant threat require severe mandates we've seen thus far. Texans. took Mexican army 13 days 100 men 1500. arent going let Covid scare us. order GM start making vents like March April? 

And coming someone works state public health lab, DHHR horribly underfunded years. begining turn machines *we literally 4*. They've telling people decades simply money substantial raises would slow turnover rate (that's fun one too, we're also understaffed pay dogshit!) magically shit 3 mill new machines thankfully job like hour. fucking mess, we're trying hard like told build new house every week get one box nails 2 guys help you. crazy. I've absolutely lost faith country backs time crisis. Flu could greatly reduced coherent system allow sick people stay home without worry financial burden. that.

But flu lot easier control. far less contagious. I'm sure worth also factoring economic health consequences society due impact lockdowns.

I do, value peoples life economy. also believe economy would worse without lockdowns, since obvious can't coherently follow things like social distancing mask mandates North America. would mean virus decides businesses die, instead financials/ability adapt.  Rechargeable.

Wash, rinse, sanitize boom done. One month lockdown get outbreaks? don‚Äôt need put richest powerful air quotes. bc America isn‚Äôt competent, doesn‚Äôt make richest powerful. American? Ruined us Europeans living here. find evidence shows around decades? lets forget vaccine current time vaccine authorised. There's also never history vaccines vaccine developed coronavirus (there's 4 human coronaviruses currently circulation). 

If high risk, worried flu well? prior flu seasons wear mask exactly now? know going say flu bad flu takes many thousands lives year, surely would logic person shop flu wear mask dangerous you. 99.96% survival rate cough threat definitely is, especially vaccine comes. QLD, SA WA would like say hello. Things basically NORMAL here.

I worry parents dying.

i visit professors work face face without worry kill them.

I consider horrors unfolding USA doorstep.

What's negativity? Hold someone wants use phone. got get aol minutes Would get away that? something 'just' affects poor people communities color, supporters give shit anyway. opinion Sweden? mask mandate currently one lowest infection rates whole Europe right now. Meanwhile, Czech Republic among first adopt nation-wide mask mandate initially praised cases exploding right now. First we'll need elect Joe Biden, Trump never correct course. guess way Trump treating China.

Also Trump Hanoi really popular well, street vendors selling t-shirts need dial instead ethernet cable attached PC? makes feel better, USA one struggling this.

France flailing badly testing weeks. People Paris wait line sometimes 6-8 hours. *promised* turnaround 72 hours, already slow. they're making promise, often 5-7 days That's well good believe expensive fly NZ, expensive NZ dont often fly long weekend. went got covid test 2pm Friday results back 7am Saturday. America can‚Äôt this... don‚Äôt understand. right, Senate helped people instead playing political games. 200K Americans dead numbers projected head 400K January, think lose-lose people can‚Äôt support families may die trying. Yep, it‚Äôs nice total fuckwit president NZ went 102 days without case. would anecdoctal evidence tell dont go long without symptomatic cases popping community spread original 4 100 within week so. That's quickly works doesnt hide well. genomic sequencing verified strain yet seen NZ earlier stage. Believe want base facts.  people miss sister caught common cold go take test. received (negative) results next day, little 24 hours. good news everyone contact her.

I can't imagine must like wait 5+ days results. point, near useless hope contact tracing lost.  psychotic free all.

That feel well. 

We keep moving around world trying find less psychopaths, find different flavours. 

Having said that; USA's specific brand extreme experience. humans developed countries can't.   may get downvoted eitherway going take first round vaccines released unless credible countries like germany approve use themselves. seen enough USA,russia,china's concern citizens trust them... told us nothing right? Gates needs hang again, look happened India 2013 go on!! Sounds like politics trumping science. everyone catches flu, hospitals fill up, economy crashes, live last bit year wondering we'll live next year. much. reality is, could anybody *good job* handling Corona Pandemic*? blindsided. entire plant blindsided. like playbook. Considering less full year thing, working ground-zero seven months ago, (collectively) made incredible strides forward recognizing, identifying, managing beast. perfect, think overall response (again, collectively) pretty damn impressive. Ya think Gates would make good president? dunno feel commentary lately subtlely political. 

Think wants run for? lol. job asks feel sick come in. also know people make min wage always answer ""no"" regardless can't afford quarantine.  Covid (well specifically Ardern's Bridges' responses) literally difference Labour marginally behind National polls January/February 25+ points ahead now. Thailand fantastic. testing (it costs 300 dollars test local pop can't afford) cases. They're lucky resulted serious outbreaks yet. plenty stories countries receiving visitors Thailand test positive... obviously must got whilst leaving Thai airspace since official word community spread Thailand itself.

Truth every country handled badly, ones sent sick elderly homes huge death tolls, cases going deaths stable. idea real death rate piss poor record keeping (got test march. got run bus july - that's covid19 death) piss poor testing.

Nobody comes pandemic smelling like roses, least megalomaniacs counter top exercise similar coronavirus spreading around world months coronavirus discovered geniuses Rockerfeller institute suggested scenario back 2011 bother alerting people calling shutting air-travel anything else might learned contain virus early stages. don‚Äôt think infrastructure issue, it‚Äôs social distancing wearing mask, washing hands, etc.

I absolutely agree GOP controlled Senate done enough provide relief American people.  return NZ citizen, 2 weeks isolation management facility. left NZ August came back pay ( $3000 ) thinking arrived jobsite now. Driving south tretheway Sinclair saw bus around 5:35am packed gills people. masked, fuck motorized Petrie dish  agree. better that. likely 10% detected cases. undetected mostly milder. Less 24hours australia. can't hide epidemic.   Imagine imagining watched weekend understood happening somewhat follow conversations. felt stupid. know skeptics living Germany Hitler felt watched majority population blindly eat fascist propaganda convince people hold antisemitic views. groupthink different scenario driven fear, subreddit represents peak collective. Agreed. Send us checks Bill! run office Look, 0 cases per day entire 2018 anywhere world. Why? virus anywhere human society infect anyone. China's goal always cut entirely much possible transmission routes virus. virus infect anyone without anyone infect. Hence slogan, ""stay home, starve virus"". Hence entire Chinese society shut late Jan - early Feb, everyone travelled Hubei even across provincial boundaries strongly urged self-quarantine 14 days support systems set across China help groceries rubbish, etc. Hence internal border checks refusals unjustified entry many parts China time. Hence ""closed community"" approach. plan always block possible routes new transmissions taking care already infected. entirety Hubei city-by-city border closure, contact tracing done incredible detail. virus runs course people already infected, we'd safe threat infecting people.

Also, far government-led event. pretty much common sense Chinese people want live society SARS-like epidemic runs rampant. people takes care massive efforts online offline inform people important (technical) information, masks work long virus lasts virus may killed cases &amp; when, persuade people (especially friends family members) take necessary precautions masking disinfection. Govt action crucial things like contact tracing, medical care, border actions, meant thing without people. thanksgiving, xmas, new years winter keeping everyone indoors kinda fucked. 

Folks little social gatherings see friends inside, meeting family holidays food around table hours. Opening gifts inside etc etc. new years drinking. rough months. Wondering get tested today. I've got unproductive cough kept awake last night sore throat woke early. Slight congestion/runny nose. fever speak of. I've moments extreme tiredness past days. anybody experience CVS drive-thru testing? insurance, I'm worried hidden fees. need cut lines change criterias match testing capacity. Getting result weeks later pretty useless. implication word ‚Äúcrush‚Äù one done thing? part Ontario in? I‚Äôm also Ontario, got tested twice. 

First time line 3.5 hours took 30 hours results. 

Second time spent 45 minutes line took 18 hours get results. 

This Ottawa, small town. got hit harder failed implement measures. Oh look, actually accurate narrative.

Sweden got hit hard restriction could implemented, late stop making excuses. Finland also hit hard start March, yet never let get bad.

No...
How come twisted conclution?
Finland got hit less hard didnt large portion population traveling rolled nationwide testing April lockdown. Again, irrelevant excuse.

Makes comparison less relevant, relevant.
You can't compare two increadibly flawed data sources...
Compare deaths per capita see Finland ha d√§r breeze compared give official source this. Stop making unsubstantiated claims.

I question intelligence understand compare deaths 2019 deaths 2020? combined reported yearly deaths 2009-2019 averaged comparing 2020. means 'under morality' theory largely irrelevant excess deaths numbers 2020 simply derived counted low death total 2019 alone.

Our average deaths per year bit 90,000...
Therefor less 90,000 deaths per year always said New Zealand's 12.2%. said otherwise?

Why spouting shit new Zealand hit less hard realize service industry comprises bigger % Finland's GDP Sweden's, right? keep spreading misinformation despite already given sources contradict claims?

Yeah... much bigger spike, able contain outbreak timeframe Sweden. think could achieved without lockdown?

Maybe, provavly not.

Again, lockdown never option Swedish disingenuous - lockdowns work effectively job meant - flatten curve prevent explosion cases. Social distancing masks far important actually keeping outbreak control. idea single measure end false narrative one's pushing.

Yeah sure, obviously work.
Again, option New Zealand reliant service (especially tourism) industry Sweden. Finland. What's excuse now?

Obviously not, trade services way less oil goods relevant industrial trade. Oh wait, isn't.

No, obviously not...
But main natural rescource norway composition sector agriculture: 2.3% industry: 33.7% services: agriculture: 1.6% industry: 33% services: agriculture: 2.7% industry: 28.2% services: born yesterday?

Internal services irrlevant we're discussing trade stop...

Trade services % GDP relevant, nothing clearly larger (not much larger) trade services Finland much larger new Zealand (percentage direct cause, *70% contributing cause (which still counted COVID death every country, Sweden included) 15% deaths non-attributable COVID.

If someone deathbed happen covid system pass, person die covid casues put situation, age, cancer sure point is. think government unaware reporting number COVID deaths?

No goverment made clear counting way (over counting) propper way untill finalize propper report pandemic ""over"".
Our helath authority speculates likely time early Read skewing data involving comorbidities biases.

You know conspiracy social media isnt exactly paper/study local health authority....
Thinking beyond ludicrous.

And even putting Swedish goverment level trust current US goverment beyond ludicrous, atleast regards report data trust...

I get new Zealand done good job, obviously have.
But comparing Sweden neighbours New Zealand short sighted, none Swedish neighbours options lockdown hit beginning.
And new Zealand small island country middle nowhere.
No wonder managed pandemic good done. Lots confusion January, Lancet journal indicated airborne early February. Chinese officials (plus Hongkong University medical dean?) pretty much said airborne end February. European CDC equivalents still denied early March, end March/early April concede wrong. discovery certain clades contagious and/or likely cause severe illness?  Canada too. say 24-48 hours, you‚Äôre positive get results within 24 hours. got two tests done first took 30 hours results, second 18. site assumes low IFR projections way, way recently estimates many infected bit ludicrous. example expected deaths drop half August (because model showed many infected expecting herd immunity), continued expect drop every day since didn't. 

Edit: Currently seems big drop disappeared estimates, maybe corrected IFR now. understand dismissiveness, potent argument put forth authoritarian lovers around world. hard time trying provide examples S. Korea New Zealand, working democracies able handle pandemic. many, simplified everything China versus United States model follow, right needle swung hard China. 


I'm speaking Indonesian Chinese living Indonesian Chinese community. know experience replicated elsewhere. Also number obese people higher. total 4? total 2 follow?  wife went Philippines got results less 24 hrs heard common.

America worse 3rd world now. believe masks! someone lot letters behind name, job scientists explain level without letters behind name evaluate understand. Unfortunately scientists this. 250k excess deaths currently. Yes no. 

If using test people already socialize essential workers, yes help catch cases quicker reducing spread. 

But people werent planning socialize takes test trust negative result go things get worse unidentified positive cases wondering around. Well, installation Garrison Commander wrong, true.

You believe comparing surrounding or, best, equally bumbling European continent.

I going go list vast majority failed. Every single point countered ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs fault/decision‚Äù. 

Just copy Vietnam. reason much better doctors janitors alike willing sleep cardboard mats speak children, taken care neighbor, video call. Neighborhoods get sent Army bases quarantine little resistance. poor, uneducated country still suffering four wars last 70 years.

Toughen nothing going get better. Ever. depends mean rapid, I'm getting PCR tests back hour Well feel like partially true. rich powerful get results immediately? Like NFL players President? think may misunderstood comment.

I saying people choosing get tested prioritizing convenience others health community. may made abundantly clear could priorities 100% backwards.   It‚Äôs going rolling fast make bottle finish EUA on. think middle next year anyone able get vaccinated wants it, there‚Äôs going ever-expanding ring people vaccinated slowing spread disease.

Here‚Äôs CDC‚Äôs current playbook:  read study also. posted /r/COVID19 week ago. citing accurately. You‚Äôre one coming asshole. start patriotic war hero stuff, fallacy talk like this. people attempted good job completely hamstrung thwarted every attempt. they're personally good individual jobs mean good job addressing pandemic whole.

They good job fully capable spades. fired, killed, otherwise prevented so. Thank you, hug back neighbor Portland - hope you‚Äôve okay fires &lt;3 Agree completely. Cabin pressurization inherently means cabin airflow system engineered waaaayyy better public transportation. 

Masks, quasi physical barriers (seat backs rows), little direct talking, increased vigilance (people *assume* risk airplane). I've tried get tested country, seriously letting unless ""very high fever"" said. Also pay get tested, complain much taking time. Goodyear vote. lot going get sick make others sick, vaccine 100% effective. 26 hour wait last week - bad. (negative :) Virtual urgent care visit test within hour. I'm Illinois, get 24 hour results too. think he's referring fact many people don't, individual experiences nothing he's talking about. well inn case underreporting deaths, India 1. daily 2000 2500 people dying covid19 Govt care Avoid American costs. give damn social distancing. way put insufficient evidence evidence available unlikely cause. know. Yes, would‚Äôve thought country insane amounts propaganda inside outside country, blatant authoritarian methods controlling disease, literal genocide going within country, extremely expansionistic neo-colonistic questionable. would‚Äôve guessed likely iowa  got shit taken out, take synthroid every day lot better graves symptoms took out. 

How eyes? Mine bulged bit active took 10 years ago hasn‚Äôt got worse. Someone's probably already producing Hollywood. That's flawless synopsis. Itll prime video Jan I'd wager. üò≠üò≠üò≠ Hope get good answers treatment options. Hugs Northwest. Flight Attendants low rate infection. can't even fact we're STILL good job handling it, world would admit never did? reported cases animals infected covid. animal reservoirs, impossible completely eliminate whole population long term. think give live current levels spread, also think reasonable assume lockdown cases reach zero go back lockdowns every time get another case popping up. hear saying virus/disease different (HIV/AIDS), need see say whether believe ""infected"" people still transmit virus, ""sick"" transmit. What's outrageous millions voters think bill gates created corona install microchips inside us. got mine Australia 8 hours Saturday! implies vaccine might harder attain. question - France also looking 2nd Lockdown like israel ? want, don‚Äôt force rest us it. nonsense. Different European countries completely different situations moment, every European French Spanish. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è COVID April, still chest pain. Seeing cardiologist Wednesday. I'm upset passed seeing Lumineers March Js Ondara opening them. knows we'll see live shows like again. blame anyone age 18, 18 mature excuse. laziness stupidity.

Let lesson allows grow, clearly cannot learn peoples' mistakes like many others can. never asked us tested, 
in fact told us exactly tested for. literally papers gave us. told us may test positive s-protien antibodies. everyone else failed, sir, defied odds. unbeatable words wind beneath wings. well documented started Wuhan, China.*

Your claim: ""If China exist would disease outbreak"".

My words: ""Two previous global pandemics started North America"". predicting future. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs unwritten. One fact. One not. Wow - 

Yeah one places US seems really stepped mask game US Airlines. 

Every domestic airline think strict days masks. even banned masks exhale valves bandannas. either those, provide different acceptable option. 

Southwest airlines delta know fact make point say mask must cover nose mouth, shy remind it. 

They also really policing ""slow eat/drink"" trick. usually get shut pretty hard. Holy shit. That's amazing. what's outrageous can't get tested without symptoms. asymps spreaders stuff well left no...India going beat USA october 1st week total cases.    see. announcement second patient neurological symptoms possibly vaccine might halted again. can‚Äôt imagine zombie movie starting explanation of: incurable pandemic swept world. medical company comes vaccine, testing rushed. missed small neurological side effect. Within year, 80% population taken three doses. neurological side effects amplified .... something else. point failed mitigating virus early good, really things help.

1. National coordination CDC recommendations include better apolitical recommendations money behind implementation.
2. money comes strings, including requirement certain regulatory changes states. public mask mandates.
3. could use defense act mobilize building machines, temporarily seizing patents need be.
4. National testing infrastructure, partnering Walmart whatever make rich people money pandemic current approach.
5. Use military national guard staff testing facilities processing (as appropriate good transparency)

I tired country thinking can't anything, vote shove trillions towards wealthy keep afloat donating politicians.

Remember ww2? mobilized rapidly way nobody thought possible. this! directly know 6-10 people gotten confirmed covid now. Definitely present part life. doubting, share heard Covid staying AC systems days? found study doesn‚Äôt really tell much. No. countries dealt swine flu, H1N1, Coxsackie, Nipah virus, Hand, foot Mouth virus etc contained it. thing before, trust health department leader knows take care citizen Why? Yep. found post google wits end advice socializing. want die.

I really miss going classes dance brewery chat, improv class. exist planet full NPC's like this. Especially ties hope ever get NPC engage. regret moving much career worthless. yeah disappointing/weird. first really seem like Oxford going driving boat. feel like still feasible Oct/Nov randomly drop Phase 3 results they're back top. suffer incompetence. hope Oxford vaccine eventually work, certainly set back. I'm betting Pfizer/bioNTech one hear lot America. There's something special America problems apparently can't solved solved countries, there's nothing done. many countries able testing right, scale. somehow there's solution America. country problem mass shootings, there's solution America. country high incarceration problem. there's solution America. time people stopped shrugging shoulders there's solution start looking countries done solve problems start implementing solutions here. live hour away city actually MANUFACTURES rapid test equipment take 7-10 days get results back here. Yeah thats downright lazy. 

On last southwest flight PVD BNA, cops waiting jetway BNA deal couple refused put masks. trying ""slow-eat"" trick...and got belligerent confronted flight attendant. Id like go see live sporting event-even gasp-at indoor stadium. cant even go outdoor stadium. (But may also free places US perhaps?)

At least Colorado tests free. drive take one, appointment needed. I've done times never waited 5 minutes. Results always come back 3 days. article dated September 9. wonder why? I'm guessing different testing centers type tests? know small urgent cares pharmacies them. I'm sure long takes, went government drive one months ago got results within ~36 hours. 

So I'm assuming difference testing centers, results found they're provided testing location? government setup lot workers going get results back quicker pharmacy would. doctor coworker talked primary care physician, rather neighbor. telling neighbor (who happens doctor) got throat swab neighbor doctor said reliable. (At least relayed coworker.) one said anything snot skipping things. read article says practice social distancing possible. People already going movies, live sporting event, concerts now. article doesnt call stricter precautions says people shouldnt completely stop masks social distancing soon vaccinated since others may vaccinated yet takes time. 

I cant walk target father taking care (aka sharing home with) lung cancer open lung surgery remove half left lung week ago. Keeping safe top priority. also high risk asthma. Whatever do, Canada, open border US. Nova Scotia basically island one major road in, get cocky. Americans failing this. Save yourselves. think bathroom worse rest plane...actually probably better vented. 

Just wash hands - use paper towel unlock open door....then throw away. Sanitize hands return seat. check chief:  get Covid test 20 minutes local urgent care. cost $50 top insurance bummer. come handy I'm going situations I'm going around people high risk. really saying CHINA places handled correctly? CHINA? saying would like welded homes die single person tests positive? loaded box taken god knows where, screaming crying whole time. government deny death idiot westerner praise dictatorship killed you. Watch videos China controlled it, it‚Äôs truly disgusting people like sit back PRAISE it. America literally founded principle give liberty give death audacity complain people want liberty? think China great suggest move find yourself. make sure starve flooding covering 80% chinas rice fields. opinion agreement many! people saw wearing masks beaches Croatia Italians. mask mandate shops, wore everywhere. even Germans that. nope. Never said anything remotely like that. oe point said would happy around 60% across general population want like PC-Principal southpark - usually pickup safety glasses gasket kit...you'll look 90's insane haha. Ok I‚Äôm saying perfect country describe may delay inevitable. could even worse time. scientists medical professionals say so. course doesn‚Äôt mean need live permanent state lockdown, decency wear masks, practice social distancing, move activities outside whenever possible then. thatll walk small pets

What spiders Florida?

When there, spider saw [golden silk orb weavers (Nephila photos eating small birds caught webs part they're pretty harmless. Biggest one saw legspan slightly larger hand.

If arachnophobe, they're terrifying I'm pretty sure average household cat dog taken one things. SE Asia, places like Vietnam

I wear one walking around big cities breathing air thousands *xe m√°y* hazardous.

Though yeah, hats long sleeves protect sun damage skin (not necessarily beauty). ebay option - primary concern days counterfeits. long reputable stores - I'll go them.  one likes it. one said would easy either.

There's weird sense entitlement part redditors, clearly fed this, want get back normal - speaking like entitled to.

Here scientists explaining there's going vaccine around mean able get back normal - least right away, and, possibly, never.

We entitled normal. entitled anything, fact. virus may fucked rest lives. vaccine mean selfish assholes whose behavior might endanger others. Vaccines complicated. kids decide anti-vaxxers. People fucked immune systems can't take them. Vaccines never 100% effective. on.

Are going promote sort eugenics bullshit figure unvaccinated pay simply want shop without masks again? Worthless unless actually enforced.  people get vaccinated going continue social distance wear masks realize everyone vaccinated continuing wear mask requirement enter stores, take flights, etc. Worse that, trump sabotaging gov every turn stuff like filling director level positions bunch key agencies. staffing agencies talentless sycophants work extract much money government possible. 

Then covid strikes US ripe decimated literally everything could allow happen. probably thinks fans witless rubes. probably mocks behind closed doors. literally vomits words make people cheer like bunch trained animals. 

Then protests happen fans flames emboldening racist folks keeping people others throats works russia sabotage election. key sycophants calling take gov force loses hopefully causes civil unrest base lose legitimately. 

I worried US. literally stands knife edge. unreliable, yes.

EDIT: /u/billabong2630 posted excellent reply below. Separately, every county state different testing protocols procedures test, making difficult determine actual issue is. Meanwhile San Francisco able go free testing facility, drive nose swabbed one minute, got results 20 hours. done! forgot country total lockdown, mean real one everyone comply also one following subsequent steps like gradual opening, compulsory mask wearing, big gathering excellent contact tracing. mention 24 hours test result, also countries usually responsible citizens listens science leaders stands them. steps US following whole?  hold long enough, see happens countries without risking bad news America. 6%. got mine 15 minutes today Worthless without actual enforcement. Lol Dr told get tested symptoms seemed like allergies. came direct contact one family members positive started ""allergy"" symptoms. Prescribed nose spray took $85 virtual visit...they want office positive covid... I'm going years evidence. flares infection squashed within 2 weeks new infection. 
Most people can't accept countries well traits, whose country should. want countries fail feel better nothing. Downplaying achievements accept countries means accepting failed. point Sweden FAILED claimed objective protect elderly. Derivative that, Swedish government collectively FOOLS believe could protect elderly given plan (if deserves designation) keep Sweden open possible. comes guessing state fumbled response, it‚Äôs like animaniacs sing countries song (but case, state) First two points bring cases down, less strain testing.

Yes, sure challenges third, experts may way better suggestion. Point even trying. Instead normalized unnecessary death shrugged certain politicians opt nothing make unified good response.

Basically agree points. 

Looking future, wake call ad hoc health care system exists actually covering everyone system respond global pandemics biological attack. Should, won't. Yeah I'm STL got mine back 24 hours month ago Eyes pealed, expectations calibrated... still hope though. looking data? Percent POSITIVE spiked late July, total testing currently higher ever been... Ok granted well someone better tell hospital system rapid PCR test use results &lt;30 minutes ""unreliable"" according guy reddit I‚Äôve heard minks. worry animal reservoirs future. still limit Hanna v tors far primary way virus spreads.  wonder making tests viable mass production. Damnit, knew set grueling pace cut everyone half-rations.

Well, least still extra wagon wheels. Why? takes 1-3 days Australia.. ""The Stand"" favorite book. read 10, dark, summer camp middle where. 

Real life pandemic kinda basic comparison awful ways world could end. tested back August Central Illinois test results within 45 minutes. expecting hours least. disagree, believe Americans egotistical literally willing die it.

My mind need leadership find rational course action. deficit among many, special keen critical thought. may help prevent people COVID-19 spreading virus others."" 

Masks protect you, straight CDC website. protect others covid. submitted high quality information reply low quality comment implying mask protect contracting virus someone else. shit. take half vacations risk huh ""Government"".

Stop debating next step actually something instead bullshit half measures. People fucked sure. really stop flaunted rules to. Cummings Boris, well like civil servants.....you fucked pay way to.

Other countries say could.

Us? tried arsed could.

Let's follow suit counties party fucked get dig graves look families eye. 
All laying school children blaming kids made decision. expect.

Grow back bone. sort out. Brazil straddles equator - temp doesnt change.

Sao Paulo populous city, latitude south equator -24deg, equivalent Bahamas Cuba - even closer equator anywhere Florida

its still pretty warm ""winter"" = average top temp coldest month 72F  far there's 60 kids quarantined, guess bad far? get idea always middle next year? would always predictable? 

No one knew would even vaccine created antibodies 4 months ago. Saying always going year half, possible, since know would ever get vaccine 3rd trials. 

What though, best outcome could hoped months ago. multiple vaccines trials 3rd trials. 

3rd trials last 25 months. means till Sept 2022, till trials completed first vaccines. obviously vaccines given general population even trials completed. one knows be. everyone gotten doses 3rd trials least one vaccine October time see bad reaction time see antibody levels. would seem benefit would far outweigh risk general population, give vaccine shown safe produce antibodies vs cost shutdowns loss another 200,000 lives.   I'm Pfizer one! Here's hoping got real thing. Nobody blames you. god's work. blame lack testing infrastructure. BC, waited line roughly hour right Labour Day results waiting next morning woke up. Ontario's problems happening across country.   little billy, think right time play blame game.
we woods yet, figure wrong afterwards. Ohhh I‚Äôve there, spurred even go ER toilet entire night could even sleep. went thyroid storm, terrible experience. wanna say medication inbetween diagnosis surgery. take like 12 pills 3 times day something like that. 

I‚Äôll tell experience surgery great. work month honestly fine couple weeks. surgeon great barely scar, sure gotten better past 15 years. believe take calcium supplements couple months chance damage parathyroid glands remove it, didn‚Äôt happen me. 

It took year get correct dosage synthroid symptoms crazy amazing compared graves symptoms. follow endocrinologist years dose stable said could followed PCP. 

Now get levels checked year adjust 25mcg years. Another plus synthroid 10 dollars 3 months Wal Mart even without insurance. 

The reason took 18 time prognosis best eyes take opposed using radioactive iodine kill it. 

Overall surgery best option don‚Äôt regret it, everyone‚Äôs situation different. questions let know!    embarrassing here. I'm asking evidence, failed provide now. tired constantly ashamed American lately. response nothing short ridiculous. wait 5 days see kids stomach bug make sure negative. Fuck Trump. Wait, Tenpenny real name Fallout stuff? Testing seems inconsistent terms eligible testing quickly get results. live California got tested UC Davis hospital went ER unrelated symptoms several months ago. symptoms COVID symptoms similar. told live risk father able get tested received results 24 hours. Test negative, expectes grateful allowed get tested.

Meanwhile one father's employees tested positive COVID. told talk health insurance, Kaiser Permanente, talked doctor, told would test showed symptoms. Absolutely awful ask me. exposure employee minimal wearing masks, still frustrated able get tested. Thanks info fact disease politicized one pathetic things ever. fucking DISEASE. need hope, enough data.

Everything monitored daily basis visible 643 Severe condition, 170 mechanically ventilated. Ummm....me roommate got free CDC drive test site. day. normal?  200k deaths later... government doesnt need ""in charge"" like police, fire department public schools.

It simply provide insurance/funding citizens set regulations healthcare providers.

All citizens (or however set eligibility) surrounding area funding medical care. healthcare providers simply need follow law (regulation) deliver services. would spend time eligible, time delivering services know government (or perhaps individual) pay for. benefits private competition, benefits public services. thread stop treating Bill Gates like sort Covid19 God. right, nothing unique enlightening saying. obvious stuff. 2 days missed work would take 2-3 months financially recover from. Assuming car break suprise expenses. 

Last checked, state tests available 3 days out, 6-12 day turn around time. 

2 weeks without pay would trigger debt sprial would result either eviction, bankruptcy car getting repoed. would lead losing job getting evicted. 

But luckily company's policy awaiting test results come work normally, wear mask times, opposed normal policy wearing mask feel like it. 

I experiencing symptoms month ago, submitted request test state department health. determined even though shortness breath, chest pains, fatigue, dry cough priority testing since spent 15 minutes contact positive person. explored private tests, booked available working hours. symptoms went away.  things sound great surface, consider following:

1. point valid really anything testing.

2. point valid really anything testing.

3. simple machines. take months build. industry leader Roche, Swiss company. can't use Ford's plants start cranking Cobas 8800s assembly line. Additionally, _have_ come Roche using Roche reagents such. make sure everything validated, lengthy process, trying validate random ass machine produced people know they're massive gamble, financially terms accuracy reliability.

5. absolutely want inject bunch randos secure testing facility. one, trained probably would active detriment scientists several months. another, would create chain custody nightmare, litigation would serious problem. 

The issue million tests per day capacity fine. demand exceeds that, failure population fed, state local governments prioritizing wrong things. Mask mandates universal strictly enforced. individuals small businesses subsidized indefinitely restaurants hot spots shut down. Cases need cut several orders magnitude effective contact tracing implemented. God fucks fuck themselves. many got sick many died?  thought Trump forced multiple companies manufacture ventilators back March April, not? Uhhh incredibly rare conditions happen FUCKING BLUE could easily coincidence. drug/vaccine trials MATTER adverse event , whether possibly related 0% chance it‚Äôs related all, must reported followed on.

I‚Äôve many patients ‚Äúrare‚Äù conditions years, including patients TM, MS, GBS. Young healthy people, get dropkicked mysterious disease underlying pathology.

That‚Äôs problem general public, little understanding medicine decides ‚Äúwell cause B, case closed, obvious, cracked code.‚Äù It‚Äôs fear mongering. Let experts research, let experts report, let experts follow appropriate procedures find (or not) shit seems like it‚Äôs related.

(Just know; without vaccine non zero likelihood getting MS TM)  shit circulates air elevator even infected person leaves. made claim refused back up. Christ, even reddit higher standard ""Google it"". Yes, correct. getting flu likely give GBS flu vaccine. However, massive push vaccinate whole country compare 1918 pandemic it...wasn‚Äôt. 

This clearly worst pandemic time. I‚Äôm really say vaccines aren‚Äôt safe. 

I saying vaccines (some types haven‚Äôt deployed scale) approved move along faster faster.

I think it‚Äôll work fine. think it‚Äôll safe enough. I‚Äôm optimistic. 

I saying though money world can‚Äôt buy time. Thus, acknowledge long-term effect possible. acknowledge moving much faster normal. can‚Äôt say xyz can‚Äôt happen. suppose extent that‚Äôs always case. 

I trust best brightest. wish billionaires could buy year observation vs less time. Prob won‚Äôt matter though, prob ok  Mine came back less 24 hours wait 5 hours line get it.

Edit: also shortage Convalescent Plasma Remedsivir, global shortage I'm afraid. Especially schools open.

WORST PLANET FAR. tested Tues, Sept 8, today Sun, Sept 20, still don‚Äôt results back. (NJ) anyone know promising treatments Covid could realistically available soon? I've heard EUA convalescent plasma, I'm sure that's going. Deaths still seem high. Umm duh, virus. getting stupid. Seriously... American's give easily, creative solutions anymore.


How universities. university biology department PCR machines. lot red tape using healthcare maybe maybe component president could cut red tape crisis.

We even need creative... need look beyond borders.  Sounds like shit coworkers shit boss Nope, Melbourne one super strict, curfew 8 30 p.m., Can't see anyone house, allowed 1 hour's exercise day. businesses closed. I‚Äôm sorry hear that. It‚Äôs scary wish Czech people best hope doesn‚Äôt spread. I‚Äôm NYC unfortunately covid March, everyone know sick time. spread fast, crazy. hope people learn places like NYC, Italy ... realize it‚Äôs joke. Czechs amazing far, it‚Äôs country praised deal covid hope stays way. First off, hear it, read it. Second, expected more, would make sense. Lolol.

You want try try again? corroborate news government experiences. certainly free disagree, cause suffering believe experiencing.  Accurate. visiting fianc√©‚Äôs family overseas everything kicked travel home don‚Äôt dual papers yet. Due autoimmune disease, always wear mask crowds. count extremely lucky considering airports US side screening (which bizarre Australia sorts biocontaminant testing even pandemic). Asian families wore masks, everyone rudely looked talked like plague rats. reality, anyone else wearing mask likely carrier, flying back US Australia ton Chinese travel. stupid. hoped work CDC realized fairly quickly something majorly wrong federal response. ‚ÄúGood‚Äù news immediately got accident shoulder injury able hermit great excuse ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt use dominant arm, feel terrible, think I‚Äôll stay home‚Äù. know, considering everyone acting like it‚Äôs big deal except closest family due wanting see and/or elderly. I‚Äôd president, I‚Äôd set contact tracing testing airports like S. Korea reasonable countries. Obviously. It‚Äôs painfully obvious. hasnt 1 per day, try again. Thailand, 70 million people, averaging 2-3 cases day past 4 months absolutely possible Yeah. couple weeks ago. Someone vaccine died (fell ill?) paused trial check vaccine killed him, turned vaccine sticky restarted. extremely unlikely. scientific research regarding already pointing direction. One thing people getting infected people working factory (by way, difference make ""blue collar"", way information relevant?), another thing virus concentrating, ""surviving"" package whatever period takes transported, infecting people side. theoretically possible (spoiler: isn't), evidence one 30 million confirmed cases around world happened way something similar. one microchip!
/s fast US ... :( yup 20% April. There‚Äôs zero chance NYC isn‚Äôt spread substantially slowed right due number people already antibodies. Nice read going full steam? Like letting foreign businessmen country? Tourism? Citizens allowed vacation country? Even fully eradicating virus stop popping second relax hotspot. Covid always circulating human population now, forever. Even vaccine, numbers likely drop low, people immunity type (either got vaccine) never truly eradicated. Always floating around somewhere. world can't even provided normal doctor care, food water everyone, way whole population earth going get vaccine, years years even one safe worked today. looks like robot. It‚Äôs weird. try counting tests take 48h less deliver results   Source Get antibody test cab Windows again. Fun times. Maybe look forward another Windows XP. pretty open, imo, shops/dining/recreation completely shut down. live LA mall near open, think closed. Even movie theaters open now.

There restrictions make safer, think great, people still lot shit before, mostly outdoors (which actually good thing imo - people happier get even little nature day).

The thing actually miss going gym, least feel guilty going sometimes xd seemed promising western countries biased towards Oxford name . 

Traditional inactivated vaccines like sinovac one promising Oxford branding Bruh really point? didnt seem know alot swedish elderly began conversation. wore masks. That's point. never said every single day. well, argument actually quite legitimate.  Unfortunately

I'm sorry I'm happy living US China. Actually I'm sorry. feel like I'm taking crazy pills. sub seems think China preferable US. insane care get downvoted saying that. sub basically r/sino point. stop US prioritizes public health payment, even government agencies. No, doesn‚Äôt. vaccine antibody response would much robust response natural infection, you‚Äôve heard much CD4 CD8 t-cell responses. cells remember trigger antibodies fight infection Supply chain distribution going serious challenge. We‚Äôre still problems test kits. people Beijing routinely wear masks. wore masks, cloth masks usually, days air pollution particularly bad, clearly sick /coughing /sneezing. also true Japan, Korea, whatever Asian country reddit mistakenly believes love wearing masks reason.  Testing data reported state health departments. spreading false narrative. here. Seems like every couple hours get another email saying sample shipment delayed. certainly make things easier. amazing China never topic posts sub.  almost like moderated type special interest! will. tell anyone got vaccine either. longer talk dirty mouth breathers happier get. put pants week. Fuck pants. misinformation spread, people think thats truth isnt Last month got calls back two days, twice, lost results first batch wanted come back. fast easy otherwise .  statement he‚Äôs gonna get lifetime immunity novel coronavirus, virus class notoriously short lived immunity, vaccine doesn‚Äôt yet exist seems bit bold claiming likely need multiple them. mention watching high profile protests funerals news common folk forced limit weddings funerals 10 people max 25% capacity, whichever lower say hospitalizations specifically testing data? says ""covid19 patient data"", assuming means data except testing results? That‚Äôs best case scenario. It‚Äôs also hard market. 
I work healthcare. lab gives 24 hour (from receipt lab) turn around time covid tests. 

We‚Äôve contacted local hospitals urgent cares, want stay Quest LabCorp (which take several days week). 

No idea do. 
Quest labcorp leased employees offices also set draw stations. 

We small lab afford get yearly draw station lesson agreement, yearly employee lease agreement. 
So even though capability increase daily covid tests ten fold; difficulty marketing getting business grabbed handful links random Google search /u/WhiteFarila believe reefer trailers thing. read links full detail. first time Ohio; we'll strike state list examples. Thank you. Sorry, assumed one vaccine cheerleaders. Middle 2021 always best case scenario. Kaiser Permanente got results back 48 hours. CVS took 4 days. Yes. Influenza coronavirus different viruses different DNA.    Lol! find comment offensive; matter fact, quite comical mildly amusing. copy &amp; pasted ""role media"" came biased sources carefully omitted key objectives like correcting fallacies objective reporting. ignorance confirms earlier assertion - fed filtered bs, take every ounce truth. Maybe grab Chinese dictionary research spewing half-truths. That's least pretend China expert. doesn‚Äôt mean body‚Äôs T-cell reaction antibody response antigen would different. Coronavirus mutations aren‚Äôt like influenza mutations. reinfection could outliers, expected, probably didn‚Äôt strong enough antibody response original infection body ‚Äòmemorize‚Äô response reinfection I‚Äôve following vaccine development pretty closely since May. people cheering vaccine news talked fall 2020, thought sounded good true. started researching vaccine experts saying. said middle 2021 earliest general population. also listened monthly Journal American Medical Association‚Äôs monthly interviews Fauci, would go detail timeline progress vaccines. also number articles news stories outlined challenges, getting approval, distribution supply chain. 

The vaccine production easiest part, sub cheering stories companies x many doses production, stories never mention exactly means. mean doses packaged ready distribution? news releases never clarify important detail, along details rollout general public. people usually read headlines make way many assumptions. Lockdown skeptics predicting march. goal switched eradication time around may media suddenly stopped talking deaths pivoted obsessing raw case counts without reference hospital capacity. anything open

I live LA many streets blocked outdoor dining (downtown Burbank like huge courtyard filled people dining hanging out), people still going parks, group exercise parking lots parks, movie theaters open weeks now. 

Comedians putting masked distanced stand comedy shows backyards (must nice rich xd), people embracing idea safe ""pod"" people, like couples friends, hang others homes. beaches still packed. stores open.

Sure, can't go club gym (the thing really miss) card shop drink inside bar, people exactly cooped staring walls. me, seems like hardly anything CLOSED lol

I personally dining going movie theaters gatherings beyond close people, people still living lives, better worse. really seem safe dine close proximity 50 people, better non-distanced indoor dining.

Oh also, go Catalina work weeks ago even Avalon still bustling ever... wait time 30-36 hours Canada. What‚Äôs current wait time are? hospitalizations, testing. Read actual article. CDC said 6,000 died covid

/s?~s I‚Äôm central IL get tested every week job. usual rate return 4-5 days, I‚Äôve go 6-7 days month. I‚Äôve used mix private clinics (free, appointment only) city testing site (drive thru). One time lab lost sample, that‚Äôll happen. Even though limit contact housemates masks required workplace, 4 days far long. get tested gets put chip. 

/s Sinopharm's inactivated virus vaccine, one phase 3 trial UAE. wasn‚Äôt bad experience. saw 1 guy wearing mask 4 flights. 4th July Awhile back article something like 1 3 Americans think life got better pandemic. There‚Äôs significant number people, many reddit, would kinda bummed go back normal. Coming American: seems Germany- Europe large- puts cultural value taking care whole instead making individual fight own. get facts from?
You sound like manipulated mediaüëå Thanks Bob woodward recordings president basically confirms china said mid February. Help use ur billions better testing I''m UK.

Currently arguing mother testing system UK far Boris Johnson likes call 'class leading' amongst European nations.

I talked client friend needs get son tested. best offered would involve 8 hour round trip including ferry trips back. mum says 'But know why', say 'It matter why, government 7 months put proper test system place still one. proper testing system involve single mothers two children - one symptoms - spending entire day away home.' Death rates lower among smokers reason. number theories why. Got mine 36 hrs TX week said winning? I'm stating fact know it. parents emigrated Singapore 20 years ago. cousin married Malaysian often visit cousins too. dad contracts Shenzhen. Looks like looking argument there's none. defensive? True one reasons pollution year Indonesian farmers decided burn thousands acres farmland causing haze. mask common thing Asia years moving goalposts. care everyone dies flu? effect you? selfish. walked testing site Vancouver two weeks ago, waited 20 minutes, received results 8 hours. Obviously may standard country-wide BC seems least things somewhat together point. Im ER nurse. told came contact another employee tested positive around mask. 5 days later felt minor symptoms wanted get checked I‚Äôm guy spreading it. Got tested employee health took 4 days get results. Wouldn‚Äôt let work used emergency PTO, EIT pay 3 days I‚Äôd missed. Meanwhile, people get results ER 3 hours they‚Äôre getting surgery.

Pathetic. worth, did. special hoops jump through. woke sore throat one day, registered online, got tested afternoon, results emailed next day.

I still all-in making testing rapid widespread possible, sharing experience system working. large-scale testing countries doing. Something like testing everybody Miami LA. help detect asymptomatic cases, give everybody piece mind. worst, that's ultimately they're needed most.

Only able perform crunch good. going ebb flow. maintain protocols beat it, get stuck cyclical armageddon.  Yolo. Fuck assholes following anything. working home 6 months, go get tested friends co worker. Thanks giving ammunition. Wife wants plan trip January friend's beach wedding. hope gets test results back within 72 hours, also rely results bride groom coming back time.

""But January long ways away"" sufficient arguement given trend we're going in. Bro I'm extroverted af, moved new city May HOLY FUUUUU sucks get live completely normal another 90 days til gets lmao Na, Americans probably keep wearing masks this.  Hubris European thang. Considering Phase III efficacy results released candidates that‚Äôs bold statement.  Sounds like got Trump president, too. doctors. small amount continuously refer to. called paid shills. 
Plenty doctors spoken saying hospitals empty 8 months shifts cancelled, staff laid etc. media show it. show one narrow avenue propaganda opposing view shut down, everyone gets branded 'conspiracy theorist' questioning extremely cruel restrictions. gives away want truth getting out. I'm China currently tested 5 times. last 2 times got result 9 hours taking test.  Yeah know feels like. Got mine 5 hours ok That‚Äôs probably untrue, go 15k cases day 2.5k day without anything stop infections literally anything‚Äôll outside house, friends extended family  got test two months ago, results. gave still symptom free two weeks potential exposure.

Oh, got bill office visit it. That's getting paid. bet people wearing masks. Solely population one thing, I'd wonder much US amount hypothetical average spend per person versus actual distribution? Unfortunately we've reached point US statistics need scrutiny released communist dictatorship healthy propaganda operation.

Sorry get pursue path wanted academically. Seems making lost time though pursuits. couple years social distancing? I‚Äôd kill myself. I‚Äôm distance hangout park masks horse shit YEARS. It‚Äôs simply going happen. I‚Äôm throwing life away this. I‚Äôve already sacrificed much. like freedumb. One point made original post earlier story russian patient jet one long distance capability. Hercules plane another plane, also long range one.

Checking bit more, swedish jet Learjet 45 range 3500 km std configuration. similar one link, speed well. difference two ownership, private contra public.

My guess reporter check much. guess know much reported. Correct, lobax? think health care workers similar. People critical jobs exposure ill patients. giving non-FDA approved vaccine people comorbidities. studies I‚Äôve seen primarily healthy people 18 55. Anti-maskers literately think mask makes oppressed muslim woman they're also forced wear face coverings. work lab results Covid tests, insanity right now. since March. virtually impossible result sheer number tests receive quickly. currently get around 5000 tests per day. That's 35000 tests week. added another 19 facilities accept tests number going keep growing. work around clock there's much get results out. process result non-Covid samples well. fair us forget patients need HIV Hep C testing. 

We're pushing much testing volume lab automation equipment overworked breaks least weekly. everything gets backed wait machines fixed. shortage almost supplies, especially cleaning supplies PPE. lab literally overflowing samples. We've find ways cram somewhere, literally everywhere turn another rack full Covid samples. enough room main lab hold everything, we've convert conference rooms temporary holding space.

We used pride 8-12 hour turnaround time getting test results clients, we're lucky get 24-48 hours. shoot 95% tests 8-12 hour TAT, since March, number fallen 72%. Everyone exhausted we're pushed limits. work overnights often end putting overtime try get jump start things. exhausting. life right work, feed pets, sleep. easy. kids family take care of. 

I promise we're best get results you, physically impossible move faster amount tests we're dealing with. Please please wear mask go out, continue social distancing thorough hand washing. Nothing going improve everyone starts part responsible stop spread. please sympathy local healthcare, retail, food service workers. We're trying best hard us right now. live Las Vegas, mask enforcement inside casinos extremely strict. high end casinos strip tourist action is, would expect get way business. Plus strip casinos still closed Impossible, installation Garrison Commander stating every week since COVID-19 lockdown March 0 cases COVID base. Yes, masks make sense. Thats works.

 Please read quote XiJinping.

Lol totally agree. iowas governor saying ""trust iowans right thing"" since march. people know iowa hotspot? big news weeks ago. many cases lately. know people even get news iowa, iowa.. exactly. None genetic mutations different enough need different antibody response. vaccines effective clades work. 

But immunity short lived (which proven dozens reinfections seeing immune systems perfect cases trigger robust response) could mean vaccinations would given often/in larger possibly split doses obtain lasting immunity. really know yet, would say immediately hinders vaccine efforts outside long may stay effective. 

The virus actually producing true stable strains discuss elsewhere post, term often misused. virus mutating different clades sub-clades strain.

Auckland busy freaking iconic harbor bridge structurally damaged truck blown freak wind gust. Normally bridge 5 lanes peak direction, that's two causing traffic drama.

Regards Covid-19 restrictions, weekend identified new cluster leaked border managed isolation facilities, confident Auckland cluster fully identified. public happy decision risk remains virus leaking Auckland requiring restrictions put back place, like relax. Also never found significant outbreak came from, able plug hole.

Given boarder leaks, lifting restrictions (going level 1) outside Auckland risks another cluster growing rapidly. Forced injection something ridiculously low death rate left hospitals empty around world 8 months. Yet sheep line fake 'vaccine' news tells to.

Sweden always right though so, carry killing grandpa grandma. brief DIY something use metal nsoe strip ear savers? Really curious would like try this. Ok nvm, article published 18th. old news. surprising considering half country‚Äôs citizens stupid even wear mask. terrible management United States, 'no doubt it.

So, United States sign brought control. bring pleasure, see sort game complete 'sides', fact remains virus caused lot damage United States government/people remain unable rein in.

I'm sure parts Europe visiting can't comment seen, surely can't England. England, people concerned compliant people become complacent. 

We four problems: test trace system fit purpose, large minority care never (nothing changed there), leisure industry knees due lock led town city centre pubs opened allowed stay open social distancing relaxed idea test trace could prevent local outbreaks. 

New found complacency among people explain happening England moment, although lot people put mildly idiotic. One example: stopped pint beer garden Saturday, outdoor service, take order outside, bring beer outside pay outside, got talking landlord complying recent guidance around different households socialising numbers people able sit together, punters coming happy complying guidelines able sit however many people wanted wherever wanted pizza place night before. people we're dealing here: they're like children see landlord trying keep safe, want whatever want regardless context. people grown complacent; they've like throughout pandemic. need mistake China made? Beijing Bill Scroll comments. response commenter who, rather address substance argument providing sources good faith, instead chose pivot conversation bad faith injecting irrelevant red herring. simply chose indulge 2 second google search. 

With said, think worthwhile pointing response problematic. organizations putting forward agenda own? 

""An agenda own,"" *not* carefully structured unadulterated disinformation information warfare campaigns propagated state sponsored level. condoning agenda's one imply clear obvious false equivalency. Furthermore lack credibility simply destruction epistemology point thing science, fact, systematic analysis turn divulge sea mere personal opinions (which social media figures like Trump indeed cause day still support Iraq war killed 500k civilians, based total lies. 

Attacking source. Also supporting ratings provided response comment widely accepted developed democratic world. international versions non-US entities come similar conclusions. Also, everything US politics. Also, google search, everything heritage support Iraq war. you‚Äôre simply trying distinguish state corporate-sourced propaganda. 

Correct. Generally forms propaganda bad. However forms, (like state propaganda) magnitudes worse due magnitude, veil credibility &amp; deniability, funding end goals. Huge structural differences yes, end it‚Äôs same. 

No. clearly explained above. happened Edward Snowden. Clear consensus said us solid telling us govt surveillance, yet majority corporate media agree prosecuted ‚Äútraitor‚Äù. Let ask you, believe Snowden prosecuted whistleblower?

This Red Herring.

 (And obvious answer anyways agree brought like serious privacy abuses also simultaneously advanced cause American adversaries wish destroy United States). ‚ÄúInfluenza offers much post infection immunity coronavirus‚Äù

That absolutely wrong mention they‚Äôre two separate viruses behave differently. Influenza mutates year, need different vaccine year, mention good year it‚Äôs 60% effective. Coronaviruses mutate much slower mutations we‚Äôve seen far won‚Äôt effect vaccine since don‚Äôt know efficacy percentage yet, solid contention last months year, bold move unless you‚Äôre part independent review panel release results every week sure. That's large part article about: decreased access condoms HIV medications need protect due pandemic. Two tests SF...same day times. Carbon üëå Would guess well.

I got sucked comments narrative within Germany often ""Our healthcare system downsized much close ruins"", surprised Sweden boasted something seems even relation population size spectacular compared Germany's ""run-down health care""

My comments/questions quest missed important point, ""Look Germany good well"". Uh? Official sources say 87K added yesterday. 
Also article provides two figures - 93k 96k.
Pick one. still seem match official sources. bit Bill Gates isn‚Äôt quite think is.

Oh, government workers see wearing mask home, thrown gulag. /s Confirm possibility two different things scientific world. acknowledged possibility July, confirm it.

No becoming available. clinic got [sofia last week rural middle nowhere. costs us something like $25 test. already machines flu tests one them. got 200 like unlimited tests though

Takes 15 minutes. Nooooooo. Really? /s political rallies.  Seriously lol headline u read wrote ? Oh, people falsely positive outlook well!  ""Veracity""?  I'm thinking that's REALLY wrong word. 
Anyway, question is, relatives friends think reality pandemic NOW?  dead, thoughts. probably influenced many others thinking exaggerated (that's polite), changed minds? returning residents, staying residents. Certainly Big Island. Yet Big Ten testing every one football players every day play football. Shows priorities lie... know probably read article, number tests processed one day?

So could've processed weeks' worth tests once... somehow. DK it‚Äôs 24-48 hours  course they're different ""strains""(not strains really- clades read comment), early infections would mostly Clade L Clade S. Clade G GR dominant.

But different strains impact antibody response, we're seeing reinfections simply immune systems perfect. Hit nail head. 360 Million: 330 Days correct Austria government dropped ball big time, restrictions. Since last week masks every business indoors (not maybe). also limits gatherings place (10 indoors, 100 outdoors).

However, church funerals excluded limits, well schools, offices... yeah, going improve much way.

By way, government announced next March proper regulation work home. Ehrm... maybe even need then...  you? People like Gates need start calling POTUS directly... reach 360 Million?? Maybe test them, big shot religious ceremonies! Ok source anything said actually different strains. 

They different clades sub-clades strain SARS-COV-2. producing different stable strains would truly disaster vaccination. However that, actually pretty stable. 

The different mutations pretty similar, important Clade mutated Clade G (main Euro strain). became contagious optimizing ability bind ACE2 receptors. Since created Clade GR (main one US, G variants) Clade GS. G variants pretty similar genetically. 

Its people getting infected different strains (they getting infected different clades, that's given) due immune one other. Immunity gained give undetermined level immunity clades there, they're similar genetics. seeing reinfections immune systems perfect, people even antibody response (over 90% do). lot research points tcell memory likely making reinfection unlikely also likely preventing severe disease reinfected, going 100% definitely infected multiple times, common yet seen. assume immune systems exposed virus get better preventing infections disease progression. let reinfection stories make fear immune systems useless virus. That's case all, never question reinfections level would occur again. learned anything SARS-1, genetic relative, novel coronaviruses induce long term immunity level. SARS-1 patients still immune response 17 years later.  *Why long face, madam?* might poor wording part - meant things like national housing registry central registration people (including healthcare). Also policy even rolled national level due size country. That‚Äôs big advantage Scandinavia places. That's works lol Yeah understand. saying person learning necessary careers preferred majority social people know. far connected online sitting outside another family last week. One kids suddenly says, ""I cold, guess get second one"" fighting sister. mom explains us got cold younger sister. go school can't handle mask (has legitimate medical issue makes pass want one kid class without mask). mom brags little sister mask exempt apparently anyone 5 legally required wear mask that's got cold school. Problem everyone assumes everything either cold flu I've already run business lost entire crew one worker claimed flu insisted working. wasn't. say real number x100 times dans une banlieue de Paris (mais c'est pas une banlieue, si tu comprends), et c'est assez vite ici.

Quelle banlieue ? Car moi je suis √† Clamart et les testes sont assez Americans never another country, bit tough fault imaging foreign countries either Ethiopia circa 1985 San Francisco circa 2350. tough though.

Yep literally, radical anti-americans pro-americans likely never even left country. right No, creates distrust saying things signs then, pandemic, suggesting ""it'll fine!"" correct approach would caution. then, 3 months line go ""hey remember thing said true?"".

Caution mixed message, flip flopping is. restarted US. hasnt single day it? Manitoba... close beating it.

They one active case total 6 7 deaths removed 14 day quarantine requirement Covid spread, fast. places got covid control wait observe. US comfortable situation since every day without vaccine bad news there. Ya reckon? am. people complaining masks able throw house parties giant weddings bc ‚Äòmuh freedom‚Äô. don‚Äôt realize want freedom choices anyone else‚Äôs. 

I huge argument friend. think (and every high risk person) lock life goes on. Apparently I‚Äôm supposed break lease (or stop paying take credit hit!!) move 5 bedroom appt (I live students they‚Äôre going want party right?!?) use CERB equivalent (that doesn‚Äôt exist yet, don‚Äôt worry bc government pay self isolate) live 1 bedroom appt (that‚Äôll cost $1500 $2000) want able house parties. 

Like wtf. Wouldn‚Äôt easier wore masks held house parties year? one knows, it‚Äôs based assumption somewhat effective vaccine could better worse.


I think agreed even vaccine ain‚Äôt immediate fix. Probably beginning end though.  I'm reading comments (as well title) - Oxford vaccine halted *again*? 
I know halted weeks ago - far know - 'restarted' week later... Yeah fatigue definitely biggest symptom noticed. nausea fun either lasted 5 minutes it. Maybe got real vaccine. seem idea vaccine. didn‚Äôt. America bad!!!!! üòµ used pack emercen-c hand sanitizer stuff going conventions helped tremendously. yeah, feel like masks going hopefully become norm United States like countries.

I'm ""essential"" restaurant cook working unmasked coworkers unmasked public, single test. health insurance pays one covid test per lifetime, regardless doctors' orders. Since covid tests mandatory hospital admittance, I'm saving mine case accident happens. fair, think kind people see reddit shit small minority disturbed human beings. Go ask normal person street country would think something like get positive responses. matter (the numbers is),many states undereporting anyways. Also 25% world's CO2 pollution. fly safely take precautions willing pay it. $0.50 mask enough. read article ? It‚Äôs , second paragraph . Ehhh like every country's friends paid taxes...  Remember two weeks? Lol. start knew full shit, predict people would compliant long. know nail salon owners Vietnamese, right? posted nothing article? total lockdown full idiot mode arent options know- enforcing masks strict distancing using high level descipline police coperation closing social event gathering related job work would ended disaster 5 months.

what we're right complete sloppy enforcement many people gathering reason industries work home still enforcing office attendance- police simply forgot going outside mingle strictly literally dying starvation , unemployment depression.

this happens enforce full lockdown without arrangements - like first month. utter mismanaged disaster.

we clear examples China, US, SPAIN, FRANCE lear methods worked come something decent. shit governments(both state Maharashtra center) chose worst choices screwed us all. Philippines snowfall sudden, houses would collapse due weight snow (particularly houses aren‚Äôt sturdy), people die slowly hypothermia, roads would impassable, famine would occur, animal species like Philippine Eagle would extinct. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

My estimates permanent snow line altitude Manila 18,500 feet (no natural artificial structure yet reached altitude). Yup. South Korea clearly exception (in good way). also much authoritarian western countries tolerably unlike China. I'm totally fine people pointing SK shining example. China. Blech. person sometimes dreams restaurant actually plane? understand tests processed many people collecting testing? really *that* touch? Vaccines nationalist competition. UK entered discussion. countries regions eradicated virus going full stream ahead next year, rest us lurching partial lockdown heavy restrictions whilst cowering homes counting dead.

*Laughing swedish*  One good things pandemic actually met boyfriend it. met online, usually hate options. may met otherwise. first date first day lockdown officially started lift country. We‚Äôve together ever since. definitely still date. silly thing though, one day mentioned friend date day she‚Äôs like ‚Äúhope stayed six feet apart!‚Äù

I mean...really...? Rich people get results 15 minutes family needs quarantine two weeks await test results. 

Sure bud. US never going extreme lockdown. Took 15 minutes. know, deaths doesnt happen instantly.... takes time initial hit spread. issue, could lockdown...

Deaths lag behind cases, I'm talking spike cases, deaths. talking 3.5 month delay February spike late May. That's valid thousand deaths less one year, one could assume higher deathtoll next year...

Yeah, sorry, intentionally obtuse? benchmark excess deaths 2020 would 91.7k figure, comparing directly 2019 would put excess deaths much higher (91.7k-89k) + going lockdown hurtig economy, UK dropped 20% Q2, lockdown.

That's decisive it? properly implement mask mandates social distancing guidelines along fact population might compliant?

It's almost though actually exists direct correlation economy country handles does, Finland obviously outlier. Otherwise look nation lockdown clearly see lockdown hurt economy

Okay, explain countries like South Korea, Hong Kong even people can't work... can't make/sell stuff can't earn money... saying UK, italy spain made fine? didnt....

Most people work home, countries did. manufacturing agricultural industries largely exempt lockdown. domestic service retail sectors always going affected due travel restrictions globally, lockdown otherwise.

Do actually know lockdown Sweden obvious counted test large extent....

Let's set record straight: testing wide scale **has always** resulted cases/deaths complain make statments xD Sweden havent adjusted numbers. Seems bone pick Sweden? Swede hurt before?

'""It's nothing strange. recently carried quality control numbers saw three deaths counted. Covid-19 long ago cause death,"" Theresa Granqvist, press officer Region Dalarna, told literally news? They're already conducting QC numbers, narrative numbers inaccurate speaks lack trust saying 1-2 years situation stabilized even support im saying throw stones make idiotic statments pandemic everyone done adjustments facts in...

Who's throwing stones? Again, lack ability comprehend said? making completely uninformed idiotic statement 15% figure. Clearly government counts 70% COVID deaths even co-morbidities involved, know, thing EVERY country does.

**Remember accused lying**. can't back accusation up? can't, damn well apologizing telling people can't work hurtig economy?... loopy world live in.

Who's saying that? core, Q2 GDP reports show lockdown hurts economy anymore explosion cases like Sweden's. actual data contradict Sweden didnt option lockdown... lockdowns obviously work, question effective really are...

The question also effective lockdown is, mean, free whatever want Sweden statment free seems odd...

Are uninformed? Finland basically restrictions. NZ actually looser restrictions - they've mostly level 1/2 alerts past 4.5 months means either restrictions group sizes level 1 group size limit 100 level 2. NZ also announced country returning level 1 today. What's group size limit Sweden didnt option. Unless goverment would made coup rewritten constitution... ignoring fact.

Oh stop argument. one's saying otherwise. justification change reality lockdown consequences followed either. Countries like SK seem fine. China's fault countries issues are? per capita basis objectively worse countries. first thought, too. going say, ‚ÄúIt hard,‚Äù ... thought 5 min rapid test? Didnt president brag weeks ago? RemindMe! 21 days Three days me. Oh look, anecdotal examples fun. Anyone says word BS mainstream media narrative gets voted down. I've never seen many shills one place one time. Plenty doctors coming saying scam 'warzone' hospitals almost empty 8 months.  Thanks global warming, probably never ever happen. sure lockdowns anymore? shutdown near Beijing shorter Wuhan learned isolate test fast, heard outbreak isolation longer used. 

Have got link example? 25% get infected. be. even 30% gets vaccinated virus struggle infect people. Besides 3% infected get severe case. point statistic problem get Oh many Swedes died? 1/200? Huh. Ugh dealt period isolation college due mental health issues traumatic me. became suicidal. Lockdown HORRIBLE it. many flashbacks. vented Reddit much hated lockdown bullied terribly called selfish whiny. Fucking pricks.

You think like lockdown sit ass play video games day? obviously never isolated. It‚Äôs horrendous thing go fact you‚Äôre trying force people disgusting.  Rb 8. key takeaway: Exposed, *infected*. anything article seems suggest traveling airplane carries quite low risk infection. Took 24 hours Boston. weekend - tested Saturday results Sunday. Same. currently Taiwan, news Covid first broke late December/early Jan, people around me, wife coworkers included, nervous, saying pray another SARs. wife dragged pharmacy got boxes masks also stocked frozen food (Wuhan already lockdown believe).

Point is, Asia took EARLY precaution memory SARS still fresh mind (less two decades ago), thankfully Taiwan one places Earth 'covid-free' (as today, 500 confirmed cases 7 deaths) life pretty much normal people still cautious. 

Hope beat thing. American, Covid test last week - also results went home. Fair point, missed statement assuming everything read getting tested right. Looking back mostly getting results faster others, regular testing. Moderna‚Äôs CEO said days ago general public won‚Äôt get middle next year. John Hopkins numbers, infections: 6,794,499 , deaths: 199,469 giving us 2.93%

You're confusing Case Fatality Ratio Infection Fatality Ratio. [Here's write help distinguish two. Experienced first hand. son got tested Monday didn‚Äôt get results Friday. even called 5 times 3 days went try get status. Mind boggling. son 3 couldn‚Äôt family around help childcare (we‚Äôre fortunate family that). couldn‚Äôt go office work. week absolute mess us played safe got results. people won‚Äôt that.

We'll get this. batch doses would emergency use authorization, meaning go at-risk groups health care workers. That‚Äôs condition authorization. Jeez  updated back early spring.. Almost death counts countries period time. US particular days deaths counted occurred 2 months prior would 2+ weeks prior.

It takes time register death get reported coroner's office. entire state little bit population county like 3 times daily cases. enragement = engagement! gotta get ad views! want anyone else experience either I'm glad lose fight Covid think learned helplessness parts. 

My best friend hospital internist. sent email back March warning friends family COVID-19 much dangerous flu, avoid getting costs. 

As we've learned ""long-hauler"" syndrome, advice looked better better. Avoid getting this, people left permanent organ damage. still know bad be, -- know asymptomatic patients still left heart, lung, neurological damage. 

These people advocating herd immunity... that's fatalism, nihilism, giving up. scary see people health care field. friend says he's flying planes there's vaccine people received it. March said disease going re-boot society, U.S., we're simply willing change. He's become disillusioned response U.S., he's decided emigrate Canada. Maybe that's arguably healthier way respond poor response U.S.: instead accepting infection inevitable, flee country actually believes *following science-based measures* -- like widespread masking.

You're right avoid this, making sure kid avoids it. proud 12 year said wanted remote schooling year: ""I'm going back in-person school safe."" Turns ""advise"" people crazy stuff, anyway punishing adherent people without actually effectively stopping exponential spread virus.  Bloody hell. test ordered ASAP fever 103 MS. Got results less 24 hours later still eternally grateful for. Longest day life. can‚Äôt imagine folks waiting days results. agonizing knowing whether you‚Äôre walking ticking time bomb. Yes, commenter showed proof. Many friends got aside asymptomatics one symptoms fever. Please go get tested, health important work work hospitality could devastating covid keep working. think I'm scientific, sure, may believe makes feel better.

Well, least agree something...  Oh friend lives wonderland! true real world... know plenty people throw Halloween parties. Probably going Thanksgiving Christmas family mostly outdoors (socal) wearing masks. That's fair. I'm torn level difference really would made. initial wave would obviously culled proactive actions taken earlier, even actions going long haul. think people's patience/diligence would run either way. know many sane people going like nothing happened, think common theme regardless ideology. good deal people wired follow rules long (people trouble disciplined eating habits, saving habits, etc., kind issue). think that's limited country either. actually get vaccine early actions critical hindsight bought time get vaccine, stuff happens vaccines delayed (or botched deployment), may hit threshold people give altogether rules (which might simply driven economic necessity businesses, family, etc). Idk, hard situation around. gotta part family point tune rest. Could get source numbers? apparently regularly tested, according article. ‚ÄúHayes Twitter said though mask-wearing, social distancing cleaning precautions taken House Representatives, members Congress regularly tested COVID-19.‚Äù Might've taken longer desired US routinely towards top per capita since April getting higher. don‚Äôt know reached conclusion all. Let try explain thick thick skull. 



Discussion responses pandemic. Better response comparisons come out. reply left field completely unrelated subject comes try belittle alternative response went well, like competition. Disgustingly saying woman better dead rather living Saudi. Left field. subject lowering young infections elders don‚Äôt get hurt. ‚Äúok, right response they‚Äôre still shit this‚Äù what? Saudi CDC isn‚Äôt ones control activism. Moreover, competition wasn‚Äôt aware of, starts listing good deeds like cornered mouse pleading approval. didn‚Äôt trigger anything related speaks volumes coming subject. come along continue topic attacks.

It‚Äôs two disgusting fools thousands others like make us vs. competition side playing. honestly think they're business encouraging people stay home mask up?  even about, false stat aside? trial well waiting second jab. However, it‚Äôs double blind trial don‚Äôt know placebo real deal. Maybe social distance bet continue wear masks like fashion accessory. demand testing insanely high. $100 million behind Biden innthe Midwest swing states Bilbo would emergency use authorization. at-risk groups health care workers. 

I understand skepticism, whole point ready early limited data trials give general population. 

It‚Äôs two dose vaccine, means 50 million people around world. That‚Äôs lot people per country. 

Distribution general population wouldn‚Äôt middle next year, presumably regulatory approval country. 

And big ifs. There‚Äôs place MN got results us within two hours. NBA every day  Would love link also. Flying Thanksgiving  Okay thanks. mask wear? vaccine guarantee 100% immunity. perfect shields individual level. really excel population level. 

Say got hypothetical disease R0 4, words infected individual infects average 4 new individuals. undertake precautions like masks, distancing, etc, lower R0 2. disease still spreading population, much slower. lets say invent vaccine decreases individuals risk contracting disease post-exposure 75%. give much confidence individual. 25% chance fail make great mechanism personal protection. vaccinate entire population (and good luck that), continue distancing, R0 falls 0.5. average, 1 2 infected individuals go infect somebody new. prevalence disease population steadily drop. while, everybody safely go back normal, they're totally immune virus, odds exposure much lower. 

However, relax distancing practices soon vaccine rolled out, R0 falls 1, prevalence disease holds steady, neither rising falling. odds exposure virus day vaccinate 3 months later. Instead reasonably certain encountering virus all, hope fall 75% instances vaccine prevents infection, 25% doesn't.

Obviously situation practice gets much complicated reality. that's grossly simplified version. want everything get R0 small possible, disease falls population fast possible. incubation period 2-14 days. pretty much 0% chance would already showing symptoms got infected today. Even less Seattle lol  Canada, email. think it‚Äôs perception general public one sat said: ‚Äòthis is, won‚Äôt be‚Äô trump wants present it‚Äôs ignore facts lot ‚Äúhome teams‚Äù owned outside foreign interests give 2 fucks host countries citizens doing.

I'm sick people treating virus like big deal. measures used covid (mask wearing, social distancing, hygiene ) helping flu well pay attention enforce it. Germany example restrictions overruled courts infringe human rights. Sure limit certain things dining outside, maximum amount people building X etc. total lockdown would

B: Cause massive economic disruption

So no, cant extreme lockdown rather learn live virus effectively limit spread. people also acting like virus nothing gouvernment wants ""control people"" (which hilarious gov everything save economy rather slow epidemic). think appreciate [how Brazil is. [Some near equator isn't.

Combine things see milder flu season. world going convince people wear masks years vaccines can‚Äôt seem convince people already mask wearing socially distancing? I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs pipe dream.

Yeah. view risk binary thing think long somebody accepts one risk accept risks.

I assume driven ridden car before, right? Cool. alright casual Russian Roulette later? that, winners get blasted local methhead's bathtub moonshine free-climbing quarry. 

There's unspoken risk vs reward calculation goes everything do. Automobile accidents accounted 1.5% deaths 2017, lets say choose drive, acknowledge 1.5% chance experience fatal crash point future. That's risk. reward able work home walk. transport far carry back. visit people miles house. easily travel cities schedule. people drive would able live life stop. Compare fully opening movie theater 225 people environment even 1% population infected potentially deadly virus. reward 225 people get see movie, movie theater makes little money. risk roughly 90% chance one audience members infected, single movie showing sets cluster infections. 

And even accept risks daily lives, take precautions. cars, seatbelts, airbags, crumple zones, myriad traffic laws. skydiving sorts steps need take they'll ever let jump without instructor, even got pads, helmet, reserve chute. beach lifeguards, parks rangers, keep people away there's much dangerous wildlife around.

Just governments pushed us take stupid risks like opening restaurants half capacity areas mean medical professionals (who unlike politicians understand medicine listen experts actually concerned health others) also accepting stupid risks too.

From perspective healthcare workers, 100% logical limit number people infect mothers/babies/patients hospital. ideal *anyone* know restrictions annoying, absolutely security theater ""being performative"". pure math.

I usually beat past decisions, try reflect things done different/better future. people saying September, would listened them? director CDC says we're tough winter ahead. helps krogers amazing insurance full time covers yr family buddy ended hospital bill close 250k got pneumonia paid 2k. also covers ur family well.  20m medium sized city texas  got halos protruding ring syndrome also coordinated federal policy paid leave someone waiting test, test positive.

So people choose responsible community members keeping fed two week wait results come back, positive, however long get negative test.

I honestly hoped pandemic would change things like paid sick leave, no. Add pile massive failures.  think lot. also wonder many people test negative never consider getting another test, due first test negative. Oh never timeframe. said ‚Äúonce vaccinated.‚Äù goal, however long took. whole pandemic big slippery slope Err, countries done MUCH better job testing, scale speed response.

The indicator positivity rate. good job need 1% consistently. Yeah, people cite China ‚Äúgood‚Äù example dealt it. baffles me. would take America Sweden‚Äôs approach China heartbeat. Authoritarian regimes let‚Äôs say, nice respecting individuals rights difficult situation. Problems exist much little. try long time respond pandemic difficult democracy. 

I many Indian friends family members die Covid easy suggest ignoring virus. actually live part country wear fucking masks part blame Depends live, suppose. took one Tuesday morning, got results Wednesday afternoon. maybe two months ago.   Well ask democrat governor advice. 46% covid deaths linked facilities FACT sent SICK patients there. GOOD JOB DEMOCRATS.  North Dakotan here. things worth noting per capita covid cases obviously rising like crazy given low population. Luckily, state dramatically increased testing % positive climbed drastically rise cases (Testing one strong points fight COVID state). also mask mandates place ones chains put place. current hotspots Cass County (Fargo) Burleigh/Morton Counties (Bismarck). biggest concern state Stark County population low per capita case count absurdly high. unclear primary source transmission, according state primarily family gatherings. note, Grand Forks County previously top 20 hottest counties country, seem drastically gotten cases control given excellent testing regime coordination University North Dakota, luckily fire here. easily 10x confirmed amount It‚Äôs right protest. don‚Äôt think vaccine ever make shelves US, it‚Äôs tainted seem ‚Äúsafer‚Äù options way. Wonder Trump ask refund. I'm arachnaphobe, exaggerating bit haha. get huntsman spiders parts Florida though, get gigantic. vouch that. customer service pure gold.  
Two stories: 
1) arrived late airport missed check flight Tokyo France. Costs ton money devastated. staff manager put next flight next day FREE. 
2) Another time, connecting flight France Germany going Tokyo. Germany Tokyo flight ANA. enough time get luggage back check ANA flight. called explained situation. accepted take luggage France Germany flight redirect directly ANA flight. usually done automatically different airline. want ask. 15 min, 30min kits? guess that‚Äôs many people jail wearing mask lol /s went rapid test site got mine 30 minutes, said.. here‚Äôs hoping accuracy, claimed negative. Sweden‚Äôs approach successful? hospitals never overwhelmed [didn‚Äôt screw hard many countries locked down. Age SMH part Nine, anything even lockstep LNP Rupert. Seriously strong links Nine LNP. Yes. know whether rate growth representative trend stay. could change doubling 7 days doubling 3 days already next week, that's I'm saying. I'm trying say ""lol scaremongering"". Right, get warnings ""FLU SEASON BAD BEWARE!"". We're everything hinders flu spreading! hope got group photo keep crossing family members of. Maybe hang mantle reminder big mistake marriage was. Well Boris UK version Trump. Freaken idiots.  fair. different opinion economic matters think different situations arguing either side would reach conclusion. appreciate input you. can‚Äôt possibly argue pausing trial justified whilst also arguing vaccine potentially unsafe. knew vaccine definitely safe, pausing trial would wrong. new type vaccine may safety issues cannot anticipate. one *knows* safe. managed type lot words without answering question. Sao Paulo .. 12M people located -24deg latitude (that's even closer equator Miami) largest city BR. second biggest city Rio (6M) even closer equator (-22deg). 

most Brazilians live closer equator Sao Paulo: - think missed second point made temp SP close Miami. Wait, socialist medicine save you? led believe socialized medicine best thing ever! Teachers figure coming vaccine probably sugar water . 

We still don‚Äôt know shit apparently It‚Äôs something take note on, falls ‚Äúwould rather pretend issue, look issue kill people?‚Äù rather investigate issue immediately. always science

This nothing science. far back late Jan, early Feb, reddit threads posted pictures doors first US patients US hospitals explicitly warning medical staff appropriate PPE level due airborne transmission.

That confirmation talking about, too, ""news."" issue politicized, we're finding new things know early on. fact, every new ""discovery"" virus already detailed multiple scientific articles within month becoming pandemic. problem scientists know--it's scientists knew Chinese many people wanted ignore findings. Here's latest case/death charts LA, running 7-day currently 62.84 deaths per 100k population, slightly US per capita average.   need sort PCR tests brings lots false positives. test false positives are. current testing capacity around 240k believe want get 500k day end October. I'm sure ill get downvoted saying testing joke. Ok even true, also used slaves women vote. always follow path set us past? I'm guessing also diversity, obesity, hypertension, comorbidities. 

Look countries actually nationwide lockdown numbers low. death rates way ours. 

I think see US worse Sweden win Sweden, really loss US. administration screwed pooch hard one. mean Sweden's approach successful. exactly kill may ask? Wait, airborne tablets put water drink get sick long? CDC instructions unclear Conclusions

In summary, children age may infected SARS-CoV-2, reduced frequency severity compared adults, although clear epidemiologic data still missing. addition, recently identified MIS may pose additional threat. Data outcome antiviral treatments, safety immunogenicity vaccinations, better specification high-risk patients pediatric population still needed. pandemic continues evolve, still hard fully assess forecast mid- long-term effects resulting significant changes society, economics, human behavior future child health well-being. important medical social efforts focusing pediatric population undertaken protect children world allowing fulfill enormous potential. forgot Bill Gates Virologist *forbidden* chocolate month half people work Well, Norway so, managed keep track isolate infected could damage. strategy also successfully adopted several countries SE Asia, works long number infected walking around inside country.

Okay, saying lockdown saved Norway Finland thousands deaths, strategies mentioned, Sweden failed adopt enact effectively. point is: Swedish approach model followed ""long term strategy"" worked working out. anything, Norwegian approach used model - again, long number infected inside borders limited. Britain island, helped mandatory masking? harm would cause? Full 2nd wave Europe rn Bill Gates quit trying part lives go away money.  it? ""Those people"" going almost everyone BTW.  friend went go get test filled paper work waited hours never got tested left received letter mail saying positive. many movies games built CDC epicenter knowledge savior

In reality CDC useless slow moving sloth political echo chamber. Thanks update airborne transmission knew half year ago, CDC Wisdom cudgel beat humane decision making process. Never anything overthink it. Guide moral scientific, nothing else. Flatten curve Covid homelessness, SF! Opinion pieces degenerated much. used like, agreed facts, afterwards could different opinions based them. could disagree sets facts important fact discussed.

And opinion mostly expected rational, like chain thoughts. ""My opinion revolution country X happen like Z happened"". worth reading them, even agree.

Now opinion clueless person rambling. Full stuff wrong ""should checked wikipedia voiced opinion."" Sometimes see really weird claims them, like ""whoa crazy true!"", check turns nonsense. basically getting trolled. Gandalf? worked Australian states territories initially.

Then state Victoria only, crack quarantine one hotel infected staff security working quarantine (may 3, sure) caused community spread got loose contained initially, hence lockdown.

Sure happened extent Victoria incidents different states fortunately explode like this, know anywhere near enough comment relative merits state's successes failures avoidable not. üòÜ Yup, well! I'm actually even supposed clinical lab, necessary experience education, recruited ""some"" OT COVID. second full time job, lol.  people still getting upvoted gilded saying similar mortality rate seasonal influenza? absolutely not. Two hundred thousand dead US six months, summer, even lockdowns, seasonal influenza. death peak NYC, seeing death totals twenty times even peak influenza rates. damn plague anything let's pretend similar flu. Stupid article without much information analysis. Waste click... many cases effectively contact trace yes, two options lockdown uncontrolled spread. never large scale lockdown scale covid smallpox. Well that‚Äôs shitty. Thx, wondering guy getting downvoted saying completely clear virus reopening. Last time like 30 cases day enough cause second wave. ""claims"" mean ""scientifically proven reinfection"" power source chip?  blithering garbage stupid comment, around 6 months, people havent even once.

gotta love reddit. Great get kn95 masks. ( available $ 2.30 ) I'm curious, recent revelations Moderna Executives' questionable stock sales given concern participating, think big deal? known since around early March...... live US too. Schools still closed, businesses operate partial capacity, lot work still done online. Sweden didn‚Äôt things. still deaths per capita them. think you‚Äôre confusing CFR IFR. I‚Äôm pretty sure CFR consistently around 5% everywhere world. Ah, you‚Äôre right. Got 2 things mixed since Dutch newspaper posted well. journalist however *did* make come across new. America facilities available testing anywhere else world. infrastructure already existed. Places like Lab Corp Quest Diagnostics Alere already dozens labs set up, ready go. soon PCR test developed, validate start running. South Korea case load America has, testing would look like joke too. capacity issue. demand issue. Nah, go get virus like. America freedom. Eagle. havent even got lockdown despite new cases have. 

That tells everything need know state governments faith contact tracing ability. little soreness injection sight hours that, I‚Äôve felt normal. got flu shot 2 weeks started trial sore couple days that. 50000 big number. country from?

The 250 different strategies that's new. case changing ones mind order save lives seems entirely legit.

But basically said pretty much pretending didn't. made America great again? can‚Äôt tell... military used labour pool basically. powers arrest people use force. rightfully left police. 40% US population dumb incredibly selfish. 

At least 20% apathetic, disillusioned disinterested. 

The government reflection this. They're owned Nine chairman Peter Costello. They've descended tabloid trash well. No, look date article. September 9th. article dated one posted subreddit notice. live US. time national lockdown. Various states various restrictions. even biker convenient held attracted 460,000 people. That's lockdown. got mine like 12 hours Erm ... like already said already ... mask mandate isn‚Äôt working ...

You cannot enforce things well already.

Edit: also mandates come government ... government going need support people ... which, don‚Äôt think get. It‚Äôs simple X it? think depends 2nd wave looks like. it‚Äôs pretty bad, 2nd quarantine assured. it‚Äôs mostly like we‚Äôre going now, it‚Äôll probably continued restrictions without full lockdown bank issuing mortgages unemployed? Asking friend...  help states eliminated virus people looked acted even though safe there. everything that's happened I'm flabbergasted Biden still 6 7 point lead nationally. crazy. know math? TSA screens every single passenger bag weapons/explosives, although chances terrorist FAR less catching potentially deadly virus. Na cause don‚Äôt like either. Stop üêë. 
All asked got facts instead spitting bunch false statements hey, worst comes worst, still learn code /s happened first time? dont know get downvoted. sub doom gloom horrendous. clear whether ""reinfection"" caused symptoms less severe person simply tested positive again. caused less severe symptoms, congrats got effective cell immunity response, great! caused severe symptoms would slightly alarming although would mean reinfection rare occurence greater significance. Obviously, yes. could completely prevented it. countries slow react.

US day imposed 14 day quarantine international travelers. Lmao that's standard thing, whatever media site ya got info seriously exaggerated
Edit: send links article, curious it. also new? I‚Äôve seen many comments reddit people gonna keep wearing masks lets hide face. God let rest us aren‚Äôt horrendously insecure maladapted live normally vaccine sound like manipulated orange potato dreams dictater. think age ABC pretty good. still job hold politicians account let's honest fuck ups deserve criticism. would amazing hippie fly month ago lol. place DC area kinda guaranteed fast rests. thank overbearing FDA regulations, companies overworked kits, incompetent American government healthcare system that, Bill doesn‚Äôt make sense! thought like balloon...you know, travel 6 feet spontaneously combusts?  exactly happening Queensland. like includes countries large number cases come conclusion? Hope weak strawman. :D originally flattening curve majority governments, China seemed go hardcore weld people homes fun stuff like that; stance changed zero tolerance majority governments... wondering why.

 Oh way, logic stopping avoidable deaths, we'd always lockdown wearing masks etc. diseases besides COVID. hope turn shit like that... would nice people learn hygienic stay inside feeling sick, especially country. Worldometers  Imagine wedding anniversaries... ‚ÄúAnd remember eight (+) people died overly-public nuptials? Good times...‚Äù come it‚Äôs gonna get worse winter then? make mandatory, turn people like me, side, you.

Because look social unrest places like New Zealand, made mandatory.

NZ new cases 2 weeks masks arecoming now.

But Feeedembs. saw US handles protests ‚Äúcurfews.‚Äù Fed, state, local govs absolutely power shut business cut utilities, etc. enforce lockdown. really incompetence they're extremely good it? don‚Äôt know rather deal with: Australian outback bugs corona. Exactly people want Well country waiting time 2-3 days got test back like 14 hours paid $20 rest cause symptoms. Whole process took minutes

It would free symptoms. sane world we'd subsidize transportation there's enough capacity safely transport people keep things going. Sanity option apparently though. list outrageous shit America long never even test.. Australian states successful keeping numbers contact tracing reasonable rules. 

Doubt there's political (or money) another lockdown like Government refused implement lockdown, highest death rate northern Europe, far. Yes, guessing two things related. went get flu shot, guy giving shot said hes given shots ever year. That's misconception. understand level number testing limiting visibility true number cases, look percentage positive vs number tests. percent means sampling enough people get picture, percentage starts rise means population infected rising tighten distancing measures (masks, distance, allowed number people gatherings, etc.). Increasing testing point, cause testing increase number cases, simply decrease percentage positive truly want since may lured thinking infection ""receding"".

What Gates defines outrageous amount testing, rather time takes get answer. takes, difficult contain spread, especially people waiting results still going work shopping nothing happened. want people get tests.

This is, again, piece larger puzzle. Tests cost, lot, costs short term needs ""return"" justifies expenditure, matter pays it. strategy country may fail succeed. federal governments big problem, cause order central strategy need coordinated effort, U.S. clearly failing (and similar examples lack coordination visible elsewhere).

Considering R0, see several states (and countries general) hovering worryingly 1 that's indicator ineffective measures are, bad people abide measures.

So, problem testing more, problem fast, trace quickly, enforce measures. main issue downplaying going on, POTUS willing pass funding since supporting political agenda undermine propaganda statements like ""it magically disappear"".  places around NJ quickly it‚Äôs universal. Los Angeles I‚Äôve gotten three tests. cheek swab tests via city/county program self administered car ‚Äî 100% free me, appointments available day even though symptoms (I wanted sure). results within 20-26 hours time. didn‚Äôt realize much better areas :/ Well, Australia plenty flammable! Another point article CDC considers asymptomatic people capable spreading virus Reducing cases time allowed us understand virus better improve treatments may reduce deaths coronavirus. 

But ultimately countries locked returned normal merely delayed spread. 

For context also don‚Äôt believe testing Victoria actually captures current spread number cases. also faith state‚Äôs contact tracing team. confirm...she really wet article read bit wrongspeak. read curious. island desert

Keep mind vast majority people live 3 big urban cities coast, lots public transport use etc. vast desert parts uninhabited (for good reason lol) part Netherlands 24 hours. 48 72 hours. Also, nearest test locations available 2hr drive away. Yeah, car. Without car, locations available within next 3 days. seems place. I'm Seattle area know 3 dozen friends co-workers tested recently. One came back hour 24 hours. rest took 2-5 days. One step closer eradicating prolific, destructive insidious institution known entire history mankind. 

Fuck religion. Fuck religious. Please...all you... eradicate self you‚Äôre it. low probability equate ""it could **easily** coincidence."" possible, unlikely. Hence, expert opinion ""finding even one case among thousands trial participants could red flag"" ""if two cases, starts look like dangerous pattern"" ""if third case neurological disease pops vaccine group, vaccine may done.""

I mean, even rate something like 1/7500 much safer actual infection moderate high risk, choose AstraZeneca low risk. 'Cases' almost meaningless. 80% symptoms. 90%+ mild symptoms similar common cold. 'deaths' people died cause positive test, sometimes within month, sometimes point. Even virus contributing factor. numbers fear-mongering highest order. matter 'who died permanently damage direct result virus', case numbers would extremely low. go health department state read covid data eyes. even controversial idea year ago. Everyone implicitly acknowledged certain level acceptable death everyday life. *At least* five. Maybe 5.1 Hey, feel bad it. crisis expose cracks systems. can't beat cracks missed past, definitely address appeared anyway can. speed tests. 24 hours great, social safety net employer responsibility provide PTO fucking pandemic, matter tests take 24 hours 2 weeks. People can't afford take time off, employer/state/country/ SUCKING allowing take time off. 

It's cultural ""if pretend exist, doesn't"" issue. Australia, government actually helped that. someone working needs get test, get handout government cover lost working time get test results back, test positive give us another larger handout cover us 14d work
Edit: first payment usually bit low getting test results back 24h 90% cases share math figure? exceptions

I would say actually lot exceptions governments around world done much better testing -- agree US sucks.

Thailand fantastic one lowest infection rates death rates world. never said anything policy decisions herd immunity, calm down. Flattening curve lengthens time curve. may best thing there‚Äôs vaccine, following rules bring faster end epidemic. I‚Äôve got bad news , things aren‚Äôt going get better , 27 Trillion dollars national debt .  insane (stupid) part country one ruling it

Yeah, people wear masks alone car, walking sidewalk, parking lot Common sense reason prevail anymore.

""Can't impose restrictions nursing homes strongly suggest elderly high-risk individuals quarantine herd immunity happens, since they're clearly at-risk, instead literally everybody?""

""NO""

I've saying gone since ""flatten curve hospitals"" became bullshit. need make assumptions, already clear. I'm trying get tell anyway. Regarding entertaining arguments, trying weasel admit favour SAs laws entertaining ME, fuck arguments haha testing capacity live Maybe. that‚Äôs weird conclusion draw. far higher body count. 


But guess watching loved ones drown fluids window traumatic generation. /s 


EVERYBODY: remember, *have* way, **Republicans** MADE way. don't. flu. Lots things changed since 2016. One view world spread limited sympathy.

I give family prayers atheist. idiot didn‚Äôt research. Stupid assumed airlines keeping us safe selling middle seats. That‚Äôs first thing going ask google reading headline. exponential growth general so....powerful. exponential growth represented illness death consuming thought agree  words, fucked winter US, majority 200,000 deaths climate *hostile* virus?

Wonderful. Smh shouldn‚Äôt hating home team. That‚Äôs right choice lot people don‚Äôt read article point less findings fact air travel SAFE. Yes, see findings study think misleads people thinking ‚Äúperson high risk,‚Äù absolutely go ahead planned vacation includes air travel. 

If everyone would slow think someone themselves, maybe could get handle virus. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Usually, whenever policy change, announced time ahead going effect. Dont get hung exact amount time, hypotetical scenario anyways. airline industry fraction infection flight crews flying every day. makes sense! Correct   source thought I‚Äôd share personal experience. husband (a dissertation defense away epi) approved fly, daughters. sanitized seats sat (airport airplane), sat back row window, heavy handed sanitizer. HEPA filters make air cleaner shared transportation, Southwest flights weren‚Äôt full all- 2 legs row front without people. don‚Äôt trust kiddos aware would sanitizing accidental touch. drove summer grandma, flew home, flew back, drove back home. Unrelated serious stuff? Nah.

The rare disorder several people? could lead vaccine considered safe enough compared alternatives. history medicine, often seen rushed politically motivated decisions lead unnecessary harm. Vioxx, thalidomide, Tuskegee syphilis study, hormone replacement therapy, etc recent examples modern medicine failing protect public. could make high performance masks bodybuilders, sell markup. outdoor dining kinda nice actually. Four days last test, Vermont. Yeah, basically. got show colors, point.

I still find strange find strange people switch subjects come interjections open platform online. find even stranger realize words got list pandemic, literally told talk cheap top put snide remark cheap? So, first tell talk, action, call whore implying sells herself? call feminist? 

So, basically, inform people fact SA bans people 15 go outside. Well, coming country uses actual slaves, really piss ocean. mean come on, government recently man exile murdered horrible shit goes country. ban people 15 exactly bad, fact insulted someone wanting live country beheadings still common says her, even though think otherwise. Yeah, agreed 100%. retorting comment, adding 2 cents. 

Glad ageee ahole isüòÄ Oh yes! therefore give wealth mostly stock. would generous! mean UK also voted brexit, always glut idiots comment POST subreddit? I‚Äôll make 1,000+ accounts upvote post, gains visibility.  post article talking about?

Would love take look. Mr positive right  Yeah likely. 

Because hardly Australia, Argentina, Paraguay, Chile South Africa winter (which summer) etc anti covid stuff. 

Same thing happen Florida. Well Northern hemisphere such, includes Florida.

Edit: Lol getting minus here? crazy get minus mentioning hard facts. google ""flu Argentina 2020"" see plenty articles. And? mistakes learn. 

People misconception fail once, change opinion future everything else say forth INVALID.

Science would like say hello. Spoiler: _every_ government agency slow-moving sloth political echo chamber It‚Äôs much environmentally friendly uses much less resources everyone would driving Australia Murdochcracy, elections looking like [this](http://cf.broadsheet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MurdochpapersOz.jpg) hard Labor party, party currently power Victoria (where Melbourne is).

The lockdown measures imposed given Murdoch easy target, names ""Dictator Dan"", ""Chairman Dan"", consistently goading government open _second_ cases dropped few-dozens - knowing full well win/win them. Either gov't gives in, falls trap Vic blows - making whole thing failure, one hold he's ousted, _monumental_ waste human effort they'll never accountable for... get cheap shots forever claim ""it never necessary anyway, look, blow opened late"".

They're playing position bear risk, absent morals, see political gains.

... oh, white-anting. Termites, eating foundation within. keep nipping away, undermining glee structure falls. know termites actually hope see structures fall, Murdoch certainly does. mean, gave us Fox news all. ya mate ! percent coronavirus deaths urban vs rural? Deaths skew urban. Minority population skews urban fair comparison use overall population comparison point. 19 hour delay fetching comments.

This magnificent achievement, despite constant eroding Victorian State Leadership idiotic journalists still write unethical Rupert Murdoch press/newspapers.  Hmmm looking bit virusy today, better bring mask case starts virusing guidelines set people gave everyone half price meals dined out? Tge government caused mess. respect, going stay house another years/ decades even?

With respect, around decades, current state.

And answer question, wear masks go go socially distant walks. refuse go shops mask compliance dropping. get everything need online. incredibly high risk going let selfish assholes can't bothered mask infect me. People blaming officials late regulations: listen, official guidelines always lag behind science, statistics reddit rumors. Officials confirm something weighing available sources, proving certain way judgement right people behaviour. Bureaucracy always slow act.  Yep leadership Victoria acknowledged many failures, looking NSW (and NZ Queensland) fill gaps. Hopefully enough learnt get right (or least substantially better). Ah yes, course! People agree hard working, successful probably handsome. People don‚Äôt agree live mom‚Äôs basement haven‚Äôt seen sun since late February. scary/crazy thing people died attend wedding caught someone did. Here's latest case/death charts Kentucky, running 7-day currently 25.49 deaths per 100k population. ranks 35th among US states terms per capita Doesn‚Äôt really matter think though.... majority Victoria think it‚Äôs ok bounce back reopen. Lockdown isn‚Äôt answer. Yes can, understand clinical trials work. I've member Research Ethics Board major University. even know Research Ethics Board is?

Edit: also understand human body works, every health issue caused untrained person would assume.

I'm going bother trying explain everything learned 3 science degrees someone interest understanding scientific method I'm done here. fun making excuses anti-vax. Apparently Millinocket hard word reporter say... *‚ÄúThe neurological symptoms becoming scary‚Äù*

Welp Funny, Victoria also trouble using enough military hotel quarantine.... every state did. Damned do, damned don‚Äôt. don‚Äôt get it, took &lt;12 hours Tucson.  China island. I've tried looking death statistics year find it.

Can share source? Here's heatmap showing current 7-day per capita deaths another one, showing total per capita dont understand whole dining thing. What‚Äôs wrong neighbors... ask left house? wear mask bring sanitizer try keep away others. respect, going stay house another years/ decades even? waited 6 weeks results test early July. positive. did, flu florida winter right According UCLA Labor Center, nearly 3 4 nail salon workers California Vietnamese descent. 

Not all, 75%. would say makes discussions regarding ethnicity relevant. However, understand political commentary. Trump wanted open back up? Newsome kept closed? Trump's leadership lack thereof pandemic ongoing? irony speaking of? white-anting = undermining. 
 
grubs = immoral persons, dirty players. 
 
scribble = write. 
 
gutter press = sensationalist tabloid media. don‚Äôt think going around ok can‚Äôt stop it. school work COVID procedures, sure, there‚Äôs holes compromises big enough drive truck through. see, places ‚Äútrying‚Äù put together system depends level precision clearly happening testing way is. Oh well, didn‚Äôt really actual choice. either come back person give career love place enjoy working economic downturn private schools downsizing right I‚Äôm verge starting family. So, yea, I‚Äôm back. large swaths US states California Oregon apparently. happens open back up? case count increases going lockdown again? Better late never guess couple months late Sure fewer deaths covid maybe.

Perhaps worth also factoring economic health consequences society due impact lockdowns. 

But lockdowns reduce flu deaths too, maybe every year? chairman Peter Costello lol Eh. Read post again? France Spain Improved game then? Owned 9 whose CEO Peter Costello, treasurer John Howard weird. understand words individually, put together like that. üòâ ""Thats power Pine -Sol baby."" Damn love commercial. Well shit We‚Äôve *one* flu yes, *second* flu? American, envious almost every country right now. cloud Covid continues hang country economy.

Congrats Victoria Australia success battling Coronavirus. people adamant dragging pandemic long possible? Yeah, norm here, people nuts anti vaxxers anti maskers, country worshippers, downvote anything might negative country worship. personally feel judge them, issue might psychological cannot control, never debate them. Well definitely stop creating pollution high rate. Unfortunately pollution ubiquitous point, hard deal with, really sound comparison covid. wanna go there, let's go there.

100k people die year illnesses related air pollution US.

200k people died covid 6 months US.

Both bad. One accute other. think death count covid would less without paltry pandemic restrictions have?

Look, get unhappy. college one innovative colleges north east (I hope co-ops go fantastic, btw). time shapes view next 10 years least instead getting enjoy young adult, taken might feel like good reason. 

But pretty good reasons restrictions. hope you, friends, family stay healthy safe. hope gets better get take full advantage college experience. 

But right now, think there's pretty good data tell us could way worse without mitigation efforts still many unknowns virus.

I know I'm going convince you, rather smug asshole you, want say hear least want try understand perspective. Exactly! mean he's got money, help world? He's one though, lot good stuff, believe right ideas. K&amp;N95's

Seriously K&amp;N could make killing, I'll take royalty check now. I'm saying that, PCR tests pick dead fragments virus stay system many months virus infectious even still live. 

In opinion, UK locked late begin we've seen slight rise cases (this seasonal coming autumn respiratory season virulent then). 

On question, difficult anyway testing swab (pcr) tests. view look data caution see hospitalizations rising exponentially context rising similarly flu seasons current time. sustainable. never get 0 cases permanently. lockdown gets close, open up, cases rise. Lock again, etc. studies showing [the airborne varying degrees depending conditions present. link proves point insufficient evidence caused vaccine late always. That‚Äôs said first time I‚Äôd take .1 percent chance ventilator educationally economically disadvantaged lockdowns rest life. worked WAY better (Australia) thought possible. 

Initially plan ‚Äòflatten curve‚Äô keep infections manageable level health care. 

But attempting number states Australia (somewhat unintentionally) eliminated virus. WA, SA, TAS NT COVID free months strict border place 14 days quarantine arrivals states. 

NSW outbreaks bought control (we 1 local case today) QLD (but even fewer outbreaks). 

It‚Äôs VIC heavily hit following second wave well way eliminating it. 

Elimination wasn‚Äôt goal originally. it‚Äôs become we‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs possible. Waited 4 days Virginia result last month rediculous Ah see get go ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs people following social distancing!‚Äù

It‚Äôs win win them, excuses already lined up. seen, reason r/movies strongest lockdown push. Everytime thread movies opening theaters lot comments affect of, ""I really want see movie, would rather die"". amount hyperbole fear mongering statement ridiculous. Here's latest case/death charts California Florida, running 7-day terms per capita deaths, Florida way ahead. There's still 600+ active cases, would crazy end lockdown early based new daily cases alone. you‚Äôre scared, stay home don‚Äôt go outside. Don‚Äôt expect anyone else same. Smh = Sydney morning herald shaking head. emails name@smh... Haha Crushing virus country island going one done thing crushed everywhere else well fully isolate rest world. people following guidelines brought upon us. Assholes. Meanwhile family left house since March except absolutely needed socially distant exercise. selfish ruining us always.

E: found anti mask, anti lockdown brigade. Fuck all. Get grip, sooner everyone works team sooner goes away. Daniel Andrews effective leader second wave happened 1st Look, American live Netherlands. local version CDC recommended masks. US politicized it. People believe health authorities less, least take cues them. health authorities take 7 f..ing months finally admit obvious big thing. day late 200K lives short. Gotta go download MSN install Netscape. Good let spread. Check local doctor. urgent cares around it. walk need appointment. Yep that's exactly point. 

Part problem relies human's. capacity morons stupid thing, also ability fuck things mistake. experiential growth starts slip away really really fast. That's OK, true proven exist God (who totally create virus despite creator Universe) surely protect getting infected. Nothing worry all! opening first sourced precise nationwide count number of¬†people collecting unemployment benefits¬†has hampered since start coronavirus pandemic. Data overwhelmed understaffed state offices inconsistent strewn errors. may double-counting agencies struggle clear flood new backlogged claims.

Also, speak towards bias online process. Comment America's broadband deficiencies among population would need assistant most.

Appreciate willingness conversation, comparison developed country's approaches America supposed leader tone setter. response cruel, inhumane objective failure. read emails saw obviously picked longer conversation, ie. taken much context. Nevermind discussing reach herd immunity, discussing epidemic large talk epidemics bound mention herd immunity way another. 

I get epidemiologists mentioning herd immunity conversation epidemic controversial. That's like reading emails bunch firefighters discussing forrest fire seeing mention part forrest already burnt can't put fire again, reaching conclussion obviously arsonists want burn entire forrest ground.  sadly no; critical infrastructure last like usual.

grocery clerks either. they're clumped second last phase like critical infrastructure folk.

stay home single people rated higher critical infrastructure disability/no income plan. smile cute :) Full social distancing 2 years insane.
