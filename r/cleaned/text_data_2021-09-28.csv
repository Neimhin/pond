0,2021-09-28," Yeah, shit, numb nuts. Exactly! look response Chinese oppression. guy sucks. Profits people.. hate Taliban? one way defund police lol Yeah sometimes things confusing face something new takes minutes sort what’s happening. Kind like confusion feel learn folks still scared right thing middle crisis. Initially (March 2020) Imperial College London modelling worst case scenario (with interventions vaccinations) 2.2million American deaths. Less talented players playing due vaccine restrictions means higher probability winning another ring probably. there’s risk. CDC established that. Refusal get vaccinated point socially irresponsible/selfish.  Saying masks don’t work biggest credibility punt time  You’re making lot complicated is. CDC uses legitimate scientific process recommendations evolved better understood virus. That’s good thing. It’s time stop dragging feet, stop looking excuses go get shot.  ""It important group selected representative population, biased systematic manner.""

From article I'm guessing seen ""leopard"" one. religions say can't vaccines? tiny percentage actually hold faced getting boot.    “Some people social media assholes”. cutting edge insights reveal us next ?   someone sub jump back forth feeling sorry idiots furious let get despite sane people trying desperately keep alive. Never hate. save hate politicans brainwashed first place. do, also learn statistics useful sample pool size considered. also learn statistics skewed. 

How take size 1500 apply millions. Science non biased neither statistics, either one biased based researchers financing personal biases come unconsciously.

I'm saying can't use stats, I'm saying one probably best creating unnecessary division need understanding unity. Triple, 2% would top 1%. Parents inoculating children actual live smallpox virus approximately 1% dead rate make later real infection less severe brave.

Benjamin Franklin deciding late inoculate son lose smallpox tragic.

The mRNA vaccines safe effective medical intervention. Yes they're serious taking aspirin, much.

People need start putting things perspective. Terry Pratchett's character Cohen Barbarian Discworld books line: brave scared, that's foolhardy. Always struck truly profound Oh it’s fear that’s stopping them, make mistake. It’s code Trump voters. ‘Do research’ means hunt around Internet find someone agrees you. agreement becomes proof right. Bullshit. wants get paid.   think science evolved. started understand virus better recommendations changed. makes sense find reassuring Imagine avoiding exploding chemical plants, gunfire, run coal rolling bro-dozers entire life die covid Bolsonaro doesn’t like hear bad news stubborn stupidity + serial ineptitude killing hundreds thousands people  Covid may yet impact it…   Aggressive compared countries. positivity rate still less 2%. Except there's enough research whether vaccinated people experience long covid. \*their 

Ahahahahahaha. mean, restaurant must serve fine cuisine guy risk going jail it, eh? I'm sure ""research"" NBA's memo unvaccinated protocol.   coddled way long. shoe foot, see compassion others right thing.....no didn't. don’t understand cats couldn’t quarantined trested negative? cows pigs (that empathetic intelligent cats dogs) killed *hundreds thousands day* United States? clear people actively causing others dead. saying social shaming bridge far punishing people actively engaged best negligent manslaughter? realize saying.I'm gonna pretend deaths sadden me, would encourage anyone shed tear.

I find distasteful mock death, even context. Using cautionary tale positive, tone posts usually vindictive I've seen, feels like bad taste. (Like said, two wrongs make right.) Yes, it’s interesting detail flu comparison group left Guardian article, it’s interesting part study IMO. Really puts “it’s like flu” protests bed. 

You really tell actually experience interpreting research thread vs. people don’t think do… Yes, mostly mild vaccine breakthrough cases.

The way things work it’s acceptable go work/school cold-like symptoms now. skip work/school, almost everyone needs get doctor’s note (called medical certificate). go doctor cold-like symptoms, swabbed Covid. test positive Covid, household members (and used close contacts) would legally forced get swabbed quarantine either home facility. whole system makes under-reporting less likely happen. mean, preferably science would guiding political progress. think kyrie got getting discussion KD interestingly, nobody scolding empathetic people attacking denigrating. Nobody saying look world point view Good them, well everyone else choice goes body. Especially heavily influenced major pharmaceutical companies. let them, world needs less idiots. Oh man, somebody finally googled got vaccine. Fresh change pace. infringes God given right spread disease ironically prolong public health restrictions freedom /s juggle balls living

And he's pretty good basketball too. needs centralized website basic facts public reviewed various scientists experts field they’re agreed upon becomes crime, least easy ban, post misinformation widely accepted reviewed facts. metrics matter hospitalisations/deaths.

Doesn't matter number cases rise, mild cases.  Really? Why? idea ""unknown unknowns"" everywhere. Many people overconfident know know. (I'm saying Rumsfeld right anything, particular quote dumb.)  Fucking excuses ignorant saying. Still fucking ignorance.  that's bullshit excuse. Funny part is, least planet, pope boss catholicism, recommended vaccines. So, catholicism people following? work silk screen shop, going old jobs right around people started go back normal printed shirts customer said ""im mask free beginning im still alive"" just...the absolute point stupidity people get ""tough"" face virus infuriating. Lol, person got upvoted… please try victim little harder guess…? reasonable. I'll honest sick tired judicial system deciding matters stupid ass ""culture war"" one side waging. know judiciary exists reason frustrated intervene matters constantly related ""culture war"" importantly always execute judgment reasonable manner, especially side instigating everything.   many vaccinated Winter 2021 still considered immunized 18 months later Summer 2022? point longer immunized? kind person laugh peoples' misfortune. HCA something delight watching. like watch reafirm indiscriminate violence nature. matter hard people believed, virus killed them. matter much privilege had, matter many people knew supporting them, amounts nothing end. 

I also frequent sub ask people choose suffer much. reminds humanity capable horrific things. 

And lastly reminds terrifying power thought degradation monotonous undiversified strict regime social media. HCA vaccination brain rot. Ya here's deal. COVID ever political thing. virus care political affiliation.

I know several conservatives voted republican everything entire life sick assholes well.

Personally, never voted blue day life unless option, tbh vote overwhelmingly third parties. (This may change crap.) frequent viewer supporter HCA reddit.

But guys extremists. Think like this: ISIS Taliban represent Muslims? dont. same.

COVID political despite certain extremists think. People need right thing get us pandemic, going spew crap, well deserve 10 seconds fame HCA winner. Queensland Australia done think 4 5 times point. thing benchmark ""seeding"" far lower Delta. cases exposure sites 100% possible. circulating community long near impossible come back from, see NSW Victoria. New Zealand right edge losing control, really hope pull get back zero 45 cases it'll certainly challenge. Ethics me, thee… hate ppl. hate stupid choices they're making end pandemic. they're getting killed dragging others them.  It’s “ethically acceptable” ?! supposed sit back let people burn society?! aren’t people angry! know sympathy for? 

-healthcare workers best deal jackasses. 
-kids can't get vaccinated yet. 
-immuno compromised individuals can't get vaccinated

if otherwise healthy refuse get vaccinated, cannot feel sorry you. idiotic decisions affect EVERYONE.   Yep, rate deaths may slow down, total death count continue rise. gives flying fuck. Moderna gang gang house. friend took mom ER waiting 9 hrs hospital beds. Went different hospital still waited another several hours finally got seen. issue turned major could killed days. 

Another friends mom cancer needs surgery. Hospital cancelled surgery also due beds high risk. also life saving surgery delayed. Neither texas. dislike LeBron using ""I research"" line. No, want research. want listen scientists have. Lol 4 paragraphs justify people victims. they're adults. choose info consume interpret it. Get grip  get Tom Brady say pricks fall line os news? Like wow gj person brain.. Clapclap sure bothering trying explain way prove lab involved. trying prove negative. can’t shutdown discussion via science. end day, reflects lack trust Chinese government around world. Note don’t believe government hypothetical position would transparent. america weird fuck  cdc actually says otherwise. fast vaccines pretty much already done.

Pfizer Moderna vaccines ready week work. That’s “shoddily put together” timeline, that’s “we already done needed tweak minorly timeline”.

Remember, ton coronaviruses SARs-CoV-1 big deal 2003-2004 (SARs-CoV-2 COVID-19).

And testing allowed concurrency rather sequential testing.

And easy find groups volunteer vaccines (helps amount money involved), easy statistically test the, uh, raging pandemic meaning lot infections compare experimental control groups.

In short, whole “fast, cheap, good, pick two”, picked fast good, spent metric fuckton money it. Surprisingly, whole global economy killed, find lot money pony science.

If non-economically dire times don’t go bars. listen public radio. Thank you. thought might case, glad hear someone else.  


If may raise second question curiosity... Early on, felt strange assume get eating. obviously zero doubt truth now, time, still, hard time understanding virus food suppose drink, attach mucus membranes going digestive tract. complicated, in, might, nearly enough infect? simply don't? different vaccines depending go dad got hooked NPR freshman year college. commuted every day, plenty drive time listen. Couple fact talk radio station I’d listened kid losing best shows hooked. Still listen way work home day, morning, it’s something barometer—there’s segment starts time morning local station does, I’m past certain stop light, I’ll late. anyone received (or closely know someone received) Pfizer booster?

How experience go? 

Any hesitations prior receiving it? ""The need dinner proves lunch work"". fuck still considered 'patriotic party'? need repo title them. traitors disguised patriots.  That's get wall, know instead like...walking around.  don’t understand happening. New York City higher population, lower vaccine rate , whole lot less restrictions, yet somehow 7-day average almost ?? 

Are mostly mild cases already vaccinated people? chime opinion, think there's merit sides argument here. areas definitely going overboard things, outdoor mask mandates... time, accepting loss human life given also bleak. 


I think government's (local federal level) response issues frustrating people, whatever response is... measurement health vs. economy. economy pretty much wins always, even cases states stricter mask usage like. cases, nothing seriously drastic done would upset economy, *as currently operates,* big way. in, paying people, providing people material resources, stay home while, comfortably. without that, untenable people work. run essential parts economy (meat packing plants, factories etc.) willing invest time money truly make safe places work meantime.  


So, understandably, going year, people get sick it, resign idea people going die. mentally debilitating, experiencing sociality like long, often find even feel quite real. idea virus abstract enough present hard connect concrete reality.  


But think important remember much confusion conflict stems policy failure. truly believe fundamentally can't prioritize people's health strong enough degree precedence economy takes, especially United States. guess I'll say mostly speaking United States knowledge going rest world minimal. Lol Newport Beach signs front $$$ houses ""embrace freedom fear""

Yeah whatever. Par course area suppose. Get vaccine. chicken pox. really don’t want get disease. less laziness. Yup. said said advocate others get vaccinated. I'm glad got jabs, infuriating someone stature advocate otters same. Canadian, guess i'm gonns boo unvaccinated players. I'm Swedish. even remotely strange get vaccinated beyond ability think. What. The. Shits. wonderful professor. Dr. Pommerville, wrote books. went vaccines Allen Wakefield, believe name time ppl blamed mmr autism. even gave us source sheet future reference incase engaged antivax conversation. Must specific teacher moved topic.... Maybe buy another micro book Go ahead try explain hypocritical thinking people, still make sense endangering entire society.

That's fine dandy thought people endangering others, need understand train thought combat it. kick hospitals they'll still getting people sick unless benefits explained way makes sense them. 

Just way things work comes marketing unfortunately. way around make mandatory. gotcha! pleased there's booster yet means vaccine extremely well. Plus, boosters paid, getting money country tough jobs little bit hard right now. work healthcare provide direct patient care. autoimmune disease. localized allergic reaction doses Moderna. reaction caused moderate swelling upper arm moderate severe pain leading limited mobility head, neck, shoulder, arm days. 

I forced get medical evaluation consult receiving second dose reaction first dose. providing photo reaction (even though wasn’t required), doctor informed didn’t get second dose would provide medical exemption chose get second dose.

I didn’t hesitate second get second shot understand choose going similar experience. 

If worked healthcare able think logically, you’d know issues brought would provide medical exemption vaccine. You’d also understand one trashing healthcare providers cannot get vaccine due reasons. They’re talking providers refuse vaccine without medical exemption. live Alaska, probably 45 cases neighborhood. Good job New Zealand. I’m gonna go limb guess anti vaxxers acting out.

Fucking entitled children.   Someone get Ja Rule phone!!! Yea that’s exactly noticed too, using lexicon them.

Edit: Well really he’s helping them, understand.  1918 pandemic much same, gangs roaming streets beating people wearing masks. (Gina Kolata, ""The Flu"")   Better late never. Imo celebrities make vaccination public might help convince people.  Idiotology play devils advocate, got shot *only* basically forced -- believed science IIRC, estimated COVID death toll already close million (since deaths captured ""official"" COVID deaths) Oh fuck! Another one research Ok. ask wrote obviously opinionated take markets China, say, Congo, Nigeria, Indonesia, Paraguay, India, Turkey Krygestan? zoonotic virus easily break one USAs factory bird pig farms. 

See. That's know American. word China drilled you. compare 'civil society' them. middle East deal uncivilised religion. Russia that, deal uncivilised political ideology... r/traditionalcatholics would like  word also kind like ""skeptics"" overloading hospitals begging Dr save begging get vaccinated whole time. Go ahead try explain hypocritical thinking people, still make sense endangering entire society.

If trust medical world vaccine information, stay fucking hospitals waste human life let responsible people get medical care instead selfish ass. Man that's rough sorry hear fam.   Lol ticking boxes. Agreed. However, try envision individuals situation refusing *slightly * understandable reasons, would guess - working healthcare constant exposure - good number refusing vaccine already Covid might feel already immune extent be. 
 (In reality course people get infected again, worth getting vaccine additional benefits anyway, trying put forward scenario could possibly, kind of, understand someone opposed getting stage. )  Nearly them. don’t understand either.  Yeah, seems way me, too. feel awful saying even though can’t stand anti-vax crowd eventually anyone who’s vaccinated going get either die pull worse wear antibodies. certain point it’s math. I'm mistaken, going May 14, 2020.   What's it???

The stuff made worthy receiving Nobel peace prize. Mexican pharmacies fine. ...or hate Mexicans? issue don’t necessarily know “research” did. general problem anyone say research defend getting/getting vaccine. medical research/trying decipher veracity study isn’t something easy do, trust spent life time thing. It’s obviously better try learn remain intransigent something don’t know. said, one rely medical field information google. could possibly done thing. 

Getting vaccine good thing matter get it. issue lies spread misinformation inability interpret find research. someone sees goes “I’ll research” googling COVID 19, could find anything. course, that's whole point. mandates. theater. religious exemption frustrating. work- anyone applied granted even prove anything. definitely settled science idea attitude akin abstinence theory.

No, isn’t. didn’t research, listened people actually research manufacture vaccines. saying “I research” means listening qualified people reading shit online equivalent. It’s not. “Doing research” bullshit statement, shouldn’t said isn’t true. research do? please share rest us? ""did research"" decided best close ones. One shittier reasons bare minimum right thing. Catholics don’t exempt vaccines religious reasons. Perhaps individual Catholics object certain vaccines developed fetal stem cell lines, blanket exemption medication religions. long takes find fake vaccine card Yes I'm better people listen public radio. Certain people think minimal amount education automatically makes superior. milk cow save life, amount public radio teach build house.  press conference required attend asked question Made rubber baby.. keep throwin hate. soul youre clouding would practical. mandate unmandate remandate masks, forever.  Straight saw someone Facebook say 2% everyone dying COVID isn’t worth hoopla we’ve gone through. Absolutely floored response really call said Ohtani ""intentionally outrageous""? mean, think that's going takes border bigotry can't dismiss behavior entertainment time. might show, encourages unhealthy attitudes times. Tom who? streamer?  Wow. Canada significantly larger population Texas, currently averaging (across whole country) somewhere mid 30's day. stopped say one gives shit. Get shot. not. Nature runs it’s course either way.    feel pretty sure wave last big wave US. continue minor waves outbreaks quite especially areas low vaccination.

But cases dropping spontaneously without new interventions feels like virus running people infect, likely combination vaccinations immunity exposure. Depends go. know someone young, healthy weight got shot month ago. sure fit immunocompromised category not, put maybe. pharmacists changed without asking told afterwards ""fixed"" without asking questions AFAIK. Living Trumpian dream! like trope, feel like average anti vaxxer tattoos piercings. average tats n ink anti vax  Eh say getting booster without large scale data good leader, although I'm extremely pro vaccine. Nurses dumb fuck would helped lying people beginning gotta pump numbers up. rookie numbers.  “did research” ignored CDC, WHO, US Surgeon General wore mask back February/March 2020 saying things like this:

“If look masks buy drug store, leakage around really much protect you. People start saying, 'Should start wearing mask?' Now, United States, absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" - Dr. Anthony Fauci, February 2020

“Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus” - US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, February 2020

“There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.” - Dr. Anthony Fauci, March 2020

“There specific evidence suggest wearing masks mass population potential benefit. fact, there’s evidence suggest opposite.”- Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director health emergencies program, March 2020

“You increase risk getting wearing mask health care provider” - US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, March 2020

They’re lying think it’s greater good (in case, preventing mask shortages). That’s it’s still important research rationally-self interested actor. weren’t concerned particular topic 2018

Masks need worn everyone effective, masks protect people around wearer.

2. True. that's schools require masks, social distancing, offer online schooling higher risk. want cancel stuff, fine, stop stupid everything take precautions.  Wonder used abuse YouTube's report system fuck content creators  I'd never mock someone vaccinated. people chose vaccinate belong society, hope disappear one way another. Good riddance die take anyone them.  Good thing conservatives view cruelty positive character feature. gonna popular! wish award this. 🎖  issue course YouTube notorious shitty AI filters block wrong stuff constantly refusing appeal decisions, lot people going get banned actually spreading anti-vax sentiment, shitty censorship bot.

Anybody YouTube making videos already knows can't even say word ""virus"" YouTube video without getting demonetized. ridiculous.  Funny people deny vaccinations like told government first ones say people get murdered police complied. always ""rules thee, me"" people. You’re conflating “ethics” “not smug asshole”. I’m making fun dead isn’t unethical. It’s asshole. one. least I’m alive.  Whenever someone suffers consequences, include death, self inflicted entirely preventable thing, derived literally incompetence, uniquely deserving mockery.

I'm certain people unvaccinated die fault own. deserve sympathy. die COVID expressing right dumbass, express right mock dumbass.  free speech issue letting house free speech issue. Slippery slope fallacy.

You tried though mocked severity COVID mocked dying it. purpose mocking died likely two reasons. 1) make oneself feel good taking COVID seriously. 2) try shift minds others still mock seriousness virus, perhaps saves lives. recent trend daily deaths reported Russian government [quite practically flat line around \~800 deaths. Also, reports months ago lot coronaviruses death gone unreported Russia, according excess death data. surprise much death reported last months mainly composed unknown deaths months ago processed given accurate death cause. Well depends whether corporation considered part government. whole BS thing corporations considered people People government technically yup government subject First Amendment. And, far I'm concerned, oligarchs corporations also purse strings FED damn near every senator congressman president even special interest groups choose Supreme Court Justice nominees so-called government people people, well, unfortunately makes integral part government therefore subject First Amendment too.

Not care...

Vote Green. awful. Anti-vaxxers nuts, censorship never answer. normalizes oppressive act weakens culture's ability discuss polarizing topics.

Well, considering prevalence IPAs (Immunized prevent award), I’d say absolutely yes. Imagine we'll treat 20-30years climate change ripping us new asshole.

It's gonna rad dude.   Ok, that’s fair US? guess largest group resisting mainly political / culture war reasons. reflects US vaccination rates lowest (more Republicans voters, lower vaccination rates). ""My political enemies favor getting vaccinated, won't! never share anything common them, always opposite I'm free thinker!""

That said, alone. also usual alt-medicine anti-vax people (who less likely align Republican equal size say ""both sides"" problem reasoning based much faith alternative medicine distrust anything pharmaceutical company connected, political based), black people historical reasons less trustworthy government given free pass plenty ways like Tskeegee, ""I'm invincible"" young people, people think covid already think makes immune life, various gullible people falling conspiracy theories pushed around otherwise Republican aligned alt-medicine. already lot limitations free speech, another.  easy chances always Yeah I’m sure outliers! can’t argue math though.

It's also funny someone way vaccines average gets labeled anti-vax. let get right. think someone pointing antivaxxers causing strain health care system they're lacking critical thinking required one thing could help prevent making fun level stupidity. someone harming people actions false information. think that's same?

You think someone getting vaccinated, incredibly anti vaxxed still going hospital. Even though hospital said one thing help protect you, trust trust protect you.

The recent outbreak contained due combination delta strain, different measures timing lockdowns states, poor compliance rules (due length time restrictions imposed) luck relating population virus in.  

This mitigated partly vaccinations, however number people vaccinated lower could been, largely government individuals seeing priority due absence local cases.  Vaccination numbers increased greatly since then, around 80% eligible people received least 1 dose. never said smart. said *smarter* current perception them.

Yes. Vaccines increase antibody count even more, everyone get Vaccinated - said, thinking way forced actually mandate everyone gets needle arm kind ignores science, since people recover opt get Vaccinated ALREADY better protected Vaccinated. protection Vaccines seems fall around 6 month mark, already starting evidence acquired, Natural Immunity simply lasts longer. 

People Natural Immunity, already recovered, especially low risk categories, simply actually need Vaccine. 

Yes, still benefit - choice.  Tonight 11! Celebrity gets praise pulling head ass bare minimum social expectations. come back. People know died Covid: many

People know died vaccine: none

That's enough thinking do.  there’s some. even wasn’t, maybe hear someone else look up.

I think media often showing us hardcore anti-vaxxers there’s people fence, make right choice little friendly persuasion.  People, it’s okay upvote this. POC, I’ll first admit lot ignorant uneducated people community. Granted, due societal factors denied members community access opportunities people, point stands many POC ignorant vaccines work subsequently skeptical COVID vaccine. 40 million kids 17 country. 18 months less 1000 died Covid. common flu higher mortality risk. health concern?

Besides, COVID known cause strokes heart damage attacks endothelium. Anything messes blood flow brain potential trigger mood changes, including depression. heart, lot folks subjective feeling anxiety comes pathology there. It’s easy separate one other, feedback loop part we’re built.

Mom went 2 different Walgreens different forms. One already form new CDC guidelines, older form immunocompromised only. cases, asked signature date, asked questions. got vaccinated first chance. received compensation wasn’t mandated policy employer get vaccinated. got vaccinated want whatever avoid becoming sick virus.  Regarding first argument, make sense bigger time window study, smaller number people reporting symptoms ? example compare people reporting symptoms 3 months infection reporting symptoms 6 month after, decline. “Hesitancy” became unusable term sometime around May / June.

Why dangerous?
And also currently Vaccines employ that?

The CDC [1] estimates 8% population infected flu season. different amount COVID infections last year, seems 10% population.

Of course COVID infections may underestimated, looking forward virus mutating much slower amount people vaccinated, seem far-fetched amount re-infections per year significantly exceed 10%.

There ABSOLUTELY healthcare hesitancy black community covid. good reason - there's lot evidence black people treated poorly healthcare system. They're likely poorer treatment, pain taken seriously, seen drug seeking - even adjusted wealth. Black women 3 4 times likely die birthing complications according CDC. white Americans twice likely prescribed opiods despite black Americans reporting chronic pain (sources bottom)

Wait least 6 months since recent dose. unless old, smaller pfizer dose likely better (not matters much all). well.. FREE believe wish    I’m going agree you. You’re wrong. guess that's bigger concern. still understand justification 12-17 age group. lot conjecture (silent carriers, heart inflamation, etc) since shown unfounded used drive need age group vaccinated. know health impacts covid age group overstated vaccine effectiveness overstated (transmission efficacy time). analysis vaccine safe think whether really needed. see hand waving younger age groups now.

Yet, need continually working advancing lab security. know comment 2 days old, wanted chime district others pandemic first started think viable option far schools go. 

When first closed schools back March 2020, done sloppily much haste opinion (they waited till eleventh hour—they done sooner also given parents time make arrangements meantime). People left day’s notice coordinate childcare, work, tech virtual learning/Internet, needs SPED students, needs students rely school two meals day. 

They finally started get shit together working deals local Internet provider, handing hotspots, providing iPads/laptops paper packets virtual absolutely option, “food bus” time decided food picked different hubs instead delivered regular school bus stops whatever reason. decisions efforts took longer others. 

What think schools implemented good decision children adversely affected schools closing, specials needs children rely in-school therapies children whose parents could coordinate childcare (or real problems made virtual learning damn near impossible) different, confirmed reasons (poverty, access, etc.), schools would form small cohorts teach in-person school(s). Teachers students—conditions allowing, masked, screened COVID daily. continued end school year. 

When last school year began, started A/B weeks half school would go one week, other. hell lot better last year COVID- quarantine-case wise currently are—even last winter’s numbers. Everyone going school right now, every-other-day week, classrooms close capacity. Teachers students mask mandate currently, however know revisited point later year. 

Anywho, sorry rambled. gist think closing/limiting exposure option, especially high risk exposure areas, also done kids parents harmed closings others. really disappointed school didn’t start A/B weeks year, didn’t announce mask mandate week first day, honestly expected, right? doubt schools implement measures, like A/B days weeks unless things get reallyyyyyy bad.

Now, someone proves virus bred infect humans, even research purposes escaped accident, different story. can’t accuse someone without hard evidence free suspicious absence evidence prove innocence. Please explain. referring Tuskegee experiments, absolutely nothing vaccination.

Probably number people 65 huge there. let's tackle saying. feel delegating much ""black people concerned historical reasons"" simple critical reasoning could US public private partnerships tend result one sided gains Private corporations expense american public health.

Sure, agree. things addictive kill slowly - High fructose corn syrup, mentioned. Money bottom line, yes, addiction sugar indeed lead higher profits, even expense decreased lifespan. let's think vaccine, play devil's advocate. know millions around world taken vaccine. vaccine addictive? No. Two shots done, maybe booster needed every year, like take vaccine shots every year anyways. Nothing ordinary. 

Two possibilities. Intentional Non-intentional:

Intentional:

Now let's say vaccines intentionally designed kill us - slowly fast, matter. What's net benefit monetarily here? much. know everyone take it. could anybody benefit killing entire population need alive order function society, also dependent/addicted vaccine like corn syrup way provides substantial monetary gain? top that, vaccines free! early fears heart problems arising vaccines. Black americans long family histories heart problems.

Another devil's advocate. Could remotely possible creators vaccine grouped said ""let's make fucks black people *specifically*"". No. chance. would require untold amounts money research cause effects amongst primarily black people, much races. Occam's razor, friend.

Unintentional:

Let's say vaccine unintentionally dangerous yes, product causes deaths heart attacks whatever. Fine. see happening. Well black person start critically thinking. need determine many percentage deaths. media loves blow things proportion say ""X vaccine increases risk heart attack!!!!1!1!1!!"" black person see think, well, fuck that, I'm out. black person willing look further, blame? alternative? clearly see many people dying. want part statistic? easy search online ""research"". bring point maybe black person cannot afford research, uneducated, indoctrinated, whatever. Sure, yes, agree you, control. man Lebron James afford buy probably every computer US, fuck it, buy personal research scientist, laughable skeptical this?   Nuts like Genghis Khan. he's pretty much dumbass  phrase “I research” really saying “I don’t trust experts” problem regardless whether Google search got take vaccine convinced get one. shouldn’t trying out-research people research living.  You’re gonna source yourself, think you’ve fed line.   think easier accept government science words historically fucked time. 

Same poor people, gov helping before? simple answer sometimes needs align. case exploiters need workers come back exploited again. fact asked ESPN get rid co-host Max Kellerman. 
Go 1 minute mark. vaccines halving chance long covid

Is true? really sucks, 50% less likely. well that’s interesting. PCP recently told don’t need chickenpox vaccine, even though never it, chickenpox itself. told get Shingrix age 50. kinda disappointed, *really* dont want get chickenpox- double checked CDC recommendations. say get vaccine case, *and* say get Shingrix haven’t chickenpox chickenpox vaccine, get vaxxed chickenpox first. 

I wonder frequent confusion among doctors, like maybe recommendations changed several times confusing way/it hasn’t addressed well continuing education something. dont think explaining people missing 36 million dollars gonna help whole lot people. pretty sure could load anything syringe give 36 milion dollars, i'd take it. “I decided rely research medical science community“ … accurate “do research.” Come on, NZ, we’re counting perpetuate species, is. hear you, betrayal runs deep. see protection lasts 12 months?   Garbage self-disposes. believe Covid big deal sure glad FDA still believes thorough testing won’t needlessly risk kids lives. Since kids immune systems lot different adults course test kids. dose size kids found since using adult size would probably caused even heart problems possibly even worse damage death. much less talent changing landscape TV general. Sportscenter used place watch highlights, see online anytime. one care he's vax not. world twisted  always remember shitting Chargers attempting field goal third down, they'd still another shot missed. Said twice show. 

I can't believe almost 16 years ago. Sorry completely disagree. many unvaccinated people dying needlessly taking resources. 

There legitimate reason refuse vaccinated. bringing loss jobs themselves. excuses.

Edit add: fuzzy logic probably already infected huge part problem. Delta different threat faced back wild-type virus. need vaccination protection. Yes, that's we'll break COVID holdouts: NPR segments. know immunocomp not? Nothing Moderna FDA VRBPAC CDC ACIP agendas yet. Youd notice wake county Ha ha ha, really say, ""I skeptic""? Jesus Christ. [CDC Demographic another way get 1 hospitalization per 50 cases 0-4 age group.

0-4 6% US population, 331,449,281 x 0.06 = 19,886,957 Kids 0-4

There 802,143 cases per CDC 0-4 age group. 

0-4 hospitalized rate 80.7 per 100,000.

19,886,957 divided 100,000 = 198.87 x 80.7 = 16,049 hospitalizations kids 0-4

16,049 divided 802,143 = 0.02 2% chance hospitalized kids 0-4 years age. Another way state 2% chance, 1 50. Developing myocarditis vaccine.

More likely worse Different stages pregnancy.

Risk severe disease likely Cancer. Multiple Sclerosis. history cardiac problems. 

COVID loves Allergy ingredients vaccine.

Pick different vaccine. Immune disorders immune system attacks body. Etc.

The risk much worse concern side effects pertaining issues listed above.

See also already contracting recovering Covid 19 gives better longer lasting immunity. reason get vaccine case unless immunity waned (which test for).

You pay expensive test take extremely safe free plenty reasons.

So… back horse dewormer? word ""research"" fundamentally irreversibly devalued   need NPR interview. money. ""I research"" easily translates ""the NBA Nike telling may pay this, i'm it"". put number perspective. last time world population 6 Billion polio still thing. Thank you! 10-year-old never terrified getting shot before. looking forward one! Fingers crossed 4 vaccine far behind! Scott's predictions perfect, he's probably accurate talking head pandemic. Let's hope strong track record continues one! ... what?  thing antivaxxers bit far gone rational discussion Somehow people still trash this, idiots…  Check link posted above, 65+ stats 461 boosters prevent 1 hospitalization vs 2051 boosters prevent 1 50-64 year old hospitalized.

From societal perspective (which FDA considering), 65 pretty solid cutoff.  92.3% people read headlines.

I read article headline least 2436 others like him. misunderstand. don’t want employees. Full stop. make plans. Sunk cost fallacy unto death.  sign piece paper stating are.

Sauce: multiple people know signed paper get booster work forces eat piece that’s horses   What?  wish luck hope putting rest takes like ""if US government paid people stay home 4 weeks COVID would over"".

Elimination hard takes much longer even strict measures.  Good 4k institution. cops pulling crap kind officers want job anyway. fire bring fresh recruits, might actually see overall improvements way police force behaves. ONS did. study control group flu patients. Bigger window context means length time observed. ONS 12-16 weeks patient symptom time within 4 week period counted (for compared analysis, ONS also separate analysis continuously symptoms, symptoms time). new study 3-6 months symptom time within period counted. joke US is. global punchline. Lebron James orders spaghetti cut tip. pretty crippling fear needles specifically injections... Admittedly, reading medical evidence stressing cause realised actually go get done. 

Yet somehow, reading truth absolutely terrifying personally (because made go get injection reality) make seek false information anywhere order avoid it. Instead made go get done soon became available age group country worry whatever boosters come about.

I know wires get crossed people's brains. scary.  notorious playing balls really cool he's position life make decision health based research, thoughts, intuition. people hand need jobs feed kids really get luxury. hey know side benefit forcefully coerced getting vaccinated people eat inside restaurants maybe catch movie theater now. anti-vaxxer thinks Covid solution . . . Irritate lungs even breathing peroxide? Smh 73,000 employees, terminations represent three-hundredths percent take-no-prisoners approach vaccination bears fruit United Airlines, led commercial aviation industry aiming 100% compliance. company says since imposed mandate, requires 67,000 U.S. employees get vaccinated Oct. 25 face termination, vaccination rate exceeded 97%.

So far stories seem covering large employers.

If really mandate businesses one hundred employees, would leave 20 million people worry enforcement work. Sounds like people wrong professions anyway. think number New York perhaps area state, city?

""With 2020 population 8,804,190 distributed 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City also densely populated major city United I’m pretty sure ran got degree virology. Bought lab coat everything. :) got wrong study, headline one:
 37% headline uncontrolled, descriptive statistics, study control group (influenza patients, symptoms 50% common covid patients flu patients). states implemented already, businesses mandated employees.  heart lung issues have? medically diagnosed? obese? ever hold opinion change appear weak dick labia falls off. could still considered idiot? Yes truly believes science understands decision… good boy. thought still weeks months mandates actually enforced. 

During supposed national concern, still follow mandate businesses one hundred employees. reminds discussion many years ago antivaxxer .... post pictures people polio asked ""why seeing around us?"" .... got angry upset demanded remove posts.  Firstly, wanted say ""thanks"" think pharmacists get enough recognition. even pandemic-wise, general. know hard job difficult gotten past 20 years so, thanks sticking it. chronic condition needs several prescriptions month, pharmacists many techs know date birth face.

Secondly, thanks explaining things like people. getting common, especially anything covid related, jump people's throats misled something like this. throat jumping understandable **ignore** explanation, everyone needs learn facts first time somewhere.

EDIT: put good mood I'll give three months reddit gold.  He'll co-publish Ja Rule. *immunologist (or let's say kind scientist)  Hmm... maybe soon we'll loop back around drinking tonic water quinine. one bad. Yes, everyone listened Niki Minaj's opinion vaccine rather telling stick vocation. Israel study would like word...

Edit: sorry I'd link it, I'm mobile. Thought police ftw!  fans vote too. think lot people educated. worries, one reads articles posting Reddit anyway. I’m pharmacist I’ve lot experience recent weeks explaining bad idea don’t recommend it. original Covid didn’t deserve die already beat Computer Virus/Algorithm year. LeBron getting ready inevitable Space Jam COVID Virus. People horrible numbers. idea sheer chaos would ensue one every fifty people country die. would disaster. Please hold wipe egg face...

I opened article new tab wrote comment reading it. thought people essentially wafting vapors bowl peroxide nose, aerosolizing inhaling mist. Bad posting reading, bad pseudoscientists spreading this, bad lungs inhale peroxide mist. Vaccination reduces chance catching COVID chance spreading [at least (likely much higher). [third might improve another factor [as much give best effect there's longer time since second dose. Moderna's trials done 6-8 months half-dose (close Pfizer's current dose).

If twenties vaccinated risk (hospitalization/death) catch COVID very, small. family that's much older higher risk.

The issue taking away first dose someone elsewhere world. really wanted protection I'd look doses going thrown out, wait (not much longer) supply longer limitation [worldwide every dose reduces infection death small amount everyone. Good luck decision. got vaccinated felt entitled lollipop, simply that's doctor rewarded got vaccines kid. athlete want lungs get fucked up? Unheard of... dont understand logic behind non doctors saying research. Unless go school 8+ years become doctor nothing read help you. really end day people liking told do. Get opinions doctors sure. lets real, athletes dont question surgeries supplements put bodies this? 


Im pointing strictly Lebron ive seeing lot athletes this. Catholic actually follows doctrine would consider getting vaccinated sin omission. cause pretty bad lung irritation inflammation, want you’re battling Covid. One thing isn’t mentioned article inhaling non-sterile solution introduce bacteria lungs, good way get pneumonia Covid. It’s bad idea around. back world became enamored idea ""Zero-Covid"" something close it. one yet willing accept virus going ebb flow cows come home, we're currently essentially laying end game planned, hoping vaccinations somehow accomplish us next year failed year: normal life.

I'm hoping rational minds eventually prevail midst global hysteria. keep pushing people get vaccinated, also MOVE. FUCK. ON. Poor guy trying hide std became international incident. idea major University hospitals (University Chicago Northwestern) start giving boosters? scheduling immonucomprised ones now. toothpaste works use every day? one done right?! got vaccinated months ago actually. One teammates, Dennis Schroeder, said everyone team vaccinated except playoffs last season. 8% lot though already strained.

Thank God research, enough info there. Fucking douche always read alleged “booster” early covid days two doses use. know scientists thought true booster (like what’s happening now) would happen, you’re right messaging unclear that’s meant. Perhaps need spend 15 mins better educate yourself. California actually lower % undocumented compared Texas (5.6 vs 5.7) California similar % foreign born compared New York, New Jersey, Nevada etc (26 vs 23 vs assertions completely incorrect.

He literally proponent variolation, process killed 0.5-2% people treated. Vaccine mandates literally American apple pie. Agreed. got quarantine two year old got COVID, **all three** adults household got breakthrough infections. fully vaccinated earlier year: two Pfizer J&amp;J.

I’m saying don’t work; none us went hospital. However, really, *really*, ***really*** hoping life could go back normal vaccine became **available**, got yet-unknown portion population vaccinated.

I know that’s turned out... really thought going able pick pieces life COVID shattered it. lost career/jobs (not even low-demand fields: Integrated Circuit engineering, systems programming, HVAC system/control Design), house, hobbies, friends (multiple died). 'i hesitant decided everyone it' Isn’t COVID survival rate 99.97%? lol hardly smallpox dude troops Antivaxxers reason nuts need ""may contain nuts"" label.  think forcing anyone ? He's busy congressional hearing climate change  vaccine available health care providers since late December 2020. Anyone works directly patients still unvaccinated month, wasn’t actually going get vaccinated voluntarily. wish LeBron said something along lines ""Researchers convinced me. Science sound. reason believe them.""

But no. ""I research"" like nutcases like say. Maybe tried make point, it'd lost said nutcases.

I'm disappointed, much so. still hate phrasing. still makes sound like there's situations getting vaccine could somehow valid decision lots families. 

This simple - unless immunocompromised somewhat rare medical situation *doctors*(not people social media) say get it, getting vaccine acceptable choice 'for family friends'.

Basically, comments still heavily playing 'personal choice' narrative up. Well every single human entitled whatever research wish anything put bodies. kinda ridiculous gatekeep word ""research.""

I actually appreciated used phrase, kinda throws back face anti-vaxers keep using excuse. ""I research"" stupid excuse *not* get vaccine. research would lead reasonable person get vaccine, actually appreciate said points legitimate personal ""research"" lead one getting vaccine, anti-vax.

It basically throws one anti-vaxxers key talking points back face. Since campaign support illegal activity, wonder GoFundMe could cancel it. should. people deserve 0 support shenanigans. Yes. seriously problem ""one research"" thing. 

I sorry personal problem, problem involves whole humanity one can't research unless immunologist. 

People go ask things echo chamber call ""doing research"". No, research, Google search. Fame another source power, concentrating power one place always leads people getting hurt one way another. New York City probably far people natural immunity compared Singapore. That’s sort Covid-0 approach double edged sword. great preventing deaths hospitalizations overall, soon cases spread turns outbreak fast due low natural immunity even high vaccination rates. compared Texas covid deaths w/ pre-pandemic causes death amounts. end year, covid might flirting w/ cancer 2nd highest cause death Texas past 24 months. Thinking much society invested curing one class disease deadly covid been, caused wonder, shot prevented cancer, would anti-vaxxers even take it? Ah moron get that. I'm asking research done got point trusting vaccine, given black, then? Yep, that's San Fransisco NYC local ordinances prevent playing home games. ordinances apply visiting players.

That's Kyrie Wiggins talked much -- 2 openly anti-vax players playing 2 cities actual mandates prevent playing home games. plenty unvaccinated players, talked able play every game cause city ordinance. read said, justified research limited knowing facts are, level pretending peer review science ground (unless field course). enough data suggest longer expect winter surge? Even importantly, 1st 2nd doses older adults moving forward. fast, make headlines, still consistently making amount people high risk hospitalization death smaller.

I think winter outbreaks locations weak vaccine coverage adults, yeah, hopefully next big national wave. everything's dumber Texas believe making joke based typo top comment saying ""sure arm."" feed other. Youtube ""experts"".. aka dumbass fake doctors saying stupid lies... Facebook spread shit. burn think is. high point infection curve, hospitals packed facing staff shortages.

I sorry sacrifice. sorry pandemic brought control responsible adults been.

But dangerous activity. kind thing kills people. decades late. Social media end United States. Finally    Exactly. Want freedom vaccinations, go it. stay away rest us. Common core math toooooo haaaaard! Good luck  study actually ok. article useless.

It useless high background non-COVID sufferers positively answering questions (""did headache recently""). rate high, depend lot things, like region, weather, economic situation, etc etc.

Unless select similar matched non-COVID sample population ask questions (which study flu control group), results contain basically information all. Thats thing.. every move fuels ideology. Irrational people can't reasoned with.  No, it’s moderate worse side effects overblown popular discussion vaccines, data phase 3 trials Pfizer showed 10% people got anything mild reaction like sore arm.  Someone scholarly expertise philosophical domain ethics.

Ethics actually really important. It’s philosophy pretty decent undergrad degree (or minor, etc) people planning going law. It’s also important/relevant biomedical field. mean understand . However democratic right ? 
Not anyone would care lol data saw focused less process outcome, precisely - ability prevent serious outcomes. three stages HCA:

1. Begging likes FB edgy antivax memes
2. Begging lives ICU
3. Family begging cash I've downvoted saying stuff like past agree.



Advertising propaganda work. Many people lack self-discipline make rational decisions ""marketplace ideas."" observable fact



Meanwhile, whole planet suffering things like covid-denialism, climate-change-denialism corporate propaganda. 


We cannot simply allow morons morons decisions beliefs profound effects everyone else. Great going Spain.

Weird statistic though - target population? Vulnerable, adults, whole population, aardvarks? it’s ok mock cause pain families friends then. Well done still horrible person.  Mediums, like internet, go well beyond framers Constitution could possible imagine.

I sure hope apply logic limits second public alternative guarantees free speech (on internet medium)

This isn’t really true. strictly unrestricted *public* alternative *are* numerous free alternatives internet. aren’t entitled YouTube algorithm even entitled post nonsense somewhere internet. Hmmm, okay. I’ve read comment one virologist. “Mankind come covid pandemic smarter cause dumb ones won’t vaccinate.” hate fuckin sub. terms impact volume, boomers taken facebook one big echo chamber, people dont watch youtube directly facebook link videos platforms upload directly facebook.  Youtube: OK let's close barn doors stop letting horses out!

Horses outside: already built advanced society skyscrapers achieved spaceflight. 

May little late youtube.  It’s guilty pleasure Herman Caine award page Propoganda would believe overwhelming bulk decided forgo vaccination white, middle-class up, Republican. actuality, racial minorities far likely hesitant get vaccinated...and racial minorities overwhelming trend Democratic party. 

But would go narrative villains are, frequently ignored liberals. antivaxxers even gotten New Age spaces started infusing false rhetoric it. Apparently (Disclaimer: bullshit ahead) vax 'shuts chakras one one vaxxers incarnate different planet it'. 🙄 Thanks lot. missed nuance article. makes lot sense would mainly critiquing medical professionals.

I still find difficult feel bad dead antivaxxers, though. bad choices willful ignorance led straight grave. vaxxed told would. 
This purely political post moderators remove. What’s got mocking people die. Well done. Vitamin C, original panacea. treats scurvy.

*But maybe diarrhea megadosing means working whatever want cure? /s*  got shot April. 

You understand scientific process things change. even that, it’s going create hesitation people don’t, people would think things politically charged. Additionally, personally really disagreed CDC removing mask recommendations beginning summer.  system broken. wonder much mistrust, sadness. mention going information far credible, delivered authority.   Yeah, it’s this.

All mockery coming fact people stupid dying result. 

Like, blueprint right them. Get shots, wear mask space others, wash hands, stay away others you’re sick. everyone this, win maybe get go back normal life.

It seems like high vaccination paying dividends. would nice know vaccinated people died underlying conditions full vaccinated long ago. seems 40% deaths vaccinated people seems high me.  sacrificed most. complaining life style changes give good citizen neighbor help keep people safe. continue restricted unvaccinated people. 
But you’ve given more. Thank you. I’m sorry end.  Yes grandson trouble this, far I'm concerned someone chooses get vaccinated stay home die couch get sick. even care little bit makes bad person. YouTube isn’t government.

Then government banned that, health children.

well, may actually overestimation. literally don’t give fuck someone that’s anti-vax dies COVID

Lesson learned — get vaccinated won’t probably die. guys realize sound objectively?

Big tech &amp; government censoring adults dangerous. 

Adults okay censored even dangerous. Who’s celebrating? makes sense. thought experiment- ICU max capacity someone taking space risky behavior like drug overdose, would support giving space someone else needed didn’t engage risky behavior? [New York City verge falling ""high"" transmission category, case rate 118.28/100,000 past seven days falling 23.8% word boosters pregnant women?  Willful ignorance. Give FDA CDC couple weeks look Moderna's application. One major reasons deleted Facebook. ""users mocking unvaccinated people who've died COVID-19""

Not relatives, actual people longer us.

Harassing someone dead relatives wrong. that's big difference mocking people died essentially due foolish beliefs endanger us all.

Also, mocking causes people embarrassed getting vaccinated saves lives worth it. go right ahead mock dead relatives anything want long chance saving lives. I'd happy hear it!   Youtube honestly ...  study Arizona tested health care workers weekly infection found vaccinated health care workers breakthrough infections lower viral load, less likely fever symptomatic shorter period.  

There fairly wide confidence intervals findings study found 5 cases fully vaccinated individuals (vs 156 cases  Yeah, entire county, ~200000 people 1 person 20s die entire pandemic (it Delta weeks back). aardvarks

the population matters  Well fucked cruel unvaccinated idiots putting retail workers, health workers many professions harms way. sure mocking cruel constantly spreading disease vulnerable peoples followed proper protocols. They’re dying stupidity, Fk them.  Maybe whole calling people morons thing. Yeah im sure news doesnt agenda..... ads targeted? year later youtube ??   FUCKING FINALLY . toxic asf wishing ppl death time incoherent comments ... fuck anti vaxxers spread misinformation.  Falls line government wants might well be. 

Are social media platforms used primary method days express oneself days? Expect type headlines global warming years.   It’s going up, huge win, means forces work suppressing exponential growth. Decrease cases naturally follow health department also identified “a number” students attended classes infected virus homecoming dance, according release.

A homecoming dance pandemic? Really? school, people sound ignorant poorly educated. adults allowed happen uninformed students supposed teaching. Shame them. hope nobody dies. Alberta?

I'm surprised patient would assault obgyn mask close proximity.

Fuck stupid people. wear ignorance like badge honour.

Yeah, really hope 2 tier system limited spots non-vax safeguard spots others resume surgeries threatment needed millions.  Yes. Get going. Cure third one worse second. surprised. lasted one day feeling fine. ""They think we're stupid.""

No, idiots proving us *are* stupid. doubt. know.  People need help facebook host videos?

All trashy videos ever saw facebook link youtube. imagine might impact too.

Should done year ago? Certainly. 
Will make difference now? think will. MIL, example, sends youtube videos bad vaccine is. least prevent going youtube rabbit hole. finds another site, finds another site. meantime, gives us little window opportunity might inject sanity.    ignoring fact people infectious middle pandemic killing thousands people per day united states alone. would like saying couldnt deny care person stab wound waving gun around ordinary people around country dying thousands daily basis gun crimes. cant sedate someone coronavirus make longer danger everyone else like nutjob patients. pandemic worse, hospital boards/doctors/NPs would absolutely deciding would wouldnt get care. Hospital boards implemented plans capacity reached many debated taken ventilators Ecmo machines. unvaccinated top list.

I didnt say couldnt get care, receiving care outside hospital full sick recovering people. tent outside hospital run unvaccinated nurses staff.

It unethical bring dangerous infected people ability vaccinated free hospital danger everyone else. take is, let's allow lies spread caused 700,000 Americans deaths, millions globally? went 20 year war 3000 Americans killed, heavily boosting defense/security efforts funding. logic, YouTube (if existed then) kept al Qaeda propaganda recruiting videos platform?  anyone actually surprised? Reddit, like every social media platform, far beacon morality. isn’t even Covid thing, internet well known no, I’m saying crying heart every post see!&lt; People suffering consequences shitty actions deeply satisfying. get bit ethically murky consequence death, people also indirectly hurting lot others bullshit they're spewing social media 24/7. Opposite here.., decent amount people still wear masks high vaccination rate (New York)… husband diabetic don’t want risk all. Luckily we’re also self employed, work home lot time. making last part; someone site tell bad driver giving 3-second gap car front me.

Was r/idiotsincars chance? Cause odds I've defended lol Anytime anyone vaccinated comes hospital needs help, kick willingly unvaccinated idiot wasting bed they're going die anyway. choose believe medical science, get anyway? great know. Thanks informing me!   NJ - always like point half deaths first 3 months. Yep - look March 2020 wave vs Dec 2020 wave NE look good got treating covid.

In NY, first wave peak 19k hospitalizations 900 deaths winter wave peak 9k hospitalizations 200 deaths. peak half hospitalizations 1/4th deaths. really is. miss old days internet social media. mom became victim YouTube's algorithm antivax videos, thankfully got her. mandate helps too.  It’s size child that’s consideration, say “a child isn’t small adult” 

The dosages taking consideration robust immune system is, young responsive body be, data. They’ve done testing different dosages earlier phases studies. Furthermore, actually cost unlisted number. Delta tough stop   think point damage done. agree yet see app.

Clearly, app mistake. TLDR; anecdote little subject OP

The simple minds justify immorality easily anecdotes. ""If smart enough go watch one videos,  
smart enough common sense understand need do, 
 please, go get vaccinated us favor,"" Saccoccia said.  thought FL might also reporting, [Total Excess (which capture COVID coverups) since 2/1/20:

Nah dude, mad PARTICULAR INSTANCE. thousands deaths would absolutely bet money ""celebrated"". 😂 antiva wins 😂 time, JFC Youtube.

I can't believe taken long.   pandemic turns endemic next year, nope \*insert Syndrome meme here\* 
""Too late. 15 years late.""   stupid enough hand personal phone number, probably stupid giving people health advice.  Last wave?  seen single HCA post multiple antivax propaganda memes also posted person finally catching Covid dying. headline article complete fucking bullshit.

""Vaccines ends lockdowns, understand?""  Tell politicians. Youtube done year ago Facebook reddit. Failure social media clamp misinformation literally cost hundreds thousands lives.

Social media policy needs overhaul. Social media treated like public utility. Right billionaires financial incentive keep people talking controversial things led public health disaster. I'm afraid causes harm solutions. 

Some platforms, like Reddit YouTube, open comments downvotes. creates technical mechanism truth tends prevail.

Other platforms, like WhatsApp, Instagram Facebook, force users inside bubble everyone thinks like you.

Instead shutting anti-vax content, maybe artificially force users outside bubble, showing pro-vax content. Otherwise migrate another dangerous platform. Area Code 416 Toronto totally understood this, creative. Also hilarious. Thanks laugh!  Stay home pray Yeah believe needs content provider accountability blatant spread disinformation. YouTube definitely big part problem. US think radio might even bigger problem. Especially radio. full wackadoodle conservatives railing vaccines 24/7. Recent surveys show ~90% Americans listen radio given week 50 million plus listen AM.   Weight doesnt matter age does. vaccines, covid ones. Vaccines different regard medicine. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!

No. use brains definitely backfire us future.   He'll cash cow them. Imagine much traffic exclusive Facebook would draw Twitter... work Labor Department know works, hope get fired cause able apply unemployment. inevitable media claim ""economic anxiety"" problem people would also take major issue actual problems discussed. media literally believe truth cruel uttered aloud.  Turns ""hygiene theater"" actually pretty damn useful keeping nasty stuff bay.  It’s still me. Maybe got banned?

I think vacuum, HCA good. take everything context, it’s become necessary evil. What’s driving people get vaccinated stories Delta. It’s easy anti-vaxxers anti-maskers look science/data/authorities. changes mind seeing fellow anti-vac/mask go path wouldn’t want follow.   lockdown now? not, complaining, Vietnam lockdown hard hit south-east countries, pacific islands, still lockdown population even double vaccinated, vaccinated all. 

Australia made big fuc* buying vaccines time, using never ending lockdowns time vaccinating, New Zealand slow that. using lockdowns there, delta would spread like wildfire, population immunity whatsover. 

High vaccine rate ends lockdowns every social restriction, understand? Mola mazo! I'm sympathy people pretend resistance somehow brave, noble patriotism rather stupidity

This something dont understand self-described 'patriots'.

This literally war us virus. can't think anything patriotic fighting virus save American lives masking getting vaccine.

But guess surprising 'patriots' fly ~~confederate~~ traitor flag wrong side history. case FIL, pastor, supposed whistle-blowers like Robert Malone, medical professionals like Jane Orient. Basically happens ex-employee FDA Pfizer something turn anti-vax. gets picked right-wing internet groups church mailing lists, eventually Fox News. 

People tend believe one whistle-blower agrees worldviews entire organization doesn't. Happens time people notice till Covid. make right tho. know immunology/virus expert/doctor making decisions? Didn’t see article people virus potential spreading great even lock downs. Yes course, used collective ""you"" apologize sounded like meant specifically. quote article discussed lower dose still mounts strong sufficient antibody response COVID-19, even 11-year-old who's taller weighs kid 12 protected...The Pfizer data showed smaller dose younger children generated antibody levels comparable 16-to-25 year-olds received standard 30-microgram doses.

It due size/weight kid. lot children's immune systems handle exposure new antigens. Depending antigen, equivalent response adult much intense response adult. state high vaccination rate, nobody wears mask now, last year people wore them? 

I also sincerely doubt difference mask mandate. Last fall, areas social distancing rules place. Reduced capacity public spaces, offices still close, schools closed, large gathering banned, etc. 

Plenty areas high mask usage terrible outbreaks last fall/winter. Deplatforming works. Look much heard Trump since got banned Twitter.  cruel, funny. It’s bed . human capital healthcare almost close spent . massive shake staffing . We’ve running 110% almost 2 years . It’s starting feel like new normal . normally experience couple “surges” year especially winter . 2 year long “surge”. still stupid thing say. research. Regular people, basketball star not, capable real research deadly virus. I'm sick hearing phrase. googled 15 minutes. research anything. mention conveniently set labs near sources/populations they’re concerned with. makes sense they’d close together begin with.

I see makes sense. wiser set labs places social distancing built way life, like lightly populated rural areas, opposed major population centers contagion likely spread population quickly?

Maybe decide take second look lab safety, banning experimenting dangerous pathogens within many miles major population center may make sense. Astronomers, geologists, archeologists, many scientists travel remote places research, perhaps standard practice. one ever leave virology lab dealing worlds dangerous pathogens get directly crowded subway train.   Thanks bare minimum coming fucking late.

shitbag.

GET FUCKING VACCINATED, ASSHOLES.  US reach 300 million fully-vaccinated summer 2022? anti-vaxx sentiment big obstacle achieve goal? r/HermanCaneAward Uneducated parents create uneducated children education shoulders. Schools don’t even teach learn, books learning techniques, never ever heard school. came one technique finally, would super nice schools tell children make knowledge stay heads short learning time possible. Literally 90% knowledge school already head (I’m 31). really think essential skills ignored schools (at least live don’t think it’s much different anywhere) much emphasis put learning historical details (not saying history general unimportant, learned unnecessary details, lot uncomfortable facts country left alone, always good guys history books) construction cells, naming geological formations etc. It’s specific, barely remember anything isn’t related professionally personally. Essential skills everyone needs rarely taught. shouldnt require lot hours teach kids find information lo learn properly. think need teach less facts (that googled moment anyway) skills. bit misleading say they're unvaccinated people. like 'aggressively willfully ignorant anti-vaccinators took time day make fun people get vaccinations followed pandemic measures'. Sure, victims misinformation, also actively perpetuated it, held dangerous holier-than-thou, won't-happen-to-me rhetoric think definitely hurt point yes, definitely can.  issue Russia's data, Argentina used, data Mexico used. US anti-vax government level. I'd love see research see struggle explain means that. It’s celebrated. It’s used way get people get vaccinated. also award redemptions (people ask others get vaccinated) one people decide get vaccinated post it. Weirdly, seems work. Delta terrifying, people faced reality laid out, it’s pretty convincing.  Haha, yup. thinking exact thing. ""hah, shitty genetics beat it!"" fuck Kyrie.    ""I research"" Really? Lemme see lab results  Glad see harmful misinformation get banned Cruel… haha, NO. Play dumb fuck games, win dumb fuck prizes.   insanely high number people 20s one high school pass away. checked data locally whole metropolitan area barely many deaths age group whole region.

Lol, come on. I've lived people. Let's naive pretend saints except posts. 

They peddled information killed. Many. yeah think does.

Regarding 2, peak viral loads Delta variant appear equivalent,

""appear"" lot work there. CT values vaccinated unvaccinated people beginning infection. CT values used surrogate viral load studies. huuuuge question, i've seen answered ways is: CT values correlate viral load way vaccinated unvaccinated people?

Additionally, samples vaccinated people get infected containing viable virus, shredded parts? 

Another thing consider is... well... COURSE they're CT value, sampling nose, *where infection gets started!* vaccinated people make enough infectious virus nose immune system kicks order spread it? studies looked culture virus vaccinated people infections hard time getting viable virus. 

Regarding 4: might actually way around, though I'm sure know bad immune response low titers causes severe infections severe infection messes immune response. far I'm aware ""unvaccinated"" people specifically ""antivax"" people, huge important difference opinion. We’re discussing users **deliberately** disseminate disinformation endangers public health.

There “good-faith” effort there. They’re knowingly blowing smoke people’s butts click-fame (or worse).

Do seriously understand difference?

e: 

And please don’t ever compare social media ToS user agreements slavery. It’s tone-deaf duplicitous. right, anti-vax probably killed orders magnitude people. could force get vaccine, know. Yup that's point. Deplatforming works longer centralized location consume horseshit looking for.  would nice year ago Fuck. Anti Vacciners.    Along capacity treat unvaxed.

However things get mostly full people unvaxed denied care.

I think fair moral compromise Amen. Thanks sharing info. name link? suspect (and hope) distribution/logistics issue overblown. Though unfortunately may overblown issue: politicization vaccine slashing demand.

I'd guess *eventually*, treat childhood COVID vaccine exactly like treat roughly dozen vaccines: mandated schools.

How *long* take, idea. comparison, believe recent childhood vaccine near-universally mandated schools chickenpox vaccine.

For states, happened year two. others, took decades.  Yeah, probably best feels little icky. sure could turn out, ethically. Great answer, thank you. think article conveyed this?

For record, since apparently got downloaded statement (wtf), way implied 40% vaccinated people dying. simply couldn’t parse information article quickly. 100% this. absence real cause fight for, many anti-vax folks taken crusade gives something do, side fight for, underdog get behind. 

Contrarianism real easy thing fall into, actually feel great rebel fighting evil empire, that's going them. lemmings led slaughter, instead reasonable human beings trying protect one another deadly pathogen. kid first picture looks like knows he’s surrounded lunatics. Almost meme worthy.  unvaccinated something else. know individual didn’t go hospital feeling like dying ulcer thought hospital going give vax without consent. Freedom speech include freedom consequences. Take down! nothing concrete antivaxx movement house cards. 'facts' nothing confirmation bias lies disguised emotional appeals. 

Ethical implications statistics clear vaccines, antivaxxers care reality: want *scary needles* cause anything wrong ever happened lives.  That’s awful hope don’t truly believe that. you, adult, refuse get vaccinated non-medical reason, get sick take hospital space, effectively committing manslaughter gross negligence. stupidity kills innocent people. Sorry, won’t shedding tear die. little late. They'll probably start brand YouTube scale well &amp; falls constantly. 
Like stepping internet time machine. Nah, conservatism always deadly— *conservatives*. first time consequences choices actually negatively impacting them.   see saying using fire analogy think like trying douse grease fire water. reinforces delusional narrative they're silenced mind equals validation. clear, necessarily oppose YouTube's decision here. see they're it. think adverse effect long run. That's balance society. every part pulls people together teamwork, *always* proportionally motivated group set undermine teamwork cooperation. natural balance. 

A team perfect coordination agreement miss danger signs skeptic pick easily. people going away, need learn deal them, utilize vigilance distrust make good thing world. I’d personally like see companies politicians contributed spread held legally accountable death suffering caused.  I've asked times AMA avail.

As vaccinated (2nd dose Pfizer) immunocompetent person (and varied data available me), feel pretty confident understanding building threat model. However partner vaccinated (3rd dose Pfizer immunosuppressed. Enbrel medication cause suppression nothing genetic), approach threat modeling?  cathartic.  None articles criticizing HCAs want say that. that's word.

Its deaths, people revel spreading covid.  told need sympathy them.  need see things point view. that's taking empathy turning codependency.  

By giving evil people much deference hurting ourselves.  shit acceptable expecting sane people bear burden causing psychic harm.  would expect ethicist understand people see injustice go unpunished weakens fabric society. 

Its absolutely possible individuals take wrong message HCAs vindictive worse, fringe define majority. HCAs island sanity country besieged craven assholes. Lol k   Interesting Way fucking late, done 2008 around Well also considering half (?) kids overweight, trials groups represented Cheers that. Hope helps doesn’t make kids who’ve read 1984 freak out.

Other that, though, best meme curators I’ve ever seen. took long?!?!   good thing south overflow vaccines. absolutely issues finding one, two, tens pharmacies, grocery stores, walmarts, etc appointments. even ""shopped around"" one location made uncomfortable area giving vaccines (random chair middle vitamin aisle, everyone watched). hope able find appointment soon though! lie peddled investor shady ""Covid treatment"" company. Honestly, weren’t reality, would say sounds like great pvp multiplayer video game pitch didn’t year ago? give money made families lost people covid believed them? member said ""I care, u""? doubled said ""F*ck feelings""? Pepper ridge farms members. called long form videos specifically insta really that. Facebook videos, failed catch significantly. I'm really familiar whatsapp.   previous rhetoric Delta it’s 95% effective infections period get vaccine. it’s shown around 60-80% effective Delta infections somehow main messaging shifted hospitalizations deaths. also shows decision stop collecting breakthrough case data collect breakthrough hospitalizations deaths.

So yes shift goalposts Delta came. goal keep effects initial infections managed thrown window. cruel mock them? cruelty person elected mislead vaccinations?  celebrating one raging fires extinguishing itself, probably nicest thing they've ever done humanity.  also running pro-vaxx ads front right-leaning channels nothing vaccines, noticed. can’t blame people much becoming “anti-anti-vax”.

1. large number people supported Donald Trump, man encouraged oppression minorities among terrible things.
2. There’s good reason anti-vax maintaining sort stupid pride one’s self, culture, beliefs, “strength”, and/or patriotism. Basically fear getting vaccinated somehow means losing one’s identity.
3. anti-vax group whole least sympathetic meanest people you’ll meet.
4. importantly, people endangering lives others process, forcing beliefs friends family. Actually patient follows medical advice ...praying good way patients remain positive.

For mother's cancer..the edixaltreatment saved praying best kept hopeful. Facebook team create new product kids engage play date per WSJ expose !!    What's considered reliable source depends want confirmation bias on. anti vaxxers believe sources research reliable. medical professionals read medical journals ""research"". rest us reading people's opinions Nah, LBJ dead Thank you... too. Research implies talked doctors, read it, etc. laughing people due diligence taking vaccine? Damn. ""Wah"" - Selfish Neofascist Police  False, 2 circles, one people listen NPR smaller circle inside one vaccinated hope ask voted Abbott last election. would really bad got Covid maybe shouldn’t working hospital. move one excuse next. gives fuck people think point. mandate move on. want die jeopardize families health outside public spaces infrastructure. point medical system 100% fucked black people before, distrust misplaced. But, religion obscure bullshit Amazon made can't verify. wanna know “his research” was. conducting experiments lab something?

But good getting I've made joke bars, ""I listen public radio, I'm better you."" You’re wrong. that’s public health official’s goal, mine. personal level, want absolute best protection family myself, means getting booster soon can.

Reminds Obama encouraging Americans go spend 2008 financial crisis. That’s fed’s goal, get economy going again. good country’s economy. don’t fault that. personal level, saved every penny can, that’s best personal financial strategy. Considering shit that’s happening gen z probably drop life expectancy Exactly. research. listened qualified researchers. Oh awesome. probably set even without test. Good luck! Brainwashed. Hope mother going ok  Really? research? lab studying virus?  Good! There's ton pumped nursing trade schools every day. big loss.  assumption everyone chickenpox (even don’t remember never even realised they’d exposed).  99% Americans 40 chickenpox antibodies.

To sure though, actually get antibody test.  *proven* immune, get chickenpox vaccine.  (You didn’t mention it, I’m sure realise that’s option.)

That’s going area advice keep changing next decades.  Rates chickenpox much lower (due vaccine), soon won’t able assume everyone it.  

Luckily antibody test pretty easy/cheap, suspect become new default - send test don’t recall. Celtics fan here. LOL Sounds like shut dribbled.  Nah, Lebron research I’m guessing trusted virologists athletes too. 

You probably make argument shouldn’t normalize antivax positions like they’re reasonable points view. It’s like saying people believe gravity don’t— shouldn’t mock them. It’s “there two sides every story” situation. 

Innocent people dying **other** people getting vaccinated. wish said ""then talked doctor answered questions"" instead. don’t get rid overweight nurses nurses smoke? Yay cares others! Wish ""True Patriots"", whatever idiots calling themselves, actually gave fuck country people it.  bad theory. time? Less year? woman trying get pregnant enough research vaccine menstrual cycle? future kids? doctor recommended to? never leave house? man 300 lbs smokes vaccinated, dies blame unvaccinated? think people take accountability health? Watch Dr Ardis link Immigrants avoid health system ? immigrant California. garbage spewing ? California also generous Medicaid Medicare systems cover undocumented immigrants I'm confused. research would LeBron done got point ""ahh yes, giving real vaccine placebo""? 

I admire whole research, research limited confirming tested, gone required trials, FDA approval (now) etc. anything else, unless research confirming existence actual research efficacy etc. 30 min research behind computer never going top thousands scientists' working day day since began. 

Get vaccine. mentioned video source. Clarity unity Well execute anyone covid you’ll zero cases disagree. Looking information simply *consuming* research, *doing* research. It’s expected course action general public take result research done. You’re becoming informed. dumb people scared rethinking things. keep doubling harder harder spite evidence saying wrong    heard many people say realize never flu got confirmed flu case. People confuse severe cold flu undstand flu much worse. ""I research""...

""Basically told many millions could lose get it"" could ever predicted trumpsucks attacking nurses?  fuck people mean say ""skeptical"" vaccine?? geniuses reconciling following fact:
Unvaccinated individuals 11 times likely die virus vaccinated person?    works, even though may require booster every then. people seem know meaning ""working"". People trying best, USA #1 🇺🇸  There’s long form. bag money he’d lose. friend friend? Like ever held weight conversation let alone argument Clarifications real assurance Right? Maybe that’d help convince African Americans get vaccinated. Cause he’s black. Holy shit, man fucking genius Taking health advice Nikki Manaj like taking human rights advice Gregg Abbot  “Joshwhotv” reliable source. You’re believing literal lie posted people lie often regular can’t stay YouTube.

This literally pinned post about: you’re trouble differentiating truthful untruthful content, please refer pinned post /r/Coronavirus Imagine got myocarditis double checked got wrong. wanes 36% 12 months. stays highly effective longer Pfizer still weakens bit time.  I’m glad got shot didn’t research. read others research made educated decision. 

Maybe I’m cynical semantics. Well one reason need flu shots year actually don’t work well one nothing other. You’re going need covid vaccine booster anyway seems like it’s terrible comparison whichever way one makes it. Well yeah sure, people rational making decisions. excuse unfound caution OP saying specifically black people vaccines. Survey says: X  zoonotic origin preclude lab leak. precludes engineered virus one enhanced natural selection attack humans.   This. still waiting people come urine therapy.  opinion matter frankly don’t care. saying proof presented makes lab leak scenario impossible.  We’ll, yeah. Hundreds millions people already. believe Vaccine best solution ALL?  start GoFundMe page collect enough buy box Kleenex try wiping away tears they're thinking money lose.

*^(Brutha, cain ya spare dime?)* r'amen. People need stop saying research actually mean Google search. Unless dude lab, research shit. research.....by listening people way smarter longer he's alive ( anyway ). 

Yea, LeBron still idiot. research medical community treated black people, even white people trials.

Maybe they’ll consistently COVID precautions place long time? full gamut masking, social distancing, capacity restrictions, etc. Moderna booster probably approved week so. two weeks behind Pfizer submitting data it.  valid medical reason fire any? good place respond me. Could hit first someone else's comment? got flu shot issues. Little arm soreness tiredness nothing remotely close felt covid vaccine. tiredness likely worked extremely stressed.    Vaccines available everyone (even him) since December. Like OP said, looks like got April May, turn get it. don’t blame taking season, that’s chose do. 

My original point said “dumb rest them” got vaccinated isn’t continuing sower doubt like players currently doing. Idk hard point understand. Massachusetts,

[Dozens Massachusetts State Police Resigned Vaccine Mandate, Union State Police aware 1 possible resignation vaccine mandate, source one got vaccine without research all? mean, general knowledge definition “vaccine” could go get one. Oxymoron ever heard one haha audacity ignorance required assume know better vast majority scientific community... Definitely not. I'm suggesting perfect scientific consensus. I'm going take smoking cigarettes today case science shifts 30 years, I'm going risk (far worse every estimation) effects COVID science vaccine could shift. Well, that's basically part first 2 types kept holding out, treat team versus team B resist much team choice, still come back team say got despite wanting governor employer. still admitting wrong think took loss battle. Many team likely accept may find situation already have. 

Also, believing crazy stuff could also get vaccinated, say choice, admit wrong. really fear face health problems worse covid mind controlled, may still refuse get vaccinated even means fired chance unemployment benefits.  wish said, “I listened experts” instead “I research.” creates false equivalency anti-vaccine dumb fucks also “did research.” Warner brothers probably told smarten shit lose future movie deals. skeptic’s mind, would believe someone interest telling positive things it?

They want hear people resources trust people like her. 

It’s kind like go restaurant ask food good. course restaurant tell us “yes” it’s friends reviews see random people matter. 

You figure think way want understand. probably beneficial think. NBA kinda forcing players' hands. Lebron probably talking science. likely ""I dont wanna miss games extremely inconvenienced"" anything else. thought path led right wallet vaccination.  nba requiring players get vaccine.  wasn’t going sit get paid mother experiencing side effects cancer treatment took 10 years show.

They appeared 10 years stopped treatment? You’re going ignore saying NBA players vaccinated April, aren’t you.

I... responded you. post. would respond you, person said me.

Are petulant child can't wait minutes someone respond you? wasn’t available everyone available medical professionals.

Lebron James could gotten soon anyone vaccinated it. absurd suggest otherwise. touched noodly appendage? can’t imagine world— least perspective— AUS simply lets case count climb.

They let case counts climb point next year lest keep borders shuttered activities restricted long time--likely years anti-viral developed completely eliminates symptoms. New Zealand even interesting case since less tolerance COVID AUS does. fucking need booster. many vaccines require well??? recently get MMR booster adult.They want angry shit world. really hard? also believe ESPN lost ability force cable tv platforms package 'extremely basic'. many/most households option decent package include ESPN expensive sports networks, whereas decade ago starting choice. boat. Hot takes shows instant flip remote me. SAS, Kendrick Perkins, provide shoe'd substance shows. soundbite entertainment. Talking loud mean information means. tune NBA Finals SnF, occasional MLB game tossed in. 

Oh days highlights gone.  People anaphylactic reaction first shot generally probably avoid second. said could probably still get Janssen's shot Novovax gets approved. No, right. great news. Starting look like end getting closer might think. fact cases literally falling every region globally telling. Let's hope COV-2 'peak fitness' Delta end game upon us. Appreciate post.. Well partial. fda time study. Also many hospitals exemptions. 
I can't say got covid probably obscene amount did.

The vaccine stop transmission delta. seeing now.

Yes people liberty deciding, like people get flu shot. wear masks. healthcare workers already required take vaccines anyway? like hepatitis? different? simply cannot understand train nurse health professional fail see propensity data vaccines' safety efficacy. AFAIK said word it. I'd tend say yes still want wait 3 months biggest protection boost, might want discuss doctor instead random redditors. right anti vax. going crazy right county need mask usage people like rational would agree nobody wearing them. rare United States, however. state among best country moment we're still middle mass casualty event, dozen people dying every day. numb death point change actual value life.

We sick it, clearly want find someone blame. Blaming seems pretty pointless, means go helps feel less sick. Yep I've always liked rule driving within day last drink. Admittedly, Public transit really helps still. I'd also wager minorites anti-mask too. might vaccine hesitant probably still taking measures reduce likelihood catching covid.  800 terminated hospital work next week. Well 800 across 5 hospitals system. Props actually accepting mistake taking efforts correct it. research? WTF even mean.. come man.. always options get food/money without getting vaccinated. 

&amp;#x200B;

What Dems anything? Yeah, fuck medical experts saying it. King James think it?

Like get it. It’s great celebrities help normalize it. it’s unfortunate takes something like celebrity endorsement convince people it’s nano bots whatever they’re afraid of.  weird, people even skeptical vaccine administered millions times. Absolutely. insistence sticking vaccine regimen developed year ago purpose speedy clinical trials ignores reality data changed lot since then. data shows full vaccination 3 dose regimen, getting many people fully vaccinated possible.

By Singer's logic, bother giving anyone 2nd dose still people doses all? obvious answer 2 doses considered threshold ""sufficient"" protection. data shifted threshold sufficient protection 3 doses, sudden care people sufficiently protected?  find real world different high school. mandates, ones companies 100 employees kick again? excited heard feels like weeks passed company work made sort announcement whatsoever. demonstrates mandates work. matter many petulant children complain mandating stuff makes likely get it. uninformed people complaining people 'not following science' criticizing decision making annoying.  Ja Rule think Lol, imagine actually believing this! Hospitals already require workers get slew vaccines, including annual flu vaccine. Covid vaccine different FDA approval? guarantee 800k covid even have, get infected virus second time since everyone forms antibodies (64% compared 100% vaccine)  
 related reason get two doses vaccine create robust response since one provide much protection Delta. 

Educated people make bad choices. reason hospital workers probably chain smoke even thought see lung cancer/COPD patients sufferings deal with. are, however, allowed make bad decisions places would put others risk. freedom smoke ICU. feel fair people make choice puts patients, choice hospital, risk? They're forcing companies choose insurance employee. problem tests. kind win situation. get students pass tests. lot states school districts deciding raises depending many students pass tests. real challenge teach thinking skills need make sure pass standardized test.  remember got closer closer would say stop teaching social studies science focus language arts math. 

Never mind work inner city school students might know something like skiing is. culturally challenging life experience know things others take granted. educate shame. unethical shame someone know information.

 yes degree nursing diploma, probably learned ethics, read reseach, rights autonomy. 

Do shame patients family members? hope not. Seems like enjoy pushing weight around ignoring actual role steward sharing education. 

The vaccines protect serious illness death, transmission. 

Highly doubt vaccines updated. Thank well wishes. live one vaccinated counties US, actually. looked 86% 12+ population least one shot. county, people kind like preventing vaccinated people like actually moving lives, fucking sick there's issue I'll call ""exception fallacy."" People still care even family dies it. reason people commit crimes even though they're likely get caught get caught. Humans insane ability convince exception. ""control"" circumstances surely would never get it. always someone else it. Oh God's sake. latch onto excuse vaccinated. Vaccines work. Period. shame good. Unhealthy behavior shamed, got smokers outside.  want award ? word research getting abused. Actual researchers damned many people vaccinated also listen NPR?

I agree hazard community large needs addressed. don’t want call it’s result scary... read it, Indicate people even mild covid brain changes detectable (with group statistics, necessarily reflecting individuals) cognitive test brain imaging (awaiting peer review)

I also agree you. plenty post viral syndromes mysterious lingering effects, including brain fog. probably studied closely. Interesting considering one highest populations country...🤔 “Shut dribble” isn't. California huge population poor people immigrants. avoid healthcare system due insurance, cultural reasons, poor.  Keep tired circle meme Moderna one study original trial participants; one group vaccinated around summer 2020, another group dec/january- former placebo group offered shot trial unblinded. significant difference two groups fared july/august 2021, looked specifically limit results delta. severe disease breakthrough 65+ nearly tripled, 18-64 50% higher.

Unfortunately control group unvaccinated suitable comparison overall would whole paper itself, clearly establish protection wanes time dependent manner, show absolutely need booster point. FDA probably wants play games wait *after* perfect timeline observing increase general population, rather get ahead clearly checked Dec/Jan, significant waning experimental group average 5.3mo, pre-delta, like lot info, FDA inappropriately seems consider delta variant combines waning, uses lot pre-delta data say waning 6mo.

[Other really surprise. state requiring vaccination Friday based recent court ruling. Makes sense ""on fence"" crowd suck haha I’m convinced lot concerned shaming people condescending actually getting people vaccinated. know recommended dose scheduling Moderna going end being, general, longer delays doses tends give better protection. get third dose 7 months recommendation ends 8 months 12 months, less protected unknown (although presumably small) amount. course, recommendation ends 6 months, matter.

The consideration Moderna planning half-dose booster, think administered anywhere, presumably would lying get full-dose booster Moderna believes unnecessary (i.e. probably additional protection increased chance side-effects).  also ignores spread. hear Polio Measles vaccines good ""protect hospitalization death"". hear good they've eliminated entire branches infection point almost one even gets exposed. I'm trying get hung word ""rampant""; another factual way describe direct experience ""very frequent"". talking 1 50; we're talking 6 20, others comfortable confirming infection awaiting test confirmation. may half said done - that's LOT. Ergo, used term rampant. 

I recognize outliers, sometimes outliers radical suggest much higher reality. learned today work, similar outcomes entirely different building simultaneously experienced. 5 25 far. 

I enough info reliable source absolutely convinced many vaccinated people getting, growing spreading disease right now. I've also got lot great direct experience reinforcing vaccines keep symptoms mild. think obfuscates numbers; people get headache, slight tickle throat bother get tested, test would show bright pink spreading like crazy. 

Not trying exaggerate; again, direct experience last weeks. Ah man! really can’t decide agree not. one hand make good point, hand line thinking slippery slope leads insurrection. don’t get free healthy vaccine? people need stop saying “did [their] research”. people research scientists labs pipetting centrifuge tubes. actually coworker would fine getting later, health problems going doctor wants base line getting shot knows something might bad shot her. also already covid antibodies still. mandate made worse cause wait see doctors appointments medical exemptions denied more. state really fucked healthcare cause lose people can't afford lose. Aaah! SPAM! .... replaced ""Police"" ""Cop"", they'd called SCAM, works well ways. yeah, indifference people want police reform; seems accountability repercussions damage cause.  huge gap.

The main differences ONS analysis study are:

* ONS used 4-week window look symptoms in, study used 3-month window reach 37% figure

* study includes 3 symptoms ONS analysis - ""cognitive symptoms"", ""anxiety/depression"" ""other pain""

* equivalent figure ONS analysis would 5.0%, 3.0% - 3% figure ONS estimate people continuous symptoms, whereas study looking people experienced symptom least once. agree general rate people continuous symptoms relevant, purposes comparison, let's compare like like

So factor study looked symptoms window that's 3 times longer, looked wider array symptoms (including anxiety/depression, widely reported single symptom study), 5% 37% look bit less far apart other. Polio 3rd shot booster 6 I’m ER nurse. Police bring us sorts combative people dump ticket pocket, though usually get scot free. police write medical emergency give custody hospital, hook. yeah, group heavily armored armed police show scene, taser mace person, handcuff them, dump ER group people scrubs held back hospital policies/management don’t want force drugs used. It’s bad mix. 

Another big assault group elderly. get dumped ER time relatives tired need break nursing homes also need break. problematic really hurt you. ever try changing soiled briefs sundowning dementia pt? dodging poop fists. think keep nails trimmed understaffed nursing homes? straight daggers dig arm aren’t careful. might nice day 7pm turn serial killers. goal day ER staff get hell ASAP, especially nighttime. “I research.” 

WHY. Can’t plebs trust professionals, ya know like every aspect existence? stupid egocentric response every time. It’s ok know everything, aren’t stupid admitting aren’t professional virology / immunology. feign intelligence means called “research.” How's edgy contrarian working you? Vaccinated people catch spread COVID, although speculated may less likely spread - perhaps contagious shorter period time. 

In state 18% cases amongst vaccinated. vaccinated likely contributing community spread. 

I’m fully vaccinated go store unless mask mandate. I’m actually driving 15-25 minutes way go area mask mandate. area drops mandate, I’ll likely go back getting groceries delivered.

Find another career isn’t going change won’t win stamping foot. wish well. Thanks. I'll keep eye out, Dr.'s online suggest tests works they've provided test names investigate. becoming increasingly clear due combination significantly waning neutralizing antibody levels prevalence variants replicate much faster, full vaccination longer two-dose regiment. booster give slight boost ""peace mind"" Singer puts it. raises people's protection Delta &lt;50% incredibly significant increase could save millions getting sick. lot anti-booster arguments center around important fact vaccines, despite reduced efficacy disease, still provide significant protection hospitalization death, paints incomplete picture disregards seriousness post-covid disabilities affect many people mild moderate cases.

In addition, argument presents false dichotomy giving doses vaccinating rest world. Vaccine production ramped significantly, we're point production exceeds demand. solution vaccinating rest world simple US shipping stockpile; logistical ""last-mile"" problems poorer countries much larger roadblock getting whole world vaccinated. mention doses expiration date, US's stockpile surely plenty doses last long enough actually help poorer countries expire.

Every pharmacy US literally dumping unused doses drain every single day. better alternative recognize current data shows two doses cut anymore fully vaccinate vaccination readily accessible, time still everything possible work toward getting rest world vaccinated. Us dumping doses drain solidarity going help anyone, ensure millions get sick preventable illness. got first shot. wasn’t skepticism wasn’t research ( I’m plumber hell sm going understand medical papers medicinal research ) came walking place line offering shot. Getting medical advice high school educated person wrong need help free throw scheming 3-1 comeback ship I’ll listen MR. James  CDC/FDA approves it, must approved state, county, corporate. I’ve turned away patients weren’t authorized give shots approval come couple hours later. One times I've heard someone ""research"" vaccines good context  Yeah think would've better didnt say legitimizes idea jump internet learn theres kind conspiracy traps there. Nowadays research quality sources. think 'listen doctor' could stronger argument hesitant. get it. husband major surgery years ago. nurses kept alive. fucking comprehend attacking someone helping you/your loved one stay alive. I'm sorry many people shit. layperson deciding get vaccine “research” almost stupid person getting vaxxed bc research. Let selfish morons kill themselves. isolate somewhere stop clogging hospitals. excuse mandate? new excuse them, never going get begin with.  done vaccination, would Decision 2, end says, ""I'm taking vaccines Moderna"", nurse comes gives shot. Humans overweight fear unknown. risks unknowable potential side effects outweigh (in many peoples minds) fear COVID, especially young already infected.

I've found everyone extent, many different things consider unknown different levels risk known items.

Many also become militant fears challenged, likely coping mechanism.

Other factors involved people: admitting vaccines work means admitting COVID real serious bit facing ones mortality. some, denier coping mechanism overcome fear (of COVID).

And course people ... idiots.  people dont watch npr wouldnt darn thing don’t think booster booster going go well eventually even pro vax question integrity companies producing shots. said, it’s hypothetical.  want take second think this. don’t see obviously *the best* approach situation I’d argue bit lost. expert testimony studies put around almost year. Clearly isn’t reaching people don’t see reason change time soon. People aren’t particularly rationale. Hearing someone people look believe access better resources say something relatable *exactly* sway hesitant people. swear interested condescending spiteful rather actually getting people vaccinated. That’s exactly problem. Reading conclusion thinking understand study exactly people trying research. Conclusions don’t warn poor study design, poor sampling, poor interpretation. harm good. really think people listen? Cops barely shower scum bathroom. doesn’t make sound smart think earth talking about?  think 12 million lot valuable though. would like see concrete numbers amount people using pirated streams watch sports. think UFC would highest, followed basketball, football, baseball. completely wrong, hospital Bay Area denied vaccine shipments one point over... something. Like giving shots administrators something like that.

Anyhow, time begging anyone knew give injection volunteer. understood principle situation, Jesus. microbiology class years ago entire unit immunity. private nursing school? Unfortunately lot morons people love! NoNewNormal (antivax conspiracy hub; nut thing fine) reason someone position reason into.

I’m glad that’s decided done. Japan won’t needlessly prolonged. Right, functionally differ little government. agree you, companies certain size enjoy free speech privileges general populace enjoys.

Also kids listen school ever

I think educators would love actually teach critical thinking they're busy trying convince kids listen instruction stop parroting parents' wack talking points... picture clearer couple weeks FDA ruled Moderna booster application.

Also, careful apples-to-apples comparison efficacy.  number different efficacy measures (could vs infection, symptomatic infection, severe disease, hospitalization, death, etc.; measured every vaccine) really meaningful compare efficacy X vs B Y

For better comparison see slides CDC ACIP meeting: 

Moderna indeed better like 65% vs 70% (for symptomatic infection) rather 44% 90%. exactly right. many people ability understand science haven’t provided tools need so. Indigenous Americans number one vaccinated race tribes didn’t hand pamphlet say “do research”. hosted panels, encouraged citizens come speak medical professionals free, empowered us information!

I telling someone used care lot last night I’m upset getting vaccine know he’ll change mind. believed intelligent enough misled people around him. able easily debunk lot claims clear hadn’t around anyone opposing view awhile thing he’s heard echo chamber didn’t hold applied logic &amp; reasoning. really feel like sites like YT need take stance misinformation general.

Which even *more* reason take vaccine order *stay hospital.*

Like, yeah...Covid-19 disproportionately affects blacks blacks get worse treatment healthcare system. adds to...*refusing* vaccine help keep sick enough need seek medical treatment first place? I'm really seeing logic there. got lot people state ones rural areas republican areas stupid anywhere else.  listen Behind Bastards podcast episode Facebook/Zuckerberg. think two different times them, I've heard first, holy shit chilling.

Get shots, folks! You’ve got doctor knows pathologies. doctor must research pandemic. Reading reliable publications least give opportunity understand what’s happening knowing what’s best since knows pathologies.

If certain position stands, would resort censorship invoke “to prevent harm danger others” excuse starts totalitarian regimes applied form censorship.  complicated, time simple. boils ""either decentralize internet live corporate technocracy"".

Infrastructure including backbone networks publicly owned. ISPs heavily regulated. Edge providers (companies websites web services) broken up. Agree you. need stop counting cases focus ICU capacities deaths. contact tracing testing/exposure quarantine. vaccinated, it’s cold. you’re not, face risks. I’m done all. Time move on. vaccinations available kids 12, mask mandates go. I’m NJ really hope masks lifted sometime school year. maintained throughout pandemic though, vaccination. measures place since reopened September include masks 12s. thing that's changed contact tracing done, there's positive case class.

Huge, huge difference. almost took 2 years happen

Unacceptable Low risk, worried. non issue. high risk live someone is, would make boundaries. Corporations telling think, covering ass. deplatformed private business, regardless user base, censorship.

Huge, huge difference. people tired of, considered many became dangerous morons YouTube videos? 🤷‍♂️ would almost respect level commitment making life wildly problematic endanger whole bunch innocent people. one going continue wear masks foreseeable future that's silly.

""No one going something extremely simple order save life. That's silly, thinking life matters anyone.""  Obviously meant opposite realm anti-vaccine pro-vaccine videos.

The opposite factual cannot also mean factual. 

One deliberate disinformation. 

The demonstrably isn’t. 

Nobody right use someone else business property however please without permission. 

YouTube says *no antivax bullish-t.* That’s rule agree use property. 

The innerweb huge place. YouTube one website innerweb. 

Like don’t. Use don’t. balanced that. YouTube's algorithms pushing anything make stay longer feel engaged. turn make truckload money ads. automatic process without human interaction. pathetic stone age human brain instincts battling control super trained AI billions interactions humans get better better better that. good fact, owners longer control power remove content site. think classic brainwashing techniques anywhere near effective YouTube, think again.

Radical opinions effectively spread relatively bucks, machine able manipulate feeble human minds... fucking rented anyone money push messages. Anyone. worst kind possibly imagine. need completely new set laws prevent ever happening again. late.   Upvotes/downvotes mean thing ""understanding"". like 3 conversations (really arguments point) going time, none really coherent they're arguing points make. I'm gonna clean break lol bank accounts start taking hit, they'll take shot.  definition, absolutely no

Would definition government trump business? since definition ''system group people governing organized community''

Just realize wrong ''take L''



Additionally, talking laws irrelevant since arguing YouTube broke laws, arguing YouTube (as governing body) moral responsibility uphold freedom speech principle. 

If YouTube owned operated state would violate Universal Declaration Human Rights.

In end, different outcome same?

It's literally loophole UN consider corporations would immensely powerful drafting human rights laws. Teenage pregnancy... consequently pregnancy another risk factor severe COVID illness. prominent, WaPo, famous. get getting bit bad info fact checking take vaccine. would difficult presented information factual positive light yet still people reject information en masse. Basically comes vaccines many people really middle? seems nice problem is, clear line pro-vax anti-vax. many positions could considered anti-vax:

* take vaccine

* people take vaccine

* take vaccine mandatory

* vaccine mandatory specific concerns addressed via study

* vaccine mandatory studies still take place meantime

* opinion vaccine specific company/politician involved lobbying vaccines investigated corruption

We need better way establishing open environment discussion investigation issues without creating cults personality causing people act irrationally.

Youtube ok mainstream political implications great take action. 

However places online open discussions take place members public free get involved. facebook announce similar attack misinformation can't say I'm completely certain done anything I'm pretty sure still see some.  I’m anti vax anything, don’t like this. Currently authorized booster Pfizer previous Pfizer recipients.

Can't read? content removed allowed talk it. Maybe know misinformation context? easy spot malicious misinformation Anti-Vaxx. Claiming elections rigged even happened. talking weaponized misinformation used radicalize people.

No one claiming throw scientific method. talking punishing people trying bring harm society obvious provable misinformation.   Daily hospitalizations went 130 pre-Delta, peak 900 July 27th. Then, hospitalizations took slight dip trended again, finally hitting plateau daily level 875 (not much lower peak). reached plateau August 20th. Hospitalizations started trend slightly, beginning on/about September 16. 750 daily admissions September 24th. time tell true downward trend simply another slight dip trending (as happened previously). 

For reference, UK population 66.7 million people. home state North Carolina population 10.5 million people. UK hospitalizing people rate North Carolina, would 2044 hospitalizations per day. Time exists. Immunity wanes.

Pharma execs talking booster shots start.  dont know people downvoting you? dont like truth? stating facts. One pro vaccine still take measured position risks.

I dont think kids vaccinated unless vaccine risk substantially lower, lets say 10x lower, virus risk, assuming kids get Delta, seems inevitable. kid pretty much everyone got smallpox polio chicken pox vaccines serious diseases kids, much serious covid.

I dont know risk numbers pan therefore cut point is. know US vaccinating age 5 UK somewhere 12-15 pretty much done risk analysis. Maybe teh UK cautious maybe US cautious enough.

Need see numbers. 100%. really? great news!! Especially schools open time now.    Finally good news.  There's car see commute nearly every day. matter time leave, always end behind vanity plates. Miles away destinations. Really weird. Oof league also require teams donate lost wages charity.

Don't let owners benefit pay player.  SLPT: Tell people wrong Facebook go deeper conspiracy theories eventually killing selves poor decision making.

Sorry brother btw.. I’m sure testing masks. China contain risks part zero covid strategy.

The concern vaccinated people course much smaller concern unvaccinated.   one needs log Stormfront grasp average character userbase.

Ooooh confusing. Certain immunocompromised people could take daily boosters, yet never generate enough antibodies real protection. pandemic new life-limiting situation. need find alternatives lifelong house arrest.

I'm also concerned loosening 12s vaccinated. Right now, seem looking November ages 5-11.

Back May, CDC advised vaxxed people (mostly) unmask, ages 12-15 become eligible, zero time get fully vaxxed. Delta lurked shadows well, already wreaked havoc India worrying Israel UK.

Almost us unmasked - vaxxed not. loosening go well.

My county's mask mandate. loosen up, hope look vaccination rates, hospitalizations deaths (2-week plateau 2-week drop) allow youngest eligibles sufficient time significant number get fully vaxxed (2 months).

We need loosening - one that's sustainable weeks.   Yes think potentially dangerous grant government power shut certain forms speech without considering possible ways could backfire. There's reason checks balances place types legislation. That's backbone government. know urgent problem think people quick call legislating around problems without proper consideration  fetuses embryos spontaneously self-""abort"" time, one holds funerals cause one notices. Yeah. Research problem. able effective research non-expert crucial life skill. figure optimize taxes, say someone asks join cult, etc. Critical thinking evaluating reliability sources. Basic stuff.

People often talk “common” breakthrough infections are, us fully vaccinated, wonder many times we’ve proper exposure Covid-19 never got infection due protection vaccination (where would quickly infected vaccine) many times breakthrough cases get exposure finally catching it. 

This anecdotal, since fully vaccinated, two separate occasions sitting 3 feet across someone indoors cough, tested positive Covid next day. never tested positive, delta outbreak. mean could cold something else necessarily covid go get test concerned vaccinated be.

Okay. Don’t love line - worried believing everything MSM tells you. exactly getting info ? hypocrisy nerve types depressing.   believe opinions shoot basketball things he's expert in. Last heard, kids encouraged wear masks school required.
Is still true? testing quarantining program? Infected kids caught fast pulled school?

Pity kids spread coronavirus families everybody else, along many illnesses.

My poor staff get every respiratory infection known, pinkeye, norovirus, dozen things hordes visiting sticky little people year. mask mandate, strict capacity limits, handwashing requirements (plus covid vaccination staff) we’ve actually caught lot fewer illnesses normal year. one.  HPV vaccine prevents 70% cervical cancers, 80% anal cancers, 60% vaginal cancers, 40% vulva cancers 90% hpv positive oropharyngeal cancers (which 70% oropharyngeal cancers).

In 2019, 54% US teens date HPV shot. (It’s likely lower right due school closures impacting school-run vaccination campaigns.)

So, no.  People won’t take cancer vaccine. mom survived cancer 3x locked home since February 2020. lonely. depressed. understand selfish people done many others, including son covid twice.
She vaccinated doctor want exposed, chance gets breakthrough case. yeah, say little angry understatement. HCA cathartic outlet many us. one celebrates suffering would lying say feel bad them. made choice us respect them? No. That’s shitty attitude. He’s saying he’s skeptical, checked it, felt reassured found.

I thing. seemed pretty quick develop vaccine. learned bit mRNA, saw long tested, reassured. Got shot soon available me.

Being pedantic constitutes “research” isn’t helpful. Yes, someone saying research referencing Facebook idiocy plainly research harmful.

But mock someone saying “did research” plainly thing right - presumably understanding vaccine worked, timeline trials - super fucking unhelpful. 

You’re lumping together people blindly believe Facebook memes people reasonably skeptical willing educate make choices based new, valid information.  think covid.(?)

It started Monday felt going get sick (you know feel head) night fever. went back normal today feel sick (like feel dizzy stuff head it’s like get fall anything).

This weirdest feeling ever feel moderately sick fever.

I’m vaccinated three times already maybe it’s virus poking vaccine? thoughts? Good idea. Hard implement, well worth it. Even perfect.  GNU STP  Yes, I’ll let save life, terms it’s convenient  people really cared turning deaths messaging might save other's lives, they'd tell story many people could reach say could happen you.

The stories place. Every single news station least one super sad story young father/mother even dying due COVID leaving behind multiple children. label ""MSM lies"" ""those actors"". people reasoned with, visited sub would know. thing think make difference going source misinformation believe in. vaccinated people, believe science, exhausted point. can’t help people; fact don’t want helped. don’t care live die I’m furious taking hospital beds could go people appreciate science behind medical treatment. Elvis getting polio shot live TV major influence getting population get it. nothing new true, testing aggressive compare countries. aggressive testing cannot use explain raise case. IMO combination, test, positive rate trend, etc would better assessment. 

In fact, Denmark lifted restriction restriction double Singapore tested. Total 41,927,792 vs 19,560,496.

Positivity rate reach 2.2% last week using MOH data \~64,600 tests avg per day (lower week \~67,100). ourworldindata data 21 Sep. wish people would stop saying ""I research"" started saying ""I listened experts"".  people family &amp; friends.

Herman Cain vaccinated died vaccines didnt exist then. cannot fault Herman Cain getting vaccinated. 

I fault Herman Cain spreading lie COVID isnt threat, saying people shouldnt wear masks socailly isolate, generally encouraging irresponsibility led HUNDREDS THOUSANDS DEATHS country alone. 

The people ""mocked"" HCA people spread lies, endanger others, come back bite ~~ass~~ lungs.  ""quarantine centre""  Wow, would thought would higher rates vaccination among teachers health care workers. Good job teachers. Thank work. means lot rest us believe science.   venn diagram ophra vaccinated people? wife's OBGYN. assaulted pregnant woman asked keep mask on. colleague assaulted trying get building.

We small outdoor gathering backyard last weekend. consensus among docs dealing anti -vaxxers fuck 'em. never thought would feel way fuck 'em. Zero sympathy. actually hope non-covid cases would fill beds instead morons. Canada, paid for.

Fuck anti-vaxxers. Rolled eyes “I research”, don’t care much celebrities weigh politics whatever, LeBron ain’t vaccine researcher. What’s gonna discover don’t already know?

I think rhetoric around subject dangerous fuck. think real danger taking lungs. Hydrogen peroxide would simply burst alveolar sacks, believe.

It might funny, painfully sad. fed constant stream dis/misinformation intended harm. we're charging asshats spewing stuff out. Fox, OAN, News max, Breitbart start with. shaming mocking people results vaccinations, moral ethical so. unvaccinated seem bully mindset appreciate mocked.
If saves life, worth it.
Mofuggas can't even bare minimum asked. sympathy assholes.  Yeah, hell “we” even refer to? 
Most every sub Reddit seen level headed amongst us expressing concern long COVID impact healthcare systems long term. 
Perhaps “we” also missed virus would reek havoc cases started popping outside China. I've saying #teamvirus, basically same, yeah.

It encapsulates antivax, also antimaskers really everyone willfully working public health policy petty reasons. also like implies two teams, they've chosen betray humanity join plague. Yes It’s like dealing alcoholic addicts. Sure it’s sad die, it’s human life, trail grieving family. sadness earlier tried help stop self destructive. made repetitive choices led tragic demise. Nah. It’s mockery. It’s worth documenting downfall people acting petulantly refusing put faith expertise, spreading bullshit others.

There several posts subreddit clarify overall point it’s existence, state explicitly wish reason exist. Also, community made point keeping social media material blacked people don’t flock actual accounts engage harassment. Appreciate effort doubt make huge difference. Based I’ve seen anti-vaccination crowd… make double scream louder. Plus, they’ll play whole “unfair censorship” angle try make look like innocent victims “trying spread truth evil government/pharma/whatever”. 

I tired people.  Plaguebearer name choice  live vaccinated state low mask wearing (estimate 1-2%). daily positives triple time last year without vaccines. difference mask mandate. ethicist say cruelty propagating deadly virus?  Kudos calling time traveler vampire, lol. easy find new jobs too.  mock voluntary stupidity stubbornness led tragedy. It’s pointless normal people…society large held hostage radicalized anti-vaxxers. hear Texas still looking imbeciles Well shit, probably would vaccinated could ravage body. Obviously option that's important context. literally thing hogs respond to. They'll get shot get owned libs. Interesting Way little, way late.  they'll claim censorship proof truth drive even believers them. Honestly clue things ended lot police officers wanting get vaccinated. think they'd want first line, fuss firefighters far tell education? Sympathy? It’s taking self-control assault maskless asshole random store, forget sympathy. literally article posted yesterday saying LESS problem thought. ridiculous, pick angle.  got infected January access vaccine. vaccinated now. Vaccination nothing long haul symptoms. Yeah, traveler nurses NYC making absurd amount money right often housing covered contracts, shock nurses retire young years. I'll believe see it. yep. limited amount sympathy/empathy.

On normal days without COVID, applied generously anyone.

On days people fuckin dying, everyone, limit actually trying make things better. Non-pharmaceutical measures. high immunity population acompanied vaccines. Refer title - times infections *as well as* higher post viral problems, want factor well. Else may underestimating problem, society, terms costs. Must nice. Meanwhile Americans don’t feel there’s enough data showing it’s safe. vaccinated prior infection? They’re kids throw temper tantrum tell get rain boots go outside it’s raining muddy. try blame holdup give in, also blame getting wet muddy. never grew up. national headline news. People can't even stick guns declaring they're ""never shopping again"" think capable getting fired bullshit? That's need booster shot. pfizer also need booster shot. participate sub think valuable resource. living document disinformation reaches people, spreads, leads inevitable effect. Screenshots saved social media scrubbed poster dies. week saw glimpse hospital room detailed informative (and frightening) news story I've seen far. say, people seeing first hand accounts via sub recognizing could future, getting vaccinated.

Where trouble comes edge lords think funny track accounts deliver additional grief mourning families. Whether think anti-vaxxer got deserved, inhumane decide grieving spouse, kids, parents deserve pain elevated due internet bullying. mention suspicion seeking HCA winners' social media name HCA sub may try get sub locked down, they're actually side argument.

Science- remember prescribed cigarettes. Look up. science. know know today it’s subject change. Hope y’all feel better spouting exact message other, zero empathy people’s deaths, people know nothing about. Well done!   Empathy sympathy often difficult traits nurture grow. That's reality it. Empathizing disagree often challenging, extremely rewarding. Hatred intolerance usually harm carrier directed to. are, part, people beat people read books back school years. I'm disrespecting dead, find outright mocking/taunting fact cruel too. *But* death also absolve people harm caused alive - posts usually highlight specifically people spread misinformation and/or actively antagonized vaccine advocates. moral/ethical high ground here. people intentionally flirting death mocking measures would prevent death. It’s debatable it’s unethical feel bad dying. Australia given 6.8 million doses far know 7-8 deaths. 1 100k sounds unlikely People look back period time utter disgust (even now) unrelenting selfishness unvaccinated.

You cannot serious.  vaccinating children. covid deaths among children rare ([Well .1% covid deaths according fairly good evidence long term side effects. historical precedent infectious diseases causing issues decades recover them.

Yes, academic research specific thing - simply reviewing existing information still form 'research' (and literature review basically first step planning novel experiment study, anyway).  Texas comparisons, would Flight 191 jet crashing landing DFW every single day September. 
 
Or, one Sutherland Springs church mass shooting 9 times day, every day.

People talk big time, never really get quite right. now. piss third audience. Safer play highlights last week    think we’ve enough people research. hard listen actual scientists? Good research. read somewhere compiled literature review wrote abstracts article. collected random sample sources performed independent probability statistics reported results. Next, took article one one looked source (author, publisher funder), critiqued writing logical fallacies, cognitive distortions plain inaccuracies. asked source might publish particular results. Lastly, followed trail references apply source scrutiny them. that's research done.    agree. Lock MF'er Fair, am, one sharing anecdotes. think foolish discount anecdotes hand, direct evidence occurring, data capture it. use at-home testing stunted data. I'll continue share, hope others too, actual experience. We've never starved ACTUAL data. wish ""only validated data"" told real story. Maybe coworkers would avoided situation. problem Fauci part cabal hate BeCeUsE eMaIlS. need authority figure anti vaxxers trust wont find trust grifters snake oil salesmen actually scientists. vicious cycle. Also many actually Healthcare providers. 5k employees Canadian hospitals 3% unvaccinated 0.2% unvaccinated Healthcare providers. Problem is, saying ""I research"" makes sound subjective, morans getting it.

Saying ""I looked realized science right"" validates used OBJECTIVE FACTS sorry I'm tired. That’s American way. 🇺🇸 75% eligible Americans received least one dose. Honestly, think thing left table convince 25% mandates. They’ve heard doctors, they’ve heard celebrities, athletes, religious leaders, people who’ve changed minds getting virus, even Trump told cult get it. else left hear from?  overstatement since California bounced around bottom five recent cases last ten days currently 49th. 30 minutes ago, got interview Physical Therapy position two skilled nursing facilities. Pre-vaccine, first facility lost 50 percent residents second facility (smaller, rural facility) lost 70 percent. 

I CANNOT understand somebody could work healthcare get vaccinated. Pre-vaccine scared shitless I'd infected asymptomatic kill half patients. got vaccinated, stress level greatly reduced. make sense. sure accurate. Lebron comes across thoughtful intelligent interviews might expect. I’m betting got vaccinated honestly recently. whole world taking vaccines, next negative issues. point, pure idiocy get it. Japan mask wearing ubiquitous never got bad there.  Terrible. 

Biden ashamed betraying hard working men women saved us last year, hailed heroes, torn fired careers made personal choice (and many already protection natural immunity, roughly 27 times stronger protection offered vaccines, danger get vaccinated). 

Shame Biden lying whether he'd mandate Vaccine. Shame government persecuting innocent people. shame hospitals representatives standing unity mandate. 

I'm absolutely pro vaccine, mandate oversteps, ruining lives removing people pay pandemic morally, ethically, repugnant. always fun argue stuff people think covid 19 big deal. Joe Rogan interview would reach right people ability speak make intelligent 😱 god's name would Oprah better lol

She's always huge boon anti-vaxxers, even covid.

[The share Americans say watch television via cable satellite plunged 76% 2015 56% year, according new Pew Research Center survey U.S. Shame much due diligence agreeing space jam. people pretentious conceited anti-vaxxers y’all ready conversation yet.  risk long term damage - death - covid outweighs risk potential side effects vaccinating kids. Especially children like mine autoimmune disorders need vaccine asap. damage mental health alone makes dicking around FDA unreasonable. already know 12+ group handling well. already know covid potential kill cause permanent long term damage. choice clear day weigh facts. even know certain myocarditis due vaccine statistically insignificant, that's safe been. 


90% FDA playing politics. search Wuhan Trump. Virtually every citation cited Trump source theory. heard claim many times. saying “Vaccinations don’t stop transmission” please. medical profession I’d really expect spread misinformation.

If don’t want feel like people shaming you, saying falsehoods pretty great way lose small amount high ground think have. would anyone want thorough testing vaccine kids disease little impact kids? FDA two companies double number kids test July obtain meaningful statistics heart problem. Fortunately heart problem shows within ten days second dose total time testing increase much. FDA behaved exactly disease killed less 500 kids 19 months. It’s perfectly reasonable skeptical. Especially vaccine released quickly. think released around March-April general public. doesn’t take 5-6 months research vaccine. 

There countless videos Dr. Fauci explaining made, it, works body, chances negative reaction, testing process able released quickly. information available read CDC, John Hopkins, different hospital websites, etc..It’s everywhere. 

I guess point shouldn’t taken long get vaccine excuse “doing research” doesn’t cut IMO. ?  upvoted? It’s misinformation. think respect ones quit, more. apparently believe enough they're willing sacrifice something. ones got save jobs apparently give shit anyone around obviously actual convictions jab. form mediums listened/watched, guarantee NPR one highest vaccination rates without question. Honestly tangible differences going compared February 2020 masks public reduced hours. night owl miss popping still-open grocery store midnight. Bro, lol, would imagine vaccine sceptic percentage pretty fucking low watch NPR. basically first X-Files movie, except alien virus. Sounds like we're clearing lot trash :-)

Looking forward job openings! drove SF Bay Area Peninsula way Walnut Creek. One hour way. 

Totally worth it.    Agree. Part thinks that’s schitck. needs loud make sometimes ridiculous takes that’s brand . talking maybe works. read full quote watch video specifically says it’s still personal choice, everyone’s body, etc. doesn’t want change anyone’s mind it…. doubt ever happen. little late. Idiot. Enough antivaxxers cleared every level *corporate* mandates remain place regardless.  claim came intelligence community, administration. That's Biden ordered take second look upon taking office - found initially postulated professionals, Trumpists.    odd 

Intentionally outrageous takes get people talking SAS outrageous takes. He's damn annoying plays role damn well. He's Peggy Hill sportscenter. brave anyone pay attention either way? point yes. care anymore. ruined lives killed countless people around world care less them.  obvious he's coming late party due pressure. wanted influence could've achieved months ago. NPR would reach target audience excuse actions pre-covid including limited vaccinated.  least one flu vaccination associated 17% reduction Alzheimer’s incidence. frequent flu vaccination associated another 13% reduction Alzheimer’s incidence.
Vaccination pneumonia ages 65 75 reduced Alzheimer’s risk 40% depending individual genes.”

Also I’ve heard survivors 1918 flu higher incidence Parkinson’s later on.

There’s got connection infections later brain issues. actually foremost lab studying bat coronaviruses. many labs would depend cutoff definitions. (BSL 3-4? coronaviruses? bat coronaviruses? live samples?) there's reason work niche exported ""bat lady"" Wuhan. There's reason lab data closest relative virus. started Wuhan, fair bit away range likely spillover bat species bat coronavirus lab located, actually significant evidence lab leak. people falsely equate evidence proof coincidence. certainly conclusive proof, evidence parsed coincidence. One major reasons non-CT nutjobs latched onto lab leak spammed ""there's evidence"", first factoid knew virus indeed evidence. also quite clear obsequious China outbreak started. Also Daszak ordering premature pledge scientists say definitely come lab (before anyone could evaluate that) gross, need CT nutjob smell conspiracy there.
I've leaned significantly away believing came lab 2021. never par ridiculousness people came pandemic. Lol “did research”. thesis Lebron? find peer reviewed version? obviously push agenda, let’s see vaccine passport believe he’s actually vaccinated. depends fired, state, etc. BS headline - closer 4% getting vaccine.
Not insignificant number. *I research.*

Oh fuck right off. Unless dropped league, went medical school many years get degree virology immunology, 'research' worth shit.

Listen doctors, scientists experts qualified research understood it. Listen them. Vaccines black community best friends. (the USA) pretty fucked shit. understand hesitation. They're splitting hairs quote find reasons hate him.  hope so. Kidneys thankfully one easier organs transplant well. third jab body's reaction like first (generally milder) second (more intense)? Curious flu symptoms increase body primed react decrease gets used vaccine. You’re welcome, Idaho Yeah it’s certainly concerning trend society overall. like this, please. know common viruses like common cold coronaviruses flu cause changes endothelium? NBA NHL. Unvaccinated NHL players able play Canada rules change vaccinated.  Honestly… “I research” bullshit going make people double “I mine too”.

Outside people medical degrees.., “research” bullshit term comes assessing vaccine.  Thank award  also standard enforced OSHA, emergency standards, holds 6 months date completion. 

People likely simply wait out. 

Mandates eventually gone.  understand saying, may give nudge ppl gotten vaccine see cost so. Probably worried swollen balls Everyone know CA got fully vaccinated. mean everyone! Def best decision career. backlash he'd get unvaccinated would immense.  There’s button think  175 less people spread covid around hospital patients maybe can’t vaccinated. Seems like good call.  much death! pharmaceutical magic potion--or perhaps one--that adults could take would stopped almost death!

OH WAIT

In seriousness, heartbreaking many people died short time. also heartbreaking people told, ""If things, things, lot folks going die,"" many doubled opposite. Weapons-grade defiance: respond Covid, result going get, every single time.  Lol. internet.

I think study logic. appears made assumption found arguments support conclusion.  citing published reports credible sources. please cite sources. I'm glad ""did \[his\] research"". Fully vaccinated people took pandemic measures seriously it, can't blame them. majority people wear masks indoors public, continue go dinner, go socialize see friends (without masks) go events whatnot.

Mercifully, deaths children low. prevent death, prevent hospitalization, reduce suffering, minimizing long-term complications safely…. not?

We're getting really theoretical here, somehow moves food, likely destination saliva. That's still going way nasal tract. almost definitely going throat mouth. case, coronavirus entering mouth/nose much scary droplet aerosol form attached physical object ground swallowed help saliva. even touch viral load another huge factor successful infection. COVID happens inhale bunch aerosols droplets viral load big enough overcome body's defenses. probably converse infected person minute trouble, spending 15 minutes talking puts lot danger. someone COVID literally coughs sneezes food hands directly you, yeah, that's problem. huge chain unlikely events happen get sick food. Someone capable spreading COVID cough/sneeze/breathe enough coronavirus onto food make sick. Enough virus make sick successfully attach food. Then, enough virus make sick survive food eat it. eat it, enough virus make sick detach food stay mouth/throat without swallowed. Then, enough virus make sick make way high nasal tract, even though aerosolized form capable so. impossibility, incredibly unlikely something stress about.

People like say they're ""victims misinformation,"" ways might be. they're also actively spreading misinformation themselves. least I've never heard Telegram, I'm Reddit FB lot, even around crazies.

The average person going end there.  Ethicist? Isn’t ethics unique individual?  I've personally seen plenty mocking actual deaths sub. Reddit used packed folks mocking obese people actually. person talking espouses anti-mask/Vax rhetoric left continue so. Nice.   folks cheering videos taken bitching Google regarding GME, ultimately far stupid fully grasp implication. We’re fuckin doomed isn’t greedy elite virus that’ll get us. We’re fit free One word: policies. 

California decided follow science ended paying useless recall election. 

Florida decided follow failed politics citizens ended paying lives health. vaccine free, testing free, no, number insurance companies covering treatment costs time. federal mandate cover vaccines tests, treatment. Many insurers covering treatment early on. safe free vaccines easy get everywhere, don’t reason cover treatment costs completely avoidable majority people. 

95-99% COVID ICU patients unvaccinated. It’s quite common see unvaccinated people pass families post GoFundMes pay part bills. 

We universal healthcare one pay tremendous sums care. case it’s huge part COVID population actively denying free vaccine would keep safe hospitals. It’s challenging issue comes coverage. GOP supporters lost minds last 40 years. Things started getting really bad Reagan so-called ""moral majority"", got even worse Tea party idiots, culminated moronic Trumpsters. actively trying create theocracy here, hiding it. people threat America terrorist group Earth, stop even trying reason them, since nothing lie. caused them. believe supposed stop morning sickness.

(Edited add - anti-vaxxer! I’m vaccinated happy it. Still using mask well)  Right. one gets sub unvaccinated purely ""victim"" misinformation. get sub actively spreading misinformation, get attention asshole it. 

This ""fuck feelings crowd,"" yet we're supposed coddle them. antivaxxers starting trend go hospitals, believing vents kill them.


That sounds like excellent trolling. Whoever started genius problem solver. facebook worse whatsapp? book available audiobook? getting downvoted lol, people thread lunatics man. I’m vaxxed support vax censoring free speech accomplish anything?

Would curious consider Jonathan Isaac’s recent comments Orlando Magic “misinformation.”

All said natural immunity isn’t worried low risk since he’s young, don’t worry they’ll end censoring it. 2 years fucking late! shouldnt applauded null achievment. Right, know YouTube private corporation they. want, even sort classifies medical misinformation regarding vaccine. problem calling plaguebearers, though, plaguebearers smart...  can't really measure likely someone get virus exposure can't track exposures.

What track many people show sick vaccinated vs. unvaccinated shows 95% unvaccinated. Ima start mocking obese, type 2 diabetics now, surprising  database doctors indicate kind patients nobody else treat them. shit harder :)   article shitty. ethicist commenting medical community, Reddit.

One people interviewed said HCA ""social cudgel."" That's far astute, makes less sexy headline. used term loosely that's bad, I'm South Florida major city, rural area. humans survival instinct. mock belittle endanger species tentatively saying OK work survival species. 

So yeah, sympathy anti-vaxers die covid, see problem working out. dose first two shots - 100 micrograms  Cool. sure comment explaining situation uncivil whatever. self-righteous crusade ""push science"" completely ceases noble start celebrating death *anybody*.

If wish truly virtuous, maybe start reflecting insist vindictive petty.  amount nurses saying things really disturbing sheer fuckery, I'd like see Joe Rogan's YouTube channel affected this. realise he's moved Spotify, still makes coin posting clips YouTubes.  think clearest evidence many data sources state federal level including countries show 95% new cases among unvaccinated 5% among vaccinated. really explanation besides vaccine works.  Screw people. fact, know doctors hate giving patients bad news? I'll PAY hospital let one tell anti-vax/anti-mask/Covid deniers going die Covid. deny it, yell me, tell fake whatever want. wipe smile face. think preferred delivery would ""Hey dumbass. gonna die blame.

Good Stuff. might even disastrous, much discourse surrounding rights perversely purposefully severed equivalent discourse responsibilities. freely admit great deal variety American founding fathers believed, whether public debate private, one would likely look vain writings anything like ""you're main character, fuck everyone else."" ethical coerce otherwise pressure people receive medical treatments consent to? submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Here's article halting spread cult preventing cult acquiring new membership, curing cult members already infected antivax brain worms. deplatforming effort.

Think deplatforming almost like digital vaccine, actually. help people already sick, stop new people getting sick.  Yeah, work. anywhere near good pretty much others. 563 67,000 employees currently non-compliance list.  

Making staff 99.2% compliant policy? Well done, United Airlines!  Arent coronavirus related medical expenses free?   really come majority perfect moment make new platform, need anyways.

But (YouTube) want they'll continue toe line eternity. ""The South"", rural areas everywhere. expect research like child? Use google, comes right up. I've corresponded people vary skeptical totally opposed. think vaccine ""too new"" matter say like reason. 

The people I've talked totally opposed believe CDC, FDA, government general incompetent, corrupt, etc basically believe anything say. includes Fauci, Biden, scientist seems agreement etc. think draws fringe data sources like Facebook activist conspiracy theory. Basically refuse read believe information source would call reputable. Seems BIT late forced watch YouTube? understand logic also think opens another worms. example, grandad smoked entire life knowing majority risk cancer much higher, eventually got cancer smoking hospital long time died. logic applied antivaxxers denied medical treatment? knowingly ignored medical advice ended taking hospital space could gone someone else chose smoke. seems like complex issue. highlighting unethical dangerous behavior

They're not. They're saying people mocking cruel part. ""highlighting"" unvaccinated people's dangerous behavior. got one well. guy called plague rat mocking laughing women lost parents COVID didn’t. Facebook pro-plague. find cruel all. find quite validating actually. dying irresponsible probably assholes facets life. good people. Sure, misinformed regret choices way out. seem double-down. 

I've never felt bad people all. would I? exactly want beginning end. I'm merely observer. amazing twisted people become head ass long. pathetic, mourn innocents take along way. 

These people complain pandemic going 2 years. whole pandemic believe exists. unfathomably stupid every way. I'd say trash sorting out. Sure, education probably root cause come on.. can't figure ""mystery"" pandemic good riddance. useful anyways? 

I uncle hospital weeks. Released, still getting vaccine. could keel tomorrow care less. disconnect, kind people trying attribute type behavior innocent ignorance. isn't. 

This full sail jumping fucking cliff yelling believe gravity way down. would feel bad someone wants jump cliff.. go jump cliff. live died. selfish waste human existence bothered look 5 seconds realize damage they're inflicting around them. Fuck em. I'm glad they're dying. deserve it. I'm tired stupid people I'm tired pretending bad thing support stupid decisions obviously lead deaths. like 20 months later you’re something. Thanks guess. Oh, good thing took swift action country became national embarrassment Covid. /s post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

If everyone chance vaccinated (which, high school students eligible vaccination), see issue is. like kids forced attend. They're low risk disease anyway, kids high risk families stay home. Teenagers going hang hook close anyway, regardless whether school sanctioned not. least reduce time they're sucking resources ethically even going them. They're ones get put high positions influence high turnover, stifling workers' rights. least turnover screeched instantaneous halt, now. Watching rich squirm effects wickedness treat. fair question.

And let anti vaxxers create social media spaces. 

Eventually masses fall away echo chambers. all, anti vaxxing really less belief look-at-me-stand-out-in-a-crowd behavior. Censorship. hot right now. When's moderna booster?? need get home thanksgiving would like take two weeks prior. Finally. Sadly, that’s incredibly unlikely here. pro-vax pro-mask family members disowned kicked family (also attended different church choose “unacceptable” spouse.). live town mostly populated cult. what's solution here?

Also, posters doctors, cares ""medical ethics""? point research shows waining t-cell/b-cell protection?

None data found shows serious waining t-cell protection, touches vaccines efficacy prevent serious outcomes. year half late, oh well. keep politics it?

A company click whatever buttons want website  Hmm WoOoOW took them.....nearly 2 years....yeah get fucked think deserve praise late pandemic.

There's several people know trust vaccines. finally gotten first shots seeing people know die this. got put there. Talk people trying live pathetic lives children, screwing well. Oddly enough, interview Eric Schmidt ATLANTIC yesterday. 

""Schmidt: It’s pretty clear things humans good at, one cascade information"" Took long enough.  kind argument kind like ""perfect enemy good"".

In grander scheme things, need get vaccine info youtube social media general. Doctors oversell vaccines proper journalists already over-report side effects. “Oh well channel watching got banned, guess changes thinking I’ll go get vaccinated now”

It’s amazing quickly Reddit flips laughing failed attempts ban things lead Streisand effects, calling banning stuff like think work. Exactly. Saying deplatforming ""doesn't work"" always way people spread lies screwed logic ""vaccines work still get covid."" popularity reach platform severity disease important respective differences.   people sick COVID-19, Regeneron, $ Ronny D's contributors. anti-vaxxer know hospital 6 weeks. questions drugs procedures kept alive. he's home months later still unwell, business ruined can't work. view vaccines? ""Still unsure"". Oh look come pearl clutchers. missed anti-vaxxers literal screaming meltdowns sharing insane memes people getting vaccinated, making fun choices?

Christ, guys, concern trollers real picky care don’t think it’s much “too late” failing recognize banning things doesn’t make disappear. damn time. year two late...  Excellent comment. 


Let's forget violence death threats anti-vaxx perpetrating. longer matter ""choice."" become fight domestic terrorism. many people nowadays trouble differentiating things actually believe in, things resonate them/they identify with. eschew belief choosing instead “believe” things identify with. That’s amount rational proof convince change mind. HCA personification that, showcasing people choose follow memes instead logic professionals. Little late there, guys.  “Let die” doesn’t feel good shouldn’t feel good you.

You say done ever think YouTube banning shit help. proven work time time again. People comments prime example it’s “not surprising”   Nothing. Still free speech.  government protecting Youtube lawsuits via section 230, government-protected monopoly regulated such.

Why? Section 230 protects YouTube way protects personal website. protected monopoly landscaping. Anyone start video site allows anti-vaccine videos. 

Hauling execs 'regulate themselves' inaccurate. Half government wondering regulate all.

Should government redefine regulate potential monopolies, absolutely. really question here. anything market prime competitors since FAANG, etc. feeling pressure going grabbing small competitors.

I commend YouTube. anti vaccine sister lives 400,000 home Tennessee. I'm saying all. think shortages already, no? around parts. 

I’m hoping next class (who likely vaccinated) fill open positions.  happened free speech totally start targeting businesses. that, maybe lock ghettos. work, maybe put work camps start discussing final solution....

There ways spread cautionary tale try best educate. (though all, course) I've seen matter comes across vindictive (the word ""rage"" gets thrown around), seem come good place, intent entertain celebrate suffering others (whoever may be). perception bothers me. Hot take.

I agree.

It's unethical. Canada's first dose fully vax rate level top 5 states US. Like Vermont/CT/Maine/Mass levels. get responses here. really expect people trust CDC infallible they've verifiably wrong walked back statements COVID several times? okay try verify stuff. No, Alex Jones whoever count reliable source, act like ""research"" word use degree. better worse, First Amendment prevents government acting upon medical opinion, even incorrect?

Under Section 230 however, centralized platforms allowed power said them. Half family believes shit. Can't trust either. He’s innocent friends family antivaxxers likely prod along even further. seem run packs like hyenas. time every 100,000 Floridians, 70 residents died summer, every 100,000 Californians, 12 residents died.

Florida recorded 14,334 COVID-19 deaths summer — worst tally state. California recorded 4,874.

Covid response disgrace “People babies”

Trump simply said name fish pharmaceutical loud barely even 24 hours later people dead taking it. think either incredibly naive haven’t met lot people, that’s case I’m sorry, willfully ignorant caught personal ideals lying rather admit something believe causing irreparable harm death across entire country.

You wrong. People babies especially comes politics. people ICU beds right dying covid swearing doctors believe it. sit contradict scared treatment hasn’t properly studied jump onto different treatment hasn’t properly studied, HUGE RED FLAG you. it’s not. reason you’re ignoring pretending it’s happening. YouTube right thing people like ignorant reality, consciously not, making shit worse. agree, think told so. real info leads getting vaccinated. Hopes prayers. Along lines one friends agreed seek treatment cancer he's going get lifetime smoking. Great guy. I'll miss him. able distinguish pre-print peer reviewed paper basing life it, good luck. True, YouTube recommendations full bullshit anymore NY NJ special cases. highly dense urban populations use crowded subway system. got hit early hospitals figured best treatment well vaccine. 
Now states warnings, time prepare, treatment protocols figured highly effective vaccine. 

If sates still end NY NJ numbers reveals bigger failure leadership personal responsibility population. ""Vaccination rates slowed 56 percent U.S. population two shots, compared 71 percent Canada 67 percent United Kingdom.""

All countries get YouTube, maybe issue education system US teaching critical thinking skills?  ethicist like ""oh no! Anyway!"" unsubscribe that. much. audience they've enjoyed now.

Where outrage articles people killing Americans tanking economy. Maybe world renowned ethicist examine behavior let us know come with. 

Tldr: fuckem care anyone else. define anti-vaccine person/camp?

All I've heard cautionary admitting health dangers people everyone talk doctor decide themselves. Darwinism work   article sketchy fuck, prepared give chance going it, it’s quite literally “alright let’s write article defense anti-vaxxers make seem like people use Reddit unnecessarily mean poor, poor, misunderstood people. Let’s leave memes way laugh constantly belittle got vaccinated right got covid every time, paint anti-vaxxers sad light” way.

Quite literally “bothsidesing” pandemic giving anti-vaxxers equal light. Knowingly spreading novel virus negligence stubbornness killing thousands people pretty cruel too, tbh. would bet ethicist would claim denying someone healthcare coverage don’t job health insurance would cruel necessary part glorious society. wish would ban offensive far right ads. They’ll get pissy deplatforming proven track record     Oh worry Joe f@cking Rogan yet spew anti vax poisonous murderous nonsense.  happy cake day  Facebook stoked engagement stuff gets ad rev pulls in, zero interest taking particular horse long gone barn... I've seen plenty headlines percentage doctors vaccinated.

Any health care worker rates (prior mandate like anti-vaxxers quickly write coercion) really much right line (or worse) general population.

I'd argue showing unvaccinated employers bluffing powerful motivator. Awesome!! remove predators exploitive family channels, thanks Youtube!  doubt gas station 100 employees, may exempt. Don’t forget role Fox News. me, one same. Weird jumped comment other, far explicit ones post. That's kind weird. called Accel research days ago (where part vaccine trial) told would distribute vaccine trial volunteers order administered first shot. 

I guess get earlier access shot weeks thinking everyone else gonna get it. try stay pretty impartial silly beliefs. believed lot dumb things child never want feel like I’m high horse. decided Covid share pictures daughter family Facebook I’m glad don’t mass text message actual conversations haha.
It obviously come hangups, feel like understand people little better that’s always goal. Understanding. friend mine vaccinated died COVID-19. 40, MS. 3 kids, taught junior high small southern town shit vaccination record, kids wear masks right grown-ups make fun tell necessary. assholes killed her. already announced would - twice!

Not sure actually carried thru not? cruel subject people idiocy selfishness “choice” get vaccinated.  “Other People Matter Me”

I’m going start using one  people spent past almost 2 years everything power fight things would help decrease transmissions, infections, death. I’m fucks give seems cruel someone mock people. ain’t Jesus, Buddha. Reap sow. spent lot time considering decision now, 2 years horses ran away, decided close barn door. 

PLease everyone pat back forward thinking sage decision. prevent death, they? Hey now, that's fair disgusting fetish. feel like people's mistrust government well placed. fully trust government must paid attention corruption things fuck up. issue people use logic reasoning see even someone trustworthy might best interest mind times chance interests align. like can't post videos internet anymore, youtube.

It's akin saying ""Harper-Collins print sell book more, equivalent book burning."" We've explaining year. let idiots teach false science public schools - force go create school contains damage. Aside outright throwing jail (which really happen intentionally lying causing deaths), next best thing contain spread. photo nice quaratine hotel frightens you?

I'm mama two little ones, (6 &amp; 3), I'm shitting bricks, tbh. relax till make kiddie vax get arms. told present photo ID enter bar order drink

You sound like advocate Voter ID. Unsubscribe? It’s like post /all MLM adherents tend 40-something Karens using side hustle nursing days.  Okay dude, clearly massive bias blame you. saying I'm searching studies pertain life potentially getting COVID vaccinated outlook like.

Sorry happened trying start fight one. Real antivaxxers would long documented history suspecting vaccines toxic, voicing years.

This sisters. They've annoying vaccines various homeopathic fads two decades, say there's situation really challenged belief system involved ton risk them. we're pandemic, they're sticking guns *of course* basing entire identities years ignorant bullshit, they're actively endangering kids parents. basically makes want never speak despite us otherwise normal sibling relationships.  Agreed, big part problem new virus initially little known much assumed wrong. changes brought new variants. public messaging ""experts"" often obsolete within weeks message changed. people good noting whether reading new older information confusion escalated. Plus God knows politicization came from, really added mess. people telling want believe. blamed, note anti movement seems worldwide.

Bottom line agree think there's much chance fix it. pay attention well read able stay top everyone else....not much. Deplatforming works. highly doubt it... far things look grim Facebook right, youtube dealt vaccine misinformation 225 years ago mean company threw gala Brett Kavanaugh? pretty doubtful   Well, good luck wise choice, dont think good idea. give ammo saying censored.  feel bad y'all go right now. venom hurled health care workers lab techs disgusting.

At point, getting bad case covid seems like personal choice. two things, really sympathy people getting badly sick. 34% here. None families gonna vax 6-13 children per family.

They gonna keep “celebration life” potlucks people die Covid inside, unmasked.  like everyone justifying mocking dead people lol it’s good thing. like people generally kind either. simple fact always shared multiple articles downplaying, ignoring pandemic usually threatening violence response government's restrictions pretty telling are. used work woman 70s thought everyone's Facebook feed same, like TV channel. imagine lot older people thinking way, give anything comes along weight said Walter Cronkite back day. Ha.

Facebook right thing exhausting every option fighting every plea change. *sighs*

Welcome Reddit.. amount rage behalf Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander players state National leagues, cannot adequately described words.

Every season, EVERY season, elevating game incredible athleticism resilience. would argue helped build game know love today. professional leagues leaned Indigenous populace long good players, care they're treated like property, worse. I'm continually disgusted way treated fans. mean, pushed Goodesy retirement. might another season two treated gods damned respect. bigger problem, far, Facebook. 

And guarantee Facebook get even worse now, fury YouTube's decision going get dumped. agree clear context. ""both sided"" specifically pandemic. 

I get science messy, especially dealing social science things, virology generally one things. might understand particular virus behaves transmits, understand lot various methods available them. YouTube done December anti-vaxx rhetoric gained traction. know people get long Covid breakthrough cases though? continue cautious even getting shots. Everyone seems focused survival rate that's bad thing happen Covid. 

As relatively young, healthy person I've never worried dying Covid. chronic pain know hopeless depressing live long term health issue. idea getting long Covid losing taste smell months end way scarier me. going they're censored first place  Well first mistake still facebook. Cut cord. something earth shattering happens someone immediate inner circle, hear without social media. tldr schools continue require masks. Source? speech include freedom consequences.

If ''consequences'' censored speech absofuckinglutely does. 100% correct. HCA mocks people push anti vaccination memes stories eventually die COVID19. seen mocking ""hesitant"" people dying COVID19.  really 

But eschew real medical technology rely prayer stupid Thanks me! mock mock drunk driver gets killed auto accident, save sympathy people might hurt drunk agree censorship like but, sholy hit, eejits need stuff fudge let smart people talking.

 
They even contradict themselves. ""The virus real!"" then, ""The vaccines work!"" Okay, one fudge it, dewtyhead?

Edit - edit civil get trouble automod.   Elvis getting polio vaccine convinced lot people it. large bunch society always looked celebrities.  tell read article without telling read article.  That's basically advertising works imo, target audience, case right leaning viewers , show ads maximal return. should’ve done year ago. late point guess better never. Yeah education country could way better, got someone like Betsy DeVos put power wanted set everything back. Sometimes place hopeless  simply feasible reasonable ask. Post-vaccination certain level antibodies general population really necessary, thankfully countries see things way. I'm sorry either immunocompromised elderly get vaccinated wear good mask concern. censorship. platform owned business, right decide content goes not. fair, Fauci probably looked 6th grade math since like 1950.   1. class, kids, especially high risk kids, wearing masks, risk low. high risk kids also vaccinated, even get COVID, chances hospitalized slim none. 


2. kids going sit home there's homecoming dance. They're going go parties, hang out, sit other's basements, go sports practices, etc. Cancelling homecoming prom likely make minimal difference many kids contract COVID course year. Again, outbreak 8 cases. actually think mocking dead loved ones loves ones dying going bring closer agreeing you? literally worse are. I'm vaccinated, guess what, grandpa ventilator 8 days 2 days they're taking off. doc says less 15% chancr survival. incredibly ant vaxx paid price. lesson mockery teach ant Vax family members death didn't? disgusting. Yeah lots people doubting 'long covid' 

not sure people thread pretending never happened Yea wants cake eat too. you’re famous, you’re famous. doesn’t get choose stop famous. I'm well under. CDC says fine regardless age, based risk I'm state extremely high transmission.   Mainly people literally ""Fucking around finding out"" Legal slavery. It'd like Busch running nationwide campaign driving drunk dangerous, people drink Busch kill car accident.

That said, I'm lawyer, idea there's legal case there.  Legal slaves.  I've witnessed antivaxx logic via colleague last year. people completely disingenuous. First get approved, EUA issue, got fully approved mRNA something, spurious bullshit fertility, need boosters statistics show vaccinated people get infected well. people make bad faith arguments actively try put people getting vaccinated. zero sympathy them, I'm shed tear antivaxx evangelists croak unwillingness take vaccine Africa crying presently. Got third last night. think arm notice mild soreness. Significantlyyyyy less soreness 2.  happened Videos created. little late now.

Asking friend! mocking dead people, also living too. Bring awareness dumbass rhetoric they're pushing negative consequences it. year half shit. first threw fits masks, lockdowns, vaccine, 3. exhausting take chance point go them, ruining everything literally everyone.  I’d say they’re equal. Quite often it’s YouTube vids shared FB. 

The YouTube algorithm messed right up. Im I’m pro vaccine get YouTube history show that. feed always antivax shit mixed in. example Russel Brand, fairly tame antivax sympathizer. curious clicked couple them. made sure thumbs definitely never subscribed. he’s always near top feed. Every night. also see conspiratorial ones sprinkled throughout.

It’s enough make wonder there’s another reason. it’s probably used subbed Joe Rogan (dropped came antivax) I’m also MMA channels. (rampant antivaxxer types) yea guilty pleasure, Aliens…But I’m subbed plenty quality science channels watched tons videos suggest I’m pro vaccine. 

Why getting antivax shit still?? refuse believe they’re purpose. It’s Silicon Valley crying loud. algorithm straight broken. Like we’re accidentally brainwashing people here, it’s insane! 

Both parents, total liberal hippies. Walking around naked time 80s (it gross). Radicalized YouTube rabbit holes. They’re climate change deniers, pro gun, anti abortion, anti Muslim, whole works man. They’re FB too. know fact YouTube FB. Pumping outrage encourages binge watching. Unbelievable incompetence part YouTube. created huge god damn problem name money it’s going bite us all. Facebook they’re much blame I’m sure. You’re getting rid either platform, that’s pipe dream. hope fix it. Deleting antivax videos good step right direction. Hope more. hate idea censorship something done! *Please spare Godwin's law. slippery slopes towards slavery.* 

Pretty soon performing tasks exchange credits, get enough credits able enter certain buildings enjoy certain activities.

With Youtube automatically pushing similar content user base, magnifying impact disinformation. Youtube responsible disseminating disinformation, taking steps accordingly. little fucking late that. wonder determinates what's misinformation. mean, doctors, nurses, nutritionist, etc YouTube staff? hope people don’t agree drunk driving. Common sense. Vaccines? Personal choice. Completely different things. grow worry yourself. Don’t try control bully others getting vaccine don’t want. infected Covid, virus affects lungs gonna weakened lungs. moment put ventilator weakened body saves energy first thing gives lungs simply machine work  I’m ‘ethicist’. Mock away! morons deserve it. Save sympathy need it. know says headline? Reading article. Unfortunately hospitals publish exact figures. ever entertained idea may moron swallowed regurgitated advertising propaganda? Well like half comments calling people spam call him, least seems scummy  given medical realm 

Me making video basement giving advice bad people illegal, though. Unless actually selling product hurts you, illegal say think. point I've seen several people make claim doctors either letting people die actively killing covid money.   Censorship slippery slope   Youtube private business ban anyone want.  sheer number depressing. sub 1,800 ""awards"".

That's 1,800 people get vaxxed, bragged social media, died ones people found posted sub.

At one point guy made montage award members snarky ""I care got vaccine"" emblem around profile pics, pictures going fire one another. video 4 minutes long many them. Nothing wrong ad itself, even annoying. Sad need ads it.

Anyway, ethical part categorize ideologies apply ads differently based it. feels weird.

Look, field probably normal fine reasons know. rubbed wrong way started think it. Yeah conversation last night w someone used really care somehow bought anti-vax conspiracies. told he’s objectively wrong there’s quantifiable data prove he’s wrong. said “both sides think they’re correct, really know” !!????!!!!!!!! *Quantifiable data, hard facts, things know true*. mean, know right!? 

And ridiculous counter point everything said. mentioned government doesn’t need go way get masses ingest something. control water supply, soil grows food, etc like “But they’ve already tried failed”. just... felt defeated disappointed like nothing could say would get change mind.  cruel. You’re shitty person.  mom texted back tell uncle died suddenly Covid. wasn’t vaccinated. don’t relationship family anymore. They’re kinda morons… that, knew better say I’m sorry loss. That’s decent thing do.

The double effect real. Best way keep people digging heals point fingers mock. OK Sinclair Walmart uses power sway political social issues?  ones posters harassing comments dead relatives? Totally agree you, censorship blinds real issue. Let idiots freedom speech, let others bully idiocy. anti vaxxer spends time talking normal people likely become educated. ban anti vaxxers forced misinformation safe spaces become worse. So, right genetics sound science selective breeding sound application. Eugenics neither things. Check radio lab's G series interested. Yeah I'd inclined read studies since I'm concerned physical long haul symptoms. Depression anxiety already given want know lungs heart permenantly damaged. think lot! I've certainly come across Covid positive people since March, whether store restaurant whatever, tested positive (or least symptoms requiring get tested). need read Woodward's new book time then.

I'm triple vaccinated. lockdowns enough yet, there's logic ever ending them, I'm realizing life short would rather risk whatever minor risk COVID, booster shot is.  I'm done living way. ""Some months"" already 18 months logical end sight.  Time get life. Life risky, that's way is.   Lol deserve every bit Hugs know, right?

You act like decision ice cream liked more.

They promoting deadly propaganda. 

And need include every single reference NEVER EVER LIE vauge ""difference opinion based personal wants"". 

This proves understand anything here, despite initial claims say opposite introduction. 

Your truth comes eventually. state majority vaccinated (top 5 country) regulations. Everything’s open basically mask wearing. pre-Covid lifestyle. daily positives daily deaths keep going up. Vaccination alone? It’s working. correlational. know comes first mechanism (which bacteria help create neurotransmitters, happening direction). Yes know there's studies following fecal transplants also compare treatment usual counterbalance another treatments. suggestion treated lead improvements. question compare treatments placebo, treatment waitlist. 

Also fish oils vitamin C much gut health.

At best say need fatty acids build myelin sheaths around neurons like fish oils make smarter anything like that. ""paves road"" can't make new connections you. seems like HermainCainAward shut down? think good, let say please. Though vaxxed fairly liberal recently reflecting lot came this: 
""some people offended people acknowledging reality people lying misinforming people causing die.""- feels black white, life often grey. Death, including awful one (even one's naivety/ignorance) something celebrate mock every one people human probably loved loved ones mourning. Pointing shooting disinformation important, mocking death not.

I pointed twice. Spectrum (thus supposedly lacking Empathy) suddenly realized writing literal Empathy others vastly differing views own. kept getting down-voted though...for view expressed Empathy, supposed part human-condition/a goal loving humans obtain. find least excessively interesting (presumably mostly) liberal people situations concerned ""being right"" thus negative/down-voting seeing chance Empathy.

I wish well. applied expanded booster criteria. application processing likely hear next weeks. Gotta replace ones they're losing?

...Okay, might going far. I'm sorry hear that.

I thought might find similar situation cousin (is?) antivax. However, get vaccinated COVID.

I asked changed mind, suspect initial reason antivax, something diseases issues active threats (measles, example, notwithstanding measles coming back anti-vaxxers like him). also normal BS vaccines safely tested big pharma profits like, paled comparison real threat COVID. Essentially, initial cost benefit analysis dramatically changed face visible increased risk.

I suppose also worth mentioning lives SF Bay Area, covid denialism part political identity.   Cruel? Lmao  mind? I’m Australian I’ve shocked absence laws US forcing people behave responsibly.

You're surprised? country believes answer school shootings put guns hands teachers.   absolute shit comparison.

Yeah - researchers doctor evaluated connected person's infection, maybe then, thus study look diagnosis anxiety/depression 90-180 day period. used ICD-10 codes F30-F39 (‘Mood disorders’) F40-F48 (‘Anxiety, dissociative, stress-related, somatoform nonpsychotic mental disorders’). cover much stuff really count long covid.

Collectively people forced us responsible people keep wearing masks, watch loved ones get sick ide etc. mean ""don't jump bridge might die, people saying tell I'm jumping"" telling others jump too. problem many European countries reaching number due anti-vaxxers and/or vaccine skepticism. far European country numbers close Portugal, even talking eligible population. Spain maybe, bit less Italy totally depends define ""long covid"". define experiencing symptom least window 3-6 months initial infection, include symptoms like anxiety depression, study article based did, get higher incidence rate define ""long covid"" mean recurring symptoms, use narrower list symptoms categorically tied covid.

The truth is, know yet. Regular, healthy people get symptoms like anxiety depression, muscle pain, diarrhea persistent headaches time time. someone begins experiencing one symptoms recovering covid, symptom ""long covid"", two unconnected things happened 6-month time period? time, definite answer.

Other studies compare rate symptoms control group rate post-covid group, might give clearer answer. Well horse left, we're gonna waste it! [I've train state that?  Yes, people won’t follow anti-vax content creators another platform unless platform flashy acceptable UI.

Even then, Parlor’s return App Store, retains fraction users  rather somewhat disabled covid wait months Lockdown, kind ""logic""is that?? Unless turns causal link.  Portugal less individualistic society.

I live Netherlands partner lives Portugal. travel much worst parts pandemic, post-vaccine, able come bit often. Netherlands individualistic culture Portugal, much closer US fact. using [Hofstede source ""individualistic"", way.

It certainly case Portuguese follow rules guidance closely Dutch. many protests, people wearing masks stores despite mandate, conspiracy theories copied verbatim US NL sometimes painful paying attention news worst parts pandemic.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* little late. Dozens misleading. Could 24, could 144. likely wide range doses would ""work"" people; finding best one hard (and likely active area mRNA vaccine research going forward).  I've seen reports dose picked adults likely high side (the phrase ""highest tolerable dose"" used); likely gives better immune response older people likely larger necessary produce good immune response adults.  

Chances good 10 microgram dose proposed 5-11 would still work well 12 twentysomething (and might fewer side effects), tested yet 12+ still get 30 now.

Moderna testing lower doses adults well (stepping 100 50 micrograms current booster proposal, press releases web site even smaller doses adults well).   Thank hard work. see you, hear you. appreciate you. fact odds still going gives hope. support you? Okay determines misinformation. surprised delete content correct goes narrative vaccines free risk. Nope. stay away keep business usual. That's thing, one saying feel bad. 

The issue celebrating deaths, wishing deaths, trying dox individuals.

The sub that's center needs shutdown perfect world, users banned. Globally, social media little positive/negative uptake information covid. Unless think US country world, rest world seems getting fine. Social media presents true issue, certain governments making pigs ear covid messaging i.e. fauci saying wear masks saying wear two masks, certain politicians saying trust vaccines Trump heading process, politicians saying trust vaccines Biden heading process, calling Trump's travel ban xenophobic rather public health interest etc. etc.

Also, ban misinformation one topic there's nothing stopping banning misinformation every topic. Sounds orwellian allowing anyone, government company, decide allowed said.  Actually prayers answered...WITH vaccine would fine. weird see correlation actually take it. Talk whatever want! countless websites, blogs, social media outlets, streaming video sites, chat apps, etc. gonna sad day deaths mount. can't continue wait areas longer. entire country continues punished kicking morons. Enough enough. Let experience full wrath. rest us time move fuck on. Yes totally, least start right direction hopefully cause domino effect social media follow suit future.

Fingers crossed. would useful March 2020 heroes wear capes.   kinda insane we're past peak (currently) overall hospitalizations 1-2 weeks ago. 2600 hospitalized compared winter peak 3400 previously. 

Only 34%~ ICU capacity used well. 

Definitely tells bad staffing situation we're 2100~ hospitalizations. also turn TikToker.  referred fact everyone encouraged get vaxx ""crime century""? asked clarify say ""I'm exaggerating"" ""it's descriptive"" (aka opinion fact).

I would exactly call ""telling people decide themselves"" sad see people worried ego right life another. It’s sickening one coming senses. wish gotten vaccine. wish didn’t underestimate virus. wish didn’t try spin political moment. mocking demise saying “they got coming them” extremely disheartening. people laugh others loss disgusting say least.  I'm numb care anymore. Hopefully leave behind kids kids least smart enough learn stupid shit parents did. old saying 'the apple fall far tree' seems case days. Ugh, know pretty topic need shout nobody. partner went dad's wedding past weekend one person vaccinated, one month old home trying careful.

Yesterday, shortly getting home, partner got notice covid exposure class work Thursday (the day left trip). feel pretty iffy, partner starting yesterday morning, starting late last night. Sore throats, coughs, runny noses, mild sickness symptoms partner day ahead symptoms compared me. got home test, anxiously awaiting results. We're hoping god comes back negative. going fun announcement make comes back positive, better gotten month old kid sick... Would feel absolutely awful, even though there's way could known exposure notices get sent back... Nu uh. Texas full. Try Oklahoma. That's exactly consume conspiracy theories. I'm drinking horse medicine snorting essential oils either. I'm hunting Bigfoot Batboy cure COVID. Worst case scenario fun story think I'm stoned. Maybe smart aunts/uncles take ""for ice cream"" Vaccines. Misinformation warfare. people weaponized misinformation.

It time least stop giving weapons make use own.

Being opposition science, medicine, empathy others equally reasonable opposing science, medicine, empathy.

These people radical extremists. apparently yelling fire crowded theater perfectly okay long Republican, Republicans claim isnt illegal, think privately owned theater shouldnt allowed anything person. reading lines, videos longer generating enough revenue YouTube keep up.

I guess either people ""research"" need videos awful lot people would watch longer magically watching these. wonder happening segment population. Hmm? Yes average (of states) 1.58x times higher official count. sure that's weighted average states multiplier average out. know higher 1.58x California though.  sounds like self righteous bullshit people never even bothered flu shot. otherwise healthy refuse get vaccinated, cannot feel sorry you. idiotic decisions affect EVERYONE.

This cruel. Refusing work together community, b.c aunt posted something facebook. 

that cruel. laughing people could avoided pain, suffering death? yeah, particularly cruel. like laughing someone tripping. Yeah, laughing misfortune. reality misfortune could easily avoided.  Tell saw Facebook WITHOUT TELLING saw Facebook     Like vaccine. Ah... bad vaccine hesitancy Toronto? assumed major urban centres Canada fairly well.

I also get people get lesson. Toronto locked forever last year out-of-control spread was.   find interesting ethicist quoted ethics flagrantly rejecting vaccination, face masks, social distancing, harm reducing actions pandemic killed millions people worldwide keep kicking road extreme measures place it'll never last wave. fully support vaccines one vaccinated think masks gotta go. mask mandates NJ cases sit around 1500-2000. minimal terms previous waves. 

I think time stop tracking cases focus deaths. We're almost full year vaccines, coupled amount cases we've seen..... we're getting point last wave started dropping extreme masking. Let vaccines work, idc people decided get it.... they'll another statistic. time track deaths only.

You say well cases lead deaths. Yeah well first 6 months 2020...cases deaths much correlated longer. let go. Transmission rates creating extreme mask mandates kick can. almost 2 full years this..no cans. redditors American, Americans cruel    Yeah, think summed “being told there’s something new do, rather growing expected something”

Same thing back seatbelts became thing, etc. know *lack* terminology, terms we've decided use shorthand subjective. choose say ""safe"" instead ""I vaccinated still mask public continue follow medical guidelines"". Someone else might take safe ""I heard buddy coughing stepped back cause want cold. Probably shared drink though...oh well!"" We're making choices subjective information rather objective facts. Maybe I'm making sense though, sorry.  1. someone vaccinated catch virus, yes. likely catch unvaccinated, even close. 

2. likely spread unvaccinated? Maybe. peak viral loads appear equivalent (which comes from) duration (read number chances spread) significantly shorter.

3. someone already infected higher antibody tiers? Yes, moderate severe cases. Low severity cases may may provide sufficient immunity prevent future infection. Furthermore, risk complications virus order magnitude higher vaccine.  We've never mRNA vaccines large scale phase 3 trial covid. Yes developing years people trial participants cared karma, wouldn’t like 500th Reddit account. I’m saying undermines pretense “good faith” debate.

The “pathetic” nice touch though. Hmmm.. one things contagious. Better late never, really dropped ball. honestly feel profit held long possible shareholder position make profits discord antivaxxing.

Call cynic reeks corporate shenanigans imho. think funny yo-yos pay hundreds dollars fake record free vaccination. what’s pathetic someone disagrees drop name calling.

Saying deserved name calling. truth. 

And answer questions either... edited posted removed part. wasn’t trying imply people saying unvaccinated people, trying say instances people mock unvaccinated person’s death without really knowing person. Big difference people anti-mask hope herd immunity people fear vaccine anxiety genuine ignorance.

I’m speaking instances happened. Granted, think it’s gross mock people dying regardless.  Seems generally work them. not? time vaccinate country see happens mean time. massive lock downs still business movement. fuck this?

""it sucks, read lot it, informed observation, source""

You spreading misinformation always segment population holds extremely contrarian views. broken people one way another. empathy members society mental illness, hence empathetic towards perceive groups misunderstanding world.  Duh mock deserved got. Wish would happened sooner sympathy empathy. work field strong enough understanding biology science greatly concerned COVID since well hit US shores. soon confirmed infect ACE2 receptors implications that, along *early* testing using aerosol drum testing showed airborne (around March 2020) knew could *really* bad. I've tired trying explain morons.

These morons decry MMR vaccines also refuse J&amp;J vaccine based older technology? hurry fuck die already rest us get *lives*...

me - someone fucks give. sucks. No, what’s pathetic someone disagrees drop name calling. 

Like said, it’s easy dehumanize people you’re behind computer. 

Have good day. I'm ""color sky"" state (stupid auto mod) local school held Homecoming days ago.

1. High school kids vaccinated.

2. Missing traditional dances heart breaking kids last year. Folks this, willing sacrifice kids get back traditional life.

Not saying right... repeating ""sky color"" parents insisting dances year. Banning content nothing strengthen weirdos’ arguments beliefs. tech companies need stop algorithms recommending nonsense people, would affect profits can’t that. Tech companies known need far longer it’s issue dividing public discourse, real solution means cutting profits that’s something they’ll never unless forced to. Banning content gives impression something, solving absolutely nothing making problem potentially worse, get keep making billions outrage. Fuck tech companies. “ethicist” article anti masker. article circlejerk unethical af. people get vaccinated people getting sick, pressures healthcare start go down. pandemics ended past- enough people developed sort immunity longer affected everyone once. That's said going slow training end pandemic antivaxxers. going spread quickly infectiousness Delta pretty much guarantees they'll get point.   Good, let’s see effectively actually it. fuck cares. don’t get vaccinated die that’s fault kind deserved it. don’t feel bad all. room planet rest us. Ahh, well got blocked made two similar comments days apart Empathy.
I agree sentiments this, ""...is necessary evil?"" evil truly necessary? That's hard question itself.
Put way, ""It negative hopes stop something...negative."" mind negative cancel-out negative, positive might.
Spreading good-information correct, up-to-and-including died...but making ""light"" never right. main point, ""making light it/death"" makes un-necessary ""evil"" instead grounded-in-reality positive meaning offset ""evil/negativity."" look much Alex Jones intensified bitching trying get new listeners forced cut staff, attributes cut Facebook Youtube. Aww anti-vaxxers want … safe space?    problem cowards, course, they’ll sprint hospital mortality creeps ankles. “news” sources say it’s nothing worry about, realize *is…* oldest daughter problem, took almost year half working medical experts get meds right.

Then went graduate academic scholarship.

Is did? give em snake oil? Allegedly.

Edit: appreciate fairness. studies necessary investigate underlying mechanisms lead reduction ADHD symptoms due ω-3 PUFA treatments

And probably bolded well. Single study showing potential use case =/= effective treatment  way avoid  Finally. good news. Shut dimwits good.  mean, already know pneumonia really hard body pretty extended period time. never even question. nearly KD Harden played grade two ankle sprain Here’s thing, don’t know anything people 5 pictures posts. misinformed peddled bad information, sure, really justify dancing around death? guarantee shared incorrect information before, didn’t involve global health crisis. sub wouldn’t exist users sort empathy. Good. high time companies helped perpetuate human suffering actually step stop madness spread platforms.

People antivax essentially arguing allowed confined spaces others allowed fire gun wildly air free consequences.

It says right study able read. 

You also clog hospitals, meaning people emergencies covid can't get care need. vast majority covid patients ICU's unvaccinated. local area hospitals full, heart attack I'd receive much worse care hospitalizations high.

In end, encourage get vaccinated. encourage use invermectin meme drugs get sick. encourage trust hospitals CDC stay home get sick. go ahead that. :) That's plan right? Enjoy. Consider maybe, maybe, ethics professor Columbia who's also director Medical Ethics Center knows do? Trust experts, right? middle house purchase stuff started get really bad Covid. part. leave house except groceries essential errands. always wore mask, always sanitized entering business made sure everything always wiped down.

My fiancee's father mother elderly health problems, grocery shopping insistence. I've yelled anti-maskers pro-virus folks asking give adequate space queues I've threatened mask ripped coughed on.

I patient. I've done continued whatever ensure virus stops spreading. I'm reaching wits end

I recall time life I've disgusted humanities blatant disregard anyone else's life.

I get limit exceptions, honestly wish everyone actively fighting mask mandates, harassing businesses front-facing staff, deny covid exists... hope catch it, hope get hospitalized, hope none pass anyone else. say 60% deaths 60% 100% covid cases? 60% deaths Israel?

Are 40% fully vaccinated? much percent single shot vaccination? think even comes short-sightedness, Trump etc. goals people assume do. Sometimes see obvious win-win situation like pandemic, could helped everyone gained popularity/reelection easily. choose convoluted set destructive actions instead, everyone looks wonders why. 

After I've started think guys want actually win costs, people assume. thing they're interested making people lose, even take precedence benefitting themselves. ideal situation win-lose, big thing they'll choose lose-lose situations win-win ones. think instead obvious thing taking major action virus making look like hero, Trump caused much chaos confusion possible tried win screwing system cheating.

Rinse repeat don’t think it’s cruel tbh. Fucking morons given every chance die…. Choose die. anything it’s funny  never ending nightmare medical staff caused Governor  average Chinese citizen knows Tiananmen incident. referred June Fourth Incident. I'd argue willingly infecting killing hundreds thousands people, reason child willing (literally) die non existent hill, far cruel. people wasting countless resources traumatizing entire generations ignorance. no, feel like laughing dying cruel, given they've done. Canadian here. People fly Trump flags area, less 30% vaxxed. (15% pop), made 50% cases last month. 

Also, people getting tested admit hospital likes people. She’s one them!  removed comment, civil language, need less disinformation floating around (e.g. humans taking horse dewormer viral infection) Another issue enforcement. I'm riding two blocks I'm parked, need helmet that. dad rolled street hundred yards, even really getting road, cop went batshit crazy writing tickets threatening bike towed kinds bullshit. Absolutely unnecessary. interactions prompt sentiments well. live rural west Texas really wish joke. Thank sacrifice. go unnoticed. We'll get this! Considering people keep hearing stories dying seem openly racist Trump loving asshole conspiracy nuts (and that's closest thing good qualities have) willfully refused get vaccinated mocked did...

Yeah, I'm going feel sorry them. I'll save sympathy children anyone else left behind. jump cliff spite people kept telling shouldn't, brought yourself. think ask chilling effect open discussion moderate voices. I'm subscribed channel M.D. YouTube discusses COVID-19, vaccines, etc. careful (repeatedly) point vaccinated, personally vaccinated hundreds patients, encourages everyone speak doctor follow recommendations, believing vaccine beneficial overwhelming majority people. But, that, videos taken down, worries happen again.  ago insisting people contracted COVID-19 antibodies system may need vaccine. Now, number studies coming support that. months ago ""anti-vax"" (employing slanderous use term).  going cheer ""wackos"" longer platform. wackos worrying about. stifling legitimate public debate, stifling legitimate voices find worry, already new subreddit replace NNN. dumb original though. sure agree this. rate vaccination combination additional immunity contagiousness Delta makes struggle think winter worse. look highly vaccinated cities’ trends, intensity current wave respect hospital admissions far smaller. guess cheering someone died ok then? first question, spreading matter. that's purpose vaccine. wrong course, hill worth dying far argument goes.

2nd question, ask source one making claim...then make sure reputable peer reviewed surprise pandemic political preference.

For vote R, tend risk.

For vote D, tend wear masks take vaccine. Yikes, mean private company whatever want, it’s cool censorship’s form. time, answer maybe. seen, large amounts. said, difficult tease high degree certainty outbreak still going on. mostly younger people dying COVID now, since older people vaccinated, proportionately seems like younger people dying.

Correct.


There additional factor younger population much lower rate vaccination. Delta variant much contagious running unvaccinated populations like wild fire. means there's lot vulnerable individuals younger population. end, even rate death lower, higher numbers infected, higher numbers deaths.    late, late shall cry post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

A true skeptic unbiased one. true skepticnever expects certain answer question. LeBron made decisions based answers questions, rather asking questions search validation preconceived answers questions.

I respect this. every race getting vaccine anyway, don’t see point worrying reminds squidward said listens public radio.

He's reminds much people listen NPR (including me, lmao)

""You may hoodwinked everyone else backwater town, can't fool me! listen public radio!""  God that's dumb take, lawsuits solve problem  Appendix?   absolutely massive double blind randomly assigned trials constantly talked about, along thousands followup studies proved real world?

If actually want learn studies structured see collection US centric follow ups hand, reported misinformation bin go. FDA absolutely said nothing you’re claiming. question inability find information, willful ignorance. don’t 2021. Free lawsuit otherwise.  even go LeBron expert basketball. wanted Lakers add Westbrook.  would also mean vaccinated people listen NPR lol, better increase funding 200 million listeners US alone pale insignificance

Would like see someone telling parents lost son.
""Oh son died ? bad, death insignificant"" proceed bully people grief thing killed child. Went festival weekend glorious. mask sight weekend great. Proof vax negative test required. 

Other (the vax check), first time 18 months think covid capacity whatsoever. felt awesome true normalcy. Nothing scaled back changed way. Tuskegee argument holds water me, sympathize.

Why? none people use argument systematically reject healthcare elsewhere. Invasive surgeries? problemo. Potent prescription drugs? Pop 'em in.

It's hypocritical excuse avoid *one particular* vaccine, stinks conspiracy BS rather legitimate consistent argument.  research lmao fucking moron.  AutoMod: _drops mic_ Thanks, everything insure safety around me. wish others would same.  reason (which agree) reasons well? know next nothing NBA players  Interesting chronic cough mentioned. suspect COVID-19 February/March 2020 lingering cough almost year afterward experienced unusual symptoms first months. never experienced ""brain fog"" chronic fatigue often reported ""long COVID,"" though.  Wat You’re going ignore saying NBA players vaccinated April, aren’t you. wasn’t available everyone available medical professionals. many celebrities waited group eligible get it. Hate on, get facts right. made timeline doesn’t really hold water.

Yah, months. since December 2020 get it, months months meet experts needed ""do research"".

And today advocating use (as said). Instead, breathing air ""just need see info"" bullshit anti-vaxx people pushing non-stop like 12 months. know also causes deaths? worst pandemic nation ever seen. mind blowingly awesome treatment essentially prevents long term hospitalization death said pandemic, we're dragging knuckles giving children. beyond ridiculous. dunno - think turned corner, businesses kowtow knuckleheads. dummies messing business getting vaccinated, companies need beg someone get FDA approved vaccine.

I hope get canned, get nickel Unemployment.  I've heard said 100M people eligible booster shot. 200K per day would take 1.4 years many. April vax'd 3M per day, 15X rate headline. before, given proper enthusiasm cooperation. Woops. bad. 10 months, 6 instead. Yeah no. cdc panel said boosters remember ? Look happened. isnt strict consensus issues. Get vax kids let’s assume docs agree medical staff..... Wtf wrong America. insane.  2. plenty openings. got booster today. im 33 healthcare worker. first one december thats decided best. 70 yr old dad got yesterday problems line fully support well! ARP covers shit now. Thanks, Biden! This. talking someone skeptical recently, rather say got I’m fine, honestly told first came out, also skeptical. took information found secured confidence, seemed pretty helpful. Thanks. doubt care team one fired folks but, are, good riddance. Think know absolutely nothing education (as in, received info) everything political party. usps no? assume local pharmacy's eligibility criteria identical recommended CDC head. friend turned away weekend, hearing seniors immunocompromised would given booster. (National chain, name pharmacy since policies may change soon.) Whoa whoa whoa, don’t let context get way hate train.  dare /s “I research” equivalent conclusion shopping something fits bias person looking for.

As far I’m concerned scientists research peer reviewed conclusion long bag.

Vaccine works. wise man Body armor 100%, turns wearing more/better body armor protective, obviously means body armor work wear body armor all! really care look brave simply would lose money. important thing. may be, vaccines already given plenty white people barely adverse effects. think evil government secretly giving black people another vaccine experimentation, keeping good vaccines white people? sounds awfully far-fetched.  us can't get medical reasons. Immune disorders, allergies, injured first dose etc. We’re together! I’m parent 3-year 3 kids 5-11 range. It’s hard wait able get vaccinated. Hopefully Christmas! 🤞🏼 ex police officer tell job dangerous, considerably less exposure dangerous/violent persons daily basis compared nurses. Part defensive training equipment, support personnel. poster mentioned, theres serious legal repercussions assaulting PO, people less inclined it.

Nurses EMT deserve better this. That's fair, thanks!  Oh totally makes sense lol. it’s you, even comment thread I’ve seen several people reiterating mentioned wanted point out! I'd bet biggest motivation unvaccinated point fear admitting wrong. went around feeling smart independent (and letting everyone social media know it) everything blathering transparently bullshit instinct cling even harder.

There's reason HCA sub much fodder. People good things also bad things. Welcome real world.  know breakthrough infections significantly less sick, les infectious? whole point vaccines prevent severe/hospitalizations extremely effectively. That’s whole goal, reality is, going get Covid eventually, damage lungs significantly less severe vaccinated ppl. got vaccinated april may year … bad. absolutely tho, makes sense. Yeah same! vaccine particular simplest vaccine I’ve seen. It’s amazing people think it’s poison. noticed penn state game last Saturday 10 second memorial guy died. said brief illness, don’t think allowed say covid anymore. Let guess. Everything open business usual nary mask sight? live perpetual state pissed. Fuck people

That bit ironic don’t understand one seems realize Toronto cities vaccination requirements home teams, away teams Saw thing somewhere two things persuade people change deeply held beliefs money sex.  someone lived upstate NY entire life I'm shocked higher number.   alot people lucky deal anti-maskers, let’s run alot.

Alot entitled. Refuse wear mask unless k95, black, blue, want social distance, want see people’s “smiling” faces, quick etc.

Just remember mask doesn’t mean everyone accommodate special needs. mask means deal consequences wearing mask social distancing, employees refusing help, denial escalate it.

tldr, choice wear mask, don’t assume consequence free  recognized (unsolved) problems Covid, underscores gravity. think idea keep mind getting people accept vaccination may easier fixing critical-thinking skills. Meanwhile tech companies taken meaningful steps (of course needed).  Guess deaths are. Republican counties =P

Their hospitals going filled, transferring patients bluer metro areas. That's longform interviews better quick quotes. get info truth them. Irving threatened retirement traded Brooklyn. scenario see gets traded doubles getting vaccine severely impacts Nets chance championship since wouldn’t able play home games. goalposts must weigh much seem east push back  Good riddance virus promoters. reason need boosters is.....wait it....because many UNvaccinated people still spreading disease.   Yeah, suspect reasons people avoiding it, politics emotional, illogical case, ""rebel"" attitude (""big government ain't tellin' do!"") even really align right likely biggest ones. people, really big deal get vaccinated, may feel lost battle also use excuse. 

Those truly believe conspiracy science stuff probably make lot continue refuse believe vaccines hurt them, turn mind controlled people, etc. “Michael Jeffery Jordan would never taken vaccine!” Like, stupid amazing money pandemic. Andrew Wiggins can’t play home games San Francisco Kyrie Irving can’t play home games Brooklyn neither vaccinated. Irving play San Francisco Wiggins play Brooklyn since they’re “road” games provided negative Covid test. odd. It’s rude say “nothing” thinks already bullet proof. Natural immunity lovely owes patients certainty personal claim natural immunity. long ago sick? get tested ""think"" it? get antibody tests.... etc.  employer right insist verifiable vaccination obligation make convienent expecially since works place lots people answer questions vaccine. parent 3-year-old I’m still waiting bated breath parents 5-11 group. Here’s hoping guys! fair, that's exactly lot nursing - skilled trade. pretty narrow set things done, highly skilled important, need underlying knowledge effective nurse lower level things. worked pharmacist 6 years hospitals scientist 10 years. project reality onto others. Smarten up, kid! first NBA players get vaccinated weren’t April. activate players vaccinated March 7th according Silver. 

And clear, doesn’t seem public knowledge got vaccinated. Schroeder alluded fact one Lakers vaccinated back NBA season May 15th. made timeline doesn’t really hold water. 

Again, y’all hate call “as dumb rest them” he’s vaccinated advocating like NBA players.

Edit: Dates 

And get isn’t ultimate advocate vaccines. point isn’t lost me. asked Bugs Bunny. know answer, rude say loud. ok Sounds like great way get rid idiots work place. unlikely impossible   originally.

I don’t even know believe  “I skeptical first, research.”

Ugh. Someone talk *him* messaging too. refusing vaccinate claiming exact thing.  Downvoted? Lol She’s already retired, really isn’t much consequence - unfortunate. That's actually good idea POCs lowest vaccination rates demographic. Everytime reasoning comes reiterate thing. native American population genocided experimented much American blacks yet high vaccination rate among ethnicities. Fact life American blacks issue whites do, lack education susceptible social media lies.  rather rushed through? right-leaning well wanted tell I'm proud going get vaccine Customer says need change oil car proves oil unnecessary engines. Billions people worldwide vaccinated. people think special beyond me. lol love people science background say “did research” they’re going find something professionals didn’t. Thank God Lebron gave work over!

Lebron James: Expert Police Tactics vaccinations. know without science.

\- priori clear appropriate dose children. 
\- risk serious illness death young child low 
\- serious side effects vaccines ""a headache"". Look myocarditis, even caused deaths. Probably something like this... ""I believe wasn’t educated situation hand, spoke soon, many people could harmed, financially, physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. careful tweet say, do."" Decision (vax edition) Hahahahaha. need levity. :) No, say anything relative transmissibility virus vaccinated unvaccinated people. statement CDC true vaccine prevent transmission all. statement CDC also true vaccine prevents 80% transmission.

Critical thinking requires read accurately, accurate reading shows statement say think says.

In real world, number breakthrough infections small. Like, less 1% found. Avg consumer educate themselves. can't research. Anyone says ""did research"" clue research opinion topic relevant. cousin nurse worked covid units still antivax. spoken lately uncle said get sacked. still Facebook I'm sure claiming hero title. wording article changed several times since first posted morning. don’t know what’s frightening, subject matter fact article 100% changed. Yeah I’m sure research deeply stupid (and privileged) take. goal get people vaccinated not? 

I hope don’t also support mandates argument applies “if people need mandate instead scientists doctors they’re beyond hope.”

Yeah maybe don’t give af people take vaccine, want take it. guess I’m silly consequentialist. wanted make math/delta joke, changed mind. thing, listened someone qualified give medical advice, saw bunch people saying similar, again, qualified makes claims. enough people told selfish, learned following unqualified people path failure. 

I friend today kicked gaming guild spouting nonesense thinking we're lied to. Today asking me, ""Why majority nurses refusing vaccine?"" told bullshit educated doctors rejecting droves? mom doctor, sister nurse. last one family get vaccinated (minus cult brother count), nurses always think know everything, real problem.  Yes do. Well maybe you. Sounds like arrogant let others exercise autonomy. Forgot patients rights well. probably retire. start thinking know dangerous. Leave Delta *change people's minds time*...I'll see out. Yes, kids die flu well, numbers comparable millions covid cases. Obviously means deaths. important part *often* happens.

I'm **not** saying covid flu, question vaccinating young kids nearly cut dry make be. science done. Dude good Lebron. Good Lebron would following experts’ guidance gotten vaccine months ago. He’s famous there’s real chance public skepticism led impressionable fans same, could died spread it. 

Also sorry Lebron isn’t genius epidemiologist. read Facebook posts. 

Fuck Lebron waiting long. vaccinated April May. use celebrity status bypass vaccine wait got available. Good Lebron think respective cities want subject vaccine mandates federal lawsuits stemming commerce clause. make reasonable (i.e. enough least get judge consider idea) case traveling players strictly interstate commerce city laws would need comply federal rules. 

That said also make fairly convincing arguments would still apply (states generally allowed regulate commerce good state able require screening fruits/vegetables sale alcohol), cities likely could push wanted. Yea, might sound dismissive, Anxiety/Depression cannot attributed COVID without study (And study mean population studies, mean actual studies exactly COVID affects brain). People living pandemic 1.5 years now, looks like last full 2 years. Many people seen friends family members last year half.

How would determine environmental clinical factors caused anxiety depression people facing?

Let's also talk selection bias. majority people likely respond study people believe COVID major problem. people would probably worried COVID first place, taking precautions. also likely that, since infected, work jobs exposed COVID, know hard toll frontline workers taken mentally last year.

Finally, many people lost friends family members last year, many seen friends family stuck ICU.

Quite frankly, think Long COVID issue, cannot reasonably attribute mental health symptoms directly COVID many outside factors also contribute symptoms.  academic research, looking information reliable source general counts research me. Nothing wrong that. I'm sick people research arrogant think know people studied stuff entire lives. okay trust experts. hear you. prevailing spirit regular staff chain pharmacies (vs, say, volunteers temp workers pop-up clinics) different, though. ""We audited"" one statements made. might done actual research instead Googling “why shouldn’t get coronavirus vaccine.” probably keep going that? New York staff lived things nobody else understand. insult wrong. Especially nurse help hospitals hell. State level vaccine mandates lawful, federal mandates federal employees. 

Federal mandates anyone else questionable best. celebrities less swollen testicles please.... Good him, needs ""own research"". would entail getting thousands people together take vaccine others not, track COVID rates, hospitalizations, deaths, etc. Luckily already done trained professionals many times over.  I'm vaccinated since Jan. Vaccinations stop transmission. Remember public got vaccinated wear masks..... do? 

 take care people day diagnosis originate diet, drug use, obesity, smoking, unprotected sex etc. shame anyone ever medical decisions. give education shaming end. mandate Jacobson case get vaccinated pay fine. Jacobson objected adverse reaction smallpox vaccination younger meaning proof got vaccinated.  Ok saying provably false. Probably made nuts louder, lots people got mandate. Good know people never need new clothes, new cars, new food, new aspirin, new light bulbs, new bandages, etc.

I mean, requires use one, must proof work. Oh wow thanks update. perspective 1.4 per 100,000 0-11 age group. Orders magnitude 5X misleading numbers small. Seeing people get hopefully marginalized rest society fills joy. people symptoms six months infection

This really accurate headline -- finding [the actual ""36.55% [...] one long-COVID feature recorded [...] 3 6 months""

The difference ""have symptoms"" implies ongoing experience -- i.e. frequent, least multiple, occurrences symptoms. That's different ""experienced symptoms least 3 month period"".

As hypothetical example, abnormal breathing one day 4 months getting covid, would counted 36.55% even never happened -- people say ""have symptoms six months infection"". doubt people would consider ""long covid"", usually refers ongoing, recurring symptoms.

The authors study make point themselves: ""...**the findings say nothing persistence clinical features**"" Avocados meh! totally agree! counts! Cars need new brakes every then. mean brakes don’t work? ruling STATES mandate it, condition exercising states plenary powers impact states.

Neither things apply Federal government using commerce clause legitimizing OSHA's regulatory powers.  maybe blackmailed rewarded  black/white gap overall much, much smaller d/r gap, even percentage, say nothing impact raw numbers. ranchers farmers say struggling effects surging demand ivermectin, deworming drug.   [archive link anyone trouble accessing article sure glad LeBron James research arrive decision. CDC states ""The weekly COVID-19–associated hospitalization rate per 100,000 children adolescents week ending August 14, 2021 (1.4)"" mean 1.4 children every 100,000 hospitalized per week? Washington State 439,000 children 0-4 years old would 6.1 hospitalizations per week. would mean 0-4 hospitalization every 9 weeks so. seems really low (and age groups lower?

They right thing time worry next. people 20 years later still bitching taught mitochondria powerhouse cell. Reddit? US worldwide? US mainly rooted distrust government. Worldwide seems rooted weird conspiracies.  Yes. you’re spreading verifiable disinformation knowingly endangers public at-large, deserve deplatformed. talk want, you’re entitled megaphone project it. That's recommendation algorithm works (even Reddit). 

They consider net vote (up - down). also consider upvote percentage. even small percentage downvote could point conspiracionist niche content good.

 Either way, I'm saying dumb idea. certainly analyzed much did. I'm expressing fear feel.  don’t know case long covid, one thing that’s bothered universal “quarantine two weeks”, though couldn’t exceptions that.

My brother law long covid. judging date sister got (they’re still married see one day week?) seems went back work “two week vacation” took up. apparently tested negative twice. “outbreak work” presumed that’s got infected…

Yeah, no. I’m pretty sure outbreak.

He ended catching pneumonia top hospital LONG time. Ended getting convalescent plasma therapy guess helped. wait several months could get jab… still sure he’s yet, much better he’s feeling.

But seeing time sister saw anyone literally going pharmacy one time, two masks… truly believes that’s got infected. Sorry sis, husband lying scumbag. Judging logic past actions, really isn’t hard believe. Always love running subs. screen name unforgettable. like see distinctive car freeway one occasion. Gross misuse prominent Oh, no. poor redditor thinks first amendment applies private businesses. :) wonder boosters going recommended 
people vaccines before/early pregnancy? funny say also known children WAY less affected infected adults, meaning many probably even reported all! matter Easily spread still spread! Also proof slows spread? saying it!? come SOO many people vaccinated yet worse ever been??? make sure highlight fact majority people DYING unvaccinated.. still getting dying huh? Ok well shouldnt able choose want take risk dying not? still affect anyone matter? that's effective way, still anti-vaxxers? 

I'm fucking tired silly ass argument. stop fire hose bullshit facts. **You reason someone position reason into.** Except silencing misinformation vaccines exactly spirit behind thread… Plus, correct wrong far know get 2nd shot, takes 14 days kick important get infected within interval. sure info tho, guess works way. Corporations telling think, covering ass. deplatformed private business, regardless user base, censorship.

There also huge difference spreading disinformation discussing vaccine/COVID less positive light. example:

“Personally, haven’t gotten vaccine don’t feel confident ability understand it’s composed of. Someone could explain know could something bad it. feel safer waiting.”

VS

“Don’t get vaccine. putting toxic chemicals vaccine, vaccine exists virus *they* created. get vaccine, become infertile. Ivermectin far better treatment COVID”. 

Huge, huge difference. Censorship never good idea  Unvaccinated people's body temperature. hot right now.  can't argue facts matter fall back hypotheticals, like sort gotcha showing weak position is. speaking truth all. asking would agree YouTube's ""right ban whatever want free market"" opinion banning stuff agree with, went multi-comment tirade misinformation damaging, lol.

I clean entire conversation pretty easily, going back original comment ask Nobody right use someone else’s home business without permission. YouTube someone else’s property. agree abide rules you’re guest there. fail uphold end agreement, you’re asked (or told, forced) leave. That’s works IRL. That’s agreement *as long ban stuff agree banning, banned stuff agree with, would sit well me* Probably. Never thought they'd make mandatory employees either though think 96% ""almost all""? 

If someone told read almost books library found 96%, I'd agree them. someone said lost ""almost hair head"" 96%, it'd hard disagree.
.
4% ""not insignificant number"" significantly fewer general population. mild side effects #2. #3 kicking ass. even about? 

No one trying decide anyone else, goal ensure decisions aren’t excessively influenced widely disproven outright fabricated dogshit.

No one making decision you, anotherdude209, MUST go get vaccinated (but seriously, talk doctor, go get vaccinated), deciding literal lies cannot spread fact social media. Exactly. Anybody 12 older. government though? Lol  even understand nonsense, lol. 

You would critical thinking skills. lot people understand fine. damn good! would love see country see numbers soon hopefully.  Politicians Alabama building prisons...

for themselves. Finally! ever, society scared paranoid, need government oligarchs guide thinking. comfortable again. Yay  point, needs governmental rules surrounding freedom speech internet. Someone US posts? country’s rules apply. Someone Iran? country’s rules apply them. would ideal, totally feasible.

It’s super complicated considering it’s global. tech companies need pick global standard follow abide it. maybe headquarters determine laws apply.

The major issue letting people happened upon ton power influence power dictate social discourse exchange ideas. Social media needs reworked immensely done away entirely make better decentralized system.   it. don’t reserve right force people listen nonsense. Youtube isn’t kicking conservative, pushing harmful information easily refutable. even then, reserve right refuse service reason isn’t discriminatory. Also guess what? move different platform even create own! aren’t entitled service, free one less. Translation- Alabama government plans whitewash steal Covid relief funds.

These asshole put laws steal food supplies funds ever please research! think understand term cancel culture means.

But anyway, yes. people silenced, spreading harmful lies, people dying direct result it. YouTube understandably wanna associated (about time,) platform, good riddance. 

BTW, difference opinion much idiots denying overwhelming fact establish research, testing, implementation (6.2 doses worldwide) doctors health professionals around globe. Extreme denial fact endanger idiots spreading it, people listening believing idiots, also innocent people catch virus said idiots. would rather believe cool V Vendetta/Tom Clancy/Matrix conspiracies get vaccine, that's you, expect YouTube cool spreading dumb, dangerous ""opinion."" Start getting groceries delivered, take job working home. go subject innocent people irresponsibility. 

""If people decide ‘I willing danger community refusing vaccine’ say well ‘I also decency isolate myself. don’t want vaccine don’t right run around harming people'"" - Noam Chomsky everything appears YouTube falls line government wants? anti American videos YouTube? 

Are suggesting United States government nationalize social media enforce free speech? 
Or fan free market?  good, fuck'em got time morons. ""And telling people listen doctors cancer, come scam 'wellness sessions' results sued FDA""

What ""people"" sued FDA this? talking people selling products? That's different saying opinion internet someone try hold medically liable it. Dunning Kruger effect implies least ability overestimate. clueless people believing utter nonsense. side effects?

How feel getting 3rd shot? Right. opposite truth cannot truth. Anyone compares private company exercising freedom speech stop spread objective lies 1984, never actually read 1984 Yeah new horse put barn less chance running away now. You’ve lost horses new horses saved stupid decisions uncorralled horses. while, old, stupid horses running around, fed groomed, looking like asshole horses. tell new horses, “Don’t like old asshole horses. See stupid unhealthy look? don’t want them. Stick healthy, happy, well groomed horses barn.” logic YouTube would also taken videos stated WMDs Iraq, aluminum tubes, etc.

Those bipartisan wars sides acted bad faith enrich donors secure mineral resources. *god damn* Government censoring anything? 

I'd agree part, misinformation completely control. Private companies pruning misinformation sounds opposite dangerous me. government constantly hauls execs threatens regulate ""regulate themselves"" way government wants, 

You want oppressed badly think one ever allowed opinion tbh, dangerous told think technocrats What's opinion getting moderna booster instead? first 2 doses pfizer im fence. Based limited knowledge this, wish got Moderna vaccine. thinking better variants.  None relates anything saying. honestly think replying wrong person now.  Pfizer, believe CDC already taken aged 18–49 years underlying medical conditions may receive booster shot Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine least 6 months Pfizer-BioNTech primary series, based individual benefits risks, and

and following recently pregnant people (for least 42 days following end pregnancy) likely get severely ill COVID-19 compared non-pregnant people.

Moderna J&amp;J Boosters still air everyone, unfortunately. admire purported goal, job YouTube Facebook qualified do. employ third-party so-called ""fact checkers"" check claims false either eventually turn true really information like. Earlier pandemic (maybe still now), suggested social media pandemic might originated lab specifically Wuhan Institute Virology, post removed account could suspended, maybe permanently. blessing science leaders NIH NIAID said could case. Now, clear lab leak hypothesis plausible maybe probable. 

The outrageous claims easy identify (the vaccines carry microchips alter DNA), claims around edges? ""anti-vaccine misinformation"" question whether someone previously infected SARS-COV-2 carries antibodies really needs vaccinated? questioning whether 20 year olds mandated get vaccine? clearly-defined guidelines banned? 

I'm spreading vaccine misinformation. personally vaccinated since April. is, however, plenty evidence social media platforms task fairly accurately evaluating content. Thank comment!

You earned 1 social credit point. new score is: 84! terms changed. yes, posting disproven information held accountable via demonetization restriction future use platform.

If someone feels need type information likely search elsewhere. doesn’t need appear feeds alongside correct information comparable. question whether anxiety/depression caused long covid caused cooped indoors nearly two years little human contact. live alone spent time alone past 18 mos entire life.  idiots idiot states. It’s probably hospitals counties. Religion. Maybe friend's son autistic blames vaccines stuff. like told do. parroting hear. idiots hanging idiots. fear blood clotting possibility. Well done 😃 I'm hearing ~~TexasNorth~~ Alberta? dramatic point trying make power used good, it’s terrible idea let tech companies decide cannot talk about. That’s governments job, theirs. hailed heroes would expected sacrifice themselves.  See people aren’t moronic assholes aren’t getting deplatformed. Almost like common denominator moronic asshole.  Anecdotal. friend's vaccinated family members became positive minimal symptoms; recovered quickly; house 15, 2 became positive; almost half essential workers.  decided never got vaccine never got vaccine cause anti-vax?  think way stop future waves stop prevention measures? LOLLL. ""Censoring it"" about, using one else platform pay for? make Website Youtube like Company, something make Tik Tok like videos dances believe Natural Immunity? government already regulates can't say. can't go around telling people put bomb somewhere. can't tell someone going hit kill them. can't go around telling people someone else child molester order tarnish reputation. 


We already regulate speech poses danger matter deciding line drawn. There's difference discussing something telling straight lies causing thousands deaths block bs conspiracys ones silencing you. They’re saying go shout nonsense somewhere else. like guy preaching end world Walmart crying “censorship” kick bad business. Mmm. Let us pray! Moral story infectious diseases bad you. Get influenza COVID-19 shots. Wash hands follow your. follow recommendations local health officials. first 2 doses pfizer. What's opinion getting Moderna booster becomes available instead pfizer booster? 

 
My thinking Moderna supposedly 90% efficacy Delta variant Pfizer around 44% efficacy Delta variant. Seems like Moderna might better variants. done much research though. Maybe someone persuade listen guidelines get Pfizer booster.  missing point though - government legislate pressing need act, like now. needs circumstances change, change law. like legislators, change too. say ""well, could misused later? Better change it!"" status quo continue, status quo hundreds people dying day. want talk stifling discussion, honest conversation [*Fairness don’t understand opinions can’t facts. can’t peoples opinions facts, too? tell difference facts opinions? don’t know brains work! let everyone express opinions facts social media.  ethically, everyone allowed opinion, right? opinions are, like, valid, right? people born equal. says constitution! everyone’s opinion equal ability fact!  
/s typical troll trying confuse poorly educated. Opinions facts people equal &amp; free speech.  missing point though - government legislate pressing need act, like now. needs circumstances change, change law. like legislators, change too. say ""well, could misused later? Better change it!"" status quo continue, status quo hundreds people dying day. want talk stifling discussion, honest conversation [*Fairness leftist way. Always been.

But since want attempt false equivalence desperate reason, no. honestly makes think they're right.

Last year, many schools, offices, shops, restaurants, concerts, etc., shut down, mask stay home mandates, high level precautions taken reduce spread covid also effective flu. look increase vaccination rate since rolled mandate early August, incredibly effective. guess decent amount people go get shot keep job. NYS fucking around, amount refusal going change minds there's literally legal standing antivaxxers go on. choice change industries likely subject vaccine mandate anyway, move state, they'll likely subject vaccine mandate w/in next year anyway. Thanks! work anti vaxers also decided relaxation mask mandates applied them, trying understand reasoning getting vaccinated boiled like told do.

Its crazy large chunk population behave like petulant children sake contrarianism. must frequent it.. large chunk posts people talking sub-reddit helped decide get vaccinated.. I’m 80% children’s hospitals procedures stopped provide space adults didn’t vaccinate. Transplant wards closed people would generously donate organs can’t wait lifesaving surgeries won’t receive organs. ethical that? Don’t believe covid? Don’t run hospital get it. That's pretty selective way look data. states tons deaths beginning pandemic, vaccine really good protocols treating diseases. Texas getting hit hardest there's plenty vaccines go around pandemic would pretty much vaccine hold outs would gotten vaccinated months ago. much pay him? censorship.

I'm vaxxed totaly annoyed misinformation.

Still, disagree suppression speech, public communication, information. may done basis material considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, ""inconvenient"". Censorship conducted governments, private institutions, controlling bodies.

And case private institution supressing (mis-)information harmful. would say calling censorship correct, i'm totally fine case censorship. long Covid result hospitalization death, appears vast majority vaccinated cases, I'd rather long Covid ""long lockdown.""   Pics didn’t happen part? Triangle things relaxed now, people pretty diligent.  sure bothering trying explain way prove lab involved.

There way prove things 100% certainty, obviously standard looking for.

Maybe knowing illness going influences likely report symptom / pay attention more. Thank continue do!! America grateful &amp; took vaccines. dedication 👏 🙌 simply HEROIC.  Gee hope Dear Leader OK people told us ""fuck feelings""and everything could piss us last 5 years absolutely reveled cruelty shown others. *still* moral thing, even though deserve it, told get vaxed. wanted play contrarian, piss us again, told - even though could saved lives. terrible people met terrible end there's justice universe, they're burning hell killing many fellow man lies.

I kinda understand mocking instances someone vehemently vaccine things like forcing cough mock people, refusing wear mask, causing stir public pandemic, people targeting non vaccinated people. I’m tired people politicized people’s deaths. say people legitimately right afraid vaccine. may irrational might need try weigh options fears vaccine fears covid, truly feel bad individuals think makes asshole reduce everyone “well, natural selection 101” people dying supposed funny didn’t wanted.

Like really grown ass people saying “oh died? That’s sad. Oh wait…they weren’t side? Fuck em”.

I’m upset everyone everyone side everything whole situation mean isn’t entirely wrong though? Cases clearly decline right US… Thank work.

Anyhow, it’s nice changed stance vaccine public it. Long covid matter discussing restrictions. 

Long Coviders ones flooding ICUs, thus taken account discussing restrictions. 

The reasons restrictions places avoid graves covid cases leads weeks ICUs &amp; deaths. 

Long Covid impact regards.

Sure sucks, research fight cure long covid done equally with/without restrictions. example, world existed fine without Facebook hotbed misinformation propaganda. scale scope Facebook's reach (a private company boot, public, government institution) makes devastating. 

Your post [reminded 100% called it. Freedom speech principle, applies whoever respects it. (YouTube doesn't) I'm NJ well. state mask mandates schools medical facilities. ROT drop 1 again.

I've confidence there's another pandemic decade two would different unfortunately. world dumbing rapid rate. I'm sacrificing anything regards school dances. I'm 27 year old healthcare worker. 


This dangerous relative things allowing. hospitals full states, Texas Florida, otherwise, normal winter levels (hospitals rarely empty, admin almost always pushing us discharge patients we're 97-99% capacity half year). Kids, *especially* vaccinated, low minimal risk hospitalization. die vaccinated sent kid homecoming, sounds like personal problem. probably also high risk things lead demise, attending concerts sports games large gatherings. Arbitrarily banning homecomings, kids pandemic sacrificed *most*, cruel.



If we're going allow school dances, guess also cancel concerts, weddings, sporting events, conventions, conferences. also close restaurants, gyms, night clubs, amusement parks. would utterly ridiculous close 2 years. Drawing line school dances, often memorable part high school, ridiculous. used rely friends family ground us kind flawed thinking.

Same thing LeBron *any person* knows essentially nothing virology ""doing research"" whether get vaccinated. Deuces! know current context things considered positive, can’t help read types headlines as, “Celebrity confirms water wet.” Like ffs we’ve spent generation generation improving understanding science medicine trusting scientific community yet year 2021 we’ve thrown away political clout, it’s working. Like what. The. Fuck.  people gushing decision. damage already done. It’s going help anymore trump finally told people get vaccinated. Yeah giving kind point mandates Really annoying stressed way talks Well, maybe amount money compensates risk. Except people absolutely problems medical care now. Hell, many pro athletes inject anything bodies give leg relying medical team make sure kill them? many rely various government agencies make sure food eating, water drinking products use safe? apply pro athletes. People need stop defending ignorant misinformed. I'm starting read research holistic impact body inflammation (from disease covid). makes sense too, something inflamed unwell sick, dying, replaced faster intended, therefore sooner subject mutations breakdown creates overall strain body. policy makers should’ve realized prioritized vaccine rich people celebrities first people would want it. It’s thing cares about: money. people need hear sort celebrity athlete don’t listen NPR.  Agreed. means LeBron James scientifically illiterate. isn’t educated read understand studies scientific depth. like I’m educated read understand peer reviewed research papers. response trusted deep medical scientific expertise medical advisors got vaccination based recommendation. sort validates people minds even remotely capable understanding epidemiology virus detailed aspects virus works. Yeah there’s pandemic aka catastrophic public health crisis. research vaccinations months, waiting “his research”. option test instead different case.  ignorance stubbornness love double down. Second greatest juggler time  mean people said gonna research something scientific research done, evidence provided, etc, sure… wanna feel like came conclusion means. It’s like ride track think driving, gonna end place either way, cares think you’re research.

Now people research actually looking fake conspiracy stuff scientific research evidence, problems. Oh well. 

Anyways. mind government paying them. pays others becomes problem.  It’s ongoing battle, keep trying. side isn’t giving up. PSA. would convince lot skeptics done right.  August+September seen 75,000 deaths due COVID-19 United States. many could've prevented taking vaccine, wearing mask practicing social distancing?

Just incredible Americans would three even seeing Delta India. Naturally Trump jumped it, naturally Trump going make media attention get Google hits. already several people mil/intel's job study potential outbreaks though. How's nightmare understaffed hospital that's dealing pandemic? Seems worse me. Oof never said vaccinated people safe. research continues support safer vaccinated harder spread don’t do, hence need hospitals. 
Feel free use resources then.  don’t understand hell “research” means. Like reading peer reviewed journals? People need get better trusting experts. aren’t fucking epidemiologists.    interesting see much number drops deadline. bet 650 cave right thing get jab. hope 800 know aint realistic. Actually using scientific methodology determined come lab. unlikely come one many reasons.

My point attributing virus lab leak proves nothing. assign blame Chinese spread illness rather Trump held accountable lack efforts control it.  Unreal. That’s issue, issue lot scholarly articles full nonsense someone minimum understands statistics begin tell apart nonsense valid studies. able catch straight fraudulent data requires far training that’s mostly going peer review. knowing basic statistics knowing publications reputable real peer review versus total nonsense people pay publish garbage minimum someone able tell whether paper nonsense not.

For like 95% people they’re better asking trusted physician scholarly articles questions about, hopefully physician enough time look explain things. I'm shocked! Well, shocked. think reason like “I clearly got vaccine earliest opportunity, realize influence amongst people currently hesitant speak way relate to.” George Washington literally went forcibly immunized troops revolutionary war stop smallpox outbreak. fact don’t know shows exactly much slippery slope fallacy you’re claiming really is: threat passed, go mandates. wording poor. Please replace ""vaccines"" medical care. Tuskegee experiments, forced sterilization, even Henrietta Lacks. feel like always hear research people need wonder entails? Asking doctor? Googling? earth-shattering fact hiding celebrities like LeBron Nicki (Minaj) keeps vaccinating absolute last moment?   research generally mean Googled something found someone else's **actual** research. hate phrase, ""I research"" research anything.  live Japan. Turns masks vaccines work - knew!  yeah, feel like that's character comes debate show. watching talk first take seems calm collected. fucking cares saying “boo-urns…” Writing someone outside America, headline seems bizarre. ""Reveals"" implies might controversial. Getting vaccine, dangerous pandemic. lost collective minds, minimum gaslit narcissists.  Mine like first. second one sucked hard. Third one nothing notable. fever, arm discomfort (minor), sore joints little sleepy. that's it; would likely giving entire career, many going think worth (because not). Sure. contracted virus back December last year Brother got store works 8 employees, including him, got time. 

Neither him, me, went hospital. Many need too. 

I'd completely fine adding waiver refuse medical treatment Covid infection.   can't fault that. want work every coworker I'm sure either. watch whole thing sound like hated him. Nah, Peggy Hill Peggy Hill.

That’s individual (probably) Maybe it’ll easier list areas body covid DOESN’T completely fuck up… make sense, lol.  #alldiseasesmatter 😂 DAY? don’t think LeBron talking particular antivax community. think speaking Black people marginalized communities own, different, reasons hesitant take vaccine. SVP's Sportcenter worth watching. one things ESPN still done well.  want true, is. 12-15% COVID cases linked hospitals, immunizing outsized impact. avoid many things life, healthcare people risk one    could antibodies covid No, didn't. vaccines became available, rushed reserve spot ASAP care got FDA gave emergency authorization them. kid finally able get them, FDA made sure *that* safe well. don’t know specific research cold/flu, but, depends infection think. 

You know get cold nose cold chest both? people get “stomach flu” normal cold goes around? virus take hold different parts body. 

Many viruses known infect heart, including ones cases don’t cause much problem all. That'd me! shouldn’t point fingers it’s much better live Georgia honest. fight infection own

So would include complete waiver medical assistance fighting infection?

I mean, morally, like one bit, want give people option fight own, let's give option.

While it, let's make take full complete liability infections traced back said, thinking way forward actually mandate everyone gets needle arm kind **ignores science**

Ah, right. doubt, claim person ignoring science. No, saying want best protection possible without forcing people get infected ""ignoring science.""

Hospitals struggling is. need everything help people intentionally infect make thr situation Natural Immunity, **who already** recovered, especially low risk categories, simply actually need Vaccine.

If wanted grand father established antibodies yesterday, would acceptable. avenue results reason people get infected non-starter put unnecessary pressure hospitals.

But let's honest: ""Hey already infected one gets exemption"" would firmly rejected anti-vaxxers. yeah, numbers small difficult articulate low risk kids. reddit comments real perception hospitalization/death imminent kids get vaccinated. reality safe relative risks common 18 months ago. neither   realize that. difference Tuskegee situation existed lifetimes. 3 years old shut I’m middle aged. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article topic, ever school sporting event noticed lack general sportman-ship? different culture compared SA/Aus/NZ/UK.  Yes, must known, yeah, possible affects people's behavior, likely narrowing gap flu covid somewhat.  think possibilities need investigated, I'll believe whatever evidence says. Dismissing entirely plausible scenario hand, calling conspiracy theory, bothering investigate ""a conspiracy theory"" nonsense circular reasoning. 

As article points out, still collecting evidence prove entirely natural causes. evidence comes in, acting like know conclusively happened, dismissing reasonable hypothesis hand make sense. 

We reasonably rule anyone intentionally causing engineered virus. highly probable human error sort responsible - whether error made butcher, chef, scientist remains determined.  Whether like not, matters. That's whole idea endorsement. get paid big bucks statement. died two weeks getting shot - primitive moronic brain think vaccine cause death, since 2 weeks seems like long time post-shot. I, course, still wrong though.  Nah, plenty people sounding alarm going big problem consider mocking, another facet reddit. Look sub, there's plenty mockery everywhere. Mockery far eye see.

This self-contradictory statement. read article, ethicist totally addressed ethics intentionally making decisions spread deadly disease disrupt (or take) lives pretty much everyone world, right? doubt addressed ethics of, say, choosing double-down political absurdity health safety family, right? addressed ethics creating world grief suffering families everyone died perpetuation anti-covid lies started really gain ground spread revealed people color hit harder disease, right? 

Or fed-up people bit schadenfreude response said people comeuppance? failed mention 1000 resigned critical staff shortages currently experiencing   ignorant fuck.

Frequent ventilation fully opening windows helps. Hand hygiene, masks applicable, tracing app. Distancing, reduce close contact. Tests option. 

Fortunately many friends vaccinated. Mom one firsts receive vaxx whole country. showed well received. Im known group friends vaccine fan, think influenced bit, general informed well. 

Its matter months everyone comes contact virus. time limited problem. doesnt give much comfort portion antivaxxers get sick, dont think stay problem many gatherings 2022+.  Quacks easier say. Masks pull-out method preventing disease. somewhat effective, we’ve got much effective tools—vaccines (birth control pills).

Vaccines much effective doesn’t make sense focus masks.   imagine results J&amp;J plus Pfizer Moderna similar results shown studies AZ plus Pfizer Moderna, good. AZ + Pfizer + Pfizer. Well, live Portugal. Antivaxers counted one hand
We 85% people vaccinated many people still can't get COVID 6 months ago

We get 90%. population 12 around 10%

So, anti vaxers believed less 0.5% GNU STP Glad LBJ made smart choice family team

do people really use LBJ refer Lebron? thats odd  \*antivaxxers 
Not unvaccinated. Let tricky it’s quite simple. Systemic dismantling basic education left lot people without critical thinking skills necessary. Combine older people social media didn’t grow distrustful internet perfect storm. It’s far power positions influence make boil.  Likely even that. people don’t subscriptions required access scholarly articles…sure could go library I’m pretty sure 99.99% people aren’t either. 

*By research, generally mean found someone’s opinion accept similar values interests mind. Yes totally agree, think us do. also work nursing home, though I’m dietary, don’t work nearly much hard do. You’re incredible do, you’re right people don’t deserve sympathy. 

The thing wanted say *still* don’t need *make fun of* laugh death others, whose death likely affected number people’s lives permanently. think could work, vaccines sterilizing immunity. NZ would stay lockdown, basically, everyone got vaccinated.  Yet told get driver's license state: told present photo ID enter bar order drink; told wear seatbelts; told vaccinate children order enter school; told wear seat belts; told obey traffic laws; told many things government comply without much whimper. surprising overwhelming majority COVID cases, nearly deaths, occurring states Trump 2020. I'm vaccinated live area population refusing wear mask considered act pride. Hospitals telling people get sick go ER go walk-in clinics instead. ICUs full sick, unvaccinated people deny COVID demand given livestock dewormer. Farm supply stores demanding proof livestock ownership selling ivermectin. next step intrigues me. anyone demonstrated cyanide kills covid? definitely use gaseous form case.

Wiggins Kyrie trouble local SF/NYC mandates.  hangout like vaccinated friends. LeBronson &amp; Bronson mean 90% grad school original research, still qualified major research component. 180+ upvotes something without *iota* proof.

If anything, likely vaccinated last year's playoffs based event attended + NBA's PR statement *strongly* alluding vaxxed.

But let data get way wild conjectures! Assertive social distancing strategies. Like everyone knew admitted ration makes essential workers (and rich people obv)

It makes people less likely take seriously say next “greater good” act good Here's said (the can't stop watching people suffering consequences actions, publicly, especially deaths preventable,"" Dugdale said. ""Delighting suffering others lies contrary everything medical ethics espouses certainly cruel regular people would this."" 

She say unethical highlight death's preventable. said unethical make fun HCA does. HCA show people educate others ridicule distinction ethicist lies. also heard friends vaccinated sick antivax crowd saying pro-virus, either it'll kill voter base idiots like Trump relied keep power... it'll convert them.   Yep. think rate developing blood clot proximity 1 100k treatments much better days. really know kind quality life people develop blood clot treated successfully.  little late.  That’s exactly antivax nurse friend going say. sheepishly got jab though going fired. she’s still spouting anti vaccine crap. works pushing background everyone thinks working stuff front center anymore. mean I'm sympathetic diseases immunocompromised individuals. point vaccines far effective reducing spread preventing severe illness. Concerta, going adhd meds back 3rd grade 1986... Ritalin. Dozens various meds anti-depressants holistic attempts later, high school, finally landed Concerta-36, sustained release 36mg dose, day night.

My partner unmediated entire life finally got talk doctor specialist adhd, recognizing symptoms them. specialist suggested Concerta excited see still recommend it. said makes literal world difference wondered entire life, actually pretty pissed parents refused treated due ""stigma""  law puts burden plaintiff prove moderation isn’t done good faith. Obviously, done good faith. Months late good faith.   Facebook indeed allow upload videos directly it, lot anti-vaccine content creators already.

But agree banning anti-vaccine stuff youtube help quite lot, even impact big facebook banning stuff would be. 50 100 micrograms? Hmm, see verbatim, ""what said,"" message SEEMED mocking something think something mock helps stop somehow. simply refer back idea perhaps mocking death un-wise, one cannot ""know"" bullshit spread less unless literally watching people spread ""bullshit"" (or taking vast polls assume everyone tells truth?), lastly simply idea mocking usually, know, negative, far see life negative usually stop mitigate negative.

The flip-side pancake (every one two!) would argue better similar result could achieved (hopefully) w/out mocking letting people know number deaths, giving human faces large healthy number inoculated people. simply idea/opinion like all, could wrong.  Choices consequences rightly sure hell spent lot money balconies, nothing balcony doors.  always ask prescribed invermectin made human use well they're free go hospital needed.

Field hospitals thing still brought back. struggling Healthcare system partly result incompetence. illegal practice medicine without licence, illegal spread medical opinions social media. I'm sure devil details, get gist issue hand here. IMO, time long past sympathy empathy. time mockery public shame far handle anti-vaxxers.

You know what’s missed ethics expert? amount family members died, COVID, couldn’t receive treatments there’s room hospitals.

They’re lucky it’s mockery point. two years late matter... Bravo  25 heart arrhythmia previous smoker. 6 month mark super conflicted get 3rd dose not.. thoughts recommendations would excellent. seem data long last helpful younger adults. Thank you! Thats like saying murdering murderer murder think sub weirdly sociopathic upload videos directly Facebook yes. popular feature places like southeast asia west, think, they've while. monetize ad revenue like Youtube too. No, it’s fantasy. YouTube already took stance demobilizing videos mentioned COVID-19 beginning pandemic. doesn’t really matter point, contributed far much harmful spread misinformation censorship. reasoning behind 3rd dose COVID vaccination long-lasting protection achieved t-cells/b-cells effective monoclonal prophylaxis available? evidence guy think things poor judgement. Who'd thunk it? Pro-death Yes, people still post bullshit internet. create website want to.

But power (and danger) social media sites centralization. YouTube Facebook becomes one-stop-shop bullshit, custom-tailored kind bullshit specifically like see. Take away conspiracy-peddlers get scattered; harder share hone propaganda, especially hard rope new victims.

That's deplatforming works. get rid bullshit entirely, diffuses it. said r/science identifying data comes unvacconated individuals cohort data taken January 20, 2020 December 16, 2020. public vaccination began. Drawing conclusions study population mostly vaccinated potentially misleading. surprising considering we're talking antivaxxers. They've never capable recognizing correlation equate causation. ""_____'s kid vaccinated long started seeing signs autism"" totality evidence vaccines causing autism years.  know Section 230 says platforms aren’t publishers nevertheless retain ability moderate content posted site. take whatever want whatever reason want. don’t need enumerate anything TOS.

They protected civil liability “any action voluntarily taken good faith restrict access availability material provider user considers obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, otherwise objectionable, whether material constitutionally protected.”

That’s direct Section 230.  Headache dehydration. likely everyone gets dehydrated get fever take lot fluids.  we're saying, we're saying it. Saying ""It regrettable choose continue burden healthcare system choice stay unvaccinated"" nicer ""You're fucking idiot getting vaccinated point.""

It turns ""fuck feelings"" crowd upset taking *their* feelings consideration mean words. Real question: Colorado hick accent sound like? want take them. care freedom, life, liberty pursuit happiness. rights mean nothing rights. stem growth new anti-vaxxers cruel punching down. Anti-vaxxed mostly uneducated poor. Highly susceptible propaganda. come races overrepresented minority populations. massive fucking failure society education system people like this. Mocking quite cruel. experts cannot disprove concerns made anti-vaccine advocates

That's takes ten times much energy retire bullshit make up. panel members better things do. seen posts claiming FDA ‘admitted’ COVID vaccine kills people?

No don’t Facebook. Traditionaly non whites claiming wrong, wanna challenge line thought saying virus still transmissible without vaccine, albeit less likely transmit asymptomatic case. Would safe assume variants would popped anyways pandemic would still occuring today? Given fact still getting covid passing around, thing could see possible would less people hospital covid. Nothing wrong taking shot. keep ass home get sick go hospital. Maybe try medicating horse paste. lot likely giving young people small dose rather giving kids larger one. high side effects we've seen vaccines normal, due large dosage. Inb4 people debunking anti vaccine content also removed  part Herman Cain it’s clear it’s bad faith attempt creating internet torch mob. name little person Herman Cain. It’s Herman Cain’s personal Twitter posted COVID conspiracy theory crap, actual person died COVID, *his personal Twitter account tried continue downplaying pandemic killed him.* 

It’s literally meme image. That’s need context, spend paragraph trying make sub seem angry Cain wasn’t vaccinated even tho didn’t exist. know, bit whole genes bit little irresponsible wording all.  think best way decide look data. I'd seek Pfizer filings, FDA records, honestly - Google Scholar. - remember COVID killed 700,000 Americans, avoiding priority! people mentally developed past children. sad. Huh 19 months late party. Damage done already. Hey, also morons support 'my ignorance good knowledge.’ Issac Asimov  ""tell got upset Parlor without ever logging *or* even knowing prior news"" No, idiot parents idiotic beliefs raise kids mold believe like do. Perhaps backfires could help instill critical thinking skills personal responsibility folks? highly exposed work 6 months since recent dose definitely get third dose; reduce risk infection substantially even top high protection already 2 doses. Whether pfizer really matter.   know that's gonna make anti vaxxers worse Good holy shit finally unfortunately late anti-Vaxxers think it’s confirmation bias Full fda approval, however long takes I’m sure, actually. think ‘working class’ sports AFL rugby league. Usually posh kids play rugby union cricket. I’m convinced union/cricket players fans less racist, maybe it’s unacceptable openly express it? ""Well heeled big wheel... 
Ha ha, charade are"" people like ""why can't empathy morons died spreading covid"" energy people shrines dedicated mass murderers shoot end killing spree. wouldn’t say it’s useless. It’s studies like help define “long Covid” examining prevalence various symptoms. symptoms pan definitive association Covid infection others won’t. Eventually “long Covid” renamed something like SARs-Cov2 post viral syndrome come working definition like 6 months duration, history positive COVID test presumptive positive, 3 list 9 symptoms. course I’m making last part studies needed entity defined. Overwhelming majority want vaccine.

I issue this. Checks profile. Yup, whole bunch covid misinformation. Surprise surprise really care insider thinks. wanna pro anti vax side people moment heard vaccine mask helped keep hospitals filled people dying would rather trust conspiracy. people knew covid around continuously spread misinformation hate towards got vaccine masked up. deserve memorial idiots washington people know regrets learned serious covid is. Including youtube? Good bye free speech, hello slippery slope don’t know people upset people supposedly mocking dead. people receiving end _years_. Look Westboro Baptist Church. Everyone gay people American service men women. tables flipped, suddenly everyone upset it?  I'm PhD psychology, MD, instinct continue got. Good luck!  Agents chaos HCA sub predates vaccine several months. namesake died vaccine. 

So pretty much everything said untrue. 

It’s misinformation spreaders getting much deserved karma. anti vaxxers.  Ok theres difference sympathy respecting someones family die.

Shit, people saying respect healthcare workers make fun people literally died. thats youre doing.

I nurse, saw 3 unvaccinated patients die last month. Yknow last thing mind? Telling families stupid was. 

I dont like seeing people die. Yet every day popular page reddit see people making fun mourning families. Families openly admitting getting vaccinated horrible mistake. herman caine subreddit ashamed themselves.  fair tbh 

I wish folks talk would adopt discord could burn account completely, rn messenger tricky one! CSF manifest medically measurable symptoms (not easily measurable, is), guess many docs wonder real. Sadly. That’s thing. dead mocked lengthy social media accounting parroting false info mocking masks vaccines. It’s numbers mocked. It’s even unvaccinated people mocked. It’s people outspokenly pro-Covid, refused preventative measures including preliminary legitimate treatment initially diagnosed, insisting useless ivermectin. That’s wrote don’t understand.

I’m ethicist don’t presume one.

I’m sure there’s good reason stance, don’t see it, mainly negative emotions antivaxxers stir within me. already got third Moderna booster full dose. immunocompromised became eligible August. lot us folks category already got it. vax resistant people perpetuate vast majority community spread. holy shit lack even basic understanding vaccines work. Absolutely agree. don’t think human equipped deal mass waves public hate come going viral vid racist behaviour, hope it’s suggestive trend towards behaviour becoming less less acceptable. Especially lot racist behaviour invisible people don’t deal racism, would deny racism even happened. I’m woman know absolutely infuriating guy tells something sexist didn’t happen you. imagine feels similar many POC. Bring mobile phones, think! Xi told it. Finally would say sites like YouTube, FB. Etc huge role missinformation going around sure century think live germ theory prevalent train thought since late 1800s.  Talking people like talking toddler figured world exists outside self.  forget, federal highway funding contingent seatbelt laws, conflating drinking age set 21? reason H202 decomposes H20 gives oxygen ion. oxygen ion happily bond molecules ready accept (preferably another oxygen ion forming 02 gas), rip apart molecules weaker bonds one would form given opportunity to. property gives antibacterial properties, ions discriminate proteins lipids make bacteria viruses, ones body's cells. believe me, ask anyone handles peroxide industrial level see much PPE wear working directly high concentration. Amusing, assume anyone would want go see UCLA game. Yeah fix gun laws, sales bulletproof backpacks kids tank.   animals rights humans, simple that. euthanizing infected animal standard procedure courage, lack imagination?   unethical mock them. want free. /s People aren’t targeting “all unvaccinated people” HCA. recognize people can’t get vaccinated maybe fearful.

The rules include nominees award winners demonstrated history anti-mask/anti-vax/Covid hoax sentiments social media public. spend time see nominees award winners share anti-vax, anti-restrictions, “you sheeple” memes. Factopedia. Like Wikipedia peer review documents degree subject matter News flash, vaccinated people spread Maybe Covid worst thing given inability smell though...   kind comment 👍🏻 Lets threaten gets family friends vaccinated stop calling him. What's left Dont wanna hurt dead idiots feelings all. Healthy discourse work, ridicule logical way deal people. that's crux matter. Eugenics inherently bad science presented accurate sake politics. Science tool, ethical use matter philosophy, application politics. told straight face scientists faking results pcr testing little trained visitor. well ""everything counted covid"". proceeded tell ""no ma'am, faking results, I've extensive training able put on, believe arnt receiving extra pay"" morons. permit certificate even touch equipment lab, I've started carrying qc report show idiots results reported out. No, covid put unless found covid. anything year flu reported. Thank hard work. 

I real skin game speak like do. work IT. Even feel way kinds people. imagine extra insulting working hard pandemic. Glad decide hold breath right thing. I'd dead people believed YouTube would surely stop anything really dangerous. people actively killing people dumb beliefs. They’re constantly harassing mocking people want safe. They’re filling hospitals people emergency needs suffering. It’s beliefs, they’re actively harm it’s hard sympathy deliberate ignorance. late, Anti-Vaxers already made mind. Definitely this.

In addition juggling balls, /u/academiac Mr. James also engages truckloads marketing.

And utilizing exact language anti-vax community uses feign intellectualism great marketing. guess I’m cruel want go catch new HCA posts Well, bloody time. Man imagine getting entire degree science, working forefront pandemic, still denying well established vaccination could protect you.  HCA killing anyone. Anti-vaxxers are. Hey Insider, please review 'ethics' try again. company decided yo get ahead curve mandate holy shit dude. fucking stay home since you’re one spreading fucking disease. 

you insufferable. Yeah, go hang antivaxxers discuss bullshit. ethical stupid deadly threat around you? get covid, plan start attending rallies. all, hoax. harm right? need makes feel better shit family gone pieces shit. Every dead one makes world better place. know police officer whose department mandated vaccine, quit. 

Except retirement age anyway, really retire act like quit due mandates. Really brave walking away full pension...  Begging?!?! basically said 'stop f''n idiots' called everyone morons. hope people call even now. Shouldn’t told everyone knew needs done.

No games, get vaccinated get fired. Zero middle ground. surprising Reddit harbor inhumanity damned time? Thank I'm sorry ""X% people experienced one symptoms 6 months infection"" completely, entirely worthless result. results always phrased relative control group.

The study even *has* control group, flu patients. says 9 features frequently reported COVID-19 influenza (with overall excess incidence 16.60% hazard ratios 1.44 2.04, p &lt; 0.001)

But sure, sounds much less scary ""30% people suffer long covid symptoms"". goes say tell people do. He's role model. Grow pair fucking oversized ball throwing goofball. Found guy watch shooty hoops. No, exists countries. US even lacks school level fans plain rude competition. families unvaccinated people die covid suing antivax media creators. hazard pay button?  Let people learn deadly mistake. I'm waiting Moderna's flu/covid shot combo supposed roll month. Oh god. awful. I’m Tasmania, pretty Mississippi Australia, there’s lot problems poverty heard half population functionally illiterate. Half! don’t think issue seeking death via stupidity.  really mocking post things said final death notice. Wearing plate carrier grocery store nowadays.  take joy seeing it.

But play stupid games, win stupid prizes, kind punishment idiot. really came hate expression ""I research"", one way another.

Sure, might well mean ""I went peer reviewed papers made conclusion"".

However often means""I liked Facebook post one"".

I mean, fuck, informed important, end day CDC local equivalent recommends get shot get fucking shot. Possibly without expectation praise Twitter. It’s little late isn’t it. That's less true, *most* people. I'm also prepared that––after booster. case I've already brush death due viral illness years ago, risk assessment different.

But booster, 6 months initial 2 rounds? That's good realistically going get start treating like flu+vaccine year. I'll back normal point. Fortunately people, coincides holiday season. benefit pulling out--it feels good.  stay home? partner critical care physician (ICU attending) point every doctor know run fucks give unvaccinated people. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Agreed. thank work horse throughout.
When people refuse things, also put lives jeopardy. basically saying “I don’t care hurt people…it’s me” data dashboard link referenced times within story. Well said. 

They made bed, die it. yeah NSW, Australia scums stay lockdown extra month knowing retail staff going cop abuse mass protest. doctors saying fuck em. Every moron hospital take basic steps protect others taking bed someone needs it. Ah hah hah hah dumbass.

Someone could literally jack phone service online accounts. Same. better immune systems.  Percentage sad, making fun death matter believe. First expect need booster specialist say do? second flu shot work time period, need get another one. permanent fix. Mocking mocking vaccine masks. simple. wonder what’s lower percentage vaccinated country.

% African Americans
% 2020 Trump voters dead already beyond convincing, insult otherwise. others unvaxxed reading along gotten immunized. Look Immunized prevent. Many credit HCA sub pushing vaccinate. 

If you’re going call people condescending self-righteous least make salient argument. mean suggest 4,000 huge number, ""almost all"" either - deceptive headline.  \*Reddit users mocking unvaccinated people died COVID\*

Tell Cersei me. lot people particular subculture mentality get hit bike, they’d want dead. I’d imagine mean something happen they’d prefer hitting head passing instantly, rather living thrown across pavement. 

I suppose understand sentiment extent, one wants pain last moments, I’d imagine it’s unlikely you’d land head get knocked unconscious, rather land face lose pretty much instantly. 

It’s understandable sentiment, obviously thought through. may hard comprehend, us care people EVEN disagree would prefer people done die unnecessarily. it’s called compassion. besides basic human decency, children immunocompromised individuals cannot receive vaccine rely others get so, well healthcare front line workers taking care people result increased risk exposure also don’t want fucking die. 

it’s genuinely insane it’s hard people like understand this. understand percentages work, care? famous youtubers like hodget twins? anti vaxxine. Sorry asked already, likely huge surge cases winter vaccines+ high immunity delta? Actually, confidently suggesting private companies can’t censor glaring indictment education system Good bot ☺ Wish wouldnt censor news china Yeah, prevent person stupid things anymore…but people don’t want change. almost got point. Anti vaxx shit costs lives. Thank you!!! legit felt like echo chamber reading comments. Smh. pose threat airplane seat, okay lol saw mentioned Ben Shapiro. case know, Ben Shapiro grifter hack. find anything he's said compelling, keep mind also says things like climatologists can't predict 10 years now. can't explain warming last 15 years. static trend regard temperature 15 years.

Honestly rise rhetoric skeeves out, (anecdotally) hear more, especially AZ, guns everywhere. sure people fantasize violence endgame, see big-talkers balls act random innocents, antivax stuff another bullshit pretext ""other"" eventually lash perceived ideological ""enemies"".  It’s “censoring” done private company. every right company, separate government, remove block content want. It’s violating“free speech”. first amendment protects government literally nothing companies like YouTube Twitter Reddit deciding don’t want host idiotic, death causing misinformation. fucking stupid? little late again…. expect I'm full resentment hatred give shit anyone else themselves. ciricumstances. pearl clutching piece shit outlets care many conservatives calling death others online every single day. flat earth vids next  spread medicaly dangerous disinformation (you know, crime,)

What crime? Strongly disagree. Anti vaxx stuff banned.

And 'censorship' wrong word.  yet ban forms bullshit like family vlog channels  Basically form discussion debate classified misinformation Two things true:

Almost employees (96%) vaccinated.

Because scale company large number employees (4000) may terminated.

Scale matters. previous employer 50 people office it’d mean 2 would complied rate.  They’re telling think. they’re telling use website for. allowed use service spread misinformation. aren’t good faith discussions vaccine efficacy epidemiology. No. two centuries. saw 2.2 days ago. HA! Checkmate atheists. ... leave fucking ban jerk posts anti vaxx stuff.  Yep, ""still censoring information"" - ignoring less reach. sure ignoring that. mean, people really pose threat others okay lol Buh bye, disease spreading dimwits.   Great. They're taking chi-com model. world needs.  all, mean time ban start, 18 months ago. damage done. Open eyes   community medical information service. closest way describing meme community.

There's always line sand that's ethics  distract everyone deleting ""I can't believe done this"" video Try strawman peoples viewpoints see goes. makes feel better. majority people dying probably people choose get vaccinated. Ugh, that’s slippery slope, friend. long liberals deemed “feeble minded” laws passed protect themselves.

I don’t agree anti-vaxxers would scary world live in. chose make posts? chose make posts public? chose announce Covid ask prayer warriors? antivaxxers.

A lot kids fed are. significantly less resources protect anti-vaxx parents. scared safety. 

I think need insulting making fun literal children affected pandemic account ""guilty association"". affected well anti-vaxx parent mean stupid. Don’t get wrong think help, it’s certainly better YouTube nothing. 

But think biggest source vaccine misinformation Facebook meme sharing “personal experience”-type anecdotes mommy groups; peddling anti-vax nonsense years Covid came along. 

People record videos directly Facebook, yes. would anticipate “Dr.” Mercola et al that. High mask usage stop much less contagious alpha variant. magically stop delta. 

Even top 5 states 25%+ eligible population needs get vaccinated. see, also volunteered trial combo vaccine? That's pretty cool. Yeah, case, get way gets approved FDA/CDC. Good hear they're kicking trials soon. Sympathy fatigue definitely real thing. can’t expected feel people make choice don’t get vaccinated anymore. There’s mountains evidence showing you’re risk getting virus subsequently dying without vaccine. It'd real shame women memorize number give getting hit creeps.   Soft paywall crusade HCA continues. Yeah, feel sorry them. Yeah shit terrifying limited channels. Drove Tennessee couple weeks ago scanning radio stations stopped couple speakers. truly alarming vitriolic brimstone hellfire style talking Biden, Democrats, liberals.

Wondering mob tarring feathering start point. But...but...where else research?? Take advise.

I’m looking numbers article adding up. Based population, 83,000 unvaccinated healthcare workers NY state would close 0% vaccinated.   look like right now, COVID seems killing worst among us. people politically-induced oppositional-defiant disorder fucking around finding viruses give shit party affiliation. left's version Rush Limbaugh's ”AIDS Update"". Even fat, sweaty sack fuck realized ghoulish stopped it. bar set low discourse coarsened point, though. going back. We’ve Age Enlightenment. call age ? let take it.

Let huff hydrogen peroxide.

Let gargle bleach iodine.

Let take aquarium grade hydrochloroquinine.

If stupid take free vaccine, reason try argue otherwise.  Yeah found data earlier posted it. point original post actually include it. Holy shit people might actually get smarter XD work hospital work board covid deniers. 

I’m fucks give I'm really dreading day vaccines everyone precautionary measures get dropped. obvious current administration cares votes public health we'd travel mandates right holiday travel period gears up. I'm dealing immune issues daughter I'm really concerned without widespread vaccination could still risk. I'm happy continued risk long covid could mean source income. know there's risk everything, I'm advocating zero risk, politicization boosters well, public health general I'm seeing return 2019 style life really really long time. like anti-vaxxers drop dead pandemic made vocal involved political process. enough survive continue promote shitty ideas, likely using lack mandates covid vaccines wishy-washy pandering politicians repeal mandates childhood vaccinations. already trying state covid rallied people around them. extremely dangerous idea say fuck 'em pretend exist even emotionally appealing. know what’s cruel part this?

Being completely eligible vaccination, refusing it, contracting disease, hogging ICU bed meanwhile car accident victims, transplants, acute injuries refused care rerouted.

Choosing selfish costs lives ultimate cruel act. Anti-Vaxxers costing society everything they’re simply getting deserve. FYI booster. can't find walk-ins area Northeast. Appointments only. 
 
So make appointment major pharmacy show up. told specific store location Moderna site, Phizer booster need. 
 
Yet website tell let schedule. wonder many openings.... able boosters. 
 
The one store area Phizer booked solid. called complained website allowing book care. 
 
So.... looking booster, may want call pharmacy double check actually it. Trying find place shot need extra layer complexity first round. moral question business deciding it’s morally OK complicit proliferation dangerous demonstrably false disinformation endangers public health. 

That’s answer.   'muh' 1st Amendment rights. /s  Yeah, everybody brave right point PulseOx dips 60s feel organs shutting down.  petulant children threatening kill 'libs'. show guns areas vote blue, terrorize people. Doxing journalists, death threats doctors anyone share beliefs. I'm supportive 'choice' vaccinate... kicking people yelling ""don't go doctor sick"" censorship. embolden effective method debunking misinformation going point point like tiktok video scientist side-by-side pointing right wrong things said vaccines.

Nah, belief illogical. cannot argue logically someone whos belief inherently illogical.

Same reason beating dead horse try speak logically religion.

Best thing like fire, take oxygen room. case, making space speak.

People wanna talk bs find 4chan page so. easily swayed anything see social media (#45 voters example) accessibility false information. Can’t quite tell 40% consist of. Might change minds jobs depend realize fired cause makes ineligible unemployment.   fans either, think folks followed Twitter drama content  Y'know, love good easily disproved conspiracy theory. change minds, least one really easily measurable. 

Set voltmeter ohms, put person. It'll read infinity (realistically somewhere around 10k ohms, meters can't read high.) Perform root canal. Measure again. ohms. Congratulations, root canal change impedance human body verified experiment. never said going 100% prevent invections. vaccine 100% effective. delta variant dominating then. moving goalposts mind.

And I'm serious this.  wrong. Plain simple. I'm still *amazed* logic ""People get put ventilator die, ergo ventilators killing them"".

Like, 5 year old better grasp causality guys. waste, could've gotten vaccinated. good thing private company deciding deplatform spread medicaly dangerous disinformation (you know, crime,) way censorship.  People who's vaccinated family members died COVID complications also able sue antivax morons. Ok ethics monsters actively spreading disease that’s killed 700k Americans. Mockery seems pretty light compared shit. What's cruel getting vaccinated endangering lives others. Pretty sure almost close fully vaccinated (at least according figures releasing) adult population. Man, get trying do. fuck big tech gotten big. get around freedom speech using platform. always taught speech protect stuff least agree with. Cause sure antivax now, what. There's something people touch stove just... keep touching it... good lord. Vaccination reduces long covid risk. Breakthrough cases occur time. far, seen decrease efficacy 65+ population beginning occur around 6-8 months. Additionally, seen issues efficacy immunocompromised. 

We seen drop efficacy yet outside groups. Don’t give credit big tech company bare minimum 18 months late. made hundreds millions anti vax propaganda. probably saw viewership analytics trending downwards decided cash chips out, like card counter leaving cold blackjack deck.  LeBron James spends millions body every year really got bitter, pathetic hatin losers questioning veracity whether researched vaccine taking it. course did. 

Did conduct scientific experiments read peer reviewed articles? Nah, doubt either. nothing like flu, stop making comparison. Letting Darwin job hopefully work. problem centralized internet is, giant corporations running entire show. gonna say thing. Updoot. going anytime new conspiracy theory gets born? Add list banned shit? That’s bandaid fix. want fix problem, fix algorithms they’re driven gaining maintaining attention engagement.  “Embrace suck!” extent, yes intent matters well. famous flash food killed state trooper driven towards danger zone help direct people safety. died trying save people's lives mock driving towards flood. 

Likewise Healthcare workers frontlines risking health treating Covid patients. would mock catching virus hazard job, even knowing risk hospital worker right now. 

The people like HCA criticized (I see much mockery honestly) took risk. criticized spread propaganda, downplaying virus take reasonable measures protect others. Oftentimes mocking people got vaccine wore masks. presumed knew better scientists health care workers saw something blog. often taking noble stand rather contrarian times, smug. subreddit showed disbelief virus make less deadly. 

There valid reasons take risks. conspiracy theories one them. smug belief smarter scientists one either.  I’m lucky, things considered. long Covid relatively mild. believe you.    I'm sure asked recently, scrolled past days worth threads find it. know yet delta variant killing younger people previous variants? Anecdotally, seems (three people 20s went high school died COVID past month, whereas person knew died otherwise 80+). However, realize could mostly *only* younger people dying COVID now, since older people vaccinated, proportionately seems like younger people dying. 

I guess I'm wondering updated studies death rate/average age death since delta variant became prominent variant. Thanks everyone I’m cool dumb people die-ing. I’m cool people laughing them. I’m going though. power do. Internet big, don’t like look somewhere else. I'd lot less nervous moves like highly decentralized internet ecosystem lots smaller websites.

Government anything fix distrust problem, period. I’ve using Antiva. need new friends. less facebook. No, free market all.  go disable comment section related anything covid. video supports vaccines massively downvoted entire comment section full antivax rhetoric. Shutting videos would seriously make difficult spread ignorance since love crowd around express hatred vaccination videos no, mocked themselves. people pointing out. going get point covid restrictions actually finally ease antivaxxers finally face covid without restrictions. many taking precautions, benefitting realize much insulating them. Getting kids vaccinated going huge slowing spread, covid going burn antivaxxers slow tail otherwise. sympathy children affected this, little sympathy left adults making decisions.

For rest us, going fingers crossed get another bad mutation we're vaccinated vaccinated everyone willing, there's little else done antivaxxers batshit crazy kill trying prove point. Deadliest day schools opening week earlier…. makes think cases go previous variants? UK saw spike, us, fall, us, got back 2/3rds max dropped since, many many weeks now. outdoor weather.

I see reason believe Delta burn time.

The UK's vaccination rates better US's too. Northeast California similar amounts seropositivity via infection vaccination. take long? 

Cowards, complicit cowards. really answer question.  everyone saying late, not. repetition.

Yesterday, anti-vaxx person previously YouTube searching, would get lot anti-vaxx videos recommended me. entrench beliefs. confirmation bias.

If ban anti-vaxx content, recommendations different. ability confirm bias easily YouTube guy saying expert.

Basically, best time ban year (or 16) ago, 2nd best time today. outrage unvaccinated people even let hospitals? completely unethical bringing people around already sick recovering people.

What unethical, treating every opinion equally valid. Someone deciding vaccinated equally valid decision getting vaccinated. One group consists people opposition science medicine empathy others might die virus spreading. care things affect them.

These people causing harm, countries, humanity side virus entire species.......

I think good ethical argument argue people can't feel joy, relief, happiness people decided basically enemies mankind planet die something could easily prevented dedicate lives opposing science, medicine, empathy anyone themselves. ""It's ethically acceptable mock terrorists accidentally blew building bomb. humans! families! They're misguided people led astray.""  
  
Sounds fucking stupid, it? Sounds like ethicists saying dumbasses, it? terrorists died bomb analogy exact way see covid deniers spreaders die covid.  
 
In attempt prolong pandemic hurt even people, selfish decisions ended blowing faces. ended killing instead infecting killing others. Fuck em. Mock terrorists want. think unimaginative people simply character place experience actually suffering terminal disease. empathetic people interested understanding peoples experiences, hypothetical experience might exposed to.


 Whether dying cancer smoking, coronavirus got refused vaccine, number things. think they're ultra alphas tougher everybody dies suffers it, extremely rare case might actually end suffering, imaginative people, don't/can't understand viscerally would feel like.  neither we, choices willfully endanger everyone around them. many months people dying. praise. curse. agree, also hold idiots believe responsible. 

I desire waste time effort people. care happens them.  Insurance start denying claims, something love anyway verdict keeps flip flopping Rat lickers also acceptable. could've done crap time last year bozos. I'm done tolerance them. Part might herd immunity concerns.

With antivax sentiments increasing number last decade half may increased need get willing adults boosters. Tetanus combo shot whooping cough cases(Pertussis, P DTaP) rise. Ok, generally avoid China stuff I’m smart enough know don’t know (I don’t enough context sort American propaganda Chinese propaganda), imagery freak tiny bit.   UPVOTE!!! course are. lot us lost two years life due selfishness fellow citizens. ability care burnt out, especially whose lives risk virus. won’t go way mock unvaccinated people die, also won’t call tragedy. That’s consequence personal choice. easy, they’re anti vax sympathizer masquerading ethicist hell ethicist?

I'm sympathetic try encourage people simply unsure unaware vaccine effectiveness. fucking sick pandemic around giving strength.

These two facts contradict other. YouTube right disallow things don’t want platform. We've anti-vaxers spit health care workers trying get vaccines less-fortunate people (homeless etc)

Haha, crack up.   debate another sub commenter claimed rights vaccine resistance fault left pushing get vaccinated causes want told asking nicer.

:/  I'm convinced *absolutely* understand decisions affect everyone. They're far rabbit hole can't find way out. avoid overwhelmed guilt anguish misery they're causing (often families) psyches resorting straight lying themselves.

""It's vaccinated spreading disease.""

""Masks work.""

""People died vaccine.""

Do either believe that? chance. message us themselves.  keep saying this, people also realize lot people killed car accidents someone unrestrained car barrel rolls flips, body hitting them. death, severe injury. I'm talking someone multiple people car restrained, hit someone who's wearing seatbelt flying around cabin.

Another thing happen knocked initial impact restrained, car veer across traffic cause additional accidents injuries damage rolls unconscious person behind wheel. god, solipsism less high level thinking ape. Thank contributions fight virus. really remarkable got point society. living movie idiocracy real time. I've closest friends argue big deal wife whose nurse hospital run covid patients ventilators last spring. wife wear garbage bags cause protective gear, reuse mask week straight, cry sleep night cause crippling anxiety faced go back hell next day. yea, people immediate circle sick must made up. 

One one unvaxed friends getting various reasons (work mandates, inconvenience able go certain places). think lot us vaxed place run patience people holding us back moving this. chance protect family, get sick consequences entirely bear. 

The scary thing people we'll shit future disasters face.  remember back high school ninja motorbike came kids getting them. Michigan passed helmet law “friends” found loop hole, law required helmet worn, would strap knee.

The law amended include “worn accordance manufactures specifications head.” (Close enough). People seem find joy circumventing law finding loop hole!  enjoy subreddit much next person, wish comments would dial back glee. It’s one thing roll eyes shake head. It’s another thing actively take pleasure suffering death heartbreak stake here. think subreddit could *very* effective tool converting skeptics get vaccinated, feel like comments section holds back achieving full potential. Good.  clear said ""regardless party"" means particular (pandemic) instance - neither party politicize _anything_ regarding science, public health, etc. kith high New York? Even south employers put mandates effect lose fraction percent people deadline hits. can't help feel little bad. lot time people murdered positions power knowingly lied dangers. ask sympathy towards criminals? bigots?

LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO covid deniers literally mocking people’s deaths covid saying wasn’t real it’s bad. wonder ethicist’s take is. don’t revel anyone’s pain also don’t sympathy someone facing natural consequences selfish actions.   already happened.

Anyone check ""ethicist's"" stance vaccine?  “rhetorical question” zero relevance facts matter. explained why. people ""mocked"" HCA people spread lies, endanger others, come back bite ass lungs.

All articles HCA ignore detail - HCA mock people get vaccine. HCA mocks people could get vaccine actively chose to, defied mocked attempts take virus seriously control spread. HCA mock unvaxxed - mocks pro-pandemic anti-vaxxers, ie. ones would publicly shamed prior pandemics, past reality, facts, logic, morals, ethics decency stopped mattering entire pro-sedition major political party.   good count YouTube right thing 3 years late. Which, ironically, cements ideas, puts underground ideas grow fester outside public eye.

So words, good job making problem worse Google, hey ""out site, mind"" right? Yes, specific crime that? What's called? get put ventilators they’re dying. lungs give put one wasn’t necessary keep breathing Yeah probably capture best takeaway points study it’s CNN article - wouldn’t get hung it. anyone science minded enough read cited study. ""opposite way"" would youtube banning videos UNLESS explicitly antivax. know anything YouTube content filters, they're going ban every video debunking vaccine conspiracy theorists worst misinformation channels stay forever.

Seems like YouTube always wrongly removes thunderbolt debunk videos. He's almost lost channel wrong removals. literally need laws protect feeble minded themselves.

No don't. want listen 1% BS ignore 99% truth, that's problem. government's job protect stupid stupid-- theirs. Also definition ""feeble minded"" different based ask could eventually used beliefs. Independent News covering topic also hit, least demonitized hidden algorithm. Probably.  Louder!!! ""yes, I'd fine YouTube banning videos talking helpful effects vaccine, leaving anti-vaccine propaganda?"" 

I'm snarky here, I'm wondering would change anything. ""I ate persimmon less hour later got car accident!""

Conclusion: persimmons cause car accidents People worst isn’t school bullies operate too? Find outcast harass unvaccinated make selves easy targets. right way handle Covid don’t want make necessary changes combat Covid since it’s inconvenient even experts guilty overlooking basic places viruses spread (produce grocery stores fine everyone touch clothes shoes sold isles over).

Nuance thing.  really need turn likes comments vaccine related news videos.  sad, fucking right. can't rationalize person use rationality first place.

Good move Alphabet corporation  Freedom speech maybe? Yeah, thinking thing. people know boosters work? go (in addition vaccines) promote healthy living things lower mortality rate. 

Who kidding? YouTube telling people “they can’t talk that” Oh booster gotcha matter. Even suburban hospital frightening number vaccinated nurses system mandated it. Almost caved got Vax, though. mean medically argument totally wrong. instance vaccine rare cases could cause prions form (I know unlikely but, arguments sake) side affects may take years show. 

I'm 100% taking vaccine second dose weeks (in Australia took get supply). But, argue point unverifiable.

There plenty ways medication take years side effects show. mother experiencing side effects cancer treatment took 10 years show. I'm well aware vaccines little could cause side effects, fact remains still learning different things occur body. 

In principle, argument probably true 99.99% people. But, based fact. vaccine system matter weeks... f people expecting new side effects pop years now. Good grief. got it? Kind lowers opinion took long ass time simple, literally *life saving* decision.   young cousins come mind. kids older 2 remember old world devastated it’s lost. vast, vast majority wouldn’t end dead hospitalized even upon catching Covid.

I don’t really understand you’re arguing against…. 

Parents free engage children many risky activities pack day. 

I afforded opportunity opposite. also receiving 1/3rd dose older group. reality myocarditis occurs small amount study would need significantly larger hope catching it, larger pretty much study. thanks explaining us can’t rush anything. fly NBA / san francisco either Yeah no, he's stupid ball player. people need believe LeBron James instead thousands scientists doctors they're beyond hope. Sigh....that's valid point. disagree. dare plead religious exemption would interesting, especially included expert like Fauci point incorrect assumptions/answer questions.

Like skepticism vaccine getting developed quickly, could easily turn around point no, mRNA vaccines works decades, we're fortunate technology far along pandemic occurred. (Please correct I'm wrong there, think recall said mRNA vaccines development something like 30 years.) number Pfizer BOOSTER shots. got FDA/CDC approvals Pfizer boosters 65+, etc. first days Pfizer boosters. new. There's ""last week"" data.  That’s troll dude. came back check responses make complete conversations rather saying something never intending respond. hand short, inflammatory, often useless comments don’t contribute conversation. Go ahead look comment history need examples here.   even Gary Busey, Scott Baio Ted Nugent. frontline RN myself, people absolute embarrassment profession. even accepted nursing school, proof vaccinations go get titers. entire profession built upon evidence-based practice, fact conveniently set aside favor Aunt Margaret's Facebook posts.   There's part family know talk recently. Covid denialists. wonder dumb, easy disprove beliefs hold. close family, we're meeting time time, weird avoid covid related subjects stay ""respectful"", ridiculous age easily get educated using google, hold beliefs. 

I think education systems blame. learn lot unnecessary stuff, lot FACTS, instead learning things. mean teach kids ""COVID EXISTS"", mean school tell kids ""Hey, brains, complexity, sometimes really simple. One bigger issues minds confirmation bias. Here's why, helping stay comfort zone, bad. Here's counter it"". 

People know search information. like finding information makes uncomfortable. Also ""smart algorithms"" help finding want find instead proper information. remember talked anti-vaxxer covid happened mentioned ""the first result google search \*something\*"". turns out, case research. case personal blog anti vaxxer even sign articles full name. Anyway, someone believes vaccines bad, they'll google ""why vaccines bad"" rather ""why vaccines good"". then, even tried fight confirmation bias google ""vaccines myths"", I'm afraid would find anti-vaxxer kind ""myths"" list. Personalization search results search engines illegal opinion. understand major part discussion subject spread misinformation. case covid searches google used show info (can't actually see search ""why covid vaccines bad""), maybe specific case they're fighting misinformation (seems like really good job), overall search results still personalized algorithm pretty bad job understanding promotes misinformation not.  Good news always appreciated! Look history gynecology. Read stories female slaves experimented on. ""dreadful moments"" go back centuries. Yeah, mean, like there's vaccines require 3+ shot series.

What's say? Hepatitis B 3 shot series? Well I'll damned... 

(At least 3-shot series got back 90s, know still same, think is.) people give fuck publication they're reading though. Lebron piece, many read regardless. days Berman, Patrick Olbermann fun.... sports highlights story media personalities network. I'm glad got it, ""I research"" dangerous statement people say pandemic.

It’s disagree everything prevent future leaks, identified weakness lack security.  Fuck. Talk behind curve. news. Bye Felicia Hopefully folks licenses/certifications. may well cleaners, secretaries and/or cafeteria workers. I'm saying folks important course are; certificates licenses jobs. think people, ""rampant"" means shows data common, one anecdote.  me, would mean vaccinated individuals getting sick much unvaccinated. Since vaccinated, sat across two people coughing testing positive Covid next day, two different occasions, don’t know single person vaccinated infected. 

I don’t think there’s data available verify “rampant” breakthrough infections. You’re going hear people exposed never get infected unless know exposed. really don’t know many times breakthrough case individuals exposed Covid vaccine immunity warded caused infection. 83,000 hospital workers around patients unvaccinated. Insanity.

Another way look it, could prove masks work. 30-64? 65 seem like sweet spot cutoff. That's funny last year lot antivaxers screaming nurses part conspiracy, spreading lies covid helping hospitals collect bonuses dead covid patients that. would-be Typhoid Marys culled health-care staff, antivaxers discovered respect profession.

No, it’s cruel. You’re shitty person. simple: ban blocking mandate ruled law requested blocked order allow ban unblocked mandate supreme court Arizona which, law, ruled block mandated mask ban.

its over, im ever going back. actual human capable independent thinking, know truth theres going back. ban reassuring right conviction truth dont ban discourse, encourage it.  humans seem love ""us them"". case think vaccinated concluding unvaccinated ruining rest us. 

Regardless actual science vaccinated see others as:

* Holding elimination mask mandates
* Costing pile money go hospital, take work, stop working dead, going kind long term care.
* reservoir new interesting variants virus.
* would say critical part fact people finally dying short long term stupidity. Long term fat follow stupid people's suggestions (in far vaccines), short term get vaccine.

This last small thing. think general resentment society really stupid people getting eaten lions much did, society safe. Many people think sort stupid dying stupids somewhat natural order things. wonder anyone data showing correlation officers refusing get vaccine rates complaints brutality and/or racist behavior.

I certainly assume correlation, could wrong. ""not following health safety rules"" pretty much definition cause. cant imagine eligible unemployment.  block Joe Rogan?

That's quite strawman argument there. kills situation becomes responsibility protect yourself. vaccines now. would like continue mask wearing it. responsibility millions people continue indefinite mask restrictions.

Get vaccinated people. Yeah... ethacist subject refusing wear masks?

I'd curious estimated death toll folks attempting fight mask mandates since Feb/ March 2020 current moment.

It easily well 100k people dead decent 30-40% nation treating pandemic like masks form political control.

Not fucking form pathogen control? Like LITERALLY ARE.

So people globally lying acting Fraudulent bother you?

Do think everyone able gather Sarcasm? Satire? Irony? plain people keep forwarding passing along ""Fact""?

Lying ok Global Scale? Unfortunately difficult figure out. guess vaccinated gotten social since likely situations may exposed covid. Mild exposure probably infect vaccinated. extreme high exposure, got vaccinated 6+ months ago, odds actually become infected higher. get rekt  answered half dose yet? 

They’re always going look minimum dose still effective. 50 gets job done well 100 (or close enough) that’s quite cost save them. problem is, deplatform demonetize without warning ability say, “Retract remove video let monetize again”. 

I would board things standardized, transparent process this. way get back game. Even criminals allowed get prison get hired somewhere make money. answered half dose yet? 

They’re always going look minimum dose still effective. 50 gets job done well 100 (or close enough) that’s quite cost save them. 8 People outbreak? 

Seems little editorialized, no? issue average year (where people wear masks stay home) number COVID cases would also much higher (and probably exceed number flu cases easily). 


(You also infer comparing R0 numbers; single person infected COVID infects far people single person infected flu)  12 prominent anti-vaccine activists listed here: worst AFLD (American FrontLine Doctors), using fear collect money form ivermection subscriptions. follow money. called moron reason listen science reason prove point.

June August, province says risk myocarditis pericarditis males aged 18 24 following second dose Moderna one 5,000. 
 
For received Pfizer-BioNTech, rate one 28,000.

So odds still fairly low, interesting see large gap two vaccines. guess comes dosing size. I've people link opinion pieces blog posts, say they're peer reviewed papers.

I think lot people simply idea ""peer reviewed paper"" means. 

So basically, even bother disguising peer reviewed paper. say ""this peer reviewed paper"" substantial number people believe know is, sounds good important. know 'suppliments' label saying 'this product evaluated FDA. product intended diagnose, treat, cure condition. Talk doctor. ""?

And telling people listen doctors cancer, come ~~scam~~ 'wellness sessions' results sued FDA, like 'wellness' scams murder desperate cancer patients stealing money? Finally little late. damage done, leaders Google, Facebook Twitter partly blame disaster in.  isn’t government.

The definition government - ''A government system group people governing organized community''  Huge difference population isn’t factored here. Florida 35% population California making 450 vs 500 deaths per day remotely equivalent  Also seems prudent mask least 12s vaccinated. preaching choir, agree lol misspoke used wrong term. ""the south"" *IN* south**ern** part united states, lower vaccination rates, meant.  Yeah lucky didn’t end ICU, laying stomach complete organ failure. probably lucky weren’t delta surge.

Not every case someone saying fully aware unvaccinated person dies type person described. lot instances scenario like “Unvaccinated woman dies Covid complications sitting side road” people respond without knowing she’s claim “well, didn’t want vaccine it’s better way”. 

People sick, man. pandemic really exposed little people actually care hoe people really care right.  downvote, chill.

They're standing quicksand. pathetic. can't help feel sorry them.  article isn’t much sympathy, much it’s delighting death ignorant. There’s big difference two.  *proceeds remove videos debunking misinformation* Masks social distancing stopped flu spread last year reduce spread covid.  Nobody really knows (""True risk myocarditis 3rd dose unknown 
Risk may evenly distributed sex""), people gotten boosters yet.

It says risk 6 1 million 30-49 year olds, risk approximately 10x higher males, best estimate myocarditis risk 2x second dose. females risk almost - quite - zero (&lt; 10 1m). males, worst case based estimates risk\*10\*2, 6\*10\*2 = 120 1m. still pretty low. (Noting nobody knows, data could wrong, etc. still felt like benefits outweighed risks getting booster). They’ll re-educate virus right you. assume that's catch symptomatic covid. Vaccines already help lower chances catching it. Good There's two ways pandemic everyone. get vaccinated get covid.

Doesn't everyone know multiple people died covid? Neither links provides context know Alabama ranks 4th nation. basic solution which, surprisingly, also not, philopher knowing much tunnel vision exists ethics, ethicists appear come sort thing:

You believe nobody deserves die also believing world would better certain people did, even world deserve certain people continue live.

Similarly, believe nobody deserves suffer also believing would better certain people learned suffering (rather learning all).

All things compatible. neatly unify people deserve (or don't). that's thing: can't always get deserve. Life messy. ethics supposed inform us deal things life, reflect messiness. alternative argue either people deserve bad things certain conditions, nobody deserves life inflicted upon them. They’re conspiracy theorists we’re burning “books”; motivate double down. 
There’s good way win, admittedly. Yeah, unvaccinated folk deserve die. It’s really simple. I’ll celebrate deaths like celebrate every time pig dies “line duty”. Yes, sad. Anyway. Anti-vaxxers made ability choose vaccination issue paramount importance. veteran needed surgery died ICUs full unvaccinated: choice?

Daniel Wilkinson. 46 years old. Two tours Afghanistan. Purple Heart. Needed basic outpatient surgery. Now, dead. Imagine surviving war abroad die home many refused free shot protects around them.

Ray DeMonia, 73, turned away 43 full ICUs across state Alabama cardiac emergency. Ayers, 66, vaccinated autoimmune disease, contracted COVID19 low-vaccinated area succumbed. like save sympathy for.

Lol fact appeared mainstream newspaper. Good jobs lost stupidity. People 175 job openings. lol it? high school rural, lower-income, fairly unhealthy area, helps explain it. Two very, overweight--not sure third, seen since elementary school (we went high school, 4 5 years younger, never actually school together). covid relief funds bill written allow things like funded money?? really need article this? Desantis. There's answer. What’s truly cruel innocents died hands antivaxxers. What’s truly cruel people wait suffer get desperately needed treatment hospitals full idiots without vaccinations ventilators. 

This isn’t cruelty. karma.  best time year ago. second best time now. think larger problem general misinformation blanket things like try cover. I've literally seen relatively objective Doctors YouTuber talk videos discussing studies get strikes taken misinformation even though really case. discern misinformation actual scientific debate? anything shows working. people concerned made fun alive 😂. one dumbass gets vaxxed win. croak too, still win tbh.  Exactly. main posts literally words person question chosen broadcast world. 

So society we're going let people broadcast deadly lies censor attempts show consequences lies have? defend dead crime words quoted? honest wasnt even really thinking that, thinking let's pull tooth, debride area unnecessarily, toss unnecessary bone graft charge extra, place implant overpriced crown They’re half wrong, vast majority (80%?) people put ventilators died. knows would died anyway, number fatalities disproportionately high. They’ve since realized ventilators answer vast majority time. 

When lungs don’t work themselves, body sometimes go “oh, don’t breathing thing anymore” come ventilator die. 

Signed, fully vaccinated paramedic.  father Anti vaxxer sure diabetes, bronchitis health issues he's gone :( go hell antivaxxers, every one you, whole world would came together said yes vaccines many people sure get vaccine died COVID would alive :( miss every day:( Hmm. asking general, referring vaccines? general - coercion unethical. - important!!! - vaccine mandates people choice. NYC healthcare workers, example, chose vaccinate. adamant it, preferred quit jobs. 

Keep mind - people DIE COVID. vaccine helps individual, society, life go usual, hospitals treat people need treatment, COVID patients... Therefore, think ethical (and definitely legal!) foundation vaccine mandate, especially getting vaccine charge vulnerable populations. ton international travel well, plus less social distancing.  Way way beyond late It’s cruel. It’s cathartic. vaccinated dealing abuse stupidity long. They’re reason dragging on. We’re mad. We’re tired. We’re pity. asked Covid, got it, good riddance.   get ad revenue past 2 years. viewership declining, go ahead block content. saying much. Thanks  Can’t even read article, wth school held outdoors well. Unfortunately, masking distancing required. child go wore N95 fully vaccinated. go parties small gathering fully vaccinated friends. best could make bad situation. 

I also think there's risk indoor classes. Trumpo Yunopolous. people seriously believe this. believe incompetent *even malicious* malpractice rampant hospitals stay away next victim.   Using average number flu cases seems inappropriate since 120 million COVID cases coincided flu season *much* smaller usual.  


If look statistics last flu season number COVID cases probably dwarfs number flu cases.  fine mix match first two, going fine booster. know FDA risk averse (unless paid ::cough:cough::^aduhelm) there's public health cost inaction situation like too. permitted caveats they're awaiting formal evidence, reason believe fine. It’s Reddit. It’s everywhere. every platform. websites comment sections everywhere.  I'm frontline hospital worker pandemic made life hell. I've watched people come denying covid weeks later I've died. people entitled, rude even dangerous people around. I've gotten death threats trying treat I'm risking death trying work them. I've never felt unsafe hospital they're taking beds non-preventable diseases.
   Important surgeries delayed, gun shot victims wait bed. even get started someone might cancer right trying get treatment. 
   I'm compassion fatigued, people care directly affects realize they've killed loved ones. There's blood hands feel anything someone CHOOSES vaccinated. I'm done. might switch careers. stand behind you. got shot, tired nonsense antivaxxers spew, I’ve find Reddit (particularly HCA) really toxic acting people aren’t equally important someone world families aren’t incredibly upset deaths. 

It gives really gross slimy feeling others posting this/looking post going, “So stupid. Should’ve gotten vaccine,” somewhere there, families grieving. 

No shit should’ve gotten vaccinated. random people shouting echo chamber people also probably vaxxed taking precautions isn’t going fix situation. NBA got exemption (which makes sense me):

Make$ $en$e me! Lebron isn’t conservatives, African Americans lower vaccination rates across almost every state country. 

Source:  Idk thread seems shit using phrase “did research” didn’t primary research develop vaccines, listen scientists developed vaccines. logic shouldn’t listen Lebron anyway. assure you, life continues on…nobody raising hand 20 years say “I wrong side history, interview me!” Cases plummet like UK mid August predicting. say covid fizzle coming years I’m probably “technically wrong” either. Doesn’t make expert. like Scott, I’m saying: grain salt. I'm refuting that, need downvote. saying 8% tiny minority assholes, big deal even third people quit since nurses low supply. would wear mask Smash Bros tournament prevent stench alone… America's Frontline Shamans. vaccine stupid.

These imbeciles still take it. sure means… serious… sometimes???   According article, Children less likely get long Covid elderly.

What mentioned currently impossible know effect getting Covid child seeing may happen 30-40 years. know could greatly shorten lifespan. 

Time tell, because, ya know, ""it's bad."" /s People actively putting everyone else community risk illness death selfish ignorance also ""cruel"" ""not surprising."" Oh, considered turning TV? 


So youtube global, therefore global. one blasting home, must invite in. Consider idea speech mediums. Back constitution written, mediums print person verbage. Modern mediums, like internet, go well beyond framers Constitution could possibly imagine. 

So mind, think public (government) version Facebook, YouTube, Twitter order free speech internet? Right huge section human communication controlled purely corporations. Internet going away going huge part lives future. 

The current situation absolutely censorship, even private interests, public alternative guarantees free speech (on internet medium)  Ive chased HCA trying make point. Also find HIGHLY hypocritical sub existed juxtaposition HCA unvacinated decide highlight make macabre jokes vaccinated people still ended dying C19, would censored shutdown immediately. vaccinated individual Im support either outling glaring hypocrisy. recently started working hospital worked five years ago. One first new things noticed giant white buttons everyone ID badges. Turns things gotten crazy insurance making us wear personal panic buttons.  anyone please tell many people vaccines? protesting? mean meant prevent disease everyone happy it? Looks like know do! impressed knowledge! disconnected number

Scorched fucking earth response. I’ve seen - except saw aren’t staying home hospitals. stay cannula methods oxygen refuse go vents. hope move going hospitals. 

My kid admitted hospital twice various issues unrelated COVID past couple months time got lucky day went hospital full on. care kids admitted ER 24 hours. Absolutely crazy.   Exactly go plaguebearer lol, even without reference works    real life?  always people reject anything believe people middle get bad info don’t bother check well enough. makes perfect sense, definitely right. really think covid shining brilliant light trust poorly conceived. Everyone wants viewed honest trustworthy person, covid making clear people actually willing go extra mile prove make true all. ""I allow come house lie kids"" larger scale.

This global stopping people saying anything allow ""house"". I'm antivaxxer hate obnoxious dangerous spreading misinformation vaccines. What's concerning think might censorship ramifications YouTube give conspiracy theory ammo like ""they censoring us tell truth"" shit like that. Yup. late stop radicalization, time fuel persecution complex. YouTube anti-vax crowd big favor. So, [For book - COVID, every kind medical Antibody titers [decay meaning risk [moving linearly leftward along risk graph one month second dose. titer decay 20-25% per month move half tick-mark per month.  Note decay rate might much higher older people (or lower younger). 

But still random. Yeah sad, someone died horrible easily preventable way. would mocking solve anything?  Yeah finally found courage unfriend facebook people close due antivax views  Yes, sentiment falls “anti-vax” umbrella equally immoral bad society. People express doubt vaccines morally evil people spread misinformation vaccines. 

I stood 6 hour line hot sun get first shot. believe misinformation bad. blanket ban “wrong opinions” bad society. Banning mis- disinformation one thing. Banning anti-vaccine sentiment includes much that. wonder KNOW mocking someone effectively changes mind...? 

That's said. Wtf? described anti vaxxers who:

Refuse vaccinated protect others

Refuse wear masks; deliberately cough peoples faces

Attack healthcare workers

And draining hospital resources could going people were/are responsible want put - mask wearers vaccinated? Rat licker don’t follow AFL, heard news stories Collingwood Eddie McGuire. time kid screamed racial slurs players. It’s absolutely awful indicative racism that’s embedded country.  asking average American did/do people Marshall Islands.  late. want get vaccinated go hospital.   ...is unaware change number? is, wonder he's antivax. Gotta stupid know that. going sound crazy press left button mouse blue words above, answers questions. Could ethicist weigh getting proven vaccine, spreading deadly virus killing bunch people? think might little unethical posting screenshots publicly available information attempt show people cold reality dying virus. yet still faster Reddit.    helps relax all, .01% child cases result death according AAP. .01% rounded up. 5,725,680 child cases 498 deaths reported.

additionally, hospitalization rate child covid cases .09% according AAP. Doesn’t matter facts disagree people’s perception they’ll reject it. Germ theory fairly standard fact yet people rejecting it.  always proportionally motivated group set undermine teamwork cooperation 

That isn’t “natural balance,” though. 

It’s false equivalency. 

There one two contrarian, doesn’t equate “equally invested exact opposite goal.” 

My guess probably don’t lead many teams? mean, I’ve worked newsrooms, *everyone* contrarian (lol, seriously) they’re kinda trained be. time, they’re team objectives align. 

Most us understands difference *”fu-k bulls-it”* *”fu-k y’all”.* Oh no! Anyways… Excellent point, I'll remember draw comparison. mean, intelligence genetically determined, idea something eugenicists made really good thing propogate. redirect Reddit.com? idiotic thing read read trashy cultivation novels. want people beg get vaccine? received first shot back March experienced odd heart issues afterwards, especially exercise. rule anxiety I'm anxious person, noticed HR consistently 20 beats higher runs point past. 2nd shot much easier heart realm, although higher beat aspect persisted months. odd I've actually tried increase high HR never able to. always difficult break 163 so. wider HR range helpful training indicate better performance. shots, could hit 170 less intense runs. also follow professional athletes post HR data found similar elevations HR. longer, medium intensity runs, would find HR 15-20 beats higher average compared identical runs past. resting HR however never really affected all. definitely want covid think right choice get vaccine, recognize covid would likely worse, create hesitation consider another shot future ones that. Keep mind, work home kids homeschool, risk profile pretty low. decide overall vaccines safe specifically I'm causing potential heart issues?  Unfortunately choice also hurting people around chose get vaccinated.

It feels callous say wanted die badly home instead. Delta likely several times deadly; 2.3x [1.5-3.3x] [this Ontario remains best have. nobody's found difference age distribution risk; likely 2.3x deadlier across board. CFR unvaccinated over-50s [UK bears (7% compared 4.5% Alpha). really does. genuinely never hear Yolo Minneapolis whatever he's called anymore.  it’s really simple. subreddit presented “hey dangers Covid, could you.” 99% comments “no sympathy dead idiot, got Covid died libs, made bed die it” shit see comments thread.

Abstract

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) common neurodevelopmental disorder. classical treatment ADHD stimulant medication used revealed severe side effects intolerance. Consequently, demand search alternative treatment increased rapidly. comparing levels omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) ADHD patients age-matching controls, lower levels found ADHD patients’ blood. ω-3 PUFAs essential nutrients necessary proper brain function development. 

Additionally, strong indications ω-3 PUFA supplements could beneficial effects ADHD. However, results ω-3 PUFA supplementation studies show high variability. **Therefore, reviewed recent studies published 2000 2015** identify effective treatment combinations, quality design, safety tolerability ω-3-containing food supplements. searched databases MEDLINE, PubMed, Web Science keywords “ADHD” “ω-3/6 PUFA” identified 25 studies met inclusion exclusion criteria. results ω-3 PUFA studies contradictory but, overall, show evidence successful treatment ADHD symptoms. Tolerability given supplements high, mild side effects reported. **In conclusion, evidence ω-3 PUFA treatment positive effect ADHD**. added treatment could effective patients mild forms ADHD. Moreover, dosage stimulant medication could reduced used combination ω-3 PUFA supplements. studies necessary investigate underlying mechanisms lead reduction ADHD symptoms due ω-3 PUFA treatments also determine optimal concentrations ω-3 PUFAs, whether used single treatment combination medication. AZ available vulnerable populations essential workers, news clots hit. restricted 60s, 65s. numbnuts PM said, ""Everyone again, want to!"" Cause outbreaks enough Pfizer due recalcitrant knob-twiddler knocking back Pfizer started distributing vaccines.

According Dr. Norman Swan Coronacast podcast, outcomes rare clotting reaction AZ pretty good Australia, hospitals yet overwhelmed people looking it.  Came say this. client mine anti-vaxer sent link story vindicated position.

Yeah complicated issue ""protection"" function vaccine efficacy rate transmission community. transmission low level, probably matter much worry 50% vs 95% efficacy. flu shot usually best around 50% effective.  militant Atheism Christian would kindly calmly assert position, always made digest statements readily didn’t resort anger indifference get point across. 
I liked style lot try (and often fail) implement know it’s effective want someone listen. one mocking deaths people get vaccinated example.

Meanwhile, billion people worldwide opportunity get vaccinated. Ethicist also said nothing ethics refusing vaccine control disease killing swathes population. antivaxxer, ask pretty unethical. antivaxxers starting trend go hospitals

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  People need take damn vaccine end pandemic. Stop saying agree duhhh ""YouTube throwing surprise 23rd birthday party, 2 years 23rd birthday. Wow!""   somebody think karma! Pathetic  best time plant tree 20 years ago. second best time right now. hope least you’re paid incredibly well... I’ve heard traveling nurses making ton money uplifting.  related note, see many people tHiN bLuE lINe decal car commit traffic violations. Really? really commitment lAw oRdEr like kill minorities keep poor people (including yourself) away rich? suggesting bother point? . ethical that?

It's amazing can't say ""it's bad unvaccinated"" somersaults trying nice people... No, country treats pets objects fuck right off. Also, saw much care silencing doctors start pandemic. cared enough, maybe pandemic first place. Unless politician like George Christensen, spouting dumb shit political privilege.... said controversial. Like fact. 

Looks like is, based thumbs down? odd conclusion? Lol

And based certainty statement pretty clear open discussion it.. rephrase ""cheering death"". 

There's single thing that's open minded comments stare everything certainty bais. 

Your words show us exactly open are. 

Maybe choose words wisely think true. teacher marked answers wrong. must close truth! Maybe Reddit take freaking cue. Lmao, right? would **private** company care dangerous information **their** platform?! Assuming enjoy freedom choice, so
do they. bad lawsuits Republican mandated cant force companies things don’t want to! Thanks guys! 😇 Maybe move start competitor since guys NEED freezepeach kill  I'm saying can't get kids get vaccinated (not ever will). Vast majority poor impact anything beyond cranky reddit post.

I fully enjoy watching generation fail. mask mandates NJ school we're fine. Plenty people wearing masks though. one refuse wear mask unless strictly asked. Vaccines work. Continuing mask kicking can. mention single cloth layer masks really work anyway. Excellent insight, neither really. I'm sure country live in, Canada, many provinces reported excess deaths last year, hospitals ""collapsing,"" media fanfare notwithstanding. TIL Mike Jones antivax saying private company forced post whatever crazy mess anyone wants post?  Oh no, someone spent last 18 months sexist, racist, toxic, spreading conspiracy theories lies, refusing wear masks get vaccinated got teased couple minutes died causes could easily prevented actively chose to. 

The horror!  Doctors credible medical websites still valid options, fwiw.  Yep FYI, received booster. third dose immunocompromised patients considered part primary series. separate booster discussion. According Mom high doses Vitamin C cure Ebola. SMH banned ages ago, least banned now. Hopefully, social media platforms follow. stay home Look ethicist - they're nutcase wanted build ""natural"" herd immunity.  Another reason he’s king used say?


“Fuck feelings”

Oh turns tabelled   took second shot, chest pain side effect. felt like heart attack minute. couldn’t breath sharp pain chest. would still get booster need it. lasted minute hasn’t come back since. think I’m safe.  Children, adults cancer starters. guys absolute POS, moron that. Hhmm... U creating unnecessary panic u even show fact source claim.

Over country, many frontliner student use sinopharm fine last 3 months.  Shame healthy part society. Things like HCA excellent examples society supposed work. Hopefully, deathbed confessions, things like HCA, least *some* people get message get program. fully vaccinated (which choose careful research) urge others get vaccine; however, can't imagine subs dedicated excoriating died due alcohol abuse, drug abuse, obesity related diseases, car wrecks due driver error, etc. happened basic human decency? Very, well put. uneven Singapore's vaccination coverage? know high migrant laborer population, know much effort Singapore put getting everyone vaccinated.

The thing COVID particularly Delta, blast unvaccinated within social networks. large clusters unvaccinated, get high case counts, despite high vaccination rates elsewhere population. someone trying ""both sides"" politicization yesterday.  Likely today last day get shot, oct 17th last day fully vaxxed (with 2 weeks waiting period last shot) Someone HCA looked 'ethicist' found anti-masker. people evil. rot started childhood. education system sacked exactly purpose. accident simple greed. complex planned greed. cure. Sorry hear that. Hope get better soon.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* crime proven intended people harmed, even shaky true, feels dangerous tie belief identity, never thought much ever clear. way clearly working, find hard believe it’s best way. ""Still unsure"" smh *always* overemphasized much needs viewers money. Like “sorry guys we’re barely holding need buy Dick pills feed kids tonight” type shit years applying standard medical ethics outside medical communities. ignored bias. Begone  Myanmar genocide make sit pay attention effect world, nothing will. Right, given medical realm really providing medical advice could cause harm death wouldn’t considered arena? Granted they’re medical professional acting one maybe? Whelp. clearly dont understand is. Freedom speech means GOVERNMENT entities cannot infringe right. Alphabet/Google/YouTube private entity restricted that.

A private entity pretends peoples interests heart work harder removing false information. Anti vax propaganda. Etc. Anyone says vaccination private immediately branded fucking twat imo. “censoring” done private company.

Yes every right company, separate government, remove block content want. It’s violating“free speech”. 

They every right, correct. think means.

It means YouTube owned operated state would violate Universal Declaration Human Rights.

In end, different outcome same?

It's literally loophole UN consider corporations would immensely powerful drafting human rights laws. Yeah empower government decide allowed say, happens later line person uses power stifle positive discussions. ban anyone says anything favor first amendment think many things wrong try eliminate wrong things nature anything wrong neutral. Realistically seems like impossibility eye eye makes whole world blind world full natural selection

and virus culling large amount foolishness race.

i sorry people died vaccine available legitimately , refuse get deserve sympathy  wonder they'd able decrease dosage third shot lessen side effects, without making vaccine less effective. second dose Moderna pleasant experience I'm entirely sure I'd want repeat that.  I'm trying say turning anti-vax content going change people's minds point. get vax mandate youtube blocking content feel sympathy, stoop level fucking idiot. really all. ""Make America great again"", huh? Apparently lot people misunderstand meaning word ""great""

What would great everyone would get vaccinated stop straining medical system practitioners limits answering think enough answer me. Good. basketball player way essential worker. right thing continue make ungodly amounts money playing game.  fucks give. Ah okay. think random person charged something like that, except specific situations, best. medical professional, commit malpractice, would considered crime, think. Shush you, like last one fixed everything.   thing is, smoking related diseases didn’t overwhelm medical system point aggressive triage necessary life-threatening conditions can’t treated. order magnitude worse. I’m near someone smoking cigarette once, zero chance kill within month. That’s case here. 

On top that, nobody’s suppressing info risks coronavirus, not-wearing-a-mask isn’t incredibly addictive itself. people choosing ignore experts, proudly crowing absolute lack civic-mindedness. 

At rate, agree shouldn’t refused medical treatment normal circumstances. Problem is, isn’t normal circumstance, made situation bad enough denying care reasonable decision (again, overwhelmed hospitals resorting triage). 

They get credit. bed theirs. sisters boss gotten covid twice attitude, second time actually hospitalized, told motivated ever keep mask prove fact he's making big deal nothing. look damage one ""swollen testicles fiance cousin's friend Trinidad"" Tweet did.    ethicist must new ethics…or simply making *very limited* observation best taking anything account mocking covid deaths. Like taking ethics unvaccinated account cruel endangering others receiving life-saving vaccination.  I'm even calling anti-vax more, I'm calling pro-disease. Vaccine mandates thing solve issue without needing political right die stupidity whilst simultaneously risking everyone else's health

But liberals support that. leftist civil liberties override pubic health longevity. Can't human rights without humans still baffles anti-vaxers say ""We know long term effects vaccine"" want long covid instead? look Lewis Hamilton long covid effected him, still know longer term effects. Whereas mRNA vaccines using decade. support school reopenings reason state. 

But need people packing top watch sports games (as one 100 examples) fact guarantees drag longer needs endanger even children.   America fallen. Quality life gone downhill prospects slim. many people cling “freedom” reason America still great, them, means whatever want. Honestly, pandemic wondering sometimes I'm bad person. 

I'm point I'm thinking ""If idiots refused get vaxed spread misinformation would catch COVID die, would done fairly soon"". lot US Federal governments regulatory power comes Commerce Clause constitution, gives feds authority interstate commerce. 

So, mandate seatbelts installed new vehicles (because almost always cross state lines manufacture sale), can’t mandate *wearing* seatbelts within individual states. Quick, someone! Check balls Nicki does.   Eh...google fine get started anything...the trick google sources info/authors...which people fail major!  know is, thanks sanity break friend. Looks like Singapore full vaccination rate 79%, surprise.  SARS-COV-2 mutate change nearly much Flu viruses. 

Antibodies last six months year without additional exposure, cellular immunity seems long lasting. That's T-cells. work way antibodies, likely lifelong. Thanks, OP. 

As adjusted already?! Mask-wearing everywhere, getting COVID shots Flu shot, even updating shots needed titer. 

Not going eat, seeing movies in-theater, attending mass gathering, it. 

I talk neighbors 50 feet away. 

And refuse work COVID/Flu Winter season in-person $15 hour employees shun vaccine fail wear masks clinic. That's it, I'm done...

Moving remote work $30 per hour things settle down, retire. point looks like another year two. rare rare. Last time checked, something like 1 100k (or slightly more) AZ vaccine maybe little less J&amp;J. 

This prompted many countries recommend vector vaccines younger women seem heightened risk VITT. options available makes sense.   really appreciate hard work. Personally, feel genuinely sorry people feel confused hesitant BS that’s there, get sick they’re still trying make minds. turn corner start spewing nonsense social media, threatening harassing healthcare workers, even everyday people trying follow guidelines, that’s empathy runs out. don’t know believe? I’m sorry, must scary. wanna asshole? Deal fucking consequences. That’s bit similar here, laws state-by-state. important ones, like seatbelts! would feel pretty confident saying crash deaths would common Mississippi NY that’s really sad.  AMA lobbying group, don’t anything licensing. spelled 16 years wrong. reaction either first second shot, third got low grade fever 99 something headache gone evening. Thank you, we'll see happens, we're hemorrhaging healthcare workers right now. ""Bad thing everyone said going bad thing turns bad thing causes problem""  • Myocarditis risk equivalent 2x risk 2nd dose

Anyone want break me? young talking. I’ll 30 January. that.

lol Re: particular group people, many think law/the law apply them. instruments ""enact"" upon others, need follow like rest us plebians. +1  people feeling like better flaunting. Ive downvoted ridiculed claiming talking unvaxxed people fashion anything stoking ego getting vaxxed hardening opponents beliefs. also know people got vaxxed think beaten covid, Going mask less, keeping distance, things. know unvaxxed people extremely cautious take covid seriously waiting another answer. think vaccine offer form protection *years* second dose? thought like flu vax, certain period, basically like vaccinated that's got yearly. healthcare workers first line get jab... taken long educate get vaccinated. 1% proven deserve healthcare, clearly understand science duties caring others medical issues. They're weakest link, continues sabotage recovery efforts. someone drives car obviously flooded road see others stopped front flood zone, engine sputters dies leaving stranded, laugh stupidity.

Granted level mocking probably morbid given outcome death. guess what, people stopped flood zone empathy left idiot chose drive water. don’t understand ethicist tell us unethical highlighting unethical dangerous behavior. sensible super super basic gun laws like “background checks” gun registrations/licenses.

Some mass casualty event occurs gun laws somehow loosen states.  Thank work. I’m terrified getting sick can’t yet get booster. wasn’t peoples like wouldn’t anything. One day over. attributing malice easily explained stupidity. That's cool what's Covid?  Thank work sorry hear people cruel trying help. hope hang deserving still need help chosen terrible. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Thank providing article. What's international code? could spread faster pandemic. someone born stupid poor parents raised area full kids born stupid poor parents grows stupid, much choice have? like saw people getting bullied asked ethicist, probably expert getting bullied made fun of. Well according lot people, didnt lose. That's blew mind boo'ed vaccines.

They've listened followed BS, way outrageous, yet still wont listen actually tries something decent would help them. Uh… dead insulin producing cells means type 1 diabetes, type 2 one shocked police union would lie.  really like talk (fully Pfizer vaxxed) mom’s doc getting booster Moderna

Unfortunately they’re submitting data mix-and-match.

It’s forbidden official stance currently stick vaccine booster. year half non-consistent rules, restrictions, mandates make people that. Especially mask mandates/capacity limits went away short time period back June-August. Gave people taste life long, long ago one truly wants go back rules, restrictions, mandates.  hope guy dies like subreddit celebrating deaths stupid people? Real nice "
