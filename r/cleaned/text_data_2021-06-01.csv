0,2021-06-01," officials can't bothered give label, people find number labels use. officials created name could invented novice java programmer, wonder labels used. pretty clearly give shit, lol  Lower counts. Probably like 7-8k daily average cases 200 deaths. Great point, information make week's recommendation, overrides last week's recommendation, new.  Yeah you’re 100% right. It’s frustrating come convoluted way make difficult needs be.

If bet money it, would say Oregon drops mask rule across board? July 1st? parents can't old fat? think become regular thing. allergies instances high flu rates, etc, little normalization would go long way. ""Vax 2 Max."" That's catchy lol  Thanks. That's good know. thanks. frustrating watching US UK get far ahead, things ramping quickly last weeks. got first Moderna shot days ago many colleagues (but priority job). Younger healthier people priority wait bit, long now. Deaths plummeting, infection rates plummeting, things reopening. Feels good, man. way governor state health department required businesses verify people's vaccination status allowing patrons workers unmask, businesses decided hassle worth track kept mask mandate everyone. punitive measure towards unvaccinated turns punishment everyone. employer thing, exactly reason.

And first attempt policy - weeks ago mask restrictions going lifted based reaching 65% vaccinated adults per-county basis, 75% statewide. Three counties close hitting numbers counties 30% range. reason never got put place CDC said vaccinated people could whatever hell wanted everywhere Gov. Brown forced keep word following CDC guidelines, without trying find way impose penalty people get vaccinated. Local governments low-uptake counties enforce tell, areas still wearing masks indoors areas essentially safer to.

I'm still looking case numbers could still theoretically justify masks, June 30 hospitalizations deaths influenza numbers that's simply make sense anyone anymore, regardless vaccination status. feel like going take new CDC guidelines Presidential decree, strong public pushback convince governor change policy, since that's taken twice before.  coworker chef never washed hands, would snitch? would. matter health.  still restrictions UK? States seem shedding restrictions everyday cases falling like stone, UK’s cases rise. case AZ vac less effective? rest us meaning individuals reason underlying health condition able get vaccinated ones highest risk getting infected fellow unvaccinated individuals go running around unmasked. understand feelings. Maybe small bubble network, even domestic travelling safer way go. Need make sure majority population around globe, including Africa, rural areas South America Asian countries, get vaccinated soon enough, clear road map enhanced vaccines. Yay! RFA basically intelligence agency propaganda branch. open too. expect follow principles journalism. Vermont country. One key points opinion piece 

""“It (lab leak conspiracy) takes focus away fact drivers zoonotic spillover human-induced environmental changes, needs addressed. concerned increased belief virus originated lab detracts real urgent need enact preventative laws policies.” 
Dr Katie Woolaston, Queensland University Technology international wildlife law researcher."" wondering thing. took OP's post asking question, smarmy insensitive. Maybe missed something? internet, knows people thing here. Actual complaints/excuses I've heard myself, asking acquaintances/friends they'd get vaxxed full FDA approval:

""*I'm getting child get it*."" 

""*I can't get it; I'm fertile years/pregnant/breastfeeding*."" 

""*I put anything body market least five years*."" 

""*I need get it; herd immunity now*."" 

""*I can't afford take time work side effects make sick*."" 

And I'm certain many, many more. truly believe people never convinced. recently lost 45 cashcow gotta something make people watch Yeah, actually think that. make zero difference spread Covid, guess that's advantage. work barriers meant keep us socially distant can't wait get rid I'm constantly banging serve function whatsoever. Im struggling follow.

The UK full vaccine manufacturing capacity around 2m doses per week AZ. UK also vaccinated around 70% first doses 50% second doses.

The UK contain half EU production capacity, given 200m+ doses created EU, possible. factories Belgium/Germany/Netherlands produce far more.

There also much four manufacturing sites EU. That’s April. It’s old news. know people billed theirs, using “physicians fee” reason. went mass vaccine sites, others smaller ones. Seems insurance companies try anything milk it’s worth. according Chilean authorities, case unvaccinated people, health minister information it, also said article compare covid cases among vaccinated unvaccinated people.   Nerp  key talking relatively. benefit vaccine *in area 20x higher risk* effectively neutralized *relative place lower risk*. get feeling person replying may taking comment literally. Yea people craving know country variant first discovered in.

Let's experiment: mention **kappa** variant.

Didn't immediately get craving know, country variant first discovered in? ...Ho, Lee, Fuk... must MiB reference somewhere.

The good thing high adoption rate lot cultural pressure there, surprised got well past 80%. don’t. It’s security theater. long full name, birthdate says done less 72 hours trip accept it. got harrowing (for me) dental appointment listening meditation YouTube video fear dentist.

This goes fast barely time sit down. find something listen concentrate on. Predictions US cases deaths July 4th?


I'm going say 7 day case average 10k 250 deaths Ontario. Nah dude seems solid grasp issues. Let's hear pulled directional floor stickers/signs last week. whatever that's worth. Plexiglas still place really expect go anywhere. wear one people can't see mouthing pissed words them. control temper risk getting shot. work: Likewise Atlantic Canada anti-vaxxers know least 5 excuses use FDA shoots one. (""I'm getting child get it."" ""I can't get it; I'm fertile years/pregnant/breastfeeding."" ""I put anything body market least five years."" need get it; herd immunity now."" ""I can't afford take time work side effects make sick."" *These actual excuses said me.)*

But even 1% vax-hesitant folks agree vaxxed EUA turns FDA approval, that's still jabs arms. we'll accept people *always* find excuse take it. It’s kind gross, they’re obviously trying muddy waters spread vaccine hesitancy vis-a-vis Sinovac vaccine. 

Which... guess? US Government’s best geopolitical interests, certainly isn’t American people’s best interests: everyone, everywhere, hope people - matter borders - get vaccinated soon possible mitigate chance new variants popping up.

The United States already propaganda win - Moderna vaccine stunningly effective. Maybe leave that? perspex barriers could see leaving lol. idk much covid, anything, they're simple measure i've heard lot service workers getting harassed less, good. 

Haven't seen gloves long long time. distancing largely ignored, least california. would know place got tested legit? Lets goooooi something could look forward locked home year. Remember years ago buildings homes burned prevent contagion. don’t wish anyone need better “containment” currently capable of.  mean point one, would’ve impossible get vaccinated EUA approval (unless part clinical trials). There’s also border restrictions - can’t drive Canada Mexico unless it’s “essential” travel. ""Mini"" outbreak outbreak contained quickly ""mini"". Imagine every ""mini"" outbreak China contained last year. doctors everyone involved pandemic forgotten. Without them, would trouble. great news Per capita middle road new cases. two hot spots right Washington Colorado. Please stop watching cable news. like idea better. January 2019 variant? dude got new stuff May 2021 version…. always thought terrible branding choice. remember like BBC pushing articles ""The New Normal 2035"" showing work cubes date algorithm prevent outbreaks. honestly made pretty suicidal.

Notes: 

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC's 2019 population data. Interesting observation automod. issue using geographic names variants instead new Greek designations? Washington one highest per-capita rates transmission country right now. highest.

Not bad Manitoba Canada though. Half production ability UK, 90+% aren’t still manufacturing capacity inoculating others? Currently lacking medical care problem Taiwan. oxygen PPE, beds. Since field hospitals setup mild cases, hospital beds occupied severe cases people quickly developing severe cases may receive medical care time. kind surge fall expecting see, any? Much appreciated! Thank you. can’t build infinite factories. suitable location specific needs, UK fortunate enough location good fits, beyond purely logistical aspect building logistical aspects making vaccines considered. 

And yes I’d argue anyone, UK, US, anyone sitting surplus much morally obligated help vaccinate many possible global pandemic.  Oh sorry. thought maybe another country didn’t know. Lol

Anyway favorite part song goes “driving’ road get feeling come home yesterday” Baebies company name believe Yikes. Get Facebook wherever reading this. lockdown several local transmission cases vaccine. title terrible.  joke. Prevented severe covid 100% study participants.

The song says West Virginia several times

If still doubt, it’s official state song West Virginia.[country roads official state song (as dog bites. ""Do know what's vaccine(s)?"" course question ignores insanely easy find vaccine's ingredients simple Google search. could something people work on. China's sole problem.1 month delay actually bad considering one case. actually quite impressive found it, means regularly study existing past flu cases try find possible new emergence. comparing CDC's performance 2009 already months outbreak could confirm new virus.
If every country could China new strain, would lucky. got second moderna shot hour ago, wait 2 weeks clear Yeah another massive red flag I'm considering changes future updates:

* one [CDC source data alternate age categories reported, including 18-29 30-39. possible split 25-39 age group data 25-29 30-39 groups. Would useful? 25-29 age group vaccination rates several percentage points lower 30-39 age group similar 18-24 age group. 25-29 age group first dose rate around 43.9% 30-39 52.4%. comparison, 18-24 43.5% 25-39 49.5%.
* I'm running Reddit comment size limits, can't easily add additional detail types data without removing others creating additional comments. find least useful tables/data points posts?
* Considering dropping fully vaccinated table non-Saturday posts since first doses seem closely correlated drops new cases. fully vaccinated number also closely correlated first dose totals weeks prior. data would still available CDC website.
* Considering dropping daily change column(s). previously making daily posts changes day larger. Others making daily vaccination tracking posts suitable tracking daily changes overall vaccination progress. Daily changes tracked CDC website.
* Considering adjusting first table show first dose totals past \~6 weeks every update, similar this:

Some noteworthy companies check include Dealer.com, Beta Technologies (electric vtol aircraft), scene VCET. Even many states reporting memorial day weekend cases today, US still reported thousand less cases compared last Tuesday, 7 Day average dropped down. 

That's pretty telling sign much Covid dropping US lol. real cruddy part healthcare systems, particular rural areas critical care hospitals. equipped deal big surges they'll hurting one results lot hospitalizations. There's oversight means controlling China's virology practices efforts contain future outbreaks. likely need develop UN protocols deal next outbreak global scale. example identifies outbreak, flights country immediately halted outbreak contained global contact tracing started. This. I've never understood people seem get offended *others'* mask-wearing. point arguing them. paid trolls. cannot listen Reason.  vaccinations give sterilizing immunity

Is confirmed? thought still conducting research determine likelihood vaccinated people spreading unvaccinated. know breakthrough infections happen, exactly thing. I'm genuinely curious see read I'm combing articles info every day (specifically regard mRNA vaccines, since nobody family got J+J shot). Since toddler can't vaccinated, we're extremely cautious definitive data this. We're getting lot pressure vaccinated family members want fly meet ""new"" baby (who's new anymore 😢), feel uneasy it. sources, please send way.  would without scientists creating vaccines? don’t know would happened US without vaccines less effective vaccine.

Finding vaccines 90-95% effective good news entire pandemic. *full* isolation, social distancing nature isolating. opinion piece highly respected Australian economist. Australia, Liberal Party closer ideology GOP , whilst Labor Party closer Democrats. Honestly, you’re wearing mask, plastic barrier isn’t going much else. makes retail employees feel safe, helps keep safe, advantage. 

As office work, office still up, that’s I’m educator. need work someone, I’m guilty too, go around glass. everywhere else United states it’s gone. expect happen Europe vaccinations get higher, we’re different thought processes.   uh...how worried need H10N3? can’t again. That’s amazing. wish south like that. I’ll shocked state ever hits 80%. I’m NY state masking fifty disposables left. else multi colored masks bought impulse buy sale? Also, part state low would like I’m part even though I’m vaccinated. Damn right would prefer 2021-06-01 Vaccination demographics update

If say due urging, take vaccine condition responsible adverse effects vaccine may potentially cause me, including jail time huge financial compensation you, would sign contract take responsibility might happen me? suffer serious lifelong complications taking vaccine, would willing serve lifelong prison sentence pay restitution dependents, mention pay medical bills treating serious side effects might experience? No? demand take 100% risk? wouldn’t position ask you’re willing take accountability.

At end day, risk vaccination would mine incur, potential ill effects would mine suffer live with, medical bills might come arise would mine bear alone. something happens me, suffer none negative consequences. get make decision — you.

If argument share weight responsibility greater good community, don’t take weight sponsor vaccine hesitant person offering legal sponsor cover case things go wrong them? don’t demand pharma companies developed vaccines stripped legal immunity protects accountable potential ill effects vaccine urge us 100% safe? would reduce vaccine hesitancy, turn would benefit greater good? hook, every individual hesitant blamed choosing bear personal risk? 

For record, fully vaccinated 2 doses moderna.  (I got second dose February). got vaccinated work healthcare employers made mandatory January get jabbed terms employment. tolerated first dose fairly well, second dose knocked two days. Yet held financially responsible two days sick work even though got vaccine employers forced get order keep job. chose get it, understand eating cost paid consequence decision made — decision force take risk, yet one suffered 100% consequences decision. made realize people force take risk willing suffer consequences coercion. It’s always “you take risk benefit someone else” “we together” it’s turn suffer, it’s every man obligation accountable consequences coercion.

So ok, took jab protect others. willing put convictions test go bat someone else sponsoring take risk asking take? Would willing risk jail time things go wrong them? not, position ask others bear potential ill effects unwilling share burden of.   That’s entirely due vaccinations level contagiousness. social norms dedicated slowing measles spread. assume countries require proof measles vaccination international travel attend schools (policies I’d fine applying Covid), that’s it. Yes is. That’s like saying water isn’t wet. wearing mask doesn’t prevent getting sick. need sick people wear masks that. equal isolation? Distancing like textbook definition isolation. need really weak stomach get sea sick cruise. could barely feel ocean all. get backwards? Measles kills 1-3 per thousand cases. COVID kills clip 6-7 per thousand cases.

Like, 0.6% NYC died COVID. No. fucking hell 5% death rate good number . think thing makes worse literally reason us physically present. Maybe felt pressing need in-person meeting couple times year something that’s ok. we’ve proved, put us LA traffic twice day? numbers then. teenage say 15-19 IFR estimated ~.002% 1 50,000: teenagers, healthy teenagers comorbidities, number even smaller. mention IFR gone better understanding test covid.

Source: dated ignorant crazy person works hospital. Yeah realize look good either lol That's true Measles right too, know single person measles age 40. Thanks taking time check it! I’m talking about. Specifically says “If travel California, fully vaccinated, get tested after. Self-quarantinePDF 10 days arrive, 7 days negative COVID-19 test result”. 

That’s April 27th it’s pretty much website says so, though. don’t know it’s updated. Yeah, main objective would getting vaccine since cases rising, honestly would finally get it. Otherwise I’d reschedule end year ""New Hampshire double per capita cases"" makes sound like there's vast difference two states. Almost comes suggesting NH COVID *problem*; difference 4 2 cases per 100,000 practically meaningless. 

At case counts low really give shit state 1 2 10 cases per 100,000.   **did think twitter art?** even close. Polio roughly twice transmissible. Basic reproductive rate 5–7 Polio estimated 2.9 COVID. Hell, eliminated Measles America may one infectious common diseases planet basic reproductive rate 12 18 range. \*only\* reason COVID eliminated lack civic duty get vaccinated.  you’ve vaccinated, it’s incredibly unlikely you’ll get sick. worry whether people irresponsible? won’t affect you. 

Plus theoretically people “think it’s hoax” “engaged high risk behavior” would unlikely go whole pandemic without catching virus right? they’ll mostly immune anyway. think right. saw expert opinion put nicely IMO.

Covid running places go US. Unless forcibly vaccinate every person (which I’d fine with), it’s happening. matter you’re country does, disease spreading abroad foreseeable future. I’ll take compliment. far know, states enforcing quarantines point. US strict many countries comes quarantines testing. 

I’m guessing saw website? 
It looks like 7 day quarantine suggestion, requirement. Regardless, you’re mainly get vaccinated, wouldn’t think would big roadblock - vaccine centers don’t need form identification proof days. wear tight-fitting mask don’t go feel sick. Thanks, clarified need even truck driver. Accidents happen. Whole life scam, hope got term life.

Never. Polio much less transmissable. Instead we're going socially scarred generation record drug abuse school drop rates. criminal we've already done whole generation Yes, that’s done. today decided check oficial California website says quarantine 7 days. article April I’m wondering it’s enforced moment. seems like state follow CDC guidance June 15, sucks would arrive 3 days earlier that’s pretty much chance get vaccine lol. time much serious since Briton Indian variant, Guanzhou heavily populated. 10,000 two weeks vs 400 two weeks probably helping, unvaccinated workers bring old people weaker immune systems means old people still dying. things provably way overstated. First all, asymptomatic transmission much thing turns out. Presymptomatic transmission another story.

Second, scan kids radioactive ct scans hell it. Doctors resistant unless there's real cause concern. promise scanning kids trouble.

Multitudes gotten never know. 

There's reason mask kids cases low teachers vaccinated. None all. cruel unnecessary. even fucked US GIVING money, free food, beer, weed, lotto tickets get people take damn vaccine, Peru, India, hell even Canada vax shortages. reach 80% prevent symptomatic infection. 80% reduction symptomatic cases. That's different. 

Herd immunity made 80%. Somethings bit government control, things like getting vaccination booking system sorted prioritization recipients figured definitely within government capacity. recommend following CDC guidelines (cdc.gov). believe COVID test requirement entry US. experience symptoms you’re here, need quarantine get tested again. What? No, I’m talking chance catching COVID too. I’m **specifically** talking chance catching COVID numbers.

My numbers towards bottom paragraph numbers without taking account catching it, numbers top include *chance* catching too.

Though matters, we’ve abandoned herd immunity goal, chance catching COVID vaccinated near 100%, it’s matter time. research concluded. Odds asymptomatic infection GREATLY reduced. much odds symptomatic illness, pretty great. misinformed people everywhere world. think Americans particularly naive susceptible propaganda overly optimistic outlook. SK never lockdown either. Philippines Indonesia, too. allowed work medicine directly putting people risk. point adults vaccinated, there's reason kids even mask anymore unless want to. Keeping kids lives protect stupid adults immoral. get vaccines work severely immune compromised, locking children en masse tiny minority immune compromised fair power isolate themselves.

Cringe Agree 100%.

There legitimately lot people covid vaccine recommended, due specific individual health related comorbidities. Covid vaccine pushers aren’t bullying people getting vaxxed putting health lives line “for greater good”. fact, vax bullies say rest us need get vaxxed protect vulnerable get vaxxed.

Yet bully vilify people like refuse take vax point time protection health, argument vein. 

Either label vulnerable people selfish bully potentially sacrificing lives “for greater good”, owe courtesy respecting hesitation based individual health concerns like group. can’t morally bring push medically vulnerable might risk vaccine getting jab, can’t good conscience demand you. 

Nobody knows situation like do. Nobody suffer potential negative consequences decision except you. Nobody ultimately accountable make things right sacrifice “for greater good”, nobody able push make decision sacrifice anyone else. Read one article (in Carnival page) said pax 95% vaccinated.

Upcoming jab invitations Pfizer Moderna


The Cabinet adopting Health Council's advice 60-somethings henceforth vaccinated Pfizer Moderna's corona vaccines. practice, mean Janssen AstraZeneca remain shelf on.

Joris Belgers2 June 2021, 12:30
Pfizer Moderna so-called mRNA vaccines, effective also fewer disadvantages 'vector vaccines'. Or, AstraZeneca Janssen, two coronavaccines licensed Netherlands. ""Because mRNA vaccines widely available number corona infections relatively low, Netherlands afford choice vaccination program,"" Health Council writes urgent advice presented Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Health) Wednesday. Cabinet announced adopt advice.

Benefits-to-risk ratio favorable
The rare serious side effect reported Janssen vaccine AstraZeneca vaccine: thrombosis combination low platelet count. younger people, vaccination, risk serious course disease lower - risk side effects, incidentally also seem occur frequently younger people, serious.

At Pfizer Moderna, therefore, ""benefit-to-risk ratio"" favorable group, according Health Council. ""It preferable use mRNA vaccines younger groups going invited first shot."" would mean Janssen AstraZeneca would virtually eliminated use. Bart-Jan Kullberg, chairman Health Council, says necessarily mean AstraZeneca Janssen ""banned"" good vaccines, ""we luxury choosing safest route.

An exception
The Health Council make exception: ""Groups difficult reach via regular channels second shot may actually benefit Janssen vaccine protected one shot."" Health Council emphasizes Janssen vaccine effective safe; despite rare side effects, benefit outweighs minor risks.

The advice AstraZeneca remains: use people age 60. addition, AstraZeneca used people receive second shot vaccine, according Health Council fine continue. number reports adverse events second shot AstraZeneca considerably lower first shot; moreover, one shot offers insufficient protection.

No invitations AstraZeneca Janssen
In practice, means AstraZeneca Janssen vaccines remain shelf: all, large proportion people 60 already vaccinated least once.

Adopting advice could cause delay vaccination planning, would somewhat confuse Hugo de Jonge's carefully sorted puzzle pieces. But, Health Council believes, due ample availability Pfizer Moderna, need insurmountable problem: ""The results modeling show hardly effect expected number infections, hospitalizations mortality mRNA vaccines used current phase vaccination program.""

Except can't allow strain health system, slow transmission extends restrictions.

Society would accept neither, vaccines way out. Base GuangZhou 15.31 millions people takes two shots get full immunity.

So 11.48m shot/2 /15.32M = 37.49% shot coverage based Bloomberg calculation.

'Tricky advice'
The minister considers ""difficult advice"" Health Council. emphasizes people 1982 subsequent years opt Janssen vaccine, example convenient planned vacation. also wants investigate whether possibility use Janssen vaccine certain groups seafarers, military personnel mission homeless.

The Health Council also writes advice groups difficult reach second vaccination, homeless, would benefit Janssen vaccine Pfizer Moderna, single dose Janssen needed.

Also, little effect expected number infections, hospitalizations deaths due covid-19 Pfizer Moderna used

There enough vaccines available stage vaccination program Netherlands afford use mRNA vaccines, advice says.

Figures published earlier RIVM Ministry Health show Netherlands ordered enough vaccines Pfizer-BioNtech Moderna implement Health Council's advice.

With current stock expected deliveries, 6.5 million doses two vaccines delivered end June. still 5 million people aged 18 40 waiting first shot. seems advice implemented without much delay.

167,000 Janssen appointments
There 167,000 Janssen vaccinations scheduled, according GGD GHOR Nederland. concerns people birth years 1967, 1968 1976. people 44, 45, 52, 53 54 years old.

According Municipal Health Department spokesperson, yet clear whether people offered alternative whether still receive Janssen vaccine.

The Council issued new policy advisory mRNA vaccines produced delivered Netherlands higher quantities, also current level coronavirus infections country relatively low. two reasons mean, ""the Netherlands afford choice vaccination program,"" Council stated.

The last group people offered Janssen Vaccine born 1976. groups cannot easily contacted second vaccine shot, like homeless people, still get Janssen vaccine.

The Council change advice AstraZeneca vaccine, saying used people 60 years age scientific data changed. Health Ministry week said would allow people refused AstraZeneca vaccine instead get inoculated one mRNA vaccines instead. least most, all, masked up. Except good chunk rural areas slow non-existent internet access. I've work home stuff last year, even near Burlington freeze sometimes Zoom meetings. lot coworkers lousy connections home. Ty link Phew, I'm 25. reason Novavax approved enough doses. would easily get approval MHRA would unveil inability deliver. Airlines too. Airline staffs continue fly world without vaccinated. Seriously! ships stop state last year best thing happened! ocean wasn’t blighted, streets weren’t suddenly filled clumps tourists looking five dollar crap commemorate 3 hour stop. think lot locals realized con list outweighs pro list cruise ships. I’m sure back.  confirm, wiped 4 days entire cruise  Honestly think really need cruise lines norovirus vaccine... test girls day ask clients negative covid test last days (3-4 let's say), see problem strip club operating normally.  Missed opportunity call Get Vaxxxed. Oh well haha. sure happens right vaccine certificate outside EU. live Germany, got first shot Romania (and going back second next week).

But, technically, asking around long got EMA approved shot, vaccine certificate shows this, problem. Ideally, least EA Green Certificate online (which UK talking well), try transfer shots Yellow Book well can. This, countries, considered valid proof (Germany Austria least sure).  definitely subtext statement!

I simply saying vaccines provided children programs yet tested standards common vaccines. far know, several vaccines tested children, although believe least Pfizer vaccine has. data shows risk/benefit-relation vaccines children, would love read.

The extra element uncertainty makes risky anyone make informed choice child's behalf, think correct provide children without approval guardian.  ""Education Minister Anna Ekström said universities would able allow on-campus teaching June 1st.""

My professor said we'd online classes next semester. Really f*king hope that's joke “fake” thinkers survived like, face. ones didn’t make it, well, they’re saying anything Enough unvaccinated people getting spills vaccinated? mean? Yes, arguing that. would time vaccine diplomacy, make free EXTREMELY low cost ship fast. enough people vaccinated United States right prevent big fall/winter surge year? would potential surge look like? Would mostly people vaccinated catching going ICU? Or, enough unvaccinated people it, could start spilling vaccinated people too? That’s strong word it, masks uncomfortable, making child uncomfortable day particular reason least kind mean.  Well thing flu vaccine it’s efficacy around 50% depending well guess predominant strain year. vaccines like polio chicken pox way effective. could one reason people comparing flu diseases mutate slower all. Higher what? “Cruise enthusiast” opinions level propose crystal healing COVID. 1 year old. China's political tool here. KMT pressed pressed government accept Chinese vaccines pretext ""saving lives"", really give damn Taiwanese people. Biontech issue obvious: China saying Taiwan get vaccines way me. Taiwan always remember ""誰理你們” meant ""gamble"" far illnesses. I've cruises norovirus hits. smaller outbreaks hit well. extremely frequent common enough.

Basically bringing 3k people world putting small spaces. Sure supposed go feeling sick (the forms fill embarkation saying sick) ever honest those? Chances are, someone group sick something. chances spread increased. I'm definitely hurry go back office, even required still going absolute minimum I'm required (HR planning hybrid model). 

There's legitimate benefit; BS watercooler conversations face-to-face meetings really cut books. productivity gain people constantly bothering good reason spend 30+ minutes traffic way balance scale enough. Viruses replicate own. body creates copies them. process made 'noise' it'd impossible discern billion times that's happening body time. [Critics argue strategy could miss important information could leave U.S. vulnerable, including early signs new variants better outsmarting that, vaccinated people may fully protected. may still contract debilitating long covid. still might require oxygen therapy.

And still spread new variants. Australia comparing outbreak infectivity measles.

It's ignorance opt testing. supply vaccinate everyone quickly. US needs help whoever needs greatest. that's Taiwan, sure, Taiwan, sure too.

Nothing else dictate distribution want trusted saying. Unfortunate choices *directly affects every person around come contact with....* Glad back! 

1.If time, please explain Indian variants delta kappa infectious? changes made wild type cause concern? 

Do know Pfizer vaccine shown less effective variants lab studies?

How concerned world variants? South snd Southeast Asia high mortality rates areas low vaccination. UK rushing vaccinations try vaccinate pass variant. 

What’s view?

2. concerned breakthrough cases deaths nursing homes? booster help?



PS. listen YouTube show Amy every Wednesday. think maybe explain maybe Redditors watch ask questions.

Thank podcasts especially Daniel Griffin work. I’ve listening podcasts since car hallway back March 2020.   Sure would differentiate sound molecular noise? cell whirring machinery chemical reactions million different things going once. research work sustainable tourism. Cruises exceptionally bad. genuinely much worse types vacation--although options lots problems too, commenter correct calling specifically. Yeah 75% 1st doses seem *that* big jump done 50% quite long time ago, massively beefing 2nd dose count time went. know earlier AMAs said worried variants much due T-Cell response (sorry misremembered).

With UK releasing data single-dose vaccine greatly weaker Delta variant (though two doses seem holding strong), slightly concerned variant?

Or remain generally confident current vaccines? care health, apparently. ever significant viral lab leaks, whole idea BSL 3 4 facility leaking pathogen faulty premise? cruise ships (maybe newest ones) highest full deck staterooms closer middle ship's height top. upper portion mostly public spaces (pools, restaurants, activities). 'higher' room close center gravity (aka moment inertia). 

That said, would say near middle front-to-back much important middle top-to-bottom, higher gets away vibration water. also usually gets nice balcony, fresh air help feeling well. Tell children without telling children 😁 recently started receiving doses US, source nearly everything Europe policies vaccine exporting. really issue supply anyway, enough doses coming every week (Moderna's inconsistent deliveries notwithstanding). really case people far eager get second dose; even though within 60 days anyway. Lol I'm never going get one plague ships again. background I, willing profess. Could please explain suggesting vaccines based gender much like currently age? (A genuine sincere rhetorical demeaning question) Sure I'm safe. child would go vacation young vaccine? close quarters packed rather closely times, options rely others honest safe, go all. People suck, real choice go. Anyone offering extra vaccine others good. China would help stop making stupid statements. I’ve supporting mask wearing pandemic. 50% population least partially vaccinated, even single shot significantly effective wearing mask. Cases deaths also low they’ve past 14 months, continuing decline. point, masks going go away. people seem think reason even vaccinated people continue wearing now, want know cut is. Bill Burr right! way think sounds sounds. could simulate sounds made virus, animations added sounds, conventional microphone, matter sensitive, could pick vibrations replication. mention basically never saw facemasks pandemic. hope sticks. Feeling weather? Wear facemask! go inclusive resort something ?

Obviously somewhat comparable experience.  readily. Studies show even asymptomatic infections reduced vaccines. viral load overwhelms immune system course, higher unvaccinated person. Kind of, think people general feeling could get sick room, despite told. One odd wisdom crowds things. conclusions seem suspect much like early studies myocarditis athletes ended overblown. Note following incidence myocarditis approximately 1.5 million cases worldwide per year. Incidence usually estimated 10 20 cases per 100,000 persons. overall incidence unknown probably underdiagnosed. United States, frequency myocarditis difficult ascertain many cases subclinical. community-based populations, prevalence outcomes myocarditis unknown epidemiologic studies suggest majority Coxsackie B virus infections, important cause myocarditis subclinical, thus following benign course. According estimates, 1% 5% patients acute viral infections may involve myocardium. majority patients young healthy. Individuals susceptible include children, pregnant women immunocompromised. ""

So incidence normally 1 10,000 1 20,000 total population. also states overall incidence unknown probably undiagnosed, potentially higher. also states majority patients young healthy. total population incidence 1 10,000 focus young healthy segment population would surprising find incidence 1 6,000 among group? 

Also note that, ""Myocarditis begins direct invasion infectious agent subsequent replication within around myocardium causing myonecrosis"". think vaccine infectious agent mechanism causing this? know speak. can't tell us harmful, keep opinion (not opinion really tho') :) Whenever hear someone go immune system, think cytokine storms dark chuckle myself... cry little.   make sense. 

I get sick time would always feel terrible couple days it.

So would sacrifice 2 days pay order get flu vaccine usually 40% effective. long take virologist? Also mRNA vaccines speed time viral epidemic/pandemic vaccine ready heck vaccinating instead locking down? vaccinate going keep happening over, lockdowns expensive vaccines!

Just get everyone vaccinated, worry anymore. Yeah. I'm commenting possible interest something, also accept maybe someone else does. focus negatives something ignore possible positives, easy remain baffled. consider different aspects, good bad, understanding something appeals someone else much less baffling.  'no particular reason'?!?!?!!?  


After year pandemic, still know 'why' still good idea wear mask?!  


God DAMN. guess surprised... yeah exactly projecting? 

Your insecurities motivations onto me. ""That's can't let go wrong start thing."" ""But can't let go expert opinions ""believe science"" even one second admit wrong science wrong too."". 

You know enough opinions state things. either projecting insecurities throwing whatever accusations see sticks. Makes little difference me. :) half dozen female friends experienced major menstrual changes quite side effects directly following vaccination. seen research this? Many friends concerns boosters future, especially friends whose periods already painful problematic.

Ps love show keep up! from. Look again. sub almost outlived usefulness. It’s fear mongering point ^^^ This. vaccines extremely safe absolutely safe. getting vaccinated risk rare side-effects ignore/misweigh risks getting infected.

Neither choice absolutely risk free risk/benefit numbers massively favor getting vaccinated.  truly weird caring lives safety others vilified 'certain group people'. (To put politely) really need cruise lines. remember COVID March 2020, lost taste smell 5 days. sister lost 2 months. regained it. weird month, carbonated beverages tasted sour. would drink soda tasted sour. fixed month.   uk vaccine uptake absolute blessing. i've privileged enough uk international student, recently got first dose. feel thankful lucky. time heard/read people commenting children statistically likely harmed killed covid, exactly horrible situation I'd imagined 'better' alternative child(ren) getting sick/dying. guess sarcastic face situations.... but....

&amp;#x200B;

Such better option kids orphans, eh? /s  


It still hurts heart end results people careless lives others. :( urges world give every impoverished nation vaccines every headline reads. Yes ideally we’d love to, aren’t enough atm 10 billion people Earth mean seems like argument shutting businesses travel anything else, like say, yes, people die flu, flu time people continue go lives, aren’t covid? it. I’m second class citizen haven’t offered vaccine yet. exactly projecting? I'm one splitting hairs lab leak man made. lab leak man made lab made man, virus brought lab man finally virus taken back man. whole pandemic potentially started scientists want us question doing. requires masks everywhere?

Are unable enter places hit 50% capacity restriction?  say exploited. They're treated way better would jobs home countries. farts help get hills.  Anyone else wigged realization likely respiratory viruses airborne we've telling everyone wash hands prevent flu like meant something.

Obviously wash hands maybe also avoid poorly ventilated spaces flu season. roughly average area country right now, around 50 active cases per 100,000 people. means that, statistically, closed room 10 people shedding Covid I'd basketball arena 20,000 people.

I'd qualms sitting, vaccinated, basketball arena knowing 10 people 20,000 Covid. risk infinitesimal. would significantly likely die hospitalized drive arena.

I can't even really process original question *""would want go sit small closed room poor ventilation 10 people shedding covid?""* literally way would ever happen walked Covid ward hospital (almost shut anyway). Nice work!  Every country look Israel giving young people one. There's harm waiting effective young, reason risk second vaccine- responsible almost heart side effects. treatment staff even worse, kept quarantined board long passengers gone  polling nhk (our public broadcaster) shows 65% japanese want covid vaccine comparable us late 2020/early 2021. i'd also expect increase rollout accelerates, like happened countries. japan vaccine hesitancy overstated. rollout shameful, people desperate it.  happening best immune systems happening older ones well? Money  Maximum 50% capacity places, masks everywhere still, lot restaurants still aren’t dine won’t able afford it?  background suggest gets vaccine. vaccinated need everyone else vaccinated? give long Hamas control. 

My guess give poorer neighbors like Mexico, Honduras, El Salvadore Yeah don’t understand people good hygiene. one cruise I’ve really top washy washy eating. Even going restaurants board able wash hands walked door. unlimited pizza/fries. place right counter.  Yes guess like arguing WW2 could ended letting Germany want insulin going free ????

This tweeted Surgeon General last March.  Always been. Pretty sure flu once, would able discern cold future... bed ridden two days. fun.

So people say kind stuff moronic. simultaneously said 95% people affected mild myocarditis stayed hospital 4 days

It say whether people affected permanent damage (my understanding myocarditis cause heart damage always need look symptoms like 5 months out, I’d like know that.

My understanding happens days second shot.. Absolutely agree. Worth calling majority cruise ""enthusiasts"" (ie: regularly cruise) elderly likely risk. anxious people probably already vaccinated. CDC, scientists government says okay wear mask I'm fully vaccinated, judged. Hello,

It seems covid vaccines little effect people blood disorders. know vaccine made people? CDC removed outdoor mask recommendation. we’ve known fir months, year, outdoor transmission rare, even among unvaccinated. Fosun Pharma invested $100MM Pfizer did. BioNTech Fosun signed exclusive distribution deal Taiwan. nothing Pfizer. commercial deal BioNTech Fosun. Taiwan cannot go around unless BioNTech willing pay penalties it. vaccine receives marketing authorization China, Fosun Pharma exclusively commercialize vaccine Mainland China, Hong Kong Macau Special Administration Regions Taiwan. amazing little bit common sense instilled widespread do. shutdowns mask mandates, almost completely eradicated past year's flu strains... millions still died Covid. Scary stuff. post could inaccurate. Good point - updated comment above. Oh remember reading article similar one New Yorker yeah super interesting that's February even though information masting different virus worked different including asymptomatic spread similar viruses got understand little bit basic science. (Which, country can't seem do....) local medical dispensary giving free prerolls showed vaccine card. cant beat that. Let's see reaches supply points. still remains uncertain. People scramble weeks get slots. perfect analogy Cruise enthusiast = encruisiast Pure hypocrisy. UK gave nothing Canada, Europe, Africa India desperately needed them. send 800.000 shots corona free Australia, though. Wasn’t established masks don’t really protect protect others? everyone wearing masking technically protected.. That’s Guardian ya 2020, posting 9/11 seems, frankly...like nonsense, say someone “remembered” every year. think, last 20 years revolved around 2,500 something lives lost. lost half million, thousands thousands lives due gross mismanagement. stopped average citizen making homemade masks, later encouraged. 

Simply saying bandanna homemade mask *almost* effective would done wonders, *that* ""justifiable lie"" chosen. 

How many lives would *that* saved? news rumours this? Yes going check that? Not? what's point? what's procedure lost stolen phone/wallet certificat? Going embassy get new copy? ages 16 ~ 24 : 1/3000 ~ 1/6000

Damn, that's insanely high. Higher AZ it? last year! incredible! miracle! Almost like wearing mask prevents spread diseases! 

Absolutely, yeah, could totally option too. again, convinced technology inception available time... four cruises I've on, there's never norovirus outbreak board, 2 outbreak cruise reaction pain in/around injection site, might luck nasal mist vaccines there's injection. conveniently left part interview said There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.”

Also, surgeon general tweeted Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS! effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus

The top health officials absolutely lied masks order try prevent run them. disgusting? early detection childhood illness, technology saving life’s babies. used technology fast Covid testing FDA emergency use authorization. Yup. 10yo aren’t sweating all. rare cases severe infection death said, basically flu levels really kids health issues. course, judge risk accordingly. one comes work sick want to. Let's focus allowing stay home they're sick, wear mask coming work. Winnie pooh !  think... masks causing drug abuse? likelihood actually get flu bad cold. Flu fuck shit up. Tens thousands die every year. Thank you, appreciate it! Yes, Netherlands transmission SARS-CoV-2 mink humans. People currently looking wild animals (mainly rodents, bats) see infected. think correct say virus stay. Ok, wear masks forever. level risk ok, level risk not? knew someone well, mid-40s triathlete, previous health problems. Dead influenza. I’m sure respond said. I'm sure ""surge"" right word,but predict localized outbreaks hospitals strained capacity.

Same thing happens periodically influenza.

For example, take hospital already near capacity ""every day"" stuff, add cases severe influenza and/or covid, hospital stressed. add onto nearby hospitals full able take transfers. happens even w/o covid (not downplaying severity covid) last post saw TWiV Professor Racaniello extremely negative regarding friends uses podcasts boost popularity.

Thanks advance. CDC says norovirus cruise ships rare anyways like term aerosol. airborne transmission respiratory droplets different sizes. Aerosol used designate smallest droplets travel hundreds feet. I'm baffled empty queues vaccine hubs vaccine rollout still restricted over-50s, within age group considerable number people pushing able choose another vaccine instead like Pfizer Moderna. really took outbreak get everyone queueing jabbed usual. EU shipment blocking blip radar CSL (the local producer AZ) produce much more. Norovirus actually quite rare cruise ships. Here's CDC says:   could, could every disease don’t think FDA approved change many people’s minds getting it. However, think cautious, honestly don’t blame people. Medical stuff gives lot people anxiety.

It’s also still important get FDA approval line universities, schools, military, etc. require without concerns potential legal intervention. benefit inactivated vaccines contain viral proteins, spike. viral proteins cell epitopes beneficial help prevent disease. need booster probably comes enough inactivated virus, generating good memory response. normal year might chest pain attribute anxiety, got vaccine dose people paranoid causing cardiovascular issues, may go doctor? See doctor ASAP! said healthcare workers could get low supply. point would even book fuckin cruise, cruiseline provided vaccination, cause pretty sure otherwise among last Germany.

PARIS – Pfizer vaccine slightly less effective appears still protect transmissible Indian strain virus causes COVID-19, according study France’s Pasteur Institute.

“Despite slightly diminished efficacy, Pfizer vaccine probably protects” Indian variant, according laboratory test results, said Olivier Schwartz, institute’s director co-author study published BioRxiv website ahead peer review.

The study sampled 28 health care workers city Orleans. Sixteen received two doses Pfizer vaccine, 12 received one dose AstraZeneca vaccine.

Thanks! reddit taught Australia and, quite frankly, every country except United States handling COVID perfectly United States failed state it?? mean that's case? imagine growing amount national chains officially declared vaccinated people enter unmasked (if pulled mask policy outright) put pressure smaller places also update policy loss taste/smell vaccine side effect? sounds like got COVID. Sorry, say that? wasn’t small town comment making.

Even 20k means hundreds deaths. think people eager life go back normal, comments express concerns re-opening direct threat az, suffered mild vertigo 3 days. otherwise issues. I've heard az tend get side effects 1st jab, Pfizer 2nd say, 3 FULLY vaccinated (greater 2 weeks Pfizer/Moderna second doses) traveled vacation last week MDW. since Tuesday, Monday, one friends felt little tired normal. continued Tuesday got home, went got test, come back positive.

However, received results today, already 100% back normal. breakthrough cases happen, vaccines effective preventing serious disease. Hopefully rising vaccine levels keep us good shape 2 weeks Vaccine pretty practical application.  get flu, vaccinated, likely less sick million people dead, lost eight years life average, would mean average American lost little week lives dying Covid. I’m UK comparisons similar. Yes, much worse us losing year lives lockdowns. 

The last year terrible me. haven’t able see family, live abroad. It’s illegal visit people last year. Bars restaurants pretty much everything except supermarkets pharmacies shuttered time too. Nothing eat, sleep, work home, watch TV. It’s *awful*. others worse. They’ve lost jobs, businesses, livelihoods. 

What take see aggregate negative impact lockdowns human lives worse Covid ever could been? mean common sense thing us supportive CDCs new guidance saying entire time true?

I'm shocked, shocked tell you. Good luck, remember days well :) Here's hoping make 80 percent soon. :) Correct title: Lack vaccination* blamed covid-19 spike northern Missouri Also good luck someone allergy season hits hard enough mild symptoms spring summer.

Then runny nose cold rest year seems doctors wrong pretty much viral transmission article.  Well, *their* death change it... or, rather, end
It  LA, looks nice tv... person, looks bad much complacency hesitance

Yeah - know refusal rate going yet, various different countries world. 

That certainly interesting bit data!

But enough people get vaccinated, going go away!

Everyone bit! dimwits think flu==cold, ignore news Covid-19 sequelae. I’m little skeptical. lot failed businesses, high taxes, shrinking tax base, rampant homelessness. Would nice article accurate, though. particular statement came right leaders CDC. guess people took little literally  wonderful unilaterally determine citizens another country lives expendable name international tourism. ticket go august well, suuuuper hoping ease quarentine vaxxed people may skip Lol sub, Americans demanding EU people needs digital tracked covid countries suggesting let basically pinky promise. Live WA. confirm rural shit heads everywhere. meant keep virus *in*, out; correct.

Unfortunately, people listen. Faucoker recall like ""we evidence masks work"" 

Come on. Masks shown work great variety airborn diseases, would insane suggest mask-wearing culture Japan &amp; South-Korea (and implications transmission rates) would unknown virologists. 

So either lying, flat-out incompetent. ""Just two weeks!"" I'm Canada, sorry caused confusion. National Advisory Committee Immunization updated position yesterday. Hopefully come time thing commented subreddit wonder is... Nothing life completely safe - without risks.

Ive two shots AZ. First easy (none little side effects), second even easier. assume field day quote masks much keep virus out. think knew, supposed keep infected spreading much. option, hate say, open sacrifice certain number politically feasible. California Winter Surge. said LOCKDOWN 2.0 really willing shutter retail &amp; non-essential businesses. state paid price thousands deaths Dec. Feb., state leaders decided level mortality ""tolerable"". 

I think really depends whether variants lead hospitalization &amp; death, extent NZ's hospital system absorb huge tsunami covid patients. think getting cruise unless 100% people ship vaccinated. Captain ship, every last employee, everyone. side effects vaccine nothing compared nasty covid get. likely get unpleasant side effects vaccine, bad covid much worse.

And absolutely right variants, whilst vaccines pretty effective highly likely antibodies simply covid help much variants. Yeah. Tennessee things like hunting fishing political indicators Deep South time mostly feeling fresh air see someone seem like taking seriously. seemed treat like real threat agreeable moves time. however royally fucked beyond belief. lack natural immunity make scary sure, hopefully guys vaccinate ever problem. hope visit NZ one day (hopefully soon-ish)   whole world Taiwan dirty. One countries follow social protocols set example rest world; back line vaccines, outright denied access purely political reasons. Purely? Girl no. I’m 20 AZ, think gotta calm submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

'full' immunity kick 14 days second dose..... surpassed today. remember reading years ago one prominent anthropologist recognizes something like seventeen distinct cultures continental US. fainted bloodtest before, trust - one nothing. even feel finished. Good luck! think 25k would better. chances others win.  watching states removed restrictions March/April? think we're good, least short term. test next fall/winter. It’s America. It’s world. information fingertips anyone point history, human nature seems focus bad sensational money expense empathy.  low vaccination rate? City Chicago. live? know got AstraZeneca vaccine month ago I've ill effects whatsoever except soreness injection site. soreness expected get worse pain tetanus boosters.

People getting scared nothing. There's risk death drive work vaccine yet people freak that. AstraZeneca vaccine still available booster, I'll demand specifically know fine prevents vaccine dose getting wasted human stupidity. Snap 😀 volunteered mass vaccination site got little complicated someone came kids adults. issue would happen adult something happen 15-minute waiting period taken hospital. kids able go with, collect emergency contact numbers get someone else come site collect kids, ask questions too, could give shot. (No one table came kids never this, long set instructions happened.) Amazing, passing everyone. Slow start gonna reach herd immunity least time major countries tone sub shifted dramatically, it’s kind strange. noticing this?

Any comment article expressing caution gets downvoted ridiculed. understand we’re spectacularly well we’re obviously woodwork yet. doubt we’ll EVER go 2020-level surges it’s weird see sub go supportive community ridiculing anyone acknowledges still little bit go.  husband mid-30s getting Pfizer second vaccine getting AZ first. It’s discussed lot regard elderly. require vaccination card. understand easy make fake one, better nothing. Also place high penalties happen get caught using fake help prevent people trying.

To honest lot people travel internationally people probably already gotten vaccine anyways, general.  Lol fuck live? entirely one else. know did? figured I'd home year needed hobbies work on. worked learning guitar ukulele. got caught reading comic books. saved much money possibly could. sent care packages nieces/nephews every month see person. started running whole lot more. started cooking home figuring new meals. tried adjust best could. Throwing hands decided year ""wasted"" get spend exact way wanted therefore going sit ass instead option considered. AMA seasoned Virologist seems agree. Antibodies wane effectiveness infection, memory cells provide long term immunity mild severe cases also reducing shedding duration infection lower transmission rates among community. Also, said COVID seems mutate consisten way boding well long term immunity. Remember 4 weeks ago 75,000 people indoor fighting match Texas? spikes lol Yeah, Perù one worst ones still want second dose AZ!!! know ""per capita"" means? matter small chances something like blood clot happening are. question asked ""Does mean AstraZeneca completely safe all?"" answer no, 30's. idiot understand word ""completely"" means would argue risk-benefit analysis tips favour AZ

Jesus. talk disinformation sure love yourself. know UK giving alternatives AZ 30's age risk/benefit factor actually starts swinging risk, right? Heck, we've even extended vaccine

I will, getting AZ. Like everybody else age. Yeah, it’s bit funny, mirror US many way comes “fringe”, way fewer they’re substantially less extreme. 

But COVID shots it’s there, like all. anti-vax sentiment much akin say, measles anti-vaxxers: way, way there, tiny point inconsequential. Gotta say, it’s super nice encouraging. Meanwhile, Americans need bribed get shot. Selfish assholes. I’m big fan sours, I’ll take super heavy stouts. I’m fan drinking motor oil tastes like burnt toast gets buzzed pint. nah US anything vaccine passports. Otherwise would border opening deal place now. speedrun any% Yeah, that's definitely true! think first doses really good news, shows many people willing eager get vaccinated. Can't get people fully vaccinated show get first dose! still think little bit sus due inability similar effects Chile (who despite vaccination rate similar Israel reports daily cases similar peak pandemic). Reporters claim attributed cases solely unvaccinated people, doesnt cut me.  AZ also storage temperature advantages. logistics Pfizer Moderna incredibly complicated due low storage temperatures required. something weird going on. Uruguay vaccinated population last month. fuck staff hospitals wish vacation time?
You aware sweden asked Denmark norway help possible hospitals summer. Guess fun ask that. would downvote this? People weird.

I appreciate tracking! [The current evidence use ivermectin treat COVID-19 patients arguing points make.

The argument never whether Covid-19 vaccines provide benefits outweigh risk. Short term data indicates clearly case. argument enough potential increased risk due vaccines approved EUA child capable make informed decision. 

And vaccines available minors without parental consent. won’t feel thing. nervous first dose quick painless process. Good luck! citizien one 3rd world countries, people claiming AZ crap EU rejected widespread utilization. cant win guys. Wishing uptake Australia good. Even though almost nobody offered vaccines, much complacency hesitance. too!! India hammered right now? sister nurse worked Covid patients still believes hoax. understand... talk much anymore. Thanks correction. mixed comment actually free childcare general. Also domestic vaccine candidate didn’t pan rely imports. Went basketball game weekend nice. Sports events last thing missing going finally got to. Hell yeah. Sign up. could quit job work. It’s 2 weeks US 4 Same, got distracted noise outside realise done. free money cause? nope. need states join list Don’t forget though, that’s we’re prioritizing first doses. look total doses per 100, we’re *as* good. [Still good, we’re behind US (bigger, tiny)   idea getting $1000 figure from, US amber list moment means quarantine partners place say Airbnb pay day 2/8 tests £200. AZ first dose experience chills couple hours evening. I'd happy take second dose Canada looks like I'll probably end Pfizer. 

Either way, happy friends UK. excellent vaccine uptake Canada well look forward day travel internationally. fully vaccinated worry it, get enjoy yourself.

Numbers still going down. start come back maybe concerned, now, we're good. good time. :) guess I'm really opposed this, wonder.. necessary? appointment takes 15 minutes. bring kid? kind feels like solution looking problem. None Assuming give adults, 209,128,094 people US age 18. would $209,128,094,000 every single month. fuck get $209 billion every single month? fair, fraction AZ deliveries made everybody. pretty bad manufacturing delays.  People getting COVID house VBRO, especially one that's cleaned. They're getting close extended contact someone infected. Surface transmission negligible. wipe concerned.

I've renting VRBO AirBnB entire time short getaways well. Roughly 50% people country pay zero federal taxes, course support idea getting free money taxpayers. tax increase mean absolutely nothing them. would require Anheuser-busch actually beer give away first place. interesting. ask I’m edge going labor I’m due 2nd shot today. wasn’t sure would okay wait Isn’t basically one nightclub small town anyway? Danish basically says Coronapass valid 14 days first shot. ""But rate myocarditis following vaccination among young men higher. Ninety percent cases picked Israel appeared men, although myocarditis normally common among young men, rate among vaccinated somewhere **between five 25 times background rate**, report says. ""

Ages 16~19 group highest incidence rate, shown article. right. stupid even thinking rejecting second those. Btw I'm 24 years old non-smoking non-drinking male without basically health issues, leading less healthy lifestyle, chances lowest. Possibly today, not, tomorrow, see!  ""California Maryland recently reported crossing milestone, joining Vermont, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New Mexico, Pennsylvania New Hampshire...""

 case wondering. vaccine takes 14 days become effective Face fears, ok. essentially comes anyone making ~100k year less pay taxes. bad deal conservative standpoint. Ah hope well. Ontario call pharmacy (shoppers, Rexall ever) put queue put list cancellations, took 2 days get mine. Good news. Basically remaining 40s (the vast majority age group) getting mRNA shots Netherlands. expected add less week target date everyone wants first shot, light increased supply mRNA vaccines superior degree protection conferred (both stated health minister reasons choice), brainer. think surpass UK first doses week early next week rate Even rich folk, pay television media tell people bad idea. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* misinterpreted represent this. 

What saying is, risks present taking vaccines *are made evident* Stage III clinical trials, prior EUA issuance. knew almost risks prior issuance EUA.I saying side effects never occur. saying serious ones occur insanely low rate even think twice taking barring medical contraindications.

I physician, sit try pretend expert medicine. However, understand statistics. 

""Over 285 million doses COVID-19 vaccines administered United States December 14, 2020, May 24, 2021. time, VAERS received 4,863 reports death (0.0017%) among people received COVID-19 vaccine. CDC FDA physicians review case report death soon notified CDC requests medical records assess reports. review available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, medical records established causal link COVID-19 vaccines."" vaccine killed people (highly doubtful) would still leagues less COVID's death toll. 

I argument saying vaccines truly unsafe, we'd see higher cases adverse events. US, 166.4 million residents received one shot more. question is, vaccines truly risky, unsafe:

Why heard people getting sick them, dying them? cover up? risk simply infinitesimally small makes sense advertise serious risk? This! told truth even done damn jobs provided guidance alternative fabrics making masks. Instead left guess frontline workers died this. we're primed ignore advice CDC. terrible! European Commission talks United States verify vaccination status American visitors.

I idea going accomplish this. bet they'd also best chances surviving...until start hating distrusting Becky looks like lizard person

That's one favourites.
If want reduce population there's waaay cheaper ways so.
Most sewage plants run government put shitload rat poison water?
And even vaccine meant kill billions people, whats plan?
The survivors ""the Elite"" everybody take vaccine.
In words, ""the Elite"" killed they're loyal followers alone planet bunch people outnumber hate them.
And want get rid 1 billion, why?
You're going found punished population grow replace pretty fast anyway. US never really full lockdowns. Even CA (which super strict) people really prevented anything state couldn't? Theme parks indoor dining mass gatherings like sporting events closed longer seems it. Side effects ill thought policy little public health. 

Congratulations participating trial! I'm hoping start setting walk clinics soon. I'm Calgary uptake lower lower income communities. chatting friend works vulnerable populations said scheduling shots issue working poor people work shifts multiple jobs uncertainty. legislation place make employers give employees time vaccinations widely communicated. get walk 24-hour (for shift workers) clinics set would really help. disagree honestly. really do. year life.

That's bad thing. spend year working ourselves, picking new skill, focusing old ones come ahead long run. Covid, Italian study: sun destroys virus seconds

Clerici Adnkronos: ""On beach 10-20 seconds he's done for""

""We shown UVA UVB rays sun completely kill Sars-Cov-2 within tens seconds"". stated Mario Clerici, professor General Pathology State University Milan scientific director Irccs Milan Gnocchi Foundation, author, together research group National Institute Astrophysics, all-Italian study published today preprint .

""This study - explains Clerici Adnkronos Salute - essentially continuation previous work last year saw UVC rays, component sun's rays reach earth, killed Sars. -Cov-2 seconds exposure. Uvc - Clerici reiterates - arrive earth, data important certain point view. Now, seen also Uva Uvb rays reach earth, tan heat us, matter tens seconds completely kill Sars-Cov-2. - emphasizes - exactly replicated data UVCs, however, time demonstrating solar rays destroy virus. among things - adds immunologist - time needed, example beach sun amplified glare sand water, even shorter. Clerici - 10-20 seconds Uva Uvb really enough completely kill virus "".

""Our idea - explains researcher - this, together ever higher percentage vaccinated people, explains overcoming problem warm season"". avalanche infections occur Brazil summer, well India? ""First must said sun - underlines Clerici - element justifies everything observe. India, religious festivals contributed bathing Ganges monsoons, haze sun's rays due clouds. Brazil know happened - adds immunologist - unfortunately paid Bolsonaro management, true sun's rays needed also masks, vaccines everything rest"".

In case, experiments confirmed effectiveness sun Covid-19. ""You see visualization - says immunologist - effect sun's rays virus: expose sun's rays virus infects cells, expose sun kill it"".

A discovery could excellent applications everyday life sterilize objects environments virus. ""Last year's data important led development devices performed precisely function Uvc rays - recalls scientist - dangerous human skin, could stay room applied. Uvb rays instead no, rays normally touch us go sun, discovery much higher importance "". short, put normal solar lamps buses could solve problem? ""Yes. Apart fact come tanned beautiful, data suggest that.

""But let's see experimental demonstration discovery came about. ""

The astrophysicists connected machine produces different solar rays distinct way, grapes UVBs UVCs rather ultraviolet - explains Clerici - put machine hood, took lung cells threw virus. virus exposed different components sun's rays. first - explains immunologist - used maximal dose virus, therefore much much higher subject Covid. used dose present patient severe Covid, see could also potential clinical importance. indeed is: seconds amount virus inactivated, patients causes severe Covid "". First google search results says bring kid you: parent guardian cannot arrange child care appointment, child(ren) accompany you.""

I imagine people want free child care day vaccine case side effects. 

Filling paperwork get free child care 1 hour getting vaccine seems like work child care even worth. confirm. Source: Me. Guinness becks instead? chance extremely low. Something 1:75,000 (or 7:1,000,000 one?) younger women, even unlikely males. Wide-used medications side effects bad even worse ranking 1:1,000 1:10,000s. give warning countries, statistically it’s absolutely negligible. would take vaccine without question hear whatever 0.0......1% side effects.  vax knocking covid Canada. Glad see it. worry temperatures around 85-90 degrees outside see many people taking masks outdoors lol.  Canada's current vaccination rate 0.75%/day first doses 0.2%/day second doses, first dose rate dropping, second dose rate rising, overall rate holding steadyish. recommended 18+ looks good too.  Absolute risk gives insight actual population hand, many thousands people getting covid around world vaccination many died. I’m letting people know use common sense shots don’t prevent transmitting getting would matter anyone else gets it?  better safer options “symptom relief” supposed for. he's partly right. outside wearing mask feel good thing. inside effective point. keep air breath mask COVID still breathing virus particles air.

&amp;#x200B;

i carpool school kids always kept windows partly open kids car reason. saw lots people driving around mask windows closed WTG UK! 👍👏 I’m much concerned making people safer feel safer. people wear mask, demonstrates feel world vector getting close sin. perfect Covid rampant vaccines, terrible people without preexisting social circle post vaccine society.

I wear mask work make people safe, already getting vaccinated. know customers freak out, can’t that. terrible reason I’m happy it, I’m waiting social norm change, health reality already has. 

People keep bringing “personal comfort”. completely misses point. don’t even notice mask face, doesn’t get way physically. notice tired mask symbol person you’re interacting doesn’t feel safe, shouldn’t interacting respect social distancing. course would never pressure somebody else take mask don’t want to, hate half people talk say “I want take off, feel judged others”.  Title bit vague post. gonna make people believe states US, India. pretty amazing managed make trans people. find relating everything anxiety trans people, sounds difficult live with. hope come peace fact trans people exist nothing you. vast, vast majority people get whatever one available soon can. They're extremely effective side effects.

Would say Sinovac? nervous kind injection since child. 

Barely felt thing done seconds. don’t get. get cautious, people lifting restrictions suggest rest lives? Petitions even less scientific. least need proper polling reputed pollster here. That's lot Yang. help prevent transmission asymptomatic carriers carriers masked, even cloth mask reduce amount spit makes open air. actually come ever effectively positive news sub point majority new cases driving current surge people teens seems. good thing far less likely significant symptoms parents older family one vaccine doses. Hopefully we'll see different pattern hospitalisation death turn 3rd wave infections. know parent comment talking about, anti-vax movement started UK, here's [hbomberguy's Measured Response re. Buckle in. get this, suppose don’t feel bad adults state ample time get vaccinated (3 months now). haven’t already it’s choose to. understand perspective Closing barn door horse bolted. really, ""avoid confusion?"" really go:

""There rising cases delta variant US right now""

""Which one that""

""The South African one. No, wait, Indian one."" hope there's new normal people washing god damn hands. sounds absolutely awful

Google olfactory training, might speed recovery help get rid that. California 3 days. feel like picture intentionally leaves many days going low number. don’t give flying f*ck “snitching”
on someone like that.

Hell, I’d even go HR second-handed information. say joke California people talk. hear shit every day Sounds like yell politicians become reality. last year taught us important contain infectious diseases.  Yes, sorry said correct. Coronavac appears 50% good preventing spread. mRNA ones appear 70%. that's seeing numbers are. hyperbolic made statement.  Coming soon meth lab near Deaths within 4 weeks positive test? Deaths reason? the… That’s interesting.. I’m US everything opening back up. summer know well Pfizer/moderna vaccines work “Evacuees”, waving window train. Taken ones love, dove peace, fly English skies again.  ""muh Bernie"" mean....he's barely 18...   Maybe start shedding antibodies nearby antivaxxers lol many children lose parents car accidents random violence? death numbers tragic meaningless without context.  take much comfort statistics. never defined ""extreme"" risk bcz I'm risk group. demonstrated side effects vax 1/10th 1%, vax risk spreading virus/variants, vax still seems safer. 

Full disclosure rare incurable cancer. I'm alive thanks experimental drug slows metastasis.  &lt;1% population cancer patients, mortality cancer 100%. statistics class taught slice &amp; dice numbers look favorable; .oo1% chance getting this. I'll 100% die it, related complications bcuz normal modes treatment cut cancer (or covid).  Complications always foreseeable. Like 35 yo super-fit neighbor covid, aneurisn, suffocated bcuz body absorb enuf oxygen bcuz covid). 

You you. certainty uncertain. Ah, Radio Free Asia - a.k.a. US Government's equivalent China Daily. propaganda rag name.

I guess we'll just... ignore mountain real world data Chile, Brazil, forth? Instead, let's go random unnamed source RFA *says* works Chinese CDC, *claims* vaccine side effects greater 11 per 100k. Got it. use thinnest damn needle I’ve ever seen. I’ve good bad vaccines, plus good *really* stunningly bad blood draws IVs years. one wasn’t even pinprick either time. wish needles size vaccines easy.

Do tell them, best focus something else. got needle paranoia part years ago, still don’t watch inject. literally happens one heartbeat next, it’s done. Although sound like something Resident Evil. Yeah maybe vaccination would lot worse. Remember it’s winter Chile now. look cases chart it’s basically high gotten past right now. it’s keeping cases “stable” referring memorial day? UK rememberence day Nov 11th instead.  matter. difference EUA full approval? Yes. That's person needs know make hesitant. make safety efficacy arguments world, ultimately fact FDA treats differently matters. businesses/governments even willing take risk mandates EUA. US military can't even mandate EUA. reason continue even administer vaccines public health emergency declaration. 

At point want start pointing fingers pointing FDA. there's enough safety efficacy data point, we're still talking potentially months approval process that's kind unacceptable. like think New Hampshire Vermont’s smart, hillbilly cousin. eh, I'll take Well, pandemic always different stages country region, right? 

So, maybe vaccination Chile, would seeing hell lot cases right now, maybe vaccine keeping cases less stable?  clear risk 1 600 000 vs 1 25000. 

Not really risk, rather Pfizer second doses boosters, Canada least, likely Pfizer since booked next 3 years. Clickbait AKA trash article CNN clearly clinging final straws pandemic generate fear doom.

Also seriously fucking hell let variant detected India in? literally set us like 6 weeks back (imo). Fucking shambles UKGOV. Oh yeah, whole UK hit varying degrees, particularly Swansea Glasgow. singled England that's London is, specific :-p   Michigan still restrictions July 1. lifted today still indoor mask mandates unvaccinated indoor capacity limited 50% I'd wait 5 test. Zero stab guy face. exact thought today noticed conspiracy garbage usual. Figure that's left rest us move on. daughter 8 can't get vaccinated yet. we're still ""careful"" slowly opening things back family. like vaccine industry, money barely feel vaccine needle topical anesthetic much besides act placebo. variants especially seems, casual observer, every week changes ""dire threat need get covid fully finished end June 3rd avert utter apocalyptic disaster"" ""Variants urban legend designed scare children going bed without arguing."" definitely get gonna extra controversial discuss.

you’re comparing per capita 4 vs 2. 

4 vs 2. 

It’s double pedantic way possible. Good.

But, we'll still misinformation spread.

Even FDA approves it, matter ""Oh, expect beleive FDA?"" worked Debbie Downer once. actually quite positive person! residents register New Mexico’s “Vax 2 Max” portal win prizes pool totaling $10 million includes $5 million grand prize, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced. ""the rest us""? vaccinated get infected. covid last 6-12 months longer, get infected. Pretty soon enough people vaccinated idiots left fend themselves. even put art chickens together cages state farm show….wait  \*Lamda, Mi, Ni, Xi, Omicron... Fox news does, money. 

I idea U.S. government buy ads Fox News telling people get vaccine. price might high go high enough air it. Back old days U.S. government spent lots money ad campaigns, seem anymore. 

At least many states ""lotteries"" now. bring people in! Also California haven’t family, friends, coworkers, news even talk like all.  coastal elite try stereotype rural people, but.... I'm waiting news visit hermit countries. Shouldn’t reason telling us late. needs faster time tell us suspicions newer variant. don’t mind it’s speculation. I’m okay speculation confirmation. Obviously confirmation good, would like heads well. I'm like, really interested thought accomplishing comment.

Like, 4 vs. 2, that's double, exactly would ""not pedantic"" version double? true, commend us distribution efforts. I'll really interested see relative in, say, 3 months really starting hit wall willing received yet. I'll interested see higher per capita rates fall.  People disagree returning look like. coworkers excited return office variety reasons talk returning don’t even recognize others view pure negative go office instead family leisure time. I'm already fully vaccinated sign up; twice. Screw million dollars.  new strain/variant often requires retrospective study discover it. people epidemiology study every flu cases. usually well abnormal begin show people realize new virus emerged.
To grasp challenge, think 2009 H1N1 outbreak US, took months CDC confirm new strain flu. Reading articles Brazilian case, caught attention point Coronavac seemed reach 80% prevent infection, lot expected (in Chile we're talking 60-ish %), really seems prove people gets vaccinated efficacy vaccine increases. Great news us who've vaccinated Coronavac :) I'm conspiracy theorist. read lot science. Wait really?? realize shut north That's good many offer decent amount, still 16 states even basics sick pay. Unlikely, I've known person 18 years I'm 36. I'm surprised all. big deal, decision. lol

Holy dramatization Batman. Considering mortality rate Covid +-1%, death confirm case ratio alarming insanely silly expect mocked it. dont live U.S...good luck pandemic. mean, *would* say that, I'm glad tried regardless. care, people exist earth me. high younger people (40-20) feel lot confident elderly fully vaccinated, they're back partying, crowding shopping malls, visiting family, etc.
Even high number cases Chile, though, we're seeing people hospitalized received one dose none all, vaccine working intended (preventing severe cases, hospitalization death). bad people people, guess... It’s fact told us late. Like last year covid. fact there’s evidence originated lab pretty suspicious. April haven’t shared information caused transmission animal person. Also difficulties manufacturing distribution huge scale safely quickly extremely underrated, especially given type vaccine produced scale before. want take anything away scientists created initial mRNA code spike protein antigen, unless make hundreds millions doses get today. CNN awhile, NYT others. stories less dire recently, probably become difficult focus negative cases dropping rapidly.

If Google ""India COVID"", much news still negative nothing found declining cases. focusing variant now. sure consider barometer media, think comes Google certainly is, cable television (though older audience). chose article came googling India's COVID numbers earlier today. china ton credibility days /s arguing series straw men. Maybe inappropriate, estate attorneys must thrilled. sure xenophobic shows ignorance. hundreds new virus/variants contracted human year. mention China double population west combined. little bit search sub, already numerous new coronavirus/flu virus covered past several months. Trust us, nothing see age seniors? 65?   least first outbreaks infection among unvaccinated. Perhaps need try Maine, especially slower counties. reality meets satire. Oh weird, must missed joint statement CDC that. Like last year’s US hurricane season Honestly hit 65%-70% would still consider vaccination efforts Independence day largely successful. lot places kinda decided personally done pandemic months ago. Nebraska late 2020 saw exactly zero masks.

On completely different note, Seattle weekend saw 90% people wearing masks even outside. Vaccination bullets would definitely get crowd mobilized. Canadian here: *I* want trucks, cash, and/or guns! remember tears back April 2020 decide going see girlfriend first time 5 weeks, risk compromising parents.

It fairly new relationship time COVID, worried sustain month without physical contact, seriously love. thought getting one parents sick killing would given lifetime guilt.

Because this, I'm definitely slower wean measures. Still wear mask indoors, still try stay away bars/restaurants, etc. reference, that's called lol idea. figure one autoimmune, imagine others would follow suite. least really hope so. wont could sworn read piece shit dying years ago. Maybe pleasant dream? Delaying would meant potentially millions second doses proven offer double amount protection single doses. government travel system absolutely awful still sorted track trace.

What say response crisis areas like Bolton appeared fairly adept. That's West Virginia. western part Virginia.   Would vaccines help type arthritis? too, wrist, foot (toes ankle). . Best donut ever.

Only thing better fresh donut fresh donut... free. makes much sense it'll never happen! Yeah live NJ/NYC went seeing 99% people wearing masks doors 75/80. Outside even lower, third people see wear masks outdoors city. imagine far demand location people WFH 100% time post-COVID, almost certainly case. Oh, yay, never.. mean consider whole part Derg bureaucrat good idea. since vaccine injuries, barely pay money. Thank comment injecting lot realism discussion. HIV rivals cancer difficulty undertaking. quite likely require personalised medicine incredibly difficult distribute lower income nations expensive income nations.

Anyways, another thing optimistic mRNA vaccines may help provide platform create vaccines parasites malaria, though Novavax's Matrix-M platform appears promising rid planet parasites. zero. take level risk accommodate choose take vaccine?  condolences simple fact give prizes Americans convince get vaccine says much USA. Mostly it’s country stupidest people fucking planet!!  know many great smart Americans fucks sakes morons make everyone looks like bunch idiots. 

So many people world can’t get vaccine since us majority available doses can’t convince population take getting prize it.  

 Entitled idiots!!! Accept feel anxious. Know nothing fight against. fight it, reinforce it. Know anxiety, uncomfortable feels (uncomfortable understatement), hurt you. 


Instead, feel anxiety building, signal brain got purposely relaxing muscles going anyway. breathe different. talk down. Let anxiety there....and relax muscles. know progressive muscle relaxation, helpful here. 


The fix anxiety, time, facing makes us anxious surrendering relaxing muscles. seems counterintuitive feel like profound danger. Anxiety supposed serve purpose really danger, not, face relax. time resolve. unvaccinated persons allowed long term care facilities.
 
Problem solved. Thanks updates, look every day. forgot holiday yesterday thought retired sub. Lucky us you’re still providing updates. give covax. want use political tool use like stop pretending. Younger mountains Dude, think agree lessons learned pandemic bring us post-COVID world. 

But please cut ""What's great normal?"" ""normal good enough"" rhetoric. people say ""back normal"", they're obviously talking going back things love able see friends family around people without fear without distance. idea Chinas vaccination rate feel get contained. hard lockdown place. end? always Covid circulating people refusing get vaccinated. respect people upfront say think warrants mask forever, lot people stance insist it’s couple month longer proposition can’t pinpoint think going different couple months explained pretty well. despised masks start never stopped hating them. wore helped stop spread required, soon became safe stop wearing stopped.

That's general feeling it.

If mention anywhere else, get called Republican antivax science denier ever insult book god forbid someone like wearing masks. I've hearing masks constantly. things put place like perspex barriers, gloves, rules around ordering, etc. know safety theatre, noticed removed well? Half supply? UK factories produce around 2m week... bought life insurance March last year. Never even thought before. easy extra bill every month, I'm truck driver. Staying home option really. vaccinated protected going be.

TBF OP wear N95 better mask, good fit, cloth it, they're worried, combination vaccine. Nope. 100% pro mask, wearing one weeks mandates, get really irritated anti maskers, still HATE MASKS. That's going really good movie one day Magic someone rheumatoid arthritis (autoimmune) please please please let real things. FYI, Canada supplied US plant. Wait, know song... even look interviewed? lol Fucking amazing achievement, Yooks. work? look chile Yup, totally hear - I'm Toronto, trying buy plastic crates upcoming move, I'm pretty sure that's illegal LOL Erm... no? play basketball?

I’m 12 days first dose I’m playing 2 guys one fully vaccinated another got first shot yesterday. It’s outside family members first shot. real concern grandmother underlying health conditions first shot. 

I thinking able outside reduces chances 95% whatever + 40% average chance reduction getting friends + 70% chance reduction first dose first dose + 70% chance reduction passing family member + 70% chance reduction passing Grandma makes sense? 

Can peoples thoughts love grandma much she’s last grandparent won’t go unless sure it’ll safe. average person, meaningful defining characteristics variants places origin. Even memorize new names, nearly impossible think ""ok delta variant, that's Indian one..."" I'm going like ""oh delta variant, yes that's one three spike protein mutations"" whatever.

I’d you’re vaccinated don’t worry Portugal smaller population entire country one city UK, London. Could anyone answer question please? capacity 2021? Sheeeeeesh (it's Fox News thing) 😉🤷🏼‍♂️  consider cruise enthusiast. I've 18 past 10 years. Last one November 2019. There's absolutely way I'll set foor one ever without vaccine requirement.

Even pre Covid gamble. careful possible. entirely different threat that's difficult contain.

And honest, I'm still sure I'd go anytime soon even requirement. many pieces shit flat lie anyway. often type still think hoax engaged high risk behavior. countries set boundaries. worried. one case. it’s possible bird flu could cause pandemic future, genetically changed ways would need to. 

Each individual virus “species” low chance developing beneficial (for virus) mutations way COVID did. It’s unlikely particular one hit jackpot particular moment time. area, cultural tone pretty clearly pro-masking small businesses requiring masks. big companies make national policies ones mandating masks (which making lot people mad here). very, sad. Maybe demographic fellow cruises nothing Carnival party cruises truly wonder demographic polled. Carnival cruisers honey badgers cruise industry. sense would give damn someone else vaccinated not. vaccine less effective people compromised immune systems people taking immunosuppressant medications, official guidance people continue wearing masks regardless vaccinated. folks taking extra precautions eliminate even small risk breakthrough infections order protect vulnerable household members. might think risk high enough warrant yourself, people lower tolerance risk that's business. think real way get population vaccinated would exempt kids learn Critical Race Theory school parents get vaccinated. im happy. Wow, we're still whole censorship thing debacle? ...sad. well kinda deserve going cruise first place reddit's hate boner cruises continues. cruise went one fun things ever did, really ""petri dishes"" everybody makes be. That's every day, per month. even 7/1000 still 1/1000 vaccinated. 20% bringing Norovirus..... vaccine certificate fine; long issued authority issuing vaccine; including yellow book. yes, green certificate scheme gets adopted, it'll make much easier.

Considering Spain lifted quarantine requirements UK travelers, imagine clarity come soon. Articles like aggravate vaccine hesistancy even among at-risk people. Many cruise lines significantly downsized, there's entire roster ships scrapped, couple years old major operators. 

I doubt nutjob antivaxxers going able afford cruising decade cruise lines build capacity back again. even take account price oil, biggest cost, shooting globally, general supply chain issues goods. man makes labs? ...duh. think research labs spring nature? problem mostly older people people pre existing conditions vaccinated europe. demographic younger people starts right now.  Hard imagine 20 percent want see another cruise ship outbreak. Sounds like normal working day us Europeans

I joke somewhat, although many people still small beer lunch eating office get job spite that, got job that. China African Union, backed candidacy, want someone willing run cover ups. also named Robert Mugabe ""WHO goodwill ambassador"" really tells need know him. I'm assuming mean US? EU, going young folk get vaccine. would REAL annoying closed flying EU states (could seen international) despite falling COVID rates. whole outbreak far (that known of) graphed locations fancy deep dive, interesting see spread plays detail  Spanish Flu 1918 went away without vaccine. /s  “The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said last week heart inflammation following vaccination Comirnaty cause concern continued happen rate typically affected general population. added time young men particularly prone condition.” Yes teenagers definitely don’t already want. /s Orthodox Jews, fastest growing demographic Israel. WHOLE pandemic man made scientists messing viruses been. depresses people believe science experts never wrong. Small businesses really get huge backlash though. Big businesses deal media public blowback.

And also small businesses struggling way big businesses. Lifting mask requirements would lot alleviate that. Dang ! rooting hard Uncle Joe say speech. Would dope ! I've fair amount cruises life, TBH, covid even close worst bug going find ship LMAOOOO 
 real though, I'd far worried norovirus E. coli vaccinated, let go worrying people. Wear mask still hesitant, I've stopped worrying selfishness folks. liberating. I've thought cruise occasions always put health risk, due viruses, seen enough negative publicity, problems cruises earlier COVID pandemic.

So would entertain going cruise without strict COVID vaccination requirement, stricter hygiene pre COVID due aforementioned viruses. Cuomo Crush

aged like MILK That's can't let go wrong start thing. man made aspect specific virus man made, although man may hand enhancing natural virus, whole pandemic started spread man. man messing viruses first place none would started. can't let go expert opinions ""believe science"" even one second admit wrong science wrong too. holiday weekend effect. yes, doses slowed. 

For worth, misleading - ""bubble"" second doses buoying numbers back many first doses given. past couple weeks, first doses dropped less second doses (although first doses dropping obviously). believe called invisible hand free market guns..guns..guns?! makes absolutely sense all.

Why call “encruiseiasts?” It’s right there! That's true. cannot get ready before, harder measure exactly compared symptomatic serious cases.   longer case. Pfizer moving millions north South America Moderna starting soon. Makes sense cause logistics. cases, half people previous medical conditions.

Also important It’s got vaccinated . fucking cares someone gets isn’t vaccinated. you’re ready get outside, around people, still think corona Ebola people worried risk sitting inside couch ones getting cruise ship. enough people vaccinated United States right prevent big fall/winter surge year? would potential surge look like? 

Pockets breaks unvaxxed communities - see measles outbreaks years back Would mostly people vaccinated catching going ICU? 

Unvaxxed people catching - might end ICU, 65+ population really amazing vaccination numbers wouldnt see anything like ICUs getting Or, enough unvaccinated people it, could start spilling vaccinated people too?

From vaccine data Israel saying 1 3000 30 per 100k however stood me: rate myocarditis following vaccination among young men higher. Ninety percent cases picked Israel appeared men, although myocarditis normally common among young men, rate among vaccinated somewhere five 25 times background rate, report says.""


5-25x background rate big variation really vague without specific numbers. background rate they're actually assuming?

The implied Covid-induced myocarditis rate 300 per 100k. I'm curious many Myocarditis cases actually observed (in hospital, clinic) study/follow-up like done. young men getting hearts followed around. Complete BS. believe claims hear mainstream media, relationship reality. virus becoming measles like. human behavior drives transmission one looks that! must admit I'm little confused myself. Nurses focus practical application theory. Trust me, you’d want covid vaccine kind cruises Live south. Bet it’s much higher here. I’d bet 80%. I've said along, proves lockdowns worth it. Every person required sacrifice year life draconian restrictions, average, people lost far less disease itself. Would happen know COVID-19 able sexually transmitted semen vaginal fluids? Last year saw study indicated COVID virus cells present human semen. studies done shortly vaccination antibody levels high. year serum mucosal antibody levels low prevent infection. However memory response kick 2-3 days prevent extensive replication, shedding, disease. kids vaccinated?

Take take them. Kids pretty low risk covid even without vaccine. that's still much risk kids, keep home. wear masks. park made policy clear, one forced go like it. come from? Aren’t nurses trained viral/germ/pathogen spread? That’s basically we’re restrictions wind vaccine bringing mortality acceptable level.  2020 every patient isolate differed 10 base changes. November changed virus infected many people selection pressure imposed antibody immunity. surprising. solution vaccination, enough vaccine go around. Vaccination reduce infection reduce mutation. Variants outpace vaccination cell epitopes, contrast B cell epitopes, change variants. clarify, Tamiflu effective take within 2 days symptom onset, within 2 days catching virus. Though influenza fairly short incubation period 1-4 days, still means effective 3-6 days catching virus.

Good know. I've heard Germany many people got Pfizer first AstraZeneca shot, think permitted Hungary mRNA though? 

Yes.

I'm sure like, ""weakened immune systems old"" vs ""immunocompromised"" (I'm claiming expert sure effectively difference!) least later know people still tested positive antibodies two entire courses (so 4 shots lol) Moderna Yeah. misunderstand stuff hear doctors comparing flu: perspective healthcare system, flu borderline apocalyptically bad, killing vast numbers people pushing limits capacity regular basis. doctors say ""this could X% worse flu"", downplaying it: they're saying ""this really fucking bad"", people misunderstanding them. know people appear infected. suspect combination many factors. First, infected people transmit infection - 80% infections transmitted 20% infected people. could also innate immunity suggest. issue worked simple solve take time. many virus infections answers either. got flu times teens 20s flu shot came out. it, get shot every year without question. used avoid getting flu shot. Always seemed get flu later seasons. Didn’t see point. Got year. Also got covid vaccine fast could though. Don’t want get covid give family keep spreading. every time China makes threatening moves towards Taiwan, USA always seems send large Naval contingent area protect land, yet citizens need defending, MIC shows people matter... passports apply flights, land borders still open presumably would cover people travel work.

Anyone takes flights work would presumably get paid workplace Much respect neighbors north! think America settle around 60% population 70% adults said done. shabby, bit jealous UK's Canada's acceptance rate. sustainable way travel anyone.. trippling population village hours wrecking place moving ridiculious behaviour. There’s flu mist people don’t like needles: it’s nasal spray live weakened virus. People normal immune systems react like flu shot (which dead virus virus parts), weakened immune system don’t get flu mist. deem everyone public health risk everyone offered vaccine. Don’t exclude given choice take not. Makes sense. noticed Japan barely ensure adequate supply vaccines home

But adequate supply home. EU signed exports 100 million doses Japan.

The vaccination drive Japan simply huge failure lots doses sitting shelves instead administering them. giving doses Taiwan actually great idea EU citizen, I'd support allowing exports Japan ASAP need sending Taiwan. everyone acting like absolutely negative side effects vaccines years road? crazy believe within realm possibility? Oh come back sure, else people going enjoy exact things land??? Absolutely ludicrous, want go shopping go pool (even though im middle ocean)!! People go cruise-ships dumbest people earth. convinced variant 'infectious'. data prove simply there. written before, variants 'fit'. reproduce better human population hence displace ancestral viruses. happens time influenza viruses never call viruses infectious. variant narrative opinion control people make statements check literature!

Antibodies induced vaccines less effective variants variants changes spike protein antibodies bind. vaccines still protect agains moderate severe disease. want! cell epitopes changed variants.

I concerned variants outstrip vaccines. People need get vaccinated knock virus circulation therefore evolution.

Many infections vaccinated people (e.g. NY Yankees) associated mild disease. Vaccines general prevent infection, prevent disease, seeing. people would actually change opinion. Many people scared ""emergency authorization"" label Eh, vaccines vaccines. Taiwan something like 0.7% vaccination rate, although data may outdated. need everything get, whether comes Japan China Uruguay Equatorial Guinea (although I'd argue Equatorial Guinea needs more)

Sure, may hypocritical Taiwan gets vaccines without taking someone needs more, China gets feel good win-win parties? Well I've exhaustion next day (I could've slept entire day) nothing more. I've got first shot May 7th next July 18th. read yesterday average flu season, 200 children USA die flu. theoretically possible suggest seasonal viruses also contribute “long” ilneses like Covid ? could implications relation medical conditions remember said it, teacher, older relative something, little (1970s) someone told throwing up, cold flu. believed longest!

Damn shame access good, solid info still land make believe people Pfizer protease inhibitor treatment clinical trials currently. category anti-viral treatment molecule introduced body able bind protein surface virus, virus needs survival. either inactivates virus 

Typically difficult problem solve, especially terms finding safe molecule binds well virus. Folding@Home project published lot data (open source, potentially used Pfizer) regarding protein modeling SARS-CoV-2 effort solve problem. Separate Pfizer efforts, companies also working Folding@Home team develop release open source protease inhibitor, anyone could manufacture sell super cheap. currently believe they've found candidate molecule would work SARS-CoV-2, known coronaviruses. do, honestly it’s mental. friend who’s kind hypochondriac “got seasick” absolutely calm weather. Go see doctor (if already). I've tinnitus episodes common colds, passed one week. Stuffy nose infecting ear. happen you? Hmmm...according studies Ive read (Israel, CDC healthcare workers, etc...)- mRNA vaccines highly effective preventing asymptomatic infections, Im bit confused say infections prevented. misreading something? Well, runny noses covid symptom. guess do, encourage bit saying America moment Hungary lot people panicking possible blood clots thing we're hearing countries stopped usage AZ sent 3rd world countries.

I've noticed Japan barely ensure adequate supply vaccines home. circumstances, Japanese government's announcement considering providing vaccines China's Taiwan region drawn doubts media public including Taiwan. would like stress vaccine assistance restored origin purpose, save lives, reduced tool selfish political gains.

Yes, it’s truly amazing fast Canadians vaccinating. first doses already top ten world.  First, put ""experts"" scare quotes. they're really experts, you?

Second, dismiss ineffective. dismiss people dedicate lives public health tend squeamish unnecessary suffering deaths. path natural immunity leads unnecessary suffering death medical debt. get 2nd AZ shot mix match Moderna Pfizer 2nd. Get whatever available you. accurate, damn frustrating. gesture.  UK data based blocking infection antibody. I've said before, cell epitopes change variants, cells prevent disease. still confident current vaccines work, shown work delta variant. work 6 days week. ""they""? Damn, comment pincer maneuver. flu first time two years ago never want again. thought dying. would sacrifice 2 days pay order get flu vaccine usually 40% effective.

Couldn't get flu vaccine Friday afternoon? SARS-CoV-1 infections 2004 lab associated. However biosecurity implemented serious manner. far know new pathogen ever released lab. requirements working BSL3/4 labs serious incident goes unnoticed, even computer crash reported. know system well worried lab leaks. mRNA though? 

I read somewhere even bad night sleep (&lt; 6 hours) getting flu shot reduces chances immune system making response vaccine much 50%. think it’s Sleep Matthew Walker. 

Not sure it’s vaccines different vector. That's thought. It’s 100% safe. 99.9996% safe. looks even safer second shot. lot safer getting COVID.

Would mRNA affective hepatitis? really, seeing hardest hits states US thinly populated. pharmaceutical companies sure vaccine safe, agree release distribute vaccine condition provided legal immunity event vaccinated people suffer adverse health effects death result getting jabbed? don’t stand behind promised safety product project confidence vaccine hesitant stripping immunity?

Some people don’t want jab heard people get sick shortly injection stay home work. can’t afford take time work, decide can’t afford get vaccinated. pharma companies multi billion dollar corporations financial backing government.  don’t offer cover two days paid sick leave workers can’t afford get sick jab?

Why don’t offer support dependents people may suffer incapacitating health effects taking vaccine, offer fully cover medical bills anyone treat potential illness taking jab? offer life insurance-like payouts long term financial support survivors anyone might die taking vaccine? removing liability protections themselves, corporations lower rate vaccine hesitancy?

Why unwilling incur slightest bit corporate accountability vaccine deem safe even increase vaccination uptake, instead push accountability onto people can’t independently afford take risks, chide us unwilling unable bear burden consequences refuse bear themselves? people told blood hands looking protection, pharma companies granted legal privilege washing hands clean protection?

Again, tell Jane take vaccine dies it, would willing go prison life put death row 1-1 trade taking someone else life? you’re confident Jane won’t die vaccine extent willing put life line service convictions, wouldn’t put life line Jane well? unwilling risk life Jane, demand same? miniscule risk can’t even relate thinking one adapt lifestyle account it. vaccines work, existing known variants. ‘fiscal conservatives’ longer exist Conservative party though. put calling maintenance apartment whole year (non emergency maintenance) nervous anyone house ever 10 minutes

Free stays state parks fishing licenses fit right state ethos well. you’re vaxxed, go bar?  die get vaccinated. get vaccinated, they're adults making unfortunate choices  Fair enough long everyone immune vaccine naturally.

One thing measles vaccine favorite almost everyone needs one life, two bumps bit. vaccinate little kids school admission never think again. Plus, catch natural infection. 

We know yet long covid immunity lasts natural vaccine. Indications lasts year, thankfully. 

Covid also live animal reservoirs measles can't. trade policies screw workers?  “100%” “may” don’t really go together. Generally bad idea test failsafes i.e., create situations constantly relying solely one line protection (vaccine immunity high spread environment).

Some people want patient zero COVID-variant Omega breaks through. really think one else going problem? US able vaccinate faster places we're incentive phase. countries get point eventually, different times. Even Hong Kong starting give incentives get vaccinated. Completely overlooking progress made writing us stupid entitled insulting. measles kill 3-6% developed countries, worse developing workplace finally lifting mask mandate vaccinated employees, I’m hyped Exactly. data shows vaccines effective preventing transmission. feel cdc came guideline way unvaccinated Americans spread covid amongst gain natural immunity partner similar struggles lesser degree. don’t think it’s necessarily fear COVID that’s stressing anymore like... distrust people general. 


The frustrating thing past year minus loved ones lost absolute disregard others seemed have. really able see people community even TRY care loved one’s well-being. got see selfishness stubbornness full force. people like freaking global pandemic, trust shitty people regular? 


That’s stresses most. can’t trust people community back. states low vaccine rates also high infection rates.

We summer flu seasons. would surprised surge meaningfully ordinary respiratory disease season. outbreak entire ship would likely quarantined weeks. would affect you. Jesus christ post history complete shit stain. Yes. near Munich. appreciated family’s high level caution past year also concerned trying best catch spread disease. we’re fully vaccinated they’re still scared, don’t go anywhere maskless, won’t go “crowded” (like 3 people) indoor area, worried another major surge fall. honestly don’t understand it. got fully vaccinated 3 weeks later friends flying stay they’d Vegas. I’m concerned anymore, don’t know hell would you’re vaccinated. Every day get information insanely effective are. mean cell phone finally good speeds? got first shot, told people check insurance card me, said, ""not worth time, go"". line long behind time type card info out. next likely application mRNA could approved near future? I'd say 69% chance picked medicine someone Walgreens last week. dropped off, asked ever got vaccinated. said afford next check. told free, believe me, call Walgreens at, mile road, ask them. giving shots right behind line pharmacy counter. 

She called, said preferred make appointment, since end day, could come right then, need insurance card anything, free. 

She got vaccinated weekend. say thing show license? Passport? vaccine requirement cruise ship get you? avoid risk quarantined offshore? hell cruise enthusiast? Like think cruise ships lovely curves crisp lines physics buoyancy gravity super cool! feel cruises horrible environment terrible working conditions would never support industry. would talk past point interest party setting. make cruise enthusiast? I’ve never cruise, like boats. indeed. know we're reddit, therefore america bad, reason [japan, SK, france many others stuff right fast Right -- hypothesis chances *transmission* unvaccinated person would even lower asymptomatic vaccinated person would far less virus transmit? thought actively conducting contact tracing testing determine study can't find link now. Deliveries vaccine sporadic progress slow. Vaccine delivery general public scheduled ramp July scheduled completed end year. Thank god police info can’t possibly discern true false ourselves.  Call naive, pretty confident we’d scientific way beginning, knew that. every developed nation throwing literally money world one problem, would’ve surprised *couldnt* solve pretty quickly. 

So got lucky mRNA think would’ve found something regardless. Maybe something less effective, expensive, slower, whatever. *something* end it. lot people countries able get vaccines elders... let alone adults. 
Things got close require martial law times... 
I understand people like choose even wrong probably shouldn’t apply case. last two comments truth I’ve seen sub year combined. Looking forward state getting point, whenever may be. husband went cruise road trip anniversary spent entire first night cruise vomiting. Found pregnant next day. 🙃  Well, Colorado, close 100% mask wearing cities. past two weeks, we’ve gone perhaps 20% (based I’ve seen personally). still know folks afraid variants etc., social circle back pre-pandemic lives. It’s actually way faster change anticipated. Wow. really slowed down. difficult task convince get vaccine yet get one. Covid completely wiped off. banned carbon neutral clean. banned anyway arguable honest. test twice much today then, even though testing declined immensely past months, get test whenever nearly wherever want. extremely hard get tested back then. Nah unvaccinated people spread immunocompromised people. unnecessarily long way saying support anti vaxxers killing people. 

If you’re sure link peer reviewed scientific studies feel like know experts. 

But won’t hold breath that. 

Don’t waste time another long comment. There’s defense anti vaxxers. use racism us seems. majority peoples consensus entirely due vaccinations

Yes, that's point I'm attempting make: COVID destined become new endemic disease. society we're choosing let make people contagiousness

Measles bonkers-ly infectious. 4x contagious COVID. control Measles 90% effective vaccine, control COVID vaccine equally better measles vaccine, matter getting enough peoples arm carrot stick measures. problem. point I’m assuming nobody really seeing I’m glad somebody getting something it. I’m gonna keep either way fulfill curiousity I’ll keep posting probably least another month two. Hopefully not. We’re still stuck bullshit security theater September 11th. Let’s loss privacy creep. LOL plan Gallaher TWiV. whether intermediate host not, could go either way. could imagine infected animal(s) brought live market Wuhan starting outbreak. family Northeast Kingdom, seems stuff available there! Would donating spare supplies later? Europe! We’ll also keep wearing masks. similar facile notion action truly altruistic, behaving supposedly altruistic way makes feel good yourself, spares feelings guilt might experience didn't, could improve social standing...

The agenda might mutually beneficial ""this help preserve strengthen relationship strategic ally"". There's reason cynical it. Yes, happens people infected viruses cause long term infections, like HIV HCV. viruses transmit others reasons stated above. Oh can't wait one! projects malicious intent without evidence *so much* piece. guess reason carry driving license drive. Usually it’s controlled, it’s something need have.  Nice!  limited control what's point pass?   video planned explain GOF. Also one debunk Nicholas Wade article point point.  lol, reason US help people balls? I'm actually quite curious hypothesis means, true. Maybe intermediate host all? Anyway, maybe bring future TWiV? Thanks Youtube channel, become favorite household. Even cat likes watch. Sorry that! son keyboard addict told correct reply. I'm also fellow Canadian, add info. political parties board vaccinations Conservatives would throwing next election away anti-vaccines. actually critical vaccine delivery slow. *Back line* crap that.

It's clear vaccines way return normalcy fringe groups visibility social media, messaging across political parties news media GO GET JABBED.

For hesitant pockets, I'm hopeful vaccine available family doctors administer, personal approach convince people get it. Especially lazy it. kind disease? Mild, moderate, severe? matters.  elected declare difference terms ""airborne"", ""aerosol"", associated terms, would difference? much doubt that. Outdoor spread probably driven lot people close proximity. Indoors, yes, spread small droplets (aerosols) typically infected people area extended period time. misspoke edit comment Thank you! Good know may still reduce transmission even antibodies wane. that's likely untrue. economist's excess death model shows roughly eighth percent global population died due covid, that's *with* lockdowns. that's also last month; numbers continue rise. moreover, counterfactual propose, hospital systems would likely overwhelmed, predictable effects, especially rural areas poorer jurisdictions. 

it's pandemic. adverse effects. mean nothing would better. kinda love thinking hahah. I'm even talking staff. mean no-one. residents, plumbers, employees, family, visitors.
 
And I'm highly mandatory vaccinations, one place exception makes sense. Anyone unwilling get vaccinated need LTC facility. Period. question spike protein lasting body - mean mRNA vaccination? days most, mRNA vaccine. user snarky asshat That’s weird also hear people talk flu like mainly stomach bug. vomiting happen it’s far main symptom lung infection like influenza. Whatever. genius yay  literally listened couple idiots work talk vaccine killing people saving government trying cover up. talk it, cringe inside remember dumb people are. think question good one. answer, depends live. states worse others. Maybe 10% overall US? I'm sure want ignorant, think lot behavior politically motivated. people understand extent science improves lives. tell them, accuse industry shill. one reason started TWiV podcasts years ago continue increase science communication efforts. However sometimes fell make little impact people listening me, not. think get low hanging fruit, people really want learn science.  link video?
Thanks CCP shit point. Japan needs vaccines covid19 wave absurdly low vaccination rollout Thank you! invited r/virology. nice group virologists would love AMA sometime. don’t think bad. fun certainly bad environment exploit workers badly. long spike proteins stay body? long MRNA stay body? Isn’t possible strain could vulnerable aerosol transmission - that’s they’re seeing outdoor spread, infections someone entering room infectious person standing 2 hours prior? No, wasn't, regards ""society"" whole referring referred clickbait title.  500,000 dead would many let virus rip everyone? many hospitalized? Hospital collapse? many people need treatment things would die result? many parents would decide keep kids isolated anyways, regardless shutdowns? issued new variant nomenclature based Greek letters, google find it. gets away country references looks better.

Madness. Yeah makes sense. guess sustain economic growth health people there’s major rush. interesting. 30 year old; what’s meaning term “risk group”? I’m technically within risk group despite lowest risk three groups? think people understand UK's SAGE several experts seeing third wave likely starting UK due recent variant interest, Delta (B.1.617.2 sub-variant India). believed much contagious even B.1.1.7 (UK) strain enough immune escape partially vaccinated folks well protected, especially gotten AstraZeneca vaccine concerned single dose J&amp;J perform.

Thank work, time. inquisitive questions realist, meant cynical/rude/negative. fully vaccinated feel relieved! high antibody titer last, year low. However memory cells protect disease.  Cases already dropping 50% per week stockholm relatively restrictions. don’t need discriminate young people keep infection rates down. need open vaccination everyone everyone get vaccinated start discriminating unvaccinated people.  anyone got idea need self-isolate transiting France UK car, obviously PCR test done it’s essential travel. Enthusiasts Japan's Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu said last Friday government considering providing extra supply coronavirus vaccines countries regions, including Taiwan.

How move political tool? Honestly I’m vaccinated idc people don’t want do. vaccine works intended I’m super low risk catch super low risk getting mild-sever case. would think it’s even lower considering I’m 27 mild case covid back January. 
I’m trusting science one vaccine protects me. Imagine fucking hearing nurses techs.

Like whhhhhoooo heard could cause infertility maybe could use medical education research start spouting nonsense other. stay lane since clearly know nothing vaccines vaccine development.  restrictions subject area?  I’d also prefer cruise ships didn’t burn bunker oil pollute everything. ngl awesome prizes strengthen point, think passed 2 billion COVID vaccine jabs pass weekend. Millions upon millions understatement.

I wonder many people received chicken pox vaccine, greater 1 billion. people ""wait see"" camp that? cruise without one hoping right thing. Completely anecdotally, people know really rural parts generally stay close home go town (usually Walmart whatever) travel hour two without blinking eye. What? You’re leaving microscopic pieces rubber behind, mention causing global warming releasing farts. existing human enough cause damage planet.

Fucking selfish asshole.

59.26% whole UK population (incl. 18s) least one dose 
39.03% whole UK population fully vaccinated

Really far Israeli levels. reckon we'll peak 90% adults fully vaxxed.  Probably not, vaccination herd immunity will. Technically EU didn’t block export vaccines towards UK. end April, 500 export requests, EU denied one: 250k doses towards Australia. 

Now, I’m saying export control didn’t change strategy AZ that’s doing. EU exported since export control place millions doses towards uk, yes possible since policy place, AstraZeneca exporting less EU production towards uk.

But, like, honest, large portion vacations destructive environment. Cruise ships uniquely damaging regard.

Air travel, imagine majority people upvoting comment engage in, right ballpark cruising.

A [one way international make almost entire carbon emissions [of average person's labor situation cruise ships definitely worse many common vacations, environmental perspective, cruise ships really far away everything else destructive flying is.


I think there's lot people want green, also hold international travel best vacation, look nose domestic road trip lesser vacation. say death rate .1%. point 500k people died US, .1% population. say counted.

You point study looks excess deaths says actual US deaths probably closer 900k. 

They say believe can't live fear let cruise old people. worried get vaccinated. 

20% believable, maybe even low. cruises last 20 years. liken trip parents 6 adult rules. don’t plan anything(as long picked things beforehand) someone hold hand. drink eat whenever want. room cleaned every day go pool, play games, watch show gamble. keep people entertained.

Also, wear one eating drinking, get brief break order snacks drinks. well aware Comirnaty developed Biontech (&amp; Pfizer)

I still prefer call Pfizer thats people refer to.

Most people call Vaxzevria vaccine Aztrazeneca even though developed Oxford

Most people call J&amp;J vaccine J&amp;J even though developed Jansen (belgium subsidiary)

Does really matter? one talking b NHS ❤️  vaccine mixing barley tested too. Honestly parents told feel like guinea pigs.

Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden Canada mixing vaccines.  worth noting many countries already mixing vaccines. Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden. Germany, France, Canada 3 G7, I'm expecting opposition this. 

It mentions here: Yeah know, shared figures another comment. Anyway think demand blocked July. far Spain finish 50-59 group uptake age groups around 95%+ far This. Partly implied/implies next month, also right - lag detecting infections, detecting 20,000 cases suggests number people infected today quite bit higher, detecting 20,000 R&lt;1 suggests number infected today relatively lower, even assuming identical testing rates. fully immune. point getting vaccinated. would wouldn’t get second dose? want fully immune? anti vaxxers complain ?  right. like lower efficacy vaccine going somehow attractive people refusing high efficacy vaccines already available US. (Now places like India shortage would probably better take vaccine hold one higher efficacy that's whole different scenario) LOL. freaking one truth. None whataboutisms changes truth.  I'm enrolled study they'll mix matching. blinded know vaccine I'm getting either round whether they're same. assured I'll still get vaccination passport second dose regardless vaccines study recognised country. Germany everybody calls vaccine „BioNTech vaccine“. 

What small world.

Also fun fact: turkish immigrants call vaccine „turkish vaccine“ (mostly joke ofc). Covid affects old fat people, amiright? Quite countries already mixing vaccines - Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden - Canada alone. Germany, France, Spain 3/4 largest countries EU combined population nearly 200 million. 

What I'm trying say countries, much larger ones political sway, boat. world accommodate. EU rolling vaccine passport right now. can't find clarification whether allows mixed vaccines, we'll find soon. 

FYI - good document said countries mixing vaccines: August conservative policial estimate. Delivery plans say otherwise.

""Bis Mitte Juli laut BMG 90 Prozent der Impfwilligen gegen Corona..."" Awesome - thanks! seems way approach logic view world like do.

June 15th - 168.3m - 65.2%

July 4th - 179.7 - 68.5%

70% 7/13 mutations concern, hundreds millions cases worldwide, handful variants concern arising, none seriously escaping vaccine immunity date. couple thousand daily cases UK extremely unlikely difference dangerous new strain not. Woah partner. stated one accurate fact: number Covid infections per day last higher week 2020.

Take chill pill. Wheres raw data at? short absolutely terrifies me. see world function longer masks distancing especially poor populations need pay rent. Many people know struggled immensely isolation. get vaccinated folks! referring emails last year March/April 2020 think good idea Someone give Matt Hancock OBE. Oh he's getting two? Nice. would wonderful, hope zealously pursued expense many India's health issues. (For example, [tuberculosis causes 200,000 deaths per year New York Post

Yeah... that's really good barometer ""the media"" saying.  long think “wear mask you’re unvaccinated” signs front stores stay up? technically could keep specific signs indefinitely  Hospitals May 2020 vs Hospitals May 2021 tell much different story. Hopefully one guns they're giving out! “COVID cesspool”

Ouch. hurts it’s true. context decision: Around half US population vaccinated, fully solid fraction 1 dose (which still quite strong protection, strong). let's make assumption average vaccinated people 90% protected - bit less 95% full dose protection level account partially vaccinated people. half population bucket, expect see 10 times many unvaccinated cases vaccinated, 1/11 total cases among vaccinated people.

At 20,000 cases per day, 1800 vaccinated cases per day, ~634,000 vaccinated cases year, case levels stay now. half 332 million people unvaccinated population, amounts annualized risk 0.4% (1 250) case covid. 10,000 cases, annualized risk 0.2% (1 500).

Of late, result mass vaccination, lagged case fatality rate fallen around 1%. vaccinated group, that's annualized risk 0.004% (1 25,000) dying covid, falling 0.002% cases fall 10,000 per day. risk applied entire US population (not vaccinated), would mean ~13,000 deaths current case rates (less flu), falling 6500 deaths cases cut half. And, 55 diabetes compromised immune system, risk substantially lower this. know positivity rate drastically higher May 2020 compared May 2021 right. could also look hospitalizations deaths far lower May 2020. 

At least research instead concluding infection rate May 2020 lower, clearly case. never left WV Society seem come together improved due covid. sad. would nice mRNA becomes face tracked life saving treatment. Still enough people pushing back though, amplified press internet.

I laminated ""STOP 5G RADIATION POISONING"" flyer liberated years ago London. people listening crazy shit, time actually serious. 

As actions consequences, rather everyone else looking 5G conspiracy nuts chuckling.

Whoever ring leading people (Russia imo) exceptional job sad.

I could sit day trying convince people twitter reddit never anything, never come say ""oh hey actually looked turns im fucking MORON"".

That would make day good would need 70-90 % population stop spread.

Which probably already due people antibodies prior infections + 50% fully vaccinated + however many one dose counted full vaxx yet may well be. people confusing - whether intentionally create ""OMG WANT GO BACK OFFICE"" narrative unintentionally - COVID times non-COVID times.

Non-COVID times, kids fully back school worries that. feel like CEO Biontech going wake horse’s head bed people Panadol goes ahead.  Old normal  Vermont would well Canada. parents die could go local bar without mask. needed Pats boys.

/s Agreed hell news networks like Cnn sky fox plus get net based garbage like vox breitbart can't mix covid patients patients ICU room. yes, they're running ICU beds accept covid patients. tested usual standards looks like 70% target July 4th might missed ?  British culture balance personal responsibility community spirit. recent decades former driven latter covid shifted balance back little. Well know cruise ship companies private businesses legally require passengers vaccine prove vaccinated boarding ship want least think States know cruise companies actually going avoid Florida ordinance tried put place banning people asking clients prove vaccinated boarding ship Depending need go, might possible already.

At least Austria, I'll driving next week, 22 days first shot considered vaccinated. good 3 months date first shot.

Sterilizing immunity polio vaccine gives. 100% protection infection. getting breakthrough infections, sterilizing immunity. risk infection transmission greatly reduced mRNA vaccines probably J&amp;J 6 weeks new challenge I'd like people wear mask they're feeling well stay home. less month national reopening, I'm already seeing boomers about, blowing noses public like nothing. Seriously getting this? EU far, far greater vaccine production capacity UK sitting surplus, fact they're still importing large chunk vaccines EU. Loads people informed still holding misconceptions. would speak authoritatively something clearly versed in?  Yes - plan keep checking. - code. vaccine noone wears masks anymore. heading head first third wave noone seems give shit insane.

The bit masks true, certainly area-specific. I'm Northumberland estimate, nearly everyone wearing masks shops (and I'd bet good money ones wearing Muppets never have) last Bradford pretty shocked see wearing supermarket. Tbh, I'd observed Bradford last summer peak hotspot too. I'm sure coincidence two areas dramatically different rates infection...

The third wave interesting point though - big question whether enough people vaccinated third wave little impact. Clearly, we're race time get rest population vaccinated big worry unprotected, younger adult population may blasé Covid, realising still bloody horrible thing get. tight timing next three months get group vaccinated (and get second doses rest population) next wave takes hold.

I'm optimistic, worried... can't wait see look face learn immune system works. Keeping mind, 80% still low. Yeah live subreddit lol ones know going thru lol think virus run paths enough hosts another uptick national numbers unless plague enthusiasts start directly spitting other's mouths. Qdeaths Qmedicaldebts reach Qpopulation immunity. stopped giving rat's ass month ago actively cheer on. Get thing done with. sacrifice appreciated Qfolks. Breakthrough cases expected. CDC updated way reported, May 1 breakthrough cases result hospitalization death counted. 

Because changed way count them, really compare older studies May new numbers. people mentioned unvaccinated staff, also mention completely possible immune systems strong enough produce immune response vaccine. immune systems obviously work well old, vaccines 100% dependent immune system making response perfect solution coronavirus, proposed Donald trump, probably. I'm guessing people usually go strip clubs haha. ask question anything: ""who right mind would go hair salon pandemic,"" etc.

Hell, come think it, strip clubs probably socially distanced - employees definitely spend 10+ minutes breathing right next head. :P point seriously question even existence entire organization benefit brings.

WHO basically shit entire time far see.  used work Big Tech, agree 100%. They'd save grand outsourcing something abroad, it'd cost lot troubleshoot mess coming new employees, hire local managers get aligned, etc. worth it. partly artifact 3 day weekend. expect see big uptick especially Florida's numbers, since report anything 3 days. even that, downward trend trending downwarder. suspect next week last week could possibly pop 20k 7 day average.   vaccinated, would matter? find solutions less reasonably effective slower. J&amp;J, AstraZenica, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik V, CureVac - run full spectrum vaccine technologies. Even that, message need masks. wearing masks long CDC approved it. Wtf It’s safer riding bicycle driving vaccination site. saying keep locking down, two tiered society certain professionals holidays specific time year somehow selfish? South Africa. 

After posted realized might obvious. stance get back fun don’t act like pandemic 100% prematurely.

Be emotionally prepared potentially re-evaluate there’s spike cases, escape variant. breakthrough covid vaccines, improvement delivery? rip I'm quoting guy told IRL, please ban me... plot Bill Gates, George Soros UN form one world government. getting vaccine doesnt stop transmitting disease, suppresses bad symptoms

Ok, free *at point service*, pedant. Anyone got idea I’ll get mine? I’m 28, turning 29 month. kinda need 18th June I’m planning travel overseas euros football tournament body temperature around 98 degrees lmao pretty sure made vaccines mind Correct. Wearing mask effective preventing getting covid close contact infected individual. however effective containing spread virus *you* infected. 

They effective preventing asymptotic spread turned bigger threat thought early on. Fauci made remarks month declared global health emergency due exponential growth cases world. also 10 days Trump made infamous ""Fifteen cases zero"" comment (which instantly ridiculed everyone knew bullshit). 

Yet, crucial early days Covid US, Fauci basically telling people throw caution wind, simultaneously downplaying effectiveness masks. He's dumb Trump. knows cases increase exponentially, explanation calculated gambit quell public demand masks.

Did pay off? Maybe. also possible honest messaging beginning, Covid spread fast people would actually taken seriously. maybe dealing low public trust science communication. I’m fan either letting kind thing creep bueno.   idea hilarious me, need population control. we're already. birth rates lowest they've 100 years, even countries outside US actually amazing maternity leave benefits. people waiting longer children, do, they're 1, maybe 2 kids . millennial gen z overall less willing previous generations children. sociologists economists predicting actually reach crisis levels 20 years.

we need population control milliennials gen z fucked financially moment graduate college, either wait past 'prime' fertility years start families kids all. older generations refuse believe that. Yeah, certianly excellent.

However, 100% suspicious number, looked bit more, source data seems states population used '2019 mid-year estimate' Scotland (which presumably recent official population estimate). Since population growing slightly, aging, likely age groups actually couple percent people them, uptake percents like 97 98%, 100%. Still amazing.

Data England similarly excellent. (slightly date ) 2019 population estimate, shows following uptake percentages last week:

&amp;#x200B;

|80+|95%|
|:-|:-|
|75-79|100%|
|70-74|97%|
|65-69|95%|
|60-64|98%|
|55-59|96%|
|50-54|90%|
|45-49|82%|
|40-44|82%|

Likely, lower age groups continue climbing bit couple weeks release, everybody would instantly gotten vaccine eligible. (for instance, compared previous week, 40-44 age group increased 5%, 45-49 2%)

So look like could trending towards 90% uptake. Incorrect, apply land borders. take from? might exceptions certain borders crossing certain countries people certain area, way taking bus Berlin Stockholm stopped.

[This shows (7 day trailing average) rate total vaccine doses given per day (scaled population) comparing Canada, UK, USA (data pulled link). point, scaled population, Canada giving vaccines twice rate US, slightly higher UK.

True. key differences: 

- Relatively [few people fully vaccinated weeks focusing first doses. takes weeks build immunity. 

- Mostly 50+ get second doses they're mostly vaccinated AZ (only 40s get Moderna/Pfizer fully vaccinated while). AZ effective MRNAs Indian variant. asking house itself? risk would extremely low. worried it, could show open windows hang outside hours airs out.

Covid spread surfaces EXTREMELY rare shouldnt consideration youd concerned accident driving/flying house.

You dont say going, assuming American - community spread across country pretty damn low. really concerned, could check spread state/county want goto using site like see many cases there. lied advocating masks obviously non-sick people, evidence support time still exist sucks consequences lead resident deaths. Apparently vaccine passports already become redundant Israel. Everyone household vaccinated safe let guard down.

I know isn’t easy hear kids 12, would probably recommend staying side caution wearing mask/social distancing. 

If need work in-person unemployed since Last Spring, working probably fine make sure it’s business that’s still precautions. I've seen called wuhan variant lot media, problem strain basically dead name come unless historical transimissibility variants  first dose pretty effective itself, taking care Canada definitely list. I've 7 cruises sick, aware outbreaks cruises I've on. less common probably think, hand sanitizer everywhere, happen, news makes sure hear it. Lol BNT162b1.  please kill awful industry already?

That’s still among lowest pandemic, it’s dipping lower. means high % people still catching dying. I’m guessing unvaccinated, real shame 500 preventable deaths day. wait children ages 0-12 get it! Gonna pump numbers bigtime lol 

Also, dont know numbers lets say close half worlds population either a) vaccines wont get forced B) dont access. We're close half world population vaccinated. wonder cases going fast!

Im willing bet dick people NEVER gotten single vaccine cancer arw many many people gotten vaccines EVER get cancer. there's leverage mandating staffing shortages. feel horrible residents places.

What instead? Stayed hell inside, followed public health guidance (I **not** want covid cluster named me), built elaborate plans ""revenge spending"" vacation start weeks. became video game addict something, anything all, pass time myself, also much help.

I'm glad life fun peachy entire world shut year affect slightest. Kudos you. enough empathy realize case everyone?.. I’ve got needle phobia too. wasn’t bad! committed getting covid. closed eyes knew coming. Didn’t hurt much done within seconds. Israel 57% fully vaccinated. UK still ways go (second doses given months first doses UK, least younger population). Vaccinated kids teachers certainly need them. cases low enough 12 need either. zero impact intervention learning read speak read social cues. Kid cases plummeted fast adult cases almost always adults giving kids covid way around younger 12. without masks. No. saying tested go bar. U.S.? Probably normality hold-out states.

Europe? even close normality &amp; probably new lockdowns announced/planned. Oh, two-tier society fresh bureaucratic hell everyone enjoy. thanks, can't see tag. definitely honest question. Maybe lean towards much caution, small kids making long, I'm screwing now. vaccinated, boomer.

Ok someone sent email saying created... who! likewise, California's restrictions laughable.

Yeah, got indoor dining, wear masks inside stores.....and that's it. Occupancy limits ignored completely. Distancing ignored 90% time. local grocery stores different pre pandemic, masks now. lucky supply Canada grow 2nd doses without affecting first dose rate. frustrating UK first doses pretty much crawled along last 2 months 2nd doses needed. Working well supply could way ahead 1st already  Prior infection one variant doesn’t necessarily mean antibodies protect new variants.

Yet lagging behind government place enough orders provide storage. brought production Oxford vaccine reach stand still.

Another factor Oxford vaccine needs viral vector needs slowly grown. mRNA vaccine could produced much quicker.

It's funny goofy ass interaction made go try again. still happen worked two magnets. 

You try hards say isn't, can't say is.  clear boosters needed. far vaccines appear prevent severe disease variants. Infection prevented, moderate severe disease. human vaccines work. think tendency extrapolate influenza virus decrease antibody neutralization titer current strains triggers reformulation vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 influenza virus. think need observe vaccinated people respond infection keep track disease severity. seems like severe disease occurring vaccinated people, might change vaccine. remember cells protect severe disease epitopes change variants. Given Canada’s higher vaccination rate, Canada’s case rate lower US’ pretty soon. turn events given Canada import vaccines Europe. Zero risk onward spread? That’s news me.

No, nurses background regarding vaccine safety/etc. analogy exactly? West Taiwan seems upset admitted vaccines way out. Every expert I've heard said need critical mass vaccinated. disagreements I've seen percentage. course safe. side effects like every medicine perfectly safe effective.  Could explain states &lt; 32% vaccination rates (of 10) going prevent another smaller wave significantly contagious variants circulating?

Why choose use fully vaccinated rate discussing potential fall/winter surge?

Shouldn't using single dose number even that's going undersell vaccinated rate come September October?

Yeah, 45% vaccinated natural immunity top higher rates across country going make basically impossible ""big surge"" (given language used above, we're talking equivalent 2020/2021's fall/winter surge, July 2020 surge). Mississippi run bodies ever hit another 2000 cases per day figure. 

People like act like southern states completely isolated infection/interaction among themselves, look influenza numbers. basically nothing even places anything. Why? communities connected.

The highly vaccinated northern states seeding cases. go vacations visit restaurants bars, they're going crowd opportunities virus spread. 

Sure, maybe could smaller wave, think ""it could get pretty ugly"" underselling even half population vaccinated combined natural immunity going reduce R. people whining cruises either actually one, unfortunately fluke bad experience/got sick.

Most people get sick cruises, food free great, sail across ocean, get beautiful views, visit beautiful places, etc, etc.

I'd say almost better described coming, going, coming back. that's experts get excited naturally acquired immunity, happens spread virus. spread gone, people move born get it, immunity fades fades formerly sick too. Eventually reintroduced region another outbreak.

Naturally acquired immunity help us beat it, puts us stasis it. Vaccination, lets us give person immunity zero risk onward spread (from vaccination itself), lets us beat least tightly control contagion.

And yes, stasis better initial pandemic, that's excellent point that's much discussed. without vaccine still pretty far that. - get - go cruises.

Probably good opportunity plug work vaccine hesitancy : 5 months might final official number, but... know guys, me, last 15 months hardly counted life. constantly catch thinking January 2020 months ago, always takes seconds go ""Oh, wait, actual year there.""

Thanks this. know anecdotes data, every old person I've spoken said want vaccine they're upset government's handling situation.

Feels like unless war related much unify days. dare help people get sick we're still lockdown. saying vaccine requirement doesn’t actually check vaccines, shifts liability, vaccines may covered. GOF word misused nearly everyone. coined decades ago refers changes bacterium, virus, fungus, organism, leads change properties. virus, could hosts infected, resistance antiviral, receptor usage - literally dozens possibilities.

We GOF research time viruses. GOF bad word. GOF research starts grant proposal nothing special terms containment needed.

GOF certain viruses problem. example, want change properties Ebola virus, SARS-like CoV, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, going change host range, antiviral resistance, need multiple levels approval. First institution, NSABB (a US committee looks research) make sure benefits outweigh risks. approved work done containment level (BSL3/4) appropriate work.

It done secret, find GOF research funded NIH. Exactly, let order Pfizer directly. Biontech political pawn tussle vaccines. Let Taiwan bypass Biontech Chinese influence get American Pfizer factories direct. little control internal borders. assume chance periodic controls certain border crossing points. got impression they’re mainly staying travel bubble longer want let developing countries get vaccinated first, since travel bubble seems working regards containing virus. Except vaccine passports Sweden limit entering malls cinemas stuff. don’t need tested every 3 days unless crossing border every three days.

Let's put number cases aside moment, people like family staying inside home 14 months now, even daily cases way less right now. That's gonna change us 70-80% population fully vaccinated. I've following vaccination policies India last 6-7 months, government fucked real hard, less chances we'll achieve good vaccine coverage anytime soon, it'll likely take one year. 

Yes, I've read vaccine hesitancy India lower, people trying best change that. There's fraud named ""Baba Ramdev"" massive following, claiming shit vaccines allopathy general. claimed without source 1000 doctors died vaccination (this claim bullshit btw), yoga ayurveda save India. He's promote ""coronil"" advertises sure shot way fight corona (That bullshit). company loosing profit margins had, people vaccinated able promote coronil. 

Why ranting much this? people listen him. People India gullible, follow hack person. 

I sincerely hope wrong proof work here. one 3 ""approved"" vaccines. like travelling doctors note lol anti-spike IgG levels vaccination higher usual (13276 aU/ml, Abbott quantitive test system), feel relieved Covid-19 important time? Yes, I'm sure episodes origins SARS-CoV-2. would Baric signed letter learn thinking. curiosity Fosun distribute Moderna too? There's big hoo-hah BNT allegations true, can't Taiwan sidestep bait buying Moderna basically terms efficacy side effects? like, US put order Pfizer them?

They also homegrown vaccines way eliminate need buy China, hopefully tide till then. Yeah agree. wanted frontline workers get masks first instead general public. suspect arguments suggesting vaccines basis gender logistics psychology. wrong. One dose vaccine, endpoint? disease, level severity? hard determine exactly many people acquired natural immunity. Also, moderate case generate persistent immunity? mild case? asymptomatic case? so, long? 
 
Medical professionals fully aware post-convalescent immunity factor, formulating public health policy many unknowns relied upon definitive way out, vaccinations recommended even someone past infection.

O\_o still idiots here, they're limited facebook groups occasional swarming poor little town (literally thousands pro-plague protesters show up): that's far less efficient platform actively (or least passively) sabotages vaccination efforts.

I've flu life exactly (about 15 years ago) - definitely cold, pretty much worst I've ever felt. Since then, I've gotten flu shot every year without fail. know many years 50/50 shot best whether work particular strain managed run into, protection better none. even modest protection via flu vaccine cuts risk much, makes 90+% effectiveness mRNA COVID vaccines even no-brainer. Japan probably agenda aside helping others, China certainly has, could catastrophic Taiwan. Similarly, wear seat belt I've never accident seems kinda messed thise us participated trial, good everyone, shut travel/venues jobs.

There plenty data already proving NovaVax least effective J&amp;J.  Thank you!

Of course, would wreck economy he's trying walk back bullshit ship Florida okay ask. Never mind way international waters work, would ask proof vaccinations getting ship, land.

Also Biden Johnson meeting summit next week. pandemics still over. cant pretend like everythings back normal. majority world COVID complete control. Back dem primary ended bunch anti-Biden centrist Dems wanted nomination handed Cuomo instead. 

That would absolute disaster democrat party  free everywhere. country offers free elderly, healthcare workers immuno deficient people. everyone paying *that* effective Well, see wearing masks November contributes closed schools. Rather opposite. geT TeSTeD brO. 

Yes let book test every 3 days. Oh wait. can’t. Suprised WA list ""just lesser (uninteligible word)"" understatement century.

The line risk covid becomes extremely small, fractions hundredth %, around 40-45 years old.

Let guess, vaccinated boomer? banter mate  Yes, infer based said. might right. said. also lot less dangerous compared VITT assumed ""concern troll."" Feeling weather? Stay home. Valneva different study. arent trying show efficacy. basically head head vs ChAdOx vaccine. hope (?) eventually MHRA authorize vaccine long produces similar better immune response ChAdOx far deadlier average flu season. point arguing 588,000 thousand deaths causing anything shut down. case, point would number large enough warrant shut down? Keep mind, 588,000 deaths even mitigating effects shut down. would number nothing done? Talk /r/Persecutionfetish 

It totally depends intent. them? Like, referring specific type drug?

Because talking like Tamiflu COVID-19, that's antiviral get right back poster talking them. also show proof recent test former COVID19 infection. proof vaccination. occasionally hear people never tested positive COVID-19 despite living taking care multiple people COVID-19. is, apparently never even much asymptomatic infection, rather infection all.

Is possible people fight virus entirely innate immunity? consequently, possible acquire adaptive immune memory (antibodies, B cells, cells) encounter SARS-CoV-2? correlates protection like flu vaccine. vaccine produces similar neutralizing antibody levels Pfizer vaccine? authorized long cause harm 10K people phase 3. requirement show works. get co-workers want go back office. started going back couple days week honestly I'm less productive work random office banter question easily answered sending message, screen sharing, phone call. need see people's faces get work done, I'm much comfortable wearing shorts, shoes, comfy home chair 30inch monitor.

I'm suspecious coworkers want get away families 8 hours. I've also self-employed I'm used guess. That’s great news. two doses? Correct i'm wrong, vaccine hesitancy lower UK European country. that, exactly playing politics. 

goal save lives, would Hamas control matter? Hamas sell vaccine buy missiles? no. Yep. 

And saw exact opposite thing back May June.

Big Businesses rural/r3d areas requiring masks whereas small businesses areas requiring masks. trapped cruise ship foreign port viral disease spreading sounds like plot 70s disaster movie. Yet, actually happened. wonder unvaccinated staff members driven outbreaks deaths care lose sleep harm deaths they've caused.

William Gallagher recently posted certain site whose name begins virological ends org frame 12 nucleotide insert SARS2 genome everyone pouncing media actually happened two stages: 9 nucleotide recombinant existing bat coronaviruses followed 3 nucleotide repeat.

That's interesting. watching something Challenger Columbia disasters. elements could researched fixed foreseen. thing haunted kid Challenger happened, survived way ground. several minutes think imminent death. would mercy die quickly. think Columbia happened sooner heat reentry, still think must felt.

The true pandemic. us critical thinking skills understood immediately asymptomatic spread real problem disease, understood likely spread least degree via aerosols (I read study April May 2020). masking need became obvious us, seemed elude many others. remember thinking pandemic potential back first heard January 2020 (which feels like 20 years ago).

It might anti maskers COVID deniers would existed anyway. ilk fueled politicians whose self centeredness egregious audacity believe pandemic affecting entire world cooked take down. Add social media gives people loudest worst opinions outsized platform spew terrible ideas probably well meaning ignorant populace recipe disaster.

I'm sure people got dumber, gave much credit past. Probably mix both. pains see many people paid lives lives loved ones. hope never lose much faith humanity ever again. unfortunately, I'll never forget. message non-N95 masks protect wearer consistent entire pandemic. message masks help prevent infected wearers spreading virus also consistent. People heard ""masks protect me"" decided meant ""masks work"". smart, people like Dr. Fauci still government gives tiny bit hope future. amazing many incredibly smart qualified people stay away public office fear putting bullseye themselves, families, friends. sucks. absolutely will. feel silly knowing this....

I’m vaccinated 2 young kids aren’t. places opening bit, risk using busy vrbo houses air bnb? mask everywhere go, wouldn’t rented house. We’ve spent last 16 months pretty locked don’t want screw now. mean, they're everywhere internet. first time gotten name type behavior, mean reddit's place them. Yes, that’s point. level risk vaccinated person wearing mask significant. already huge decrease risk getting vaccinated. claiming level risk still high, stop high least vulnerable group chance get vaccinated. I’m asking think level tipping point.

For example, person vaccinated wearing mask higher risk passing virus child vaccinated person without mask. vaccines available, consider acceptable level risk? probably function state in, state health authority funded ads promotion shot. unlikely, impossible. fifty days January February, averaged one 9/11 per day. I'm sure continue make big deal 9/11 big deal.

 Maybe planes, buildings, Arabs. certainly people died. Congratulation, well done. Hope people US take vaccine ASAP life get back normal. Kids become main spreaders point, mostly older kids. protecting adults without immunity kids. week later would still damn impressive IMO Looks like brainwashing worked :) Really? would assume legislature favorable giant lobbying power like pharmaceutical industry would get GOP attention hope learn strong early mitigation measures pay dividends later critical time.

Under logic entire world would live constant lockdown rest eternity, there's always new variant. Advocating lockdowns 75% people vaccinated case numbers still low moronic. flu shot bigger thing US Western countries ""older vulnerable people"" thing.

Im UK, id say common get healthy adult 50ish.

We're bit ""stiff upper lip"" things. chicken pox vaccine either. get complain.

It's different culture. Totally. friends family zero interest cruising (and everyone else board) vaccinated. much risk otherwise. people feel comfortable conventional medical settings would feel comfortable church or, barber shop. like go pharmacy get shot. can't attribute reduction flu numbers past year mask wearing practice overlapped social distancing. First, yet good understanding nuances measures reduced disease transmission. Second, if/when do, degree willing use measures future preventing diseases seasonl flu? attribute 75% reduction masks, that's easily adoptable, replicable practice future use. However, social distancing responsible 75% reduction transmission, much difficult costly measure enforce. really hope hot headed politician activist decides start exterminating bats destroying habitats. absolutely essential ecosystem.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* aren’t second class. haven’t vaccine yet deem high risk allowed cross borders. Hopefully get shot soon! Gotta say really dig names. Based comment threads FB cruises leaving US requiring vaccines, 20% seems believable - maybe even low. ones want vaxx really loud it. China trying pull funny business probably thinking since island hang em dry despite fact interest fight thing aggressively possible. talk booster shots gonna work next year?

Are people gonna go back masking distancing waiting shot next year? Interesting got first shot start February, developed pin prick rash arms week later, reported dr told worry, links anything, got second dose couple months ago issues literally listened couple idiots work talk vaccine killing people saving government trying cover up

But...why? government gain administering vaccine kills saves covering up? 50% drop per week, real pressure healthcare system residual. New infections aren’t filling ICUs. people caught covid weeks ago. We’re 1800 cases week 21 7600 week 18, 5500 week 19, 3300 week 20. Cases keep dropping matter summer. Don’t take rights away us least. There's general staff shortage, places able fire unvaccinated employees since hard find replacements me, think anywhere implemented half measures truly waste. True lockdowns would slowed disease much more, ""half lockdowns"" ended disaster hurt people economically also containing disease well. Thats frustrated US state autonomy, page wasting lot time, money, lives, sadly three. ""Not providing perfect perfection"" != ""Not effective"" furthermore clearly said people sick medical professionals. Pretty tortured logic people come say claimed effective said needed risk people already infected. Yeah, clearly that's going happen - meant cases per day, whereby expect converge around 10k daily cases. happen know MDs who've said pretty nutty health things along lines there's particular MD vs. nurse distinction issue. Canada here. don't. enough first doses. wait months get second dose enough vaccine. one follow Japan's example stockpiling vaccines without distributing them. Ruby Princess

I'm gonna miss it. Hell ship. isnt enough doses, waiting line long, get darn test.

Cases dropping Stockholm hospitals still overburdened - staff even more, give break. mean... I'm sure understand cost/benefit. alive. make decisions every day endanger others greater lesser degrees. general, people agree higher level risk makes greater level caution appropriate. UK 4.5 million cases USA 34 million cases. think month UK going 30 million cases? Maybe I’m reading comment wrong. second doses ramping up. rate like 0.5% first doses 0.4% second doses. closer 1% population day getting dose. Hey - heard lot different things whether vaccinated person still carry coronavirus potentially infect people not, answer that? 

Also thank this, it’s cool see stuff like Reddit.    I.e. want people without medical degrees meddle   emergency use authorization implies additional risk,

This false. additional risk. EUAs mean can't guarantee efficacy certain point, risky fully authorized vaccine. blatantly misleading. vaccines different ingredients. unlikely allergic them. There's numerous reports takes 15 minutes close contact spread properly.

More reports.  That's CDC's definition ""close contact"" used contact COVID-19, close contact anyone within 6 feet infected person total 15 minutes more. infected person spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) person symptoms tests positive COVID-19. person still considered close contact even wearing mask around someone totally agree this. dont like china japan (i'm korean) japan shortage never see benevolent. would different story america donated since pretty much country vacinne surplus moment movie? would donate doses even manufacturer vaccines still crippling lockdowns country. anyone brain anymore? exactly reason makes think repeated warnings O-rings Challenger, engineers knew real concern foam strikes Columbia upper brass think either big enough threats put heavier research into. late. humans keep repeating pattern! Research possibilities, seems nessecary.  Hello, thanks AMA.

I would like know vaccine currently available involve use HEK293 cells stages.

Thank much.

Edit: Sorry English. native language.  true, hoping find websites publishing trustworthy articles aren't. calling Pfizer vaccine doubt. saying could article somewhere exaggerating side-effects. bit speculative side .. ever considered viruses vectors gene transfer along species ? quite true. don’t Pfizer, Moderna Novavax yet enough AZ begin heavily vaccinating country. lot people refusing it. confident three vaccines deployed US, specifically Moderna vaccine, elicit sufficient T-cell responses? Specifically, CD-8+ t-cells.

There significant “talk” early Spring Moderna vaccine elicit CD-8+ t-cells. I’ve seen studies since imply indeed does, also implied low levels. believe Moderna (and Pfizer j&amp;j we’re it) bestow sufficient t-cell immunity?

Thank you! know someone died flu late 30s. induced heart attack. might've heart issues went doctor regular never diagnosed heart issues anything else, carrying extra 20ish pounds. 

I've always gotten flu shot circle friends militant it.  I’m Spahn RKI one. reason Germany well last spring cautious taking right steps. Better seem “slower” careful way around, especially end finally near Well it’s internet… ""Motorcycle accidents"" Yes, possible virus infections trigger long illnesses. one hypotheses emergence ME/CFS, could triggered virus infection. nuts almost million excess deaths year, people claiming nothing, like flu. think excess deaths came from? unpopular opinion fact Fauci allowed lie American people say masks effective keep us hoarding masks profound betrayal. Even order came directly Trump. man took Hippocratic Oath position today. quit job day rather hasten deaths fellow Americans.  I've noticed Japan barely ensure adequate supply vaccines home
 
Fundamental premise lie though. Japan already bought enough vaccines, problem they're giving fast enough. Donating doses sitting warehouses absolutely using vaccines intended purpose saving lives. 
 
Also [transparently hypocritical since China actively trying discredit non-Chinese vaccines geopolitical gain months People can’t get vaccinated never able vaccinated. saying wear masks forever? one left country hasn’t chance get vaccinated, except young children. supply, demand longer there.

Also, wearing mask vaccinated already orders magnitude better wearing mask vaccinated. wearing mask good enough, vaccinated suddenly not?

I’m also curious think cloth disposable medical masks acceptable risk? Shouldn’t wearing N95 masks really care children? even putting innocent people risk. Really, wearing hazmat suits staying home.

This want actually give real line could realistically cross point. level risk low enough morally condemn someone wearing mask? winning election Trudeau. Fitness transmissibility. Transmission movement virus one host another. measure reproductive index, number people infected average infected person. SARS-CoV-2 2-3 changed variant, opinion. Fitness ability virus reproduce host population. Fitness influenced many factors, including ability evade innate antibody responses, particle stability, mutational robustness, even transmission. likely affecting fitness SARS-CoV-2 variants evasion antibody spike. experiments understand variants fit done.

T cell epitopes change individual, transmit another person move population. reason cell surface receptors display cell peptides different everyone. cell evasion occur individual people long term infections like HIV-1 hepatitis C, move population.  I’m 31 also used never get flu shot; hadn’t flu since maybe 7 didn’t think it. got flu age maybe 26 knocked ass five days... I’m religious flu shots haha. Interesting see Australia’s unfolding situation. Apparently they’re back pre pandemic level economic growth, need maintain public health sustain it. solution pretty much vaccinate everyone ASAP lockdown every time there’s outbreak they’ve doing? seems like vaccination program going slowly. Starting Monday BioNTech alone deliver extra 1.7m doses, we’re supposed get extra J&amp;J shots also. we’re probably slow little bit first dose administration, huge impact.

All without CureVac, still pending … years offered. well, least recommended really good. case years back. friend hates needles flu mist (though get Pfizer shots, hated it). Dr. Peter McCullough (hope spelled right) used combination ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine remdesivir (hope also spelled right) treat COVID patients worked well. hundreds studies saying drugs work people early stages COVID. interview recently talking this. reason people stopped using one article published Lancet. 

So, vaccination COVID combined treatment patients COVID key stopping pandemic. know people recovered (and lung damage side effects) strong immunity virus.

Note reader : vaccinated waiting second dose. say that, though. said ""Stay home."" people staying home choice. People come work sick ""so happy come work sick"" lol keep hearing coworkers claim never got flu got flu shot, obviously flu shot caused flu. Idiots. got flu years ago knocked ass five days. first 48 hours brutal particular; remember delusional high fever sitting Walgreens wanting curl die. hours home I’d thirsty exhausted get bed walk 15 feet sink. miserable. fuck kind flu COVIDIOTS get, flus I’ve awful.  Exactly this. Taiwan’s Covid outbreak bad pales comparison Nepal, India, Brazil many south Asian South American countries.

Giving first world nation like Taiwan vaccines would be... bit slap face many poor countries. I’d understand it, I’d still disappointed. Sounds good. enough now, certainly help countries. I'm aware lot people can't that, I'd like change instead everyone told wear mask come work sick. Westerners love praising Japan masks that, Japan one worst work cultures world. Let's try steer away instead happy come work sick mask US grow pair help people need. Yes, two doses  What? work then? can't fly Berlin drive? make sense? EU page mentions travel, single specific mode travel defined. .. case, hard evidence, anyone bit knowledge tactics usually employed CCP rope countries China's way things, would see credibility truth report.

In short, China likely actively severing talks Taiwan vaccine suppliers, leaving one channel open Taiwan take bait. 

Next thing see Taiwan takes bait? China accuse Taiwan ingrate conflicts.

Yeah eventually Taiwan may end choice take China's offer. want highlight glaring hypocrisy China here. (But what's new anyway? always China things. Despicable, nothing new) got point. chunk 30% likely 50% Mississippi Alabama suffer die order us reach herd immunity. Someone like Fauci Osterholm going react horror suggestion letting play them.  Big thank team TWIV, enormous help year. also enjoy non-sars-cov-2 episodes, certainly gonna keep listening pandemic over. Viruses fascinating!

I question variants. Early pandemic, much info viral evolution, aside D614G change arose early believe everywhere. Then, B.1.1.7 detected UK December 2020, new variant interest/concern found like every month.

Do think significant evolutionary pressure virus early pandemic (all population immunologically naive, masks, etc)? simply looking? vaccine seems entirely effective preventing covid NZ open again? accept increased covid deaths even everyone vaccinated. 

Gonna hurt morale bit would imagine.  People rather go fancy cruise respect environment. Love subreddit downvotes idea respectful environment.. hmm.. Looks like Governor Florida Man going responsible multimillion-dollar industry moving Georgia."
