its many think it,

just heads state countries world

other top ranking officials government countries world

those leading hospitals/health care countries world

anyone works hospitals/health care countries world 

all scientists medical sciences

funeral directors

all actors pretend die

all actors pretend mourn loved one

all actors fake going hospital

obviously mask makers, goes without saying

funeral directors/grave diggers

So yeah, like said. many. least nobody's boat get sunk...

Well done. droplets. Depending they're made medical grade (if available), they'll block 80-99%. That's there's also social distancing. Try keep up. class outside college sometimes... I'll honest- highly unproductive classes! Dumbass redditors bending backwards hallucinate conspiracies everything — name iconic duo. only. get close enough ass, explosive diarrhea would complex plane. kidding. 7 billion people. 1 death. Go back shell. Show post. area upstate NY? live Rochester area mask usage still pretty high, I'd say least 90%. like receiving tuxedo rental bill buried. think meant “Your comments make feel bad realizing piece shit everyone sub reveling death, need create cognitive dissonance justify shouldn’t make world better place jumping cliff.” Except human lives!

One death many! yes know it’s flu it’s dangerous flu, there’s vaccine 1,2,3,5,10 years would treated like flu. It’s going grip society full years, know less threat mundane Indoor vs. outdoor environments affected terms air resistance, present circumstances. Even if, somehow, +/- 10 mph, 100-mph sneeze cannot blocked human reflexes. physically impossible, hence rule 6-10 feet; that's far need avoid 95-99% droplets getting you, even mask. mask blocked droplets, would reason social distancing. even outdoors, within 6-10 feet, still risk infection. Let's take wind considerable air resistance; would depend direction, even wind blowing away you, could infect person directly behind infected person, assuming they're within 6-10 feet. fact, wind would increase relative speed sneeze 100 mph 110, 115, not. Thus, assertion provably false. write pretty bad confusing correlation causation. article describes methodology essentially looking correlation BLM protest participation coronavirus cases. One way potentially meaningless mask usage highly correlated ""blue tribe"" (ie liberal, urban, white collar) areas, also BLM support would correlated with. tell, attempt control this, big problem attempts infer causation/lack thereof. crap data whether protests driver post-Memorial Day case growth. Intuitively, protests people socially distant probably fine; protests probably not. strong authoritarian government force people ""right"" thing! 

Pesky pesky liberty! /s cares? Nothing lose. Adverse reactions vaccines already uncommon, especially happen say, years getting it. adverse reaction happens usually immediately after, days after. Mexico pretty bad shape quite time now. know!?

It's novel vaccine! Potentially stupid question, US reference quality ones elsewhere? guess maybe could different mutations could present different countries maybe it'd suffer comes predictions accurate? Haha! Muslims concentration camps. Every single story already debunked, you’re still peddling racist lie.

Meanwhile, Americans hate cops, hate Mexicans, hate blacks, hate kill Muslims oil, want wage war billion Chinese.

You better wake really early tomorrow get food line, buddy. Lots Americans going hungry they’ve got shitty government. feel lot like sober person party. husband high risk we’ve locked inside house since March. can’t risk getting sick. must yoga block droplets either way. homemade masks fine long made thick cloth layered material. Every case noticed April would probably ten twenty cases noticed now. current waves fraction size early ones younger segments population - NOW. stopped expanding current rate things eventually get ugly. mean interested knowing dude went school 30 years ago completely removed life eats every day lunch dinner? none? want long term effects Covid? Short term Covid? I'm surprised president brainwashed millions thinking flu, go away Easter. Let’s change bit—if face inches ass explosive diarrhea, would rather underwear not? Finally someone included implied 'at least' rather screaming opposite unsupported. facebook could useful, provides exposure small business, basically everyone website business quickly free without knowing anything HTML programming. 

could also useful events groups, i've subscribed various groups find useful, like local second hand markets cyclists groups city. 

but also full toxic things. think learn use FB properly prevent toxic people using quit completely. 

but would completely ok move different better platform fuck Zuckenberg. America, World.. test around 11k per million.. imagine that... number 154th world tests per million. 

We 15 best economy world... justify way handling pandemic? honestly cannot believe tried talk sense someone posts r/consipracy. Fuck fell it. Where? fancy certificates? paper?? again—how relevant? It’s 100 mph, speed matter case it’s constant. isn’t constant impact sneeze indoor environment vs outdoor environment Masks block droplets (a) they're sanitized; (b) use appropriate material; (c) worn times completely cover nose mouth. Spoiler alert: true times, especially ""designed"" ""bought"" non-medical grade masks. Actually, I’m Vietnamese dude living Orange County, California. I’m fairly middle road, refusing take one side America’s political war.

Only reason support BLM puts racist white teenagers like place. no, get: ""we able live lives"", ""cabin fever"", ""what's meaning living we're cooped houses"". 

That's opposite ""whiny little bitches"" you. Continue exactly internet. Meow brains fried LSD molly hell going on. 

Just say drugs, kids.  adverse reaction happens long term!? new projections seem useless old ones, reverse direction. think unlikely US exceed 300k. Every territory, state, county, town look like they're different things. Ohio State already filled three quarantine dorms started renting hotels turn temporary quarantine dorms. No. reason many anti-vaxxers today strictly ignorance, major side effects. assume you’re talking increased incidence Guillain-Barré 1976 vaccine? order one additional case every 100,000 doses administered. Upstate ny never high rates infection deaths kept numbers down. herd immunity sure outdoor sneeze different indoor sneeze. let's test theory: fast sneeze come one's nose? We'll say human average. terrifying prospect, hopefully last long parents would hopefully stear clear universities common.. India probably still keep driving numbers months. hope stopping anymore. I'm advocating Reddit better. Also seems don’t understand masks block projection droplets, protests didn’t tied outbreaks (well fact outdoors) Something tells pandemic exclusion like forms insurance US :) blame game. plainly describing typical progress Linguistics. people positive coronavirus attended school tests pending. Also focus people symptoms worse time get tested. Earlier detection tends increase likelihood survival virus. re-open everything’s fine stage Pardon relevant? Jesus excessive... im precautions like next level. traveled 1700 miles, really tough around individuals less 15 minutes. Get decent kn95 masks poop real bathroom lol. Hotels fast food joints fins, unless shared hostel indoor dining another guest cough mouth wouldnt stress. dont think around one person besides partner 3 minutes whole trip, people wear masks indoors.. They're lying. - 3 weeks, still time
- none DIED, sick?
- trust Russian medical reporting, wherein dissenting doctors get thrown Windows Many protesters wear mask, protests wall-to-wall people. Besides, cloth mask much good. crammed area lots lots people hours end, going end breathing shared air anyway. mask slows exhaled particles; stop altogether.

Why data showing (BLM) protests contributed virus spread? none collected. Deliberately. say specifically referring whether stops virus, speaking generally. Obviously one article mean vaccine magically 100% safe effective. maybe start using common sense realize incredibly stupid move actually weld people inside apartments? Yes, that's English grammar works. fast sneeze come nose? Let's talk physics. 

I'll wait look answer. Firefox let's stop videos autoplaying. breaks sites let play videos all. Yeah right? Stops fairly harmless coronavirus, gives cancer 6 months later, don’t see need complaints ! really think protestors covid deniers? Uh, remove masks refuse socially distance? Even masks, one infect someone else within 6-10 feet. 

""Sarcasm"" not, gathering like that, either Minneapolis Sturgis. 24,000 hell lot Russia's 76. go long way towards understanding effectiveness potential adverse reactions. 24,000 zombies soon.  really focused energy stopping nonessential indoor transmission events. Instead places closed hiking trails parks! Right?

Work jail adjacent people access free testing, close reported news, even locally. There's maybe three cases total since March.  making stuff up. stating things like facts pure speculation. Whatever say, bro.

Bye. depends employer pretty much applies well-paid full time career jobs. solid guarantee leave US pre-covid FMLA, eligible simply 2 week leave period. response Covid, FFCRA passed. provides pay **once** period required quarantine, eligibility requirements leave half US workers loop. Never said sneeze can’t infect you. indoor sneeze outdoor sneeze.  That's clinical trials. make sure safe widespread usage. outdoor concerts masks? Uh don’t think understand want test vaccines. It’s incase doesn’t stop coronavirus, it’s whether months later get horribly sick vaccine itself. 

So probably care ?? /r/moronavirus Well theory, it’s different Oxford vaccine. scientist, agree it’s ludicrous insist findings one vaccine, regardless similarity, would perfectly translated. 

However shared nature adenovirus vector showed would illicit response dangerous usage. 

Our issues vaccine candidates - efficacy. self-isolated weeks protests Honestly, saw exact situation coming. Similar thing happened back beginning trying send people California deal initial Cruise Ship outbreaks. Probably part reason managed make state quickly did. Ok👌🏼 2 weeks, median 5 days. I'm sure lives different area, around there's probably 7 8 free testing clinics, I've one once. can't believe option go employer pay much. 

America gotten sour. wish government would care people stop caring money big companies. Yes, point exception. guarantee implementing lockdown results overwhelmed hospitals. different story. Interesting what's mind asking. understand conspiracy nut jobs latch onto random straws ignore ACTUAL shit that's fucked 48 hours actual fucked shit discovered they've forgotten moved on. like dig find fucked shit China actually doing. 

IMO dictator/criminal politician/government right I'd getting press conference going ""yeah murdered people, big whoop. Talk amongst self's 48 hours let's move on"" shit die shit dead. *Person stepping woodwork*: “Only 5700 people died Sweden, Economy dropped, nearly low did. real problem shutting everything down.” also could broadcast classes tv well areas people without decent internet like Mexico. lol no.
This test *ongoing* infections. individuals, scary small risk death. think we’re beating compare economic declines well. Heres solution. youre wealthy good insurance get it. not, get fucked.


Nothing ordinary sarcastic understand critical mass needed herd immunity? Damn called lulz Here's spin they'll use: ""we could done nothing, like Sweden, we'd better right now. social distancing lockdowns waste time hurt economy."" Sweden Mar 18th-Aug 11th Reported Covid-19 deaths: 5,787 5,340 excess deaths. 


US: March 15 - Aug. 8 Reported Covid-19 deaths 161,882 223,900 excess deaths. 


So Sweden reported 400 deaths, US reported 62k Oh sure, many shady purposes, business nonbusiness alike.

Always find funny though, people claiming govt successfully keeping whistleblowers quiet millions deaths presumably still rampant virus point phone account info *released government* evidence cover up.

A lot things stretch, include ""well realm possibility"", ""you can't prove not"", one always found particularly dumb. close friend wanted go wedding next month US wont bring vaccine us Russian im going Korea get vaccinated. Please don’t... obvious deflection Let's go sing bar use microphone like bunch fucking idiots Except regions lockdown spared country essentially close zero cases.

In addition economic impact huge, tourism one country.
So find thousand people maybe financially struggling know anybody covid difficult. Considering mixing crowd vax mask that. Newsom closing beaches Labor Day California 🤔. Maybe send “study” Funny, take china equation virtually economic gains - personal non bezos level - disappear.


Really, proud specifically? Besides nebulous ‘freedom’ killed million people for, jealous freedom apparently... anything isnt feeling superiority nothing? stop, better say slow spread, reproduction number us 1, means 1 infected person spreads virus less 1 person. achieve that, correct, need detect many cases possible take required measures, namely quarantine. vulnerable people

This might come surprise, Sweden quite people 75+ and/or belong risk groups. There's millions left, 5800 dead. anyone COVID nasal test, feel? I'm afraid test going hurt shoved nose deep. heard people say really painful, say hurt feels uncomfortable, people said feel like anything. know short testing sample still fear.  Stop brainwashed Redditors. pure lies. deaths Europe literally fewer numbers deaths periods previous years. imagine climate change going go.


People believe deadly wet bulb temperatures fake grandma dies AC goes out. 


Daily new deaths per million: France 0.2 ; Sweden: 0.08 Good China also home largest click bot farms world. surprised see shit load prepaid phones drop owners can't get people leave house bot, bother paying business expenses. seedy organisations, even account small business got wrecked. process issue bit cumbersome here. thinking post seemed weird enough ICU beds great, actually need enough personnel trained taking care ICU patients, enough equipment (ppe etc) patients (ventilators etc). Without two components ""enough ICU beds"" basically worthless. 😢 I’m talking comparing excess mortality rate per capita countries, obviously. 

Here figures NYT, Swedish American data goes early August. Sweden negative excess mortality rates right numbers going down, even bump deaths 6000 US already far ahead (650 vs 600 per true. countries (italy example) running 100k+ daily swabs vs 50/60k lockdown blood tests included, tests initially available. addition 70-80% asymptomatic many found screening procedures, ranging contact tracing people tested hospitalized planned surgeries workers.

So numbers today definitely comparable disaster happened 6 months ago. Dakota dismisses '**elite** class so-called experts,'

Do think experts live mansions fancy beards yachts? experts educated civilians. UK chose 2m arn't noted overly careful covid19.

And 6ft freequently ends 5ft practice. 3ft would end nothing. already did. !RemindMe 12-31-2020 exactly flatten curve is. Spreading cases long time, keeping society running much possible keeping rate infection overrun hospitals. Lockdowns flattening curve. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  [Here's president showing good luck charms (The english subtitles perfect, get idea he's saying. Whenever says ""detente"" means good luck charm.) race horse better persuading people are.

Your downvote's long winded rants make sound like asshole would beg differ. 

Also there's thing called paragraph. pretty neat, give try. rich aren’t hence would leave increase taxes. It’s also convenient spend people’s money people already complain slave wages well. You’re also looking 20% tax increase well. mention loss private insurance everyone already 175 million people. terminology people use wrong. Wet markets problem, exotic animals sold wet markets problem. Wet markets without exotic animals exist even majority, buy scientists, even China earning exotic animal trade causing issues decades. Three Ohio class submarines South China Sea would take 10 minutes launchwith 24 Trident D-5
missiles 8 warheads comes approximately 592 incoming presents virus hosts GameOver!!!! really disinformation campaign, like fact 6% US deaths involving Covid, entirely caused Covid.

Then fallen it/are part it. 6% time, death narrowed beyond ""had covid"".

The common comorbidities time death include pneumonia acute respiratory distress, *caused covid*. statement true, despite Trump's CDC trying associate comorbidities - even acute ones - pre-existing conditions, separate matter altogether.

But watch apparently new information bounce you, like water duck's back. subreddit sarcastically say ""Who could've known?"" repeat. That's ... unfortunate, put mildly. knew health system US bad, aware effed officials come law, least agreement, includes everyone equally, even ""just"" current situation. 😢 Maybe understand, running death certificates? able print more, piece paper. Oof, going sad day. RIP advance, Neopets. one best time wasters ever, missed 😔 Feeling butthurt? welcome leave. guess extrapolate, seems like really good leaving healthy people without issue, pre existing conditions going die. also huge flu vaccine push winter too, may helped. don’t, still wouldn’t go far say need become like China. went abt 3 months state decided everything fine work shot never got stimulus get working. awhile everything got depressing lighten bit tbh. see close friends mask times get weekly tests every Monday. Still trying best. believe experts, fact others. put 100% faith say. mean attacking them, means using critical thinking.

Bye, sensitivie people concerned COVID probably oblivious fact millions children die around world every year preventable causes including malnutrition. 

Perhaps care preventable deaths first world countries want people bringing coronavirus back.

That's great. guess wait disease eradicated worldwide allow people back Oz. cousin London still recovering disease

Sorry hear that. Post-viral fatigue, virus-induced heart problems, lung issues known outcome kind hope fallen ""6%"" disinformation campaign

It's really disinformation campaign, like fact 6% US deaths involving Covid, entirely caused Covid. even surprising, data around while. also similar results UK. provide perspective Covid-19 compared pandemics, example 1918 Spanish Flu, disproportionally killed young, healthy people. would never million years disregard right life quickly have.

I would never disregard putting millions house arrest martial law. right die virus vaccine - automatically trump rights. COVID nowhere near 'as deadly possible', Universities make money way, especially they'll large decline international students while. Sweden likely excess mortality well isn’t valid comparison Yep absolutely agree. turning point making political issue planning open bars, clubs, in-door dining, stadiums public. Imagine Trump scalping Sanders wearing face mask. That's AMLO. No, refers materials since flagged relevant production Covid-19 test kits. See also [http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/trade-interdependencies-in-covid-19-goods-79aaa1d6/](http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/trade-interdependencies-in-covid-19-goods-79aaa1d6/) wait 2021 New Year celebrations China country lighting fireworks partying. 

Oh irony ...muhhh freedummsss wearing mask !!! fucking short-sighted dimwits yall need dictatorship see freedom really is. No, I'm pretty sure misunderstood article about. guy 10k test. insurance company did. huge issue clinics charge much test knowing insurance companies pay it.  Absolutely! It’s fine say protest worth risks don’t hypocrite act like didn’t cause issues spike cases guy follow Instagram flew Mexico City Guadalajara last week, party. Tu raison, mes excuses. Believe me, wanted insult intelligence passive aggressively drawing attention possible typo. would call fucking idiot directly. Now, fucking idiot shut damn typo jesus christ.. could slang changed meaning trying say thats asked make sure. 

So agree end day! Yeah people protest others can't go grandparents funeral, go place worship reopen business? BLM important? 

One rule thee another violates basis Liberal, democratic societies. Uhmmm

1. He's lawyer state Florida harassed absolutely 0 people. 

2. protest moron governor. trying raise awareness many people killing. Hence.... grim reaper.

3. going insult someone maybe actually able present facts. say live here? story guy every media outlet weeks........ feels good wear mask work instead dying gong work all. article definitely written intention raising alarm Mexico putting heads readers 1.1 million likely die COVID. got early, damage already done lock down. locked late, health care service overwhelmed. Care homes deaths far worst among larger countries Western Europe. meant worst deaths Europe world, although countries taken South America.

In terms lock down, UK worse, took longer drop cases. Spain's strict lock worked, opened faster everyone else, without testing reporting infrastructure contain virus. Sounds like silent mold. 2. live everyday lives without worrying much ""the spanish flu"" nowadays. thing course happen new coronavirus.  


3. Malaria kills people access treatment, otherwise treatable. agreement that, there's still long way go happens. feel bad laughing this. course ideal air conditioning can't generate virus, exists before, infected one needs really infected, generating large viral load. 

I'd say schools countries poor air condition, number countries schools open months, without wearing mask still spread infections. moment would say impossible know. know Lt. Gubner Trump appointed Branstad embassator China. Thats helluva appointment, huh? jerk deserved it.. reaction distracting point making. pay 12 dollars instead 40. 

Does compare orders magnitude difference 10k test. 

Than looks like searching excuse. 

But hey: ofcourse great things US also bad things Europe. like operating systems computers: suck, different way ;). Yes. Number 1! NUMBER 1!! Absolutely messed outdoor transmission went overboard. contributed hoax talk Mexico serial number, must filled hand administrative hurdles expeded, process cumbersome. We're still process moving towards digital processes there. Masks obviously limits. idea wearing mask protect people miles away stupid.

Masks great situation social distancing option. social distancing possible, staying away much effective matter american sources might say. 43% UK population going die Covid-19. suppose would horrifying believed evil government killing huge numbers people fat bonuses. Free U.K. go private, it’s £65 BUPA. month ago?? Seriously, karaoke bars open, Canada? I’d thought textbook case choir rehearsal would served cautionary tale America’s smarter brother 😣 if. And, anti-science folks, mom's multilingual genius high sorts, already lizard person began. 🖤  Would nice copy pasted every Moderna article. Even caught slipping trap 'conspiracy' theory regarding vaccine.

Was refreshing informative read, thank you. LA? That's tryna win pissing contest emptying waterbottles urinal.

Their Phase III involves whole Russian population. mass rollout getting 'good PR' it.

Though agree. ridiculous publicity stunt. Number tests close peak it’s actually opposite-people testing. Might testing even Norway. counties order self test need see doc :) schools opened in-person learning responsible cases must keep infected quarantine ***on campus*** students safe send home.

There needs substantial, punitive consequences schools don’t. human beings need meet other. Usually. spend months alone, would mind. still kids. want party, want meet other. certainly differences though. number pan-Nordic defense procurement projects crashed burned eye opening. mom testing one vaccine. body right now. doctor university professor doctoral students. Vaccines amazing fucking YAY science! gets paid $1600 participate,and placebo, gets first dibs real thing. rigorous efficacy safety standard. 🔥 ? know people got weeks ago. isnt first covid-19 actual present back then, explode epidemic? basically everywhere went Wuhan outbreak.

I literally answered question California parallel. Baseball canceled also make changes well. Also point think people organizations going lie what's going keep gravy change going. holds wedding, there's actual possibility people's deaths could caused it?

You'd forever live fact wedding killed someone think swedes stopped going doctor feel like corona. what's point :D Protesters cramming bars, tattoo parlors, casinos. Sturgis attendees were. hand winters cold dry conditions COVID thrives compared lot northern hemisphere countries - gone - 

Do think people wear masks jailed?
yes no?

Come humanity, I'm rooting you... Yet hardest hit areas left-leaning. people 'Ride Die' friendships. folks 'Ride Die' acquaintances. think it’s kind adorable name vaccine Sputnik 5. Hate say it, US fucked over. evidence emerged actual source animal market.

Because totalitarian CCP government capabilities reasons prevent evidence fact, recent publications seem cast serious doubt whole hypothesis.

Chinese publications. 43% UK population pre-existing conditions, deserve sacrificed stock gods, frankly. Question(at end) - wife legitimately nervous vaccine that's released year, citing vaccines take years get tested put paces. thinks rushing vaccine could lead potentially serious long-term side effects.

I mentioned they're still appropriately testing vaccine they're using bases previously developed vaccines help speed process. 

**Is validity fear? Could ""warp speed"" vaccines really cause long-term side effects serious? Would really way know without waiting seeing administered?** would imagine early on, virtually rural communities US felt pretty immune. Sunbelt caught fire, hopefully sent message . . . not. Denial strong virus. gives hope United States America: future leaders resemble intelligence, broadness vision spirit humility president.
They make America world whole great again. That's like 70% world countries' respective total cases day. mystery even inside Pakistan numbers going fast. Even prime minister said surprised see fast turn around. doubting numbers, scratching head right. Boldface always show well. Seeing hard. Hopefully, aftermath superspreader event Sturgis help convince no-maskers they’re misguided.

Not cat hell's chance numbers. Anything less 10,000 cases viewed proof no-maskers right nothing worry about. Helps? Possibly. think that's reason (or even one main reasons) we're successful kidding yourself.

As lowest population densities, nope. We're one urbanised countries world. Sure there's large amount nothing people. cities people live. Typically samples patient like would frozen -80C would stable long time. pretty typical freeze samples time collection case something goes wrong need go back re-test. Contact tracing cohort must challenging. I'm also high risk literally set foot property 6 months now. live alone pretty depressing I'm rather desperate contact another human. go online see friends getting drunk parties taking trips Vegas makes feel like went crazy imagining whole thing. actually pisses off, many us making great sacrifices protect others, people, friends family mine, clearly give fuck saving life anyone else's. Yes, disease mostly spread stupidity.

And Sweden stupid all. Australia backing Oxford one. Mind also one development Brisbane - rolled emergency without testing (I recall hearing can't cite source). guess depends many die emergency? (We're around 800 deaths) HIV also family viruses common cold. Massachusetts alone 100 colleges/uni’s. Southern New England NYC/NJ catch fire keeps 😣 Tbf, island land borders help. pretend doesn't. one lowest population densities planet. I'm still fb, never post, scroll front page there, maybe every two months. use messenger keep touch people heavily, though, I'm isolated insanity. wearing masks Misleading title Good job. 


Fucking morons  fear it’s going get much worse flu season officially hits there’s COVID vaccine :( Nice retort. Well thought out, lots solid points.

Fucking idiot. underestimate known-unkown I'm hurry go $9 beer night. feel bad industry rips bank robber prices begin with. Yet still 260, number reported last week. CDC think contagious 10 days? (Might 14 remember top head)  far murderer. You’ve got numbers wrong average, Swede moves nursing home 86 years old median life expectancy since moving 2 years. half die within year moving special virus worst nightmare. American, horse race, pictures videos I've seing online, protesters seem mostly wearing masks, nothing else help little tear gas, crowd Sturgis not. done right would cost people less they're spending right now, increase quality care people, increase health larger percentage population whole. problem greedy people ""I've got mine, screw everyone else"" attitude like that, even though they'd doubtless benefit several ways themselves. thought they'd contributing wellbeing others unacceptable them. Bathrooms small poorly ventilated spaces high numbers people exert themselves. Yes wearing effective mask air gaps washing hands important besides point. recent study often cited right concludes lot Canadians receive medical care care countries. Problem study bother ask went get it, everyone assumed US. makes sense based proximity, put two seconds worth brain power realize average Canadian can't afford US medical care. can't exactly get insurance cover procedure, pretty much surgery US gonna 20k minimum.

A recent study actually covers specific question says 18,000 Canadians surveyed, 20 went US medical care. Germany, health insurance usually pays sick leave away work longer 6 weeks. First 6 weeks employer pays 100% salary, health insurance pays 67% able fully work again. (There're specifics regarding return work step step, 67% basics.) guess ran printers too. reeks BS. Facebook cancer got *from* one facilities know it? /r/aboringdystopia NZ Australia kinda thing fairly similar results. It’s impossible. infant mortality rate US 3 times higher Sweden.

This statistic oft-cited nowhere near straightforward public perception is. difference statistics driven many factors, major one many premature babies low chance survival counted ""born"" United States analysis available OECD data U.S. similarly large wealthy countries finds infant mortality adjusted include infant deaths meet minimum threshold 22 weeks gestation 500g birth weight, U.S. infant mortality rate still higher average comparable countries available data (4.9 vs 2.9 deaths per 1,000 live births). Without adjusting data differences, U.S. infant mortality rate appears 84 percent higher average set comparable countries. 

To clear, factors appear largely socio-economic social, well related non-uniform healthcare access. point person responding to, mean US ""one leading nations medical equipment/general medical infrastructure."" think development would expect mitigations place keep R0 slightly 1 (on average time). difference many other, understand it, Finland didnt huge unknown cluster spread time mitigations put place. Nope, depends narrative. Protesting everyone coughing touching face tear gas OK, outdoor motorcycle rally superspreader event. Oh noo pregnant.

Just fucking stop, someone murderer dont give pregnant. double-facedness Reddit getting disgusting me. BLM protests spread Covid, Sturgis rally did? bs could vaccinate. would help take stupid people. Damage? Certainly. Destroy? places shitty leaderships. Unintentionally infecting someone disease murder. make dramatic. thing happen time. I've always hated it. hated way major companies, universities, basically everything jumped Facebook bandwagon. exposed anyone everyone.  often distance too

Come on. literal pull hundreds pictures people packed shoulder shoulder seems something else wrong understand. question whether insurance paying not, also prices incredibly inflated.

There lot people look hospital bill say thing like ""in US ambulance costs XXX, paid nothing Europe..."". course statement entirely true, course also cost Europe, insurance paid it. Often times pay lot. 

In case COVID-Test know country get either free convince doctor symptoms met somebody - free course means insurance pay. Alternatively pay EUR 120 - symptoms needed (people case need certificate even though symptoms... sometimes companies pay employees). pay privately, insurance involved all, whole price service. precise, public hospital anything like offering service, normal for-profit laboratory business. 

No matter universal healthcare insurance paying not, service cost 100 times US? Apparently monopolies lack competition involved well factors yet understand. trust comes russia mush trust comes North Korea trump's mouth Duh...... course Los Angeles going lot, populated county US. like comparing UK Greenland grounds islands.  Congrats proving point. Every news station biased report stuff goes narrative. Yup, that’s intend use also. I’m actually thinking trading small car in, van. matter. Everyone's recovering.. 70k deaths 6 months ... 4 million infections. Weak virus got nothing us Indians. Honestly, feel like I'm stuck city mentally challenged people rather simply drunk.. Wait minute. find story maybe little suspect. antibody test well know lab 130 dollars. saying US Healthcare wonderful? No. actually understand im paying anything test middle pandemic. story accurate, certainly shows jacked US insurance part Healthcare is. Sounds terrible restricting. Hope manage best can. &lt;3 Sorry, I’ll using public bathrooms going Walmart. Nope!

If odds hit .... well, 68 years old ... ya know .... Wait. bought mine Spain private pharmacy. coste 30$. Exactly. quite months now, crystal clear exactly effective way fight covid. Many countries demonstrated beyond shadow doubt. mystery kill beast. simply it. even try. population stupid immoral, leaders incompetent zero foresight. lazily attempting keep spread going exponential focus propping sham economy. vaccine coming (hopefully), we'd stuck limbo years end. excessive ... seeing there’s deadly contagious virus throughout world.

ONE person takes! portland protests almost everyone was/is masked, were/are tightly packed people front majority protests were/are back bit spaced out, were/are shitloads people squirting hand sanitizer peoples hands whole time. absolutely high risk, many feel purpose justified, precautions implemented probably greatly reduced chance spread, compared protests summer people literally protesting safety measures Sure is:) goes Sweden :) true COVID - 19 one them. Young strong workforce takes vaccine virus 98+% survival rate age group.

Say it’s vaccine helped them

Can’t make folks country 128 mill people, apparently wide spread virus, much less bad numbers personally expected, actually. FVIW. got argument someone ago. told tech company completely ""fine"" parents. someone leave meeting early childcare stuff, one cared. 

I knew bullshit. never employer get pissed someone's parental obligations. know people come close fired missing work take care sick kids. America far family-friendly. dumb idea banned hikes? I'd guess infections Sturgis happened bars restaurants *surrounding* event. went rally brought food probably fine. record, test certificates details country origin testing kits used? Harmless question, implying anything, asking another regime. don’t year wait. People die mental illnesses shit goes another year half. Good! It’s time get rid cult schools. donate American Red Cross many years. got cookie, sticker, free antibody test (negative) good feeling helping someone need.  ""rushed"" vaccines still going three test phases. concerned missing? loophole, someone abuse it. matter whether Americans, Mexicans, Vietnamese, Chinese, Germans, etc.. Given large enough population, going find assholes abuse loophole. 
 
So emphasize **American** family? place blame is, namely people responsibly creating loophole first place? comment higher up. first time explanation this. Here's latest case/death charts Idaho Idaho well compared states. per capita death rate currently 22.05 per 100k population, much better US average 56.54. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* digestive issues, know that. 

Other that, small amount fatigue Populist leaders same, care people adore care people  cheap? lot damage? Could cite source URLs? Except Sweden fared better look economic predictions covid EU compared economic predictions now... 
Sweden predicted one lowest GDP-growt rates EU 2020. [Now prediction Sweden one countries lowest decrease GDP according Turns need put voting booths outside.....or inside Target..... I'm mad. I'm trying show actual evidence counter conjecture.

Influenza mutates far readily coronaviruses do. fact.

However Europe, cases going back up, especially Spain France (UK, Germany Italy seems testing playing bigger role). 

The worrying rise India today first time recorded 90k daily cases showing sign slowing down. expected surpass Brazil officially (if already) probably surpass US month (even though midwest looks worrying, much lower population New York, California, Texas, Florida etc).

I think November-December (around time vaccine may approved), cases still high vast majority (more 50%) coming India everywhere else look better. still vaccine candidate, phase 3 test still progress. candidates approved emergency use.

So small girls like photo quite lol  great breakdown posted infectious disease expert ago, basically transmission asymptomatic/presymptomatic person takes lot virus particles. body ton ""general case"" defenses pretty effective, virus infect certain cells can't find one it'll eventually break down. Generally speaking takes hour's worth close contact asymptomatic/presymptomatic person spread virus (a single cough spread though, wear mask!), virus handle sunlight well requires high concentrations air breathed in. worst case scenario transmission indoors, air still there's sunlight virus concentration air build.

So walk someone who's presymptomatic sidewalk, unlikely even *encountered* COVID particle actually putting many gets dissipated wind within seconds. sitting bar next someone virus watching sports game (so talking yelling), likely breathe enough particles get infected. course, masks help reduce number particles breathe (even mask that's 50% effective halves number virus particles chance finding host) reduce amount distance passive spreader puts - need *right face* breathe any.

This also BLM protests led many infections - mostly wore masks. spreading events like Sturgis rally probably come rally places like bars, hotels, restaurants people sat extended periods time without masks.

In four decades coaching girls’ basketball Lebanon Catholic High School southeastern Pennsylvania, Patti Hower led team three state championships 20 district titles. year, four starting players returning, high hopes again.

But April came news: Roman Catholic Diocese Harrisburg announced school, whose origins date 1859, permanently closing, citing insurmountable financial stress, exacerbated coronavirus pandemic.

“We played last game March postgame talk saying, ‘We’re looking forward upcoming year,’” said Ms. Hower, 68, attended school, like father granddaughters. “We never thought, ‘Hey, we’re never going get court together team.’”

As schools around country debate reopen safely, growing number Catholic schools — already facing declining enrollments donations pandemic — shutting good.

About 150 Catholic schools closed, said Kathy Mears, director National Catholic Educational Association, equal 2 percent 6,183 schools running last year. number closures least 50 percent higher year previous years, Ms. Mears said.

In Boston, archdiocese close nine schools far, two dozen others “watch list,” said Thomas Carroll, superintendent schools Roman Catholic Archdiocese Boston. early July, Archdiocese New York announced would closing 20 Catholic Schools.

As parents families lost jobs pandemic, many could longer pay tuition Catholic schools, even though fees generally much less private schools. churches began shutting curb spread virus, also ended major source donations — would normally allotted parish schools.

For many schools years declining enrollments, coronavirus became mortal strike. “If school financially vulnerable, pandemic thing pushed edge,” Ms. Mears said.

Enrollment Catholic schools United States peaked 5.2 million nationwide early 1960s, according National Catholic Educational Association. percentage practicing Catholics declined across United States, number children enrolling Catholic schools. Enrollment 2019-20 school year 1.7 million.

The closing parochial schools etched profound sense loss among teachers families, face abrupt disappearance spaces long served focal points personal relationships family ties.

The Archdiocese Galveston-Houston reported closure four schools April, saying fallout Covid-19 final blow facilities long struggling meet costs.

“The cataclysmic effects pandemic left us options — breaks hearts,” Cardinal Daniel DiNardo said statement.

One schools, St. Francis Assisi, severely damaged Hurricane Harvey 2017, community members worked hard support rebuilding efforts welcome students back fall 2018, said Sharita Palmer Mayo, whose two sons attended school. Less two years later, closure forced families look elsewhere schooling again.

“We literally like built little family there,” Ms. Palmer Mayo said. “I love school.”

Among best-known Catholic schools shutting doors Institute Notre Dame, renowned all-girls facility founded Baltimore 1847. School leaders said school deeply debt facing 43 percent enrollment decline past five years. letter noted coronavirus “caused significant, added financial hardship.”

Prominent alumni include House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, former Democratic senator Maryland, Barbara A. Mikulski.

“It painful everybody,” said Sister Patricia Murphy, chair board trustees school. Ms. Murphy part School Sisters Notre Dame, congregation sisters sponsor Institute Notre Dame. added believed decision close school necessary one.

Ms. Murphy graduated school 1962 said education friendships forged would forever stay close heart. “My classmates Zoom every week,” noted interview.

After graduating, Ms. Murphy attended public teachers’ college. told male dean college wanted high school history teacher, responded: “‘What would little thing like want for? wouldn’t want elementary schoolteacher?’”

But Ms. Murphy wouldn’t stand education Institute Notre Dame, said. “I stunned,” said, still went become high school history teacher.

At Notre Dame, girls “got really good sense women could do,” Ms. Murphy said.

Still, alumni fighting keep school open, upset school leaders, including School Sisters Notre Dame, haven’t pushed harder avoid closure. Drena Fertetta, alumnus graduated Notre Dame 1983, began group called Saving IND Inc., dedicated reopening school next year, perhaps different site.

“There sisterhood happens girls go school,” Ms. Fertetta said. “It’s something we’re willing walk away from.”

For Isabel Romero, supposed complete senior year Institute Notre Dame, news closure devastating, particularly since looking forward special senior year traditions. graduation, girls dress identical white gowns, holding dozen long-stemmed red roses, custom alums students hold dear.

“There times reality sets it’s like, ‘Oh, wont going next year,’ start cry again,” Ms. Romero, 17, said. swedes hard time accepting failed hard seen scum earth places?

 Politicians morons. “Cold” lol Chinese tourists tested early February, one virus.

The first cases found later spring (it already secretly spread everywhere) Finns traveled Austria Italy. remember one Italian thought blaming Italy, intention.

The death organized religion best possible outcome entire virus. Civility something they've paid into, get none. Without proper contact tracing, never truly know. want know either way. big deal, largest test spreading virus since lock down. Definitely larger wedding, funeral business meeting. generate huge spike cases, explaining needs done. doubt Trump needs go. Lol. Must nice love fantasy land vaccine passed phase 3 testing.

This literally insurance works, except profit part, drive deny claims. Lmao needs see professional therapist cope fact everything safe within year. Honestly fallout people's mental healths bad actual pandemic. taste me. people know thought would done June. even fall yet. 

Stay strong 🇬🇧 Many started care lockdowns hundreds thousands protesting weeks throughout country. Along little condemnation healthcare workers, even supported protested them, pandemic claim affects most.

But guess past past since claims none protests led outbreaks. it’s everybody thought singer kidding said wasn’t sharpest tool shed. we’re coming terms reality Yes! Thank pointing out. 

That little nuance often lost sub. B U L L Thanks making comment big could read it.

Can tell rest comments say? what? 

The bottom line hope you’re also anarchist prepared, otherwise we’re gonna really bad time theory turns true.  Wait what’s going happen? vaccine? 

And I’m mentally unwell, believe science don’t believe pseudoscience fear mongering.... soooo belong sub not? Lol $40,000 honeymoon?!?! Details! 

I one 1/6 ridiculous lavish experience life. go? contract tracers asking people gone weddings, protests? think CNN access millions photos covid could use better representation avoid? BLM charged well? Need see your, likely double, standards lay. Good call. I’ll get halberd. good source.

Let’s see. pandemic already raging March.  feebly started tracing June. even get enough reliable tests? nobody even remember tests, ones defective didn’t enough. didn’t WANT recorded tracked cases, stated plainly repeatedly. Wake get real. Please go therapy. people please stop planning fucking wedding fucking pandemic already? people realize virus still around world? fucking hard postpone wedding? Classic America..... TIL ""VM"" also mean voice mail. puzzle one while. city many others people gathering bars restaurants caused majority outbreaks summer. Where’s outrage that?

Either people gathering together spreads virus doesn't. can't ways know people seem politically-driven try to. *pulls lysol* Yeah well that’s basically Staten Island anyway, kinda figured... that’s Marxism!!!! Bad Socialist! ‘Murica first! No, roadblocks external actual testing process. approved means experts deemed safe. 

Honestly everyone anti science sudden? different time - one two weeks earlier Stockholm region. Yeah, happen. She'd quarantine living office, avoiding fiance 2 weeks.

I'll wear mask home 2 weeks. friend getting married booked venue 2 years advance that’s far it’s booked refusing let push date back without fees. Like there’s way place struggles money yet owners see opportunity make even more. Kinda sick tbh /r/redditmademerightwing Tell protesters rioters lmfao Hospitals full, capacity since lot doctors nurses sick ""I understand enough explain either, youtube vague understanding like me""* translated Okay whatever think necessary protect yourself. whatever necessary protect myself, definitely lot less. can’t leave that? must life canceled somebody else? bound happen clueless Government have. Yeah, it’s rough time.

I’m EE. semester supposed senior design project. We’re remotely, professor mailing us parts we’ll build home, mail back.

Last semester, robotics lab. mess remotely, well computer architecture. oUtDoOrS would _look_ selfish. can't that!  try everyone think best? people wear masks. Others wear masks, cover noses? others wear masks go events large crowds? could also states take varying approaches. governors say public health important economy. Others listen business community throw 300,000+ motorcycle rally despite 60% town wanting cancel event. Vroom, vroom capitalism!

The approach used reporting covid statistics. country founded free speech individual rights. cohesive plan covid would undermine foundation American sensibility. Unity socialism! know vaccine available. Here's good summary US states ranked per capita weekly deaths. Shows hot zones they're want avoid Mississippi. completely different scenario globally. Everybody stopped working anything else focus virus. Unprecedented money/resources available would otherwise 'non-pandemic' situation. Things move much faster result. **Would hostage ego host God?**  Yeah, let’s take systems worldwide haven’t ever proven accurate tabulating cause deaths layer top conjecture excess deaths. somebody explain dangerous COVID actually is? Im assuming now, cant tell overhyped underhyped. personal friends, heard many hospitals virtually empty covid patients. everybody know covid symptoms all. BLM protests didnt cause noticable spike covid cases according healthline. know almost entirely asymptomatic, dont enough tests, sick ppl realize, doesnt suggest also way safer realize? weak danger too. covid special? ppl treat covid influenza influenza clearly much worse? seems convenient common cold cuz time u literally cant even tell u covid. marriage lasted 20+ years, thought 100 different ways could spent money. Fortunately, pretty broke begin with. normal circumstances, yes. world hasn’t seen virus quite like last hundred years, current technology, along hundreds millions doses already production, it’s likely fully distributed early next year. would uncivilized point preventable. didnt know reading may time see doctor. related? Pretty sure in-laws. ask us stuff that’s almost hilariously dangerous given current spread it. going happen. Please visit sub, pseudo science fear mongering people mentally unwell. Also helps complete control populace literally weld people homes don’t comply

Which honestly, could’ve use little make feel like crap let them. need turn around guilt mind make self-righteous anger selfishness. know easy lot people way raised, moment say ""I'm adult and,frankly, older mean right.""

It's one great discoveries adulthood: knowing adults knew life looked actually morons listen anymore. Beaumont TX area here, sympathize. COVID response absolute joke. make matters worse, mandatory evacuation Hurricane Laura, imagine evacuations hotels shelters, recovery efforts widespread power outages Satan's Blistering Anus portion summer, expect pretty big spike around soon. correlation protesters cases protests could make sense, *negative* correlation? Clearly something else afoot here.

Could states largest protests also states got hit earliest hardest, thus level herd immunity time protests came around? Well, no. I’m traditional student already duplex SO. I’m also early 30s.

We tenant downstairs, passive income, stable career.

Just uncertain long take get market all. shortage jobs field, I’m sure interviewing, boarding, training, etc going look like everything remote right now.

Just uneasy time. Apparently so, bet ass buy *anyone* damn thing decline attend.

Fuck outta sending gift wedding even go to. saved money blew party buy shit wanted first place. /r/sino members CCP shills concept local autonomy. would even control though? questionnaire testing facilities country asking attended specific wedding refuse test you? people attended wedding conspiring government refuse get tested want hurt emperor? No? I've following excess deaths US since seems pretty apolitical, counting death certificates, kind evens miscounts me. behind much? used week behind last update Aug 22nd. Looks like trending back normal second bump. It’s already September duhh.. Organised religion human animal built civilisation. child taught traditions religion get worked it, kinda wonder feel children taught wash hands 😊 Right, I'm ""nitpicking"", clearly understand original comment's point, condescendingly told understand. I'm conservative, I'm glad response something resort brainless tribalism. Florida improving however. Here's latest case/death terms per capita deaths, they're 55.30 per 100k. That's US national average.

Florida 5th overall Hot Zone rankings, rate failed omit it, would included. don’t seem understand words using. almost like time spent pretending weddings important day person's life giant industry meant make money turning 'love' event profit lead us here... Found person shitty wedding lol Therapy please lol. Yep, we're due 5 weeks, making family due thing. Negative tests required, drive fly. Also, masks. Always.  ultimately choosing this. feels little disingenuous placing blame choosing work. I'm already chronically ill. Going pass one, chief.

I think already back December, though, obviously I'll never know. Never forget, percentage statistic real people real lives families. stat translates 188k deaths US. I’ll never forget selfish fellow Americans refusing participate prevention loss lives. wear damn mask stay home, ya nasties forgot persisted symptoms, recovery. bad severe... briefing give office Fox News tv reception area shut work ignore Locking indoors made depressed. need regular social interaction start go nuts. Virtual interaction doesn’t nearly scratch itch. don’t understand. saying people deeply care wedding, responsibility attendance (even obligation) attendees? sure mean. Nah misunderstand completely. 

I’m talking mental health. 

I’m talking governance epidemiology whole. keeping even best minded people course whole year lose control early.

I’m talking psychology managing societies mood whole. individual mental health. That’s different discussion. It’s practical crossing fingers stupidly assuming everyone encounter 100% perfect behavior. Stay home coughing sneezing everywhere uncontrollably; otherwise... Wear mask. Wash hands. Keep distance. hard. played game couple months ago NY, NJ, CT came peaks. People saying ""lOoK eVErYtHiNg FiNe NoW!"" Texas, Florida, Arizona started take off. 

National trends meaningless country 50 completely different responses COVID-19. I’m asking name business shuttered reopened bars. Want America get better?! dead body, lib! crazy..the amount get togethers seeing people wearing masks. Weddings, BLM protests, parties. Damn, stand corrected. thought case. Thanks setting straight test dead once. waste. big companies located basement Holland tax purposes. Sadly get ""small business"" bailouts result Surely alcohol large profit margin, mention governments make almost $10 billion sale taxes. thinking might Taiwan lax test standards. Well always whatever want call party later formal informal want. Europe well, reopen summer tourist trade. Oh ok. get $1 year ago. week got mine kids doctor (we went it) ended $25 me. /r/weddingdrama  completely relevant conversation though.  person originally replied said “you idea likely die get it”.


Why people jump hoops denounce simple factual response? That’s least it. Job uncertainty tied health insurance raging global pandemic ? could give shit seeing friends, it’s idea trip hospital could bankrupt even get sick I’m laid off. Otherwise hospital stabilize kick see all. Kids back school since last week they're 11 dont wear masks. every shop mask mandatory.
In street simple: cities mask mandatory not. not, dont expect see many people mask.
Restaurants bars full people close masks. fuck given. Winter coming i'm expecting get worse. Here’s example activities ranked risk (some include revenue-generating business) created Texas Medical addition, essentially business partake wearing mask going magnitudes less risky going bar, ranked absolute highest risk level. You’ll okay America many years, pandemic exposing it. baby way make $1400 month pay bills, gas, groceries. would great allowed stay home still make $1400 month. You’re welcome. way species make virus many small acts compassion every day. Good luck family. 

(And also vaccine...) Walgreens $40 flu shot. That's charged last year. notice too. infuriating. purchase 300 million doses it, use without US based phase 3 trial. started month least 1-2 months behind pfiezer Moderna. last week 😊 Best decision ever, feelings hurt invited etc. 2 witnesses went fancy meal. Really great day think exactly it. hope someone knew fuck somehow make things better proven fool's hope.

Eventually, plague end things go back normal. we've seen behind curtain now. Labcorp....google labcorp antibody test lot rural people never left hometown. Urban culture seems foreign different causes fear anxiety. Also city life usually $$ might make people self conscious. Also propaganda makes many believe every city folk crazy liberal. Meanwhile love fish shoot guns like Rambo Bassmaster. Also probably educational. 

On side coin met incredibly smart, funny, earth humble people areas. black white Yep, I'm that. Thankfully N95s easy come am, thank you. know South Korea I'm glad mentioned it. horrible also good know workers could safe environment. appreciate mentioning it. Omg I'm sorry. 😟 Shut military. Months ago would hard believe social media alone fulfilling public's need social interaction. Protesting form gathering. Beachgoing less form gathering. correlation protesting covid surges. Thus, logically speaking, correlation beachgoing covid surges. I'm sorry someone pissed cheerios.

No, really follow. found correlation one thing, can't assume always same.  literally made argument based density heard common sense?

yes neither evidence source. indeed make numbers rationale. mean, kind was.

No wasn't. never mentioned density people study all.

You either still read article continue run mouth deliberately misrepresenting. cousins currently getting together camping southern MN, masks, social distancing, 1 cancer. care. It’s imported case quarantining anyway don’t see problem. possible explanations? Younger population, different exposure bugs leading immunity, mask policies, treatment effectiveness, etc? data realm possibility.

For instance saw Reddit post last week widespread distribution pulse oximeters home-based patients India. let doctors remotely monitor people's SpO2 know treat hospital. work something entirely different get contribute things like ""we that. would SUPER illegal"". people illegal stuff, cam report. worst enemy. failure, it? death total much higher neighbours. Low obesity rate. Africa also low death rates.  Yep, get every year usually. Skipping year. impossible catch flu way I’m currently living life. danger catching Covid waiting line Target wherever would concern, I’d catch flu magic shit. that’s thing, there’s never adenovirus vaccine approved use humans. one use wild animals (a rabies vaccine). virus knows justified not? Damn  I've never related statement more.
This exactly sentiment bosses. sheer level ignorance go Covid meetings go to, listen Epidemiologists still decide 'it's bad' infuriates me. work health field really showing (lack of) character caring themselves.

Even impact old people, would want everything possible stop transmission kill one elders? kind partying weekends wait. Always remember, ""freeDUMBS."" can’t risk *slight* chance long term effects favor saving poor people third world countries starving higher rates, increase joblessness eventually poverty western countries lead death; still selfless point? I’m asking enough, since apparently don’t know enough (I disagree), I’m saying it’s already late terms overall damage lockdowns caused lesser privileged. appreciate continuing chat; don’t think I’m page this. watch. death rate going tick up, government say everything fine, late accept scale crisis. forget Halloween parties, Winter, others holiday celebrations. projection. Acting tough calling others out. Truth terrified. weird culture lol BLM right Hey dude, get take much help out, science science. don’t die this, may give others 

It ain’t worth pad thai. sympathize waitresses cooks owners life isn’t fair virus doesn’t discriminate.

YOU would probably feel differently got sick knew someone died virus numbers Florida going rapidly final stretch election. Coincidence?

Methinks not. self-righteous debunk disinformation, it. Fact is, whether like not, rescue success rate depends person dog. screen people carefully care going receiving animals.

Yes, able happy dog apartment /does/ depend great many factors. screening stringent. Adoptions successful remove factors.

Having yard takes one major obstacle: makes convenient allow dog washroom breaks. lazy asshole open door. Dogs hold business long get medical issues, may learn relieve inside house.

The next question whether dog left alone many hours itself. Dogs left alone get lonely, leading stress potentially destructive behaviours. Leaving kennel 8 hours every day solution.

When pet stores breeders sell dogs anyone comes street, questions asked, happens many dogs end people care dogs much. let regular washroom breaks? learn shit house. Leave alone day? learn rip furniture fun. great owner begin with, people want deal issues. dogs end pound, end rescues. Volunteers spend lots time trying train dogs learned bad behaviours. effort, would want throw dogs back awful environments? problems occur, dog ends returned system again.

It much efficient careful screening adopt animals homes higher likelihood success. Bummer meet standards (but surprising). good knock Darwin. Time thin herd. count people depressed longer are? introvert through. deal society personally daily basis improved mood health tremendously.

Not good getting depressed now. wish best, improve coming months vaccine way.

But entire life live extreme anxiety approach people irl. People understand side it, think recluse rude. I'll forced go back real life confront everyone everyone else feeling better, I'll go back shithole life. I’m exactly sure works major ppe shortages, doesn’t make sense always larger gloves, since large gloves provide protection people large small hands, small gloves provide protection smaller hands people would isolate amongst infect innocent family members, friends, public, I'd say good- got deserved. many RNA vaccines ever approved human use? 

Good thing non rna vaccine candidates likely approved later think healthcare free United States?

I assumed even Americans charge vaccine ultimately makes money world returns normal learned protests, social distancing seem problem mask. far tell single ticket given out, theories is? get lesser extent rural parts New England Boston. deserves Reddit Bronze. sound like miserable person honestly feel bad you

Do like, friends something? one would want go wedding? Kinda weird bro. Democracy great things good, life death situation, wartime people need told do, given options suggestions left whatever want. There's reason soldiers treated talked are, that's shit needs get done. Thank God. Last heard practically cases suspect problem largely work out. first distributions limited targeted (probably healthcare workers). probably take months longer there's enough distribute widely general public. time, we'll able look first mass vaccinated cohorts reassurance. They'll retro actively modify past data information way off. 50k less deaths massive amount. could say simply testing dead properly, makes wonder true numbers look like. They'll passing United States I'm sure months infections might ever know simply testing confirming deaths properly. Mexico says 122,765 extra people died pandemic 'excess deaths' bad...pretty accurate....even lower # excess deaths. September over! hope divorce bitter. every morning takes exact change 1 2 fast food breakfasts eats daily. affect people immediate contact with. Let's say go wedding get asymptomatic covid-19 infection. go McDonald's order hamburger get employee sick. employee still lives parents makes minimum wage, die. Similar things happened. infection potentially lead hundreds several steps line. dozens people dead wedding.

Here's example days ago Maine. wedding led 147 cases 3 deaths, ones died even attend wedding. 180,000 Americans dead. put perspective, 58,000 Americans died Vietnam, 53,000 died World War I. need take seriously. turns took little seriously ended postponing weddings necessary, think that's still good trade. many states adult entertainers eligible covid unemployment encouraged risk group. hokey pokey first dance. posted article morning got deleted... subreddit always confuses me. could hard it, United States. America lost want mindduck, look Qatar’s per 100k data. testing severe symptomatic cases get numbers like these, testing everybody get numbers like Qatar Singapore, mortality well 1% still tested UK. time think would get enough data UK alone expanded Brazil South Africa. also started trials U.S. Idiots Taiwan also small, developed Island Nation, definitely helps. 

Early on, shared language cultural aspects China helped early on, well prior preparations outbreaks. also study US? enough cases, no? total infected around 0.5-1% MN (by extrapolating minnesota total infection rate total recovered), probably 1-3 people initially infected wedding.


So 1-3 people caused 56/275 = ~20% people infected within 1 hour (or 3-5 reception).

Hell superspreaders. also told back March wear masks, save healthcare workers, without alternatives.

CDC also recommended fourteen days declining cases reopening, one two states followed. like people majored business? Happy recently engaged friends already planning 2022 wedding. then, ideally, we're dead able party appropriately. Yes. short make number higher. 

We know high politicized.  Canadian winter one long, endless blizzard? Clearly Trumps fault saying number states covid increasing increasing eventually lead national increase daily covid cases (assuming trend continues) agree you. read one study.

The selection though problem. Even one quoted say randomly tested people, even ask people ""sign up"".

Guess who's likely sign test ? People suspect virus. 

So there's already selection bias, antibody rates find test group replicated population large.

In order study relevant, need people randomly selected, volunteers.   K. truth. people getting sick really recovering. They’re losing limbs, strokes attendant complications, experiencing heart, lung kidney damage one knows going happen long term. friend mine, nurse, ran Boston Marathon last year. got COVID April still needs supplemental oxygen, sleeps den can’t climb stairs bedroom gets exhausted two minute conversation. possible outcomes aren’t recovery death. allowed 275? break law? Lol assuming little cunt are. bud, good luck you. Bingo. ""But want it"". Entitled idiots.  Well said. gotten weird feeling.  You’re correct Take out, online/phone ordering door service; maybe switching restaurant trucks go customers? That's way see working. Two week shits going blow big time!*

*repeated every week past 6 months. blow ups believe fictional trash that's religious texts. Every state increasing daily cases point. see relevant current situation 22 states increasing daily cases 28 not. postpone wedding. planning October however closer get restrictions changed point want. could live masks, totally fine, entirely indoor venue ceremony reception outdoors? reception cannot dancing?.... thanks. We're trying next October. I'm really hoping better control then...

If took time read Please Vote November. Herd immunity effect. Masks work states use them. retort would ""exactly, want live like forever. sacrifice year may back normal (being optimistic), don't, like forever. seen states?"" ""noticeable soon"" like , six months now. Please. one responded kinda makes laugh. bunch people commenting headline article read. courthouse partner weeks ago! paying much health insurance, realized medical rights bf/gf. Super simple, 3 day waiting period, contact exactly one person, set! kind wish able direct family around, want risk neck. 

My sibling getting married 60+ people next weekend, though... yeah, I've already cancelled. safe... potential reduced. People beed learn mitigation risk elimination risk. better planned. 

It best practices ignored, denied. Miscellaneous States America. postpone wedding. planning October however closer get restrictions changed point want. could live masks, totally fine, entirely indoor venue ceremony reception outdoors? reception cannot dancing?.... thanks. We're trying next October. I'm really hoping better control then...

If took time read Please Vote November. stop AIDS argument? has, example, never really taken (central Europe) thus quite easy imagine, could present somewhere long time cause visible issues, something indeed observe. happened anywhere covid-19. fact handful infected people enough turn country outbreak clearly shows simply could circulated anywhere undetected. almost sense disappointment tone headline. Sounds right - pretty much everyone know dealt chronic low feelings past months.

I got hit really bad bout depression January slowly getting better, harder climb compared previous episodes. share someone I'm dealing that, always feel need say ""no, no, depressed covid"" like kind sadness hipster lol  Pretty much, would prefer correct. either way woukd shocked see major move towards normality next spring. hope vaccine rolls fast enough avoid bloody winter heading towards pitiful fines enough. Gotta start making example types people. exactly we're too! moms pretty upset, saying things like ""You pictures look back on"". cares?! I'd rather husband, friends, families healthy many years. Besides, we'll memories pictures things like kids, vacations, honeymoon, etc.

Once bring babies, sudden get it. Jokes them, still going years head direction haha Exactly. It’s infinitely better small businesses get fucking giant corporations commit fraud dumping stocks crash accepting bailout money buy back much lower price. can’t compare US Sweden. Sweden densely populated. NYC residents Sweden.

Also, US massive health crisis heart disease, stroke, mental illness (just look public freakouts). 

The US zero plan organized. leaders stood up, lead kept virus levels low. Others played politics, others don’t care. talking ass brother. Mexican food based corn, beans rice. Healthy fuck.

The problem stems junk food sugary drinks ridiculously cheap brought questionable northamerican ""free"" trade deals. 

In areas Coca-Cola cheaper water. bro got married two weeks ago. Back February asked best man, really want begin good answer said I'd think would probably say yes... well couple weeks later called said want wedding party.

Glad bailed did. go wedding either. 

I really point here, sharing. Look pdf near bottom. plenty families pretty much end getting it. people live together mean they're close enough contact every day infect other. Family dynamics schedules greatly attribute lack infection people took warnings seriously infected family members isolate within house. fiance planning go courthouse get married. us two. We'll hopefully big party time past us. want married difficult time. can't deal stress trying plan wedding right now. Plus feels rebellious secret courthouse wedding even though we're 30s. Yeah bit disheartening see comments. getting married next month working hard keep safe. Moved outdoors, asking everyone wear masks, quarantining before. us way completely postpone without taking huge financial hit. also offering virtual ceremony people don’t feel comfortable attending opt instead. expect 50-60. Reading thread you’d think awful people. FL, GA, TX hospitals never got overwhelmed people allowed leave houses enjoy life people NY, MA, PA, CT, RI, CA did. Thank kind redditor. exactly wrong. thought rushing testing trials etc. scientific process producing safe vaccine Covid-19 rushed. I’ve learned wrong. They’re rushing legalities, time testing trials, investments (like said). 

So learned something new today also lowered anxieties. don’t learn (some things) without asking questions open-minded discussion all. everyone tries avoid virus end spikes. trying avoid spikes means need consistent linear infection rate. wedding couple hundred cases... something like 9 deaths. (All died association people went wedding.). consent. can't wanted to. Naw they’ll get drunk Jibber they’ll like it. wedding planned Oct 30th since last year. Around 50 guests invited/going attend. OBVIOUSLY there's global pandemic going we're lol. gonna courthouse me, moms. We'll make official date reception next year (hopefully) shit calms down. hard lol. people selfish putting lives risk. Karen's Kevin's world seem care covid-19 directly affects them. 🤬 quote comes mother-in-law works emergency physician. estimate false negative rate 25% Ah see point. think we're talking semantics difference couple months general consensus. like mutations uniformly negative humans, virus spread much would killing us fast. absolutely horrific. Now, available schools state sponsored iPads Zoom. learn 72 genders society live n benefits whites white give allowance POC. literally moving dystopian future. Without diversity opinions, homogeneous state sponsored rhetoric. thinking ""good riddance, get rid Catholic indoctrination"". trading monolithic indoctrination.  preppers stop talking FL, GA, TX hospitals going overwhelmed listened experts hospitals never got overwhelmed numbers going down.

Here club scene ATL last weekend nobody really cares COVID numbers still going Apparently parts Norway late Stockholm. Fylke apparently. Thank honest. I’m sure tough figure out. need say wasn’t ok, sake, sake, sake situation. time effort put explaining preparations made, risk family took, finally, understanding really wasn’t good idea. It’s discussion anyone reading comments now. setting standard others kids. way first comment went was, opinion, setting horrible standard people act pandemic. least honest it’s worth, matters me. said, never say ok did. one make tough decisions...... haven’t seen many family much risk since March. able start Masters year complications travel risk. brother Spain stuck 5 months started new job week shutdown there. People suffering. ask don’t add it, do, recognize behavior call is. real like last comment. That’s ask people reading making minds do. It’s putting fear us understanding decision bring lots people differing locations absolutly effects people could kill people (weather know not, god forbid someone group asymptomatic passes virus someone risk.) never agree decision, respect understand wrong apply moving forward. isn’t say it’s ok. damage already done idiot. Facts past 6 months say pandemic often framed terms striking balance protecting people’s health protecting economy. assumption countries face trade-off two objectives. assumption preliminary way answering question look health economic impacts pandemic compare different countries far. countries lower death rates seen larger COVID-19 death rate latest GDP data, fact see opposite: countries managed protect population’s health pandemic generally also protected economy Yep. Flatten curve. turn get infected get infected take bed others need later turn comes up. long orderly planned fashion unnecessary deaths situations like Italy experienced. Yup! seen several teachers Facebook saying they’re scared back school, yet it’s (implied) ok put hairdressers, restaurant staff, &amp; dental staff risk go places. 

To entirely fair, really perfect equivalency. 

- Restaurants minimal meaningful face-to-face contact begin outside taking delivering order. Servers/cooks/etc given ample opportunity social distance sanitize

- hairdressers usually fairly quick experiences clearly shown parties wearing masks makes threat virtually nonexistent

- dental staff also given ample opportunities proper sanitization, though seen studies one

Being school kids packed together hours time masking unlikely enforced different story. felt ""obligated"". inability say people getting pissy society real.

Me... I've learned""no"" means need crap want bend interractions want anyway.

Oh person want talk to....i said ""no"" pissed talk me....win win. “Unlikely, impossible” isn’t really raising false hopes. It’s pretty strong negative.  

Way pick chose quotes support narrative. Weddings embarrassing anyway.  Hope covid people recover though!! said driving 15 hours!?? I’ll lucky make 6-7 hours day! LOL! Hopefully hosts fined shit even given jail time takes everyone working together get rid rona completely agree, think functionally pandemic end next spring high risk groups vaccinated.

My point would surprised low risk groups get offered phase 3 trials complete. like say group asymptomatic, suffer mild symptoms. threat hospitals overrun evaporates, things like social distancing largely removed next year summer even without group vaccinated. “Vatican gossip worse COVID”. 

Thank setting priorities straight Pope Francis. Exactly! would say going skiing sports break tradition lot Swedish families. family always siblings kids 80’s 90’s. Going alps instead Swedish mountains newer trend though, anecdotally probably common people bigger cities incomes higher. then, original 28 states rise cases? logic, order 28 states rising cases, states/locations falling cases. many deaths? seem like US even cares cases anymore, deaths matter. brother willing put family (and everyone else involved) risk wedding, want continue relationship him? you? start college shaming way shame people get married pandemic? Imagine selfish one go college right now. stay home one year like rich brats do. gets isn’t even discussed. started state indicator. noted indicator trends downwards. Fairly cheap too, similar dexamethasone IIRC. couple orders magnitude cheaper remdesivir nurse...I'm baffled. hope quarantines two weeks wind going give patients. Spain's 7 day moving average 58 deaths/daily, 2 mid July. Yeah invites outright taunting...passive aggressive comments...the

""Really guys done anything social since beginning this?"" (As talking phone video calls social all.). (my Father met wife online mother passed (elderly people)....even can't seem grasp still socialize distancing... literally together meeting online)

Weddings...etc. they're selfish. could married..
Private socially distance justice peace thing....but whole dog pony show. they'll complain expensive 90% (not drunks want open bar) complain something go.... parking...being tired... buying dress... whatever always something. Hell wife tailgate wedding NFL (Bills) game. idea. based someone wedding couple stressed (we weren't) cost insane (not even including tickets everyone) guests say someone know day ""I've got damned wedding go tomorrow"" knew back February national leaders choose anything

Well, **tactics** (some quick moves moment) **strategy** (a long-term coherent plan). really small town, there's lot do. law school leave much time anything except study. partied whole lot. whole lot... There's nice Law students pharmacy students ride local shuttle bus free, living perks! 😆 See California. AIDS spread worldwide too.
Or see Spanish Flu, spread across Europe widely. recent example, see [2009 Swine emerged Asia originates Mexico/the US. Similar situation wedding Maine. 3 deaths far. Nobody seems taking pandemic seriously. lol 80% people food security means 20% food insecure. think getting there. Excess death conjecture. science. people quarantined, almost excess death attributed COVID, top compensating lack traffic deaths. Hopefully figure virus soon.. blatant lie hilarious. Also masks nearly useless without social distancing according Dr. Fauci. amazing covid spread protests riots. Yet spreads event crowds. 2nd wave definitely partially result protests. Ironically black lives lost result spread corona protests corrupt cops. sub does. It’s hard distinguish nutcase sarcasm. much difference. don’t make gift expensive one. Buy kitchen towels cookie sheet, send “family recipes” nice card. Boom, less $20. Done. Fuckin bots. conducted antibodies studies. supposed start last month maybe this, planning whole pandemic Mexico terrible say least. 

On top that, Secretariat Health approve rapid tests they're reliable enough Federal Commission Protection Sanitary Risk already approved around 8 commercial kits public use.

With kind contradictions likely require external party (i. e. Foreign researchers journalist) helps estimate extent contagion deaths related Coronavirus. Remember uncle jack also went wedding wear mask? walk room patient fine ... reality isn’t ... sitting talking me... reality slowly dying ... scares us .... O2 low 70s meaning needs help ... exhibits signs distress ..... ""fouling up"" intentional. crimson party US complains one China cooking books, reality hidden 10 times deaths China had. Yeah, places US really suck testing right now, others great. got notification last night covid detected waste water lab building. gave date time range said used bathroom day go get tested. Since University good hospital system able schedule test today, plenty appointments available. Heck, people testing place looked bored. 

When got tested couple weeks ago got results back 8 hours later. claim 24-48 hour turnaround, far everyone lab gotten tested got results back 12-24 hours, mostly depending time day got tested. Morning generally means day results. Poland population: 38.5 million 
Belgium population: 11.46 million 
US population: 331 Million.

The price give everyone us free healthcare absurd. That's number account undocumented population well. Also recent number could find doctors us 1.1 million us. Medicare would cost us 28-32 Trillion decade. Also taxing rich would literally cause leave us place less taxes. Also taxes would raised everyone richest. top 1% already contribute 37.3% income tax. bottom 90% contributed 30.5% Income came say Maybe ... That's kept blood samples , though lockdowns .. still seems sketchy Like reddit. 998,000 little 100% correct. really understand we're this. What? Throwing clot ... get ... patient would showing signs ..... scary don’t know social distancing pointless? 190,000+ people died? Sounds like clickbait article me. ran certificates ordered more. normal preparation increased deaths? go date. ... Dude.

I...I can't anymore.

Either dense get it, purposely ignoring reality.

Whatever man, enjoy. Three people died. None wedding attendees. 

It saddening group's irresponsible decision devastating effects community. Escort alaskan border $1mil fine ban entry canada. Problem solved ThOuGht meDiA GoiNg StoP tAlkInG CoRona NoV 4Th?! expect certain point short breath exhibit signs body trying get air ie oxygen ... don’t .... gave social distancing May realized pointless.

I'm law's house now. went shooting shotguns went bar. masks, distancing. 

Handshakes, hugs, etc. took 12 year old son ER CT said ""he's child treated Children's Hospital across street"".

The bill $3,000. children's hospital, gave great care hours charged $1,100.

After basically calling CEO Hartford Healthcare website review primary care physician, got call reduced $600 - NOTHING.

Stories like surprise me. get sickened see fund raisers cancer patients. Yet dumb working-class republicans watch Fox News say ""I got mine"" ""pull bootstraps"" vote interests, like European-style healthcare. Ugh! Unfortunately--and say someone who's sitting *lot* school board meetings--outside class masks *just* anathema lot want regular school virtual school is. cannot tell many parents *screaming* upset child's return school going marked mostly wearing masks, social distancing, and--in general--having abnormal school year one could whilst still attending physical school. opposed stay-at-home *also* vehemently opposed anything school appeared 2019. would put roughly equal US, figures 200k excess deaths correct. That's despite 1/3 US's population. would also make deaths per capita twice high Belgium's.

Brazil one might end highest number. done recently found excess deaths one state twice high official covid deaths (it also found 40% antibodies IFR 0.24% excess deaths assumed covid). what's happening happening nationwide, would mean 250k deaths (however, believe state question one poorest, official figures places like Sao Paulo might accurate). fuck you! brain give fuck o2 saturation enough blood pumped head. Covid attacks heart  needed scary ... anyway healthcare worker Oh boy. idea disincentivize breeders creating animals, already plenty animals need good homes. Millions cats dogs euthanized year aren’t adopted. need create more. breeders can’t make money one buys animals (because people adopt shelters instead), eventually stop breeding animals, help reduce suffering. he's capitalist strong passion stock markets. Ain't way *anybody* that's raised like pull trigger. China caused problem -- causing SARS1 less 20 years ago. Excuse us upset totalitarian dictatorship continuing plague world virus virus. can't China learn Japan's excellent hygiene food standards? close China, different! Mexico also one worst testing rates Latin America, makes containment strategies (test, trace, isolate)  nearly impossible. also magnified apparent CFR due staggering amount undetected cases agree ... covid patients freaking fine ... asymptomatic hypoxia trust gut instinct anecdotes conservative political commentary say research subject. think working pennies instills good work ethic eventual trade education little cost.

People deal drugs risk lives pays well. gang owns territory, monopoly drug supply raise prices. take gang take territory gangs, that's territory sell drugs premium competition price.

That guy work foot locker makes much money selling drugs. title stating fact.  


It ""dig"" Trump. dealing empirical facts situation.  


Just read article. concerns me... testing, contact tracing, treatment rolled successfully, would vaccine different? disconnected private health care systems capable working together functioning federal public health department. I’m sure usually last day ( 3 4 would patient I’m scared recover ...... not). You’re like guy math problem incorrectly still managed get right answer. China respect basic human rights. New Zealand's lockdown nothing like horror show Wuhan people locked inside apartments dragged ""fever clinics."" thing China totalitarian dictatorship respect human rights New Zealand one world's best democracies. Fit headline. poorer countries better Mexico don’t count, right? Can’t point go “Hahaha. Stupid fucking Mexico, can’t even better countries!”

Because you’re full shit nothing factors everything hating US glorifying death it’s “right” political targets. sub shithole.  India's large population biggest factor posting huge numbers. Worldometers say still 51 deaths per million people, USA Brazil nearing 600. Even state lowest deaths per capita - Alaska - 57.

I also looked Indian data. definitely large regional variations. Maharashtra still biggest number cases deaths, likely attributable Mumbai. badly infected Indian states south, presume due higher level economic development. Somewhat surprisingly, biggest state far, Uttar Pradesh, population greater either Brazil Pakistan, fifth cases sixth deaths. would say multi-factorial:

1) Poor leadership population susceptible misinformation politicians.

2) Higher population dwelling density, (Avg 4.03 people per house vs. 2.52 USA). 

3) Lower average education rate (7 years vs. 12 USA)

4) Less testing focusing testing patients high pre-test probability

5) Less medical resources developed countries

Other countries similar comparing #2-5 better instructions leaders. look top 5 countries COVID cases, poor leadership and/or non compliant citizens. India going take lead simply based population density poverty levels.  believe either believe people say"" protests"" reference early June, referring everything happened. many peaceful protests, many distancing. also riots, also widespread looting. part gets ""hate."" never heard anything negative peaceful ones, concern protestors risking infecting friends family basically science experiment time see happened. ""Avoid politics"" one sub rules. Lol try harder LOL. Thanks, Wuhan. hope U.S. EU allow Chinese citizens travel future without extreme vetting. No, working. Daily testing get through. Baseball hanging there. fact vaccine manufacturers zero liability destroy life flat kill also troubling thought get behind new rushed never used RNA injection. Testing impact need death certificate... die tested far know negotiate cost ER visit cannot stress miserable experience was. system broken. US allowed fly directly Beijing, right? correct US citizen fly cities travel land Beijing, allow yet? Pretty crazy United States travel bans imposed European Union Brazil -- parts world decent public health infrastructure resolving epidemics -- India. going take SARS-CoV-2 \*a long time\* work India's 1.4 billion people, travel ban Indians no-brainer. time, could confidently lift bans Europeans Brazilians. no! can't say part! Trumps fault! lol  Mexico's testing regime one worst Latin America, regrettably, little idea. 

Does anyone know *high quality reliable* antibodyserological studies conducted across Mexico's hotspots yet? would curious see results Welcome internet something lot us talking since beginning. Contrary lot claims bandied months ago, virus primarily affects rich middle-income countries. spares poorest.

The downside one main reasons spares poorest generally live long enough get high-risk groups. Oh wow. never accused before. lead Risperdal marketing told doctors antipsychotic worked dementia FDA told J&amp;J market safe elderly data. created new elder care sales force marketing. data drug doubled deaths elderly vs placebo. head head study Zyprexa could say Risperdal less likely cause diabetes. data showed Risperdal likely cause diabetes Zyprexa stuck original sales pitch even though data disproved it. also marketed autism FDA approved drug adolescents knowing could disrupt fertility long term could cause adolescent males grow female breast tissue would need mastectomy remove. paid largest FDA marketing fine. got promoted CEO. jail. J &amp;J among least ethical pharma co would propose obesity Mexico that's lot damage. South Central American countries well regards Covid? Thanks, we'll agree disagree, believe piece BBC. Many doctors come forward similar concerns also called ""conspiracy theorists"". idea RNA vaccine work also theory, author article offer proof Carrie mentions actually false. Instead, bring unrelated conspiracy theory Spanish Flu attempt conflate two claims.

While article states ""Carrie Madej's video makes false claim vaccines change recipients' DNA,"" false claim, BBC offer actual evidence debunk it. fact, Bill Gates explained vaccine video mentions ""with RNA DNA... put instructions code make shape \[of virus\]"". RNA vaccine contains man-made genes supposed alter DNA way tells body make antibodies. explained article NY Times, “The synthetic gene incorporated recipient’s DNA. goes well, new genes instruct cells begin manufacturing powerful antibodies.” recipient's DNA"". would indeed change recipient's DNA... ""If goes well."" thanks! Voting booths indoors Tibet, agree you. excess death analysis last month pointed 3x reported number deaths. explain one me, like adopt, puppies sold end needing adopted.  Thanks much SARS SARS 2, China. Can't wait SARS 3 another decade. Maybe try learn something Taiwan Japan properly regulate food supply promote basic hygiene? part? Please let know I'm Ecuador. daily cases simmering along steady rate. see constant, big spikes due testing delays/backlog. saw Paraguays numbers, hoped same...an anomaly. last week trending sharply, I'm afraid curve fact steep.

That said, wrongly anticipated rise case count week so. State Emergency ends 12th, restrictions movement provinces already eased. constant balance containment poverty still daily conflict: people work eat. And, like everywhere, tired.

One thing think real us, may real Paraguay, Argentina, got asses kicked hard early. scared daylights us, fear made us careful. imagine Paraguay, done well avoid hard blows, might fooled thinking happen there. Peru, Chile, Colombia...pretty much everywhere except Uruguay, evidence foolish let guard down.

I know, man. I'm sad Paraguay...I thought figured somehow. Uruguay gets slammed...well damn...they're last hope Latin American society capable correct response. go down, we're helpless onslaught. John Wick would say

What raw numbers?

I love claim NUMBERS, yet give figures.

Good bye, troll. Mexico’s leadership weren’t bunch drooling morons, maybe they’re less talk about.

I’m sure exact statement would get tons upvotes. /s Yeah would probably work. Can't really find hole plan. shows school classes outside, masked, weather permits. combination clearly superbly effective mitigating Coronavirus transmission PROFIT HEALTH CARE FAILED EXPERIMENT. countries* Stats tell, looking forward them. Personally feel infection rates places like Costco extremely low. Settle everyone, codes reagents reclassified 3822.00 COVID-19 Test kits WCO April 9th year make easier purchase pandemic.

http://www.wcoomd.org/en/media/newsroom/2020/april/joint-wco-who-hs-classification-list-for-covid_19-medical-supplies-issued.aspx Ugh. know, probably right, wrong sub that. I'll delete that. Looks like reached herd immunity contact tracers limited questions people been, course going disaster. unfair claim ""we've created vaccine ready sell it!"" trials handful participants involved. Yea good question, analyzed. see mortality go Finland flu season hard last year (Sweden hit hard last year) 

I also expected cases imported China Finnair routes China Helsinki hub. 
But seems org virus dangerous European/Italian mutation guess didn’t enough import cases. 

Latvia also really low cases, Baltics general. 

Finland really low immigration numbers. Would interesting wide antibody test Finland Thank much this. I’m 68 medication controlled hypertension, mild Aortic Stenosis, MVP ... definitely need cautious. 🥴  Murder 3 people possibly more? Little know, Except testing flawed too. looked false negative estimates lately? seen people “quarantine” waiting test results? need accurate faster tests. I’ve heard dogs 80% accurate detecting Covid saliva sample, accurate currently available PCR test. dont want compensation want happen. slap couple people 1 mil fine drive alaska theyll stop coming. guess americans see welding much life. still impossible hide death toll.

Lol. 70% HI threshold actually correspond R0=3.3 - commonly stated figure 60-70% corresponds R0=2.5-3.33. R0=5.5 would correspond HI threshold 82%. (Numbers K-factor=1 is) 

Now actual HI threshold may lower implied R0 due reason mentioned... people potential super spreaders likely infected earlier (as meet people). Baseline mobility / social contact (and thus R0) also different different places. Yeah, come think it, rich kids probably like marshmallows anyways Good you. Kia Kaha New Zealand. Fuck you. Everyone else fine Silly bot. Thats static adress gets updated new data continuously. Wow, US underreporting 40%, whereas European countries 15% No, like Fauci, said scientists plural accident. Fauci considered among yes, would taking alone says okay NC working app now. Hopefully ready long. app might practical current system use, involves management calling test positive. much people gonna disagree you, you’re wrong. Buy miracle tonic 1920s, good time cocaine high.

Buy miracle tonic now, stomach pumped bleach it. don’t know happened cases reported. Investigations ongoing. seems acknowledgement seeing patients person ideal. 

The real reason exceeding ICU capacity quadrupled 500 2000 beds. also load balancing system put place moved patients around hospitals overwhelm got many admissions. people (reported) died Covid 19 already. 

Damn. That's reality.

Look excess deaths. Hope not. would silly. test day get infected, there’s 100% chance false negative. False negatives drop around 60% four days infection, 40% around time symptoms start show. That’s many countries insisting multiple tests plus quarantine order prove negative status. quarantine little harder enforce. It’s hard anyone prove went either pub boat parade every day since went Covid test. 

I guess showing negative test better nothing. We’re close midway this. 

Umm, paying attention vaccine development? sort like accidentally inhaling pool water, stings bit really painful. problems exist current system already. know people put life changing medical procedures *years* can't afford it. People money get whatever need soon want it. Universal health care eliminates people dying can't afford take care urgent life death situations limiting wait services mere weeks/months. June* China doesn’t get prosecuted underreporting numbers.The fact people dying home town right primary caused ccp’s stupidity corruption. May introduce lord waterwheel? got back Cancun vacay last month. great time resort’s cleanliness/precautions better places states. Going back November.  Except, accounting massive amount people stayed home even usual due protests, ended negating amount people protesting overall. ended making difference way things would normally played out. Shutting everything works, cost high benefits provides. universal mask wearing enforced, large gatherings prevented, indoor gatherings people take masks prevented, there’s aggressive testing quick isolation suspected confirmed cases, don’t need shut everything. It’s last resort used everything else tried properly worked govt ideas. Lab find perfectly fit gloves good day. INSURANCE COMPANY PAY NUMBER.

Doctor here. point click bait articles getting posted annoying.

I’m surgeon. bill insurance company number want to. Take appendix? Million dollars please. Insurance company number going pay. It’s around $500. don’t give shit number send them. 

Insurance company paid standard amount pay every covid antibody test ever rest written like always is.  suspect paid $100-200. Nice find. talking delete post? delete anything. also want saying said fact merely feeling could shit.  familiar concept hubris?

I am, making credible theory based observed reported facts hubris is.

But think know trying say. Something along lines ""Who make claim!"" Right?

But think actually made ""unqulaified claim"".

It's one able look list realize half comorbidities likely caused covid itself, half killed person unless left unmanaged years/ decades.

That verifiable. cant ""look list"" comorbidities say ""Half caused Covid, half non-lethal comorbidities person would lived years/decades"".

You cant make claim *at all*.  

I one saying ""No, co-morbidities going kill person anyways, Covid jumped equation last minute. makes sense many stories taking place seniors homes"".

That's reasonable hypothesis. Unless somehow believe Covid ""skips over"" people immediately die long term homes hospices.

YOU one rules somehow refuses believe could ever case. ""exceptional hypothesis without proof"". ""hubris"" speak. Well, Test really measures prioritize short term long-term gain. Whether trust issues (that would regardless is, parents fucked up) lack self-control even care future much therefore see necessary control yourself, matter, result behaviour same. look evidence (how kids later life) marshmallow test deliver valid projections, matter kids eat marshmallow not. 


And hunger, course obvious factor like would controlled for. Oh sorry realise you. delete post? talking pharmaceuticals saying happen soon? 

They wrote letter response donald pressuring releasing vaccine elections. fact matter is, developing vaccine. think safe. cannot guarantee untill they've completed clinical trials. 

This news item 62 year old volunteering clinical trials. mean vaccine unsafe, means tested yet.

The road safe vaccine/medicine comprises certain steps, steps passed, vaccine/medicine deemed safe. reason going quickly, unlimited budget available develop vaccine. cost always cheaper cost vaccine. already producing vaccine mass scale. 

Normally would irrational know vaccine work. cost &lt; damage economy.

In american terms: 

Normally vaccin research like sniper rifle, hone target take single shot certain hit.

This vaccine like shotgun approach. lot research hope one hit That's fair point. compliance recommendations effective would worse without them. nothing else enough prevent health care system overwhelmed. someone explain headline currently 67k deaths US 192k deaths? Considering mixing crowd vax mask that.

Similar like Germany, iirc last protest almost 40k people ca. 25% people. testing lot now. Reason us largely financial covid shown extreme sums money passed around virology institutions. Oxfords example actually years development working sars mers, plenty runway costs experience ironed combined boat load cash, able release next year safely. Thats pandemics really weird people tries use Sweden agenda, debate/media polorized internationally. like:

""Sweden lock citizens up, abandon democratic principals enforce police state look, nobody died / every body died"" depending narrative trying push.

Its dangerous Swedens number looking better. Sweden lot, wasnt done fines police. stay home orders. Instead lot things like extra money stay home youre sick youre child sick. Extra money business kept employees etc. ""left"" response pandemic, thats far right people Sweden doesnt like it. US seems like right believe Sweden right thing. total opposite. Sweden sticks like sore thumb look excess deaths. Even compared Switzerland, performed poorly European standards. ""Substantial, additional analyses"", yeah right. Even crayon eating child could tell mass gathering idiots going increase spread virus.

People denial hard facts comes anything political, swear. already several candidates tested right now. would like share information. documentation support claim? Well sucks.

I know else say, that's worst confluence circumstances. Nah future generations get different textbooks past shrouded within controversies.  many want believe bunch people outside, generally believe masks work, equivalent way bunch people inside outside believe mask use matter opinion/fear/authoritarianism/etc.

I longer perverse desire laugh them. I'm glad masks work outside works.  know fact flu manifest asymptomatically people? We'd conduct flu test someone showing symptoms possible percentage show symptoms?
The way see though changes enough take R0 that's 3 0, enough something infectious SARS-COV-2. Either way long something working, I'm complaining. 3 EC votes Fair could written better ""if go lockdown, high risk overwhelming ICUs more"". hope satisfies now. get US president use Chinese government's example lock hard coronavirus.

The politicians spent first couple months vilifying China's response politicized pandemic. expect come say ""Hey wrong, may try China's approach""? lol


Besides think China's NPI applied anywhere else. talking like 1.4bn people collectively followed government's instruction almost flawlessly. 

This absolutely replicate countries. Spain country Mexico, it? Swedens hospitals wherent overwhelmed cause didnt even bother trying ol, got covid diqgnosis killed morphine. think pays mediaid medicaid US? government pays means tax payer already large sum taxes going pay healthcare human beings. 

And cost healthcare massively exorbitant US US government spending almost much many countries medicare medicaid per capita. 

But course Americans paying health insurance top funding medicaid medicare average US citizen paying double countries still getting universal coverage. dude. Mexican American, trust me. play Americanized people give shit Wow worse ones put with. Yeah, mean kind weird weird like introduction corporate identity personality. guess people write shit actually spend lot time thinking say ""hello still fb"". would pi55 someone wrote private business surmounted odds ignore reach them. say worthy viewing self advertisments please contact . info knew one person family - trump fans many born christiians, spent time trying explain insanity. used coronavirus stop logging account Odour molecules extremely small, Covid-19, hitches ride mucous/fluid coughed, sneezed, expelled talking, 70-90 nm. 

Point being, able smell something without making inhaled virus. 

Wearing mask shared bathroom, washing hands, good ventilation important measures. lie. Sweden lowest death rate Europe today. usually problems staying away people go Austin TX pretty damn mask compliant, neighbor always fucking catches coming home run (maskless) try talk close possible. know he’s working home roommate amazon worker it’s like chances super low..drives insane. Well, personally I'm still listening advice experts. I'm avoiding unnecessary travel, wearing masks anytime I'm outside house, wiping anything bring it, washing hands, staying away others. rest county pile airplanes, go cookouts, show smashmouth concerts, I'll best make sure sure I'm catching spreading virus. mean also trying curb it, I'm saying surprised scientist fucked sars government. Apparently, Europe. point isn’t Sweden success story. point myth Sweden nothing dangerous, that’s reality, nothing would lead worse results. chance we'll see vaccine getting approved rolled public end 2020? Fuck medical express.... need say loud scared enough already ... bloody bitches need find cure ...you ass holes normal death toll Pakistan normal day pre covid. like people forgotten people died past.  Also, thankfully, true. was, even Trump would scared way hell underlying conditions. ""have asthma? die"" ""have SVT? die"", ""fat? die"" governments would taking seriously already way million deaths. simply going sane crazy world friend.
A lot us days... idiots see statistic large % victims Black/Latino/POC think affect they're white. really same, protest moving around, getting overly exposed anybody particular. concert could downwind infected long time, get high viral load. Yes. Oppression bad matter whose team on. Stfu. People care. Prianista  close friend works nurse Mexico city, live US. talk dude.... scared shitless even go public nurse. much love people, ignorance ... fucking arrogant ignorant enjoy it, feel proud it. day covid 19 like watching alex jones. hoax. possible anymore outbreaks march. Virus well spread would need half year stay home order lol land many MAGA sheep believe Covid big deal masks worse giving Covid people. Sweden negative excessive mortality since July, it’s bit misleading say overreported. underreporting, although high countries. end fair better neighbors fewer deaths. Neither Sweden US come close success story. come hear nothing long term effects COVID-19 China? disease longest, looks like they're massively dropping ball really figuring disease trying sweep rug. effect patient unaware placebo. studies show effects even patient aware taking placebo. Korea letting people US country? Hey, still behind Belgium, all’s well.

When started US remember discussions several people claiming, time, US much better Europe (or, specifically, EU) dealing pandemic.

They unable understand deaths already dropping quite rapidly Europe, (at time) still increasing US.

It several months since US overtaken EU death per capita back couldn’t even imagine US ever coming close overtaking Italy, Spain UK. seems possible might happen. thefederalist.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  disagree me, make wrong. Every single item posted comes live examples true virology immunology. yet read fines/closure initially given venue rescinded? 

Hope civil lawsuits happy couple, venue, charlatan “preacher” “church” filed prevail courts. people businesses held liable. 
You think people wear masks (write yes here) &lt;----

You happy labelled (write yes here) &lt;----  also believe skiing Italy Swedish thing right? Finns go lot? Finnish friend said guess. 

If Finland got fewer cases start helped big time. real question is: naive automatically assume “studies” misrepresenting truth? COVID first started spreading, “studies” told us wearing masks essential little aid prevention spreading disease. 

If anyone thinks large gatherings don’t cause uptick transmissions “study” says so, naive gullible, it’s simple that. Ugh shut fuck sinophobe proof yet virus started. start China what? actions one individual enough condemn entire country??? US rest west lucky haven’t virus outbreaks abhorrent conditions keep livestock in. 

China didn’t help world? forget aid gave Italy, Serbia, Venezuela, many masks sold US? already said they’ll distribute vaccine throughout world they’ll cover cost. how. someone somewhere fucked continuing lie.  understand viral loads work. Youtube video. stuffy nose two days today it’s going away. Also post nasal drip irritating throat cough time time. Something worry allergies/a cold? 4. also like Florida great transmission rate either... lol test 1.5 million day. even accept help like that? put dent anything used propaganda purposes. Followed fascist thirties warring forties. one.

Right might true. But, half picture that, Norway long period significantly stricter restrictions lockdown Sweden, resulting fraction deaths per million (Norway: 49. Sweden: 577). Norway able ease control. hospitals coping? Thank you, too! pawn queen misinformation? possible issues occur? Again, implying won’t one soon COVID, listening experts. actual mechanisms prevent HIV vaccine complex. Coronaviruses stable, indications people’s immune systems provides strong, long-term immune response COVID. won’t certain years, it’s brand new, smartest people field optimistic. 100+ candidates vaccines. Vaccines, typically 7% approval rating. say it’s unlikely we’ll viable candidate soon ignore facts. plenty hurdles, lot reasons optimistic. Best best! true hes plan anymore didn't. got numbers 100x Vietnam had. peak first wave, Vietnam 24 cases day. 

The minimum 7 day average Italy ever attained 170. Spain never got 200. 

In total March 1st July 1st, Vietnam 355 cases, bulk imported, community transmission. European countries often registering many cases single day Vietnam 4 months. Sardonic perhaps? First admit retarded. I'll lie admit feel better.

Because think saying 

* ""people arrested"" 

is 

* ""people warned, fined comply, arrested cause trouble"".

-----

Thinking like retarded.

And I'm totally fine called extremist issue fucking said first comment dumb fuck :) Haha trans/lgbt bashing, hilarious funny original. /s/s/s/s/s/s/s Actually, kids 11 catch spread well adults. kids may less likely die teachers, relatives, neighbors put risk. That's also entirely true. Compliance rules work home, see friends family, travel huge. Transport stats, phone stats, small businesses requiring loans shows that.

The absolutely major issue care homes. like Spain UK also high death rates. tragic clusterfuck. Meanwhile teachers can’t get daily tests, yeah sports ball! love football, love watching sports, smh. Holy shit might come physical proximity people, spend less time near one. top that, put order months sell however many shares stock ever hits certain price? control selling did, control stock price general well. Ive Completely agree... rare part front center vs last thing mentioned.

Some people comparing MIS-C polio bad science. polio chances serious impact far far greater. 

People using overhyped fear shame people wanting take kids back school well. mean saying rare also justice say rare. 

It stinks see community like Reddit time data science driven completely react extreme. hard seeing comments people wanting harm others :( Clemson (my alma mater) almost 400 cases, school hasn’t even started person classes. I'm worried that. said running primary trying differentiate left leaning candidates moderate choice. He's already shifted position left(the unity task force plan strong public option automatic enrollment. single payer certainly step direction better now). seriously doubt anything get pased Democrats would veto. Spain we're getting second wave schools start. 10K daily cases now, population 46M.

Some grades start tomorrow, others start 14th. in-person going disaster.

As me, I'll wear KN95 mask day long I'll get lapel mic students hear me. classes start mid-october, schools might closed then. That’s kinda point Maybe admit said something really really stupid? We're #1, we're #1 suck Sweden! Hey wait....? Lol European countries go numbers back Vietnam levels summer, could followed Vietnam model there. ¿Cual universidad? UGA 698 well Perhaps isn’t reporting either tho. understanding situation 400 less people would died compared projections pre covid subtracting total number covid deaths time period. Perhaps people would died causes died due covid isn’t reporting Sweden kept rules max 50 persons gatherings, means spectators sports. 

Many countries however instance opened various events crowds thousands - Denmark 10 000 people Parken. Sars Cov 2 relatively stable prone mutation Than* stupid trolling? 1.3 billion infections. fatality rate India 2% 4 million infections India. multiply 2% total population see reasoning skills joke. getting statistics? downloaded raw data CDC site two days ago, 17,000 deaths U.S. ~1M cases reported. 
If somebody better data source, please let know. Good day :) aware Korean Starbucks case? One woman seated beneath air vent 2.5 hours directly infected 27, including kid minutes use restroom. event subsequently least 80 cases traced it, last read. doubt case count higher now.

And shiny modern Starbucks. Ventilation US public schools? Judging ones city? Horrifying. Yes, voting mail great idea. it? that's true... remember went college subsidized unsubsidized federal loans. think subsidized accumulate interest studying unsubsidized did. extra 6 months studying would likely mean 6 months interest latter gets paid (assuming payments missed semester due Covid payments hold. 

When school, believe initially subsidized Stafford annual max Perkins less generous terms. ended transferring schools decrease loan debt. copy it, start early never let get control. control, way get numbers back harsh lockdowns Western countries demonstrated appetite more. medium.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Florida good shape ""early on"" real first wave like northeast. large wave summer along country, sitting 17th terms deaths per capita, good considering 9th terms population density major travel destination. imagine yep! additionally, optics needs considered. seeing massive crowds people jam packed like sardines mainstream media everyday creates certain perception, regardless R0 factor... never said implied would. Wow that's impressive. bad US competent enough thing Literally none things. sarcasm? detector’s broken. local measures. Yes: one. Duh. Easy. Called months ago read it. I'm robot. know Reddit poll option create yes/no tick box.

You think people wear masks Jailed?
y/n

You happy labelled extremist?
y/n India really young population helps Subsidised solar panels boi I’ve never less surprised life. Sorry family :( Still left house since March generally celebrate holidays (I introvert boring). think I've ever celebrated gone anywhere Labor Day ever. buy groceries dangerous standing around people outdoors wearing masks. regurgitated fear push fuckin tiring. you’re scared world stay home. plenty ways live somewhat normal life stay safe pandemic. Sitting home 24/7 pushing fear others shouldn’t one them. Unfortunately saw wedding Maine (death toll last report stands 3 far), isn’t asshole attendees die: it’s secondaries tertiaries 😣 Honestly, need start naming people this. think might might make people think twice fune. shows bad things States, think.

This rate spread actually little LESS general population. 51000 big number, 15-20 million college students, plus countless staff. hope know go, endangering lives people. never know could carrier... don’t think vacation could hold off? answered this(when get arrested masks) TWICE still asking. That's I'm calling retarded.

*""Police first ask wear it, comply write hefty fine, refuse cooperate like giving ID, arrested ""endangering public safety health""*

Thrice now. going ask can't fuckin read? ""When someone shows are, believe them.""

Hope feel better soon! Ontario least virtually 100% compliance closed public spaces. Even chin strap people complying staying away. would add probably 30% wearing outdoors open. result county went almost two months without new case. live Mexico City tell 1000% local people business FAR US far prevention social protocols. Everyone wears mask, every single store restaurant thermometer use person, store provide new clean masks need one, tons social distancing everywhere. Restaurants 25%. CA WA state mexico (at least CDMX Quintana Roo) far, far better regulations going on. You’re welcome best wishes. Problem group one may good intentions, highly divided ways getting there. fairness, WAY fatter. I'm really knocking India. obvious worst hit country, probably already are. can't stand anti-us sentiment across Reddit lately. It’s quite amazing really. Let’s hope USA reach point shortly greed getting fat tuition checks took precedence safety students, faculty, surrounding community. exactly deserve much blame. good college right thing. completely agree universities done instant second wave started. K-12 schools. I’m saying I’d take US system government China’s day. Democracy beats dictatorship, hands down. First, excess mortality way higher that, suggests severe undercounting.

Second, virus black white affair - people either dead fine. Heart lungs sure look often suffer long term damage illness. didn’t consider all. I’m sure there’s lots people get sick stay home 2 weeks don’t report right. Maybe even We're stage. used like first wave, get 100 days cases, mask work over. 2nd wave mostly happens northern side (mainly Danang) thanks goodness, iirc Danang locked hard side, limited activities ban bar likes.  Ikr? It’s like absentee landlord street pays city fines shoveling snow sidewalks it’s cheaper paying someone shovel.

Some people born assholes. require consequences (a big stick) order make right thing. sound weak. Corona kills lot Alright then, when's US gonna start apologizing H1N1? Still waiting that. remember 14k caused shitstorm. Even knowing backlog adjustment. 

So 300k daily increase days...... 🤦‍♂️ specifically link cases Smash Mouth's performance, Sturgis general? Ah, no, dude. Someone's sneeze still infect you: India Times. Japanese scientist actually filmed infection special camera. even one person adverse reaction dies that's many! correct motivation push police preventative force. they're really set that. 

Crimes abhorrent, especially crimes physically mentally injure victims. better get root problem treating symptoms. crime happen? criminal commit crime? situation lead criminal wanting commit crime? Etc... area, still 90s. That's awfully warm. Healthy kids recover sort viral damage like easily. kids getting Mis-C obese I’m pretty sure. Correct I’m wrong might totally wrong pretty high rn fake news? Facebook open forum. Nobody gives comments Facebook except friends. feel it’s unlikely someone would multiple friends would make horrible comments father’s death. think people like victims make stories like this.

Even flawed still represents covid restrictions well. Wait 6 weeks open normal, fuck around you’re “bored” end 6 months corona mean, people probably assume

“If contagious days weeks displaying symptoms, person share bed rub genitals probably already it”

I know been. almost makes sound like sheltering place away spouses. Sweden mostly done this? know long term effects vaccine! standard ""the worst:?

Why would be, advantages like lack multi-generational households good heath care system? 

Sweden good, ""there worse!"" Best wishes full recovery guarantee Fuchs vote mail

Right?

Don't know that's trump family?

So dumb. one century, last time novel coronavirus swept globe: Hah, Checkmate loser!

/s There’s difference wind blow someone’s sneeze away linger air hours indoors. Basic biology Yes, biggest reason high death rate. live northern state Mexico, test positivity ratio far lower rest country (around 20% compared +50%) death rate around 3%, world average. great work either state, shows testing working country death rate high is: tests made ill patients. 200' sites?

Where camp?

But yeah, seems totally fine me. least nobody's boat get sunk... Thank saving fate yoynare arguing exact number, fact remains Sweden horribly regarding deaths. work trip week ago clients. Afterwards, insisted eating closed restaurant say anything clients, one began talking disease overhyped even close death drink chlorine dioxide would get cured instantly. 

And people follow instagram partying. guy traveled plane Guadalajara party. I'm like... hell. 2.3 million assuming 1% fatality rate. working hard made someone successful waiters gardeners would millionaires. Go America! can’t even keep winning. world must think Americans great right Domain name checks Stupidest headline I've ever read US getting shit leadership dropped ball beginning literally said going disappear like miracle. Even though lot tests done, many results back patient two weeks, far long anything useful information, critical period April June, initial widespread outbreak establishing itself. Australia 90+% reduction flu cases flu season we're managing Covid pretty well.

And that's us Island (I know people love saying that)

The northern hemisphere save lives. need make sacrifices India reporting covid cases ever before, time, Indian government continuing **ease** restrictions, moving call ""Unlock 4.0"". 
In words, Indian government decided enact nationwide lock small number cases, decided end lock rise number cases. 

What Indian government strategy? seems pretty much opposite everybody else doing. baseball least changed schedule play teams near reduce traveling. baseball socially distanced sport begin with. Football probably one least socially distanced sports. while, think means NFL season totally screwed, anticipate may harder time baseball. thing think could make NFL easier control unlike CFB, NFL teams could *very* easily institute semi-bubble-type situations. Whereas CFB going harder nature campus life, especially lot D1 players big party schools. *Without vaccine*, like said, thing would totally shitfuck us decade. Even *with* vaccine never 100% go away... One thing mention, controlling suspected rate community infection time protests? NYC huge protests see spike, also still lockdown people infected, chances coming contact slim.

But Texas, started relaxing lockdowns month protests, much larger percentage protests would infected/contagious compared NYC Chicago - end May surging community know till numbers started spiking mid-June. code.  *I* care something, it’s justified outrage. *you* care something, it’s concern trolling.

-the mantra narcissistic sociopaths everywhere. slow don’t understand works. spread exponential larger scale, event. incubation time 2-3 days, doesn’t allow immediate spread someone got infected. Spread depends already-infectious individual(s), whether they’re wearing mask not, social distancing, whether event indoors One person wearing mask ruin everyone, sure, risk spread way lower outside ventilated area compared indoor vicinity recirculated Recirculated air actually stop spread cannot beat transmission time.&lt;
Well course doesn’t, never said did. actually improves spread virus gives chances infect people recirculating airborne virus. rest comment irrelevant, discussing racial aspect protests 

As untouchables, implicit reasoning. less noble, i.e, causes disagree with, get COVID, never mind even media sympathetic BLM photographed people without masks. assembly neo-Nazis, foaming mouth they're spreading coronavirus, even wearing everyone agrees deaths definitely resulted police, without cause, would agree? Put middle wilderness 14-day quarantine can't find anyone else infect. remember flu every year employer continues pay salary first weeks case can't work due illness/accident? Sounds like typical campground it’s actually real Mexico? stage level lockdown America in? paying attention America awhile. use censorship realize obtain result much less effort cause people dumb lazy read situation. That’s gonna really rough October March country lol. us live California 360 days sun  Damn! people prosecuted something 3-6% world’s population, least 234,000,000 people. That’s 234 million anyone bad math. friend visiting family San Diego able cross ways issue. That's true land border, really enforced strictly, all. air, people problem traveling, even tourism. one makes money 4chan though... yet... Mmmm sort of? lot variables play. get wanting cautious vaccine that's one moving part. I'm inclined think die relatively soon. Instead pay attention complete strangers made names say reddit. Like real ~~neckbeard~~ Adult literally belong r/iamverysmart.

Im giving numbers. Im giving examples rare things less rare covid reinfection youre like ""bro youre stupid time idiot"" respond people way too. Youre far ass actually terrifying. talk ignoring reality sitting sgaring right face.  get point buy coffee China credit card. There's morons everywhere, friend. Especially top leadership positions Brazil, Mexico, United States. Save concern trolling somewhere else. first report protests drive spikes. shown before.

Source; neither CNN Fox suffice. actual proven report PCR TESTING numbers. think read article.

I read article. also mentioned article citing essentially ""data"" Northeastern University Guardian did. also said sample data garbage based PCR testing. Notice studiously avoided issue casts doubt recycled bullshit nobility COVID-19? said, posting site literally get PMs telling kill self based opinions *literally anything*

Idk reddit high farts thinks complete anonymity makes people *nicer*  Several schools affected areas delayed opening person. Except school Todd Bell runs... Cite source Tara Potato. long influenza us cure? know fine, clearly said believe penalty. fees absolutely arbitrary point tens thousands dollars spent enrollment teaching bears costs? Ultimately pearl clutch contract law like ultimately agree. Young adults financial futures ruined huge corporations, entirely capable absorbing loss, making mistakes. People brains don’t believe lies thought coronavirus 1-2 weeks incubation time, schools get blamed open days? Yup - still enough overwhelm hospitals China, Italy, Spain, NYC, NJ - would wish doctors hospitals sick patients across US? think it’s decided individually district. district starts Tuesday remote end month. Families may opt remote hybrid reassess end month.  Oh, ya, forgot, monolith ""media"" ""narrative'. Thank god Fox OANN tell like really is- One person wearing mask ruin everyone, sure, risk spread way lower outside ventilated area compared indoor vicinity recirculated air.

""The risk lower...."" 
Yeah, okay, lol. said could ruin experience everyone. Why? spread exponential. Apparently, one understand COVID-19 works. Recirculated air actually stop spread cannot beat transmission time. 

As untouchables, implicit reasoning. less noble, i.e, causes disagree with, get COVID, never mind even media sympathetic BLM photographed people without masks. assembly neo-Nazis, foaming mouth spreading coronavirus, even wearing masks. 

Trumpists pro-ally people racists. One is, however, honest it. citizens also want crime happen us also want police prevent crime. roundabout way asking proactive policing. actual police tactics abhorrent let's forget motivation reflection want. It’s blown way proportion. Kawasaki like disease rare side effect children viral pneumonias people safely distanced outdoor concerts? venues viable - space 6 feet can't fit enough crowd make profitable. considering already 200k deaths u.s. 6 million cases, best case scenario, assuming least double cases catched half herd immunity kicks early, easily million deaths u.s. Riiight. Actually go Vietnam get back me. Lovely place, great food, much third world country comes hygiene. Also, it, good luck using American credit card Japan largely cash-based consumer economy. really miss La Paz. spent March - July year. Amazing sunsets.

The death toll pretty high though. hospitals equipped handle virus?

We’re considering coming back November. agree logistic nightmare!!!
Question gets first million doses? Plain old stupidity. say local What're talking about? Besides wearing masks (with somewhere around 50% compliance) everyone treating pandemic big deal. Life ""back normal"" sense nothing closed better sure leave doubt assume, Usually people make mistakes apologize correct misunderstanding. Saying ""it's obvious read mind known meant say obviously"" makes look like ass.

Anyways, many aspects critical thinking, ""experts"" make mistakes, ""experts"" may motives mislead you, ""experts"" may information form ""expert"" opinion.

You charge life, decide information presented you. Like old saying goes, *if everyone jumps cliff going jump too?* Seems like answer would yes critical thinking limited accepting expert tells you. answer question. Given eradication table, advocating social distance forever? death cert literally print someone dies special printed copy paper telling running paper wait, people going come woodwork spin positive US and/or Sweden. guys think vaccine help all? Yes. last week. little mask use. say Australia's experience spread certainly 100% stop test rate like Nope next pandemic doing? Still strategy anything. Fuck it, let rip point Well, 1 state requires masks they're locked inside 23 hours day right now.

The rest them? speak experience mask compliance pretty low (Maybe 5% shops tops) social distancing pretty good. Got stickers ground showing stand, people sitting far apart public transport etc.

But biggest difference imo? people going work sick. Gone days people coming work ""I'm dedicated *Cough Cough* hard worker"".

I bus week, 1 person coughed once, could feel mood change. cultural shift ""Sick? Stay fuck home"" probably driven success.

It's wonderful. Toronto get antibody testing? quote wise pandemic it. Taking page Trump leadership book, see. probably never seen YouTubers, especially food vlogs, China going everywhere sharing videos place China guys act like everyone positive going die speeches may promise economical social equality, truth AMLO ran bunch token promises consice plan achieve. ran corny campaign corny slogans people ate up

Sounds exactly like Bernie Meanwhile Mexican news: worry guys cases decreasing ask Lmao spout lies nonsense foreigners China conviction without shame 🤣 Agree. study garbage garbage out. mention young people likely seek testing. They’d contesting protest spreading others. [Party like tomorrow end least Sweden 70% men 80 survice COVID. Among women much higher. like everyone dies. hell live pay less $70 electricity? Trump incompetent “constructive/do stuff” part authoritarians. He, steadfast support GOP manages destroy/corrupt/pervert, course democracy like US one handle mask compliance, social distancing compliance?

Could large part number strict nursing home guidelines? Like covid, probably lot previous flu complications could center heavily elderly, imposing restrictions already significantly cuts problems? people still want crossing borders without precautions safeguards legality?? Nuts. point Chile yellow, many active cases new cases relatively low stable, change time course, bright red months ago. speeches may promise economical social equality, truth AMLO ran bunch token promises consice plan achieve. ran corny campaign corny slogans people ate up. 

You often hear use religious items jab opposition (a sort ""own conservatives"", make sense), dodge questions rant minutes end (often turning spotlight back him), simply plainly lie keep appearance things going get better. happening murders time high (even covid began) economics looking grim (0.1% growth 2019), stuck Covid limbo. never truly closed. Soon announced would go lockdown, authorities also told us eat would keep working. stance changed. according article,

Nope, Ignoring mask use based density figure pulled ass, assume robust study would correlation study found. study hold density people outside everything cool. Glamorous vagrant excellent band name. How's freedom movement enjoyed Australians? Oh right, nobody out. 

Our choice. There's issue leaving Europe right now, demonstrate government going coming back short hurry. say w/ family member that's left Italy. Process hard, want people bringing coronavirus save last years old people pre-existing conditions (we know primary risk Covid-19, yes, take view still room discussion relative hardship suffering).

My cousin London _still_ recovering disease, acquired Boris. Young, healthy female, help shape views fucking around it.

Tribalism certainly universal problem equally problem currently.

In case, right far believing denialist propaganda. bad thing serious calibrated studies going end (the Spanish) affected ones world's dead/infected ratio.

As happened us 1918. AKA Spanish flu.

Can't wait (IRONY) appreciate info explanation. Thank you! 98.5% calculation based entirely comment 75% candidates move past P3. imagine Fauci way information that, would trust math mine. finally reveals herself, he-she. Come man. I’ve seen live-streams videos big protests. It’s impossible blocks full people packed shoulder shoulder yelling protest big source transmission even everyone wearing masks. Don’t get wrong, believe cause think protesting injustice worth risk, flat don’t believe spin didn’t contribute rise cases. typo, meant accepting, obviously.

again used critical thinking skills, pretty obvious context. know? Probably stock market basics.

First, $89M Moderna exactly ""all"" CEO execs stock, especially stock done since March.

Second, restricted transactions - inside info progress trials thus far they're selling news, they'll deep shit SEC know it.

Finally - makes perfect sense insiders would start selling now, multiple reasons. biggest one Moderna probably priced vaccine success point. people equity stakes much lower valuations, cashing portions diversifying (or preparing market downturn cash on) makes perfect sense. probably also realize lot competitors vaccine space, Moderna might provide candidate simply beat competitors either feature price basis.

There's conspiracy here. Plot twist: she’s true bubble havoc ensues. iirc international flights redirected airports Beijing since another outbreak capital would pretty disastrous really don’t get trying convince narrative somehow protests didn’t lead people transmitting virus. People aren’t stupid, reason sure like treat us way.

It study, trying push narrative. get choose believe outside masked protests cause uptick, that's data says.

The examples googled fuckall study referenced article work based contact give read know attacking. issue US. can’t prevent travel mandate quarantine - though enforcing nothing like Australia. Look history things actually does, public statements makes. think change mind. fuck ""contact tracing""?

Sent couch Kansas City testing sick people, thats high lol. kind like... know Americans banned travelling vast majority Western world right now,

How's freedom movement enjoyed Australians? Oh right, nobody out. path isolated, save thousands lives. judge that.

I do. causing extended misery hardship millions, save last years old people pre-existing conditions (we know primary risk Covid-19, yes, take view still room discussion relative hardship suffering). Johnson Johnson pharma company. retail reputation caring provider 'family products' extremely important them.

Sure inside, outside air mask slows exhaled particles; stop altogether.

got peer reviewed source this? mean bullshit.


Did read article? study based previous contact tracing links study trying determine protests cause surge, opposite sort conspiracy live manipulated times

and youre part problem, read actual article want attack it. Yeah see Tijuana, everything's reopening people going like nothing ever happened. data showing (BLM) protests contributed virus spread?

From article OP: “There clear significant negative correlation percentage state’s population reported protesting subsequent increase cases COVID-19.”

Where large participation protests large increase cases compared areas low participation protests.

The data there. really thought there'd big spike NYC massive protests, mask compliance extremely high events outdoors, supporting idea outdoor spaces pose significantly less risk indoor spaces.  apply moderator?..its kinda interesting. true, would also say major section reddit condemn republicans/right giving democrats/liberals pass. Make mistake right chock full dumbasses right exploited political gain, happens left wise remember that. I'm sorry go fact parents get this.

I two kids wife constantly laments fact we're keeping fully remote semester, they're going lose school experience. remind feel bad well - NYC's hybrid learning model, essentially pulls kids 1-2 days week - school experience either. They'll masked distanced day. They'll struggling hear teacher talking mask. usual recreational activities, since there's gym class recess, they'll eating lunch classroom. There's good answer - nobody wants this, virus care want.

Meanwhile, teachers NYC asked return unsafe schools, safety procedures poorly defined. There's way going end well.  educator, could maybe educate us. really hope too. Hang ❤️ sure Canadians opening schools week. Right last/busiest long weekends summer... Drink water Hey Canada's alright guess Report please. Translation: 

'US Pharma Companies Plan Joint Pledge Release Vaccine High Cost Possible Claiming Cost Lot Test Make Sure Safe'

Never trust anything Pharma says, reason. playing angle sort. concerned fundamental level good anyone, all, ever. think saw Redditor day said part test group. There’s great work happening there. mask hold out. Stay safe x   wife haven’t around family friends 6 months. We’re trying stay safe really miss family friends. Well, obvious lie. Incivility makes majority comments sub. Ok read stuff already said multiple times, codes renamed WCO April 2020

3002.15 formerly known ""Immunological products, put measured doses forms packings retail sale"" renamed ""Covid-19 Test kit""

3822.00 basically Polymere Chain Reaction reagents, used basically everywhere work DNA.

9027.80 laboratory instruments, non specific related specifically made Covid-19.

So think happened.
The Website uses WCO/WHO database connect product classification number, WCO changed names numbers, changed every Item database, thus making old purchases adapt new name, given spring 2020. led give conspiracy theorists impression, ""plandemic"" bothered read articles linked? One specifically says started asking people went protests. vast majority cases came social gatherings. city many others people gathering bars restaurants caused majority outbreaks summer. Where’s outrage that?

The others say ask person general, don’t go laundry list possible locations/activities. someone says protest, data collected. One talks law enforcement erroneously calling police investigations “contact tracing”.

I agree live manipulating times. Wtf know someone booked wedding June 2021 even know going safe  Reading opinions experts excepting expert opinion using critical thinking skills.

thinking layperson ignorance trumps lay people using critical thinking skills. end 2021


The US government chosen three vaccine candidates fund Phase 3 trials Operation Warp Speed: Moderna’s mRNA-1273, University Oxford AstraZeneca’s AZD1222, Pfizer BioNTech's BNT162. Members ACTIV suggested developing safe controlled human infection models (CHIMs) human trials could take 1-2 years. sponsor would need provide data placebo-controlled trials indicating vaccine least 50% effective COVID-19 order authorized use, according FDA guidance issued effective 30 June. false equivalence false. One side saying covid hoax not.   Prime Minister keeps saying there’s hope one end year. man asshole says seems backed friends medical world called up, retirement, potentially administer injections. country readying it. may come little later hoped really seems like it’s way. get Russian vaccine? maybe try spread word-of-mouth remedy, ""vitamina D"" something actually shown help. post history littered racist comments. might want clean bit want anyone take seriously. Placebos work know placebos. we’re “Americans.” Nothing stop us guess missed “religious nutcase” part post much talk Sweden younger people hospitalised still coping Covid symptoms long infection? That's Republican strategy since Clinton: people feel. things great Democrats, make feel things bad. things bad Republicans, make feel things great. open too. Newt Gingrich admitted way Fox News adopted propaganda strategy. like parents said loved you... One big reason exceeding ICU capacity Sweden chose give palliative care many people elderly homes. Doctors basically administered morphine proxy (over phone). many died this. cuz really dont want racial equality get special status? fair? lose parents like woman has, undoubtedly lose shit conspiracy theorists. I'm already angry enough high risk loved ones taking seriously buy bullshit. can't even look FB anymore without filled rage. TIL: music festivals important racial equality. ""Died""? pandemic over. go :) old neurones firing up. core humanity starting reassert itself.

Yours still seem stagnant though :) might person ""alive"" type vegetative state. Seems fitting though looks like brain turned potato since cannot read comments repeat things again. said country go lockdown, hospitals overwhelmed. pointed entirely correct since happen Sweden. I'm way advocating others follow strategy Sweden (so far number deaths speaks itself), complex made be, corrected you. media painting protests negatively entire time. US care human rights UN, fair. We’ve moved Information Age Misinformation Age. I’ve found core support group friends family key, it’s also important happy people’s accomplishments turn bring happiness. oh.. ur idiot understand biology. never mind, u worth time. I’ve found core support group friends family key, it’s also important happy people’s accomplishments turn bring happiness. nope.. long 80% people wear masks, spread mostly stopped. Either way, countries top two obesity rates. surprised countries highest health issues deaths. Eating greasy bbq, tacos pizza no. think combination disbelief part. information comes strusted sources think would ignore it. trust officials plummeted around world. Maybe keeping open mind actual friends living China taking say without judgement would help. good luck getting two year olds wear mask 30 seconds! november? gunna cold wait... r/thedonald admins still around help? /s found grim reaper costume beach guy  caused surge, sure main cause.

A pointless study article. found grim reaper costume beach guy long people wear masks. make america racist again!  According Health Ministry data Friday, Mexico reported 6,196 new Covid-19 cases, bringing total 623,090. Deaths stand 66,851.

That’s seventh ones reported US. bad. But, muh freedumbs!!! Idaho land incompetence. Walk business sign clearly requires patrons wear mask. Staff immediately tells don’t need wear mask.... Ok ok ok get - would useful could provide actual data. 

How talk UK, data shows 91% Covid mortalities pre-existing conditions? 9% ballpark 6%. need politicise it. Yes. Currently Danish case rate higher Sweden’s, much. Norway par Sweden Finland’s almost non-existent. 

In Sweden still seeing effects ICU hospital spots occupied well deaths surge earlier year. substantial lag there. mean, people die many weeks ICU. still take time settle. 

But current case trend clear downward trend ICUs deaths, things looking really promising now. However, sentence pronounced many countries, find flare couple weeks later... one manipulators. Yeah jailing might top

there go :) old neurones firing up. core humanity starting reassert itself. Settle beavis. still thinks were? LOL @ new protocols

Sharron, fired.

Mary, Sharron's job now. heard correct. hurt. feel uncomfortable 5 minutes so. Looks like shitty anti-AMLO propaganda video.  unable detect infectious cases means usually isolate non infectious people simultaneously unable properly fully isolate highly infectious/super spreaders properly (aka stay home approaches). 

If improve testing enough able detect would go long way helping us manage things. send kids back achool concerned adults could indirectly transfer covid to, worried thier personal risk. 

However, either concern enough justify avoiding person school can. Think Making fun Mohammed allowing service industry workers wear full face coverings putting muslims concentration camps how? Western countries simpyl copy Vietnam doing?? virus care people gathering Australians pussys There's much money effort going vaccine research wonder chances viable vaccine can't developed. vaccine lot things everything. HIV vaccine elusive... COVID19 same.  2nd wave sure. uncertainty worse first. expect won’t tptb reacting fast.  Take look graph: countries underreporting. Notably, US one them. Norway finland seem alright. Cases identified hospitalization date rate remain multiple times Sweden. There’s record high younger generations living parents 30s UK. Especially London, affordable housing isn’t affordable anymore. still answer question though. still spread around older generation vulnerable. Kids going school spread take home grandparents watch kids parents back work now.

None makes sense! Surely second wave imminent winter? Scary times ahead. follow exception vs EU countries hospitals overwhelmed? ICU risk overwhelmed, lockdown? quite simple. guess Trump recently infiltrated them.

Sadly yes, tip pushed 0.26% infection fatality rate ""latest available science"" without providing studies, data back - going nearly serological studies estimates time.

For latest 6% push, amplified Trump, /r/conspiracy usual right wing sources CDC changed page draw attention based actual data: what's written death certificates. data provided searchable, still online believe, graph view ICD-10 codes associated. Sure enough, 6% time covid associated death. Normally combined acute respiratory cardio conditions, expect.

It useless factoid ever given, amplified far greater ever should, building previously laid foundations pre-existing conditions (ie expendable) ones worry.

Despite UK, 43% people applicable pre-existing conditions. Half family, certainly. US seem chosen ... neither saving economy lives ... torpedoed both. I'm Playa del Carmen right extremely limited exposure, seem taking pretty seriously here. resort 40% capacity. staff wear masks. guests required to, within 6' another guest besides wife whole stay. Taxis driver walled behind plexiglass (or something similar). bus required us temperature checked disinfect shoes (in addition hands) reason. swim cenote wearing mask.

I know numbers looking really bad Mexico overall, least feel like taking reasonable precautions even unreasonable ones least protect tourism industry people. experienced headaches almost daily lot life reccomend drinking water, trying assess anxiety finding ways get rid it. uncommon days row. grind teeth? 

I doubt mild headache going COVID. temperature anything? Swede don’t really want review countries’ responses, would like point Swedish strategy extremely consistent well communicated since March. might poor strategy compared countries, clear. 

I don’t feel said US. ignoring virus hard lockdown. States plan states don’t. Different messages depending day week. 

With current trajectory, I’m afraid find strategy **not** render result. worse. Like lot worse. :-( countries deaths even recorded. get buried familiy members. take death toll seriously Pakistan. doubt dude almost athletes gotten fine. It’s probably anxiety tbh  using glove size big. boy Joaquin Lopez Doriga keeping informed lol Oh please!

Do think situation would better PRI PAN implant running things?

Don’t forget political parties ruined country decades. 

I doubt AMLO president, Mexicans would openly burning dead streets “¡México cuenta contigo!” find survey studies convincing authors point limitations kinds studies. prove anything shows correlations based participates answers.I think read well. find interesting people participated protests significantly likely report family member covid-19 though. Overall, lack total corona spread reported states could explained literally dozens factors. think study nearly convincing think is. explained wanted comment quoted:

*""Police first ask wear it, comply write hefty fine, refuse cooperate like giving ID, arrested ""endangering public safety health""*

It's simple that. person cannot manage wear simple piece cloth faces refuse wear ""because muh rights"" get fucked. I'm asking sacrifice first born demon god, I'm asking wear something change course pandemic.

Yeah jailing might top, like killed somebody, I'm asking simple, considered wilfully putting public danger. Money. she, works out. guy work wore kind mask. Got sick something. Tested negative, still developed something like bronchitis kept weeks. Finally came back. Says thinks got breathing moisture mask...  uk? Kids leave home lot younger UK Europe IMK maybe ones parting live alone. Yes, need cases go further. Oh, worry, me, get persuading stage I'm far informed now. Going gold seems Based time alone havent sufficient trials. Sure might fine, safety procedures reason. enough sick, dead, anti-vax people country already. long. haha money printer go brr Feels like played.
Nothing makes sense anymore. April media pretty much every western country talking ""flattening curve"". way thinking would suggest countries attempting herd immunity well.

But guess still agree herd immunity end-goal. two ways reaching it: Vaccination natural spread. likely see combination two countries.

And read article, think really supports claim. quote thing remotely supporting whole text, open interpretation. time, also says things as:

*""I think overstated unique approach is. many countries, aim flatten curve, slowing spread much possible — otherwise health-care system society risk collapse.""*

I really goes hand-in-hand herd immunity strategy letting virus run wild.

Lastly, no, think Reddit decent source information - especially sub. People way stuck respective political camps seem unable see nuances kind. views issue based following news Swedish English, well watching press conferences able. Don’t act smug, live neighborhood we’re hardly ever see non-whites even though signs demanding people wear masks, muthafuckers friends using keeping distance. pretend I’m disabled carrying fucking stick stay fuck away feet me. They’ve got wrapped around wrists necks like idiots. People don’t give shit want die. one dumb thing here, mate 🙈 didn’t mean herd immunity, meant personal immunity gained contracting surviving Covid.  gotta start working Covid-20 Corruption plays major part. Resources go even properly distributed. dies, dies. Yes. long everyone wearing mask lot's sunlight...sure.

But, outdoor concert human rights protest? I'm understanding two things equal. Yeah know said bro somehow went vaccine foreseeable future see post like day later. mean, alive. remember. genuinely think people Jailed put piece cloth mouth.

""Being extremist wanting force people wear masks leave bad pandemic feel like.""

""Call extremist feel like people refuse wear masks jailed.""

so - wanting people wear mask, forcing people wear mask?

because one forgivable, given hysteria. psychopathic Ok vote me. Move Russia also helps contract tracers major cities weren’t allowed ask infected people actually attended protest.

Really easy dismiss something it’s willfully hidden. also stated doctors, spread petered two three cases. Lol 😂😂😂 makes sense , news perhaps looked imo hard fake death count, Pak obviously whining child following China. Bottom line: keep money. Put mask bang narrative that? We’ve always known false positives happen wanted catch every case. Health professionals known ages, it’s new rocket science. I’m sorry hear that. Thinking you. choice really have, would prefer give position idiot imbecile like rest government Gatell say say keep role least able input try make sure things get worse? president really give 2 shits people dying. Writing social media taken literally, figurative speech often verbal. even patients, doctors said get enough test kits test patients. means test used sensitive pick noninfectious virus. means positive. I

These tests designed find possible infections. issue get simple yes indication level virus. problem isn’t test, it’s way results presented binary. I’ve got friend honeymooning Cabo right now. 

I thought border closed too, guess not. course downvoted, believe ""weapon"" released either intentionally unintentionally, credible theories real scientists hypothesize virus around studied new WIV BSL4 lab got loose. don’t blame AMLO incompetent? North country.  People generally use masks bars, restaurants packed weddings going like nothing happening.  Same. irritating. dad initially like that, luckily rest us take seriously shamed started wearing mask. extended family, hand, mindset ""the scared likely get it"". keep wanting us wanting come over. mom every wants give feels bad thinks start thinking like them. Ive (verbally) knock head back multiple times. may wrong, got past ""wet market"" thing?

My understanding super spreader event may occurred *at* market evidence emerged actual source animal market.

In fact, recent publications seem cast serious doubt whole hypothesis. likely virus jumped animal human November instantly became perfectly adapted human virus.

See instance Mojang Miners Passage hypothesis.   can’t wait “look many cases Democrat run cities!!!!” memes remember people blaming trump trying reopen schools, Biden came last week saying this, everyone quite. Keep Vietnam! ;) Thanks mr bot, english sucks government failed us, simple comparing countries. obviously uncaring freak ignores common sense want argue. go daily life kill people. affects I'll sure find someone like minded like you. Everyone wants free insurance really money laundering scheme? La Paz, ig feed full morons partying right Freedumb post? Again, l recognize right wing bullshit (some mentioned) left wing bullshit, give pass to. Thank questioning narrative cares, give fckn vaccine already 1 1000 affected damaged hearts. even remotely close Wet markets states well, China it’s really like farmers market fresh food market. sketchy places sale shit isn’t good states considered wet markets called something else. Look slaughter NY, don’t remember it’s lamb there’s holiday it’s bloody mess streets. feel way. Gatell needs survive administration, cause better anyone Morena. 

Now everyone using gets threats hate... real acceptable alternative (not much power technically hands states) he's good can. Dude taken day 6 months evening reports everything foreseeable future either. Thankless position in..  Sure, implying COVID one those, listening experts. plenty jobs rate ""Just college"" small businesses. route personally took, know people still them. They're ones pay less going rate Engineer and/or crap management.

If can't find anything else, they're way start career, can't take enough varied experience find something better. say varied experience, businesses typically constantly short staffed learn jack trades.

One big problems business documentation always sucks since takes time, employee turnover high lessons re-learned again. I've literally seen issue crop less year, remembered oh yeah xxx fixed issue thing left. Bingo time already? sober person party.

I seen put way, exactly it. masks predominantly used source transmission are, fact, important piece NPIs. 1 2m insufficient. depressing read. mom mid 50s high blood pressure living mexicali, border town. recently phone call told sister law recently visited mom visiting someone Covid. sister law also family members die due covid. three children visited mom, children known carry Covid spread easily, i’m scared mom sure infected. i’m literally scared moms life pissed sister law stupid selfish putting moms life risk like this. unfortunately sister law stupid “no pasa nada guey” attitude. best get mom tested tell sister law visit mom, least there’s vaccine. could colleges broke Man, country fucked virus worst nightmare.

It's like phrase Rick Morty:

*If think Rick dead, he's alive, think safe, he's coming you!*

I resigned fact get fate roll dice me. think I've got good chance, knows... Mexican . People dont care . see lot people walking street without mask , touching merchandise chatting people virus exist . street full idiots die kill someone family , act like big deal welcome, important skill practice. Please tell Alaskans delivered somewhere lower 48 banned. Go ahead FedEx car back. Uh yes? base beliefs science includes peer reviewed study's data government agencies. said point lock flatten curve get cases 'to zero near zero"" back up.

Also good point! I’m actually impressed India’s low test-positivity rate 1) voted Hilary. would heart beat. Trump moron minimal ability look past tomorrow. 

2) moved entire business life online since March 2nd (do math - freaking cool received flack lot people hand). tried desperately get people listen. Friends, family, neighbors. Everyone looked like crazy. mom nurse NIH couldn’t even get stay inside weeks. People hear things authority figures/doctors guess can’t fully comprehend numbers. 

3) follow mathematical models daily. early March, actually formulated one based logistic differential equation. took assumptions probably inaccurate time. Daily growth 17% (probably estimated rate increase may limited testing availability) carrying capacity entire population. 3% death rate. results terrifying. also crude estimate. believe model quite accurate proven time time - Look estimates england Covid prevalence July. Compare article: lost yet? Pay close attention now. Look death rates NYC - city hit like hammer Covid anyone really knew respond. Consider relative portion deaths related nursing homes. Consider dumb Cuomo sending Covid positive folk back nursing homes. Democrats dumb things too...

5) national level, time anything came went March. found screaming television weeks Trump spoke. couldn’t believe ears. However, happy Larry Hogan handled crisis Maryland. Although now, I’m sure. 

6) meeting early March everything classified. timing makes think related imperial college London paper. decision clearly made allow virus spread society. 50,000 people diagnosed day right now, there’s really anything anyone stop point.

Dead. 1 wedding tiny town northern Maine + 65 guests + 0 masks + mask averse preacher (who flies back southern Maine defiantly holds Sunday service masks proudly worn)+ guest works southern county jail= 72 cases jail, one wore masks Maine’s biggest outbreak far 165 cases. beat, schools delayed opening risky . wedding people still unapologetic minister. indeed:) Yeah everyone comment section ignoring lot places aren’t offering refunds, really shitty. please one wedding vendors instead?? venue allowing us postpone December wedding “they can’t let everyone postpone there’s global pandemic” somehow feel completely safe 300 people wear masks 20 minutes indoor ceremony masks entire 4 hour indoor reception. well 50% guests traveling town. pointed said “well it’s like everyone’s gonna come anyways mean let’s real it’s global pandemic you’ll lucky get even half that” like yes EXACTLY. also said everything going “completely fine” “November” aka elections it’s possible people get covid wedding go back rest families spread everyone Christmas (which right within window people would first start showing symptoms get wedding). 

We obviously still postponing planning waiting closer still prove without shadow doubt covid still, fact, around makes mad dense vendors care getting money people’s lives. long ago France kicking ass Generally speaking, conservatives ones denying virus exists posting amateur epidemiology videos facebook. Liberals believe real wear masks. also come ridiculous rationales still want do. Especially kids justify impossible stay home kids. Sure, really needed fly across country go gym kids. I'm honestly disgusted liberals taking seriously conservatives know virus dangerous choose make selfish choices anyway. Weddings waste money anyways. I've to/seen billion wedding pics couple done years later. Focus love devotion union, positive ready commitment....instead worrying weeding pics look instagram. would love get married now, perfect excuse tiny tiny wedding. single spread 400,000 event headlines here!

A single spread single protest event made headline when?

Open fucking eyes wedding supposed Halloween year. ended delaying year. wife got married friend's porch years ago. small group friends celebrate.

We larger outdoor ""second wedding"" family parents friends parents lake house brother ""officiating"".

People need first grandiose wedding middle global pandemic selfish. Zuckerberg Hall Medicine FBU Glad you’re feeling better. guess feel sense security we’re pretty confident chances reinfection, least short term pretty low. it’s 2020, buy shit! Yeah it’s stupid. You’ll either get strip mall wedding wait forever. mothers house turned amazing. Tell fucking dumbass, someone else delayed wedding. Like can't wait while? S.O run away waiting? live alone, would able pass someone? That's cool. Thank sincerely taking one team. I'll watch invitation. hurry. Four funerals wedding. Somebody make movie. think visited facilities you’d understand remote inspections would sufficient. also ignores deliveries maintenance facilities require, medical equipment needs maintained delivered daily, outside rehab, wound care etc. 

These places mostly staffed low paid low skilled workers likely can’t quarantining time even wanted to. I’m sure many mistakes made comes protecting elderly IMO doesn’t sound like something reckless line facilities operating day day. quarters 2 3 bedrooms

*laughs studio apartment* Married wife courthouse went back hometown ceremony wedding mom family. 30 years still told mom already married came ""the wedding"" even slept couch visit would wrong sleep fiance since yet married. boom, that's people going weddings. know two couples reschedule venues vendors fighting tooth nail keep deposits even try charge reschedule.

Vendors venues working class people needs money. People getting married can't afford lose thousands deposits. Nobody wants lose money go ahead it.

If Trump's government cared small business much cared bailing big boys. vendors venues could claim losses couples would able get money back. Congratulations! agree. don’t understand lack concern global pandemic. misinformation superhighway part problem. I've removed thread, problem repeatedly called someone else stupid sub rules. keep comments civil problem. wrong. Big deal post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* average person actually understand germ theory. I'm amazed think getting kicked school violating pandemic-related restrictions somehow qualifies 'fine print.' main point fail grasp student already taken item value university, seat semester. can't returned student would otherwise taken gone. Therefore university right keep money. 

Your examples related all. case real loss value. saying university shoulder cost rather student blatantly violated code well aware of. acquaintance mine haven’t seen months Covid back June posted FB week wants get married ASAP, she’s waiting 3 years. like WTF mother law fiancée want get married anytime soon? seriously don’t understand people delayed next year.. assuming we'll end cancel elope based way people acting. believe corona civil empathic, follow government guidelines wear mask. That’s family decided do. family wedding planned fall. Due covid longer guests. even grandparents safety. bride groom, parents brother sister. covid control next year, plan hold official reception couples 1st wedding anniversary. sucks things could planned long realization plans drastically change covid got much worse cities reopened people didn’t heed covid safety rules. prevent taking money apparently. Pot, kettle...  Good considerate human. year anniversary party sounds awesome anyway! leaders engineering science backgrounds. *generic statement coronavirus wants this*

+200 upvotes CDC released study, says expect 400k total deaths January nothing changes.

250k mask mandates implemented nationally

600k+ mask wearing stops Congratulations! Something celebrate now, something look forward celebrating future. Wishing two best! Literally situation I'm now. Sister-in-law postponed wedding May. Wedding today. Wife drove 8 hours her, we're told 19 guests everyone would wear masks.
Showed yesterday rehearsal, 23 ppl nobody wearing masks. 
I'm beyond pissed. wife pregnant first child came assurance everyone would acting safety mind familial guilt/pressure.

We've wearing masks constantly around all. We're getting tested soon get home. favorite string comments I’ve ever read Reddit. I’m actually dying laughing.  Yeah, right? family member mine went outside BBQ appropriate social distancing masks hour. nurse friend showed sans mask started hugging everyone, caused everyone start breaking protocol.

C’mon man could never ever get friends family.....why? doubt would. probably didn’t plan well enough. “Most liberal.” gross become politicized (which mean you’re incorrect). Florida, ignores news media, talks god lot... Yup, know need woman.

I hope kid recovers survives age gtfo family. JFK died bullet, bullet. American, agree shocking amount selfish counts here. unselfish people. Wish more. honeymoon ICU followed early widowhood. Thank bro appreciate &lt;3 

I agree children definitely back school, science subjects practicals big part it, difficult online, think moved university back year, way no-one misses least true. someone back NYC probably blew Italy months ago. Hold gun someone's head long enough longer becomes tool fear... saw someone drinking public fountain yesterday almost puked. big gap taking care mental health 200 person get together. China Russia already deploying Some, feels like political race public health one though Hope affected could've seriously quarantined month, seen friends/family time, mostly control. thanks asshats think gatherings size okay, probably seeing parents, friends, loved ones looooong time.

It's 6 months, places mostly control, places, hopefully get people think okay gather.  husband court-housed it. even party we're introverts get exhausted social gatherings. lol. families understood. Well football here. watched local game last night even though social distancing place every crowd shot people yelling masks on. hear you...but, honestly, need work. demand plenty events lined folks willing exercise safety measures adhere contract requirements. But...I get it...the risk money certainly, understandably, outweigh risks potentially catching covid. New wedding ideas.... FB live reception. Romeo Juliet wedding, two people priest outside safety. Wallstreet divesting tech. know shit ending. Reddit, favorite talking heads calling reopen soon enough you. ignorant, they’re selfish assholes. There’s huge difference. Worldmeters says India conducted 35,332 tests per million, one lowest ratios world.

BTW, testing ramped dramatically last 5 weeks, much lower. Many covid-19 infections deaths never recorded such.

That's wtf mean. Yeah mean never said everyone liberal anymore loser....../s I’m boat, girlfriend’s work friend (both nurses) wedding month. found potential heart condition told I’m risking (I’m also epidemiology student). seriously considering leaving it. 

I’ve never met bride, groom anyone else there. yeah, *I’m* selfish. similar thing happened Maine, actually. bunch cases outbreaks traced back one wedding north Bangor. hope nyc next. corona over. time get back work. absolutely correct, votes give pretty good idea morals ""compassion"" people sub, case doubt.

I'm glad folks supported banks great recession. can't afford loan, why'd sign dotted line, amirite? Nope, nothing predatory all. I’m glad gorgeous wife able wedding beginning January shit truly hit fan states. even got married country family there. ""He part help social security crisis collecting benefits"" 9 months people still can't get shit together. selfishness astounding. There's also r/weddingshaming general wedding drama/idiots. Looooots dumb COVID brides recently.... Isn’t gigantic lawsuit opportunity? know right.


Clear evidence sjws taken sub. Perhaps ask boss ban smoking vaping company property part pandemic safety strategy, assuming even one all. ""Causes mild fever people"" means people get fever all. means anyone trial would definitively able determine received vaccine saline. Uruguay's numbers stable around 100-200 active cases (165 yesterday) , things could easily go wrong, let's hope don't. Unfortunately many think risk already Uruguay like somehow fundamentally different Argentina Brazil, that's nonsense.

We mandatory local elections 27th (they supposed back May pandemic), mask social distance required temperature controls. hope elections cause much spread. I've two friends reschedule weddings I'll tell couples. Venues vendors absolutely refusing refund deposits even trying charge reschedule dates. could fight court would take forever honestly people kind people go getting contract lawyer pursuing thieves. Sometimes couples screwed choice take risk lose thousands dollars. never broad lockdown like India did. literally US do. far okay. cases well managed, reputation people keep ease. 

Every time new case comes shut whole city. on. What's death certificate, can't photo copied sort online system? curious. One coworkers getting married month New Hampshire 100 confirmed attendees. thinks fine breaking rules people decide wear mask should, nothing it.

""What supposed do? can't make anyone wear mask!""

Of course can. bride controlling every aspect wedding. question. many areas india, people live work tight quarters. Example slums. someone identified positive, say fever, would hospitalized asked quarantine home? assume would mixed (depending location income) latter, would forced ignore quarantine due need income. Color surprised. Reminded idiots killed pregnant colleague.
 Small samples, theory thing land borders closed. Doesn’t mean scientists cannot come valid vaccines. Please try allow nationalism sinophobia cloud judgement sacrifice millions Americans prove point. also live Ontario. I'd agree go store says ""mask use required"" people wearing masks.

But also live apartment building mask use elevator probably 50%. thanks :) ""Nobody could seen coming.""

Yeah I'm tiring to... never said Sweden restrictions, said Sweden among most.

Many countries surprised virus initially, like instance Serbia, basically opened completely. 

Let’s also forget index cite index government action, including things like economic measures, measure many restrictions population has. ehat I've heard, leadership basically Trump steroids Ten days ago lot schools started classes yet students campus yet. know plenty wait till Labor Day school year start. going get worse. so? Vaccines require long lasting immunity work. established Covid19 immunity lasts around 3 months. want get vaccine every 3 months it? 


There vaccine body build long lasting immunity covid19. need figure manage treat virus unfortunately long term immunity thing. agree, go me. flu life. miserable, tolerable. Following year got flu shot hospitalized weeks later got worse flu symptoms ended pneumonia. captain obvious It’s go *think* random sex strangers. reality they’re tripping balls dry humping mannequin, part art installation. Agreed! People working ever. also, talking China Russia here. many countries best friends haha occasional cases don’t prove general rule. kid, sister knew someone got chickenpox twice, what? didn’t worry whether I’d get again, there’s vaccine. guess think world leaders health medical leaders shutdown society billionaires ceos politicians agreed idiots?

Thank confirming dense moron. difference temporary shutdown mitigate virus vaccine developed allow safe return normality, permanent shutdown.

In permanent shutdown companies go bust, putting huge pressure governments trying handle influx requiring support, mention deterioration mental health. 

Not mention peoples resolve patience finite. mention people become complacent.

Your idea still social distancing years laughable, shows deluded dense touch dumbass could therapy, swift reality check. vaccines take years develop, test administer. typical time frame isn’t due lack effort.

Here's funny thing. due lack effort. Vaccines normally produced hundreds millions phase 3 trials. rarely willing risk money risk Phase 2 3 entrants running concurrent earlier phases. exactly ""effort,"" sheer rate spread rare. many vaccines phase 3 trials tens thousands new cases daily.

The post long winded response claiming admin's botching medications (HCQ blood plasma) undermined public trust politicization vaccine approval undermine trust.

It was, honestly, lot words say much easily defeated this:

1. exist Drug agencies world. look guidance.

2. 50M people vaccine, going LOT data efficacy. get 50M people (the first 100M doses 2 doses person im understanding OWS correctly) willing risk less effective vaccine get vaccine. 50M quickly convince holdouts effective. 

That 30%-75% number above? There's reason big swing. talking theoretical. Give rm actual vaccine actual world people going flock vaccination side. People worried ""rushed"" vaccine. Start pumping full PR fears go away. fun anniversary memory. “Remember killed uncle Jack?” happens little education society. Could minor:

eg. swelling, fever

Could serious. Examples:

* paralysis polio vaccine
* actually get disease vaccinated Tell planet collectively destroying life forms bad trump isn’t competent enough. yet Maybe they""ll start dispensing 9mm lead antivirals speed recovery. Trump like *Yes we're first now*

Rest Americs 🙇🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ China inflicted upon world hiding early stages pandemic. boo-hoo Thanks thoughts. curious - school get medical degree from? read **no national tracking system**, colleges making rules tally infections. Times’s survey believed comprehensive account available, also near-certain undercount. Among colleges contacted Times, many **published case information online responded requests case numbers**, least 360 others ignored inquiries refused answer questions. 170 reported zero cases.  write anything. pretty obvious &lt;--- Sounds eerily like Nepal. mean imply that, guess could said say ""to date"" fared better neighbors fewer deaths. situation ever changing. one knows future bring, right US Sweden tragic. Remember, it’s okay stand streets shoulder shoulder tens thousands people screaming hours time, couple friends immediate family members decide barbecue outside take boat Labor Day weekend, literally genociding eleventy gazillion grammas. Hope change you. Keep right things! Yea 50, like 99% make it.....but cost?

Might permanent physical effects

You might spend weeks alone ICU, fuck head up

That long hospital visit....did forget free? Congrats! survived Coronavirus try survive $1,000,000 worth medical debt! chin strap people...

I refer ballchinians.

Or dicknose There's good reason anti-vaxxers exist right now.

However, rushed vaccine could actually lead negative consequences. COVID vaccine gets distributed serious side effects (the type would prevented vaccine given public normal consequnces), could really solidify/increase anti-vaxxer contingent. know Sep 6 new thread day still yet made?

Anyway, low 59BPM resting heart rate.

Should concerned? That’s minimum (1 representative + 2 senators), can’t fewer. Holy smokes it’s control there. Goes narrative JaCinDa sLAy quEen 👸 USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!.... oh bad. I've lived long. Everytime see article something ""more"" ""greater"" presume good thing. Silly me.  didn’t download shit cdc. Liar. Yes, Winnie _____. another thing guess new counting deaths. fight virus 28 days die counts covid death fight virus 29 days even longer die count covid death. makes scense use word hero lightly Reddit think applies grim reaper dude. He's lawyer hero. You’d overbook semester begins. everyone hating dan tho “college supposed crazy fun time life”

And may never free college available US. everyone luxury treating college education like 4 year party. neighborhood grew Catholic school, right next church. primarily italian neighborhood. anymore. Church school closed neighborhood longer italian. Time changes things. think sometimes related younger people leaving. Back day suppose families stood close proximity other, much. Hysterics dont help taking good shape Sorry, English first language You’re right, one complete betrayal people sworn protect us, continue unless something done.

Some things worth risking life for. get flu shot then, least already tested. saying Sweden done good anything, saying like pandemic over? district least semi-responsible, PAPER, going back. 5 options total: Full day face face, five days week, hybrid half day face face 5 days week, online home, online school (isolation pods Zoom real time teachers another part school), thumb drive, work done Chromebook, saved thumb drive swapped week. moved start date twice, parents expected wanted face face option, moved reduce numbers. Masks mandatory everyone 2 unless outside eating eliminated bussing hybrid students.  


But drive past middle school every week go pick lunches materials virtual students, shitshow person. Since kids masked outside, one choosing be, including teachers. kids grouped together outside activities, 50-60 time distancing. huddle stare others phones last week, sort activity split groups 10, huddled heads together. first outbreak day one week one second third day, day four week one. improved since then. first elementary school announce yesterday due outbreak, reopening Labor Day, students moving virtual education least 2 weeks. someone finally made move, others go like dominoes. schools district 6 times last 2 weeks (kids every district school means material pickup schools.) never asked copy ""mandatory health form"", never verbally screened temperature checked never seen anyone else asked complete form verbally asked questions it. nailed word tantrum. 

In western societies, 15-30% us throw tantrum rebel whenever asked/told something weren’t planing do.

Other societies learned either comply either due authoritarian government higher education understanding aren’t centre world. part annoys end. something throw antibiotics cus virus. Something DNA never seen, genetic code mankinds existence seen it. Yet motherfuckers still understand that. spread symptoms mimic flu? Yes cus respiratory illness damn flu! 

Don't worry though, new covid task force advisor god damn neuroradiologist. sounds smart anti maskers title pushing herd immunity. realize need experience neck injuries moving heads agreement every stupid thing thay comes current administrations mouth. upvote everybody ITT says deleted Facebook 😁 realization we’re developed all. crisis nothing compared global warming still recklessly blindly accelerating.

As much shitshow think 2020 been, disaster awaits children grandchildren’s time devastating. Ok bro Yeah Canada paradise compared Mexico USA total cases new cases. Also Canadians seems smarter me. 18, 8. great example everyone belongs college. Yes different AIDS. AIDS spreads slowly kills people decades. understand idea many places able identify virus, parts world, would noticed overflowing cemeteries. Right you're.

Whatever you’re seeing pretty good indicative numbers north too. stopped testing instead. That’s good news may loop, sorts potential issues vaccine candidates?

eg. Maybe virus mutates quickly one vaccine give good immunity beyond months. Story high cases Mexico:

The closest Ive heard dentist know recently two days feeling kind ill feverish cough lost smell/taste day 5 confirmed Covid. True miss fairs festivals most. painful seeing dates come go favorite festivals happen. But... gotta gotta do.

The virus decides reopen, political rhetoric. US screwed then. learned treat effectively, especially drugs respitory therapy work best Serves dumbasses right. Nah. NYC 20% positive antibody testing back April today likely herd immunity based case numbers, everyone afraid admit implication. could get everyone infected within couple weeks partied / protested hard enough. You’re part problem then. least 100 times fault shithole. surely love special eternal worth dozens deaths (considering ripple effect) end, right? mean romantic caused mom literally gasp breath.

You made good decision. Wish people like that. amount reports far between. Especially many cases have. Based every case we’ve seen rare. rare. SURVEY QUESTION CONTINUE READING CONTENT

Cancer website. resolve lack seeing whole article real quick. called closing it, better source please. Considering population India, predictable. Many folks didn’t believe India could #1 this. also testing lot hope pharmaceutical industry comes sort vaccine produce millions approved vaccine. However, seem leader complete waste. need birth. didn’t answer questions? protesters? insisting reported data wrong? keep saying things proof back up.

You actually posted yesterday contagious time exposure 7-10 days afterward.

So clue you’re talking grudge anyone protesting basic human rights. We’re attending zoom wedding couple
Of weeks. Yep, little state famous royal f-up. yeah one wedding did, went services pay rest deposit services cover. even get tip lol. two pretty large deposits decided work events i'm financial position right give back. sources? time start charging people Reckless Engagement. Hold couple, venue, officiant responsible actions. explain this? knew back February national leaders choose anything problem isn’t taxes, I’d gladly pay fund public schools. you’re right, one’s forcing kids go there, that’s point. schools backed religion, put religion school (some others, less). point religion belongs three places; church, home, heart believer - school. happening over. check data state county, cases school added yet. local college 500+ positives last week, data county half that. sure happening. life worth window dressing wedding photos. values understand. doesn’t understand, she’s worthy friendship.

Stay safe well. solves nothing. people shamed motivated even resistant advice get. It’s nothing catharsis shaming. 99% time happen them.

There approximately 2.5 million weddings per year US according Wikipedia. Suppose 1 thousand led super-spreader event. weddings canceled weddings went on, would 2500 super-spreader event annually -- one super spreader event every three half hours, average. Los Angeles yeah restrictions state especially hard warrant precautions I've taking since February. used poster child COVID prevention. I'm honest? I'm burnt out. care anymore. I'm 20 year old guy. smoke anymore. lungs healthy. live alone at-risk people building. get it, get it, worry anymore little while. Whats worst happen? “He underlying condition.” Ikr? could believe it. maybe six weeks starting February felt like long lucid nightmare, trapped surreal funhouse distorting mirrors, I’d wake worse. worse. I’ve adjusted fact are. Interfering power charged terrorism ask me. harms much plenty us. i'm living fear also recognize living normal times right aren’t dying. Deaths fallen. 1/2 deaths occurred nursing home New York. Thanks cuomo. 70% deaths US nursing homes. Normal healthy people issues this. Sick people take precautions Flu would fine. trust Oxford vaccine since adapted previous vaccines shown safe. Still I'd rather take vaccine appears safe risk long term effects actual virus.  Yeah, even get started steroids. saw first ENT 13 days symtoms told steroids cause ended visit without prescribing them, 2 weeks later hearing test said needed told hearing loss, likely virus, almost month out. always wonder treated day even hearing could come back clogged ear feeling there. Liberal - wedding scheduled next weekend decided push April. still uncertain things April don’t want give venue additional money. shitty situation can’t finalize date next deposit side it’s non refundable deposit (no force majure clause). wedding process trying supportive spouse it’s day always dreamed kid  one criticism, sound like someone spends lot time comparing China Nazi Germany internet putting hood driving around smash local Asian owned businesses. five head wedding. sucked, worthless started somehing ended years later divorce.

Its worth it. next time, all. five head wedding option. Same! ""I'm sorry, able attend wedding. hope beautiful weather day, wish every joy life together. registered?"" send gift.

Anyone can't see sense really needs reassessed friend, side event.  people fucking learn lmao think wont happen anyone care about. family supposed family reuinion summer approximately 2-300 people attendance. big family. People email train kept saying cant delay give fear jesus protect us GO DISNEY PANDEMIC. 

I said wanted delay next summer. Everyone piled me. 

So said disease like 5% death rate. Higher risk. family lot risk. everyone wanted go send list 30 people family okay dying reunion. 

You think big deal? think thats low death rate? Cool. Let know okay dying dont delay disney. Share person. want say ""I'm fine death ride rollercoasters"". 5% would 15 risk age people want pick double. Uncle dave old cant breath hes gonner. Jim hella issues. Pick. Choose dies fun. 

The reunion rescheduled January reputation mean. didnt even try make pick would disabled. :( think missed point--just smell something mean virus particles getting scent particles considerably smaller virus particles hitching ride even larger molecules.

I disagreeing anything saying last line. real issue wedding insurance doesn’t cover pandemics. fiancé booked venue late October back January. venues life support is, refunding anything. fiancé would lose 30k party never happened. getting married late October even handful us. family currently treating like shit come cousin's wedding. 125 guests, 10 agreed wear masks. Guess I'm asshole. evidence would rare? Corruption. simple. Look shit trump gets away Republican bats eye it. know make sense. Heard / spots. brother EMT area. usually spent day summer getting lost back roads. Last time, found two mature cannabis plants side road Home Depot buckets.  

I'm north suburbs miss mountains valleys.  miss lack diversity! But, something cold Coke pack peanut butter nabs lazy summer day. stop every country store find. people selfish value lives neighbors. absolutely idiots. Don’t allow group awfulness stop responsible person. Lockdowns never worked, delay inevitable. could work lockdown cure vaccine invented, since happened lockdown ever worked people need go eventually. Casual friend dude you’ve met once? You’re non-expected attendee designated gift giver. diving into? parent's basement, I'd wager. really though. 3.9 mil “closed cases” (recovered dead) America, 193K died, 5%. you’d expect ~3 deaths (2.8) 56 confirmed COVID cases, though obviously varies widely age (near 0% 40, 10%+ 70), estimate would vary widely depending got sick. Zero deaths would pretty unlikely, though.

The real COVID death rate likely like 1-2%, asymptomatic (or lightly symptomatic) cases, false negative tests, people refusing get tested, etc. stat 56 confirmed cases, ~3 deaths good estimate, without knowing ages. That’s all? That’s bad them, complete denial anything bad happen outcome. Point stories like this, wedding three people (so far) died due second-hand exposure, they'll say ""yeah, could get car accident way wedding, live lives!"" niece huge wedding November.....in Georgia. tons people coming state according wedding website none wearing masks fiance covid denier. parents high risk. parents thankfully told coming wanted live see children part lives. going. Tons blowback, hey still going alive. Fucking hell something new here. math, you’ll know 5% lot lives don’t need lost. don’t really think it’s okay nonchalant millions people dying. matter phrased it. make sound like Americans' fault trust there's plenty us sane people stuck plenty insane people elsewhere. true use word strain way much, probably two strains isolate came Italy long predicted new strain based sequence way viruses acquire minute genetic changes reproduce spread. changes rarely impact fitness ability compete. SARS-CoV-2 variant circulated earliest regional outbreaks lacked D614G mutation dominating much world.

But so-called “founder effect,” seen small number variants fan wide population, chance? Choe Farzan believe biochemical experiments settle question.

“There least dozen scientific papers talking predominance mutation,” Farzan says. “Are seeing ‘founder effect?’ data nails it. founder researchers found phenotype difference resulting mutation probably effects well invades cells would new strain.

shouldn't matter duo found immune factors serum infected people work equally well engineered viruses without D614G mutation. That’s hopeful sign vaccine candidates development work variants without mutation, Choe says. Congratulations, crazy newlywed Sex enjoy time together celebrate hopefully next year way 1st envisioned it!!! Yeah, it’s good valid pedestal. often native speakers fail basics: than/then, its/it's, where/were/we're etc.
And there's abomimation:""should of"" Sir please order leave Wendy's. first article identified pandemic originating china tho. definition, pandemic technically started China hospitalization. 

Maybe patient zero came somewhere else, pandemic definitely started China wife legit way big wedding. cousin, guy I've never even met, invites Jesusy rednecky I'd say there's 98% chance nobody wearing mask.

I'm gonna die. Til death us part It’s also possible tests false positives Mosquitoes, oof 30 percent saying refuse vaccine, speed deployment tomthose wanting it. masks entire 4 hour indoor reception.

Right, venue thinks guests wear masks food drink instantly teleports stomachs.  fine line 'do wish harm others' rule would auto-ban erred side giving benefit doubt banning you. gets worse here. longest period widespread testing wasn’t thing. They’re picking almost 100k cases day testing become widespread meaning it’s spreading communities while, I’ll bet breach 100k day overtake US overall cases within weeks. rare go based numbers available. Also, experts mention saying otherwise. know better saying reinfection common occurrence. sure going this. nice weekend. people wedding charged costs paid state. Cite source CDC said NINETY PERCENT false positive. blatantly false Uh... blaming culture literally saying.  depressive found ways cope follow safety guidelines.

* buy groceries pickup ( need get store even COVID surface groceries, risk low any)
* Curbside pickup eating 
* Wear masks times maintaining distance
* Talk individuals/friends outdoors mask maintaining distancing

It's hard. also understand people can't cope way. feel need hit bars feel better big crowd gathering. honestly, part history good way (for family general global history). ""We followed rules, stayed safe, historically relevant photos memories"" point....why ceremony parents siblings live broadcasting wedding instagram something friends loved ones?  think anyone would say killing millions civilians Iraq Afghanistan whatever. sad favor sanctioning international investigators trying bring perpetrators justice. Maine! Change codes dominated Covid testing equipment sold prior generic database identifiers. Way Back Machine records data start September 4th probably required first responders. flu shot  bat lol think there's real suggestion alcohol significant factor, though binge drinking depress immune system. usually temporary. theory nowadays wedding initial stress test see couple functions stressful situation involving lots money, lots family, lots logistics. Good. That's needs said. Google CEPI. Thank Bill Gates Ebola. Haha lol. What’s reality situation Sherlock? 
People dead dying, keep spreading it, let’s anything different guess. That’s genius!! scheduled wedding 2021, loophole. One wife's friends going forward wedding weeks. wife bridesmaid. Neither us happy played out. We're still weighing options, state story I'm leaning towards ""sorry, knew postponing, here's cash spent plates.""  see comments many US citizens paying nothing tests ? buy lotto ticket. odds tho... virus endemic like H1N1 flu viruses. way eliminate fully. shot months ago. late. mean, legal ""wedding"" sounds boring hell would never expect people replace actual ceremony, definitely worth waiting properly enjoy covid public school teacher dating parochial school teacher, actually think pretty complete picture specific topic discussion.

But don’t let truth get way “religion bad” circlejerk. people suffer students. think underestimating insidiousness narcissistic people. think terms; they'll say ""Oh, I'm sure happy got live long enough see get married."" CDC used one would [Reminds Happy are, six months later, people still shocked would outcome.

SMFH... wedding big dream people romanticize about. Also dreams implanted society wants spend lot wedding since makes lot people rich. need buy diamond ring show good mate even though price kept artificially high due cartel diamond little practical value. nice. Stressful sometimes. bought $300-$500 cars help fund renovations. would drive cheap cars mainly routine maintenance. quit, would junk $300. Completely disagree here. talk opportunity cost neglecting consider opportunity cost booking couple would reschedule vs would reschedule. Rescheduling incredibly common, almost standard right industry (source: rescheduled 20 weddings past 4 months) put burden pandemic completely onto vendors shoulders fair all.

I understand situation awful everyone, care couples truly feel bad additional stress causing them. But, I’m person also losing almost everything year. keep deposit I’m profiting coming top, I’m literally putting food table keeping lights on. don’t want downsize, reschedule, work within state’s guidelines wedding free options idea couples financial responsibility everyone else around absurd me. 

If you’re refusing allow couples reschedule charging so, that’s another story. try understanding hope couples able same. adults work together navigate thing way works best all. idea would die badly could effected it. 

I know i've never tested antibodies back february got sick worst cough i've ever had. literally laying floor weekend exhausted get eat anything. thought got better throughout week hit hard next weekend. I'm someone easily bike 50+ miles half day something kicked ass February. feel like body same. I'm old immune deficiencies. study flawed. question “would take first one” “would take vaccine” Mesmerizing football world since 2002. RIP Metsu. That’s fine, can’t deny massive societal chaos upheaval people become sterile once. sure got idea, case would individual tested positive.

Had said would never go damn wedding anyway. COVID great excuse politely tell fuck off. Thanks COVID! Fauci said “normal people” expect 2nd quarter 2021 mean, perspective 5% seem like lot put terms see amd understand. 

I used similar thing takijg course community college bunch fresh high school anti-vaxers who'd never thought older fence. (Wrote paper presentation senior class pictures 5-10 years including years high school started crossing faces out.) Back May, dad's farm workers would steal entire boxes masks cases hand sanitizer. Guaranteed hospital workers stealing them. Well somebody’s going be. There’s really way without cases exactly Vietnam “not equipped” handle this? 2,200 foreigners living Da Nang tested, recent outbreak was, every single one negative. mean said back February maybe, seven months later, bars, restaurants, everything back normal. state gave go-ahead high school sports yesterday Michigan. governor done good job seems caving GOP legislature pressure. dumb IMO.. 20 generations 0.3 reproductive rate flu (comparable amount we've reduced COVID's reproductive rate) would reduce 10^6 active infections 10^(-5). husband (planned court house marriage anyway). husband, myself, officiant one witness. going move “reception” August things going decided next year, maybe. Depends continues. really matter, 10-20 million people measure immunity helpful getting R value down. already tens millions now, point like...there's many people country. can't wait see results RNC Continuous decline. good news ❤️ That’s did. Fortunately even got bit fun date legal marriage. got married Feb 29 legally. don’t even worry anniversary 4 years anyhow, maybe ceremony next year planned (our officiant photographer super okay part reason someone dies.). Friday like did. pick dates.

I got amazing venue 7 months notice that, 150 participants 2 couldn’t make nothing Friday Individual responsibility works sort social contract place. isn’t Yes, that's much relevant population density alone.

I stats 2008 might changed lot, Sweden single individual households Denmark, Sweden also three-generational households Denmark (0,3% vs 0,1%).

I think single households make bigger difference lot them. way single households good reducing spread, households lot people really bad try keep virus away elderly people. Going wedding today afternoon. Small, outside, masked, socially distanced. 

This behavior, weddings. Thank wearing mask. wedding coming I'm obligated go. know lot people going go well feeling people wear mask :/ dont want go.... Ugh I'm kinda worried too. grandparents going :/ also think going indoors Yeah, never gonna work. thing happen NFL. can’t really make games football start multiple teams missing games scheduling logistics make impossible. Source 20% positive April?

Also realize crazy death toll healthcare crisis NYC right? acceptable sacrifice willing make even people let go mortal shells though painful preventable disease? laugh suggest go church choir practice leaving it.....she obviously zero concern health Anything avoid holding Communist Chinese Party accountable. county switch mail get license! kinda hope sticks. what’s wrong society.

*and say looking post history. You’re mess need sort out. * That's said! Japan might already one.. internal contention whether it’s rushed doesn’t sufficient clinical trials eloped Hawaii spent wedding money bomb ass honeymoon. 100% would (except missile thing happened day wedding lol) FFS Every weekend church there’s wedding. Haven’t seen mask yet, spike cases, going months.  happened individual responsibility. e told need do, let Darwin handle rest.  People understand virus evolve start even deadly. past week I've started nightmares go normal things everything completely normal. Like go mall shop coworkers there. half-way suddenly remember middle pandemic nobody wearing mask social distancing I'm probably infected. new ""I test study despite graduating 20 years ago"" nightmare. talking mom upcoming 'family event celebrate things miss' (around 100 people, masks), included ""So get figure many immediate family dying next weeks.""

I accused 'afraid shadow' point.

Some people unsalvageable. one saying 100% anti maskers republicans.

But Republican party literally president denying covid / masks, vast majority lawmakers following lead. States Republican governors much likely fully open schools, less likely proper mask distancing mandates.

There LOT liberals democrats anti mask dumbasses. minority, vast, vast majority republicans anti-mask dumbasses. People saw happening went ""this fake, need mask! need lockdown!"" wish elopers smart two. 

Hope two healthy happy marriage 

(While others unhealthy semi happy marriage) There's 24 vaccines development, seen positive results vaccines phase 2 3 testing particularly complex problem (unlike HIV). ""The decision attend high-risk event self-quarantine resulted others getting sick,"" said. ""The common thread stories pandemic, one person's actions decisions affect themselves. need people understand risk tolerance ability shrug COVID mean can't pass others ... none us island.""

This issue hand whole time. people stop caring? RIP implement thoughts everyone’s mind? Thank you. Common sense racist guyz close relative announced rescheduled wedding December October (as moved wedding COVID) inviting least 100 people indoors it’s okay, church large enough inside everyone spread without masks. refuse outside anywhere, whine it’s hard plan wedding covid (but they’ve engaged 2 years people postponing modifying wedding outside??) It’s story Jedi would tell you. It’s Sith legend. Darth Plagueis Dark Lord Sith, powerful wise could use Force influence midichlorians create life… knowledge dark side could even keep ones cared dying. dark side Force pathway many abilities consider unnatural. became powerful… thing afraid losing power, eventually, course, did. Unfortunately, taught apprentice everything knew, apprentice killed sleep. Ironic. could save others death, himself. Didn’t say living best life? US charging arm leg COVID 19 test

....where? I've zero issues getting free tests, questions asked Indiana Pennsylvania. I'm really hoping social distancing limit normal flu season, balance covid.

Meaning hospitals overwhelmed less flu cases room covid.

I gotta keep hope. can't speak rest country hopeful Washington state. wear mask problem so. point people come act like masks end stopping this. states mask mandates pretty high percentage compliance Covid rates still high? [Le mostly I'm sorry, flat incorrect. Tables family members/ spouses already live together, tables minimum 6 feet apart, masks worn outside eating drinking. Also, like said, easy say involved, one right mind cancel paid-for wedding lose thousands dollars put it. course, want typical Redditor put forth ""well akshully"" response, sure, could cancel entire wedding, could also take money bank accounts light fire, beyond idiotic. Unless 275 people make entire population 9 Minnesota counties, quite understand title.

Whatever happened correlation always causation? 

FYI, think incredibly stupid wearing masks, embellish title, OP?

***

Imagine one wedding COVID-19, alternative title would ""56 COVID cases 9 Minnesota counties."" problem. let move date within year moved November seems it’ll still unsafe. I’m going lose first downpayment/half payment 1.5k wedding next summer. get you’re saying agree extent, someone make decision tell it’s simple. already live together 2 years. want start family that. Even though neither us conservative religious, it’s still simple popping one out. COULD try squeeze baby new 2021 date, best case scenario, get lucky immediately gets pregnant, gives birth couple months wedding, plan around infant probably go honeymoon. Worst case, gets pregnant little later expected get married she’s many months pregnant, can’t drink, can’t fit dress, horrible uncomfortable whole time, stuff. 

Plus, there’s wedding planning anxiety hovers you’re planning. Even pandemic, ways really wanted get wedding day felt like nothing else planned we’re planning this. Wedding planning takes lot time attention. dominates conversations family. there’s also legal stuff - wife without health insurance since furloughed due Covid. Despite together 5 years living together 2, couldn’t add insurance legally married. living America without health insurance like playing Russian roulette every day. little injury accident enough completely F life. extremely happy relieved wait another year officially legally married. simple, logical answer. wants risk death friend parent. Parties wait. get one life. 200% this

I try empathy route particular folks can't fathom ""someone else"". ""someone directly connected talking right now"" gets through. many deaths? long quarantine wedding scheduled mid-September back July. hard decision sucks reschedule something planning year, easy decision we're narcissistic enough risk friends family, even small ceremony. Anyway, comes point want associate important life event year that's overwhelmingly shitty. lies. 6%, shut economy, destroyed peoples lives, families, businesses 6% deaths, COVID-19 cause mentioned. deaths conditions causes addition COVID-19, average, 2.6 additional conditions causes per lol... know link stupid. thought I'd share anyway. ....bUt InDiA tEsTiNg EnOuGh. could used election? 

(See username. ignorant legitimately asking you, wish correct ignorance.) fuck kinda Disney bullshit this? 😂😂 Yes know, better round graduate students Chinese ethnicity case since knows one might spy Chinese government. good point. United States Bootstraps. Minnesota supposed one good ones though. cousin's wedding next week. expect 100-150 people without care world masks sight. Despite lot relatives Doctors Nurses still believe COVID media driven hoax bad media says. matter hard plead family wedding still happening 90 year old grandmother attendance. still reception inside venue even though state currently limited 25 50 people one gathering. 

At point nothing change minds sure probably news headline couple weeks like one. Yes. Though originally thought surface transmission main vector transmission know case. still considered possible means transmission, think there's I've case Singapore considered likely infection contaminanted surface contact, even doubt. Here's quote Dr. Fauci last month: “It conceivable,” Fauci said, “but unlikely could get fomites, meaning inanimate objects [such as] doorknobs, computers. occur, it’s minor component transmission.”

Im still washing hands using hand sanitizer regularly trying avoid touching face public, panic Lysoling groceries using clorox wipes everything else pretty overblown. Basically security theatre make us feel good. 

It's also worth noting think many documented cases transmission outdoors except close contact long periods alcohol enters mix. working great Texas. I’ve honestly lost hope. large chunk population selfish comply something simple. really hit saw people EDM show Snapchat one front masks on. Nope people people like mom mindset goes little something like ""I know pandemic may 2 year anniversary first date get married never same"" certainly is, Special Forces 20 years me. Even spending whole life him, still surprises random insights things dead-on (all due experiences). 

And really, really, really hoping would wrong time.... shit.... Four years.... going suck hard. That's people stupid, immature, care spreading/getting virus. 

My make protects you. mask protects me. hard. seems likes propaganda. know people tested positive. None hospitalized. Without media telling bad looking people know seems blown way proportion. Yeah exactly happened. Memorial weekend CNN beaches showing people 5 days later protests minimal mention covid. Regardless political views week made political issue hoax talk. mean say every 10 Covid-19 patients died, 2 intubated? way e written makes sound like 80% Mexican Covid-10 patients died. It’s funny though kinds policy implementation governance happening remotely now...it seems like could system developed checks balances doesn’t require foreign visitors nursing home  ever happened Chinese commitment let inspectors host City trace back origin what,when,and Chinese Virus stated whom?

Literally, scientists found negative correlation. found looking connection felt likely true, no, going clear significant negative correlation percentage a
state’s population reported protesting subsequent increase cases of
COVID-19. Thus, example, Washington D.C., far highest reported
participation rates protests 13.7%, relatively low increase cases during
this period. fuller analysis -- again, beyond scope report -- requires
incorporation various factors driven surge cases last two
months, changes mobility adherence health guidelines (such mask
wearing) broader population state, variety state policies. For
example, data also indicate individuals states higher levels protests also
had higher levels compliance mask wearing

[from interview total garbage. private party, university business there. Unbelievable media double standard: condone violent riots, mass looting, arson, killings, simultaneously vilifying slandering concerned citizens (I.e. students) simply want relief overburdening restrictions ultimately lead stripping constitutional rights. Regardless political side you’re on, protection individual rights top priority. It’s estimate given mexican government, guess numbers even higher That's point. Testing useless positivity rate pushed lot tests conducted people symptomatic, track spread looking numbers it, quarantine people asymptomatic (thus reducing spread).

High test positivity means number tests conducted insufficient. nothing says strong leader worrying criticism Interesting. common seasonal flu thing Spanish flu?  right always wrong? saw report it

There goes credibility. Im microbiologist would take rushed vaccine. would wait least 6 months year everyone else. observe possible adverse effects/issues. Vaccines normally take years good reason that. Yeah large point difference. Although unprecedented, states pretty quick throw borders.

But, 26 million cases tested... know many cases eligible tested manner, can't claim rare.

I mean, statistically, correct. Reinfection would rare stage game, virus circulating 6 months antibody immunity said last least 3 months.

It makes perfect sense reinfection cases would start slow grow people become susceptible. deny just, silly.

Sure, believe reinfection rare. hope reinfection rare, change fact currently know 'rare' is. you’re going argue United States poverty neatly spread equally amongst ethnicities races that’s different thing, would incredibly stupid argument make.

An incredible straw man argument. No, that's argument I'm People poor tend obese co-morbidities like diabetes.

Right, nothing suggest minority groups inherently susceptible virus; higher death rates explained sociological (higher incidence in-person work, larger households) epidemiological (higher incidence co-morbidities) factors. virus target different races different ways.

Remember we're thread vaccine clinical trial delay due under-representation minority ethnicities. delay due under-representation diabetics, asthmatics, people suffering heart disease COPD--presumably trial sufficiently resolve effects co-morbidities vaccine safety efficacy. making ultra super duper sure minority ethnicities inherently elevated risk serious adverse reaction vaccine ineffectiveness.

Not universal healthcare costing us money would it. That’s true ones get decide it’s done keep grubby little fingers pot. given America operates... someone always try make money it. Big city sure. 

“New York” “Hollywood” specifically mean Jews. Good chance they're already there. anyone rejects ""socialism"" Think deeper... you’re skirting right around fringe issue. course fewer earners equals less money. crux issue still addressed, it? mean, used families single male earners. didn’t live poverty. Could tied devaluation work - particularly women’s work? implosion good, working class jobs? escalating cost living keeping pace wages? Trickle economics subsequent gutting social safety net? You’re taking data point looking beneath it.

Of course someone less money less money. structural inequalities erected makes single parent damn difficult? could fix wanted to? Yes. Yes could. adequate public policy, one needs struggle quite much, particularly pandemic.

Single parents living poverty symptom. It’s cause disease. India's numbers definitely accurate.... No. live trying conditions test survival. humans survive lot complicated stuff.

When someone says things like ""nobody going care anymore"" assure you, us weasels plague rats, continue care end. include justification ignoring pandemic safety rules. would rather put perfume take shower.... US worst according sub lol OK fair enough, thought extreme end due saying ""It makes feel like I'm fucking idiot staying home seeing groups people shit over"", ""Meanwhile gf staying fuck home"" (admittedly related symptoms) ""I get humans social creatures, thought smart, thought could this"", sounds like wanted people completely disregard social interactions. India cases one day China since day one years!!!

And another shipping 10 years long term planning! maybe someone’s pushing stupid ass conspiracies  added new word. Nobody claimed asymptomatic. But, great strawman argument. know scare quotes around word awful, anyone says shit someone lost anyone, reason whatsoever, legitimately awful. website says otherwise, would what's effect go contrary literally ten+ “America bad” drooling moron fest posts top sub right now. UK true, citizens, permanent residents family reunification quarantine. Everyone else straight banned Class necessary. they're (or rather parents) paying for.

Partying part transaction. 

For many college first taste real world real consequences, people immediately showed they're quite ready real world. Without statistics claims baseless though. think many people sub would consider ""looney conspiracy"" person believing schools try opening we're severely underplaying negatvie health consequences lockdowns (while likely overestimating worst case scenarios COVID) think anyone *actual* conspiracy theorists take something like think dumb fluke.

You give conspiracy people much credit doubtful full extent response enough. Totally topic side skirting part, California one, 1/10 usa population right there.

Now, really understand difference? Hey need new mom care package, lemme know. 

I’m mom 2 toddlers (check comment history verification) I’m decluttering baby stuff, need anything - toys, clothes, bottles, bath stuff, blankets, wipes, books, etc, mail you. 

Also highly, HIGHLY recommend cloth diapers. There’s learning curve it’s easy disposables, save family $50 per month diaper costs. Yeah. I’m 33 graduated college 3 months 2008 recession. can’t even imagine buying house.

The thing it’s old people, even were, people boomer assholes loved shitting millennials years. I’d isolate long-ass time keep Bernie Sanders alive, know? Yeah still play games online friends highschool stuff like I'm super lonely, really met people around here. I'm somewhat introverted anyway feel fine honestly, feels like meeting new people. Oh wow, that's home town. terribly surprise lot dumb conservatives think corona virus fake news. Still holds overall case record. India passed Brazil become number 2 need another 2.4M cases get US right now. I'm genuinely glad hear that! luck soon world get much better thanking people depressing posts! Imagine dying smash mouth trust news china. lie. Isn’t testing still short supply much US? Last weekend summer. People going go out. Last hurrah! 

“F*** Covid” say. got work hard smart. Working hard cleaning lady day, unfortunately, get far cost $10,000? also insurance covered? Even 1 many that’s fun isn’t exciting. curious though decided post 2018 data could posted 2017 data better stoke long con conspiracy fires 😂 Hot take here, people like (serious pre-exhausting health conditions) quarantine don’t go out, rest us wear masks continue promoting healthy habits, open certain things back up. stay closed, eventually won’t anything open back to. ""one day 90k"" infection announcement playing catch up. Expect see numbers continuing official numbers reach modicum reality

When released 50% Mumbai slum residents virus (that's 3 million people), death count 60k. similar scenario later revealed major metro areas similar population. Democracy beats dictatorship, hands down.

Except responding pandemics, apparently. Pretty strange articles COVID cases emerging Peaceful Protests. ;) Makes sense. country won’t able get rid without vaccine. progress made. hope so, think it’s also likely people overestimating impact measures. WA you’re getting end perfect weather season now, everyone indoors together soon little fresh air businesses schools continue operating. Best delay wedding permanently busy watching trump trash murder people covid guns. grew Spearfish, mom lives Sturgis. live Phoenix undergoing pandemic precautions well living hotspot. knew exactly looks like rally. knew area for. literally begged go anywhere else rally. stay family member’s homes, rent, whatever. didn’t. 

I also fully hold Kristi Noem blame fucking sociopath desperate need gain Trumps approval singlehandedly spearheading murder constituents. Nah. *one* advantage goverment isnt willing risk little unrest save lifes isnt worth shit. Thats cases. like .1% u dont look comorbidies Nope. name article that. putting names articles? mouth. However, apparent think giant farce, nothing worry about. Disregard [mounting evidence go away thousands upon thousands cherry picking single issue single study, extensive data backing up. that, began fabricate evidence contrary, doctors claimed study flawed, still produced single shred evidence.

Can just... maybe... stop trying push narrative? evidence point contrary, might change stance that:

* less virulent/deadly influenza
* affect weak

Can say same? Tell man, went walk put number I'd say 1 20 ppl masks on. ways blame media barley spoke confirmation airbourne transmission also individual research times like stay informed. Lol China going dominate everybody disease continues ravage every country. Yes rare far. many people opportunity infected multiple times? 

A totally hypothetical scenario: 
100% community opportunity infected first time (sufficient exposure time + sufficient dose),
100% got infected,
100% recovered, then
100% opportunity infected second time...

....the fraction people getting reinfected scenario would tell us rare is.

The situation even close imagine HCWs working Covid-19 patients, without PPE bad air quality (few air exchanges/hour). reality somewhere? look numbers. Lol man wealth keeps getting brought along assumption 

You people fucking sad. Remind Me! Two Months school people like got medical degree talk shit scare people living lives. can’t play god. planet designed survival fittest. planet already populated getting worse day. Mother Nature awoke resetting balance. condolences loved ones don’t make this. Like RemindMe! 2 months Yeah. starting get good place life, including mental health. pandemic people responded shut I'm finding slipping back black hole. sounds fantastic. wedding month. Small town less 100 guests entirely outdoors. Masks mandatory eating. Smaller tables lots distancing. Hand sanitizer centerpieces. asked vulnerable family members stay home we’ll send video. We’re hoping best since couldn’t get deposit back either. real. kids go private school, it’s $4,00 per year. Much much cheaper daycare. Omg info efficacy article? sure aren't. Requiring Dr's note missed days pandemic? Madness. 
Lots bosses lots industries requesting driving GPs wall. 

If taking medication &amp; knowing risk could lead mental health deteriorating point can't leave apartment earn living, would 100% keep taking it. I'm sick leave need money can't risk ending worse Covid would probably without medication. thought long term effects get mild case terrifies makes furious work. idiots work openly say they're worried getting it, effects old people (even true, still matter.)

We're seeing lot people's true colours time. They're never going forgiven.

Edit- forgot mention, yes, absolutely looking elsewhere. also need wear mask mean Something I’m thinking % chronic symptoms covid positive, pos/neg recovered, fatal; would like see breakdown still suffering something 2months, 3months, 4,5,6 etc graph. Kudos. Wish like  Hundreds protests+ thousands maybe milions people+ like 25% wearing masks= 0 cases? I’m saying weddings, consistent Trump's America “low-class people” Well, shit. Hey, like wedding Maine. ( curious)

Personally, I'd prefer little overlap insofar ""guests pictures wedding"" ""people died terrible death"", many brides seem lose minds run day lifetime. 🤷‍♀️ ask everyone come contact they've moron last two weeks? Sounds practical. Keep going. There’s bound round one cylinder chambers Saw friend Facebook attend wedding weekend. single person wearing mask photos shared. 100% no. 3 people living 1000sqft house. feasible quarantine one person it. Every time go outside anything carry BLM sign. caught virus guess works. need Fauci confirm me, though. great confirmation transmission rate. Almost 2.5%. experiment success! hardcore antivaxxers would simply claim Trump received placebo, suspect would good. one read yesterday! Case studies hit children 3-4 weeks asymptotic infections. Children need develop upper respiratory symptoms COVID-19 develop MIS-C .au clue! Australia. know kitten puppy worms go Petco buy dewormer? That's Ivermectin. cheap, readily available, around decades. I'm fan grifting top either, think it. There's way Vietnam could lie numbers medical supplies it. would fucking catastrophic number ICU beds available Vietnam virus ran rampant like states; operational capacity pull off; would similar situation like Wuhan China crematories working nonstop stats. 

Most doctors doctors countries (that currently stationed Vietnam) agree Vietnam mess around beat back virus strong central government response, along strong buy population large. 'I wear mask muh freedoms' nonsensical bullshit. I'm introvert misanthrope. depression stimulated school debt work meaningless job hours end, life little time for. I've let go job deal uncertain financial future top brutal reality capitalism looming. 

Plus wonderful leadership fantastic job handling this. /s Two cousins “no sex marriage” Christians got married pandemic sister delayed wedding whole year they’re religious probably desperate tie knot wait suppose real, move away give plague stare. I’m speaking neutrally. people told something, leaders opposite (and third fellow citizens opposite) happens. deflecting. supporting study, saying agree study 60 people single Chinese hospital good enough state '55% Covid patients continuing neurological defects'. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's what's question, that's statement OP made study used back up. 

So answer question proceed interviewing me. thought odd looking death tolls. Brazil 4.1 million infected 126,000 deaths India 4.2 million infected 71,000 confirmed deaths. HUGE difference. explanation India's data highly inaccurate. ""if can't mentally stand healthcare measures, get help going anywhere"". 


Some people desperate excuse claim ""lockdowns"" failed.


Many give damn fellow humans mental state. sure care dropped dead Covid-19. though says would be? Unified national strategy mean ""do thing everywhere."" agree sentiment here, it’s frustrating government made personal health economic health mutually exclusive. proper stimulus support could’ve avoided dichotomy, as-is you’re right federal response forced hand ignoring virus technically best course action. Countries robust contact tracing testing definitely able cake eat too, government failed us you’re totally right it’s unrealistic believe COVID won’t spread across country Go. Live life. sub scared shadows story big outbreak Minnesota? relevant? key phrase mentioned interview ""widely available."" mentioned first responders, high risk professions, etc...would first get vaccine. Well there's course always kind intent behind statement person makes. point low risk except make point everyone must overreacting? yes, many people assume redditor makes kind ""facts only"" statement fact trying make point (which figure reading lines). 

And that's point making, posting random tidbits information? Say mean, accept fact others come conclusions. Well interpretation flatten curve sure shit communicated. 

As note vaccine...1) like HIV absurd comparison. Actually according scientists fairly straightforward vaccinate against. 2) Necessity breed innovation...scientists never create vaccine fast. considering looks like vaccine way return normal every response failed, I’d say step vaccine! Exactly. Thank you. Glad we’re page Shame them. Stay strong. hope don’t become news story need start reading non-cult founded news channel. live old people careful. make choices. wear mask go visit grandma, can't everyone too? Take personal responsibility safety grandparents. can't tell position playing devils advocate. responsible friends family getting Covid infecting others go back live. agree this. also hard time picturing strategy would exactly many people defiant would still defiant anyway. idea? Yep, dogs cats too. imagine there's run feed stores!  point lame semantics arguments beginning resemble user name. Peace out! right!? TF happened Social Contract US? Can’t take court? would cheaper, especially take small claims court. true two nursing homes large COVID outbreaks (and probably substandard care many areas), another [news actually explains raids due homes taking residents’ stimulus checks. post fine “sue us” part, post changed fact felt like got one you? guys really love waiting another year affect that, added bonus knowing wedding lead deaths. Winner Tbh kinda belive that.

Its economic pain, also fact incredibly hard countries actually establish lockdown since control may quite weak. mean goverment Somalia talk lockdown want good luck actually it. Also lot countries dangerous diseases floating around.

Still doesnt excuse rich countries jack tho. Right time election comment lines ""Why fucking garbage headline front page news sub"". point? 1918 Flu started USA. USA ever reimburse world damage caused? comorbidity 65+? normal people stop lives livelihoods folks?

Personal responsibility thing. you’re worried it, wash hands, don’t touch face, avoid going out. Literally exactly like flu season. 

I wonder sub took CDC source. CDC inherently kinda shitty like say? mean watched sub felicitate fuck month, truth came don’t like anymore. I’m glad hear she’s taking court. don’t understand people aren’t, especially health guidelines favour. would want support venue company gives choices anyways? I’d want name, shame, sue companies social media platforms me. financial loss risk loved ones dying, others community, bottom line. even one person get sick, let alone die, went ahead, would turn meant happy occasion lifelong guilt. Ex Christians lucky. act like Christianity bad safe house. 

In country used live in, would killed Ex Muslim. Us Ex Muslims killed around world daily, Anti Christians act like Christianity scourge earth. dislike religion, Ex Muslim find very, hard see Christianity light Islam. reeks privilege even pretend anywhere close killed leaving faith. Everyone experiencing unexpected life-altering event time. much hatred everyone around makes worse. Biggest hoax modern history, feel sorry people misled took virus seriously.

For right things, appreciate concern safety well-being others, efforts nothing parts psy-op.

The positive thing see coming ridiculous Covid-19 hoax, better prepared actual pandemic occurs. know, pandemic mortality rate +5%. beer? welcome. Cheers. mean then?  analysed data initial outbreak, things playing much same

They not. Right UK has~ 1800 cases per day (weekly average) 7 deaths/day. look back Spring data, see level cases UK ~100-150 deaths per day.. clearly, Spring UK catching much smaller proportion total cases. God forbid accurate stats know people died of. accuracy! 1950s: Space race 

2020s: Vaccine race

I'm hoping mRNA America's answer Sputnik V, supposed flexible quicker method regular vaccines (disclaimer: I'm layman) Many recover saddled lasting symptoms destroyed organs, mention debts hospital care, people still delude recovering means they’re back normal. always state Haha good though going killing guests... Evil usually survives. agree. think lot people nervous fact true mRNA platform ever implemented thus far. Tested? Yes. adenovirus route used already past. reason alone, people probably feel slightly comfortable ChadOx... Yes, expect is.

But live EU. live ""greatest country world"" -- assuming rich. rich, fucked. think hate people wear masks. simple thing. know inconvenient, people would wear masks buried father-in-law weekend. I'm tired people. Doesn’t matter keep fear hype train moving aboard!!! federal loan 6-month grace period restarts time student becomes full time student (I took breaks degree, experienced that).

Private loans college predatory terrible. understand folks take private loans instead finding less expensive school. right anyone private loans extra screwed take break. vaccines same. Side effects could different effectiveness well. good news another showing signs success. makes look like Mexico excess deaths count low going well 122k? sub clearly overrun anti-maskers Except US protect billionaires political reasons, rather real economic necessity. many *who already died* added, US, thousands *who already died* aren’t counted yet (and maybe won’t - excess shows it).

I can’t clarify better. 

No one knows whether second wave, type speculation pointless. I’m talking past. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Let guess ""first worst hit country""?..

Murica! Let’s see blasé “just 70k deaths” it’s life line. Norway, one. peaked april dropping evern since. single digit numbers per day several 0 days. Ok and? wish best luck trying times. Sure, that's anywhere. Canada gonna fine. We're going another big outbreak colder months, suggest we'll anything close US Brazil wild. saying suggesting that. fifth deaths India cause death assigned them. It’s highly likely many deaths aren’t assigned correctly. everyone wore masks... 11th actually. getting overtaken fast countries. Anyone answers confidence lying. We’re 1st wave. was. variety flu strains, deadly others. flu vaccine contains one strain (and different every year) that.

Flu good mutating, unfortunately. Coronaviruses relatively high mutation rates well, suspect we'll yearly vaccination too, possibly also eventually containing multiple strains. dont know videos seen seen plenty protests masks properly worn. Also, masks reduce risk, dont make dissapear Americans truly awesome people. ask one. What's happening? know they're trying roll rapid tests widespread testing rapid ones accurate. 14 days number be? move arround chance exposed infected people increases good qualified professional share thoughts may projecting Sadly nursing homes highest mortality rates :( likely switzerland moment. seems Chinese vaccines non-white test subjects others. expand impact phase III concludes positively properly. ""I sick would want help pay you? also good job health insurance. care shitty job doesn't, get better job loser!""

It's selfish attitude within United States keeping status quo combination bribes corporations making money existing system. Wouldnt exposed potential infected people moved arround? first thought, too. every single one wasn’t wearing professionally-fitted N95, heads roll. would say lots countries many closed everything 1-2 months We're boat. Developing country levels testing makes seem like get cases, positivity rate low (i think 2% yesterday) seems like drop real. Provinces preparing open schools/unis phases starting september 15th, randomized testing teachers students make sure spikes happen. 


Not many school reopenings around world successful spikes occurred, we'll see happens. Except China number new outbreaks (in Beijing, Xinjiang province, near Russian border, IIRC) case reacted aggressively prevented new surge. sense they're much ahead curve... Europe dealing new outbreaks seem political clamp anymore. like conspiracies right? considered conspiracy group profits making people believe conspiracy, would admitting vulnerable average person? 1. look examine videos protests hard find one precautionary measures continuosly infringed.
2. ratio blm protests antilockdown protests perhaps 1000 1 seems plan case would would reroute road trip towns people know use restroom how's ones laughing appropriately. would little bit way could forced take time time spent home someone equally lockdown would extra risk. far gas would ask people friends family could meet gas station tank exchange whatever cash payment could hand instead go inside co-workers afraid regular flu jab. One understand regular history nasty reactions avoid them, rest? know vaccines regularly successfully used centuries point still trust them. work medicine! banning activity shown dangerous good way get people disregard restrictions, even ones based good science. countries Europe less restrictions Sweden? #tshirt trust CCP propaganda (state run press) US “propganda” (free press). 

You understand difference, correct? Protesters crammed small locations police, constantly coughing sneezing tear gas, hanging tightly packed water / food /first aid stations,...  Smart! said multiple occasions masks useless. get it?! part conspiracy fake c0vid!? there's many bodies can't literally see right now?!!? Fake news, nice try big paper!!?! /s Hahaha know, right. FB collapsing itself, sustainable take death toll seriously Pakistan.

Yeah here's article excess deaths Excess deaths reportedly gone back normal lahore karachi. didn't, we'd definitely get reports graveyards getting dead people usual, happened June covid official death numbers high. 


If death toll really higher official numbers, we'd definitely people making stink graveyards overflowing mass graves dug. situation; Iran does. Agreed. test everyone twice, day 1 day 14. Cleared go home, others remain.

Class online. ashes world, Wuhan reborn I'm calling retarded.

I'm even called comment retarded.

But I'm pointing it.

HelloBuddyMan - believe people wearing masks Jailed. happy called extremist?

Why answer question simple yes no?

Do believe people wear masks sent jail? Regardless increased funding urgency still urgency heightens possibility error. 😂 sure everyone downvoted anythung anti-CCP. Reddit believes whatever Chinese Gov says? “camps” “house” million Muslims? really nice schools education? 

People want bash US response pandemic, rightfully so, defend support CCP? really bizzaro world. That's happens drink gallons Coca Cola every week. Especially place high rate diabetes. Considering diabetes leading cause death Mexico probably don’t fare well covid. problem don’t get infected university probably get infected visiting others throwing parties. 
So stuck America every countries. India reported fewer year year deaths... Also virus weak compared killer immune systems... 70k deaths 6 months population 1.3 billion. virus joke. No. Edgelord gonna edgelord 😷 Sure, lets play numbers game, 180k dead people damned. Beat it. 70k deaths 6 months pandemic india. 4 million infection, deaths. match 8mmune systems weak af virus. baffled people talking ""second wave"" August/September. expecting second wave come Nov flu season full force. numbers source include elderly given care Socialstyrelsen including elders dementia mental problems. live longer persons psychical problems. usually part ""normal"" care homes. probably reason behind even take high numbers source, people live signifacally shorter time Swedish carehomes compared many countries. SAME. things contributed ‘hoax talk’ spoiled, entitled fuckers couldn’t wait month two see things developed, considering *brand new disease*

Idiots idiots best push way keep what’s right. Hm. Virginia, people good wearing masks indoors. proven responsible keep virus bay. Likewise, risky behavior like casinos clubs propagate fast. also shown outside air competition relatively safe, especially non-contact sport. clubhouses issue. shit spreading like wildfire seems one cares. care ""probably"" die. want catch know will. Empirically speaking, that's really true either, it? None countries lockdown (Sweden, Belarus Japan) saw hospitals overwhelmed. Conversely, capacity exceeded countries (Spain Italy).

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Wtf wrong sub? want time? 10 months. 8 reinfections.

The fuck talking about? 10 months what?

It's obvious disingenuous conversation. 

Feel free believe reinfection rare. Enjoy. Shitty governments everywhere. We're gonna laughed long, long time over... Ugh one gringo friends going mexico weeks vacation annoyed. need go holiday right endanger people. irresponsible selfish frustrating disgusting ppl claiming 9/11 Sandy Hook fake paid actors. could make sweet hobbit house concrete pipes. either. People need take politics equation look science. Neither side willing support preconceived political based views problem is. Good job Sweden! U.S. testing rate top 5 world. Look test/capita rate worldometers numbers. People give U.S. shit...but warranted. want blacks Latinos volunteer. need blacks volunteer. way. took first dose. friends family help? 

I get paid $150 per visit, nice. important believe cause. last days, India matching US Brazil combined. Today, India exceeded even that. Even use conservative assumption India beating US 40,000 cases per day going forward (it likely since India's numbers still going US trending down), India overtake US two months. consider India taking top spot almost certainty. population India four times bigger. get easily. In-laws went back last month. exactly do. also followed asked another test quarantine well. to, assume ask anyway make sure. Read article. didn't. china decide put place rules follow countries preferred list (vietnam, Thailand, korea already) NZ, australia control borders bring case zero could join club. could world separated safe go mask rest. China leader, impose taxe countries bringing numbers following drastic numbers. Yea I've wondered percentage rates. testing symptomatic ppl / hospitals / etc example definitely going high % rates. 

What's really needed way get % general population 1. Give kid marshmallow.

2. Tell show marshmallow 5 minutes later, they'll get another one.

3. Wait 5 minutes see kid comes back. America's leadership bunch drooling morons, maybe there'd less talk about.

Remember good old days, could point south say 'man, least we're fucked Mexico?'. Well, maskless Donald Trump says 'gotcha!'. *am* foreigner China. I'm literally talking China now. keep pretty date outside world. VPNs, thousands millions Chinese people.

There loads 'leaked' reports videos back January/February. said, even various doctors spoke Western media back then. *nothing* like now, would hidden outbreaks. virus beaten back. Right back mind. even looked sub quite long time.
 
Life goes on. ohhhhhhhhhhh okay

So U.S. we've enough testing -- expensive, cheap/free testing available, ""no test means quarantine me, 400 IQ play"" -- sounds like Mexico REALLY inadequate testing, yeah? Maybe U.S. hogging reagents needed tests? office building still shut 10+ doors two place security temperature checker there. really understand redditors obsess welding door. Maybe need make daycare free. hope understand people serving invaluable. all. post prob shouldn’t dignified response. point need get real SOLUTIONS. element give man fish. element deregulation good. 
Perfect example, HBO’s Wire...Dookie...to me, saddest character show FAR. kid could’ve gotten job Foot Locker 15 years old. could’ve saved life. It’s show, it’s example, yeah get job parent approval situations...that’s point. Point is, system broken. Even want right often can’t. 
Peter Schiff actually made great point podcast once. mechanics inner-city. used you’d pull gas station (but also service station) there’s 2-3 kids 12-16 years old pumping gas checking oil. basically worked tips. learned LOT working there. learned mechanic skills. also, even job basically customer service/sales/interaction...how show time, etc. important stuff. 
In modern America...it’s hard even employ person 18 healthcare, payroll tax, even minimum wage it’s worth many jobs. People simply pump gas. 
But many kids grew up...first GREW bc busy mechanic’s service station getting shot street corner...AND many became mechanics, small business owners. trade. Others maybe kept trouble, structure realized “damn man hard work maybe I’ll go college”...that doesn’t happen anymore.  Gotta take freedoms away gradually else right scream ""but freeeedums!!!"" ran - people still dying causes well. “roar” boom construction, oil, radio, consumer products, wall st speculation. ""old economy"" coal, railroads, steel suffering particularly badly. Unemployment high industrial strife frequent. Strikes many cases met extreme brutality, see coal wars 1920's. Farmers well. European nations picked production recovering WWI, agricultural prices began fall. President Coolidge vetoed efforts alleviate issue. 1920s better 30s didn’t roar many. No! want used cat. prefer new one. 1. outside, different pre-lockdown life (PLL) ""normalcy"" functions PLL (schooling, office work, entertainment concerts/movies/sports) conducted indoors.

2. protests actually fairly short events people despite media narratives ""X city ablaze night long."" Outside hardcore activists, people would go handful days (if one) handful hours time--again, different PLL functions necessitate substantial chunk hours spent among congregation people, and, again, outdoors.

3. protesters wearing masks, reduces spread opposed to, say, normally-operating classroom. According official numbers, Mexico's CFR even biggest world.

Data Johns Hopkins: UK, Belgium it, France close behind.

I kept saying claims CFRs 1% wishful thinking kept getting downvoted, 6 months virus, official numbers still show CFRs 4% 15%

And higher numbers come developed countries, tend produce reliable numbers compared 3rd world countries often even means infrastructure required report accurate numbers, often led leaders much cover real numbers, look bad. Wanna use brain sec?

Google ""Jewish concentration camp Nazi Germany WW2 map"". camps housed 700k people.

Now find thing Xinjiang, 4x bigger.

I'll wait. PA Gov Lt. Gov long supported legalization. PA GOP Senate pass legalization. Tragic. sad hear this. story posted yesterday Hmm, often nature donwe see defensive posture group threat detection? Fairly common. Behavior changed? Thats fair question. Otherwise think OP schilling dumbocrats. near-universal mask wearing *and* outside even better fine. People make bad contractual choices time. school bear cost losing student's fees could otherwise got student abided rules. causation 100% student's selfish behavior, school shoulder cost that. act cost anyone fees arbitrary. Im expecting slow elections mine salt generated here... fun less friends, I’m sure you’ll missed!! I'm neither those. That's I'm going raw numbers speculating reinfection common NUMBERS say is. Sorting controversial hours gonna quite ride also record 61000 tests today. We've steadily 4.5% thereabouts weeks. China citizens deserve normalcy have, busted asses it.

The normalcy caused first place never apologizing helping rest world fucked over? let know that...

You've hit by...

You've struck by...

The US propaganda! Countries like Mexico, Brazil, India etc, higher amounts poverty typically much higher density population even look individual houses. might see family 4 4-5 bedroom house US, whereas countries, might double triple number. addition Mexico average 7 years education vs. 12 USA. Mexico could argued ignorant, would say happening US blatant stupidity. Ill believe shit turns purple smells rainbow sherbet. made dog's dinner entire business. Ah thanks mr. bot national major media always make protests look far risky dangerous actually are--on many levels, including covids transmission. tend show dramatic crowded scenes (as violent) shunt music, speeches, social distancing aside newsworthy. love show exceptions divisive. (at least liberal/left ones adhered quite closely masks often distance too. cannot speak others) many positive tests vs deaths remember Delhi antibody study. recently, another antibody study conducted Mumbai slums found half residents Covid. young population, lack obesity, possibly stronger immune system due unsanitary conditions may helping them, can't sure. true, good news poorest countries money medical resources fight pandemic. may chanced nature's stroke luck. 7 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday. respect process thinks steal year's worth fees, providing service, people break rules. punishment already losing place could reasonable fine. Giving huge corporate entities right claims people's money helps one. TLDR: 10 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 17 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Coincidence? happen fucking 21st century beyond us. dare diss Tuvalu like 😤 Took ""uncivilized"" words right outta mouth. Bueno! I'm tired it. People mean.  

I've skipped lot stuff year. trip Colorado planning nearly decade. live mile town center, 6 months, kids used walk least week. I'm homeschooling! Like kind hippie. they're here, hikes woods, they're gone mom's, drink solitude ride bikes.

But know people think made up. bunch weird conspiracy. I've eliminated life. I've entirely quit going Facebook, thus also eliminating contact level-headed people I've known 30 years.  arguments circular. ""Here's fact""/""That's fake fact. Here's fact""/""THAT's fake fact...""

So, part stop it, watch tour trollies full people go house without caring. think, end, they'll laugh isolating must necessary. end, they'll laugh still isolating make difference. Apparently either outcome fine, long go drink bars stuff, sit home worry world I'm handing children, taking parents.

I wish planet, country, even town could act one. Mask month. Let virus find purchase flit one frozen tubes end Contagion. know seasonal flu related 1918 pandemic? 

But are, Labor Day.  Business usual. Parking garage probably full again, based traffic. part March, paying price another, think, 5 years? 3 years? normalcy gone people like me, understand mathematics exponential growth?  crazy old man mask? 200,000 people average per year dead (for reason) America enough? worth fighting anymore?

Why can't listen people decades medical experience infectious disease collectively say ""Hey, thanks info. I'll follow informed recommendation. all, good society economy!"".

People fucking worst.

Not guys... guys great. mean people. government-run services

Universal healthcare necessarily government-run service (meaning, government directly provide healthcare), many cases government dictates much health care providers charge certain services.  ""approval"" typical Putin dick-waving.

Russia phase 3 tests calling mass rollout. Agreed. Wanna back claim reliable evidence? It’ll die senate sure. turtle chin fuck won’t even let vote it, watch. 

I wish legal faith government so. I’ll move legal state done in-person voting problems either right?  God forbid actually interact face face afterwards seems bad. Maybe people purely touting death rates listened to. makes feel better, really highly doubt case. That's much damage modern marriage cause. want time? 10 months. 8 reinfections. Thats rare. Youre playing semantics make feel smart. 6 2/3 regular hotdog Midway ?????

HAHAHAHHAHAHA !!!!

Let's see:

* US 6.5 mil cases. Let's assume real number double (it surely not, claims 2 10 times asymptomatic cases wishful thinking). That's 13 mil population 330 mil. That's 4% population. best case. took 6+ months get here. Even assuming 200k new cases per day, means 6 million per month, would take 37.5 months (3+ years) 70% people virus presumably developed antibodies, reaching point herd immunity thing
* places like India, officially closing 100k new cases per day, even half million new cases per day, would take 65 months (5.5 years) get 70% population anti-bodies. 

**Without vaccine, we're nowhere near midway crisis.** 

Without vaccine, thing keep burning population years (if allowed burn fast antibodies last years, months). burns slow, around decades centuries. question want express grateful everything do. honestly believe done mankind person alive utmost respect that. It’s almost *too* easy Holy fucking white, source? think countries South Central America identifying US values following lead mess. Unless child thinks they'll current marshmellow taken. suppose could hold marshmellow keep safe instead eat immediately, kids always think things through. Holy shit. you’re arguing bad faith then. never accept wrong. Anything comes favor truth that’s hidden, anything comes lie meant conspiracy. source (aside guess breitbart tpusa guess) would convince you? I’m curious well. Us house talking PA Governor lt Governor advocating Fuck Facebook. Tossed shit 2017 Las Vegas shooting Trump racism Yeah fr, let's focus like 10 days COVID existed 2019 rather 355 didn't. lol I'm phase 3 trials also. I'm white little native south american. want blacks latinos trials want know vaccine safe effective people.  I'm 40s high blood pressure. 3 older people got first injection. 

I got first dose last week. super excited involved this. feeling it? someone lives South Texas, less 4 hours drive border ... missing here? [Worldometers' Mexico says country ~629k cases, ~67k deaths.

Now obviously that's lot deaths, but... ordering 1.1MM death certificates? That's *over 16 times* many deaths they've already. That's 1.75x many **cases** they've had. Ordering death certificates, sure, honestly sounds like peeps over-reacting That’s press run.  
But it’s printed litho that’s 8 sheet, single sided maybe, single color (black ink) probably.  
138,000 sheets so.   
Maybe 8000 sheets hour sheet fed press.       
That’s like 18 hour press run.   
Maybe little run slower. allowing large outdoor gatherings. Failed find anything mentioning we’ll %100 find vaccine 2021. Let bold bold ......it won’t last long. Unfortunately surrounded states territories eliminated heavily suppressed virus national approach needs followed. 

No point letting virus rip state. dont wear seat belts is, take dumb me? sorry. doesn’t protesting racism Yes, Scotland Forestry Commission close forest car parks thought bit odd. Every measure get people away I've supported, one struck bit like ""Oh, well better **look** like we're something help..."". I'm super curious ceo execs dumped stock. exactly people want, keep economy closed 30% country unemployed evicted. seems cutoff people people reddit want keep things closed forever. 98% reduction influenza recall correctly, pretty incredible. exceeded expectations But... But.... Bill Gates! 5G! Illuminati! fucking news site legitimate stature, nit. Use fucking google sometime. follow r/coronavirus /r/COVID19. actually stay informed. No, virus simply doesn’t spread among anti-racists. Source? article says COPD cause death deat certificate, read about, close symptoms COVID-19. 

Since COPD umbrella term conditions cause breathing problems, I'm sure collected samples tested anything could think of. 

When resources freed June probably submitted samples COVID-19 test. bit fuckup county resulted mail sent family. ranking decide factors all, size money do.

School rankings proxy things. school wealthy going highly ranked. Thank info. Makes feel better. want, they're _they join rest Australia_. _could_ choose let virus go rampant, let disease states, would completely unethical allow reintroduction.

It's kind like... know Americans banned travelling vast majority Western world right now, including even Canada, nearest neighbour? kind like that, Victoria gives damn, opted path isolated, _and_ save thousands lives. judge that. According who? Source? say stop spreading bullshit don’t even supply source claims. Kind annoyed family right now.

Had symptoms, quarantined, went got test. Test came back negative, doctor scheduled follow 3 days later. Went back follow symptoms persisted also lost sense taste. So, doctor thinks false negative. essentially, I'm treated like COVID.

But, negative test, everyone's rolling eyes tell doctor said false negative. Read: DOCTOR SAYS PROBABLY FALSE NEGATIVE. nooooo get positive test, I'm overreacting. fuck? fucking note doctor says ""He likely literally symptoms, needs quarantine."" 

And people really annoyed ask help, like groceries medication. Really learning count here.

&amp;#x200B;

By way, fucking sucks. hate laying bed feeling like I'm breathing straw filled glass shards :(  Pshhh fine hurt profit utterly pointless. think Covid cases US campus alone enough drive oversea students away anyway. 

It safe authority care. Thanks good looking bro. Mexican border closed Mexicans only. Majority Swedes vacation July.

Kids back school two weeks now. anything, trend since fewer cases (despite testing going up), more. Isn’t president said would help safe months back? prayers. Ok b00mer see got downvote appreciated levity. misunderstanding. PROACTIVELY asking attended protest. That's huge difference deliberately collecting data.

Do understand contract tracing all? None works people willingly work health officials. way force collection data unless collect sync electronic data phones stuff, way south korea approached this. 

Don't ""both sides"" bullshit. shhhhhh goes narrative, remember side wrong. side always right. Nah, hard right social issues, populist economy convincing people take vaccine difficult part know take samples dead people freeze tests performed later date researchers? inspectors wearing n95 shittier kn95 mask would much less risk. wonder on. Great joke Interestingly relatives South East Asia sees read China far Americans saying believing. also Chinese nationals emigrated South East Asian countries would've radar so-called controlling communist government years still saying anything like western media showing. 

Also seeing widespread news Western ppl believing welding door video far truth is, even individual home door whole apartment alternative exits, I'm beginning wonder else western media lying about. regular cold/flu, there's much doctor give what's already available counter (maybe potent versions). one doctor prescribed kind syrup based opiates, IMO fucking dangerous, again, cure it, would make feel better (or shittier hate opiates)

I similarly go doctors get cold flu, unless severe last longer something makes serious (for example anything causes trouble breathing probably ER worthy, since change something kill quickly) Knowing grandma, leaving house covid community here. 

Excellent justification wanting city long way away lock *your* peace mind That’s argument public health authority making  DRUMF would say.. oh quiet isn’t US part, season starts culture silence take positives publicly reported. see already happening high school level. Also watch contact tracing gymnastics players/coaches go through. lies thick. asking see little month hardly constant- anything that's extremely sparing. There's problem meeting outside, masked, distanced. say parents take seriously, presumably understand necessary preconditions. Further, doubt risk them- father likely takes greater risk daily job would seeing you. meeting described would risk free essentially activity. public health ordinance advised completely cut seeing people, especially family, long done safely. new reality rules pandemic seem believe exist. can't see much leg stand here, really. 

I know hard think could get parents sick. would definitely wrack brain position. help need interact child seeing safely, rest easy knowing way would basically ensure get sick. rate decreased last month far, 5 weeks row decrease previous week. Testing seemed gone back 2 dips (possibly Laura problems?). Trends generally positive Texas right now. Mexico also really testing sick people. They've done total 1.2 million tests.

The US 1.7 million tests past two days. freedomland America, Covid fuck you. real leadership. get upset schools cannot reopen? 

You know Biden said schools need reopen last week, right? family Mexico thinks garlic, lemon aspirin protect COVID. There’s massive reliance word-of-mouth “natural remedies” don’t shit COVID. I'm implying dangerous assumption expect effective vaccine time soon  Hey, atleast 2 extra weeks they've given us rough dates instead nothing upvoted post. People blind, deaf dumb purpose. one cares haha I’ve read kind masks using photo actually make spread virus worse. evidence ""real number"" ""surely double"" more?

This seems like load horse shit. Red Cross offering free testing antibodies blood donation. Malaysia Singapore also same. Every building must one entrance exit everyone temperature checked. open areas like restaurants, open dinings markets, use tape furniture barricade openings entrance/exists. also require write name phone number case someone infected inform check yourself. trusting people problem easily confirmed Google search countries' Covid measures fair, even done that, left (especially hard left) would still found excuse reason give crap it. already saw halted flights China got called racist liberals so. CDC

Wait, thought supposed follow CDC, what's right America's health? guess Trump recently infiltrated them. common comorbidities time death include pneumonia acute respiratory distress

You're right, bother looking actual numbers, news coming US borderline crazy moment. Here's honestly can't work get 6% that, Covid deaths never isolated causes death. 

**However**, takeaway believable. UK, ONS nicely provided data 91% Covid deaths pre-existing conditions. biggest co-morbidities Alzheimers dementia, 25%

To me, paints clear picture affected Covid-19. end living last years dementia, Covid-19 would relief. said thought die vaccine can't safe stuff that. there's one way find out. wanted reminded year either say correct. grill telling opinion like fact Finland fewer cases Nordics. Denmark almost double amount cases per 100k last 7 days.

Just enough confidence US though. Wrote yesterday Boost responsibles told them, important theyr work is. learned bullshit FB is. using FB 2 months said officially bye crap fake.

FB collection masked perpetrators, hypocrits computer needs posting 4437 times vsync latency speed toilet flush never mentioned major backlash vaccines it. *remember*. Haha like that. Yeah, deny downplay stuck thing tomorrow. Say ""we that"" news cycle moved end week, new responses talk about.

Can also take Putin tactic making joke it, confuses news cycle enough get reprieve whilst one really knows think.

But yeh. frustrating thing people equating ""China lies"" ""China lies literally everything"". news taken face value, mean assuming opposite everything say guide right way either. consider motives feasibility, sometimes truth (or close version of) simply aligns best. Sweden didn’t go “herd” though. CDC Director seems think almost entire mask enforcement compliance could get virus pretty well squashed four weeks even everyone went whatever wanted. get virus attacking younger population we're main ones partying etc, say fine they're still going spread around getting severely ill. young people live parents possibly grand parents. Surely they're risk too, no? I've thinking there's much contradiction leaves asking many questions. Sure, risk factor great enough warrant extent action you’re taking unless you’re risk category Wonder many going tied cousins wedding weekend. I’ve told something like 200 people expected there. Guess I’ll find soon enough two weeks. Seems like it, certain. example, think stay place concert, next someone corona exposed protest move around. real positive outlook eh? jb said multiple occasions m4a passed, would veto newsworthy hundred people go way huddle together, find virus spread among week two, least one attendees dies result. Yeah right...here comes PRC minions. man. Imagine dying COVID SEE Night Ranger. (European) governments also care money. way systems setup, allow abuse. government tries go around system f*ck us over, there's full protests going on. country literally stops function bit, reality check everyone. Looks like numbers mostly unchanged even free mass testing rolled out. hear may take 2~4 days get results though, assuming suspected cases still tested seems overall things looking optimistic. actually enforce mask wearing public transportation anything else. way many dumbshits following easy necessary rule. I’m sure none workers anything reckless downtime like attending large gatherings, going long trip vacations, even trying go bars. /s Liberals right wing... globally speaking Fuck that’s depressing. child needs help. I’m angry colleagues: we’re working remotely several travelling visit family, one quinceañera party two selling essential oils “boost” immune system. college professors know better. Everything post speaks fearmongering... ""Please give sources""

""Hahahahaha look moron actually believes sources cites"" party amongst nuclear fallout? friend, perfect time go ED. Incorrect assumption part. defend sometimes, sometimes condemn does. Depends situation. people hate whatever does, Trump said/did it, must bad. That's judging action/ words character person saying it. Essentially racism is. wasn’t arguing contributed. I’m saying protesters (myself included) didn’t socially distance data shows wasn’t sort spike rise cases protests. Camp cactuses keep pricks away. I'm sure. mean general... one event cause many cases, think schools many contacts person has. Every time see article wedding Maine case count, lately death count, goes up. Okay, like either would go down, depressing see many people affected \*stupid\* gathering. mean, really meant lifelong relationship loved other, still true pandemic basically safe gather? saw report r/india it

Basically dodgy governers certain areas almost going month since 60y/o dad intubated he's still hospital. doctor saying much good change happened still needs tube. I'm getting quite worried. even started dialysis days ago too. care nice, desirable neighborhoods. agree with. Also, protests changed behaviour non-protestors (minimised trips city, etc.) could potentially ffset increase cases caused protests. JetBlue vacations packages tons offers moment go Cancun October. countries opening international flights. US needs lift ban Brazil go back started March.

India 6.5x population, still stark per capita difference. say minimize India's dire situation course, wanted put statement important context. Staying home? idea, trip days see get haha really hope 🤞 need traveling right except essential travel vacation doesn’t seem essential Weddings mean? Looks like might pattern every three months, people think ""over""/""safe again"" start shedding protections--which leads spike two/four weeks later lockdowns happen again.

Looking pattern earlier year, locked *hard* March kept sliced third infection rate reached plateau 22k infections/day mid-June. People got sick went party summer/4th July, caused tripling spike mid-July 66k infections/day.

We reaching plateau 42k infections/day, is, oddly enough, 1/3 peak summer. **(BEGIN REALM GUESSTIMATION)** *similar* return like mid-June, we'd see spike roughly triple that--120k infections/day around start October, would probably fucking scary enough send even die-hard ""gotta normal again"" folks back houses. Following 1/3 plateau trend, we'd bring 80k infections/day around start December...which would fucking catastrophic seemingly cyclical ""desire normalcy"" would overlap holiday travel season, fuck even *try* estimate ""normalish"" Christmas travel season would look like double daily infections currently have. concern hundreds people sick weeks time. building work 30-40 percent influenza Right stay home order March. It’s like almost every year time. Except Brazil, EU China bans holes Swiss cheese. bans accomplished nothing towards containing disease. country community spread, US obviously does, thing works socal distancing masks.

Bans mandatory quarantines places like Taiwan New Zealand virtually zero cases makes sense source WITS, World Bank-UN collaboration. data real. specifically names Covid-19 test kits. Most

The obvious inference weren't. deaths definitely resulted protests, would agree? seem really, really sensitive huh

If seriously cant tell difference USA developing countries regard idk tell apologize yet. Cuomo lovers cuming india whole bot available. Delhi lower normal March till June data got far. quarters data come October learn viruses spread. One person wearing mask ruin everyone, sure, risk spread way lower outside ventilated area compared indoor vicinity recirculated air. getting rest “claims” from? never said anything *untouchables* getting Covid-19 Mostly demonstrates kids insecure environments poverty trust opportunity actually come again, come privileged environments investments actually pay off. sure Smash Mouth ones hear - half dozen bands playing show (far defend Smash Mouth artistic grounds, however) crowds. matter. within 10 feet (not 6, 10), get sprayed. mask protect you, coronavirus gets clothing, sanitize touching hands, face, etc., yes, risk.

Jesus, what's wrong American education? Biology 101. No. Please enlighten knowing one. that, hateful keeps minorities down. really mean thing do. Geez. cant’t think worse place go immediately traveling. Even going another state shouldn’t come back. wish people would understand thst it’s small sacrifice like positive ummmm outcomes future. happen outdoors? everybody wearing masks social distancing? 70% figure constantly floated around *actually* scientific figure, much extremely high end estimate got bit hand terms common usage. based one estimate R0 virus 5.5. highest estimate there, estimates put 2.5-3.5, would put level 40-50%. 

Now, also implying K-factor completely 1. not, all, much lower, meaning majority transmissions tiny portion population. means places hit herd immunity 20% infected, others 60%. low K-factor, 'percentage' hit suddenly hit herd immunity. 

The factor that... close vaccine, close. multiple vaccines end stages trials, preliminary results trials positive. made stuff up, dude. word correlates article whole page threads about. general claim there's spike connected every mass gathering — utter bullshit. first report protests drive spikes. shown before.

did read article? make reference it, say ""these articles"" talk stuff _The Guardian_ is, again, page threads about. article news.northeastern.edu. think read article. clearly metaphorical, questioning safety certain methods voting using example illustration. think could've clear complete dumbass would think advocating voting fraud. Like stupid people ignore logic sake hating Trump.  Bank America deposited check account accident year ago. Transposed two numbers. 

This must happen every sector world every day. call friends family several times week back Mexico. Everyone super laid back this. Pisses off. People still think real problematic even rona came picture. building work excellent hvac. 15 air changes per hour merv 8 prefilter merv 13 filter. stay open this. sneezing contests indoors out?🤔 bunch relatives gone Mexico past months. Three coming home today Mexico going straight baby shower :) would need find one that’s 4x bigger? Isn’t existence even 1 ya know, bad thing, consider bad? suck covid comes family. Misleading teachers. resignations planned retirement spring. Disagree.  depends much owner platform committed moral compass. yesterday couldn’t get test done. it’s rapid Covid tests result 24 hours. live San Diego family Tijuana There's way severely undercounting Malnutrition, vitamin deficiency. Thank you, someone common sense. Recently decided speak mind expense downvoted. knew would happen, past would suppress people get upset triggered I'm like fxck that, speak mind even many people disagree I'll get downvoted hell. Wait don’t forget need visit office across town pay 1000 pesos. Wait bring copy Id? pay copies made store around block. Okay documents order now? Oh oops closed noon, come back tomorrow.

That’s experience I’ve gone Mexico get documents anything. yes needed specific paper certificate makes complete sense 😂 don’t forget bring pesos needed get one Great Depression, then, like, WWII... China Uighurs fight terror (You search terror attacks China, western news dont cover much terrorism western countries). Beside that... also critique US countries joined war terror, chaos parts africa middle east, praised governments, democratic governments, never talk bad one wants talk bad democracy. spying giving Snowden case vs Huawei giving example international community proven case spying vs suspicious case spying.

People want hate communism love democracy blinded. true. Plus, takes ONE person wear mask. operating notion *untouchables* get COVID-19. Come say truly mean: eliminate ""weak,"" never mind POC disproportionally affected coronavirus. Yeah well fuck China I'm guessing implied appropriate response would full lockdown couple months, government support required.

This goes back ""rugged individualism"". many people opposed government mandates masks government support individuals (but companies, oh that's somehow different). stems mind numbingly stupid attitude. success species NEVER result ""rugged individualism"", always result collective effort.

I understand pain, questioning comment misplaced. $36,000 debt suspended semester tough start life.

As long parents taking proper precautions, dumb kids endangering anyone?

If older want avoid covid, it’s never easier 2020. Pick groceries curb go home. Everyone largely teleworking still. taking risk, that’s you. said less 1000 per day. That's correct napkin math. putting way much effort arguing. Click link bot posted notified exactly eighty days. gloat argue excuse.  sure hope so. Gotta get first round vaccines see much spread slows couple months later. give us pretty clear idea hard month/date over. What? health insurance pay someone's sick leave? norm maybe even exception US. countries capable test rates US enough cases right now.

The US needs much testing now, point test enough. media report COVID infections linked protests, since fit narrative forgot burnt portion pears. be, given since seems pointless hopeless endeavor now. Smash Mouth concert Sturgis linked new infections, though. mask-wearing makes major difference. Bullshit!! surge it’s fucking over! get amazed see mexican influencers millions followers living life precautions. Going trips, gathering tons different friends (posting couple stories mask tho -_-) outsider makes believe Mexico great shape... not. .....Except number three killer Americans right COVID-19. means number one POC. spoken like true white dude, interested showing much ""ally"" instead protecting financially medically defenseless. noble you. “I think, end, they'll laugh isolating must necessary. end, they'll laugh still isolating make difference.”
^^This! 
What describe eerily similar situation neck woods –and we’re supposedly “liberal” “progressive.” like “selfish” “entitled.” 
I’m still salty Green Party friends voted Nader 2000...how get Covid denials mask rants? shocked beyond belief man active Reddit account 10 years could convince woman sleep him. one woman whole world loves Funko POPs. Exactly. key difference events didn’t mask sight. make huge difference living like recluse months unreasonable request pandemic? can't say things like right obviously precautions (masks example) done?

I think numbers wise DR well compared countries region poorly compared similar countries world. Like SE Asia example. SE Asia followed conventional wisdom masks social distancing countries avoided worst far.

I love trip two years ago. went Pedernales days enjoyed lot. American: P H E C even that? read recently Mexican border closed (excepting essential travel) Sept 21. I’d bet 9/21 it’s still gonna restricted based post. anyway hell traveling there? Please bring context discussion. Same, probably wait years anyway safe. rush vaccine makes bit uneasy. worry steps might skipped things overlook fast want one. feel really sorry him. recall time president said something absolutely wrong asked confirm, said ""yeah, kind of"" say contradict president out, double public. 

He's basically getting crushed reality president refuses accept it. Sturgis, South Dakota outdoors, dude, many infections occurred around July 4th. stop virus. people lower masks socially distance, indoor, outdoor, virus still transmitted. 

When Americans pick biology book learn? middle low quality. Uncalibrated, randomize participation much. followups (though two batches, second one optimal time catching antibodies). entering northern hemisphere flu season. It’s likely things going get really bad really quickly unless cheap effective treatment found now. Imagine less trustworthy big fucking pharma telling could've worn mask, distanced, went concerts summer instead staying home?

Well fucking sucks. Would US ever allow classes taught Spanish Mandarin? probably never

Lmao. lmao genuine answer completely misses subtext. I'm sorry I* know subtext hard lot people* time argue every person issue, explain endlessly little nuance social interaction implied communication.

Ask friend truly interested answers questions baffled ""not cool."" guide thought process help read lines better experiences people future.

If truly interested, look looking fight say ""technically I'm right tho, mean we're speaking technically, acktually right tho"" course I'm interested kind energy draining experience. I'm punching bag. hundred people spread desert usually hosts 80,000? really newsworthy. America, two highly prominent politicians broke COVID restrictions past week. Seems like rules don’t matter you’re rich powerful. is. Lotta folks Reno Texas Arizona too... Covid accelerating? hit global peak? Pretty much. friend came back abroad Vietnam. quatorzaine (2 weeks quarantine) passengers flight military facility reaffected this. boring overall pretty chill. went back hometown local autorities require additional 2 weeks isolation home. We're pretty incompetent here, care individuals rather community whole.
- Sent UK get new friends. Oh already were. saying Sweden example do, Sweden example wrong. 

And claiming Sweden herd immunity already. They've saying Florida months too.

Don't forget that, seeing US numbers levelize while, people get used start pushing places completely re-open again. Maybe they'll even anti-mask again, fortunately people seem gotten quieter, least while. may see another spike start emerging around late October November. (It inevitably blamed Biden, fter losing election Trump outright sabotage everything order make things bad possible Biden's first months. like clogging toilet next person deal mess). Rich people smh Sweden didn’t nothing, that’s dangerous myth spun media. Max gatherings 50 ppl still place means actually among restrictions Europe right now. didn’t lockdown. everyone taking victory lap.  Wuhan citizens express persistent concern uneven recovery fear new outbreaks.  economy really declined. benefit even coming work questionable,"" said Yi Xinhua, 51, sells tofu stall Wuhan wet market.

So economy gets hurt people happy it. memories subsequent virus cluster May, triggered citywide effort test millions, remain fresh.  afraid epidemic return, know? summer over, winter coming,"" said Yi.  recovered bit. virus comes back, we'll hit again.""

Not complacent good thing. 

Historically SARS-CoV-1 came back winter affected people. nothing big happened. major part outbreak lasted 8 months, since World Health Organization declared SARS contained 5 July 2003. However, several SARS cases reported May 2004. Sweden compared neighboring (and comparable) countries like Denmark, Norway Finland? course Bernie. One political power whilst two time loser whose legislative record consists renaming post offices Social distancing integral part culture Thank you. assumed testing outside hospitals May infection rate high. guess know true impact long time. would they?

I'm wondering Finland low case count.

Massive document. found relevant data page 106 less magazine article. can't find anything broken way suggest. little help? also appears code 382200, also referring ""COVID-19 Test kits/ Instruments, apparatus used Diagnostic Testing"" data trade value 2017 date, like code 902780, trade data 2016 prior.

What odds changed two product codes specify COVID 19 tests, codes renamed would data beginning 2017 only?

Not trying spread conspiracy theory here, curious explanation applied? Wow that's really funny. Germany right wing parties escalating rIghTs taken away masks. mean, outdoors, socially distant, everybody masks? Yeah, that's POINT. think mexico fattest country world US 2nd. Either way

[I think that's Don’t remember, Physio taught M1? Could tons people confined space closed circulation. Bingo wedding DIE FOR.  likely though. extended family already will, change much. School closures younger kids least stories here, younger kids spread. Plus feel like day care would issue schools, much surrounding these. one point, several vaccines testing HIV. It’s actually go sis don’t think it’s scumbag. expenses, employees pay, etc. 

Turns businesses don’t like go bankrupt. 

They trying what’s best interest stay afloat. serious...or fucking me? da wae. think got SARS ten years ago, even though last reported case 2004? happening everywhere though. Suprisingly mind baffling human thing. almost like 2020 leaving people feeling powerlessness order regain sense power- people turning conspiracy theories, wild views. STUPID friends seem it.

FIFY ""I get it. him?"" part GOP ask McConnel drawn line sand Yeah I’ve attended virtual weddings. great! always chance. extremely slim case.

It highly unlikely even healthcare workers get vaccine next 6-8 months. declare bankruptcy. Easy peasy legal ""wedding"" court house

The local Justice Peace even weddings right now--we've looking it, wedding supposed next month--and people around acting like nothing's going on, throw nice 100-person wedding, nbd. Damn I’m sure Catholic schools guys familiar Catholic schools area nothing like “teaching propaganda” I’m seeing. tough schools rigorous education program - wouldn’t graduate didn’t know shit don’t mean religious doctrine - Catholics school classes (supposed to) teach religion preparation sacraments. One dumb idea + 275 idiots + dumb decisions = PEOPLE FUCKING STUPID SELFISH Lol tru Yes That’s good hear. Doesn’t change fact lives matter one cares. Everyone I’ve talked ready run everyone herd immunity move already. Stories like would considered good news. least show faces tools decided union simply could wait important health everyone know. want ask, since I'm American, Americans wanting/considering immigration elsewhere right now? yet, past behavior makes believe them. suspect getting downvoted specific sentence responding intended sarcastically, people thought spot sarcasm.

Your point remains valid though. one comparisons, one compare Belgium NY state Massachusetts, US whole. California TV commercial production starting again. Why? ""Cuz"". Rumor is, ""COVID Compliance Person"" ever pointed said ""you"". Wonder end up... would mean black people would get too. weddings ultimate act self indulgence

Even worse: act self indulgence everyone except newlyweds, extreme pressure grandma/mom/extended family wants them. may want cancel, ""don't want hurt people's feelings mommy law shelled $50k could invite 150 people list"" 


So many weddings like that, western ones across variety cultures. 


Our wedding act ultimate indulgence. went out, yet invited people wanted (which 5 people plus us). food partner wanted eat, venue wanted, people wanted. That's really, really rare though. family tried guilt trip us differently. told tried tell us things, we'd cancel invitation. Again, people cave pressure. It’s looks way. thought also purchased lot British Oxford one well? suicides drug/alcohol abuse usually spike recessions. That's one many points human cost economic turns. ""bUt pOpUlAtIoN size!""

""yOu lOOk pEr pERsOn!"" Wow many people even know Vaccine Injury Compensation Program precise filing one terms deadlines. People blindly go thinking big pharma wants what’s best money. didn’t know lawsuit suspension either. Thank you! ideal situation right easy time look new job either. I've changed working hours commute every 3 months, mean long weeks away home. I'm going look work locally I'm back home late October. ""Eh, retired contributing much economy anyway."" went bars.... wasn’t live music? amusing people think serious. Honestly k ow getting Downvoted saying this. fucking truth.

Reddit fickle hypocritical. Im vaccinated I’ve never flu vaccine. don’t know take winter. I’m working home use delivery services. venue that's flexible rescheduling due COVID must run real scumbag. They've already got money canceling booking, matter change date 8 months something? American Man: like Florida Man stupid American behavior. 

Yes, people countries dumb times incident American Man thing do. important factor regarding Sweden chose strategy. Really? reading news day going on. recall anyone saying safer protest stay home. source? Goto court house, one gives shit wedding mothers. Hey every boy deserves day princess too! They're bad people, optimistic. Reality going sink us once. change slow burn reaches us. could virtually instead, plan celebration lot less stress later things settle down, way one risk getting sick still married. 
I know lot money already put may never get back (I recommend consulting lawyer regarding contracts signed venues see help break contracts). 
But health life, along health lives soon-to-be spouse, invited big day significantly important valuable money spent, may get back. can't help think horror stories weddings going ahead bride groom dying shortly ended catching Covid wedding... Proof: No. people going leave city take jobs them. Run away subdivision. 

Why can’t parents children public schools fix them? worse public schools filled parents don’t give shit. can’t force someone care child’s education. aren’t using live attenuated vaccines side effects far minor. Oxford one viral vector (despite name isn’t virus doesn’t produce live virus) leads production spike protein cells. Moderna one mRNA based vaccine works similarly. serious side effects initial polio vaccine due live, albeit attenuated, polio. Fever etc may side effect, one resulting poor design, side effect associated good vaccine “working.” got wrong. **checks notes**

 *I'm* selfish one dragging girlfriend friends wedding. flu also novel virus vaccine.

A vaccine cut deaths dramatically, comparable level. virus still exist.

You think sane course action continually reapplying disruptive measures social distancing virus exists; spoiler alert likely forever point.

So think put thousands work, harm peoples mental health, enforce strict social distancing stop people seeing family friends something could ultimately kill less people day car accidents. funny thing still super date places, puts Arkansas State University AR ~40 cases apiece. 137 639 respectively. WEAR. FUCKING. MASKS. American thing I’ve seen today. someone forced go 12 years Catholic school, good riddance. difference one justified party. problem idea wearing mask = weak. wore mask every day work still managed catch COVID, albeit mild go recovered easily. article August 25, posted lot around then.

Since then, also documented case reinfection US, among others: gotcha. people fail realize shield laws protect many industries, Big Pharma many. fight Congress next COVID bill hinges blanket shield law read language, suspends lawsuits 2-3 years whether COVID related Sweden took realistic approach disease. Closing society madness. fucked elderly care though. big DAAAAAAYYYYYY! I'm fucking princesSSSS. I’m going guess it’s “political/liberal” thing “my fucking deposit” issue. Thank kind person. longer afraid future  Yeah right, countries first wave yet. slowing testing idiotic thing Bullshit That’s good. Correct, protests outdoors chance catching tiny. 275 people enclosed space sheer stupidity. seems like sarcasm went people's heads. way now: matter headline, forget couple months.  aren’t. Plus death certificates simply printed stamped make official. go buy paper lol. Money. would likely lose deposits, potentially even venue, caterers, DJ, etc. move date. Literally months planning would destroyed would thousands dollars.

I would still cancel, might help understand people won't. never wanted big fancy wedding. Getting engaged soon think we're gonna court house it! pumped!

Then blows party. People hardly make sacrifices even best times. government failing give us economic security. long people fear falling permanent impoverished underclass, making sacrifices isn’t going happen. Madness. former teacher Catholic school, I'm trying see downside here. can't. 56 cases *so far* Never heard — check out: thanks! Funny several weddings years 200+ people them. makes distancing obviously, found people flu. one else caught wedding. COVID bad flu, surely. people manufacturing shit must laugh heads off. narrative failing.  not. Even though posted story before. Thanks clarification. Way leftist Bernie. need source lol? Uncaring freak. Go spread animal. Anytime country fails contain shit like flatten curve government failed people. know fact countries kept virus bay outbreaks promptly contained aggressive contact tracing. long countries succeeded failure.

You need study assuage guilt? tell going ok now, dont worry it, killing people lol? Snowflake. Nah, China's regime pretty bad yes. terms strictness. dumb give false information confuse masses. point disagree medical staff. That's bad. Lol Apples oranges early days people said probably going burn India seems case. It’s going rip population :( Ignant supposed mexican Bernie Sanders  Iraq testing rate 40k per million crying loud priviliged

Check privilege.

Yes I'm mexican, no, burrito hat, fact I'm german-mexican, priviliged.

Yes, exist, official mexico name ""Estados Unidos Mexicanos"".

Thanks, viva mexico. think time one mentions ccp sub, comments get deleted!

Comments still 9 hours later. I'm sure that's relevant somehow. Pretty sure human rights UN would agree lol uhhh....the rate new cases decreasing far... can't eliminate risk here, people working facilities accidentally bring well. Thank TheftNoodles saving bunch money life coach. time, way slow spread seemed lockdowns obviously work. Honestly think even successfully implement one country like India. 
After months, virus became less important economy people's livelihoods became important, understandable country poor.

I may sound biased, think number cases bad, considering half economy jobs already open, obv population. 

That course mean continue like forever 1000 deaths day. vaccines seem hope Protesters 6 feet away. Yeah fucked up, probably best get nuked. agree that, always thinking critically.

The problem I'm people say see problem getting information YouTube, Facebook Instagram.

At least traditional media sued spew misinformation, might also worried reputation, youtube anyone create channel there's easy way get you, reputation requirement also much lower. ... malinche! could, take it. wanted start get rid virus nuking US would effective tbh. Uh, protests at? here, attended whole bunch them, saw 98%+ mask wearing, volunteers paying free hand sanitizer extra masks. once, saw NYPD wearing masks protestors despite outnumbered 10 1. literally US Yes protesters other's faces.  guess virtue signaling. They’ve said beginning fall timeline vaccine. Trump using timeline advantage. Like does. Yeah, like worry losing grandma nanna disease too. nice worry, friends moved Melbourne, like too. Selfishness worth infecting population millions disease know little about. course, picked two week sample data didn’t say seven day average 1/2 it’s peak July less recently August 12th. But, continue rise. Vietnam showing us it’s done! Canada like lone guy crazy ass hemisphere. Keeping barrier rest America's screwed. pray they'll fine. Leave saints God's article posted? whataboutism. Particularly unwilling. legitimately thought going “oh wait I’m actually talking Trump” end takes week get results, functionally different testing shortage. star entire America's seems fucked. Canada okay. even get increase schools opening. so, triple official, reported numbers, essentially. ascertained that, how? wherewithal independently track deaths every city village Mexico? India lock 163 days reported 86k+ cases today, ever recorded. India lockdown shown stop spread. point lockdowns never get cases near zero, pretty much impossible. study link credible source claims lockdown get cases near zero I'd love see it. Livemint Indian media source. expected try “flip” China “flipping” things. 3. Numbers decline one afford get tested

4. Shit explodes even worse everybody get tested really make $ome money!? see every day. Several neighbors meet smoke, day, every day. Never seen single mask them. Probably interfering ability smoke. sad normally trustworthy government agencies--the CDC, FDA, etc.--have obviously corrupted politics need depend promises Pharma CEOs. Who, noted, immune political regulatory financial pressure bend promises little.

I agree someone else said: Fauci's word gold standard. He's one players thing corrupted bullied. Anti China bots incoming! glad live do

I'm sure do. get hang bars, demand places suffer so.  act like one thing though

Did he? think point reddit quick point right wing bullshit super slow point left wing bullshit use critical thinking skills. takes couple months, Wuhan it. believe they're happy results now, gruelling was. New Zealand, three weeks, even duration disease people.

That's thing too, btw. talk hard allowed carry day might absent pandemic, disease cake walk either. take weeks, causes funerals, cause lasting damage fatigue. likely cause things yet know, we're praying mutations mild form, yet know novel virus petri dish billion here. know going get.

So lockdown, let rest world experiment it, take weeks bit chill - get novel virus, spend weeks bed, hopefully need hospital hopefully lose many loved ones. *Yes*, markets may prefer everyone continues before, know what? They'll still tomorrow. chill too.

On note too, point Australia region world *has* contained/heavily suppressed it, Malaysia Vietnam Thailand China South Korea Hong Kong Fiji PNG... We'd isolating whole country many nearest neighbours, many trading partners, pursued approach. Markets like either. *Nor* would mining industry, basically underground cruise ships bunker accommodation. That's half exports iirc, potentially adding currency problems everything else things turn shit.

It's complicated problem, sure, feel anyone say Victoria definitively wrong course here. There's many factors play. India currently tests 1 million people everyday we've crashed 80k barrier, currently highest world. 1.4 million tests Mexico. IIRC, even Brazil one point test positivity rate 50%. Parent’s went Mexico last month brought back COVID infected gf, careful around friend gets back Yeah, virus knows congregating good reason bad one. Vietnamese here, proud think good us. time, feel unfair Indians. Vietnam essentially 1 (or something like 1.5 most), variations term perceptions, cultures general problems, especially survival stuffs. means deal far fewer ""temporary negative"" outliers causing chaos. India like 14 times bigger population combination dozens kingdoms past. would much complex variations every single aspects. Getting people huge variations boat virtually imposible, unless willing sacrifire freedom ruling people iron fist like China. So, imho, like little bit political would make big difference. hospital someone explain death, might collected samples research further. possible submitted sample test June, county fucked also sent notification her. dude claimed r/India credible source. said r/India best source things. topic? Pfft. Omg one week later.

Being extremist wanting force people wear masks leave bad pandemic feel like.

And also, I'm fucking sick tired trying explain masks work moronic people. Drinking bleach bad you, it, masks clear that. need masks control thing. least drink bleach kill wearing mask, endanger people around you.

**You** fucking use brain. something using masks, need get checked old ticker might rotten. want force people wear them, gullible seem. 

Your comments retarded. one? Last time went, merchant yelled ""ow rat bit me"" people laughed. actual number deaths around 201k there’s reporting go wedding end jail. Uh.... already spread air. Brother please straw man lies somewhere else leave sub coronavirus discussions 250 fine? Christ, cost business looks like I'm gonna need start promoting lemming parties. I'm begging please, please get flu shot year-- already widely available, usually free insurance. Hospitals going overwhelmed even already fall winter, even flu make horribly sick, could still end spreading someone vulnerable. could also end catching both, would catastrophic. hear hiv still around believe them. Always money people. There’s straight concern think lol. Trying convince go socialize people tonight, least go drop somewhere can. Told didn’t want drive hour drop drink right got fairly serious car accident last week mom rolled eyes succeeded Italy Asian countries USA number 1 fucking up. Anyone advocating go point ashamed. Idk got impression. 


Most people sub US. makes sense they're focused issues. there's general awareness situation pretty awful Mexico, Brazil, India alike.  you... Supreme Leader Kim? can't vaccinate stupid people Tpr still 9%. So, increasing testing one reason nuke start situation fucked Modi h toh munkin h...
Seriously though, initial country wide lockdown stunt, getting PR boost. Now, can't lockdown anymore, economy shattered mean paid sometimes, way better never huge ramp infrastructure items testing vaccine. Sadly, ramp took long testing supplies we’re paying price now. Distribution f’d up. infrastructure ramp better, however risks competing global marketplace demand far outstrips supply. Distribution still remains big hurdle, especially considering environmental sensitivity two leading vaccine candidates. 

With standing greatly diminished around world, US can’t throw weight around secure supplies like might done last. least I'm US, tell last time saw someone _not_ wearing mask public. We’ve practicing social distancing

Correction. people practicing it. Many quite obviously haven't. Including guy thinks he's smart underestimating virus made post 14 hours ago anti-science posts picked middle night. Strange. still stages go coming acceptance, give time. Oh yah - definitely makes sense take advantage sheepskin effect close. (And taking job without graduating might make sense could get credits needed degree soon night school)

I musing company side. “China haters”, this, paid CCP propaganda piece? help here. There's already state ID happened within county. another white racist reddit. else new? Let's see hold pledge Trump threatens bottom line.  1 Sturgis motorcycle returnee attends 275 person wedding. infect 56 single day!

You gotta love it. think way get desserts, maybe just, get 'em.

Maybe 56 about, infected another 56 each? That's 3000 total.

Another round, yes? course, yes. tested for, quarantined for, masked against.

To get 400,000 dead, folks full share.

We wait see. cannot fathom many states seemingly prioritize *bars* things trying reopen. many revenue-generating businesses / places could less risky reopen surprising. America many many obese and/or diabetic citizens. Still sad though. median age 19. shit problem. 91% deaths US people 55. I'm pretty sure downvotes argument (""young people super low risk dying"") generally used mean ""I'm young, therefore affect I'm going worry it."" Yes, statistically young people low risk death. No, give young people pass ignore risks. get severely ill without dying, spread others higher risk groups. Probably true. trying point large portion participants able determine certainty group they're in. virus *targeting* different races different ways. Black people disproportionately higher rates diabetes, heart disease, etc. results worse population-level effects pandemic. clinically relevant inherently racial differences biological mechanisms governing viral susceptibility vaccine safety efficacy. answering question OP ask. money's Corona win. Coverup... coverup Go Winchester, pint wait blow over. Happy law school online semester. Save time money driving school corona. Sounds like win win me. see point making people physically together laptops internet. think asked people married long time wish banked money spent service reception rather traditional wedding service reception, surprised many would tell you, yeah, wish they'd done that.

I relatively small formal wedding service reception hey Adams downtown DC 1996. Including wedding party, 55 people attendance. Hay Adams however, expensive. parents paid whole thing. Truth told, absolutely arguing mother phase trying decide, formal wedding reception, parents, fiance run Jamaica combined wedding vacation? definitely wanted latter. wedding ceremony reception seemed enormously stressful, 29 years old already 7 years pretty serious professional career bogged work, name it.

My mother would gone along whatever decided. come decision looming closer asked consider rest family. grandparents still living, close extended family aunts uncles cousins absolutely looking forward trip nation's capital wedding.

I basically got shamed traditional wedding reception. regret necessarily, coming 24 years later, would nice money put payment house, thing would happen another five six years actually married.

All say, lot consideration family dynamic, peace family, well family expectations go decision monumental. think that’s point. Wow stupid little website. answers say stay home. joke is, cases dropping steadily want open everything ""five minutes sunshine"" close longer. Good. Ivermectin actually shown promise. shame hydroxychloroquine fiasco misdirected many resources testing something useless Covid. post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).*  Masks became battleground, people started forgetting parts people like us make 1% Reddit yet actual street normal? Censorship? nurse, work medical facility, never bullied going anyone’s wedding. 

My mantra weddings always I’m invited dinner, don’t go (or send card). I’m worth expense meal, aren’t worth $100 gift. 

I guess need add Covid rule big selfish COVID wedding- gift all? 

My coworker wed summer cancelled big wedding honeymoon, small family ceremony outdoors. nurses fucking morons. responsibly.

Well there's problem. Lots people think responsible downright communist anti-American. unironically. 6 years ago 55% didn’t want independence. seriously believe that’s still case? Opinion polls would suggest otherwise.. http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/UFCs-Matt-Hughes-Shrugs-Shakes-His-Head.gif Indoor outdoor? city state? concerning involved, many people state died heart disease, traffic accident, even died shower time period?

Im saying dont take take covid seriously, saying, get fucking context. Ah...the silver lining offense, annoying. get already. work beauty industry right. Sometimes severely punished participating trash sorority. Nothing like killing progress.... got pregnancy announcement. kind gently rolled eyes mentally wished well. figured we’d respond baby arrived. “But Comrade Dyatlov, reactor!” Ayep. lancet study flawed. MMMMMMkay.

Edit: Looking post history, see ""It's flu/no harmful flu"" type individual. Good luck everything. Im beat man wedding days cant believe still damn wedding. prayed would cancel nope Sure. dying healthy prior two different things. bout plain old pneumonia last year (not Covid), breathing still fucked almost year later. wouldn’t wish anyone. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ""I know dude"" considered real source thoughts correlation covid19 mortality influenza vaccination rates Europe?

E.g. Peru v Uruguay.? officially dead per capita (in September) nation didn’t lockdown...?  would measles. robust resurgence despite long term vaccinations enlightening psychological curve many americans longer covid around. fact downvoted sad. 

Are science stats welcomed sub?  Sure not? Bring cases back up. Sounds like joke unless actually known true narcissists sociopaths. market watch study....(here's link ACTUAL seriously flawed. begin with, studied 59 people. inital study plan called minimum 155. also studied people one hospital one part world (China).

Makes sense couldnt stand business majors college totally vibed STEM peeps. would least 300.000 euro Netherlands( 330.000 dollar ). Americans infinite space Seatbelts, too. freedom.  Make America great again... title is"" Labor Day gatherings health experts warned coronavirus pandemic "" shows shot moderately filled beach. disinformation. Depends age group That's flu strain via mRNA. Oxford's works differently, using genetically engineered virus, adenovirus, taken chimps modified replicate sicken people. carries gene one proteins SARS-Cov-2 inserts recipient’s cells. regard actual coronavirus approach, Oxford indeed along currently. gave son wife budget. told much money could us, could whatever wanted it. want wedding invite people? Fine here's budget. Want go destination wedding two you? Fine. Here's budget.

They opted week expenses inclusive destination wedding Bahamas. thing insisted upon budget get photography package could pictures. Several years later, still deeply satisfied decision made. know areas, Madrid, current high rate infection, everyone pretending like can't catch family friends. Parks full big gatherings weekend, people wearing masks. People sit right next large group friends restaurant patios like nothing. real good thing forced mask use stores public transport think would ton idiots wearing them. Take lever worth.... wore mask kept hands clean sanitizer (often atmosphere) think guys okay! 

I'm going wedding end month I'm worried people masking up. wedding stacked healthcare workers. human make dumb life choices. hope everyone okay. wouldn’t even care it’s people infect wasn’t wedding even know fucked up. Everyone attended assholes. Good point. Thank request, comrade.

u/G00dcoffee said N-word. Americans Impetuous costing money lives Exactly Yeah funnier cause top comment basically putting flashing neon sign phenomena. US never unified national strategy.

!RemindMe 4 months anti maskers apply logic say ""but look well sweden doing"". I’m conservative this. Still blows mind become political. Nothing says ""I love spouse, family, friends"" like making come wedding pandemic, feel like shit they're smart go. I've shot weddings feel bad, y'all jackasses. know. people think would know everything new virus. think that's awesome decision! traditional wedding, middle pandemic back 1996. lovely, guess regret it, seemed awful lot hoopla expense short amount time. big party settled marriage bolster seems much fitting, times times. Congratulations! Cloth covering compulsory followed implemented. Mask education hygiene information still exercised. People still preferring mask comfort mask safety. Cloth mask manufacturers also following guidelines masks ethically. people stopped underlying conditions. Sweden basically killed half population. strategy right? figured this. risks. Intelligent people risk-averse. plan rather act. people go business? 

They risk-takers. people mortgage entire families life savings put endeavour. people go parents mortgage house risk. lot fail. But, right place right time succeed. 

This create business culture risk-takers fine risking others benefit. Meanwhile, people risk-averse tend end employees people never pulled trigger. 

That's see it. wits slug intelligence. selfish risk-taking lot cases, corner-cutting borderline illegal, screw everybody behaviour. There's lot great business people there. specific personality type always baffled think risk-prone people capable empathy consequences beyond themselves. system set benefit them. also loudest ones smart hard-working are. Meanwhile, beg borrowed risked everybody else capital. bunch people commenting headline article read.

That frequently happens even full text readily available lol Use old Reddit, go r/all, block ass Well think rando read comments suddenly ""see light""' switch viewpoints.

They also think pour tiny bit doubt head it'll add up

What expect putting self induced logic catch 22s use fav opinions them.

They also waste time answering stupid questions instead trolling others. person who's time wasted mine.  Neither archive.is

This first website I’ve ever seen Archive didn’t work! must military grade paywall lol drive kills neighbors target. Weddings aren’t worth risking life fuck wrong people Statistically, grandpa already dead decent chunk time. brainwashed comment society made people, especially female persuasion, think NEED big expensive wedding order get married person love, simply don't. amount money spend wedding equal much love eachother mean less deserving marriage love. issue people want big fancy expensive weddings, love looking venues, setups, photos captured, they're really beautiful events, necessary, especially middle pandemic. nothing luxury right luxury worth dying imho. future? non-normal Christmas ain’t Christmas! Sure created, cultivated, tested mutated lab, lab got grant 3.7mil surprise, surprise, Obama. Half tru mex def prideful like appearing weak Yes different AIDS.

It is, still took 60-70 years would noticed overflowing cemeteries.

Not necessary: outbreak specific location mean virus propagating slowly elsewhere first. factors necessary identify virus going viral (so speak): big concentration population, big mobility population (Wuhan transport industrial hub), etc. 

To give concrete example, Spanish Flu ravaging Europe WWI, know today likely origin rural area Kensas US.

We also look [genomic know today Chinese strain European common ancestor directly related (they're cousins), main US strain mainly derived European strain (early cases Washington California China strain). logic flawed. believe this? Unless couple KNOWS Covid actively try spread it, moral responsibility accidentally spreading it. 

Did wear mask flu season past? Around 80k people die flu year, 50% cases asymptomatic spread way. didn’t wear mask, could say responsible old lady infected store died. See dumb sounds? Colleges bear 100% responsibility here. knew would happen resumed in-person classes done anyway, blaming students.

And many decide inevitably close, they’ll seed new COVID clusters around country. Go Rona, cooking books! hometown makes front page, why?

Can't say I'm surprised, honestly. Cancel Weddings idiots! event worth potentially losing life. guess us folks already lost love one Covid see things differently.... No, point you’re treating inactive leadership like free pass giving individuals free rein infect others. I’ve lost one best friends excluded friend group months must ridiculous reason ever falling-out. took huge offense us wanting hang lockdown words, we’re “sucking government’s cock” abiding lockdown rules. us apart least one parent either elderly unwell. 

We’ve started hanging (socially distanced) he’s completely excluded. doesn’t want talk us vice-versa. ridiculous needless. least know true character now. 2 3 top Chicago Catholic high schools $15k. standard, normal high school run Catholics. average Illinois whole 12k. average Oregon 10k. Idk Portland. might get Christmas, won’t normal though know instance Glastonbury already cancelled 2021. Events like expensive, guarantee control next year imagine insurance costly impossible get.

Plus events like long lead time decisions needed months advance maybe safe September next year, yiu decide January

They lost ton year, another cancellation could put alot events serious financial hardship goes 50%, would make obese people norm. Fat-shaming would become normal-size-shaming, makes sense. gonna one China: 1.2 billion people, 186 active cases

/s wife works healthcare work office environment. require us go work. would like place money, they’re US, 18 people WFH.

No “conspiracy” it. Nearly everyone know back work never stopped. don’t thinks so. think fear-mongering bullshit isn’t happening there. People much normal, realizing it’s possible move virus. Isn’t insane though? Dude COVID wild. friend worked like 3 years get it. He’s easily 300 lbs 6 feet. Guy obese, diabetic 40s. got COVID amongst circle mentally prepared dying. fever days, got tested multiple times came positive, weeks he’s fine about. time I’ve seen people 60s average shape straight die. Like don’t even know wtf expect. Tbh think grocery shopping means wasn’t really quarantine. earlier summer huge grocery run/haircut day 15 days literally went outside go walks/runs go play tennis other. schools able anticipate that... like **scads lawyers** whose job anticipate protect them.. make sure legal bases covered telling people TAKING MONEY.

Thank responsible Considering handled fuck world estimated 284k people died compared current total 886k deaths? China refused play ball groups like basically told countries fuck despite caused something repeatedly warned over, could prevented multiple stages existed Chernobyl like incompetence continued. Reddit especially subreddit US centric, crisis affected US probably worst considering ""status"" ""first world country"". That's all. countries struggled faired better even economically have. Also, ""culture"".... let's go there.

You can't treat people like statistics, here. That's thing wrong. even listening statistics. potential short term profit. 

But realize what's good people good economy. Healthy people, good economy. Unhealthy people, unhealthy economy. We're crashing burning there's unified effort, fault individualism like many like believe ignorance. I'm staunchly individualistic person even understand affects greater forces also affect people love, mention empathy others similar boats. We've failed every way, empathetically intellectually.


These short sighted people like toddlers marshmallow experiment eat immediately can't forsee they'll get another marshmallow future saved it. ones running everything they're majority. Like parasite companies pick another organization, suck dry, leave new one. Unfortunately, intelligent empathetic people woefully outnumbered nature.

Let's remember American military primary vector Spanish Flu went great lengths cover fact. flu virus risks ""accept""? No, question mortality rate decreased spreading misinformation. much deadly widely circulating infectious respiratory disease. dont even understand question. definitely BC - Covid. Well say eat so... closed provincial national parks Canada too, forced people go whatever regional parks left, instead couple people every trail, people packing onto one two trails government also telling us important stay active. giving us nowhere active. It’s definitely one things pisses response here. Wait.... know folks say moon landing false such, honestly realize folks believe 9/11 Sandy Hook faked. 

Is possible folks old enough lived 9/11 country? primarily live USA? 

This baffles me. history class high school towers fell TV. (Yeah, big ol' TV too, deeper wide.) Unfortunately assuming they’re US, from. 

That said, assumption used knowledge nearly everyone know *something* irresponsible daily weekends. 

It’s cannot it, fact Americans forced go work. game virus tought something is, deadly might ""evolve"" get mote deadly. already WFH, yes. don’t know people conspiratorial stuff. lot people hard self-isolate. something would chance, since traveling groups without risk oneself others, right tell to. Stay safe, good luck. Christian, people like infuriating. lot us value science. Government bail taxpayer handouts. Actually heard people masks nobody one yeah shame people careless People kept attacking FL, GA, TX hospitals going fail great NY people can't take L sit down. literally never heard school life mentioned Catholic school circles that's cause boarding school/high school. Kind different thing I'm talking about. top 3 Catholic schools Chicago Loyola, St. Ignatius, Fenwick. Loyola 15k, Fenwick 14k Ignatius actually lot thought 19k. Very, true agree sentiment 100% 👍 Sociologically, applied across population..exactly! Looking world leader particular, let's mention name. post oncr/sino shut fuck up. 100% disagree. 

It kind selfish without ensuring everyone quarantined/tested beforehand. simply ridiculous argue holding *any* event selfish. Sure sure. mean shit go get married fucking court use money would’ve spent wedding building block rest life Y'all idea I'm rooting hard normal Christmas year 2020... covid restrictions still place. 

The thing changed people's attitude. People cautious spring, pretty much nobody gives fuck :) No, wasn’t case all. wasn’t held anyone chose come. 

Plus, hotel generator. house didn’t. went wedding weekend yet know results Covid wise. ceremony simple, everyone wore mask. cocktail hour decided take masks drink. dinner nobody mask. drinks time nobody wore mask. friends went hug hadn’t seen year hugged (I know stupid). We’re idiots it’s natural thing do. feel bad this. I’m quarantining 2 weeks generally never leave house guess I’m saying it’s incredibly difficult enforce obey Covid safety rules settings. know wrong thing everyone’s safety going would jeopardized relationships missed wedding. 

I went another wedding family ceremony reception next year. much safer. i'm one you. god help us You’re right, public also needs step up. wish government could least lead way instead dividing us giving us conflicting information  national case numbers continue go down? Gotta start handing fines lawsuits. people causing massive loss life money. shipping end really see fuss about. shipping conditions routinely met every manufacturer enzymes biology research, diagnostics, medical supplies, well products. main difference would required documentation regulatory hurdles. Dry ice shipping normally available industrial quantities, put temperature logger shipment

But turns dry ice supply screwed up!

CO2 byproduct industries working lower capacity recession. Lots butchers shipping high end frozen meat direct consumers. lot used COVID research medical uses. 

It interesting see CDC gets commandeer dry ice supply, gets shafted. I'm letting know state, they're reporting transmission backyard parties masks worn. live northeast US state, pretty reputedly good contact tracing, reason suspect they're misleading people. dispute appears much less likely catch outside. attend events friends (rarely days), I'll attend they're outside, sure sit 10' feet others, bring drinks, wear mask, avoid going indoors. ""Johnny goes fun, same""? laugh family owns funeral homes old country (Europe) paranoid proper PPE safety guidelines employees. others? Repite Business. Perhaps milkshake good time live Santa Monica, asshat friends scheduled get married summer went wedding outdoor settings immediate family present broadcasted ceremony would’ve invited. me, seems like good compromise wonder relatives people died Covid-19 think Except nope,even false negatives also included here(The ones done PCR,i.e ones go confirmatory test). people dying, starving lack work, loosing education, houses, savings, cars businesses. Countries loosing economies profound , long-lasting economic social effects. good enough reason you? sure assume we're US agree mostly say. Although think economic response man made phenomenon mainly affected policies made much worse politics. That's also put place safeties 2008 crisis, thanks god otherwise would far affected now. 
Where live really strong social safety net, even economy restart properly people sink poverty. country one richest earth created debt going last affect generations come. sure ever know worth terms human suffering / lives saved / wealth. wut Forgive rolling eyes idea taking wedding Reddit seriously argues spending $10 wedding = DIVORCE!!

Covid-19 2:electric boogaloo Right, nothing suggest minority groups inherently susceptible virus; higher death rates explained sociological (higher incidence in-person work, larger households) epidemiological (higher incidence co-morbidities) factors. 

So uh, thanks agreeing me, guess. Poor people (who often POC USA) tend co-morbidities make likely get sick die bunch different diseases, covid. It’s black people different ACE2 receptors epithelial cells, rather live different socio-economic environments populations. makes difference. 

Remember whole thing started? telling us virus targets different races different ways?

In words, fatter people, tend poorer (and know obesity prevalent certain races ethnicities, even agreed true) would likelier suffer virus. 

Do observe reality? pandemic affected poor black Latino people groups? Yes. 

I’m sure simple fact gets panties tangled knot, are. worth pointing important thing restrictions exist paper, behaviour actually changes. Yeah what’s logic wearing mask protect them, done everything destroy health shorten lifespan. ""Only"". Patriotism made blind fact 70k happened real people. Also line reasoning exact line i've heard Indonesia Mexico. I’m sure won’t stop trying. Stop delusional. Stop watching republic tv believeing conspiracy theories Info SL (transport Stockholm) train companies showed huge decreases travel. Taxi usage Stockholm (they deliver covid home tests).

Stockholm definitely perfect social distancing bars got warnings (none closed permenantly) part pretty good. perfect alright. People socialising lot less, staying families/houses part. think city waking bit.

The mask thing Swedes reject them. officials prefer social distancing masks give people false sense security. E.g. one train company books 100% capacity give masks. others book 50% capacity masks that's still safer train. Finland also sod masks incredibly. Masks silver bullet.


If understand correctly biggest issue care homes staffing. whole host issues getting paid first sick day people would come sick, staff working multiple care homes, staff trained use little PPE etc. fixed gaps late sparked big debate around privatisation care homes staff rights.

The 'letting people die' stories came differences ICU care long covid. home country often put people ICU matter what. Sweden society prefers Swiss approach let people die calm, quiet way. I'm sure times doctors made wrong call believe systematic. different UK/US norms. 


Sweden definitely fucked stuff paid lot lives international press also painted inaccurate picture. infuriating. Sure buddy. 

Way creatively select data. Good
Better kindergartens number might seem huge but, India maintain 90k cases per day, would take ~40 years entire country (of 1.3b) infected. Paywall can’t read article #FARE See safely get another test? Thank posting this. absolutely cannot wrap brain around parents willingly risking child’s health possibly life want classroom.

I knew lot people never parents, pandemic shows insanely sociopathic large portion population is. use really believed parents would sort lizard brain drive protect offspring costs - it’s simply true. know lot people fine gambling child’s life don’t want inconvenienced. death long term health complications acceptable risk people? Endangering life child seen unacceptable solution!

We tech remote learning, isn’t dark ages. many hostile rejecting undoubtedly future education? saying everywhere everywhere yes. trying supersede science. science don’t actually know effective types masks are. Everyone’s wearing something different. good sign WTF?!? Stay home. #THAN *automatically deem Russian Chinese vaccines unsafe collude ensure vaccines control enter market used population ensuring people profiting vaccine*

*collude price gouge population*

This going used us it’s going pretty. “Throw hands air....

Wave em around like Corona’s there” Please consider eye protection too! 

Best luck Spain. hope go back classes...as sad kids miss out, least keeping online means alive ready join classes safe Experts predict going big wave Covid flu fall testing done triage hospitals tax system might situation either tests take long back log might enough tests patients every patient tested flu covid work way. can't add students middle semester. ""left"" response pandemic, thats far right people Sweden doesnt like it. US seems like right believe Sweden right thing. total opposite.

To add irony, currently extreme right former neo-nazi party want overrule health ministry police force people wear masks fined. Please keep discourse civil... Yes there’s chance, China Russia already vaccines. US doesn’t one, puts us way behind biggest rivals, GDP may shrink wouldn’t biggest economy world anymore. cluster killed three people go wedding.  
The spread leaked jail 2 nursing homes. 

And people still say, ""I'm going live life, afraid little tiny virus stay home..."" Clearly, works. things like happen. Goddamn, stupid, selfish creatures. hate people always go extremes. arguments end world. course end world mean everything fine either. virus terrible. around 2 million expected deaths per year US. would let virus run rampant could seen one two million deaths within month two. three four million total deaths 2020. twice many days expected clearly that's end world imagine Des expect year compressed single month. horrible! would difficult us handle. shut prevented lot happening quickly. deaths come. still extra 1 million deaths spreading year makes much manageable. something mandated doesn’t mean actually happening everywhere doesn’t mean it’s enforced meaningfully.

I don’t mean burst bubble anecdote doesn’t supersede science. Man, think go exams, may COVID-19 may something else, another disease.. dad goes rally usually (not year though). loooooot milieu conspiracy nuts many probably refused wear masks. half regular old dudes, good chunk buy whole “tough-guys-don’t-wear-masks” narrative. absolutely nailed it! Look Australia New Zealand, one lockdown 4 months ago they're done! Imagine hardcore lockdown existing today extended 2 weeks! Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* per capita likely. officially us undercounting more. burning Man desert? whoever ""noticed"" people turning anyway also turned empty desert 🤔  Eh sure, even improperly worn stuff lowers risk, shown examples Korea, areas properly worn masks really really good job. good job, we'd whole lot medical staff. So, honestly, easily see Sturgis thing spread. vote laugh. Gnats suck. somewhat disagree. politically motivated protests gets OK hikes banned make authorities look impartial deadliness virus sudden negotiable. 

I think right thinking so, last line correct nonetheless, public relations standpoint ideal situation. agree. 6% caught COVID. rest caught 'complications'. lifted lot restrictions still lifting more.
But time implementing new ones like masks public Transport shops.

At time open nightclubs without masks 100-300 peoples.
We decided allow events 1000 people ""protection"" concept approved canton.

We also decided allow sports events 2/3 stadion capacity.
But wear mask. 
And selling food drinking allowed.

In daily life i'm regularly passing 4-5 cantons.
Every canton different rules regarding masks shops restaurants.
In public transport, masks required nation wide.

Lets say mess. assignment away two months Carribbean. wedding postponed husband flew eloped working there. flew back middle week booked last minute flight, flew direct major airport 4 hrs away spend layovers hotspot take crowded puddle jumper home. 

We decided get cabin resort 2 nights little minimoon near flew in. Figured outdoor couple activities separate cabin would fine. soon weekend hit, resort crawling people coming wedding none wearing masks social distancing common areas view resort staff. infuriating. Covid starting bad US spring newscasts showed Mexico absolutely nothing. result. burst anyone’s bubble pa we’ve 2nd strict COVID guidelines entire country. Everyone wears masks inside outside upside cases continuing rise now. Unless mandate official type mask use don’t see point. Stay away wash ur hands. Pretty simple. kind speak FB though. depends many factors:

1) often use it

2) kind people/organizations friends with/follow

3) primary goal using it

I use stay up-to-date hobbies state's COVID plan. Outside that, maybe 10% feed actually friend content, 10% mostly random memes, insight teachers faring, random thoughts. actually enjoy FB feed South Africa 36500 excess deaths August 21st. That's nearly 3 times higher official toll. UK excess deaths little 50% higher.

South Africa's death toll lower far, 7 times lower.

UK hit hard time dense international air travel regions (NY, North Italy, etc). South Africa, like Latin America etc relative latecomer. explained dont count. Look rest Scandinavia see Swedens number be.

What happend rest world tragedy. happend Sweden crime. Thats Sweden worse. question quickly coronavirus creates new strains. turns relatively quick (like flu) really fucked. Kids might die tend super spreaders Australia easiest flu season memory, measures covid-19 flu.

So basically. let guard flu slap you, covid-19 knock out. able, get flu jab. It'll help keep keep hospitals free don’t know saw previous comment post, never said protests didn’t add case load. almost definitely did. Whether number significant another matter, paired outdoor environment wearing masks, resulting case number likely minimal. Recent studies support this, saying spikes somehow protests fault inaccurate. Regarding physics, issue applying theoretical concept something highly dependent simply wrong place wrong time. many variables regarding infection simply use equation. I'm going by. live abroad work London. coming back work 6 weeks soon Im fully expecting sack job winter. I've planning financially year since lockdown begun. danger job (care worker), preexisting conditions potential 2-4 week quarantine either countries begin quarantine again, I'll better riding winter home eating bowls rice income risking going back forth risking health. I'm 0 hours contracts work = pay course, working home. gets point worth risk picks many expect come late October onwards, I'll hunkering home praying nothing house breaks money extremely tight. particular case, students deserve refund. previously reprimanded warnings sign document saying read rules book except punishment continue breaking guidelines. ok Reuters needs date sources. fairly certain point market origin.

Plus, disinfected market trillion times now, really found? *Belarus entered chat* 6.5 million positive cases. Yeah know. refering general situation North america. course USA worst moment. Mexican American means little last months pandemic. Maybe proximity US that's causing spike. Sir there's pandemic. Please touching! Yes, here's better source, Recovered April, cant say stamina come back yet altitude. longer stay notice drop certain point (The Certes offramp Coquihalla highway specific, whatever altitude there).

I havent let stop much, complain son's brisk walking pace first time. lol! Lol mother traveled Mexico US. called stupid buddy start iv guy jumped border fence(probably distraction). dude screaming convinced going inject covid. yah, think population scared really firm grasp works. [never can't believe Mexico would kill hundreds thousands people prevent trump winning. Nice try, deep state. Imo younger people (on average) tend experience things instead thinking carefully (because much experience older people yet, know, process building knowledge) totally normal behavior due human nature.

And might willing sacrifice fun need.

Hence case (where spread without feeling ill) think probably realise consequences happens late. know always tend think things happen others happens us.

(Not saying young people bad people, I've there, could done same) ""Hey curve......you're breathtaking!"" balance, make sense. It’s woke virus. proximity US? I've heard many ""people"" denying pandemic going vacation anyway. Sucks Mexico. “Murder 3 people possibly more?”

I get you’re saying would involuntary manslaughter impossible make even charge stick 😣

Civilly though — civil cases different standard. fervently hope someone sues lot them. know US Mexico place right rapid point-of-care tests would need order death certificates advanced?! Aren’t created case case? seriously think people go forever seeing families? 

If alternative risking families health safety? Yes, moron would think that's outcome this.

I guess think world leaders health medical leaders shutdown society billionaires ceos politicians agreed idiots? Yes. get it. much preparation people usually putting weddings, nicer atmosphere, realize Corona make whole wedding bad mood. 
Why would spend tens thousands nicer food, postpone wait Corona. Yep, requires negative PCR test 14 day quarantine upon arrival say masks effective miles away? say virus transmissible miles away? That's like saying ""I talked girl phone think got pregnant""

And ""American sources""... Uh... 2nd study linked UK. Besides, country origin data?

Nothing saying makes sense. suppose inspire confidence? Lol Hey everyone, wanted little symptom check guys hear thoughts, mind. 


Firstly, exposed anyone Covid know about. past week (as number infected sadly going lot Prague) I've mostly isolating, although go 25 person wedding party nine days ago outdoors talked maybe four five people pretty safe distance. one reported getting infected wedding knowledge, I'd presume safe, that's really high risk activity I've partaken in. Otherwise I've met people avoided indoor spots (and always worn mask go indoors).  


My symptoms developed initially Thursday (three days ago), fatigue (not heavy), bit sore throat (in front, like Adam's Apple) come gone even first symptoms started might related looking laptop hours end. Bad habit, know :) 


Friday felt ill, like one would feel first get flu cold. Malaise, loss appetite, generally unwell (although horrifically), big symptom big headache sinus area behind eyes. really came went sleep felt bit sleep, despite taking paracetamol. got 11 hours sleep in. 


Saturday sort day feeling, malaise bit achy feeling unwell, little appetite. symptoms (no fever, cough, etc). bit loose stool morning, diarrhea. headache popped bit evening, might due staring screen day. Similarly right side, behind ribs, tiny bit sore again, perhaps due sitting lying day.

&amp;#x200B;

Today (Sunday) I've feeling pretty well, definitely better. Slept another 10-11 hours last night. big breakfast usual energy. still bit malaise occasional unwell, icky feeling pops up. also getting little twinges different parts body-- heart, right side ribs, legs, seems like fluttering vein. heart rate goes feels heavy stand move quickly. felt distinct yesterday though. tightness solar plexus, again, sitting weird position laptop legs day cause this. otherwise, cough, normal temperature (max 36.5C), things generally feeling okay. 

 
Today would day four symptoms. feel better yesterday Friday, course reading horror stories, people tell watch day five onward, think good things get suddenly worse. 


Today I'll keep inside stay isolating resting. I'm taking daily multi-vitamin, 35mg Zinc, 1000mg Vitamin C, magnesium vein fluttering see helps. course chicken soup ridiculous amount water intake.  


I may well overreacting, absolutely nature so. based description, think covid legit worry, would guess sort short term bug immune system dealt I'm taking days get past vestiges whatever was? anyone start Covid like this, I'd interested hear developed. guess would quite mild case, were, I'm still hoping get due whatever effects come road. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone! Honestly, India may country cases. mean, lack safety health even this. instant capitalistic pigs responsible governments sober party actually pretty fun used it. sucks period... China lucky right now. idiots anti maskers Karens would listen stfu point Many...look latent TB. [never worst leader world. Yes.  we're planning seeing physically rest year.  mum 70, I'm vulnerable, rest care much endanger us. fear countries looking USA UK disbelief actually lucky thus far equally torrid time coming months. Source? plan I'm talking detailed official campaign site I'm aware he's made changes reflected changes campaign site. fact official campaign site updated unity task force changes.

I guess could definitely argue campaign promise plan significantly different whatever passes usually case due realities aligning entire Congress behind plan. that's really different point altogether Yeah.
But go time, answer slavic countries denying covid's existence first place. India’s rest positivity rate also hovering around 7%. bad! agree bots probably go lives shrug 'they decided come' 200k dead counting... way beyond doomerism. 

I remembered said fake. lol. still thing excessive precaution. Avoiding covid put danger ways. example, driving 15 hours avoid stopping could mean avoid small covid risk take big accident risk driving tired (I think people we're responding multiple drivers, 1 driver, I'd say driving 15 hours straight would increase risk death overall, even covid risk went little). Facebook really strange place. There's lot anti-mask groups could accept people viewpoint need scroll anti-mask groups long start talking depopulation, lizard people, flat earth. People believe one conspiracy theory never believe one two, believe them.

I saw Guardian think probably right; people bad place, maybe lost jobs still family feed. Believing conspiracy theory gives people sense control back. old work colleague, seem 12+ years suddenly gone lizard people realize kid job decade, must hard her. Food poisoning. Though let's honest, tell flat going why, send nice present. Brrr reddit hive mind brrr trump ok brrrr went cousins wedding weeks ago, small event, outside, figured relatively smart people would take proper precautions. Walked minutes ceremony started, sat down, looked around, realized boyfriend ones masks. stayed long enough finish ceremony Irish exited. sure liberal anything it. idiots parts political spectrum. Anti vaxxers primarily liberal moms, anti 5gs old conservatives. Covid political issue. Well ... till death part guess 2 people + 2 masks + county courthouse = certified marriage covid19 cases need outside classes Internet.
It's cheaper give students laptop WiFi card open school. Ah panic mode ... like turtles supposed sympathy people buy breeders? meant people initial attendees interacted with. Trace modeling. everyone exposed symptoms, may initially mild spread virus people, takes weeks longer see. That’s two-week window sometimes inaccurate. Remember super-spreaders? initial point contact become infected wind spreading many others. don’t know super-spreaders ones infecting others rally ones getting infected, subsequently infecting others later on. least 260 cases 11 states tied directly event, according survey health departments Washington believe figure significant undercount, due resistance rallygoers testing limited contact tracing states. result, true scope infections stemming rally ran Aug. 7 Aug. 16 unlikely ever Sadly they're not.

They're smart.  COVID fucked year possibly next well. still less 2 years would know tested camps? Unlike Sinovac workers, forced medical tests aren’t publicised obvious reasons. peer reviewed source this? mean bullshit.

But, still plenty corrupt fighting causes. don’t know. information, I’m ready buy they’ve turned new leaf, that’s me. actually went wedding yesterday outside. Majority masked antimaskers. night went on, people getting drunk, seeing people without masks... end night nearly everyone without mask, jumping dancing dance floor 1-3 inches know America don’t understand can’t nice things better way celebrate love other, trying kill many friends family possible! 💕 cousin wedding yesterday. Weirdly, nurse many family members attended. One attendee even works public health master's field. get it. Probably also sucks dead guy thought embarking lifetime journey one loves. Everyone needs wake up, virus doesn’t care are, wants host. fact one person potentially close proximity strangers, potentially close proximity strangers, close proximity strangers.

Let's math. Let's say, one day, pass 10 people. 10 people close proximity 10 people. simple assumption every person pass  2 degree separation, potentially may exposed 1000 (10 \* 10 \* 10). That's everyone fairly small town, 1/10th small city 10000. add zero somewhere, easily goes 10000.

So, thought small gather 3 5 turned gathering 3000-5000 terms possible exposure, simple assumption everyone met day exposure 10 unique persons, 2 degree connection.

So, yea. Unless really need to, I'm staying in, masking (mask plus) shielding indoors, keep exposure time low far people ain't wearing masks. actually didn’t pressure anyone come lol
Our motto “if come, great. can’t, worries.”

That means *live* 5 people, probably infect 1 them.

So .. sure sit next someone bar Covid might get it, chance far definite. Seriously, fuck wrong Americans? dumbest, pigheadedly obnoxious entitled assholes planet. think everyone losing plot, world.

My friends recently birthday party 1 year old. go, neither baby (my husband did, wore mask, kept distance, used hand sanitiser, showered got home.)

But party largely comprised doctors families, adhering guidelines set WHO. situation fraught seriously health issues, but... fuck. guys? scaled daughters wedding 200+ guests tiered list guests starting 10 person wedding scaling possible 20 person wedding. 

It moved friends ranch daughters back yard, masks enforced set tables set ""households"" people live together sit together.

It giant pain ass daughters words ""I want kill grandma, dream wedding.""

We figure throw reception 5th anniversary something.z

Edit: also strict RSVP protocol. made top 10, miss rsvp 5 minutes next person got spot. small ceremony like justice peace blows rager. talked  even said

I see went Donald J Trump school rhetoric: ""people say"", ""lots folks tell that"" on.

Either post studies, get lot people get either don’t insurance pay test, don’t money pay get rejected cause don’t certain symptoms

So tired dumbass Americans completely ignore fact countries Earth.

Yeah, get tested free cheaply (or all) developed countries. still millions cases. 

So hypothesis wrong. people get deposits back reservations cancel whole thing?

Nope, often not.

Even worse, venues charging reschedule - I've heard many tales venues demanding extra 50% push date Inevitable looking figures spain, france etc past days. hard imagine 5k soon, like Spain france 

 People holidaying en masse areas, many rushed back *specifically* bypass mandatory quarantine. 

plus students already migrating uni campuses large numbers w come, schools opening. 

Though testing capacity, actual testing vol improved localized testing increasing, explains heightened numbers somewhat, still invariable rise.

Most interesting thing meantime pre winter rapid saliva/nanopore tests IMO, (these could detect flu also) hope mortality stays ~20 / day coming weeks barometer Literally impossible convince type people responsible tho venue wants someone else (and another payment) date 8 months now. rarely watch Fox News unless choice like people learn 

What take? also think it’s possible wedding somewhat safely. 

* require masks times, aside dinner
* host entire event outside
* socially distance tables, seat people similar risk profiles together 
* you’re it, smaller tables (5-6 people table normally seats 8 10)
* smaller guest list (&lt;50)
* hugging, handshaking, dancing people outside household (also means get rid receiving line)

We hear weddings make headlines spreading COVID, LOT happening. ones don’t hear ones taking precautions. Owner UK wedding venue here, agree more. still Covid safe weddings 30 attendees (including couple, celebrants, photographers etc staff). last thing would want wind national news super spreader. thing people put allot money wedding cannot take back It’s crazy keep tell family GF COVID isn’t over. talk “resurgence” it’s time high every week. Even got Covid, laughing really killed him. poor bride family 
Widowed 2 days known since May, there's hundreds reports people catching twice, worse second time. damage go away test negative first thing second time get damage organs gets worse.

People think negative symptoms means damage 100%healthy. also think immune forever protected 3 months. COVID, /u/cdkcurtis laughed death. get you’re saying agree you, everyone know working service industry got laid off.

This thread acting like companies service industry still paying employees goodness heart oh won’t someone please think poor business owners.

Since you’re defending business refusing let people reschedule, let ask question: extension think airlines refuse rebooking COVID? different this? good news, I'll check later see trend continues
RemindMe! 10 years 10 days That's guests fault. adults, know could happen... Yet still went even hand? It’s far I’d expect body coming side. weird. Anyway, actual article.... 😆 every sane person's definition rare

And many get doctorates STEM fields tendency develop insufferably arrogant streak. every Joe Sixpack think know much experts, somehow qualified draw conclusions, despite actually engaging *actual* research. rare, incredibly so, stating make one denialist. simply stating fact.  Hah sure people also problems protest riots.. cuz damaging spreads virus. son getting married Atlanta October. reatrictions GA stated people must distanced. Son asked masks ceremony photos.  times ok them.  


Brides family deep south red hatters.  Son thinks greatest best ideas.  Im fucked. no, cannot go. 


I dont understand selfishness. already live together. Wtf big deal pushing next year?  refuses ask venue move next year. Try contacting District Supervisor (or whatever non-California equivalent is) perhaps? may able help negotiate? mean. government things every get anarchy, someone else's family know, that’s I’m right now. ""he old overweight anyway"" I’m actually dying laughing.

Are sure Covid? 25% giving Covid *your spouse* live share bed with. guaranteed transmit thing. think people way overestimate easy thing transmits doesnt. Like .. R 5 (super super high!) means walked life school home work course 3 4 infectious days, would pass 5 people. Oof also feel th government policy ""Do feel best sort amongst yourselves"" highly effective method control. find survey studies convincing 

Again personal incredulity doesnt matter correlation isn’t based prove anything shows correlations based participates answers

Really?

You didn’t read part Overall, lack total corona spread reported states could explained literally dozens factors.

Sure that’s part quoted since don’t misrepresent studies.

It could kind people protest also take government health mandates seriously. study mentions increased mask use think study nearly convincing think is.

Again, personal incredulity cult ignorance United States, always been. strain anti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means 'my ignorance good knowledge.
Issac Asimov Lots venues 'open' well refusing let couples move date without losing deposits. Wrong accounts lol poor. can’t afford stand mixer *for myself* hell expect get one *you Bethany?!* Idahoan. confirm. bruh, miss part live Texas? I'm already surrounded American COVID fuck upvotes drivel ?

I guess idiots kept downvoting pointing real CFR months ago.

What morons unaware many viruses/diseases plagued humans CENTURIES vaccines created ?

* smallpox
* polio
* syphilis
* measles
* typhus
* cholera
* bubonic plague

Sure, deadly (bubonic plague) would burn out, they'd come back later. 

Then ones still around, like **malaria**, still kills hundreds thousands year. 

Just never experienced emergence new virus/disease, people think can't happen. 

Except, saw decades ago HIV. 

It's still around, still killing people. Yes, treatments improved tremendously, still cure AFAIK.

And viruses today vaccines/cures. never said acceptable cheer deaths others said maddening see aforementioned behavior everyday lives. 

And mentioned essentially putting words people's mouths (based interactions threads subs). 

YOU seemed one trying justify death-misery cheering simple act commenters posted *other* threads. Though mocking means intent nonetheless. dare save lives locking everyone....oh wait..... This

All expenses Diagnosis test instruments aperatus. bad Date site updated. website says 2018 website long.
I imagine, might happened cause shit ton financial aid covid, companies declared test instruments later used covid, get public money.
HOWEVER proven fact. Please treat like true evidence that, that's reason. Move outdoors? I've taken look lockdown imposed Victoria. laws sound hellish. Good luck. work college I’m waiting get laid off. Small private school, testing students staff, nothing stopping going partying. School knew needed let people back person classes survive, get hit we’re done. depends think Covid-19 worse lockdown Victoria. Sounds hellish right now. really hope website clarifies things soon metastasizes misinformation gather, fundamentalist Baptists typically lot internal external pressure young couples marry asap. knows. 

I certainly want bride whose wedding killed numerous people. We're neck woods. And, we're declared ""hot spot"".    

What say practice saying ""moo"" we're herd immunity approach. huntington beach code (902780) changed specifically refer COVID-19 testing apparatus rather generic apparatus reason. search number along ""diagnostic"" find multiple websites generic definition. Ah here, go bed awful dope. Yeah similar credible redditors said posted earlier usually paper security features past fraud fake death certificates. order certain amount according expected deaths, right we're undershooting this. Ah here, go bed awful dope. seen pictures protests? Definitely weren’t spaced 6ft apart. Mexico tendency running away bad American habits. 😔 May ask comment COVID-19? Yeah, I'm learning Spanish watch popular Mexican Youtubers many visiting many places interacting lots people order create content channels.

I understand livelihood they're tough situation millions people around world. Yes, lot potential! humans mess usual. *I’m frustrated* cheer death wish suffering others.

When *you* criticize point hypocrisy, you’re bad guy.

-Your justification morally indefensible behavior coming sub.

It’s simple moral question: group genuinely cheering death misery? it’s me. “Test instruments apparatus (902780)”

902780 kind standardized coding basic test apparatus.

Someone probably made data entry change retroactively changed cosmetic description include COVID19. Oh god, idiot contagious see one point expecting someone post pooping describe outcome. point it’s probably preferable batshit crazy political stuff see. Shit either way. Well fair New Zealand authoritarian superpower massacres citizens dissenting opinions, breaking international agreements order annex surrounding countries whilst suiciding protestors... I’d say country set powerful world displaying utter fear-induced control everyone ever expanding borders allowed least little bit concerning. even get 3-6%? From, multiple experts said worse case scenario 1 1.5% 0.6. Mexicans really stubborn ass fuck prideful . know , cause I’m Mexican. mentality “no pasa nada “ words “ nothing happens” . way true. article extremely biased. Maybe it’s typo, read still couldn’t give satisfactory answer. questions.  read recently Mexican border closed 

*looks illegal aliens* sub? :P works me, sorry. event even allowed go all? really gave shit would send everyone home “Cheering death makes disgusting person. Look disgusting use exact rhetoric targeted different group.”

“You’re problem world.”

No, people like *you* problem world. know everyone says ""FLU GONNA BAD YEAR""

We're wearing masks, washing hands, social distancing. Tell greatly inhibit flu??? time ineffective vaccine fixed booster shots. Logically, nightmare would vaccine good, also prevented booster shots vaccines working. That's courts decide matters like this. opinion whether students entitled refund, would require reading university policies, rules, regulations, specified remedies.     
 timing might matter, rule announced payment tuition accepted.   
Lots stuff lawyer. dismiss enough students, might worthwhile bring class action suit. see fb useful businesses community events, grown something much complicated invasive that. 

So think better yeah, fuck Zuckerberg. doesn’t help China opened wet markets 

But open viral weapons labs again, like was, Wuhan? first world privilege still feels sad? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Producing vaccines one step. Producing enough vaccines vacccinating enough people bring covid control potentially even undertaking. research Spanish flu influenza direct descendant it. mutated year less deadly. Centuries real also maybe concern. link work either :/ 1. without vaccine; please learn read
2. 1918 flu still here, still killing people; virus stays around, might still kill people 100 years now
3. malaria, genius; malaria kills millions; virus, disease around long time, still problem; far know, might started like virus

So perhaps try think calling others dumb without realizing irony. missing here? 

m0ar wall, that's missing, better protect mexican covid Ignore him, doesn’t even know difference IFR CFR, wonder he’s accusing ridiculous arguments. sober person party, compare. much, much worse. I'm one Born SD there's nothing field. protestors wear masks try reading article. Eh, would argue based day-to-day interactions. absolutely see shitty behavior many hear speak every single damn day. There's strong arrogance attempt getting basic precautions. us, that's maddening part. 

I can't speak incredibly illl nations people know they're structured level development U.S. (though lot could based development region here). 

And way fly moon hyperbolic comment 'the lowest hypocritical scum earth"". comes infantile weakens view. Plain simple. government pay stay closed go bankrupt. shot dark, maybe refer re-agents reactive chemicals form basis wide spectrum tests.

WORLD CHINAIN CHINA’S XINJIANG, FORCED MEDICATION ACCOMPANIES CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN

In China’s Xinjiang, Forced Medication Accompanies Coronavirus Lockdown

This August 2020, photo provided Uighur quarantine shows bottle unidentified traditional Chinese medicine Urumqi, China. parts Xinjiang region China's far northwest enters 45th day second grueling lockdown due coronavirus outbreak, government police arrested middle-aged Uighur woman height China’s coronavirus outbreak, crammed cell dozens women detention said, forced drink medicine made feel weak nauseous, guards watching gulped. others also strip naked week cover faces guards hosed cells disinfectant “like firemen,” scalding,” recounted woman phone Xinjiang, declining named fear retribution. “My hands ruined, skin peeling.”

None actually helps instead inflicts extreme suffering. one thing reasoning: deaths real. People dying usual rate, much we're running death certificates. Whether count coronavirus not, people dying years. one thing can't fake manipulate: deaths there. I'm big enthusiast outdoor bans, especially breeze wind. outdoor events, wind speed matters. he's like many others: optimistic reason whatsoever. 

He proof, saying makes feel better. argue baseless facts least know difference CFR IFR 100% BS. Yet Moderna paused trial week refuse pay minorities test subjects vaccine

For some, reading hard. 

I even put bold, ... yeah. closed flights. Guess what. I'm going go work mouth wide open, breathing white man's air. I'm going lick every surface come across. IFR 10%?! insane? first post pure fear mongering one even worse, stop scaring people baseless facts, you’re expert certainly don’t know better scientists scientific articles repeat put IFR 0.5% 1.3% getting 3-6% from? peer reviewed epidemiological studies place fatality rate 0.3%-0.8%, I’m aware single reputable source places higher 1%. CDC currently estimates fatality rate 0.65%.  agree losing 36k party overkill. particular hope students' families sue. They'll probably get settlement. would hope getting booted college would sentence enough, knows. days seem like common sense common. thinking think fucking moron guess teach exponential growth America. lot tame expected compared last time similar post! means real CFR developed countries 10%. 

And look excess mortality use calculate CFR instead official corona deaths, get 8-12% developed countries. It'll useless US, they'll end censoring covid data like maps US slowed stopped testing, what's point.

Morally bankrupt. goes continue supporting bradykinin hypothesis. medical professionals using framework treatment yet not? Weatherunderground.com this. Look box right normally choose layers opacity radar maps. overlays heatmap county. definitely possible. I've read diagnosis thru exclusion. I'll check out, run whatever tests may need do. like say,we definitely dont. 

The scientific community determined benefit greater 50%, approved. I'm even sure measuring benefits, trust sources govt. right? Reducing spread flattening curve, point stay like forseeable future lockdown would work months best. sir, reason America mess. look upon ilk, feel desperately sorry decent citizens burdened like. Border Indiana Illinois right i70 us40. toast. Someone using 'evidence plandemic' online, I'm sure logical explanation figures actually like though, can't figure out. There's fuck ton Californians Oregon right now. Fuck article fuck Californians free poor enough the.... horrible. say America bad job... shows us Americans much take living country granted. Though shitty president acts/treats people, *not* compare here. Countries locked froze pandemic time countries, literally months behind Sweden. Paywall, idea might article pay wall. posted Let's send everyone believing herd immunity Mexico.. free trip, survive happened flatten curve? even start indefinite lockdown gain complete control nature narrative know what? might, get another PhD, time debating stupid redditors internet.. people sent check nursing homes covid, covid positive themselves? Really? plain incompetence. That’s Southern California. NorCal wet cold November-May. read article? Fk china Prayers faith, strength &amp; healing Dad &amp; &amp; family~ 🙏 ✨✨ Oh boy hurt someone’s ego? Gosh sure hope didn’t major something useless physics OP thought I'd check in. brother got married 2 weeks ago. Maybe 100 people looks many masks. wife go even though felt obligated.

I kind felt bad. grandparents tried guilt trip texting photos saying missed me. Still talked parents I'm sure disappointed. I'm feeling better every day though, probably stop feeling guilty.

So yeah far nothing really happened going denying ""obligation.""   Right even vulnerable/health care/high risk vaccinated would enough effectively end pandemic. good portion people outside demographic catch virus even notice it. good reason think emergency use vaccinations would dramatically plummet percent positives. numbers bank mitigate public. see real reason take place early 2021 early rollout. Phase three promising expected vaccines end November. there's lots us too. That's really unfair seems like news stopped showcasing it, instead showing lot heartwarming stories. ""Jesus protect us"" like hearing friend mine say ""If God want get pregnant, won't"" unprotected sex fiance. That's works!

You're good, sensible person thinking others. There's also risk chronic illnesses medical issues contracting recovering Covid. know guys, want hostile lung rest life. agree. Tradition trying offend people already died many years ago. You’re mean one, Mr Grinch...  Probably fact germany hit lot less hard italy played role.

But general 40k seem like big number 80 millions population like germany 40k 0.05%. selfishness allowing taxes pay expense. communal good communal expense. Expecting worst protect others pocket work, expecting anything different foolish best. Yeah well mean shadow could kill I'd probably scared lol. clearly good one. much misinformation don’t think anyone knows believe anymore

Listen scientists would also say sort first rodeo significant time/social/health/economic/political pressure get vaccine fast.

Scientists known quite risk adverse whole medical framework risk adverse ethical. 

A dangerous vaccine would cause trouble virus, would ineffective one. 

Also worth noting difference political bluster reality.

Trump may brag vaccine ready November, reality go Scientists confident. Prepare Trumps announcements followed weird ""logistical issues"" mean start rolling till January, whenever countries vaccine programmes start. Ah, missed word ""just"", bad. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Humans social creatures. Even redditors. say “rushed” I’m referring lot things make vaccine take 4 years lifted Covid vaccine. didn’t understand another redditor made clear, “rush” absolutely nothing scientific process creating testing vaccine. It’s legalities type stuff it’ll rushed through, testing trials. 

I misunderstood whole time, feared vaccine rushed testing trials could result negative side effects. wrong. 

You’re reading process ended unconfused. Sorry confused confusion. family talking shit mother attending one family gatherings. Seriously? mom high risk course she’s going place full people, even it’s family. extra careful get it, mostly likely I’m gonna give her. Yes, it’s rude invite people expect/want actually attend. idea you’re supposed invite people would give enough shit want give gift regardless. really, go ahead think anyway. Would correlate sent super fat super old people already cancer smoked entire lives WW2 Please run president. immunity?

dude never plan herd immunity. u live sweden, please spread bullshits thanks.  really sure asking. states rising mean cases going up. That's bad math. Deaths ticking France

And barely upticking spain

Granted, I’m sure get worse Yes...? spent two posts talking it. wedding scheduled December 2020, we’ve rescheduled December 2021. ""Senegal's quiet COVID success"" makes seem like Senegal choice matter. 

A accurate headline would ""The amazing story Senegal that's blatantly ignored past 6 months racist Western media along Mongolia, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, Kerala, Rwanda, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Fiji dozens amazing countries favor excessively jerking New Zealand Taiwan. One, me, plus four chronic health issues way life threatening, something required attention. 

People health issues disposable. 260 cases 400k people. idea article trying imply! Ah yes, dick getting hard means others must getting soft. feeding means others starving I'm eating. Smart logic. Swear family bible right someone close dies covid come apologize totally correct! 

It would sad looked wedding pictures future said, ""Look, there's wonderful Grandpa. died Covid shortly afterward."" 260 cases 400k attendants ... cases started emerge? Seriously? Influenza clearly worse, [by factor recently, Dr. Fauci cited 1 percent estimate, emphasizing 10 times death rate seasonal flu.


It definitely affect weak.
[55% persons experience neurological symptoms months quality rest arguments equally dubious best. someone(s) dying narcissism. Already wedding linked 2 deaths. Yes. Actually yes hope forgot /s comments. argument ""Don't like X, Y"" always ridiculous. ""Don't like country in? Move"" along line. like trying make things better allowed. Ah yes, country law allowed rape children, move. try change fix laws, move. 


And right, world revolve around them, you. think that's point saying. community social distancing select following those, maybe logic, people go somewhere else? Maybe move? 

And ""You deserve it""? fuck even mean? Deserve what? Someone wearing mask asking others social distance deserves people around mask social distancing? civil following guidelines, deserve opposite done? Handy  endured centuries colonization French stripped resources labor, well centuries slave trade. shut up. *the worst rush pandemic far need vaccine fly BLM flags? even locked. Nice, maybe adopted Swedish model non-paywalled full husband wedding May thick COVID Texas. opted reschedule, cull 200 person guest list mere 13 close family pastor. still hope large celebration one year anniversary, we'll see goes.
[Edit] went Facebook Live ceremony join us. risk reduction risk elimination. Stop getting together family! Sit home scared! Eat bugs! Back day, [people protested lock-down guidelines.

People selfish ignorant new thing. Redditor 21 whole hours far! Already edgy fierce! much Putin paying trolls year? Whats that? Sorry dont cash me. Good luck tho bro! Y’all treating little virus like bubonic plague smh. many immediate family members died Cov19 didn’t already health complications. work? expecting child back less couple weeks? aren’t going defeat it?! good example oxford vaccine, developed MERS different coronavirus, give MERS burnt funding dried vaccine finalised.

That basis tested vaccine Covid vaccine. 

One reasons vaccine develop takes years need prove works. need volunteers virus active circulation. COVID. 275 guests 56 confirmed cases? like 150 acute cases too. Shit hard detect. virus easy killer. family quarantined fully two weeks could go visit cousins grandparents another state first time year. Maybe people like family :-) Add new jersey list,we 0.84,in week 2. Numbers definitely going holiday weekend people Jersey shore bars,dining opened school. checked Taiwan. According Worldometers, currently 12 active cases know of. It’s lot, far eradicated. awful heartbreaking learn, need most, people love respect deserve neither love respect willing let others die. 

This pandemic redefine friend family circles also measure fellow man.

I wish best may come shit unharmed. compared 47 falling before? I’m sure get divorced anyways Host 'prepper parties':

Family only, like thanksgiving. 

Preppers problem, maintaining years supply food, go bad. cycle stock? Take turns cooking huge batches feeding close friends. go look healthy individuals thirties died this. I’m sure know two counter points:
1) much misinformation don’t think anyone knows believe anymore.
2) would also say sort first rodeo significant time/social/health/economic/political pressure get vaccine fast. miss fact many major media outlets USA ENCOURAGED BLM protests? article, like reporting, propaganda political gain. Conservative events questioning lockdown March made seem insane irresponsible, told tattle anyone going outside, people Australia living draconian laws currently still, yet meanwhile went encourage massive protests? Ha! Hysterically point. two days hear news: ""Senegal poorly handling COVID-19"" understand weddings resuming. Back April finished planning wedding September, idea going happen would actually better fiance want risk (also family members fly abroad) wedding postponed next year. 
Fuck people care. 'letting people die' stories came differences ICU care long covid. home country often put people ICU matter what. Sweden society prefers Swiss approach let people die calm, quiet way. I'm sure times doctors made wrong call believe systematic. different UK/US norms. 

Thank this! makes much sense giving impression refusing take elderly people hospital, give oxygen, use ventilators. Whats statistic then? people actually get vaccine. conversations went people life surrounding it? me, majority people talk say feel comfortable getting rushed know long term effects. think protesters sneezing contests.  Yet Sweden never locked down, better France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Italy....

In fact, barely deaths now. over.

Part population density. 

The whole mask shut everything scientific economic disaster. true. fuck old ppl anyway, cant wait go cheap honeymoon trip Here, dude. much think COVID super scary....

tbh cancer worse.... kills people

But please. Let’s focus getting pandemic with. Also, it’s political person’s fault expect state governors, it’s also stupid fucks like Jake Paul throwing COVID party come baseless assumption

Do think cardiac involvement children infected SARS-CoV-2 baseless? first rodeo. talking teams decades experience using well established protocols.

I know COVID, people seem act like first time seen virus first vaccine ever. 

Must pretty insulting dedicated lives line research Yep. I’m trying gtfo US. I’m empathetic it’s severely affecting mental health. Kinda negates OP BLM protests Australia also showed COVID-19 BLM protests Australia also showed COVID-19 Loss life loss life.

I agree, loss life loss life, funny yet mention unemployment rises death rises exponentially .. Funny care loss life reported woke enough virtue would explain excess death huh, cure worst disease, 6%.  Many venues make pay small deposit advance Cool. Thanks explanations. live city pastor caused based in. We've handful cases mostly confined senior homes throughout entire pandemic. actual outbreak. made far cases jerk thinks knows better scientists putting us risk.  Obama left playbook discarded? Executive branch seems plenty power suits agenda. Also, Executive isn’t branch. Congress could’ve done hell lot more, opposing majorities rendered Legislative branch practically worthless can’t agree anything. Yeah see now, page looking lot vague needed be.  mean site mostly proves pointless anything cause fucked anyways agree so...yeah cool. fit rowboat? Weren’t hospitals “full” taking patients? must impact. Trump's election material (banners, flags, etc.) made China. worry, NBA helped develop cheap 24 hour saliva test.  Exactly! really can’t stand hate peaceful protesters got. virus isn’t threat safety. highest number infections single day: 1,217 positives, community isolated, 2,263 samples 50 percent test-positivity rate Saw Mexico came foaming mouth India also largest death number Spanish flu. Trump could made masks bipartisan “American” thing, course didn’t. Trump bears responsibility way people behaving now. Fellow Hoosier here! majority people see public wear masks adhere social distancing protocols, appears commercial businesses entertainment venues open normal. Still seeing large number people closed spaces, im guessing everyone advent followers guidelines. potential transmission - see happening. herd immunity shit rediculous. students took seat could gone someone else, right pay punishment contractual matter. people participating wore masks, plus outside. Could added positive case numbers? Sure. number significant? Probably not. Seriously walk away without even temporary ban? Horseshit. Don’t put words mouth. desire catch COVID again. 

But you’re willing permanently give freedoms temporary security, shame you. feel free move China live authoritarian government that’s life want yourself, want children grow up.

I’m highly critical gov’t, there’s lot improve on. country I’d rather live in. work healthcare America antibody test free me. headline actually true exactly worried about. were/are thousands people congregating streets. It’s good thing multi-billion dollar companies always uphold pledges /s perfectly healthy people who've pretty bad organ damage. Yeah outside limits spread. know Yeah too. Philippines population 110 million people see cases pop frequently countries could sign case count around 3000 day underestimated. 

But looked back last several great posts included 0, 1, 2 cases Philippines it’s certainly possible either fluke cases related infected other.  Sorry. Several ones adoption scams. local news featured story re-homing pets “whose owners died COVID” scammers, course, disappeared adoption fee paid. 

Adopt, don’t shop - adopting doesn’t prevent scamming. think also treatment getting effective well. erased. Inner Mongolia stronger grasp Mongolian outer Mongolia Oh okay makes cool put camps. Thanks clearing up! seriously comparing software update vaccine? remember saying addition everyone else saying, big push ""not scared hugging loved ones anyway"" certainly help. also saw another video lots tourists we're going Mexico without masks wanted avoid lockdowns countries. I'm sure help. even were... use mask help even countries worked. beginning dismissed danger another flu saying president immune high moral. according article, states victims “paying” fake “breeders” “purebred” puppies. wouldn’t paying breeder adopting rescue. Here's TIL you: Uyghurs even biggest Muslim minority China. countries thought beat too. Time tell. even checked amount tests done, looks like province Ontario, Canada daily tests. makes sense, they’re simply testing enough people. We’re close midway this. recklessness people No, like every post sub. Gotta keep consistent, we’d bunch glaring hypocrites.

“Mexico deserved leadership sucked.”

“The people Mexico sure fucking morons, right? Hahaha. Fuck people.” feels like 30/30/30 rule.

30% people willfully ignorant, full fear hate.

30% good people, willing see world new perspectives.

And last 30% want entertained. show popcorn. recommend growing backbone sad-sack loser give pretend normal everybody give up. bad consequences covid yet there's people still wear mask right dumbest reasons. sharpest left turn you’ve ever met. *are* adoption scams. I’ve seen huge numbers posts already trying make conspiracy getting ready start distributing vaccine November, that’s timeline they’ve hoping since May/June. even mentioned October possibility one point. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* also makes lot sense. could testing people hospitalized close death. Worst case: eat marshmallow 5 minutes later. Best case scenario: eat 2 marshmallows 5 minutes later.

Always better wait. Lose lose here. get refunded really kids.

But penality getting kicked getting money back that's real penality.

All reason opened TIL need actual “Certificate” can’t use regular paper.

Also sounds like bad situation, hold 🇲🇽. think Trump mask initially, situation bad. CDC suggested people wear mask.  Grow need USA flair, already knew. Ublock Origin option disable JavaScript would uncomfortable, there's nothing anyway. Personal attacks name-calling make look smarter people sub, angry cynical. Mexico really seems gone radar far (possibly people busy giving ""table slapping laughter"" awards threads saying 410,000 Americans die), situation seems absolutely ridiculous see.

They're reporting 67k coronavirus deaths far, believe second. 1.4 million tests (most comparable nations done tens millions) nearly half come back positive. That's bad (maybe worse than?) situation Western Europe *March*. combine lack testing overwhelmed healthcare system government known corruption, got recipe massive undercounting infections, deaths too.

I surprised Mexico ends excess deaths US (total numbers, per capita) dust finally settles we're able add numbers. Possibly worst world per capita basis, although Peru Ecuador might beat (IIRC, someone (either NYT WSJ) worked Ecuador's excess deaths many times higher official covid deaths).

It seems bitterly ironic one country's famous exports Corona beer. Haha, America punchline 🤪 Europe's hot though. Greatest country world keep hearing. came possession St. Bernard / Australian Shepard would swear someone paid top dollar glamorous vagrant ny times article 150k Covid deaths put use 200k extra deaths year. 33% worse what's reported line data. 240k today. don’t see benefits trump okay People get infected mild symptoms get tested. Comment deleted - give us jist said? cannot find Covid Airport /Air Travel statistics

My grandmother-in-law well might travel across country . would 2 adults baby traveling. super scared. hermit since quarantine began leave house throw trash. trying find statistics many people gotten sick airports/planes. cannot find damn thing. would considered at-risk person well. anyone help find data? Thank confuse good world good personally. 


About 6,000,000 people died starvation year! closure borders less spending humanitarian aid, due lockdowns, threatening push millions starvation one many humanitarian disaster wake lockdown, usual poorer nations get bad deal. Lockdown saving many lives *world* possible.

When would surprised lives lost due lockdown order magnitude higher life lost COVID. getting better time? recovering? really speaks volumes damaging societally-counterproductive ""rugged individualism"" people keep travelling parties Locked. Advocating violence saying someone deserved strictly site-wide [content policy](/help/contentpolicy) [our rule 1](/r/Coronavirus/wiki/rules). support getting flu shot, feel gonna pretty hard catch flu year, especially working remotely. Dr. Muerte? kept telling everyone stay home one listened. pretty brutal accusation accompanied sources examples kind. think need back examples, stop saying it. said something similar boss mine one time, many coworkers angry talking another coworker. 


It's easy talk crap people, easy say felt personally slighted. Almost obligation stand yourself. 


Saying good things someone easy, think obvious need said. people stay quite. 


That employee got railroaded, I. got jobs bit respect us eventually, life went on. easy thing though. Aka lower muh taxes! oh feel bad poor. sad. care muslims China, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya Palestine. particular, care atrocities government live directly responsible feel entitled kind moral high ground it. There's quite reasons require essential. fact family want visit quite literally essential.

That page specific travel restrictions page saw however, curious disparity. OMG!!!! That's .00013 % population 6.048 millio n. Let's panic! concede government knows outbreaks. CCP big history hiding information pandemics. doctors tried bring Wuhan/CCP virus open suppressed government got big contain. yes, firewall communist put behind close rest world. Foreigners China surprised happened world leave. information get highly filtered. accurate assumption make; general consensus virus ravages obese overweight (particularly uncontrolled type 2), Mexico surpassed US regard nearly age groups.

Additionally, US health system nothing boast about, it’s still substantially ahead Mexico’s terms medical equipment general infrastructure. First first wave testing start, estimations going high registered cases times 30 actual cases.

Secondly, age group differences infections.

Thirdly, it’s summer makes difference getting fresh air vit-D.

Four: better treatment available get people worst part without causing cytokine storm. probably herpes lungs. “People tend breathe mouth instead nose wearing mask,” says Sclafani. “The mouth breathing causing dry mouth, leads decrease saliva — saliva fights bacteria cleanses teeth.”

So breathe nose. spray something mouth. suck hard candy. trivial, solvable problem good excuse wearing mask. Twins Basil US terribly health crisis!

Yeah, take account we’re morbidly obese!

Good point! We’re bad, that’s good! Cautiously optimistic. count tourists compliant. much Freedumb Units? care all? They've spent lot money astroturfing social media, especially Reddit. gone ""vaccines safe"" ""Big Pharma wrong."" say people west spoiled, however china face masks normacy, visit countries, sometimes see groups wearing facemasks (pre pandemic) thats lot citizens wear due air quality concerns.

With pandemic place I'm shocked took easily.

That said people really go berzerk small piece cloth america. Whoa... Removeddit friend. Otherwise I'd missed get new bicycle insults weird. My, turntables. know got down-voted. Probably teenagers took offense. quite right, serious problem. virus may may airborne, think is. spreads cruise ships whole floors office buildings. 

I know kind filter put vent would catch virus-sized particles without interrupting airflow. Maybe ask hardware store google it. 

Winter coming, situation going repeated many buildings, worried going get bad. original study family affluence effect. Controlling family income, there's correlation. Speculation layman, first thing comes mind idea true case numbers are, people severe cases counted leading high death rate. Could also poor diet medical care. Deaths trailing indicator. happening terms cases hospitalizations indication deaths 3 weeks. Everything declining moment. currently 33k hospitalizations, 60k peak mid July. sure schools effect this, everything seems declining moment.     ""despite never pandemic similar vein illness lasting years, without medical concluded last year's reasons"" virus far saying decades fear mongering tbh. Everyone thinks ""normal"" dumb. black death worst pandemic human history lasted like 5 years time came about. effectively medical apparatus speak of. if? someone who’s still pretty freaked virus, would 100% take getting societal collapse. insane. certain point need get things come several thousand steps end civilization, good lord. It’s serious it’s fucking serious.  You’re one 1% people sub whose deranged emotionally-driven panic makes sub hellhole I’m sure data - sure much tracing done people flying tested positive. I’m high risk category traveled half way across country direct flights. one flight entire row middle seat empty. wore mask, distanced airports washed hands frequently. went restaurants shopped several times traveled help friend move new place. 

We can’t eliminate risk entirely however traveling wasn’t scary. BLM dumb movement. Good thing mortality rate fraction percent population Joe Biden directly encouraging protests (even violent ones)?

No, Biden literally said violence ok. I'm sure troll ignorant moron. It’s patient specific ... that’s scary covid patient specific . 70 year old smoker 49 years ... fine tested positive ... fever two days ... that’s .... coded lost 26 year old athlete... never smoked drank anything. top patients seem die ... oldest ones dying ... least week lose patient shouldn’t lost New York one. really viable vast majority schools virtual classes much easier point. trump paid vote stimulus check It’s perfect storm Mexicans. High obesity rates. Skepticism experts. “no pasa nada wey” attitude. Incompetence government US Mexico. Multi-generational households. Lastly, people like hangout, celebrate drink even one year old’s party. usually makes us report high levels happiness gives us longer life spans groups wealthier us. Problem is, hanging family deadly pandemic. Hiding attic like Anne Frank would excessive since isn’t Holocaust, lunatic. say? Gotcha. guess way improve testing capacity set processing centers somehow make current ones efficient. Hopefully one two occurs. guarantee sane buff vote mail get downvoted saying that, *not* wrong. (And yes, kiddos, also think Trump's reprehensible jackass.) fact ""fact-checking"" done self-reported study (cf. *The Guardian)* actual PCR testing. statement protests somehow contribute spread like saying Clorox injections good you. don’t want second marshmallow? way calibrate number? think they're reporting 50%, 90% 5%? Nobody counts deaths India even excess mortality table. AFAICT simply guess many deaths actually are. perfect world maybe. 

But winter coming, cold could rona, could cold. can’t tell. work winters constant colds.


Also can’t afford miss work unpaid waiting results. inner Mongolia completely blacked out, 10 million people 2 cities northern china covid lockdown, half south flooded right now? Mortality numbers help much, average age infection gone down. data Covid hospitalizations, may better readout. inner Mongolia completely blacked out, 10 million people 2 cities northern china covid lockdown, half south flooded right now?

Years? Maybe. Decades? No. Centuries? Absolutely not. plan obviously fails make sense continue it. Completely agree. Good thing protesters seem responsible type, that’s I’m surprised case increases aren’t tied them. makes sense. monotonic rise entire economy, rather sectors (today: tech) booming like madman, whilst others (today: tourism? newspapers?), much. Pcp? way? every health insurance does? *confused* need consistent, say thing Mexico sub endlessly parrots posts US cases:

Mexicans fucking morons!

Man, fuck country!

Mexico full incompetent shitheads!

I get test Malaysia $10, can’t Mexico test people?

Vitamins don’t cure covid Sadly situatuon much worse even already-staggering numbers indicate. Mexico’s test positivity rate 50-60% past couple among absolute highest world. give three weeks actual CFB gameplay shit starts falling apart. No, take account fact many people use social media among things. Trump would say..... “of course death certificates you’ll death! Stop documenting them, deaths go way down! Simple!” lol It’s labs backed take get results.

I waited two weeks, said 2-5 days Going outside would otherwise gathering inside easily reduce case numbers. People always start assumption protests must caused positive change spread, logically that's true all. depends entirely protesters would days otherwise. top least .... since March .... least 5 people die ....

Repeat. motivated reasoning lol. guarantee less double counting cases reported all. Causes death reported decades, sure mistakes especially epidemics pandemics, vast majority data reliable. Well, normally reliable, ones controlling numbers get released run administration benefits reported numbers lower. Look China’s current admin. It’s absolutely appalling. I’d take USA day. friggin hate Trump’s admin. scares ... worked hall since March Large families, poor education (ranked last among 35 OECD countries), poverty, poor social services, dysfunctional government.

The U.S. investing central south America instead China last decades. neighbor directly affects you. Covid absolutely picks chooses ... may may get really sick ... think maybe genetic thing don’t know yet  bestfriend gonna get Married coming Tuesday. giving guest mask, sanitizers ready gonna practice social distancing. Cases don’t matter. Everyone eventually it. many deaths resulted weddings? Zero? That’s matters. Literally everyone catches varies disease throughout lives. different. mean yeah, moreso Russian vaccine whose cavalier testing protocols caused one highest-ranking medical officers step down.

If guys trust vaccine enough volunteer trial it, power em.

At least there's evidence China testing uyghurs Sure. necessarily. infections pretty much medical anecdotes point. high enough statistically relevant happening impressive rate means. Doctors concerned yet. whole thing crazy SARS makes sense SARS changes little big picture cares? still weird effects flu actually may mold related. 
Thankfully randomly happen already getting tested that. Also cancel friendship you’re it. Former teacher one kid secular private school (less 5k year), one public charter, one regular public school. absolutely agree. School come know US needs change big way. cannot continue way currently set up. 

Classes overcrowded, students undisciplined, parents absent teachers overworked pitiful amount money paid. Glad virus engineered know motorcycle rally protest. gift fishing. Get card says congrats . say masks effective miles away? say virus transmissible miles away? That's like saying ""I talked girl phone think got pregnant""

And ""American sources""... Uh... 2nd study linked UK. Besides, country origin data?

Nothing saying makes sense. best friend smart delayed everything July 2020 July 2021. Hopefully that's long enough. lol relax. sound like n*zi One homies since high school wedding said would lose 15k deposit go it. sucks either way thankfully want go begin lmao Saw Facebook Dad, Step-mom, two brothers sister attended wedding Minnesota weeks ago happy it. Clearly different views this. trilled 'R' sound spreads droplets intensely.

Not serious. Yeah, someone's going explain me.

As said friend recently, going safest flu season entire life. 

How hell supposed catch flu wear mask anytime I'm around people. wear eye protection face shield I'm anything quick in-and-out. hands never go near face get sanitized washed frequently. I'm going inside places necessary things...which sadly include exercise I'm outdoors Florida summer. hands get sanitized anytime leave place contaminate car. Anything bring house gets sanitized. 

Safest flu season ever me.

If getting flu shot everyone damned important, government pay them.

I'm wasting $40 flu shot. spend money gas groceries. supposed give gift even attend?  end summer. People going out. ""F- Covid"" mentality now, even amongst many anti-Trump folks know.

SAD! Go on.... keep thinking, myself, who'll care kids even get kind ill. Or, we're really ill hospitalized? They'd scared alone. That's exact advice wife give young couples even covid. Fancy weddings something non-rich people would never think without marketing anyway, good way blow savings go debt. 

Ours even expensive, still wish we'd spent money travel instead. plan. wife scheduled get married March 29th right everything shutting wedding venue cancelled honeymoon cancelled. Decided last minute wedding woods 6 people attendance streamed online. 

It definitely major disappointment, still plan party safe friends family gather again.  Lol one buys Yup. learnt epidemiology much psychology immunology virology. 

Lockdown fatigue real virus. 

Everyone different timeline risks deem acceptable. virus relies this. Church next door funeral yesterday.

Probably 100 people, single mask seen except pastor.

Then, afterward, formed single crowd, shoulder shoulder, laughing, roughhousing, waiting vehicles.

I heard fair amount coughing. one seemed care.

I wonder many funerals they'll planning weeks. But, muh long term effects!!! Eh surprised. I've heard lots stories medical professionals going partying pandemic. spent lots time school mean idiot. stop using sarcasm. world takes literally. would someone need prescription get tested covid first place? seems like unnecessary step first go doctor, get prescription get test. 

Isn't lot efficient make appointment get test quarantine home positive? find quite interesting honestly.  recall news different strains (mutations) went.  Makes wonder many strains made US. totally get that. said got math wrong. Good luck bro.

I still think everything online, except &lt;10 years old kids, it’s absolutely essential attend school parents too. government scare much Coronaviruses mutate slowly. one year speculated two strains. friend Senegale told people even believe corona's existence shskskdk Families First Coronavirus Response Act provides free covid testing america everyone, including uninsured. HHS sponsors lot community based testing sites doctor's referral, cases appointment, necessary: weigh whats valuable, money receive tuition negative publicity. Usually money wins gives shit got married days ago parents attendance I’m still nervous haven’t seen lockdown all. wore mask held breath hug mom - can’t imagine people living life like everything normal. city's council wantedly produce fake positives milk money government

Coming someone wedding that's considered cheap side, frugal side still spent wished. insist wedding, host parents' backyard living room. hold 6 people there, 6 people. One beautiful day worth risking financial stability couple. that's without Covid.

Sure thing people put quotes around “friend” aren’t usually talking lol Fuck man, too. March 9th here.

This final semester Uni. Thankfully, classes remote professors give shit us.

I’m fucking ready done everything, diving this? Depending state, might even need courthouse.

My wife got married friend mine best friend. One ordained minister witness.

Then dropped papers lunch family San Francisco dinner LA (this Feb 2, COVID closures general public awareness issue).

What great paid marriage license tipped friends money Super Bowl nachos.

&amp;nbsp;

If now, done lunch dinner everything else would stayed since meant 4 us interacting (and 2 careful wife are).

&amp;nbsp;

The reason suggest option state could imagine others thinking good idea go courthouse now, simply means people around. nearly bad wedding, standing line bank last week renewed faith humanity since everyone masked up, 6 feet apart, standing outside allowed in, maybe courthouse empty.

It also made special friend wed us. (Although everyone pretty pissy found invited. even families - understood) believe exactly? Using vaccine platforms well understood created moments like plug play. (Oxford) makes sense. nurse friend knows median age COVID deaths 75-80 years old. srsly?

China can't find patient zero, regarded patient zero connection market found cases way earlier last year November, US case may last year thing know now, first significant cluster appeared Wuhan, market definitely origin. That’s rumor. They’re paying minimum wage compliance person also stocking craft services cart paperwork BG sets. wonder Batman got covid.... Thank sharing this! Face book sucks would anyone give much power snot nose KID wondering sturgis cases would start issue. can't believe many people went, fatalistic comments interviewed.

It's shitshow normal year. Well acute poisoning three years pretty chronic. Way Back machine confirms record codes September 4th, 2020 - therefore fairly obvious material instrumentation previously traded categories given generic code related Covid-19. 

This probably trade dominates categories, however, historical trade data lead rather misleading interpretation, CT's jumping about. Redditor u/BetYeager points comment "" Someone probably made data entry change retroactively changed cosmetic description include COVID19"" clearly happened.

Sadly, correcting error make CT's jump even more.

Smart move imo. Seems like perfect time start marriage without spending ass ton money wedding. wife got married Courthouse commitment other. Suspended? Kick completely. They're supposedly adults ready act like one also ready college. People town held bridal shower back around June. Something crazy like 18 people got Covid. grandma dad groom ended ventilators MONTHS nearly died. got moved long-term care facility near woods people AUDACITY WEDDING!!!!!!!! couldn’t believe. Truly could not. point threw hands air realized fucked America is. definitely are. 2018 best friend’s step sister got married converted **catholicism** long awkward drawn ceremony

the reception lit though  Someone know got married yesterday. see one single mask social distancing pictures article foreign. assume English first language USA bad = instant upvotes course misspoke said epidemiologists, obviously many scientists folks sought science understood gravity situation. pretty much speak lay people, everyone way underestimates long going last. ""I hope Halloween/Christmas/some unrealistic date, we'll past this."" word hope gets tossed around lot. many died? one naive enough believe China never another local outbreak. changed since March though complete confidence new local outbreaks contained policy target always eradication. New normal necessary West policymakers judged eradication politically untenable instead sold us watered ""flattening curve"" policy. would reason live life normally local transmission 0 rather ""low"". 

Credit Western countries initially controlled spread quite well even success story like Germany daily cases China months. 🇺🇸 Asymptomatic carriers virus load high symptomatic carriers. CDC estimates 40% people infected Covid 19 symptoms likely key curing Covid also giving people Covid 19 get symptoms. people get sick long term affects Covid 19 die.

Also, US one highest mask wearing rate Western World. 10 times higher Sweden btw. sensible view point Catholic schools created indoctrinate. tradition Catholic education goes back centuries. Modern schools religion classes morality clauses things like annoying non religious tradition Catholic academics existed form long, long time. venue trying stay business 

You know small business who's GOP claiming saving hard times. hope big special day worth potentially losing lives friends family. can’t understand people would risk this. One wedding fifty funerals Bill Gates microchips speeding production  restaurant employees small business owners One wedding 50 funerals protestors wear masks. hard guys understand? Going beach tomorrow, it’s gonna lit They're arrogant enough think happen. say covid Short term side effects, short term word! I'm lucky, happen family

/s tough spot couples planning weddings. sister getting married month. fully agree you.. case basically tens thousands line. wedding venue paid full tried cancelling it. venue basically told kick rocks. allowed move back late September, venue said fully cancelled they'd lucky get back 10% pulled out. 

My sister 3 separate lawyers look contract basically told nothing could do. guests attending, forced follow pretty strict precautions. cancelling outright would cost pretty much everything. really tore up. 3 bedroom house 24x24 detached garage. girlfriend's ""friend"" calls ""Corona Fear"".

I say ""friend"" girlfriend basically fucked continually dick Covid making gf feel bad making safe choices. pleased told finally came blows it. one assholes subtly pushes people around gf putting for, literally, years. Yeah, people want spend ridiculous amount money teach child certain way, let them. Homeschooling exists parents could teach whatever hell wanted way.

Just long part public curriculum problem (and public curriculum issues, fair). wedding planned May 16th. got mid-April decided postpone months least see at. venue gave option postponing penalty, would lost thousands dollars canceled. moved date August. course August rolls around things bit better Upstate NY, still better enough hold event 100+ people. given option postpone 2021, lose lot money. It’s difficult decision easily see sides. work medical industry cautious things Covid. lose thousands dollars, year planning what’s supposed one important milestones life, future wife lose experience she’s dreaming since childhood really horrible choice make. 

Yes, postponing 2021 option venues, put shoes people. specific situation, we’ve together 5 years engaged year (which already much longer originally wanted). much want start family near future. We’re also early 30s isn’t old course, point probably shouldn’t put starting family long want one. Postponing 2021 feels like put *everything* hold another year. top that, one knows it’s even going better already limited dates available. It’s really tough pill swallow.

We ended postponing September next year, still went wedding August parents’ backyard immediate family. practiced social distancing wore masks gave everyone bottles hand sanitizer. still concerned even ~20 guests we’re immediate family, think good job keeping people comfortable safe. I’m glad didn’t try go wedding 125 people, understand it’s hard people. definitely idiots around think Covid hoax don’t care, lot couples rock hard place. ...a homily context Sunday's gospel reading talks gossip “When see brother sister make mistake defect,” said Pope Francis, “the first thing go tell others it. gossip.” “Please, brothers sisters, let us make effort gossip,” added Pope. “Chatter plague awful Covid!” Nobody cares anymore protests going area stuff closed anti-maskers. didn’t get approval, didn’t get shut either. Dude NFL discords like that

""Oh afraid Covid? hahaha""

YES DUDE scared dying absolutely die get it. Waiting option people, already paid everything, moving date (if even possible venue, caterers, photographer, etc.) would lose LOT money. ideal, lot couples getting married year, feasible option, long venue big enough space tables distance, everyone wears masks/follows rules, risk nonexistant. easier said done arent shoes getting married. deaths going meet relative last week, one coworkers contracted virus wedding. end going. That's funeral director wore mask kept distance. Mah funerals wait even weddings. What're gonna get leave? cross-sectional study 16 025 residual clinical specimens, estimates proportion persons detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ranged 1.0% San Francisco Bay area (collected April 23-27) 6.9% persons New York City (collected March 23-April 1). **Six 24 times infections estimated per site seroprevalence coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case report sites, ""**it likely greater 10 times SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred number reported COVID-19 cases**; persons site, however, likely detectable SARS-CoV-2 estimate 3.36 million (3.21, 3.51) people infected SARS-CoV-2 England end June 2020

At end June, UK 282,000 confirmed One million 482 thousand people encountered virus (2.5% entire population zero years upwards ).

As last date study, 7/15, Italy 244,000 confirmed April 27 May 11, 2020, seroprevalence entire country 5·0% (95% CI 4·7–5·4) point-of-care test

By 5/11, Spain 256,000 confirmed cases, versus 2.35 million estimated cases based seropositivity.

_______

So no, quite wrong, numerous seroprevalance studies point actual infection rate far higher confirmed infection rate. Big money foreign money talked us believing ""\[t\]he terrifying words English language are: I'm government I'm help."" actually really common lot places outright refusing work people all. come comment you’re replying locked? “It’s exactly like cooties” know someone who's venue would offer refund, stating could still event. Wasnt going offer money back. contract states venue holds 300. covid, restricted 150, found venue breach contract got refund. caterer offer refund, saying would still provide food. caterer make food donatef 300 meals homeless. Unfortunately, lot people get flu shot right middle cold flu season. Half catch damn cold office day get shot. difference disliking Chinese government disliking Chinese people girlfriend got married. almost 40
People, supposed 75. Everyone wore masks social distanced. took lot precautions. Like one wasn’t together sat table together. attend well many others. it’s 3 weeks covid. huge empty space probably perfect keeping everyone apart. know it’s def imagined boat. want lose thousands dollars.


And one traveled. people area. Congratulations! someone love dying it.

As almost everything else... It. Just. Isnt. Worth. It.

That course coming someone getting married, easy say isnt wedding. even so, apply little perspective easy decision. Words words words  lot rural areas terrible. People sick pandemic decided won’t wear mask, oblivious fact people act like longer virus pose significant health problem. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Glad got wanted didn’t need make sacrifices. Huh, realize worked way BC. rain parade, letting roll later unspecified date pretty reasonable compromise conditions. I'm tired everything. Limiting contact others. Social distancing. Wearing N95 masks. threw towel got cheap reusable mask. know half much N95, care anymore. actually breathe enough get mask mandate. Maybe ill second wind point, now, I'm hanging friends (in private) masks, everybody side side That’s fair, it’s quarantine sure. reserve term. absolute bottom, Vietnam... see them? Source shit ease up. scenario described happening coast cities frequent biz runs. Everyone like dicks wrapped invisible anti COVID condom. got first part right. comment deeply un-American. 

I lot resentment Catholic Church, know Americans freedom practice religion religion all. people want send kids school teaches kids Catholicism, it. right. indoor wedding. Says near top article. sounds pretty ideal. ruin asking park, maybe state? lol Honestly, start rolling young healthy first! College students etc...they least risk virus, also least risk harmful side effects, majority spreading. could makes sense sort work backwards EUA normally (distribute risk first).

This depends it’s sterilizing immunity Maybe have, put past them. 

That said, there's evidence I'm going make claim Oh lord. Thanks understand sentiment: one person's selfish actions huge consequences large gathering. However, knowing that, everyone attends said gathering also bears responsibility. *know* people could sick, that's limit gatherings small safe. 

It's like thinking, ""aww man, idiot went huge wedding spread COVID! jerk!""

 like ""these idiots went huge wedding *knowing* someone could spread COVID! bunch assholes!"" low IQ brain can't seem discern different variables situations risk based percentage random bad luck. couldn't, like others mentioned pain reschedule (and conveniently rates went next year would need pay difference according them). Luckily ceremony already outdoors venue able move reception outside well going much smaller version wedding would've (Masks required!!) meme always grandma grandpa literally twice likely die FL AZ got hit hard. Also, left leaning “areas” usually densely populated. virus doesn’t care politics. shitty so-to-speak wedding vendor abiding terms agreement

I get you’re coming from. But, abiding terms clients still holding event pandemic recourse given them, “per agreement.”

I’m saying every deposit given back 100% question. expecting weddings, etc., cancelled due pandemic, it’s call people ‘shitty.’ question. But, vendors offer compromise “per contracts” equally shitty alternative losing thousands tens thousands dollars, per contract, still hold event. goal shame events, much given selfish hosts guests uncompromising vendors. still 14 day quarantine arrival plus tested regularly quarantine Yea sucks man sorry hear it. like getting volcano insurance bc would turns neighbor volcano basement Ok. isn’t bit twisted? Shouldn’t listen best science adjust accordingly? Independent says?

This comment basically saying darned, study / article goes camp beliefs gives point “team”. 

That kind argumentation exactly science politicised rather politics scientified.

(Disclaimer record: don’t believe natural herd immunity strategies) work US test people free time, insured uninsured. People need stop going ER get tested.  got going in-person fantasy draft year. able stream in, responded I'm worried getting (because self-worth) worried passing on. Imagine selfish would that. people thread seem ignoring fact lot couples, fiancee included already everything paid cannot postpone it, would lose large amount money invested wedding. Everyone wearing masks, venue big enough rather small wedding ~50 people socially distanced reception. point we've moved beyond stupid fuckers selfish. You’re right, opened early basically every state wasn’t hit hard beginning died Hero Oops, meant write 50% less. BC also pay attend Catholic school you’re practicing Christian not. Epoch times, china uncensored, NTD news. good way?

Students healthy young bubble. Getting infected school insulated spreading disease families.

The main risk group teachers employees, practice social distancing protect masks, quickly build isolated immune herd university students...


Not asking ethical. interested concept protective bubbles, like nursing homes NBA Orlando. 

I explored concept isolated infectious bubbles... build herd immunity safer environment. could both. yeah look colleges treating students right now. Ah yeah, trivializing 70,000 deaths *tight*. Definitely reasonable wedding right now.  People care lockdown Argentina all. plenty anti-lockdown protests, clandestine parties, etc. happening every social stratum. Government sadly losing support day since people think they're nothing giving lazy people money exchange votes next elections (since many working places closed, social plans given away poor people, informal workers, etc).

But positive thing Argentina's lockdown relatively low mortality rate. plenty time organice health system flattening curve, think we're seeing good results now. effective vaccine released soon, Argentina's lockdown may saved thousand lives; otherwise we'll see peak goes. shut China 20 years ago wanted cheap underwater shmoozed Busch legacy China Love gain favorable trading status Game Over😱 better sure leave doubt assume, Usually people make mistakes apologize correct misunderstanding. Saying ""it's obvious read mind known meant say obviously"" makes look like ass.

Dude, question sincere. recognized made mistake point scoring. indeed fuck up, yes, many aspects critical thinking, ""experts"" make mistakes, ""experts"" may motives mislead you, ""experts"" may information form ""expert"" opinion.

 assume things might true experts. went read actual paper. give charge life, decide information presented you. Like old saying goes, everyone jumps cliff going jump too? Seems like answer would yes critical thinking limited accepting expert tells you.

accepting expert opinion going along peer group nice false equivalence.  strategy saving economy winning second term matter many lives cost limits it. testing every single person eradicating it, that's impossible. catch 90%+ infected people, limit spread lot. catch 40% them, there's point propaganda verifiably true. isn’t official death toll going up? going let excess deaths go uncounted Covid deaths? mean depends. many Americans, $2000 charge could sink especially savings. That's inspiring much complain reddit respective countries enough, places taboo go sick. Use virus research, keeping cages. that's ""inhumane"", stick human cannon shoot back USA. feel usa proving strategy gets result. Bar Le Kirouac Quebec City wondering What’s Monday holiday? Omg.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* almost like humans talking simians fostered inflated sense development. comment also spin negative China. Kill two birds one stone.  least take seriously. whole emergency hospital building city lockdowns scoffed western media sign oppressive totalitarian lot western media. actual fatality rate disease generally thought 0.5%.

The case fatality rate ignores people mild cases symptoms, get tested nobody catches, looks confirmed cases. Yes stabbed diabetes can’t prove didn’t kill read article suggested one reasons protests didn’t significantly impact numbers weren’t protesting likely stay home stay home couldn’t travel protestors getting COVID, numbers areas didn’t rise much expected non-protesting population much less active areas. article doesn’t present data percentage protestors got COVID, it’s plausible. That's necessarily true. Sweden never went lockdown never close exceeding ICU capacity even though relatively low western standards. crazy. India day. sure. I'm realist, let's actively root ability fight thing. little positive thought go long way, least toward mental health. :) staying partial lockdown area (towns) rest Vietnamese flying back countries staying quarantine camps government repatriate flights. time gone now. That's ok, contacting Covid alternative way build immunity, dislike vaccines. Yeah can, called Eugenics. baseline expected deaths EuroMomo based last 10 20 years something? I'm fine it, long using single outlier year. FT also uses last 10 years comparison slightly different excess numbers. Fine... win. hopefully win. bet she'll die it, seriously doubt vaccine real early. Honestly covid really seem like naturally developed virus, feels like manipulated quiet deadly possible. would go back normal. seriously doubt majority would social distance forever. Goes human nature takes toll mental health.

Outside introverts loved excuse deal people enjoyed shamjng others. year hell people, think majority would keep five years even year ridiculous Based hilariously inaccurate comments see plastered place sub, I’m willing go limb say people either intelligence education contribute positively this. Yeah wall really going stop corona virus 🤓 Yes. dare learn adapt?!?!? keep they're even figure something better. Thousands foreigners live work China. vaccines don’t work, immunity short term, winter doubles death rates, think western civilization could literally collapse.

Or likely people move go back normal roll dice. mean, Uighurs alone enough dismiss China decent government. Add prison labor extreme authoritarianism... yeah, that's want things. 

Turns need focus resources one thing requires total compliance, yeah authoritarian regimes pretty well. let's miss forest trees. friend mine returned China Germany. ***4*** tests; one get plane, two 2-week hotel quarantine, one done company allowed return work. Like said, opinion this, reply made even suspicious. Lost keys? buildings? Checking temperature every building country? Please. interested I'm definitely going research youve said bullshit, make sure people know. Hospitals. That's got mine (Alberta). yea free Given virus eradicated even vaccination. seriously advocating social distancing large gatherings forever? understand ridiculous sound? many think insurance? make lots concessions sacrifices personal life

In US? Ha. pandemic allowed us show true faces: we're bunch whiny little bitches capacity thinking long game (no wonder zero savings). Make big sacrifice back March April, economy open today. 

But no, get: ""we able live lives"", ""cabin fever"", ""what's meaning living we're cooped houses"". 

Anne Frank family hid Annex *700 fucking days* can't even 60, 90? We're bunch fucking pussies.

It's sad far we've fallen. We're still basking ""singlehandedly saved entire world"" WWII (almost 100 years ago!) we're fact shoe salesman still bragging scoring 4 touchdowns one game back high school. Well, yeah, test already sick people hospitals clear symptoms COVID, 50%-60% rate too, that's sure. No. want know that. ""Ignorance bliss"" saying reason. There's reason discuss politics religion people care about, want cause division possible disagreements. Oh sure. I’m sure examples communities too. Likewise, “Asian gangs” likely don’t offer environments happen too. wish could discussions around violence poverty communities put resources there. I’m big believer “this starts home” maybe things make home better?

I made bad choices younger years could definitely started bad cycle, thankfully supportive family willing give chance start (free rent, money college, etc). that, I’m sure would successful today. trying think two things could causally connected realising poorly written headline. AD preparing long ago stadium filled fans Saturdays fall. college kids 2020 (and likely 2021/2022) getting shafted pretty bad, feel them. college supposed crazy fun time life, like put stuff hold like adult. end day, agreed rules school, broke them. yeah, go supermarket wear mask. also, yeah one stop seeing friends. honestly right going want do. kids chose (IMO stupid action) paying it. Fair enough. point good news showed immune response hardly reason attention received. smacks politics. Look urbanisation instead, i.e. proportion population live cities. Much better measure national population density. Lopez Obregon hated figure migrant family since baby dad. guess fucking idiots. blame guy. happens idiot like Trump happens president. piling deaths something could done something reduce though. ""the president"" suppose could worked towards minimizing impact? seems like next door Japanese neighbor living PNW could possibly Mexican nation thing doing...work home, use mask etc... eventually, Mexican national get sick, fly Mexico cause outbreak. Lopez Obrador hand... much. flawed Wuhan could outbreak world would never know.

Yes would. knew first one. know outbreaks recently Beijing Urumqi. 

China's really closed-off think is. signed Facebook summer high school required .edu email address. added freshman roommate coordinated going bring college (rug, fridge etc). 

When got college, everybody added everybody social event. People posted party pictures got stay touch high school friends see parties different schools looked like. (This pre smart phone even camera phone era). 

Then college everybody moves great tool stay touch stay talking. Around time clearly transitioned mind though. turned curated place present facade rather open forum goof closest friends. 

As soon became public people’s families starting get on, photos comments hidden taken down. co workers. People started play games crappy early stage privacy settings. like everyone got together end college burned box embarrassing Polaroids.

I stopped really using eventually totally removed account maybe five six years ago. hear it’s gotten worse believe it. I’m sure it’s harder stay touch people, I’ve happy decision. miss early early Facebook college peers, really turned totally different product. massive increase year year deaths anxiety related causes? believe that? familiar concept hubris? friend would post big long narratives journey, far she'd come, tragedies, disabilities, more-health-problems-than-the-Hapsburgs, rainbow babies everything else. always inspirational joyful celebratory came end hurrah. Man ever fuck up. Like, people like still struggling tried reach basically ignored, *you're* worthy accolades basically saint guess stronger anyone else. Ok. Well fair enough people want positivity, help me, fact drove pit post driver.

I know largely head creating problem, fuck worth get away American, wish visited ""got stuck"" China right pandemic. Quality life safety would much better. get downvoted stating this, really changes nothing trials ""should"" help alleviate anxiety average person pays attention research. say ""should"" definitely see conspiracy wheels already turning something else. 67% single parenthood means one parent willing take care child one parent willing take care child. 

Otherwise, it'd 67% adopted parenthood. 

It sure seems weird ""racism"" makes men unwilling take responsibility affected women same. I'm super worried close family there. 8 examples Canada BC none positive test. also tested antibodies none them. sure making connection it. got numbers mixed head bad that. CDC also came statement saying 6% COVID deaths purely COVID. others pre existing conditions died another cause. Pandemics typically end within 2 years anyway. either way recede next winter Fucking THANK YOU.

People *love* bunch reddit Facebook conveniently forget important fact. move reddit, every post make make top controversial news. talking about? I've seen several different news outlets.

And correct incorrect sometimes, like projections upcoming weather. nice driving South Dakota. OK... so, need explain concept time? Or, beyond that?

I'll ask again. many? Yes, far know. one city called stlpunk even Myspace, think. supposed platform support local music, people used would later use Myspace Facebook. internet friends states made pages. One met guy moved state. fit current vaccine candidates likely receiving emergency approval year end production already begun them. Nah

South Korea

Taiwan

Germany

All those, sure. China? Nope. Man listening shit ngl makes depressed. ppl can’t even fucking wear piece cloth face without bitching it. know. know year even semester remote could probably helped sort lot current issues allowed much thorough planning. think could put together effective plan contingincies situations like couple months unrealistic. certainly. Latin American nations probably significantly younger populations well, yet getting slammed far worse Sweden. 

Age surely factor, Sweden's death rate 410% higher worldwide average. I'd hard pressed believe age demographics account alone. 

Moreover, that's even reason compare Sweden nations like Finland Norway. age demographics almost certainly much closer. make comparison, Sweden's performance looks even worse compare worldwide average. stopped using FB years ago, regrets all. 

I looked recently awhile remembered trash experience there. African American households 67% single parent, Hispanic 40%.,white households 24%, Asian 16%.

Shouldn't push among African American cultural leaders fatherhood important abandoning children wrong? Meanwhile, country so-called ""greatest health care system world"", idea much going cost insurance going pay it. even get started hell uninsured go through. get first gate even get test (let alone find place give test symptoms cases doctor's referral), takes long get results back test winds meaningless public health perspective.

Murica. happen virus. Look post viral syndrome.  5 years ago respiratory problem sure whooping cough. vaccinated late 30s time probably booster.  almost 2 months could anything caused breath hard without causing severe coughing fit. went away easily another 2 3 months cardio lung capacity back normal levels. guy active good shape.  don’t know outcome would someone older health issues.  things like common viruses.  really bad viruses eliminated vaccines people today would rarely experience extreme virus infection something experience with.  thing could happen someone real bad case flu effects also possible that. 16 million recovered cases. tell truth, every industrial park, school, office building communities left 1 entrance China since pandemic begin till now, ensure entrances guarded. properties requiered monitor body temperature record every visitors. inconvenient works well. 

Don't borther find videos, welding door lost keys since doors locked long time already broken. Tshirts set back $30, jackets $150 up. mentioned elsewhere, believe backlash backlash. Sub extremely anti-Chinese beginning, even completely unrelated threads posts, got point lot people got fed propaganda spammed place. Combine currently appears evidence major anti-Chinese talking points, caused pendulum flip way. apparent propaganda way around.

Give time, it'll probably flip back. Interesting. I'll look golden seal. looking meniers sub, saw posts herpes meds. Antivirals helped people go complete remission symptoms. know maybe virus still completely go away. mind genetic disorder diagnosed with. answer want to, pm me. answer still. want pry much. considering 16 million recovered Covid cases there, many think currently heart lung damage? 

Is kind documented proof this? Pro social-order-in-a-pandemic = pro CCP? quit 2013 too? That's dope, everyone knew time told missing out, even saw awful much worse would become line. Nice know folks insight 😄 Yes comorbidity, recovering seeingg Smashmouth. Gee, guess missed crazy thread. Removed, removed, removed......... Victor Hugo, nice meet you! Praying guys 🇲🇽✊🏾✌🏾 No, don’t know, sorry.  


You could check Kawasaki-like Syndrome reports NYC April, seems like strong connection. american, also support behavior. 

Fucking entitled ass Americans cant trusted.... Bingo. College tuition racket. Wow, thanks detailed update. congrats! deleted Facebook like 10 years ago. still, quite inappropriately, make photos teenager available along name guess info people finder sites. really think distributing photos minors, especially clear action/request make unavailable account deactivation presumed owner media. Adopt don’t shop! China showing following rules months gets you. Pay attention NA talking CPC context virus general? sub clear rules **no politics unless directly related virus.** dad good example, network 8 million USD. came nothing clothes India.

My tenants white folks 11 divorced, broken family shit. White folks ain't immune. graduated high school 20 years ago US education system joke. would spend half school year relearning things learned previous year. Many classes consisted reading chapter completing worksheet. discussion material anything. way much time spent watching videos. educational videos anything subject. Movies like Little Mermaid. least Forrest Gump historical content, still.

And let's forget pushing poor performers next grade struggle more, instead helping out. kids high school could barely read. Well honestly thinking regular old ink tattoos, like idea too! Facebook cancer. Get rid it. - new cases imported, new cases recorded contact travellers... claim community transmission.

Which believable tbh; multiple countries managed it, India would managed really crappy socioeconomic reality. China good job handling virus. *bizarre* see people praising it? almost took virus seriously reaping benefits conscientiousness.  Sweden like 8th something highest death rate per capita world. got rid ear stuff golden seal antibiotics nothing. 
The rest harder. 
Got diagnosed genetic disorder helped. 
Got diagnosed severely low magnesium helped. 
It’s long slow process occasionally finding things help leveling up. thing caused lot deaths Sweden - bad policies seniors homes / long term care.

So seems *that* get ""big numbers"" whether lock down. Whether people go bars clubs kind immaterial situation care workers spreading Covid around care facilities giving seniors proper attention. Data data, nothing makes better worse. I've definitely said anything making Sweden's data worse. agree say data pretty accurate (is fairly close excess death statistics). 

But data also clearly points stark difference Sweden's performance, world's average, say nothing best performing countries world. today, Sweden 410% counted deaths world's average. Let's extremely generous say rest world undercounted 80% (as far know, actual studies put worldwide undercount deaths anywhere near high). would *still* make Sweden's rate 183% higher average (and that's using Sweden's official death count, excess death figure). Hahaha god Election meddling country? Brazil? US? Nicaragua? Seems odd invent worldwide deadly pandemic influence single country's election. honest, outside little risk. Although going Disney land meeting 12 people pushing bit suppose. everyone shutting world possibly year, seeing anyone barely stepping outside front door think overkill. certain point mental health issues would worse pandemic (dependent live widespread there).

Obviously experiencing symptoms waiting test absolutely stay home, arguments there. never said always. assume two parents ALWAYS better one stupid beyond belief.

To assume anything ALWAYS happens human behavior stupid. people ever make claims worth air breath discussion.

I LITERALLY said “averages”. don’t know else say known mathematical function. you’re going bring skiing medals risk factor, Norway decimated😆 part pisses motorcyclist, identified man 60s underlying health conditions, intensive care unit time death, said Kris Ehresmann, state's infectious disease director.

All resources spent trying save life someone ignored warnings. risk incurred health care workers guy probably would mocked insulted. Mostly became r/China. Backlash backlash; people got fed seeing rabid hate spammed place anti-Chinese propaganda dominant, especially since current current evidence give us much reason believe anti-China people right. propaganda care truth, give time; pendulum probably swing back soon enough. This. People pretend Facebook problem. symptom, like Trump. real problem absolutely terrible large portion people are, sad. China number local outbreaks past months, they've promptly shut down. one expecting keep virus entirely, done, deal promptly efficiently emerges.

Life China normality, exception cases found city, case life returns 'wartime' conditions weeks gets sorted out. seems working pretty well far. make absolutely mention doctors nurses risked health saved lives. much higher population density Sweden, Denmark could easily worse outbreak. Feel free provide scientific source extraordinary claim. Universal minimum income now! started screen Chinese students airports technology theft. Good luck butterfly effect this. additional Chinese students seeing ""Murikkka"" outside university campuses is, Washington everything add friction Chinese would want study full 33% STEM graduates US Asian. Chinese part production STEM talent. bet short-term problem. Probably Sweden took different approach Scandinavian neighbours. creates rather unique way evaluating success Sweden’s strategy (which say misunderstood spun political purposes countries). weird another narrative first generation Asian immigrants care education, pushing kids study bots grew poverty. Per CDC data, total all-cause deaths per year past years around 2,700,000 (+ -). lump pneumonia influenza together around 50,000-60,000 (+ -) deaths per year.  someone could predicted this. Hmm. roaring 20s artifact media/cultural elite good whilst everyone else 'meh' then? Learned Great Gatsby school, never looked deeply it. old news two weeks ago?  one taking deposits weddings. people wed really ones blame here? tend view engagement parties self-indulgent anyway. Getting engaged isn’t life event anymore getting pregnant is. It’s prelude life event   Positivity rate 5%. 6 months pandemic. nuts. Americans systematically sacrificed altar “freedom” economy.  really really feel everyone trying hard safe US. virus opinion rights. comment nonsensical. 

It matters whether population respects rights. 

Because virus regardless. think would open ton legal liability. Good riddance.last thing anyone needs toxic relationships.....Especially world uncertainties Dude say peacefully protesting. virus isnt going know fair, American people indoctrinated Vehemently averse contract tracing could prevent thousands deaths. Aaaand it’s like mask policies, America fuck ya. really annoying seeing article like ""30 cases linked this"" gets 10K upvotes ton awards. Like tf? 5G Thanks reassurance! I’m freaking think spot on. hard truth since majority deaths Sweden frail elderly care homes. 

You downvoted fair. I've also seen reports masks breathing valves shit block particles. ""Deaths fallen cliff! Pandemic over!"" Sunday. many amateur epidemiologists join today? Congratulations!!! would want first memory married couple possibly include supporting COVID and/or possibly killing people? U.S. involvement WW2 lasted 3.5 years resulted ~420k dead Americans. Coronavirus affecting U.S. 6 months 188k confirmed dead (likely higher).

But whatever need tell yourself, man. photographed small wedding yesterday.
The dances held barn. people enter barn. former clients, also Doctors. rare. forget shut peoples lives 6%. Oh, never thought conspiracy. healthcare professional 40 years, prepared pandemic February. surprised many deaths haven’t counted COVID-19. holy shit vaccines take couple years develop yet 6 months later jumping line? Jesus Christ. count fuck out. Emails telling everybody work even symptoms... stop wasting PPE... know one place told wear masks would scare residents. We'll triple digits probably November It’s amazing make weddings big deal. 50,000 dollar weddings, every person Facebook list, spreading virus isn’t going make marriage last forever. Gonna suck people know pass away marriage fails 2 years. PA Governor Wolf forced elderly COVID patients back nursing homes instead hospital, making disease spread kill people- high risk. Wolf prosecuted. Definitely spoon spork best point. course, that’s it’s similar countless viri we’ve studied. One political party denying Covid much other.

Therefore, followers said party much likelier wear masks, believe hoax, big deal. Why? That’s lot negligence lawsuits. nope, DSA long time now. I’m *Father-in-law* word looking for. applies well. case. thing Ontario. appointment expecting everyone would wearing masks one guy face shield another literally nothing. medical office...  Thanks info! Fiance supposed get married 2 weeks today.  Way back May rescheduled fall 2021 obvious going September 2020.

People rescheduled April/May/June fall 2020 either stupid selfish both.  venues allowed host 100+ person parties also fault. VA budget like 80 billion/year guess they’re dying figure circle money back need travel December made sure schedule beginning month could quarantine 2+ weeks Christmas. people dumb. thought contagious virus ever? wear masks stay 6ft apart gonna die .. let know would also suck?
Fearmongering living life shit never going end. Everyone’s going get point. There’s way around it. 

I’m going get downvoted oblivion, wear mask you’ll fine. I’ve two weddings last months wonderful. unified strategy? ignorant people even wear mask grocery shop 30 fuckin minutes. unified response? lmaooo. government us exactly want. completely divided. much so, third half population can't even wear piece fabric face.  argument somebody said Diamond Princess proof hoax... 3000+ passengers, 700 got infected, 14 people died.

 like, that's 2% infection fatality rate.. besides, 21 people ended eventually dying ship. 

 said no.. ship ""everybody exposed"".. count 3000 IFR calculation.  So.. worse normal flu...

 like, wtf? isolated everybody somewhat quickly tested everybody... I'm like... ""It work way..."" best friend supposed get married November Italy everything pretty much set. took responsible route postponed wedding 1 year later. Cmon people. One reasons arguments polarised lack clarity mean words use discussing issues. definition lockdown might yours, think goals might understanding it.

It would better steel-man OPs definition lockdown understand meant, impression he/she honest discussion, went.

For thinking need lockdown avoid overwhelming hospitals, depends mean lockdown, Sweden restriction visiting nursery homes, form lockdown. Another way increase hospital capacity, work avoid overwhelming hospitals, goals singular simplistic that. Yeah, paperwork after, good friend got officiate without needing ordained anything. fine. state Australia tightest lockdown world state’s death toll equivalent 1200 scaled Sweden’s population. 

I assume Victorian. Sweden population 10.352 million. Victoria population 6.651 million. actual equivalent toll, scaled population Sweden 1,036 (not 1,200). Sweden's death toll 5.6 times higher, per head population.

Stockholm County population 2.344 million death toll 2,380. Per head population, Stockholm County 10 times number deaths Victoria.

Sweden deaths per head population last three months Victoria throughout entire pandemic. US cases competely control one even trying 5000 correctly dismissed. UK still missed tens thousands deaths beginning pandemic, according excess mortality data. I'm glad swayed. one conspiracy.

It's alot worse. Herd immunity begins effectiveness 70% exposure. easily verified information. uncomfortable, man. like, hard scratch ur nose. also trump told dont work father smart man. Yes vaccine produced distributed early, however without proper testing trials, know long term ramifications bad vaccine could do. yes, best case 4 years minimum. risk nonexistent, particularly indoors eating drinking involved. 

It’s fine say option cancel delay blows you’d lose lot money, still option. grandparents plus diabetic uncle dying. ""spillover jail 2 nursing homes"" problem folks say ""just isolated ones risk let everyone else whatever!"". 


Obviously people saying actually agree stop visiting grandma uncle bob. That's work. states pneumonia deaths far last year combined. severe? thought viruses got weaker mutate. arguing behalf people irresponsible? Could, I'm scared could used election. many Deaths? Zero dont give shit Well probably lot overlap people poor critical thinking/risk assessment skills people commit crime.

I'm US state I'm guessing 85-90% mask compliance rate. people observe wearing masks usually fall 2 different categories.

1. Lower income demographics races.

2. Middle class, middle aged white people.

So think probably commit crime? know. say one thing 100% certainty.

People wear masks love disrespect rude service workers. might committing crimes, actively demeaning employees. rude mask wearing Covid19 stuff, they're assholes general. Ah, loony conspiracy theorist. Florida somehow hiding thousands covid deaths, surely able point family others reported incorrectly labeled. point even one mislabeled death? don’t stop liquid particles? That’s stage number massive studies done scientists proving opposite. matriculate? can't afford it

What backwards ass countries would charge vaccine? guarantee majority guests likely live close people age range.

Diseases *spread* young people it, old vulnerable people spread to.

Also, get fucked ""lololololol old ppl die"" garbage. one selfish ideas there. fucktards like think okay let old people die? offer give people back deposits. would probably change lot minds.  Best news ever!!! Woohoo! Virus X exist, would people died? barely Coronavirus-related. fucking cares. fine. think we’d actually achieve herd immunity faster way.

frontline healthcare workers first (cops, nurses, doctors, paramedics, firefighters), teachers, vaccination days schools universities. 

then companies could host vaccination days. 

we get majority 5-45 age range vaccinated rest get covid naturally develop temporary immunity. virus viable hosts.  Well thankfully [COVID cases spiking following studied one needs prove anything, already proven. 

Just like contact tracing continues prove large indoor gatherings spreading virus far wide. Wrong. Given young healthy least likely suffer adverse side effects covid last.

As bar vaccine would much higher young healthy. Whereas small risk negative side effects vaccine vastly better high chance dying covid many high risk groups face People dumb selfish. got married wedding gone. threshold lockdown measures near universal testing response local transmission China 1 case. European country responded way country capacity March. Still, largest outbreaks China since February gotten hundreds.  


If threshold action hundreds cases, already jeopardized chance containment. Thank god. don’t think I’d survive quarantining four damned years.... 

....wait. Since testing hangups road blocks removed, mean vaccine might risky take? Get microchip bullshit. k-12 schools southern state cost $45,000. understood exponential growth would b less funny you. implying people care anyone immediate family.

The entire ""one man army"" rhetoric came this. People care other. Happened country, happening America.

Nothing placebo billed such... people want buy something smell feel better it

You never ever ever eat way could kill bad satire comes wit notably failed that. them. Hi aunt uncle Mexicali haven’t left home since March. even groceries. America #1! Like here’s one one consider it... death rate Covid around 1-1.5%. 126M people Mexico. Herd immunity occurs 60-70% population dies (possibly less due variance population affected). maybe max 1.1 million deaths. 

It’s absolute worse case scenario don’t think come that, especially next 4-5 months. 

70,000 people (reported) died Covid 19 already. Yah go spread it, kill people. make sure elderly immunocompromised stuck indoors years, cuz fuck em right? gotta live life. point ffbe shutdown contain stop spread, increase testing, isolate trace get cases almost 0. failed completely attitude fuck open up.

Morally bankrupt freak. don’t specifically ask people protest? ask anyone contact 10 minutes. says people opportunity tell them. Seems like you’re grasping straws. seem interested listening opinion it. He's usually gung-ho killed small conveniences, I'm sure what's going mind lately.

:'( would intentionally infect country 25mn people, including countless communities royal flying doctor's service away nearest ICU, vs locking one city outbreak?

There really concept ""greater good"" some, there. even ""once eradicate it, far relaxed"". even, ""once vaccine, 100+ development, many performing wells trials, saved thousands lives delaying"". seems ""me me"" ""now now"", struggle see society function well short sighted thinking imo.

But understand alone thinking this, there's many ways build community. I'm glad live though, welcome feel same. Well, pretty fucking high. Jeez. needs vaccines old fashioned way free. Gathering like what? protesters outside, majority mask wearing, haven’t linked rise cases.

Sturgis linked many cases, including death, breaking every rule was. Stop pathetic two sides bullshit. protesters? Baseball make double headers. NFL, good luck making game. Pfft, idiots. america states. That’s it’s United States America, United States Mexico get job grocery store, gas station, Dunkin Donuts, etc. There's plenty retail workers overworked fuck.

You're probably good that, though everyone seems make suggestion. never stopped working bills late work grocery store. Health safety rules put tremendous strain relationship family. parents 63, isolating fairly well - dad doctor sees patients office 4 days week goes golfing, mom plays tennis goes grocery store, wear masks whenever leaving house.

The problem I'm running parents want constantly visit least every 3-4 weeks b/c they're bored socialize anyone else. Every time explain feel uncomfortable visits, get blamed bad son want see parents. explain they've maintaining good safe practices can't stand home anymore socializing, explain +190,000 people died, risky behavior sort social gathering, morally unfair friends, family, communities privilege seeing loved ones, especially who've died. especially difficult b/c know lot friends abiding rules, friends seeing respective families time socializing without masks. parents feel left want see kids, ""bad cop"" explain good idea.

I'm struggling finding ways understand moral predicament they're putting in. matter safe say they're being, can't find good conscience see risk something happening them, get mad ME.

I've read articles parents conversations kids seriousness rules pandemic. But, experience I've noticed older people harder time adapting younger people, mainly b/c feel much time left lives spend quality time family friends. anyone hard conversations parents keep busy, adapt, come terms new reality? anyone advice explaining one rules pandemic? 

Thanks!  Ironic CCP propagandists subreddit truly extremely biased. It’s different keep money fill room ;) double. Tuition spot. though. moved next idiotic comments anyone even noticed. like another president... They're farmers markets every country farmers markets. buying racist propaganda. pretty close, USA still numero uno ☝️ went thru comment history get backstory holy shit. Therapy like yesterday, girl 😂 Good, shutting economy correct option. Masks, social distancing limiting large gatherings largely effective reducing spread. whole point shutdown slow spread overwhelm healthcare system. literally turned buildings field hospitals never needed. Hospitalizations down, whole point, thing governors used sell lockdowns achieved. Seeing small percentage country participated protests, don’t see way relevant. jobs places open entire time. work grocery store. never closed we've never stopped trying get help. We're overworked.

Why that?

I've frankly asked people this, people upset working. always excuses ALWAYS get offended angry me. ""You can't TELL kind job get!!! Shut Nazi!!!"" (Really.)

So insane actually want job, find stressed fuck retail workers help them.  Unless attend motorcycle festival Lol vastly overestimating mask usage rest. 11 countries testing several different vaccines China. Yes, saw family first time 5 months. outdoor, socially distanced potluck. felt comfortable moment. Better go add country, add China. 😉 Oh shit. Need warn family members want go there. anything, Sars Cov 2 become less deadly time probably end one normal Coronaviruses already circulating. Cause viruses evolve... deadly strains die out, virus needs host replicate. Killing host side effect.
Less severe strains spread easier sick feel bad still go day. It’s natural course diseases.

And no, spanish flu around anymore. mutated, got less severe caused new strain influenza manifest population. One likely scenarios Sars Cov 2. Since getting unpopular racist African origin people's, America moving racist againts Asians. One things we’ve learned facebook people using keep touch aren’t worth keeping touch It’s healthy keep posting doom gloom articles. people Mexico access private hospitals. state/federally run hospitals. greater Melbourne area entered second lockdown 9 July rise cases. 5km (3 mile) travel limit night time curfew imposed shops businesses closed. seemed one trying justify death-misery cheering.

No, purpose pretty straightforward: obvious satire. Satire often isn’t funny, bleak grim. 

Change nothing people dying, sub goes cheers jeers. find cheering Mexican deaths disgusting, find entire sub abhorrent way celebrate American deaths. Check post history, doubt it.

And think Johns Hopkins mistaking them, either.  ya feeling Yeah except we've since march we're still stage 4 lockdown That’s IFR, CFR. 
IFR deaths divided real number infected, CFR deaths divided confirmed cases (so ignores millions unconfirmed cases). Well, mom always yelling something something socialism-communism-Canadians-come-here-for-healthcare-blah-blah-trump-and-black-doctors-are-bad-doctors! Upvote not. /s ""Relax, I'll miss funeral too"" would probably hit better. upvoted you, kinda unfair Muppets. Unless mean Statler Waldorf, guys pretty damn similar Turdburgler Chief.

&amp;#x200B;

also- half us, 30% registered voters key states voted office due electoral college. popular vote factually Hillary Clinton. Rough india?? Lol how?? Prob none virus isn’t really bad. Thanks, I’m glad said this. misleading statement headline. thinking thing. pandemic isn’t going years ever, absolutely go back normal life start getting vaccines treatments effectively reduce risk death flu levels. 

That isn’t false hope; it’s simple fact. Well, could answer questions immunity pretty fast human challenge trials. Thank you! produced already (as leading candidates), enough everyone immediately. However, at-risk production mean considerable amount people could vaccinated year already (assuming approval comes time). even nationally- immediate responses state/locally driven, National response followed- begrudgingly, abusing/undermining local efforts. Unless talking US government tutelage Kush, diverted PPE cases, ripped hands several states. hope isolating much possible then. I've seen alot people say high risk shaming anti maskers yet little contain risk ""because punished people's stupidity?"" I'm sorry that's works *""Momma always said Stupid Stupid does""*. herd immunity way go all. everyone else ─ people know jack shit ─ skeptical fearful vaccines variety reasons.

Yes, earth could go wrong giving people live attenuated viruses trigger immune response? Nothing proper safety testing done. skip steps lose valuable information. questions 'educated' person like ask:

If takes 7 days one vaccines generate immune response, vaccinated patients ""contagious"" vaccine time? forget happened used live attenuated virus fight anyone published PCR test results determine live attenuated virus defeated immune system? try pump numbers means? Welcome sad club! agree points except  
  may never vaccine- 
 
I seen article expert saying ""there may never vaccine"" long time now. seems become matter when, 
 one- reputable experts maintain position every time question vaccine comes up.

And go ahead cite ""they even admit flawed!"" going need reputable source.

Edit: can't even get numbers recruited 60 COVID-19 patients (mean age ± SD, 44.10 ± 16.00 years; Male: 34/60, 56.70%) COVID-19 group another 39 age- sex-matched non-COVID-19 volunteers (mean age ± SD, 45.88 ± 13.90 years; Male: 22/39, 56.40%) enrolled control group. 

whats 60+39? 59? That's actually great idea! seems unlikely would it... Depression, anger, frustration, paranoia, ...
All bad stuff. 

And let’s forget witch-hunts, finger pointing, overall increase cultural conflict America.

Who needs external enemies anyway? Many Catholic Schools grew around closed past 20 years... Little bit white flight, little bit child abuse (and people saying supporting legal fund pedo priests, words mine). think people partly walking away church's hiding pedos, part black people city grew generally catholic. Imagine anniversary annual reminder 56 people got ill wedding, probably one two died. NZ one biggest clusters wedding, father groom died it. Narrator: aren't. wedding day fucking stressful. second eloping celebrating later. lot digest. masks. Vaccinations even important measures covid followed. found correlation protesting covid surges

Protesting form gathering. Beachgoing less form gathering. correlation protesting covid surges. Thus, logically speaking, correlation beachgoing covid surges. I'm sorry someone pissed make density numbers intend real.  made bunch shit referring article read.

Have heard common  article density people whether led covid outbreaks 

I mean, kind Justice Protests Major Cause COVID-19 Infection Surges, New National Study Suggests Victoria, USA? worry, July 21st Trump ""We process developing strategy that’s going very, powerful."" South Africa alot treatment Maleria, Asia countries. seem pattern countries lower covid deaths, Hydroxycholique similar meds good dot connect.

Also remember less people travel Africa compared Spain, USA UK. wedding supposed May. got legally married, May next year use money paid towards anything, lose all. sucks. cancelled pandemic started already paid 80% everything owed. would $15k cancelled together. rescheduled April 10th next year. I'm hoping it. incredibly narrow insular view business risk. say someone traditionally intelligent took little risk career.

Society needs reward two things: work risk. That's fundamental society, one took risk, businesses provide goods services. also think framing business owners people risk *other's* capital highly misrepresentative. Small business owners rarely raise small sum money friends family. Usually savings business loans. put line corner lot BYOB book store franchise. fail, failure them. rare exceptions people get capital parents can't afford it? Sure, operating savings/business loans.

Larger business raise money investors, know they're getting take chunk business.

When talk people idiots make you, I'm talking people dick way typical office job wind middle management kissing right ass compared decently intelligent people selfless, lower paying jobs like teaching, social work, etc... Uhhh, yeah? sounds like parents losers never money. tough shit like cut relevant part first quote. part idea people idiots. Sure, ""consent"" area coworker, knew gone huge event masks covid otherwise. links one study order furnish headline, study flawed, even people running study admit. able reach required sample size. 

And study makes worldwide assumptions sample comes single hospital obviously flawed. Someone without mask (delivery guy) approached talked me. stayed 1 meter distant other. wearing mask. interaction fast. worried? even understand difficult/expensive process is? That’s thing though.  make true accurate statement saying: “statistically speaking, age 0-39 chances dying super low” SHOULDNT MODIFY INFORMATION POINT STILL RISKS. 

It’s pathetic people expected qualify true statements every possible bad outcome (like Viagra commercial) else downvoted oblivion here.

Edit: I’m speaking generalities. Nothing specific course freedom weird term us america. mean free? upon reflection, obvious.

you could say, i'm free whatever want unfettered long legal state.

but that's sort negative definition freedom - compared to: freedom poverty, freedom access healthcare, freedom earn living wage, etc.

if consider ""going store"" freedom, that's applicable every nation. 

personally, i'd say vietnamese feeling much freer right now. still track month? vaccine side-effects, people live upwards 80 years! Better use low life expectancy guinea pigs, quality life lowered, live long.  comment stating 40% us death linked nursing homes removed poor quality information. false. information may never heard, it’s low quality. (See link). Except goal posts moved. Flatten Curve never ending pandemic, keeping number hospitalizations accommodate available us medically. Further, singular 2 week period. concept Flatten Curve explained intended used whenever numbers hospitalizations began overwhelm medical resources. 

Regarding vaccine, one politicians grifters ever promised even hoped vaccine would ready time frame US Government pushing. Every last reputable scientist, epidemiologist, virologist Medical professional maintained best case scenario working vaccine least year 18 months commencement work vaccine- extremely optimistic estimate, assumes vaccine created. may never vaccine- HIV one- reputable experts maintain position every time question vaccine comes up. 

No one promised rose garden, think otherwise need listen carefully avoid letting confirmation bias get way. Irish 🇮🇪 ? Although results tests late change course treatment deceased, still help health officials track prevalence types infections, well indicate whether warn close contacts deceased may need new regulations also stipulate living patients flulike symptoms known exposure coronavirus flu virus tested pathogens. makes less likely case missed first regulation doesn’t apply deaths — suspected linked respiratory illness marketwatch study. article links many reputable studies. except 1 chose ignore, one chose criticize one oldest universally respected medical journals world.

And socially distanced mask wedding also thing. BLM protest, one would've contracted “It is” That's works. entire country Germany roughly 9,000 deaths. Great job Georgia. already killed people going kill. Viruses killing mostly elderly people already sick anything new Saves time tests. low risk sending infected back population. behind shorter, safer thoroughly researched quarantine periods. Less disruptive travelers returning home. Hahah thank 'expected' southern brutha...

&amp;#x200B;

The bar 'up there' guys....keep reaching. would taking care issues proper aid support? Nice deflection using Brazil example, western eu under, Canada much better jobs avoided issues. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate would likely match currently circulating Bars open table service Sweden. Sweden's economy much better. 

Sweden outperforming many EU economies (especially thatbdepend tourism), significantly better neighbors (where tighter lockdowns imposed). US, botched response, get both.

Fully agreed. work weddings paid deposit last year happening getting rescheduled get much anxiety around people traveling wearing masks pretending pandemic going on. telling dirty piece cloth mouth enough completely stop spread covid. Even people shouting/chanting crammed together like sardines?

Sorry buy it. silver lining India super low (relatively) CFR. huge population is, bound lot infections, least infections leading deaths. could change though spreads quickly. delay inevitable. 

You know delaying inevitable whole point medecine, right? We’re letting freedom ring, comra-.....errrr, fellow American. good news virus also handle fire well, they're probably OK.

If want gripe ""peaceful protests"" turning riots go different subreddit. /r/coronavirus. seems least learned feels remorse work wedding industry i've deposits weddings rescheduled fall can't believe people going shit. feels incredibly selfish. actually seems like viable way out. Let spread 18-24 year olds college campuses. 51,000 cases. low death rate. Build immunity young healthy point. think it’s easiest way out. 

But Jesus Christ - Don’t send kids home. Don’t suspend fly asymptomatic selfs back parents home grandma lives. Let stay campus allow sickness run it’s course healthy populations there. Liberal? selfish fucktard isnt political stance. Better check China's constitution posting. elope big party later date. Gracias muy amable days wouldn’t gotten paid.  suddenly people take active interest funding supporting public schools, things improve everyone? think education stratified income level grade school. socioeconomic problems hurt schools, need create systems accommodate disparity. goal lessen inequality US. control.  I'm supposed getting married 2 months time.

The current problem is, mostly paid off, venue bit difficult letting us move dates.

Covid really fucked us financially year, lost job, future work etc. venue let us move date, theres way able afford atleast another 2 years. 

If go ahead there's way many guests, thrown away lot money sub 30 people party, going really awkward huge empty space, really quiet music playing.

What shit year. downvotes? It’s true vaccine manufacturers exempt lawsuits US since 1986 Right there’s millions brink evicted is. People can’t follow stay home don’t homes. Although use term ""strain"" quite often, mutations thus far genetically speaking significant enough actually considered new strains. Thankfully SARS-Cov2 quite stable none mutations present challenges vaccine perspective.

A SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate would likely match currently circulating saying protests 6 feet apart. comment saying wear mask couldn’t outdoor events. im lol. im saying time line events new yorks infection early, florida after. Yes no. numbers new cases high, sometimes higher April (also there's much testing), rate deaths, hospitalizations, ICU entries 1/10th peak. stopped decreasing August slightly increasing think better prepared second wave. equivalent chest xray. Guarantee it, no. Raise odds compared negative test. Hell yes ! rank statement someone jealous us work respectful organization bent backwards enhance ability get staff work home safety, including adding whatever internet, hardware, contacts needed keep employees SAFE. contractors, cleaners, kitchen staff people BANNED office complex keep us SAFE.

Second wave looming? 
Now organization offering office furniture credits home office supplies need it, since staying person closed 2021.

Feeling stressed? offer 24/7 services call.
Force us go vacation work.
Kids crying? ok, take break family.

There white collar conspiracy, technology used keep people safe, using it. shit places work America give shit anything $$. break week applies swedes.

Applies Swedish *schoolchildren*.

Norway Denmark [has american study? (toss...)

&amp;#x200B;

As per educated Canadian doctors, ""Avoid gathering large groups."".

They say shit reason. :) US simply doesn’t social cohesion that. There’s many hateful people US would never let certain people get taste working 3 weeks.

Too many people US worried evicted is, people can’t follow stay home orders they’re homeless. *then cousin it(she’s young, partied)they told keep quiet nurse afraid would die hospital. aunt takes care I’m scared might get whole, large family, sick. Plus manage store number people could also come contact them. folks going HATE news. could permanently wreck anyone's heart. median age death good statistic use. Probably diseases going high median age death simply older people fragile, unless disease specifically deadly young people.

Having said that, covid-19 definitely lot less deadly younger are, lots us live older people, concerned disease could spread older people somewhere line. forget lot young people comorbidities weak immune systems. according official admissions stable deaths still going sub “literally” fake news lol. Come ppl story several months ago India mass protest China, ""boycott China"" T-shirts made China. Again: clinical trial delayed enough obese people. fact can't grasp simple logic problem lol. Also, military strict travel restrictions since March/April timeframe. We've literally ordered stay home, travel leave denied. civilian employer asks travel, pretty much want. military orders service member, breaking result loss stripes. 

The ""guidelines"" rest America difficult time following become black-and-white laws us. Huh? Well said. Thank you! That's called ""challenge trial"" vaccinated people given virus least hope catch soon. obvious ethical problems that, Phase III trials take time, wait vaccinated people get infected naturally, unintentionally, ask report think infections (or regular testing). entitlement full display!!! 

And parting gift... refreshing see complacency offer standard line of, ""we everything right still got COVID."" said, like others little sympathy family. (Mandatory caveat hope kid ultimately fine) $40 spend week groceries. like Elvis polio vaccine! Thank well measured response. sure vitally important Labor Day Thanksgiving Christmas. least show faces tools decided union simply could wait important health everyone know.

Yes, let us obtain mob justice. MUST publicly condemn shame people feel good. Otherwise, justify time spent keyboard shitting people? exactly. Decoupling happening area. example, draconian sanction USA put Huawei Chinese mobile phone makers probably lead world split cell phone standards. Walgreens dollar. Masks aren’t 100%. *think Cold air triples quadruples distances (from read meat packing plants, near freezing temp makes distances 30’). would thought, locking people inside social contact 4+ months would lead depression.



Someone missed crowds beaches Memorial Day, 4th July, Disney World Universal Studios open. Bars restaurants open. Schools reopening..


Maybe people depressed promised Covid-19 'just Flu' would disappear Easter.., spring warmth..., summer heat.., screw get back school work drones.., cares 3rd leading cause death 2020..., 190,000 Americans what..., fake news.., ignore 99% scientists doctors..., listen Dr Demon Semen... I'm curious, many people floor ended getting sick? PPE really effective? EXACTLY people don’t follow recommendations. exactly people thoroughly disgusted supposed “experts”.  polio vaccine developed 1950s. long take eradicate disease? Especially places everyone works informal economy there’s little social safety net. 

Im going pretend know right approach countries, probably require different strategies western countries do. really think transmitted damn beach? ocean sand healthy body. grim reaper guy dumbass going beach, go crowded bars visited back May read?

""**275 guests""**

So, obviously least 275 people cared enough show up. people stay home holidays failed us twice far...Memorial Day 4th July (maybe three times, Easter?). Maybe it’s time adopt alternative strategy?

Uh- no. shit individuals SOFAKING selfish refuse learn mistakes. holiday mention, irrefutable proof cases roared control significant deaths caused people failed stay home. lesson shitwitted buffoon take away is, stay TF home next holiday. amount leadership governing change moronic fact adverse decisions compel people treat holiday weekends bizarro world immunity period.

&amp;#x200B;

edit clarity. incivil post? Also, fuck you. I’ll take extra 15 years life. Thanks though. Phase III trials take time. covered Phase III It’s beyond garbage. It’s disgusting. yet another master obvious making stupid statement. might crazy, something see suing court helping. small claims court venues doesn’t cost much. Federal global guidelines say unsafe hold event, especially indoors... surely judge worth salt would force venues refund deposits. Depression never topic discussion country. Full stop. nephew started freshman year there. Went end August. Immediately infected. recovered. I’m furious. schools doing?  Nothing. getting kids sick. Same.

Also seeing ""liberal"" friends hopping planes go vacation places like Colorado California wherever avoid summer heat ""they need feel less depressed"" makes want tear hair out. Bunch selfish jerks.   “246
Vaccines silver bullet end Covid-19 pandemic ... “

Yeah? SHIT. vaccines way. None immediately end disease. keep see stories like these?  vaccine help mitigate effect population, won’t cure population disease decades, ever. Disease eradication difficult achieve. 

The public discourse subject continues ridiculously aggravating. Yeah we're talking aboot Canadians here, eh? refund early withdrawal class specific time. Right now, even trial period classes yet. choice ?

surely 'abstinence' choice . control around time lockdown ended.

I dont know fuck thinking since then. pretty clear make significant changes hospitals overflowing again.

I find frustrating talking heads TV telling people well managed different time people seem happy hear it. ran numbers check out. issues breeders continuously breed dogs poor health ie brachycephalic breeds bulldogs pugs, etc. hock walking GSD, mastiffs yeasty wrinkles skin.

Those breeders matter show, work, volunteer cannot agree with. No, ""screw poor"". ""poor"" actually spend lot, first wave get back work safely, get back income, supporting themselves, etc.

It elderly, homes, ever leave home, wait bit longer, IMO. Seeya. Propane heaters canopies. wish screening cell immunity straightforward streamlined antibody screening. would enormously useful epidemiology WTF watch?? getting married I'd probably take pandemic opportunity small court wedding deal stress cost normal one. virus targeting different races

If poorer people tend obese impact vaccine efficacy. fact can’t grasp simple logic problem anymore lol people minnesota subbreddit like this. completely baffles honestly. nEeD rEoPeN EcOnoMy - dOnAlD dErPaLDeRp Yep. narcissistic sociopaths run wedding venues catering companies. Don’t put couples can’t get money back reschedule. might get data month October/November likely regards approval early distribution oh will! Highest daily cases since May 22 still get someone like Warren Buffet exist. Someone *that* much money *never* humble. definitely something keep eye on.  part idea people idiots. 

If way ask. cases materialized weeks wedding, anyone relationship knows, right always optimal path take. point post can't always use logic reason many life's situations milestones emotional.

Red flags work great significant others, lot times family obligations get choose gets in. worth son daughter-in-law mad eternity want risk getting sick wedding? another person pointed out, wedding venue/catering/photo deposits works, eating cost might mean waiting two years enough hold ceremony family members could also stuck date they're committed to. venue holding deposit want dicks, allow people cancel wedding, cashflow keep staff payroll. I'm trying say there's right wrong answer, sympathetic people pick rock hard place. Yep it’s disaster here. ones taking seriously, nightly clubbing bar hopping throughout city poor adherence mask rules. neighborhood active vocal anti-mask/hoaxer movement unfortunately people hold power influence here. Really depressing honestly. AZ going back up? Got it..so hyper focused ...yikes need break reddit! Thanks~ understand that, many people dedicated like takes special person(s). No, fully expect bunch comments i'm harbinger death. LOL. returned food shopping well, maybe go store week. Keep mask stay away people, keep sanitizer car i'm there. lose-lose situation, already lost much. original wedding supposed Disney Cruise end month 20 people joining us.  5 months, suffering mental breakdown due isolation, spending days hospital, slightly different view regarding COVID. lean left, voting morals...but certain point take personal responsibility aware whats going around us.  feel may able that, cope staying inside home 24/7 unforeseeable amount time, stay inside.  I'm lucky company tests weekly basis. try best can.  Stay safe! Well guess rest assured 56 cases end matter right 21% exponential growth works, ridiculously low new cases today, think it’s safe say new cases dramatically impacted fact majority city likely already virus. Got source one.

Yea- many RNA vaccines ever approved human use? Also cost? vaccine free civilised world.

Do think healthcare free United States? THIS. Self responsibility way get control. Honestly, nothing short martial law compels individuals act best interest health public, matter leader ""imposes"", fail. think misunderstand. I'm sure people perfectly decent, profession ethically not. It’s venues vendors think. 

Going right sucks much. Venue wants $2000 move it. Caterer move lose deposit. That’s another $1500. It’s simple everyone thread making it. already spent good deal it’s going up. went therapy mild depression months 2019, ended covid-19. think getting back feeling okay it.

However, covid-19 left feeling mostly empty. actually recently graduated engineer working whole year good salary, covid-19 made work feel meaningless remotely since March. Furthermore, even though University years fairly socially active, covid-19 managed dry relationships.

So yeah, feeling bit empty even sure I'm waiting excited ends. send articles like parents almost every week still try guilt trip going cousin’s wedding next week 😒 Definitely! dare you? contract miss x number days period ask proof. pull pandemic rotten though. Like read room, guys.

I'm sorry dealing put risk under-appreciated too. horrible. truly feel worst children forced go adults know better choose going risking relationship entire family... That's hard choice may risk die it.  Shame met any. 

I've worked sides fence sides crazies. Multiple hospitals GA diversion looking 800 miles transfer patients, live stayed date mess. TX made national news doctors pick gets hospitalized gets sent home either heal miracle likely pass. idea you’re talking shamed trying spread misinformation. Dude, money first able plan move immigration. people money hand even cover cost food shelter right now, makes think us afford move country? Australia announced (or officially announce) we've ordered 84.8 million doses (51m UQ/CSL locally researched vaccine 33.8m Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine). population 25m part deal sell extras countries cost (from I've read past they'll likely go south-east Asian countries).

Source: can't speak rural Canada, owned foreclosed 100 year old farm house .65 acres semi-rural Midwestern US $65,000. still 20 minutes civilization (depending definition, let's say home improvement store, Walmart, least 20 restaurants). I'd imagine could even cheaper somewhere truly rural. shitty place, cheap.  Everyone is. estimate actually infected people 10x reported number deaths 1.5x reported. numbers recent estimate model published epidemiology experts leading university. Can't remeber name. update get later. Serology surveys validating estimates somewhat, around world. Essentially, take number deaths use formula IFR 0.5%. means number deaths x 200 approx number infections, including asymptomatic cases. Reported cases (those seeing numbers) much lower. agreed. None social circle family longer kind social distancing, except handful us took seriously beginning: husband, epidemiologist cousin, chemistry major cousin mom (whose lab tech) literally ones still social distancing. Locally I've notices 2 weeks now, people around town stopped anything, except wearing mask grocery, even then, 1 3 without mask wearing nose. Americans mental fortitude capacity control significant length time.

As people grow less less cautious, feel urge cautious. go public without N95 mask, face shield goggles, disinfectant wipe hand, latex gloves pocket (just case) (I'm missing tyvek suit full gas mask point) really go even less April - May. spend maybe 2.5 hours week outside house, groceries 3 jogs week. things 7 am, avoid people. Even labor day prompts kind spikes saw 4th July, i'm feeling like people still go back trying self-execute lockdown, take precautions wearing mask forced to. Hospital admissions England 20% 7 day average last week. Zoe app also shows sharp rise past days. indicators calls 111 up. 


Evidence building rise cases real merely artefact increased testing. guess I've refreshing see second hump going back up. Incorrect nice try anyway. suggest look beyond self righteous acts "" rescued."" stated experience well I've encountered, via shows, working events, meet greets. Even adopted rescues adopt earth organizations, usually less judgy volunteers. 

Since want use large dogs example would know dogs apartments greatly depends many factors, breed, activity level, training, etc. well human diligence, lifestyle......, big houses/ big yards mean dog properly stimulated. Happens time family gets dog time want, actually got first dog. I'd rather person show dedication commitment pet ownership regardless social background, that's me. 

There good owners bad, problem rescues let bad ones greatly influence judgement people overall.  Right. point was, generally, likely see masks social distancing left leaning areas, see daily. That’s politicization I’m talking about, can’t even agree wear masks. I’m making statement PARTY support, I’m personally issues voter party voter anyway. point is, choose RESPOND become largely political issue left leaning areas higher mask usage, etc right leaning areas. world? Zero chance unfortunately.
Development, distribution funding issues aside, people wary rush job many reject it. Without adequate numbers, virus become endemic.
Perhaps exponential winter/increased reinfection rates might change minds. 
Or could mandate it. stuff already globe spanning empire. 

How make atrocities acceptable? Obviously apart Vietnam, Thailand... funeral directors overwhelmed bodies stacked u-haul trucks, parked outside....it frightening. 

But terrifying way rest country absorbed ignored horror movie set major American city became. I'm sending PM local realtors, I'll say right listed prices hilariously high. sold 1200 sq ft starter home last year $40k CAN, real win me. stuff listed site could easily go half asking.

Rural everyone, course. Hell lot cheaper, though. No. seeing flu virus. pump numbers?

We already high numbers don’t want ever again. depressed, affecting physically. whole body hurts. chest pain time. sweat more. 

I don’t know do. already taking SSRI. medication ever worked treat depression. that's I'm saying. I'm talking hypocrisy see. People preaching wearing masks social distancing completely disregarding precautions they're ""with friends"" ""with family"" households.  US government matter policy tries kill universal social good except police universal social goods poorly equipped issues intended fault elaborate still experiencing today far post Viral symptoms go? College place higher learning. facilitate partying. virus COULD mutate less deadly form. Humans could increasingly adaptive immune think. 

What call “magic” could lot biology don’t understand yet. There’s lots “dark matter” it’s negative. See that's problem though. I'm talking extremes here. I'm saying everyone completely isolate world, I'm socially distanced gatherings stuff like that. I'm talking flagrantly disregard basic safety precautions like wearing mask staying 6 feet apart they're ""among friend"" ""with family."" 

I'm huge advocate mental health agree can't shut people, humans social creatures, there's reason can't interact using proper precautions. people I'm referring not. I'm talking hypocrisy, specifically. Mexicans I've met beautiful, clean, hardworking 


I respect science. respect politics. Politics ruins science. ruin effectiveness safety vaccine. =  I’m confused think it’s impossible humans exactly things *just did* Germany South Korea. surprised - still see tons folks stores without masks. assume everyone upvoting didn’t read end. 

Banning no-fault divorce enable abusers removing agency women. 

I grew fundamentalist subculture, plenty young people around pressured parents church get married young ages. often semi-arranged marriages approved church couple’s parents. husband 23 21 got married, knew even younger. Almost everyone knew married kids 25. wanted leave religion, they’d probably get divorce. No-fault divorce godsend people - especially women - trapped lifestyle abuser. 

Yeah divorce rates low there, that’s necessarily good thing. kids grow seeing parents hate fight constantly, subject abuse can’t leave easily. state stay home orders? care muslims china? steady 1000 day past 6 weeks so... wife regret married you. clear piece shit. say race thing? Never. read wrote think problem bit more. Ohhhh...thiccovid... Rule34. Probably already done. keep good records there, part assume things much much worse official numbers show. you’re Rick daily testing nothing. boy makes child. Men take care them. 

* 67% AA men suck.
* 40% Hispanic men suck.
* 24% White men suck.
* 16% Asian men suck.

XX% women suck too. 

I personally deal one “loser African American father”. take care kid. polar opposite. set standard better. 

These people screw make us look bad. like Trump. Ugh. You’re right. feel gross.  measure stability? divorced? can’t tell many Indian middle eastern friends would basically disowned extended families divorced.

Richer people likely stay married simply broke / deadbeat / etc partner little value. one factor (income) handful determines much want married drops low, total value person partner drops, drop low enough they’re worth staying married to.

Let’s say prioritize 
* income
* weight
* facial beauty
* mothering qualities 
* cooking / cleaning

in wife. one decreases, it’s ok others strong. one drops almost zero? income drops zero, cooks, cleans, good mother, well, cover income part.

What man’s income drops zero? men aren’t high value caretakers infants don’t cook clean much. qualities low, low overcome lack income. Also consider woman isn’t rich, she’s going prioritize income quite bit, necessity cultural teaching.

Spouses together function team make life better, rather that’s purpose. partner isn’t that, likelihood divorce increases.

Back question money. money strong predictor marriage? couples many problems divorce money versatile way solve problems.

Need somewhere live? Money 
Need pay food? Money
Need fix car? Money
Need pay medical bills? Money 
Hate job, need months find another? Money
Child problems, needs tutor, doctor, whatever? Money

Money doesn’t solve problems, solves many problems solved it. problems longer problems money. spouse earns little, they’re still problems.

One last thing - working hard, best earn within realistic limits huge sign respect. don’t earn lot, bust ass making money, wife likely respect that. Here’s shit gets tricky. sit around, wife respect quick divorce since I’m literally nothing. work really hard make little? best js minimum wage? it’s tough. Initially may respect hard work, tell look around better job. don’t, lose respect. do, can’t better, eventually get angry. likely feel torn try hard yet cannot advance. many others position, likely stay married. sees men well, strong possibility leave.

Expectations teaching lot this, said before. conservative countries, everyone shame want avoid that. US, it’s like that. Yes, might financial poverty, that’s low social value. people know aware social standing strive protect it, even means lying everyone happy are, home life is, etc.

You ask yourself, staying married important you? agree, certified benefits, benefits come people pulling weight.

Here’s example. Let’s say you’re almost country world culture values man works hard. Income aside, visibly hard working man generally gets respect peers. Why? Well work respected providing family respected. let’s suppose work stops paying him. small company taken criminals. still work there? does, nobody knows he’s getting paid, he’ll still get respect peers, home life suffer lack income. Let’s assume works 14 hours day income 90% contribution house. wife hard working mother keeps house kids good order everyone loves does. cannot work full time job care kids. cannot care kids he’s working (even free). One option leave him. True, make money would married, doesn’t see contribute. That’s huge weight shoulders. Nobody likes freeloader. It’s possible remarry, maybe not. Let’s assume not. however, master house. men, even unemployed ones never allow woman “man house” make major decisions. would humiliate him.

Remember, people good bad traits. Without good qualities, bad ones noticed more. little reason put man doesn’t earn (assuming able to, ie didnt get injured fault own) men know tolerate woman doesn’t want take care baby.

Of course modern times switch things around, etc, get idea. Everyone expectations partner. course problem comes expectations differ expectations sex partner. someone would want sleep (and possibly child with) know would terrible spouse parent. well, you’re luck friend!  it’s reagent kit used PCR, stop going conspiracy holes

2017: Fucking man mods don’t remove pls that's stupid false equivalence though.
 
smoking, overeating, drug abuse, things think agree people situations would much like stop, unable to. Dumb people understand addition say idiotic things like, ""just stop heroin, dont heroin, stop too. difficult get groups.
 
Going vacation trip, though, completely voluntary conscious choice easily avoided.
 

poor example. stay home orders right now, mandatory Jenny Craig. 

Do understand different? became level 23 Spider-Man. still 2 days off... toxic YouTube now. absolutely must it, delete app use desktop only, hardly use way. grade morons / dickholes there. wouldn’t take precautions hotels? pumping gas? might idea long-lasting complications virus weren’t bad. remember Broadway star died get leg amputated? brain damage, blood clots, fatigue drags months, strokes, vision problems? You’re one lucky ones you’re dealing that.

People aren’t hearing enough consequences don’t die. still think it’s like flu, get you’re done. also helps created it, issued draconian lockdown country letting spread entire world downplaying threat. Maybe still spread it. nobody making political except you. Fuck you. Yeah ridiculous thing chance increase testing contact trace. I’m Dallas Fort Worth area numbers GOOD May. reopened numbers kept going wondering contact tracing happening kept opening.

I figure plan always plow vaccine🤷‍♂️ Yeah US universities exploit youth. knew would happen, I'm cynical enough US colleges may even put consideration thinking budget. trying get money economic downturn People really read headline. insurance company charged 10k person. obviously something happen, people commenting billed much lol think sat ate food... seems like disproportionate amount imported cases Phillipines. wonder nations also seeing doctor mentioned disgraced conspiracy theorist sharing crazy myths YouTube. statements thoroughly debunked. Yeah guy willing wear mask save life, way ever put condom are. Ot possible, proven, week ago (genetic sequencing two different strains time, residual infection). It’s really outlandish temperature check every building. live Vietnam get temperature checked every day work every time enter big supermarket shopping mall. see China even rigourous. daily choices lead tobeing obese? one bringing politics you. Fact avoidable, we’ll sure see impacts additional spread deaths. 

Further - die. It’s matter when. People die corona complications would lived longer fact. Yes no. Let's honest western world like China. type ruling way strict. USA easily abuse type government. look current administration. think anyone outside America thinks US ""greatest healthcare system world"". I've never met non American thought anything joke/an example really poor system (as far developed countries go). ""We criticize China US!!!""

Proceeds spend 99.9% time bashing China, brainstorming overthrow country, findings ways ""WE"" hurt Chinese.

Spends rest remaining 0.1% talking black lives matter saying something bad political party.

0% time calling sanctions brainstorming ways weaken country despite past present atrocities.

""We criticize China US!!!"" They've recently started make easier foreigners work China return, probably response that. people saying true, research:

No, ""do research"" mean used mean want mean anymore. literally cannot think instance last years someone said online ""do research"" meant anything ""I've got extreme point view cannot find article major source like Scientific American, CNN, Atlantic, New Times, Wall Street Journal, MSNBC anything sort backs up.""

When people say ""do research"" invariably mean: EITHER 1) look fringe Tinfoil Tommy's Blog source 2) look RAW DATA credible source way lead also draw whatever conclusion want too.

Look 6% fallacy saw last week. utterly nonstop flow mental sewage deniers camp saying ""see, told people die Covid, Covid even CDC admitted it! Checkmate doomers!"" would funny pathetic.

So, I'm gathering overall tone genuine desire ""enter lions den"" subreddit attempt rational discussion I'll go ahead offer one. Believe me, would absolutely thrilled hear new genuinely convincing whole situation overblown. genuinely want try convince anyone here, I'd suggest take two step test:

1) educated enough, honest enough, go record say (as perfect current example) CDC say Covid kills 6% people get it? simple ""can grasp comorbidity preexisting condition?"" test.

2) so, really think got insight ""irrationally terrified doomers"" failed grasp next challenge ""do research"" provide MAJOR SOURCES summarize support this.

When CNN MSNBC New York Times start putting detailed articles say ""Hey RightWingVisitor, enough statistical evidence kids x.00x% severe case Covid, x.000X% chance get MIS x.000x% chance fully recover"" serious conversation.

""Do research"" garbage suggestion today there's ONE major publication support argument. endless rabbit hole pseudo knowledge misinformed misinterpretation raw data (ala week's CDC 6% nonsense) provides ILLUSION insight.

So prove wrong. Journalism mostly dead right SOMEONE major source back up.

And, side note, right. taking personally. I'm going argue in-laws sound \*\*exactly\*\* like (for sake family peace) I'm taking opportunity unload months worth pent-up anger hearing ""iTs tEH fLu brah!"" you. Sorry. again, prove wrong. think getting nonsense facebook posts reaching incorrect conclusions raw data understand. [Another recently  similarly misleading. Garbage clickbait. Downvote sight.  1936, Literary Digest held massive, 2.27 million person poll president. predicted Roosevelt would get 43% vote. actually got 62%. Turns readers literary digest weren’t representative nation whole. were, average, wealthier average voter. addition sampling bias, non response bias. actually comes forward presses like button might different based kind views hold. instance, let’s say workplace new parking scheme.

Everything bigger Texas. available 10 dollars here. paying us apparently. one thread politicizing started way back 1980s least - health care US insane priced pocket.

In Moderna's high-dose human trials, 100% participants (of 45) experienced systemic side-effects. animal trials done ferrets, vaccine heightened immune response much experienced cytokine storms died exposed virus.  opinion, think years truly understand long term consequences. component missing right time. research virus itself, research people got it. We'll understand virus long understand bodies. We're scratching surface right now.

Yeah, think argument better. necessarily disagree media issue, slippery slope. we've seen, ""fake news"" shit people agree regardless facts. haven't, look Telecommunications act passed Bill Clinton. directly responsible situation find now. News longer provide community service considered ""entertainment"". mask opinion news. spain try like 2 months ago... result mid-August banned indoors outdoors... pretty much every building yeah. go get groceries you’d prob temp tested like 4 times get back home It’s lot easier dismiss anonymous troll saying crazy things relatives “friends”. Mods, please sticky add sidebar. hi-value resource. also dumb enough go sturgis pandemic basically like Reddit disconnect pro- anti-lockdowners terms what's happening Washington.

People assume opposed lockdowns necessarily aligned opposed giving aid well. anti-lockdown also anti-aid, that's another level evil, thats we're dealing Congress. However, we've got interesting scenario science really align either side. notice Fauci really calling restrictions point. He's always cautious, he's always acknowledged damage lockdowns do. gonna lie, scientists avoiding giving direct recommendations. They'll say restrictions good *for COVID*, beyond obvious (don't let grow exponentially), scientists mostly held back explicit recommendations, officially league dealing economics vs. epidemiology.

Here's diverge sub. I'm verified mods, list credentials explicitly, two doctorates relevant fields, I've unhappy response interpretation data response crafted around far.

I think evidence early that, aside places cases surging, never needed lockdowns. lockdowns, mean late March. pretty clear point long prevalence decently low virus controlled masks + testing + contact tracing + crowds + work home whenever possible + spot-check lockdowns areas larger outbreak.

We're still taking many precautions *don't* take shirking hard work (e.g. mass testing America, contact tracing programs, effective PPE everywhere).

Now we'd taken approach early on, dig hole start. Instead supporting nearly everyone start, could concentrated efforts people really business environment (e.g. bar owners, caterers, event planners, wedding organizers, etc...). would entirely non-controversial support people like woman continued unemployment benefits, would much, much smaller sum overall. always simply picked approach sustainable, leaving extra support especially vulnerable disease.

2. money, skip ahead line.. 

Both scanerios difference days months. Sometimes, I’ve read people dropping dead shift something sit thread bashing everyone taking thr pandemic seriously ignoring statistical models showing wrong ridiculous.

Bashing everyone? Look man, calling neglecting account time relevant factors involved confirming reinfection cases 'Bashing everyone', apologize anyone else offended... 

You understand 'statistical models' require data. not? one making claim reinfection rare. Yet requested data, provided faulty interpretation numbers (irrespective time available data).

I disagree agree India shit hole,but ""shithole"" grew personally love various reasons ones stated above. a-holes speaking US maybe schools. know area work way. cancelled big wedding basically eloped. Everyone told us reschedule September I'm glad didn't, think could go heartbreak cancelling second time. CDC counts death certificates, site notes ""Data period incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death."" 

Some data periodically updated, see numbers go following weeks. depends looking though. places use estimates update.

I agree excess deaths best measurement, delayed measurement. get good data recent weeks. ""I put number people claim care great risk, important thing me."" Good. Catholicism pedophile ring anyways. Took finally arrived sensible redditor! Thanks giving sensationalism, SsukhNine! Exactly, every time someone gets reinfected becomes headline. 10’s million infected, going robust immune response due countless factors. 

At point evidence suggest short turnaround reinfection poses legitimate risk majority population. say people previously infected try skirt masking social distancing guidelines. 

Data coming presence antibodies months infection robust B-cell T-cell responses good signs overall. Can't. answer question happened U.S. June. Cases rising deaths still falling. around early July is. Younger people far large getting first taking longer get older people now. Iceland's tease stupid Dutch government sat hands 4 months increase testing capacity. complain many people want tested without symptoms.

In meantime government annonced almost whole world orange zone.

And still say masks help. 

Un-fucking-believable.

It’s entirely possible nobody could gotten sick get away consequences, terrible outcome. People also seem think take precautions lower risk, like keeping seating distant other. (Even though think that’s really performative.)

I invited wedding October, mask optional website states number “safety precautions”. reality someone coronavirus wedding likely pass on; nobody it, everyone fine. I’m going attend think shouldn’t wedding, smart, educated people still think it’s reasonable wedding precautions, many many others going thoughts. Thank you! know. look many upvotes farmed saying that.

Despite multiple vaccines....possibly deployment within months. place quickly turning antivaxxer heaven now. 

First lockdown keep hospitals overwhelmed. lockdown till vaccine. it’s lockdown until....after vaccine? That's also entirely true. Compliance rules work home, see friends family, travel huge effective slowing spread.

Fundamentalist groups kind viewed cults. Potentially dangerous cults. Isn’t burning man people go random sex strangers? Might newsworthy infect other. literally instance CHINA, FEBRUARY. Along odd isolated “re-infection” cases pusses eager chalk false positives. guy original strain, L-cov (the one ass-fucked Italy), S-cov.


If “news”, fucking get better info. case emergency dont want doctors guessing wether start treatment flu corona  Dude I’m way high understand I'm hoping flu big deal masks distancing. don’t see catching second strain significance terms immunity. People get multiple strains viruses time. That’s hpv vaccine recommended already hpv positive, stop getting additional strains. That’s flu vaccine works sometimes, protects strains. worrisome means one vaccine may protect strains? aren’t days article come dismissing protests method transmission.

And actually read them? one claiming *no* cases transmission protests, saying data shows protests cause significant increase cases. Probably people catch covid protests. article saying didn't.

Further, links completely irrelevant. Contact tracing done purposes collecting data like that, locate new people advise get tested. That's ask live with, significant contact with, bars restaurants gone - lead people contact warn. Asking protest particular pointless. Either know people went (which would covered significant contact) alone, case... purpose information serve? contact tracers cannot look address protest get list people time credit cards receipts like could business. Knowing someone protest pretty much useless them.

Gee, someone studied transmission rates protests specifically using methods accurate self-reporting... oh wait did... It'll hard compare waves cases alone we're testing much today peak. dick might fall off. pastor exactly reason people want shut down, simply cannot trusted right thing. gnats? nothing changes, yes, obviously. confirm. 30 living home. Poor fuck. Wow. Social Justice magic. Why's that? Sorry exaggerated use word there. Glad pointed out.

But case still stands. China caused it’s fact. Ummm, why? also better US, UK, Spain, Italy Belgium. Interesting. friend Switzerland bitching lockdowns last spoke her. I’ll reach back  work know placebos.


Not 100% true. 94.8% true.

I pulled percentage ass. However, Placebos work even people know.

The know. ;) e^^x Oh man :(  Judge others much, sheeesh thought great idea. standardized education might good us too, granted legitimate education propaganda. Gj Sweden better *Peru*. like one wealthiest countries world anything We're Arkham City... yet. difference 3 ft 6 ft made US “almost worst world.” It’s failure politicians public health authorities clearly define articulate goals objectives. expert thinking muddled, reactions too. begins,  even accept help like that?

I'd take something nothing. remember heady days US looked Italy suffering badly hands Covid? six months ago? US learned nothing it. fact think ""free press"" lol

Just scroll subreddit beginning year. Yeah she’s always saying I’m like, Canadians then? answered question! Canada. would literally go anywhere USA healthcare too. vaccine stole research on? Reporting duty. They're used lol. claim 2.xM Uyghurs camps atm. 4 million now? stats even related?? One wedding spread across 9 counties? friends 9 different counties? you’ll still alive...  everyone generally wants “the perfect wedding” it’s showing off, Instagram, Facebook, etc. venues worth wedding tend booked quickly. people maintain bookings even without wedding simply they’re charged it. Think get engaged, split happens year leading wedding, venue paid refunds. 

I wish weddings you’re going spend life instead look drunk get see much paid centerpiece. completely agree. sister actually kept wedding date July.... Including pastor professional photographers, 10 guests. thinking? Get wedding way, we'll reception over. Woulda nice people there, gotta keep plugging away, trying smart. Uncle Jack go. Nobody does. Sure, let’s act like everyone kind nobility. general rule. feel bad options left with, risking lives wedding still selfish. way colleges behaving disgrace. They're morally bankrupt clearly interested $$$ anything. Weddings fucking boring anyway. seems like WANT double more. 

Do evidence double ?

We've 6 moths despite many claims massive numbers asymptomatic cases, antibodies studies far confirmed overly optimistic scenarios. whataboutism. wedding going crowded bar still selfish even people idiots too. Jesus. That's lot bikers. That's 1 thousand americans went strugis.

Anyway, couple weeks, expect probably, lot more, since symptoms surface 2-14 days exposure. 

I think might wrong baseline, since looking cases time US, versus new cases. apples apples would looking new cases 2 weeks 30 days, seem 17 42 per 10k, respectively. 

Still, looks like Sturgis might good health!

Presumably, answer testing. Bikers tough guys, less likely tested unless sufficiently serious, might plausible explanation difference. 

Or maybe came lower risk parts US. dare seek happiness joy! There's virus kills 0.04% population floating around! said ""shelter place weeks flatten curve"" meant cower fear rest life fucking bigot! Go r/COVID19 search immunity/herd immunity.

There’s lots evidence people immune virus, lots evidence around 20% sereoprevelance infections die (granted it’s HERD IMMUNITY per say infections eventually drop level off) Umm... There's ""real loss value"" cannot make payment loan write you. give line credit, cannot pay interest.

That's credit/capital could given someone else. Therefore right keep money.

At least consistent ideology! need organize zoom group chats people live alone. Yeah don’t even know understand need money survive . ass highlighting fact sometimes sell soul almighty dollar Yeah, come exact reason. selfish children bundled around house week after. don’t live world. hear stories glad peaceful meaningful life.  Yeah study abroad there. ever believe numbers. whole semester listening propaganda great healthcare was. tour guide told us lie us. worked hospitals find healthcare indeed BS I’m planning wedding right next year (hopefully things safer) don’t know people aren’t jumping extra time they’ve given. Planning stressful time make sure things good wedding want makes sense me. don’t get it, also, wedding post Covid biggest party ever! I’d rather wait everyone relaxed feel safe good time. It’s win/win can’t wait fucking idiots say “I got flu vaccine....got sick right it....the flu vaccine gave covid.” Exactly. want see bunch masks? Postpone wedding waaaaaay early relationship. 

""BUT WANNA GET MARRIED!""

So, marriage doomed, also exposing ""best friends,"" COVID, also blowing shitload money it, marry someone constantly fights with. friend mine wedding December, something tells gonna something like sincerely doubt they'll inforce masks... get that, sure loves you? Doesn’t seem like cares health, much she’s manipulating going threatening break you. Isnt long term organ damage associated contracting covid?

BUt caSE faTAliTy RaTE really understand people arent getting infectious stuff is. Even masks covid hyper infectious. point excuse stupidity that's much excuse anymore. cases, confirmed ministry health, also illegal immigration behind land border, Da Nang got second wave last month. control now, still rare cases popping every days quarantine areas. Still, we're going reach new case stage soon, I'll cautious, many others around me. Guess depends consider friends. do, would nice thing do. don’t care them, don’t 💯 safe. Hug NYC. can! wife got married backyard immediate family + grandparents, great. think altogether spent $500, mostly photographer. may something bigger decade anniversary/vow renewal something later life, blowing tens thousands dollars you’re starting lives together always seemed like terrible idea me. Plus, you’ve got family willing spend kind money you, payment much useful all, 35% them.

#notallamericans Good thing sheltered place month flatten curve give hospitals time build capacity.  schools reopening. Protests happening (I support they’re rarely mentioned comes spreading cases). Yet one wedding gets much attention blame spreading it. I’m sure allowed cherry pick what’s ok opened what’s not. Maybe lock month two actually lock down. 

However, couple others getting married consider holding huge ceremony moment goodness sake . Loss taste smell, coughing, fever common symptoms went wedding last month. tables properly spaced, everyone masks. one tested positive. stupid take proper precaution. Yep know highly educated medical professionals take seriously towards beginning, much careful. 

Then people less risk adverse playing odds. think there's also huge level denial, long game. epidemiologists really understood length time we'd dealing Covid got started. vast majority Americans thought things would back normal now, maybe fake til make it? GF, MD, went wedding weekend. noped weeks ago. Anyway, around bunch MD friends pre wedding event night tons folks wearing masks. fucking doctors.

Luckily I’m dating one those, stayed masked entire time. doctors can’t even follow shit. Stupid. Assholes. neighborhood? catching cases earlier testing actually don’t know death rate falling latest set surges, hasn’t long enough people start dying yet. link scientific articles it’s convenient you, many experts talked millions unconfirmed cases, pandemic started many people mild symptoms couldn’t get tested, thing happening right now, lot people get either don’t insurance pay test, don’t money pay get rejected cause don’t certain symptoms. real number cases even said 10-20x even amount confirmed cases. hit hard first wave India officially surpassed Brasil 2nd place, late start compared rest world.

India hit first million July 16, whereas USA hit first million April 27th. mine. fall slow walk bullshit friends. Nothing changed, none normal. Despite car commercials say, stay wait science - literally least do. horrifying rearranged June year July next year.

Reddit made many people believe it’s right wing “muh freedum” crowd. don’t know number infected though? people get tested doesn’t account millions minor cases/ asymptomatic didn’t get tested people like dad brother didn’t get tested sister positive locked house sick possibly infect others going urgent care test. friend family presumed positive doctor testing wildly available. people don’t care enough believe virus hoax. millions countries testing inaccurate widely available. false negative, rate false negative still 40% places US. people aren’t considered likely well millions. CFR number anyone going of. situation  Yeah... I've known almost 15 years steadily gotten worse worse. Unfortunately, people surrounds people say COVID thing went bars parties entire lockdown. gonna around long stupidity. idiots would get married pandemic. what's point then? vaccine exactly close hand perfect. stay closed forever? know three suicides people actually knew relatively small city since lockdown. know one ill COVID...I know plenty mild cases. Congratulations! think caring others manner right way begin next chapter love story. Oh sounds perfect! also thought wanted big wedding started working them. covid hit realized perfect chance elope.

It’s perfect families religious don’t drink (in front other) friends wild. huge wedding didn’t make sense anyway! protests got OK happened far back April, LA outdoor stuff opened before, May, many protesters, encouraging us comply lot closures, went parks closed, it’s like enforced harshly, compared marching June went. gas grenades rubber bullets homeless people shelter place. whole pandemic joke brother's wedding scheduled next weekend. month ago, got nice ""change date"" card mail; he's postponing September next year. I'm sure sucks delay, definitely better family members refuse show (depending venue, debating going) worse, get people sick. someone supposed getting married end year postponing, may true people (I friend bridesmaid 400 person wedding end July right everything really bad, everything indoors even though GOLF COURSE outdoor weddings “classless” course masks required “they look bad photos” people really selfish, lot people (me included) much worried getting loved ones sick inducing much stress onto last thing want (besides give covid) make anyone feel uncomfortable anxious attending wedding like choose attending health. maybe they're decent, reasonable people? Ain't goddamn truth? so? seems crazy Yeah, Hallmark card stamp :-P

Throw $20 bill feeling flush would think I'm saying india special? said india third world country, MAJORITY across world.

I'm making excuses, I'm telling point view. sitting another country labeling India's lockdown failed, true. I'm telling failed, ground reality is, experience. 

I said first post, seemed genuinely interested finding going on. 

Also, probably quit saying indians making excuses unwilling learn countries. Trust me, many unhappy handling know could've done better.

Dont forget 3 deaths well. big deal. obvious spend 0.2 seconds thinking typed out. turns playing Russian Roulette children isn’t fun almost lose.  Rest America...it’s less dangerous flu kids. explains it. acting like rescheduled events free rein new dates. case all. still 0 dates that's current pandemic business safe run. Similarly millions people lost jobs without recourse, businesses can't adapt/weather unforseen downturn go too. That's excuse shitty people also shitty situation. unconfirmed cases

Why hundreds billions unconfirmed cases, pull numbers ass ? Something something man flooded city yes, clear hindsight could've left outdoors stuff open.

You're acting like reasonably foreseeable woods activity safe human human respiratory infectious disease transmission. was. People worked hysterical panic overreacted way even justified time. Poverty Covid-19: Rates Incidence Deaths United States First 10 Weeks Doesn’t make less true tho. possibility reinfection viruses, varying levels frequency. Every case possible Covid reinfection reported blown proportion massive public interest. reported every disease known man way currently report Covid-19, news outlets would overwhelmed within minutes.  *People damn selfish brain washed*

Have met people? Seriously, people like this. It’s rare find selfless, rational, objective mind. Exactly. People short sighted narrow minded. consider consequences past want particular moment definitely agree points. venues getting compensation postponed events. bureaucracy absolutely standing way. 
 
But point venues still losing money, even assistance. postpone wedding year, haven’t lost income, they’ve prevented booking different wedding.  venues charging big rescheduling fees try combat loss income. couples forced decide going forward risking lives postponing high cost hassle. it’s venues availability, it’s family’s, photographer’s, DJ’s, caterer’s, etc...

I don’t know correct answer is, except provide financial relief event venues... FACT: FL, GA, TX hospitals never got overwhelmed governors never complained like NY, CA, governors still managed take care elderly implementing serious lockdowns. allowed this?!   cousins people comfortable looking deformed, inbred features.... I’ll keep looking. It’s four years since read it.

Yeah moms house built late 1700’s looks gorgeous. amazing us became perfect venue since got set wanted. It’s almost kicked started new account, risking permanent ban. dare disrupt circle jerk!! Don’t know there’s election coming up? Protesting rights essential. Weddings optional. got married house dad took everyone (20 people) dinner. perfect. 

This years covid, nothing virus. hate center attention, hate weddings, despise wearing dresses. idea huge, fancy wedding appealing root canal. Motherfucker, man...  want act ppl 30’s hasn’t died this? What's PCR? “Nobody wants guinea pig” Person low effort troll unironically uses term ""sheep"". going able reason them.

Everyone screw everyone else make much money possible - keep consuming, always needing bigger bigger house, luxury cars etc...at end day what? Money. Homes. Cars. Material things. Nothing matters end day die. come grave. People won’t socially isolate forever.  reason another lockdown. People won’t stand mountain PPE waste nothing. I’m genuinely disappointed youth today. SMH.  don’t 2,279 years wait. Oxford researchers want test vaccine side effects, also works. see works, create groups: one group give vaccine, control group gets placebo. vaccine works vaccinated group fewer people get ill. problem UK, start trial, Covid-19 way disappearance, outcome might neither groups anyone got Covid-10... given information. best test vaccine place lost people get infected, Brazil. Exactly right, sir! worse, HUMAN GOVERNMENT Earth recommending population reduce eliminate co-morbidities. 

Weight, diabetes control, blood pressure reduced severity. Weight absolutely controlled following eating guidelines (9g sugar per day many guidelines) moderate excersise.

Go ahead google it. I'm right. recommendations doctor lose weight ELIMINATE COVID risk due overweight thus changing risk level!

This cull. Doctors/CDC/NIH simply care?

It's masks, masks, distance, wash hands. Nothing worldwide.

I took COVID seriously eliminated 100% processed foods. 95%, full 100%. Healthy fats, grains, meat cooked home.

Did one talking head Earth say above? google something, please post. mean false? welcome! I'm glad helped! Pretty much everyone got polio around time vaccine came out,

[No lol, wrong immediate prevaccine era, improved sanitation allowed less frequent exposure increased age primary infection. Boosting immunity natural exposure became infrequent number susceptible persons accumulated, ultimately resulting occurrence epidemics, 13,000 20,000 paralytic cases reported annually.


Turns 19 year olds reading less talking things know little abut. Taking measures herd immunity mutually exclusive.

In fact herd immunity really reaching immunity rates disease stops spreading given existing societal structure

 getting better here.

Correct I'm wrong Sweden's set measures changed substantially since April. Yet disease spreading spreading started subsiding new measures. changed? obvious variable overall infection rate. One side saying super dangerous because--like every political decision made country past 20 years--they side heavy lifting.

In words, one side *wants* say pretty dangerous need take precautions, **other** side laughing mocking them, treating entire thing like total joke, first, sane side needs escalate rhetoric, order make sure waffly people middle appreciate true danger. Otherwise problem get swayed slack-jawed imbeciles. feel people weddings scheduled last year, takes huge lack empathy 250 people agree this. good idea, maybe welcome culture people bringing lap blanket keep warm intend eating outside. common Scandinavian countries. (Fancy restaurants usually basket blankets available outdoor diners, probably bad idea risk virus transmission.) Definitely research paper, article summarizing research paper would better source. law firm active lawsuit strong financial incentives show one side story.

The important thing is: vaccine treatment cause injury statistically significantly lower rate disease trying protect against? I'd expect scientific paper show well. point, since USA take right precautions, matter. either quarantine day 1 day whenever zero cases, quarantine all. Corona rampant point wearing mask redundant. let virus go extinct own.  Why, connection testing seeing cases?

(O.P. short term compensation though.) Ok science denier get he's saying, really patient try rush things unsafe vaccines. here. similar situation. i’m bridesmaid wedding november. event 25 people including employees outside talk week tell i’m comfortable unless boundaries met. basically wear mask entire time maintain social distancing. also leave time. i’m legit worried panic attack middle ceremony passing out. Link source says 5% death rate....... it’s high.

I love people play safe. entire thing bunch unknowns still PEOPLE PLAY SAFE. don’t spout stupid statistics reputable backing. Anybody spouting statistics right argument lose respect anybody knack read actual articles.

If notice part name titles support agenda information different article top that, amount revisions data happened make information questionable. Every bodies statistics bad, safe, people start dropping left right, freak out, justify risk. sucks, everybody right, it’s fact matter. people can’t survive without working, people can’t survive without bunch different things value safety differently. Respect opinions actual facts proven accurate true.

Some people overblowing it, people underplaying it. Can’t anything except make decision open revision new accurate information arises.  Yeah, fuck people, amirite? cares die? Buncha cry babies. 

But no, still correlate outpacing WW2 300%. ironic doubt significant part population calling WW2 fake news time, saying blown proportion.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Might sound selfish, think start groups spend most, help economy recover faster. polls aren’t closed, one saying it’s okay, it’s allowing voters miss crowd want minimize contact. one disingenuous arguments I’ve ever seen.  Let’s generous say 1% Americans participated protests, 40% vote election. 1% mass congregated , 40% country forced to? ridiculous. gave 3 examples pandemic whose origins hard define, AIDS one these. Sure pandemic different Covid-19, yet similarities.

And keep ignoring waste water analyzes discussed above, even genomic lineage (that guess even took look at). want believing want believe despite factual data above, nothing left discuss. Yay Europe seems way big increase cases. Thank kind ocelot! again, you’re putting words mouth. choosing wear mask, socially distance, etc, sacrificing freedoms, I’m choosing accord. 

It’s bad find us entitled, we’re also generous. 

You’re right many fellow Americans living bubbles. Partially blame foreign propaganda, sponsored likes China Russia, part blame media companies owned Murdoch.

It’s one year. figure things normal then. not, we’ll head courthouse. think we're reaching point people like ""I'd rather roll dice life others lives instead living isolated everyone."" 5% death rate  seems obvious top-level comments thread. Thanks sharing! must incredibly tough. don’t mind sharing, fall out? Right, everything deemed life sustaining. Source people got tickets driving? Big shoutout Grand forks herald really don’t get keeps popping downplay response basically every single comment, even saying things like “it’ll totally normal Christmas” like fuck. certainly hit hard begin seems lagging behind European countries weeks.

Wow, bravo! truth is, guest invited wedding choice, weddings making headlines safe practices place are.  Stop shaming people trying adapt never-ending conditions.  Postpone? Postpone when? That's easy say since planning wedding (or maybe already one) Shame enforce safe practices....and fucks sake, stop acting like internet martyr go Wal-Mart Publix, around friends family passed 6 months.  Yes, i'm getting married end October, yes everyone wear masks ceremony outside, far less people, spent fuckin fortune make sure everyone cute little personalized hand sanitizer bottles, mask, better social distancing practices.  end day, want everyone feel safe possible, means they're going watch ""zoom"" broadcast, that's fine us.  personal responsibility thing, I'm forcing there, i'm forcing wear mask. obvious barely thought difference motorcycle rally Sturgis compared BLM protest. sure, keep fucking chicken. High infection rates good candidates vaccine effectiveness testing Thank Please give example one each, please.

Edit: downvotes OP straw-man arguments. herp, derp. Interesting! thought UK also tough situation? Thanks explaining Rising adding cases deaths total.

If haven’t totally stopped infections geography, per definition rise. 

Sorry bit unclear. That'a dangerous thing ever forget, especially since U.S. Christians literally adopted White Supremacy core belief system. Hahaha ha love it. mean north Sonora chilin idk south Sonora tho could OP reading arguments they’ve general unhappiness. People jumping “omg issued ultimatum?!?!” *exactly* I’m talking about. might that...or might number things aren’t single dramatic option. Could ELI5? I’m trying explain someone don’t think I’m wording well. based ocular experience living travelling countries would guess lot Swedish obesity within fat range (BMI 30-35) US saw people extreme obesity normal everyday mobility issue. rarely ever see Sweden. handful reports last weeks. Actual rare medical occurrences don’t pop frequently. that’s even taking account people COVID reinfection would never able confirm never got test first time. Grandma would wanted die public show love. 

Plus needed inheritance catch bills. think kind depends employer. 2 level 1 trauma hospitals city 1 mandates yearly flu shot not. City police fire require one half ambulance companies do. understand trying communicate comparison. comparing total economic loss EU total loss Sweden, contained within EU?

The entire loss Sweden 0.27% total loss point using percentages compare relative impact. never minimized economic harm pandemic caused.

No, usining percentages technique mask numerical truth. Low-level analysis uses percentages without providing full data. use percentages affect/mask perception EU economy 2,100% large Sweden's. relative comparisons helpful.

No. not. include entire breakdown affect shutdowns EU economy? contraction nations significantly higher Sweden's.

The perception Sweden anything; so, source trying muddy waters say Sweden fact, using method could probably show Sweden far worse Denmark (because GDP latter bit less twice large former)

While EU countries significantly worse. lack data source country-by-country impact COVID-19 makes data less reliable. Soooo many future Epidemiologist dissertations/papers.

Thanks dumb people! here, part. still can’t bring go back gym (lol) honestly I’m ready sit bar go movie. made plans exactly last night months going anywhere parents threw fit lost chance (asked babysit kids) even isolated week kids one night out. planned parents would exposed quality time grandkids... completely understand concern fear going hardest part get lot people. can’t wait over. Found uneducated person. God middle Americans fucking stupid Or... or... government invokes ""act god"" clause allowing wedding deposits returned.

Lets keep blaming wedding guests, wedding venue ignore real culprit, inept government. 16% also pretty insane consider 11% less 10 years ago. entire world trending rapidly wrong direction. pretty wild watch street scenes [like early 20th century seeing anyone looks shape. wonder time traveler back would see us sort like see people wall-e? family wear mask, vaccine unless proven safe! April 2014, 170 million doses Gardasil distributed worldwide. vaccine tested thousands females (ages 9 26). Food Drug Administration (FDA) Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) consider vaccine safe.... vaccine mostly minor side effects, pain around injection area. ... General side effects shot may include joint muscle pain, fatigue, physical weakness general malaise.

Wear mask. live NYC traveled 40 states America.

A key difference, Gandhi noted, Argentinian ship, surgical masks issued passengers N95 masks staff soon first passenger became sick."" LPT: try incognito mode No, ‘literally’ didn’t threaten that. ‘literally’ assumption. 

If openly threaten yeah, I’d agree good person, that’s comment said. says OP thinks she’s considering it, could mean threaten it..or could mean OP reading arguments/general unhappiness. full people understand value enough respect leave someone treats like disposable.

Those people obviously exist here, experience far outnumbered smarmy, holier-than-thou people absolutely *love* oversimplifying issues taking wild, inflexible positions them.  Unprecedented times call unprecedented measures. Yep, GF's plan if/when happens fly UK, get married castle, send everyone postcard let know happened. area closed parking lots really cracked people weren’t excercising/walking assholes used shutdown excuse go party beaches parks. took access away us didn’t manpower break parties beaches Also mention contributes extended lockdown also bad business.

It's like there's bunch people trying run store fire. Put fire start serving customers ffs  matter time US longer great, mean first.... 

India going lot worse. Theit medical system lot worse. N95 masks all! better way celebrate merging two families killing members? 

I'm completely torn--is better analogy Red Wedding wedding Khal? Less three deaths considered dull affair! Yup Since lie southern Minnesota I'm surprised. 

[There also idiots can't stop happening? 
It's unlikely go away. vaccine prevent infection. one knows organ damage still happen vaccines. Might well hope healthy people deal relatively well get (and become immune) infect vulnerable people. sucks one stay completely shielded it. hope seriously consider giving essential workers equal priority. doubt frontline workers among first well. essential workers among highest risk infection well, even healthy least likely get severe symptoms, can’t account spread asymptomatic period. deserve show work protection family interacting keeping afloat population people opportunity stay home. wife insanely careful. switch half-mask respirators P100 filters N-95 masks depending situation. go grocery store work. socialize family isolated stay outside distance masks except eating/drinking. wife tested positive yesterday, symptom slightly nauseous 5 days. think got work wearing N-95 coworker pulled mask talk her. Unless policies change much hope people US get next 6 months unless isolate completely really lucky. Ok, tell us families, loved ones, friends willing sacrifice? one 70k deaths person family.

This serious. Wear ppe, social distance, respect dead.  4.5k infected 90k ?

Also healthcare quality India France many poor Indian people cannot afford work . see. scary rejected request despite high-risk, still nice werent making hard get tested via walk-in. get call demand testing, since that's is. Honest question, why? way quickly moved field trials markets? Wow. Sorry, understand kind thinking. far detached way people live lives America, cannot fathom lot things Americans accept everyday life. Wow, I'm really pleased told beginning masks useless. common sense respiratory pathogen spread air.. Yeah live brother now-wife, got front row seat trying reason handle everything. lot stress sure happy able make situation. Charge murder Great, I'd love hear thoughts this. What's wrong Sweden? didnt... also forgot weeks ago villianizing Sweden shutting down, mandating masks, closing businesses, claimed hundreds thousands die reckless. 

People Sweden went worst it.. contraction rate entirely fallen new death rate non-existent. Oh wow must reason anyone ever! saw once!

Such edge. cool. still fix this. need government step Sounds like didnt read article, went profile defense mechanism strawman arguments. Easy win. big wedding complete sham anyways, relatively new thing. heavily normalized drop tens thousands dollars wedding, makes fucking sense. Also ironic divorce rate higher extravagant weddings became normalized, spending wedding likely might I'll concerned anybody dies it.

Odds *remarkably* low nobody will.  Also-weddings okay mass protests are? Sure. What’s difference eloping wedding celebration regular wedding? Sorry sounds dumb, single mom real dad never real wedding experience story german news? criticism weird. I’m sure linked story subreddit guests wouldnt get different treatment comments. think biggest plague hypocrisy, gossip. going list, there's Covid-19. important order right. One wedding, fools, everyone knows rules.  nobody fucking wears that's government ever given us.

If that's true, pretty sad. I'm saying great, times hard everywhere, definitely safety nets place. Say democratic socialism, I'd rather give bit freedoms, pay higher taxes something fall onto times get hard. Guess lost bet, then. I'm opinion recent times, expectation graduates immediately find housing harm good, shame family units moving back together pool resources. know personal finances would much stronger position done that. sounds super reasonable. I’m glad could event, even different planned! frankly don’t get it. would never forgive loved ones got sick died wedding. You’d complete sociopath feel sense responsibility shame putting called “loved ones” harms way material part getting married. would forever taint supposed celebration. one going say, “remember Joe Mary’s wedding? Wasn’t lovey?” response would “oh yeah! one x people Covid people died.” Don’t act like idea rare going be. data rapidly waning antibody titers suggests probably going rare. 

(Before start replying comments cells, I’m viral immunologist. I’m well aware immune memory works). trust concern long term hidden effects. Yeah I've seen people spell way want spell bad word result lazy database administrators reusing code rather generating new code.

In relational database would something like following:

  Table: Classifications
  Field: Code
  Field: Description
  
  Table: Exports
  Field: Code
  Field: Date
  Field: Value

The first table might data like:

  01, Dohickeys
  02, Whachamacallits

And second table like this

  01, 2020-2-13, 1200.22
  01, 2020-2-13, 1156.35
  02, 2020-1-30, 56.75

The final display would look something like:

  Dohickeys, February 13 2020, $1200.22
  Dohickeys, February 13 2020, $1156.35
  Whachamacallits, January 30 2020, $56.75

What happening data displayed, Description linked Code displayed rather code itself. Databases designed way Description might long repeated Table Exports every instance code would take huge amount space redundant data.

What means is, Table Classifications changed ""01, Dohickeys"" becomes ""01, Thingamabobs"". display Table Exports change to:

  Thingamabobs, February 13 2020, $1200.22
  Thingamabobs, February 13 2020, $1156.35
  Whachamacallits, January 30 2020, $56.75

Even though Table Exports changed, underlying Code still ""01"", description ""01"" changed related tables display new Description, even old records.

That poor practice change Description related table primary table still contains data linked old Description.

What done add new code like this:

  01, Dohickeys
  02, Whachamacallits
  03, Thingamabobs

That way new records could use new code, old records remained unchanged still displayed correct Description. can't reply original comment happy cake day! mom's going economy. Dead people dont buy things!  mean comment said girlfriend thinking breaking him...so gfs logic dump ❤️ willing sacrifice freedom temporary security, deserve neither. 

Obviously I’d rather fellow countrymen choose wear masks, take precautions. recognize it’s place direct them, it’s place dictate actions either.

If plague comes around every 100 years people act dumb, that’s price pay 99 years freedom. I’ll take deal day. Look keyboard look typo champ. 

Get back questions lil guy. Curiosity here. death rate USA low (relatively) late? course low all...but considering link obesity higher risk death covid, I'd expected death rate states much, much higher last month so. anyone explain why? younger people may obese fight better? treatments better US hitting 2k day? change fact try avoid possible.

If isolated, much less likely to. Wearing mask taking care also statistically reduce severity.

Instead spreading gloom, might well let people know *can* do.  Eh think lot sheer stupidity.

What said definitely true, needs inherent underlying level idiocy even come close failing misinformation. It’s EASILY disproven, unable use even hint critical thinking fall it.

I would definitely hate hold grudges towards family members supported orange reality tv star this, never see again.

You claim ex supporter feel bad choices, literally never claim absolute idiot, rest life. fell OBVIOUS political manipulation, supported failed businessman turned reality tv star lord savior, chose believe tv “personality” actual doctors.

Don’t hate them, don’t trust anything requires smallest amount critical thinking ever again. straight proven ability so, argue anything else would straight ludicrous.

It’s easy hate system, lament fact “brainwashed” relative. remember, pretty god damn stupid fall brainwashing, it’s exactly valid excuse... yes, absolutely part vote! case isolated cold storage worker, health officials said don’t think imported cold storage goods person person transfer unknown person. can’t fin exact article read close Health experts say outbreak likely occurred result border control failure, customs official airline worker coming contact infected traveler. even better ""remember everyone got covid recovered? people died result maine wedding weeks ago, none actually attended  point everyone throws fit schools weddings should. agree many people places can’t handle physical distancing helping cause, comes protest nobody seems bat eye.

This tremendously bad news lot decisions. الحمدلله Effective effective two different things. I'm idea going strange arms race everyone creating solution, collaboration. even going scalable yet population vaccine found. Various governments working towards preparing vaccine last heard we're still far behind manufacturing facilities ready. fear maybe another year likely due issues. That's daunting lot people considering long year felt. Great news. Children safer.  cousin’s daughter headed college today. freshman Ivy League school checked college reporting 8 cases. rules place student gets dropped dorms allowed bring carry. parents cannot go cannot leave car. must isolate dorm two days. tested. next 12 days controlled activities two tests. long tests negative free pleases campus fourteen days. 

Interestingly classes next semester online completed dorm. offer remote learning home. 

If things go badly next two weeks students sent home parents drive 13 hours back get her.  I've never really gotten people object strongly ""putting lives hold"". That's kind happens times major crisis, probably biggest international threat occurred lifetime. People act like right normal lives; think people around today lived good times long can't even understand deal serious adversity. many people, that’s long wait. many African countries, starvation poverty becoming inexcusably poor result us locking destroying economy. Families lower end socioeconomic ladder western countries losing everything, poverty become health problem it’s bad. scales tipped favor corporations ultra rich ever before. can’t wait long, I’d argue actually know ton media keeps misreporting it.

I know telecommunications act. maintain, something important, would urge approach articles constant sketicism me. identify misinformation yourself. keep verifying. think slippery slope worry opposite direction; trusting *any* news source, idea they’re lying. point, none telling full truth, like said. ""Its rare, dont worry."" ""Its true need cases confirmed""  /reddit. two entirely different situations produce different results?! I’ve never wedding possible virus infection spill jail. one hand, found funny, other, fact quotes ever said president first place pretty depressing.

$30! Extra $5 goes long way. I'm going make bold claim post.

You're male 25 never wedding parents make go to. We’ll see goes, she’s also willing break quarantine rules (we live NY, we’d need quarantine 2 weeks) can’t get time long. 

She’s sacrificed lot me, like leaving families friends NY job IN, I’d feel pathetic leaving argument wedding. 

Appreciate everyone’s input though, genuinely. Philippines guess online. (Priest/Judge) groom wife parents present. paper supports that? block subreddit? fear mongering bullshit exhausting. Yeah directly fact they're democracy worry human rights.

I'm saying effort bad. better NZ's, western countries work amongst framework human rights democracy freedom press/ able trust numbers reasonably can't really compare China Vietnam western nations. screw wedding... take money get refunded go JOP... don’t subject closest friends family getting sick... seriously. i'm charge contracts get hired assist yes would get refund many deaths? proof actually work? States counties mask mandates still horribly far case counts. I’m covid bride- got married courthouse style! used covid excuse really couldn’t imagine asking people make decision banks allowed value things saw fit. rating agencies. banks made good trade, exploiting human nature make money.

They probably break laws somewhere... part, followed law profited wildly it. Many without bailout money whatsoever. Sure couple got caught bind, ones misplayed hands.

So glad support that.

And glad GenZ millenials gonna tearing whole motherfucker soon enough... Tick tock. Tick tock. schools ventilation? Maybe ask people test positive they've previous couple weeks. Americans. I'm Hungarian, people shit here. :( Don’t. mace make cough spread virus. That's absurd. friends' weddings cancelled summer, they've pushed summer fall 2021. I've never excited turn wedding invites life! Damn!!!! shit terrifying. 

I use think people motorcycles bad ass. Now, seem super selfish turds respect. care spread shit, they're tough want, want.

Because seems mutated become less deadly.

You'd worry lot 10-100 times deadly. shitty situation, isn’t shitty so-to-speak wedding vendor abiding terms agreement. I’m wedding photographer contracts always listed stipulations would refund portion deposit. deposit place protect vendor’s income. said, take relatively small deposit would certainly rather refund COVID face potential social media backlash. shady anti-AMLO propaganda based taking things said quoting them. Damn that's rough. think religious person would take 180,000+ deaths clear sign God. 

But I'm religious like so...what know? dancing? Tables people like households? Nobody traveled state? Probably fine still measured risk. used industry. Offering help always good idea know got money couple never getting back. Oh venue available day I'm already booked on? Wow I'm sorry please let know help...and I'm keeping money lol.

Again, vendors fault, eat too. absolutely brutal industry. God: sent fucking pandemic, want? Oh course have. hasn’t always taken 2-3 years get venue wedding large city. It’s going get worse well. yeah. generally thought 0.5%.

This either wishful thinking number picked try keep people calm. case fatality rate ignores people mild cases symptoms, get tested nobody catches, looks confirmed cases

Europe testing pretty thoroughly, including contact tracing such, still CFR high. can't claim Europe 10 times cases caught. mean, claim whatever want, would idiotic. fork? Clearly important thing getting sent jail quarantine.  recall correctly, Finland weeks behind Sweden initial wave infections, part Sweden winter holiday lot people getting sick Alps bringing back home. Americans stupid ? Don’t go. Send gift. gift masks. 2070.

They’ll probably fine. It’s matter risk others. people aren’t stupid normal sense word. GOP problem solve itself. I’d back honor bridesmaid, honest. lie like rug Sorry dont speak poor Surely $560 fines punishment enough. feel this. I’m constantly asshole family right now, wanting go large events, restaurants, celebrations. That’s May. Instead spending $10K+ wedding, spent $25 filing courthouse used $10K put aside wedding part payment house. wedding us dropping little dropbox downtown. I’m going go with, made right choice. social distancing lockdowns _(from July onward)_ waste time hurt economy. Gov. Tim Walz state officials Thursday, Sept. 3, pointed rise since July case positivity rate — 4.3% 5.5% — continued appeal residents exercise caution social gatherings, especially coming holiday weekend.

I guess protestors nothing this? comes next wave blame Labor Day weekend protestors fly radar everyone chicken shit say something Cue “lockdowns don’t work crowd”.  Oh, wait, that’s right, US isn’t lockdown fucking idiots.  Half us running around like uneducated fucking morons wearing masks pretending like pandemic. There’s also still lot anti lockdown protests, anti mask protests, there’s even pro police state rallies, guess wether protests wearing masks. also churches protest closures holding services defiance. Indoors, maskless, yes protests spread virus. deposits refunded don’t go it? not, likely explains least it... [HomerSimpsonpat.jpg] would signed contract agreeing obey COVID rules penalty forfeiture tuition payments? mean, still get married today enjoy legal tax insurance benefits protections immediately. don’t sympathy someone decides invite people claim care world risk health based solely PREFERENCE wedding _ceremony_ *right now*. GF selfish asshole. would attend wedding ask partner attend even health problems. one? 56 recover fully probably learn exact wrong lesson 56 people Facebook telling us ""see! big deal, TOLD big overblown hoax"" send person attendance $5000 fine. Apparently they're afraid jail hammer pocketbook exactly right thing do. Congrats early way! Definitely sounds like it, far. Congrats going school responsible admin, staff, students. Apparently it’s outlier. definitely make flu shots free encourage poor people take them. work office. pretty good distancing, that's place go to. Honestly co-workers piss - like one going wedding weekend - stuff like makes anxious. reality tens thousands people, called long Covid long haul Covid survivors, suffering months line infection taken consideration approach disease cannot operate presumption put forth long people don’t die doesn’t matter contract virus.

And yes, friend nurse, like thousands healthcare providers contracted disease workplace. “maybe it’s something else” denial game really offensive. insidious virus impacts body hundred different ways, even people thought asymptomatic found heart damage fact. matters, especially economic crash left millions without health insurance. People need aware nitty gritty reality act like matters, them, people might pass virus behave appropriately. 40% deaths nursing homes staff.

Aside elderly, deadly virus. Demographics matter. 2 250+ weddings 0 Covid cases ""horror stories"" consist screening test 1 anecdote. probably read screening test website 1 particular rescue, bothered go rigors. That's fine, *are* lenient rescues. There's also pound. 


If trying adopt large dog anyone cares animals, though-- whether rescue org reputable breeder-- probably happy allowing large dog stuffed apartment. People lazy; backyard, there's higher chance dog get least *some* exercise. Toy breeds okay smaller homes, still need let regularly washroom breaks. work long hours, probably better get couple cats. guys think Pakistan may face 2nd wave soon? agree going another lockdown possibly major food shortages. Yeah dunno, think pretty successful Sweden. I've able go gym every week year, apart skipping weeks Mars, April wait bit. I've able take summer vacation fly within Sweden tourist destinations meet relatives, wear stupid masks (except 2h flight) weeks see single person wearing mask. 

People act normal really cared virus many months now, one person family caught fever little taste 1.5 weeks. 

Definitely seems like success me. Ah yes, Georgia killed nursing home residents per capita resident 

And kill thousands general population unnecessarily Switzerland Restaurants wool blankets outdoor seating. cancer survivor asthma pneumonia scarred lungs.Part endocrine system missing. contract disease good chance I’m making it. course not. I’m moron. 

However, person replied said “the chances dying 0-39 year old low”.

You said “false”.

So implies think chances high demographic.  understanding this??? She’s worried coworkers wedding health? 

You clearly smart person recognizes potential danger event. 

So easily overlooking lack concern well-being? Hmm. confirm weren’t backed patties lot people hanging kitchen? Somehow think CNN's photo choice enabling people private gatherings without precautions. Maybe something massive disinformation denying severity pandemic conservatives? far daycare costs. course, free daycare, free high schools. 100% Woodstock cancelled.

I never cease amazed basement dwelling shit read website. entire university degree cost bit 24,000 four years (I know amount since paid money/scholarships) 1980's

Two points:
1. $24,000 1985 equivalent $58,000 today. 
2. going state school, especially several decades ago, tuition probably paid 1/4-1/3 cost education, rest coming various governmental sources. withdraw child get kicked claim mental health. literally making numbers fit fan fiction. shameless. It’s really difficult socially-distanced wedding lol. cousin fiancé got married July Northern California. 30 guests invited 200ish original guests. wedding outdoors easier social distance. *Everyone* wore masks. Everyone’s temperature taken entered. Chairs set six feet apart. times came close contact ate took big group pictures.

This isn’t black white thing. It’s “have wedding sit front computer Zoom.” family wedding. *responsibly*. long follow social distancing protocols you’ll fine. Heh, too. Behind every well paid attorney bunch us lesser paid admins running show shadows. people shut lol everyone that's anti-lockdown suddenly seriously concerned mental health means pretending care lets go get shitfaced pub sooner Dengvaxia- Sanofi tested vaccine Philippines

Pandemrix- Flu vaccine strong correlation (when causation) narcolepsy

Polio outbreak caused OPV Congo. 

Cases past 10 years, remember. Outdoor heaters canopies exist? Sure! made final call 3 weeks prior date rushed setting everything up, also gave us complete control event. almost felt like less pressure people people we’re close with. great Aunt moms side see every 2 years holidays make awkward conversation with. random cousin significant others side you’re meeting first time live 8 hours away. situations cause lot anxiety I’m glad didn’t deal wedding day.

Along lines, felt intimate. said, knew everyone extremely well 20-25 people, able take time everyone instead worrying spending tiny bit time 125 different people. really nice. helped two families get know better. Usually families tend stay side understandable distant relatives don’t see often things like that, 25 people, everyone mingled everyone else cool see.

Looking back now, like unique. able thing skip formalities may expected didn’t make sense Covid (receiving line, etc.). felt special. comfortable still got things mattered. Everyone super understanding supportive understand situation. nice everyone really rallied around us. 

I hope day wonderful. still special, promise you. specific questions, I’m happy try answer! that! Hoping clear proper party 2021! I'd like point could ample testing New York badly hit, inexplicable decision accept tests offered put boots that. Big one Maine too. 3 deaths. 100 cases. Priest service said God would protect them. Says who? proof cause spikes though? one thing complain double standard, far saying ""you wrong"". college towns become testing sites herd immunity. hit 60/70 % infected quickly. kids survive. Mostly. college employees too. Retirees better stay home. Next months provide useful data. PA Gov. Wolf ordered nursing homes take covid positive patients leading great majority PA COVID cases deaths coming nursing homes. Easily avoidable obviously foolish decision made. lol rite wingers give shit NYC entire thread cancer. pathetic. i’ve come accept lost rona constantly refusing provide mechanism would actually work disease covid-19, easily transmitted, kills people rather quickly caused outbreak corners world simultaneously within months first documented outbreak. 

Your examples good. AIDS completely meaningless, difficult spread (especially anywhere western society first half 20th century, considering habits), sure exactly mean Spanish Flu Swine flu. former occurred period world travel tiny compared today spread known ways massive world movement troops, latter, really sure referring to, link provided describes spread rather clearly, maximum months first crisis declared Mexico. 

The water genomic analyses interesting sure. enough expertise dispute based alone, want push hypothesis virus circulated year ahead Wuhan consistent way, simply need provide mechanism would worked. Again, thing infected entire bloody planet, causing outbreaks everywhere touched. done before?  Stop it. It’s waste energy try argue someone rejected math concept. You’ll find disagree division eventually. Neither unfounded fear based science, emotions. I’m lawyer, thought worked lawyer typing! side effects YET. Look history Thalidomide.  And, 2000 people nearly enough. hope works out, ready yet. massed produced ready? much cost? Also happens virus mutates, common flu every year??? That's great qualify one them.

Doesn't squat qualify either. specifically replying ""Barely inconvenience."" course right thing inconvenience money important human life. dismissing easy helpful.  dont believe that. Maybe ""grandma killer"" lot anticovid dipshits arguing affects old people on, definitely nazi. know meme word gets thrown around lot, always see lot less use word complaining word. already resolved awhile. goofs stop trying keep everyone scared saying things like 'Grandma going die Xmas!!' could back normal month ago. found easier move away people rather ask space. Also, conversation people close exposes more. capitalism communist-borne virus lmao tried running article archive.is outline.com create non paywalled version, surprisingly didn’t work. Sorry mate, tried yea agree that's meant mexican junk food mexican food would thought realizing neighbours coworkers know-nothings cared partying 'owning intellectuals' defeating pandemic: government controlled autocrats actively thwarting attempts control crisis political gain, enriching themselves: livelihood destroyed social safety nets neglected 50 years, 'free market', would lead depression? Something **was** wrong. thing lack testing guess mean get fever know certainty got actual vaccine. wtf anything

everyone knows crowds = bad right now.. reason behind crowd forming (for whatever reason) responsable crowd

i wouldnt invite everyone pool party.. say fault someone drowned.. (if someone drowns pool responsable)

you got flawed logic dude dropped. Something told whole story. even mentions article free go walks, go outdoors stuff. Every business worldwide shut down. makes sense reasonable. Anita Shaffer citation though sounds like overzelous cop something else going like felt working. citation issued entire state. say stopped would receive massively hyperbolic. sounds like one individual given citation dropped stupid begin with. Joke's them, I'm depressed time already anyways. they’re dead? Tortillas, except north, made mostly corn. Fried food common much rice/beans/corn/chillicombo everyone eats everyday repeat super healthy nutritious. 

Trust, big culprit junk food sugary drinks dirt cheap. really fuck entire country like that. Go ahead stay inside , wear mask careful. like I'm advocating going night clubs shit, closures businesses rest political hit job attempted nonsense needs stop.

Let's shut everything medical sector overwhelmed, sure makes sense. didnt get overrun keep going. 

If infectious indicated , going exposed anyways.

But here's thing, everything gone real kicker is...... one knows anything still, know scare tactics said would lost millions now, haven't, even using grossly inflated overstated numbers officials use. Thanks great advice!! Free sign say they're free?

My Walgreens sign says free flu shots. means free insurance. $40 without insurance. Buy puzzles now, people! Outline doesn’t work either Listen what? narrative things need shut down, gatherings, beaches closed, etc. suddenly protests right cause okay? dumb, one buying it. real issue hanging indoors bars, overall wearing masks close quarters.  Womp womp. save money people. freeeeedommmm!!! 😂 Sounds like dopy fear mongering, but, know, you. probably lot people allowed talk about. That’s quite leap. I’m going continue happy science deniers reducing chances procreating continue enjoy day. hope find happiness. yeehaw murica US expecting isn’t paying attention.

Not US. Anyone knows anything drug approval process works would astonished got full approval end year. extraordinary times, people pushing things, limit still able reasonably safe. approval, people expect earliest October, likely winter spring, whole distribution game starts. get half population inoculated 3 months (independent country size), would super fast. Half year would reasonable estimate. disciplinary actions this? Australia would major fines I’ve following worldometer time, Italy reporting 10% didn’t trust China’s numbers. didn’t think 10% would continue true, took guess. party two weeks ago germany 20 people felt quite bad really enjoy fuck wedding ~300 people think pandemic second consequences facing something bad happens! toxic viewpoint Here's worst part. look around see many idiots are. realize many make way money generally valued society despite barely able put two sentences together revolving lives around fake medical treatments fox news talking points. HAH! already depression 2020 Thread likely locked within next 24 hours. New York post? sent Something mother Jones would except source? Second read Yale study funny it’s abstract doesn’t actually discuss methods data found. additional sources? 6% number I’ve seen thrown around lot. say subtract people comorbidities disingenuous half Americans comorbidities meaning half susceptible virus not. I'd say evidence cure worse disease. evidence intuition. Live life, man. WAY thinking Huh, I""d said that. Stay safe. guess he/she keeps telling believe it. school situation sucks, truly. feel you.

On communication issue, possible sort microphone teacher along well placed speakers class room. Typically setups used large halls would otherwise impossible hear, course. certainly solutions.

The obstacles overcome available another thing too.

I don’t envy difficulty teachers like facing.

I also agree there’s replacement type school used to. may come pass, however, need adapt reaction pandemics. Covid first, last.

Please safe. Teachers important part present future. gonna listen, even replying? Evangelicals home school I'm sure handle it. takes special level shitbaggery spend time day collecting negative karma C19 sub pandemic. 2 deliberate attacks intent kill large amount people also massive structural damage. 

The novel virus poorly managed, intention kill anyone, it’s viruses tend mean reddit. big topic MSM, work, schools, anywhere. Probably America still ""near-old Irish man"" levels discussing feelings. fun directly related high chances end respirator. That's biggest gripe. like center attention things like all. I'd probably throw pass less ideal time anyways.

I want wedding day. Congratulations! take child away, unfit danger health. Listen, protests - center media attention large gatherings, represent small portion overall activity interaction society - didn’t account 0.1% interactions. people could even visit wives childbirth, attend funerals, visit parents

These quite specific, but, example, if
we didn’t mind “visiting parents” would lot dead parents. fact, “visiting parents” would probably way impact entire protests given close interaction closed spaces. jobs businesses, many mental health problems suicides/drug abuse skyrocketed etc etc

I feel like really naive. assume different things - one economy would better without restrictions. isn’t case places haven’t shut down, would case US. would happen likely repeat NY national scale, - hundreds thousands dead. damage economy would much greater. issues mention would exacerbated tenfold. overall complains mask-wearing, social distancing hygiene might saved entire global peaceful, unfortunately riots caused massive destruction businesses property) show entire thing politicized.

Are sure you’re one politicizing it? vast majority protests peaceful, even weren’t didn’t cause “massive” destruction property business. That’s complete exaggeration local instances.

I guess it’s easier ignore facts issues since it’s easier accept conspiracy... it’s reality.

Edit: writing checked history actually post conspiracy sub. would suggest rethink media consumption complain media vehemently. discussed EVERYWHERE. That’s rona Fever dream talking masks saying rare based hypothetical possibilities.

I said that? say based conjectures

Definition conjecture:

1a : inference formed without proof sufficient evidence

You, without sufficient evidence: ""It's rare proven otherwise.""

Shit, Canadians regard Americans ACTUAL WAY. focus that. Mexicans stopped trying cross already. There's fucking jobs even Americans anymore MAGA idiots stupid wear fucking mask president stupid follower leader. think key word ""outside"" ""protest"" , bud wtf CDC suggested people wear mask

Agreed, earth can't people change behavior information changes? CDC said XYZ mean advice forever truth acceptable.  people peacefully burning buildings? lot go indoors get fire started... protests get OK like permits. yes, clear hindsight could've left outdoors stuff open. think things clear hindsight too, like maybe colleges opened. craziest pandemic we've century, we're bound get stuff wrong. It’s really different strain, there’s enough genetic variation tell it’s virus reactivating first infection. None genetic variations circulating virus qualify different strains. I'm confused... MANY people could even visit wives childbirth, attend funerals, visit parents, lost jobs businesses, many mental health problems suicides/drug abuse skyrocketed etc etc yet protests (some peaceful, unfortunately riots caused massive destruction businesses property) A-ok? 

Goes show entire thing politicized. economic downturn would harmed people, though. 

It pick poison.

Sweden's people better it. Watch Spain, coming Don’t forget NYC. Right America example bad outbreak handled. rest country ignored it. Behind way? fewer fatalities sounds like best kind behind possible.

Even second wave coming, countries far better odds now. testing, protective gear, knowledge, better treatment, shorter hospital stays, lower fatality rates, vaccines way. race bottom. went public school outside city. Whenever students city transferred, would put GED class. far behind. shit learned 6th grade high school. 

Some public schools great. joke. know city, teachers would rather work private schools. Private catholic schools good way make sure child getting education need prepare college. many public schools inner cities that. Yep, way month Mask mandate cases go up? Can't read article. (Blocked Europe.)

Did wear masks? Yeah, government QC bit slow this. went bar recently (work event, go; manager looking bad hadn’t attended since quarantine started) waiter wasn’t wearing mask. 
I asked to, reply? “You’re already much risk here, doesn’t make difference wear mask.” told would make comfortable he’d wear one... huffed put mask on. (we terrace, everyone self isolating, risk wasn’t high) 
If waiters walk around serving patrons mask chin, restaurant/bar doesn’t get fine.. problem keep spreading. Quebec shouldn’t opened bars without rules place way enforce them.. bar owners threatening open without government approval, guess decided let open Well, depends specifically prohibited rule book like actual gathering 🤷‍♂️ would people wear masks wedding? least guests should.

The head Infectious Diseases Department “Sfântul Ioan cel Nou” Emergency Hospital Suceava, Dr. Monica Terteliu, fell ill second time Covid-19.

Now, virus also affected internal organs. existing scientific information date provide data SARS-Cov 2 reinfection, known whether mutation original virus whether due overexposure virus. now, considered went disease immunity, even known long immunity would last. Dr. Monica Terteliu hospitalized, treatment careful medical monitoring. first contracted Covid-19 second half March. Even period ill, kept touch colleagues hospital provided consultations telephone. returning hospital, worked long hours, requested ward period, massive exposure virus compounded overwork, could favored factor reinfection. seems first case Romania, doctor getting sick Covid-19. Given this, scientific interest case high, possible Dr. Monica Terteliu taken National Institute Infectious Diseases ""Prof. Dr. Matei Balș ”Bucharest. Well, that's worrying all. gg herd immunity tactic... ""As long virus exists, masks, social distancing, frequent closures, banning large gatherings remain part life.""

Was original point. Given ever eradicated smallpox, extremely unlikely eradicate covid even vaccine.

So using reasoning social distancing permanent. fault incredible ignorance led make hyperbolic ridiculous point. one neighbors went Mexico asked borders closed said ""only land borders closed! We're flying!"" I'm salty it. unfair frustrating. worst part tr hat nothing happens them, they'll keep downplaying tbh hate ppl. Well that’s dumb. stayed home waiting results...

u/lumpix69 \- Yes, countries far success us (the U.S. A.). recent comment one struck as, well, one disagree with. 'The government failed us...' agree least we're talking highest levels. We've leadership, clear direction, really hurt us. 

BUT add state lower levels governors, mayors, pretty good job setting science-based policy give us framework get keep control. UNFORTUNATELY, wild card comes in, 'FREE AMERICAN' told do. sad reality current situation US is, IMO, due mainly relatively small subset population happens vocal going selfishly refuse follow rules make small sacrifices sake fellow humans.

I think constant adjustment balance based 1) current science controlling spread covid learning every day; 2) staged reopening plans and; 3)metrics. know, ugh, metrics!! framework set followed takes pressure politicians. Goals set and, met, either move forward less restrictive stage bad enough even pull back little. becomes objective rather subjective. know we're Idaho success - taking account rebels still gather despite current rules &amp; recommendations set government. also think pretty much New York successfully doing?

Good news vaccine likely beginning 2021. 3 ongoing phase III trails US alone. even make phase 3, documented effective immune response. can't imagine Oxford cares American politics. trials process too.

I absolutely idea said. Why? it’s Idaho. can't understand nuance nations, that's problem. Stop trying simply things black-and-white manners. 

If feeling insecure US handled Covid-19, take leadership lack thereof.  Really sucks hear still long term symptoms, understand you’re saying didn’t actually COVID diagnosis. 

And sick back October, right? Wasn’t patient November?

No offense you’re talking nothing COVID. wouldn't. Though curious, call proctologist. Physics hard. No, actually I'm not. Read again. know -- physics hard. yeah point is, UHC making way moneys actually influence government decides, things gonna stay like long time.  I’m pretty sure it’s bad America anymore. phase III human trials several candidate vaccines. possibility us working vaccine 2021 almost zero currently. Stop spreading outdated bullshit. Northern Indiana same. Finding people maskless every day. wind important factor. Since mass droplets small, even small draft redirect sneeze disperse concentrated, equals lowered risk transmission.

Not necessarily reasons I've already explained. distance changes you’re outdoors unless zero wind. Otherwise range actually 20 feet.

Now fuzzy math. Please explain using actual math bullshit. direction wind, i.e., wind coming toward you, area infection longer, essentially saying. away wind, yes, protects YOU, necessarily person behind infected. 

Jesus, directionality hard you? first grade 6ft guideline supposed use along masks, separately. 

Re-read said try keep up. would accurate sneezes didn’t exponentially disperse, however do, wind blowing break droplet spread way lower concentrations (keep mind viral load important contagion).

Yes, however, that's assuming range. Within six feet, not. Adding wind speed coming you, definitely not. takes one droplet. again, wrong, air resistance something like sneeze would slow considerably. 

Again, re-read actually wrote. think one confused, mention direction speaking. talking vector, e.g., magnitude direction; handwaving magnitude. Try again. giant copper hamster wheel? There's got way mount stand magnets turn generator.... It’s easy sit around judge, 275 people made choice wedding celebrate family. didn’t break laws. failure here, failure government policy.

They've already come said there's people infected supposed late Feb date - one pointed case showing patient died Feb 6 California infected it.

Yknow, absolutely love term someone decides choose woman best man role. sure speak pompous ass though, bravo douche. you’re done smelling shit rest day? sad existence. two people want center attention get presents exchange possibly spreading covid attendees every human been/will contact with.

It's disgusting, selfish narcissistic. wedding. 

I appreciate right thing, even detriment livelihood. He's definitely troll good lol gave pericarditis, 18. also funeral yesterday. immediate family inside, maybe 20 people so, masks mandatory. little different really. burial lot people showed outside everyone wore masks stayed distanced. far norm think done safely. make wrote true. still false say ""vulnerable"" vaccinated first. Elderly without known pre-existing conditions excluded still vulnerable. even touch uncertainty around vaccine quantities viable enough, making available, convincing enough people get it. post straight lie. tell Trump fast tracks vaccine getting TONS bad effects Lol extension fixes 'should of' wondering what's wrong Funeral home owner: gift keeps giving. Amen!  Guess 275 people gives two fucks next morning?   FWIW supposed lighthearted comment “r u dum???” insult, but...tone internet doesn’t always come across well. 

Anyway, think largely situational. 

If you’re requiring people make significant change behavior (eg. ask people going out/going work/eating restaurants/etc suddenly stop two weeks)...I agree likelihood total compliance high. 

However, asking group essentially quarantining already (WFH, restaurants, limited grocery trips) quarantine, think high likelihood full compliance (other asking people big grocery trip two weeks out) you’re asking people change much all. SMDH; love sports miss much, full agreement sports, even golf canceled remainder 2020 year maybe even first quarter 2021. Yes, lot implications canceling entire year sporting events money, eligibility, professional drafts etc; however, would given every major player sports world time needed put forth much needed reform schedules, conferences, paying college athletes, finance laws boosters, recruitment, scholarships etc. negative comes pandemic, people U.S. sure seized forms innovations time would allow. disappointing leaders see way. Wow, ass human being. really didn’t say anything stubbornness showing hard. Technically correct usually reply, “yeah people begging new plague. Shoulda let virus get many people possible.” don’t like put morbidly. Yes did. people saw lives rights infringed measure didn’t even help. That's good point truly wedding 275 guests ZERO masks worn, I'm thinking one particular political party.

That makes even shittier people symptoms still going work. Unemployment covers scenario $400 max weekly benefit MN, plus $300 extra, that's late July August, given back payments. need change Sweden still poorly Denmark, country aggressively shut everything down. Besides, somebody commented Sweden restrictions: right they're comparable Canada much strict Croatia Serbia. think kind dissection says much yet, example quick glance seems drop tourism bigger factor. 😂😂😂 said flu deadly okay know finding treatment make difficult treat 😂 otherwise fatalities would higher ain't. like said u troll good keep 💗 love u boo dude keeps saying this. get paid make people depressed? correspond actually happened spring. virus caused huge outbreak EVERYWHERE went, entire planet. matter factors list, place spared. would happened earlier? feel this. Halloween date venue contract stipulates get nothing back acts God, normal etc Pandemics. Venue won’t budge certainly could afford five figure reschedule.  
The best could things considered move ceremony outside, masks gloves mandatory provided. Distancing enforced security. 
Indoors fortunately full top floor reserved package folks -have- confirmed attend 8ft apart more. 
I see lot snarky comments ‘how awful didn’t think people scheduling’. completely paid January October year. certainly didn’t see coming then. Invites reduced, they’re zero. best situation go ahead careful possible. That's life want live. want little 1k sqft place from, like, 1910. Something that's lasted century. care inside layout's ""updated"" whatever long wiring's good. 😂😂😂😂😂 get help buddy

China wide open cases. cities dont even need masks anymore. US like that? Said start, ridiculous NFL players exactly part elites. Yeah, Tom Brady is, guy bounces practice squad backup role. mention average NFL career like 3 years, make minimum $1.5 million whole career, sounds like lot isn't.

That said, ultimately serves elites, making money otherwise wouldn't. Gotta live life  list would nice. year? 2020.

I think COVID begin finally die next spring life less return normal summer (barring another colossal disaster). virus though good. That’s incorrect, measles cases extremely good prognosis little long-term impact immune system, let alone measles-virus-specific immune system. reason bring measles particular provokes particularly strong immune response — accordingly, exposure infection basically considered near-guarantee immunity. There’s reason measles vaccine recommendations explicitly exclude individuals born certain year — age, you’ve basically guaranteed exposed, that’s basically considered sufficient evidence immunity warrant bothering vaccine. That’s strong long-lived immunity measles virus is.

So no, don’t understand medicine correctly — hope helped inform you.

If still want nitpick measles, feel free substitute virus choice original statement — still correct (barring extremely uncommon viruses two *exposures* unlikely, obviously). go without saying: you’re really try arguing measles particular, completely missing point. (Not expect otherwise sub.) So, courthouse route cost marriage certificate?

I'm pretty confident time another lock choice lots lives lost, large part due large minority brains small, malnourished stoat. right. thing epidemiological curve. - certainly look like bell. Wait what? EU less total deaths bigger population US, mean US higher per capita? Yeah, I'm troll citing sources substantiate argument, person spreading blatant misinformation that's intentionally misrepresenting premise question isn't. Lol. Ok. Measles reset immunities vaccination. She’s fickle like that. Oh ... thinking pandemic economic shutdown would effect depression rates. article totally shed light me. Wait til see much university going cost Imagine competent government response like countries dealing that. able go US, imagine it. Stop cherry picking statistics want suit false leftist narratives.

Conservative protesters spread coronavirus; liberal protesters don’t, duh. friend mine got real upset declining wedding +1. Sorry, sorry. Maga....56 voters intensive care Nowhere exactly steady. way article worded makes seem like 1 case counts increasing one less counts decreasing. Also national number reported states' numbers added up.


Also article: ""The increases masked nationwide decreasing new infections populous states California, Florida Texas."" Wait hears elderly people preexisting conditions Kills gallbladder! Dangerous drug! Uncle Jack's special day, MINE!  country confused about? I'm arguing one bit. think epidemiologists right beginning said can't get rid things. remember clearly news way back (Sweden) either chief epidemiologist (Tegnell) advisor (Gieschke) pointed news anchor said ""sooner later, going get it. going get it. I'm going get it"" continued talk importance overwhelm hospitals laying strategy people accept go long time. probably Sweden started see first cases. saying lockdown good idea. implemented poorly. done 300 odd cases nationally. way graph never peaked even now. There's hundreds us! group ""Saving Scotland"",

Is gonna turn one groups created social media Russians? live Maine three people (who attend wedding) dead service held several weeks ago, nearly 150 infected. pastor officiated infected many people congregation. It’s insane. Grundy ""fancy two story"" Walmart. 

I miss friends family.  miss beauty land. 

However, miss conservative aspect living there. thing happened Maine something like 100+ cases believe three deaths. hell would attend wedding right now, let alone without face mask insane. Especially indoor weddings. Looks like need connect brain it’s working fair, got married 2018 venues booking least year half advance, otherwise normal times. depends area desirability certain venues, can't even imagine trying book something 2022... like looking Hassidic Jews Mennonites, men stick dress code.

On serious note, huge influx canned food British diet 1920s overall food portions smaller, many sweet snacks drinks available, lot exercise daily life. That’s true. can’t count many times mom said, “It would nice invited.” 

My wedding *very* small husband household nine years. didn’t invite anyone, sent announcements--including slip paper requesting “good wishes only, gifts please.” 

I figured wasn’t inviting wedding, didn’t “owe” gift. wanted family/friends know status finally legal. They're able retroactively confirm cases understanding. possible significant numbers would lot people dying due ""severe flu"" something like that. recall case. Especially since New York first big epicenter fact huge international hub. Lmaooo love u bro Sucks miss adoption celebration sister hosted house new husband officially adopted two kids. lot people missing lot special moments. blame us, blame incompetent leadership failed get control quickly Karens wear masks ""infringed freedom."" Thankfully able send heartfelt congratulations gifts, monogrammed necklaces girls' new initials. we’re fed information like it’s worst thing ever happen.

In sub coronavirus expect hear news issues surrounding coronavirus. plenty things discussed news, politics, whatever subs. Again, understand else expecting specific sub. Low? 1000+ dead long now? Ur troll dawg good respect drama u incite anyone reading anxiety, troll account lol. bullshit? people give complying.

First it’s flatten curve two weeks. it’s wait vaccine. it’s well vaccine won’t end things.

THIS PEOPLE DONT FOLLOW RECOMMENDATIONS! people get fined US breaking rules? should, like 10k person. I'm referring blatant rule breaking like weddings etc false. initial rollout guidelines provide expedited vaccination elderly, people pre-existing conditions. talking &lt;100 reports millions. That’s pretty rare. applies every country world. Seems like courthouse marriage put ceremony pandemic would better idea, risk grandma's life. Why? Sweden country every single person personal number, number used authorities stored common databases. 

Want covid test? Result stored personal number. Registering deaths? Obviously registered personal number. Want find number covid deaths? SQL Join two tables.

And US social security numbers, ubiquitous used every single authority everything. There’s already rift starting wife’s family Covid. We’ve careful haven’t spent time family events summer. worried pulled wedding would mean major fallout.  Great news disappoint doomsayers here. I’m Ontario, going patios months slowly group started sitting inside, mainly watch NHL/NBA playoffs whilst eating. regular protocol follows, 

Every table limits, group done, table decontaminjtated use again, everyone must wear mask seated, getting go washroom like, mask back on. trusted much sent brown people Brazil try Everything wrote applies neighbourhood house I'm renting room Southern California. lot people truly care. Yeah, businesses shut down, effort pause society prevent exposure spread. bad. Imagine straight nothing, like usually flu. stay people trying turn country autocratic theocracy leave. must life canceled somebody else?

To save world. Free booze food bumfuck flyover. Statistically would invite 2000 people wedding possibly end one dying person dies would likely sick enough died anyway.

This place mess.  Embarrassing scared place is. 460 drugs essential medicines list, patent, available costs affordable even developing nations, well-characterized safety profiles. makes sense compounds like dexamethasone, ivermectin, even hydroxychloroquine, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-clotting activity highest interest. Hydroxychloroquine moment close scrutiny randomized controlled trials, failed. Dexamethasone (similarly cheap) benefited outcomes several RCTs, corticosteroids standard care serious critical Covid19.

Before Covid-19 pandemic, ivermectin [demonstrated antiviral benchtop studies RNA viruses Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Hendra, Newcastle, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, chikungunya, Semliki Forest, Sindbis, Avian influenza A, Porcine Reproductive Respiratory Syndrome, HIV-1, 2020, found inhibit reproduction SARS CoV-2. attention effective mechanism broad activity gone ivermectin [inhibits binding importin α β viral regulatory prevents viral encoded proteins entering nucleus regulating host cell gene expression. may important given [the Bradykinin storm Covid19 pathology.

Now ivermectin's turn. far, there's [one randomized (but placebo controlled) appears promising (health care workers prophylactic ivermectin: 7.4% infected, control: 58.4% infected). Many [others  Many people looking excuse stop giving shit, really miss way things were. Newsflash though, pretty much everyone does. Three years (a standard guess long might take over) forever, certain group people is, they're reason things screwed US. give inch, they'll take mile. state fine hell people refuse wear masks, they'll keep it. make gatherings illegal, they'll continue happen. close indoor dining, people continue eat restaurants like nothing wrong even smug it. They'll skirt around rules impossible continue *cause*.

They care hurts wallets, innocent people dying droves enough right thing. American individualism worst. Right. skipped brother's wedding two weeks ago. seem right seem safe...  hits ""we would put cry room..."" BLM protests Australia also showed COVID-19 downvote change fact wrong. Yeah can’t right now. someone trying enter country, it’s easy. I’m working getting work visa moment it’s incredibly slow.   embarrassed. never thought values inner core begin with.

Wtf?? vaccines fast tracked, testing them. time cut-down due running phases parallel benefits hot spots make trial recruitment faster easier determine efficacy.

You also remember necessity mother innovation. virus crippled world, everyone's interest solve it. means candidates receiving immense resources speed things up.

Governments already paid manufacturing begin rather apprival, helps speed process. [You mean Denmark, country highest rate new infections per day twise Sweden. way early say country ""did poorly"" comes number cases/deaths. Also, countries seeing rise cases going Swedens route instead new lockdowns. think is? I’m saying, compare wedding ones like one mentioned article ludacris. aware risks, everyone traveled too. calls coming left right people longer coming didn’t bother us one bit - averaging 1-2 week March July. understood going on. stupid still wedding? course, absolutely. I’ll take grave. - 1, - 0. win. worried sick entire week? bet, it’s fucking pandemic, everyone coming risk.
But didn’t priest advising us wear masks. didn’t 30-35 people crowded space. didn’t option vendors recover thousands dollars already put occasion. went anyways still wanted get married couldn’t afford assume sunk costs magically restart postponed. went well. vendors wore masks, room originally booked 120+ guests still used maybe 7-8 tables 15-20 feet apart 4-5 guests per table family members boot.

And part always feel stupid wedding did. worried fallout discussions like this. justify private gathering 30+ people like wedding global pandemic. Clearly, it’s lost cause. huge, dumb, risk. one wife members family willing take, risk others weren’t willing take. vowed everything power ensure safe comfortable could was. weren’t without regards world families people like grandparents. Sure didn’t check temperatures door two weeks prior, gave everyone planning coming much information could could make decision themselves. told planned, measures taken, everything between. 

And know, dumb assblasted downvotes thread made me, I’d – especially discovering nobody either side aisle tested positive wedding could done right measures place. although families didn’t follow exactly CDCs guidelines detail, cognizant smart enough buy wedding safely, took risk, agreement socially distance, wash hands, sanitize surfaces, wear masks, everyone came safely, celebrated safely, went home safely. articles like this, people wearing masks 100+ people, course jackasses going test positive everyone involved could’ve done better job. 

Look, I’m sorry decision wedding offended put fear folks like wife reason grandparents people’s grandparents aren’t safe. never intent making anyone feel like that. understand others – even people family – feel like felt like moved plans. don’t go much. Hardly ever unless to. world changing much lives covid, wanted one, small, positive reason believe year wasn’t bad made be. even 1 person tested positive covid following wedding, shit, don’t even think I’d thread – let alone alive. guilt would’ve forever haunted me, everyone else would’ve green light rip new one.

Stupid, dumb, foolish, inexcusable. Say want, it’s done. vowed never larger gatherings like covid died down. Hell, we’ve already passed several visits/hangouts friends, parties, bbqs. say we’re smarter aware decision wedding back July gives us credit for. think 0 people test positive dust settled testament cautious families were. Also anybody attended large wedding refused social distance afterwards equally guilty. could easily infected without symptoms, limit interaction people attend wedding. would got cold, got tested covid, negative, still cold?

&amp;#x200B;

If go around normal schedule, give ppl cold, might go get tested, fear till then. could tell ppl cold, work stranger situations. hand, colds common covid last long time, can't freak cold much disrupt life. again, cold, get symptomless lite symptom covid cold, would know, think cold, spreading it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would ppl sub cold? much let disrupt life, much precaution take? lot people like grew Vietnam War going on. 
I’ve luck “58,000 Americans died Vietnam 13 years. We’re 187,000+ 6-7 months. Tell it’s serious.” think get government assistance form rent/mortgage/utility relief events strict limitations. People pay lot event, done legally safely, pay precautions. can't wait year party break rules pay huge fines go fix healthcare infrastructure. That's literally wedding beyond ceremony require large number people packed closely together inside. think ridiculous long getting approval like using parking lots outdoor dining etc, bureaucracy sucks. get started pointless bureaucracy medical insurance lol. couple past week broke restrictions. 750k fine. That's did! Got engaged February pandemic started kicking States. Saw wedding industry implode overnight. Decided hold putting deposits anything. case numbers kept climbing said fuck it!! eloped July. Spent money would spent wedding payment first house. Cant throw party next year everyone dead. Know much covid hospital bill be? That's exactly fiancee except week Halloween. annoys people say ""they going die"" ""number deaths low""

death bad thing that's going happen, that's worse case scenario. college student, time sick, let alone corona virus. there's many problems...

WONT way forever multiple times dangerous seasonal flu (4x-10x worse, based IFR estimates). Also, many people get flu realize ever get 2015 study showed 75% people get flu asymptomatic unlike best estimate 30% coronavirus. majority people, 50 mild symptoms, 3-15% hospitalized, pretty high compared flu. Also, compared flu, people serious bout sometimes day 120 still serious symptoms whereas flu, week. Also, coronavirus, recent study found even among asymptomatic people 1/3 showing myocarditis. sure getting ""influenza clearly much worse"" seasonal flu killed 30% coronavirus serious post-infection affects (blood clots) long-haulers 100+ days infection. long get serious case corona, sure, big deal... complex alone, many parties. looking good next weeks know. probably 20 years since went grundy last time...

She family anymore, friends moved away pretty much.  Left town long ago. false.  really something. 

You’re either blast trolling Redditors think serious, real living testament it’s critical people US vote November 3rd. like one! government refusing test people, potential infected people refusing get tests.

I think state asking everyone either test tests positive attended large events, went indoor dining, bars, etc.

MN pretty good nailing likelihood cases come least, infected people indoors large groups without masks. think they're taking granular reporting infected person grocery shopping Tuesday afternoon.

As wedding, I'd guess got enough positives reported attending wedding able least attempt get guest list so, could cross check names recent test results. warm

That works well block saves time future. [The CDC posits early mid late Emergency approval may elderly, high risk groups. 

The whole point emergency approval becomes unethical roll drug good chance saving lives.

You cannot make argument vaccinating young people face small risk virus, hence may wait phase 3 concludes full approval rollout.

With logistics mean getting vaccine areas needed physically jabbing people. much difficult task making vaccine still cared enough go. forced Probably outdoor vs indoor. Germs like sunlight water droplets spread dry disperse faster outside.

Compare spray-painting outside spray-painting inside. inside, paint goes everywhere fumes linger hours. outside, probably even notice fumes. still get paint brush freshly painted surface stand downwind spraying, totally safe.  limitations mass gatherings too. That's literally every movie theater country shut down. point moot. tell felt? We're wedding month (smaller, full protections, completely changed), I'd love reassurance. ways better? venue let us postpone we're thousands dollars (because required minimums can't meet new guest count) going able 2021 2022.

I'm firmly belief faster, firmer restrictions put place control virus precisely needed allow economy get moving basically 4 week shutdown (not lockdown - shutdown nonessential business highlights Denmark implemented tougher measures EU approach dealing coronavirus pandemic could best summarized saying “Act fast act mentioned earlier, Danish government among first countries Europe act act firmly virus declaring national lockdown closing borders. country’s approach drastic differed greatly neighbour and” old enemy” – Sweden, relatively measures, except ‘social distancing’ imposed public life. Denmark banned large public gatherings, closed unnecessary venues across cities, heavily discouraged use public transportion manner travel unless absolutely essential. Daycares, schools universities quickly shut air travel severely restricted – restrictions become ‘new normal’ across continent, Denmark among first countries impose restrictions.

The article good read, seems like several factors (more quick firm response Danish government) contributed Denmark probably single factor, sum different factors, together contributed effective management coronavirus crisis, also explains Denmark first European country slowly gradually re-open society, time surrounding countries still severe lockdown. family Christmas normal.

Our neighborhood started talking Halloween plans. False. Literally yesterday.

Good riddance. 🤷‍♀️ completely ridiculous, idea people up-voting you. 0.06% population died. number vulnerable affected way enough slow deaths. think 6000 vulnerable people Sweden pandemic? extroverted, social anxiety-having self going crazier usual throughout this.

I'll never understand propensity Americans shoot foot justify jingoistic bullshit. anti-maskers reason. selfish Karens, others refuse distrust. Government officials cheat lie much even mandates best interest, people already pissed betrayed listen. I'm saying agree. I'm mind getting whole story, I'm wearing mask avoiding jumping conclusions. believe people good. We're panicky, emotional animals leads us selfish actions when, better circumstances better state mind, might act cheritable. think crime goes poverty goes up?

Despite big differences socioeconomic status, Mexico, Brazil USA one thing common: bad leadership. person takes Trump telling people vote twice ""metaphorical"" even given video No. while. big problem US testing lately overwhelmed labs processing tests, availability tests themselves. tests coming market now. That's issue. could still healthcare though, think. Thanks AMLO really want get .... went talking patient whose vitals stable intubating healthy 26 year old history ..... within 30 minutes Whats cool? genuine question, somebody died flu say died flu you?

You die lots things cv19 going kill you, symptoms are. 

Plus, commenting moaning people asking question shows either full shit know themselves. People put ventilators anymore, plus treatment become way better. ICU rates low, positive test rates low, death rates low.

People getting caught positive test results, especially considering good evidence suggest testing standards sensitive may detecting dead residual virus calling positive case. closed facebook back 2013. Never looked back.


I cringe every time see asshole suckerberg I've seen projection posted many times already. Frankly, conclusions absurd. right basis projecting cases deaths increase dramatically New Year. fully aware could spikes Fall people head indoors, projection increased caseload pure speculation rather based currently available numbers. I've found projections uses Machine Learning existing data, produce far reasonable predicted outcomes. site saying around 220,000 November 1. could miss HK protest ? Yeah far know correct. can't fly direct Beijing. live, many places yes, (if willing get tested every day). realize I’m nurse covid unit ... sitting talking ... code ( likely clot somewhere) start going ... trending... like 20 yr athlete history anything ... smoking obesity nothing ... nothing ... o2 went 80s ... put 02 ended intubating sending ICU within 30 minutes 20 minutes .... drastic ... covid scary ... viruses depends body reacts lot said underreporting corruption thread, read lilnes.

Technical difficulties corruption aside, shows government oblivious magnitude crisis. Everything else said media posturing.

Besides, 2019 around 700k people dies natural causes. probably print many certificates least every year (some get destroyed transports, get cancelled mistakes, etc...). Natural deaths plus expectation couple hundred thousand excess deaths, 1.1M order next 6-12 months surprising. Oh yes, valiant savior, fuck weaklings need interact others. truly morally superior. ""People made decision come global pandemic,"" event spokesperson told News 4. ""**So decided keep people’s camps 200 feet away one another** advise wearing masks meeting others. people feel safe, make others feel safe."" 

Emphasis mine. Coherent logic strong suit, it? What's Maine's school plan? We’ve practicing social distancing 190,000 people died didn’t seem save lives Lol good. 24k participants tell us lot. 30k would better. never happen, Wise Guy. Okay, there’s significant difference traveling vacation going store. understand wanting friends people super reckless, consider popping homegoods “being pandemic cheater” you’re absolutely ridiculous you’re going end one. even heard testing samples back that's found California February. Buy ink High quality reliable antibody studies done anywhere North America knowledge. People want know answers question.

Some US states low quality antibody studies. comparison European countries high quality (aka calibrated) studies. on? think we’re ok dominican republic. You’re moron realize it’s scary fast die everyone stops making dogs, happens? kinda like one morge china ordered million erns liked death count. Except grim. still bad thing grandma uses Facebook post life updates every weeks. Everyone loves reading them, especially they’re apart quarantine. would great used that. President AMLO lauds achievements

Strangest thing Mexico company Brazil America. Among others.
 
The Old Regimes would've least tried censure news. strangest thing post-modern world lazy predilection towards blatantly lying inconvenient truths. tennis nothing compared went NYC. can’t abide quarantine rules, going leave. 

I understand elite tennis players may touch real world rules protect us you. mainly keep Facebook alive due contacts I've made town. gets hairy like individual went through, best thing block questionable people drop hat.


I've tried connect people locally. sadly, they're much part ""suck up"" culture. unexpectedly strike nerve them. go feral. developing world large percentage elderly population opportunity age yet. recently fertility rates dropped towards replacement levels. checked India's life expectancy. nearly 70. China 77, US 79. Even sub-Saharan African countries mostly 60s. Developing countries catch life expectancy rich world much sooner catch GDP per capita. none covid prior, get wedding? Congratulations! stop reddit enjoy honeymoon. people peacefully burning buildings? lot go indoors get fire started...

How many people think went burned buildings down? Now, conservative estimate 0.5% people even *had* virus.  


Now know much logistics burning building, think requires close contact people. okay, let's say there's 3% chance person burnt building COVID-positive person contracts COVID.

 (This *extremely* generous way, since studies suggest secondary attack rate COVID households(!) 5-15%, although there's enough data conclusive results moment.)

Now, take number people think burnt buildings, tell many cases transmissions expected act burning buildings.

I'm willing bet guess many people burn buildings inaccurate, mathematical intuition. judging Instagram stories, America give shit. many Labor Day weddings half assed mask wearing social distancing. 

With schools opening America going October disaster. Yes did. can’t afford lose job afford financially lose two weeks worth wages. Work pays time test positive. 

A lot people situation. I’ll survive. worked two weeks, stayed home otherwise time. could. pandemic sucks, easy compared pandemics historically. Even lockdown television, internet, food delivery people--it's hardly prison. step-sibling postponed March wedding, last week. center largest retirement community earth. give one single fuck STDs COVID getting treatment. I'm high infection risk respiratory illness easily kill outside ICU. educated people, hope fucktarded this. Boy wrong. Guest list grew past 6 months, none taking masks seriously, indoor rehearsal dinner wedding went planned. dad spends shitload time scrubbed fucking operating room, he's rubbing alcohol car/man-purse long I've alive. mind boggles. going make ceremony realized one wearing mask meeting point. fucking get it.

Somehow bailing entirely worked better past times I've ""power through"" due physical issues 15+ pills take daily (fully compliant btw, one 10 day opioid script one surgical procedure). indications drowsiness somehow napping Christmas apparently meant needed inpatient program. prescribed medications trade-off we've made aware since day one. COVID apparent issue 12/25 already cases. charge organized certain cunt-relative essentially no-contact besides feigning friendliness holidays. nasty habit trying fuck life reason, happening 20+ years now. can't even mention inappropriate/dangerous wanted ""meant well."" Somehow problem wanting keep freedom autonomy instead going along batshit insanity. one good thing COVID learning annoyances faking shit works lot better trying best. Fuck trying mature honest guess. think numbers much harder get that. support groups I’m ,(5months covid related suffering here) , lot people suffering long time didn’t get hospitalised first virus. managed home. especially like March, well couldn’t get tests. you’re relying antibody test data. depending long infection get test might antibodies anymore. offfically don’t exist - positive covid antibody test hospitalisation. months lethargy/inflammation/breathlessness/headaches/loss taste smell. combination symptoms theres bunch others like hair loss, mouth ulcers, joint pain, sore throat etc. could easily misdiagnosed something else doctor. DJ wedding industry it’s terrifying watch unfold. stay bubble mostly away people... lockdown weddings got pushed later year. mandates contract perform. 15 weddings September... Covid finally caught despite cautious. I’m missing first 2 weeks assuming recover fine right back grind. It’s impossible scenario wedding vendors right now. matter? can't book date somebody else later, lost sale. Seems really easy understand even agree it... That's topic article guy replying to... Feel free participate. much is. plenty scientific evidence shows people behave selfishly signal political values others. sure. I'm lawyer may care say though. run event photography company ~7 years though that's personal take it. Especially future questionable hold someone ""only rebooking event"". sucks sure sucks lot us right now. 

Not jerk side literally might money. Especially income events coming definitely possible they're sitting cash, spent deposit liquidity hand refunds. like deposits mandated sit escrow untouchable anything. I'm saying *did* happen, I'm thinking loud possibility. people menace public health. guests actually still defending wedding: least one thing remains same. wonder much obesity USA affecting all... fight coming, next year March. 🤦🏽‍♂️ nobody done yet 

At least none released. know anyway. gatherings. apply gatherings. school mandatory creates bigger problem. Sorry example hurt ? think funny someone would say care event mention it. problem another example someone assjme okay certain thing posted something else. weird. 
I shamming weddings.. 
I think probability game. probably tens thousands weddings held. one got caught virus. Unlimited resources green light run phases parallel. 

Additionally hotspots everywhere make easy source volunteers easy spot efficacy. Fair point - definitely still risk gotten negative test result asymptomatic carrier would lower odds  Exactly. They’re stupid, care wedding health “loved ones” people may infect line. Yup, definitely still consider victims. one guest actively defending wedding: 50%? mean, deposit guarantee time, time ends needed, wouldn’t call 100% refund? cancelled/postponed wedding party still going get married two us (with masks) personally happier. Never fan bells whistles attached traditional weddings. Straight in, say things boom straight out. Go pub get wasted happy shit. Whats weird Roomate covid Roomate hit juul everyday never got guy careful

""What's worst happen, catch corona again?"" 

- man caught corona sunk cost. Let go. potential costs pursuing already lost amount money greater cost already incurred. yep - 0 number looking for, 10, 1, 0. *Then* reopen. Individual responsibility something large global pamdemic way actual responsibility shift blame. would shame people gatherings officials country done countries around World halt Covid outbreaks. Putting backs individual patently absurd putting carbon emissions backs individuals. Yea marginally helpful, dealt larger scale make small impact. 

So continue virtue signal stay home others spread virus shrug say really matter without coordinated national strategy. Getting mad friends family gatherings lets people responsible hook. Trump says good. best. fiancée planned December wedding last December, we’ve put indefinitely. Really sucks, is. That’s probably one worst parts thing butt hurt people get decline invitations don’t invite things. You’re aware Florida state government consistently trying muddy numbers, right?

They’ve one worst reactions mess clearly attempted skew numbers make trump happy.  Arizona Texas. 

Are supposed believe DeSantis now?

Edit: lockdown skeptic poster. Ignore move on. 70k deaths, seem tragic? person would probably nuke Pakistan 3 people killed.

Not that, 66% people COVID develop permanent side effects like heart disease, obesity brain damage. 

How fine exactly? healthcare gonna massive strain next decades economy gone shit Well clearly terrible person who's immature and, even worse, *poor*. 

(/S, dude's fucking clueless lol) think so, gain spreading misinformation? may wrong suppose, given one activities driving new cases (they mentioned others like bars also problem). Man sorry hear that. Big dilemma you. would think nurse she'd smarter. definitely taken step back human race covid. Ironically, opposed disappearing, pandemic made board game sales boom. 56 got infected wedding infect 300 people infect 3,000 infect 20,000 infect 100,000 around around around go entirely depends Canada. Ontario Catholic boards publicly funded, pay tuition. A+ attitude! Rituals important. Getting chance celebrate important milestone beloved share joy cycles human experience vital us all. completely agree people shouldn’t weddings wedding venues aren’t helping. woman know told either already postponed wedding August could reschedule random Thursday November lose deposit. could see couple would feel pressured even knowing it’s right choice. definitely trend around pre-coronavirus, public schools hybrid remote/in person schedule, fully remote start, Catholic schools person learning, there’s huge increase catholic school enrollment that. wedding bride groom celebrant. Sounds right. see fucking problem is. 10 weddings added math. People care anymore. terrible title comedy movie. supposed big wedding November, Covid, ended small wedding backyard couple weeks ago, immediate family.

Everyone great wearing masks, tons Purell everywhere every precaution taken.

Except one aunt wife's side, kept taking mask off. kept telling people ""tell put mask on"" ""tell put goddamned mask on.""

She's Trump person, hypocritical ""Christian"" well choice, there. 

But type person good chance getting Covid want wedding. Luckily one infected yeah, big wedding right now? incredible. originally rescheduled 9/2020. moved again, 9/2021, reason moved first time. However, moved first time, naively thought America would get shit together now. moved again, clear going happen, we're hoping vaccine. Dice? Game pieces? Talking close proximity? think you’d safer living Chernobyl Normal never stays normal long. I’m 30 I’ve seen world much 30 years . remember seeing video black lady 110+ years old got meet Obama White House. Imagine shit considered normal beginning life 1 day see black man president.

Edit: looking back comment , didn’t sound optimistic. believe overcome problems country virus . may get little darker dawn won’t like forever   simply parents, witness, photographer, translator laptop stream 60 people there. fun great nonetheless worst case scenario would ending like Peru highly doubt we'll actually anywhere near levels tbh smoke ignored flame can't contain. Explained:

- Dumb ""asshole"" death!
- Smart ""asshole'"" live!  trying obfuscate numbers months now, still say Florida numbers need huge fucking asterisk. 

Or pretending DeSantis honest now? get married court low... party clears. Assuming divorce happened lol. say ""No, that, expect see soon upcoming funerals."" Hence said early next year. people told hey vaccine working hard get rolled out, maybe months, lot people accept that, see light end tunnel stay resolute.

If instead told 5 years now, lose hope jusg risk it. Good luck making football game, MLB doubleheaders. Two football game week dangerous. Trump administration actual plan deal outbreak.

Was rhetorical question? Trump administration pandemics plans. And, truly think, administration actions net negative. Cases smh many dead critically ill? American mindset individualistic. Everyone themselves, protests short lived make little influence. Also I've heard governments helping employers covid lockdown whatever money cannot provide employees? possible live home actually quarantine without worrying rent food coming from. That's good reason blowing numbers water. government helping us. think funny comparison, got $1200 (so long made certain amount) that's government ever given us. find nazi scientists make it? Get money back. you’re unemployed still okay spending money? Go courthouse. Catholic schools fully private US? Canada they’re partially subsidized, tuition often around 50% less* cost actual private school. Board games made chuckle. go wedding school? We’re namedropping random gatherings point illustrate fact society whole generally given lockdown shaming random people wedding isn’t particularly interesting helpful more. Sorry example apparently hurt way. tests tainted likely false information  Bwahahahaha! Yes, odds getting high viral load decreases, means odds infected decrease.

If near sick person seconds chances becoming infected extremely low. longer spend near them, higher risk infection. That's surprised we're getting downvotes pointing out. well established now. another example dismissing facts based politically incompatible something?  Penis isn’t stopping me. summary misrepresents actually told links provided. 
In first one Tegnell says dangerous believe masks stop spread virus. I.e. masks dangerous.

In second link Tegnell said masks unpleasant, thus difficult get people wear correctly might work intended.

In third link point Tegnell trying make lot important focus social isolation measures using masks . thing is, belgium's numbers close true numbers, can't said many countries would probably feel bit different worked restaurant industry, owned restaurant, worked restaurant. livelihood depended it.. saying. That's me... person family first hand experience covid patients. course pharm tech hospital delivered stocked pyxis covid area first beds, half floor, month ago left 15 icu beds plus two whole floors 40+ beds. Anytime get invited something social laugh walk away. Ok like im gonna tell there's conspiracy. know much shit China's government got population beginning wuhan outbreak? There's conspiracy planning shit 

Plagues existed since beginning time sister getting married 2 weeks I’ve nervous attending wedding. 

She works nurse, outside work gallivants around Wisconsin Dells Flea Markets. fiancés family members emailed asked precautions taking said “Oh, acting like total Democrats”. 

She’s renting barn venue, space tables outside thinks look better barn. She’s stated wear mask except photo prop. whole thing makes uneasy several relatives older would risk. friends like her, would bet majority people wearing masks either ☹️

It’s truly stunning cavalier is, went far say responsible put bottles hand sanitizer. people wearing masks live bubble stupid. 

I’m stuck moral dilemma giving sister away (our father passed away years ago). think leaving right dinner. 

It’s sad can’t get married court house celebration road things better. lot people might stuck situation though can’t get money back. blame? Again, Florida done much better job deaths per capita one would expect based population density travelers visiting. Blame wrong word this. Praise would accurate. Life hack: bring BLM flag concert claim BLM protest immune virus. hit nail head. T***p campaigning golfing, even Dems side Cuomo fixing cars mansion food lines increase NYC. 

At point leaders meet people halfway, gone since March “stay home stay safe” messaging isn’t cutting anymore big wedding. much drama.

Courthouse + party vote! $564,771,000 $48.6 percent $11.8 Trillion $1.4 Trillion.

I understand trying communicate comparison. comparing total economic loss EU total loss Sweden, contained within without weighing months; however, using percentages like rhetorical technique minimize appearance damage overblow relative harm.

No... point using percentages compare relative impact. never minimized economic harm pandemic loss EU economy 2,881% larger.

And EU economy 2,100% large Sweden's. relative comparisons helpful.

Speaking of, can't help notice respond point Sweden significantly better economically Scandinavian neighbors, implemented stricter policies.

In fact, using method could probably show Sweden far worse Denmark (because GDP latter bit less twice large former) hope rejigged things make lavish possible... venues/service providers weren’t willing give money back would sure extract much value possible. consider friend mine anymore, quite years. terrible person want invite kind shittery life. still get married tho. That's get. need party get married. Multiple bits circumstantial evidence, given magnitude problem, best take seriously. need good statistical studies soon. Hopefully. even remotely important wedding!

Even weddings highly unimportant. thing people congregating things can't wait, like funeral Yep lost hundreds canceled vacation travel insurance doesn’t cover pandemics. Like wtf lol left right politicizing pandemic sure. forms protests, whether organized left right, help spread virus. conservative aren’t getting vaccine antivaxxers, liberals aren’t getting vaccine think it’s political ploy, heck getting vaccine? one getting vaccinated, staying inside another year? one trust vaccine data see says. CDC changed page make prominent, *still* (I believe) attempted clear widespread misunderstanding/disinformation campaign, assuming they've coopted point right?

Because I've seen surprisingly little talk whether they're still trustworthy organisation not. Wet markets farmers markets. They're foul shut permanently. cannot honestly say people gathering outside crowds, even masked pose significant threat spreading Covid. That's ridiculous everyone knows it. reason protest good absolutely bearing proven science easily spread. can't ways. Please send crapp, enough One per family? make list? it'll go instantaneously go viral anyone even realizes happened CFR relevant, number dead divided number infected.

That's ebola much scary flu, even absolute numbers flu kills ton people year ebola. It’s self control, socialization important human need college extremely formative period kids likely looking forward long time. It’s crazy expect 18 year old go class sit alone room without ever socializing, kids set fail. remember it’s like 18? Schools never reopened rules need operate under, obviously many kids going break rules. Would much better fairer kids cancel semester. They're fuckin' doozy daily threads.  still planning ~25k Eliminating virus vaccine using government control require horribly draconian measures, apparently happening. would pick either first two options that. Yes there's death crematorium factories weeger babies eaten alive fun. Please continue jerking atrocity propaganda, ok cia bot?  broh hear ? mean migration banned too? curious, trying cause offence They're also opening everything states despite fact way cases initially shut down.

Morally bankrupt. mean people died Mexico US? sucked eloped. Well, official document... sure you’re mistaking CFR IFR? CFR always 1 since takes conformes cases consideration. sure you’re mistaking CFR IFR? CFR always 1 since takes conformes cases consideration. nonpaywalled full There's nothing wrong farmers markets China. get music festivals back! trouble America everything either-or. like American approach, like Swedish approach.    

I thought go mask wearing first, lockdown second. Even lousy mask reduces amount virus ingested, called *infectious dose*, could reduced non-nursing home fatalities.  concept infectious dose table, done listening people.   

In case nursing homes, world-wide phenomenon, think air disinfecting HEPA filters UV-C necessary. buy deaths occurred due droplets contact infection.   

But, far going ""herd"", think still needs efforts reduce infectious dose. Mine too! best friend going little coronacation 🤠🍻🇲🇽 full article without US done tests last days ever done since started. Stop slowing testing lie.

John hopkins keeps tabs tests date JFC sub fucking funny sometimes. villain 80’s teen movie lmao really needed hug. Thanks Idk google I'm actually disagreeing could last years, I'm OP, sets influenza apart mutates. mutations change one tiny aspect genetic code tiny random change could either make something dangerous or, far likely, damage destroy virus bacteria, influenza mad shuffle takes huge chunk genetic code swaps whatever influenza sharing host it. 

That's get things like swine flu avian flus: flu affect humans pigs flu affects pigs, they're together animal, shuffle, bam, brand new flu affect humans never could got ""human"" chunk swapped in.

Most viruses act way, get vaccine (and still one HIV decades trying, do) protected one main strain likely weak defective mutations they're slightly different, done. reason get different flu shot every year everyone wait see new weird strains sweeping populations year, adjust vaccine fit can, vaccinate that. following year, though, going different again. Yeah, told months ago, saying CFR way 1%. 

Turns out, idiots morons kept downvoting wrong. TP it. Guarantee there's already YouTube videos made it. Guess who’s coming home grandpa thanksgiving. Yes, deadly (never mind youth automatically equal health). words, might finished viable vaccine Mayors Governors finished fun playing dictators. Looks like read get facts check , never tested COVID. 18 year olds? Yeah honestly still practically kids, it’s absurd expect forethought necessary case. Also kids weren’t even mass gathering party, handful kids hanging together, it’s crazy even punish them. 11 person gathering well within bounds social distancing rules almost places earth, it’s entirely arbitrary rule school. 

It’s absolutely crazy expect bunch 18 years olds sit quietly rooms without social interactions, that’s risky school shouldn’t opened first place.  Great word evinces..! I’m teacher. There’s real replacement normal school, online education far effective would be. 30 students. exactly going even hear we’re spread 6 feet apart outside wearing masks? even mention sitting outside limited resources teach isn’t better entirety internet teach with. understand context.

They either eradicate/hard suppress covid, they're cut Australia *because states it*, less.

eg, am, transmission 145 days. Life per normal, many businesses seem booming ""usually would spent holiday"" money. people can't go 3 minutes bar without bringing what's going America.

But Victoria sadly leak quarantine. options are: cut Australia, allow free travel across Australia normalise infections, bringing communities none, eradicate it, via lockdown early days outbreak. three would chosen? yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

So, agree Oxford’s delivery system different chimp adenovirus vector, think it’s hard say Oxford’s Phase MERS makes inheritantly along Moderna one. say “Just flipped spike protein RNA” I’d argue that’s exactly Moderna well moving Flu capsid protein spike protein. definitely say lipid nanoparticles Moderna uses delivery years testing behind point, mRNA vaccines simple past that, It’s hard see problems going come in.  investigate find nobody died wedding? info article, way premature anyway, unless wedding months ago. Trump needs go live TV get one first jabs. many Americans believe COVID isn’t real vaccine injecting us poison things control us. watch scientists talk

How'd get 22? know covid infects disagree with. Silence reason. Western media reports western countries? Oh, horror! allow unchecked protests

How would like ""check"" protests, exactly? ""checking"" saw made much, much worse. Fun fact. PA many southern states already track exceed NY's death rate per capita nursing home thought “oh boy title surely missing important context”

Georgia already surpassed NY nursing home deaths per capita resident. TX FL appear track beat well How’d work out? Influenza sweeps old folks homes too, covid numbers notably worse flu. covid deaths much worse regular flu season?

Because flu deaths counted Covid deaths.

For example .. flu cause heart attacks. generally people arent tested presence influenza virus, currently tested Covid.

So someone dies seniors home heart attack, would simply listed ""cause death - heart influenza infrequently listed death certificates people die flu-related complications

However, current situation, people *are* tested presence Covid senior's homes hospitals such. person tested positive Covid, died heart attack, assumed Covid contributed death *would* listed Covid covid causing spike unusual deaths, explain things like graph?

All graph shows spike deaths. situation described (stress/anxiety induced heart attacks strokes, etc) would obviously account that. say “Sweden well”, mean want Swedish people die, Swedish?

Who nazi now? revealing info care homes Great idea. definitely getting ours, too, based Dr. Michael Osterholm’s recent podcast episode, we’ll waiting little while. recollection isn’t getting flu shot yet says limited period effectiveness flu season still isn’t here. loss like unbelievably painful. shouldn’t shocked point but... holy shit that’s sick.  Population density would interesting research, I’d imagine difficult must uneven spread sizes population centers kill vulnerable people

Ahhh, days. among best insurance get US standards dirt cheap. pay $1500 @ year husband me. deductible, co-pays max pocket cap. give sense, another firm worked at, insurance quite good paid $4800 year coverage 10 years ago. Exactly Amazingly enough, everybody seems wearing masks (or camouflage-print neck gaters least) even rural Eastern WA. context, place waving BLM sign bunch old folks front church get flipped random people driving past. even bigots rednecks seem wearing something faces now. Let put way: Norway Finland executed strategies responding Covid-19, resulted statistics see countries (Norway 49 deaths per million, Finland 61). Sweden, another Scandinavian country, shares similarities Norway Finland, definitely notable differences well. I'm saying is, despite whatever differences, Sweden used strategy like Norway's Finland's, statistics would far better currently (577 deaths per million). would even chance better performance neighbors. think differences Scandinavian nations would've changed that. 

So me, making comparison makes perfect sense, fair comparison get. personally think lot times see comparison made subreddit reasons, rather people expect three nations exact carbon copies perform exactly respects. things equal among comparison comparing Sweden almost region planet. would true never met anyone Americans. Going strange season cancel games half team quarantine Sometimes good enough Let’s keep sending everyone back school, nothing see arguments claiming rest world unhappy Sweden falters translates deaths everywhere else misses key point: Sweden well it’s evidence method successful appreciate that. Good luck well. guess we’ll see side - whatever means.  don’t even know commenting wrote... makes sense. 

I’m saying can’t use data chart make bold claims health economy. I’m saying what, not, terms health economy. 

Go pick fight someone else. Imagine snowflake get butt hurt facts. Hm, France reported covid deaths / millions lower American reported value / million? least according  Man. Crazy. Law enforcement's primary job solve crimes. Focusing crime prevention like ""broken windows policing"" ""stop frisk"" got today. crucial could fuck make situation LOT worse right now. Yea,.this means testing quarantine protocols useless, catching vast majority infected. spread stopped positive test rate 2% quarantine enforced sick. COVID swab test, bill patient gets circumstance $0.00. money patient owes. Nothing go his/her credit report. 

The party hurts hospital get money test paid supplies, losing money performing test. 

The new antibody tests available covered government. Well maybe countries hadn’t banked everything Sweden becoming hell hole death destruction like media people apparently predicting, wouldn’t problem...

Not mention fact you’re comparing Swedish people NAZIS far know, also first confirmed Sturgis death. follow sadly Yo it’s free donate blood confirm. That's immersion programs work. even joke point anymore lmao Yup. Like said, think covid, thoughts. Like maybe covid around longer contagious mutated. case 2 months ago read woman went ER ear issues similar happened us, covid. classic respiratory system symptoms. ear stuff. know people need take seriously days feel like driving cliff. way live. state less 1% positively rate, think time go back ENT see there's anything else do. doctored tried correct issues, so, success? difference make? Mexico US poorly. Article said insured workplace. missing point then. disagree 240 much 400. Sadly first meant physically, Im sure youre about. mathmatically verifiable rare.

26.6m cases. 8 confirmed reinfections. Thats 1/3000000 odds. 

Now consider this. 7 billion world population. 26.6m cases. 875k deaths. 25.7m people recovered. (Im ignoring current active cases doesnt change point.) 1/263 people covid. apply infection rate 25700000 recovered would expect see 97000 reinfections zero immunity. currently 10000x less 8.

To compare people would consider conjoined twins rare. conjoined twins 1/250k chance. far catching covid 10 times rare around 1/3 million.

It's going hot mess get point. fuck up? Lowest death rate Europe today. Lockdowns intended flatten curve, reduce number deaths. Numbers deaths identical say Dr. Muerte (aka Gatell) says opposite. Mexico’s test positivity rate also 50-60% past couple months, among absolute highest world. 

Edit - FT = fuck neighbors’ dog see saying fair. However, thing literally say study observed heart abnormalities 50% group represent .002% coronavirus cases children. Keep mind MIS-C literally inflammatory organ disease, sound unusual half patients heart one affected organs. sure, could tons kids get heart damage COVID-19, study even come close demonstrating that. think study worrying.

Heard memory cells? real question is: naive automatically assume “studies” misrepresenting truth?

Except going on. read actual studies think them. Meanwhile reject study without reading it. 

Also, published microbiologist. aware limitations science also know works. default provisionally accept published results (particularly data though necessarily interpretation thereof unless methodology COVID first started spreading, “studies” told us wearing masks essential little aid prevention spreading disease.

Not exactly, explicitly said wanted save ppe medical workers cloth masks believed ineffective.

 yes, expert opinion changed better data, also mischaracterize expert opinion.

 reason reject expert opinion. Science revise become closer approximation reality. anyone thinks large gatherings don’t cause uptick transmissions “study” says so, naive gullible, it’s simple that.

You think large outside gatherings lead uptick cannot found. people get SARS-CoV-2 protest, almost certainly, however enough offset factors.

That's literally study says.

The fact others found well. assume multiple experts know lying reasons.

But naive one, shake fucking head. enough parents care education sent kids local schools schools would probably lot better. catholic schools great either. know, right. hard people see past themselves, actually people. people like find behavior shocking ones keep species moving forward. pandemic dress rehearsal one completely devastating don’t think it’s going well. Stay safe best wishes One cousins getting married October. I'm sure hell going, mom listen reason. swear kill mom wait courthouse thing... explanation excuse, description consequences deciding say they'll make money year two. Ultimately think decide kill people accept death business, hard question hard blame wanting stay afloat instead. Especially we're talking service industry, we're talking lot local businesses less gigantic corporations. Often people gigantic coffers (or would means build chose greed time instead like airlines) fall back business fails. no, they're staying afloat goodness heart. capitalism, sorts cascading failures consequences entirely obvious staying closed worse us long run anyway.

Ultimately, I'm pissed federal government giving businesses better options ""spread plague die."" even better, give people better options ""keep working starve."" situation that's ass. Exactly, CFR, IFR. CFR always one, keep arguing thing mixing terms, last time, IFR uses estimated real number infections it’s shown around 0.6-1.3% most, surely don’t believe current confirmed cases real number don’t you?

Motherfuckers, honestly. love daughter, cousin, going tell go. we're also ones decided force wedding middle pandemic one hardest hit states. Bonus kicker: dance floor opened, swarmed family friends. bride put mask. Good luck that.  exact story year got flu ten years ago realized mold home effecting breathing real time. Like I’d watch sprinkle ceiling unable breath. took six months reporting health department get fixed. never truly fixed finally moved two years later. 
I haven’t mold exposure since far know. 
Can one event still ten years later? friend delayed May 2020 October 2021. We'll see things then. told need to, switch get closer next year. ""This unexpected. … hit world. we’re prepared, we’re great job it. go away. stay calm. go away.”
— Trump, March 10 2020 

""The vast majority Americans, risk very, low.”  Trump, March 11, 2020 accept applications join family? husband would like apply... got engaged date set late next November. outdoor venue trying keep guests 75 (the minimum venue). Even still nervous agreed elope bigger party later still looks bleak next year. can’t imagine huge wedding NOW. former means person doesn’t need actually quarantine, doesn’t need take work, etc. 

For many, two weeks missed work huge pothole life. two weeks actually unnecessary positive test isn’t contagious positive problem.

Differentiating two vital allowing people still get paycheck safely despite “positive test”. people assume positive test means positive live form virus, non-spreadable dead form. wrote comment article first came weeks ago: 


“Ok got email UAB clarifying article says UAB 900+ cases. NY times combined university cases (239 total 2020, 5 since August 19) hospital cases (733 2020) together. UAB university also large hospital system. Here’s mind wrote comment weeks ago stats changed since then. Same. several health conditions mom still doesn’t get it. mom sister work healthcare aspect still ride ass gathering them. Good exposed didn’t get it. I’m happy them. me- don’t feel like dying age 35 didn’t stand firm. take precautions flu season too. people don’t get it. Shocking! mean... Totally nobody saw coming million miles away. would thought gathering bunch youngsters middle respiratory pandemic would caused increase infection? totally shocking! Utterly unimaginable! world view expanded! epidemiologists. I've saying 2022 since left China. look previous vaccination timetables expand upon account global application. Vaccines start next year, fully implemented 2022, back normal(ish) time Xmas 2 years. Next headline

""Multiple federal agents test positive covid19"" Luckily invited, live ""best friend,"" bridal party, *has* go she'll destroy two friendships.

Her husband trying *months* explain anyone values wedding friend's lives *not* friend. No. venue get warning brief period closure move tables apart— it’s anything like Maine case. called harvesting effect well known effect epidemiology. idea downvoted. hope follow gut. Send wedding gift apology. worth health financial loss get really sick need medical help.
This isnt something take back regret could deadly. wanted throw people reading feel ashamed want “more traditional” wedding. Reddit LOVES dump weddings, many real true reasons. there’s nothing wrong wanting wedding too. gotta say loved wedding WAY thought would. always wanted courthouse wife wanted wedding, one far probably still best day life. 

It’s ok wedding it’s want it’s ok spend fair amount money it’s want. don’t spend outside means people, makes happy! (But also, put planning hold coronavirus control yes could long while)

To owner comment, mean hard feels I’m thrilled something loved! sounds like tagline depressing teen movie invitation 2 kids birthday party. parents don’t believe Corona. invite, said “we different views COVID”. Umm.. it’s “view.” 

They shocked upset “nobody would [our] kids.” replied politely don’t want get kids sick case I’ve exposed. What’s wrong Zoom birthday parties distant birthday parades?! follow Maine's example?  275 guest, 274 cases, 1 survivor!

Last part still works lol use stimulus money selfish ass!

/s Oh, India's great. US try emulate encouraging young people mostly recover get infected covid. Thanks bro Tbf, school, masks enforced times campus (except kiddos eat socially distanced). feel much safer school would event people don’t wear masks. said, *still* don’t feel safe school. sounds pretty anti black lives matter wanna know grinds gears?

How political candidates legally allowed interfere vaccines first place, anyways?

Shouldn't federal crime? *literally* slip by?

It's fucking annoying. patting vaccine coming soon, political reasons.

Am fucking one noticing this? crap allowed first place? Rich privilege? think depends. 

My cousin planning get married July Texas. cancelled wedding, quickly found one would refund her. ended fiancé parents. cost 300+ guests attended. probably paid $30,000 event 6 people attended. What's going really suck guy dies grocery store job, stocking shelves, cause somebody talked one idiots caught it, went grocery shopping. That's works folks. would definitly sensible thing do. Unfortunately humans sensible.... Wall Street famous honesty altruism never making bad predictions hsuband(!)

Still weird say, isnt it?

I think got used saying ""my wife"" year half. Keyword ""unified"" planning living forever? media made one. I’m agreeing you. Idiots. mean, expect? masks clear covid19 days “If we’re sitting desk we’re facing forward, we’re talking … low-risk environments,”

So low risk indoors 25 people, masks, hours time? 

This huge contradiction we've told months. guess there's need 2 meters apart anywhere now. take signs parks trails. need worry grocery store. 

Also, ""facing forward"" comment addresses droplets. Guess still pretending there's aerosol transmission. Social media exacerbated existing issue.

I, one, would actually prefer eloping. Fuck thousand dollar weddings. I'd rather spend time people love. honestly want million people look kissing someone wasting thousands dollars stupid dress. That's uncomfortable. 7th? lol mathematically impossible.

This North Korea level propaganda. Agreed! used think wanted big expensive wedding, stress planning (I wedding mostly planned time Covid 19 happened), &amp; seeing much fun inexpensive elopement was, changed mind.

Everyone different &amp; want different things, ambivalent big expensive wedding, definitely worth saving money &amp; opting less expensive option! 

But course, big expensive wedding worth someone, means go it. think people actually care much feel pressured anyway though, unfortunate. study US, failed testing. 

The CFRs gave Europe.

South Korea done extensive, free testing start, contact tracing, CFR still 1.6%. Sure thing: 


Here general video approach English government officials independent expert authorities tasked dealing it: information English recommendations rules apply individuals: wasnt guy responded to.

I dont like masks, wear them. think many people falsely believe ""proven effective"".

They haven't. (Cloth masks anyways. proof n95 might help bit, used correctly. almost nobody does)

It's basically ""it couldnt hurt, lets it"" kind situation. Yeah. thread judgmental vendors want take thousands us reschedule. 

We’re likely going it’s narcissism makes people anyway. It’s you’re already stretched afford something (that whole family expects have), would cost much another year. true. hate misery, fear panic sub thrives reason keep coming back every day. Fuck knows protest marches outside. went looked many photos videos them, damn near 95%+ masked. People drinking, eating, smoking beaches concerts going wearing masks. Parents send kids Catholic schools schools able discriminate. - partly. Confirmed cases rising testing rolled out, hospitalisations deaths - suggests actual number cases may increasing, number recorded cases. However, concern increase increase low- asymptomatic cases younger people lower-risk age groups return work, university, socialising etc, remain manageable long people careful around higher-risk family members. See: do, stay away sick people get sick. sick, stay away people till well better. know person sick, stay away everybody people fined? hope Possible result schools opening? go back tomorrow seeing make feel comfortable. schools created keep zealot’s children

The reason US large Catholic school system anti-Catholic teaching existed public schools pre-1950s. Come on, even ones stupid enough cowering inside since March figure bullshit lol happen Uruguay beginning pandemic? woman returned Europe attended wedding. Turned bad idea. hell not? We’ve already 5 months. Na worth it. let die, rona somebody open new one. Would like elaborate response appropriate death rate? I've side rescue situation, criteria place reason. People notoriously terrible taking care pets.

""Good breeders"" oxymoron, whatever. serious satire? everything listed run cult. cousin wedding early August. 100 guests, masks except eating (and dancing), staff enforce all. Overall, felt lax. cases thankfully (that venue told us about) can't say I'm surprised simple safety measures prevented disaster. merely create account ny times, get read articles. charge. It’s bare-minimum common sense. way strict even China. announced lockdown Wuhan, people China like ""really? even legal? Would ever work? "" 

You see, 17 years ago , SARS broke out, bad nobody thought locking whole city. sealing whole province. Even Chinese sure whether would work , actually done. people still sure worth it, Italy New York happened. [Edit, minimizing entirity article], but, study linked included 274 symptomatic outpatients 18-34 years showing 1 5 still fully recovered...

What stance taking Coldngrey? COVID harmful seasonal flu? Whats shtick?

If stance ""Covid one greatest pandemics entire world seen 102 years."" Newsflash: wrong stance. I’m misunderstanding you...

I'm completely displaced want return country I've living years can't know I'll able to. hurts heart stuck US place want watch others completely screw around life careless. never cried much year. know I'll ever recover this. know ever get better. Yes, instead got wildly contagious, deadlier virus immunity to? two different health risks become equally dangerous put sentence together?   wear masks?? Link without paywall: http://archive.is/r6OdE US large Catholic school system public schools used anti-Catholic. Court cases back '50s largely brought end. 

They got boost white flight end segregation really exist practical standpoint. think study 60 people (again, wanted 150 + COVID patients) single hospital China allows extrapolate 55% COVID patients, worldwide, continuing neurological defects?

That’s really stance you’re prepared take? unknown cause death symptoms get tested.

At least NY things prevent spread. Maine beat. 1 wedding + 65ish guests + 0 masks + 1 business allowed break state regulations = 175+ cases 3 deaths. friends delayed March October, delaying next August. think it’s absolutely right thing Airbnb won’t give refund unless provide documentation I’m sick transportation canceled something. something like rent castle Europe bring catering money?

You, unlike many people, given functioning brain. don’t get people’s desire put risk social outings. dumb. Congrats! Seriously what's average house house there? thinking migrating possible future much resources actually needed that. need provide people food delivery, medical attention, etc.

You need hard lockdown New York, actually hard. mean, easier locking Hubei province. guys managed that, 49 states might less 10,000 cases. risk-takers. people mortgage entire families life savings put endeavour. people go parents mortgage house risk. lot fail. But, right place right time succeed.

I never understood many people positions wealth seemed idiots, thought finally occurred years back. respects, almost certain kind stupid risk your/your family's future whim, idea, shot dark, snowball hell. kind hard realize that, idea scrappy determined entrepreneur romanticized American culture. think true. starting businesses either, I'm talking like celebrities professional sports players major influencers/internet ""stars"" shit well. least lot cases (maybe even most?) taking risks literally good idea, stupid. many fail. never see hear ones, hear handful succeeded went distance, amazing virtuous people are, look achieving American dream like should. hear Chris Pratt went lived van 3 years whatever auditioned first roles hit big. nah, bullshit. lot lucky idiots. Cool, makes better everyone else struggling /s suggested going outside rotating schedule. two parks within two blocks central city, urban school.

Thanks Reddit 👍🏽 Lmao. 6% COVID deaths real. stupid you? Hence promoting whole work home online schooling bad idea. humans created separated isolated. Good bad news least worse news?! would still test flu. like, flu vaccine keeps completely immune. Oh yeah, definitely confirmed reinfections. said guy Hong Kong didn’t produce antibodies first time second time. guess bad luck? maybe good luck since first case mild second asymptomatic. Albania 😎🇦🇱 understand quickly 20% grows 70% you’re talking exponential growth? bet posted social media right?? always kick America’s ass New York still 600 cases day, many eastern countries. US response abject failure, even states done well, failed. Eradication should’ve goal, flattening curve. Incompetent government, empathy among general populace, thanks capitalism!!!! protests spread it? Yes is, though obviously actual case numbers tens thousands, undetected.

Universities back now, schools back next week.

Pubs open.

The government pushing desperately ease restrictions.

Basically, sane way behave widespread highly infectious disease spread people obvious symptoms kill you. I'm Palm Beach County. Phase II like rest state. Probably like February 2021. calling stupid idea stupid allowed. allowing fearmongering is, got it. think difference event take appropriate published safeguards. Way many people without social distancing masks. similar wedding New Hampshire bunch people got sick three died. spread farther attended. facility hosted went state regulations looking getting shutdown. I’m actually booked lead artist handles this. didn’t really want go back work paying back deposits got quarantine option right felt like it. don’t normally weddings much it’s jobs booked moment scared turn work don’t know future bring. Schools weigh, though, whether leaving students place better worse sending back across county possibly spread infection families might include vulnerable populations. elaborate think it’s mold problem? Guess that’s Trump people think flip it. india, families depend parents usually, provide them. I'm sure see difference. implementation lockdown. conditions vastly different richer countries obvious advantage. course taking consideration vast population difference

Why think India unique special compared rest world? somehow, conditions India special **nothing** world compared against? 

The reality India special all. Poor countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia done better job India has. instead learning countries, Indians seem content wanting find excuses conditions special, unique, different. know you’re sarcastic literally true. one forced guests attend. Id prefer masks crowd outdoors, BYOChair, looks reasonably distanced.

So long drivers behind scenes people able work safe environment see problem here. need take small, reasonable steps figure living covid. 

Hopefully circle goes chucks much overlap circle ""covid hoax crowd"". Universities aren’t online UK? Baffling decision imho This!
MN limit 250 people Outdoor. inside number MUCH smaller. venue needs charged well since ones know laws apply need enforcing laws apply venue run. late. already happening. SUNY Oneonta NY big outbreak. closed person classes sent everyone home. basically come college couple weeks, get infected, return home online classes done whole time. fall going bad US. went outdoor wedding weeks ago. 90% liberals. masks. I’m fine, sure anyone else though. yet effectively controlled virus 300 cases first wave.

Looks like 700 cases second wave.

And they're country almost 100 million people border China. cousin doing, except they're flying Vegas trying talk people going them. Several saying yes. Seems like thing worse local wedding destination wedding major hotspot. Right?? Like genuinely understand people think need hangout others trump's fact could place someone love harm's way. 

I live alone, I'm sad fuck, miss people so, much. none enough decide small gathering worth risk getting / passing virus. got uninvited cousin's wedding end month, keeping date trimming guest list &lt;25, guess. relieved- want go, husband insistent. cousins planning fly state, everyone going hotel. thought dumb ide, elope. do? exposing them? don’t even know names freelancer unemployment bills pay. would like work feel safe country hadn’t really made easy. That's incredibly disingenuous, said long virus exists measures needed. realise ridiculous viewpoint trying walk back it.

Again fault badly presented argument.

If vaccine work normality resume inevitably. Look many people carrying normal now, even hotspots like America. think conpliance would increase long term shows touch are. People despise hate measures, may love hell. Faced end, majority roll dice. Pandemics functionally end 2 years anyway Interesting. Yeah, think fine. want something “adult” mortgage responsible understanding getting into.

Similarly, banks held responsible valuing bad mortgages highly government shouldn’t offered nice relief package. banks made bad trade lost heavily result it. hard time believing PA ahead NJ finally allowed limited indoor dining (last state indoor dining all) going gyms past Friday guess list one interpretation. That’s interesting bad mold issue six months flu new doctor I’m seeing getting tested. report land lord. clear haven’t mold problem since then.  two weeks 1 million students move around country, im student going uni two weeks released comprehensive testing program arrivals quarantine, know think  end fraction

You someone love, someone loves you, find highly unlikely pandemic exposed narcisstic sociopaths world. knew existed, aware *many*. I'm Minnesota. I'm supposed go wedding end September. I've friends people 17 years. really want go due virus feel like might take personally look paranoid. Mid-2021 guess vaccine availability general population. I’m guessing back mostly normal summer 2021. think people cautious much longer though. Many people still wary close others, etc. 400,000 40,000.  7 per 10k.   2 weeks, started 4 weeks ago. won’t. current measures. flu suppress together coronavirus. way back it’s origins China. believe they're specifically talking one guy berated guy previously held position golfing office, publicly tweeted would thing previously elected chief used way ""escape work America goes drain"", golfing multiple times nearly every weekend since taking office, especially pandemic in...full swing.

Pun intended. stupid keeps going. That's nonsense. April 20,000 people tested day ten times that. rise worrying comparable April all. tendency require “catholic lifestyle” teachers. used teach one despite Catholic (math teachers always demand) things definitely table discuss might passable public school. say most? Work reading comprehension. Many most. real number infections peak UK plausibly 100k per day though. (hitting 1k daily deaths excess deaths 50% higher that)

This serious surge joke, testing situation speed/acceleration spread completely different right now. 

I'm quite concerned winter different picture current surge. That’s whole lotta immunity survive colleague mine got fired recently. Went high risk country holidays came back office afterwards, tell anyone. came anyways fired was. Godspeed prosecutor would this... it’d pretty hard prove tbh. don’t even think criminal statutes cover Nobody told contagious:) Sturgis also includes people indoors bars, etc, even reports sneezing contests. Bars probably hotspots. know Sweden read third medical staff tested positive Ireland complaining lethargy months after. Darwinism Covid drama tearing life apart almost like idea rugged individualism work practice modern society. Got remember waaaayy people getting tested daily peak although jump cases worrying, positive figures reported peak much less actual amount positive cases there. I've following increase Kawasaki-like cases 2020 many scientists believe misdiagnosed. Evidence suggests Covid 19 cardiovascular issues children adults. article adds evidence hypothesis.

This subreddit educating people news science Covid 19. Implying someone reading comprehension think US Government educate citizens, like governments done, counter productive cause.

Maybe think US Government done well. Maybe think Kawasaki motorcycle article make sense. think worry contributing discussion positive way rather attempting bring people down, like comment history suggests.

I hope find strength overcome insecurities. agree. terms distribution general population, I’d say mid-2021. 

We need buckle stay safe fall/winter think we’ll mostly back normal next summer. I'm sorry, incivil said??? Yea, I'm seeing friends weddings now. small conscious, good. Others full-on ceremonies parties. Seeing friends weddings, crowds without masks, reinforces decision maintain self-enforced isolation. foolish large parties. Similar situation wedding Maine. There's 3 deaths tied Good. least three degrees quarantine.

As understand it...

The person disease put quarantine. self-quarantine. Government quarantine.

Anyone came contact put government quarantine.

Anyone came contact went self-quarantine expected it. half-assed approach US takes trusting people. believe checked on. OMG, know her, hate her. can't even imagine ""friend"" mandating that. friend group, would one show up, she'd kicked group permanently. I'm pretty sure one heavily weighted inputs IMHE forecasts long since people talked IMHE forecasts. Actually look venn diagram mask-wearing MAGA-hat-wearing almost zero overlap general catholic schools real indoctrinators. award goes evangelical schools. governor telling people want hear. Health experts say opposite. happens indoors, poorly ventilated areas. real problem statistically, maybe one person wedding actually die, likely one.

But creating new outbreak epicenter lead people killed. like ""remember wedding led 15 people know killed? Hah jk, care enough care people know dying either"" wrong people?! 

The Great Question last years “I’ll listen Fauci!”

“Fauci caving!” [that sounds try bleach takes one infected younger person care home worker go wrong. I'm glad then, fully support banks financial crisis. Sure, I'm giving loan absolutely know cannot afford, almost certainly default on, hey, read contract, signed paper work!

In fact, let's remove legislation predatory business practices!! one look forward profiting predictable elements human nature. apparently even asking question politicized. Lol.
My comment downvoted brutally. WTH? Well, venue able fill advertised capacity covid restrictions, they're breaking contract.

This good reminder businesses. signed contract did. can't deliver advertised, that's potentially fraud. Sunk Cost fallacy. main problem seems natural yet mistaken loss aversion. know testing way higher deaths aren’t picking up, really makes scared flu season.

Europe ramped testing, see 2016-17 lilke flu season together COVID? happen October-November? taking super, super seriously go gatherings, regardless trust. “Listen experts!”
“Not experts!”

Never-ending. We’ve actually seen evidence herd immunity impossible quite contrary seen lot evidence is. wedding next month. Going 120 people maybe 12 outside National Park. 

I think prefer anyway. 🚔🚓🚨🚔🚨🚔🚨 [try one.. that! Hope one works you! possible elope get self jerking-off spectacle *your special dayyyyy*. Ignoring retirees best consumers demand economy. Imagine thinking US actually 6 million cases. There’s way number accurate. Remember hard get test back April northeast? Lmao say can’t go back normal without vaccine also won’t take vaccine also even vaccine can’t go back normal Fuckin narc Yeah that’s thought too, don’t understand whole hype behind rushing US vaccines. Oxford one also similar timeline yet people seem love one supposed 150 person wedding 3/21, week got shut California. canceled wedding 4 days prior ended getting married backyard gathering 8 people (My best friend married us, parents there, wife’s mother sister brother law, wife’s best friend husband took pictures us). 

We planning big wedding re-do party original venue October 2021 EARLIEST. It’s worth earlier eyes. definitely are. dying catching particularly virulent flu strain wedding 10 years ago would never raise eyebrow. someone gets sick wedding, you’re murderer sister caught COVID past week 23 yo boyfriend bearing brunt right now. fucking want disease. course show beach everyone socially distancing day Fauci said beaches fine people distance. ""Journalism"" vaccine works drastically reduces deaths, virus, know it, longer exists. Even it’s strictly eradicated, longer functionally exists.

If vaccine doesn’t work current death infection rates hold current higher levels, yes that. So, wedding 56 people got infected wedding dude went sturgis attended?  not, sturgis dude guest wedding discussed?  Sort confusing article... 

6 months, end sight. Quelle débâcle! like already months ""pandemic"".

So US separate Moron storage?

Would explain fucking lot! thousand cases yesterday, bad. local cases rising too, talks local lockdowns far me. I'm drinking wine. right ☝️ exact thing Saturday. wedding postponed Nov 2021.  Exactly, people act like stepping outside death sentence. reality majority not. Since didn’t go, asked. heard wedding outside. Reception, however, inside, person family saw wear mask, besides staff, ripped talk wore nose often, dad. dad wore one he’s dealing sort infection weeks now. Already tested negative, may need get tested someone works kind close work tested positive. guy work, apparently attended car rally week prior positive test. I’m paranoid virus haven’t inside building home since March without P100 respirator on. Yet quite comfortable standing dozen people quietly waving BLM signs last week, wearing N95 mask keeping distance fellow protesters. outside, breeze, everyone masks on. right, problem Covid-19 new us, know quite bad could be. Fear unknown strong, good reasons. one may hard find claim Health Canada. here’s link information request response.

[pdf exponential function limited population pandemic “long strange trip.” feels odd arrive place accepts complete disfunction disorganization. good friend mine said basically grandpa's death. ""He would died either way."" 
I kinda shocked. mom sent picture article local paper basic summary list activities “won’t come back century” she’s treating like it’s Bible. Examples include handshakes, board games, public transportation aka stuff never really gone away. olds always eat stuff up? Definitely sharpest knife drawer. giving social pressure facilitates it. No. private high schools Portland $20k-$35k, cheapest $17k. It’s hard believe we’d expensive Chicago... Yep, they're hypocrites.

Is turn join level? ever happened 'be better shining example world, city hill'? last 4 years nothing (right-wing) Americans going 'But everyone else ahole, allowed ahole whilst commanding absolute respect everyone else!'. dumb. Yea think people going sacrifice indoor christmas gatherings. 

I know will. probably minority. Senegal, man. Dope footballers government cares science people, want?  Took 7 months realize this? much hope country continues well. really one bright spot continent. 

We temperature checks almost everywhere, I'm afraid much help virus spread fever. agree requiring polls: sick people get vote, (here Ecuador would crazy let nurse thermometer decide vote gets counted.). Uruguay already shown handle crisis responsibly, think ok.

Stay safe...and well. Nah, fuck that. Wedding gifts second baby showers biggest scams.

It’s 2020, people getting married 30s functional household decade. everything need functional household, *two them.*

If wedding friends partners, get gift don’t yell you. friends *yours,* get gift husband-to-be doesn’t get yelled at. like people understand purpose masks. ""I care die, gonna ruin special day!"" it’s public space photography allowed. 

Do think they’d get invited private party take pictures show people shouldn’t private parties? Personally, you’re lucky show wedding, coronavirus no. I’m huge crowd type person. I’ll deal means I’m going Mayhem Uproar right either those. Thank you!
Can forward (now cancelled) wedding photographer refusing return deposit, offering let us rebook future date? seems like don't, since COVID spreads logistically exponentially. COVID US doubling time much shorter 10 days well summer, current doubling time 10 days necessarily terrible (in another 2 weeks, could 15 days, 20 days 2 weeks that).  parents tried explain totally fine attended wedding yesterday also plans stay us next weekend, seem surprised we're pissed went. Like...why bad guys here.  Glad work around kids. bride groom prosecuted along guests decided attend.  Inevitable looking figures spain, france etc past days. hard imagine 5k soon, like Spain france flirting 10k

Brits holidaying en masse areas, many rushed back *specifically* bypass mandatory quarantine. 

 Isle man got first recorded covid infection since may one traveller returning. sure multiples infections mainland seeded sun seeking vacationers heading back croatia, south france etc (I know several young asymptomatic one small circle tested positive coming back, anecdotally) 

plus students already migrating uni campuses large numbers w come, schools opening, first week back work push-- Seems unlikely cases least double current rates. 

Though also important reiterate testing capacity, actual testing vol improved localized testing increasing, ( explains heightened numbers somewhat), they're prob 5% actual peak -- seems overall still invariable rise end world yet- mortality remains low. Across age groups last 28 days till today 2 new dths occured. 

Most interesting thing meantime pre winter rapid saliva/nanopore tests IMO, (these could detect flu also) help rapidly diagnose isolate near real time--- keep eye mortality figures stay ~20 / day coming weeks good look,

especially initially hard hit areas like london seem far avoided resurgence, small handful cases per day relative pop getting coronavirus considered moral failure?

Everytime somebody gets COVID, internet bugmen feel one two ways:

\- Happy got fucking deserved.

\- Angry person enough.

I'd like say majority people got COVID unknowingly chances still following ridiculous hygiene security theatres place. responses usually much vile person committed act heresy, (such going rave going beach) I'm also pretty sure one point involved kind flu cold chain ended somebody getting hospitalised dying. COVID different? Yea know either, always get random sense downvotes thread.

My mother law already far gone. trying keep wife sane safe. moments frustration think have. 

It's hard keep people focused people around quitting. We'll, that's growth. buy groceries pickup ( need get store even COVID surface groceries, risk low any)

Not option many places. Round delivery slots collect slots individuals/friends outdoors mask maintaining distancing

Fine summer, happens autumn winter weather gets colder, wetter etc. 

Summer easy measures, winter going incredibly difficult. Add us strictly adhered 6 months, see lot people take a, fuck approach hope best know much would suck delay something you’ve waited long for,

My friend wedding October venue shitty letting move date. put $2K deposit apparently well. Good, hope die. That's it'll take. “They care spread shit, they're tough want, want.”

———-

“Tough”? Please. They’re different Karen wants nails done NOW.  First thought: before? That's dumb.

Reading details: Oh, right, flights two countries straight banned before, actually relaxation requirements. Pretty good. [It Come on, people drink Budweiser. really think taste? Making choices knowing increase likely hood spreading same. India pass all. wait watch. can't wait please go read comment above. help save lives 1.6 million students. This. I've never understood weddings became massive events 100s guests. people even know 100 people they're close to? mind weddings intimate event closest friends family, something invite every casual acquaintance life. still much possible meaningful ceremony Covid hosts may need make adjustments original plans. Keeping venue planned 150 guests cutting 70 guests would allow easy social distancing. mean, still went grocery shopping mask took son walks around neighborhood otherwise confined house  Source(s) : Dude, trust me, real someone still wedding October, entire pandemic caused nothing stress anxiety. fiancé discussed numerous things ultimately decided wedding. Period. Now, requiring guests entire wedding party wear mask ceremony, guests sit family groups 6 ft spread out, sanitizer coming sanctuary leave. We’ve also cancelled reception county restrictions risks potentially exposing people. working small one outdoor event space least families together wedding party. Originally 400+ people invited. sent ~170 invites knowing least half say that’s ok. trying salvage every ounce normalcy can, putting every precaution can. working county health department local CDC reps make sure compliant safe. Ah good point. Yeah, 15 cases, you’d expect like 0-1 deaths. really memorable line. Sad true is. Yeah that's put deposit, least big wedding 200 people really nice venue. Stay well &amp; positive!! simply want believe shit that's shoveled you, echo chamber choice.

Ohh mom can't believe facebook stories! fake! Look going reddit comments biased subreddits get news! soooo much better agree also get news here!

Same shit, different day. Open eyes.  😂😂😂😂😂 exactly think find? Yesterday large outdoor (it still large catering tent backyard) wedding reception. saw catering crew wearing masks, idea guests wearing masks social distancing handled. frustrating see home.

The sobering thought live NY cases low grand scale (729 new cases NY yesterday, 41 cases county). However knows people traveling from.

It's Memorial Day weekend, I'm expecting see stories coming weeks various parties creating mini hot-zones.  wore mask every day work still managed catch COVID, albeit mild go recovered easily.

With know viral load, mask well could helped though stop getting covid.

I hope well spite that. sure getting votes making observation! even said ""people never thought"" means know lol...reddit crazy...I similar experience w/family~ ?? say incivil rules?

Edit. Oh robot .. Wasted 5 minutes writing comment get deleted, guess random keyword triggered since bot doesnt context. Would nice list prohibited keywords least   understandable. generally social creatures, mentally taxing keeping top social distancing measures, isolating ourselves. many prospect vaccine early next year reason many continuing. became apparent would live like another year, maybe five. would see people abandon social distancing droves “Poor people” descriptive words come mind think people break mandates weddings. Selfish word comes mind. Willing. word you’re looking willing. US wanted it, could. know sure, thought remember reading Catholic church got huge payout loans intended small businesses. can't bail schools ? actually smart business move funeral home. Well constitution allows says nothing religion can't government can't establish religion. People freedom right educate kids however want, even home. rest country ignored it.

""We're California""

RIP Alabama

1819-2021 Generally refer ""56 confirmed cases event"" refer people got sick event, people went infect due infected event, on. Fairly easy 15some people get infected, one die, go infect people actually die. Checking Phoenix. 

Our state done good job getting virus control. life, well lives friends co workers, back normal. Biggest exception wear masks. bars restaurants open. Gyms open. Everything reopened. 

My daily routine back March: exercise, work ( field tech travels business business throughout valley), random shopping, occasional dining out. 

I’d say girlfriend go restaurant bar one two times week. works hospital. hospital tested staff antibodies, half staff (including surgeons) antibodies none got sick even showed symptoms. girlfriend antibodies. 

The heat drags it’s starting cool valley. Next weekend big group us going backpacking southern Utah. week that, I’m leading bike trip southern Utah part old job (which back). 

I went dentist last Wednesday another appointment upcoming Wednesday get filling redone. 

Things back normal ever here. I’m surprised I’ve surviving heat outside constantly, adapt. Well get ask for. Nice government step enforce anything anything. Morally bankrupt society. term looking “attenuated virus.” regardless flu shot live virus absolutely cannot give flu. body react way makes feel little crummy, rare serious adverse reactions, cannot possibly give flu. Someone work tried telling relationship closer since he’s married. known almost 3 years I’ve together partner 7. wanna married one day ok married there’s rush don’t see difference married dude doesn’t get it. mean wtf. 56 PCR tests count trace coronavirius symptomatic not, including common cold common sicknesses. Spoiler: Op bear Aunts, Uncles, Grandmother attend, did, that’s already frightening number people high risk. literally info needed watching countries hit first wrong still completely fucked up.

It's like swine flu major precursor outbreak much deadly disease helped us build pandemic playbook detailed instructions exactly handle something like this. /s proven happened.

There absolutely posts people protests testing positive. ignore fit narrative. Weddings 30 grand lol. sounds far fetched didn’t happen lol

You think 18 people legitimately quarantined two weeks wedding? aware make decent PPE women everything expected male default including clinical trials. Unfortunate fun fact uncommon. Thanks. Honesty, COVID worst part it. couldn’t celebrate way would’ve wanted, assure certain people would keep distanced weren’t judging others didn’t give shit...ugh. I’m antinatalist. completely agree, circumstance way money. friend mine delaying wedding November, latest venue push back revoking spot together. picturesque castle like place people still booking days left right. let spot go, it'll $6000 lost. 

I attending regardless, wedding requires working lot different companies, doubt best business practices give full refunds. whole wedding/prom/special event industry taken huge tank covid all. comes protest nobody seems bat eye.

On contrary, conservatives screeching non-stop it. time seem care COVID, seems. think shutting particularly viable strategy. obviously work well wanted last time even fewer people would participate time. It'd also noticably negative effect everyone's mental health, would ruin even small businesses, cause people lose jobs, harm young peoples' educations, etc. everyone able spend another 3 months bunkering room watching Netflix pontificating everyone else selfish. IMO continue responsible reopening, mask mandates, gathering limits, etc. I'm particularly concerned colleges. college students die COVID (fewer die alcohol abuse normally) long term effects, people going college right completely voluntary activity. avoiding something valued ahead going back school, calculated beforehand. On-campus lockdowns would largely prevent large amounts COVID spread surrounding community, would really worried colleges integrated campuses, like NYU. Even worse, openly stated one “really” wears masks reception won’t enforcing mandate “we don’t worry masks looking bad pictures” (spoiler alert: never worried) also sure self serve Buffett totally safe, “if plated dining” 3x price. Like gonna pay that?? sure can’t.  Spending huge amounts money running normally sequential steps parallel. Good parrot Yeah realize lot people shitty place venues deposits. I’d still wary number people together indoors glad you’ll take precautions can.

FWIW know least one person kept venue (it outdoors admittedly) clearly scaled attendance back ended close family. 

My friends moved year definitely free, though. there's alternative: ""only"" 56 cases, possible, statistically, they'll fine (if exclude people part group infected them). 


And they'll go around telling people was, all, hoax!. That's almost worse case scenario. I’m responsible similar situation ended backing wedding. friend super pissed I’m pretty sure isn’t really talking now. backed 5 weeks wedding think part problem. I’m stressed anymore I’m glad it. sooner rather later. Also, $100 bridesmaid skirt closet I’m never going wear. idiots would applauded them....their immediate lockdown without forewarning caused even chaos riskfactors...not ly forseeable also immediate consequences... hell applauded that?!  one thing 2 people dumb callous enough throw wedding days, fuck 275 assholes??? Imagine family group friends... want risk getting married, especially risk days family. knows? 2 years maybe even together marriage would impossible. mocking Truueee. Yeah, make claim Catholic schools public. think we're arguing thing. probably know correct I’m wrong could tourism. mean disrespect please don’t take wrong way buddy who’s Pakistan telling guys dealing lot domestic terror attacks early 2010s brought tourism country. Also don’t think Pakistan borders country there’s lot movement like Europe. Could lot infected people made country ones contained regional lockdowns.  low risk group sure. High risk groups lifeline. comment deeply un-American.

I read comments sub think ""that America becoming authoritarian/fascist."" Yea people breaking point. nationally internationally. family went dancing disco, masks. Cases rising. Unless there's national emergency 3 month lock shit ain't going away sadly Oh, one loony conspiracy theorists. bad Trump's authoritarian tendencies are, pandemics one due rare times authoritarian tactics actually fucking warranted certain extent. Yet actually fucking refuses anything besides make problem worse. Maybe valid Covid 19?

I actually familiar bradykinin hypothesis now. Thanks! perhaps vitamin helps prevent process occuring first place. cheap, widely available, beneficial anyway.

With large % people vitamin deficient (especially dark skin), seems like brainier recommend anyway. higher doses current RDA.  There’s downside spreading type misinformation. shames young people lets everyone feel good blaming others, really increasing risk transmission.

The minister health I’m form (British Columbia) radio recently respond bunch callers complaining people fun beach. didn’t go say “it’s ok outdoors groups” may lead risky behaviour, repeated 3 times main risks people gathering indoors, outdoors. 

Despite people think, scientists pretty much agreement low risk outdoors also low risk contracting surfaces.

Former Acting Administrator Centers Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS): [COVID Update September 6: bug beatable. .... Knowing important mysteries solve. figured out. Cramped places, indoors, poor circulation, loud talking &amp; Atlantic: [Hygiene Theatre Waste See Germany:

Wedding 1,000 guests, masks,
200 confirmed infected. Doesn‘t get shown news, US event does. 

Hypocrisy finest. Sounds like perfect opportunity Flu Challenge! I’ll volunteer get flu “it’s flu” people volunteer infect covid19. 

No takers yet. W E R disagree. Well mom gets watch trying pull seven inch plastic tube throat every time drugs wear might care. probably not. strike type sell mother pimp look cool guys. No, - nothing incomplete study says safe outside distanced. article says protests likely caused cases, major driver spread. venues would still keep people distanced nice see schools closing something. e public curriculum 

Private schools public. teach whatever want. People CHOOSE send children there. one forcing them. Also, think anybody ever stated would cases reinfections. ""getting covid twice rare"" mean ""its rare get covid gotten covid"". second statement true itself.

As example, think six-sided dies. Well use thirty six them. 

We first throw thirty six dies draw circle surrounding one them. die falls one, mark red. falls number, mark green.

Then throw die inside circle. falls one mark another red circle. number gets second green circle.

Then check number combination circles. Assuming perfect distribution outcomes have:

24 Double greens
11 one green one red
1 double red

Then think:

Is rare circles red? R: yes, rare circles red.

Is rare second circle red first circle red? R: compared chance one circle red, chances rings red rarer. Actually, chance second ring red exactly first ring colors.

Coming back covid: fact someone gotten covid gotten covid neither proof getting covid twice rare proof decrease chances getting gotten twice. point time, getting covid twice nothing outcome draw little information from, research required. Lots road blocks testing hangups gave removed. part ""operation warp speed."" close two elementary schools, one served predominantly Latino children, many working-class parents

... yeah fuck poor brown kids. wedding venues refund deposit. wife decided cancel wedding small ceremony local park. lost $3000 deposit. imagine people might paid wedding, would mean they’d lose lot money cancel. topic, love rainbow street! That’s fucking asinine. anxiety disorder entire life, uncontrolled turned 17 got medicated.

People say shit I’m like “*Yes, first time life it’s something actually afraid of*”.

People looking like someone pitying fears mean I’ll never know joy splashing around beautiful waters Fraser Island. could, shown current situation making mostly personal responsibility going well. 

At point admit screwed vaccine. going rough fall fun second wave comes.  Fake news  mean yeah. They're terrible. I'm 33 everyone children getting married. pain. Plus I'm always bridesmaid never bride. somethin'. Looking billionaires increased net worth LOT, difficult figure happened. Follow money. wedding without least three deaths considered dull affair Same! october next year eloping July! We’re definitely stupid. can’t say we’re people stupid train not. True, thing called peer pressure, people claim advertising even works people /s Lol I'm unable find corroborating article anywhere else. grain salt here. bad case Canada. Canada paid public tax dollars. 

Christianity (Mostly Catholicism) also responsible murder, torture, rape, kidnapping abuse 150,000+ First Nations children babies Canada ""Residential Schools"" ran 1883 1996 murders / kidnappings babies ""Catholic Homes Single Mothers"".

I wish USA's separation religion government, even though constantly attack, least guys it. That's important. That's like epitome shirking one's responsibility TBH. gotten predictions right far? It’s whichever returns us normal fastest! 

I’m sure won’t follow strategy to...uh...speed trials up...it may make sense reverse conventional plans Nah, Europe test much US. Keeps case numbers down. Hard identify short space time.

But given risk death COVID, fact vaccine based previous mers vaccine developed past decade. Plus historically string safety record vaccines even rarer instances long term side effects.

It borderline unethical roll high risk groups soon possible still bitching disease less 1% death rate people high risk. 

Also 56 people tested positive, based shitty tests still many false positives , probably much much less. know, keep fear mongering going . Thanks. I’m sure number significantly higher. Queue Darwin awards. Duh, people. What? Yes, agreement still incredibly rare. Time tell whether remains seen, stating fact make one ""denialist"". world needs confront China. negligence resulted virus, worlds biggest polluter significant margin wedding set December. argued venue summer, several folks coming state country want put anybody danger make feel like forced decide. 7k 8k pay fully prepared walk. 

I finally climbed ladder high enough company booked found someone power make things happen saw things way. Wedding moved next December money paid transferred. 

Frankly leave 7k behind. stupid fuck bring loved ones together right now. Selfish. Court house marriages FTW! Well, retired educator southern Maine town affected, good friends still employed there. scheduling students hybrid models nightmare, delaying school two weeks going delay inevitable. see infections rise kids school. read newspaper hometown Texas (I proud Maine transplant), lists staff student infections school. whole thing cluster f, good vaccine, continue way. ever figure bad stupid look move zero self assessment? know exist, PPE lab purposes they're rarely stocked.

It's women smaller people field, unfortunately. Working construction woman limited this, example.

Of course, ""out ordinary"" body type issue *half population* considered ""out ordinary"" systematically designed ""too complex"", issue. One that's statistical logistical outliers. really think happen them. Like yes there's risk small conceptualize. ""Only"" 1,600 people age 35 died something like 200 million age group whatever risk seems low (and, degree, is). Almost 90% deaths 65+ almost 60% 75+.

With said, put one bullet gun 100,000 chambers offered play Russian roulette, would decline offer even though chances small would hit single chamber - gain nothing playing risk zero consequences losing fatal.

Except play virus, wear mask reduce changes play 60% play bullet gets replaced nerf dart.

This easy choice me. I'm playing game unless I'm forced leaving house means playing find home. really agree anti 5Gers old conservatives. I'm lot Paleo/primal/integrative health type lists groups, conservative bunch all, anti 5G isht *everywhere* there, along anti EMFs such. Maskless weddings likely spread virus going restaurant. Wearing mask door seat remove isn’t stopping anything. It’s pretending like is. Done! r/Covid19_Drama fuxk think people report/perceive effect actually work. Low average age, almost old people, serious medical problem gets medical retirement, overweight gets kicked failing PT test gets kicked out. Overall group people fit extreme low risk COVID. really? even context? Typical rescue response surprise. Carry on.  3 tests already? sick entire time all! Congratulations! I'm genuinely happy great day whole mess. won’t die. immediate family won’t die. might even notice it.

But might give someone die, need ICU, maybe I’ll start chain 5 infections, 20, 100? civic responsibility avoid benefit people. juvenile morons start tossing around “oh you’re scared”. completely illogical though. probably fairly reasonable assumption immunity lasts awhile, guy one unlucky caught again. I'm convinced immunity one way new know certain. I'm gonna shit guy I'm addicted *doom*porn he's probably not. Lol, new TenYearsTenDays? wedding DIE FOR. would never purchase dog unseen. That's oldest scam book. $29,400: Woodlands Academy Sacred Heart. God damn home state 🤦‍♂️  I’m really tired hearing brides grooms say “well paid already, choice, vendors wouldn’t work us.” say someone moved wedding year - choice. grandma worth $20k? Yup. stranger’s health worth $20k could inadvertently cause spread event? Yup. It’s sunk cost, always choice show up. terrible choice, it’s choice, stop pretending like isn’t. You’re adult agency.  I'm hearing lot excuses. :) I'm Los Angeles son works county animal shelter Michigan. None said universal true. want used dog. 🤷‍♀️ force anyone show up.... mod little cheeky OPs ignorant comment. wedding weeks ago pretty much things. worried wasn’t going feel like wedding too, assure did. I’m sure everyone attended would agree well. I’m glad way. lot ways, probably better originally mind. stop noticing masks point still able little bit dancing socially distancing people households. lovely little wedding. Sure ill mail one, remember bleach first first cases reinfection. makes sense because: probably going take less risks infection time; takes time immune system weaken; takes time virus evolve; bump someone new virus unless attending covid orgies every weekend. tend forget shirking responsibility side ""deferring"" higher authority  doubt China little interest transparency, mean virus spawned ""wet market"".

The issue remains SARS-CoV2 *remarkably* well-adapted humans virus supposedly made species jump hypothesis suggests quite interesting proposes species jump occurred number years ago SARS-CoV2 evolved current state RaTG13 lungs Mojang miners course many months hospitalization. Then, years later, WIV began studying lung samples somehow got out.

And no, I'm talking ""Chinese publications"", rather quite opposite, credible scientists casting doubt whole zoonotic origin dominant narrative date. Must 275 people showed up. kind nitpicking makes people laugh conservatives? risk side effects generally small risk death COVID19 large think vulnerable groups go first It’s almost like there’s predictable pattern occurring... something wearing protection disease spreading result... I’m sure it’s coincidence. wife event designer rather large wedding postponed June September. got fired refused site bride announced Covid big deal refused people wear masks event. wife refused crew risk. government allowing events, saying ""safety measures"" need taken bs, can't control individuals wedding like that. government needs take ownership along dumbass couple.  impression public bodies less well funded organised Mexico, general education levels lower.

In US clearly lot malicious murderous behaviour e.g. president capitalist ruling elite also huge swathes people know risk take seriously, including people positions provide genuine help. Mexico that? like assume knowing little Mexico. 260 population 40,000! 

How world low? That's third US rate (185 per 10K, versus 65 per 10K).  
 can't imagine strong correlation mask wearing motorcycling. Maybe coming less infected states/rural communities? understand even less based comment. good day, sir. fuck people stupid, jesus. weddings March next year far UK. right lot people trying go ahead. worry next year many bigger venues fold up. (I'm photographer BTW) 

Health comes first imo 😂😂😂congraatsss susceptible already dead. fiancee supposed move Hawaii get married beach back May. we're unemployed, living savings, can't move, lost desire get married time soon. 

Not we've given up, we're sick seeing family friends die fuck reason owning libtarbs. know. wife legally got married registry office, wedding months later. way nice, got special moment twice. think there's need time. Trust me, tried tell go. whole argument family.

But end, hes best Man, hes going go, so's sister.

Either way, im staying away 2 weeks get back. Dang real? source source? pre-exposure prophylaxis drug cocktails, vaccines per se, many benefits think vaccines. still relatively recent developments fight HIV, shift away shaming gay men sex towards actual evidence based medical interventions allowed us make progress HIV pandemic. literally none bad information unless disgusting, subhuman homophobe thinks telling gay men ""don't sex fault get HIV"" good public health policy! choose possibly infect everyone work with? understand it’s shitty situation ton people US government royally fucked up. going work waiting tests absolutely stupid. Weddings absolutely used union two tribes families.. handful instances reinfection millions infections across world super significant. There's good chance outliers due testing issues autoimmune system functioning perfectly Five years she'll blog post announces forgiven putting people's lives risk Well, yes hard. plague plague. adapt new reality want get least damage done. also hard people believe selfish fucktard go big party without mask too. exhausting, maybe keep telling people plague yet.

At least thread anyway talking people going weddings taking precautions protect friends family. shaming anyone walks outside.

You're great taking precautions. feeling isolated reach out. plague last forever. live possibility infected someone healthcare issues come Covid.

Stay safe! Government plans introduce demand prescription testing? city Govt Urban Health Centers provide Rapid Tests free cost without prescription believe effect since month more. I've got tested twice direct contact covid positive person one day prior detection. Somehow tested negative can't believe person 1.5 yr old child neighbours plays lot slept lap playing. still can't believe hell tested negative twice!

Before anyone asks, live Ahmedabad, Gujarat. reason is? find pretty laughable things like parks hiking trails closed governors health care staff actually endorsed . many aren’t masked shoulder shoulder. Surely virus deadly would irresponsible go like reason.  Take quick google search protests worldwide tell done safely. Sure wore masks didn’t distance ""Riots"". Gtfo Hope feels pleased people dead. Yup, can't understand either. husband got married city hall, parents witnesses, that's it. wore masks entire time, kept good distance officiant. still lovely day. always celebrate others later, safer. worth risk. seriously, want wait next year wear masks? I'm disputing outdoor service reception masks much safer indoor without masking, really going much less issue next summer. vaccines therapeutics way, really long wait unless terminal disease something. hiking trails , parks etc closed. people go protest take kids park ? 
 

Probably decisions made real time people answers themselves, along zero national guidance standards federal government? guess, seems much likely governors also weeds make decisions contradict others, opposed objective, deliberate answer seem looking for? 
 masks effective can’t open up? 
 
I'm betting anyone easily explain managing pandemic simple question would imply, would almost certainly come across patronizing. I'm happy help sincerely need question answered suspect intentionally obtuse. WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Huanan seafood market Chinese city Wuhan, believed many origin COVID-19 pandemic, sealed behind blue perimeter fence. large team security staff chases away anyone job,"" said guard black ordered Reuters reporter delete footage recorded near market's main gates. identified worker city government's epidemic prevention control journalists invited official tour report Wuhan's efforts rebuild economy months-long trauma COVID-19. official message: ""heroic city"" back normal back business, schools tourist sites reopened enterprises running full capacity. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* You’re ignorant. Don’t make comments don’t know facts. Got invite Jan I'm already wondering going say let know I'm willing risk health wedding casual friend dude I've met once.. Expense. wedding industry jacks prices EVERYTHING ""big day""! Food, alcohol, venue space etc increased say wedding. say plain old party, suddenly everything reasonably priced again. 

Can confirm: rented local park shelter tiny wedding, tell wedding. Got great deal! Right. can’t sit bar. Bars closed. Well still couldnt canada otherwise would getting large fine Nah. kids catholic schools I've taught catholic. Parents send kids catholic school smaller class sizes, discipline, overall better education provide result. means Covid serious enough warrant death gun alternative violating shelter-in-place measure.

The police barely go day without shooting black man dozen times minor misdemeanor. think police lock people homes would work America?

The conservatives would literally get standoffs police police would consider open season anyone-who-isn't-white's rights. We'd burn fucker even faster already are.

So tl;dr; no, would work America. Yes besides tracking systems crap well apparently. whole load throwing huge numbers websites earn clicks / people stay scared (aka want look news media) etc. Asking families friends risk lives little photo shoot gathering sounds terribly iresponsible selfish me. Also endangering local community it. Especially event harmlessly delayed next year something. Call want sticking selfish fucktardism. did. husband(!) eloped yesterday, two us. We’re going big party friends family one year anniversary.

It made sense live different state families, made clear early willing risk anyone’s health well-being. asymptomatic pre-symptomatic people running around tested? need good test rate, good deal social distancing competent track trace system. sorry deal that. dad sounds stubborn ungrateful.

He’s bad. grandfather taught treat people like want treated. invaluable lesson. 

But Dad’s strokes heroin level sugar addiction controls thought process. 

It’s sad. man raised empathy. replaced empathy “I’m Pissed” list provided Fox News daily. 

He smiles less now. I’ve never met anyone watches large amounts Fox News get happier, don’t get much. I’m sure exist. 

Thanks consideration Blink. Made smile. hope great day! Yeah doesn’t vary heavily county county? One best friends decided go wedding two weeks ago torn. felt like couldn’t *not* go. actually two invites completely told thank you. (They old HS friends rarely see.
I’m good). friends reduce original 150 ish people going 50 held house. mom went wore masks *no one else was* anxiety real ever since lol. Needless say think we’re good cause it’s two weeks reported issues. worth craziness man. Ty stranger. Made morning 😁 charged endangerment custody taken away.  ...and lived happily ever after! shitty parents shitty kids make entire public school system joke? kids don’t homework makes school shitty? realize Pelosi set up, right? Bad news redditors Many places open. depends health department government. love spewed bunch bad information, put ""lmfao"" end really drove home

Question: HIV vaccine? Seriously. people want get married go sign papers throw huge party whole GLOBAL PANDEMIC blows over. Fuck sake. Thank coming witness holy matrimony two people. 


Some make alive. girlfriend chatted, decided get married, small thing direct family... Chinese, normally go huge extravagant weddings. 50K+ I've lost / going lose business shut seem bad now. decided stay closed Dec kind killing me. Thank much needed perspective. point need nukes missiles fight other. invent virus infenct spread country wanna attack. would scary. Bloomberg trolls.

A lot new infected country young people get infected private parties. That's national health institute. Whoosh talk New Zealand? husband talked decided getting married instead 3 years ago, would done courthouse wedding pastor marry us privately big party safe. 

It sucks change plans spending much time planning, getting covid and/or super spreader event sucks more. supposed attend childhood friend's wedding June cancelled, sent save date whole year later. disappointing worth throwing party going dangerous.

His fiancée medical school I'm guessing reason realistic safe it. India number one while. longest time, testing minimal infection/death reports totally bogus. Reinfections confirmed moment viral samples belong different strains. belong strain may belong strain first infection sequenced strain second infection existed time first infection reinfection confirmed. may many cases reinfection strain, 100% sure reinfections. protests take place outdoors people usually masked? sister go? Even sister's husband go. chose go high risk activity pandemic.  best friend says keeps asking God go wedding, hasn’t gotten divine signals cancel. I’m like, signs headlines. I’m sure much clearer could possibly be. Ah ok thank you!! looked map - almost west va 100% agree trade school college school. would huge benefit. ever think Alaska isn’t getting best teachers?? fuck wants live Alaska? assume pay ass teachers go probably don’t get best ones. I’m knocking private schools. disagree catholic private schools. private schools catholic. Theres big difference. says involved plotting pandemic? Still mostly outdoors mostly masked. Everyone mask keep distant, true, there's reason protests caused mass spread unlike big indoor wedding without masks. pErU!! Money. Add ""wedding"" party suddenly everything costs hundred times more. That’s great point. quick search says constant exponential growth would show 3-4 day doubling time. It’s easy get wrapped absolute numbers fall outrage cycle media capitalizes on. Maybe something genetic? Max gatherings 50+ banned, pubs open, table service only, 1.5 meters tables restaurants. 70+ advised isolate themselves, although restriction cancelled soon , since Autumn spike numbers going across board.

There's bunch precautions place well, starting relaxed now. seems like honest. Herd immunity seems working. kids private public. compatible kids premier public school district. costs money. Either pay catholic school pocket pay public area high property taxes. Overall spent trillions schools instead wars deserts. we’d world leaders innovation. Yeah man wtf guy saying?? literally concentration camps fucking Muslims. would never take China US. Yeah Trump sucks honestly way freedom also spied facial recognition technology every city street. criticize Trump much want go jail. case Chinese government. Chinese classmates college international students even allowed use discord. Shit whack Yes. Oh, thanks! didn’t realize virus, feline vampire.. 275 guests 2 families wed ( less 300 brains combined) even one thought wearing mask. Im pretty sure social distancing well since one thought mask. WOW. 1. Wearing beautiful wine dress = $5k +
2. Wedding venue = $10K +
3. Price food per guest = $100+
4. Grandma Betty contracts COVID ends dead. lmao I'd say big party even needed. elope #WHO ELSE SUBSTANCE ABUSE - US birth rates friend catholic church well, hard replenish supply
 - big attraction always schools COVID such, going bye bye don’t seem understand exponential means Exactly. said even put fear mongering media going headlines. Good hear. seen Kinder teachers YouTube? literally like educational nick show! Sorry, thought anabolics inhibit immunological response like glyco-steroids Take man away shock = loose fake news shutdown may put could held back long, country highly populated.The lockdown relaxed extent areas, cases rising quickly mainly rural regions. Silver lining you’ll see majority public wearing masks parent spouse Teacher getting sick tired the, ""well keep kid home want to."" Yes can, that. However can't keep wife home, repercussions declines go back person, technically breaking contract go back person. 

Our School Board voted start year fully virtual, switch hybrid October, already group parents less 2 weeks pushing go back 100% person. regard safety staff addition distorted belief kids immune this. cherry pick data ignore facts, also lying Teachers role year starting virtual. frustrating thing, one leaders group nurse. kind slap face everyone proper lockdown put effort lower curve. Months sacrifice drain. voted bhakt balanced liking. yes zero press conference actually serious press conference wouldn’t gotten elected won’t estimate stupidity common bhakt may would’ve. definitely mostly wearing masks beginning. media intentionally getting shots people wearing masks. look videos protesting rioting, definitely see lot people wearing masks. 'Probably wouldve died flu anyway' [Oh God shut still teach 1/2 semester overbooked could find excuse drop them. work. Time elapsed. Bay Ridge magas making big public stand masks ferry Covid-20 dead arent plenty... stated, immunity whether derived naturally vaccination effective virus mutates...as tends nature.

&amp;#x200B;

Know means regarding vaccinations? heheh!!! many selfish people :-( true all. ~75% vaccines make phase 3 make market. majority vaccines fail phase 3. Please stop spreading fear mongering misinformation. Ehresmann also revealed health officials' recent discovery via contact tracing participant Sturgis Motorcycle Rally South Dakota last month, gathering associated cluster cases, gone attend wedding ""The decision attend high-risk event self-quarantine resulted others getting sick,"" said. ""The common thread stories pandemic, one person's actions decisions affect themselves. need people understand risk tolerance ability shrug COVID mean can't pass others ... none us island.""

Worst plot crossover ever. Also, muh freedoms. yes Commuting two places causes highest risk both. Good luck. Ok would shutdown cause death? poor already, shutdown going change that. know shutdown responsibly right? problem states one giving proper support. implications range ""Oh god no"" 
There goes live expectancy...

To ""crap"" thats going annoying hard produce. die first retarded? ( &lt;--- )

Do want people wear masks sent Jail? ( yes/no &lt;--- )

Are happy called extremist? ( yes/no &lt;--- )

Don't ashamed think! Sing rooftops! Sound theory, average person become millionaire due early life investment. That's money ends spent, saved.

True average person, average person college degree, dramatically benefit 6 months work

It actually save money.

I save 70% take home pay want retire. Taking away six months money would huge 2 years saving $600,000

Yes, would be.

A lot people fail this, sure, everyone does. Quite people really quite bit money specifically take saving seriously young age. example, basically *everyone* 401k 20s achieves this.

The *young* part matters lot. I'm older stayed school longer, opportunity cost school precisely need save much. (I've saving aggressively since finishing school, career path one start later higher income.)

While agree exposing danger pandemic bad idea, wrong say six months work savings 20s matter. That's time extra savings matter *more*. compounded gains investments years bring benefit higher salary later years.

If young again, knowing know now, I'm sure I'd do, set back year extremely expensive, dying isn'tn fun, either. I'd probably actually year acquire respirator filter. wrong people?! need in-person ceremony! legal ""wedding"" court house plan celebration friends/family later actually fucking safe. People damn selfish brain washed can't wrap head around it. grateful stopped shooting weddings amount money would worth risk. Yeah, US (at least state) Social Security office prints birth, death, marriage certificates regular Xerox machines. Charge Sweden densely populated too. divide population area country, that’s rather naive way counting. E.g Belgium extremely urbanized (98%) Sweden also quite urbanized 88%, also high global scale. Higher UK, example.

If Swedes distributed evenly across country they’d extremely sparsely populated. Like one would see anyone else. would suck, almost everyone lives city. Forgive kept India's news applauded initially handling covid immediate extended lockdown?? changed? St Paul SW VA.

Less 1000 people. Trump country. They're gonna listen they're already ghost town anyways. much reopening safely Good , schools public hav nothing religion teaching controls people. Yep, good point. Everyone going roast couple wedding, government pushing schools reopen hundreds thousands students walking around breathing stuff take back parents grandparents. throw money want public school, change shit.

Oh load horseshit. We've starving schools since Ronald fucking Reagan. Money *exactly* what's needed fix problems schools.

And yeah, I'm definitely going tell pedophilic cult get control kids six hours day. guess I'm funny way. Better, wore mask countries would back breathing others spores since march.

Honestly rn there's way someone concert even BLM protest get infected. Masks get less effective people depend responsible. here. many mexicans dont.even belive real virus. tell conspiracy 2 wedding invites day May. Obviously could make one. rescheduled September October still on, despite much higher risk May canceled.

For reason ""unable attend"" now. 

I know much would suck delay something waited long for, know would suck worse? wedding making national headlines due number corresponding covid cases/deaths  people likely going end treating like flu

The flu doesn’t kill 1k+ people day. treating like flu worked, we’d never locked first place. home working, may inhibiting virus

The Government want civil servants get back offices. That's going end homeworking effect. preacher Maine wedding told guests sermon pulpit people wear masks name liberty it, 25 people reception told everyone isolate best 2 weeks prior even got irked people took masks pictures. came fine wouldn’t go back lenient stories like this. vaccinate based strain expect active year. Sometimes vaccinate wrong strain Sigh, paywall. did. protesting would immune. time Oh, you’re one those. 

Yeah, bye. Crystal ball gazing prone frequent errors. Every prediction seen wrong. includes own. them, including myself, underestimates. can't recall ever seeing overshoot. I'm sure exist somewhere, can't recall seeing them. am, course, talking predictions actual numbers, bald statements. goes. predict 220,000 line crossed October 19. November 1 tally vicinity 236,000. year's end number deaths neighborhood 264,000. obviously 'double' article claims. 

Bear mind experience always underestimated. problem *all* usual estimates happen contains lot unknowns given novel virus. also factors human behavior weather simply can't programmed computer whatever modelers great hubris may claim. Wait find real number deaths is. Well, information ever actually fully comes out. girlfriend went camping days ago state park. closed every site probably good 100 ft sites minimum. felt pretty safe (other bathrooms always wore masks tried get quick). Nailed it.

The numbers low there’s way confirm cases.

Not much different Florida limiting tests keep numbers down. question -- people died Mexico US? - answer no, said yes. Per capita enter discussion. think government everything you? People Mexico going partying. Nobody takes seriously even president pleads them. You’re hater. Please come /r/FundieSnark already there. ""Keep throwing trillions stock market"" thing people refuse vaccine, them. common cold vaccine. rely herd immunity, people dont want get it. thing people take vaccine take additional doses years. believe one well studied. There’s many research dollars. That’s one picked. Price ranges 20 40 dollars depending live Charge takeaway agreeing pay expensive college tuition 2020 stupid. local accredited community college credits transfer fine, professors often ones teaching nearby pricey schools. think actually *can* convinced more. already decided they're going think, change opinion means they've somehow 'lost. possible routes destination. US chose 'Privatized healthcare + radicalized sociopaths' route. ...and nothing value lost. Almost half patients MIS-C underlying medical condition, those, half individuals obese overweight. guy charge VA , military, commander chief want it. Trump gets second term doesn’t need vet votes. 

No VA hospitals, handing vouchers private. Hudson Valley here. People still wearing masks inside part, lots free noses, bandanas, neck gaiters. Plus, indoor dining open. Almost one wearing mask outside, even busy streets. beach completely safe reason jackass wandering around grim reaper costume trying scare people. please tell state ""complete shitshow"", far tell Florida kept things open far fewer deaths per million place northeast. Holy fuck. throw money want public school, change shit. suggest like Germany. 3 different types high schools. One prepare trade school, one manual labor, one prepare college. many kids school want parents give shit them. 

I'm atheist, choose public school city private one, would choose private. 

If like Catholic schools, go one. tell people spend money raise child. horribly depressing. Congratulations doubling ridiculous stance. 

Also nice touch referring websters dictionary, hallmark pretentious twat. 

Given already seen patience compliance measures waning, earth think long term strategy. obvious now, COVID become endemic like influenza.

So think 10 years everyone would still tolerate shutting businesses putting thousands work every 6 months instance? 

Or people likely going end treating like flu get things. Especially given dealing virus majority amounts mild infection asymptomatic many. 

You welcome stay shut inside seeing anyone forevermore, us eventually go back normal. vaccine materialise us get life take chance, better miserable depressed forever. wait. Pretty soon COVID-20 COVID-21 gonna become part conversation. happened US states. Made sense either. No, I'm getting bored trying reason thirteen-year-old gamer bro. Totally send message people rural/small town live in. business usual. whole thing plandemic majority population here. Tons anti-mask bullies everywhere within community. 

There several outbreaks community spread. Schools open person teaching, bars restaurants open in-door dining. 30k people county far 229 active covid cases. 

People care. need live lives little Bobby needs play varsity football team get college sports scholarship, Karen needs go salon get hair nails done, Garry needs throw memaw's 90th birthday party extended family US coming (but really he's wants show huge new house brand new speed boat). Oh, forget Sherri... Sherri huge dream barn yard wedding consitsting 300 guests!

To majority people here, virus overblown media stunt dems flu. could careless people. thing matters selfishness. sad. company sent dozens employees health department symptoms, one them, far, told quarantine home 14 days even offered test. called health department multiple times testing employees instead quarantine 2 weeks continue say enough tests health care works, first responders, elderly, people high risk conditions. happening counties throughout Kansas (from told me) sure happens states too, potential underreporting numbers people tested, sure it, least, evens mistakes like one. I've read relatively slow mutating certainly quick flu. positives.  higher proportion infected younger demographic treatment improved US charging arm leg COVID 19 test. wonder much India charging.

Hmmm, might cheaper hop plane get tested India think you’re infected. might get results quicker, too... prime minister modi given zero press conferences since beginning. takes responsibility, comes speak something Positive say. public appearances pre recorded scripted. administration done worst nothing Oh yes, use name-calling can't understand hell said. Typical Gen Z ""argumentation."" Also, ""u"" word. might want learn spell calling someone else idiot, kid. I’m English either, happy play 24 questions 😂😂 Takes little energy research. find Sweden well. said earlier got downvoted oblivion point isn’t Sweden success story. 

My point Sweden strategy complete failure instead admitting trying rewrite history. hope disagree? specific ones defeat vaccines? viruses eliminated without vaccines? really blaming New York complete failure local government? Poverty leads death condition.

Why think wealthy, per capita much, much, much lower death rates? Hope anyone family neighborhood also become No. statistic quoted someone else. Nope, false. depends mask materials, plus person social distancing. still wear mask get infected within six feet (ten feet better) infected person wearing mask. 

Go back school. Yes, numbers came testing reductions. 

We probably shouldn’t talk Florida numbers without huge asterisk. Medical professionals said better protest not. 1 person fined? many many fined, stiffer fine. Minimum fine $1000.00 pa we’ve 2nd strict COVID guidelines entire country

Second behind who? Source? friends pa think coronavirus thing stupid taking mask thing seriously all. I've seen PA's numbers surprise least. Half pcr tests, half rapid antigen tests. guess accuracy would similar similar tests parts world. dumb. successfully defeated many viral epidemics even vaccines. Disease inevitable, matter 14 year olds internet tell you. fans outdoor sporting events outdoor sports general. big pharma become trustworthy reliable integrity CDC?

/s I'm sorry hear that. hope family peace time. I'm guessing far leftist thinks shutdown discussion crying ""racist!!!111""  cool.  sure based fact 8 confirmed 26 million rare. evidence say otherwise meets every sane person's definition rare. get going this. coming silly right it? understand wanting keep business going under, really? Believing scientific methods thing rational.

No doubt since believe ""scientific methods"" happily stand front swinging pendulum know air resistence loss momentum, pendulum never quite swing back far last time.

But one day happily demonstrate conceit, pendulum swing back far enough lose head. 

Because number ways happen far larger imagine. Whether earth quake land slide changes slope ground sudden gust wind catches pendulum certain way infinity ways noone thought yet. It’s probs safest place right Uhhhhhhh True, except case fed plenty money resources implement daily testing (or least far readily available testing, say nothing home tests) everyone, decided ain't important/is state-by-state issue. Altho guess could say things like housing/health care/whathaveyou. Man stfu always wondered many millions test kits available thin air. interesting. thankfully get paid think European, far concerned propaganda US.

American GOP become dangerous Chinese CCP terms propaganda facts manipulation. critic UNAPOLOGETIC USA, like China. Checking temperature every building country?

It *every* building, there'd checkpoint *somewhere* wanted get home. compound closed gates except one needed checked get in. buildings outside compounds checks front door. Villages closed roads except one set checkpoint open. supermarkets, wetmarkets malls required temp checks, places work open. Public transport automatic sensors hardly even needed manpower. Lol, post taking article boats sinking Texas political parade. intentional? Probably bunch old farts friend lists.

I’m grateful pets hobbies.



I don’t want spread shit anybody else. convenient revelation character. pedophilia. believe incorrect. least transmission aerosols. know super spreading events restaurants churches airflow studied. point, CDC share view airborne transmission likely, although still believe droplets primary mode. appreciate many scientists think backward believe aerosol transmission PRIMARY mode transmission. debate matter big role aerosol transmission plays, exists.

This critical limit indoor activities. Masking smart, people eating drinking defeats much that, they'll aerosolizing virus room they're infectious. microscopic near microscopic particles float air hours, exposing others far away long after. 

Respirators, like N95s proper PPE wear situation like this, designed protect wearer filtering inhaled air. again, taking masks eat/drink defeats safety offered. 

I would suggest wedding ceremony eating cost highly preferable potentially costing someone health. Alternatively, moving outside ceremony reception would greatly reduce threat. insist keeping indoors, verify air circulation getting CO2 meter (you're looking keep C02 600 ppm) renting fans ensure high air exchange rate. could also get HEPA air purifiers well. 

Yes, easier hate weddings begin with, nonetheless safety viewed completely independently anything financial. guess don’t believe masks effective comment would make sense. desire get tests? No. county hitting capacity past month so. really confuses India, USA Brazil are

Not unoriginal, they’re ignorant AF. 👆👆👆👆

Contrary ‘wedding Reddit’ generally pushes, people makes happy think make day special/memorable. 

If means small, private ceremony - great. 

If means large party - great. 

Both valid meaningful couple family. Neither objectively right way get married. really sure ins outs things experts correct I'm wrong. 
From I've read, Oxford vaccine particular one promising ones actually undergone many safety trials due already based previous vaccine production something else similar COVID. 
Obviously tweaked bit, they're still proper protocols. 
Not sure candidates, that's least one bit background check, think I've also read something fast tracked due necessity necessarily miss steps, means trials investment amped quicker pace they're able cut time something sacrifice much safety 


Sorry totally non-professional way explaining things lol tried sum I'd read vaccines safety America pox significantly better neighbors (where tighter lockdowns imposed).

That basically 4 week shutdown (not lockdown - shutdown nonessential business only. one banned going outside Italian lockdowns example) Norway/Denmark, think made huge difference economy-wise. Found guy never beach California lol hotspots crowded riot. towel sand there. Yeah, really necessary big celebration this. Yeah nice worth loved friends family potentially dying? Hell no, celebrate one day things die down. too, impact even worse normal spreading event everyone traveled there, spreading infections around instead keeping confined one area. 275 freaking guests. I'd nope 15. miniscule GDP. found out, pretty shocked. comparison infection rate? Simple stats would say otherwise. Quick look post history shows pretty weak attempt projection. 

How /r/lockdownscepticism days? He's good saying he's different, frank he's good actually different. I'm seeing corruption even poorer planning management. Original estimates 100,000-160,000, we've surpassed far. mean there's ton inconvenience possibly money involved. Especially weeks away original wedding date. Postponing usually simple shooting vendors email saying date instead. I'm sure I'll downvoted feel needs said. Everything read everywhere online basically pushes message ""if get covid, DIE ABSOLUTELY"". may exaggeration, realistically that's far underlying message. 

Yes covid serious, that's certain. fatal, absolutely fatal? necessarily. I'm tired feeling everybody thinks get covid, probably going die otherwise crippled rest life. 

I'm saying distance others. I'm saying wear masks. I'm saying protecting others. things.

But please stop making seem like covid death sentence, I'm sick absolutely terrified people. I'm sick seeing another person hallway, turning 180 degrees walking away fast possible passing even 6 feet away means I'll get virus, worse I'll give virus. 

I'm sick acting like societal leper even though regular testing get university shows dont it, cant possibly give anyone else. all, I'm sick fucking negativity see everyone everywhere. Seriously, people's mental health bad enough, none doom gloom helping. 

So there, I've said piece. Let hate rain reddit, deserve. Nope, every vendor one cool. Food said deposit theirs. complained got give 500 back., still 500 credit. throw event use 500....

because zero, what?

Do pay attention news doesn’t come conspiracy subreddits? know, live whole life averse situations likely kill someone, pretty sick fuck, need specify corona. generic drug.. around like 3 decades. one makes money it.. anti-vaxxer means. Fuck hard. It’s like I’m absolutely guaranteeing it’ll happen, better move sooner happy normal fashion. Nobody saying happening, blaming wrong thing. happens pandemics. economy doomed regardless shut down. 

Also, yes, sucks, investments are. Things get shut down. Livelihoods ruined. That's they're called investments certain degree risk. Nothing stable, certainly economy. known cyclical. pandemic might unprecedented loss not. (keyword: should) systems place keep people falling cracks. True capitalism involve shelling big companies letting everyone else rot, stand cronyism corruption hand. inevitable.


This pandemic highlighted proper systems place. even ""healthy"" people, regardless country.


Not mention pandemic affects people poverty more, country going get kind support illness prevents living. work die.


It way. pandemic quite literally symptom problem, going keep happening fix it.
If anything people running away stuck heads sand thinking life good perpetually so. fix systematic errors, it'll continue.
It takes crisis ""common folk"" see it.
If pandemic deadly already is, we'd still problem. 

If anything blame grievances, blame shitty government can't get hyper-partisan asses TWO SECONDS one thing created for: providing people. Considering masses woefully uneducated, change pandemic nearly wipes us out. Corona beginning, seems.


COVID keep spreading, remember way. Many people needlessly die. Wedding already happened bud one attending anyone families tested positive. hey, thanks!

I sure learned lesson sure postpone wedding next time get married global pandemic👍  ""be better them"" mentality got whole world infected COVID. explained poorly. ""Friend A,"" banned masks wedding. Friend B live with, engaged Friend C. Friend C wedding without masks, Friend B scared losing old friend.

Friend B &amp; C want require masks wedding *next year*. People believe virus take precautions spread it. 51,000 cases one hospitalization. understand article. even understand point contact tracing. ask list around. specifically ask attend BLM protest mean look means care actual data spread covid rather trying add superfluous questions data sheets. Also check date link. june 15 2 half months ago. would article New York City months back relevant outbreak otherside country months later. like using fact sunny one day july call weatherman liar September saying raining. Hopefully planning building takeout, takehome delivery. unfortunately losses winter. cousins wedding originally planned July rescheduled September. seeing things rescheduled April. told really wants get married go courts it. things get better celebration missed point entirely. 100% ""conservative"" friends delayed while, pivoted close family only, stream/record event friends extended family. think that's great solution, personally, keeps people saying 'fuck it' inviting anyone come. Easter yet Time play owns stock! 
Can guess stands make money Trump administration stock value relatively unknown medicine? 

Take shot win prize! guy isn’t old shitty corrupt political parties?

And Manuel Bartlett, charge fixing 1988 election PRI candidate could win currently head CFE directly appointed AMLO. turns science-believing liberals good taking precautions deal threat know real. Go figure. Outdoor protests masks cause mass spread COVID. I’m sorry “narrative” factual irks you. people also nostly asymptomatic. flu bad yet I've never heard many people catching asymptomatic actually fight Sister-in-Law kids refused come room daughter’s HS grad party. parents basically told hosting house inground pool. None 25+ guests wearing masks social distancing. Many remained indoors. 

I’ve recently moved Florida Connecticut (yes, know) utterly despise it. parents moved closer brother family reasons don’t really understand. 

Anyways, I’ve dealing suicidal ideation/uncontrollable anxiety depression years refusal hang grad party, youngest niece told would’ve better thing successfully killed earlier year.  selfish avoid people house party. She’s freshman High School. 

So, that’s I’m COVID paranoia destruction families 2020. Good, wanted  Got links (causes death, changes reporting)? Sounds like bunch half-assed BS me. 

My parents work NHS. see nothing mental health issues, non-Covid health problems caused lack regular NHS care. Calm down, champ, reddit, scientific journal. That's fair point view. think wedding shaming tends pretty tame objective. Especially people risking setting infection events SpEcIaL dAY. That's tacky needless matter cut it.

But see coming from. Wrong. Edward Jenner took month make smallpox vaccine got idea it. friends Grandma killers? Yep. Lost job months back third party contractor plant worked taking risks took major CYA approach...a lot larger job sites shut area well...now jobs cranking back (but all) flooded applicants, drives wages down. now, instead working 30 min drive home making $1,500/wk choice driving 3 hours away living motel (with per diem) make $800/wk, stay home unemployment hope wait out. Even max unemployment making even 1/3 previously I'm barely able keep wheels on. Meanwhile, whole thing started mess politicized bickered sides even knows if/when help come millions position. sides pointing fingers try sway public beyond frustrating. funny sides can't seem agree number help average Americans, yet jumped rescue huge corporations needed 3 trillion bailout money. single day's data point useful determining cases increasing decreasing. 7 day averages Texas [trending downward since mid Hospitalizations also **60 percent** since peak July. Yup. employee want get infected Per Trump voters self responsibility. Like sunken boats Trump boat parades fault afford bigger real Trump worthy boat. losers let sink. room fast moving storm parade. schools reopened none kids seemed problem wearing masks washing hands throughout day. like anything else, whatever want smart. Fall fell thru fall proof anything. Please provide credible sources. supposed bridesmaid friend’s wedding yesterday. backed out, understanding it, still felt awful. truly friend, understand need prioritize health safety. Yeah feel like could call 100 random numbers claiming IRS need urgent information updated tax purposes, probably get least one social security number.

This lack questioning credibility new information important ever, considering influence individual parties within individual countries era social media.

It sadly seems time people least prepared deal potential misinformation, yet exposed ever been. Actually, problem calling people selfish *know* selfish. And, don’t care. internalized *everyone* selfish, point calling something don’t capacity feel shameful of. probably joke (well, I'm 100% sure is) think he's sarcastic okay, postpone protests kneeling considered going far. Sorry, Covid done. Sorry, assholes stop abusing protests sake looting.

Thw difference stuff like schools protests alternatives marriage education exist besides large scale person. perfect, health important perfection. Protests racism police violence going centuries. wait perfect moment, nothing ever going happen. interfering? vaccine mutually exclusive politics incentive approve anything early. fact, lot lose so. I'd like sources would suggest kind corruption back take otherwise spreading dangerous conspiracy theories. mean sincerely, bad anti vaxxer. US hospitals got much better treating COVID. understand, young obese people higher death rate non-obese young people lower older obese people. (Often can't pronated.) Otherwise sure. Old people self isolate vaccine shows up. Unless senile old man retirement home, always option stay fuck home wear high quality mask stick nose out. mean, (INTP 👀) however going full year without contact friends final year college little much even me. feel safe outside house anymore. think agoraphobia coming back pandemic reinforcing it, even feel healthy staying inside I'm longer functional adult Yeah, I've heard similar taunts: can't afraid live...We can't live like forever. SMH. went herd immunity tactic, still going guess...

Can't immunize herd people get sick recovering. lead researcher’s three adult children took vaccine voluntarily. risk long term effects way overblown. changed entire way life it

I'm saying good things this, look pharma, Americans understand medicine made China, President Trump trying bring back.

But ah yes, conflate Muslim terrorist attack virus created lab, okay bud. change fact can't run away it. Covid-19 mildly virulent virus healthy people.
I think spreading gloom, rather realistic think many get okay. can't change way whole world works it. done far also ruined lives countless people. instance one patients owns factory employing 400 people. let go 200 employees. That's probably 200 families potentially sinking financial difficulties. Poverty really bad health predictor. knows many sink poverty remain human behavior/response affected economy. 
Another typical example people missing good quality health care due response Covid-19. hospitals empty ""first wave"", except covid-patients. many people miss cancer diagnoses treatments it? 
The whole situation somewhat shit situation largely affected panic decisions. years realize whole impact it. 

I agree need let people know remain healthy, one thing certain, covid keep spreading. makes absolutely sense. vast majority elderly ill alive 7 months ago still alive.  Also thread - properly vetted vaccine. Look happened many medications drugs properly tested. Thalidomide comes mind. true. whole country stopped one little girl fell well. whole world watched soccer team stuck cave. Yet people consider almost 200,000 people big deal compared population. one reasons important people covid speak like long term medical issues having. People need see friends facebook getting sick. need people share stories loved ones lost help make click people. 7?

Thats all? own. gotta look yourself! Thank saying this. family vulnerable even get laughed ‘scared’. compassion meant lot today. wonder lottery similar Contagion non-essentials? too. I’m introvert, I’ve training whole life this. media already said can’t go back normal vaccine, everyone take it. wonder excuse 100% population actually take vaccine  need go ENT doctor get FNA biopsy done CT head neck. could reactive lymph node due infection lipoma said, unilateral painful makes concerned either lymphoma metastasis. I'm attempting scare you, wanted share encourage go ENT doctor logistically financially able to. hope something benign! Well, high number dead US says otherwise.  know year year specifically absolutely see clicking account Google maps, selecting timeline. believe pretty much data collected regardless opt everything (well, almost) see additional data like photos taken certain day scroll through. Geez, ppl. hope worth it! ignorant? sub always looking blow everything proportion. good news ignored here. 

We’re always one step away end world here. Lots people sub seem like want pandemic ruin everyone’s lives right. funny? people scream ""All Lives Matter"" put fucking mask (one easiest things do) protect lives matter. almost there's something else behind ""All Lives Matter"" rhetoric. everybody knows this

&amp;#x200B;

and everybody knows fucking probably check again... deadly virus. whatever king tells you

The CDC told that, nice try tho JP clearly following doctor's orders. 

Also, there's lot wrong JP's philosophy, least way presents public (in books, articles, interviews). saying mental health issues, addictions, horrible diet, ill-advised medical decisions (like going Russia get aggressively treated addictions), all-around bad decision-making result faulty philosophy, raise questions.  I’m scheduled take Pfizer vaccine (or placebo ...50/50 don’t know, nurse doesn’t know, mom doesn’t know) Thursday unequivocally say you’re wrong humanly possible. College students adults capable following clear rules. Oh yeah, completely understand agree, gotten early, probably would felt immunity. general thought I'd fare bet people believe get virus, passes immunity. 

I think meant since new, know immunity one strain, means immunity all, long immunity lasts infection. though, learned past months, even infection I'd take high levels precaution now. both, man Plus kinda academic, best case vaccine approved late year rollout high risk groups first. us even offered late next spring / summer. would coincide end phase 3 trials mean vaccine circulating participants year.

In meantime, vaccinating healthcare workers high risk groups bring covid deaths dramatically also cut hospitalisation. pandemic functionally becomes minor threat point. Allowing significant return normality anyway summer next year anyway.

Albeit strong encouragement continue washing hands, wearing masks showing symptoms mass gatherings like music festivals. people would tolerate exchange removal social distancing It’s nitpicking defines conservative movement’s ideology first 10 percent infection it’s doesn’t matter morons like nitpicking things don’t understand refuse accept protesting fine right?  America longer surprises me. become Florida man. Fine me. Shorter line family. two asthmatic siblings, I’m hoping get vaccinated ASAP sister 15 guests. huge wedding planned cut immediate family best friend. tables separated households, buffet turned catered dinner. Masks worn day. made fancy ones everyone. Everything done outside. done going everyone's typical idea wedding. Billionaire Warren Buffet lives relatively modest house Omaha suburbs drives 6 year old Cadillac XTS. Aw man. cough spring break sent pain soul. sudden body deciding weak painful fatigued time. Let’s hope metrics continue decline! New cases week practically identical last weeks, downward trend might slowing down, hospitalizations continued decline, that’s good! Catholic Church ton money anyway; fund schools want keep open rely taxpayer relief funds. Sure families may able afford private schools result C0-vid, I'm sure church whole enough money prop schools , retain families go , etc.... institutions important them. appeal private donors. wife married small civil ceremony - big religious wedding post COVID. course, we're middle-aged women idiots, fairly easy decision us. think referring CFR, case fatality rate, “Treatment efficiency measure”? correct? 

That’s blunt measure nobody takes seriously.

It work able capture cases deaths. equally wrong. trust me, don’t. Deaths least 25% according excess mortality numbers many cases different countries, God knows.

It’s story world. Countries hit early, missed lot cases. Countries ambitious testing regimes, like US, catch more. 

If speculate second, think lower CFR rate US derived a) hit lot later Europe, effective treatments could applied, b) tests available used then.

The important measure end day many people died per capita. that’s good story US. Calling others “brainwashed” middle rant literally impossible *any* amount people gather safety pretty rich. Ya'll really need get better talking point. lazy uneducated regurgitation point. fall months ago, it’s increasing again. no, pay tuition catholic school unless different outside US. Went catholic school expensive. Many won't. medicine systemically racist.  Exactly. social problem information loyalty. point stating facts others convinced distrust sources. — also, see there’s auto-censorship thread stating “purely political comment”, I’m surprised see people losing trust Reddit, well. ever heard “October surprise”? “October Surprise” could vaccine approval days election. husband disagrees wedding well? Sounds like start perfectly healthy relationship. venue wouldn’t give deposit back. 3 weeks wedding governor announced wedding venues limited 100 people, couldn’t host 200 person wedding. So, yep, venues easy work right now, it’s easy let go thousands dollars put deposit.

And still pay extra $1000 move next year “food prices increased”. Seriously ! Maybe using condoms negated premarital sex Strategy fatal people. say comorbidites fine. Next strategy immunity even unsaid. Last vaccine mostly election purposes. Bragg scaredy Joe wears masks took China flu bravely creating vaccine White House basement lab. 
Oh diversion China Flu dies there. somehow except old sickly things. Aka greater China election propagnada. confusing death rate deaths per capita Media=propaganda That's good point. That's damn good reason leave home. came comment it’s possible wedding right still safe. Cut guest list essentials. everyone wear mask. Socially distance group. wife fun responsible wedding month ago.

Never made sense me. Haha, it’s terrible.

I’m also taking lab power, energy, polyphase. poor TA demonstrating labs, posting videos, use data write reports.

That's bad thing.. increases chance spread others.. “Hitching SHARED ride” Worse what? Malaria? Doesn’t look like it.

Worse people West? Well isn’t worse poorer people less access modern medicine?

Also, Covid mainly kills older people, poorer countries average age lower west, don’t seem death rates (which already low terms percentages) all. zoom weddings bigger deal? Yes, probably miss cash present grab one dies. think that's win. Italy *76* excess deaths per 100k 2020 far. 

NYC *202 May*. yeah, probably ago.

Spanish flu NYC years 2014-2018 287... She’s immortal so-  Since already Covid late March-early May, lost healthy, young-ish family member Covid last month, think likely know seems reasonable us do. pretty serious anxiety enclosed space others since, fairly common experience people gone serious, life-altering experiences like was. 

No one forcing did. 2 adult drivers, one used long haul trucking, big deal us. haven’t stepped foot inside building except house family members house since early March, public restroom last place I’d found right now. story Covid cases spread Antifa BLM rioters.

LOL! Good un. implied die infected. case-mortality rate 3% US. Technically, odds favor, especially high-risk group. said, mean belittle anyone promoting precaution. shit, would worry something deadly?! Huh.

COVID-19 isn’t near Spanish flu lethality though, amount worry Spanish flu today probably higher amount we’ll worry COVID-19 future. Modern medicine, baby! That’s AMLO, unlike trump kkkuunt, idiot paper (specially written opposition goons).

AMLO would never call that. goons don’t like honest people powerful positions disrupts corruption cycle fed said goons. AMLO actually forced people wear masks he’d instantly labeled tyrant goons would arms taking advantage country ends opportunist actual tyrant instead turn country Venezuela. 

Mexicans fucked government hundred years already chance change better breakout nostalgia old times devaluations wealth hacked pieces every two years stupid caricature campaign guy isn’t old shitty corrupt political parties? Ffs. rename Stockholm syndrome Mexican syndrome. write. months vast majority officials telling people.

Weddings expensive, I’m assuming postponed couldn’t afforded it. understand situation. bad disappointing. Minnesota needs much weddings like this. situation Canada fucked. Look conditions reserves. don’t even clean drinking water. Ford managed keep covid cases province low think he’s going win re-election. find unlikely somehow sweden reported deaths significantly greater accuracy excess deaths would much closer US's. Ride die take gas station clerk, much family, nurse two along way. selfishness sickening. Lockdown effective lucky virus weakens short span use lockdown time build medical infrastructure controlled reopening. India doesn’t resources build medical infrastructure people growing restless running money.

Also don’t support idea slowing testing, high rate testing reason curve going up. simply shows numbers under-reported initial days. That’s everyone saying six months ago yet are. ...Do think US population unlimited? logistic population. Cities towns US follow logistic trajectory well, reason believe colleges well. You’re exactly right. originally married May postponed August course wasn’t much better. didn’t want continue putting lives hold, moved wedding parents’ backyard, cut guest list immediate family only, provided everyone masks hand sanitizer. We’re still planning “big” wedding next year (it either lose thousands dollars get nothing return venue). wedding wasn’t originally planned, still beautiful I’m glad able everything safely. think that’s good compromise even though I’m sure still would call us selfish anyway. “All info” it! catholic schools ""free"" long tithe church? throwing money away church anyway, might well send kids school. # absolutely hilarious Hmmm plan actually concrete yet still help capacity issues.

Also lot venues moved events next year. 3 weeks completely unpredictable point. even make massive wedding? make legal one else, wedding celebration/ceremony.

(Me &amp; GF agreed time comes, gonna cozy &amp; down-to-earth) Depends excess deaths ever reported accuracy there. #1. marriage.

#2. adults consented near one another.

#3. Reddit one worst websites Internet. evident constant shaming leftists. totally agree principle, since know surface transmission virus unlikely, vacation non crowded beach cooked meals air bnb otherwise ate outdoors non crowded areas probably significantly safer poorly ventilated room 30 kids 8 hours. day Pops told takes 4 years working vaccine produced, tested, fully distributed public. true???

Are deluding hopes vaccine early 2021, reality won’t see vaccine fully distributed available early 2024? well strain weak, maybe good thing. starting wonder strains weaker now, would better contract disease rather rushed vaccine seems like touched nerve. Truth hurts it... ""welp, dont look afraid dont look stupid - yet are..."" remember sub ever recognizing italy worse US. I’m surprised. I’m glad “experts” told us safe play contact sports, start school person, hang restaurants bars, masks aren’t needed. 

Who needs silly , so-called epidemiologists infectious disease doctors?  That's enough send kid many public universities year, room board included! would assume Vitamin deficiency obesity also play big role well. makes one wonder whether Trump administration actual plan deal outbreak.

The administration literally said states. Federal plan, design. careful. Even though fair, fuck attitude get sick.  Spanish flu lasted years, expecting months unrealistic. Despite frustration, people adapt avoid contributing spread. far. 🍀🤞🙏🤞🍀 isn’t stopping acting responsibly? course. reasonable entail downplaying potential risks virus, entail panicking isolated incidents fairly expected behaviour. get covid smelling candles? know sounds dumb getting groceries saw candle sniffed it’s natural thing realized oh shit. mask on. Sorry dumb question I’m paranoid  Seriously, wedding Millinocket Maine connected 147 cases far, 65 people attending.  went mostly outdoor wedding weekend 65 people, everyone got tested week prior. felt relatively safe I'm second guessing myself. Literally everyone - sounds completely fair. Thanks elaborating! Oh, definitely were/are. small number recent days seem legit, though. Different strains isolated. I'm taking cause panic all--as article majority news immunity looks good--but good know details people inevitably see Facebook panic. Sucks downvoted asking question. still catch virus even taking precautions. Running essential errands, medical appointments, work wfh. Why? point data shows reinfections incredibly rare. I'm saying change, feel ignore data available us right now? don‘t understand schools universities open world. It‘s perfect environment spread virus.

Whether believe government’s measures worked beside point: ultimately, caused far damage virus ever could. cure worse disease...” Please show context makes ok. 

(Hint: saw whole video happened think whole story better)  restaurants forced close refusing follow rules

Fair enough, though majority restaurants bars follow rules. handful restaurants forced close Stockholm, people social distancing

Keep mind lot photos meant show people social distancing taken using telephoto lens, make look like they're closer are: people rejecting masks.

This Public Health Agency Sweden recommending wearing masks looks like job Blues Brothers No. obligated ever buy things people. Right, [Rick?  already least year wait live awesome venues covid. non Jewish weddings happen Saturday get dozen two dozen Saturdays year good weather people already booked venues far advance. common friends book 9-12 months advance. Fair question. definition, deposits typically non-refundable. reasons refund 100% are: first, I've already invested lot time already booking, emails, writing contracts, meeting bride groom planning, plus advertising insurance. also asked band members commit date; may turned work, opportunities, etc, make sure pay part deposit compensation commitment. 50% attempt fair possible myself, band members, clients. hard time believing eradication possible. ever was. Sure, examples countries come close like NZ Vietnam, claimed victory, virus showed ugly face again. Like South KoreaIceland Australia. 

I’m starting think eradication futile ambition. suppression way go. 

Feel free argue thinking. honest statistical question. political leanings guests counties, based regional breakdowns? think lot people try responsible cancel 2020 weddings, there's ton people year also normal people going getting married next year vying spaces. Imagine world US functioned efficiently. say US propaganda? living her, make sure quarantines wedding get near again. US currently ranks 54 deaths per capita infected Covid. US 3.01 deaths per thousand, UK 7.9. EU 7.9. Canada 6.9. measure treatment efficacy. sure want Europe articles metric measure personal responsibility liberal Northeastern states genocidal decision place Covid patients nursing homes. fix narrative! friends getting married next weeked lol. Afaik wedding party immediate families person  #MAGA always fiction anyway. wait six months opening mouth let science play out. Genetics. next. number seems huge comments make look India given failing population. put perspective, 90k India equals 4.5k France 25k US (the dormer reported 8k past two days, latter 40k).
Cut India slack, seem testing like crazy I'm hoping come well possible. exactly 275 guests = 56 cases? 275 cases based cases defined? wedding one person covid case, within specific distance person, person case, becomes dominoe effect everyone would considered case end day. sure came number 56? love Vietnam death, way conduct testing mass scale. January I’d say country equipped prevent this. heard witnessed several horror stories travelers getting treated Vietnamese health care system illnesses injuries. want believe numbers real, way. 

I believe much whatever hell China saying days. Wait... tell *did* get volcano insurance? realize irony here?

those fuckers probably saved thousands lives causing school delayed mean, isolated mostly healthy people.

Main risk faculty, extreme measures them, let students get infected first month. understand can't go courthouse get married, blows over, spend 100k everyone look you... mostly right probably wrong one strain. Strain get thrown word isolate probably used, probably two strains. 

It first reported based sequence (and bit premature time. according researchers, iirc, reported mutation spike seemed likely), subsequent research found mutation makes stable spike isolate better able infect probably two strains. certain, likely.

This shouldnt effect vaccine duo found immune factors serum infected people work equally well engineered viruses without D614G mutation. That’s hopeful sign vaccine candidates development work variants without mutation, Choe says. stuff restricted, need hindsight tell us problem!

Granted, grey areas, like well spaced outdoor sit dining restaurants. Clearly much risky hiking, less crowded indoor seating. That's area need see data know lax strict, restrictions science data based, obviously stupid minute zero (and that's directions. US's sloppy reopening criminally negligent). invite grandma still wedding? TL,DR: There's evidence support long term immunity SARS-COV2. guess outdoor wedding working yesterday also permitted. 2018? Anyone explain? Ok you’re right ignore reality situation whine things fact internet instead. Complain want life moving real world, facilities deal infectious outbreaks time, cannot seal completely outside world. Honestly. think better option. I've experienced multiple ways. 

Weddings super stressful. already married lot stress allows enjoy day loved ones. 

This especially true weddings hold significant religious value. perhaps people realizing disease low risk someone age 60 therefore moving lives? hope pick inconvenient location drop them.

Like alaska, drop Maine. lower 48, straight alaska.

Then allow reenter least 14 days.  fellow stuck rooftop flood. praying God help.

Soon man rowboat came fellow shouted man roof, ""Jump in, save you.""

The stranded fellow shouted back, ""No, OK, I'm praying God going save me.""

So rowboat went on.

Then motorboat came by. ""The fellow motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, save you.""

To stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So motorboat went on.

Then helicopter came pilot shouted down, ""Grab rope lift safety.""

To stranded man replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Soon water rose rooftop man drowned. went Heaven. finally got chance discuss whole situation God, point exclaimed, ""I faith save me, let drown. understand why!""

To God replied, ""I sent rowboat motorboat helicopter, expect?"" knew back February national leaders choose it. “... anyways that’s accidentally killed gram gram” even comment then? Stop spreading bullshit. 'chemist' know better Yup. far leaders haven’t put anything place. mass pop testing programs, pathetic contact trace test system, mass roll hyper fast tests. Even state governments taken strong stances restrictions done done jack shit provide businesses mandated closed citizens can’t return jobs.

So, instead wagging fingers people seeing friends families, maybe actually meet people halfway.  Covid this, Covid that. Jesus christ bit worse flu. exactly fiance doing.

Im early adopter things, need little time others.    mean long wait? I'm talking vaccine anything. We'll vaccine understand long term effects. two things coupled together. need vaccine understand virus itself. I'm talking people gotten virus now, prior vaccine, long term effects them. point advocating staying locked years. I’ve spent lot time Sweden...think probably do. stats don’t lie. Sweden cottages/second homes per capital Denmark single individual households. incredibly selfish they’re out-fucking-side.

No isn't. one. see sign says ""Free Flu Shots"" means free selfish attitude got Florida hit hard Covid begin with.

And think...if government fucking cheap first place, paid quarantine people coming back places Covid-19 outbreaks, think much smaller hit economy would taken.

If they'd like Vietnam almost 100 million people border China, yet 300 cases handful deaths first wave three tier quarantine system (including mandatory quarantine anyone tested positive) government paid first two tiers...how much less expensive would been.

Penny wise pound foolish.

Do understand meaning old saying? that's exactly government was.

And flu shots important, that's they're again. they're important, spend money I've got important things spend money on? Yeah, I’m pretty sure taught medical school. agree leaders comment, ultimately responsibility citizens. even leaders put something place, people would listen follow  :) ok. feel lot people think right way.after all, -10.

In-laws continuously us despite concerns virus. continue make us feel like crap going wrong. Oh shit. reading previous posts? feel hard love it. That’s works ...I think seriously considering leaver it..... &lt;Clapping hands silently worked industry years. Every contract act God clause, let love date pandemic, want to. probably ton people shift wedding next year, many weekends year, shifting wedding year next year makes loose revenue year. Anyways, bullshit, let either reschedule fully refund money. Nope That's sub, 2nd wave hitting harder first?

Not right (but knows future brings).

In March/April, severe cases actually tested. Anyone mild symptoms simply assumed covid-19 positive sent home self-isolate. tested, counted. Asymptomatic cases simply detected contact tracing.

These days, far testing capacity (France 1M tests per week), ensuring far greater fraction cases actually found. includes mild asymptomatic cases. Right now, 50% positive tests people asymptomatic.

The situation right bad. Hospitalization mortality rates low compared number cases found, even take account delay infection hospitalization/death.

However, curves daily cases showing obvious upwards slope. cause concern. That's private testing laboratories. muncipality conducting free. know. fucking deposit cover emotional cost killing friend relative would go wedding, I'm complete piece shit like people. testing = cases. yet campaign emails FB Cultists lambasting Nancy Pelosi gall get hair done wearing mask (and forget buy official Trump 2020 Face Covering here!). call two-faced. 
...and exactly aim punish China? either get court outside China find guilty (but without way court enforce punishment), try China Chinese court, enforcement power find guilty.

It's shitty catch-22 that's way is, unfortunately. It'd better focus thoughts energy something achievable. think lead artist offers refunds bride chooses far one taken offer.  ain’t good Yeah, bunch friends, relatives even happy couple die permanently debilitated would wreak havoc marriage. sucks government made choose. gonna serious efforts wanna number 1 though

Us peruvians dont seem ever want let sweet spot taken us counties don’t put shoes them. calling half baked, nonsensical, witless? ideas show lack mental capacity? civil.

Or say, good job champ idea, unfortunately real world work like that.

That better? need hand gold stars fearmongers ? few. close 25% parents teachers never see. students FOUR years straight (I taught mildly disabled students high school) never met parents.

Then, there's goddamn testing. Several weeks year spent various, shitty standardized tests. Giving them. Babysitting classes teacher give test. Begging volunteers community proctor tests. Giving core subject (English, Math, etc.) standardized tests intellectually disabled students even get taught material (ex. Giving 12th grade English IV test student can't even spell whole name tell city lives in) test given pays money Pearson testing someone like them. forgetting final step people insulated pandemic lots inherited wealth swoop buy bunch foreclosed properties pennies dollar, closed circle economic opportunity continues... There’s post Reddit month two ago statistic seemed show larger wedding likelihood divorce. Technically haves official lockdown reality people social distancing practicing hygiene. 

Compare us official lockdowns place nobody gives shit wear masks enough people care days. That’s exactly dad says it’s frustrating knew lance horse would come handy. Yeah pretty much especially considering fluid dynamic pandemic is. Thanks! I’m glad found way still day making sure everyone safe. Don’t waste time morons, they’re hopeless. Fortunately, opinions also *entirely* irrelevant; influence world, really isn’t worth educate them. going self quarantine afterward? 42%. That‘s insane Sweden 10M people. exactly large country. Norway Finland 11M combined. Beautifully written. here! husband eloped back June, 2 us close friend take pictures. used pics send announcements mail party sometime next year. couldn’t fathom asking friends family risk health safety wedding. Congrats new husband! friend go Mexico come back coronavirus,, Antibodies fade weeks months. retain cell immunity life. know pandemic may 2 year anniversary first date get married never same""

You say again. curious, dream Anglo-Saxon liberators oppressed Xinjiang drive slant-eye, grateful Uigher populace let keep oil? Tremendous amount infections! winning world infection rate, winning much, gonna say ""STOP MR. PRESIDENT WE'RE SICK TIRED WINNING MUCH!"" Believe Me! wonder countries colleges universities. Looks like mix opening schools, July Spain September France. 

Of course France Spain reporting records new cases largest numbers months. mean get mild symptoms it. it’s better prospect getting flu covid  Definitely safer people never covid flight, going hotspot. reasonable chance still immune. Thank you. feel lot better know roadblocks would normally make vaccine take years, removed vaccine; apart scientific process. 

And figured reading comment lol 

I appreciate you.  ""major cause"" though? Cause apparently protests weren't. Whoosh. numbers barely come today. please tell us got canceled far. Good him. probably saved lot money well. contract tracers asking sicl people people gone weddings, protests? asked wedding party like last year cancel cause I'm still comfortable going wedding. can't believe still even happening, considering bride fairly compromised immune system. election swinging way. It’s strong manipulative tactic. There's whole group first nations northern Ontario want mining revenue infrastructure comes hate former liberal government trying turn land protected parks. land environment issues simple one might assume based article. quatorzaine

Wow that's harsh. last time 10th grade. Yeah, mine too. Stay safe! question completely unrelated circumstances story (which week half old, I’ll add). got engaged. We're even planning wedding reception. Getting married park dinner 50 total max year. Spoken like someone sheltered protected mix people outside little circle. wonder could say straight face retail cashier frontline medical worker. Even new strains, strains likely less deadly since viruses don’t want kill hosts, want spread. new predominant strain actually dangerous common flu, we’d fucked time last year. could something worse... like antibody-dependent enhancement, literally antibodies help virus spread around body. America's numbers rising... Sweden falling. month ago Sweden ranked 4 deaths per 1m America ranked 6th. Today Sweden ranked 11th America 10th. 

We're decline articles titled like designed provoke fear hysteria... thats sells gets hits journalism days almost attendance church services. still members congregation feel still risky attend, even extra distancing &amp; masks. say, good worth risk individually. pains read people hopping mad places shut authorities due cases. wrong critical thinking skills people? lost minds? Wedding fancy ceremonies close family friends might well family. reception open extended family/friends. ""Flatten curve"" strategy knew reinfection possible vaccine horizon. poor strategy then. goal outset stop spread, failed country outset (I think know why).

Flattening curve *supposed* buy time us stock PPE, research vaccines treatments doctors tools fight disease, institute robust testing tracing system. government healthcare system dragged feet least 2/3 measures. think gotten better treating it, let's give credit doctors researchers that, mostly squandered time bought us.

Letting disease run rampant colleges universities horrible idea. still know long term extent damage virus could cause young, healthy people. still know long immunity lasts. still know percentage people end developing long term immunity, particularly mild infections. I’ll performing wedding next weekend. Looking forward it. 

Tis season! Didnt qualify direct contact (aka high risk person), thus making necessity government test hook crook due contact tracing? understanding ""on demand"" someone symptoms, relation cluster positive/PUI, travel history makes reasonable suspect exposed virus. 

Based history exposure, wont qualify ""on demand"" since classified ""high risk"" is. High risk MUST tested, least place. didnt come voluntarily, police ministry officers knock door (seen first hand neighbour similar position lol). Lmao Haha SHIT. people. constant attack misinformation foreign actors. 

But suppose argument would get much further. interfering vaccine how? It’s absolutely outrageous people want host wedding put others risk. understand someone’s big day lot planning stress go it, however it’s that. don’t know uncle, sister, cousin took precautions did. don’t know they’ve exposed virus. I’ve respectfully declined one wedding bachelor party. It’s worth risking life it.  Records, emails, lack ppe goddamn stupid Amen. want marriage, wedding. vague plan bbq tell everyone got hitched. Ahhh.... well it’s like shouldn’t put anything past trump either. see concerns come ""But Europe control"" probably amended ""Germany control, Italy might control, France control....""

Though arguably, said big region, like USA. I'm store right crazy many people let kids walk around sans mask. Noted! Though next trip long time now... Eh big party care wedding. want get loved ones together, feed them, get drunk, thank sharing special moment me. rest wedding care much imagine future wife would care she'll handle part. Jacks’ Reddit absolutely useless relationship advice. It’s full spiteful weirdos think every single problem = DUMP THEM!!! got married last week. 25 people, wore masks eating, mostly outdoors. Many us healthcare workers. 8 days far everyone attended good health. Thanks! give example vaccine past decades negative ""long term effects""? gas station better coffee espresso bar. Seriously, grind demand best coffee! wish could afford machines cafe. even posted machines restaurants Facebook site DAMN Bland real coffee shock. Ur ignorant, conversation. I'm serious say try stress much.

Edit: question directed either. everyone giving dumb anti science takes. always wonder one REALLY behind articles It’s weird here, everybody sort agrees pandemic need take protective measures certain point everybody said ‘fuck it, we’ll still wear masks go supermarket I’m going fucking rager sharing drinks joints everyone there.’ ""strains"" different enough see cross protection.

Infact really even different strains. different clades. 

Clade L discovered Wuhan (but likely existed Asia Europe this), Clade L genetic predecessor. Clade ""Wuhan strain"" people often refer as.

Clade mutated Clade V Clade G (G ""dominant strain"", aka S-D614G mutation).

Clade Clade V mostly died out, losing footing dominant strain higher R0.

Clade L (closest Clade bat virus) still exists Chicago area couple locations.

Clade G (most dominant Europe currently) changed Clade GR (most dominant US South America) Clade GS. three clades remain dominant ones worldwide. They're similar, infections result these. Even infected Clade L would immune response current dominant ones.

The novel coronavirus stable mutations similar, primarily based around optimizing bind ACE2 receptors. produced new complete stable strain would cross protected against, appear capable near future. self proofreading code throws mistakes, making mutate rapidly like influenza viruses. can't claim Europe 10 times cases caught.

This exactly antibody testing world shows.

For example, UK 340,000 confirmed cases, according antibody testing shows 3.4 million people England virus. testing everywhere shows thing. yeah, absolutely could begin mindset people have. live wedding venue (work exchange deal) weddings cancelled, we've still ten. unbelievable people would selfish. absolutely *have* get get married year, fuckin elope. wait patient. ask 50-200 people come watch sPeCiaL dAy potentially risk spreading virus.

i'm fucking sick mentality. seen friends family months, i've sacrificed basically entire year. want go bar, see friends, go road trip. people stay fuck home, social distancing, people still partying. could control like three four weeks people adhering guidelines.

i used feel bad cynical trusting people i'm 100% fine it. people fucking suck. r/FuckUncleJack They've already got money canceling booking, matter change date 8 months something

Because means lose slot now. take slot 8 months refuse use existing one exactly 0 couples 8 months think themselves, ""you know, really regret waiting 8 months get married, wish we'd done sooner, book slot last year get married instead"" meaning slot lost forever. thats akin firing gun air, rounds fall back kill 3 people. Negligent homicide, intentionally malicious covid ""denier"" anti masker. Hahahahahaha....die fools, die. 

Also fuck them, bigger wedding, sooner divorce. would count vaccine counted virus becoming benign. girlfriend honestly talking getting married pandemic without party tell everyone covid think dumb.  looking confirmed cases ""more dangerous"" look estimated cases we're still bad March/April/early May. safest month year country wide actually July.

But suppose also depends weddings were, places got hit different times Well asked goes.

Look previous “peak” US, specifically ratio peak cases per day peak deaths per day. 35000 / 2700 roughly equal ratio 13. 

So previous peak time, roughly 1 death every 13 confirmed cases.

Recently, deaths indeed fallen past month, weekly peak several hundred fewer weekly peak early August. arguably past second peak. 

Now let’s compare: peak cases per day second peak 76000, peak deaths per day 1400.

76000 / 1400 roughly equal 54, nowadays we’re looking 1 death per 54 confirmed cases.

We argue day caused decrease fact *measured* fatality disease 4 times better appeared back spring. numbers falling. That’s objectively good news Fired, was. coming her, got. lot used cats issues. shit eat overpriced food. like used man. retrain put toilet seat down. don’t type energy time that. Sadly, know number people would love wedding make national headlines reason. Ohhhhhh! didn’t know part (see username, wholly admit ignorance seek correct ignorance wherever can). makes lot sense makes feel better too. Comparing smaller countries much less outside travel later holidays. Oh no!!! going die! Whatever. US path containment chose ""fuck it, let's turn attention something else"" route end May. I'm going counter this. best man friends wedding 2 weeks. money thats invested wedding since end year, would 3 4 grand. early 20's financially thats large hit. Money aside, masks REQUIRED everyone wedding. anyone want wear one, asked come leave. best mam, feel required ceremony planned mind. best wash hands sanitize wear mask. dont feel sorry people refuse take precautions like wearing masks, also can't leave friend hanging he's willing take precautions necessary. view situation. hi , looking suggestions help mitigate possible problems tht come hanging friends . college student campus visit friends day ( barely six hours ) literally almost manic sense excitement , paid bus tickets go across state KTV / karaoke room six people total . intended get korean barbecue , might order food instead , idea dining seems dangerous still . planning bringing clorox disinfectants karaoke room , wearing masks together rides back forth , possibly even singing masks well , etc .

It’s human gossip. primates we’re hard-wired learn others’ examples. 

It’s reason ***have*** stop see accident highway. 

Of course don’t literally ***have*** gawk, gossip. takes overcoming baser natures so. find difficult others. That's bit extreme, people heavily impressionable that's imperative government keeps reminding people risks virus. There's easy access conspiracy theories plandemic enough articles mainstream media virus especially children supposedly low risk. 

If see people power taking foot gas going same, we're bubble Reddit 99% us understand situation, translate majority society. lot work place transmission still. That’s numbers stubborn  Cause won’t die something fairly harmless. Hope don’t breed gonna idiot party despite health officials' warnings, least try keep small. 275 people event middle pandemic height stupidity. brothers saId shitshow
 Ditto columbia can’t imagine kind spiteful, unhappy weirdos frequent shaming subs, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ wish America wasn’t materialistic. house isn’t fancy. get judgmental comments people often. brought guy seeing made comment. Meanwhile borrowing form 401k pay mortgage subdivision. 

I don’t care people think. like living like this. less stressful. car also clunker.  Yeah, I'm sure either way. venue said fine private company something, too.

The whole thing fucked.  brother work since March (stage tech tour director). mother stroke April apocalypse panic-talk.

And everytime suggested lockdowns might bit overboard *you lot* called murderer nazi.

Think that. one thing American's common selfishness. wife park thing nearly 10 years ago still laugh money spend. mother-in-law got remarried years ago ceremony really fun party friend's massive backyard.

Some big, expensive weddings I've lot fun, feel like cost stress worth average person.  wild watching fans tour close riders... sure hope make Paris doubts. alternative shut down. Again. didn’t fucking right first time. “Letting spread” shameful laziness. People dying. Fuck off.  still remember corpses carried military trucks, crazy stuff option vendor return deposit due unsafe conditions? Okay, guess keep things way are, seems working  aren’t giving back deposits putting toward new date. 2020 couples rescheduled 2021. There’s easy compromise selfish couples struggling businesses coming conflict. 

Though fwiw haven’t heard single vendor things describe, I’d argue pretty fringe cases. It’s tough industry you’ve burned bridges refusing help couples pandemic bad look. 56 COVID cases...so far! think problem sort people going person events don’t think like that. They’re self absorbed point doesn’t register they’ll take responsibility consequences decisions. People wanting perfect wedding since social media. Social media makes look common, bridezillas around long time. Listen actually don’t care anymore. spent months inside since March. followed regulations guidelines. reduced consumption food lower amount times I’d need go grocery store. it’s months. It’s September I’m fucking done man. don’t care shit anymore. Let older people risk people stay inside now. want go back normal life. I’m tired make appointments everything accidentally forget mask people assume I’m anti-masker despite fact took quarantine seriously half people. It’s starting feel like prison. Let people get married. Let people go school. Let people want. stay home you’re risk. I’m anywhere near risk stayed home y’all same. seems like people sub actually WANT quarantine go long time... Best day lives plenty time research illnesses come quickly, gross around, let fully recover September... still send wedding gift apologies.

Something projectile vomitting explosive diahrea always popular. Americans selfish don’t care others. I'm south, second wave hardly hit us all, many people (me included) cautious. Mask mandate quick return last month, still effect many public places, including company. I'm glad beside wear mask (as per company policy), job almost unaffected. One favorite subs. Also love moronavirus. government pushing schools reopen

Our Federal government, tons local (and maybe states?) governments insisted virtual only. son starts school home Tuesday. said considering leaving it, already over. get with. Right. selfishness right arrogance appalling maddening wear respirator every time interact COVID positive patients. guarantee you, thin cloth pieces crap filtering shit. feel good measure. Same. still can't believe people going it. Time start fining people shit. What’s alternative point? opportunity anything else came went late February/early March. 

Assuming website true (and think antibody testing overseas validated previous predictions), 15% population already it. flatten curve? goal overwhelm medical system. major metropolitan cities ravaged disease. combination fear immunity makes outbreak would overwhelm system highly improbable, even without government intervention. experience sore throat cough.. people seem get weak throughout day later notice loss taste/smell. almost always wake sore throat though i'm makeup artist i'm getting really close people really freaks out. one else work seems worried freaked (i left house socialized outside one friend since march) hard find someone profession talk with. united states fuck bad beginning would safer going back work getting worse.

They're asking `hyperbole` final attendees around 80 people, shy think. church kept single households per pew, every row occupied keep distance (it rather large church). Masks required whole ceremony, even let building people temperatures taken. communion, put hand sanitizer front center people able grab accepting (obviously people still chose partake all, fine). reception, prior dinner everyone outside tables kept low numbers. allowed mask sitting table, otherwise required times. Another thing livestream ceremony people unable attend could still watch wanted to.

Netherlands hits highest level infections months:nothing. Worse, Trump’s people intentionally obstructed local response. gossip! Well wanna look really deep difficult find people. 1000 people protest things disorganized rather chaotic someone people often blocks apart despite attended protest. Trying contact trace jumble difficult often inefficient. Going wedding registry much easier find participants find sick individuals get tested see sick. get 8 day old account appears right leaning intent. wanna make virus political rephrasing health service questions make appear like agenda blm bad faith. They're asking around test positive covid 19 back track people locations cases. specifically ask sick person attended protest mean ignore person saying prior testing positive.  noticed complete shift people’s behaviors (going more, seeing people groups, less 6 feet social distancing, looser mask wearing) 3 weeks ago. today, behavior seen 3 weeks ago completely amplified. social media see tons people traveling LDW groups family friends poor mitigation efforts. last night two neighbors threw two huge parties one wore single mask. totally fucked nation fall winter Dr. Fauci continuously emphasized circumstances these. 

At point, government hasn’t done enough, blame individual. People aren’t intelligent; people struggle understand biology 101 (hence college class called weed class, shows gets science doesn’t). However, people don’t get science, don’t even care learn COVID about. thing don’t understand something humble enough listen choose take matters hands sacrifice year. That’s it. would carry us way saying hell all. thing Maine.

1 wedding + food reception - masks- 60 people

Now 147 cases across 200 miles/4 counties State directly attributable wedding including outbreak prison nursing home.

Good luck. 25 year old guy complaining recently can't afford house. spent $40,000 cars last years. still car 100,000 miles. offer loan tools use garage people like spend money. house gotten lot nicer lately  2. live hot spot state - one worst rising covid red zones nation, Iowa. republican governor Trump minion. Problem closing cancelling never it
Is catching us. graduation proms, high school sports going, tons school districts counties positivity rates 15-20 percent school, kids, full time ! Colleges open counties disaster. 

We never closed completely down. 

The governor STILL give mask mandate, prevents individual cities themselves. closed bars ten pm that’s it. Says Iowans “do right thing” holds campaign dinners hundreds maskless small room. still see less 1/4 people masks barely anyone stays home. 

We minority. literally threatened leave it.. enough foresight respect leave type manipulative child naive. 

Reddit full people understand value enough respect leave someone treats like disposable wedding fucking pandemic. bunch dummies... don’t know BLM themed wedding instead would render every guest immune corona-virus. reality

“Everyone doesn’t become hermit selfish” realistic way view world, matter hysterically redditors insist it. Especially officials told us wear mask beginning... Declining numbers usual, well done! doomsayers must disappointed though seek greener pastures elsewhere. ok maga cult lol

whatever king tells Rip sweden  darker skin, take daily recommended dosage vitamin D. One closest friends supposed get married year. fiancé said “fuck it, year wash we’ll get married 2022.”
Don’t see people can’t cancel wedding shit calms down. Like sucks also pandemic. I'm Romania i've never heard . checked said first time congestion probably result false positive. good job upvoting obscure panic articles. educated friends won’t even use condoms church tells to

Lol. Wont use condom church. sex anyway. know 275 masks would made good enough impact? 

Social distancing mask. ~3,000 died 9/11 changed entire way life it...fewer Pearl Harbor....  understand throwing 30,000 dollar wedding especially even religious/cultural inviting bunch people could probably honestly care less want free food open bar. 

It's requirement feel like spending thousands dollars big party one night waste unless millionaire something. 

I know people married small chapel courthouse together 50 plus years. end, extravagance wedding ceremony matter. absolute rubbish hospitals. Two close friends Doctors hospitals hardly Covid-19 patients anymore. currently 756 people whole UK Covid-19 hospital 69 ventilators. peak well 20,000. labelling deaths something else, Influenza Pneumonia deaths 5 year average. Excess deaths fractionally 5 years average present. really think million plus people working NHS gagged case? see much gagging going peak crisis. would happen guys didn’t go? curious. ruin family relationship? another wedding go soon obligated go.. also like, “fuck this, health important”. measure treatment efficacy

Is though? US performs significantly tests per capita Europe (a good thing) means catch infected people get larger divisor. many countries also rather strict restrictions gets tested (you need show prominent symptoms and/or part risk group), means milder cases increase death toll go uncounted. I'm saying factors treatment efficacy going number simple saying get virus US 2.5 times likely survive Europe. also puts countries like Iraq, Somalia DRC ahead US, tell something up. you’re saying want cake eat it. want safety catching covid yet aren’t willing population temporarily sacrifice personal freedom movement months secure it. Sounds dumb me. Look dude?! He's obviously Wuhan. fault virus. Oh, wait minute! Ummmm, mean virus hoax! unlikely cover both. ""strains"" similar. need worry that. UK, Italy Spain next REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Way shift blame responsibility youth. Way go “adults” intend , dont anywhere go anyways . two friends “essential workers”? ( mean . work fast food convenience stores :-/ ) return work . cannot really speak rest , part Going Groceries / Food crowd . like first indoor public space outing months ( hung outside parks hhh ) sister held wedding July Michigan. Reduced guest list 100, held reception outdoors, usher made sure people socially distanced church wearing masks. wedding tbh, would’ve lost deposit. reception, however, quickly went rails.

Most people smart responsible people couldn’t keep guidelines saw friends, family booze. Luckily nothing came everyone tested days prior, even felt super irresponsible worried days afterwards. seemed like everyone extra rowdy well they’d cooped long. don’t think there’s way right now, even try keep distanced precautions take? size guest list? Genuinely curious! Coronavirus: May name address please? optimistic terrible person. assholes thought first fellow human beimgs(especially risk) last. like wedding people attended didn’t die infected 3 people die. DONT WANNA DIE TOU WENT WEDDING. Good wedding pictures help everyone remember lost. Look nba athletes gotten it. Many dropping career highs playing absolutely great. Good, season anyway..  know much would suck delay something waited long for

I know too, rest world point. Anyone says plans can't wait selfish entitled. Amazing work. Unfortunately no, case. voluntarily called 104 emergency number provided covid related cases supposed testing stuff since tasted child came contact dhit tracing contacts. voluntarily call come doorstep test refused saying already many requests conduct test suggested visit urban center get tested. 

But thing decide whether wanted get tested not. Even ask single question getting tested. filled name, address, contact number, age ready go test.

While free rapid testing quite boon, horrible way managing quite scary since many people skip test altogether fear getting quarantined. Pathetic! serve bleach wedding cocktail. proposed April. wedding end May. None friends attended, total 9 people including us photographer. Venue nice neighborhood lake, neighbors peered lake otherwise socially distant. 

We want bigger wedding don’t know happen. brother got married July extremely close did. original guest list around 300 people made massive cuts along precautions reduce risk much possible. make people “uninvited”, they’re planning “anniversary wedding” next year original guest list, assuming things reasonable then. cases wedding!  everything right responsible, I’m afraid dying. age health it’s &lt;0.1%. could imagine one really susceptible groups right now. Life must nightmare. I’m sorry anyone going it. don’t know guys, people r/conspiracy told masks don’t work controlled media 

/s Yeah, anything — immune responses occur biological spectrum intensity. expect reinfections healthy individuals beyond insane; serious doctor scientist could ever expected that. god’s sake, even MEASLES cause symptomatic reinfections rare occasions.

Unfortunately, sub isn’t exactly filled people educated medicine sciences (to put lightly), nuance going lost many. “It’s almost old people die, they’re going die soon anyway, what’s big deal?” That’s mindset. pandemic started India one lab could handle COVID tests, one. Testing facilities dont magically popup thin air. need time set people need trained handle administer tests. Minnesotan, I’m disappointed cultural social situation age think. married 2018 38, interest gifts given. Never bought mates wedding gifts either. Finding time busy lives come together, celebrate recovery about. I’m going shut down. It’s obvious haven’t read study controlling reliable vs unreliable tester important factor. Mischel’s earlier studies found establishing trust important child’s decision making. Part Stanford Marshmallow Experiment involved concerted effort establish trust children performing experiment. fact there’s studies looking exact topic criticism original Stanford marshmallow experiment. 

So appreciate opinion, probably shouldn’t voice paper citing evidence says contrary. need travel 60 miles know traveling 60 mph. scientists looking mutation rate calculations. death organized religion best possible outcome entire virus. Civility something they've paid into, get none.""

It's sickening. Ah shit. Don’t tell trump he’s number one.... Im sure didnt helped covid made assholes act even asshole, know, i'm asshole terrible. According media outdoor protests don’t spread covid. that’s case outdoor events good go.  I'm wondering thought: ""Oh, means I'm immune catching now?"" went life normal correlation, attempts control ample, obvious confounding factors non-existent (maybe impossible), attempt draw conclusions whether rallies cause case growth among rally attendees even generally hold water. Herd immunity working? know plenty people send children catholic schools public schools (especially cities) joke. Getting rid harm good. bottom line robots solely exist perform tasks employers. live roughly 2/3 lives outside job, time employers start recognizing there's lot people willing sacrifice majority lives employers accommodating employees wildly varying situations home. 772 infections tied University Alabama's medical school? What's going there? wonder annual M1/M2 social? Yeah thinking thing! that's whole reason Sweden lost 6.000 ? Interesting comment.. don’t mind religion, religious people start trying make everyone else live “values” (many preach, certainly don’t practice). schools created keep zealot’s children bubble don’t experience outside ideas start see hypocrisy religion. Good riddance schools. admit many students knowing can’t handle capacity. don’t hire enough faculty you’re planning expel certain number students. don’t issue refunds. That’s scam. exactly comparing yes is. Ok, going downvote that's kind mean. also made laugh true. earth manage catch twice unless somehow putting harms' way (or working high risk job, case... Yikes) get discussion regarding shape earth.

I know hard admit Earth flat. Yeah, fact vaccines might protect Wuhan strain ""the strain ate Europe"" concern. Italy. Don’t worry though, current pace US days overtaking them. mildly amusing reading ""first person receive vaccine trial"" stories, person featured might well receiving placebo protesters definitely cramming onto public transit, cramming other's apartments homes, etc. Give break. Calm down, Don. Gosh can’t imagine life like new strains come quickly. entire country already messed right is. someone showed EDs ICUs NJ, tested flu first COVID, mostly COVID tests. became available, tested simultaneously. think forgot include area Greenland calculated population density Denmark.

Or perhaps include land area next uninhabited realise population dencity whole nation good measure. really comes many lives cities dence cities distance less relevant spread virus. comes Sweden? I'm expecting schools Boston go home Halloween. I'll surprised old ""I'm going let virus stop living life!"" rallying cry. Yeah, give shit virus stopping somebody else living theirs. brave prosecutor would file charge manslaughter, even seemed unwinnable, maybe would stop. work public language school. students adults, uni students retired people, mostly professionals 30s 40s. makes absolutely sense us teaching in-person classes pandemic. government can't let us work home colleagues Primary Secondary education forced go work, would unfair, guess. So... yeah.

25 adult students regular classroom hours time, could go wrong?  What's worse idiots breed. 2.5 3 times populated country. Mexico slightly worse, then. reddit comment told it’s hoax! rediculous Facebook post lot Evangelical Americans posting Israel cure virus media sharing this? kept getting regurgitated again. 

I'm sure hillbilly -God fearing cousin totally shocked read article. Ehhhh kidding fake news them! Hell even good reading skills, probably comprehend article anyway.... much cure. - bottom line Catholic Church big trouble US COVID nothing it. Decades protecting pedophiles  time ready trial, wasn’t enough infected UK test against.

The US also starts trials Oxford vaccine soon, hasn’t already. Oh yes. yes, aware. Especially six foot ""rule"" almost century old begin with. Source?

Most places saw said social distance. Health organizations recommended going runs stay healthy. Go walks. Get hike woods family. go playground areas congregate groups. to, likes store, wear mask. analysis available OECD data U.S. similarly large wealthy countries finds infant mortality adjusted include infant deaths meet minimum threshold 22 weeks gestation 500g birth weight, U.S. infant mortality rate still higher average comparable countries available data (4.9).

4.9 vs 2.2 still absolute fucking disaster Congratulations, hope rest population make one year mark also dangerous. first year every :) Check link below, rising? 

source: logarithmic data... flattened curve June 27th Canada paid GM 3 point odd BILLION DOLLARS.... 2008. mega rich corporation. FUCK THAT. PISS OFF!!!! 

Not restaurant owners trying get by. 


Give head shake. going phased first world.

You tolerated time, eventually kicked memberships organizations leaving willingly, dollar collapses (likely 2024 so) nothing left, alone. Pretty much everyone got polio around time vaccine came out, didnt beat it, beating cholera making better water treatment centers. went cousins funeral month ago. sadly died reasons unrelated covid. approx 20 people attended. Every single person wore mask. Nobody hugged. Nobody stood close together. we’re healthy. fucking sucked able hug family way right. oh yea, indeed. totally forgot that. 

so still boils actual death rate order figure proportion. Except half Americans refuse vaccine unless see better numbers safe and/or make companies producing liable causes awful side effects long gatherings follow local guidelines, call weddings selfish? wedding next month decision postpone took literally second. downsize comply state guidance - limit 25 people, enough immediate family couple friends.

Come hell high water getting married date we've looking forward year now. smug, petty attitude ignores fact Florida 644,000 infections 11,000 deaths. seeing declines, good thing, before. Back Summer, lockdown ended, weeks declines followed big surge recently started seeing drop off. 

Infections, lagging deaths, appear right away. Schools opened Labor day weekend underway; next several weeks could begin see surge again. 

I see people wearing masks public area. people Florida same, decline reported maybe result that. We'll see well schools implement guidelines, well Floridians continue following guidelines Labor day celebrations. sincerely hope do. Reminds saying: ""You go plumber's house pipes leak"" I've said number times. anti-maskers around WWII war may turned differently. cousin wedding early August. 100 guests, masks except eating (and dancing), staff enforce all. Overall, felt lax. cases thankfully (that venue told us about) can't say I'm surprised simple safety measures prevented disaster. sure downvoted said correct. 0-39 age group unlikely die COVID. course anecdotes young people dying, low zero.

But, learn virus, starting look like outcomes binary. someone may die, long term lingering effects. there's problem spreading others. So, worst outcome (death) low young person, still want avoid catching COVID. yes, I've worked Beijing, know lot people including medical fields, barely cases first place recent points infection controlled seen case month That’s kills me. 4-6 weeks incredibly harsh lockdown. done. least low numbers much easier contact trace. I’m going downvote times like maybe need look expect society, civilization, economic systems use ask why? reasons way society set sometimes forget.

So civilization? Well, simplistic form, allows relatively comfortable living society. combining resources physically create comfortable living environment. 

So capitalism? reason attracted capitalism provides products services enjoy. done state, many different things created it’s best let capitalism it’s evolutionary aspect work. course, like evolution lot waste. 

So create civilizations use capitalism ideology religious even moral system. use because, right now, help create comfortable physical environment live in. 

By getting bogged ideology free market miss real reason - making life comfortable. businesses need kept afloat pandemic makes sense use taxpayers dollars keep afloat later date. Otherwise raft empty storefronts gathering dust addition mass unemployment. additional reasons keep afloat comes “what kind society want physically live in.” Covid isn’t scary. know what’s really scary? SLIGHTLY HIGHER TAXES non-religious people try make everyone live values too. Currently, non-religious winning.  approach. Using preexisting conditions explain high number deaths. Still recommending mask. Umm, yes did. PA closed non life sustaining businesses March-June.

Literally stopped police officer didnt life sustaining reason driving, would get huge ticket. fear colleges universities students campus going turning point COVID U.S. Students country gathering together. outbreaks exceed schools' ability manage them, well outbreaks towns cities schools located.

Colleges send students home - places country - seed infections far schools. similar starting happen K-12 schools, broader geographically. everyone like celebrated weddings, birthdays, graduations, retirement, etc? It’s selfish can’t admit that. everyone acted like chose parties think, “oh, it’s once”, virus would never go away. like gun large gathering, whirling around shooting it. Maybe sky, maybe straight area people, maybe lots people. Maybe bullets, maybe not; helluva silencer it. might shoot yourself.

Oh, people hit bullets get gun like yours.

It's perfect analogy know gun, even ""loaded unloaded?"" question ""fix"" it. Still, I'd call assault attempted manslaughter treat anything utmost care caution. Lol people goddamned lunatics. Love though.  Entertaining!  Keep

Western media likes pretend entire world consists official US best friends official US enemies. socialist country like Cambodia that's neither exist according media. Moderna’s Bird Flu vaccine (mRNA-1440) started dosing phase 1 2015, quite bit Oxford’s 2018 MERS phase 1. hate idea “Only Oxford long term data it’s platform!”  probably it. big spikes cases New England universities? I’ve looking various dashboards haven’t seen big case numbers yet? parent freshman exactly enjoying safety protocols sticking rules, seems little early knock schools. wouldn’t surprised see cases grow I’m rooting schools students hopefully find way navigate school keeping case numbers control. mean (and article says too) restrictions like Spain/Italy/Wuhan/Victoria people told leave homes except essential purposes like getting food. Nonessential business like stores like shut people didn’t need go (to work) that’s keeping people locked inside. 

I think that’s popularly called *shutdown* *lockdown*. article says “lockdown” goes describe pretty much individual restrictions even Sweden had: avoid travel, avoid public transport etc. Yeah keep ranting nobody cares anymore friend (idk probably): extinction said wink nudge. ELI5, vaccine developed Oxford, getting tested Brazil? live. recall asking anyone trust anything say. anyone accept trust random nonmedical study non medical professional. US wasnt really made able fight pandemic, 

How US wipe smallpox borders then? cholera, polio, etc. lacking will, legal historical precedent towards lax disease control attitude. Americans soft use scalpel like plagues past. It’s pure chaos streets. It’s exactly media Reddit telling it’s like. Nothing upcoming election /s ZERO DEATHS 99.95% recovery rates stfu... PA was, absolutely sucked.

People literally got tickets driving without reason. Intp gang good news? never flu shots. 


Last time got flu 2016. Absolutely. doubt even Herman Cain, died recently attending Trump rally Tulsa, would changed stance. people still running dead man’s Twitter certainly haven’t changed minds. Peer pressure excuse. Getting engaged later month planning getting married next summer, we’ve watching headlines much sympathy growing horror becomes certain it’s going impact wedding. already hit point realizing engagement party impacted, increasingly worse dad become literal pro-plaguer. huge issue couples whose family generally okay things like moving together marriage. people keeping plague going strong seriously fucking timing serious life events people, sometimes even loved ones, they’re big snowflakes wear mask others two months brainwashed put masks two months since can’t others. 55% Scots want independence, including me. know I’ve read several medical article can’t find right now. reason ever researched first place within weeks taking first shot, daughter started getting migraines lethargy. talking pediatrician recommended getting series shots information came them. 16 never taken series. three kids vaccines. said weary vaccines pushed HPV vaccine was. hope covid vaccine works. really do. can’t help think Legend time. also don’t trust money hungry big pharma. Never underestimate power stupidity large groups.  happen, lot masochistic people continue self-impose strict lockdown claiming forced it. happen everyone saw clearly expendable lives are. ridiculous playacting calling minimum-wage workers heroes. happen everyone discouraged anything besides work, often pointless work extends spreads pandemic. People seeing ugly society is. five head wedding? Luckily comparison isn’t N.Y, it’s US. 88% Swedes live Urban area. That’s among highest world, higher US 82% live Urban area. anything high percentage people living rurally US makes comparison problematic. 

Because fact Sweden bunch forest north (and “north”, Sweden, like 3/4 country) moose bears live doesn’t really matter, it’s moose bear, people. "" Index first effort track national leaders’ responses critical policy areas, including public health directives, financial responses, fact-based public communications ""

This deaths overall response across board. web site makes bit clearer think full analysis behind paywall Locking indoors making depressed. realizing fucking stupid everybody else is. Like thought idiot people shit together. wrong. many idiots there. People barely graduated school telling doctors part secret cabals usher NWO's. Back day called em Illuminati stupid then. depressed. Getting stay home, work home, hang family thing keeping sane. 

People probably depressed time home read paranoid anxiety fuelled tabloids share facebook. They're working pour delusional paranoia. day filled reading crap like Fawkin gubermint man, gawd damn vaccinations mandatory flouride tooth brushing scheme take world. 

Why depressed?  fair, little dramatic. Genuine concern, sassy response insinuating unlikely scenario 15+ people die gathering. 1 opinion many, make sound like everybody gonna die. Damn thought 5 day cool period could post here, looks like influence operation ran sockpuppets racing make new ones. must juicy gossip going around Vatican! understood anything commenting. direct, in-your-face propaganda work. subtle, every-day exposure well. Global warming fix bothers much!

I gave birth April, right shit hit fan live. extremely careful people talking us didn’t let hold son. Screw im saying maybe founders right granting layman vote. Holy fuck humans DUMB lol term searching ""morally bankrupt."" Good. Pretty sure schools aren’t problem. probably saved lives several people. worthwhile thing do. DOD implemented service wide mask mandate bases since March they've work home units support it. part kind get job done go home right fucking awesome.  I'd say mask mandate followed pretty well means perfect. So, strict lockdown working? Australia absolutely America regard BLM protests work insurance one day 2 people looking event insurance. One group 100 1000. Edmonton, Canada, mandatory mask law, large gathering suggestion. declined risk. adults interact people 

Which also consented shaming people actually want get side mess.

When's going be, exactly? wedding DIE FOR. stock photo outdated. postponed 10/10/2020 wedding go 10/10/2021 *April.* can't believe people still going it. Yes, anything else going kill them. people deathbed anything close it. active working adults, fact, three got virus work. depressing!  pretty spot UK well believe. 6% number false. Stop holding onto that. already proven 94% deaths...they died timeframe....(most many years left) otherwise.

You know 94% includes obese...diabetic... autoimmune disease...all things people live many years with.

Keep mind 30-40%of USA obese. We're talking grossly obese... american ""kind chubby"" counts.

Obese mean 400 lbs. like 200...male... obese.

30+ BMI it. Lol gatherings acceptable? That's gossip. believe that? Smallpox would like word. I’m trying accept can’t protect ppl themselves... $$$. doesn’t exist vacuum. students attending closed schools receive lower quality education. don’t know see net loss. Dang 750k? saw one 2k virus probably spreading Europe year, maybe even gay I’m saying Chinese weaponized virus nuclear bombed placebo US saline like 0.004% mortality rate service members? 1,837 Minnesota ""propagandas"" already buried year Covid, callous fuck. Im protests, yes one hand feel like make us loose progress, hand don’t really see progressing towards. Without contact trace test program, instant tests, unless every single case eliminated it’s going come back.

So might well open idk words, we're worse would done ignoring begin with? okay, y'all! It'll just...disappear! 

...aaaaaaanyday now...

*checks watch* Remind Me! Two Months know Reddit loves hating old people overweight people, think maybe jumping gun couple weeks, since there's exactly zero info article date wedding, let alone physiological makeup attendees?

This article updates number killed Minnesota alone 1,837. Ya, didn’t see total tests jumped 90 million 160 million overnight US catch up? perfectly rounded numbers. Keep good work, China! /s Yeah people know read article? guy literally worked ER. uncommon health care get test done work. about? I'm getting info flat earthers - information presented models created scientists Yale Harvard. I'm saying might need high 70%. Well seems alarming. wonder Northeastern would done students taking part outdoor demonstration sort. Would university arrive conclusion? feel going back testing whatever pinpoint entered region, also feel that, people/govt would funding want know. know say confidently started 1 person idea long short term health effects immunity lasts forever.

Stands reason long 1 person planet could happen there's vaccine unless whole planet gets immunity wear off. two options. Density major factor. wouldn’t expect understand pal Reggie goes burning Man every time pees - know mean. flu shot fully covered insurances. would 100% expect covid vaccine Hey man, I'm beyond burnt out, I'm still isolating. mental health pretty frayed feel bad son absolutely nothing allowed even play friends live neighborhood right now. like since beginning March.

Point is, us still trying believe right thing. hard everyone burnt out: get it. Can't contribute break ask sick peif protest true. also think question, would they? world become extremely disconnected place, paradox really, everyone constantly bombarded sorts bullshit day everyday. we're desentized everything. read watch thr news absolutely mortifying disgusting shit happened block morning, i'd prob forgot it, least give shit it, noon. nothing's actually real anymore. money, friendships, community, 30 sec blip tik tok shit. nobody cares we've become. politicians media eats exploits us it. fucked up. i'm part anyone though guess. Yes correct. You’re supporting I’ve trying say Meh, let know cases HD Pretty much this. Feel without sin cast first stone, particular matter found information China pretty much reliable what's US, told. Certainly leader sending nonsensical disinformation tweets mid March, mocking men wearing masks *September*.

Gets frustrating reading ""but China's fault"" political party pushed those, situation, would handled worse imo. meaning step anyone's toes. I’m confused... it’s like understand works one post completely forget Slate's gabfest mentioned briefly Thursday--if wanted *real* vaccine rollout, needed start preparing *months* ago. in, like, April. need hundreds millions syringes, needles, vials manufactured--not mention actual doses themselves. also need *massive* logistics infrastructure route shipments need go, make sure stay temperatures need to, guarantee there's funny business going distribution.

And we've done, like, nothing. ""Going away"" would mean eradication. devastating Polio, likely receive resources long enough enough places similar program eradication.

Elderly people remain fearful vaccine effective nearly everyone, happen, infection rate extremely low, could happen people retained immunity long period time, happen Coronaviruses. daily routine made constantly get close people’s asses? get it. I've lock since March 8 year old. 

* Can't go visit friends, even live street coronavirus.
* Can't even play outdoors said friends parents scared (understandably). playgrounds/parks area still closed.
* Can't go activities family due husband's job restrictions.
* humid enjoy outdoor activities perpetual armpit here, even night.
* Pools closed summer, goes that.
* Even though state mask mandate re-upped two weeks Aug. 31st, almost ONE follows it, despite signage stating clearly wear shops enclosed spaces.
* Even school session, almost extracurricular activities cancelled severely inhibited (again, understandable), there's again, nothing child bountiful energy do.
* I'm mentally physically exhausted. could sleep rest pandemic forfeit portion life ""lost cause"", would.
* Mental health lot folks time low, seems like worse chosen remain self-imposed exile. Sad thing is, fewer fewer willing take hit remain isolated.
* Meanwhile, people out, clearly ignoring state protocols, concerned dumb beach holidays protecting communities around them.
* Employers/employees places (here) least trying follow protocol protect themselves, rarely see customers establishments give damn anyone even rare see wear masks sanitize hands, even free sanitizer offered.
* would love meaningful places hike around here, exist within 30 minutes live, sadly. Something miss smaller towns/rural areas.
* family relying watching funny shows movies (Monty Python), playing lot board games/video games subscribing every box subscription planet (it seems). mean, spending extra money anything else outside food Amazon purchases, not?
* upside upswing savings. We've able save pretty hefty chunk set aside emergency use. Outside that? Yeah, I'd totally volunteer medically induced coma ride crap subsides point. Better total isolation massive hit already crappy mental health.  Since you’re racist white teenager, I’m betting there’s Chinese boss future you’re gonna like it. educator, think 50 reasons this. Also way measure 2nd generation spread. Vast majority protestors young. infections would light (and mostly hidden overall statistical noise). would pass older people would freaking way determine disease came from. 3, popcorn-ers actually worst. instead watching keep talking adding gasoline fire, obscuring legitimate arguments rebuttals. They're like 40% Americans vote. beginning. Teams outbreaks weeks. better worse field team play. feels exactly like that. kidding! I'd take random American random Chinese person day.

China authoritarian government atrocious record human rights engaged massive ethnic cleansing campaign RIGHT people still acting like place emulate. smh Well, getting kickbacks listing death coronavirus probably happen ever say ccp! Yeah Mexican President talk shit trumps response I’m sure. vs. outdoor environments affected terms air resistance, present circumstances. 
Correct, wind important factor. Since mass droplets small, even small draft redirect sneeze disperse concentrated, equals lowered risk if, somehow, +/- 10 mph, 100-mph sneeze cannot blocked human reflexes. physically impossible, hence rule 6-10 feet; that's far need avoid 95-99% droplets getting you, even mask. 
The distance changes you’re outdoors unless zero wind. Otherwise range actually 20 mask blocked droplets, would reason social distancing. even outdoors, within 6-10 feet, still risk infection. 
The 6ft guideline supposed use along masks, separately. CDC understands masks don’t work 100% effectiveness, hence guideline social distancing. However, wearing mask reduces spread concentration range (multiple studies confirming take wind considerable air resistance; would depend direction, even wind blowing away you, could infect person directly behind infected person, assuming they're within 6-10 feet.
That would accurate sneezes didn’t exponentially disperse, however do, wind blowing break droplet spread way lower concentrations (keep mind viral load important fact, wind would increase relative speed sneeze 100 mph 110, 115, not. Thus, assertion provably false.
Once again, wrong, air resistance something like sneeze would slow considerably. wind would blowing speed case. plain confused view Yeah, that's 99% America. He's typical. think meant say rich rick alcohol tobacco much better/s 🤣🤣👌👌👌 like spend vacations murdering people chainsaw. anyone says anything, say ""It's vacation, relax"". weather *doesn't* permit, e.g., forest fires, 90+ degree temperatures, hurricanes...?

As side note: fewer people school 1918 pandemic. comparing apples salad greens. also said AMLO spread sickness need use masks. actually, meant trouble explaining parents vociferously pushing mandatory f2f schooling kids argument ""but family statistically probably die!""

For fuck's sake, *not everything kid.* fuck could live mild case, spread still asymptomatic, severely hurt killed someone else? 

If nothing else, 2020 *real* wake-up call many people around us *zero* empathy people. Cartels mass murder day crazy they're blowing right now? act like one thing though. president, trump explicitly said want increased testing. Robust testing performed essential works even varies company/county. 

There nationwide push proactive testing contact tracing. also mostly cities virus already news unless huge spike cities, conjunction protests. Yeah everyone Reddit losing minds Florida beaches. asshole dressed grim reaper harassing people. Noo, still come time time... China billion people, mobile accounts people iirc, business phones etc etc. Official state figures said accounts dropped first time iirc, 20mn.

Nutters like say ""clearly 20mn died"", common sensers tend say ""then never would contained, borders would overflowing disease eg Vietnam, Hong Kong, whistleblowers would heard, likely due economic effects"".

But anyway, conspiracy theorists going conspiracy theorise, basically. US is. it’s good job Football playing 16 games baseball playing 60. also play per week. advantages football. think it'll survive daily testing they're doing. students profusely warned paid tuition. chose it. (I deleted comment) would post article wants people pay monthly subscription read it...gtfo lol. Interesting point. protests also strong advocate favor mask-wearing. means every person hospitalized severe case COVID, there’s another person hospitalized equally severe respiratory infection. Kinda makes think, doesn’t it? ""seasonal"" flu direct descendent 1918 flu. leads believe covid minimum ""seasonal"" Covid years/decades. US nothing right contain, halt, even slow spread. Change view Oh please. Diversity thought action (one by-products rugged individualism) paid enormous dividends prosperity, innovation, personal liberty.

Might biting us butt little right now, I'd take random American citizen random Chinese citizen day. I'm ok tax increase free healthcare. would cost less long run. like US? Precisely opposite?continuing live life usual lifetime pandemic takes *no* sacrifice. think whiny suggest making changes routine greater good community, for, op suggested, longer weeks, bridge sell you. thing us next 6-12 months whether like not, maybe longer. different concerns around climate change. might argue people need stop whining change, whether masks, social distancing, conservation efforts, get it. smart economically either. Markets already shifting accommodate pandemic, climate change. either change learn new way, get left behind. think 2 million prisoners America, enough dismiss America decent government too. There’s indication stating work. Also come say might find one everyone agrees earth round, stop rotating revolving around sun. 

I tired shit. Since beginning crisis kept hearing ultra optimistic scenarios ideas:

* CFR 1%, even 0.1%
* flu, bro
* 10 times asymptomatic cases symptoms
* children get it
* children get can't transmit it
* need masks
* go away gets warm/hot outside

And more.

I know comes from, one one proven wrong. 

Check post history see many times downvoted hell saying CFR way 1% places 10%. 

People damn ready believe anything makes feel better, even there's proof it, even there's plenty proof contrary. guess also explains religion, digress. Nice. went there. cheerleaders certain government happy downvoted denied, know speaking truth power. 

Just glad harm they're limited downvoting. Many people certain country blamed COVID lucky. vaccine, possibly might find one.. 

Why saying this?

There nearly half dozen solid vaccine candidates there.. body makes antibodies last line defense bind neutralize virus blood. get better still antibodies around while.

If assume IFR across regions, could take number deaths one place project many infections must been. problem course cannot - Europe study really give much light American data. Lmao dude never disagreed you. Wow. alright? People know gotten totally mentality. woman know hospitalized March went vacation taking 5+ hour plane flight hotspot people dumb. Wait you?? don’t quarantine right now? can’t even leave state Aus without permission I’m even Victoria lol Selfish assholes close friends family ours. state schools started shutting can’t contain environment. Doesn’t help wealthy school district around 15 families requested remote learning. That’s it. rest rich mfers want use school daycare, even though ability wfh internet speed stream classes. NOPE! Got get kids house spread disease. makes mad thoughtless people kids. It’s shame going many young people significant damage hearts, lungs, CNS. r/unexpectedumbrellaacademy Well point doesn’t really matter politics point. understand Trump wanted wall  Yeah, people national headlines, going jail, sued oblivion? involved, couple, officiators, whoever rented space, etc etc.  regard people around them, deadly. There's counting affected - someone passes someone passes someone else dies. talking about? studies proving said. dunno. leaders parroting stupidest shit trump already said. think happens lot, eloping people realize need party. Weddings bullshit anyway. stupid reason put lives friends family danger. bought mine $45,000. inside completely remodeled. needs repairs, nothing urgent major.

It's nice town 15 minutes state capital. Downsides: close road much useable land would like. ours, son goes terrific school. Ssshhh... caring-about-non-privileged-people bias showing. 

We stable households, jobs home, comfy suburban neighborhoods, high mask compliance local whole foods. staying lockdown 10+ months time there's 3-5x flu season perfectly reasonable course action. matter white rich reduces risk much wearing mask, work service industry choose putting inter-generational households risk, lose roof heads... lock down, clearly, trying murder grandma.

I one, look forward next 6-12 month vacation society, people realize Covid-level viruses ""once hundred years"" situation, like ""once every years modern society"" situation. Gonna super fun!!

My advice, ever invest travel, tourism, food industry, retailer that's Amazon. Cause old, sick, infirm losers here, Jeff Bezos definitely winner.

Bonus points for-profit university, gets bunch horny naive barely legally adult teenagers, puts feet away unventilated prison cells, tell 40K tuition confiscated much socialize horny naive barely legally legal teenagers. That's definitely kids screwing up. Yup, totally. Society nothing wrong setting situation. Yup, nothing all. *whistles capitalism*  GORSH! Yea, 'I give flying f\*\*k anyone else mentality full display. NSFW content video first 2.5 minutes pretty good insight Sturgis gonna superspreader - conducted 45 million test till moving ahead fast pace, fuck mean minimal testing?! Honestly, Florida? Like leaders Florida trying assert island non-Covid activity? Oh boy that’s rich. 

I’ll bet quarantine role “essential” workers. can’t quarantine 2 weeks every day work. Colleges made choice reopen, quite frankly civic duty a) get outbreaks control b) keep outbreaks isolated campus deal uh...I guess let burn population. 

Closing sending students home effectively bio terrorism, girl spitting people March got charged that, I’d say colleges send students home face charges. Catholics higher birth rate US overall though Heh someone coughing video call gets everyone looking around alarm (UK here). originally going moderately sized wedding (100 ish people) costing $15-20k, ended eloping park 8 local friends couple hundred dollars. 

Husband wants still big wedding celebration day (tentatively scheduled next summer) would perfectly happy spend money house, big trip safe so, and/or graduate degrees want get.

We definitely wedding 100% safe so, guess we'll see we're years (I zero confidence next summer 100% safe). answer questions 

Just babbling nonsense again

Try son Honestly still unforgivable...she started give shit affected her. feel bad apathy caught her, deserves sympathy, especially we've seen affecting/killing people. knew situation was.

Her poor son, though. understand mother reckless child's life...like even odds favor, risk it? think she'd love loves right.

And many others she/her son expose recklessness? handful confirmed reinfections. Way soon say either way. cousin doing. supposed get married May, postponed like October recently informed everyone going elope party shit dies down. different coast me, I'm happy longer need sit flying contamination tube several hours way. Postponing May wedding probably easiest decision ever made. “Put 100 closest friends family Risk, wait another year see things better?” brainer. Stupid selfish cocksuckers data dependent testing. may many refuse get test, virus takes longer become symptomatic. horrid, perfectly described truth. Well, we're third US population, number reported deaths per capita similar. additionally, metrics point underreporting even USA. case August. soon either way speak reinfection risk. Zero responsibility? Really? India positivity rate less 10 percent, 1.1 million tests daily, major cities low infection rate, span 6 months honesty India medically advanced handle pandemic like this! feasible criticism lack public appearances conferences, even modi supporter, definitely Italy it. They're still pandering anti-China crowds apparently 😂 wife got married almost 20 years ago. small ceremony friends beach lived, came back big church wedding. really nice thing already married, 90% pressure stress gone, big party. I'd recommend way anyone. That’s probably it. (Long Island) wedding families, don’t remember part self indulgent. I’m certain weddings same. Though certainly large amount center around selfish bride well. say true. beach, cops around nobody enforced mask rule plenty without mask Take spaces retype. Automod deleted uncivility

r/cov id iot many times keep re-remembering virus takes long time kill people? Especially libs 

If Dems political sense would Obama psa Barack bandannas  Elope selfish assholes USA officially dead per capita covid-19 Sweden

You know, people Sweden quite happy country shutting down. lot elders would want risk dying several months long isolation, they'd rather able enjoy potentially last days life.

People look Swedish numbers make lot weird assumptions based them, realizing isolation shutdowns harmful people well. funeral left early nobody wearing masks social distancing. basically got courthouse married last year visa reasons we’re aiming big celebration everyone past July (now next year), exchange rings. one keeps insisting it’s *not really* wedding mom, whose first reaction saying delaying “call wedding dress shop see cancel dress- can’t possibly wear white dress you’ve married year!”

 state biggest outbreak currently happening, due wedding 65 people (in violation mandates events). less month, three people died, 150+ diagnosed, including people jail nursing home. Even masks distancing want couple’s heads pike. imagine responsible something like this? certainly won’t let happen work! Anyone wants reschedule 10 times get refund welcome to. won’t complicit killing people want party. it. wife March right everything starting. We’ll party next year hopefully everything gets better.

Watching conservatives math social disease like watching chimp fix copy machine No, conditions make us favorable ground epidemic. good friend mine nurse covid floor. wedding outdoor last week indoor reception like 100 people. one people mask room left quickly. friends zoom wedding. them, parents close family (siblings.) 50 people person, everyone else watching via online. We'll real party over.

They delayed wedding May September too. Brit here. kids went back school, social distancing. Pubs open, lots people taking risks. Colds flu covid gonna fuck shit up. many show symptoms 

The CDC said 90% positive tests false positive live viruses threat anyone. 

Then inventor PCR equipment said used test viruses. 

Finally Health Canada said evidence covid isolated. Yeah, I’m healthcare, charge ppe office, used run 3 boxes masks day, it’s like 1 box every 3 days. Hope grandma ok. states ban them?

Muh freedom US pretty well managed nuclear radiation country nuking Nagasaki Hiroshima. Another fun memory thing happened 10 years ago flu nobody really cares it’s flu funny cause without getting students door lose revenue, LOT. shut online only? NP, we'll still charge full price dorms, parking, food costs, tuition give passing grade like end last school year. new norm xD. Liberals conservatives, potatoes potaaatoes  “It wasn’t covid also diabetes” wedding supposed October. Back March, voiced concerns it. Everyone kept saying, ""Oh fall everything fine. still wedding, dont worry"". decided postpone next October. hope still then... article mention indoor outdoor? BIG difference ask me. “Chris Masterjohn PhD Nutritional Sciences medical doctor. Nothing site constitutes medical advice. “

Chris feel like really put message top website.  offering full refunds deposits? That's people going Yup seeing everywhere, fucking dumb. want go restaurants live life live middle Dallas TX safe. It’s frustrating fuck drive every packed restaurant see stories like didn’t even try mitigate exposure, it’s making us suffer longer putting lives risk. 

This whole situation frustrating exhausting, what’s worse gone completely supporting personal freedoms questioning maybe authoritarian type crack quarantining would actually right way go... probably competent president would enough point want see light end tunnel terms situation coming end soon. Ore first cases imported Italy, first mass infections came cases imported Vail (I think that's name ski resort). we're lot circumstances make us favorable ground epidemic. Go USA! Onward gold categories! go Little Italy San Diego right looks like 2019, insane. halloween next month, sir. I’m embarrassed. feel collective pitiful stare developed countries thought values inner core. I'm SWVA never heard tiny place. thought Bland small. really means paper ink!  common sense I’m afraid. kind claim never true without proof. flawed logic. would test people symptomatic? That's waste time money country world power test everyone citizens. US acting stupid political pressure. know there's way stop virus right? way beginning tracing contacts, Mexico first month fine. wealthy Mexicans coming Vail italy fucked everything point tracing contacts many, untraceable. That's phase 2 started Mexico changed model (praised way) test people symptoms. That's positivity rate high, became we're testing confirm covid right treatment. people mild symptoms ask leave absence work 14 days self quarantine. access IMSS website (Mexican soscial security), fill form give certificate go work two weeks, still get paid obviously. Mexico done things extremely right honest. brother postponed wedding twice finally said “fuck it” two weeks ago. However, instead 200 person wedding reception, turned 18 people family backyard everyone get negative covid test attend quarantine two weeks wedding.

Nobody got sick able hug wear masks. ways minimal risk, lots special traditional wedding things sacrificed.  understand difference bouncing idea around thought experiment vs. killing people. Wow...I forget crazy religious thought process sound... ones? bars know never closed all. Shit year yes, alive talk friends family. really think one through, you? Spanish-speaking countries struggling nowadays. Coincidence? Risk Assessment disease tricky some. 

Viruses hard visualize many visual thinkers proper Risk Assessment. also assume intentional misdirection overall impatience lot it. 

If US death toll reflected daily explosion like one Beirut last month, would visual catastrophe lot appropriately nervous. I’ve seen several teachers Facebook saying they’re scared back school, yet it’s (implied) ok put hairdressers, restaurant staff, &amp; dental staff risk go places. backwards. We’ve declined 3 wedding invites year. one rescheduled next year. eating/drinking/laughing/hugging/group photos land mine Covid19.  Oh wish true. friends nurses lax others know.

Cases area starting pick up. right doorstep now. I'm scared. hope parents survive, neither taking seriously. that's second wave.

About 300 cases first wave.

And country almost 100 million people border China. always. cousin got married August, even though put deposit yet pandemic started. Around May decided stick original date. attend, luckily one got sick. Go local county marriage license area.

Get married. (Legally)

When ""all over""* - throw big party/ceremony.

*for whatever definition prefer. qualifications? trust opinion? It’s already proven COVID significantly reduce male sperm counts, that’s something happy about. 

Mass infertility combined social/environmental collapse entire foundation Handmaid’s Tale series. family member decided wedding yesterday. talk numerous high-risk family members going difficult bride GUILTING going. Finally relented suggested couple live stream ceremony us make it. that, thankfully, many people church wearing masks. yet see photos videos reception though. really hope none get sick. Gotta love capitalism! 

But yes, $40K fine teenager, literally hanging teenagers, umm... Fucking insanity.

Either let come back begin with, refund tuition.

Creating obviously untenable situation, acting surprise turns untenable, willfully ignorant best, incredibly malicious manipulative worst.

But yea, I'm sure struggling profit colleges incentive whatsoever create blatantly stupid situations... Deniers bingo: testing error, 1 100 million, second infection serious, nobody died yet... Nope. I’m gonna sit one out. Shouldn’t : 1 wedding * (275 guests - 0 masks) ? plenty evidence show Covid flu substantially different. Paywall. Thousands stupid realize newfound warped sense taste smell due infected Sturgis. amount weddings going right live makes frustrated. Already people work get tested wedding exposures. It’s possibility. won’t available everyone. first wave vaccine focus getting elderly risk people. Unless you’re making everyone wear masks distance, different. I’m in!! think certain HK Nevada cases sequenced genetically distinct. still factors play, contaminated samples. don’t know whole world countries vaccine end year, early 2021 think. Yup. That’s current infections happening. Family friend parties. 🙄 Good luck smooth distribution without errors. Thank you. get told I’m “not normal” “need professional help” family won’t participate constant small gatherings. Wow, gotta get Foxnews. Add businesses lost, led personal debt, take years climb 'Only' 70 000 deaths

Considering 10 times die single month India. sound much. given crazy undercounting happens places like India, real covid count way worse. swings ways. There's data suggesting countries high population density *and* high rates commuting, especially public transport, ones fare poorly. see world Sweden's strategy could ever worked places like NYC, Singapore even Italy.

Then again, NZ went strict lockdown compared Sweden fared much better terms COVID numbers. economy seem faring much worse IMF predicts Sweden's GDP fall 6.8 percent year increase 5.2 percent next. comparison, New Zealand's GDP expected fall 7.2 percent year rise 5.9 percent next - although projection made prior move Level 2 nationally Level 3 Auckland last week.

That said, many states US seem stuck limbo - get benefit staying open like Sweden re-opening properly strict lock months. makes one wonder whether Trump administration actual plan deal outbreak. happens PCR tests matter dead virus = presence genetic information needed amplification = false positives. categorically different asymptomatic cases however, someone actively shedding live virus showing signs infection. However, people dead viral material take around 40-50 days clear virus body. worth noting however someone get tested US, time required show symptoms points active infection. known facts since beginning, figuring feel dejected, one blame false expectations testing methods cant do.

Paper may discussing reasons persistent positives recovered: analyzing persistance SARS-cov2 RNA infected individuals post infectiond: imagine looking wedding photos thinking ""because grandma died."" Race reach high-score infections! scum. start marriage super spreader event poor unfortunate soul die from. Good luck. Where's clip biker guy saying covid political? father grandfather educated jesuits actually attended wedding VA August. 130 people attended every one us get tested hand. mask worn provided peeps getting married masks coming progressed day. 0 COVID cases it. got really lucky, guess. planned October pushed April 2021, even I'm optimistic it. small family ceremony outside, pushed everything even still want wedding like article. Getting friends family potentially deathly ill would forever ruin thought wedding day special day remember. Congratulations! would wear mask zero cases? I’ve commented another poster, I’ve heard stories Catholic schools across board. little emphasis “Catholic” part private school. more. Either way, personally don’t want religion sponsoring school. disdain organized religion sniff outside church home (where belongs) repels me. Well US counted deaths accurately they'd surpassed Sweden weeks ago. liberal doctor friend postpone wedding March like June. I’m CA. Still went it. masks IG videos. Glad I’m friends friends wasn’t invited. full shit think protests causing Covid cases go up. Yet see news stories wedding outdoor event Covid cases associated it. Basically trying shame people. protests thousands people gather hours end, packed, shouting slogans. mean need get COVID-19 vaccine every year may may work, like flu vaccine? Hispanic catholic yes 
European catholic descendants ""But happen *me*."" one wants stomach sacrificing personal freedoms benefit society. understood many Eastern cultures going sacrifice level personal identity/independence/freedom ensure stability society whole.

That's great individual times peace, times emergency, culture understand implications survival getting wiped out, pretty handy fucking ideology have.

Just look 'westernized' Asian countries like Japan Korea. Even understood implications virus pretty much locked down, socially responsible. end day Western countries full people care society (not make majority populations, substantial subset population). Amazing GPA 4.0 biomed degree including A+ stats prove otherwise. hey, easy internet troll arguing point. “You never underestimate predictability stupidity.” - Bullet-Tooth Tony I’m sure that’s great solace people lost family members friends. Never said one. So, two spots left. Anyone else? post fine until, “sue us!” sound entitled hell. couldn’t wait another year? needed attention, eh? Gotta risk people’s health safety? guests probably felt unfairly pressured go shouldn’t put people. Wow look posting stats. Woop woop! Maine ranked top ten highest literacy rates. I'm from.

""Of low English literacy skills, 35% White, 2% born outside U.S.; 23% Black, 3% born outside U.S.; 34% Hispanic, 24% born outside U.S."" 

""Florida has third-highest percentage adults lacking basic prose literacy skills 19.7%, equaling literacy rate 80.3%. Florida lowest number f public libraries per 100,000 residents 2.6.""

Cousin white rural Florida. make past 8th grade.

You also take consideration rural schools public education system, also differentiate schools money many areas schools without money. Across USA, realize staggering amount people proficient literacy skills regardless state they're from.

""According worldatlas.com, U.S. literacy rate 86 percent number 125 list 197 countries."" [USA really hope so!!!! guys can't get tested...? Inadequate testing suspect missing lot cases Music ears herd immunity proponents.  *than Sweden Minnesota, cousin reception wedding weeks back, even though married two years ago. 40 people, nobody wearing masks. Really god damn happy said stayed home. really, wish family damn ignorant what's going on. I'm glad worked well you! I'm problem face weeks. I'd feel terrible going since he's dear friend, there's truly way ensure everyone going wear masks anything... You‘re assuming herd immunity possible. far it’s case. Well, usually, kinds invitations sent expectation decline, still get gift. still get people think ok. ""Family gatherings"" what's spreading shit. suppose different take super, super seriously 100% trust everyone attendance exposure, that's reality instances. 

My close friend went gathering 6 people, six got pretty badly. They're young. I've invited several small gatherings (close family, friends) sorry trust 5-6 people enough take seriously do. 

We could've seriously quarantined month, seen friends/family time, mostly control. thanks asshats think gatherings size okay, probably seeing parents, friends, loved ones looooong time. end well sound like hitler Democrats Re-infection downplayers bingo sheet: Testing error, 1 million, serious, nobody died. That’s less half cases peak back April. really scary. Oh yeah nurses seems worst offenders Fuck that. don’t want deal brain dead assholes here! wedding next week made masks everyone, giving plastic masks well everyone's name it. use it, come in. can't people this? Oh, 25 people, can't bigger restrictions. Open college universities person instruction social distancing harder pull young adults think invincible. 

Pretty much asking it. “They done outside”

Pretty sure that’s said. protest stuff. large gathering permitted anymore....  Hell, got married Vegas Elvis, even then, right ceremony legally married. Signed paperwork, someone pronounce us husband wife. Elvis wedding, totally fake married 2 minutes prior! us delayed next September handful friends family (10 ish) dinner.

Can't put life hold put parties hold Good point. Basically I’m doing. Got pregnant realized we’d wait wedding wanted Fall in-laws got us weren’t right thing really fucking annoying general. said still wanted get married start trying plan destination small wedding I’m like no, we’re going courthouse paper important you. 

We’ve together 10 years we’re married yet, baby “too soon” don’t care anymore tbh. eloped secret Spring told couple people, it’s gotten around. care wedding see wife dress.  brain engineered cognitive dissonance blissfully ignored pix protestors wearing masks. COVID, sounds like great time get married. still bit immunity. means gather one member family, official ceremony, photographer, half already COVID, vastly lowering risk.

Oh wait. wanted 500 person wedding extravaganza? Yeah, bad idea. Ignorance. Quick mafs Mind ask general region quadrant country in? understand not. thing US. it’s teachers, too. 😣 whats exhausting you?

My biggest thing washing groceries, much. stopped that. still rest. 

Genuinely curious, looking shame anything. tech already there, nobody done yet (in humans) though. Thank pointing out. that, stereotypical Scandinavian massive personal bubble, people government not, explains fair bit Sweden's stats vs fellow Nordics... vs rest Europe. want hurt people's feelings mommy law shelled $50k could invite 150 people list"" 

I happy paid everything pocket wife's dress. allowed continually remind MIL paying wedding could wanted to. people able though. :/ deposit place protect vendor’s income.

Non-refundable deposits protect vendor either A. opportunity cost potentially booked different event one cancelling B. Covering expenses may taken would lose bc event go through. 

They generate revenue situations would wildly unforseen like worldwide pandemic making type event vendor caters unsafe. People saying ""we can't hold event bc danger poses public health"" legitimate reason keep deposit highly unlikely something covered contract (although might be). Paywall. yes. remembered first wedding back number clients greatly decreased cost services less original deposit. went services paid back rest owed.  doubt dude almost athletes gotten fine. 

Really? statistics share It’s probably anxiety tbh 

It almost certainly not. Morons !!!!!!!!! 👏keep great work murica ever hear tragedy Darth Plagueis Wise?  I’ve seen boyfriend 3 times since New Years, short period time, like grab lunch. feel like it’s extremely possible limit contact even people relationship would prefer hang longer regularly. 🤷🏼‍♀️

But yeah, definitely see peer pressure would big factor something like this. sub better recognize fact..else, political bias, fact based sub Thanks Ok, side gf..you know vicious backstabbing going medical facilities every type. also certain population,,especially one group, BETTER go thing, BETTER sign card, BETTER join pot luck BETTER donate group gift boss every year, although America never supposed "" give up"". part group. show proper respect, flipping co-workers signed petition me. union absolutely nothing. kiss asses entire time on. allowed sit them, talk ECT. jump grill, find out. counties much poorer Mexico much better. happening Mexico result stupidity ignorance population state. Nothing like Ebola outbreak help take next pandemic seriously. Still, impressive considering little resources work with. Absolutely, agreed. laid several realities you, tell 15,000+ facilities well million patients supposed operating contact outside world year more? taking anytime understand precautions taking complaining pointing fingers uneducated viewpoint. despair' still effect virus, can't separate two.

I refute idea.

If *new* ""Virus X"" that, turns out, *was lethal all* ... people afraid people going hospital heart attacks whathaveyou ..

... would say people killed Virus X? cannot live like forever. human beings hard wired pack animals. Sooner later nobody going care anymore. remain home every university around I'm aware Darwin approves. point they're relaxing standards instead locking down. There's reason cases go down. Unless issue mask mandate herd immunity like New York. 

There's still like 8 times deaths go Texas gets immunity like New York. got flu ten years ago still plus whole lot more. I’m pretty sure SARS I’m pretty sure world hurt. 
Dying sounds heavenly compared hell I’ve through. People stupid that’s sure. Sometimes gotta hear 😪 Should’ve nuked US get guy understand immersion classes means hah. guess popular states? Canada least french immersion pretty popular No, privilege needed. disable javascript paywalls melt away. personally use chrome ext it, remembers sites disable on. seen paywall advert net 5 years reckon. US states different Nordic countries sure. true, come deaths heart disease experienced significant drops essentially locked areas?

I would interested seeing source that.

But true, one reason many could ""presumed Covid"" now? anything goes wrong, strung scapegoats, politicians pushing rushed release.  Hating redditors USA downvoting you, lol. equate Sweden Nazi Germany? students completely shut socializing past year. Prom, graduation parties, graduation. course they'll want socialize college, average student - make lost time. time, schools in-person classes. kind like giving drunk person drink absolutely know another one, trying pass blame completely onto start throwing glasses wall. added benefit profiting shattered glass. 

It sets dangerous precedent prone abuse. Hugs, tubes, patients. Wow surprise. trying find correlation two conditions demonstrated. know chance?

This paper concerned that, links [this inclusion criteria exclude anyone either confirmed COVID19 case contact somebody was. far tell selection also means demonstrating link.

The second source [this (seemingly linked to), read yet.

I'm curious end similar paper COVID-related heart issues recently, turned statistical error. y’all feel virus 99.983% survivability rate? Sweden literally one least corrupt countries Maybe US revamp education system actually give local kids childhood education deserve. Indeed evidence asymptomatic *adults* develop long-term cardiac issues. Multiple piece evidence now, living patients, including ones never went hospital including ones never got *symptoms*, also autopsies cardiac involvement initially suspected.

I think, cautionary principle, evidence assumed extend children *until show otherwise*. opening schools letting potentially get lifelong diseases, without making sure case, reckless. I’m assuming it’s someone matching name sent wrong address, files labels got mixed something. There’s reason phlebotomists go way check name date birth like 3 times blood test; it’s really easy mix tubes identical blood swabs you’re taking strangers. 

In case covid testing there’s probably many official layers redundant identity testing, ways ensuring chain custody etc, since infrastructure new. company going release properly vetted us know recognize names there. Sounds right yes.

This 2020. 15 23 country, 22 1 Nordjylland. school holiday.

http://skoleferie-dk.dk/skoleferie-2020/ unique Swedish care home nice cosy care homes see many countries, oldies sit drink coffee play bingo 2-3 years die. much others call hospice. average time person stays Swedish care home 6 weeks. last resort. weakest population gathered large care homes extremely easy victims virus like thus one. virus gets in, racks numbers fast.
Something similar happened Belgium explains high numbers. care homes control, numbers deaths dropped significantly. 

This also explains number excess deaths Sweden lower many countries.

Sweden failed protect centers weak vulnerable people. Hopefully something similar never happen again.
But people claiming lockdown whole society would saved people, clue what's going on. many?

Pretty rare based what? Death rate measurement rate people dying particular point time. like ""miles per hour"" measure. Total deaths per capita something completely different. death rate (speed) US lot higher Sweden right now. Therefore overtaken Swedens' total deaths per million. Well customer now. Gotta treat customers equally. /s


A patient patient, never customer. profit healthcare sick ransom. Well, that's obvious. many selfish shit bags yolo attitude. People gonna party attend huge gatherings weekend long. Kids, college students, adults return normal daily life offices, retail stores, k-12 schools, colleges gonna spread shit like wildfire. Numbers go up, meh fuck tards care. get people made poor comparisons influenza past, case here.

Edit: typically influenza much lethal children Covid-19. Seeing China general disregard individual rights lives take measures worried hell back December-Jan, meant serious real potentially damaging get. take sweeping restrictive measure nobody right mind would enjoy means alternative would massive social unrest economical damage, potential destroy country.


And September. Y’all animals Same. deactivated 4 months ago. relief let fb go. Now, one knows am, I'm doing, anything. political posts got me. deal negativity toxicity fb. Yuck. dont think ill ever go back. Yeah fried approach ones. think many Swedes used Kastru airport, they'd counted Swedes. Danes go bus.

The Austrians ought stats nationality tourists. find it. “They died COVID19, covid19”

/s going fighting losing battle sharing actual facts data sub. mean, trust issues probably struggle adult life career well. people dying Sweden = less people dyi g elsewhere.

Its like WW2 probably didnt want Germany well. Cause caused massive amounts death place germany LOL Surprised Pikachu sane society choose young old people. know pneumonia deaths last year, year before?
I would venture guess lot less January-August 2020. said done, excess death count tell tale, pretty. Nah like IG. Don’t understand people dying bad news. 

Would rather people dying Sweden politicians elsewhere get right incentives make decisions line thinking? (Not saying thinking right wrong). 

For me, that’s pretty cynical anti-humanitarian view.  website many us teenagers first learned HTML coding used terrible things. literally complaining people wanting accurate data. view right, afraid real data. average price $125 u.s. fake news? P.S. honestly surprise far insurance charge. abdominal surgery two years ago. insurance charged $30,000. received $300 bill. yeah sure, still going wait developed country approve vax, Canada, UK, etc. get 

only fool would trust US regulating agency point, tampered with, FDA, CDC, HHS Everyone knows soon one second 18th birthday grow wrinkles walk cane. police defended arrest statement saying planned protest “public health risk. gathering nature blatant breach chief health officer’s directions puts Victorian lives risk,” statement read, according fourth person charged incitement Victoria amid crackdown anti-lockdown protests recent days.


The story explains it.


Australia want people planning events would spread Covid-19, would end people dieing. #Murica Medical supervision state government. make sure hospitals following rules code. It’s real headache late constantly changing regulations covid. get promoted one time without degree, I’ll need Phd that. stands GED I’ve able pass equivalence exams. next step would regional director, would deputy commissioner. might able get deputy job without PhD one ever one slot. don’t think I’d get without doctor. Well quit, something cowards left administration &amp; spoke anonymity: speak truth loud &amp; clear damage admin &amp; done. I'll take bureaucratic fuckups $1000, Alex.

Someone data entry near minimum wage associated test result wrong patient database row.

Honestly imagine people confused could happened held job past 20 years. roaring 20's roaring though. lot countries experiencing booms even economic chaos. Even US life rough people. Doubtful. Get tested you’re worried headache vague symptom usually doesn’t mean anything. Sounds like stress me. I'm glad feeling better! Interesting. think point depends source information used. Words piece paper mean what, exactly?

Constitutions matter lot actually. Except time kids heading back school country versus staying home. Let's see increase greater 22% July 4th mentioned article. neckbeard doctors Reddit saying cases going down? prefer Reddit fb, lol. Americans don’t REVOLT they’re taken advantage like this. 


Ooh that’s right. raise hell try take away guns.

Carry on... 


/S Danish Wikipedia correct dates? 
 

I Danmark er vinterferien en som typisk ligger [uge eller Placeringen af vinterferien afgøres af den enkelte og de fleste har lagt den uge 7, bortset fra kommunerne på på og hvor ferien traditionelt har ligget uge Fra og med blev vinterferien på imidlertid flyttet til uge 7 efter en aftale indgået mellem de 10 fynske [Bornholms har tidligere placeret vinterferien den hvor falder, men fra indledte man en forsøgsordning med ferien placeret fast uge 

I afholdt følgende 20 kommuner vinterferie uge 

* Nordjylland: og Østsjælland og Vestegnen: og øvrige 78 kommuner havde placeret ferien uge 7. guess it’ll become endemic multiple parts world. wonder effect general population understand this. 5-10 years line, etc. It’s quite sobering prospect given many (rightly wrongly) reject vaccine occur many viral infections. Fucking hell, like people criticize parts handling, critical. exaggerated all, annoys me. one knows would end like end differently, either way, thought would best end. many factors come play here, stop pretending know made like this. literally even possible lockdown due old laws, even. know, easier blame people say caused all, real world simple, neither us *actually* know caused what. also gonna call doctors make wrong choices criminals? case even know going like year (long-term strategy), Sweden could done similarly Nordic countries strategy similar doing. I'm sceptical myself, goodness sake get act together, really quite childish. know. knowledge opinion hows whys since speak Mandarin know what's going there. know I've seen hundreds videos January-March period China found worrying. California. back would probably Green Day, Offspring, Doubt, Sublime, Garbage, Bush, Linkin Park Muse. Propaganda works. government involved. FHM politicians sense word. So, identify causality chain here? know caused mis-c, caused Covid 19 hidden cause. fact percentage high, may actually indicate hidden cause, connected covid-19 may may cause mis-c, lead abnormal results. study cannot illuminate happens persons develop mis-c also worrying. thanks ""God's will. He's better place now."" Socially distanced fighting tho yeah? want get covid one stupid fucks. God created Darwins. must bad one. people trying convince give shit wear mask. better yet, certain idiots didn’t make ridiculous deal asked wear mask. thing could already weren’t drains society. using popular fictional example real life phenomenon. Wedding practices vary widely world evolved differently different regions cultures. 

There historical example could point make true weddings one specific purpose. It’s hardly useful judge highly varied modern practice based one conception tradition long time ago Also gonna chime say everyone it, schools absolutely try manage best can. best can. Half assing lead disaster. Ignoring disability rate 
Given high rates myocarditis survivors death rates seem pale ""It's rare,"" said increasingly nervous denialist 50th time According article 150 schools closed, 50% more. 6,000 schools, 50 closed past year Covid. actually sound crazy. assume 50 already financial straits prior this. dumb though. vaccines pipeline along antibody therapies likely make far less fatal. largely next summer US, question many get sick whether go lockdown again. Sadly, kind right people feel, lead horrendous third wave fall/winter shut everything back again. Hope I'm wrong. friends moved next June still think that’s early mean probably *could* get away small small ceremony wanted to.

275 people though? fucking absurd. dunno. seem pretty doggone well terms covid. course leaders worried issue. Weird ask post pakistan lol  According CDC vaccine covers multiple influenza strains including predicted strain: “Most flu vaccines United States protect four different flu viruses (“quadrivalent”); influenza (H1N1) virus, influenza (H3N2) virus, two influenza B viruses. also flu vaccines protect three different flu viruses (“trivalent”); influenza (H1N1) virus, influenza (H3N2) virus, one influenza B virus” Herd immunity take years reach good luck playing covid roulette. FTA : ""Ehresmann said health officials believed number undercount, health officals come believe guests tested order keep case numbers low, thereby allowing spread.""

So yeah, there's probably many &amp; pretty twisted people willing bury head sand avoid statistic, I'd assume helps political side. I'm Sweden, seems here, Summer holidays ended 3 weeks ago really uptick cases. Daily death rate back normal. Wow, even less reason traveling What’s wrong golf? prefer people don’t get sick. HIV literally still global pandemic. notably, reason able get HIV control shifted idea stopping virus matter ""individual responsibility"" placed onus people stop sex/doing drugs/etc., recognized policies unrealistic instead shifted towards model emphasized harm reduction, prophylaxis, treatment. want make comparison COVID HIV, COVID, still stage 1980's decided way deal HIV tell gay men sex treated like getting HIV deserved dared sex. beloved grandmother catching wedding dying. I've heard 2 variants Covid-19. many strains there? Another big thing remember take mask eventually probably soon get home. Suddenly aernt protected even perfect protection piece fabric. Save protests till later aernt putting people's lives risk. main difference almost nobody sturgis wearing mask, lot gatherings took place indoors.

Protests took place outside wear masks. That's new SIL was. Like...I get sucks man...really? Oh lawd, miss sneeze contest. fun! Not. Ugh. Like get it, want get married, I’m sure could’ve waited til next year. Go get paper ring feel like need it. Grab 5 people make happen. giant party later, safe. Hey man, mannequin love other, ok?! mean spoiled people lost jobs feed families? Yea mean can’t shut forever. People going start getting back normal without mandate state govt. it’s 7 months missed summer, going vacations, weddings, funerals, family reunions, etc. matter time people started saying fuck it. 

We’re already stuck breathing filth every day. 

(Not mention think Nancy Pelosi didn’t help claim it’s safe going salon without mask) wrong. Mexico there's test everyday. approach eliminate virus, obvious impossible, approach test people symptoms confirm virus presence use right treatment. people get tested positive go get test start feeling ill, obviously people symptoms get tested. 

That's Mexico gets much higher number positives per test. like US everyone even need test gets test. cancelled June told September knew wouldn’t then. right. courthouse wedding throw party dies down. That's easy counter: Finland, country much like Sweden went full lockdown, yet Finlands economy suffered less. 340 deaths. gap also called “quarantine.” Way shoe horn bullshit talking point. GDP -mortality rate correlation pretty well documented . economic downturn longer time likely lead cutbacks healthcare turn lead higher mortality rates cancer, blood vascular diseases etc years even decades. 


Also, large part covid fatalities among older people would likely happened within year anyway. negative excess mortality sweden indicator that. Meaning period last year people dying causes rather earlier year Covid like year. 


In fact, average time admittence death type elder care homes seen worst covid numbers sweden 6-8 months 2014. 20% die within month. tell something weak patients are. still tragic lack extra protection people failure Sweden done better. economic aspects correlation general health ALWAYS taken consideration.  people USA ain't sheep. HIV hoax! I'm sorry deal that. dad sounds stubborn ungrateful. tiny ceremony parents yard parents/siblings there. We’re every bit married people spent $40,000, 13 years never regretted skipping huge event. friend's father basically opposite experience - admitted covid ward staff convinced that's had. blood tests negative covid test came back - advanced aggressive leukaemia killed within four days. one allowed friend yell diagnosis via ipad hard hearing understanding doctors trying tell :-( Chinese propagandist. trust. Pffft Magic Johnson delayed inevitable! releasing something unsafe saying allow vaccine released sure safe regardless Trump says, please take get vaccinated like...most football team get infected tried cover up? That's like saying someone shooting random people blame, gun is. fact anyone thinks there's 40-45k new cases day USA reality laughable best. TIL life expectancy going kinda happens reason Fine actually. 80% cases asymptomatic. step-brother fiancé together 10 yrs. got engaged last year. wedding plans. guess really depressed didnt get graduation party (pharmacology graduate degree). now, she’s decided AbSOluteLY MUsT WEddINg next month.

Apparently one couple Maine caused massive outbreak hasn’t said word wedding made socials private. Wonder they’re feeling right now? ...and probably fines. Yeah fairness excess deaths US Europe similar ranges (US excess deaths approx 25% higher diagnosed Covid deaths - that's significantly less Spain's excess death difference, 50% higher, example, significantly Swedens Belgium). 

In undercounting EU US done much similarly say either Latin America, many places excess deaths full 2.5-5 times higher officially recorded deaths.

Lmao. affects in...no way all.   Reminds sister flew across country attend wedding flew across country next week visit grandma. Perfect timing incubate covid wedding airport pass high risk individuals symptoms set in! Completely agree  Oh seems hit nerve. I’ll leave wounded ego heal. Nice copy paste way thought Italy suffered kiss time socialized health care work? Didn’t even distance live rural community. I've heard many people express belief. long people using justification wearing mask attending large gathering. Yeah, we're rural, think people go want non-local store, specialty doctor, warehouse store? nearest hotspot spend day shopping eating out. nearest warehouse store 2 hours away. nearest Target 1.5 hours. nearest Walmart 30 minutes. English even better? Y’all like America’s mini-me point. state complete virus shitshow. 

What point trying make here? Paywall - town county it? Bloody hell. happening States?! bars still closed sweden. Denmark open. Hallelujah! Praise Jesus!! right went public school. public school education showing. 

Good you. city, unless want kid become drug dealer felon, send private school. fact, public school system joke here, dismantled. charter schools. school big city

Unless went ot public school dangerous city America, shut fuck up. linked rise cases.

How many tested. I'm still waiting exact number PCR tests done. far, one provided data, post handwaving otherwise. school district needs fixed, area garbage doesn’t mean every public school shitty. I’m sure catholic schools shitty too. don’t trust school teaches religion. It’s fucking cult that’s killed many people outside thoughts science killed even conforming religion. know Christianity one popular religions??? killed anyone didn’t conform beliefs. Sweden didn’t nothing, that’s dangerous myth spun media. 

Dangerous myths? dangerous saying masks [make     
Or downplaying role spread virus? pretending keeping school open [no children [don't spread [everything (sorry list incomplete: stops june 6.) Guessing hitting point people delayed wedding April September saying screw it. Even liberal friends seem it.   knows bad be.

The cause is, think, young people partying plus general slacking. Es privada del norte de México. Antibody tests basically useless, need ensure everyone tested take antibody results put pool. worrisome means one vaccine may protect strains?

Yes. developed immune response (antibodies) first infection immune response ineffective second infection, implication MAY getting vaccinated stop spread COVID. 

It may slow it. may stop certain strains. many strains, COVID could us forever like deadly flu. Further, could continue develop strains, could deadly. 

The alternative come understand others lost immunity time series vaccinations booster shots required. perhaps developed infection never developed immune response. 

One implication people thought “immunity card” allowing travel work you’ve recovered disease vaccinated. would put question. Online friends! :) mind wonderful thing!! studies said need wear masks. ""leaders"" said necessary sowed doubt scared shortages. Yet Sweden's economy much better. 

COVID-19 kills people either directly indirectly [poverty-related mortality]. 

In US, botched response, get both. Go queen/king herd immunity impossible virus mutate... attended protests good spacing among people, saw plenty photos people spaced - lot photos come certain flashpoints people tended crowded --- that's packed crowd 2 3 hours concert, maskless good portion time drink beer. 

Regardless, cities relax regulations enough allow concerts Ok kiddo. someone ""PhD,"" certainly know reason. School friend. feels like Scarecrow plot, honest. point, dna part DNA moderately dangerous virus $20 Sweden anti body test. Free kits sent house virus tests.  Wait, what? actual guideline UK health ministry? That's fantastic! shithole country now? would people harmed? saying locked even ppl would dead? GTFO.

Shit change become ""problem"" upper-middle-class white people affected. See also: opioid crisis. drug crisis happening black/poor, called creakheads throw jail. Go back school stop using circular arguments. long virus exists, masks, social distancing, frequent closures, banning large gatherings remain part life.

That’s 100% true, stand said. Consider double that.

Those mitigation tactics remain *part* lives. Emphasis added sake. Webster’s defines word, ‘part’ one often indefinite unequal subdivisions something regarded divided together constitute whole

So either words: whole thing.

This simple (most) people understand. community spread drops low numbers, resulting low risk infection, mitigation tactics relaxed. community spread inevitably surges back higher numbers time time, mitigation tactics reinstated.

In sense, measures remain part lives. get numbers low enough though, actually open schools. like America open schools without first lowering Covid rate, fucked yourself. *too far behind

I tired Americans unable understand countries great USA. 

Other countries done extensive testing, contact tracing etc. Tests free quickly available start pandemic. 

South Korea done that, still CFR 1.6%. tell Korea missed millions cases, full shit. 

Your best argument CFR around 10% South Korea. best case 1.5%, still pretty big.

I think people can’t handle vigilant long time. I’ve worked throughout whole thing close-quarters dirty environment air filtering system least half people building don’t take virus seriously. take solace thinking family already asymptotic still take reasonable precaution haven’t 

You can’t live life fear though . could get run next time time step street . look ways enjoy One closest friends getting married end October. We're going, feel guilty. told yet. know say. 

My husband quite high risk. I've hospitalized twice ""regular"" flu H1N1 happened 2009. asked hemotogist reaction pretty much, ""what fuck. would even ask obvious answer is."" know going could literally death sentence, feel like horrible person I'm truly worried end ruining friendship beceause soon husband asshole can't begin imagine he'll fill head us ""not her.""

They're taking procausions. gone 200 person church wedding outside wedding 100 guests. Masks social distancing ""manditory,"" especally bride MS. they're still buffet family attend country. Honesty, ""precaution"" good enough. Everyone might everything ""right"" worst may still happen. wish weddings you’re going spend life instead look drunk get see much paid centerpiece.

What’s wrong both? Rescheduling 2021 isn’t easy sounds. You’d competing couples already booked best weekends, trying find single weekend vendors (to you’ve paid nonrefundable deposits) available next impossible cases. 

It’s “easy” compromise. also don’t know things better 2021. don’t blame people going forward events. blame taking basic precautions (smaller guest list, hosting event outdoors, big tables less people them, providing requiring masks). 

We hear weddings DON’T take precautions cause covid spread. guarantee lots weddings happening, they’re taking precautions don’t hear them. claim mask slows exhaled particles; stop altogether.

Neither studies support claim OP made. get deny masks effective, claim made. mean honestly us tired shit. I'm mad officials mitigation efforts, I'm also going make people largely safe feel bad wedding. Personally large gathering, graduation/birthday party nephew nice hang people again. 

Before people say I'm perfectly aware spread people gathering. certain point thats life shit happens. country royally fucked initial lockdown never strict lockdown. Expecting people delay life going 7 months clear end sight absurd. birth mom, astranged, autoimmune disorder along constant surgeries age puts bracket worry. told can't wait see her, we've talking more, Covid danger like now. semi throes fit saying ""There's always excuse get together!"" pops night. made sit outside. Stay apart me. still, like talk Covid?? husband wear masks.

What talking about? bike rally Sturgis illegal. school football game hundreds spectators mentioned another comment thread illegal. Large gatherings permitted states. soon see large gatherings turn super-spreader events not.

Don’t perpetuate false information. Yep. rocket science. wife got married May, saw writing wall postponed public ceremony reception next May, even then, we're doubting happen.

Our wedding six people total including us, minister, two friends, photographer. want risk anyone else exact reasons mentioned.

It definitely wedding expected, nice actually married legal stuff way. eventually vow renewal ceremony reception, less stuff us worry except fun day family friends. run wedding band I've offering reschedule additional cost 50% deposit back. venues need keep lawns mowed lights on, imagine they're probably less forgiving.  Lol, I’m American live America dude, thanks assuming nationality. study done seroprevalence, findings likely around 10 times cases confirmed since antibodies don’t last long (but B cells do) lot people don’t test positive antibodies anymore doesn’t mean weren’t infected. going fall ass backwards Pulitzer careful. highlighted horribly country managing brought politics. nation idiots managed politicize pandemic.

Thats test per capita sweden, maby bit lower. town teachers say scared go back school, yet took families state go beach. can’t even take seriously anymore. blows over. might while. think people already ""fuck it"" stage. get taking basic precautions. wedding one thing, least make safe possible? guess want wedding photos masks. I'm surprised many people willing things. still 50 person gathering limit go get huge fine. somewhat agree thoughts, venue goes bankrupt, you’re money venue... venues either need gov assistance need continue hosting weddings. guess one they’re kinda forced into.... means 86% spread much larger number since didn’t know infected. wedding scheduled September year now. sent essentially ""uninvites"" 130 family / friends including originally planned best man best friend since first grade.

Our ceremony less 30 attendees spaced entire catholic church, reception. inviting original attendees celebration year marriage next September, pending covid progress. attendance year asked wear mask. Family traveling Florida arriving 2 weeks early quarantine isolation (biological grandparents) even though counties actually incredible low covid.

Our wedding important enough responsibly, family important enough take safety measures. anyone walks outside isn’t going help us.

I listen every laugh end, “I won’t able wound care, clean, cook, take doctor’s appointments. able pickup groceries, meds, leave porch. leave... better make last hug good one.” 

Dad doesn’t give shit. 

The owner Senior Daycare calls Dad. puts speakerphone. explain forced move house. says parents couldn’t survive without me.

Is possible reinfections we're seeing remainder--those never produced measurable antibody response? Yeah agree. pressure huge wedding actually keeping proposing. know Mom grandparents would want huge fucking ordeal wedding hundreds people I'm even remotely that.

 Initially PM shut schools go complete lock down. PM's verdict huge number labor workers earn daily basis able survive complete lockdown. business timings 9-12 9-5 sometime later (lots businesses would stay open till late night pre Corona).
But PM receive lot backlash locking entire country side KNEW people incapable maintaining social distance eventually transmit disease way that's unfathomable. Every doctor senior doctor associations press release asking complete lockdown knew people stop meeting.

/s ask people follow rules aren’t enforced long. haven’t national strategy trying responsible isolating 6 months cases deaths skyrocket around them. Many workplaces haven’t budged. example, work bank closed lobbies weeks March ask employees wear masks (which currently city ordinance us anyway). Now, try still avoid going anything groceries stopping convenience store work, get sentiment? Absolutely. It’s ridiculous ask, especially social people live alone. Framing major life events like wedding even going bar friends “being selfish fucktard” little ridiculous. actual selfish fucktards never worn mask, never social distanced, playing golf instead job national pandemic reason we’ve reached point good, sane people risking spreading virus sanity well-being. 

We failed country, shaming anyone walks outside isn’t going help us. Like kid movies, understand motivation adults done bratty teenager. rest world could give two shits college kids party. Yes. vaccine team CEO firm produces takes vaccine, I'd trust it.

If want it, certain orange politician forces roll political brownie points, way.

They quarantining students come contact someone testes positive.

This dumb bitches daughter went party someone ended testing positive told quarantine 2 weeks.

It’s ridiculous. masks effective can’t open up? One three leading vaccines using saline placebo...which pretty dumb usually days later pretty much know real vaccine People don’t want tests here. restrictions getting state test free. None. Appointments available next day. populated counties also site doesn’t require appointments. Walgreens CVS ALSO offering free testing. can’t force people get tests. wish luck contracts still got! safe! 
I hate photographing weddings tbh, even though I'm good it, absolutely hate stress puts everyone else make sure Bride happy everything perfect there's do-overs. definitely handle working wedding people refused wear masks keep on.

No wedding I've worked ever gone according plan makes stressful worth money made them, even though made pretty decent pay, mental health way important me, age Covid that's doubly-so! sister literally went wedding weekend. see masks snapchats.

Turns bride total nutjob, sis feels like go husband best man. 

Here’s one local websites. Cali restrictions wife neighbor acquaintance FB feed. refuses wear mask large church community. told attend without mask. Karen FB bitching church holding churches go allow people without masks. course Karen’s giving church. It’s appalling supposed Christians using god gave them. supposed fun going classes, work, spending hours reading, writing papers, studying tired go rare times caught everything? Yes say 3 months gigs. paid for, push gigs back 3 months. can’t double book. essentially still gap pay. tried nothing ideas! Right! would want moniker 'Covid wedding' Make 18 months. 2021 pretty much booked everywhere anywhere let book 2022 premium. I'll going ahead March 2021 wedding there's point rebooking it'll 10 responsibly spaced masked people venue meant 150.

Leaves lots time decorating, photos, clean up. outdoor wedding guests wearing masks probably near 100% safe. pa curiosity bc people around still haven’t gotten take really public. say honesty BLM protests 100 masks distant. majority masks packed cities Never said exclusive couple lol. end day, people want weddings though. People literally walk away get married too. pretty extreme. don’t even get appeal, wants wedding you’re worried everyone taking precautions. courthouse one legal benefits year wedding friends fam years ago. Nobody gives shit wedding party includes legal part, still ceremony vows. Amen sure masks gonna stop issue. People eat drink weddings, masks would coming off.

If gonna 275 guest wedding, masks ain't making shit safe. don’t believe propaganda. would annoyed you. mean lose sense taste kind breathing difficulties don’t know family isn’t least suspecting could covid. original purpose public weddings father (owner) bride transfer ownership bride husband, front bunch people, word could spread area bride's ownership changed longer market.

Weddings fucking archaic. great joke. also kinda true :D That's fine idiots wearing masks? dilemma. Colleges made bed lay it. * indoor wedding.

For fucks sakes, stop outdoor shaming. 

THE VIRUS TRANSMITTED INDOORS POORLY VENTILATED AREAS. 

There almost documented transmission outdoors. like saying ""Brazil dead per capita USA"". good news neither countries. think that's back administrators' minds. Problem can't say loud confused hell lot laymans.

If going fuck-it stratgy, say quit job lock away. got invited indoor 50+ person engagement party cousin later month. entire extended family declined--another cousin's husband's father died COVID early on, dad nurse saw worst rush pandemic firsthand, engagement party even remotely important wedding! Apparently family pissed fuck selfish. Thanks getting irked people took masks. dropped wedding bride informed us allowed wear masks photos. 

I'm going part stupidity. uk dismissed 5000 deaths. point already money. argument isn’t really valid It’s stories people keep calling selfish push blame individuals virus slander? know California New York lowest literacy rates union right?  Totally way go IMO. courthouse thing 24 years ago month. Saved money take vacations instead. Still happily rolling along. people knew big weddings around divorced now. wanted special day seems. ones breeding age ain't dying plus side, rural town would theoretically hit herd immunity pretty quickly. conversely, spread would slow enough could easily managed.

In end rural towns aren’t immune, pandemics always going hit urban centers hardest Exactly. area cold yours, true winter. I’m going ask plan inevitable 3 foot dump wet snow. there’s issue stagnant air within tents themselves.  expendable take vaccine, likely safer gambling virus Ah, yes, final solution. 


/s Well it’s somewhat understandable venue everything else booked won’t give deposit back. know outrageously overpriced “wedding” anything is.

People willing risk rather thousands dollars. even reply anymore. know go I'm tired explaining myself, I'm going change mind. see U P E R P R E E R S

are back peddling snake oil agree. anything else though support idea? Seriously, stupid people be? noticed there’s tendency NYT push d**mer headlines behind veneer objective reputation. Stuff especially attached institutional decline. Maybe they’ve always like that, feel like it’s increased COVID makes trust them. Singing indoors probably one high-risk things anyone group infected. dine, dine outdoors try find outdoor activities do. Misleaders. Taiwan

Eradication futile country filled idiots though, yeah, US even bother going route. need compare risks virus too.

If high risk group substantial chance needing hospitalisation chance dying, vaccine minor side effects less damaging virus 

Conversely low risk group high chance asymptomatic could damaged vaccine virus. someone catering business, say definitely point people care anymore. Left, right, matter. Since June, I've cooked least one wedding every weekend. one parties required guests wear masks. (Our employees masked, among things) state still number restrictions, based right border covid-apathetic state people found could rebook like covid exist.  Really seems like given country. rest world needs ban travel country long takes virus run country. Live Mexico strategy goverment prolongated pandemic availability beds Covid patients one determines restrictive actions due fact lot people informal jobs majority people Mexico live chechk check lockdown strategies used NY, Italy China non-viable some. Mexico political scene pretty divided actual president betittled actual opposition past opposition looks every fault, either justified unjustified, questioning use gain votes election governors 2021. division makes problematic Covid situation country  Almost certainly. reach full potential ambitious generally accepted vaccination program Indeed, fundamental one. NYC handled terribly rates high. Sending positive patients back nursing home killed thousands. Allowing residents flee across US spread it. play double header two 15 minute games game ends tie, start OT WR endzone - said Rob Manfred, probably. really ironic thing supposed do, could past feel like calling Pelosi that. irresponsible abuse position. One things looks good paper never works try real people Shit like getting fucking bummed, don’t care anymore. I’d unsub subs like stop reading news like stay informed. I’m tired much bullshit. Seriously, stupid people be?  cloth face covering usage varied time? 10% people shopping lockdown start? More? Less back then? month since - percentages member public? masks like - single piece cloth multi-layer? Tightly fitting loose? excuses, basic knowledge point 5 year old nephew understands easily. Meh. really LA Wedding DJ here. venues require 50% deposit refunds circumstances, even covid many couples stuck venue unless care losing substantial amount money (usually venue biggest cost wedding). Also venues offering limited reschedule dates, forcing couples choose Thursday Sunday weddings 2021 usually slow want effect 2021 business. Lots shady things going right save $. always. sister taking event center court paid full early(don’t ever this) won’t refund money. can’t meet governors restrictions gatherings nothing contract protects state government orders, putting fight. 

The two options gave were:

1. wedding planned, remove dinner tables everyone eat pairs standing cocktail tables ‘safely distanced’. dance guests lot allowed dance tables. 

2. Reschedule 2021 $3800. insane think literally colleges universities across country likely set around conference room decide. definitely said ""well, bring back likely knowing eventually shut get pay us tuition refuse reimburse it. going money sue us even win lawsuit goes far."" Nothing like major institutions America continuing fuck us midst global health economic pandemic. Mostly, make sure football stadium gets addition college star athlete education paid for. WAHOOOOOOO! coronavirus first detected. 

Nobody solid evidence virus first made animal-human jump. great hiking trip SD. Custer State NF bison cool. far drive Devil's Tower WY either. also big wooly mammoth bone site SD. said see living challenge, especially winter. No! Really? Totally random, still can’t get mind behind people think BLM protests essence politically motivated.

You people believe black people receiving end unjust violence state funded, organized group (which complete fact) people support BLM basically saying end disproportionate violence.

How democratic republican issue? It’s human rights issue. 

Fighting right executed bed sleeping perps get justice fucking political stance.

Police held accountable fuck blue red issue, god damn mean, US wasnt really made able fight pandemic, Executive branch really dosnt power much, leaving state individually figure things out. know phase 3 meant broader enrollment don’t know practical side it’s volunteer based...plus advertisements trials social media sites...again maybe idea platform recruitment elderly least posted link Wikipedia explain concept CFR, since don’t seem understand it. that’s ok. Nothing ashamed of. 

Because link Statista provided held data Number cases (reported), Daily increase cases, Number deaths (reported), Daily increase deaths Death rate. Death rate table Number reported deaths / number reported cases. CFR. magic “treatment efficiency measure” explains North American health care superiority there. Sorry. 

And use CFR wrong. Period. See previous comment people commenting. Like comment Somalia obviously efficient hospital care USA according CFR. 

So, need dumb anything down. least me.


More problems CFR: may wait phase 3 conclude mass rollout? 

Production necessarily biggest hurdle, physically rolling logistical challenge  absurd comment friend? Yea, seems like want miss social event anything. coming guy got finished saying one cares wedding except mothers...that’s rich. wife incredibly lucky. got married month shit hit fan everything shut down. Wedding / honeymoon one Hawaii easily best week life, can't imagine frustrating pushing something like wedding back would been, work money spent make happen begin with. Funerals way cheaper attend. gifts cash bar bullshit.  care lmao Don’t worry. still buy tickets donate billionaire endowment funds. long need wait feeling comfortable getting shot? That's problem here. Time. it. long term effects socially, economically, medically debilitating. Realistically, average person opportunity get vaccinated next year anyway. like offered tomorrow. Oxford working platform longer candidate. proven safe delivery platform. lot imagine, least doubtful would sustainable business perspective entire loss Sweden 0.27% total loss EU.

I think missed 0s. 564,771,000 564.8 *million*.

`Sweden total loss / EU total loss = 48.6B / 1.4T ~= 0.035`

Or 3.5% -- order magnitude off. -- Sweden's total economy percentage EU \~4.95%

Anyway, proportion tell *anything* relative effect two compared economies different approaches handling pandemic. Comparing absolute numbers without normalizing relative size meaningless usining percentages technique mask numerical truth. Low-level analysis uses percentages without providing full data. use percentages affect/mask perception change.

This baffling. Yes, percentage tell whole story, economists statisticians use precisely measure relative effects. Prior pandemic, also comparing different economies percentage GDP growth? Unemployment? think compare different government's absolute sovereign debt, debt-to-GDP ratios?

This feels like issue basic numeric literacy, I'm impressed analysis providing support claim (even ignoring million / billion not. include entire breakdown affect shutdowns EU economy? contraction nations significantly higher Sweden's.

I would interested also seeing thorough breakdown economies -- percentages gloss lot details, agreed. getting helpful trying draw direct comparison based total perception Sweden anything; so, source trying muddy waters say Sweden successful.

""Muddy waters"" using standard method giving high-level comparison different economies?

I'm sure basis insinuation source bad intent, except disagree (standard accepted) method comparing economic contraction based percentage EU countries significantly worse.

Yes... almost factors different economies affected pandemic (such reliance tourism, large part Sweden's), idea comparing Sweden economies similar closest way answer counter-factual ""what would Sweden's economy look like took stricter lack data source country-by-country impact COVID-19 makes data less reliable.

You really provide data claims. some, feel free share. Meanwhile, taken bit time would seen article pulled information Ok. high risk ppl reproductively active elderly?


Is explained them, ppl trials, first receive vaccine, viewed expendable? casual friend, also know invite simply increase total amount people attending wedding. Nothing says “the false negative rate really high”. think much less December, especially people going back school. really depends many vaccinations get really begin turn things back normal. No. underestimated.  I'm also sure tents cut get deeper winter climate - I'm Minnesota patios full (I'm going see drive past) way they'll able anything outdoors -20 windy. Psssst...they didn’t. can’t. retarded. Everyone's disappointed government's individuals response pandemic. Governors need put health business interests! People going large public gatherings wearing masks!

Wa, wa wa!

I expect nothing never disappointed. Okay, continue make excuses.  Actually phase 3 trial recruitment aims recruit wider demographic participants ensure effective safe across whole population.

Again supply issue, better targeting smaller group first largest.  kid, friend would mix common condiments make “bug killer.” almost seems like that’s we’ve come to. adults interact people idea they're rubbing elbows entitled plague rats. 

It's leftist shaming, shaming people actually want get side mess. ideology prevents seeing may want reassess reasons believe choose believe. They’re tragic wouldn’t compare 911 Pearl Harbor.

I’m saying isn’t tragedy people died covid, don’t understand comparison acts war feels like false equivalence Korea letting Sputnik vaccine country? 'hold breath 10 seconds' test disproven showing anything. I've actually hearing people getting tests back pretty quickly California now, might depend part in. Start looking people treat home call doctor. r/COVID19positive good place start reading people treat themselves. Apparently China isn’t allowed single thing good Wouldnt also mean Fauci raising false hopes vaccine, mean said certainly possible vaccine come  agree, remain cautious take steps prevent transmission keep everyone safe. think sometimes people misinterpret comments similarl mine, saw ""it's rare"" mean ""the virus nothing worry about"". definitely case fully adhere support message receive public health officials. don’t crayons handy make clearer:

* INSIDE: **RISKY** sitting extended periods time people around wearing masks = **EVEN HIGHER RISK**

* OUTSIDE: **LOW RISK** wearing masks, moving, social distancing, limited time contact people = **EVEN LOWER RISK**

The virus infects people political sure trying hard make fit agenda. downvoted? know salty worth thinking about, dont even need partisan it. business cannot survive naturally doesnt provide something unique indispensable, prop up? Empathy? That's throwing money away, regardless comes from! let business fight offer welfare ""losers"" pivot towards something else? unthinkable? Loss life loss life. tornado, also natural occurrence would less tragic since wasn’t intentional? TL/DL

1. Multi-generational families homes

2. Many workers food industries

3. Larger proportions communities make recent immigrants. (In particular Latinos) Fear ""public charge"" role prevent seeking medical care.

4. Black communities tend live large multi-unit buildings increasing exposure.

5. Black communities tend use public transportation higher rate.

6. Black communities disproportionately live higher pollution areas.

7. African Americans make higher rates populations prisons hard hit.

8. Senior care centers higher levels minorities hit higher Covid rates.

9. Structural racism playing huge role disparities.

10. Many early testing sites required drive-thru testing people color lower car ownership rates. doesn’t virus mutating even different strain, didn’t develop enough antibodies long term antibodies, could get infected once. tour guide lied one lies things? one couple even know many people want wedding? I'd struggle name half many people I've met last 10 years. That's *insane*, watched bunch livestreams rally itself. also much bigger group suffer least virus. 

With limited supply target old high risk biggest impact. Two benefits: one, immediately see risks older people front. Two, reproductively active young people endangered discover this.

It requires valuing next generation current last, requires detaching humanity act using people test subjects.

In view, elderly expendable compared young. then, fair, constant view regard disease beginning. did, that’s money for. 

Or think taxes paid for? clearly heard claim source right? source?

If hand read claim post online criteria vet claim make conclusion reliability? *socially distance However violence occurred, people lost loved ones. volcano tornado natural occurrences would say resulting deaths would tragic? think type thing going get worse people experience type mental exhaustion delaying important events lives. 

I think way counter getting serious finding jailing offenders masking gathering laws. First all, thank coherent reply thread. Yes, read article, leads question posted regarding accuracy media's reporting number deaths number infections. would thought, locking people inside social contact 4+ months would lead depression. Nice job fuck heads person replying probably knows sarcasm help.

the thing living hermit complete isolation really exhausting lot people. even I, relatively fine alone lot, realized much social interaction important daily life.

I know important covid personal experience least understand thought process good least try that.  blm bad. /u/nwordcountbot Jeff Bezos alone worth like 200kkk, insane. rest people suffer.  

I'm American, fiancée is. got separated due covid19, finally decided moving sometime early next year. still uneasy leaving US, think gets used living EU (i'm Germany) long term, gonna see benefits that. not, going move US, since promised like it, I'd go there, yikes. watched minute wish covid numbers higher it’s false equivalence. thing happened large group people largely preventable... wife supposed get married may moved august Arizona. side trumpist anti maskers side wore some. far cases Coronavirus popped up. Fingers crossed. Sounds like opportunity dodge bullet. That's what's happening US. proportion elderly dipped spread among young people, started rise again. argument have. someone else said, I'd seriously consider leaving her.

What kind fuckery us that?! might underlying condition work field?!😂😂😂😂😂

I'd rather jack end extended, catching COVID life, deal someone who's thought process warped. 

People suck. protests gonna happen anyways, cant exactly tell people stop protesting. No, rare diagnosed, due lack testing. virus likely widespread time got first case. Whataboutisim fun! happen friend horrible, ofc. still anecdotal. every sickness cases really horrible, determine act grant scale sickness.

how much information case friend have? mean, certain really covid19 weird thing?

her lungs basically working \~30% what? scary indeed... Herd immunity- lot hate term enough folks gotten it’s much threat anymore. like every virus that’s ever existed, despite panicked masses said would never happen. I'm confused - anyone believe propaganda? really meant believe BLM protests somehow safe outdoor sporting events, motorcycle rallies, beaches, public parks political rallies aren't? funding blatant faux-research? wait around 8 years, like always do. LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO talking about? led believe virus kills everything, healthy included. last time heathy population forced know 94% includes obese...diabetic... autoimmune disease...all things people live many years with.

If things sure, maybe stay indoors interact people. 

I get duped refuse look facts numbers point going think critically yourself. Hm... idk. sweden us responsible manage risk we're around, I'd say antibodies verified infection reduces whole lot risk regard visits elderly isolation. sooner alleviate kind suffering better opinion. Right. agree 100% dunno man. must hoax! /s That’s probably articles subreddit goes deep science vaccine. don’t think lot people care kind stuff. People care effectiveness, side effects, given public. again, I’m dumb American could me. hear sound effect Omg love 1 string hermit purple always math Trump crowd. 99% firearms owners use safely. least come something plausible. 1% causing mayhem? go opposite direction - 95% Antifa members want kill you. 100%.

Thanks heads though Fucking thank you. People seem believe everyone fucking arsonist something. small minority people shit. virus gossip. Sorry. realize that's jargon acronym. I'm always putting notes CRM saying LVM (left voice mail) known everyone would get right bat. I’m sorry really sucks. know doesn’t make things better panic porn people outs.  absolutely deserved get fired. People like part problem. 2008, 150 children (1/10000 vaccinated) Sweden got narcolepsy Pandemrix H1N1 vaccine. 

Similar numbers Finland elsewhere vaccine distributed. 19 year old york county woman got $200 fine mean (and article says too) restrictions like Spain/Italy/Wuhan/Victoria people told leave homes except essential purposes like getting food. Nonessential business like stores like shut people didn’t need go (to work) that’s keeping people locked inside. 

Right, certainly. But, case least examples listed implemented even drastic restrictions point pandemic reaching crisis (as opppsed Denmark, acted think that’s popularly called *shutdown* *lockdown*.

I arguing Denmark implemented lockdown opposed shutdown, took drastic steps Sweden (which article article says “lockdown” goes describe pretty much individual restrictions even Sweden had: avoid travel, avoid public transport etc.

My understanding article took similar steps Sweden also went further, implemented quickly. Also, many Sweden's policies given advice, Denmark made compulsory. business interests

Which same. Dead people contribute economy. Speaking incubation time, imagine everyone traveling everywhere visit family next Christmas, getting back home go party friends/co-workers new years eve days latter... makes lot sense, thanks explanation! really exposure community, seeing advertisements Sons Anarchy. reimposing lockdowns proving much harder officials expected. proof Sweden's approach still best.  time, Italy reporting 10%. didn’t think high trust numbers China. mean wasn’t making judgment call simply making point likely people going die soon anyway.  since brought - obese much dangerous thing terms health mortality covid affects people. it’s largely controllable person obese.  obese people country fact obese, covid thing would non issue.  aren’t freaking obesity? seems like much selfish lifestyle negatively affects overall health nation healthy people really would otherwise little concern covid. Yep. parents put Catholic high school education bill went went college public university, even factoring room &amp; board. hope lawyer that's fantastic closing argument. one us lucky enough someone ""mean"" protecting welfare. Makes wonder protestors shitting Fucking *idiots* 

Closes gets ticket driving.  agree. Aw man. Warning: Debbie Downer opinion comment here.. mention utter waste building materials efforts could used build things like shelters homeless Bay Area (where Burners come from), plus resources run event like gas get there, worsening ozone burning dozens gigantic pieces art reason enhance crazy drug trip experience keep warm riding unicycle naked. Fuck Burning Man. society environment already suffering. No, wants correct peoples wrong expectations. attitude ""don't worry, get vaccine next week"" cause lot harm, planing also credibility people involved creating vaccine. imagine backlash ""But told would ready fall? delays? vaccine insecure? This!!!!! MIGHT make home drunk hit someone. mean chance drinking driving. And, even hit someone, might come fine fuck another families entire lives. Fuck can't follow simple instructions. 

I work someone got COVID. grandmother died. Another co-worker, dad grandfather died Monday Wednesday week. Perfectly healthy that. something play with. Rate transmission, sorry clear folks Uhhhh excuse id love move US. agree capitalism consumerism. want live demo- socialist country id gladly give freedoms luxuries government voted people support nation well safety individual person put first.

The rich get richer here, everyone themselves. sad scary place. downvoted, responded issue reporting. certainly possible covid killed people would otherwise died months later, still died covid, really irrelevant matter responding to. 

Before Sweden went negative excess mortality, hundred fewer official covid death compared excess deaths. So, certainly underreported, especially early testing patchy. later negative excess mortality hides though, regardless cause negative excess mortality still wrong say Sweden reporting number deaths. top infectious disease expert served 6 administrations dating back Reagan told us 200k dead Covid. 

Bury head sand want, confused people concerned this. believe lot Catholic schools started US actually help poor kids. hospitals. basically much safety net US 1800s 1900s outside one's family. Catholic Church tried fill gaps, especially lot immigrant neighborhoods predominantly Catholic (eg. Poles, French, etc.). fact parents able buy house early 20s? Neither graduated college. complete bulshit. Reddit bois don’t social contact anyway  nazi.

Yeah, calling bullshit that. clearly get least 5 months immunity... (otherwise Sweden would spiking right now). And, immune response vary person person, existence 10 cases reinfection(for 25M cases) seems really irrelevant pandemic point view.

In fact giving immunity fading gradual different across people, it'd seem get QUITE bit I’m viral immunologist. I’m well aware immune memory works

So, guess question quickly immunity ""fade""? would typical expectations? He's paid understand. put walls roof patio. Problem solved. welcome Harley riders even wear normal helmets. smart bunch. prefer service members get sick. Well, duh. Man country high covid cases says country low covid cases can't prevent covid, says data fake. nurses would expect think whole thing joke, especially floor COVID patients. NUMBER 1! Hell yeah, that's right. Nah I'm there's lot dishes healthy there's healthy good obviously avoid fried stuff eating lots tortillas especially flour kind   Oh man. seen crazy ppl are. Alex Jones (that fucking useless shit) started whole conspiracy theory Sandy hood inside job take guns away americans. kids ""paid actors"" scare ppl passing gun laws ""strip"" away 2nd amendment.

9/11. thing. Inside job, somehow. everyone became fire expert saying steel beams possibly weakened fire enough cause building collapse. Ppl saying gov behind pass laws strip away freedoms. Somehow. 

All ppl live US. fucking insane americans really are. Fucking. Insane!! keep saying this, it’s another textbook example natural selection. Cosplayers. dental insurance. Hundreds thousands rioters, $600,000,000,000 damage, 40+people killed, 900 officers injured (some permanently) 15,000 arrests, almost masks, social distancing, according left, massive uptick COVID rioted areas, 0 cases riots...

🤔🤔🤔

Something's wrong math here.

What current death rates? Non existent compared cases.

We've flattened curve. 97.3% recovery rate. 

Hospitals not, overwhelmed point.

It's time stop ruining economy, time get people back work. wild, sphere every private school waiting list foreseeable future public schools closed. they're charging basically want people happy pay it. enough already.  Woah, 2 whole people? getting crazy NJ agree, goalposts shifted number times people stop trying chase them. Bikers tough guys, less likely tested unless sufficiently serious, might plausible explanation difference

LMAO! really suggest retired dentists CPAs make bulk (pun intended) Harley riders Sturgis somehow ""tough guys?"" Amazing. we, Trump fucked up. power something nothing sow discord doubt. appreciate sentiment agree you. hostility generally strike people well. understand viewpoint people heavily weddings such, reality is: wedding cost lot money, alot cannot refunded. lose-lose organizers.
The situation sucks much ultimatley, long proper precautions taken, willing one best friends one biggest days. 

Also, keep Walmart topic lol. go store less often still good amount COVID, always wearing mask always staying clear people. COVID scares. Also, family conservative think masks stupid reluctingly wear go stores health concerns since COVID started. 

Yes COVID scary spreading quickly US, proper precautions, risks cut drasticly. young healthy, chances dying covid almost nil. family invited family members wedding idaho, close 100 people, guessing without masks, say guessing cause gave emphatic no, going honey think twice going. mention family anti vaxxing, conspiracy believing group! Same. That, deaths unemployment rates making depressed. feel guilty happy spending time husband pets, making great strides financial goals, world outside little bubble fucked. Obviously people countries jealous America. I’d live COVID-rampant America Communist Vietnam lies numbers like China day. Lol Watch videos Antifa setting fire. Yes. 4 days, 3. “We need live lives.” struggled severe mental health problems entire life, say addition everything I've gone past, realization many people willing kill number random people risk inconvenienced take seconds put mask made everything significantly worse. Takeout- crayon eating child could tell mass gathering idiots going increase spread virus.

Studies subject showed social distancing net increased following BLM protests, likely increased stay-at-home compliance non-protestors. 

In words, protests literally net negative impact cases. who’s exactly denying facts here...? 

You read paper brief Good news introverts, guess. surprising! Denial isn’t river Egypt. America unfortunately laughing stock World handling COVID-19. Time new change leadership! Make America healthy again. So, read correctly, patient zero whole wedding outbreak guy went Sturgis motorcycle rally?

Who wrote script? seem like OAN man, fox liberal people. Eat ~~Help Out~~ Spread Covid point key words like ""new reality"" people screaming high horse going get tiring listen to. People want live, alive point everyone's going break can't blame anyone says fuck 6 months. people fined sent back line vaccine. still twelve states refused expand Medicaid. you’re poor live them, nothing. ACA, Medicaid. Exactly. buddy supposed get married June. wedding venue told either reschedule 2021 Monday-Thursday lose deposit...that’s people going it. feel like wedding right stupid. understand it. hopeful Oxford vaccine doubt would ready public end year. Maybe holidays? Yes. Sweden's daily Covid death rate 1 death per day. (That's 10M population). ""Normal"" mortality rate population ~350/day stay closed forever? 

I would say depends mean closed. piecemeal closing great, continue stretch on.

Experts said multiple times entire U.S. needs completely shut 6-8 weeks. would get Covid control. Everyone would still wear masks careful, point would able get closer normal. Gotta say, expected way cases associated rally. estimated 250,000 people there, wonder many cases would many people gone? wild single wedding bring many cases huge event seem cause near numbers ~~hoped~~ guessed Positivity rate fallen test count. likely due reduction infections rather nefarious plot. sounds like personal problem. I’m happy either, don’t imagine heartless monsters intended happen. [The pastor seems operating maliciously, add link &amp; explanation defense couple stems fact zero input them, don’t know attitudes, news articles quoting venue saying misunderstood (the admittedly confusing) language room maximum capacities state Maine. see pushy pastor confused venue lending misguided reassurance couple would alright. confident getting enough hate right now. Deaths covid down, deaths organ failure, pneumonia comas etc though. changed way coronavirus reported months ago number 1 news. days later suddenly numbers go down.

Same thing America changed reported Russia said covid loads pneumonia deaths.

The people know work hospitals say nothings changed since March. reported allowed talk publicly it. new frozen song

""Let spread... let spread... covid never bothered anyway"" Haha. This^ People need publicly name shame companies... Hey, that's true capitalism you. investment means sometimes lose. Can't say I'm sad see indoctrination centres go, hopefully better secular schools built place. people indeed, certain death. others it’s sniffles. would harder bear one got sniffles brought death lasting disability home family work grocery store, getting expiring myself. party motorcycle rally.

Your comment bit derailer, don’t think?  little selfish bringing up, probably, Woodstock year Flu pandemic (said pandemic far mild currently going through.) flu seasonality die summer, woodstock was.

You right though, given clusterfuck was, could legitimately shutdown wide variety reasons. friend mine delayed wedding August, decided much smaller ceremony close friends family, part wore masks plenty space. going ""big"" wedding next year with, given options, worked really well. test enough beginning others overestimated Indians' immunity .  cousin getting married month, 350 people expected attend. Fuck shutdown fuck politicians making people stay locked home this, scam don’t buy anymore. think ones indulging annoying parents big bash. every anniversary mired memory wedding killed grandma, Uncle Bob, two cousins, made dozens people sick including never fully recovered. Plus long-term anger blame family members even willingly participated, close loved one dead feel differently. Woof. Thats it. dare people enjoy life supposed suffer make sacrifices?! fun allowed! blood, sweat tears! Negative test mean nobody Covid. false negative rate really high. Going beach safe. it! fun! I'm going guess MAGA type Yes please two adult drivers, one long haul trucker many years ago. Driving long isn’t big deal us, 400-500 miles day usually peoples’ upper limit. USA! USA! We’re #1! Woooooo merica! summed things up, yeah mean could write books combination issues doomed us. mathematically possible statistics dependent variables 0 correlation. Independent variables imply correlation 0, way around. frigging champ family owes huge debt thanks. XS gloves. hands crushed many times.

Idk stuff, gloves get small hands. Fun story time need get chest.

My older brother essential worker. He's also kind guy refuses cover mouth coughs refuses wash hands dare say he's unclean. 

Whenever gets flu, often works customers poor hygiene, visits elderly parents (who take care of) wants take care him. He's 50 parents 80.

We high risk people number illnesses whenever brother brings us flu dad gets inch closer death get bronchitis month. I've yelling brother situation years mom coddles end.

One day came home straight work dipped unwashed hands ice tray telling us needed take COVID-19 test one co-workers showing symptoms days.

Yup, first instinct told might infected tell mom dad person, kiss hug.

After pleading mom force take precautions around us decided flat threaten violence. I'm physically larger stronger tell stepped inside house parents would beat living shit him.

As expect event caused distress family end mom understood right blasted Coronavirus news every day TV. another problem. TV stations giving air time anti vaxxers warning us coronavirus vaccine. elderly mom asks every day think vaccine going safe. rare still evolving. cases appear, go on. matter infection dynamics balances know severe situation is. 

Remember 1 case Covid-19 US? rare back then. Lol courthouse open county.

I can't even get zoom appointment get marriage license every appointment taken.  everyone duty nice. can't control others. Pussies Wow Rather wear mask protect fellow citizens would rather condemn world nuclear holocaust fragile ego handle pictures Chinese people pool party. Americans truly embarrassment humanity need forcefully disarmed. Would like gold star reading comprehension?

It difficult determine long time side effects short space time.

We however fact vaccine built mers candidate worked half decade. fact severe side effects vaccines incredibly rare, long term side effects even rarer. many others plenty rescue horror stories. Work full time? dog you. kids? Nope. Rent? Denied. fence? cannot adopt you. 

If pet adopted you, agreed upon random home checks. Thus feel pet suitable environment option whatever reason remove said pet. 

Not mention adoption process makes security clearance seem tame. 

Then question dog itself, rescues lie, animal's past homes. Plenty cases adopted dogs bite histories. Heck years ago woman mauled death area. rescue failed disclose dog several homes returned soon after.

Look good experience rescues make incidets false excuse. I'll never understand holier-than-thou attitudes adopt shop people rescues. 

 want adopt good you, continue support good breeders. Especially need breed specific purpose. reason got huge hold people lived normally acted like exist. Europe longest time 0 cases, weeks Italy started reporting cases thousands deaths. 

It naive think testing solve all. learnt anything last couple months take much grow much. motorcycle rallies, political rallies, even spring breakers beach. BLM protests, nope. America country thinks virus respect rights? really get stupid? People assholes. thought selfish person knew, I’ve got relatives who, religious, pro-life conservatives, reason don’t see problem hosting going parties shit. 

One said last weekend unemployment rate important. asked many people died unemployment far... *we given stopping spread whatever want long mask*


This stupid need stop. Fellow redittor ahmedabad, got virus June, got self admitted svp hospital..
Take care It’s right, doesn’t make good thing. believe religion place education, like place government. belongs church home. opinion, someone believes religion’s influence part problem America. banning remove sub visible? thought removed ability comment still read/view. kind misleading. intentionally pick lax response, government found legal powers lock people down, respected limitation authority. think important, especially we've seen several countries Hungary Serbia, governments abuse pandemic give dictatorial powers. long term, upholding defending liberal democracy important response pandemic - includes upholding defending standard living incite people revolt system. Literal Till death us part. don’t think that’s case. Pakistan lot people originally areas part India split. Genetically two populations would identical major cities. also astounds though, turning back purely selfish aspect, even think won’t die, don’t consider weeks like catch it. People shrug off, imagine trying take care two (mildly?) sick kids husband feel like death minimum week, probably more. one us asymptomatic, trying work, two sick kids sick spouse. sounds like nightmare me. Sis, touch nothing. Keep trucking path cause working well you. Huh? moron. There’s plenty people didn’t mask either group. amount people Iarge enough group remove lot fluctuations data. 

Your feelings irrelevant least great day. sorry - correct - lowest? This!

I swear, see one ""I'm forced go wedding"" comment I'm going lose it. 

No, forced, CHOOSING risk health, health around you, party deemed easier going party. very, very, things life actually ""forced"" do. Choosing avoid uncomfortable consequences ≠ forced.  politicized lets ignore biggest anti vaxxers / anti science / pro quackery shenanigand biggest flaming liberals existence. People plague rats like you? got married hurricane. wonderful, wedding planned. hey, important part happened, husband sweet little guy. there’s nothing hate people refer “the hurricane wedding” talk sad terms. important people got married. That’s mattered. seems like you’re blurring several different issues come irrelevant conclusion. 1. Health experts advising people avoid high-risk gatherings little actual power messaging, 2. actually power refuse implement measures state, largely owned corporate big money donors willing sacrifice lives profits, 3. completely agree (I would argue criminally) irresponsible leaders force responsibility individuals—most don’t skills time sift research make informed decisions fulfill civic responsibility (especially media outlets publish conflicting narratives) however 4. way exonerates individuals choosing make reckless decisions endanger lives others. Shwoooshhhhh

Missed whole fucking point CFR expected 1/4 places like USA due age distribution relatively young population. expected even lower due reporting people dying home due inaccessibility health care poverty. That’s looked it, wife ready give one point, it’s lot stress, it’s test couple, put together big event, wrangle family, ease tensions, deal drama, make it, you’ll good start. can’t, we’ll def shouldn’t getting married. clue OAN is. Lmao wrote Canada saying US, get many upvotes  seem depressed. talk DM like. even know IQ is? 

Also, what's hard votes? I'm guessing around 12 think edgy something? partner play single. met unapologetic one recently, food delivered. First clue completely ignored request contactless, forcing us take groceries person. literally waited door several minutes silence order so. strange reason also think possible spread highly contagious disease long 'have fever' felt 'okay'. informed us checked temperature everyday, apparently stops transmission Covid. course wear mask, proudly stated 'not one maskers, fine.' ??? area 80% mask compliance. stunned. half us idea viruses work?

I triple cleaned groceries day, considering going back bi weekly grocery trips. Ugh. American really can’t knock Sweden’s strategy anymore brains figure went wrong non-Western people staying together laws countries, certain ethnic cultural minorities United States high rates marital stability, even though legally subject laws everyone else?

Why United States, people high socioeconomic status also high rates marital stability? Big take away nowhere near herd immunity, remain vulnerable another wave. best temporary lull cases. they’re back cottages back school/work simply enough immunity prevent it. think it’s somewhat cultural. assumed ppl goal marrying love. heard anecdotal evidence friends 1st 2nd generation America consider partnering wisely rather falling love. 

So heard side surprised bc cultural bias. cannot say it’s majority. trends within Chinese-American friends have. Hispanic friends much love aspect white Americans I’ve met also love spouse, wanted partner went first available match. Usually super happy though, last example. others seem fine choice. Nah biotech. meth would fun probly. Looking cases Israel spiking NZ postponing elections; could midway this. nations nothing right got lucky. lucky got cases 🤔 Yes, know many people. also know they’re married divorce option them. Seems like.....a thing never needed said before? Trump isn’t lab making vaccine. Scientists are. don’t give shit Trump says doesn’t say given day. jobs create safe, effective vaccine that’s they’re we’re sitting couch bitching said vaccines. wish people would damn respect science. Americans killed 2 million Muslims oil proclaims champion Muslims China. Meanwhile, European countries ban hijab make fun Mohammed America stays silent. That’s way sports right now. 

Daily testing. US tourists, (like 99.9%) travellers chinese citizens mean earth time lowest levels hunger, poverty, crime time highest education opportunity. Even disease (which obviously time lows 2020 compared pre-COVID times) compared even 20 years ago.

The world getting dramatically better basically everywhere. shit problem. absolutely sympathize her.

Like said, everything told society. social contract “do say you’ll better it”.

Where social contract now? fucking aid deserves? help schooling?

Pandemic hits. Government tells everyone shut down. she’s told. Ok, needs necessities- housing, food, health care, child care / education assistance. red stain country position.

You know, people remember this. Pandemic comes again, tells everyone stay home. Guess, what? She, millions others remember this. remember hung dry criticized trying survive. Ok, well know, fool once, again. Next time shit goes down, people going ignore rules. Others buy guns. laid turn robbery, prostitution. Oh (not you, know mean) don’t like that? Don’t like non-rich dare fight way keep afloat? Guess spent dollars shelter, food, etc.

This among worst bullshit stories read. Fucking hate it. Obey social contract get screwed trouble. new lesson leaned - cost. Atleast would make Nazis put some.effort in. Instead Sweden ended cowards. CDC tracks total deaths. Keep mind recent ending weeks complete.  great fuckin country 12% chance catching something leave chronic fatigue brain fog possibly kill you. thanks. Mexico filled low IQ people, president dumber Trump. Like, damn. Stinky, dirty, sweaty Mexicans. Yuck. even think we're antibody tests right now. referring standard PCR test. Sweden took economic damage Scandinavian neighbours. It’s highly export dependent economy. always unreasonable think could somehow protect economy adopting different COVID strategy. Im guessing haven’t lost job due lockdowns? Covid I've attacked strangers even relatives online. ""Suck up, people dying even test positive"". 2 1/2 months later legs feel like bricks can't get stairs without breath tell suffering. would, wouldn’t. Yes life go on, would changed. Lol! worked labs. they'd almost think firing problems worked like lol.

Judging communication skills, making safe guess said lab meth lab? what’s magically going change then? aren’t stadiums full since March? come France, 2 waves coronavirus cases, first one resulted wave coronavirus deaths? people get virus staying home self-isolating. do. Social security numbers. It’s called stretch goal reason! I’m sure top it! Keep telling make happy. 

Deaths drastically well. bizarre, poor wasnt like ' got time educate kids'? Delaying career could cost hundreds thousands dollars long run.

Suppose first post-college job pays $80k per year, save 25% income. $20k worth $300k (even inflation) time retire. delaying six months, go ahead cut half, that's still lot money. year, lol. guess 300k Hawaiian miles used anytime soon. last 4 flights late June shit show. 2 flights gate agents scan tickets mask nose. Probably 1/4 passengers improper dangerous masks, face shield, nose-out masks, poor seal, types may actually increase risks others. Nevertheless hand drinks 30 minute flights everyone takes one mouths noses exposed time. Even instagram posts touting safety show workers improperly worn masks. threaten lives hundreds people banned year? USA...for profit health care, morons. 🤦‍♂️🤣 Agreed, suggesting would solve problem underplays big issue is. far incarceration. wealth inequality poor public education leading counterculture value family unit quite much need order get by.

We need let black hispanic people system wider level. Want people value things value? Try letting benefit playing along ""society game."" long black people feel system working benefit, not, they'll reject traditional society. Instead school, they'll join gangs. Instead going college, they'll get minimum wage jobs.

Let's real, college-educated black Hispanic (or white/asian) people leaving families. people disenfranchised invest society's cultural values. Ya frustrated antibiotics didn’t work friend suggested it. ten years ago. 
Surprisingly four years ago bad lung infection went doctor antibiotics. said wasn’t bacterial try golden seal. Yet worked. It’s pretty cool stuff neat science behind it. allies invade scandinavia....because Sweden.

No. missing point. Sweden *and* Norway. iron ore shipped Narvik winter harbour Luleå got iced still Swedens falut. kinda rediculous got away easily tbh

What Sweden's fault? war? clear, Sweden also traded Allies sold ball bearings needed build vehicles. Much Swedish merchant marine also conscripted service Allies 270 ships sunk hey, trading nazis bad dont give shit ""Vital"" think victims nazis dont give shit either.  stop defending fact Sweden basically axis power.

Look. little doubt Sweden refused trade Germany, would invaded. recall, Germany defeated occupied Poland, Czechoslovakia, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Greece, Albania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Denmark Norway. think Sweden would fared different? Hitler never cared neutrality. invaded thought needed wanted to. felt like it, could marched couple divisions across border Kiruna fact plans eventuality. would afternoon. reality Swedish government contend with. fantasy land options. Oh guys hate China much. Even minimal progress EU country labeled ""good news"". 

Any progress china pity. HA Ha ha. think anger understandable, guy brought himself, dying thing gruesome ordeal slowly suffocating pass.

The hospital staff providing palliative care help ease process still humane thing do, even ignorant. make difference behaviour? subconsciously continue trust people/life reward self-control, even adult make short-term focused decisions. massive increase year year deaths anxiety related causes? 

Anxiety specifically related covid situation, sure.

I'm saying accounts *all* excess deaths, suggesting accounts non-insignificant amount.

As said, mother stroke April, solely ""Covid anxiety"". sure situation unique. even care facility outbreak. watched TV, feared situation. cities countries bars, concerts, nightclubs open hundreds thousands attending without precautions? questions ask researched easily. Im going bother taking time spell completely ignored last post. immunity last forever? Maybe maybe not. sit thread bashing everyone taking thr pandemic seriously ignoring statistical models showing wrong ridiculous. Could link them? far find one medical community knows whether genetic risk factor ups overall risk clotting COVID-19 whether happens ICU mild cases also. USA kind national ID number like almost every country Earth. neck woods. local gas station (yes, one) FINALLY forced start enforcing masks employees, area state trooper, typically patrols Detroit area harder hit strict threw fit started threatening tickets health department intervention. wish knew trooper, I'd send thank card. 60s...he probably already reproduced. Nobody calling coronavirus management last 8 months success. success death rates low right now. Rest Scandinavian countries exact problem. adapt old phrase situation: “Better early never!” 8 rare considering there's 10 million infections worldwide. Anytime 8 10 million I'd say 8 rare. actually asking seriously? Facebook cesspool. thing called methylation disorder causes low folate b12 levels take synthetic vitamins helped lot. pretty amazing getting downvoted this. 

People seriously depending on, trusting big pharma stuff?  Right. literally zero connection it’s fluff, since article headline Covid-19 children get millions views. That’s probably maybe nothing poor, given different groups communities come poverty prioritise education complete polar opposite directions. 

Maybe we've looking wrong area assuming things incorrectly decades that's reason mistakes continue get repeated. Understood. makes sense. I’m usually stuck come scheduling rotation. It’s five kids versus days often move frenetic pace. found time morning, gathered went. recent world seems situation something opportunity arises increases likelihood won’t able get done timely manner. 
IHME projections seem high. projections consistently lower actual death tolls concerning. global projected death toll particular seems ridiculous. 

Global projected New Year’s Day 2,811,777 
  2,811,777 - 882,294 = 1,929,483/117 = 16,491 deaths day next 117 days 

US projected New Year’s Day 410,451- 192,287 =218,164/117 = 1864 next 117 days White House floating idea issuing Emergency Use Authorization safety efficacy data in. 

It's real issue, they've done things like hydroxyclorequine EUA. Shout US kiwi friends there. 

I would like mention I'm still 50/50 marmite, I'm open second attempt. everyone like one things pretty much stereotype point? Stop tool Also, car loans *cheap*. got loan 2% interest (or maybe ever 0%), stretch long possible? least park money bank get ~~2%~~ ~~1%~~ 0.8% interest it. make 1k double every person fLu. rELaX. dare save lives locking dangerous people! /s China's allowed European travellers [a weeks Sweden's late party due Coronavirus handling. course Good news nutjobs take mean need lockdowns measures like mask wearing parts world. 

It exactly success either... 500 deaths per million one highest world. They're still letting people masks seal properly around nose, bandanas increase transmission risk, leave nose exposed. still let people take eat drink. even 1% population infected, large planes infectious passengers. I'll pass, thanks. Absolutely. Every day uphill battle, every get flat spots part got keep climbing. Hopefully someday 0.1% population horde 90% world's wealth. make every single fucking post sub “lmao fuck America country anything wrong”, heaven forbid criticize mindset. Ah yes, especially genocide stuff. leave advice here.
Do trust info see media I've reddit nearly two decades. people refuse listen people want contribute discussion.

You absolutely incorrect open change key here. can't abide trying squelch people's opinions. contact tracing would disease like covid-19 (if could) much different CDC flu.

The CDC attempting get good estimate number cases. collecting data it. nothing like full contact tracing countries done covid-19, try spot every case, ask person gone interacted recently, go find people might gotten disease test all. r/Coronavirus mods stupid know get grace period student loans, helpful trouble finding job right school?

If take six months off, use grace period. lost mine studying abroad semester. New York State, right it’s 700-800/new cases per day, 20 thousand per month.
 That’s Wuhan level late January. think don’t know this? literally spelled it’s influence poor. Read message again.

Single parent = less income
Single parent = less time children
Single parent = stressed

If earners = money, less earners = less money.

Influence root cause. single root cause, many influences.

Like said before, averages. course someone going come say “but XYZ”. What-about-ism mostly way try point argument favorite topic ignore everything else.

In social science argument people using hard numbers, repeatable studies, unknown number dimensions problem, paint picture like, totally ignoring largest influences family dynamics.

No matter parent non-custodial parent child does, always way point “other” factors. use large data sets, show outcome similar differences across populations similar different behaviors situations.

Nobody (who care listen to) example going suggest “two parents best” one parent shown abusive, puts child risk, abusive towards parent, etc”. guarantee I’ll see sort argument later though. know many single parents. know costs them. first choice? No. better option had? Usually. choice matter? Depends.

I get it, it’s hard predict parenting quality partner, point is, partner certain measurable traits. Income, time home, time child, much s/he helps out, etc. parents split, things disappear. fall single parent best manage. enough? Depends. low income make better home single abusive partner. also careless pick partner chance sticking around. ""I'm triggered, triggered!"" That's what's already available. manufacturers, even Russians point, published data reviewed peers accuracy. quite accessible anyone internet connection.

The politicians control data say trials run. Sure convenient virus comes China social control can't. Oh wait, convenient, came right fucking biolab. 2018, 2 years 'novel' CV-19?

Better killing grandparents. Coronavirus spreads motorcycle rally BLM protests. Didn’t realize virus political. 🧐 boss believes we’re around enough work we’ll fine wearing masks. Exactly, best covid vaccine successfully protects us serious infection, there’s still argument care small minority people won’t take it. Unless, course, little science public health. Thing is, Muppet guy who's running show around parts. expect people behave? guys voted in, (or atlessr close half) stupid is. Yea nah wrong buddy Mexico spoiled like USA yeah would've filled fat fucks reality many people starving struggling see say mexican food healthiest protests parties? Better April, right? demonstrating pretty stunning failure basic comprehension continuing spread misinformation. ""Better"" treatment thing ""easily"" treated. distinction would obvious 5 year old. 70K+ died since May. killing people masses even improved treatment. liar. Stop spreading misinformation. Yes it’s a** paranoia belongs! You’re welcome sweaty Hell yeah. That's perfect way it. Looks like mistaken. country still holding up. First time dealing Americans?  garudasil bs antivax rhetoric. Yeah look upvote count articles good news vs articles like this. get it. shit sucks. we’re fed information like it’s worst thing ever happen. I'm overweight ton. american standards I'm average.

But got really bad asthma allergies. Everything I've read says people preexisting lung issues fucked. ain't risking shit. Yeah get weakened form virus give worse long term effects actual virus. know vaccines weakened form virus, still fear understandable. it’s way much it’s perpetuated media, you’re right it’ll take people get it. Yeah could kill someone. doubt hard, still totally irresponsible cancel go severely reduced guest list. Case Fatality Rate absolutely useless unless getting every infected case. obvious country is, limited testing. number infected know doesnt represent reality time european countries worst, testing wasnt widespread available

Also, getting personal seeing arguments get less credibility, fucking moron. Good night People need make aggressive commercials/adds awareness covid like ""ugly"" hi impact adds cigarettes drunk driving past

And show footage people beeing really sick there,

This like sudden allergy discover, got puffed feels throat ass tries kill you? well covid, same, never know lucky one puke shit lungs, really wanna risk it?   Nah, that’s attention social media schmucks. France testing quite lot now, compared previously. numerous sites within 5 minute walk apartment Paris stop free test. Can't fully agree interpret views. agree covid it/was handled US. 

At point rest europe now, (europeans) might well let virus spread slowly. got low ICU/death rates. Rising cases mean something translate significant deaths/ICU weeks following. deaths stayed low though, good news. Less people hospital. 

I'm thrilled cases rising again, feel people getting tested. least, hope case. Glad worked played loaded guns safe, doesn’t mean I’ll say it’s ok. gonna make think it’s ok. I’m glade fun. understand took safety mesures. still doesn’t mean douch holding gathering. Btw protesting fellow Americans gwtting killed worth risk. wedding postponing till it’s safe bring STATE FOLKS wedding ok. Cool, wore masks. people eat wedding?’vn. Drink!?!?!? masks I’m assuming. folk take temprature quarantine 2 weeks going wedding, idk. really take procotuons regulated Fauci CDC, saying appease people. guest list. cut people, people jut show up. Please, celebrated wedding lots people(30 still lot) every thing went well, cool you! STOP PREACHING REST WORD, WONT GIVE SENSE VALIDATION. call ass mentality suggests others it’s ok wedding state folks. DONT AGREE THAT. Keep trying defend won’t see ok

Edit: well since wedding ssssssoooo rightiuse safety procotuons, wouldn’t mind linking photos show wedding covid would look like would you. would help point safe demonstrate others. Hell, would put mind ease y’all weren’t fucking us. get fun I’m sitting worried grandparents assholes like you....


Edit 1: another thread stated this.  
  
Edit: mention people don’t connection people wedding could effected people. LIKE FACT 3 DEATHS ARTICLE ARENT PEOPLE ATTENDED WEDDING INFECTED ATTENDED WEDDING.
  
   give fuck
It's fucked there
Rn cartels full blown war know I've observed throughout whole pandemic people little threshold inconvenience. know make sacrifice. Back day, people made sacrifices war efforts stuff. now. upon time, resources rationed support WWII. buy leather purse kind food wanted wanted it. spoiled misguided nowadays. want want now. SHM. I'll see ""Can't"" raise ""Can't Make Me!"". live outside town 2600 people. family still get crusty open mouth looks everyone wearing masks....even family members know contracted COVID. heard many talk stupid State pandemic policies are. keep mouth shut. family Washington state ground zero knew 3 people died it. Real enough me. Even want wear mask, stay away me.....6 feet plus. want near even COVID.....not much changed. Reality. wonder much socially distanced concerts (like one UK) recently making. remember video people sitting outdoors groups spread out. I've never seen concert people sit. Coronavirus likes Worldometers says 88 US Military 3044  Sucks people went wedding aren’t ones dying. get others sick. It’s 100% ok die. stop infecting. young healthy ones going spreading it. Give immunity can't spread it, meaning virus get elderly at-risk first place. True that. even life general. living costs ridiculously low Senegal completely surrounds Gambia fairly large tourism industry dry season.

A lot Senegalese go work Gambia months year live quite comfortably rest year. Events occurring keeping steady. I’ve learned anything COVID-19, it’s sadly many people care themselves. possible around lot longer considering first case China actually November. thought tone okay. valid question, especially considering point hit on: make money costs US. could avoided regular people looked way banks corporate executives were. people fending crisis, people get desperate selfish. Unfortunately, case means people get sick sometimes die. I’ll bet $5 everyone got married year pretend didn’t try save face wrong side history.  families 80%+ members vulnerable going Christmas. Christmas isn’t worth risk, especially someone dies person Christmas you’d never able enjoy holiday again. Postponing suck. I’ve done twice moved wedding June 2021. much it’s sucks it’s responsible right thing do. wants outweigh public health. would take long? think people conservative timelines reason. Production continue pauses entirety winter. There's reason think take 6 months even begin vaccinating entire population. actions one individual enough condemn entire country??? 

No actions CCP completely failing handle fighting countries enough condemn them. blame like blame country utterly incompetently failing handle reached America. 

You mean fake masks flooded market with? fake PPE sold hospitals? yeah fuck Chinese government fuck chinaboo.  think actually convinced more. 

All Gas Brakes released video couple days ago pretty much confirming that. people insane: Statistically speaking, age 0-39 chances dying COVID super low. That's exactly Americans say salty euros shit saying it. wet blanket. course vaccine developed short time frame unlikely “silver bullet” end pandemic. 

But say it’s “false hope” garbage.

It isn’t false hope, it’s knowing might vaccine effective enough *stop people dying* enough eradicate virus.

This virus isn’t going anywhere. It’s endemic, time likely nothing common cold virus like coronaviruses. first vaccines won’t perfect, help us get back normal don’t worry hugging grandma sending grave. juvenile morons start tossing around “oh you’re scared”

Yet they're probably ones insist keeping guns ""family's protection"". Case fatality rate measure treatment effectiveness. single important metric treating sick.

You advertised seriously low IQ.

Maybe delete comment. back claim sources? good actually. mean India’s mean age population like half us. Atleast covid *cases* aren’t bad. you’re youngerish healthyish what’s odds Covid deadly... like .00295%? Sooner better. wanna get hopes disappointed. There's disruptive technologies works. 
Ziccum company working removing temperature aspect vaccines entirely, turning powder. 

Exciting stuff coming, especially low developed placed earth vaccines hard manage due costs climate controlled. sorry got stupid protests it’s time let folks vote properly

You don’t get pick choose democracy Well people have? aren’t freaked them? get laid! Sounds like jerk. home. Good you. oxygen levels right fine, thermometer ill check everyday feels little selfish find silver linings pandemic, one relief longer feel pressured ""real"" wedding, instead I've always wanted - simple outdoors ceremony parents, his, minister. reduces stress, expense, risk instigating / contributing outbreak. Kudos Senegal, teach many countries! Even CV19 really popular venues typically reserved year, always spots opening it’s never 100% booked. It’s length time wedding planned, guests notified advance, etc. typically venue booked wedding pretty far out. Otherwise end situation trying find venue last minute. Sometimes happens anyways, like sister who’s venue got flooded crazy storms 2 weeks find venue book catering etc. since original venue going take care that. headache don’t want! panicking particular though? merely bring topic people accuse panicking inciting panic. Pumping bang

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) even read article headline? 

“We’re saying protests didn’t cause cases, assessment require substantial, additional analyses” added. “It’s key drivers, would expect places protesters biggest surge, and, fact, opposite case.”

America Americans country stupid enough think everything revolves around would somehow political. isn't. virus. give fuck political party follow are.

Get yourself. important. one study read article pretty inconclusive. Well, upvoted you. Personally, would’ve waited I’m glad took possible precautions things turned well.  Fair enough. don’t agree literally size event risky right now, seems like generally agree inherently “correct” wedding, whatever couple/family thinks would best fit vision celebration. declined wedding brunch day outdoor wedding. “You like, it’s wedding day I’m going stop living life afraid everything.” OK THEN. Wife Tazewell.  miss all.  NeeHi Moon Pie.  Rocking bus real rocks football games Grundy.  

Long ago... like people Math. else complain it? healthcare workers, teachers, principals, athletes, high risked, cops, firefighters, etc. First state open virus ran train thru state summer heading winter people never got get got would gotten rid communion. Hell got married Catholic church covid said way. USA’s numbers rising, accelerating. 

Sweden’s numbers also rising fast US. 

And fair, headline produced Swedish audience Swedish intent spreading fear.  Well he's still preaching person probably does. Probably reason people posted negative comments last 2 months. can. misunderstand me. far understand considered immoral give life saving medicine like vaccine, thus samples within trial get real dose vaccine. Instead, compared general population part takes long vaccines approved.

I could well wrong, understanding. Lmao also don’t get care refuse take vaccine. It’s choice. It’s also choice get sick. makes zero sense serious? don’t understand huge risk indoor transmission (especially unmasked close prolonged contact) versus small risk outside, (majority masked) transmission serious catching do. We’ve known since what, May June? It’s political it’s virus works. dropped siblings wedding party still attending socially distanced ceremony only, mask. Reception 200 people well back yard. Thankfully ok (at least me) also feel weird sense guilt obviously distance relationship since broke news decision them. Everyone else going like it’s good though. hate position. plenty jobs. Trump's followers believe say people are.lazy etc. 🤦‍♂️ Make classes circular teacher middle issues hearing. get it. Reddit bad (not saying completely wrong here), here?
If there's restaurant town consider absolute worst place eat, still go eat there? sort central body could help educate people dangers use data help promote safe strategies. Man, would really awesome. Biology generally one class take school totally forget it’s primary field. request raw data google GDPR. IDK there's trustworthy tool visualize location history. might want privacy's sake. elderly get side effects long guarantee there’s much long term effects getting actual coronavirus. Yeah people look day day stats don’t see big picture. week week, we’re making progress I'm well aware that's possibility (not inevitability--common cold corona viruses confer lifetime immunity, I'm feeling pretty good we'll get least years one)--but reinfections moment appear genuine. They've traced first second infections genetic fingerprint shows different countries. only...what, two three confirmed ones? one theory people outliers, people mount robust immune response first time around vulnerable reinfection sooner. thought could small percentage show antibodies even soon infection. would take vaccine fake disease Bill Gates adding microchips too? thinking along hardcore anti vaccine people, think lot refuse. Sorry hear that... Best luck! Keep lots soap hand sanitizer handy, too! Cases frighten people though. true metric hospitalizations, serious complications death. Using number cases imply virus serious harm isn’t correct. Viruses don’t evolve deadly. evolve less deadly. Coronavirus depends host survive spread. host dies quickly, virus would wipe efficiently spread become extinct. Young people unlikely die even obesity raises risk still unlikely die. Yes know this, unfortunately leader focused deflecting blame pointing fingers get reelection. Corona = instant death Use fucking tests have. Test everyone going elderly center. still say this. idiots guilty murder. long going live like this? uncle it. He's 74. signs ripping hot fever, deep deep cough. Right, this. venue close, you’re money venue. It’s shitty situation everyone involved. big anti-lockdown/anti-mask protests Europe.

That's thing, lot contracts written language global events getting way. issue vendors simply bend language hindsight unless couple wants litigate effed. dumbass. dont agree large gatherings. opportunities sage get together. got it. I’m burning mask, throwing party, leaving year behind.

Anyone chooses take vaccine choice. Meanwhile we're still stuck eternal first wave. don’t want major religion sponsoring education, matter benign seems.

Nobody forcing kids go schools. Americans freedom make decision themselves. educate millions kids without costing really taxes. acting like talking camping wasn't. I'm referring restrictions urban parks beaches. cancel camping trip, trust me, happy it. one's happy pandemic affect lives. case figured yet, accusing pretending know better actual experts.

You know 8 26 million cases represents true rate reinfection properly studied. Stop pretending do.

We heard (read?) first time, going accept conclusion interpretation. trying tell reasoning flawed, clearly want listen. Well doctor thinks it’s possible got tested. shall see. fuck yes. actually think would lead place despair would return. already feel hopeless. Masks. Outside. wedding mask inside. Shut fuck up. “What mother got bad cancel honeymoon pay $16,000 medical bills?” NUMBER 1 baby! Sweden single individual households Denmark, highest % single adult households EU.

Not exactly sure solve this, preferred solution is

1) Government pays upfront, negotiates costs university.

2) Attendees pay back later taxes.  safe vaccine since everything rushed? mean, would make sense would safe despite rushed entire world working vaccine together. Instead multiple pharmaceutical companies trying race vaccine attempts make lot money. trust pharmaceutical companies produce vaccine circumstances doesn’t negative side effects (or negative long term effects)?

You dont belong sub. Try work anxieties somewhere else. France's positive rate much higher US also test nearly much. There's always general ""but Europe control"" idea situation France really, really control. concerts, weddings, funerals Doesn’t mean I’m defending entirely asymptomatic. highly dependent individual. small town people 13 confirmed cases 5 died. 3 older people two younger. 23 15. I'd say youd want best avoid getting need overly cautious. Wash hands wear mask public areas high risk patient high risk area. Thanks, interesting site.  stop Bland Dairy Queen every time drive through! Gas always super cheap, though usually cheap Wytheville. Suspend even teach guys get free money NYU classes/semesters like 50k like $1mil got free?! no, haven’t heard? It’s selfish ignorant want celebrate things people. Also remember anything costs $10 tacky wasteful, you’re materialistic disagree. Sure, Ivan. dead friends would take exception, except died Covid. think 18 people legitimately quarantined two weeks wedding?

seriously. still go work every weekday I'm swamped projects. Also going already use limited test kits US already prove I'm sick. Fuck invite zoom shit that's overkill. one happy guys could fun regard, feeling, emotion, empathy fellow human being. Good luck asshole god speed. Please link “hundreds” verified reports reinfections. Make sure “reinfections” weren’t testing errors, too. ""for now"" rapid antigen joke.  Im gonna pray guy. Asian hes speaking protection measures taking. certainly hope doesnt get death threats Fauci getting.

Its insane someone wants protect us gets death threats dont like message. strains similar still immune first one would immune second one too. country billion people, .1% enough per day. Remember ""becoming statistic"" there's actual survival bias getting tested - test positive may able work 2+ weeks. may seek expensive medical treatments. There's LOT people US right can't afford miss 2 weeks work, especially means earners dual income home stay home. - That's even get possible doctor visits. 

Add medical costs it.. well that's recipe financial disaster probably american households. Hahahaha, classic +1 It’s shocking far first death I’ve heard considering rally attended 500,000. wear mask haven’t left house since June. get confused numbers reporting. still india. sorry Indians here, know I'm talking though. thank people get flu shot that. Someone changed descriptive text associated item number appearance updating old entries.

These probably generated database fucking retarded think group people would elope party later, group people want wedding middle pandemic they're impatient share little overlap. zero proof, admittedly. cousin wedding alabama couple months back. masks. 200 plus guests. entire extended family. mask, nuclear family too. left right ceremony dad looked said “GET here” 
We got fast possible. still cant believe cousins that. dont know anyone got sick theres way everyone wasn’t infected. Ill forever remember terror dads face said soon could “GET OUT” felt like horror movie Start Pumping bang shit!! Im ready it! What??? better?? party infect others risk? Surely young population, right? that's equivalent 250k tests here, believe managed. capacity major areas due decline symptom presentation overall. Autumn, even autumn yet. mother husband say stuff us like that. We’ve seen covid outdoors masks. They’re high risk got upset asked wear masks wore too. got mad said asked us come house. Meaning indoors without masks. didn’t allow make feel bad. 

I said “I’m sorry way don’t make rules. we’re asymptomatic? might give guys you’re high risk.”

I’d rather wear mask ventilator! Crazy made analogy thing makes anyone even slightly think. make sure southern accent!

*I declare* bankruptcy Almost like natural limit public health order compliance something. Even wokest woke getting sick shit  say vaccines? like flu vaccines? get one strain end getting flu anyway another ? Scratch liberal fascist bleeds. 56 symptomatic and/or positive-tested cases*
Who knows many negative asymptomatic also it. Seriously though, people care potentially causing someone’s death extended illness?? can’t fathom mindset. It’s even selfish...it’s also heartless. go wedding days even sister bride. people get deposits back reservations cancel whole thing?

Seems absurd courthouse wedding point spend money later kick ass honeymoon. He's like modern version guy survived Hiroshima Nagasaki bombings! doomsday headline fails omit: 86% asymptomatic Simple solution: get married county clerk/city hall; schedule big bash 1 2 year anniversary. 

Most people know destination weddings (pre-Covid) family friends person got celebrate too. Bonus: calling anything ""wedding"" adds premium costs, call ""party"" prices lower (usually). party blast lasts hours, marriage (hopefully) last lifetime. Call school report him.  mom pressuring us LOT fall wedding instead delaying next summer (which did, we’re idiots). lot think hoping things would “normal” end year. imagine wasn’t one. Mexico response place individual try take care don’t give damn.

I live San Antonio speak Spanish lots Mexican friends. responses weird. Upper class don’t give damn partying, meeting, dining traveling like nothing happening. Middle class scared trying keep high risk members isolated (my good friend parents isolated since March one adult kids keeps delivering food medicine, go back teaching, scared getting virus). Working class scared, work know several cases parents, siblings dying covid, family funerals. It’s heart breaking. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Hell find ways protest even involve in-person events. Nonetheless, there's big difference outdoor protests wedding. barely remember much, any, catholic doctrination going on.

Aside religion class mentioned. Sounds like school wasn’t horrible, I’ve heard stories one end spectrum other. But, think religion place schools taught terms historical cultural significance, feature religions. don’t want major religion sponsoring education, matter benign seems. coworker similar get married April August. likely world covid-19 vaccine end 2020? Unfortunately is. Yes, uncommon, also common go ER blood test emergency. thought sick due work incident, contacted employee health would arranged testing free. chose go ER see physician. 

I go physicians employed hospital work get services free employee. ""*I'm danger! Hyuck! Hyuck!*"" deserve criticism Yeah, parties involve mass disease death. Well, pre-covid. I'm sure epidemiologist, ICU doctor ER nurse walk bar...

Just kidding. They're f×cking stupid. wedding reckless, couldn’t even bother condensing guest list? Like could actually spend time 275 people 4 5 hour event. That’s almost triple size large wedding anyway. people like ""salaries"" properties tend come ""rent"" 1. forgot ""lMfAo""

2. HIV medicines contracted HIV?

3. Whats death rate 1980s vs now?

4. Reread second comment chain

5. one mentioned anything gay...yet keep bringing up. Magic Johnson gay? wedding outdoors limited ten guests. Lmao, someone dumb enough actually believes this? It'll suck stops making headlines. Wow 56 cases that's like basically 56 million Dude president back making fun people wearing masks..  fairness, really hard know back March/April, outdoor activities opened May. able *sit* bar bars closed. Bars never closed. Stopping epidemic eliminating virus. Epidemics measles (way contagious coronavirus) routinely halted quarantines contact tracing vaccines. Good news coronavirus? Junk science best (or worst). many people going read crap load vitamin pills home? actual medical value. Yeah say 698 UGA, 800 reported cases week 8/24-8/30 alone yikes  ? surges 2 weeks line shall known Labor pains then. ? want get married badly, courthouse wedding next year. That’s would do. like human history Along shit. 

A state governor literally said there's nothing worry coronavirus kills rich people. 

Our president said honesty corrupt protecting shield keeps coronavirus away. also flaunted good luck charms (including two religious medals, clover dollar bill immigrant gave him)saying keep Covid away.

Our health subsecretary charge coronavirus response, Lopez Gatell, justify president still holding rallies said ""the president moral force, contagion force"". best. Imagine would feel wedding early killing someone elses grandmother/parents/uncle it. would main thing remember day rest life - would suck big time. Oh think agreement lol held dads funeral, shocked find relatives invited someone’s house afterwards, sitting indoors hours, wearing masks. perfectly accommodating seating area outdoors. get - it’s hot, you’re family, you’re emotional...but, man, least wear fucking mask sit bit spaced out? really put much damper things?  Obviously politicization preventative measured played role initial safeguards behaviors.

But time goes on, people get lazy, restless, complacent regardless political orientation.

We see increasing caseloads second waves basically anywhere world happen, regardless American politics. masks come soon get indoors. virus there. Indian people strange. I'm literally one person workplace 30+ people wears maks day. 

I swear even one co-workers get infected whole office surely follow suit. Also skeleton crew working , nothing happened all. 'reinfection' cases need sequenced possible. Wonder might seeing separate strains outcompeted 'G' variant. Another words, cases might rare 'G' strain common point, still enough separate strain circulating. Theory only. evidence back up. Blame virus? What? Convenient lol Spoken like man didn’t take lot math courses liberalism Mexico test enough, numbers far accurate. +1 reads like survivor intro:

56 cases, 275 guests, 1 WEDDING! covid always worse poorer folk less access prevention cure. supposed 150 person wedding 3/21, week got shut California. canceled wedding 4 days prior ended getting married backyard gathering 8 people (My best friend married us, parents there, wife’s mother sister brother law, wife’s best friend husband took pictures us). 

We planning big wedding re-do party original venue October 2021 EARLIEST. It’s worth earlier eyes. small percentage gets sick. People think invincible. Game thrones probably absolute worst example think going talk weddings tv shows.

SOURCE: S03:E09 red wedding Stop rationalizing going parties. people’s failures don’t make choice less clear. Thanks link. idea what's death rate ranking? seems like might legend backwards, unclear NY #1.  means test picks cases *had* disease, currently infectious, well cases *have disease* currently infectious. Bridezilla Covid style.. they're missing potential revenue weekend future. make person wedding now, weekend future open another wedding. let postpone, original weekend booked all.


Not trying defend anyone, agree shitty. shedding light business sees it. Well, there's one thing agree on, China bares absolutely responsibility whatsoever outbreak. Yup yup! changing sell plans prudent normal. executives selling nearly shares good either wouldn’t either. cancel wedding then. Normal like covid? lmao extremely proud Uni everyone handling this. 4 active cases, 14 total 3 weeks person classes. Also, cases campus students, one lives campus tested positive. Everyone masks up, social distances, prior partier, haven’t heard one year far. you’re wondering, Cumberland University Tennessee. hope keep up. best handled University America, opinion. know drill, internet, either amazing talent express sarcasm writen format plain use /s, approach end people thinking serious because... know, would guess 1 10 comments around actually sarcastic. Instead “unable attend” honest you’re going. thought enough invite least tell won’t there. analysed data initial outbreak, things playing much same. Expect hospital admissions deaths increase sharply next weeks. project government unwillingness reimplement harsh necessary measures, see situation bubble control rapidly. expect reluctant return full lockdown November. wedding end month... excited around bunch strangers... it’s relatives death? still count? nurse ""friend"" posted social media almost every day everyone masked staying home. Lo behold, one day posting weekend getaway friends beach house partied weekend house bars. Lost respect one post. Practice preach.  elope, cheaper, faster, party vaccine out. Lets say math thing Meh, get away little 'overweight' struggle Active Duty trying keep PT tests. going able stay Obese though unless Guard/Reserves. 

Source: 20 years USAF. give Trump. America certainly #1. least lie. Still MUCH lower expected tbh (was expecting 90%+) Really hope don’t see red bubble school admit virus real hurt people?  Hang think spare $20, let get car real quick ill right back Decline 440, 42,740 42,300 per day last 10 days Never said disposable sure died Cov19 anything else. cousin wedding state weeks ago. husband chest surgery immunocompromised clearly decided would never go, even everyone masks. still offended decision. Like CDC? NIH? FEMA? Department health human services? bet there's more. BLM protests: outdoors, majority participants wearing masks. Sturgis: lots indoor activities (like sneezing contests!), majority people fucking stupid wear mask. guess kind shows getting married lol say sad. say horrifying. We’re correct.

I came getting takeout seeing four c. 20 year olds close knot, literally drinking other’s straws, none masked, one explosively sneezing f-all block — unapologetically breaking every public health edict, state that’s got sixth-highest death rate per pop.

I wanted mace 😣 think worry educating yourself. Start trying comprehend information article. worry 3 people line take also Product Code 300215, well.   live (Hong Kong) I've noticed people wearing masks. I'm making big generalisation look like shitty people. rough look face. Again, I'm generalising, look like uneducated ignorant people. got thinking stick people prison five years, would see massive drop crime? in, people causing shit society? suspect may be. Yes. Everywhere look people making vaccines taking long process approving concluded. Basically experts issue confident, vaccines they're working safe use provide protection virus. everyone else ─ people know jack shit ─ skeptical fearful vaccines variety reasons. Hopefully 'the one' seriously considering leaving it.

Punt cunt. Helsinki small. public holiday februari 10% entire population abroad last week February. incredible rare wait studies time (Sweden provide good data fall subject), however far seems people didn’t get short/ medium term immunity (we don’t enough time talk long term immunity). people never get immunity diseases (vaccinated infected) either that’s that. 

We don’t know yet, better cautious try avoid virus even passed already.  American, sympathize Scottish folks (minus people group, course) Moderna vaccine trial started recruiting phase 3 won’t done November 2022. contact traced back wedding? 6 family members virus, mention anything contact tracing anyone interviewing been. state state? states contact tracing, aren't? Lol bro could also take money bank accounts light 20/20. think signing divorce decree 1k hive minded people sadly do... agree, get rid CDC gaff, put trust give us correct numbers guidance, didn't. Three stories - well, I'll damned! friend went pharmaceutical school mocked entire time. hated there. choose ignore virus, point, feel bad yall. feel man! I'm immunocompromised unfortunately forced live family seem go way sabotage health.

I asked last month, actually WANT die? subconsciously hate me? quite offended promise try improve ways.

Ten minutes later though, 73 year old mum (who's high risk herself) restaurant licking fingers using pepper grinder restaurant, licking fingers again. told her, I'd done toddler she'd spanked wooden spoon. laughed though told lived long enough care gets sick, least die dementia like grandmother.

So good her, care dying happy act like spoilt toddler. ten minutes promising hate would ANYTHING me, already engaging activity could put life risk. mention anybody else uses pepper grinder.

They're family, becomes hard maintain love respect somebody respect you. It’s even selfish...it’s also heartless.

I SPENT SIX MONTHS PLANNING PERFECT DAY EVER. GRANDMA FUCK DIE. /s Oh definitely. Boundaries thing acknowledges Also scared cardiac implcations even end severe case. disease fucky. 😘😘😘 Yet Especially since quite sure phase 3 enrollment works. figure majority people leaping part trial already young relatively healthy. data good them, roll age group (especially it’s stops transmitting) parents (both high risk categories) invited out-of-state anniversary party freaking POTLUCK. 

Hard pass. Traveling large gathering already question them, eating food 20+ different people made? None kind Food Safety training? Oof. Attacking someone's mental health called ""gaslighting"". low-class people nothing value say. Australia (southern hemisphere) - flu year social isolation, including mask use Can't Zoom Wedding? Allot cheaper whole lot smarter days.. Like someone else said, families livelihood line, whether needing shifts entire business, you’d feel differently. zero issues going enjoying supporting business’s knowing there’s small percentage chance death virus, especially somewhere like Ontario 160 cases today across entire province highest month. point economy people’s livelihoods going overtake priority overly cautious nothing, point already crossed. What's new consensus herd immunity then? sliver lining India young country healthier thinner population. death rate lower US.  says many cases getting picked up. US tests lot picks lot mild cases. I’m married. Getting married changed nothing lives. loved loved after. “married” ceremony. 

You’re right rush. May suffer stupidity. That’s way imbeciles learn. may life teach them. wants US theocracy? god politicians want worship them. Also careful different scared blame lies nation people look administration nothing. going get worse begins get better. pub roommate works Oregon putting magical giant tents parking lot winter. That’ll sure stop spread, since they’re “outdoors” can't believe people believe this. obviously media manipulation makes 0 scientific sense LMAO. even English? idea trying say here. worked catering/banquets 12 years. Weddings absolute waste money. Even try go cheap route anything related weddings gets instant mark price. Save money, put towards something actually enjoy. Brides/Grooms rarely get eat anything wedding anyway dish money it? Stupid. stupid. somebody eat bat? This. worried rolling out? K. phase 2s tell us healthy young people. give young people know adverse reactions &amp; efficacious Consider instead rational right understanding currently likely-case projections 410k dead Jan 1 sitting 192k dead right now. double next 3-4 months look like? denial turn panic? 

In many respects perfect pandemic modern America. Even defer science evidence-based arguments policy fatigued. can’t be?

Hell, I’ve probably already COVID. prime life, train triathlons. go grocery store wear mask I’m surrounded exurbanite septuagenarian land cows don’t wear masks look sort pity comes “knowing real sacrifice, real patriotism looks like.” feel bad.

I’m sorry put position. truly sucks. made assumptions wrong them. hindsight size might gone fallout said aren’t going. thought sister slimmed size wedding. also thought going social distance tables people coming. Yeah, got dad said 300 RSVP’d saw tables set zero distancing chairs tables. set 100 chairs chairs outside people sat there. made sound like barn going super open, one big door open people come out. guess that’s slightly better closed reception hall. don’t get comparisons.

9/11 Pearl Harbor human attacks humans caused massive destruction terror, catalysts war.

It’s due human human violence, it’s unfortunate natural thing spread whole country instead concentrated one single location. does! law school opened. 3 story Walmart. bottom two stories parking garage. store second story. special escalator shopping carts. wedding originally Sept '20. tentatively rescheduled Sept '21 got legally married meantime. still shitty we're considering small outdoor celebration. family still need travel, casual decision.

Yes she’ll lose first freshman semester possibly second one too, she’ll get take vaccine hopefully immune goes person. That's completely different issue agree.

I stay away politics anyway. feels control, is. *that* manufactured be.

This turned political, seems like also ""human nature"" extent. majority, anyway.

This systemic clusterfuck worsened fact wacky election year. mess. horrible since '16. Fauci said 2nd, think it’ll depend state infrastructure vaccine development. LMAO can't believe got ""Essential"" worker here. never chance stay home.


In fact, responsible counting number people store work at. Hitting 100 people height quarantine uncommon. including employees, course. vulnerable people families gotta vaccinating Christmas. NYC ~230 cases day. q3, realistically US real problem binary political system 2 parties others throats media split along parties puppets. Vaccine approval year means maybe grandma grandpa get vaccine, they’re probably people family chance vaccinated Christmas, even it’s high chance makes sense. hate makes sense. Shit like shows individualism actually hinderance certain point. Many Americans seem concept caring others besides themselves. Teamwork concept appreciated applied professional sports even “me vs you” kinda thing. Free food booze. wife lucked got wedding leap day. made it. may depend state local Walgreens free flu shots.

Again RTF post:""If somebody better data source, please let know."" Went shopping. Everyone masks, little social distance. one Karen got within inches me, picking food. asked maintain social distance. response? OMG! I'm wearing mask (in total high pitched Karen voice) said still need maintain social distance. dufus husband chimed ""is problem here?"" repeated said snickered gave dumb look guess less extreme. There's course insane private schools exist. standard, normal catholic high school cost $20k $45k. I’m sorry parents screwed badly. Covid vaccine properly *proven effective safe* Covid vaccine? agree it’s probably unsafe, wasn’t point. point isn’t allowed someone actually quarantining. realize rising 22 states means falling 28. best news we’ve heard far Fauci’s prediction vaccine approval year. I’m grateful modern technology it’s much worse is. Hence, 1918. Rent expensive? That's first thing came up? Yeah needs go. Meanwhile boyfriend’s sister wedding full people without masks social distancing. That’s selfish.

Watch news break small city Ohio. guarantee it. didn’t run candidate. high order treason old parties. glad that. imagine huge numbers incompetent greedy leeches would claimed important positions expecting rewarded loyalty? Bartlett scumbag that’s sure. guy connected knows names numbers well push buttons. political standpoint it’s risk strategic one, it’s better known heavyweight side working rather you. Obrador dumb yes, appointments prerogative presidents. doubt country would life death crisis today degenerate Madrazo won. Cheer up. hope yet. Don’t waste time complaining ideal candidate. That’s pipe dream. UK here, seeing lot news daily death rate low compared daily number new cases - people spoken seem take lot comfort think wave 2 wont bad. main reason given ratio young:old people diagnosed high. However, possible first wave, initially high young:old ratio large number cases vs deaths start time went age ratio changed death ratio increased? Maybe, symptoms bad young people testing much Jan/Feb/March missed high number cases:deaths young:old ratio first wave. someone prove case? age case:death ratios wont change progress wave 2? I'm def expert take questions seriously, seems wrong take comfort low death:case ratio currently see know ratios stable. Feel free school I've missed something obvious! US, least watch us burn distance now. Pray people make mistakes.
It's almost like design, think necessarily was. complexity things muddles enough already. US big good.



We individuals can. hope vaccines stuff, I'm still people we've already lost ""Why fatalities down"" 

""Because deadly virus"" 

Lmao, like else there? treated easily deadly. 

If kill every population masses rate deadly.  really important point, getting lot ~deniers~ arseholes arguing increase purely tests carried out.

Yes, true probably discovering higher %age actual infected increased testing capacity, so:

* # infected cases per day higher peak
* come cases fell Apr-Aug despite testing capacity increasing? Can't ways m8
* Infections testing increasing, infections increasing *because* testing.

People infections they're infected, we're testing more. Surprise surprise increasingly younger (u40s) getting now, they're about. they're younger they're hospitalised much, even treatment improved fewer dying. add this: great way assessing risk Well. high risk also lock flu season? likely he's high risk aswell. I'm saying worse flu, exaggerated. much depends state. get home test delivered free get results 24 hours. know tell you. robust medical system place, young population, healthiest population country regular physicals, fitness standards, zero drug use, etc.

Not sure really understand closely stuff controlled compared civilian world. Someone gets put shape, fat, sick kicked military. cannot kick civilians society reasons.

It always wierd going back real world mostly exposed military. two months boot camp takes bit get used fat people walking around public like normal. 8-12 months deployment physically repulsive see unhealthy general population is.

There group size going find people healthy closely monitored. Lots lots infected, sure. probably ton deaths. you...not think quarantines work? It’s probably good Oh poor baby. Want see mommy brought bottle? asshole frantically popping blue vaccine bubbles mind DM this? Wow, wild. live *completely* different. Back June almost everyone know WFH, includes people work healthcare settings (not directly patients, research project-oriented roles). know still went work either lab environment working directly COVID patients, to. 

That changed *bit* now, even think probably 90% people know still WFH. lot people know already told WFH next summer, even 2021. Totally different world guess. Seattle never gets national attention anything lol. Last time got tested results 14 hours crazy. thread tagged ""Good News"" ? Oh naive. Wanna ""intellectuals"" quote times. Rhodes Scholars quote economist, Atlantic monthly, Brookings etc. they're still uncertain us state school kids comes COVID. Kudos Senegal, teach many countries! Noted! Hope strategy, we’re situation Americans put almost chips hope chips actually something get control Giving vaccine ""small risk negative effects"" group people risks could severe seem logical. would make effects seem worse could compromised people. Selecting already weak group, would feel negative effects profoundly, potentially making effects fatal compromised group would also probably cause panic vaccine everyone noncompromised group, leading fewer people taking turn comes around.

I dunno. Maybe I'm way wrong, tho. I'm high-risk group. I'll go physician recommends. Ya , must missed part cdc announced 96% basically died another condition covid + 1.4 billion people. Yeah going top vaccine released. cousin Zoom wedding. total dumbass want get done, this. stupid gathers herds...and Darwin lying wait. I’m best man brothers wedding, scheduled October. I’m terrified. really don’t want go. it’s like it’s unstoppable train. can’t say I’m best man. choose relationship brother, family safe. hate this. necessary. Many people voted Trump calculated choice compared Hillary. hate minorities, immigrants, hate poor people, want tax breaks rich on. might sociopathic spectrum stupid dont fever, yeah ill prob take allergy meds rn Sounds like need another break reevaluate your/her priorities.  Yeah pretty much sums view foreigner visited US. sad considering US world leader unfortunately trendsetter. managing city town entire country do. impressed. would love see kind sanity US. wasnt guy responded to.

I know different person. realized immediately posted edited it. doesn’t edit asterisk.

Regardless. claim questioned mask slows exhaled particles; stop altogether.

And respond evidence doesn’t show masks delay virus particles stop going through, wonder reading comprehension.

One sources studied flu coronavirus flu. 

The first study says mechanistic studies show work contradicts second source claims mechanistic reasons doubt mask efficacy.


So, two sources aren’t particularly germane contradict other.

Maybe google more. might get lucky time.

Edited essay Dr Monica Gandhi UCF Professor Medicine Infectious Diseases.

Things aren’t proven true fundamental sense science. lots evidence masks work.

Read article sources multiple scientific papers.

Its quite bit couldn’t hurt. I'm familiar Ohio State's financial situation, telling institute higher learning finds less costly rent hotel rooms hundreds ill students go fully online. People don’t care anymore. LOL! Stupid stupid America!. Who's next republican state 200,000+ motorcycle rally? except we're FREEDOMER  it. also severe drop flu, RSV people would died summer died earlier. Sweden less dead average last two months. India badly hit. Modi went complete lockdown March, pretty sure wouldnt expected 90k daily cases rising graph September. first US confirmed case like Feb 27th seems unlikely that's had. asked friend across country Florida getting arms everything Facebook. Towards end conversation realized little silo friends going deterred arguments, finally asked, since UPSET economy opened, ""would willing wear mask 4 months could guarantee could reopen fully?""

... get response eloped courthouse different city. invited two couples. Best weekend ever. 

Then threw big family party. Big waste money. We’ll find out. Gosh, fuck hope, guess... B E That’s 11 years ago, wasn’t virus antisocial. know 120 candidates pipeline, handful already phase III trials (at least one began phase III July). Several major drug companies believe data necessary file approval October. US readying vaccine deliver November 1st. China already giving vaccine military, Russia bypassing phase III begin delivery vaccine instantly.

Now, probably wishful thinking motivated election, doubt. indications point, data positive suggests first vaccines end year.

So sure sun rise tomorrow? No. also seems reckless plan wedding year every indication nearly concern next summer. you’re going Christmas year, it’s absolutely ridiculous you’re US expect atrocious situation somehow get resolved 3 half months Yeah fine dandy April, September people still asking individuals shoulder majority restrictions.

And furthermore...urging people stay home holidays failed us twice far...Memorial Day 4th July (maybe three times, Easter?). Maybe it’s time adopt alternative strategy? He's talking kinda specifically UK, though, US' situation different: higher percentage people immunity already, already order hundreds millions vaccines. Well, fair, time Covid, wouldn’t allowed job wouldn’t then, either everyone done right thing start, still persist getting ridiculously worse. would able live closer normalcy. Instead, people made argument start, end sight.

So, yes, much population refuse take even basic precautions, plagued misinformation including President, re-open everything including schools, course certain covid keep spreading. flu 10 years ago bring world near complete stop force placed close, events canceled, everyone wear masks keep social distance. pretty different sense. Seattle Zero cost months whether insurance whether legal not. positivity rate 2%! wish Seattle would make news right!! results come back 36 hours. American, couldn’t agree more. people vulnerable already died? get health care workers legitimate cause concern. using nasal swab long maintain social distancing dangerous. could poke someone's eye thing he's careful! goes way anticipate, lot families going lose members couldn’t skip Christmas 1 year Saying bud also sign dbag asshole /r/CoronaVirusTX subreddit seems skeptical well Texas' pretty rapid decline steady deaths. 

Schools open week areas in-person already (here DFW) Labor Day Monday means end September truly know.  heard Morman schools also pretty intense. amount money save insane. take small chunk awesome weekend two you. This. like people say stupid shit post true feelings. Makes easy cancel life. time foolishness around here."
