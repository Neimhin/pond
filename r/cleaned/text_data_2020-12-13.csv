Is anyone else available answer? Regular people getting vaccine half year either. Unless healthcare old person home

Also dont guys 0 cases restrictions? waiting another 6 months matter get live life mostly normal? Lol. Oh interesting! love site didn‚Äôt read that. making assumption j&amp;js much easier production would flood country supply. app released for-profit company used collect data you. I'm installing app something like unless 100% open source way track share data. need vaccination record cards. zero need app beyond collecting people's personal/medical data. work wants know I'm vaccinated take doctor directly. Read usernames. said conspiracy morons, i.e one refusing vaccine. say blacks refusing though, he? literally mean virus hoax? extrapolating that? feel like white house herd immunity point What???? Considering lower deaths per capita Western countries, despite shit healthcare system massive population density, excellent comparison. Maybe, maybe, near 100% mask compliance helps. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I'm one responded to. going attack another's intelligence, correctly.   Oh guess we‚Äôre imagining shut downs hospital surges? cannot even begin guess logic you‚Äôre trying convey. thought Microsoft deprecated Restore Points... never NH state different portrayed it. lot rough neighborhoods lot Massachusetts citizens visit NH. cousin cop Hudson Nashua 25 years block away main strip made lock car doors wonder on. states population lives towns rest sparsely populated. want visit state tell everyone else really happening there. nonexistent average age dying covid covid literally higher death itself. It‚Äôs extremely concentrated higher ages.

The vast majority older population imply ‚Äúno one‚Äù younger age cohorts ever dies covid. data shown this. might argue deaths decrease older population vaccinated (and course everyone high risk take vaccine offered them) reasonable, say deaths nonexistent leap logic supported data. 

Are willing go bar mask vaccine April, May, June? comparing random people Trmp dude. means know I‚Äôm alone thinking you‚Äôd convince way people want notion wrong common.

This word salad. people agreeing mean you‚Äôre correct. end. warp speed head literally said normal May. It‚Äôs wishful thinking, it‚Äôs words. Fauci thinks could hit ‚Äúrelative normal‚Äù April July


First, said US back normal summer. you‚Äôre quoting someone saying ‚Äúrelatively normal.‚Äù one it? That‚Äôs US works. long you‚Äôve got 50 different governors calling shots state you‚Äôll never real national lock down. even halfway. Great news!  Better pessimism- read comment, thought ""...it would really suck one people cheering trucks, caused get COVID."" Older you, pre CoronaVirus era, legit account genuine interests, unlike salve accounts Deployed China, commenting Corona virus, spread propaganda, vote anyone talks truth China.You carry garbage. dont think so. believe essential would medicine, food prep, first responder, pubic transit provider. do? think conversation many times people live around me?

There's old saying, ""you lead horse water can't make drink"". also don‚Äôt require motorcyclists wear helmets. Drive Ma/NH border given summer weekend day, there‚Äôs bikers side highway signs, stripping helmets continuing. really strange. I'm glad Melbourne okay days. 

You never quite understand happens virus let loose place like NYC population density almost 10 times city double amount tourists. we've endure something want lived through. spread throughout entire northeast US probably outpaced factor 100.

Melbourne well hand dealt, please even try pretend ""did right thing."" disingenuous. Yeah, I'm US seems like saying fair get $1200 stimulus check make much money. 100 percent body, choice concerns certainly valid. said, really you. cannot receive vaccine vaccine induce immune response. dont stop pandemic without 60-80% immunity. Otherwise, slow bleed 1.1 R0 quite awhile. 15% number slowing, stopping. There‚Äôs reason many blacks don‚Äôt trust medical community. They‚Äôve experimented since slavery. one key developer builds trust. particular point, might interested, check history interstate highway system wikipedia. kinda fascinating... rich powerful, yes virus can‚Äôt attack /s   I'm San Francisco (but moved Chicago mid June), pretty tough restrictions throughout pandemic: outdoor dining opened around mid June, barbershops opened late July, indoor dining limited capacity movie theaters open couple weeks shut everything again. Chicago, indoor dining movie theaters open limited capacity mid June. summer, case counts fatality rates still pretty similar two cities.

Hindsight 20/20, feel Bay Area could loosened restrictions bit summer, could given people temporary reprieve. area back lockdown, people ignoring ""Covid fatigue"". LMAO. compared directly adjacent neighbors = ""cherry picked""? Thanks good laugh, buddy. Well, I'm sure still review data, really make sure safe effective. I'm dumb schmo giving opinion reddit. doctor/scientist, I'd bit looking ingredients saying, ok, good go. statement greatly oversimplified laymen's terms. joke since deleted comment antivaxer condescendingly claimed people can‚Äôt understand nuance. Again, provide money, that's problem here. provided barely anything distribution vaccine America. European companies funded vaccine. odd quickly changing BioNTech Pfizer vaccine. Viral spread lower summer virus going away completely summer two different situations. latter happen, countries experience heavy surges summer, certainly nothing like what's happening now. first two, know good idea anyone private stash whale semen. Key word world would also wrong. strong enough correlation prove **any** causal connection vaccine condition. COVID developments already happened washington think be. I'm American, easy forget like sometimes. didnt address points. also people use old ""correcting poeples spelling make sound dumb"" trick thing people know wrong instead admitting choose dick Oh, come on. can't much moron.

If understand case-fatality ratio means, read site. site two sets numbers: "" number deaths either per 100 confirmed cases (observed case-fatality ratio) per 100,000 population (this represents country‚Äôs general population, confirmed cases healthy people). ""

&amp;#x200B;

Sweden's case-fatality ratio 2.3%

The US's 1.9%

&amp;#x200B;

For every 100 people tested positive Sweden 2.3 people died. every 100 US, 1.9 people died. basic elementary math. That's asymptomatic infection data. nothing secondary transmission. ""Misplaced freedom complex"".  Well said. simple, take FDA 3 weeks ensure safe? wasn‚Äôt worried before, would worried now? forget ones black community calling token using logic using prop tear down. Suggesting used push vaccine communities like new kinda narcotic CIA needed offload... everyone acting like bag assholes right now. team on, dozens teams article mention done something monumental. one history books sure. Haha, governments barely learning mistakes within current pandemic, let alone new one.  looked....and say oh jeez. reserve making comments this, then. üòÖ Pretty sure Trump said virus literally hoax, no? Exactly. since there‚Äôs evidence it‚Äôs safe doctors recommending that‚Äôs that. Right. Sweden‚Äôs approach proven stupid? Loool  countries including Denmark different stages closed borders Sweden. Yeah. got put facebook jail day one groups. Someone posted article ny health department warning ""rim jobs"" risk spreading covid. said, yeah, people worried getting vaccine raw dog, go chick met bar 2 hours earlier questions asked. moderator think comment appropriate. Lol. Maybe, true statement non less. I've idea tbf, citing article little context.

Netflix barely hand process making number Netflix Original titles understand it; comes money contracts rights. direct analogy, another example name packaging tell whole BioNTech developer vaccine, Pfizer provides logistics, finances oversees clinical trials, manufacturing partner BNT162b2 worldwide, exception China license distribute manufacture purchased Fosun.

So sounds like classic case follow money; Pfizer get main credit provided finances, Everyone‚Äôs one dose recipient day 21. Days 10-20 show much lower covid-19 infection rates vaccine group compared placebo group.  Read article, maybe? None deaths attributed vaccine placebo. 

The placebo saline. 

In random group 44000 months would expect deaths. don‚Äôt personally know sure happens yes. nothing 5 local cases 19 imported cases. interesting 2 local cases found Hainan. lunch someone Xian, arriving Hainan. Two tourists visiting Sanya Hainan, China‚Äôs southernmost island province, found close contact asymptomatic case Xian northwest China, lunch person Wednesday.

The distance Hainan Xian something like 1500 miles. goes show dangerous long distance travel middle pandemic. pandemic really gonna spring?

No be. good start ending number people dying go way down. still spreading community gotten vaccine. would guess August effectively over. Right, one's actually praising US response. answer question say Sweden going back rankings they've stable are?

Based current numbers would 7 weeks Sweden overtook Colombia, Sweden's hospitalisations plateaued likely death rate start drop. Meanwhile Switzerland, Romania Hungary likely overtake Sweden within weeks Many countries within EU Schengen area closed borders countries within Schengen area various times pandemic. something really funny two people arguing one live pathetic location. Can't help wonder either pride aspects life lol fan current administration. telling husband day, one single thing gotten right last 4 years getting defense logistics agency defense medical distribution components involved. That's guys do.

They talking briefing yesterday plans Pfizer vaccine distribution followed moderna vaccine distribution. real fly ointment according I've read, US pre-ordered 100 million doses Pfizer vaccine another hundred million moderna vaccine, next one likely get across line. put eggs AstraZeneca basket, ordering 500 million doses that. Given ongoing questions clinical trial methodologies errors clinical trials, I'm sure AstraZeneca going get across line. Given Pfizer modern vaccines require two administrations, looking slightly less 1/3 population able inoculated amount ordered two manufacturers. never understand overorder equal amounts three likely get across line soonest. Smh. takes extra time code COVID-19 deaths. 80% deaths electronically processed coded NCHS within minutes, deaths COVID-19 must coded person, takes average 7 days."" reason two parents need work support family workers horribly exploited. got pitch differently. *""For 2020 we're giving excuse avoid hours travel, sleeping strange beds, arguing relatives even like, stressing children acting front parents.""* 

*""This year, celebrate Christmas Holidays pajamas cup hot coffee comfortable house stress whatsoever.""* You‚Äôre welcome. plenty countries didn't. I've seen many headlines insist vaccine invented Germany. working company overseas? Genuinely confused/unsure. Thanks. decent head start via natural Lol main forums post coronavirus politics. Ding ding ding got winnah! South Korean woman first SK outbreak highly symptomatic. People still gigantic family get togethers holidays. can't say ""see, masks reduce spread 2% ! know wear mask walmart!"" Piggy backing this, friend nurse basically says get text email offering ‚Äú$6k taxes pay‚Äù come work xyz hospital rural area. says saddest part offers also say ‚Äú... also plenty PPE!‚Äù. goes show terrible condition hospitals in. really. lot EU countries closed borders around April real issues, still part country's power so. clearly pushing public message implied pandemic blown massively proportion, political purposes, something actually concern. conclusion drawn statements made. Whether actually believed not, chose present way. 

You couple comments Trump made tested positive, MASSIVELY disregarded virus threat. again, convince anyone.

Saying ""it's safe"" evidence saying ""it's safe"" evidence.

And comparison sucks, 0% chance monster attic. non-0% chance vaccine harmful. One possible, isn't.  I'm aware facts, sometimes choice take risk. like sit pandemic festering molar need root canal.

I laid trip going Nova Scotia rock couple days almost 3 weeks. traveling \~6 hours day taking couple days see family scattered around. That's institutions weakened enough private, extremely wealthy people/corporations government longer run attempt good balanced citizenry.

So let's change that. rob truck, tbh. would silver bullet would end pandemic. Even 60% fine - big thing look % severe cases. drops big time, done collective want mess people charge liquor licenses cities. 

""That's nice family got there, hate see anything happen them"" heard testing appointments scarce, results taking 2 3 days get back Northeast Ohio. . Pretty clear reached testing capacity. point. OP suggesting mask mandate proves effectiveness masks. Yeah that‚Äôs kinda point. Geographically small, populated, part state needed be, been, acting like Mass COVID despite NH seeming strict whole state. Fucking gross none gave two shits first place. 

Business usual. oh hey look never ever ever use ""healthcare""

It could $20, could $700, could billed today, could billed 10 months later, knows? system broken understand anyone defend would open speakeasy quickly. would prohibition again. 

We drill almighty power capitalism populace, set society earning money required survival. Yet act surprised people ignore pleas stop type thinking compensated. authors really use 94 year old woman Alzheimer‚Äôs reference point. People without mask mandate though.  top 3? example, 46k-51k US soldiers perished Battle Gettysburg. 3 day event matter slice it, Americans died either one days.

Also around 675k Americans died Spanish Flu several days second wave Americans died list. That's benefit hindsight. response good reasonable judge information simply known certain time. February, late January, virus likely already spreading UK. actually concerned trucks run Y'all Qaeda blockades checkpoints. I‚Äôm going recomment exact words don‚Äôt want signal boost misinformation, explicitly said above. He's probably parroting information NYT article. see good reason governor throw though--seems like case press conference riffing based something kinda-sorta remember days ago. lot concern people showing second dose, could imagine trying impress small number people know well enough realize get together enough show twice one dose better nothing, even intent ideal vessel time. I‚Äôm scared shitless I‚Äôm going lie. live TN, seen half department drop last week Covid, watched FIL get put vent last month Covid, watched former coworker get put vent 24 healthy Covid little sister working nursing student clinical rotation Covid floor due staffing shortages. Last month called volunteers medical experience, month called National Guard hospitals. 

Now Mississippi maxed ICU capacity Alabama isn‚Äôt far behind. Guess send patients? TN hospitals already hovering around 90% ICU capacity. also Kentucky patients sent least Nashville. get uptick patients states leave capacity people? 

Why Governor Lee anti mask beyond me. understand degree anti lockdown order happen need wear masks needs mandatory enforced. Use money fines collected wearing masks bail small businesses across state, use fund additional relief people suffering utility cutoff emergency fund rent relief. Damn, I‚Äôm Republican even see need support people get people wearing masks quiet good regards covid news, though? No, widely touted perk head getting results several countries showing Nordic neighbors, maybe 1 2 percent population immune, estimate Sweden around 25 percent. course, much epidemic, much closer level immunity population. would help us clearly keep low number cases every day open society,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIf translates death tolls exactly remains also know eventually would get help immunity population keep level spread down. long term, level immunity population keep spread reasonable level vaccine, going quite far off.‚Äù

It never policy, certainly one factors say helps justify approach. fuck literally tossing elderly healthcare workers virus.   Good one!! Here's [Chinese media depth conversations ventilation, Feb 10th](http://www.xinhuanet.com/tech/2020-02/10/c_1125552102.htm). right, overtime still considered standard. doubt overtime pay specific trucks would normal overtime pay. Sure!

Excipient - chemical present final vaccine; actually get injected patient. 

Non-excipient - chemical used make vaccine, used prior filtration steps present final container. 

The new excipients never seen vaccine mRNA (these ‚Äúblueprints‚Äù proteins cells use make enzymes, cellular proteins, hormones, etc.), two lipid particles (they resemble ‚Äúfat bubbles‚Äù - they‚Äôre used carry mRNA cells blueprints make Spike protein). 

Does help? USA, confirm things normal Jar Jar Brinker, annoying deliver driver galaxy So, back normal. Got it. Thank clarification.  Auto immune issues probably biggest concern judging issues previous mRNA treatments, especially susceptible them. that's silly question first place. Plenty medications turn cause unexpected issues immediately linked mechanism action. would never line try newest medications market. knew newer diabetes meds could increase risk limb amputations necrotizing fasciitis first came out? uterine fibroid medication could result liver failure requiring transplant (and recalled passing rigorous clinical trials)? Ah okay, maybe like incomplete version COVID, essential part unique COVID. body fights lame partial version resulting proteins/antibodies also work defense real COVID. Interesting. suppose, like vaccine, trust work according design say vial, reason doubt it. :) live whole life like that, get vaccines, take medication, use store-bought products, etc. 

Sadly many people know would commit logical fallacy stopped trusting experts, never get it. :/

I'm South American country, whenever someone gets position popularity renown kind they're almost idolized wrong reasons. I'm tired ""look us, we're best world *insert whichever person* example that"". I'm happy people genuinely inspired things, crosses territory masturbatory nationalism, disgusting me. feels like look good ignore bad. know, maybe I'm cynical bastard, feel like representation card something play much. like said, I'm happy woman, I'm happy could potentially serve inspiration partly relief sectors black community distrustful, feel like true equality achieved stuff stops mattering. matter now, eventually matter less less. curious bottlenecks beyond distribution. Let's say actually ship many quickly. Let's assume immediately administered.

Has info released quickly usa get vials injected? supply issue, many could injected daily? bottleneck? need enough nurses focused months end - spoilage, watch side effects, etc.

Otherwise, could quickly situation vaccines shipped weekly administered. Hopefully scare racists refusing vaccine. Amazing job! hope inspires army next gen African scientists female scientists! today NH group anti-maskers protested outside Gov Sununu‚Äôs personal residence. biggest reason numbers going NH largely hopefully loud minority anti-maskers - Sununu‚Äôs policies. like Facebook posts comments toxic, they‚Äôre extremely bad local news pages. battling stupidity.

[Protesters mean, people supposed feel bad him? Sounds like couldn‚Äôt afford second property. Shoulda kept day job. either saying shit say intentionally trying make sure people die. wondering race gender involved. Thanks! Oh yeah wrong idiot? get everything could before, mask. That's back normal. There‚Äôs way...phase 3 results still haven‚Äôt come in. phase 3 takes weeks approve looking phizer process 52% efficacy something brag though. Vaccines much flu endemic.

Thanks sharing back time. hope family well stays well. read sounded like essential workers would get at-risk population, hopefully teacher would considered essential maybe moves line. 

Wishing best mom. work labcorp PCR department running covid tests. According government healthcare workers won‚Äôt getting vaccine soon. people agree you, ones unfortunately vocal though. really hope one actually thought wouldn‚Äôt be. lol amazing theyre able people dumb. thousand cases suspected reinfection worldwide

There lot thousand suspected reinfections. states reported number probable reinfections. states unique reinfections happening them. Every state going similar numbers. amount memory would likely prevent vast majority people getting hospitalized disease, severe disease, many years,

His data show that, though. shows waning immunity 6 months drop memory B cells. matched sample data really telling. 4 days? Nobody's died spider bite decades IIRC. Shark attacks rare that's risk accept swimming ocean IMO. This, honestly going choose wrong things, deaths choice point, people can't get health reasons widely available everyone wait becomes available unfortunately pay price too. pro Sweden people would viciously attack anyone questioned strategy earlier year 

Deleted accounts mostly, Sweden narrative manufactured forced early reopening. lol ""past pandemics"" surpassed all, shit happens street live. death rate way higher 0.5%. like 1.5 2. comparatively easier production, storage, transport, lower cost means probably large impact throughout world. live US, another first world country likely depend Oxford vaccine, think silly remember Oxford vaccine massive impact things like international travel overall ""return normalcy"". Fucking Florida.... stuff 2hrs away get resourceful. 

I live 9 miles dirt road neighbors love saying ‚Äú$20 20 mins, throw away‚Äù meaning you‚Äôve got pile shit you‚Äôre iffy workshop get replacement $20 20 mins times get rid it. can‚Äôt, keep it. 

When you‚Äôre far out, everything costs least $20/20 gas effort. 

Keep stuff, maybe repurpose later. Absolutely. 

And countries shown, things ""back normal"" right even 3k people dying every day country complete lack government interest right thing. NH nothing get away lucky MA, QC, ME, VT neighbors. 

If NH surrounded MS, LA, ND, SD, would enact strict controls end like ND. mistake then, although still that‚Äôs small number everyone sub claims reinfected correct Sunday less. 

If backlog week gonna bananas Ten. So, apparently grandparents-in-law lost marbles want host Christmas ""for kids"".

Yeah man! got OP lockdown. Always thought corny, tried watching episode later arc couldn‚Äôt get it. Started watch October luckily extra time. started episode one East Blue, middle Thriller Bark now. Lol. Fun times! 

The whole Drum Island Whopple saga reminds what‚Äôs going health care US. mean, OP relevant anime get. Overall class race theme Arlong Park Arc. Dragon who‚Äôs leader Revolution Army. 

OP surface looks like funny/slice life/shonen anime damn, shit laughing, crying getting hyped one episode. Lol. 

Yeah man, bad! go OP Coronavirus thread it‚Äôs pretty damn relevant. Lol! üôå let people non-pandemic times though. measures, Australia nation immigrants US is. literally tweeted would fire wasn‚Äôt approved end day. actually happened. Don‚Äôt remember? matter? It‚Äôs within statistical range. like 0 control arm doesn‚Äôt mean saline reduces chance Bell‚Äôs Palsy electorate picking people stupid are. Look halfway true halfway not. I'm sure every AA person opinion this. I'll know one read follow report says false positive. I've never understood the"", Africa American person"" reference, like disability overcame, needed pointing out. They're person. something awesome someone speaking publicly others first thing said was, know, he's Mexican American, would confused irritated. WFH forever. mind office environment fuck commute. vaccine wasn‚Äôt developed US government, developed diverse group scientists. I'm neighbor south. assumed mask wearing common actually open anti-maskers office?

Down definitely people mass gatherings private, considering law pretty much everywhere now, part everyone plays along public. No. help black people trust vaccine more. least me. One black person make legitimate decision whole race. even make black people trust vaccine guarantee safe. need cautious reasonable also need representation people color forefront developing vaccine . IMO high risk people races get first rest population..but that's IMO. Everyone entitled own. There's fines, there's actual punishments. expect point? Scientists said ""kids seem suffer catch virus"" politicians heard ""kids get/spread virus"". parent suffered first weeks school year knows kids little disease factories spread disgusting bodily fluids everywhere. No, leading vaccine expert said would May.  went 1,100 people 1 week. Yeah remember late spring reading wealthy going yet another advantage would able afford parent staying home school age children. virus different disease. virus necessary sufficient disease progression. Similar HIV AIDS Ebola wrecks primates bats don‚Äôt mind all. Except ‚Äòprime‚Äô part Pfizer‚Äôs prime boost vaccine 75%, it‚Äôs 52%. understand pandemic sucks wearing masks sucks, least take things we've learnt year carry forward future right? wear masks time pandemic ends, one crazy people saying that, least wear sick, harm right? hoax guy feel brought someone died it?

I really know live that. I'm gonna guess person give shit believe died it. Yes! Yes! waiting this. Ok ""children almost, would almost say definitely, almost immune disease."" - Donald Trump August 5, 2020

Yeah nuanced discussion trade offs public policy described. EDC right ""dumb"" better description this. 

In school board meetings area many, many people argued children can't get covid. worse I‚Äôve seen hospital systems across L.A. beds filling COVID,‚Äù said Dr. Haig Aintablian, senior emergency medicine resident UCLA. ‚ÄúOur hospitals almost critical point, moment, hospitals could lose beds.‚Äù Man, needs step game rt.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

As Mike Barnacle WCVB Boston said, ""New Hampshire Arkansas snow"". Haha gaslighting? Nice projecting. 

The statement potential herd immunity estimation, strategy goal strategy. 

Still isn't, never was. actually lived Nashua two years. I'm well aware state like. I've also lived cities towns Austin Tampa way Nashua. Overall New Hamspshire pretty tame, quiet, there's lot people. points stand. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm seeing mine February.

I may wrong, I‚Äôm trying influence anyone‚Äôs decision vaccinated. Auto antibodies rattling around back mind since learned front runner mRNA vaccines work. sorry hear that. July? That‚Äôs pretty optimistic. mean ""new normal"" idiots? Well someone isn‚Äôt high priority, I‚Äôm right you. one dose X% effective based two weeks people given second dose, reality know effective one dose long term, many may exposed two weeks, ones catch covid two weeks get sick still would able pass on, may amount throwing away frankly vaccine widespread, fuckers test reality want reason take vaccine thought already supposed around anyone. what's statistic far roughly? Nobody knows. Yes. anyone customer-facing role, makes sense save money. end day, corporations try cut expenses anyway. That‚Äôs true.... Tegnell alluded herd immunity public directly emails health officials.

For autumn second wave. Sweden high level immunity number cases probably quite low,‚Äù Mr Tegnell told Financial Times. ‚ÄúBut Finland low level immunity. Finland go complete lockdown again?‚Äù

""High level immunity"" prevents Sweden large second wave. wonder word that.


Tegnell lied, grandma died. Never forget. Yeah can‚Äôt wait around family again. US even bother it? ones better. offered Oxford one would say wait get Pfizer moderna one Took fucking long enough idk. Ben Carson give shit black community.  Still propagating BS?! Dan Feltes (Democratic candidate) didn‚Äôt support income tax. focused heavily Sununu‚Äôs reluctance condemn Donald Trunp. disappointingly vapid candidate. lack substance, combined fact first wave largely suppressed N.H.

If Volinsky primary NH we‚Äôd seen competent debate. Volinsky may - supported conversation tax policy N.H. really needs have. But, would closer race. 

Would Covid gotten bad likely get N.H. different governor? I‚Äôm sure. states strict rules good governance suffering badly, citizens fully engaged mitigation strategies. many weak links. agree. Saves gas, traffic, food costs time. 

Companies save money cutting rental costs big buildings instead pay smaller administrative buildings work office.

Its win-win. sounds like contact positive case. that's case standard practice. Exactly. little bit hope mankind still sense empathy. I'm sorry, need hold guy accountable. went out, got sick, died.

You're joking. People turn absolutely apeshit antivaxxers comes kids reason.

SARS-CoV-2 perfectly safe kids, vaccine almost certainly safer risk MIS-C. should. see August?

They initially said they'd **results** October, miss much. get approved day wrap trials unblind data. Speaking Paramedic, pregnant.. I'm getting pregnant.. Even ""pretty sure"" safe. Even vaccine people still wearing masks proof vaccinated can't spread it.

no shit. points people recently hold unless special circumstances I'm high risk living working Porter County. longer go without (thankfully) lost someone love covid, scared get going me. logic it, superstition fact work high school kids can't seem keep mask on.

i've also never one complain FIPs, delivering pizzas, swear that's see driving friday saturday night. course, restaurants packed. i'm simultaneously glad server coworkers making money disgusted parking lot fucking full. Yeah, definitely Covid season moment... interesting. live Newburgh part everyone around east Evansville wearing mask.  Go Washington Dubois county mask sight. Like another commenter said, get met weird looks wearing mask there. Oh man wait get in, gets better story deep. meet character think impact boom 100 episodes later show up. 

I saw one time kid awful 4kids version saw fight cap curo thought looked awesome. Decided watch later adult got hooked. really like art style earlier episodes nostolgia feel even though scares people away, charm. Plus fights really cool beginning dbz powered up.

I love whole pirates free kind thing want stepping see fucked shit care about. whole anime exactly said funny one moment deep etc. 

OP fits sub haha. assuming companies like creating problems themselves. Hiring expensive time consuming, they'd likely consider flexibility another resource. new president working it:

Joe Biden told group mostly Asian Hispanic voters Wednesday ‚Äúpoor kids bright‚Äù white children. u retarded bro? Why's that? Neat. mean WSJ may business focused, still real newspaper 37 Pulitzer Prizes. 

But fair enough, opinion piece neuroscientist, infectious disease doctor. acknowledge things different there, I'm Northern Europe forced mentioning skin colour feels absurd fact companies didn‚Äôt collaborate disturbing. Instead thinking greater good they‚Äôve left chance one vaccine might effective others.  Yeah individual level important human behavior simply compatible fighting global warming pandemic. 

For kinds problems relatively small number people ruin efforts large majority enjoying benefits others suffer.

We need good leadership rules, without solutions. think it'll get point threat like white nationalism, given white people America, Nation Islam already exists, one example. Look recent comments Nick Cannon, many black public figures backed him. That's rationalizing extremely dangerous ideas. terms gender, issues pop time. I'm trouble pinning specific example, cancel culture propelled large part due types issues.
And clarify, think representation necessarilly makes people certain race start think they're superior. Ignorance racism that, ways combat it. might completely mistaken, UK significant black population well, yet nowhere near amount racial tension US has. K, take it. one forces them. get sick, enjoy. don‚Äôt really understand years vs months worry. isn‚Äôt strong evidence side effects randomly happen months years later rest time shortened many documented reasons. One insanely widespread virus makes phase 3 move extremely quickly, esp placebo. Like understand emotional level there‚Äôs huge reason worried IMO Prisoners absolutely among highest priority. unwillingly stuck congregate living facility unavoidably poor hygiene ventilation, bunch comorbidities, generally poor healthcare, ability isolate sick. Prison outbreaks also typically lead outbreaks nearby community.

Whatever jail/prison supposed be, drowning alone mucus never part bargain, constitutes cruel unusual punishment conceivable definition. way allowed Covid rip prisons dark stain society. interesting UK opposite. days I've christmas restrictions easing here! even so, staying home Christmas inviting anyone over. meet friends family outdoors though.

Its difficult guess case numbers vary UK Germany January! I'm assuming joking. AA means African American. CDC says article updated Sept 10 (I idea later).

Overall IFR course dependent population age distribution, level healthcare, etc.

In way sad still official consensus IFR. course easy undetected cases hard count.

In Hungary official sampling program (H-UNCOVER) largest university (Semmelweis) try uncover cases reported, antibody tests.

Based 15-20 thousand people sampled, estimate 2 million people past virus population), IFR 6900/2000000 0.35% overall. Overall population 9.8 million.

Bear mind Hungary disproportionate amount pensioners old people, people really healthy hospital care levels anything would think compared USA.

In way, think miracle small amount people die here.

Link (Hungarian language, use google translate Yes community historically Guinea pigs medical community lied sure stupid amirite? Ignoring comment completely understandable hesitant vaccine general. need black community leaders trusted help ease worry community offensive call Turkish immigrant Turk? According youre source US 13th deaths per capita. Sweden 25th death per capita world.

So no, Sweden doesnt worse death rate US.

And exactly reason dangerous keep insisting Sweden didnt anything stop pandemic. point dangerous saying vaccine doesnt work. Funny despite statistic still wind scenarios [like It‚Äôs black white. common sense science I've long-time subscriber /r/collapse. Basically started noticing number threads new disease Wuhan around Jan 19-26. post announcing creation ""China Flu"" subreddit Jan 21. time, figured would like SARS, would local issue little while, would get control fairly quickly, would end it.

A days later, Jan 30 so, heard bunch Americans flown California quarantined military base, thought absolutely idiotic thing time. figured could drop Pacific island situation control. Still, supposed quarantined, hope doctors would know doing.

From personal POV, ""oh, shit"" moment Feb 28, [this video posted](/r/collapse/comments/fat0z1/so_this_is_what_true_collapse_sounds_like/). Recognizing lengths China going to, still containing things, knowing measures would never fly US, got bad feeling things going headed downhill quickly. next week, saw Italy spiraling control, lockdowns first regionally, nationally March 8 9. soon heard case shown county, started trying stay away people job, eating sack lunch car. couple days that, whole state went first ""shelter place"" order. Even that's true, lot rely childcare extended family, raised grandparents. Also, factor. We've also got weight, heart health overall fitness, none Americans excel at. 

I guess marginally better kids say ""Oh God, killed grandma,"" instead ""I killed Dad,"" still pretty fucked up. need take care mental health trying times!

Here list network therapist charge 500$/hr listen talk. I'm watching Black News Channel doctor saying going wait take 4 Bells Palsy outcomes trial. 

Personally, people know (not black) mixed people least recognize things normally years testing v. months. you‚Äôre also assuming every Alcohol Anonymous person black? going far. Oh sure, Sweden something. comparison world, next nothing.

The strictness restrictions differ much Norway Denmark, turn softer restrictions many hard-hit countries Europe. means issue complex question harshness restrictions. ""restrictions"" coercive force attached them, actually toothless recommendations.

High schools universities switched distance teaching. limit gatherings led many events getting cancelled. recommendations place led observable effect people's behaviour.

You could argue enough done, pretty clear done effect. Maskdicking. Oh brother, going again, another idiot guess normally vaccines take years develop .... *how could possibly make safe effective vaccine months* ...? they've pumped load money trials meant could lot scientists working one time normal. idea scales say normally takes hundred scientists working five years vaccine... company normally afford pay hundred scientists wages .... pandemic money pay thousand scientists working it, one needed working six months... complete number tests hundred scientists would five years.

It's manpower total hours worked right? Hey know Nazi party historically done bad things Jews past. totally rebranded image nowadays though! even Jewish board member. particular reason referred country origin instead company producing it? hear lot German Covid vaccine..or American Covid vaccine. think increasing vaccine hesitancy joke, go tell 'jokes' somewhere else. subreddit think they're funny. 1. really wasn't. Restaurants shut down, large gatherings forbidden, curfew alcohol sales cities, it.
2. People perceive such. German politics struggled convey sense urgency, measures discussed death introduction staggered. Formerly surprised never even heard nation. ignorant that's nothing proud of. wrong. Minorites poor people used controversial experiments many times past. right. Biontech vaccine getting distributed US, Canada, Mexico Britain. Russia started mass vaccinations already.

Parts Asia, Australia New Zealand beat virus without vaccine already.

At end month Europe likely authorize Emergency use. 

Why people still insanely pessimistic try fear monger people believingt entirety fo 2021 look like Death, Lockdowns Apocalypse. get it. 

I think become almost (just almost) bad denying existence Covid. 

Just slightly optimistic course 2021 marks idiot threatens life millions. fan trend. also antivax morons. That's enough competent leader listen experts medicine manage messaging accordingly. far know, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, poly(ethylene glycol)2000-dimyristoylglycerol (PEG2000-DMG) phosphate buffered saline, maybe excipients. needs stored -20 degC. pretty similar formulation Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine. whatever reason Moderna vaccine stable Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine, clear why. Speculating, probably due either difference dosing, specific chemical modifications mRNA, physicochemical properties formulation. personal interests first third options, that's bias is.

For comparison, vaccines worked formulation scientist intended shipment resource poor regions easily oxidizable components lot work engineering formulation require cold-chain whatsoever. also discussed adding anti-microbial agent like thimerosal allow multi-dose vials (which drastically lowers cost eases work-flow resource limited regions) decided due public perception.

As aside, SARS-CoV-2 evolved jumped humans five years ago, would probably shipping vaccines less year first outbreak. soooooo excited near future vaccine development! know full well heard, supporters detractors alike, ""proclaims"" ""will."" Damn! seems long history running disease minorities using lab rats try experimental drugs damaged confidence health care system... Damn.

I sure 100,000$ hospital bill slap need treatment also inspires soooo much faith. point surprised covid 19 mutates covid-20, covid-21 deadlier vaccine rendered useless. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Reddit bold fuck propaganda days virus species R0 less 1. Weird people like take achievement black person distort anti black narrative. ever get tired straw man nonsense? fair, CA testing relatively well also densely populated states, yeah, definitely anything proud of. think people reading news aware pandemic spread something easily reducacble single-variable like ""are kids driver, (yes/no)""

They obviously driver many places would statistics studies supporting degree. dangerous stop looking change. Maybe winter? Maybe parents getting less diligent keeping ill children home? could also region-specific conditions vary, study done one nations directly tranferrable another nation size, ventilation, routines school transports vary. looking useless comment, refer Let's forget Henrietta Lacks, whose cells collected doctors without consent used extensively specific studies without knowledge family without compensated acknowledged phenomenal contribution science human progress. There's long history black people thrown gears medical machine without consent recognition. family well! cancelled, delayed. :) hate racism.

Let's clap black woman accomplished something white males every day.

It pure racism. Ireland same. gov forced school back open 10% students tested positive 'the cases related other'. European countries accepting school close days early, told unacceptable even consider finishing 22nd December. wear masks socially distance young children many teachers students isolated alone Christmas. suggest anyone uses term ""military precision"" never military... absolutely correct. would hard-pressed find American, black white, knows anything Tuskegee experiment, anything history general. Unless rich, would taking stupider option 60% vaccine better none seems prevent serious illness, could waiting long risk severe covid meantime anyone else think it‚Äôs kind weird people standing side road cheering trucks? series events led bunch people wanting stand side road watching trucks go by?

When ""restrictions"" coercive force attached them, actually toothless recommendations.

It seems school transmission situation different countries muddied school closures, infection controls lack thereof, whether testing done asymptomatic cases, whether positive children traced least centrally reported etc etc. huge mess! Right, pandemic would over. We'd live constant restrictions, least herd immunity exists. would less cases, we'd still pandemic. shit Sherlock!  many countries also lockdowns Still fighting pandemic.

It seems main hope mass vaccination Oxford vaccine there's Johnson Johnson one. arent enough Chinese vaccines particular project, every researcher I've heard interviewed, even working competing vaccines, talked importance international sharing across teams. 

There's lot interesting science come race vaccine. course one working hard right now, jn next decade, research could lead sorts interesting treatments. cost $299 each.

Yeah. know, get people need colorblind future utopian society, nobody mention color person's skin. future world talking about, allowed say ""Oh guy, yeah he's gay"". gay friend never problem using word gay.... ""Juan? Yeah, mexican party"". ok? say Mexican? say German? Italian?

Me personally, think okay say person black. What's wrong black? Embrace skin. Indian friends, say word Indian, I. I've never seen move eyebrow do.

I think messed people think can't say black, like offended said eyes brown.

I agree race need inserted front headlines. 100%, stupid.

But need colorblind racist. See that's mean. even consider pandemic everyone runs around maskless gigantic festivals (even tho that's already case countries). soon number 1 priority group vaccinated I'm ready bet 50 dollars reopening general public life inevitable.

No. go ""specials"" like art, music PE week so, teachers exposed entire school. also people like speech therapists, gifted program teachers,, resource teachers float classes run pull programs mix kids. services mandated IEPs 504s can't provide services. Normally don‚Äôt sanitize hands touching every door handle work now. That‚Äôs quite excessive. I‚Äôll happy return pre covid hygiene. 

My concern catch COVID-19 transmit vaccine, simply pass forever get sick it. medically can‚Äôt get vaccinated get us. shouldn‚Äôt protocols forever? New York did. think running state money buy ad time. depends individual school. Neighboring districts vastly different. son's school 7-12, former district elementary school k-5, middle school 6-8 high school 9-12. Another close district k-12 building.

It's worth noting none schools state significant outbreaks, regardless structure. We're highly mask compliant, even small surge numbers far rest country. example, big hospital Stockholm year replaced 34 50 ICU-nurses. replacements mostly younger people fresh years work.

This years employee turnover bit bigger usually, general large.

Incarcerations list, santa, &amp; I'm throwing tantrum get I'm anti-lockdown, link provided says number positive tests went 11.1% 11.6%, missing something here. wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call gullibility. haven‚Äôt following let‚Äôs recap went.

The whole thing like textbook example create anti-vaxxers.

Step one: call ‚Äúoperation warp speed‚Äù

Step two: appoint former director many millions stock options Moderna lead said operation

Step three: announce Moderna leading vaccine despite never developing vaccine before, leader.

Step four: this:

White House chief staff told FDA chief vaccine must authorized Friday needs resign you, likely safe effective. isn‚Äôt enough safe effective. needs safe, effected, also trusted order work.

Doing shit like fucks critical trust part. Sure maybe way leader OWS could influenced this. simply way lay person know enough inner workings system totally sure.

And isn‚Äôt like, wake opioid epidemic, reason trust big pharma won‚Äôt taint medical system profits expense health. isn‚Äôt like last 4 years government given us reason believe corruption, profiteering, career self interest won‚Äôt important public health either, given response opioid epidemic, won‚Äôt protect people profit motive big pharma either. feel free roll dice covid! I'll fine vaccine zero deaths take chances virus killing 2000 people day US worldwide. Oh, ut taking chances health, risking health anyone come contact with. Please talk people actually willing something stop this.  Shut up. Freedumb  Nothing would crumble lost half people 75. That's valid question. I'm hopeful people trust science best families said done. work COVID patients want see people safe healthy. vaccine that, let's good humans. That's end soapbox haha ""Can talk input African American scientists vaccine process?""

What also talk countless Indians, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans etc worked vaccine behind scene?  lookit Mariah ""being sarcastic"" making  
locker room talk"" delusional bullshit district among one wealthiest America. Prison guards teachers also early lists.

Other professions, unfortunately, may harder target. Yes partially agree, rely government (besides ability collect tax) anything, ride awakening. anything, pandemic taught us self prepared. Unfortunately, short time passes, something happened, back square one. Beyond explicit statements declaring hoax, explicit ridicule &amp; cheap insinuation drump actively discouraged people immediately around taking sensible precautions tells *believes\** \- still *believes* \-- Covid hoax. 

&amp;#x200B;

\**to extent fungus 'believe' anything* African American something specifically American.

I never heard someone referred African Canadian, Canadians. child class got tested Friday parents tested positive. last day room week Wednesday. EVERY maskless child's test came back negative said ""she probably contagious yet."" boss said ""or kids really transmit it.""

Oh ok, still there. CDC saying means nothing anymore... nice thing congratulate people. Ypu congratulate sex race. Fortunately medical experts like Fauci agree me. I'm gonna believe you. Sorry essential workers also contact many people? People lazy easier believe one person hero villian. Throw race story got something people pay attention to. Yes, is. 2.9 million doses 'D-Day'? tired media spin. enjoy Mooch's Trump-slamming media tour going last year two. 

Not sure guy handle Trump gone longer needed. knew talking about, instead posting reddit popular talking point,, would know MASS INCARCERATION happening. Concerns long term safety vaccine unfounded. vaccine long term negative side effects ever history? I'm unemployment right get $430/week family four. 

Take home $385.

I know get $2600/month true. Look wealth GINI instead, actually top 5 world. Yeah low income GINI tax expenses, money end hands common people. I'm pretty sure general public access around April-June. That's I've seen thus far. ""Anyone wants get June."" 'Destroying lives 17 million people' mate come on, stop hyperboles, rough yea, hate too, dramatic. NL too, doubling merely week cases thought result black friday sinterklaas, imagine rise cases christmas, celebrated family old people, new year. form lockdown better part year, still corona deadly detrimental hospitals one worst flu epidemics last years (2018), largest number deaths 2018 week 4000, fully open society, corona 5000 week peak march/april/may, could gone much higher total lockdown. Hospilizatoins low now, probably rise soon since increase cases always precedes increase hospitalizatoins, Ernst Kuipers expecting increase coming weeks, value thoughts predictions internet people. thing exponential growth seem harmless explode control weeks time. professional people studied whole lives field recommend lockdown, wise listen, instead random people internet make decisions based gut feeling, corona bad flu gone lockdown again, nobody likes it, necessary. 

Matter fact, Americans saying exact months ago, 'infections might high, look low deaths hospilizations are, can't bad!' months later thousands people dying per day many states refused go lockdown take measures, better take much action little, better safe sorry. ... Hope helps? like optimism. 

I‚Äôm guessing 100m elected leaders, healthcare workers bourgeoisie. guess could see access vaccines want one mid-year, I‚Äôd still bet demand overwhelming supply September. really hope I‚Äôm wrong. Im reading beneficial. 
Upgrade DNA? Like billions years anyway? Isnt Crispr doing, bacteria enable defend viruses?

No, u/onetruepineapple. would even know it‚Äôs from? sound salty. awardee zero awarder karma, sir. virus situation isn‚Äôt bad developing countries, US is. close too. ""contact professions"" allowed, like hairdressers too. ideal solution, perhaps answering question, would serotype test prior vaccination. suspect vaccination previously infected COVID folk hurt them, benefit small, any, percentage. US incredibly good distributing pharmaceuticals. understand pessimism isn‚Äôt new problem it‚Äôs like trump personally directing logistics. Whats wrong guy? one lying pandemic exploding front face. dumb?

That going make difficult countries want open borders US travellers time soon. sure hope fix quickly. seen best friend(barely spoken online) since July acted like ridiculous hugging told Covid flu. expressed fear high risk family members contracting it, boyfriend talked like stupid, told entire thing hoax one really dying. 
Now messaging me, telling misses me. Yeah know go back friends people think act way. award yourself? Lol SAD Great idea. really hope get added soon give extra data see vaccine really starts noticeable impact. Fingers crossed! would worth thousand rushed vaccines. um, no?

It could however explain people keep testing positive. 

It also peer-reviewed yet fully published. pre-print. Thanks reply! look forward able visit next years (I thinking spring 2020 know went) US also imprisoned citizens basis ethnicity detonated nuclear weapons unnecessarily killed hundreds thousands civilians, stuff Soviets do. 

Fighting fascists good necessary let's pretend Allies hands clean end. Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine already approved, Moderna next that‚Äôll happen week. AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson come that, approved end January goes well. purchase, timing, % production run. I'm betting that, I'd fool now. wrong people? true though? course pandemic seen behaviors change significantly response new advice changing numbers. [I know webmd data mask usage increasing I'm sure we're reaching point diminishing returns see give up, consistent messaging get even marginal amounts people start following guidance good thing... know elementary school teacher. aren‚Äôt telling cases. don‚Äôt consider exposure masks worn, thus quarantines needed.

Reminds astronomer hailed ""being person discovered first black hole"" contribute team used colour filters visualize it. encouraging! hope people hang keep safety procedures months. Oh I'm Canadian, know. also know need personal travel insurance head south. 

I can't believe insurance provider put rider excluding coverage COVID infection charging roof it. 

And there's guarantee they'll able get back avail free healthcare. airline transfer positive patient (that know of) border make easy return they're symptomatic. miles advanced 1918. disaster absolutely comparable much worse. know exactly combat disease aren‚Äôt. ways population work remotely. know disease transmitted. failure much epic proportions. lucky disease isn‚Äôt deadlier would screwed. much worse 1918 without doubt. Sorry hear country going that. Xx reason virus dangerousis deaths hospitalisations. vaccinate people risk really worse flu. ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù let sink sec. haha Ah, yes, would require US actually organized enough take basic logical action protect inform citizens.

Just like seemingly little plans vaccine passport/proof vaccination status (supposedly there's ""paper card"" given).

Just like there's messaging encourage people already COVID get vaccinated yet.

Just like half doses held back unnecessarily second doses instead vaccinating double amount people immediately first doses, waiting second doses come later. race matter?  Wait, what's feeling? quite odd somewhat foreign. Yes, remember now, called hope! Read Capital. Stop h8 Congrats, thanks work. can, still wrong still openly lying states numbers. So, zero sum game throwing shit going anything aggravate you. accept it, considering lying numbers around safe regard covid dangerous act irrationaly. 

So, fuck yourself? new, millions years old. 8% genome viruses. scientists even theorize led evolution uterus/placenta. point, adult cant use Google facts trouble likely beyond help. NY going vaccinate well people value science. People going need learn lesson clearly education, news public info working. Doesnt mean wont try though. really.

It amazingly difficult recruit staff rural America. highly compensated professionals want live larger metropolitan areas enjoy lifestyle restaurants, cultural events, museums, travel.

Covid mostly kills old people Spanish Flu killing people 20s, much quicker rate. Yes better medicine today back didn‚Äôt fast food people weren‚Äôt sitting around watching TV playing video games. introduce Spanish Flu today US population amount underlying health conditions comorbidities, would easily several million fatalities months.

Likewise, Covid introduced 1918 would still deaths, wouldn‚Äôt many people pre-existing conditions wreak havoc on. F idea tracing positive people tell contacts they‚Äôve exposed. people test positive connect dots.

If tracing worked intended, would know somebody else would told restaurant it, spread certain day etc.

But don‚Äôt stress much - you‚Äôre afraid may catch again, get vaxxed. meant it‚Äôs well tested people already went covid, people zero antibodies first line, it‚Äôs necessarily dangerous. teacher want 'idiots learn lesson'? possibility lot people well *educated* vaccine need help others society become educated make right decision? doubt adamant 'idiots' think far people get confused / lost news information surrounding virus could use teacher (whether friend, coworker, random person internet) clear things set right direction.

Capitalism destroyed coughing flu someone please explain takes effect? receive vaccine still able contract transmit virus? know, I'm talking *you* wore Singapore. wear headscarf, woman, right? sense piece garb wore scarf?  agree Moderna Pfizer testing asymptomatic infections. would nice/useful, logistically complex.

But I'm getting info AZ-Oxford trial media, I'm getting Lancet, hear similar concerns clinicians. agree.

Contrary many reactions see, think spike mainly caused government decisions. 

Its caused many, many people simply giving shit Covid. understand impact have, care. Visiting (grocery) stores, traveling public transportation many places nightmare last couple months.

You lot different types running amok: ""what face mask types"", ""my nose needs freedom types"", ""dont like glasses foggy ill change straps mask openings side type"", ""i dont care distance, ill push aside grab want instead waiting 5 seconds type"" ofcourse inventors. decide make cut face screen 10 10 cms, thinking helps way.

We also markings floor guide distancing. woman get angry asked back bit. kid shopping cart, stayed back bit guy front me. walked right next asked distance bit nicely, said standing behind yellow line, distancing.

We Dutch love freedom free will, get that. comes restrictions slightly inconvenience us, many, many people smart enough, arrogant lack empathy see actions kill peoples parents grandparents.

I resorted delivery, going store late early hours literally use shopping cart distance tool people try walk next me.

I understand hard people understand scale all. even show people close time lapse videos university research project show uselessness splash screens use mask. try help people knowledge, many people dont care.

Lockdown horrible, people lose jobs much more. think many people see don't, beds hospital parking garages people dying hospital waiting rooms, sooner later.

I wish people would try/care little more, people healthcare everyone's loved ones... Maybe prevent another lockdown ones government always made right choices, lockdown caused public. owe healthcare workers lockdown, even horrible choice. sound like expect get year. Again, manufacture distribution issue here. giving doses - injecting humans logistics come that. expect able walk facility get injection walk 10 minutes? going happen. FWIW, I‚Äôm South Dakota (America) us healthcare workers getting vaccinated first dose week. Since 1918: thousand times knowledge, thousand times powerful. 

And yet thousands times stupid. can‚Äôt take anymore mink massacres. Oxford vaccine one ~70% efficacy? That‚Äôs still good, ngl hoping could get one ones &lt;90%. Like prison inmates?  racist assume I'm bot. 1/320,000,000 vaccinated? Please, travel. Eh, think concern =/= leap made. makes concerned current vaccine's effectiveness potential future yearly Flu type vaccine along whole supply chain would look like. Actually, 100% true. Even Tegnell admitted even questions whether stopping progress virus desirable. ‚Äú**We trying slow it**, disease never go away. manage, like South Korea, get rid it, even say count coming back. **Stopping might even negative**, would pent-up possible spread disease, open gates, possibility would even worse start, strategy allowing virus continue spreading controlled rate. ""herd immunity"" strategy whether like not.

Every action taken FHM designed around slowing stopping spread virus Tegnell et al. feared stopping spread short term could result worse situation later. wrong that, want admit it.

Even public statements make clear fear motivation behind strategy. constantly talked far away herd immunity was. constantly talked nations eventually ""catching up"" numbers cases deaths.

Later, second wave began hit, bragged going hit strategy worked, couple weeks looked like might right... shoe dropped. they'd prefer make smalltalk co-workers instead? ‚ÄúOh no! cabbages!‚Äù Great. Blame them. still doesn‚Äôt help anyone. break mindset

Good luck that... Variant spreads faster easier, time ease restrictions Christmas. Lovely. could possibly go wrong..... acceptable amount time vaccine produced worst global pandemic 100 years? think multiple countries pouring resources research would yield quicker results? understand, virus mutated varied much all. One vaccine (for now) work anywhere world. problem. problem vaccines prevent infection lower respiratory tract, prevent symptomatic disease vast majority cases, give immune response needed prevent infection upper respiratory tract. amount virus shed amount time contagious greatly reduced eliminated. Vaccines planned right (not sure far are, far understand) administered intranasally, this, gives proper antibodies fight upper respiratory tract infection, sure prevent lower respiratory tract infection disease. vaccines administered intramuscularly (IM) create enough antibodies upper respiratory tract. good enough prevent illness though - right, vaccines good enough, need able prevent illness infection. linking guy making quote, meant that. somewhat wasting time people say conspiracy. they're confident safe, fence convinced. people far path satisfy ego. anti-vaxx crowd safer bubble before, since polio measels rarer. we're pandemic now, covid everywhere, they'll end catching it. Sadly, we've seen evidence that's sure way learn lesson change mind. Yeah may take delivery numbers adjust certain amount spoilage etc Pretty much increase infection rate impossibility something like social distancing/remote work back then. consider every person wound ICU throughout death. probably significant percentage wound staying hospital oxygen even ICU. death rate would astronomically higher. Basically anyone needed medical attention time around anything overly precautionary would likely died back then. Best comment award me‚≠êÔ∏è That‚Äôs great sweetie point unless medical worker living nursing home waiting way government runs ... USA that‚Äôa given Rushing deadlines? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs safe! clear here... 


It's manufs delay drugs entry market; various trials approval processes. There's legit reasons doing, validate safety effectivness - adds years (and years) billions (and billions) time-to-market. Belgians Czechs socialized medicine? supporting people making shut without losing homes? Even doesn‚Äôt care COVID-19 don‚Äôt get vaccine shot Darwin awards!... might worst thing worries. definitely lot blind spots comes virus - combing crappy state level data (at least US) retroactively help either. us trying best. really would blame Americans skeptical government-pharma relationship utterly failed look interests? Poor America still midst opioid epidemic government failed protect big pharma‚Äôs profit motive. manufactured profitable epidemic stolen far life America Covid, expect people trust now? don‚Äôt much empathy you? 

They put guy 10m stock options Moderna head operation warp speed, announce Moderna front runner.

Then know ins outs system works, maybe nothing worry about.

But expect people familiar process. expect take word corrupt government country likely seen, industry profit primary motive? 

The problem systemic. votes? think we‚Äôre certainly course pace, 600k end 2021 makes assumption next administration gonna exactly fuck-all like Trump, far true point‚Äîit‚Äôs like one main talking points right now. Get lost, CCP propaganda bot. vast majority people wear mask inside stores. places see bars restaurants, honestly dine drink either right now. say know quite people age 20-30 still go every weekend though. fuckin annoying.  That's exactly means. Lack evidence means that, happen. crimes, voter fraud yes. 

You know conspiracy theory right? should, party loves them. actually they're saying? seems really high me, estimated 10% less country antibodies end September serology survey. county relatively cases too, like that's entirely isolated thing. actually unlikely county get anywhere near herd immunity without vaccine. US ones 100% manufactured US Also think ""social end"" particular. severe outcomes (ICU/hosptial capacity, cancelling postponing elective surgeries, fatalities) ultimately used justify restrictions shutdowns entire sectors least us Canada.

While stories handful young, (apparently) healthy people succumbing highly publicized, vaccinating higher priority significant step toward social end happier times everyone even little bit extraverted. love democracy Oops. correct your. can‚Äôt get leave county dumb fuck. People jobs, families responsibilities. Plus need work visa bunch shit. Shut dumb ass up. know get vaccine, sign up? California, US mean fast medical technology improved. Bus driver, bus used max 84. got limited 50 year attempt keep kids apart. largest day year bus 41, lot parents driving kids. Strict mask compliance bus. watch kids puting masks drive stops, like point, kids running around playing bus ride maskless. also disinfect fog bus run, bus may safest place kids day. Still shut school staff sick. Kids keep getting quarantined, kids covid. School dangerous. idea kid anything little disease vectors laughable. Ordinary citizens needed question role played bringing Christmas lockdown, Braun wrote. ‚ÄúThose honest know moments defiance, ignorance exhaustion lead one go Christmas shopping trip even though shops full. know little rebellious moments decided meet friends one time enjoy soup mulled wine felt like balm soul.‚Äù border supposedly closed? getting there? Covid least 300,000 Americans killed 9 months, true number likely much more. Maybe surpass 400,000 next March care? good chunk people wary vaccine part African American/Latino community groups generally distrustful towards medicine whole. gonna hard well lot think going used guinea pigs. read one article inner city health clinic majority african american stated half high risk patients said either flat refuse vaccine wait year two see safe first. unfortunately theres lot people think getting vaccine easy visably distinguish people did. Excited vaccine prospect light end tunnel, remember little ones can't get vaccine even though like 1 billion chance anything even happens ""under 10 years old"" crowd, like, decide things safer go day (send kid school?) point? Yes, probably unreasonable worry parents vaccine, but, hand, ""unreasonably worrying kids"" basically definition parent? govt helping places stay closed? 
Curious countries brains dealing things. Stupid gonna stupid People spending working hours chatting friends family sort reason offices exist. media truly done awful job reporting Covid. makes average media consumer uninformed speedy effort really calls question manufacturers take long vaccines could potentially saving lives.

Moooooooney

Vaccines make much money cost absolute fortune develop &amp; test.  Meanwhile constant source litigation &amp; law suits.  

So drug maker spend R&amp;D money surefire winner like diabetes drug pay bills years come? money-loser like vaccine?

The COVID-19 outbreak example Govt willing help fund cost, testing &amp; provide legal immunity drug manuf. There's useful information find variant actually is. Nobody publishing actual mutations he's talking about, clear unique UK import, mutation would seen elsewhere (mutations enhance fitness generally spontaneously arise multiple times around world).

And statements enhancing spread southeast sets bullshit detector hard. still suspect D614G mutation enhances fitness can't conclusively prove it. simply way they've identified new mutation conclusively shown responsible spread southeast. easily due random chance mutation involved series superspreading events southeast spread widely there. virus *relatively* unlikely mutate significantly. Given enough chances may, first world things start getting back normal spring probably mostly fall. 

There's real hiding poor countries lag behind, rich countries ordered 4-10x number doses need mostly pledged donate excess. look India vaccinated something like billion people relatively short time idea efforts third world need look like, going get eventually. 

Don't forget that, everywhere else, death rates drop quickly seniors targeted first. 20% vaccination rate might cut mortality well 50%. *Wolfenstein 3D: Movie* would dying ""was never virus""? makes sense good luck railroads ships

Anyone pointing disease infectious widespread going become endemic ignorned, downvoted, accused negative joy it. articles mentioned concerns certain vaccines development effective boosters shows expecting us need boosters. 

it's like scientist reported kids less likely die covid lot people switched meaning heads kids magically immune, fewer ace receptors factors still figuring make less susceptible severe illness death. Here's reminder. First vaccine given New York, right schedule provided buddy, pharmacist.

Doesn‚Äôt seem make sense would never able approve vaccine 100 percent efficacy read US expect able vaccinate one million per day. lot, going take long time there's hope herd immunity. probably able tell based new case data deaths. look either little (to judge vaccinations) official vaccine metrics February I'd use want things would make super spreader: eat crowded restaurants, talk next person line, sing choir (honestly choir would allow voice, still want join), go crowed concerts, take kids crowded museums around here...

My life hold know I'd likely spread COVID point. want reward care still stay home.

Now vaccinate clerk various stores would good - I'm likely interact them. number factory workers can't isolate job make things need. might super spreaders, give priority.  210 million people US age 18. Say 70% want vaccine immediately, gives 147 million. Currently Pfizer Moderna alone providing 100 million doeses US Q1 alone. 2 doeses per person 2 vaccienes get 100 million two first quarter. March 4 vaccines available vaccinate remaining 47 million plus whoever else decides want that. Mustelids (weasels, mink, ferrets, badgers, otters, fishers, martins, stoats, etc), felines, bats seem excellent disease reservoirs. 

You correct. virus impossible eradicate. It‚Äôs like rabies. Even excellent vaccines control measures edible vaccine bait wild animals mandatory vaccines pets - it‚Äôs still endemic many parts world. I‚Äôm veterinarian NC personally euthanized confirmed rabid dog.

This like rabies spreads air. Covid enters brain nervous system like Rabies. It‚Äôs like herpes spreads air. understand adults seemingly unaware it! wore slippy slide-y mask last week. frustrating keep adjusting it, uncomfortable left mouth. finally able put little bracket underneath helped stay up, thankfully. exact question; family infected early November, mild symptoms. Grandpa (who infected, totally fine) getting really old would love small Christmas gathering previously infected family + (not infected). Totally unsure safe not. Generally virus become contagious less deadly. virus wants survive becomes less contagious dies quickly can‚Äôt find new hosts. becomes deadly dies quickly kills hosts pass new hosts. doesn‚Äôt mean always turn way it‚Äôs likely early know right general trend would contagious less deadly. kids? panic media 

Not really. Various Covid-19 mutations reported months already. Perhaps first time you‚Äôve noticed. good metrics? I'm happy you! parent could tell kids little germ factories Whats thoughts vaccinated people thinking peace mind becoming super spreaders? chance since prevent transmission? got this.  realize 8000 people die every day US pre covid? 2.8 million Americans die per year Thank you! know website. know it'll reliable whole country (instead MA)? ""whoah half way there"" force fine without repercussions? thing happens. refuse pay fines what? 

I wish single death anyone personally plan getting vaccinated. one person's life valuable another? private sector, taken care of. company requires vaccinations, pregnant woman would likely shop use services don't.

Edit : saying perfect, neither government forcing vaccine. No, lol I'm expert understand got tiny fragment protein found hiv virus. uses protein produce antibodies, unfortunately also produced antibodies HIV, meaning HIV test would think infected virus.
Although impossible contract actual HIV vaccine, would cause problems public confidence also render existing HIV testing regimes meaningless, abort whole project. Hospitalizations continue trend downward well. Current hospitalizations SD 436 lowest it‚Äôs since November 2nd numbers still almost bad. see problem. patting back we're yet *as bad* 100 years ago.

To reverse last paragraph, making vaccine non mandatory saying it‚Äôs okay people die medically can‚Äôt receive vaccine. happens refuse vaccine go work sit next someone pregnant can‚Äôt receive vaccine gets dies.

They'll infect others. die.

There's question - get vaccine, part building trust product. Influencial people (politicians behind vaccination programs, influencers general) get vaccine. air.

This bullshit-sounding ""oh, cut line"" makes feel suspicious. believe - I'm none antivaxx/flatearth/climate change denier bullshit. 

This vaccine different. first mRNA vaccine given general population. development much quicker usual (not saying ""rushed"" ""unsafe""; pointing - quicker)... natural ask questions. POINTS taking would help build trust it. ""I cut line"" simply make sense. stinks insincerity. know corporate bullshit see one (I've worked large companies long time) - makes corpspeakometer go crazy. interesting see societal reaction hospitalizations, serious cases deaths, still positive cases.

Exactly. And, hopefully, hundreds thousands people still getting vaccine every day happens. We've heard deaths lagging indicator year, gonna vaccinations lagging indicator.

As far covid goes, nothing different today yesterday, ten days... wouldn‚Äôt they? buy something company can‚Äôt deliver fault own, back deal. least Pfizer, didn‚Äôt take Operation Warp Speed money would think would‚Äôve fairly standard contract risks subsidized government.

Because Limitations PHE data series
The PHE data series include deaths people COVID-19 suspected
but confirmed testing (SARS-CoV-2 PCR either negative done). suggests otherwise

But report suspected cases care homes, according ONS website.  trial 45000 people. Standard phase 3 trials 300 3000 people know joking I'm legitimately disappointed HC.

Perhaps lots naughty people there. SD get holidays without cases going again, it‚Äôs got Herd Immunity. Stopping spread too. Look deaths areas spread reduced. mRNA vaccines development years. one happens one first also received SHIT ton funding resources make possible. 

Also, tons experience making vaccines totally expected make safely That‚Äôs nice healthcare workers like best friend. rest us **screwed**. published testing protocols yet? criticism many experts russian vaccine I've seen stories like airlines ridiculous. Lat time SW flights attendant even wear mask, let alone dozens passengers, I'm confused end banned. Latino myself, find LatinX offensive term question anyone replies: long vaccine go back in-person activities? thinking board plane get back school- mask-wearing work airports? classes? ID photos? etc. TL;DR: USA, explicit list ""rights"", violations 1st, 4th, 5th amendments challenged, minimum. inverting concept rights giving liberty government. question whether government violating _its_ rights. Incrementalism precedence eroding threatening existing rights. Crisis rights risk. rhetoric trite.

* United States, limited explicit list rights. government determine rights are, fortunately. Bill Rights, really explicit limitation Government's rights are. enjoy liberty without requirement specific provision legal statute permit it. rights work.
* US, there's concern 1st amendment violated - specifically, right assembly, governments closing venues kinds practical alternative. I'm concerned governments actually think _they_ right restrict individuals spend time with, including holidays, can't make decisions themselves.
* Many concerns restrictions freedom expression religion, even [winning federal case government (to name one). Also Colorado, restaurant [had license alcohol violating 'orders' refusing close business (which would destroy them). paradoxical situation - close business order government risk stay open. is, cases like it, challenged violation 4th 5th amendments. would small business owner service industry lockdown (and never expirations) would destroy it, income, income employees? answer ""too bad, rights, government does.""

As far masks go, can‚Äôt name specific statute says ‚Äúgovernment shall make law requires masks‚Äù, know easily justified health codes, state emergencies, countless arbitrary things. Doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt challenged questioned - pretty big thing force population indefinitely. Also concerning state put burden enforcement businesses. question right that. bigger concern, far state authority goes, state-mandated indefinite lock downs closing businesses.

The responses well balanced tip towards authoritarian. many cases, destructive responses governors health departments done without legislative involvement oversight - perpetuity - renewing ""orders"" every month often expanding them. Tens thousands hundreds thousands restaurants businesses service industry permanently closed within first months 2021. owners staff jobs, mostly looking within industry destroyed government's response. already ripple affect across businesses support work service industry. Again, know that's justified name public welfare, good. government right this?

It's obvious original statement interest unlikely good faith. Instead, mock idea someone could skeptical anything surrounding virus reaction to. Including concept reverence individual liberty, appropriately acknowledge paramount many Americans. damn right are. unquestioning obedience acceptance authority become mainstream? Nearly year even crack? Based original comment, seems okay surrendering ""individual rights"" means ""help fellow humans"", pretty broad lofty idea. draw line that? altruism self-defeating?

You right - many us buy hysterics around this, constant browbeating preaching change this. rejection skepticism response unique United States - many around world protesting this, extent free so. Germany, recently [used water cannons lockdown Cases spiking everywhere, even places extremely draconian enforcement.

Any question Covid response (questioning Government) met full derision across Reddit sites. sympathize mentality government's position.

The government way bounds here. minimum, serious reform needed reign totalitarianism we're seeing demonstrated unchecked governors, whether existing law permits not. government enjoy unchallenged authority response - forever?

All says nothing innumerable widespread affects go seemingly ignored response this. Suicides, depression, divorces, domestic abuse, drug abuse, psychological damage everyone societal breakdown - exacerbated government media. pressure. too, mate! percent people already infected?  immune already, least yet determined period time. 'bro', moron. coping, called science. Shut fuck educate yourself. reason love science (that relies data), much data currently lacking, data come time. still many variables tested, think make safe decision data gathered. (Granted ""threshold"" met. feel ""unknowns"" long terms effects Covid pose risk ""unknowns"" long term effects vaccine?....and honestly anticipating I'll lining vaccine sooner later.) 

This link host people recommending *not* get vaccine, curious. guy specializes failing read room. Eh, I‚Äôll take year strong artificial immunity (without sickness) developed hundreds scientists six months ~~natural~~ apathetic immunity (with sickness). 200+ endemic viruses, including 4 Coronaviruses. likely people catch child get vaccine never really effects badly again.

When get older viruses damaging, long decent amount immunity population take vaccines really issue. Yeah even orgy that's excessive. Bile? literally metric that's reported per ONS; ""Deaths within 28 days positive covid test"". also figure reported media. Watch BBC updates hear say this. Maybe think two seconds lashing like moron. I'm saying need think comparing figures covid carefully different countries using different metrics report deaths especially comparing historical pandemics difficult different recording is.

But somehow I'm spewing bile. Ok, guess expect kind stupidity Reddit now. work data science, making sure comparing like like metrics kinda first thing pretty obvious even though deadly children, could still get spread like every illness kids get spread around. 

It definitely campaign attempt get schools opened back parents could get back work.  every flu vaccine every year? new every season they've never hurt anyone, ""we dont know long term effects"" idiots going fuck whole world cause tens thousands needless deaths gonna happen, called risk management. vaccine risk killing someone minimal compared reward living normal life. everyone vaccinated, long return in-person activities again? assuming masks etc on. it. highly doubt they've reached herd-level immunity. People probably began take things seriously heard Mabel two houses passed away it, uncle Jerry COVID denier ended ICU, etc. control embarrassing laughing stock state every anti-mask state fucked up. past 6 months calm fucks ruined us. Seriously, joke children take cues parents. parent makes big deal masks, kid too. 

Ding ding ding, winner. depressing parents even know bit core wisdom raising kids. Ok get solitude bit....but Santa Claus???? true reducing death right necessarily total deaths. Total deaths encompass fatalites longterm effects surviving infections deadly also. Considering cardiac blood clot issues observed reduce spread quickly possible may reduce deaths all. something think approach planning. people already use mental gymnastics whenever rationally go view. doubt CEO taking vaccine would anything "" vaccine rushed wait long term effects"" people. 

Top scientists world fore front covid19 pandemic willing take matter people bring up. would CEO suddenly matter people don't? gonna wait 9 months preggos give birth. Also important remember substantial progress happen long *everyone* gets it. we've got high risk citizens vaccinated, probably start lifting restrictions, least partially.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  know that. I'm saying 60% thing include asymptomatic cases This: numbers made bullshit question: exactly 52% immunity mean? 1 2 chance get exposed? get it, 1 2 chance symptomatic? mRNA based drugs market today? Reminder worst pandemic modern human history lasted 18 months left permanent remnants human behavior Maybe author around 50's.  Polio vaccine campaign pretty out. wanna date flapper wearing masks?

Misleading title though. everyone else **his age (74)** gets also?

Fauci age Trump, he's turning **80** Christmas. woke bullshit. Somehow LatinX appropriate Latino. think lockdowns, also think priority get young people vaccinated ASAP too. I'm glad see feds trying secure additional mrna vaccines ""normal"" people Ya guess could it‚Äôs harder guess they're bit delayed, expensive produce less vaccines. That's remember least üôÇ citizens sense may get relief virus brought public health system knees crushed economy.

Much like US ü§î  Coronavirus new, around, I've cats die past.

What's new strain hits people spreads like crazy.

We lot data bout virus family, research attention dedicated it. really fast appears understand amount data research already had. saw studies showing children spread disease. I‚Äôm sure everyone chose ignore follow lead politicians. new normal virus thousands corpses piling every day bad political leadership rampant selfishness.

It's awful, it? report isn‚Äôt well written, ‚ÄúThe mass inoculation‚Äù right. signal cut lot noise mentioned (lower testing numbers example) number hospitalizations continues drop.

Are capturing fewer cases are? Probably. also likely Wisconsin we've gotten past lot really severe stuff. We're 2.5 weeks post Thanksgiving. really evidence major post Thanksgiving surge unless surge covering would even steeper drop.

More likely, wisconsinites seeing family time now. Mobility data carriers supports this.

Active cases WI (cases person within 30 days testing positive actively treating hospital and/or within strictures dead) well 60K couple weeks ago. 44K we're seeing lot tests end massive surge October November drop off.

Will likely continue fall.

Hope vaccine beat next surge punch Wisconsin worst it.  joking I've heard people say without sarcasm. keep hand sanitizer mask go business normally. bit nervousness try best think much it. guy dumped stock news vaccine.

Fuck guy fuck corporate PR machine trying spin good guy. save semester abroad junior year! :) would think get first vaccine Jan, granted might work bit get think possible.

Looking \[1\], plausible July we'll get 60% immunity, half could attribute prior infection half vaccination (of course, counting immunity acquired first).

\[1\] I'll go behind Walmart get vaccine guns. watching news morning live shots staging area get vaccines packed onto trucks. people responsible took job seriously, working carefully quickly, overwhelmed sense gratitude. I'm happy people got standing ovation, semblance thereof. deserve it. So, tested people asymptomatic mild symptoms, sample size 40?

The results confusing. report people treatment group tested negative 3 weeks, also seems like stopped tracking people altogether that?

So comparison works civilized society, I'll share happens country. New Zealand normally provide taxpayer-funded medical treatment citizens, residents, long term work visa holders. COVID made exception made free everyone else (international students, short term workers, tourists, etc) well.

We use gold standard PCR tests - none rapid tests. got results next morning 3 tests did. need pay get tested, get infected, treatment would free also. right supervisors would likely vacation sick time available remaining.

So statement factually true yet downvoted fit narrative here. Priorisation identifying small-ish subgroup give preferential treatment. ""People get covid yet"" 300 million treat last 20 million now, seems highly inefficient/impossible check (how conclusively prove covid yet).
""People working hospitals elder care, at-risk group"" easier singled treated preferential. Lol, getting voted debunking thread full false claims sub pretending science. Redditors need daily hit dopamine calling abstract unverified form racism

The whole medical system joke scam. studied like ‚Äúthat‚Äôd sick repeat‚Äù restrictions put place spring enough curb first wave, understand would've necessary restrictions back then. Sadly restrictions came late, however, meaning many already infected then.

Most European countries avoid closing schools younger kids would detrimental kids' health development. high schools universities closed spring second wave, however. Grades 7-9 also closing several places now.

From scientific perspective, think bit interesting spring wave brought control second wave still rampaging. all, restrictions stricter now, almost 10x testing capacity. compliance worse spring? virus much seasonal thought? purpose system

or great Europe helps friends out, politics nationalism aside I, one, shocked didn‚Äôt study vaccine enough women. It‚Äôs like never issue happened before... /s parents wrote one grandmother died covid blamed current administration driving many forces reasons pandemic spun control. local newspaper chose publish apparently pointing obvious much. Critique that's rooted bad faith arguments always welcome.

Misrepresentation fit political narrative, much. Must feel great American citizen know people absolutely nothing pandemic, among first get ""rewarded"" vaccine. 

Some even heavily contributed getting bad first place. I've pretty unhappy passive Sununu whole time. get always gets free pass, like one pays attention threats vetos etc. trying keep New Hampshire strategy line ""Sweden"" strategy whole time. talks like he's lot, he's not. Europeans invented vaccine, also produce lot it. plant Bruuns, Belgium. done US. cases control. Christmas coming. Fuck Oh, that's tempting You‚Äôre dreaming. defending point, i.e. doubling it... less 50 people die lightning strikes per year USA. Covid already killed thousands young people less year. disease take months die from, especially young healthy. scientific consensus numbers underreported. stop downplaying it. Again, already number one cause death people (im assuming) age. getting worse everyone immune whatever means. 

The reason catch course keep others safe, also yourself. might trivial bug think is. mean lockdowns destroying people‚Äôs livelihoods?  Well, next nothing, far enough. no, herd immunity severe misjudgement virus hope Harris creates memorial somewhere America.   Something like Trump responsible every death here, list names.  

Maybe family eating dinner empty chair like Biden eluded debate.  Omg got chills said hoped trump would show humility apologize plague brought upon world kidding. Also Mass, thinking thing. know he's referring hospitals overloaded, suspect might able avoid problem even happening. Regardless people see privately, mask-compliant area. Transmission general public seems pretty low here... real possibility asymptomatic individuals never got tested.  idea China many? Sounds like uncle's fault. blaming people trying live, guy? Ummm. Naw, like state that's really similar Massachusetts Massachusetts people like laws taxes go skew politics dysfunctional cesspool. 

Arkansas hand just... Arkansas. I'd hope would like 10 10 something like 99 100. Russian. doesn‚Äôt make point invalid. thinking prove prejudiced racist are.

By way taken vaccine, feeling good idea discourage people go visit someone evening. want everyone apartment/house time socializing likely happen (after work) CVS requires app schedule appointment get vaccinated current app collects everything get hands including names every app running device, calendar contents, location/GPS history, phone number contacts, full access storage (photos, videos, music, personal files), full access camera microphone, access wifi connections (for additional location tracking), device ID, call service information, bluetooth settings access anything near via near field communication, full access internet via device, ability modify devices settings anytime want.

Obviously CVS need access stuff either, corporations care making money something makes money assume legal not. Youre joking. already population risk heart disease, far one significant risk factors large % population. youre try tell significant tissue damage/scarification lungs evidence increased risk heart disease?

This isnt false claim youre fucking downplaying shit weve known awhile. Weve known long time theres relationship pulmonary function heart function. What's Moderna one then? needs kept cool, cryogenic like Pfizner. Welcome world wishful thinking driving political decisions. don‚Äôt understand means.

IIRC, one early south korean studies also conclusion 10 half likely transmit well, 10 adults. may dutch study claimed science coming school policy.

I honestly read many papers expert this, wish whole situation politicized actually rely experts actually make good policy. It‚Äôs Inslee Newsom. Barring serious health concerns , efficacy even 70% would save countless lives expect one trumps allies? Germany federal nation well - Merkel can't really anything, rules quarantine, distancing, shop opening times, schools opening closing - that's hands 16 german states huge differences right now. seems like finally managed agree nationwide strategy, still differences state implement strategy USA probably demographics letting run free also 3%.
India much higher younger population currently running 2%.
I guess countries decide much grandma worth. can't find example history people said epidemic hoax. breaking new ground here! can't really tell I'm missing irony serious.

Many *Russian* doctors scientists critical Sputnik vaccine, saying poorly tested used political gains.

There legitimate concerns. live age preventative labeled ""poison"". people around 50s we'd still polio smallpox. believe referring availability. Granted read comments article Schools fairly safe kids, safe teachers custodians anyone else. 

Since can't really schools without teachers...

I admit evidence anecdotal. Since wife returned school, roughly eight teachers (very small) school contracted COVID. people virtually nothing work going nowhere else, know damn well they're default huge risk anyone encounter. even go near other. else getting it? think went Twitter frightening amount almost depressed people refuse acknowledge Pandemic nearing end next year.

Like almost seems pissed it. literally expecting us sit 7th Lockdown fucking October 2021 every store, cinema, gym whatever closed. 

They equally denying science Covid deniers point. Yeah, immature easily distracted, masks kinda suck kids faces slide easily. mean ‚Äúlose beds‚Äù article? Hospitals lose overall capacity (total number beds) funding decreases. Day-to-day capacity (occupied beds) different thing.  hint amaretto Haha Everyone hates eachother Yeah....In damned times March went way apologize old friends hadnt talked years....Just wish well apologize suffering even though suffer? wouldnt wish hell worst enemy, say...

This stagnation, real.

Like Groundhog Day - living fucking day again....

Misery. face masks...

Shit. forget 16 years old. again, average age dying covid higher death itself. Young people dying this. It‚Äôs ridiculously low rate one high enough overwhelm hospitals. That‚Äôs grounds reopen. also assumed vast majority elderly people vaccinated March warp speed expects vaccinate 100 million people then. 

My timeline basically one ones mentioned earlier; either normal May April-July. Yup, whatever think men, Clinton, Bush Obama good things ‚Äòblack swan‚Äô national health crisis. It‚Äôs beyond fucked little used needed. Wait wait wait wait wait. You‚Äôre saying simple, basic precautions we‚Äôve know decades actually work??? Crazy talk. Yeah bgd job right /s.


Yes lol, glad see another one piece fan wild. Efficacy ‚â† transmissibility. Probably timeline. longer months. Yes catch vaccine spread it. may ok spread someone lucky get vaccine yet bad off. basically entitled. Can't wait bit longer. fine cares others. They‚Äôre getting first crack vaccine. isn‚Äôt something? feel much. interesting would take long. I'd figure distribution major metropolitan centres along southern border would quickest, that's population anyway. hoping 5 years part would give away lol Honestly, can't even believe anyone surprised point. didn‚Äôt bring elderly population article, read it

Because ones get first priority vaccine. sure there‚Äôs way society won‚Äôt force degree normalcy elderly people vaccinated covid deaths really low.

That‚Äôs matter opinion. think depends many deaths still occurring among non elderly population. Two problems reasoning these. 1) assume elderly population going get vaccinated time, 2) ignore proposition hospitalizations deaths continue increase among younger population longer pandemic goes on, we‚Äôve seen date last several months.

I think you‚Äôre optimistic timetable return normal reasons. Well entitled. know quit right? probably one people telling quit speak fucked is. 

So thank vets anything special beyond paycheck right?

They getting higher viral loads dying save us normal folk. deserves lot, understand people like you, entitled ungrateful. used think pandemic control small country easier big one long gov. trying control it. smaller population, easier testing contract tracking. Lithuania going well right now? Put little faith friends. Al Gore little higher education climate change he's expert subject now. So? say rare. said lucky. Trusting government insurance sounds great all, they‚Äôre people got us $20+ trillion debt. They‚Äôre exactly good money Turn Java script got control winter, lockdown started June cases dropped time spring started decreased massively enought try elimination. since happed.

Also cool wet spring summer year. military's actual prime focus, despite good lot stuff. able move stuff support operations anywhere planet insane.

It's lot WW2. Russians dying, food ammo moving American built trucks, production lines Americans helped set up. September, news actual efficacy came Same, man. spend buying iPads apps students they're next big thing rather anything evidence proving works. 

Netbooks students next big thing iPads. accomplish? ""But muh heart disease deaths!!!!!"" -Facebook Lol. Science deniers . know anything vaccines... vaccine positive? ... crying unto God vaccine 666, want God destroy it, vaccine meant corrupt DNA people, asking God interrupt it, clean vaccine, must produce quickly.""


I love critics vaccine openly admit know even basics vaccines. article garbage. vaccine readily available anyone everyone want take it, back normal. court permit business closure etc 5% chances people get sick. Doubled triples since when? Lol like maybe 15-25 years ago exception see essential workers i.e. medical personnel, first responders. sure. Wtg Kizzy! made cry like baby. Link sources Pfizer said data it. 

It true statement, evidence support it. Ha! really really enjoying this. Thanks this, love kind stuff. Yeah you‚Äôre basically confirming point. think people agree me, I‚Äôm somehow wrong. Makes sense dude

I objectively say I‚Äôm trusting top public health officials‚Äô timelines article. top this, actually factually incorrect imply spread virus vaccinated. Lastly, it‚Äôs misleading make 95% effective vaccine sound worse small 5% chance get sick (and serious case nonetheless according data) FTA Helmer Eco Chic said community leaders ‚Äúneed backbone small businesses.‚Äù called hesitant without masks ‚Äúafraid‚Äù told ‚Äústay home,‚Äù described community members ‚Äúcommunists‚Äù ‚Äúsnitches‚Äù likened plight small business owners ‚Äúyellow stars‚Äù shirts, reference Jewish people targeted Holocaust. 
There also references rally creating new California, waving flags honoring President Donald Trump calling current health crisis serious one. article infected, better bet get vaccine rather take chances virus. 

So, prime material /r/NoShitSherlock? Sorry questioning current situation painfully, obviously failing every level. 95% immunity antivaxxers contagious 14-20 days each. I'd say gets R0 1. ask many Vietnams we've since March. They‚Äôre actively working gut American healthcare system. counts, right? one source saying transmit virus vaccination get it. vaccine prevent catching transmitting much getting worst case it. entitled think ok vaccinated screw everyone else still. quickness get vaccine depends many doses us get quickly. estimates vary.  funded vaccine, yet Pfizer able take credit. time goes I'm beginning see ""Pfizer vaccine"" commonly. crazy fast name catches others lost. BioNTech made begun heralded Pfizer's. Maybe I'm dramatic feels like vaccine starting politicised like virus masks were. money making machine many. longer people stuck home, ordering online clicking ridiculously baited articles, better. really hope people snap this. federally semi-funded science body CSIRO [this study uncovered‚Äòs survival temperatures varying 20 40¬∞C. found COVID propagated survived best 20¬∞C.
Our average daily temperatures are: September 18c, October 20c , November 22c. perfect weather Covid last surfaces still beat it.
I‚Äôd also note actually began lockdown late July still four weeks winter go. Weather probably play role roll summer proper, certainly time peak pandemic numbers, cold perfect transmission. Never heard before, great tradition. accomplishment. Thank scientists. Intelligence data driven information moves world ahead. Unfortunately, people groups trying hold us back Believe science. primary biomarker endpoint study within-group changes high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), measure inflammation. Within-group changes D-dimer also examined. VASCEPA administration resulted 25% reduction hsCRP (p=0.011) well reduction D-dimer (p=0.048).

In addition biomarker changes, assessment made COVID-19 symptom changes baseline 14 days influenza patient-reported outcome (FLU-PRO) score, validated patient-reported outcome measure designed evaluate presence, severity duration flu symptoms clinical trials. VASCEPA administration resulted significant 52% reduction total FLU-PRO prevalence score compared 24% reduction usual care group (p=0.003 groups), reductions across individual score domains, including significantly larger reduction compared usual care body/systemic domain (54% vs. 26%; p=0.003). Significant reductions FLU-PRO symptom score compared usual care also observed total symptom score (p=0.003), well body/systemic (p=0.0007) chest/respiratory (p=0.01) domains. 

How much get paid post? seriously saying ignore law? Why? giving democrats cancer years. best part? can‚Äôt sue them. They‚Äôre legally immune 100%. execs dumped stocks. That‚Äôs good sign though right? unfortunately going take stupid. people, like 95% survive. they'll think strong next pandemic comes, come likely lifetime, they're going spread like, well plague. mass stupidity needs dealt with. know how, I'll old likely weak next time. America, get shit together. didn‚Äôt bring elderly population article, read it

Pretty sure there‚Äôs way society won‚Äôt force degree normalcy elderly people vaccinated covid deaths really low. uk instance bought enough doses cover risk population post isn‚Äôt remotely true today‚Äôs pandemic last one hit US 1918  Well joke's us, then. Target anywhere around anyway!

Agreed: duration protection re-infection seasonal human coronaviruses might last less year.15 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) re-infection occurs dromedary camels, natural host virus.16 Whether re-infected camels infectious primary infections known. observation MERS-CoV enzootic dromedary populations despite high seroprevalence juvenile adult camels implies virus transmission may functionally interrupted previous infection. Also relevant influenza vaccines reduce disease transmission,17 whereas inactivated polio vaccines effective protecting disease less effect reduction faecal shedding poliomyelitis virus18 thus possibly transmission.
These observations suggest cannot assume COVID-19 vaccines, even shown effective reducing severity disease, reduce virus transmission comparable degree. notion COVID-19-vaccine-induced population immunity allow return pre-COVID-19 ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù might based illusory assumptions.
Source:   equal number republicans democrats contracted virus, remember Biden, Obama, Pelosi, 20% governors/senators got sick. Also South Korea, strict compliance policy extremely dense population, control part. silly. That‚Äôs even start it. doctors _know_ certain procedures tests _will_ covered insurance, charge insurance lot them. they‚Äôll order arguably unnecessary tests recommend overly extreme procedures courses action lucrative. Specialists ‚Äî like ear, nose, throat doctors (ENTs) ‚Äî tend often. may go ENT something like congestion. They‚Äôll run tests multiple follow-ups test retest things. every visit take X-ray, perform endoscopy, solution way many problems kind surgery. (‚ÄúLet‚Äôs remove tonsils see it. Maybe slightly deviated septum fix too.‚Äù)

Insurers often push back ‚Äî ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt really necessary, we‚Äôre paying it‚Äù. doctor appeal decisions, costs insurer time money. doctors treat invoices like starting point negotiations insurance companies. order every battery tests procedures could possibly argue necessary, maybe insurer push back them. They‚Äôll meet middle doctor end getting paid bare minimum necessary fix problem. there‚Äôs huge incentive over-treat over-test rather provide right amount treatment. It‚Äôs uncommon e U.S. end cycle tests referrals specialists, trying different procedures drugs new drugs fix side effects old drugs and... it‚Äôs awful. patient, insurance premium could increase doctor recommended procedure test didn‚Äôt follow get test.

Say want government bureaucracy. private health insurance healthcare system already kafkaesque nightmare. surprise movie TV production considered essential months pandemic. 

Many public seem give pass claim daily tests everyone.

The fact tried bite tried give benefit doubt pretty clear either jealous evil. enough evidence accuse evil I've accrued enough bad faith nail jealousy thing head.

It's clear easily triggered bad faith debater I'm happy rub successes face going attack them, clearly upper hand here. toys rage. I'll hit send happily knowing I'm making furious jealousy.

Btw, never went college. I'm really smart work really hard debt outside mortgage. Bet bothers fuck you. Yeah stories people getting murdered told wear mask like WTF?? someone shed light this? looked hospital capacity LA county right now. It‚Äôs 75% capacity.

I'm confused. probably back March. middle cluster dozen people close contact tested positive least dozen similar symptoms never getting tested all. People told getting vaccinated would stupidest thing possibly telling encouraged skip vaccine. understand recommended advice here. arent disagreeing anything debunked anti semitic conspiracy theory. 100 million people vaccinated February happening. Maybe end summer. one the... Wait go? Oh, he's golf course... course! Yep. there's probably billion people infected worldwide far. evidence that, spouting silly elitist's talk. live south bend north you, everyone see complete compliance also. really depends county in.  say though, apparently lot companies using trucks Uhaul Penkske Covid. move days usually rent truck like 30$ + mileage now.. it‚Äôs 999$ ...wtf Mainly [dry ship vaccine, Pfizer designed specialized containers packed enough dry ice keep minimum 975 doses cool 10 shipments arrive, Pfizer dosing sites receive another shipment UPS 40 pounds extra dry ice keep vaccines frigid He‚Äôs still playing virus. Holding massive parties. Holding massive rallies. Encouraging protests. Refusing urge caution.

It‚Äôs absurd. Yes no. constitution generally stops enacting extreme measures (i.e. preventing freedom movement rules like Melbourne had) imposing curfews, still lots measures could taken recommendations could've made chose to. (and have) limited gathering sizes, mandate school closures necessary, able place limits businesses. also passed emergency law spring allowing wholesale closure businesses (gyms, theaters, restaurants, etc.) deemed necessary reduce spread COVID, never used powers law expired June without renewed replaced. now, anyone ever suffered anaphylaxis advised take Pfizer's vaccine Britain, Canada, Pfizer. 'allergic' reaction allergens involved, vaccines made eggs people egg allergies avoid them. what's happening.

5% population suffering undeclared possibly fatal allergic reaction-- discovered first small round vaccinations-- problem. 1% people fatal reaction multiply population level insignificant.

It's what, week since everyone declaring risk adverse side effects. must taking many, enough crazy pills 5% US population suffered anaphylaxis. Fatal outcome rare, even people known venom food allergy, fatal anaphylaxis constitutes less 1% total mortality risk. Site disaster mobile. first person world get vaccine UK. know USA fkd news start using ""9/11"" counting unit. Three good ones sure. thought well. Even don‚Äôt perfect vaccine, drastically reduces symptoms achieve level complications comparable flu, would huge success could resume lot regular life. Totally fair friend. also stopped visiting certain areas don‚Äôt take seriously. stick Cuyahoga county taken seriously already herd immunity though never said hoax; states exercised autocracy lockdowns disproportionate IFR/CFR virus ""Most get fine""
99% though??

""Imagine overwhelm hospitals. ""
There cases Canada.
Even plenty people record firsthand insides hospitals prove point. 
The resources already there.
Doesnt really warrant shutdown...
Not trying skeptic thinking big brain facts here. That‚Äôs problem. It‚Äôs interference certain someone attempted pull yesterday. Honestly community spread rampant nothing pinpointed exactly event. spread many parts family workplace. (My dad uncle big company bunch offices hit them. working person. dad isolated different building tried implement work home shot down)

Also, funeral 250 well spaced huge church masks. (still absurd) 60 people showed supped club though. 

It‚Äôs dark ask. I‚Äôm fucking pissed potentially exposed dad almost died lung clots 2 years ago, yet send card call express condolences. stinks he‚Äôs office anymore hope levels high atm. Well mean can‚Äôt much fuck anything else believe continuation previous post, work clinic difficulty people refuse observe entry protocols ( temperature check, hand sanitizing, Etc ) one older gentleman barged accord: asked he'd screened yet held wallet(?) flashed deputy badge me, meant exempt entry processüôÑ! 
I told mean anything he'd screened: reasoning? NEEDED USE RESTROOM! 
he already entered building, compromised efforts we've taking everyone's safety lost it! 
On way mentioned something along lines deputy "" mean something "" told absolutely nothing ignoring procedures! 
Being man law, think he'd inclined Obey rules protocols , NOOOO!
Anyway, let threw hands frustration exclaimed loud, "" ..damn, ANOTHER idiot ü§™!"" guess done I'd reached breaking point! Quaranteening returning skiing tourists March. Prioritized testing. still can't get tested asymptomatic. Please tell u/jgjgleason attempting communicate then. Good luck! entire process nightmare say least. Hoping world around us looks lot different summer, we're able celebrate much friends family! CDC, FDA, NHS, EU etc mad man? Fauci? dont know, dont care. I'm concerned America Americans. Interesting. don‚Äôt know much subject assumed far 3. thought believed pandemic hoax?  would get early access vaccine hoax? lot things ""they constitution"", now. would take grain salt. vaccines stop called long covid?  Interesting. TIL! I've read confirmed second infections could count fingers toes. many them. get want get again. Calling people cautious new vaccine conspiracy theorist great way ensure get vaccine near term *Enter Kushner.*

He‚Äôs Third Man, minus charm, intellect wit. I'm watching Lions game Kalamazoo right Ugh, that‚Äôs terrible. I‚Äôm sorry deal that. frontline workers, health/medical workers, represented unions labor representatives, first people receiving vaccine, makes sense sure effective them. literally selfish review board. Ahhh good luck there! live Ann Arbor, quite liberal place. Wasn‚Äôt quite keen losing Abdul primaries, very, happy COVID hit. Think way. first doses disproportionately large impact they'll go highest risk people. hopefully number hospitalizations deaths drop dramatically next month. I‚Äôm happy aware going back February...even though thing got pay attention China disappearing citizen reporters.  vaccines available in, like, 2 weeks. I'd imagine could find hospitals get vaccine book vaccine hospital.

You know that's works America, right? go hospital \*or\* hospital B... said it. (Apart obvious social distancing measures make parade unfeasible.) wife worked 60-80 hour weeks fighting CoVID19 nine months now.

She‚Äôs gone shopping three times since February drive 90 minutes get area requires masks can‚Äôt good faith risk getting exposed many community need her.

She agreed jump ship things get control here, there‚Äôs point practice medicine area treats doctors nurses like this.

I don‚Äôt even care lose money selling house, I‚Äôm done region. newly approved vaccine Pfizer made available work close quarters nation's top leaders, two people familiar matter confirmed. said move meant prevent COVID-19 spread White House, already suffered several outbreaks virus infected Trump top officials, critical facilities. dang really Can't someone equip miniature drone spy camera fly COVID ward? Seeing believing. deniers need pictures go stories. Otherwise, stories words, deniers think made anyway.

So, can't see what's happening U.S. hospitals HIPAA? manner info gets leaked time. Celebrity nudes, government malfeasance, credit card numbers, social security numbers... name it. HIPAA's holding us back?

Where ever-loving fuck whistleblowers go!?  explain think would ended 2 months? exactly would work? Restrictions would ease, cases would go up, we'd similar spot.

Less cases, sure. pandemic ends herd immunity. stuff article steps taken protect cargo might help ease  exponential growth, logistic growth. even gets worse people things slowing growth may bit naive think would double like November. 500 deaths day day days possible seriously doubt 7 day moving average hit 5k (it's 24xx now) worse live free let others around die!

 like dr nurses trying save people infected spreading freedum!

friends let friends superspreaders

and selective empathy concerning feature leader. really care, finally get outraged someone know gets hurt... gets rolled UK end Dec - I'd expect would provide huge amount data. double blind, controlled trials - still - valuable info able prove effectiveness saftey. state hadn‚Äôt properly sorted yet.

Part that's number vaccines delivered immediate future keeps changing. news people‚Äôs skin color absolutely reason now? return quarantine-free travel Australia New Zealand come end March 2021, Jacinda Ardern said.

I set leaky three months ago, news perfect timing. Yeah think important clear never estimated September, said September would earliest based rates infections.

It's they've missed deadlines. Facts don‚Äôt matter, race apparently. refers Turkish, give first company Turkish name, I‚Äôm pretty sure didn‚Äôt call daughter ‚ÄúHeidi‚Äù either.

I‚Äôm gonna go limb guess haven‚Äôt met many Turkish people life. 

Maybe chill out. never called Turkish. don‚Äôt get saying insulting offensive. feel way, sure hell don‚Äôt. Wait..so Iphones suspect low quality? No, probably first 10 15 though. burying people? never hear morgue workers deal surge must logistics nightmare. Also, morgue workers susceptible infection folks died COVID? linger death? patience needed. anyone know plan half dose first shot? 'branch' trial got 90% effective response. I'd assume - would also make vaccine go further. J&amp;J might one shot first phase III trial results due January positive.

Since J&amp;J vaccine one shot, think rolled even immediately even efficacy around Oxford's 62% Well Germany 32% said definitely get vaccinated 35% said probably get vaccinated. 1/3rd population not. Idiots everywhere, US. louder. 90% dosage error half+full 62% full+full. Half+full 55s part trial even though response could older people evidence.

Realistically would better half+full approved (fewer side effects reported, likely better protection) even full+full amazing, low-cost, logistically simple vaccine prevents serious disease.

Also, AZ/Oxford UK trials swab tested everyone weekly detected asymptomatic cases. Pfizer, Moderna tested symptoms. Trust science. weird virus spreads human human could infect younger ones.

This dumbest crap. COURSE, MORONS.
They mouths, noses, lungs they?

People getting sick minks covid going tell another person (same species) isnt likely spread? Please. *this* problem us considered essential. I‚Äôm truly sorry. almost got fight recently muslim family member asked babies die since he's strict happens God, knows, questioned

But vaccine alright guess. Smoking too. designer clothing must. gods will. Twisting turning benefit themselves.

But possibly take anyway, since *everything* conspiracy west get muslims, really tiring tbh gives fuck race ffs *government* thinks begin vaccinating general public within third quarter next year. independent experts (including Christian Drosten) also think pandemic end sometime next year.

Nobody really knows think anymore. do. also counts. Two things count time. We're still kids 34? I'm 29 already feel old. Yeah, probably Germany American manufacturing/research/etc. generally thought highly suspect low quality. Well people following news religiosly knew change ""let schools stay open"" shift parents accept pandemic comply rules keeping economy somewhat running rather suggested kids don¬¥t spread it. weeks total lockdown including schools, parents children huge problems oging work child needed supervision. Leading comply many rules cause blaming govt rules problems.  (Keep mind that's BILD, quality questionable.) I‚Äôm confident explored route, thank playing smarter entire medical field, literally one done anywhere due risks involved. Tegnell's offense trust something based involved, something science, that‚Äôs kind stupid lol

Yep, numbers lie. Statistics show there's 50% chance true. Either two different vaccines. Germans involved top program Muslim immigrants, American program, followed days Germans', black woman top level. Guess 30-40% population likely refuse vaccines. understand that, I‚Äôm saying first estimation September October like commenter said. Ditto Yes is. Would shocked year ago saw whole city people wearing mask everywhere? Yes. now, pandemic? No. normal. 

Still think crap?  worked warehouse? college education limited qualifications make 20 hour  normal mean virus eliminated (as Gates says), optimistic.

Good think even bother actually looking you. disease old fat. people near death anyway. waste time resources. cure far worse disease. happen title thread? tried searching ‚ÄúBirdflu‚Äù getting posts 4 years ago. fuck‚Äôs sake. mean ist *surprising,* really, sucks poor education gullibility hamstringing entire fucking world right now. damning faint praise 

I love phrase, thanks published article. supposed articulate .

I think problem! see people including experts quoted time no, often speak well Dr. Corbett, especially difficult subject. hard get right problem, concise precise (articulate), also come across caring warm (compassionate). Hell people saying call Fauci articulate would you? I'm like, no, wouldn't, isn't. article quoted from, basically said AA brother sister, Black woman worked vaccine trust it! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è mean guess tried lol german gov basically saying millions people continue suffer, mentally financially 2023 cant get supply vaccines they're upset people resisting day. 

Burn down. Amazing, isn‚Äôt it? dozens vaccines thousands researchers, turns researcher #238 team 8F SUPER IMPORTANT. she‚Äôs black!!!!!! Amazing journalism ABC, discovered minority capable decent scientific work, give guy Pulitzer already.  ones working specialized. different claim?

The ones working where? Sounds like making anectdotal claim particular workplace? ""there""? know several (reasonably) well paid specialist ICU nurses working ICU wards. equally different claim?

This: ""Nope specialists"" interprested ""ICU nurse one specialist nurse types"". 

What seem mean ""ICU nurse specialist nurse type, least nurses working ICU wards ICU nurses"". 

That's different claim first interpretation (which interpretation formulation) think it‚Äôs better didn‚Äôt tell us. look happened toilet paper cleaning products. thing would happened masks. doctors nurses would even less had. smart part wait hospitals somewhat adequate supply general population panic bought rest dickheads turned around resold make profit. SUMMARY: ROME (Reuters) - Italy considering stringent nationwide coronavirus restrictions Christmas New Year holidays concerns rise possible spike infections January. government could decide put country so-called ‚Äúred-zone‚Äù lockdown rules Dec. 24 least Jan. 2, extending night curfews, banning non-essential movement closing shops, bars restaurants weekends holidays, exception selling essential goods, Italian media reported. ‚ÄúThe crowds unjustifiable, irrational, irresponsible,‚Äù Regional Affairs minister Francesco Boccia told Italian daily la Repubblica. Earlier month, government approved rules avoid surge infections Christmas New Year, banning midnight mass halting movement towns.. Go look infection rates UK summer. 


That got delayed, majority trials taking place there. 


Incidentally that's ones early trials US (like Pfizer Moderna) got boost reported earlier, infection rates summer also recently US higher. comments true. I've never met ICU nurse sweden ICU nurse specialist, far know ICU nurses deceny pay work lot evenings nights. Turks dude lmao getting mad that? [Covid-19: Trump rejects plan early vaccines White really don‚Äôt understand Americans obsessed race.

Not Americans. racist woke‚Ñ¢ kind obsessed race want anymore.

jk, know really part Ok, understand mean now. time people say death rate mean amount deaths per capita. case fatality rate. order case fatality relevant comparison countries needs test find amount positive people. obviously dont. 

Youre original comment could interpretated people dying Covid Sweden US, thats case. likely die Covid US. healthcare, either get vaccine lose job putting patients risk. knew roadside pani-puri eating would come handy someday.

No srsly tho,While completely agree OP saying.He point.There multiple articles studies indicating spread might way could imagined(15 16 times higher confirmed) basically means half India already gotten infected.Scary,I know. Imagine downright stupid brainwashed cult believes magical sky wizard exists reject real life, facts, logic.

Religion, it, bigger pandemic COVID.

Good first step realizing literally none real people dumb af. like jackasses going catholic, jewish, hate club meetings weekend ""mY reLiGiOus FrEeDoMZz' 'smart' answer would say 'yes okay society built around idea kids school, global pandemic maybe way built society needs radically change get figured out'.

This I've arguing seems like 250 years.

Yes, stuff USED WORK certain way. we're going something neither parents grandparents gone (well, depending age). Extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary solutions/measures.

Yes, we'll lose something. taken year - sort of. knew vaccine would likely come 2021, could treated 2020 ""off"" year, try get pandemic scars possible society.

If means agreeing kids repeat school year, fine. Sacrifice year. Everyone gets affected way, nobody gets advantage gets left behind. 

Then try see help people struggle, try see get people safely work, use improve certain aspects/systems etc educate people disease/viruses/germs spread.

Normalizing masks might curbed spread flu common colds later on, example. 

Of course, none could achieved long thing driving society governments profits corporations. Yes. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  10 days also average incubation time virus? iirc counted symptomatic cases wonder relationship (ie earlier cases caught vaccination, protecting earlier 10 days possibly graph correct that) Read post history... really I'm saying tbh. fine point team members played key role, US seems obsessed finding one idol stick late night talk shows brandish ""the hero"". gross Austria exited last week ""hard"" lockdown, put context, incidence Germany entering it.

I see going well Xmas. find pattern often media tries single exemplary people great work gender race. 

People start understand things team efforts, teams deserve praise, individuals. saying sentiment many within black community?  ones working specialized. different claim?

Those specialized work TICU. ones dedicated enough take assfuck get region regarding wages work hours. actually think better kids spend least part day group children, learning, playing, interacting together. 

I think healthier physically mentally. 

I pretty sure also closer species evolved (it takes village raise child).

I strongly believe home schooling overall detrimental children. big part allows crazy parents imprint crazy ideas kids expose kids ideas, people, view points. wonder what's correlation home schooling unable accept viewpoints.

The problem comes system used get parents work 24/7. Instead something helps parents children, used milk parents corporations.

I think best could still kids interact smaller groups, reduce risks transmitting virus, countries use taxes people pay give something back instead continuing give free shit corporations. like everywhere else, people care care. Many take serious would go shopping like that, others care all. clear change behaviour looking mobility data, travelling data restaurants close due lack customers. Still, crowding indeed problem.

And first wave peaked two-three months summer, think lot people still spending time indoors back then. summer definitely sped decline.

But yeah, acting slow second wave one biggest fuck-ups. happen?

One central issue FHM counted second wave extent. see possibility, thought would smaller, local outbreaks. models flawed, probably put much confidence population umminuty.

Combine issue FHM overly optimistic. always hoping best never preparing worst. exactly prepared handle second wave, ignoring early warning signs. 

There increasingly restrictions now, spring, coming late may still enough. Seasonality may much larger factor previously thought, would require much stricter restrictions previously.

The government put lot trust FHM pandemic mostly done exactly recommended. problem FHM sadly seem competent. RIP üôè Omg! Source? terrible! hope Germany gets act together. second wave bad enough... need say African American?  considered dating Black girl once! racist????? Australia mess aged care though something worry about? thread r/worldnews full-on catastrophic mode. Ok and? What's new this? Women scientists new? Yeah bit odd... Also Biontech/Pfizer vaccine constantly called Pfizer vaccine... Clearly Pfizer part like non-US half (the half actually developed groundbreaking vaccine) left out. That's completely different claim "" Nope, specialists ""

That's like saying ""Teachers trained teachers"" lot teachers aren't. Almost every day, seems like various leaders country come new ways put us higher risk. hope recipients listen professionals. two dose vaccine inherently great always dropouts along way.  Small gatherings, assuming everyone vaccinated, safe ever be. Outdoor dining outdoor bars back, far less stigmatizing decide go one. return office work likely done time. indoor things large gatherings- it‚Äôll depend region region US. Expect vaccination presentation proof feature areas currently restricted. idea getting downvoted. People see insults everything.

I tell this, someone grew around Turks errr Belgians. Turkish call Turkish. Got lot Turkish friends probably proudest culture people I‚Äôve met. Turkish movies, Turkish music, Turkish everything. even vote country living here. don‚Äôt mind much, guy seeing insult I‚Äôm pretty sure vast majority Turkish (or Turkish-Germans) wouldnt even care.

You never called ‚Äújust‚Äù Turks either. come immigrant family honestly wouldnt give single fuck people call Spanish Belgian. never saw felt intent act offensive post. Salty people. That's like saying we'd world peace stopped violent. 

Humans programmed group other, although avoid bigoted, ignoring differences increbly idealistic. ‚ÄúAfrican American,‚Äù perfectly normal.

‚ÄúTurks descendants Turkish immigrants,‚Äù actually really insulting.

Vaccines understand. stuff much. don‚Äôt Facebook. post link? They‚Äôre probably looking words starting F..... Bot. unfortunately, fake vaccination cards response response. vaccines proven safe children yet? unfortunate companies reasonable. previous job wanted come office zoom meeting coworker 6 feet apart wearing masks room. changed jobs.

Some businesses adapt better others. left behind. testing kids weekly? Every single one despite symptoms not? another user posted, 195k October 1918, averaging 6k day much smaller population base. 

Covid bad enough is, there‚Äôs reason make things up. FDA report. Pretty typical South African responses public health problems honestly problem didn‚Äôt test vaccine children trials, it‚Äôs approved 16+ US. sure countries. best part waking up...is covid cup Im oregon too. Weve lot cases recently Protective immunity would antibodies. cells respond already infected cells. case SARS-CoV-2, downregulates ACE2 rapid viral seeding basically explosion immune responses. unlikely cells alone would able clear infection given stealth nature virus seeding period basically days. Trying kill many possible. CNN must true. anyone believes anything dipshit says they‚Äôre risking lives Oh great another excuse wackos avoid getting vaccinated would anybody listen idiot point?  I'm guessing 29!

After all, average class size 26.4 NYC teacher (so 27.4 28 humans) clearly 28 fine..../s  seen world easily physical distancing seems abandoned 

not 2 sentences use since early pandemic, crucially physical distancing hand hygiene, must continue indefinitely.

galaxy brain want know many even bother. caught now?

I can't afford get tested, wonder much cost get vaccine. vaccine maybe free, see healh care center tacking $300 handling fee. do, many families exist 0 alternatives unfortunately. influenza vaccine average efficacy 45%. Even Oxford vaccine low end range ‚Äì 62% ‚Äì that's probably enough. easier produce, store, transport, means needed enough vaccines States bad, unless company you. employers feel like need everyone office job, required you.  Site seems unfortunately. Probably unable take load... played sports *I know gal little prick Kalamazoo...

Gives little stick, won‚Äôt get sick Kalamazoo....* sure was.

Which means difference Spanish flu covid even bigger death numbers suggest. Covid mostly kills people already lived lives, whereas Spanish flu (just like war) killed people whole lives ahead them.

In terms actual years life lost, Spanish flu probably couple dozen times worse. percentage US population age 65 \~15%. That's 50M people. sure many healthcare workers US significantly lower additional 50M. yes, dad eligible soon. zombie horror fiction novels start... idiot ! You‚Äôre average troll, I‚Äôll give that. 

Also life close controlled guys business closed... live Florida people something really weird, make decisions without government deciding stay open close. they're giving away O2 bottles? people want believe sending children school safe. want believe represents bias obvious fact children major spreaders. Either position requires scientific evidence.

But worst bias *vaccinating* children. Nearly everyone says low supplies vaccine given risk -- elderly. I've argued children vaccinated early efficient safe vaccinate entire schools individuals pharmacies. article shows yet another reason prioritize vaccinating children -- major spreaders.

But suggest prioritizing children (and teachers course), people claim either opinions first paragraph act murdering old people. Everyone loves call everyone else biased, nearly everyone fact biased. Somehow scientists said ""kids less likely get/spread virus"" politicians heard ""kids get/spread virus"". Even less likely get transmit virus they're still ideal circumstances major source spread. Yeah lifestyle mentally draining, exhausting awkward. It‚Äôs sustainable nobody happy it. I‚Äôm sure anyone thought realistic length time. Sniff. Sniff. Wish could cheer well. great day alive.  New York added 11k cases today. Where's article that? Florida hate sub joke Same. Duval run mill corrupt Republicans. pleasantly surprised went blue year. Especially considering side effects first dose.  4 year old problem wearing school anywhere else, pretty inattentive sliding around. takes eat, going remember put back on.

And social distancing going maintained. harder part.

Fortunately, things exploded yet MA, winter barely started. Yes study properly monitoring let's say 20000 people recovered COVID vs 20000 people haven't, check level protection would helped. 

Anyway denied outright, said lot times 'there proof' getting COVID protects reinfection, people got act policy based (e.g. immunity passports). suspect strong political motivation statements, still make hard use way postpone vaccination already covid. probably downvoted two reasons. first said something made lot people feel bad. think pointing flaws article bottlenecks relief effort result downvotes, get some.

The second reason probably main one wagering something sensitive nature. bad dead pool anything, rub people wrong way. It‚Äôs true Tuskegee study nothing vaccinations, negative legacy study many black community still harbor mistrust people medicine science. Crazy part footage people suffering severe COVID shown anti maskers, would still come statement deflecting footage say something like ""I bet there's people dying something else y'all pegged another COVID death."" you‚Äôre low enough risk factor scale wouldn‚Äôt get June, means you‚Äôre low enough risk you‚Äôre going drop dead get covid. Even country government tells people live virus (accept new norm) opens business. Yeah, obviously im petty technical. wear n95, cloth that, goggles, hat. Kids seen face months.

Never take except lunch break sitting trunk car.

All coworkers around take minute kids leave room start eating lunch right classroom. Boggles mind. parents dinner. opened windows downstairs, ran ceiling fan, three HEPA air purifiers room. One Dyson two germ guardians uV C light.  incredibly excited getting first dose vaccine weeks! I've hardly seen parents 9 months get vaccinated I'll feel way comfortable going see them. really really really want give mom long hug. try avoid getting sick weeks +28 days. Spanish flu especially rough young healthy people. virus barely spreads harm select few, major threat healthcare system? Newark NJ started ‚Äònight school‚Äô help parents school timing issues. course is. believe post suggested otherwise. much possibly try go odd hours there‚Äôs less people. think that‚Äôs extremely important thing control, people forget. Obviously you‚Äôre busy, hard hell.
Another thing could would loading laundry, going car waiting there. soon community spread slows I'm vaccinated, gladly go back shopping store, complain office, see friends masked. It'll take bit longer feel comfortable restaurant, hosting dinner party, etc. They're 39 now, death rate. they're 13th new cases per capita. Damn!

It's clear issue people wearing masks, people gathering private. someone gets here, assumption stupid. friend got week hit DEFINITELY was. Who? Wait. What? miss something? asleep box. effective rate way lower Moderna Pifer. care race is? would guess not, ""adjuvants"" vaccines (not sure Pfizer Moderna) enhance immune response. Given part problem covid immune response getting control, might best idea enhance response. Stop it. He's already dead. /s working home. Would rather stay working home ends go back office?

I'm voting WFM. Indefinitely. Keep shilling Ruskie. super sad long term side effects gonna wreck people, theyre chasing people need care away. Japan elementary middle schools opened back August open since. Yet main driver infection seem small bars restaurants. wonder difference is? School buses, here? good article Dr Kariko.

She get Nobel Prize next year. think better way weigh risk say 0.03% mortality rate rather consider this: would walk building 999 people knowing 3 nkt walk alive? Would let anyone family walk building? suspect not.

Edit; wait since mortality rate 0.03% 50? Sorry math missing 9 that‚Äôs case. Cause thought 0.1% - 0.3% insulting children. children would thay. Good something control over. Hang there. flying window becomes projectile harm others land knows what. seatbelt much like mask. Wait since 300m doses? impression 100 million. something worked out? 

But still, almost every developed nation wanted excess least 50% population case trial hold ups, flukes, distribution problems, importantly redistribution. words, we‚Äôre taking many vaccines possibly regardless efficacy (assuming it‚Äôs 50%) stopped safe distance visiting friends think fine remove masks since outside (but 6' apart...). tolerance mamby-pamby gesture wearing mask butnot actual safety! Fair riddance, least vaccinated. 23 percent households 1 parent. don‚Äôt see would work mom dad go work. You‚Äôre also missing social development right still think important. wish transparent science convincing enough, people. Many patients make decision based worldview science described doctor. Therefore, using examples diverse set celebrity leaders enthusiastically welcome take vaccine treatments part education program roll vaccine talk advancement treat prevent COVID. Ummmm duh? see infants spreading germs sickness daycare worker. Reinfections staggeringly rare. vaccine generates immunity comparable wild infections.

These two things together make unlikely could spread it.

In meantime, wear mask socially distance. Get shots.  think accidentally stepped it. course mean harm, one things black people hear lot, heard 12th time white person start see pattern. ""Articulate"" particular probably common word used way meant well, also painful hear. Chris Rock bit Colin Powell regarding this.

It frustrating give someone compliment realize sound way them. think black people cut us lot slack things say, understand, one times embarrassed, recognize inadvertently said thing sound like compliment everybody, specific reason.

I went wedding black female officiant. great job, type PUBLIC SPEAKING. less three people spoke wedding mentioned ""articulate"" was. admit, ""wow, guess... really thing."" guests nice people, see maybe would chosen word describe white man, example, assumed part job. 

You may word person picked clear concise was. way know would probably listen white man speak, ask would use words, learning experiment without judgement. can't hard step it, able hear voices side give us good information. Good luck sorry long got many downvotes, journey.

That's exactly he's doing. referred second dose ""Booster shot"", clearly not.

As for: ""The article also says Florida allocating vaccine per capita basis, even make sense gives idea bright author is. ""

The article says: "" Instead, government allocating vaccination per capita basis, **DeSantis said.** "" Less profit, pay. Next week: hold beer reminds telling us masks might effective (and might cause harm good etc). wanted first responders healthcare workers masks. But, lied treated us like morons instead telling us truth. backlog 13,000 cases Ohio built since early November. released day past week state changed reporting protocol eliminate double-checking antigen tests. article make clear included week‚Äôs count, appears were. numbers admittedly terrible, would make percentage appear even worse really is. state said eventually report 13,000 adjusted back original dates.

At least understanding I‚Äôve trying follow state reporting closely. recommend DeSantis take doses Covid vaccine well-known hoaxes. say quality *and* availability.

We 300M doses committed Pfizer/Moderna cover 150M people. Comes pretty close covering everyone take account approval 18 ~40% interested vaccine. think panic might appropriate here, now. unlikely.

We know re-infections exceedingly rare. know vaccine generates immunity comparable wild infections. number misleading. It‚Äôs bad, Ohio reported back log 12k positives last week rapid tests Ohio rechecking them. represented tests beginning first week November. Based journalists math, doesn‚Äôt look like removed proper week. No. lot common think. problem don‚Äôt supply second dose way fucked up.  get perspective, aren‚Äôt opening anyway enough people get fully vaccinated I‚Äôd rather get full vaccine vaccine light.

Thousands alive next year decision. 



I really, really sorry many businesses going close mental health harmed. also bittersweet way, really glad see governors make hard choices. I'm wondering better option?

We know better option: Subsidized lockdowns last resort. Masks first bare minimum choice. one Greedy Old Pig faction chose minimize virus, politicize virus, throw us false choice reopening v. evil socialism. considering hospitals full , anything happens, want there? Judging last one, first step run buy toilet paper find. vote out, like did... Yes. You‚Äôre alive!!! Moderna reviewed week later US hardly much longer. probably want review 2 meeting probably closest schedule another meeting giving time prep between. AstraZeneca taking longer clearly made massive errors handling trial like group got half dose. mean science need sort shit make huge step applying approval. Getting denied would probably kill vaccine get data make clearer, better picture applying need that. One thing remember universal health systems funded increasing neoliberal economies promotes austerity(for masses) privatization services industry. means health systems stretched thin fragile. believe lockdowns primarily motivated fear health systems failing. risk think governments would take higher death rates functioning economy.

But no, medical debt risk people's financial futures various ways even get stimulus money.

It better situation working class American. Yes. fall pandemic yet realized full. they'll able change individually. 

In words, young healthy get first vaccination on, let's say, February 1, still need wear mask get second vaccination, let's say February 10. that, probably another week two full effect take hold. that, hospitalizations down, free stop wearing mask. sort comment seen met upvotes like yours, tons downvotes. I'm saying wrong, strange way try tack value someone's life based solely age. comes cold guess responses vary much. Never said did...  curious, would getting ASAP? healthcare professional long term nursing home, curious notified scheduled it? $1,800 mortgage laughs $1,200 stimulus. 30 mcg nucleosidemodified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding viral spike (S) glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2.

That's probably one people worried Pfizer vaccine, rest it. FFS. Blaming sides effectively blames side. 

We need call far worse offenders. current faction absolutely obsessed attacking social services, shaming, dismantling welfare state. 


They pandemic terrible handling Im dead.  Moderna slight delay submission believe. timeline approval US little 10 days post Pfizer's approval. far know, tracks timeline submission data. know! need use Police stop crazies parties dangerous things endanger society!

I personally hope really start cracking alcohol consumption. Think lives saved, suicides avoided, domestic violence prevented, mention enormous cost health. big chunk Americans would significantly healthier drink. pay price choices.

Who think are? safety steps skipped vaccine development covid vaccine. vaccines proven effective, nothing anti-vax rant disproves that. oh comment really give vibe. people historical reasons mistrust medical community. People say herd immunity dumb, work, optimal solution Hundreds thousands people across several countries already vaccinated trials new vaccines, included tracker. Unless new general public vaccinations. Dutchman working home, also say fucking time.

Also thank work healthcare. guys heroes! 3rd time Sputnik V released results. first release had¬†20 cases, second release 39 cases, third release 78 cases. Effectiveness 91%-92% each, increasingly confident time cases recorded.

Also want say, Moderna's first vaccine submit approval. AZ's core business vaccine, new them. all, progress amazing small miracle. Pretty short article save click...

""BERLIN (Reuters) - Moderna expects European Union approve COVID-19 vaccine candidate mid-January ready start distribution immediately afterwards, head European division told German daily Stuttgarter Zeitung.

Also, worry human error medical malpractice ( one largest causes death) . also worry things like blanket immunity vaccine makers people die them. things worry you? Science always changing new info could come day take vaccine saying ACTUALLY dangerous......that science is. believe trust science.....which makes question vaccine..... Almost vaccines history caused complications 6 weeks, people vaccine lot longer. Tens thousands people. 

It's okay question, good faith open mind willing accept new information. 

The risk vaccine empirically lower risk getting COVID, pretty much human adult. still worried, sure hell hope get flu shot either developed quickly year year technically know long term effects new rendition flu vaccine. understand mechanics that's enough. saves lives, nobody develops third arm randomly. U.S. surpassed once-unthinkable threshold 300,000 COVID-19 deaths Monday, according NBC News tally.

I‚Äôm happy there‚Äôs vaccine, it‚Äôs depressing see death toll reach numbers considered exaggerated That's kind you, thanks! :) Australia hopeful opening countries like Japan well, think need better quarantine facilities. sure wash hands hands study. clear pulled from. Case numbers, absolutely. manage vaccinate 65 70+ population end January, daily deaths take noticeable nose dive roughly one month later.

EDIT: makes sound like everyone would getting vaccine once, course gradual drop nose dive. incorrect. Let come anecdotes knowing science literally everyone know got infected, got infected child. Including wife, 3 families + grandparents. understand idea children negligible effect came parent, never sounded reasonable me. Historically religion bad record. I'm getting close enough neighbors that. One advantages owning lot land leave it. Covid = spending 3 months ventilator, life long breathing problems, already 300k deaths even though technologies healthcare improved 1000x since 1918. yeah deadly üôÑ oh boy discussion thread can't wait important remember AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN, clear enough. Imagine believing fairy tale adult. Imagine stupid gullible think sky wizard exists. Imagine. Dont forget pack body bag there's probably shortage Florida? call scarf? Yes worth risk. stupid. they? Fauci forum hosted National Urban League asked role African Americans development vaccine. Black person asked him.

Do think gone rant race matter instead actually answering question respectfully?

Whether answer newsworthy different matter. That's point comparison, virus vs. virus disaster vs. disaster. Covid nearly bad spanish flu. REAL. human dumb enough believe magical sky wizard, literally fairy tale, devote entire life bright.

What religion done historically? Mass murder, mass oppression, barbaric archaic thinking ""my fairy tale book fairy tale book"".  insane! idea happened. absolutely worse spanish flu. Considering 102 years, modern medicine like 150-200 years back then... we're still 300k already?

""If talk it, exists"", Morgan Freeman racism. skin color matter?

""Kizzmekia Corbett praised key scientist behind COVID-19 vaccine"".

What put ""a caucasian woman""? ""A Hispanic woman""? ""an Asian woman""? Would matter? No. leave race it. 

She smart provided major contribution towards vaccine world desperate find, enough. 

Grow America, stop seeing world skin-tones headline-worthy facet person. over. Loose everything. Well, said pretty early strategy wait see. proof vaccine accomplish?
Unless ive completely mis understood, current pfizer vaccine doesnt prevent virus contracted, supresses symptoms risk hospitilization long term effects next ro none?

You still carry virus assymptomatic. even proof vaccinationation, still bring virus country put vaccinated risk.

That aimed risk groups first?

Again, may completely mis read vaccine aimed at. Happy corrected. Moderna vaccine still option order additional 300 million doses though. think fears surrounding vaccine shortages maybe bit dramatized honestly Moderna one approved think we'll much better position. isn‚Äôt century ago, world leaders innovation aren‚Äôt teams full white men. interesting see deployed one CCA facilities. husband kidney transplant released h1n1 vaccine 2009 notified transplant clinic get vaccine. assume whoever manages chronic conditions send letter patients.

Anyways % immigrants whole population Sweden lands middle: DEN-SWE-BEL 13,7%-19,1%-24,8%.

In urbanization Sweden Denmark 88% Belgium teleport Singapore? Avian Influenza high mortality 60% humans, contagious, transmitted via faecal oral risk human human transmission low. recall less 5 reported cases human human transmission throughout history.

It's spread via fecal/oral route...for now. takes one mutation HA allow binding alpha(2,6) linked sialic acids alpha(2,3) becomes respiratory pathogen. Alpha(2,3) found gut. Alpha(2,6) found lung humans. happen recombination another species infected another strain influenza (usually pig) possibly human that's infected another strain. occurs, efficient human human transmission possible. happened before...1957‚Äì1958 influenza pandemic caused avian influenza recombined human influenza. Basically ""I shot him"" vs ""I shot self defense"".

That choose, rather think two plausible considering constitution allow draconian lockdown (first), community spread wide slow get test capacity TTi March (second). think could eliminate two first options looks kind right looking around world. Unreadable paywalled shit - remain ignorant something actually published isn't. shares pretty large land border Ireland. actually one controversial issues brexit. Sure find study that‚Äôs says even vaccine. We‚Äôre testing didn‚Äôt capacity test more.

if case would see positive test rate percentage falling number tests grew. case. I'm seeing anywhere we've shortage tests. Two weeks ago teacher kids school sick able get tested get result within 24 hours. Back August got tested result within 48 hours, I'm kind essential worker. sound like capacity issues me. Shut her?

Your odds pretty good getting March. Jeez early thought Assn. short ""assassin"" like ""woah country music way brutal thought"" knew back Jan. Asian countries shut children one last groups transition remote learning back classroom settings.


Yet are, acting surprised. Yes acting. lying. people NC idiots government even worse crisis week ago Dutch complaining Belgians shopping there. Since shops closed Belgium Netherlands. Belgium re-opened shops week, expect complaints coming week Belgium. 

We need cohesion Europe. believe submitted India UK USA haven‚Äôt following closely approvals countries. Masks great keeping face warm winter.. outdoor mask ear muffs.. wintery snuggly warm viral protection great bonus. 

In UK average person recorded cctv approx 66 times day... I'm happy bit mask anomity go daily life... people moaning masks taking away liberties really understand irony disease isn‚Äôt virus anymore. She‚Äôs cleared virus months ago. immune response virus secondary infections.  Fauci et al literally told us last week ""The Science says schools safe children spreading virus"". promptly blamed Trump trying force schools open August reason nobody trusts schools, virus real. USA Britain promote vaccine it‚Äôs good. Russia it‚Äôs disinformation would say fake. Hospitals dealing deniers trying barge see ""empty icus"" themselves. Seriously, people hearing they'd like hear. tracks PEOPLE spread virus LOL. Taiwan population 24 million total 7 covid deaths far. I'm pretty sure that's close winning get. economy also better due reverse brain drain. Ok eat them.  Slightly worse since actively masks. Well test much adults would ever come conclusion spread much adults? Also reason tested much remain asymptomatic often. contact tracing kids school must nightmare. point immunity unknown uncertain enough creating priorities based previous infection create huge mess people would start demanding ‚Äúwell people first instead‚Äù. It‚Äôs easier stick healthcare workers essential workers everyone else. Personally, I‚Äôd prefer minority groups would get priority alongside essential workers again, would create mess.  time BAN children. Trust me, local governmemts problem telling bars can't sell cold beer grown adults age 21 wrong time day. time bars shut down. Local governments problem telling local stores sell beer, wine, stores sell harder liquor.


So Florida problem telling businesses grown adults jurisdiction what, conduct legal businesses. Based think force adults behave society.


And yet still seem upset business way side country, whose laws rules little say in.


So sad. cool, thank you. read later. read yesterday german wikipedia surprised find SARS-COV1 also overdispersion. still dont know is, behavior genetics ever. Sweet long time ago. shit happen nowadays. anyone doubting modern vaccines, extremely stupid many blunders.
January: 
Human human transmission unlikely.
(Truth: human human transmission evident virus spreading 5 times faster flu, Tawian tried warn world ignored silenced WHO).
March:
Masks necessary. 
(Truth: Masks mandatory immediately, Taiwan stepped mask production January, making one mask per person per day. reduced cost mask $0.20. eliminated disease April 500 total cases 7 total deaths. Masks needed Wuhan New Zealand anymore virus eliminated there, mandatory public transport)

Asymptomatic people spread disease. Changed pre-symptomatic, caused mass confusion. 
(Truth: asymptomatic spread key driver community spread main reason virus big problem)
Lockdowns 'last resort' must avoided 'damage economy'.
(Truth: lock downs first resort demonstrated New Zealand, strong, early lock regional eliminate community spread matter weeks. Wuhan Melbourne proper lockdowns eliminated disease 76 100 days respectively) 
Forget elimination eradication, ""curve must flattened"".
(Truth: Taiwan 76 deaths SARS 7 deaths covid19. disease eliminated Taiwan, China, New Zealand, Australia Vietnam. always risk form imported cases elimination real possibility proper response. ""Curve flattening"" ""herd immunity"" phrases literally killed million people)
August:
Do worry disinfecting surfaces groceries, primary means transmission.
(Truth: saying ""don't wash hands"". make sense, studies form Australia show virus live surfaces 26 days. easily destroyed soap alcohol. )
December:
Children spread disease, keep schools open rampant community spread.
(Truth: Children asymptomatic super spreaders. Australia, Wuhan New Zealand closed school immediately elimination effort. effective lock downs resulted eradication disease)

Take mandatory forced, rushed vaccine, solution...
(Truth...) correct. 52% number refers 10-day ramp period well. subtract period, well 52%. One shot straight brain effect. Scientists focus barn doors clues prevent next horse escape everyone else limit outings necessary.

Also, NSFW 1) take vaccine, May side effects.

2) get Covid, May kill you, horrible side effects.

I‚Äôll take 1. coverage pandemic pretty subpar. ESPECIALLY around vaccines. Maybe get Secret Service too. know like hundred infected point. crazy. Yeah PPE isn‚Äôt 100% lot nurses don‚Äôt even access proper ppe pushed back projections month. seriously expect vaccine mid 2021 start pandemic, we're gonna pretty much done immunizations then. Incredible. Source 100M? staggering. Assuming 1 shot 60% effective - would imagine authorize nature emergency. yes sadly. I‚Äôd argue others like trump, gaetz, graham could rival title. üòÅ made cry. Spiegel article discusses number studies analyses around world, including several explicit examples kids daycares classroom catching Covid many infecting families. Burden proof you. provide evidence said tweet existed, delete comments donate $100 Malaria Foundation. restrictions eased prematurely. Cases can't go back infections gone everyone infected quarantine. PeoplE uSe GreAT bRitish CommOn seNse taKe peRsoNal ResponsBility. crediting political administration work scientists vaccine manufacturers (who even funded said administration)? Misery people free die though. there's that. Recognized whom? realize single definition socio-political term, right? 

Or saying point every single fascist leader gathered said ""yup, 14 traits belong club.""

Ask 100 scholars, historians political scientists define fascism one give different definition based expertise, research personal biases. people enjoy social interaction coworkers?

My coworkers fine. actual friends family working home allowed flexibility present - even virtually. WFH non-COVID times would even better like routine leaving house?

I particularly like commuting 2 hours day, no. also feel like need job excuse leave house either. like walks park, hanging aforementioned family friends, eating restaurants, going drinks... things nothing going work. everyone enjoying interact humans unless it‚Äôs technology? 

I like interacting people. Work nexus social life WFH would mean would occupy much smaller percentage time per week. Ymmv that's fine weird paint people like flexibility wfh asocial weirdos reason. Black girl magic supreme right I'm sure Germans feel sorry too. Living state governor country president, give shit die. care, pretty much tells people guy get him. got good dozen people sick addition. He's shitbag anyway. Americans deny everything uncomfortable. literally invent entirely new realities avoid facing uncomfortable truths.

Never seen nation constantly gaslights like one does. majority vaccination going see sorts pressure proof vaccination/immunity attend events. TIL Swedes turn crybabies criticise I'll mixing up. I've got office setup home certainly taking advantage, also collaborative things efficient face face. value serendipity. Meeting people water cooler actually valuable important. FHM still lying sadly. They're like flat earthers asking evidence keep disproved. 

Very strange. come scared bureaucrats authoritarian country. could never admit fault would punished. ever read new york post?  issue's determining sentiment articles towards specific concepts. issue determining given article influences people's real-world decisions, leading deaths. possible calculate.  one times completely understand folks coming from, trust built here, even african americans going die---which horrible Absolutely! think alot data studies come accidentally getting it. ü§£ 

I've seen positive things pregnant women COVID babies getting antibodies well born! 

So much unknown, hopefully next months alot questions get answers! WTF? hell told that?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: NM, see quoting wall street journal article; understand it. Dammit Randy. always conservative ploy. film sets i've hearing taking seriously operating safely. referring african americans? Every single person know enthusiastically wants bad boy saying accept idea. never heard one dose idea before, think best course action, headline makes seems like DeSantis made thin air, true. Coxsackievirus (hand, foot mouth) pretty unpleasant. toddler gave couple years ago got gums made painful chew week. Nothing life threatening permanent though. Well UK Seems like we're going stuck dealing crap foreseeable future. want convince Black Americans take vaccine, start running stories wealthy elites, celebrities politicians secretly cutting line take it. Black Americans think they're used test subjects rich. Idiocy open schools pandemic all. Well, guess children human they're surely never maskless close contact adult enclosed room parents home... oh... correct, seem case. 

That significantly changes calculation makes seem less like good tactic. Worth mentioning, working ICU far worst payed nursing job Sweden. Switching nursing homes run municipalities private health care pay increase 50-100%. normal ""24 Hour Flu"" contagious less day. COVID contagious week more. Combine fact COVID virus ""more hardy"" flu seems able survive linger longer we're talking virus that's significantly transmiable flu. Correct. Calling someone articulate *is* noteworthy, people predominantly aren't. nothing race.  I'm Australian. death rate 3% found way nursing homes high risk populations known higher mortality rates general population. Ego. reinforces important unions are. like, care taken all? feeling suck though ""card life"" remember feeling way March. gratitude MP locked boarders took lot flack MP's community transmission free 80+ days.

I know. Good either way. Reports say actual delivery path traveling US en route Canada though. Considering US confiscated PPE early pandemic, unreasonable worried may try pull stunt immediate family good! Hope you‚Äôre alright thanks asking. Merry holiday! Obituaries old fraud, Noone supposed care much. teacher believed one millisecond. encouraging see Pfizer candidates fell pregnant (even though weren‚Äôt supposed to) before/after injections fine. Fingers crossed proven safe used data becomes clear.

It‚Äôs true breastfeeding pregnant different. It‚Äôs conversation I‚Äôll doctor sure, everyone knows comfort level risk. Stay safe there! 6-7? That‚Äôs ridiculous. anything read reinfection data? six Covid-19 vaccines approved far, minimum 46 others still development worldwide. 

[Here nice Covid-19 vaccine tracker. I'd agree higher compliance adults, visited daughter's school parents observation day were...kids. Lots removing scratch, forgetting pull nose, kids hanging other's shoulders etc. still maybe better US? think even consider exposed COVID, wearing PPE. pays bloated bureaucratic admins, greedy teacher‚Äôs unions, ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù indoctrination. done enough damage... expensive India. mention cold chain issues, particularly difficult providing vaccine access people. 
 
Even gets EUA, think plan pfizer sell necessarily govt procure doses them. think hearts know significant number Americans ignorant world affairs, either completely trust America government best world ""freedom, guns ""choices"" healthcare."" distrusr anything government bad, inefficient communism. question regarding testing safety seeing higher risk family members Christmas. unable fully quarantine next Monday due work obligations. get tested Monday morning (12/20) get hopefully negative results Christmas Eve, would safe indoors family Christmas? couple family members higher risk categories I‚Äôd like stay safe side, however obviously want Christmas. supposed quarantine certain amount time test? insight greatly appreciated here. film industry's fault? y'all gotten bailed out. truly want Thank this.

Well fine one lost husband anyways. International flights pretty much go Auckland everything they've said done would combat strategy? 

Bullshit. example claim live someone covid-19, aware whether get symptoms entire incubation period (2-14 days, usually 5 days).  avoid close contact people incubation period. **If possible**, work so-called constitutional *General Councils* , recommended many possible work home autumn well. **Work home must chosen agreement employer business suffer negative effects.** employer, important work home carried work environment aspects mind.  met someone covid-19, work home **if possible**.

[Archived September 30, organisation telling us home common place people become infected, recently telling people lived confirmed COVID cases continue going school ""work home, possible"" long employer agrees suffer ""negative effects"".

The fact is, nothing FHM ever recommended designed stop spread infection. fact specifically chosen allow infection keep spreading, ""slow, controlled"" rate. History repeat itself, man tendency rhyme ran money months ago it‚Äôs terrible many people. Ya I'd say still wear mask time Wisconsin- almost one follows it‚Äôs enforced Nice propaganda vaccine.

How developing drugs covid like Poland? Monday tested Friday. heard one Tuesday daughter exposed testing parents tested positive. Good question. anything, I‚Äôd reckon it‚Äôs SG pretty recent thing (the internet) S‚Äôpore around ages. Local style guides haven‚Äôt changed suppose. ""i bought new pair shoes""

""Those new, ones store"" I'm sure varies district. know strict sick policy they've sent son home several times (even though he'd negative Covid test) nose still running. understanding vaccine sets unknowables verified useful researched one read overviews. know Pfizer stated cannot promise certain amount time effective.

They‚Äôve obviously made several wrong predictions there‚Äôs many ways could‚Äôve effective, I‚Äôm going assume body 300 specialists lying save face unless there‚Äôs proof. 
It would unprecedented Sweden - meanwhile plenty earlier examples gov bodies incompetent. Would antibody testing post vaccination thing people do? make sure? obese older family need protection vaccine offers. want make doubly sure they‚Äôre gonna ok. That's zombie minks Denmark right? telling kids killed anyone, that's fucked right. maybe that? that‚Äôs true Florida South Dakota completely collapsed now? They‚Äôve open months still don‚Äôt highest per capita death rate. that's read too. ones shipped around Belgium. I‚Äôm Phoenix, saw morning didn‚Äôt know felt angry sad. 

This sucks. ‚ÄúThose learn history doomed watch dont, make us repeat it‚Äù agree saying value life, irrespective occur, epidemics qualify. Scale important. methodology triage slight example. 

(Other note; belief linear day day actions effecting lives 100 years future? Asking struggle this.) assumption correct, (combination of) inhibitor(s) reverse transcription step HIV requires integrate genome cells'. small molecules work independent immune system entirely. also recall lot commotion around use Remdesivir CoV-2 - similar idea, block ability virus replicate genome (in case, inhibitor RNA dependent RNA polymerase, 'concept' generally)

The reason inhibitors great (in combination) hard virus mutate resistance multiple drugs targeting - targeting key step process. Same. Geez, ready give mankind, something like hits right damn feels. Good luck y'all Germany :) FDA approved Saturday. CDC approved Sunday. started shipping Sunday. there's vial ready use, used. 100,000 drivers country, 30,000 motor vehicle fatalities per year, wouldn‚Äôt think policy implications would bit different 30,000 motor vehicle fatalities per year 230,000,000 drivers? (Which case)

Yes percentages matter. Problem is, likely spread virus also likely refuse take vaccine. understanding phase 2 essential workers. guess it‚Äôs different different countries. *believed* similar (not same) first-grader's teacher actually emailed mask fits well, wanted know brand recommend parents.

(It's Rafi Nova kids performance mask) dense, NE common abbreviation New England referring region. total population NH 1.3 million compared 6.9 million MA. That's greater VT double much relevant comparison, considering NH come close rivaling population density statewide level. Fuck. right people always take easy way out. Ive talked quite people wont taking it.  dont even say anything, shake head move on.  1/4 doesnt shock me, although STAYS high Ill surprised Give people likely die people helping fight virus essential workers.

Read article commenting. specifically talking people *after* groups. got email back COVID Tracking Project said plan track vaccination numbers. ""If learn mistakes future we're doomed repeat first time.""

-KenM hundreds millions. One hundred million April. vaccine works matter like Moon mission, people call fake. smh Good god, proud anti masker. loser Disinformation. amazing many Sweden apologists repeat falsehood almost word word.

It's amazing even allowed spread lie here. rule. Yep. brother ED doc also working ICU. gets vaccine Thursday I‚Äôm relieved start seeing dent positive cases? reason diet they'll take diet pills. idiots among us protected herd immunity eventually. then, best avoid anyone know infected antivaxx koolaid poisoning. mean actions like telling people live infected people continue going work school?

Every action taken FHM pointed directly ""herd immunity"" strategy.  are. God, really hope so. system needs overhaul. FWIW headline wrong. 

We daily breakdown October, 1918, average 6,000 people died day flu. 

I say diminish what's going now. larger point fact headline true important. 

But I'd prefer leave misinformation side, here. I'm still waiting 18 weeks benefits paid me. sub permits negative covid anecdotes, positives ones. so, that's messed up. day first symptoms/tested positive? market give Hollywood decent revenue China.
India loves movies revenue big ,cause infrastructure problems plus huge local industry (which also suffering way). They‚Äôre lot state: Gov. Tony Evers announced indoor mask mandate people age 5, extended November 21. Face coverings indoors except private residence required since Aug. extended state's stay-at-home order May 26, May 13,

My gov support mask mandate stay home order. I‚Äôm really sure that. heard lot people considered ‚Äúnormal, rational‚Äù people saying want wait feel it‚Äôs rushed. Sometimes they‚Äôre open hearing facts, sometimes think anything made quick can‚Äôt right. dunno. hope you‚Äôre right. Ah yes History Channel old apartment WNY $600 month. water included. 2 bedroom upper. 1,000 sqft. street parking decent yard. bar show many vaccines administered vs many needed hit herd immunity.

This description bar showing percentage total population vaccinated. understanding takes two injections 3 weeks apart. people receiving initial injection today, first day vaccination complete 3 weeks today (in January).

I sure bad actors state government, even everyone good complicated report meaningful way. news me! Thank sharing, excited read that. effective, 90-95% effective translated 10 20 times harder catch covid, mean can't catch it. Also means less likely die hospitalized vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

The less well understood catch covid vaccine, still contagious, hence need wear mask social distance, others vaccinated yet supply issue last 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: also less fearful covid, still love neighbor community get yellow fever vaccine US FDA accepts trials happening US? can't mobilize second dose proper time table people

The chances happening slim none. I'm talking first wave couple million people here, 40 million doses way. will! Thank you! We're putting Governor's shit here! Agree this, whatever Pfizer wants going cost society less going even 1 week longer COVID concern needs to.

When print trillions routinely now, what‚Äôs extra billion two?  Personally think event Voyager first manmade object leave solar system greatest scientific thing lifetime, vaccination pretty great too. see full quote adds literally zero useful information sentence? think that‚Äôs fair assessment Oxford vaccine likely wouldn‚Äôt display much sterilizing immunity Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech. mean, Novavax animal trials showed infection upper lower respiratory tract challenged virus (if remember correctly), candidate seems likely show sterilizing immunity compared Oxford one infection still happened upper respiratory tract. Time tell suppose, seems like sterilizing vaccines coming next round approvals. I‚Äôll take it. got problem. city live, mayor rejects mask mandate. still get infected vaccine. don‚Äôt develop disease. government different. one expects federal government anything that‚Äôs design. parties spent decades attacking social services shaming people use them. front me. tbh, i'm tired feel like searching them. point flaw. look asymptomatic case, person could covid, aware carrying around one multiple latent issues heart organs now, lowering quality life. 

And, least UK, Canada countries ya'll paid. I've forced go work homeless, relief, stopping potential exposure. Lockdowns restrictions would short lived population would get sticks ass something around them. 

Hence, 2020 thrives. luck would it, bosses idiots. 

Good bad luck, decide. Completely context, funny people Korea freaking around 1000 cases per day right now. hope vegan though... it‚Äôs monday morning point, homeschooling isolating home safe option doesn‚Äôt involve getting COVID. It‚Äôs spreading like wildfire, however nice may kids play kids, it‚Äôs outweighed damage associated dead disabled parent. 

But normal times, think homeschoolers keep kids dark closets never let interact kids? I‚Äôm seeing lot covert racist comments thread want say this. don‚Äôt live America don‚Äôt know racial history don‚Äôt even bother commenting it, lot look ignorant misinformed. Identity Politics wouldn‚Äôt exist America‚Äôs politics weren‚Äôt creating tiered society based race. Americans ‚Äúrace obsessed‚Äù certain percentage nation always racial progress. conflict there, racial politics wouldn‚Äôt exist. No, doesn't. quoted still correct. number positive tests increased 27% tested 23,5% people. still increase 0,5%.

This also exactly type wording media referring to. use shocking statistics like ""27% increase!"" ""9000 cases!"" shouting tested 60.000 people. 27% increase wrong, mean 9000 people Covid, KNOW 9000 people Covid. 

Just imagine would test 17 million people Netherlands once. absolute number infections would skyrocket, percentage (currently 11,6%) would plummet. mean less people Covid currently are, would know them.

Thinking critically analysing texts statistics carefully important skill have. Really?! seriously didn‚Äôt go hospital accepted responsibility wearing masks, that‚Äôs completely honorable based.

ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY! that‚Äôs case, can‚Äôt read article don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs better idiots think it‚Äôs okay wear mask, get sick, go hospital. believe that, you‚Äôre asshole. yes.

in poland read want give perks vaccinated people make people get vaccine. one would wear mask, enter stores max occupancy reached, meet people 5 people per gathering limit.

that‚Äôs insanely dumb short sighted governments are. facts, dumb ideas. Imma honest here, idea lol study lot limited nuanced that. looking counties metropolitan areas, making urban/rural comparison people mind make statements. researchers also control lot factors many people assume part high population density life. Even though high population density may strongly correlated factors, making nonetheless accurate say virus spreads faster high population density areas, study designed look effects density isolation. perfectly sensible people, like authors, interested urban planning implications pandemic. results mean infections spread rapidly high density areas.

In Scotland, instance, substance abuse deaths risen third; British Liver Trust reported 500% rise calls helpline; 

In USA haven‚Äôt counting, people claim sorts things happening, deaths despair, considered conspiracy theorists. free everyone there? 
Singapore rich country excellent track record fighting covid... assumed tests free. all?? Jesus fucking christ.  all? think established quarter year ago somehow people refuse accept media refuses share it. Obviously geographic advantages northern NE. There's point comparing apples oranges. 

And Vermonter, less problem Sununu mask-hating Granite Staters community Facebook groups complaining rules *so unfair them!* They'll need many businesses survive. Well hop it. Start jabbin‚Äô like people throw around term ‚ÄúCFR‚Äù order make number like. known cases, known deaths, rate around 2%.  don‚Äôt get say ‚Äúwell don‚Äôt know sure I‚Äôm making death rate.‚Äù

Cases naturally reported, deaths. excess death totals prove that. rained yesterday. Swaziland absolute monarchy. king head government. actual powers.
Only handful countries left. recent studies suggest ""the placebo effect"" might real, might conditions go away time, example, person given sugar pill said pain better, another person get anything also reported pain better. short-term conditions like pain, nausea etc last, faded naturally made look like placebo something. lol, seriously, fantastic we're still considered friends despite fuckery last four years!  guy dead now. Meh. Permanent Vaccine Commission Germany expects general public get vaccinated December, might return normal 2023.

To fair, known notoriously pessimistic, still... Yikes. Quite difference expectations US UK, even EU countries like Sweden Spain. Sweden rich country. high GDP, goes 1%. Look wealth distribution. average (median) Swede rich average Greek Slovenian.

My man /r/Swedencovid19, must know lying right now? intentionally spread misinformation? ....and actually Turkish. literally identify per wiki.


You made false claim op said German.


You made false claim op said ""just Turks"" actually phrase injected you.


OP made clear positive discussion global effort behind vaccine (and presumably Turks take pride involvement).

OP made clear comment people behind vaccine mixed cultural background EXCLUSIVELY ONE OTHER.



.....yet are, lying teeth, making false claims virtue signalling strength lies andn false claims.


It's pathetic. downvotes? are!! appreciating feats demographic suppressed hundreds years. Legitimately 200 years ago woman would slave, 100 years ago go bathroom white females. female voted.. celebration progress. privlage would privilege hundreds years obviously can't understand struggle born privilege. racist sexist article. saying 'african' 'black' 'woman' implying fucking miracle did. right proved miracle science. thing dedicated life to.     

It could baby Yeti mattered real accomplishment contribution vaccine. never said case-fatality rate anything per captia death rate. Nope, specialists. 33.6k seems true, average matter experience counting shift leaders. [Medical Apartheid: Dark History Medical Experimentation Black Americans Colonial Times Harriet A. Washington.

Please give read.

Black people suffered horrifically medical system. White people suffering medical malpractice remotely comparable. true, think Sweden similar advantage anyway. Two borders Norway Finland, neither would porous/problematic state closed them. there's bridge Denmark, even easier close down.

I think real complication would regarding people work either Malm√∂ Copenhagen living other, solutions well.  I've thinking thing makes wonder taking vaccine worth risk, animal infections seems inevitable virus mutate eventually guess time tell. Anyone believes idiot. best friend, mother stepmother ICU nurses Stockholm. best friend engaged debate union published chronicle major Swedish newspaper this. trust word it.

It's around 25-35k icu base salary. 

The official statistics skewed count nurses crude pay including 12h night shifts weekends.

Going municipality/private health get ~40k, insurance companies/life science depending neat specializations experiences +45k. Well, I'll damned. Great news. Immunity lasts least 6 months, sign immunity waning that. Stop spreading misinformation. Well, woman volunteer participant studies( involves always risk) way say , seems scientist fault, isnt... really. instances younger populations helped, changing economic ties growing influence Asia economic powerhouse bail poorer nations like Africa. except I'm teacher. think aura around people lol good one bro hope find peace reason news orgs give race suspects even though they‚Äôve already arrested/are fleeing. ad hominems see. wonderful. means argument concluded. good day. Good sir, project advanced humanity apart recently? Lmfao right? fair enough, opinion piece neuroscientist, infectious disease doctor. 

Which like going Wal-Mart oil change get engine rebuilt... That‚Äôs really shocking pre existing conditions get vaxxed early. literally says first comment ""actually turkish"" werent germans. know language works? probably not.

since isnt gonna go shitty ad hominems, im gonna stop bothering responses. Masks still required many places. Vaccine records required many jobs forms travel. Unsure large group gatherings (concerts, amusement parks, festivals). initial response differed most, think perhaps main reason neighbouring countries much fewer deaths first wave. time passed, differences countries became smaller smaller. summer, Norway even less strict restrictions Sweden IIRC. Still neighbours able keep spread Yes, effect death rate many times higher many third world countries, many times higher every single one neighbours Norway, Denmark Finland.

Things like make seem like bash Sweden.

With said, kinda missed point well. Yes, current measures *enough* stop spread, enough bring 1. Yes, neighbours better - never denied fact. point actions place clearly lower - even enough. voluntary recommendations effect well, despite voluntary, due high trust compliance authorities. yeah agreement daft tosser who's keeping track high?

""Discrimination act making unjustified distinctions human beings based groups, classes, categories perceived belong.

US 1.9% mortality rate, basically 2 people die every 100 get infected , basically everyone US got infected, 7 million people would die like Balto, you‚Äôll love Togo.    response treat like insult.


Presumably need daily dose drama? lie make false claims going pointless/irrelevant rant? Bill Gates works Population Institute whose primary goal predict combat humanitarian crisis. primary focuses epidemics famine. He's trying warn world leaders coming years. He's actually knowledgeable topic. 

You google read numerous articles this. nobody said anything proud heritage bad, strawmanned cover fact agreement ethnonationalists. Spending like drunken sailor. Best thing done expect. ...why would article American vaccine mention Germany? Also could masks slow herd immunity, though understand would keep strategy vaccines available. That's county jail, prison.

It's tower downtown Cleveland campus like may think regarding incarceration.  know really applaud copy pasting ability still dont think there's anything wrong proud from. proud hateful prick. nowhere thread anybody claimed turkish insult. going lie, least put effort make believeable. moreso moment happiness see even years racism struggle, disadvantaged groups still able triumph struggles.

One working familiar tech, developing brand new tech. Haha sure. deny existence covid. Thing ruin economy general well-being society whole, 99% people even affected covid much. 

Imagine destroying people's lives wellbeing virus 0.1% death rate. Sigh.. Yeah looking places hypothesis doesnt hold up. wonder means business operate mostly online, like Alternate, Amazon. Surely staff also need stay home much possible, maybe couriers postal services also operate reduced capacity, all... well yes. specify firs doses going healthcare workers elderly, time gets joe blow like myself, wont til maybe March May.... mean fair... say early evidence human human transmission. Which, statement literal sense true time aged poorly. 

Again, saying he's wrong. I'm saying statement prove disprove anything. basically response local newspaper Ohio. entire state slammed time too. I'm sorry, say that? specifically remember ""healing"" getting better, 100% normal. Things going get better sooner projecting. general public need vaccinated things begin look *more* normal restrictions even begin lift.

For whoever reading conversation, please look actual experts saying, get information reddit comments. It‚Äôll sooner that, especially inoculate high risk first. basically flu shot

Yeah, probably stop drawing parallels covid flu. bad us start bad us here. I'm one people never gets flu shot. Every time get it, get sick. Can't remember last time flu like symptoms year get shot. that's anecdotal, I'm one body headspace getting vaccinated time comes. 

My point equate flu shot, might lose people feel similarly. Personally, worry covid vaccine while. Largely know they're trying vaccinate 28 yr old self employed introverts first. Relatively low risk. time available me, likely little reason take it. It‚Äôs developed released &lt; 1 year, something never done before. Zero chance test long term side effects 65 non high risk patient likely get start summer. higher risk group get sooner. Detailed distribution plans available initial roll general timelines available later stages. 

Antidotal evidence, 2 immediate family members work healthcare different states. received emails employers already stating getting first dose vaccine Christmas. 

It coming. MEAN FEMALE STERILIZATION HUMAN TRACKING COMPAIGN !!!!

/S Canadian take Vitamin winter sun low horizon get benefit cold indoors lot. realize *vast* majority people who've contracted covid recovered, right?

I'll take chances. hear hate NHS? must propaganda, NHS loved vast, vast majority people UK. Yes could better, think find single issue would lose many votes saying scrapped. it‚Äôs premature say ‚Äúmission accomplished‚Äù

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah spot that. Looking explanations mine doesnt hold up. can't fuckin come Europe one take American visitors right now. would love that's NCNNVP Day (National CNN Valuation Plummets Day) virus 5% mortality rate could do.

Which would around double 1918 H1N1 was. Flu killing people 20s,

And even older introduce Spanish Flu today US population amount underlying health conditions comorbidities, would easily several million fatalities months.

We absolutely would not. Antibiotics alone would prevented lot deaths since secondary bacterial pneumonia major factor lethality.  really blaming politics? seen world there? Half U.S population refuses take vaccine. government trying best (other executive branch) get pandemic many people ridiculous caring anyone themselves. blaming ourselves, it‚Äôs common sense go hang friends pandemic going listen safety precautions instead. many people including state senates democrat republican made pandemic horrible. They‚Äôve done bad job enforcing PPE everyone aren‚Äôt themselves. one blame shitshow pandemic I‚Äôm tired seeing many caring we‚Äôre close ending pandemic everyone would cooperate. M-Mr insurance manager, m-m-may please coverage pay for? P-please dying please say y-y-yes please Mr Insurance manager life depends signing form üò¢ mean, likely gene set genes certain personality traits. interesting people genes self sorted? love going too, can't wait COVID longer threat. hate WFH too. want go back office *once covid longer significant risk.* Please tell much socializing right now? Well, don't/can't read need something pep up. Good luck stay safe there!! people spreading=more cases little I've heard, probably several months vaccine reaches low-risk. give us decent window see prevalent post-immunization infection is, rate acute adverse reactions occur.

Plus, I'd reckon people less likely develop fatal cases liberty debate whether take vaccination, also time window observe response provided them. No, goal LOCKDOWNS reduce hospital strain. course goal vaccination campaign eradicate virus. Sometimes genius is... almost frightening. Good thing nobody‚Äôs ‚Äúfreaking out,‚Äù then, amirite? willful ignorance. refuse accept facts inconvient especially businesses wanted people work, shopping etc. cost. Never mind cost treating sickness heaven knows long haulers go though. many people vulnerable severe pneumonia, heart problems, neurological illnesses -

**COVID-19 (coronavirus): Long-term effects - Mayo damage caused COVID-19 seen disease primarily affects lungs, damage many organs well. organ damage may increase risk long-term health problems. Organs may affected COVID-19 Imaging tests taken months recovery COVID-19 shown lasting damage heart muscle, even people experienced mild COVID-19 symptoms. may increase risk heart failure heart complications type pneumonia often associated COVID-19 cause long-standing damage tiny air sacs (alveoli) lungs. resulting scar tissue lead long-term breathing Even young people, COVID-19 cause strokes, seizures Guillain-Barre syndrome ‚Äî condition causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase risk developing Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's long-term COVID-19 effects still still unknown COVID-19 affect people time. However, researchers recommend doctors closely monitor people COVID-19 see organs functioning large medical centers opening specialized clinics provide care people persistent symptoms related illnesses recover COVID-19. possibly optimistic anything related this? Id say you‚Äôve infected last months fine, back last spring id say youd much higher risk catching second time think getting point made. Never said we‚Äôre better (frankly, seeing many Americans‚Äô response pandemic, could argue worse), position help others time. Let us get better, stronger place begin help countries. don‚Äôt even need 100%... better shape countries helping.

Put way, ground bleeding severed limb next someone minor cuts bruises, going help first? That‚Äôs extreme analogy works. mention storage issues. I've heard reporting particular (NPR's local station Colorado) difficult reach areas mountains without nearby hospital facilities, least medical facilities proper storage capabilities. That's going real test. There's narrow window removing ultracold storage effective, spring snowiest time Colorado mountains, reaching remote places mountain passes vaccine still intact challenging. guess good news remote places much lower population density less interaction general public, hopefully they're somewhat insulated virus.

I wonder much problem two doses inside pretty specific window. Like someone getting first dose, logistics breaking second arrives.  uncivil that? ‚ÄúI cut things understand compassion, differences friendships, comes point you‚Äôre actually harming people, becomes difference morals values‚Äù. 

This exactly stand. article mentions, it‚Äôs choosing whether mend end relationship clear reasons so. Yup. It‚Äôs standard abbreviation headlines local papers save printing real estate. neighbours north (Malaysia) get similarly abbreviated M‚Äôsia.

We don‚Äôt actually pronounce Spore Ess-pore though. least I‚Äôve never encountered anyone says that. either refer Singapore full name SG (Ess-Gee). Also average age death consider. 28 vs 81. world apart. literally antipodes NZ. usually don't. saw CNN interview youtube majority comments like ""lol Bill Gates computer designer, know"" ""Go back fixing Windows 10"". certainly many trolls, unfortunately, lot normal people lack capacity read good news sources research using wikipedia etc. Yes, youngster Apollo missions, remember well, entire world stopped watch. significant - vaccine save many lives.  develop vaccine, high efficacy, short time, simply incredible. spite that...look numbers. It‚Äôs astonishing dumb country become since 1918. suspect proportion single income families higher among nurses average. (I'm registered nurse longer nursing.) know quite nurses got specifically children nursing flexible hours. nurse, work nights, afternoons, 3 12 hour shifts week whatever. rona already 1 years old Welp, HIPAA violation Look population US time average age death two diseases though.

There 100 million US time average age death disease 28.

Americans number 328.2 million average age someone dying disease 81.

You can‚Äôt compare amount deaths only. need consider whole context. I'm crying crying!!! guess, fact people worse mean critical things done, right? Nice! I'm considered group 1A hospital see within next week 2. They're aiming vaccinate 1k employees day could even see end week. 675k also two year death toll. We're closing least 350k verified deaths year, knows many next year. US engaged mass bombing civilians multiple countries. War results horrible things happening. Oh God dude guess that's understandable actually work tourism industry know fact void filled enough internally.

I'm much smaller country gone fits spurts dealing well poorly COVID (right fairly well) heavily dependent external tourism internal tourism could never fill void (all ""bad spurts"" happened opened country enable $$ flow in). 

I also suppose Australians travel lot less outside country may need security blanket little less? end, guess I'm bit jealous y'all country ""self-sustaining"" keep borders little closed can. Please point right violated. I'll wait. I've seen reports stating 42% Americans take covid-19 vaccine. see pandemic hit Queens? can't imagine nurse there, making this. seems like good time somber reflection. huge loss life. Idk that. know talk lot bullshit, something tells we'll seeing long lines states soon available. Gee, what‚Äôs New York‚Äôs excuse? New Jersey‚Äôs?  Yes. Europe instituted continent-wide lockdown late March, got infection control month make EU border impermeable without mandatory 14-day quarantine point entry concluded PCR test. entire pandemic could behind us would require occasional restrictions contain small outbreaks.

Unfortunately, are... sister queue Detroit! Estimated vaccinated next month It‚Äôll it‚Äôs over, likely next fall. know cases slow significantly summer yeah, people let loose little warm weather. Sarcasm aside, think would actually drive participation. Bruh Fauci lied us, said Santa immune /s Relieved. perfect, gives lot protection disease. seen virus absolutely destroy lives, even survive, 95% chance avoiding huge relief. Also knowing coworkers vaccinated means terrified eating lunch them. use rights suspended easily? quick thanks times provided archive links. It‚Äôs appreciated! Bill Gates tracking every move. /s Lol American. Oh size ppe bound Canada.

Y'all think America exists world Healing? There's long tail that. 3000+ people die today, tomorrow, day after... compounded associated illness disruption. hear? vaccine may still allow recipients carriers continue spread virus others... woods. better vaccine going get much worse, much darker.  I've pondered since February. Yet another reason avoid infected possible. see brillant mind worked help human race problem. lets make headline throw African American Woman picture clarify me. Would people obligated see wrong especially made headline Caucasion male, Caucasian female, Southeast Asian Woman. would Europe along vaccination? US getting majority Moderna vaccines. April US might 30% most, all, European countries 10% love everything holy, REALLY give healthcare providers FIRST, essential workers, essential helping us deal pandemic. cutting line rich people connnections. Let‚Äôs keep mind population US less 1/3rd now, average age death Spanish flu 28, 81. terms deaths per capita, Covid even close Spanish flu.

In terms life lost, instead lives lost, significance isn‚Äôt even close comparable. really like watching Disney vlogs; ask.

It's fact way researchers define ""prussian turks"".

I'm done here. I'm hoping situation highlights need daycare / childcare subsidies *outside* public school. economy relies workers available 8+ hours day, public school keeps K-6 kids occupied maybe 7-8 hours. families younger kids? people work shifts school hours? get screwed often pay extra childcare insanely expensive. definitely agree it‚Äôll never happen because

You probably dont know much Bill Melinda Gates Foundation never got microchip. Dont worry, covid vaccine. soon enough /s Memorial Day weekend going hot mess US. 

It seems likely enough people vaccinated spread drastically slowed, even herd immunity effect yet. 

And that's people need let loose. predict weekend going kick insane summer travel parties around country. Way make good situation seem bleak. Pfizer unable provide deadline would able deliver additional doses recently. still aren‚Äôt able lock even third quarter delivery date. additional vaccines come different source. She‚Äôs getting first vaccine may end pandemic you‚Äôre worried face? I‚Äôm pretty sure would five year‚Äôs rent Hemet. Lol right. every flu severity though.

But anything pandemic made realize serious flu is.

Although overall IFR flu typically times lower Covid, broken age-specific IFR, actually dangerous Covid certain age groups. 

It isn‚Äôt simple saying ‚Äújust flu‚Äù saying ‚ÄúCovid much worse flu‚Äù really depends flu old are. can't believe even get Florida point. True, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs language contracts voiding contract vaccine doesn‚Äôt work. should‚Äôve ordered enough every vaccine cover US. least cover 70-80% get herd immunity. emergency issue.


And receive many doses working vaccines, could sell cost even donate countries... wouldn‚Äôt go waste. I'm amazed insurance companies okay going south. I'm Holland (Europe) seropositivity tests, someone diagnosis past excluded. yeah, means bunch people trial post-covid get vaccine, nothing drastic happened them.

But really know terms ""lighter"" side effects - perhaps disproportionate number people light sight effects among covid participants, single cases vaccinated group disproportionately past-covid vaccine made worse.

There cases history vaccines made response virus. sure last. need cohesion Europe.

Hit nail head one. blame government handling properly... Thankfully media report thousands die everyday causes pandemic hit. mental hospital knew many people died every day. Isolation depression also major cause death elderly.

The fact volunteering nursing home put Santa costume, make bad person volunteer.

Yes hindsight mistake put show elderly, going around pointing fingers helping anyone. Sorry grandpa, dumb argument. virus, unintentionally spreading isn‚Äôt murder that‚Äôs viruses do. someone intentionally spreading would different story, made dumb decision spread someone unintentionally isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmurder‚Äù, especially since majority people get recover fine. initial comment said immigrants arent ""germans""

I never said that. Learn read. Willingly travelling pandemic California, stay home orders across state limited gatherings. guy wear ppe, willingly chose leave house go party, came back home grandpa died result.

We must different understanding word accident.

Maybe murder wrong word well. Negligent homicide? mostly are, worry. see far fewer Canadian license plates southern states winter, promise. A:
 
It's assumption. data. mind-boggling. no, complete overhaul healthcare system middle pandemic ""solution"". one largest preventable tragedies course entire event. damn given.
 
B:
 
Your comment ""*that 1-1.5 million deaths widescale government intervention*"" outright fabrication. government takes keen interest preventable causes death. Billions dollars spent within Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, VA, etc. annually.
 
And nothing whatsoever point, question answered. oh come on; range. always cut offs; everything spectrum never hard ""ok person 1 hour 12 years old changed"" breaks heart. feels like coolest science/medical thing life time. Feels like going moon. real moment humanity. NZ AUS closed borders however. think that's point I'm trying stress. even like airport NZ Auckland, airport Australia Sydney. 

Additionally, may see many flights coming Europe USA day, there's still significant traffic Asia right next them.

Correct, got hundreds flights Europe coming UK. whole point Brexit right shut down? consciously decided to. matter vaccine get. Truth likely need vaccines sources fulfill herd immunity numbers. integration seeing sub genomic fragments would incapable producing infectious virus. authors point discussion. Given this, one worried antigenic sin covid-19 vaccines? made perfectly clear making point international effort.

Exactly. stressing much international effort was.

A vaccine developed Germany, people born people born Turkey mass produced Belgium USA.

The researchers consider prussian turks.

Even sources used denigrate state that.

What joke.

Only america would problematic... Hah yep There's plenty can, done, still respecting current legislature, need overly dramatic it. situation necessates it, handled - likely ideal way. find someone little cheerful???

She looks like getting lethal injection! Yeah. I‚Äôm risk group least months me. Maybe guidance. 

It‚Äôs frustrating pregnant breastfeeding women lumped category, feels like risks different. 

For one thing, would easy test pumped breast milk antibodies anything else tell exactly baby getting. kinda speculative now. Trials including 12 older kids started Dec, start Jan, Pfizer/Moderna respectively. sound optimistic would complete next school year, however. 

I seen plans Oxford vaccine, trials 12s far. you? really though probably vaccine thought 'one done' (or 2 done) thing. Even ultimately need every 6 months year, people anti-mask would probably gladly go vaccine twice year putting mask every time go out. read sub people won‚Äôt get vaccine 2022 Please love god, want actually college campus, even campus yet, missing entire freshman year college. Fuck virus. That‚Äôs going happen here, don‚Äôt doubt it, rich famous person get us do, I‚Äôm actually high risk due diabetes almost guarantee pro athlete gets 50% households Peru tvs :( True black white argument. guess would probably prioritise elderly vulnerable badly impacted states would make even distribution (I'm saying right thing do, literally would do) Almost every statement comment factually incorrect. Please stop spreading misinformation fearmongering (for example: ""Those vaccinated gonna guinea pigs."").

If question vaccine, FAQ wonderful section topic! we‚Äôre fucking not. Stfu Russia. Exactly. should‚Äôve ordered boatload candidates. not? save money? Look phenomenal loss life economy day drags on. would bargain. penny wise pound foolish decision.  I‚Äôm big fan religion, last sentence completely unnecessary. consolation masks distancing need still happen regardless.

Who wouldn‚Äôt want that? don‚Äôt think strategy hold citizens hostage western countries provide aid food going pass muster New York. No, lot people refused wear masks stay away people. Ah worry, money need wait, get care. poor people shafted. Looking excess death/100k Scandinavia still better.

I'm saying minimal impact, I'm saying opposite. 

Just somebody old, mean death large impact. Everything bigger Texas Real education intelligence isnt necessary thats issue, nepotism simply attractive/sympathetic. Something I‚Äôm still unsure affect COVID children. studies lingering affects young children? 

They seem show less symptoms affected less across board, mean aren‚Äôt going see long term effects neurological respiratory system years road. stock markets strong ever idk problem heard really good analogy day. national group project requires EVERYONE part pass. covid idiots ( AKA knob lickers) pulling weight usual that‚Äôs failing.

It's jarring example old adage, ""history doomed repeat itself,"" great example importance teaching youth understand history impacts past impacts affect present future rather teaching history memorizing key dates names important individuals. 

In United States least, taught public school system know history, understand history - understanding history came due fervent interest history. Even university, unless history part major, really substantial enough understanding.

History civics, understanding two we'd likely way towards Star Trek future rather flaming crazy train Mad Max we're riding currently. like use term pre-existing condition reason instead disease.

I understand medicine advanced, general health population look like back then?

This resolves two main discrepancies previous trial data, dosing booster schedule. 2020 Killed Alex. historic achievement. level control nature home-run. hospitals continue run beds staff, deaths.  point people analyzing articles trying figure vaccine safe people 20 vaccinations already life, get kids vaccinated without thinking twice it.

But suddenly they've decided need figure whether vaccine safe. Despite fact know anything whatsoever vaccines way knowing whether vaccine safe, trusting authorities not. think returning office July others returning September option wfh on.

In case problem nepotism placing value looks. Trashiness disguised badassery, lack societal moral compass, disregard virtues, acceptance normalization unjust etc., people depraved uncivilized. goes way beyond worshipping Kardashians.

All don‚Äôt agree lack education critical thinking non-issue. Nepotism points made results lack moral education. didn‚Äôt think would come day need discuss education necessary are. 

Either way everyone agrees society seriously fucked up, whether education, nepotism, misplaced values. Yes, lead people lying vaccination status wearing mask. could allow recovered people stop right now, hard control. COVID, pnenomia last Summer earlier year (right COVID), kinds crazy unexplainable issues... Like feeling fucking tired time &amp; insane brain fog-- I'd making stupid, silly mistakes like describing. I'd later see mistake, honestly even recall making it. even fucked 2 different birthdays back April too.

Found viruses (like pnenomia &amp; COVID) cause kinds long term health issues. feel like ppl talk &amp; really discussed sheer # people affected COVID once.

I've since diagnosed autoimmune disease (Rheumatoid Arthritis) something likely predisposed (it runs family), believe triggered autoimmune response body back pnenomia... prior pnenomia, perfectly fine. 

I also found crazy deficient iron &amp; vitamin D. able get iron levels up, vitamin still low, despite 2 rounds prescription strength suppliments.

I say brain fog really improved started treatment RA August.

So maybe start getting levels checked iron, vitamin D, etc... super important daily function. 

But alone helping make difference, I'd much try see Rheumatologist possible autoimmune diseases.

I feel like many people autoimmune disease triggered COVID, even know look it. 

Honestly, many symptoms experienced post-pnenomia sound almost exactly like many Covid long haulers experiencing. kind crazy. sister law teaches district 4 friends went Alabama week school started. also went laws cabin Friendsgiving got sick. much faith people around here. mother law upset told won‚Äôt coming Xmas. says go church safe. Father new songs choir mask-less 6 feet apart. üò≥ wonder would please send us citizens. U.S. really needs boost average IQ here. Something didn‚Äôt realize extent shit. bet said people said we'd 3k deaths/day weeks, weeks ago. think top minds entire world collectively overreacting? Good - travel family emergency summer sure glad strictly enforcing mask policy. 

If child young wear mask, fly. combination self delusion blatant disregard moral values. lie much become lie itself. It‚Äôs loophole. trust company hardon everyone 

üòÇ

Also conspiracy theorists never scramble theories, make go. ever needed witness good examples confirmation bias listen one videos. could find support anything believe thanks google knowing different peer-reviewed paper published Lancet article info wars. web searches ""long COVID."" enough information sure, maybe 20% survivors persistent problems. Brain fog definitely one problem, worst. Take care patient. 1% 16.5 million 165k means using numbers would still rounding 2% Case fatality, calculations wrong fundamental level that, deaths lagging indicator. Go back number cases time November use todays deaths accurate picture. (Roughly 10.36 million Nov 11 /100= 103.6k * 3 = 110.8k.) still neighborhood 3% case fatality. imagine antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, highflow masks, anticoagulants, things keeping people alive today good man? lol I'm 25 perfect health still force take one way another, either law restricting ( you) point choice. stop kissing ass It‚Äôs also worthy note don‚Äôt know future impacts virus may beyond initial infection. Chickenpox relatively harmless child, however vacccine existed, mum caught brother sick. 25 years later developed shingles (a secondary infection chicken pox) turned meningitis encephalitis hospitalised 2 weeks nearly died. mum extremely fit healthy, vegan, underlying conditions etc. had‚Äôve chicken pox vaccine wouldn‚Äôt experienced shingles. (It wasn‚Äôt invented got chicken pox) problem scientists already made calls us, brightest world. matter much lookup articles whilst taking shit, average citizen ever able fully make informed decision. delusion thinking informed picking believe multiple sources internet. Exactly. It‚Äôs parents. kid. airline. difference Spanish Flu killed old young like. Covid kills old part, people care. really simple, shocked surpass deaths Spanish Flu too. America, value money make. Old people make money, course plenty people fine dying ""for economy"" mean that‚Äôs whole scientific conversation wonder coronaviruses hit felines hard. makes thing....

And knew feline coronavirus vaccine I‚Äôve never connected like this. achieve herd immunity get multiple times? ""Those Historically Doom it, learned reptile it."" mortality rate age 55 nearly zero. fatalities overlap health issues (heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, etc).

Why I, young healthy person, get vaccine? And, answer mind, demand rest stop eating much start exercising? Honestly (and guess, mind you) shocked reaching level herd immunity. Sturgis basically normal understand brings 1/5 state's population. pictures videos (b/c I'd never attend thing) looks people wearing masks lot. large outbreaks course spring summer too, IIRC.

Again, guess least explained logic. Herd immunity mean totally disregard kind precautions. said extraordinary public health measures ‚Äî mask usage, event cancellations enhanced hygiene ‚Äî likely continue ""several months second half beyond 2021.""

Remember angry everyone feels right towards wear masks social distance. Remember spring people start saying ""fuck it, us got vaccinated wear masks anymore"". ignorant ignore Fauci's advice now, equally ignorant ignore summer. pick choose advice follow convenient different people wear masks now? know mom would get vaccine whatsoever. made get swine flu vaccine though. be. I‚Äôve taken every vaccine required entire life, don‚Äôt appreciate lumped anti-vaxxers wild beliefs. Especially we‚Äôve seen way medical field continues treat black brown bodies. We‚Äôre distrustful good damn reason. Fuck anti vaxxers. people saying want vaccine trust long term side effects? I'm gonna line vaccine, logical argument , not? still even taking serious? botched covid response get go, saying community transmission, masks ineffective, basically whatever Winnie Pooh CCP told - went with. long proteins stick around? chance long-term harmful effects proteins? said lol may removed duplicate post Stop conspiracy nonsense... bets entitled twats parents let kids scream entire flight drink airline booze, bury screen shrug ""Sorry, they're kids?"" excess deaths though. almost 400,000 *more* people died statistically would otherwise year. (yes, means 100,000 extra issues covid - part hospital capacity making hard treat emergencies besides covid, maybe part stress/mental health issues well.) Wow didn‚Äôt realize needing take chill pill too. I‚Äôll also, soon don‚Äôt need refrigerated trucks dead. I'm confident megarich powerful got already behind closed doors many reasons besides stupidity could cause someone receive vaccine immediately.

Like what?  Maybe tell RNA shot. Republican Nuclear American something. nothing hip sucking tiniest ounce hope away people good news comes out. know world fire shitshow. Let people pause take breath appreciate good news vaccine created record time distributed. Nobody thinks gonna solve world's problems even solve pandemic overnight. sound like huge debbie downer, maybe depressed? NZ plans give fist vaccines March, front-line health workers care home residents basically. mostly waiting J&amp;J vaccine majority population last heard expected start general vaccination September 2021.  I'm willing take *any* risk new vaccine unknown long term effects virus extremely unlikely cause discomfort beyond common flu - also get vaccinated for. I'm healthy get ill, rest recover.

Here I'm willing take risk:

\* vaccine H1N1 back 2009 people went develop debilitating narcolepsy Government paid ¬£60m compensation, symptoms didn‚Äôt emerge 4yrs line, giving weight previous point. 


\* 1976 Swine Flu scare US led 46 million Americans taking vaccine avoid pandemic. resulted 4,500 Americans claiming damages $3.4bn. Two thirds claims neurological damage death. 


\*Pfizer shocking track record including largest ever health care fraud payout US $2.3bn. also fined ¬£90m competition watchdog unfair pricing NHS hiking cost Anti epilepsy drug 2,500 %. Charging taxpayer extra ¬£48 million actual price ¬£2 million per year entrusting new vaccine refused sell non-profit basis? 


\* MHRA put tender AI system deal large numbers expected adverse reactions new vaccine. argument consider fact average person might even get COVID, thus, long term effects COVID would meaningless person.

Meanwhile, person receives vaccine, absolutely received vaccine, long-term effects also completely unknown.

That said, I'm vaccination. best hope combat thing. think everyone get they've weighed options risks made informed decision. want make informed decision: means, line first let us know goes.  Don‚Äôt upvote yet: think everyone masked public herd immunity. don‚Äôt think restrictions stay place cases/deaths go way down. always come prepared reddit full grammatical arsenal.

Secondly make fair point liability reasons. going infecting people COVID kind recommendations think would have? take overweight, 60, history heart disease, diabates, .. blah blah blah whole lot that. hard justify celebrating 28.3% case drop accompanied 20% drop number tests taken.

Why would people take tests feel fine though? Yeah, know may asymptomatic going take test feel there's reason to, right? Except merely shun every religious body even making fairy beliefs known believers may force 'us' vs 'them' situation. authorities potentially saying vaccine dangerous unsubstantiated XYZ.

It always better work heavy influence crucial PR. dont care fairy god believe in, care however get vaccinated protect family vaccine then. think evidence prevent transmission. something anybody attempted measure, goal trials. I‚Äôve even couple dreams realized wasn‚Äôt wearing mask public panicked. It‚Äôs definitely automatic me. It‚Äôs taking seriously. Viruses mutate time possible make literally trillions copies without occasional mistakes. 

It's important remember mutations overall effect virus' operation, make less contagious deadly. 

The fact they're seeing particular variant occur frequently necessarily mean contagious, although certainly something look analyze. may simple first person develop mutation happened come contact lot people one particular day, managed spread far wide. right reddit downvoting telling truth  sure can, make statement like....""I want cut line also want everyone know rush product stand vaccine"" get vaccinated live Fair point - I'll still take chances. count vaccinated Summer best. Even then, large number people getting vaccine, expect able go without mask 2022. Police raided 28th birthday party early Sunday Ardennes town Saint-Mard south-east corner country, two miles border France. people taking part, including escort girls, French. described naked lightly dressed 20-strong police squad raided party. long spike proteins similar enough, varients cause concern vaccine. spike protein changes. start worrying zombie covid. blanket mask. Monke backs. virus novel, coronavirus around forever, new strain.

We lot data prior 2020. Everything built prior research.

It's sad lot people know this, think would disuade notion sciences new trust. worst parts 2020 knowing almost nothing learned this.

We ""free"" unexpected stress test entire global civilization. showed many areas underperformed flat broke.

And anticipate single one things produce kind lasting change that's clearly needed.

Heck, US, probably even get much serious discussion outside underfunded experts utterly ignored. slow flu seasons years. I'm educated topic enough know why, know thing happens. 2011-2012 pretty mild flu season. aghast someone could actually mistakenly think that; appalled it‚Äôs labor commissioner.Educated much? get together! remember, vaccinations mean instantly stop wearing masks go partying gathering huge groups. Keep distance least couple months, please. Question: double vaccination requirement, first shot, would happen patient becomes COVID positive? second vaccination cancelled? selfish, countries people dying need vaccine. living bubble. That's important remember. matter reasonable balanced try be, algorithms guard information, spam others. need recognize blindspots. 

I friends intelligent, reasonable people absolutely fooled covid misinformation. believing totally overblown, dousing groceries bleach. 

It's HARD find unbiased, factual information. *must* assume facts wrong open changing perspective. pray stop? babies less 1 year old risk sids (sudden infant death syndrome) - supposed even sleep blanket crib fabric near face raise risk. So, masks necessarily tested infants, saying use line current recommendations regarding SIDS. sure 1-2 age range. vaccine another tool toolbox, solution own. cutting amount new infections. place surging, vaccine better water gun raging fire.

That said, vaccine widely distributed, social distancing mask use probably intermittent based places experiencing surges. think many elements normalcy return summer 2021, though we'll still need guard. TBH sounded extremely ""corpspeak"" me. I'm trusting medical research / vaccination programs / etc. ""oh, cut line"" makes less trusting. I've worked large companies heard fair share corporate bullshit. ""we cut line"" makes bullshitometer go crazy. sewed couple nose wires help some, ones bought Target don‚Äôt shit them. Kids little bridge noses hold up. Hell, adults see pleated ones big triangle gaps along nostrils unless they‚Äôre pinching wire shut. Aye. sure. beautiful day outside.

Lots people piss poor understanding health medicine, completely independent politics. worst ones know nurses, scarily enough. vulnerable vaccinated, risks young person simply don‚Äôt justify lock downs scale. seriously dumb pretending? average life expectancy 79 doesn‚Äôt mean nobody older affected disease. point? Trump didn‚Äôt quite best job trying contain virus, US done worst job containing compared countries. Logically right, also can't presume *does* prevent transmission. can't really opinion yet. 
 
I get impression hearing officials talking mRNA gets involved old school vaccines would straight shield permit vector. Hopefully we'll get evidence soon. mean wouldn‚Äôt catch one 50k side affect like we‚Äôve seen vaccines. sincerely doubt people would lived get it. I've seen local headlines spoken numerous historians. eerily similar. fact, much so, can't believe it. ***mind-blowing*** ***we've already done this***:we've seen happens ignore it, we're anyway. 

My small city rash cases October 1918, town declared over. Literally, town protest meetings, op-eds headlines saying tired lock down, missed families politicians simply sacrificing holy days political reasons! 

Less 100 dead, fall. people went back normal, despite politicians begging to. 

By Thanksgiving hospital full. Christmas nearly 1000 dead. January headlines widows mothers mourning children. 

It's sincerely unbelievable. almost could believe made propaganda get us comply time. seriously uncanny. 

Sadly. made up. (apparently) human nature. thought evolved. Always wanted see outback Scottish I'd catch fucking fire standing shade,that I'm terrified spiders nevermind monsters there,the whole country looks amazing travel would torture get especially I'm scared breathing people's fumes haha,hope keep safe well! Dumbest smart people world, figure.  lol made up, bullshit cope. must looking total deaths, would NJ NY hit April anybody knew going on. NJ higher numbers cases first peak, that's much testing. Deaths still much lower April/May (like 458 April 30th vs. 19 yesterday). must massively higher amount people infected back know testing capacity. 

Now, [per capita deaths last 7 NJ (52.5) NY (51.6) bit higher Florida (45.1), huge difference considering worst hit states, Rhode Island (117.1) Tennessee (107.3) much worse.

Get vaccine, infect antivaxxer, watch question doctors last breaths. everyone got 55. happens elect leadership literally believes opinion equivalent fact.

May well fast track natural selection. means ""i find spanish offensive im gonna change language convenience thanks"" work covid unit hospital got shipment today. I‚Äôm still little hesitant effectiveness vaccine still chose get anyway. Less half unit willing get point. prefer chance transfering virus somebody usually ends unit. many patients question years life cut short due virus.  understanding listening prominent virologists expect data U.S. study clear things candidate get approval first month two 2021. Gallup said 63% large number willing change minds. Take heart. I've staying home want kill anyone's grandmother. time, want get vaccine think herd immunity goal. goal protect vulnerable.  article written Canadians though. phase 2 context means general public. want pandemic go forever stay home. hate going outside interacting people. would personally take vaccine I'm definitely antivaxxer, let's face it, rushed guarantee safe effective long run. Also, big difference recommended, enacted, people do.

Very elderly (over 75) account huge portion hospitalizations, long hospital stays, ICU stays, deaths. vaccinating small group, priority every state, absolutely tank hospitalization death numbers.

As production novel therapeutics (like Regeneron Eli Lillys product) continues, interesting see societal reaction hospitalizations, serious cases deaths, still positive cases.

Could soon Feb.  reasonable people. Fine. we'll seize assets super well. You‚Äôre wrong. Basically good thing Australia perspective controlling spread virus country big there‚Äôs great big desert middle, meant WA able close rest country right beginning pandemic. talking mink farm style herd immunity? get wanting first first. Id understand might want wait little bit longer. seemed really dramatic seemed offhand comment US sucking too. Right alongside sure, lots love idiots following top-down protest health measure. want FREEDOM lol  average age someone dying disease 81.

Hmm. Life expectancy US 79 years, life expectancy COVID 81....

/s Downvote want, think partial herd immunity. people refused wear masks social distanced spread sufficiently people safe continue safe. Simply virus running areas go rampant fashion.
 
Now I'm saying go back life usual, people playing safe start crazy spread again. banned life 2 year old wear mask.

The parents f\*cking idiots risked lives numerous people airport plane wanted fly NY see Rockefeller Center pandemic. Apparently also according mom, they've flying around summer long like this. parents even bring mask child, given one flight attendant.

They asked leave airplane 2 year old wear mask. parents leave asked, delayed plane. reasons banned four year old still refuses wear masks times others. young kids learning.

So couple options here. One let children free roam around wherever kill people pandemic, exclude can't properly wear masks things unnecessary. need maximize profit shareholders revolt

Bezos still holds controlling stake, false well. yellow stars unvaccinated! aware testing through. However, CEO company taking we're told safe pretty odd. access. And, I'm really positive people upset demonstrated faith companies product ahead others. increase people's doubts. getting Covid vaccine. But, raises questions Pfizer's. suppose opportunity get line anytime soon. So, I'll let time tell. I‚Äôve asking shit stains you‚Äôre getting facts claim nearly year yet see substantiation. Back stop spewing bile. tf politics need bring western imperialist propaganda Clickbait  anyone outside echo chamber, basically going mad 65+ get vaccinated, IFR like .1% among remaining cases still politicians saying ""we stay closed, 1000 cases!"" whatever.

To virus wrongly categorized lethal pathogen start. Yes, kill people. orders magnitude way likely maim body. think looking virus something wrecks insides, occasionally kills particularly vulnerable people; instead killer virus. 
 
But we've set standard ""do die not?"" we've gotten fucky response virus. mean US officials telling young people go get it. attitude ruined response virus. 
And we've developed vaccine supposedly stops dying. Well, good. Obviously. also prevent earlier symptoms GGO? vaccine trials studied comprehensive health conditions participants. worry virus still maim us, kill us. 
 
Between unknown capacity vaccine, fact stop transmission... thing we're addressing people dying overloaded hospitals. 
Which, again, good. seems like we're dealing majority total sum bad virus produces. long-term bodily damage.  
 
This vaccine seems like treatment worst symptoms anything. yet we're going wipe hands say ""welp - back normal!"" businesses need give people free shit government give people back tax payer dollars, people decide money? job politicians stop fucking businesses making profit. lets load ""them"" trains! work sets free! We're rapidly approaching point corporations big say ""no"" governments ignore whatever inconvenient them. There's nothing explain, instead watching shithead youtube, read article yourself. makes sense vaccinate bunch geriatrics, may still die guess what? They're old. stock spices, get recipes ready.

TP Souffle ahoy wide latitude run business long project image short- long-term profit. 

Functionally, ""we obligation shareholders"" code phrase ""we're fuck employees product quality held accountable"". Screw White House using tax payer's money getting nothing done American people. Taking good things first. year's crazy might far could happen

Ps. wholesome. people Michigan gracious people. visited definitely left positive impression me, least interactions. 

Edit: ps. Sure will. not? one available options. go location vaccine want. unlikely Pfizer vaccine rural locations, someone wants drive city center handles it, not?

Vaccinations forced anyone I'm aware of, risk get first dibs. prerogative skip wait seek other. meanwhile people moneys work moneys ar actually source moneys thrown bus. People history severe allergies excluded trial. important state phase i-iii clinical trials perfect representation population. usually good enough.

Any drug product approved continuously evaluated approval (phase IV) adverse event reported analyzed order improve product. understanding watching interview TV people immunosuppressant medication *may not* recommended, they‚Äôre completely excluded. Thanks! **Phrasing** I'm grateful working. 

What's stupid pretending safer pretty much industry. silver linings heavy clouds falling sky crushing buildings Hmmm, would get vaccine hoax? mean, I'm surprised Trump claim refuse yet got quite alright.  may remind florida wrestling essential business. 

apparently whoever drop enough moneys table essential. ONE first reach 60% they‚Äôll herd immunity. Might now, Good lord willing creek don‚Äôt rise. They‚Äôre 5th best state nation comes per capita cases. thing Michael Ojo... neighbor college well never would consider good friend, friendly great acquaintance lot fun cheer FSU. scared sports starting season bubble like NBA NHL Silent majority everyone thing, we'd okay

Except there's absolutely nothing indicate this. mental fallacy people adopted

Want know people past pandemics? distanced, washed hands more, stayed home sick. dealt vaccine available.

They turn cancerous vultures screaming people wearing bit fabric face. roam around looking scapegoats blame spread highly contagious respiratory illness.

Newsflash - overwhelming majority spread people everything ""right"". Including you. Exactly. _impossible_ vaccine as-yet-unknown long-term side effects. side effects usually evident within two months getting vaccine, one shown nothing like yet testing. Meanwhile, long-term side effects virus much thing, varying degrees amongst different people little known yet.

So personally much prefer take vaccine (when available me) take chances covid.  flu argument holds water. peak season southern hemisphere, flu abnormally low attributred covid measures. 

I suspect one lowest flu seasons year covid measures increased flu shots.

Sars mainly localized Toronto. weird western country significantly hit (250 cases 43 deaths). recall strict quarantine mainly kept hospitals. Taiwan built plan implemented covid. built plan probably forgot look it. Covid-19 clearly read book. noticeable impact vaccinations occurred UK already? Especially first claim, please give source that. can't personally find anything effect. I‚Äôm dumbest state union, Texas. 

Atleast admit island gives huge advantage.

... largely gets negated virus takes root community. Victoria, Australia one quarantine centre breached things seemed control took four months severe restrictions get back zero cases peak 700 new cases day post quarantine leak. took lot hard work people there.

Vietnam (multiple land borders, including one China almost 1000 miles) knew little margin error get onto quickly early remain effective surveillance - far.

Flip around look Hawaii, however ... appreciate snark, urban philosophies corporate structure mixed venture capitalism decimated rural hospitals medical structures. never vast support structure rural areas, vulture pickings boardrooms looking buy local community health centers for-profit motives left rural areas shambles. 

What Walmart small businesses for-profit medical providers (emergency, nursing home, assisted living, insurance) rural healthcare. 

It's Billy Farmer down-the-way buying local nursing home closing it, Johnny Politician local school board enacting medical policy pricing structures designed urban hospitals requiring rural hospitals follow rules sink-or-swim. destruction rural health care communities past decade often hands ""urban elites."" rural people say trust government corporate groups, blame them. dishonest news organizations capitalists exploit mistrust lies active brainwashing campaigns, I'm going use sit high horse say, 'dummies deserved it.' infuriating. whole White House doesn‚Äôt wear mask get vaccine first? Fuck can‚Äôt get in-depth care home without coming pocket money don‚Äôt have.

The CARES Act supposed cover diagnosis treatment. I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt wanna acknowledge fact. average 50.000 people dying Alzheimers year year also pandemic see one year spike 70.000 really call coincidence? i'm ready bet weird spikes places like florida. then... pretty much rest White House too? covid vaccines need cure covid, need downgrade common cold. Wow! That's great know! I'm behind anyone makes positive impact society matter sex color! Even so, pretty good know!
Let's remember science education help us fight virus! expect ton people get dose 1 lot less get dose two. Convincing adults get two doses difficult store vaccine going easy, especially correct time frame. I've noticed seems pretty underwhelming response vaccine rolled well. miserable sob's euthanized instead dude dont guys like.. zero cases? zero everything I've heard said NZ done really well pandemic handled casualties. saying, whatever mitigation working. We're idiots need help get. already catch it? China‚Äôs government actually took care people locked down. 

People given food, water, medical supplies needed. 

Sorry can‚Äôt handle that.  open ""wear masks infertile!"" actually is. super spreading senior staff first get it. Welding people homes can't leave quite authoritarian. bet dump block attempt vaccinate biden campaign. vindictive prick. really wrong way things. don‚Äôt make things even creating imbalance. college requires it, get it. getting flu shot important enough get degree Cornell, don‚Äôt attend school. Although I'm sure fit perfectly, decline. hometown enough maskless turds running around. Fake news. actual mandate allow skip flu vaccine Curiously, non-COVID deaths aren‚Äôt proportionally higher spring spike, testing much limited, relative later year. Published Australia already got COVID probably need vaccine anyways. Yeah, especially given location. people tried kidnap execute governor months ago, really small number. minority? Sure it‚Äôs still sizable group morons No, deflecting. writing highly misleading things Swedish strategy was/is. One would think could criticize Swedish approach without making things... Sadly Tennessee, truck would met many booos would cheers. exactly Trump did, say exact opposite Trump said. didn't, really. (source: NH resident) actually things, basically copying Gov. Baker (MA) couple days delay. policies also teeth: mask mandate couple weeks back punishment go it, enforcement priority either.

Furthermore, opposition stepped two biggest landmines here: support income tax, support gun control. Combine recency bias semi-competent response get massive margin Sununu. It‚Äôs funny people know said coronavirus fake, don‚Äôt believe masks ones complaining better first get vaccine. Ya can‚Äôt make stuff up! Thank you! seriously something tired fucking overwhelmed world finally said fuck man.

You seem familiar statistics CDC still recommends vaccination otherwise current recommended list. workplace/hospital strongly recommend (but require) frontline employees get it, including several hundred symptomatic cases.

There clearly reinfections tiny handful confirmed ones there, I'm rather disappointed better data (as far know) actual risk reinfection. Ontario sucks, wish usa. city lockdown, can't even go somewhere drink numbers much less usa. guess least 4 months

Yeah think would better way word underestimate many dumb hateful always funny me...those times people need absolute best, choose worst. clearly mental health issue. Road rage quite literally dumbest, useless, irrational, dangerous human responses. Diagnosed morbid obesity? Honestly, even though deserve it, probably arent getting vaccines first.

They arent considered high risk definition, otherwise dockworkers lab techs would elegible. could see people covid test centers labs testing covid swabs getting them.

Since many think we'll back normal summer, figure six months would good time touch base.

RemindMe! 6 months never achieved herd immunity. Sweden 10M people. herd immunity, needed roughly 70% people infected 7M. Assume death rate around 0.5%, would need 35k died. today 7k people died COVID, 1/5 way herd immunity. long covid anything damage body, yes, help stop outcome. vaccine incredibly delicate precautions likely make sure still viable gets administration site.

He's asking expected overlap infected asymptomatically vaccinated. info useful model herd immunity start work. prove basis probability science vaccine likely significantly safer getting COVID. can't prove there's teapot orbiting Earth right now, make true. Nobody really knows, sudden change.

For instance expecting reduce hospital admissions 75% 100 days vaccine taken effect(10-35 days first dose), would expect hospitalisations go 0.75% day current rates ~1700 ~13 people less day. realize much data reddit alone one you? mention youtube, google. taken step back saw incorporated google online market: Youtube, Google Search, Google Apps, Android, Google Drive. mention stranglehold 4 companies news media.

There's doubt immunity effect, can't really say amount long last. Every new unproven policy that's adopted failed. see nothing wrong actually sticking research says, neckbeard calling ""the science"" saw fancy graphic NYT.

It's okay admit wrong. even though would work LOT better them... don't. this?! Give time. Yeah government bought enough Pfizer vaccines 50 million people. Thankfully, Pfizer company vaccine. Moderna's vaccine extremely likely approved bought 200M doses those, 100M immunizations. agree you. But, blame Trump's stupid attempt save face anti-mask rhetoric. also blame turning tests WHO, early stages, preventing post office sending everyone masks planned to. Glad anti-vaxxers protesting bet I‚Äôm exercising get checked out.

But time ? know *Russian* doctors scientists heavily criticised way Sputnik vaccine developed right? Warning developed sub par testing used political gains?

This external parties saying this. legitimate concerns. 

But hey, either Russian mindlessly pro Russia everything branded 'Rusophobe' sub seems. one rid tiresome priest? Yes, cherry picks studies portray certain viewpoint.

It fails mention, example, large scale study Iceland, also new, different 40,000-person study found children 15 half likely adults infected, half likely adults transmit virus others. Almost coronavirus transmissions children came adults.  get infected transmit others, less frequently adults,‚Äù says [K√°ri chief executive studies viral load children - yes, swabs high viral counts, translate real life transmission? droplets coming lungs, virus counts nose/throat matter?

The reports Salt Lake City Poland childcares - case studies outbreaks occurred (just 4 clusters). exceptional clusters frequent? I'm Melbourne. get it. I'd recommend right working hobby. Vietnam also pulled even better far Australia (who really well). much better US given disadvantages comparison? (High density, multiple land borders including almost 1000 miles China).

I'll also tell understand wilful defiance many people even politicians dealing hard science pandemic. density parts US pales insignificance this. 

Melbourne dealt compliant population starters enough right thing Australia lot US ... not.

What lot people endure ... well, let's blunt, brought dragged along people trying right thing.

The people Melbourne lockdown months end, got light end tunnel zero cases weeks (down 700/day new cases peak). got sarcasm totally backwards. I'll add ""/s"". pointing repubs flip-flop suddenly want saved care then. propaganda anti-science rhetoric coming from? rural people brainwashed repeating it, propaganda coming from? put disinformation campaigns, powerful media organizations, politicians, political enemies. Powerful people live rural communities, manipulating benefitting rural populations destroying them. Facebook, Fox News, right-wing commentators, Russia, 45, anyone else living rural areas? No, they're not. want look rural people (which monolith) fully blame them, myopic filtered viewpoint. Follow money. Follow benefits lies. WFM forever /s really necessary? Paper towels ? thing ? fuck? look public bastardize us? god fucking damit dense. ever outside US? depends impaired immune response is. Older people generally pre existing conditions solely based age. get something like Covid systematically attacks Organ Organn devestating.

That's young people still get long lasting conditions it. 

But also explains football players example take like nothing. remember this. remember thinking would first one. You‚Äôre clearly wrong dude. least many voted trump. üòÅ Global supply chain cool. Keep mind lower results Mondays/Tuesdays on-par patterns now; cases weekends (hence reflecting weekend tests) testing capacity reduced. fair, theres lot going Kalamazoo begin with. virus clearly told us problem humans.

We could gotten rid thing had:

A) Governments gotten organised gotten masks delivered everyone.

B) Everyone wears masks outside.

But instead, government incompetence caused virus hang around economies get destroyed, selfish assholes everywhere spreading around. Maybe plan, government saying private sectors fault, reality many died state owned care homes. government FoHM (public health authority) pointing saying following guidelines one put up.

It‚Äôs absurd.

He PPE too, neglected spend pennies investing hedge, blowing trillions sorts nonsense. Managing logistics they're great at. 

Example. VT local national guard organized distribution thousands loads free food locals early months virus people need food scarce. would hold different site state every day people pull up, get loaded, way safely within 2 minutes car. food sourced state kept refrigerated/frozen needed. sight behold.

The US military handling organization logistics covid-19 vaccines. see FedEx commercial companies physical distribution makes sense. ""resources"" I'm referring previous comment. 

Finally, US military zero financial skin game much likely unbiased opinion logistical variables. allows best results nobody trying make buck distribution. curve clearly flattens 10 days. fact, isolate 10 days shot, may 99% effective. US suspect reported 16 million low several orders magnitude asymptomatic mild cases. maybe factor 5, could hypothesis 25 percent population exposed. think covid fku lumped together. reason economy shut people get flu show symptoms relatively quickly. 

The 10 percent died hospitalized includes age groups, low mortality 50 high mortality 65. 

We shut people adopted mask compliance, contact tracing, lots testing (like weekly, universities US doing). 

The basic problem covid crap shoot. get fine, ok medical aid suffer lot. Imagine overwhelm hospitals.  guarantee death rate seeking medical aid would double digits. Stone cold, also really funny. Hard type response phone, may able better explain later I‚Äôm computer Depends NH. urban areas adapted quickly rural ones much. Spit particles virus particles travel, clumped together droplet. particularly true influenza bigger size shape. However, normal breathing still release finer particles, including even individual virus cells. Illness depends exposed enough virus get sick, another reason masks work. block bigger clumps, blocking many virus cells reducing load possibly point someone even get sick. 

To use analogy, COVID virus size influenza virus size always consistent, influenza bigger. Sometimes COVID and/or influenza take mass transit (droplets). Sometimes walk alone (individual virus). want prevent getting house (body) install gate (mask). Someone walking might still able hop squeeze walk around it, bus coming gate, prevented 100 people bus coming through. 

As illness severity, immune system many aspects far complicated understand. Even people study extensively even completely understand reasons people get sick COVID others don't. functioning white blood cells, they're trained recognize foreign material whether they've seen not. antibodies virus encountered before. even completely immune system, though. we're seeing immunocompromised people getting sicker, people comorbitities. know virus effecting people's hearts, already weaker there, that's problem. drove past Pfizer plant day.

Buuut guess that's wrong.

Immunosenescence generally means slow respond infection. eventually respond. Immunocompromised means system impaired may able respond. elderly susceptible dying often due low type IFN responses first days infection. Fate pretty much sealed first days low IFN. eventually kicks back though time ICU, high. mean everyone talking immunocompromised among us particular risk death misinformed?

There lot different ways person immunocompromised. go every single one basically impossible public health perspective. type IFN deficiency lead severe disease. Recent transplant patients certain immunosuppressants also greater risk severe disease.  So, general advice disease would immunocompromised individuals watch out. Well, think stinks, I'm sorry dicks. :( oblivious!

That said, also important Dr. Corbett black serious cynicism black community taking vaccines due pretty fucked history. communities dying disproportionate rate - makes vaccine even important. role creating vaccine important identity may well save lives. people can't manage financially without parents working full time, kids somewhere else family ends losing home. pushes people take risks they'd rather take.  us. feel lucky least Jax quite bad. life gives lemons might well make lemonade.

You're *jealous* me, you? Natural immunity requires get virus. means getting symptoms, leads death long term/permanent organ damage. also includes natural spread infection time illness.

Taking vaccine skips symptoms infectious period providing benefits immunity.

Not sure would considered marketing wank. Fair. probably included detail original comment, though, since pretty much way could've gotten infected actually following precautions like lived alone. 

While SARS-CoV-2 pretty contagious, I've read studies even done showed even 80-85% cases involving family member, nobody else household got infected (albeit, cases did, literally *everyone* eventually got sick). access research suggests long-term effects worry vaccine ever would love see it.

And access research suggests long-term effects worry vaccine would love see it.

This problem. Every time heard someone life questioning whether take vaccine bring potential long term issues new vaccine. Like you, want take (I want everyone end this), good answer it.

I'm sorry daily message trash science, spread misinformation, ignore mask rules, encourage social gatherings first line. know doubling incorrect statement. feel need so? denial covid becoming likely cause death? Now, vaccines might change that, right happened.

The lightning strike stupid comparison, honestly. We're still dealing minority population that's infected, infected long. 

It's like downplayers sense future, think what's happened far. People done every plague always look really stupid hindsight. 

Anyways, hope I'm wrong everything goes back normal soon. whole argument based feelings. 


Oh no.. guys business may shut down. That's never happened history world. ever do?


Sorry experience real world. people crumble business goes under. live. Quit letting feelings random people's businesses control life. put much faith statements anymore. I'll wait approved. daycare aspect school underpins entire economy. Single earner households increasingly rare somebody look little ones. 

For lot people, admitting can't run schools means admitting give income count keep thier heads water. So... lie themselves.

For part, partner gave thier job facilitate remote education would impossible hadn't. super happy it, easy get back things get back something like normal. meantime keep belt tight soldier on. shit, Sherlock. 

It's known kids asymptomatic far adults. take rocket scientist figure 'hey, maybe kids get asymptomatic sick, spread symptoms, give parents (who blame infection activities)'. perfect vector. 

But ignore we're dumb, ""LEtS RetTUrN nOMRrmal!!!!"" seems highest priority people (especially like kids can't easily stay home care them) send school. Thus, kids get packed 25+ classroom whole day, school board meeting via Zoom. charge scientific team NIH helped develop one first vaccines coronavirus, teamed Moderna help test effectiveness safety manufacture distribute it.

Article team working back woukd help people let politicians educators. Even people disagre ""let er rip"" approach, still allowed understanding framed let er rip politicians instead doctors scientists. think article (also root) lays call person color articulate, suggest‚Äîeither intentionally unintentionally‚Äîthat she‚Äôs exceptional, whereas, contrast, suggest white people automatically assumed articulate. plus superior education system feel like whole situation can't sustainable - there's ton pent resentment rage building regarding blatant inequality, takes trigger event send entire USA streets really feel like issue hospital beds accepting new patients something people underestimating. Possibly government officials don‚Äôt want people panic.

 massive issue, numbers continue climb like last couple weeks. you‚Äôre talking people getting sick, even going get seen doctor. they‚Äôre getting tested, especially they‚Äôre denier somebody suspects virus dangerous, going community. Someone across world follows Indiana news. seems odd Pfizer produce it, ran trials 90% work development vaccine. reality, neither Pfizer Biontech would anywhere without other. making got source? white house announced actually true, made think you‚Äôre pretty confident happen.

People vaccinated yet say ""Deaths hospitalizations down, waiting for?"". vaccinated people care world, think going continue wear masks distance, good luck. understandably want travel, party, meet everybody etc.

The result exploding infection numbers along vaccinations. I'm expecting people get Covid chance receive vaccine. culpability shared. hard reap sow people outside community salting earth, going full 'scorched earth motherfucker' you. Chicken pox. kid, good little kid got chicken pox immune system would know fight it. act like bunch children.

Literally half people country believe use turn signals driving. expect entitled jerks? People act like people still need wear masks go out. Wouldn‚Äôt seen testing?

They‚Äôre saying attack organs instead attacking virus, causing severe Covid. cause severe Covid cases severe covid trials, would think no, isn‚Äôt happening vaccine. Unsurprisingly putting ahead Americans gone way kill. ""When Sweden decided break ranks majority countries try achieve herd immunity rather introducing restrictions sparked tough criticism experts governments around world.""

It's what's written news article... I'm commenting on. know number one goal heard immunity. swedish strategy shut anything down, thinking control spread manageable levels (managing acceptable levels spread/cases/deaths). 

Seems way control spread lock downs, get case rates drop. want Christmas criminal trials Yes let‚Äôs listen governor people spent countless hours making vaccine know exactly many doses person needs. Great idea Title misleading. people understand herd immunity is. work Covid well. Covid substantially contagious, widely available vaccine (as flu does), degree preexisting immunity prior exposure. NYC schools, positivity rate something like 0.26%. minuscule amount. Social gatherings driving pandemic. swear, people needed babysitting Great It‚Äôs basically Balto 2: 2020ing 1 4 confirmed related vaccine. I‚Äôm gonna go ahead believe FDA statisticians. Helping keep spread going, smart businessmen. Stockton dearth businesses yet ones represent want try kill you. Smh keep hwy 4 lonely would fucking thunk possible? two kids get sick worst shit. Anything get passed young healthy immune system guarunteed hit hard. I'm getting quarantine I'm pretty sure 12 year old gave virus. suspicion got school. article Ireland, it‚Äôs applies everywhere. haven‚Äôt done safety trials vaccines relating pregnancy breastfeeding far know, none works.

Im office 3 people I'm right window. open crack small heater desk. One managers came saw open closed sent email window open. told open ause virus. Fuck guy. I'm keeping open (I close leave) 20-30 mil would still likely drop death rate half alone. I'll add 2 cents fucking idiot start working Pfizer. 15% would something it‚Äôs risk taking 15%.

If say, 20% people aren‚Äôt wearing masks going bars house party‚Äôs orgys snorting Coke hookers, 50% become immune, that‚Äôs 10% population thats immune, that‚Äôs going reduce number superspreader events considerably, reduce overall R0 10%.

Shit hits fan though 3 months later people taking precautions get lockdown-fever start joining bars, house parties maskless praise worship singing Sunday. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) Here's insane entire situation. DeSantis faces **no repercussion** whatsoever saying dangerous misleading things like publicly. people gonna vote still going vote him. Meanwhile, gets continue serving governor, he'll never retract apologize irresponsible statements like this.

America absolutely dystopian Also TN totally you. governor pointless. 

Please take care yourself! know Governor (from different state) sound like good leadership.

Will fight Biden's Covid plan cooperate it? Clear communication. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs lacking US. (Locally nationally.) Wait he's research scientist now??? getting desperate. happened barking reporters next mike pence I'm surprised scalpers selling Ebay yet haha gonna pretty hard convince mask usage happen cases plummet. big deal us black people firstly experimented Tuskegee Vaccinations 

The Tuskegee Syphilis study nothing vaccination.

Rather consisted enrolling black men infected syphilis trial would supposedly treated instead would treated doctors running trial could observe effects untreated syphilis long term.

At time study began treatments syphilis low efficacy using arsenic compounds still better treatment. discovery penicillin treatment could completely cured them. However participants given treatments all.

It anything vaccination. effective treatment given penicillin antibiotic treatment. still vaccine syphilis. Also gotta take population growth account. 1918 population prob like 120million something, percentage much higher Civil War killed action split half roughly, confederate side obviously Americans. can't believe I'm say this, Trump needs step tell DeSantis STFU Dude Everyone screaming years. Doctors try telling people, get mad, give bad ratings, insurance funding comes play people stop going doctor. EVERYONE knows overweight bad, people wanna hear it. healthy size largely myth (obviously someone overweight better metabolic markers someone healthy weight years, well let's say many 400lb 90 year olds). People legitimately want hear it. Telling people lose weight like telling smoke. they're adult even 70% mental capacity normal adult, know. agree though. mean gods sake army even worried fat United States is, whole. need change culture nation right, never was. Like wearing mask. Arrogant cactuses/cactii.  subreddit taught prepare worst Glad I‚Äôm alone frustration. often feels way. selfishness ignorance overwhelming lot time. Two vaccine receivers died trials. Yep  Oh lovely, lawyer politician trying make claims go contrary people actually know fuck talking goddamned idiot. f r g l e e g it'll two shots :)  ‚ÄúParties‚Äù one good, too. Nice thanks true. limited supply vaccine go good, means countries got control need keep keeping control.

I really hope next pandemic hits, spin vaccines even faster year, even ""only"" happens every 50-100 years global scale, tensions causes could result violent collapse one countries, even though make fun ""muh freedumbs"" crowd, need mindful toll ""properly implemented"" lockdowns taken mental social well-being fellow citizens. hate reality lot Canadians second homes Florida Arizona. discount fact probably noone guessed 1918 one third americans would eligible proper health care, insurance.

Though covid exception that?

Can uninsured person who's feeling unwell go toa hospital check treatment free? Nice End January see sizable change assuming nothing crazy happens. We'll administered millions doses (in US) vaccines available well making abundant. could that, since replication spread factor looked studies.

They tracked people getting sick, note whether people still virus replicating nasal mucosa, virus likely enter body. 

So people 95% protected getting sick, mean protective antibodies nasal mucosa would neutralize incoming virus could replicate small amount exhaled. Therefore still spreading virus, despite actually getting sick. That's false comparison. opinion thought exist within conscious person shared never transferred. car external object person acquires. Ownership transferred.

Whatever point making, clear. indication less deadly (with greater contagiousness)? say like people don‚Äôt count aren‚Äôt many them. know obesity comorbidity like one third country obese. You‚Äôre fine letting people die? can't brush like you, prescribing uneeded medication big deal industry behind industry question. argument.

to criticize someone concerned absolutely insane. one note this: believe anticipated first widely used mRNA based vaccine entirely accurate. methodology pretty novel compared previous vaccines. like making muffins instead cookies. concern normal person? going test person almost immune system would still possible. New Englander others lives Mid-Atlantic NE sector U.S., NE commonly referred New England Northeast talking region U.S. Sometimes abbreviated 'N.E.' Lets say definition risk dying, death rate even 5%, vast majority people risk. 

We don‚Äôt even need vaccinate everyone, 5%. little people dying, people going stop caring over. US paying highest price, specifically supplement cutting prices lower income countries. Pfizer actually bit trouble US prioritizes Moderna them- especially Moderna cheaper US easier ship. Moderna also likely prioritize US amount government funding using. Pfizer counting US upping orders price scale. used sliding scale calculations. US backs off, means countries may pay more. Moderna getting approved soon likely causing Pfizer rush bit secure another US order. take goddamn vaccine. FDA needs chill hopefully throw whatever influence towards encouraging vaccinations get back stadiums safely actually haven‚Äôt developed viruses! main use seen actually cancer patients. administered mRNA vaccine designed tumor trigger immune system eliminate tumor. virus know looked HIV struggle HIV extremely mutagenic figuring mRNA best target hurdle. Illinois example, many facilities report numbers Saturday Sunday, results get rolled Monday numbers. we'll see significant decline Saturday sunday, huge Spike Monday.

The answer look rolling average, 7 day averages Well bar trust low. dont understand people like shut critical thinking say ""I trust vaccine"". KNOW idea talking about...and KNOW nobody else either. blindly trusting pharmaceutical companies zero worries. wish could shut brain think ""well elite people charge say good ...and science mentioned..so TRUST them!"". really wish could think like that. would know? qualifications able think know better hundreds doctors worked vaccines? No. US government pays free heavily subsidized care well 100 million Americans  extent, remember politicians one vulnerable populations Africa.

They tend live lot longer get lot fatter average African person would. Sadly, there's usually 1 2 athletes year die this. know next year best looking backwards. Yeah willing take vaccine? course I‚Äôm willing brick I'm happy top comment actually something thought provoking instead generic karma whoring comment like ""get veins"" morons understand vaccine injected veins. It'll feel great way actively strike back bug finally. [i work internal medicine made fact sheet resource patients  me. would rather mild case several times year rather one serious case suffer long term/permanent damage. me, think long term damage worries death.  I'm ""divided"" myself....I taking it. 

It's gonna interesting....it definitely spawn *kinds* lawsuits....if company without real cause tries force vaccine people. That's end month

Another 50 million end next month screaming *Confirmed* cases 5% population today. sure got 20%. would 65 million people. 

Serology tests seem work alright areas higher prevalence. using mathematical analysis limited data, good look probably something would bank either. also done months February April, testing *bad*. Yes, we're undercounting. think study useful determining much undercounting today think would confident applying today's data. idk man, lived outside USA 15 years, prefer much say, Korea UK, lived before. Yeah I'm watching PM's address atm, said stores keep delivering packages.

Like said though, right PostNL completely swamped. We'll wait see effects end being, stores allowed fulfill online orders, that's relief :) True. wages temporary though. dosen't seem anything region/muncipal division. price personal freedoms, oh well also using many applications would make billions dollars existed theorized   make distinction? thing. False equivalence. evidence vaccines harming people. Pandemrix, Dengavaxia, AVA (BioThrax). Polio vaccine African countries causes paralyzations virus wild. 

It stunning people realize (or care) mRNA vaccine rolling first time given millions/billions without long term safety data. could go wrong? 

Pfizer indemified. UK head comment needed vaccine ""safe"". think anyone needs critical thinking skills get bottom one. 

4.4 billion paid funds set pay vaccine injuries last 30 years. Almost 150 mil annually awards severely limited. know everyone harmed coming forward either. 

I wish could stop pretending vaccine 100% safe like pushed hard give people false confidence take it. Even worse labeling people legitimate concerns ""anti-vaxxers"". many take long tested true vaccines. one gets tiring new mRNA tested months lumped notion ""vaccines"" safe. Irrelevant. thing matters is, particular vaccine safe answer is...NOBODY KNOWS. really. paid employers. long attacking spike protein little concern vaccine develoment. Lmao moron speaking NY. put hashtag / pound sign front text goes super bold large typed ""#""1 came 

#1  Ah yes 100 year plague   additionally, crazy antivaxxers obsessed use fetal cell lines vaccines, vaccine developed fetal cell lines. OK, live city anymore guess re-opened summer then? Anyway, they'll close shop now. They're prioritizing distribution based paid doses knew could secure them. U.S. missed chance purchase additional 100 million doses, seeing Pfizer doses beyond we've initially ordered (50 million? think) June July.

That said, Moderna similar, we've got hundred millions took money Operation Warp Speed (Pfizer received help U.S. government even refused help distribution), we'll first line there. think EUA meeting sometime month well. J&amp;J needs trial read-out think happens January, I'll bet get EUA assuming crazy adverse reactions.

The J&amp;J vaccine probably best people are, whatever reason, afraid new tech behind Pfizer Moderna mRNA shots. fact they're two doses spaced weeks apart. J&amp;J might effective, even 60%, remember Fauci saying would huge win. 60%, 95%, 95%, we've got quite win going roll-out kicks high gear.

EDIT: want add timing additional Pfizer doses MAY work benefit they'll going full authorization April. get sometime summer, they'll likely first fully authorized vaccines children 16 younger, could get priority vaccinated 2021-2022 school year. trust never officially ""herd immunity"" strategy. 

You mean ""It never ""officially"" herd immunity strategy"" ""It ""never"" officially herd immunity strategy"".      
And even two debatable.  looks highly unlikely get serious case Pfizer Modernas vaccine Reddit, maybe. People talk irl (including 2 nurses) don‚Äôt want No, target select actually die it. one dying, one give fuck go back normal I'll add anyone lives another part country aside like Florida Texas, look weather like here. cold us even number look bad you. [i work internal medicine made quick fact sheet resource patients mean hindsight. I'm sure time deals getting negotiated US wanted secure certain amount maybe put eggs one basket/one vaccine. still air vaccine going effective not, effective. Canada secured 10 doses per resident really feel like hoarding (even though they‚Äôll definitely donated elsewhere point), time, hedged bets. onion standards, ya know. bar low, there. S‚Äôpore sounds close s‚Äômores Nothing change though, still masking, enough supply general public want get it... tiny bit safer guess. tested long vaccine lasts? seen anywhere, considering reinfection possibility picture anything getting ""normalized"" even 2021 start scratch every year. relatively vaccine every year different antigens. antigens present multiple years row, we've already developed antigens. matter ones go vaccine that's given year, ""how make new vaccine strain"".

That's new strain pops like H1N1 2009 big deal. Sure. question answered billion times now.

Do question flu vaccine developed less year every year? Wear masks!!!! Social distance!!! NEW NORMAL!!!!


Oh shit? nearly Christmas New Years?? age old traditions generate money rich cause greed coveting!! 

Ok stop... NEW NORMAL January 1, 2021! Nothing see people! Well postal parcel services already can't handle sheer volume online orders deal backlog days. cases even pick new parcels sellers warehouses full.

Stores like Bol.com probable deemed essential keep open, however exact measures published tonight. People willing anything they're told to, fucking elites wet dream playing reality right people like even real. people downplay virus keep willfully ignoring percentage people hospitalized (meaning might well dead bill comes them) well percentage people permanently affected virus, mentally physically.

Meanwhile they‚Äôre also pretending they‚Äôre spreading infecting risk. Brazillians stupid.  


A r[esearch released says 52% blame COVID deaths. 


30% says great job pandemic handling... (Those 1/3 hardcore supporters) 


He's probably getting reelected Science expanding knowledge humanity. Science would happy group people volunteer control group. hope ending pandemic. Humans incapable coming together greater good.  believe it. I‚Äôm left come laggard getting vaccine, all.

I get annual flu shots, I‚Äôve received mandatory vaccinations work purposes, I‚Äôve hermit since March, think vaccine good thing likely 99.9% safe.

I‚Äôm 0.1% suspicious science could taking backseat politics influences. trillions dollars stake via shutdowns. healthy young 0.1% higher risk virus itself. happy suspicions fade coming months though. UV also great, let's get body somehow Lest science types get judgmental, re-read Cory Doctorow conspiracy theories: look opioids -- genuine conspiracy, Big Pharma effectively manipulated market, scientists, doctors, patients maximize profits expense Americans. like never happens impossible ridiculous.

I'm getting vaccinated soon (as 64 year old essential worker, I'm pretty much last line, apparently), I'll try persuade many vaccinated. take threat corporate conspiracies seriously, whether Big Pharma Big anything else. amount time lmao. Go hang rural area country shocked stupid people are. Spoiler alert, they're almost exclusively republican voters. Thanks, assume vaccines didn‚Äôt fare well weren‚Äôt widely distributed states place got FL Gov advocating one shot foregoing booster. mess needs structure.

We literally emergency federal vaccination plans using them. crazy People divided vaccines back then, too. divided masks well. absolutely get 600k deaths (but also need factor population much smaller)

I expect close million USA time thr pandemic done.  Anti-vaxxers pretty much irrelevant April stage, general populace (supposedly) start able get it, work toward true vaccine herd immunity. April high risk groups getting it, crazies thing effect part. alternative? least 5 me. time virus either gone largely suppressed anyway. Hopefully Dec &amp; Jan make dent towards vaccination healthcare workers elderly. latter born heaviest toll terms deaths mess.
 
Nose grindstone now, think OK little bit optimism peek dark clouds. lot people get killed bad vaccines second wave Spanish flu? Man post bought paid for. Wtf. Anyone supporting testing, therapies vaccines need protected people get sick, disrupts supply. That's true decision makers people ""on floor"" actual work. many times, every person brings unique tradecraft experience process makes inefficient replace get sick.

Well, know matter, think definitely part first wave vaccinations. especially true since testing pillar response (along distancing, masks, treatments eventually vaccines). validates importance people deciding fate, kudos thank part solution. Gasp.. shock.. kids catch things bring home? Oh, yes, means trust Trumian fuck. Seduce marshals article chock full stupid.

He's suggesting one dose enough. He's saying vaccinate broadly initial supply, rely future shipments provide second doses (as opposed FDA/CDC recommendation stick half doses freezer 3 weeks 'til give 2nd dose).

A sensible approach could save lives **if** predictable, steady supply. However since guys tuned supply (FDA/CDC) suggest conservative strategy (of holding back 1/2 supply), probably best go that.

The article also says Florida allocating vaccine per capita basis, even make sense gives idea bright author is. obesity kicks in, keeps children warm. Something tells nothing would say would convince otherwise. Working might work you, mind video conferencing people interacting co workers, serious benefits collaborating co workers able reach instantly. Setting meetings email phone call work time everyone. Imagine it‚Äôs Placebo. so? fucking stupid. guess things like cancer &amp; heart disease count. one small city California year ago closed down. pretty convenient stuff wanted booze get car walk inside purchase rather selling driving like every product store. people would feel honoured historic photo may even define moment history taught later. others said, he's alive, could say something want used much. consider maybe really happy viewed impactful. Every single non-decision little, late. economic damage, none epidemiological gain. Masks 100% effective, people always wear right all

Gyms need stay open, especially surge. understand opening back restrictions though, cases low enough Gettysburg numbers accurate. numbers cite good estimate casualties (which includes deaths mean deaths - means anyone unable return battlefield almost reason). Deaths closer 8k total three Wearing whole work shift gets annoying. surrounded people day probably less issue post covid would agree there. wearing public hour near bad hesitant wear one say grocery store ends. Ok, take one dose Ron That‚Äôs sperm sir Yes, natural immunity means might die virus becoming immune. That's message poorly trying convey. 
IF already tested positive recovered, immunity possibly strong stronger vaccine immunity, know sure yet. That‚Äôs big concern mine too, how, much post covid screening really happening. really know it‚Äôs doing? saw study months ago saying 66% (or something around that) asymptomatic people tested nasty looking internals. rich socialistic country, it‚Äôs easy resign. ignore we're dumb, ""LEtS RetTUrN nOMRrmal!!!!"" seems highest priority people 

This flat wrong. ""we're dumb"", least directly. society built around kids school day parents go work. Kids home disrupts everything even already does. 

And let's also pretend year without social interaction fuck entire generation children, would.

You make arguments shutting might worth spite that's fine, pretend ""we're dumb"". Well, person replied deleted themselves. Coincidentally, we're month early 2400 deaths/day [(16,855 deaths last 7 days)/(7 days)]. that's sadly undercount deaths reported instantaneously. I'm disappointed wrong. misleading, question quoted top also different. 


The headline indicates, poorly, getting covid dangerous (and know long strong immunity is) getting vaccine safer (because know safe efficacious is). So, yes natural immunity definitely ""less safe"", inasmuch must roll dice dealing virus. Absolute bollocks. ample warning italy &amp; China. Taiwan managed. NZ managed. Australia managed. everyone 60% better half 95%. different message 1 shot good enough. put weirdly yes.
White kids grow seeing Presidents look like them, that‚Äôs Obama important. Hispanic kids told they‚Äôre cleaners food laborers, black kids told they‚Äôre thugs drug dealers, gay kids sissies get disowned never happy, etc. It‚Äôs good people see others like inspiring positions it‚Äôs also great straight, white people see diversity everything therefore combat negative stereotypes what. Good gravy. reddit! Generally, using title implies title something unusual important name. That's scientist never use title. NN also annual bike week though. Pregnancy considered condition raises risk like age. Pregnant people right concerned. Especially deaths covid pregnant increasing minorities already higher rest population. Especially black hispanic women. care mean problem. think alot large life improved drastically alot us deal overbearing work lifestyle draining social interactions. 

I personally hope things never go back 100%. Working home infinitely better masks help lots illnesses. essentially similar terms restrictions. expect we'll tail end current wave. Hard believe US could find yet another way fuck COVID thing.  

Manufacturer says ‚Äòtwo doses‚Äô - republican senator thinks maybe no. 

HOW COULD RATIONAL PERSON SAY OK TONY, THINK ILL TAKE ONE. Would wear glasses one lens optometrist said eyes needed correction? watch half movie, get bus drop half way home? Sure you‚Äôre closer - you‚Äôre walking 5km.

You bet ass friends country club won‚Äôt wing one dose. will. start going grocery stores, dentists, doctors, optometrists, etc. Oh damn That‚Äôs actually true. two separate studies, years apart, thousands people it‚Äôs proven times knowledge Tuskegee among black people causes significant unwillingness volunteer medical testing don‚Äôt spread stereotypes. I'll Florida...

Florida man strikes again. 

xD... Ya'll drunk uncles US.

Enjoy, Florida man. LMAO article UK approval USA approval Meanwhile, refusing bake cake lgbtq+ couple discrimination, ""religious freedom"". Fuck guy  Apparently not. Everyone record saying June September. really? Care explain?

The virus tearing rural areas entirely due denial science putting president charge doesn‚Äôt believe science. probably sleeps stacks hundred dollars. hear it‚Äôs comfy going reduce viral load least. kids worry right.? I'm defending trade 95% group people 60% twice many people. Assuming neither amount gets us full inoculation, someone tell us scenario mathematically better?

(Yes, know 0.6*2*x secondary tertiary effects numbers lose me.) Yeah sure. think so. 30 vaccines, thousands people behind one. hero, chinese scientist risked life posting virus' RNA code without permission country. reasons actually essential job? not, seems like waste resources (many paying for). I‚Äôm talking dual income households single parents. often truly 0 choice That‚Äôs actually true. two separate studies, years apart, thousands people it‚Äôs proven times knowledge Tuskegee among black people causes significant unwillingness volunteer medical testing research. don‚Äôt spread stereotypes.

Apparently current Twitter account created year story old one deleted.
Anyone know true?  Germans actually Turks least descendants turk immigrants. true, know percentage people refuse taking vaccine. low many European countries. quite rare older people. reasonable me. charge company, would want employees come variety reasons post pandemic. Representation people lying, soon good portion population vaccinated stop wearing masks. Time lose V-cards Actually yes. anyone's business want risk flying window?

Not anything anything we're talking about.

I'm glad ""Wear mask forever"" types extreme minority, even sub. News flash, one still matter time. ""new normal"". think even entire population supportive new vaccine would still necessary. could fetch pretty penny black market. must right, randomly capitalized letters.

Reported. Never heard anyone refer Fauci articulate. I‚Äôd assume anyone who‚Äôs leading world curing pandemic probably pretty good words. Closer April/March makes sad see country used political bat time people dying. even seem find joy numbers going up, proven right.

It disturbing joy many seem take Sweden's misfortune. Schwedenfraude. agree point pretty crappy list deadliest days there's lot taking account. time, get include something like Gettysberg imagine maybe around half deaths soldiers injured infected battle succumbed injuries days later. since one keeping track died day far back, harder say. Granted list still silly know deadlier days included throughout US history, many see take face value. live Mexico people 40 supposed vaccinated June 2021 March 2022, honestly, risk parents vaccinated (they‚Äôre supposed get february) I‚Äôll start going out, I‚Äôm risk dying risk getting depressed, haven‚Äôt seen friends since March (I‚Äôm scared don‚Äôt really believe COVID bad don‚Äôt want risk catching giving parents), I‚Äôve cancelled trip looking forward long scheduled august regardless getting I‚Äôm going trip. course does.  laws said vaccines made parts children‚Äôs lungs. didn‚Äôt quite know comprehend that. driving car, drive 3-5am avoid drivers. windows recirculated air on, ended driving another car, going 45 mph opposite direction. wearing masks, already Covid. chances caught driver?

Florida Florida. that's repeated mistakes states? Agree.

Petryfying Stupidity.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""You're mark here's link proves right"". Sweden apologists usually invent new language arguments fail there's new form logic. rich wealth, need wealth rich. That's literally definition. Swedes quite poor. matter repeat ""but high GDP income"". Yeah mentioned that. taxed away weirdly enough ends hands 1%. That's Sweden worst wealth inequality world, Russia, Ukraine Brazil levels.

You showing ignorance. Yes, Italy much richer Sweden. That's boomer misconception, Italy backwards poor country. paid real estate lower COL Swedes taking 500k mortgages 3k per month wages.

And thought Belgium poor, words. thinking Pierre Nkurunziza (Burundi's President), suspected died Covid, confirmed. 60 actually bother research this, you‚Äôll find people races subjected medical experiments past 100 years. Particularly effects poorer/less fortunate people can, shocker, range across races.

Black people aren‚Äôt ones look past targeted group. point, people need realize past past medical ethics come long way. Corbett, African American woman, praised key scientist behind COVID-19 vaccine

How demoralising must Corbett accomplished much, reduced nothing skin colour racist articles like this. Yeah wouldn‚Äôt post news stories happening nobody would click them! Anyway, next reply even masturbatory last two; won‚Äôt replying.

Yah self awareness. funny.

Still waiting explain how, laws constitutions made. rarely see people without mask yet cases increasing dangerous pace MA. wish Baker would shut schools put greater restrictions back get control. Damn media generating clicks! live Portland see bars over. We‚Äôre truly fucked. Beautiful brave US Government right top it! 

Checks mail!!!!  Mentally shot. Working law school finals found one cousins passed away, likely side effect pandemic. establish placebo works setting like this? Oh god... BILD garbage. get it. guess german know use source sub. realize lot Democrats also skeptical vaccine...right? Netherlands testing 60,000 people every week lowered cycli test say someone positive even quicker before.

Meanwhile, positive test rate risen 11.1% 11.6%. can‚Äôt tell small increase - also debatable - worth hard lockdown.

Source: think pettiness stubbornness. glad open. people care themselves, simple. Damn media always reporting happening! honestly, matter. Turkish immigrant, Black person, really advanced AI, cares? take scientific development that. praise people involved, rather background.  Brazilian government already bought bunch those? Without share non-cooperating people, data quite useless.  decline unemployment? bunch old white men forefront. saying qualified individuals could find? Stop lying yourself. wrong rings around years. isn‚Äôt conspiracy. mystery sickness sweeping across nation killing? Oh weird, guess flu shot working.  silly Trump literally signed executive order trying week ago. didn‚Äôt mean could use excuse give vaccine without proper trials‚Äîjust pregnant people mounted strong antibody response without serious side effects, like participants. Surprisingly they're not. We're equal Greece Slovenia median wealth. still fairly low GINI coefficient (0.27) also increasing last decades (up 0.25 2003, 0.23 1981, equal 2000, seemingly peaked 0.29 2016).

This seems related us taking new economic underclass form poorly integrated immigrants, large portion lack skills relevant job market. gini coefficient also steadily increased Reinfeldt years, given turmoil financial crisis hard discern due politics economy. relative poverty levels still low, also seem increasing.

I know standard SD argument unfortunately there's truth damn thing :/ understand certain people refused vaccine? doesn‚Äôt matter want get vaccinated not. fall certain guidelines eligible vaccine. obviously aren‚Äôt intelligent would like believe can‚Äôt see facts anti vaxxing propaganda Oh wow, makes sense, never considered that. SUMMARY: BERLIN (Reuters) - number people working reduced hours Germany‚Äôs Kurzarbeit scheme expected increase following strict lockdown start Wednesday, economy ministry said Monday. partial lockdown place since Nov. 2 yet negatively affected labour market, said statement. However, significant increase applications short-time work schemes indicated rise number people working reduced hours. Dutch person working healthcare say fucking time don‚Äôt want betray corporate owners, mean donors. children able vaccinated? long need test vaccine would approved? key points consider evidence:

‚Ä¢ pregnant vaccinated ‚Äì vaccinated pregnancy over

‚Ä¢ think may pregnant delay vaccination sure not

‚Ä¢ planning get pregnant next 3 months, delay vaccination

‚Ä¢ know pregnant start two-dose course avoid getting pregnant least 2 months second dose

‚Ä¢ first dose become pregnant delay second dose pregnancy over

‚Ä¢ breastfeeding wait finished breastfeeding vaccine. breastfeeding first dose advised second dose finished makes sense drug companies would want test, could get litigious.

It's litigious, ethics committee would approve trial trials showed safe young children long-term. duct tape. Shut fool up. Lol kind idea meant it, could see situation coming, knew prepared pandemic, pandemic started still anything (USA) want start working prevention. 

I realize that's simplification generalization things going, thought kind funny. LOL... habit sorely getting over. slowing learning [not greatest country idea many countries already approved it. thought UK, US Canada epidemic along Sweden understood.

It like countries doggedly refused test anyone Wuhan ICU's started filling up. absolutely still anti lockdown dipshits. cant argue results Victorians right thing. get beers. Netherlands go full lockdown starting tonight 12, Prime Minister provide information evening Exactly this. vaccine becomes available age group (I'm way list), UK, American expat, I'll make appointment local surgery, walk in, show ID, get vaccine, walk out. 

Done. bills. insurance haggling.

I understand Americans continue sit idly American-for-profit-healthcare behaves like this.

*Every day*

*In every way*

*I'm glad*

*I moved UK.* Nobody would've know anything media. NETHERLANDS Governor, little late that. Plus, dick hanging out, might want see that. What's sad surprised see article idiots attempting stop trucks delivering vaccinations conspiracy theory soon. know even discuss without violating Rule 4, ""Avoid politics.""  article really virus, vaccine. politics certain politicians receiving vaccine, months calling virus liberal hoax. expect almost comments reported deleted, rule. think that's encouraging. cases, statistics built upon (you need hundreds thousands least). get proper data, need wait years see whether children show developmental problems. definitely see high. Already 300k dead snd it'll rise mention take account total excess death count there's probably covid deaths ended missing especially start pandemic testing great. hospitals overwhelmed possibility medical procedures deal much mystery flu. Don‚Äôt really understand headline - thought Trump already accepted credit this? 10% homes New Hampshire owned people outside state Massachusetts employs number NH residents? NH actually residents? Send sign MassHealth? nice idea, mostly still wishful thinking. would surprised manage 10 million per month. That‚Äôs key- state‚Äôs legislatures won‚Äôt anything, we‚Äôre screwed. someone done development medical devices, studies pregnant women super hard. even allowed approach enough *long term* studies young children show harmful side effects. get children studies, first need long term studies adults...

It take years medical device gets approved use pregnant women... that's devices. Pharmaceuticals whole different class altogether. 

So yes, oversight. part plan. Nobody going test something long-term data data children pregnant women super vulnerable. Heck, ethics committee would even consider approving trial. get next year, that's great. probably wont happen soon. trying best keep humanity getting back normal again. Iagree Option 1 obviously dangerous Option 2 really better job spreading basless unreasonable fear. Thanks obvious me. side note, manipulate placebo effect often? placebo effect real, give placebos still avoid risky behavior? must better nothing situation like this, it? already happening? people think virus hoax way giving placebo? There‚Äôs literally restaurant 10 minutes factory one wears mask they‚Äôre open dine health dept orders lol much whiplash can‚Äôt even begin Kinda hints deaths covid African countries likely massively underreported... Honestly really hope rollout slowed trying convince people take it. want it, move onto next person change mind, try track dose future. know measures schools taken? 

Do wear masks? Keep distance? 

Here Belgium schools open well measures. schools comprehensive, well executed set precautions schools pretend follow rules lax reality. Unsurprisingly schools superspreaders... Sure, always going case quarantined aged care workers backfilled, leaving residents abandoned regular care. Speaking US specifically, whole issue goes back beginning have, top advisors suggested, go hard lockdown weeks, proper government financial support.

If everyone able stay home 6-8 weeks, government paying citizens, would ""normal"" fall, way Australia New Zealand have. economy would rolling, kids would school. chances amount ""free money"" printed would drastically less well.

All crap (namely federal state governments) make hard choice front knew make. Even lockdowns half-assed little government financial support. hard fathom government, whose sole responsibility safety citizens, failed hard. I'm worried people start taking pandemic even less serious vaccines here. Like they'll stop taking precautions even though may months till us vaccinated Cou neck, chin (menton). Sorry true CFR lower. surge along increased testing prove true. Hospitals still risk overwhelmed unfortunately

Try keep Yeah, saying ‚Äúshutting stable door horse bolted‚Äù means it‚Äôs late make change. fair enough, one horse. Using phrase makes seem like think pointless exercise fact, whereas it‚Äôs sensible see threats could come source. necessarily. court ruled laws Governor Whitmer used basis authority issue executive orders unconstitutional, nothing wrong orders themselves.

Oxford trials testing Covid though severe cases vaccine arm. Pfizer Moderna counting symptomatic Covid infection, one knows many asymptomatic infextions. Oxford vaccine could prove useful yet, despite absolutely terrible messaging. task force?

Thank taking care it! rock! agree said first paragraph first paragraph utter garbage. ‚ÄúBig pharma‚Äù profits government loses money pandemic, lot it. buy vaccines administer them, FREE still call corrupt trying profit pandemic. U.S thrown 6 TRILLION coronavirus response still say they‚Äôre profiting? stock market crashed many times America one worst financial positions ever in. statement U.S government made money pandemic completely untrue fact total opposite.   ï Õ°¬∞  ñÃØ Õ°¬∞ î That's true. absolutely said children spread virus *as much* adults. shown several studies first wave, specifically remember one Netherlands one Denmark, I'm sure more. tested extensively contact tracing families children adults infected, found almost cases (a statistically significant fraction), children infected parents, way around*.

However, studies younger children, politicians extended children (&lt;18). recent studies shown older children (15-18 last study saw) much likely spread virus. Almost much adults individual basis, much adults group, considering larger number close contacts kids have.

*As write this, can't remember normalised total number infected children/adults. can't imagine didn't, would poor science, I'll look it.

Your state 50K tests day.  
My state 200+ tests day.

We roughly infection #. Yet positivity state 4x mine.

We 25% capacity includes noncovid. 
You guys 20% capacity covid. 
FL Hospital Bed Occupancy: 4687 covid only. 
NY Hospital Bed occupancy: 6222 covid non covid. much people actually needed office instead testers every Google work home product? likely take weeks couple months formal reporting structure form. 

I expect states announce early vaccination amounts next week so. Republicans don‚Äôt care facts, want owner. NY 10-11k cases 200k tests. Florida similar case load ????? amount tests numbers trustworthy North Korea saying they've never case entire pandemic. luckily also limit stimulus based income without accounting cost living, bay area, 2 bedroom apartment excess $3k/month, happened make enough paying rent last year along increased living expenses cost living, getting stimulus anyways Another reason people want take vaccine can't sue makers vaccine end getting adverse reactions. Since can't hold liable, governments setup compensation fund people get adverse reactions. Governments expecting people adverse reactions.

 Governments around world gave pharmaceutical companies free pass skip important steps testing vaccine animals see long term effects testing humans. Lots vaccines make market even shows promise early studies, end failing long term studies line. There's reason need take time making new vaccines. amount money speed important steps need taken. Experts saying immune catching virus could potentially spread can't vaccinated. may reduce symptoms know stop future mutations virus. So, vaccines proven effective due limited studies. Presidents pharmaceutical companies even tested vaccine.

Those vaccinated gonna guinea pigs. find long term health effects new type vaccine.This vaccine never tested millions people. Also, telling us taking vaccine 'no walk park' end restrictions time soon. likelihood side effects high expected. [Same CEO poster boy narcissistic, profit people, type. company ton turnover well respected people leadership positions. Local preschool announced third confirmed case past month.

Just months ago telling us safe school. opted remote program. Lucky... Wait, percentage high 90s good now? Yes. like hearing coming without fanfare. wanting numbers facts. pass! Please take care. I'm sure mean. talking about? bergamo looks like new zealand compared somewhere like north dakota Eh, special knowledge, things go well would expect following:

January February, medical professionals, nursing homes, risky personnel getting 60% vaccinated.

March general populace gets first opportunities, limitations facility locations store vaccine.

June, wide spread availability vaccine.

But that's guess time line US general. Cities facilities mentioned March need. mean rural populace can't get it, may need travel.

Various world concerns shift this. Downvotes notwithstanding, scenario far typical average Covid case one involving ventilators lifelong health much 50% cases asymptomatic

That's somewhat inaccurate. said ""40-50% people test positive asymptomatic,"" take account untested people infected show COVID-19 crosses blood-brain barrier 80% cases neurologic symptoms.

First: ""headache"" ""nausea"" classified neurologic symptoms study. yeah, surprise 80% would experience them.

From study: evidence yet virus invades brain, new work scientists Lewis Katz School Medicine Temple University shows spike proteins extrude SARS-CoV-2 **promote inflammatory responses endothelial cells form blood-brain barrier.** study, published December print issue journal Neurobiology Disease, first show SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins **can** cause barrier become ""leaky,"" **potentially** disrupting delicate neural networks within brain.

The research supports implication could cause destabilization, prove it.

That ""78% patients heart damage even recovery"" sounds scary, realize people studied symptoms severe enough warrant hospitalization, factor knowledge leading cause heart inflammation (myocarditis) ""viral infection."" Big Ten college football conference initially cancelled fall season based study showing myocarditis athletes tested positive, later reconsidered could determined Covid cause condition, previous viral infections athletes had.

Post-viral syndrome always existed, unique Covid. surprising people experience long-term, lingering damage viral respiratory infection. personal experience, fun simple cold linger week so, used come go couple days. Tip: trust science gut feelings. Sorry, better way saying flu today descended virus caused Spanish flu... Sorry cheeky last time, doesn‚Äôt translate well internet General Perna good word, shots arms less 24 hours following final regulatory approval! great going tough hit 75% unless starts getting mandated employers something.

Similarly economy, simple leave everything open let everyone take personal responsibility. open people shop, told to, save economy. again, people get sick, hurt economy too. Score!!! guys think we'll start seeing number vaccinations given along new cases/hospitalizations/deaths? number going going give lot people hope. months?

Almost pandemic articles lack context left right. expected it. cannot vote reality great affect. work pandemic also damaging mental health *USA powers along thisisfine.jpg* completely fair though, taught seriousness situation. they're told (in district) masks required, student can't hold hands, water fountains can't used directly, student sanitizing hands.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* shouldn‚Äôt I‚Äôm saying. Especially comes science. Lol far know (Brazilian here), scheduled release interin data tomorrow, decided wait 23rd release complete trial data reverse discrimination order reason whatsoever. live Spain another EU country president minister health said expect 15-20M vaccinated late May June (that's everyone 50 35 45% total population) massive vaccination start mid late June, normalcy recovered summer.

I guess that's supposing everything goes well see Germany predicting suffering 2023 reduce deaths LOT vaccinating elders figure might higher, indeed. Plus others might lower. 

They measured differently... fact AZ trial measured everyone weekly asymptomatic cases others didn‚Äôt. quite important.

They incorporated dose difference thought might useful, was. trial supposed investigate things like that. 

It‚Äôs important also, one single person vaccine far severe case covid, imo that‚Äôs 100 percent success. Depends measure it. die, completely fine? Stick n move!!! literally evidence exist. infections common all. Jesus basic immunology/virology. can't believe specialist believes this. also PhD Microbiolgy way regularly work vaccine projects. Seriously. Kansas one first states (I think first, memory might bad) get 5g. rural area needs advantages 5g lower frequencies. (not confused speeds possible higher frequencies) This. First wave everyone comes together pitch help. 

But know curve flattened, idiots idiot leaders aren‚Äôt willing takes. ones sacrifice anything frontline workers.

So it‚Äôs surprise people means saying ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù quitting. manufacturing distributing mRNA vaccines much difficult adenovirus vaccines. latter also much cheaper. Oxford Johnson&amp;Johnson likely reach rural poor countries US counties Pfizer Moderna won't.

Having multiple tools toolbox helpful get widespread vaccination. reduce severity disease? Like Gerald joling said, 'alles gaat naar de klote'.

Also record, closed CT center temporarily due case/call overload. weird Trump administration turned horse betting 300M doses Oxford vaccine alone, 300M Moderna/Pfizer combined. would guessed ""America First"" crowd would bought literally everything could sold leftovers.

I suspect Oxford vaccine get approved US end, effective current studies issues.

On bright side, clearly good news citizens countries. everyone else problem kid gets sick mine..... -their reasoning Honestly, OP. I‚Äôm numb. It‚Äôs crazy many arguments I‚Äôve gotten friends, family loved ones I‚Äôm taking seriously. I‚Äôm ready vaccination put fact know people truly back pre pandemic idea kids spread highly infectious respiratory virus always insanity. surprising. much people recognize ugliness capitalism it‚Äôs ability create billionaires people also fetishized potential attained it. Even person made way cut throats subjugated countless others they‚Äôre still held disgusting high regard. 

Like not, many us don‚Äôt, brilliance billionaires inspires see elevate hand misplaced trust. show, variety ways like Gates, semblance care virtue resonating within them. However can‚Äôt count that...

I suppose point take vaccine freely demonstrates look toward guidance thing okay, somehow may provide pathway financial places billionaire inhabits.

Fucking capitalism... creating sense trust without question ruthless often untrustworthy. Kids walking talking germ spreaders. Every parent know touch everything. think otherwise thinking masks don‚Äôt anything. 

On every turn complete failure pandemic. We‚Äôre testing didn‚Äôt capacity test more. people getting sick. 

Have ever noticed number infections first wave incredibly low number deaths higher? less people felt sick suddenly fell ground?

No. It‚Äôs didn‚Äôt capacity test more. we‚Äôre still slowly expanding capacity according De Jonge. Please, inform yourself. better solutions lying. Total deaths total deaths. 

Don't sugar coat it. Yes, cock size one fingers. rich snooty teachers always telling kids brown kids good them, frankly I‚Äôm sick it!

/s much hate using Thank reading it! :) Schools open whole time.
I know people get idea children spread disease much experts still hold position day. think yesterday finally someone outbreak management team said schools main factor spread now. I'm pretty sure important thing measures extended closure schools coinsiding Christmas break.
We'll see month cause couple weeks numbers still bad cause everyone shopping today measures announced press leaks. far know submitted approval anywhere. interesting, could mean something. Okay. Praying (in way incredible infection risk!) God exist placebo, assuming believe God, effective God actually exists listens prayers. Placebo effectiveness less equal prayer effectiveness. consider praying acceptable medical treatment Covid19? Nice telling us masks might effective (and might cause harm good etc). wanted first responders healthcare workers masks. But, lied treated us like morons instead telling us truth.

Compliance mask wearing UK nearly high enough prevent virus. people wear nose, around neck, try get around rules ways. schools constant battle children wear masks hallways, required wear classrooms. 

From seen presented news media would believe Japan would higher compliance mask wearing. places people would require remove would restauarants bars eat drink might explain current driving force. less likely transmit disease sun down? taking walk night safer many people out? lot data extrapolation. US, need look SD, Oregon, Colorado extrapolate across US. middle east, look Iran, Pakistan, Qatar Iraq extrapolate that. Asia, China largely excluded due low community spread include Russia. Europe big question mark right Sweden's data reliable due real control measures can't extrapolate rest Europe. wave pattern hard come certain countries hit harder first wave second wave means greater chance reinfection time second wave comes along. 

50,000-100,000 come current model missing Africa, Oceania, large parts Southeast Asia due lack data. Privacy laws damned. media medical professionals profoundly failed world flooding airwaves pictures bodies every day. would made large difference.

You argue that's morally sound, maybe that's correct. can't argue I'm wrong. seem rather strange it. think way move past racism make race completely inconsequential. *black* woman helped create vaccine, scientist helped create vaccine.

It would unthinkable article state scientist race white, see different. 

This actually second time I've seen type thing. I'm pretty sure saw Instagram posts ZDF, German broadcaster, kept mentioning one lead scientists Turkish descent. fucking what? Turkish ancestry give special insight coronavirus? present scientist helped create vaccine? mention race? 5.27 say vaccine scarce, let anti-vaxxers believe whatever want to, unless work healthcare.

 fewer people get vaccine faster get mine. reality estimate probably flat lie.  imagine correlates higher rate intelligence. Every often someone brings word ""sonder"" defined something like ""the realization everyone else around rich life do"".

That word exists kind horrifies me. implies people walking around *haven't* realized yet.

I'm pretty sure overlap freaks chin mask idiots pretty high. least mask flavor obvious. hold turkish citizenship. thats wikipedia claims least.

and turkish absolutely irrelevant (and offensively wrong, [since identify case, especially since turkish government jack supporting scientists. anything impede them. germany raised talents, germany gets brag accomplishments. turkey.

All vaccines recommended get getting pregnant... Unless benefits way risks (Like, traveling high-risk area). 


Yes, breastfeeding pregnant quite different. drink 2 days ""skip"" breast feeding.. can't exactly skip day two pregnant. So, like vaccine, could get wait days work system, go back breast feeding. (If doctors think high-risk would system, any.. )  


With COVID, know long-term effects 'regular' people. studying pregnant women completely valid understand vaccine little more... even disease itself. high risk category, lot avoid getting it. also know long term effects COVID.  


We proof still get COVID taking vaccine, proof people vaccine gotten COVID looks like milder case. mean long-term effects still, long-term effects. 


I 100% agree waiting. choose risks body.. think fair potentially harm fetus ""study"" risks outweighing benefit... live potential side effects. Yeah, that's tricky -- someone high must anti-working home. Maybe ditch HR cc talk boss temporary thing. able get temporarily, quietly keep extending it. 

You know situation best -- hope make something work. can‚Äôt facts? Less year rollout? extensive long term effects stated? Why? don‚Äôt them. trust us headline says me. COVID. It‚Äôs everyone, got lucky. continue live life best without trail error vaccines might do. People don‚Äôt wear masks correctly need go jail. don‚Äôt think anything short pull heads asses. surveillance nightmare. Oh get jerks without risk killing one another Victoria flat wrong. ""we're dumb"", least directly. society built around kids school day parents go work. Kids home disrupts everything even already does. 

Exactly. society requires working-age adults spend pretty much every waking hour service corporations. Child-rearing conflicts that, require people send children institutional care pretty much starting birth. normalized treated nothing special - institutional care became unavailable.

Now forcing parents risk lives children's health keep children institutional care keep serving corporations. really healthy normal way live? count hand number confirmed US reinfections. Things rare known remotly considered serious potential medical risks worried Ugh realize ton senate seats 2022 right Cry river US lives y‚Äôall‚Äôs mind rent free post text. predicted last Monday would take two weeks reach level. took six days. US approve without US data. US trial still ongoing. Transmission schools elephant That's necessarilly problem here, articles say ""x first black person achieve x"" achievement usually thing one part society. sectors left go extremes things, point serves divide people. think happen displaced group starts get representation equality (which happen), attitude towards attaining equality change reduce all? starts look like things mentioned: nationalism, belief racial superiority, etc. Granted, think extremely far away that, specific figures, usually popular ones, represent extremes much harm public discourse ideas. ‚ÄúLA County Health Director Barbara Ferrer warned Monday ‚Äî hospitalizations 2,988 ‚Äî county could see statistic climb 4,000 within two weeks. happened six days.‚Äù


Holy shit. **The actual Austrian study make conclusion**. took long time find based info news article, preliminary result Austrian school ""Gargle Study"" German, Google Translate, prevalence data, analysis transmitted statistically significant difference Elementary schools middle schools / AHS lower level (P value = 0.812), well Students teachers (P value = 0.342).  prevalence differed schools high / index high social disadvantage schools lower / moderate index social disadvantage (odds ratio 3.58, 95% confidence interval 1.76-7.28, P-Value &lt;0.001.

The mean prevalence students 0.37%, teachers 0.57%, still low overall. merely reflect kids catching families? know. statistically significant result basically kids poor schools got Covid more. Shame media source uses clickbait misleading title usual drum fear here. like shipments next week. Jeez. shipments EVERY SINGLE WEEK. many millions. Within categories named, first come first serve would easiest, appointment slots vip slots (eg icu ward first dibs). hard - 160M votes, half 1 single day. plan one child, lockdown actually longest period time life since born colds flus God knows else. brought home every possible germ every possible place we'd ever go. used spend every fall/winter one disease another.

When people start yammering children ""can't spread COVID"", wonder ever seen child. sneezed upon one. reason asked infection rate is, say, 5-7 times reported case rate, ND SD would closing theoretical herd immunity threshold. iirc two cases merely close contacts Good God yes. want able hang friends again.

Chip me, Bill Gates. give asap possible. could like, mass incarceration pandemic? thought BIPPITY BOPPITY BOO. Please fastforward year don‚Äôt need read sex skin tone every accomplishment. fact is, vaccines prerequisite technologies developed lot advanced technology lot different countries. mRNA ones particular involved primarily people US, Germany, Hungary, Turkey, really scratch surface much work involved.  They'd move goalposts. ""It's here, happening outside US""

Every local news channel showing hospitals. Make hit home. everyone bitching recent mitigation efforts- driving them. think people think microchips vaccine believe everything like ""mark devil "" support anything like that?

But whatever do, would need fraud proof. ‚Äújokes‚Äù SAHMs somehow transposed onto every parent must use child care work.  *Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett (or Kizzmekia Corbett, Ph.D.) post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

*Alternative 3: Let infection happen, either slow fast, achieve hypothetical ""herd immunity"".*

Tegnell answered

*Yes, gone even ended [alternative] three. probably rather large silent spread would mean first two would probably work* Nobody ever said tuskegee experiment vaccinations, whole point guy said went head. People trust public health officials esp minority groups bc shit. experiment failure viable scientific.

idk mentioned affected public trust. believe you, source read that? ‚Äútells‚Äù us we‚Äôre less capable, it‚Äôs see

This line thought exactly keeps ""less capable"" feeling disappearing. Morgan freeman stance black history month could fix issue. Democracy working intended. trying use trick black brothers sisters Guinea pigs don‚Äôt fall ! dont that, either vaccine fine, one 94% effective one 95% way sports teams got testing wanted healthcare workers got even single test leads believe answer question 0. Sports teams first line pay. concern seem virus might remain active portions airways hard immune system reach, would suppressed elsewhere, symptoms. Basically would asymptomatic carrier.

The vaccine efficacy trials look - e.g. track anything positive tests symptoms developed - clearly understood right now.  MMR live vaccine. Live vaccines general recommended pregnancy. You‚Äôre free take risks, COVID MMR vaccines way alike compared. it‚Äôs worth, breastfeeding 7 month old hoping get vaccine pass antibodies since vaccines won‚Äôt approved babies awhile.

Pregnant women studied high risk category severe disease. wait longer results, unfortunately. stuff schools need include education. know true!! elaborated response another dude.

Hell could even learn Sweden matter. restrictions eased prematurely.

Asking questions fine. Seventh grade history teacher California. district testing mandate students. believe it‚Äôs 25% teachers get tested monthly. still haven‚Äôt tested since August. would it‚Äôs random name draw month.

Despite 100 quarantines 400 kids since went back person mid October (quarantines started happening first week November), 0 cases reported. I‚Äôve kids share they‚Äôre positive, parent said word. None. Currently 7 staff 30 out. really know schools spreading disease testing requirements kids. drive home work, see kids walking home friends, hanging Starbucks parking lot, playing basketball. work conservative area. Parents want schools shut even testing kids, know nothing. might even test kids. know someone household tested positive l, don‚Äôt get kids tested - especially it‚Äôs mild case. Parents sending kids school sick since forever. would different? singled set example kids may think make chance. like article's nuanced take problems science faced continues face here, weird headline conclusive. virus beaten yet. Fucking Murder Turtle Death Cult party. Uhhh reverse discrimination order reason whatsoever. Every western country star virologist right now. Dr. Fauci US, Prof. Dr. Dorsten (who actually specializes emerging virusses, warned Coronavirus two years ago today warns MERS) Germany, there's Dr. Raoult France ...

... specialists do. Sometimes, say darnest things. Dr. Raoult started recommend hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Fauci made comments masks effective, knew lie. Dr. Dorsten handled yellow press badly came around witchhunt (inspired German government officials). 

These highly educated professionals, infallible gods. Handling media main job.

I surprised Dr. Fauci - year saw civil war-like scenes major US population centers triggered racial issue - found useful show ""support"" singling one individual happens black. We've seen siminar things Germany, media went four-day reporting frenzy Turkish immigrants created vaccine (which later turned ... entirely truthful). 

Let's focus problem hand now, let mythbilding exploitation political capital happen afterwards. seriously favor removing constitutional rights like that? fuck? can't serious Isn‚Äôt clear? Sweden doesn‚Äôt want old people procreate make old people. 

/s plenty people U.K. won‚Äôt take vaccine.

The vaccine free here. health insurance may charged administration shot. don‚Äôt, still get it. mean Americans.most mankind dealt well this.  Every two days, US number new infections, Canada total entire year. earth day age, would anyone believe anything someone said telephone call?  even answer it, matter, unknown number? I'm gonna pretend Swedish strategy massive success, clearly hasn't, even among ten worst hit countries Europe (admittedly low bar clear, still). one talking lockdowns failed even though countries lockdowns much higher death rates Sweden. binary one might think. Yeah! county million people get 20k vaccines month posdibly half next. safe now... Great negotiating! /s.
In view, government signed months ago. least get plane line. Secure doses next tiers would need vaccine. authoritarian edgy stupidity, lmao. Btw. looked Sweden's second wave article referring to? peak 67 deaths, ~50 week. that, deaths even fewer SUMMARY: United States also expected begin doling doses vaccine Monday UK started inoculations last week. vaccine ‚Äúcan arrive anytime,‚Äù said Lucie Tremblay, director nursing health network manages Maimonides Geriatric Center Montreal, 15 died recent outbreak, according government data. ‚ÄúI dancing halls can‚Äôt even walk.‚Äù daughter Kitra Cahana, recently returned Montreal home United States could present father fell ill COVID-19, said hopes vaccine ends family‚Äôs constant worry safety.

You‚Äôre aware govt pretty much access emails data location etc please? might recall, CureVac company received enticement move headquarters early days pandemic.

Thats typically viruses mutate unemployment expansion portion CARES did, yes cock ring?? aren‚Äôt people wearing masks? One friends talk anymore said ""What goes Gates done?"" believe one reasons singled polls show African Americans less likely get vaccine minority groups. also likely bad outcomes become infected. see AA scientist involved creation vaccine, maybe likely get it. haven't, no. What's point? relevant? Thanks response. tried Google earlier, results CDC commericals. response, checked State State located some. thoroughly consistently incorrect. fact think article says anything vaccine approved plug pulled approval shows really grasping straws. But... are? Ex Presidents, billionaires like Gates, heads agencies going take streamed. less ""group x good, group bad"" ""person group also good.""

Singling directly - point members race participated group effort, government conspiracy give syphilis time. 

Also singling women color STEM part broader pattern encourage young girls give possible career. Much like Serena Williams tennis, talent transcends race. mean path easy we've ""solved racism."" hard work let reach goals. born Muslim heritage father Christian heritage mother ( never saw either one practice talk religion ). mother converted Islam still muslin side family would dish eat from. course religious beliefs, Koran. 60‚Äôs Middle East. might different now. haven‚Äôt since 78.

How mentioning harm anyone?

If Minnesotan highlighted Minnesotan part team, would harmful? but.... i've done everything did, i've kept denying virus real i've kept usual schedule ignoring basic higienic rules, wrong? ABC News disagree you.

They clearly think black women morons greatly surprised one competent.

What troubling people agree ABC News. difference make? Lmao. I‚Äôm pretty sure bunch people various races. It‚Äôs kind patronising single single black person wasn‚Äôt even one major players praise. Let‚Äôs praise people made thing. least articles like come closer truth American articles Sweden. blame directed politicians spent last decades gutting social welfare system profit. sub obsession making Tegnell bogeyman everything gone wrong (I even like guy pretending all-powerful evil mastermind ridiculous, guy advisor limited powers). better point fingers politicians caused situation Sweden, even pandemic, among lowest numbers hospital beds per capita Europe. Last week Sweden declined Norwegian offer help. willing read article going keep conversation going. Fun chart good one truly feel historic day country. people feel ""meh""? Genuinely curious. said one people helped develop it. also African American/black conference addressing concerns black community. 

Not long ago history conducted medical experiments black people. 

He asked something specific, addressed it. That‚Äôs it. cause stereotype exists black people inferior white people perpetuated. That's media wants fucking emphasize this. racist world, little reverse discrimination fucking order. think mean Garbage Pail Kid.

Who think insulting name trading card? infuriating. White House multiple opportunities months ago secure hundreds millions additional doses without putting money down. dawdled countries happy take spot line. they're talking July earliest additional vaccine. 

Currently US vaccinate 50 million eventually another 100 million companies presumably approved later. get remaining vaccines *more half country*? Unless something changes soon massive vaccination program US begins today kinda... stop springtime. Oh, he‚Äôs major reason we‚Äôre situation first place. taken seriously, base wouldn‚Äôt acted way actually complied.

People blaming lockdowns instead government supporting people financially like every country done. Ahahaha je hebt allemaal downvotes maar sorry ik zit te schuddebuiken nu. Tnx! CureVac starting phase III trials today think could five (western-bought vaccine) readouts next 4 months:

\- Oxford/Astrazeneca (USA): end year late January

\- J&amp;J: early end January

\- Novavax: late February late March

\- Medicago: early March mid April

\- CureVac: early March late April

If looking forward see results vaccines probably never bought western countries (which make enormous percentage sub), would readouts Sinopharm (full data), Sinovac, Sputnik V (full data), Cansino within end year. Bharat Biotech another possibility readout soon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- Dr. Bill Gates wanted volunteer, studies could find excluded breastfeeding women currently breastfeeding. option strategy now? Especially everything they've said done would combat strategy? strategy, come closed major events gatherings, told work home etc? key scientist Data phase III also delayed Brazil. mention know might developing covid, what? i'm potus call helicopter bring private hospital, people around world told stay home call hospital can't handle own. Maybe round everyone covid camps? move process along start building ovens deal stupidity? fans stadiums? Fa la la la la, la cough gasp la! can‚Äôt one telling I‚Äôm cherry picking numbers you‚Äôre still completely ignoring amount people tested week, arguably key number needed want make kind statement. Holyshit dude, can‚Äôt serious believe Covid exists

They outright believe COVID exist. think overblown justify social controls, mean... kinda looks like, fair I‚Äôve times. 

To get reach Climax first. explain Japan? 80% said wait see getting vaccine, even available? fair - worth pointing federal response vs. federal response March/April/May might help explain difference response (""*do everything nothing*""). Yeah, already asking would get vaccinated phase III results even published. would say yes vaccine without crucial information?

And even now, think still early. lot people want see people know getting vaccinated first hand try themselves. YouTube comments already toxic:

* B12 shot, Cuomo shape shifted entire time, like Lucifer.
* Fool
* I‚Äôve come across NEJM article stating vaccine contains desiccated parts ‚ÄúYersinia pestis‚Äù, stabilizer. true, isn‚Äôt genus responsible bubonic plague?
* Even vaccine devious, debatable. Statistically need vaccine soon. Obvious planned asking injecting ourselves!

Social media entertaining. going waves account side effects among staff? get vaccine... ffs. Enough, 2020. ENOUGH! Well school church part hasn‚Äôt changed expect would take rigorous measures. pleasantly surprised say. Saving lives prevails, however think need extra support measures businesses getting trouble lockdown. watch lot videos people walking around London youtube channel called ""Watched Walker"" (I know, lead thrilling life) videos Trafalgar square weekend blew away. crowds thick, like pre-pandemic height summer tourism thick. turn freaking out. Apocalypse closed, folks. Pfizer bear shoulda told front.  No, need infections placebo group.

Most waited till get like 150 infections placebo compare infections vaccine group know gene therapy could stop spread HIV. work? drugs done that? says similar found countries. think phases narrow. HCW, PSW, long term care retirement. 

Phase 2 would rest  Yes meant .5%. bad. 100% agree. cares anti-vaxxers world? long everyone else gets vaccine alright anti-vaxxers die off. sounds messed human race‚Äôs iq go up. people feel bad people raised anti-vaxxers environment therefore beliefs President Trump said need vaccine already got one. vaccine fairy broke house last night jabbed ass. Pythagorean kink theory. Phase 18 mean... mention US won‚Äôt getting stock Pfizer late June earliest. 

The vaccine doses coming Moderna aren‚Äôt even ready yet. Let alone received approval. 

If think you‚Äôre getting vaccinated healthy adult September 2021, bridge sell you. It‚Äôs little bit ironic approved German vaccine faster EU. There‚Äôs also movie really hope huge parties parades covid gone population WI? They‚Äôve done absolutely nothing curb spread anything lol assholes think it‚Äôs hoax ‚Äújust flu‚Äù ‚Äú1% chance dying‚Äù


I agree gotta protect dumbasses screw that. deserve seek. problem cell culture models, doses effective toxic.

Studies done, works petri dishes, doses needed possibly toxic. latest week, main point who's ahead, US always ""far ahead"" testing. points time rate similar. need, look hats certain logos and/or lack masks

... please remember know pfizer moderna vax protects asymptomatic mild case transmission know protects severe illness. even produce sterilizing immunity 95% population still 5% could get it, transmit it. Plus legit medical conditions unable vaccinated. relative wants get allergic reactions multiple vaccines past. Likely wait information different vax get one even tho high risk due age. I'm going keep masking people like even qualify people like relative. see meaning reversed here? full quote provides information essentially saying new variant similar others found countries... Damn really?? Ontario Phase 1 HCWs, PSWs, indigenous communities, 70 well everyone Long-Term Care Retirement homes. woulda thought state close us would something similar There‚Äôs really comparing Britain US favourably year, chief. We‚Äôre swimming shit soup. Yeah, get certain extent. Getting sick builds natural immunity, anything flu grade higher warrants couple days off. I'm starting see COVID vaccines roll world, effective they? get vaccine fear COVID stop wearing masks continue life like pre-COVID? still chance getting it, much lower?  German agency 27 km away BioNtech. involved even beginning development. German government decided European agency approve German one. Really stupid. DNA makes RNA makes proteins. There's reverse action RNA affect DNA. people intentionally refusing learn, won't. mean, 11 month retrospective already Damn puts wrench things. good answer without government support. know would though it‚Äôs pretty similar I‚Äôm now, except would Cali quality. Probably variety, speedballing psychedelic dissociative mishmash think limits many people meet home Northrine-Westphalia War never clean humane endeavor. Nobody comes sainthood intact. believe otherwise naive. unfortunately biggest spreaders often people deny virus serious selfish think well I‚Äôm young healthy probably won‚Äôt serious me. you‚Äôre worried 

I friend continuing go dinner parties bars clubs throughout whole pandemic. There‚Äôs way hell she‚Äôll line voluntarily get vaccine. read study find yet? though? enough vote out? next election? mean apply game theory - would FHM gain lying intentionally?

At first lie made grossly wrong statements, due fact grossly ignored situation information countries. lie save It‚Äôs character what‚Äôs usually relatively un-controversial ‚Äúlow key‚Äù public institution.

Don't rationalize much. try predict would happen character. Instead look happened, real. Ohio, atleast initial phase, maybe phase 1B Yes. accounts. HR said quarantining necessary say anything explained close contact. u/chrisms150 Thanks answer. guess makes wonder PrEP works? assume need body's immunity response work. till late fall. know sure. 

But expect distancing drop, masking, door activities become viable spring late summer. Although chopped mid sentence without ellipsis; reverse meaning. Yes ellipsis ""should"" used; although fact first word capitalized conveys similar information.

Seems grammar üöì police. He's talking hospital workers required work Christmas hospitals filling again. 

Does mental health matter you? Yes people (even comments) believe vaccines stop spread within next month. exhausting explain long actually takes. They‚Äôre Phase 1 though... majority population job luxury working remotely. Yes meant .5%. Still that‚Äôs 2 million fatalities factor today‚Äôs population. find crazy state shut down, essentially, March - May/June people suffered economic consequences so. seems now, nothing - Covid probably going get pretty bad next two months. shift almost everything nothing. governance. hard understand. I'm lucky live small Upper Valley town. mask compliance high, since April. strong hospital system (DHMC). also live socially distanced way normal times - southern NH seems like another world. average age spanish flu much lower, per capita death number higher. That's need know. 

How world disease kills fewer people (per capita) killing older folks younger folks, worse spanish flu decimated rural populations??? Trust say hopeful will. Unfortunately, many far conspiracy rabbit hole pulling going take herculean effort. control actions, I'm getting vaccine hope hundreds millions aamet. take advantage weather outdoor dining

too cold live larger state small population. Covid permanently closed 2500 small business middle November. 99% cases mild long term consequences even without vaccine, there's that. variant affect vaccine studies? mention this? Dude, I'm planning fear next time Well.... See couple years? thing proves masks protect people, much, situations, controlled scientific study topic. God damn really need better education country. 300 thousand? Already?

That escalated quickly. definitely see 400 thousand possibly half million.

My state announced ICU bed shortage connection rate soars. can't even reign Poland Hungary, cope pandemic EU then? idea allow socializing old discurage young reason  lot people early vaccinated going infecting unvaccinated... I‚Äôm going bash friend, mother stepmother sources. google claims it‚Äôs checking out. Surgery nurses ICU seem ones highest salaries. Surgery highest paid private sector ICU public sector. haven‚Äôt eat since February. family fully vaccinated waiting period passed, getting biggest plate nachos ever seen. fucking idiots Internet correct grammar....  eligable vaccine first phase. seem fit phase 2 ""Public Health Workers"" earliest opportunity. phase 2 start, clear document, forecasting Feb-April. I'm making excuses ignorance. trying explain possible line thought reasoning. happened long ago they're disconnected event hard feel effects lot people.

It's kind like people alive 9/11 born after. They'll view event completely differently. harder relate, experienced effects first hand. reason brain small. I'm well aware Sweden several rules place, there's explanation OPs point, FHM continues unique denial mask effectiveness.

Copy/paste subject discussed previously reasons stated masks adequately explain current stance -

-- wearing incorrectly: Swedes would follow instructions told wear use them.

-- false sense security: masks considered additional protection, measures, replacement, could also communicated, Swedes would listen.

Studies shown primary transmission occurs aerosolized accumulation virus, masks reduce, countries done well made masks one (major) element overall strategy.

Masks also shown provide protection wearer, well, baffling see continuing resistance, since proper mask usage could allow us better live covid, vs lockdowns, Sweden understandably trying avoid. July 1st US:

1. Restaurants, bars, movie theaters back 100% capacity across country.

2. Parties in-person gatherings allowed.

3. restrictions in-country travel. International travel somewhat restricted however, travel developing countries sufficiently vaccinated population discouraged prohibited.

4. Large events (such sports games, concerts, festivals) allowed, significantly reduced capacity (possibly 25%). need show proof vaccination attend them.

5. It‚Äôs somewhat common see mask use public, masking requirements largely dropped. main exception public transportation (such subways), masks still required. bad americans elected mitch mcconnell... First, thank answer. 

I understand vaccine arrived long ago, fact know answer simple questions ""Am healthcare worker?"" ""How get vaccine"" messy communication officials.  ‚ÄúUnless 70% U.S. residents get vaccine, nation reach level create herd immunity refuse shots, experts say‚Äù.

That‚Äôs fine, family part vaccinated it‚Äôs available group. choose vaccinated risk immunity reached. select can‚Äôt take vaccine due allergies adverse side effects, hands. actual stats young people underlying health conditions though? say hospitalisations decrease vaccinations vulnerable would suggest healthy young affected large.

You say ""any one person getting symptoms tragedy"" absolutely cannot keep restrictions like stop chance single person becoming seriously ill. Bear mind lockdowns restrictions costs (not talking economically). ""I hated Nazis!!""

As I, Dr. Jones! get fed up... find $600/mo rent? kind housing would provide? kind space? Parents also love send sick kids school.

 
From K-12 missed like three days school. mom even work day, believe missing school unless literally dying. 100% sure kid got COVID parents would make go. ""superspreader"" could anyone care home residents, staff member, visitor Santa clause.

Or may superspreader all. 

If read report, spread like likely occur airborne transmission, handwashing, distancing masks would made little difference. could made difference better ventilation, left list. subreddit painful participate in. I'm definitely anti vax American rushed vaccine long term research kinda ok question? Like happens 5 10 years time taking vaccine 1918 USA maybe 1/3 current population. going bad little worse allowed run population everyone freaking virus? People die, can‚Äôt save all. overpopulated weak. Let virus take weak links strengthen species. breeding p*****s spending billions keep alive. fighting nature. wild, weak die.

Do need re-iterate? Natural selection. (EU UK) said negotiations go December 31... added disaster many Dutch businesses idea import export regulations January 1 onward. stimulus would help. $1200 california get half month's rent. Ah cmon /u/DauntlessVerbosity idea he's talking about. clearly misread source panicked, tried explain away using CFR context one else planet uses it

Honestly indicative low level discussion sub post removed. mods seem reward poor reasoning skills put community I'm getting vaccine anytime soon. Maybe years road  said standard living, quality life.

But since mention life expectancy Lets take look HDI. Life expectancy, education income: meaningless data point without context. Especially use anchor labels like discussion thread. prez said they‚Äôre ‚Äúpractically immune.‚Äù poorly stated. think meant longer beds available, thus losing beds. mayor Mol Wim Caeyers told VRT visit ""made best intent, went wrong"".

Yes, went wrong. stupid, never happened. look full list. 18 countries Africa carribean average IQ threshold what's considered mental retardation (67). really shows problematic measure is. first batch going healthcare workers nursing home residents, notified organizations. Community vaccination start time yet. Wrong bitcoin isn‚Äôt governor work big-box store masks end February IIRC yes people would hoard masks IMO.  would rather follow FAQ page official updates matter. providing something credible BILD tho lmao. strange Sweden critical posts always non-swedish sources posted hours Swedes usually asleep, can't reply claims... There‚Äôs lot outbreaks workers moving across borders construction argri work. point European borders point shut strict quarantine way would possible elsewhere. market interlinked open borders part trade. metropolitan areas higher number counties tightly linked together economic, social, commuting relationships vulnerable pandemic outbreaks.  

Oh really, seems like refute findings.   authors conclude higher county population, higher proportion people age 60 up, lower proportion college-educated people, higher proportion African Americans associated greater infection rate mortality rate.   

So parse finely enough conclude density related higher population. would hard-pressed find American, black white, knows anything Tuskegee experiment, anything history general.

This disproven articles linked. second article states ""Of original 1133 respondents interviewed, 57.2% (95% CI = 54.3%, 60.1%) indicated heard Tuskegee Syphilis Study data probes combined."" justified counter might awareness enough prove knowledge study. Luckily, study provides even data, ""Of Blacks study, 42.5% heard presidential apology (95% CI = 27.3%, 47.8%) 34.8% knew President Clinton given apology (95% CI=29.9%, 40.0%).""  

One might say results skewed respondents polled proximate areas original experiment took place. That's fair; sampling bias definitely thing. first article linked shows polling individuals New York City, Baltimore, San Juan aware Tuskegee Syphilis Study 48.8%, 40.9%, 21.8% rates respectively. 

The two studies show different levels awareness leave Alabama; nevertheless, provides strong evidence statement ""hard-pressed"" find someone knows ""anything"" Tuskegee experiment. Great! Isnt Trump also taking credit somehow? news NL let us Euro loving Brits time soon? Brexit disaster, everyone knew would February typically peak flu season. biggest holidays year next couple weeks. seems stimulus coming help people stay home. Hence stories moving refrigerator trucks Miami El Paso. may read stories, covered. Increase people‚Äôs salaries FFS. underpaid almost everywhere world. It‚Äôs travesty. distribution partner fucks sake. We‚Äôre manufacturing, distribution, ones responsible clinical trials producing data needed get approval. Get facts straight stop spreading misinformation. COVID didn‚Äôt things either mean, average American, get pretty used world telling you, ‚Äúfuck you, deserve nothing.‚Äù 

If ever see dose Covid vaccine person, consider lucky. someone get tested autoantibodies? mom somehow got acute pancreatitis two weeks covid, fatigued still agree Muslims? course saving lives prevails, say otherwise. side coin, businesses also deserve help survive. started offer rapid tests people symptoms help stop rise. live one badly hit areas, test centres really way get to! need able pluck people main high streets markets. even extra compensation here, say 2000? enough 95% businesses.. covers maybe 1,5 days us open. That's bit non sequitur. poorly due virus tracers trying prevent spread of? Winter hasn‚Äôt even officially started yet It‚Äôs simply I‚Äôm American lol people I‚Äôd truly consider truly American native Americans try move goal post extreme way. Nobody talking ""quality life"". wealth. 

And yes, Italy lower quality life Sweden. life expectancy literally higher. I'm sure logistics go well efforts contain virus. De grafieken op het RIVM worden minder goed geupdated dan de cijfers die via nieuws en de politiek zelf te horen krijgen. Waarin het nieuws stabiel dagelijkse cijfers te spuwen heeft, heb ik geen idee hoe ik dat kan zien op het RIVM. 

Ik betwijfel heel sterk je hier een punt hebt maar er zijn voor mijn perspectief teveel dingen die het RIVM doet qua transparantie dat uitnodigt voor complotdenken. next week important especially retailers. Christmas shopping makes lot sales. hope retailers like parents pull get financial help might need. right US government running like well tune machine, zeros issue scandals everyone working together betterment everyone else, nothing calendar upcoming pressing interfere breeze roll finely tune machine. like negative connotation comes American? saying ""I'm swiss"" makes better regular American? makes wonder editorial purpose is.

You might missed it, Tegnell told everyone cared listen, lock downs masks ridiculous, unscientific, populism effect. Pretty obvious purpose tell Tegnells believers fact proven wrong. exodus healthcare workers would front page stuff too. not. either massive conspiracy among local media silence (Remember, local media exactly uncritical pandemic handling), or.... something else going on.

What mean ‚Äúhere too‚Äù? think front pages around world? Spoiler: it‚Äôs not. Swedish media fact incredibly uncritical. swede might notice, foreigners following Swedish media shocking see. things Swedish front pages: Tegnell making provably false claims. Still seen several articles issue hospital nurses doctors quitting. I'm thinking directed towarsds local audience 

No shit Sherlock. Yes, articles Australian newspapers primarily directed local audience. should‚Äôve thunk. incredible conspiracy uncovered. journalism worst, time need best.

A hypocrite statement Swede defending Tegnell strategy promoting shit. World rate detected deaths 10000 per day, doubled since October.

The unknown worst yet worst overall. It‚Äôs individual protection. It‚Äôs impact lowering infection rates.

Grocery workers frontline essential workers. encounter hundreds people every day, especially high risk need shop feed themselves.

Sure grocery workers probably won‚Äôt die it, they‚Äôre much likely contract contract it, much likely spread someone might kill. That‚Äôs particularly true they‚Äôre asymptomatic. 

By vaccinating them, you‚Äôre targeting individuals may act super spreaders. said Corbett's role one scientists behind vaccines sign hope Black Americans hesitant trust vaccine.

if black, would find condescending.

like, ""for black people dumb understand, wanted let know fact black person worked it, everything going fine"". get downvoted speaking truth haha place pathetic. Hell language interesting?

In UK say ""I'm going hospital get jab.""

In USA say ""it's hoax, good health insurance anyway."" So, uncle everything right still caught it? tell you? Seems like know lot world people, start writing sci-fi books. Uh US Sweden every point time. They've performed 16,250,000 million tests Sweden's 320,098 Like hey making vaccine like ever totally safe... we're still testing it.

Oh hey approved, wayyyy *wompwomp* Ah, number new cases per day doubling consequences all. Great analysis. /s Yeah wow 200 cases yesterday must awful number one candidate, one developed home abandoned last week returned false positives HIV. caused problems..But got money one horse. already started production Oxford uni one Melbourne. Plus ordered quite bit pfeizer Modena ones.

In all, immediate rush covid left two countries found returned travellers hotel quarantine settings... start vaccinating March Oz, sure NZ. got it? Yeah, let someone testing bunnies ppl take whatever is. U U U wrong Internet. lol Let's hope he's wrong. first time. parents small business, biding time till Christmas since revenue way already though time paying bills. pretty devastating far deaths democratic states... even close Incorrect, amount beds taken steadily declining last couple weeks (Source: [RIVM ‚ÄúIn ziekenhuis opgenomen pati√´nten vanaf 27 it‚Äôs also worth noting amount beds taken still lower flu season back 2018.

I guess it‚Äôs politics (left vs right), goes. taken account, it‚Äôs also worth considering whether huge amount damage economy, mental health, education aspects worth relatively deaths Covid taken bring. 

So far, 9733 people died due Covid (even though people die different reason Covid time considered Covid victims), 64% older average life expectancy Netherlands.

Now it‚Äôs whether say it‚Äôs worth destroying lives 17 million people protect thousand older average person Netherlands anyway. Yes, however necessary might be, hit many businesses hard. Let's see extra compensation possible... EU Schengen different things. Uh pandemics 1918

It's amazing uninformed sub want taste smell back it‚Äôs coming 3 weeks  Gulf States quite quick indeed. may forgotten Saudi Arabia fact. Lmao clearly never Nordic countries

Why people think bluff nonsense Bullshit article. many reasons 70% could go unanswered.
Maybe massive spam problem UK, people block unknown callers.
This would need given context, otherwise article mean anything.

Also, percentage people hanging cooperating answering would required. Check post history stereotyping door homie. Yikes vaccine shipped Belgium Canada UPS. 

UPS's North American air hub Louisville, KY. amount lives? [quite different patterns temperate regions know since pointed threads, obviously Aftonbladet want sound juicy possible also take context (as well newspapers). I'm saying mortality always grows year. I'm saying previous year lower, following year absolutely higher bunch people 'overdue' death. make sense project even lower following year.

I'll dig link cdc

If look geographical similar countries (longitudinal etc) notice rises peaks. That's indicator seasonality Anyone know timeline vaccine availability general public? part disputing exactly?

It's interesting let kinds dogshit get posted actual objective facts removed Guaranteed white lmao going get worse? good lord. Heard Canadian news morning Trump backed tweeted nobody would get WH... mean much end... might another lie... yet thread ""but group x good, group bad""

It's hilarious. care finds cure covid. killing people right now, North Korea places ones find make available...

Covid doesnt care ""teams"" ""groups"" - covid one team, insisting ""their team"" work smarter helping. Black African-American easier say ‚ÄúDecendent 
Tribal Members Transported Colonizing Caucasians New World Slaves‚Äù personally okay it. 

...but let‚Äôs get bogged semantics, mmkay? medical community horrific history experimenting anyone think get away with, including women, white citizens military. reason ANYONE trust medical community whole.

We need massive campaigns targeting entire population. Lol, give people option stupid make bad decision, inevitably do. literally read newspapers back see yes did

Stop thinking echo chambers making informed part disputing exactly? 

If everyone followed rules we'd much better situation now. Gettysburg count casualties, deaths. Casualties include wounded. First vaccinations March continue rest year. Plans fully open borders late 2021 proof vaccination. truly believe Greece Italy standard living Sweden, I'm really sure say change mind. conclude live completely separate universes. 56 years ago African Americans second class citizens denied basic human rights? acknowledge traditionally excluded part population make noteworthy contributions.  Herd immunity never Swedish strategy increasingly annoying sub continues claim ever ?

These quotes actual email conversation Tegnell colleague.

FHM claimed conversation deleted, author upcoming book Sweden's strategy, named ""Flocken"" (The Herd), got conversations recipient Tegnell's emails.

Google Translate:

FHM's early strategy herd immunity

An email came Peet T√ºll, former head National Board Health Welfare's infection control unit, job state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell took T√ºll retired. There, T√ºll wrote three strategies stop epidemic.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†The first total shutdown society four weeks.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The second track infections large scale, find infected close contacts put two-week quarantine.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†The third option was: ""Allow spread infection, slowly rapidly, achieve hypothetical 'herd immunity'.""

T√ºll advocated alternative two pointed alternative three appeared headless strategy.

Anders Tegnell replied: ""Yes, walked landed 3."". ""I meant sense also Turkish citizens are.

My point global endeavor""


That's exactly doing. pathetic. aunt works daycare home elderly wanting vaccine. I‚Äôm going get call fun conversation /sigh me. matter bad vaccine might be. That's huge might. virus far dangerous far less discerning picks. defining ideology? wherever blood from. people proud turk anyone proud heritage. doesnt mean hate anyone. im proud swiss chinese heritage. dont reject american culture i'm simply american lol reading comments post, seemed like they're contesting real topnotcher is. Like, damn, significant numbers. please, make look like 'winning number'.

I'm halfway around world, fully sympathize US what's happening pandemic there. Lost two buddies disease, hopefully fucking bullshit end soon rest us.

Please wear mask, social distancing, everything help others need help. can‚Äôt believe people even upvoted you. article (which take didn‚Äôt read) wasn‚Äôt even virus itself, economic impact virus.  swear site full morons. think Feltis lost opposed income tax? Sweden rich country. high GDP, goes 1%. Look wealth distribution, Sweden Greece Slovenia level. 1. Case fatality doesnt say anything many people per capita died. says many people died tested positive.

2. Oh sorry, part comment wasnt aimed specifically you, understand sounds like that. agree Q followers. defended ideology. ""Probable shithole""?


The irony strong. first i'm switzerland arguably better every way country live now. yes, family spend thousands years living country assume new identity moved america. many cases people testing positive delay testing positive there? Speculation science.

 agree genomic sampling isn‚Äôt way loser. Lol I'll repost since automod* considered word put uncivil 


There unfortunately two extreme sides witness real life.

1. vaccine coming ever get vaccinated within next weeks. mentality honestly probably cause cases rise people letting guard down.

2. side hard core pessimists* think cases get literally zero every single person earth vaccinated need lock prevent people ever socializing.

Both takes luckily minority extremely dangerous opinions hold could lead issues line. Lol answered question twice already Nationality science rarely simple. I've never seen lab anywhere everyone working country. also need factor move around lot, person 1 may German, got Phd California, person 2 Chinese, got Netherlands, person 3 Finnish studied Japan, etc. on. 

One main minds behind bioNTech vaccine Katalin Karik√≥, Hungarian, lot research US starting work company Germany run Turkish immigrants distribution deal UK company. 

Attempts boast nationalities labs made vaccine always end looking silly reason. ""the germans actually turks"" ""also"" sure, one looking excuse offended. wonder get tired saving asses? Lol Oh shit! Lol! Can‚Äôt wait! Actually every damn episode funny shit, stuff that‚Äôs relevant later. üôå

But yeah man? heard 4kids version killed competing Naruto US. yeah man, there‚Äôs one youtuber gets deep philosophical/political means writer Oda putting OP. youtuber talks Pirates v Land People ‚Äútwo types people‚Äù world. Pirates free risk everything, whereas land people content often get raided pirates. Yeah man check Mr Morj YouTube OP reviews. 

Yeah man, enjoying lot looking forward character you‚Äôre talking about! Stay safe! üò∑ü¶†üôå  one lone CDC dissenter think vaccinating nursing home residents good idea: agree. Realistic great keyword. true Scotsman fallacy didn't. used term ""also"". made perfectly clear making point international effort.


You're bitching nothing. presume enjoy chance ""offended"". Nick Cannon‚Äôs career also took huge hit saying awful comments. see significant backing? saw significant (and rightful) backlash! 

How cancel culture popped due issues? Cancel culture product social media would say. 

And right UK amount racial tension, again, history United States treated black people complex, sad, filled injustice, plight many black communities today impacted that. know black people probably didn‚Äôt great past UK too, I‚Äôm commenting USA since know USA. USA also much significant population UK, think makes easier get tension. Furthermore, looked black people make 3.4% UK versus 13% USA. 3.4% certainly visible amount, big comparison 13%. country gave education social network immigrate into, rather probable shithole flee draconian regimes... wow, wow  Well, younger 55 likely vaccines give 90%+ protection. get from? here. parents 60+ decided stay home Christmas. buy 80‚Ç¨ whiskey bottle try best would stun anyone? Assholes packing certain bars mask less whole pandemic.

I guess principled leaders really believed you, rather lead, gave people freedom personally responsible, consequences would weed bad ones, eventually whole, liked-minded fellow Americans norm would right thing agree neo-nazis nationalists? better education system too. camp you. guy adamant Turkish heritage reason, one called it. Singapoor. likely 90% done right 62% is

Explain. looks like 62% likely - people group ages. 90% group participants older 55. getting vaccine?, thought bleach UV light going work I'm really confused here. Imma head out. I'm happy. entirety germany finally going full lockdown Wednesday, Vaccines hopefully approvaed end month. Things get better like this. absurd consider huge vaccine-hesitancy among American blacks. virus makes many victims community, important trust vaccine. didn't. Hence word ""also"". Whose ego? reason Oxford vaccines delayed slump infections summer. spring lockdowns worked well couldnt get necessary data second wave. Please provide sources this. I'm hard time imagining situation actually happens knowledge pay. BioNTech, mention ""creators"" Turkey. Reality part large team it, selected socially accept diversity everything. post. Brainwashing. Outside sub private expereince much ridicilous takes this. 
Expert opinions really getting media causes most.

Of course people active read vaccination news different take. feel like really missing general public. Could good considering people rush partying sudden. Could also put unnecessary fear people. end misinformation imo. OH must safe! They‚Äôve never said something good, bad before! wanna first line!  Well someone made issue quite time. they're german, theyre turk lol. scientific achievement dont want known country live in, want country heritage. blood identified country live in, generations given genetics. year ago understood hell said.

Now I'm like 'yep'. hard people understand people don‚Äôt trust government. They‚Äôve never wanted ‚Äúbest‚Äù us. believe that, travel China see yourself. don‚Äôt trust rushed trial. don‚Äôt trust long term effects don‚Äôt know yet. don‚Äôt trust flat telling I‚Äôm going get said so? Lol sadly mistaken. Along whole part America, getting this. Feel free roll dice remind 1 year holding it. Thanks! Sinopharm‚Äôs. Wind neck in. issue all. don‚Äôt get it. headline? closeup disease itself, [this video](/r/collapse/comments/fat0z1/so_this_is_what_true_collapse_sounds_like/) posted back end February captures sound entire city despair. nobody did. soap box reason. Even required wear one, imagine keeping room full 3 year olds sanitized masked... article makes sound like one lead scientists actually invented created vaccine

that's point think would tend agree scientist created Vaccine politician medical science degree, glad live Florida form degradation seen socially acceptable progress, one day change though id hope. Several countries eliminated COVID within borders. everywhere else took actions, yes would be. 

At least, every nation health system equal better Vietnam's able set COVID-free travel bubble now. gave scale elimination would possible. Oh no, already fake news stuff black hole image.  important mention 'an African American woman'? 1. Sweden worse case-fatality rate.
2. never said Sweden anything. said opposite come previously. people saying Sweden anything Q followers believe Covid holdong Sweden ""proof"" covid fake. outside much skippy? Maybe need get fresh air get away screen. Yep! OB impervious mask sliding nose point her.. yikes! There's time people left. Nurses doctors getting tons OT multiples still volunteer Covid wing.

People can't feel social/economic fatigue, embrace ""don't care, hospitals prepared, live life"" mentality, throw curve sky high. could lack representation field race. Counter example: Asians Indians issues doctors relatives family friends doctors give first hand assurance safe. ""What doctor know biology, s/he even &lt;skin Let be. It‚Äôs bad identify Germans, it‚Äôs totally fine force others see Turks. yes, selling announcement vaccine quite unusual... Swede. Lol How‚Äôs everybody doing? epidemiologists said this? kids grade 6 become significant vector transmission? physiological difference exists 5th 6th grader explains this? Hours part pretty much 
entire related scientific world focused it, mostly funding (no delays obtain funding, money available immediately needed, phases ran time despite risk first phases successful, manufacturing approval hope works etc) pandemic speeding results ( delay trying find volunteers, people placebo group getting ill quicker get statistically significant results massively faster) black people

You subject Tuskegee experiments? Agreed want world stop seeing color, need stop making big deal accomplishments ""colored people"". Nothing accomplishment relation vaccine anything ""African American"" probably even matter woman. posterity sake, we've always said male/female news reportings. However, often see ""White American"" front things white American men women's notable accomplishments? stop reporting someone's race, matter. Provided hiccups along way seems quite likely. psychological part pandemic end medical part ends dont think understand point. problem guy rejected german identity offensive part. strictness restrictions differ much Norway Denmark

That absolutely false. March 12, Norway issued stricter measures instituted quarantine entered country. day, government closed kindergartens schools, physiotherapists, psychologists, hairdressers, swimming pools training centers, banned sporting cultural events organized sports, including children‚Äôs sports  chose different strategy: Kindergartens, elementary schools, training facilities businesses kept open, children‚Äôs sports continued. High schools universities closed March 18, March 29, Swedish government applied general rule assemblies 50 people Sweden restrict border crossing. next-level whataboutism. 2019 bad even remember. Yeah, would probably get vandalized ""memed"" death people brought crisis actors Sandy Hook reunion.  Keep Inslee mouth. taught, caught something every fall lingered ears, nose, throat spring break. I'm pretty sure worked year, I'd already dead.

If kids school, responsibility women. (And men. Someone coach maskless football.) Bring oranges, pineapples, apples. Dark colored, rich fruits. 

I'm kidding. get paid worth crap. Spring organic stuff. Keep healthy. offensive reject rest identity. Gonna enjoyable christmas year. CZ tried ease restrictions, opened bars restaurants on. 

Now, two weeks going close again. 

Fuck. climate change generally accepted scientific community? Hmmm recently I've felt like people sub agreed May-June range mostly done USA pretty obvious seasonal, mainly time spent outdoors think. virus seemed slow time people spent outdoors.

The restrictions came late last time paid heaviest price it. Also, end wave came much later due closing businesses. get adter seeing happened anything differently time around? Especially hospitals full. clear restrictions deployed help enough, compliance pretty shit based see pictures crowds cities. anybody answers racism?
Legit question.

Do really want answer one? Man‚Äôs best friend! 

Now train dog sniff Covid instead dog‚Äôs butts. Yes that's helpful let's graph based people say. ""Many people saying"" Trump likes put it. source 50% claim? Everything I‚Äôve read looking hardest hit areas like NY, Sweden didn‚Äôt mitigate spread, none reached higher 10%. Also know people reinfected months. Furthermore know vaccine stops sickness may stop asymptomatic spread, prolly still wearing mask. underlying conditions I'd stay contact doctor. Otherwise anticipated general population earliest would access April.  would true vaccine 100% effective. Unfortunately, one ""only"" 95% effective. Stop talking, people dying There‚Äôs cruel irony advanced well. COVID hit Spanish Flu did, would likely far lesser effect. average life expectancy would far less now. amount fatal cases would likely far less virtue COVID 19 disproportionality killing 70. wondering this, especially instances one person household gets sick others not. going discover certain genetics make people susceptible others virus? Might help us tailor treatments and/or precautions future. Covid-19: two week recovery general.
Mental health: months years Hence ""Theoretically"", also Vaccines work pretty differently most. received death threats /r/losangeles supported outdoor dining ban...

that subreddit mocking Orange County anti-mask protests Especially since US government certainly releasing full numbers since July took responsibility away CDC London going lockdown due new strain.

One major lesson here, guy first thread made quote claiming new variant, posts pretty reasonable, everyone started parroting him. one actually read article.

If see things like problem sub, well, can't make you. also cant make realize many things many people say immediately contradicted.

Truth hurts post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Crazy getting downvoted... sub sometimes man isn‚Äôt. changes time vaccine needs changed every year. see. Yea. hope so... got steam library catch XD I‚Äôm thinking closer July-August see big slowdown vaccine indeed work intended Imma takin pills!! think also misinformation can‚Äôt spread you‚Äôre asymptomatic kids asymptomatic. less likely spread without symptoms asymptomatic spread huge incubation period symptoms show exactly dangerous. You‚Äôd idiot think significant asymptomatic spread. miss old History Channel ... nothing speculation Hitler came *this close* winning WW II, morning noon &amp; night XD goalposts. football game. Nobody moved anything. experts saying life goes back normal late 2021, obviously it‚Äôll gradual return them. aren‚Äôt 3 4 months away normal. Nobody saying that. good old Americaphobia nothing more


People act like 1000 weirdos make statistically significant amount people post lot. Thank everything you‚Äôve done mess, I‚Äôm sorry jackasses making experience even harder you. talking raw numbers important percentages /s 

People get swayed numbers way much like people saying Biden legimate president US history got votes. like let's ignore voter turns outs percetage vote got raw numbers biggest they've ever history. There's way population keeps going year year mean mention similarity? Lol since there's consensus exact number misleading worthless. people say 60-80%. Rippling, powerful muscle. Like nobody ever seen.   Divide would indicate real split. bit 60% willing take NOW.

Those board quickly come around denial longer option. ICU beds run regions non-covid related deaths start mounting predicted months ago experts ignored, posturing shift panic; hopefully vaccine toilet paper.

Always count self preservation avenues reason fall apart. compared what, long term effects getting actual Covid 5 - 10 years? Either way, old old.

It's unfortunate, people die. Got vaccine today. Never wearing mask Grandfather's father older brother died 1918 Flu Pandemic. died week apart.

I little memorial pin belonged Grandfather; small brooch containing photo brother. Good looking young man. think you‚Äôre confused I‚Äôm saying, I‚Äôm saying locking winter going lot easier mentally considering isn‚Äôt much winter anyways. mean flu vaccine developed yearly millions take 20 million vaccinated END YEAR. Apparently cost individual's right decide put body ones comorbidities pass away vast majority people recover? That's exactly I'm doing. I'm continuing listen people sub armchair experts moving goal posts since day one.

The new normal people grasping straws can't continue doubt vaccine, immunity lasts 3 months, say vaccine safe, covid magically going mutate control, we'll dealing 2022, 2023, 2024 etc last thing harp logistics vaccine delivery, experts everyone involved vaccine already considered working on. Colorado healthcare workers getting starting today. Hey, come EU. plan make vaccine available 29th December country still give free. So, probably Germany start vaccinating month UK. sucks really hard. no? variant factually contagious previously dominant strain, means newer variant contributing community spread. time, vaccines still work it. 

Not sure things simultaneously true confusing ‚Äútrying make sound worse.‚Äù One preclude contradict other. Context matters. think two related, UK tiered system, regional approach whole country restrictions. We've seen cases rise exponentially therefore we're going put toughest restrictions, whilst parts country likely restrictions loosened. put simply, ‚Äúvariant‚Äù individual level ‚Äústrain‚Äù population level agree. want everyone world needs vaccine it, news comes it, appears administration playing around. dealt pandemic along. flu season (and similar viral illnesses) peak February (and recent years even march-april). mass congregations, always indoors activities spreading family friends often stay close contact winter inside. No, per capita basis.  feel like I've also seen information saying vaccine shown reduce severity COVID, least there's that. Essential workers get vaccinated spring Former elementary teacher here. can't tell many times 14 years teaching kid got sick class says, ""I feel good yesterday mom gave medicine told come school."" try call parent either number wrong answer (because leave work get kids, get fired). even AMLO , trump ally covid denier got  check secured vaccines Mexico. another level stupidity negligence. way gets approved current state. CI well 50% efficiacy, 3 accounts TM botch job trials Democrats don‚Äôt like strategy Republicans like it. journalists going laser focus guys find every fault possible point out. Welcome American politics. already data Trump times GOP relied rapid testing.

A positive covid test like pregnancy test. Taking pregnancy test won‚Äôt protect getting pregnant. pregnant show positive early stages. Taking pregnancy test isn‚Äôt practicing safe sex. need condom birth control (though still need condom STDs aren‚Äôt monogamous relationship) need choosy partner(s).

The results study moot. doesn‚Äôt matter finds. Good results give us false confidence. Prior civilizations knew way survive pandemic stop large group behaviors like this. People can‚Äôt mingle. End story. live music industry lost billions dollars year sabotaging public health trying bring back 70% population vaccinated. That's fatigue reaction vaccine, long term impacts reduced load Covid.
  
Please listen people stuff like this. Lack evidence mean didn‚Äôt happen fuck head. private clinics staffed well connected fixers. israel made earlier year chinese vaccine despite used trials. someone money product sold work out. kinda already does. Per article, stage 2 includes people living communal settings (e.g. migrant workers, prisons) essential workers, lot outbreaks happened groups lot persistent, unavoidable close contacts due work living situations. nothing science lmao. Doctors pandering pharmaceutical companies nothing science like medical doctors nothing creating vaccine 95% time (unless MD+PhDs) worst states get vaccine first? Kinda like NFL draft. Yeah... attempts misdirection never end.

It's ""I shot him"" vs ""I shot self defense"".

If spent year denying shot someone, put witness stand changed story ""I shot self defense"", jury would probably laugh you. plans ever taking consider (when) employment threatened. hospitalization rates also falling, that's confuses me. 750 square foot 1 bedroom $475 month midwestern city circa 2012ish. Wasn‚Äôt greatest neighborhood though. Also 2 bedroom around 1000 square feet 800 city years ago. also forget majority canada rural areas... Prove dumbshit. Show evidence. Hell, better start showing politicians they're options too. 

Objectively, proof. Said SCOTUS many many many judges make actual decision based evidence. 

Fucking idiot. remove bias, LA county going provide accurate representation CFR IFR. Since testing infrastructure #1 America nearly every single case caught, time Covid control we'll see bad get scale accurate data points unlike NYC March/April point despite improvements healthcare, transportation, communication, we‚Äôre better 100 years ago. one would‚Äôve predicted we‚Äôd succumb greatly Minus ‚Äúe‚Äù, apparently so.  article September. Things changed significantly since then. Bro - many people recovered vs many people died? ‚ÄúAll people taking part sex party French‚Äù Yes agree, masks distancing last least another decade. [This 0.8%. That‚Äôs happening behind scenes. like reinfections

Reinfections extremely rare though. Probably less 100 cases globally. Booger! That's problem. mandated one one wants ones wearing masks. exact thing happened Denmark masks mandated, ONE would wear masks one wanted first reason. mandated EVERYONE started wear mask. Sweden government leaves ""to people"", never happen.  I'm sure know means. Every teacher know! providing evidence contrary, instead appealing people's emotions desire intellectual superiority. nice. erecting memorials? 

Maybe people would wear mask knew body ended up. Lol would think fear death would enough. No. don't, I'd like see numbers (spoiler: made up)

But here's legit source: clearly aren‚Äôt listening experts. Source: Dude trust  ask wrong care correct first place. 

I agree Sweden alot things wrong. base assumptions facts, fifth hand sources. I'm talking grand two. I'm talking people drop 50k way spend $1 soda. dunno man, grew Newfoundland west coast northern peninsula seemed like side world. Small town thinking best lol  limping finish line point. like ending Spielberg film. purpose getting COVID-19 vaccine still adhere COVID-19 mitigation procedures (mask, sd, frequent hand washing, etc)? Genuine question. 

Could still get spread virus vaccine? so, won‚Äôt wearing masks forever everyone medically get vaccines? not, would still need follow protocols?

I‚Äôm assuming high efficacy vaccines immune getting sick Covid-19. Really concerned spreading it. area state almost like North Massachusetts wonder many potentially party more? Way easier go class hungover don‚Äôt leave bed. mention social contact aren‚Äôt getting normally probably lead seek out. curious bottlenecks beyond distribution. Let's say actually ship many quickly. Let's assume immediately administered.


Has info released quickly usa get vials injected? supply issue, many could injected daily? bottleneck? need enough nurses focused months end - spoilage, watch side effects, etc.


Otherwise, could quickly situation vaccines shipped weekly administered. Good. people refuse faster get one  think Fauci trying reduce mass panic much possible point health, social economic reasons. many people losing possibility past normal might return within time frame desire. They're ready accept much coming back. example, industries jobs never same. Mask-wearing social distancing still necessary many months come vaccine distributed even possibly afterward depending everything turns out. So, gives rough estimate maintain hope try reduce number people lose stop caring taking precautions ""pandemic fatigue,"" ""boredom,"" etc. yes; brain injuries fucking awful see. someone ""just fun"" end vegetable 30,40, 50 fuckng years. NGL, started reading headline, expecting go differently. year's got constantly bracing worst-case scenario again, average age dying covid higher death itself. 

According CDC death causes *and* covid deaths increasing among non elderly population pandemic goes on. people dying this. I

This true. Non elderly dying covid. also assumed vast majority elderly people vaccinated March warp speed expects vaccinate 100 million people then.

We going 100 million people vaccinated March. gonna happen. timeline basically one ones mentioned earlier; either normal May April-July.

You‚Äôre timeline place lol. feel sorry Germans. Life normal entire time US(Florida). Family got covid symptoms. people give shit anymore.  country handled successfully. Less days that.. Shit isn‚Äôt getting done. You‚Äôll get results inoculating rock. It‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Trump Vaccine‚Äô now, according president. So.... followers love it? many Rancho protesting mask orders. 

I pray vaccine helps live around people, get sick stupidity. may right that. thought got fever going church could before. Sorry that. Agree too. result Tuskegee experiment, many African Americans developed lingering, deep mistrust public health officials. part foster racial healing, President Clinton issued 1997 apology, stating, ‚ÄúThe United States government something wrong‚Äîdeeply, profoundly, morally wrong‚Ä¶ remembering shameful past make amends repair nation, remembering past build better present better future.‚Äù

Obama apologised well. Tuskegee experiment shut 48 years ago. COVID fucking black plague. Despite media says, overwhelming majority fine riding infection home. 

Assuming 95% efficacy vaccinations, death rate microscopic. 

The doctor article literally suggesting there's 5% chance get virus vaccine, every single restrictions must continue. 

Absolutely disgusting mindset. There‚Äôs really proof show anti vaccine people. position isn‚Äôt logical one first place. It‚Äôs like Q Anon flat earth shit. attitude administration current president towards virus made sure impossible fight virus. sheer defiance wearing masks alone cost US huge financial burden cost many lives. Yes give people mocked called hoax thousands died aid provided. tax dollars work. suggest give would worthy? know whether article going anti-vaxxers minority groups. Yeah, handled well. also remote island hard hit covid. stunned? happening country. bar open, looks. really know keep following Bill Gates's opinions things. mean, know he's smart guy, writes software. John Madden smart guy coached football. opinions would equal epidemics. Neither one epidemiologists.

And I'm saying he's wrong, I'm saying opinion really makes difference me. like them, vote them. get lot people vote them. lot.

And that's thing may seeking achieve.

Even tho, may get lot votes.

Anyways, trying convey they're dumb they've consistent approach. It'll nice see Moderna get first product market. maybe finally Congress pass stimulus

From late January 21 late January '25 passing anything useful helpful Congress. Sorry. read 260 NYers move Florida every day. you‚Äôre basically confirming point. think people agree me, I‚Äôm somehow wrong. Makes sense dude

You‚Äôve said repeatedly sub people agreeing strengthens argument. need stop making claim, it‚Äôs logical fallacy. Dude. objectively say I‚Äôm trusting top public health officials‚Äô timelines article. 

You choose believe like, saying article misleading warranted. I‚Äôd willing bet Fauci said December article said June, would say Fauci ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù people. top this, actually factually incorrect imply spread virus vaccinated. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable assume someone falls 5% people get sick Covid anyway spread virus‚Äî sick covid. can‚Äôt spread disease don‚Äôt have. it‚Äôs misleading make 95% effective vaccine sound worse small 5% chance get sick (and serious case nonetheless according data)

5% zero. birth control pill supposedly 99% effective, women still become pregnant medication. get sense want lie say chance contracting virus receive vaccine. 2 Brain cells play keeps COVID away. scares me. haven‚Äôt many things injected needed iron infusions severe reaction 2nd time administered, turning anaphylactic shock thankfully nurses responded quickly treat covid house Yum This! Absolutely this! kid today, I'd planning safe Halloween birthday May. \[Especially safe.\] spend $14k per student per year. could buy iPad per student per subject per year still get near peer nations. someone generally extremely injecting race discussions

Why tho? Curious  don‚Äôt believe vaccine safe, I‚Äôm sure convince Covid ones safe. court owned gov. 

The gov tell us we're allowed leave house 2025 nobody going anything we're good dogs follow leaders. 

They close business, let people sleep outside rats freezing weather, let kids go hungry they're closing business, leaving us money forcing us stay inside care much us dont want us get sick lol. long term issues foresee coming self terminating mRNA sequence gets degraded transported fat bubble? Biden doesnt need vaccine.... What's time frame go without masks? quite stupid wonder this. Funny. realized thing March well....

Only went back 20 + years friendships get conclusion.

Even family. Listen, even hear gap widening. üëåüèª expecting normal summer, unbelievably looking forward to. San Fran can‚Äôt come perfect plan, he‚Äôs going make own? Seems legit...

I don‚Äôt think Vacaville hospitals city limits though, may beholden base there, surrounding cities. Eh mod broken AF here....the downvotes? piss mean nothing me. too, would good morale booster. probably say doesn‚Äôt need natural immunity Honestly, one point. going scientific medical experts done best short time frame say vaccine confidently received something well studied longer term trials administered decades isn‚Äôt really thing. one cares. Here, take downvote  I'm starting get terrified I'm risk category getting vaccine June 2021. 

I know another 7 months staying home leaving get curbside food pickups. awesome. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre weak, coward STAY HOME you‚Äôre afraid‚Äô, also ‚Äúsupport small business‚Äô. drama entire thing would hysterical thousands dying every day fucktwats. does. He's doctor. literally profits pandemic. It‚Äôs thousands pages data. I‚Äôm politicizing anything. are. what‚Äôs crazy US exciting break 1000 deaths day mark see trend continue. We‚Äôre high point right 1000 deaths death would seem like turning corner.  Well main job make people like want vote can‚Äôt figure one lol. Correct. That's separate issue occurred mRNA treatment. saying that's case vaccines lack long term data vaccines reassuring either. Shit. cant neighborhood get kind thing? definitely response need heroes. Viruses seasonal people's behaviors across country similar around time.  Spending time indoors winter promotes viral spikes. weather, regional attitudes weather, also cultural (holidays).

Of course, NY colder Florida, expect NYers indoors more, promoting viral spread. Still, flu seasonal within Florida people like gather indoors time year opposed times Florida. Canadian Prime Minister posted picture plane unloading vaccines Canada. Feels kind surreal, honestly. much unknown little known tonight.  aint got sunlight like need ass taking Vitamin pills like it. don‚Äôt think clear mean kind hints like ‚Äúoh still get sick, could fatal, don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre safe‚Äù data doesn‚Äôt support feel me

Am interested comorbities q two vaccines 98% effective joke, seriously? It‚Äôs saying guarantee. wonder it‚Äôs keep people stuff stay safe vaccine takes full effect?  agree it‚Äôs like hodgepodge statements thrown together. modern health science current pandemic somewhat perceived significant/serious. Unlike Medieval times due poor/lack health science understanding LEPROSY untreatable epidemic modern health sciences. Leprosy Today treatable disease induce epidemic population. Likewise Smallpox almost nonexistent disease population. denial threat disease would threaten whole health population. Politics must muddle health science advancement. Politics makes every crisis worsens.  T-mobile rolled 5g Kansas already. 22,000 cases per million New Hampshire compared Vermont's 9,000 cases per million, 12,000 cases per million Maine. neighbors looking twice healthy are, time wonder whether could done advantages. vaccine bring hope, problem taking it.....

Then What? 

Everybody saying going change anything another year, so....Youre looking another year masks staying home best medicine - even vaccine...

Um. Fuck. vaccinate folks working factory producing vaccine first?  That's I'd vaccinate first, even transport. I'd imagine they'd worried lawsuits. hospital carry malpractice insurance, hotel liability, converting one makeshift ward would require lot adjustment doubt insurer would extend coverage. crazy owners would even consider even wanted help, someone died family sued, probably sue hospital provided staff telehealth checks. really think would sign protected, hotels owned huge corporations 50 lawyers, becomes issue liability. ABCDEFGH, got gal... got great big convoy rocking night. got great big convoy, ain't beautiful sight? *Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett. 

The title give due; worked hard earn doctorate. Late January early February good guess. approved all. numbers good enough Pfizer moderna set might higher bar. Depending US study turns up, widely expected vaccines might approved. opinion, what's percentage Americans demonstrated inability adjust opinions &amp; actions based evidence? seem find stupidest people important jobs. Still several countries deaths per capita US. health secretary wrong almost everything pandemic. 


‚Ä¢NHS prepared

‚Ä¢Shambolic testing system supposed ""world class""

‚Ä¢recklessly sent older people back carehomes without tested

And much more. gonna take word vaccine gospel performance year? Well, that's hill wanna die on. good news mean ""Problem solved.""

How many dying right now? many die time people actually get vaccine? Homeless? Starving? Bankrupt? like anti maskers dissappear like things done stop problems. 

At least doctors catching dying COVID time people can't slack this. fast, London new strain, looking right now. empathy, don't, find empathy shameful weak. Belgium top 5 Europe beds top 1 global deaths per capita.

If really want convince could plot deaths/cap x, ICU color depending single payer. Vaccines mandatory anyone wants go public again. wanna go school? library? grocery store? Get vaccinated. conservatives like say, ‚ÄúFuck feelings.‚Äù History doesn‚Äôt repeat rhymes lol  Nazi Vampires US, NJ vaccinating healthcare LTC workers tomorrow Probably like 3-4 months things start get better then. Please spread d00m misinformation well, since can't break republican party...go shaming. LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!! Pretty sure [the US less divide - especially Europe. says there's indication causes worse illness respond vaccine break mindset vaccine ""evil""?

If think going change anyone's mind arguing facebook, sorely mistaken. 20 million isn‚Äôt enough even cover vulnerable population. Nothing you‚Äôve said disproves comments. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get upvoted anyway oPtIMism.  someone used commute Topeka Lawrence avoid living Topeka pandemic, take personally. really though, sucks everyone I'd rather people can't WFH get anything point. look like help coming soon enough. need money mismanaged yours? government provide irresponsible? diff, dude. i'm sure somebody recommends Good bot! seen anyone suggest that. That's completely pointless thing add could say similar strains covid. 675,000 definitely cards U.S. rate we're going. 500k estimated March: hunter/gatherer species meant live small tribes. world going nuts. Dr. Fauci says March/April hedd US vaccination program. know them? It‚Äôs RNA virus. haven‚Äôt done math- deaths percent pop handy? Loved set Glastonbury 2013 anecdotal know two different people friend group straight said take it. Mostly crazy BILL GATES 5G conspiracy folks still, definitely people straight say take it. trying say 2 people means much exist clarifying households two parents one income less common statistically single earner households rise single parents common. system exploitation? 

The system play public education system, one? 299k 675k inconceivable. sound like actually know contact not. maybe HR fact lying. 

This businesses, schools, Health Department, etc. always tell everyone someone know tested positive. people know details tend freak even situations contacts. It‚Äôs long shot, today strike back! one tracking it? can‚Äôt afford go lockdown really really need encourage every one mask know mean going away then. long animal species act reservoir virus still exist, affect day day life measles everyone's vaccinated. 

And third world going get vaccinated too. It'll take longer. see blame anyone? 


or dick purpose? truly recommended wait Fall 2021 2022 hold parties vaccines while? Hmm. see logic saying here, I'm wondering disadvantaged people living cities higher risk living rural areas. question hope responsible vaccine distribution considered. 

Thanks reply-- made excellent point deserves discussion. Weird break mindset vaccine ""evil""? I've got people Facebook claiming vaccine work conspiracy. I'd like inform people properly it. 

Any useful resources much appreciated. never officially ""herd immunity"" strategy.

Well, openly, Tegnell **We bit cautious using word** breathes little given question of, says Anders Tegnell.  \- basic idea probably starting become relevant see virus, **this need get. control way.** even explained reasoning behind one Tegnell even questions whether stopping progress virus desirable. ‚Äú**We trying slow it**, disease never go away. manage, like South Korea, get rid it, even say count coming back. **Stopping might even negative**, would pent-up possible spread disease, open gates, possibility would even worse outcome.‚Äù said Aftonbladet \- like forest fires things, make burn little slowly carefully, make burn out. **Sweden achieve herd immunity, six million inhabitants would affected virus**.  Yes, time must remember vast majority become slightly ill. know big so-called dark number is, lot suggest very, big, says Anders Tegnell.  **Even sounds like lot, may one 60 percent get really sick maybe five six need care. smear five-six percent six-eight-ten-twelve months, manageable healthcare.**

That's strategy - let virus spread ""slowly carefully"" herd immunity would reached without overloading hospitals.

Both articles March. later Tegnell changed tune literally thousands people died strategy. They‚Äôll deny themselves, don‚Äôt worry. could look total death count now. Don‚Äôt look recent data takes weeks reporting roll in, count every CDC says notes, excess deaths Covid deaths, note rise rates overdoses, heart disease, things, sure won‚Äôt take years get ceiling estimate many Covid killed. takes matter weeks. crazy thing 19 states higher death rate per 100k Florida. NJ, NY, top 3. think they've gotten already? wonder early celebs get DL.. rushed long term studies side affects. presumably similar strain others otherwise mention it? Planning fear. Interesting sentiment. completely misunderstand tone post made baseless accusations. I‚Äôm commenting post, post talking vaccine. Science comment refers vaccine, sorry saying something little general triggering So, idiots? That‚Äôs meaningful statement without timeline. go time standard person go get we'll 4 months + far dead be. Basically nice coming I'm bitter many people suffer nothing. Oh ya? we‚Äôre 300k couple months we‚Äôre going double we‚Äôve year? Get outta bs That‚Äôs one thing don‚Äôt really like polls. news source poll 100k sometimes sometimes less they‚Äôll use information blanket statement population hundreds millions. It‚Äôs eh. say people know take gets released public Bc skepticism thing time gets released public already maybe little bit idea much impacts people. I‚Äôm hoping everything goes good. I‚Äôll taking jab soon hits cvs :,) think wait 5-10 years find out, damage caused virus make us wish we'd taken it.

Personally, I'll line available. risks COVID concerning vaccine. trials 3 months without really bad side effects. Source? Along rest 2020. think it‚Äôs reasonable questions doubts vaccine produced short time novel virus year You‚Äôre right, they‚Äôre theft. wanted give number without qualifying high low. mention need external RT (in case HIV) LINE-1 element activation. I‚Äôm super familiar admit quickly skimmed morning procrastinating stuff. Microarrays closest ever came whole genome events/expression. Oh pain. mostly worry getting misconstrued Twitter elsewhere people end vaccine mRNA genomes.
So yes I‚Äôm dismissing think general public freak something valid. happens 5-10 years covid patients? America country 34% population believe evolution think earth created 7000 years ago.

After learning that, much Americans surprises me. ‚ÄúThe government plans distribute 2.9 million doses U.S. states week ahead, Centers Disease Control Prevention recommended first shots go health-care workers long-term care facilities, including nation‚Äôs hard-hit nursing homes.

Operation Warp Speed officials said 20 million Americans could receive first shot two-course vaccines end year.‚Äù

It definitely doesn‚Äôt suggest anything you‚Äôre stating correct higher number positive tests happen test more. But, one detail consider go answer later comment here: 'just imagine test 17 million people Netherlands once. absolute number infections would skyrocket, percentage would plummet'. 

The percentage going tests moment, imply still lot cases caught moment, reason concern.

If call others critical analyzing, please well. also builds really unhealthy relationship work, raised can't take day rest nothing unless critically ill.

My first job grad school pretty low stress urgent deadlines ton sick time (3 weeks per year, rolled over, separate vacation) people would still come sick conditioned be. Viewed badge honor something. would brag 200+ hours banked cough breathe.

I regularly take sick days feel little I'd rather chill day reset vs run ground seems like I'm exception. new variant begin? Americans stop gatekeeping fucking pandemic every one threads sub US? country world suffering it. Believe not, even number one most-affected country world. There's actually dozen countries cases deaths per 100 000 people (which proper comparative measure since control total population, course everything else equal countries larger population would total cases). I've never seen Belgians Czech people go around telling people ""nah rookie numbers, stop complaining, bad us"". Idk someone believes nonsense certain opinion stems Fox News. realize large percentage Americans don‚Äôt follow politics search sources outside mainstream narrative either side right? understand it‚Äôs backwards nonsense believe everything black white right? doesnt. takes years BS bureaucracy fact need enough vaccine candidates. COVID widespread get massive sample sizes shortage people test on. THink something like Ebola, small % it, takes gather data. Plus ingredients list like 10 things harmful. Google it. Well isn‚Äôt fun live Germany non essential stores close Wednesday. Today went walk saw shops offering sales discounts. totally get point view sheer number people lines shops insane heard doctor prescribe bunch opioids getting kickback pharma companies Come rabbit hole. 95% pretty damn good vaccine know. I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm going quit wearing mask anything get I‚Äôm definitely going fine meeting friends family going eat. 95% literally best could realistically hoped for. No, it‚Äôs setting realistic expectations. Fyi California currently averaging 31,000 cases per day. higher INDIA, second worst affected country, 29,000 cases per day. think thrown üëê there. I'm sorry situation, also dickhead means going away, especially there's major fraction third world never going luxury getting vaccine. op right. Bispebjerg people properly discerning ‚Äúvariant‚Äù ‚Äústrain‚Äù even among frontline workers, doctors hospital management far less exposure corona nurses / residents getting first I‚Äôm Seattle pretty mask socially distant friendly, however weekend neighbors across street birthday party 23 kids, wearing masks. cognitive dissonance blows mind. Honestly, worried smoking copd, heart disease, stroke cancers smoking cause. Quit smokin', baby! got wellbutrin able quit 15 years. I'll probably still get cancer hoping lungs better shape get covid get it. treatments also sped recovery time, beds rolled faster. 

We‚Äôll see, I‚Äôm confident assessment. third-weirdest name SW MI best! (Climax Colon, course.) people nothing going lives. Covid brief respite reality live in. vaccine close, terrified confronting sad lives truly are.  Apparently, read article, called ""COVID‚Äê19 vaccine research development: ethical issues"", know link here, hopefully easy Google. skimmed it, mention smokers it, must wild interpretation Well basically said people travel know full well risks, said people work post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Wegwarth shed light country Germany fared better United States handling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) November 1, 2020, example, mortality rate per million 5 times lower Germany United States (128 vs 715, Indeed, mortality rate Germany lower almost every American state, including Hawaii. difference mortality, morbidity, lost quality life difficult attribute medical technology, drug therapy, underlying genetics, environmental factors, virus characteristics. One contributing factor may differences public health messages intended guide individual behaviors mitigate COVID-19 pandemic.

Wegwarth et used national survey German adults (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ2011) test nuances public health messaging COVID-19 pandemic. nuances spanned comprehensive messages (describing uncertainty numbers adjectives) limited messages (leaving uncertainty unmentioned). results suggested individuals tend prefer messages comprehensive rather limited expressions uncertainty (32.3% vs 21.1%; *P*‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001). Similar findings replicated analyses motivation adopt maintain containment efforts. Together, findings thoughtful rigorous research suggest disclosing uncertainty help persuade skeptics bolster public behaviors manage COVID-19 pandemic. think understand. asking next year vaccine immunity still present.  be, uncertainty. concern also previously exposed people reported infected again. Time tell. think like flu mutations popping up. could also disappear world achieves herd immunity. called doctor told test travelled exposed. multifaceted issue. quickest way describe phenomenon breaking three main categories. keep mind distrust medicine medical services compounded socioeconomic status. example, someone low-income background negative interactions healthcare workers healthcare treatments less likely trust healthcare systems. 

The main reasons see push back mainly low-income, minority, communities: 

1) Lack adequate healthcare systems programs already place. affordable healthcare office free clinic, chances clinic underfunded understaffed puts strain workers. workers strained little resources, could impact performance retention rates healthcare workers area. People wait hours day treated feel like treatments priority overworked staff members feel like clinic meet individual's needs. 

2) Treatment patient. low-income area limited educational resources, staff may less likely listen concerns health. may make patients feel unheard make patients feel like little say healthcare plans. may make individuals less likely confide healthcare workers honest symptoms know listened to. Compounded possible cultural differences healthcare workers patients, might already idea ""I know best."" people always take kindly to. 

3) Community practices. you, neighbor, friend, family member negative interactions healthcare (for example, losing baby giving birth understaffed hospital), people may correlate tragedy treatment received distrustful medical staff. people social circle distrust medicine, likely distrust medicine medical professionals. 

A lot ties back education representation. multifaceted issue goes beyond medical field. 

If want example global issue similar this, highly encourage read article time: someone explain interaction factory output Michigan many doses US purchased? doses Michigan fulfilling contracts US well? mean would made day Chinese received approval, would track. figure mid production way would dump material distribution channels started. guy. Headscarves women, right? Inject ass* I'm making assumptions sure, think would least cost lives additional spread: observed cases among vaccinated = higher likelihood transmission vaccinated unvaccinated?

I'll walk back original statement say I'm making educated guess Americans die, turns sterilizing immunity roughly among vaccines, probably matter. I'd *think* true likely show symptoms Oxford vaccine, know certain. I'd also think symptomatic people worse spreaders (coughing, sneezing), perhaps asymptomatic, vaccinated people worse think ""can't"" take precautions. government claims 60k vaccines per day, already confirmed buying millions vaccines, ""but even 10th population could get vaccinated wanted to"" sounds bit ignorant. going even long vaccination restrictions still on? 
What thoughts never going back normal restrictions 2024 many experts talked about? Yes do. like government took risk screwed Fine me. likely won‚Äôt able get late spring early summer, get moved line others don‚Äôt want it, certainly won‚Äôt complain. right likely could worded bit better! One grandmothers still alive, dies 13 years ago. using death shitty little rhyme promote politics? Well there‚Äôs whole lot fucking outliers friend. doesn‚Äôt resonate you, aren‚Äôt intended audience that‚Äôs okay Oh interesting. Hopefully get approved within next month then! It‚Äôs sad. I‚Äôve disassociated good number people life thought cool, reasonable people. don‚Äôt think come back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù pre-COVID terms seeing disgusting levels selfishness stupidity them. It‚Äôs done. can‚Äôt look eye anymore. Ignorance asinine comment, maths.

You compare % dead population meaningful comparison impact two. poster isnt trivialising deaths highlighting comparison valid unless account population. Whatever origins particular brand anti Vax totally irrelevant 300 thousand dead covid. lot. 

I feel like January would dismissed minority yes significant. 1% 300,000,000 lot people. 


Also already happened fact. aware deaths due COVID are, respects, additional annual expectation.
 
Many deaths also simply contributing factors deaths would otherwise occurred well.
 
None point, attempt deflection notwithstanding.
 
The point segment population taken brunt impact comes mortality. way.
 
So ask again, COVID behind us, give damn aged population back *business usual* dying COVID count? already NZ's proof hard lockdowns work

*Yawn*

Call NL irrelevant island part European Union afford completely close borders world indefinite amount time. civil? Maybe act civil least act patronizing that's want. Though comment looks like assumed went head. 

Based data data previous respitory diseases, problem covid 19 never going lethality -it long term risk factors compounding risk factors. always going double back heart disease. even passed 1 year pandemic trying say data supports long term side effects? somehow previous knowledge scar tissue present lungs flipped head. would genuinely interested data. link sources I'd appreciate it.

 I'm going go wild guess assume pulling info ass. interpreting data suit viewpoint. mean? doctor, mostly speculation - covid symptom severity depends (amongst things) viral load. plan got covid lay warm sun vitamin sunlight disinfects (and live far away enough others). imagine breathing high viral load air (from covid sufferers) may good know much. air filters supposedly filter viral particles. kind symptoms get probably depends virus travels body. Presumably infected strain. may help stay together support care other.

How long covid lasts would depend temperature, humidity kind surfaces. Disinfect wipes sprays. Feltes used-car-salesman vibe. don‚Äôt trust far could throw False, dad normal mom aspergers, I‚Äôm half fucked up. Victoria, Aus months months proper lockdown. sick it, view NZ cases Europe US huge problems least saw road ahead.  think what's happening incompetence, benevolence.

Sweden faces shortage health-care workers number resignations ticks relentless year caring Covid patients.

Sineva Ribeiro, chairwoman Swedish Association Health Professionals, says situation ‚Äúterrible.‚Äù

The development shows even countries universal health-care systems struggling keep Covid crisis. week, Stockholm‚Äôs intensive care capacity hit 99%, sending city panic prompting calls outside help.

But even ICU beds provided, bigger concern whether Sweden enough health-care workers skills needed look country‚Äôs sickest patients.


Ribeiro says already back May, members union ‚Äúwarned untenable situation.‚Äù fewer qualified people available spring, ‚Äúwhich makes harder expand ICU capacity,‚Äù said.

Health-care professionals emerged heroes Covid crisis, often drawing cheers grateful onlookers emerge hospitals long grueling shifts.

But increasingly, staff desperate real time see resignation way out, Ribeiro said. survey broadcaster TV4 showed 13 Sweden‚Äôs 21 regions, resignations health-care profession year ago, many 500 month.

The Army
Stockholm County Mayor Irene Svenonius says situation ‚Äúextremely tense.‚Äù interview Dagens Nyheter Friday, acknowledged health-care workers overworked, there‚Äôs need add staff. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs fatigue,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt ignore that, it‚Äôs extremely important get people.‚Äù

It‚Äôs uncertain extra capacity come from. Stockholm asked additional health-care staff Sweden‚Äôs armed forces, it‚Äôs clear military resources help. meantime, 100 staff children‚Äôs hospital reportedly redeployed intensive care units, meaning children due receive non-emergency surgery forced wait.

Sweden, avoided lockdown since pandemic started, also turning Nordic countries help. Saturday, neighboring Finland said it‚Äôs ready assist freeing space Swedish ICU patients.

The worry that, despite scientific strides allow medics better understand treat Covid-19, aren‚Äôt enough professionals left put knowledge practice.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt staff it,‚Äù Ribeiro said. described current health-care crisis facing country ‚Äúunprecedented.‚Äù

In December 2020, 266.5 million U.S. population age 16 years older, somewhere around let's say 24% choose vaccinations, around 64 million people age 16 older might refuse vaccinations. Thus, perhaps total 202.5 million might want vaccinations, would require 405 million vaccination doses necessary inoculate people first vaccination second vaccination 3-4 weeks later. 
    
What source percentage let's say 24% might choose vaccinations? 
     
For Dec. 11, FDA press states: ""The data also support known potential benefits outweigh known potential risks, supporting vaccine‚Äôs use millions people 16 years age older, including healthy individuals."" So, inoculation practices vaccination sites generally include vaccinating healthy persons 16 years age, many persons age 16 older might want vaccinated?

Copies tests files. tested negative numerous times (clients frequent ER visitors one also works healthcare setting tests regularly). expected second positive tests news wasn‚Äôt word. One news organizations brief, non-detailed report doctor local hospital saying he‚Äôs seeing reinfected patients. details months apart anything. think tracking state abysmal information isn‚Äôt going readily known provided researchers. I've visited 40 countries, sometimes months lived Europe USA.

Now what? Yeah, vaccine quantities contract Pfizer Moderna quite simply enough get slow alter course pandemic. 

Unless approve Oxford J&amp;J (or even, gasp, Russian and/or Chinese vaccines!) somehow increase two mRNA vaccines' production tenfold, reach herd immunity naturally long average Joe chance get vaccinated. Well never distinguished based origin. friends include ppl France, Romania, Georgia (that tiny country edge Europe/Asia), Kurds, Persians. I'm German myself. sadly lost track them, matter person itself, nothing else.
I'm sorry hear bad experiences. happen.

I reconsider stance really important affected. wait vaccinated personally. Still wearing masks till reach herd immunity incredible relief be. remember hearing NYT Daily episode vaccines. 

But Googling around, finding lots sources saying US contract J&amp;J buy 100 million doses, written source due. Hard go back find podcast, may original reporting may mixed March referring listening.

Anyway here's link 100 million dose contract announced: Uh oh. She‚Äôs chipped. means government owns shut brain kill moment- things father law says vaccine Define average Joe. think person normal Job, risk, elderly able get spring really try to. probably involve waiting line places, researching go, possibly driving great distances, will.be available early adopters.

The main researcher even says prussian turk. A) one assuming people dont care elderly population. mostly liberal sub people advocating better health care government's responsibility part it, especially elderly.

B) 1-1.5 million deaths widescale government intervention. 300,000 number partial full shutdowns, implemented mask wearing, constant reminders practice improved personal sanitation standards. Sure 100% guidelines followed enforced, practices put place, think death toll would things never happened? Shit would blown proverbial roof back April. guess makes sense. Thanks :) Considering ad companies able identify algorithms woman pregnant online activities woman realise, I'm surprised there's type thing studied. islands factor UK Ireland 

People keep missing point New Zealand Australia. *isolated* islands choke points entry exit. UK hundreds flights Europe Ireland. UK tunnel connecting continental Europe.

A big part New Zealand's success *isolated* island middle nowhere. disagree think people don‚Äôt understand done big deal Barack Obama first black president. Historical oppression impacts present circumstances black people America. lack black people high power high impact positions. Part reason black see media it‚Äôs back people getting arrested athletes rappers young black kids don‚Äôt see scientist something either want achieve. correct imbalance there‚Äôs effort highlight black people make significant accomplishments field. It‚Äôs encourage participation black kids correct historical injustices. What's alternative? brothels? yes sir! stomach virus called norovirus. vaccines rolled record time. Normally vaccines take years sometimes decades develop get trials. Pfizer vaccine took 11 months. Moderns gets approved next couple weeks. 

As far buying vaccine even putting line appears Trump team ""the best people"" fucked back summer. sure wanting put eggs one basket what, think obligation pay unless approved. No, yeah. common occurrence influenza, though. imagination necessary. Concluding Sentence: 

Decisions pandemic must made speed amid great uncertainty. need proper process, transparency, good communication. agree gotta protect dumbasses screw that. deserve seek.

It's protecting others them, though. people frustrating certainly huge problem public health measures, there's value letting desire punish get way public good reducing likelihood catching spreading virus would do.  Hehe creepy :) live South thanks anyways! Nobody stopping anybody getting vaccinated. wonder one hardest (hee hee hee, hardest!) hit countries EU. Sounds like one hell closet... think establishing causality beyond scope sentiment analysis. relatively straightforward viewpoints article suggests. Assessing impact article person's views, let alone behavior, feasible. main metric Facebook et al use run sentiment analysis user's posts (i.e. post positive statuses, they're happier). good enough purposes, going reliable enough make predictions article's impact deaths. you‚Äôre talking top 0.1% aren‚Äôt even rich (compared Gates Zuckerberg) incredibly powerful well connected like presidents elite banking families. MAYBE got already. also enough money power insulate virus probably don‚Äôt feel need skip line. 

Also globally you‚Äôre talking like maybe 10k people kind position power. It‚Äôs big group it‚Äôs impacting vaccination campaigns big way. media intentionally making devisive headlines.

Frankly, preference. would prefer Korea, Japan, France, UK, Germany, USA. grand scheme, there's difference quality life among countries, certain demographics, like said. 

Frankly, asian countries, working culture, that's America individualistic free (compared UK, well). think people misunderstand say America freedom. laws whatnot, mindset. I'm saying USA set discipline, relatively ""you you"" mentality. 

USA shit working class below, think top 30%, better USA developed countries. vaccine research rushed. number reasons, vaccine developed record time confident it.

But take me, take certified professional understands science:

[Dr. Maria Sundaram answers questions COVID vaccine-hesitant person (starts chances renders vaccine useless? 1918 world war going on, actually even optimal fast spreading! regular staff, fine.

If mask hating super spreading administration cronies, fuck them! Apples falling far tree grow new trees. want say, done good job countering points clearly coherently. see (from upvotes comment) people agree assessment.

I agree data muddied things like uncounted asymptomatic cases, diagnosis bias post-viral syndrome.

I also concede decide handle virus solely worst-case possible outcomes, think means take risks seriously. know handful people who've virus, one still dealing fatigue issues 4 months testing negative virus, another sense smell going six weeks now. assessment risks admittedly biased anecdotal experiences people know. Islam, mere presence prohibited substance immediately make impermissible. Take alcohol. used medical setting time totally fine use.

The legal theory framework Sharia much nuanced haram halal. 

If non-pig used vaccine available sure, could see adoption much faster. one fine. I‚Äôll wait harsh fair :)  Mismanaged fancy word shit bed,no one west genuinely handled well, Taiwan Vietnam examples follow along new Zealand west care money risk,fuck people save money! Hate state government wanted vent. I‚Äôm frustrated emotionally exhausted fuck. Ive isolating ad much recurrent discussion please groups four five friends smoke well straight argument roommate. Yesterday rommie sending snaps group chat mask pulled could drink Browns game went kindof want punch fucking wall. effort go game estimated thousand people, several directly around masks on, possibly bring covid home. I‚Äôm feeling paranoid anxious time constant awareness COVID risk hell ptsd. Feels like blending together overwhelming jumble. 

Is unreasonable anxious roommate going football game given outside? coping strain? got  tetanus shot im good guilt tripping people vaccine.

What schools public facilities require vaccinations? (pre-covid standard)

What views that?

based comments, sounds like would advocate requirements overreach could skeptical day long things 100% effective. people get effective getting us side. Sentiments ""It's 100% effective"" seem kind moot compared alternative.  Someone else suggested would probably unethical fraught unexpected consequences, really want get good vaccine coverage somehow need position one vaccines patriotic manly ooo-rah one another one libs. people willing almost anything provided pisses ""enemy,"" convincing segment population George Soros AOC want take Moderna Vaccine (or whatever) could best chance got ensure people need take will. Something similar would probably work direction too, I'm sure there's much resistance getting vaccination begin with. point stop death hospitalization, reward people state governments ""good behavior"". immunocompromised 70 year old's fault state responded ineptly. gonna happen terms vaccinating 70% USA population, infections give short-term immunity, combination lead herd immunity. need add alcohol deaths time. Corona looks like one done.

Don't forget future either. also need account suffering alcohol abuse causes.

The police busting doors stop dangerous consumption alcohol homes moral solution. I'm healthcare worker 65, it'll probably long ass time get vaccinated can, can't wait get it. Oh god! Even Minks serious masks social distancing. Three cheers CEO Bourla's high expectations. pushed Pfizer try impossible, proved possible. Wait Hungarian guy closet? creates perverse incentive though. people know act irresponsibly, they'll get priority access vaccinations, people incentivized act irresponsibly. There's everything used channels better made people youtube.

Cable useless.

Smarter everyday, practical engineering, almost solo outfits crazy interesting stuff.  headline surprising thing.

The surprising thing that, data have, understand human behavior enough find surprising. aren‚Äôt divided. There‚Äôs small, loud, group nuts get attention. guy spreading misinformation. Got it. better believe see another spike due people using vaccine excuse, lying got it, go without mask whatever want. get baby arrives. upcoming month going pretty hard rock reckon. media truly done awful job reporting Covid.

They've done truly awful job reporting literally everything past 5+ years. Arguably 20+ years. People confused basic concepts. feel like people think it‚Äôs ‚Äúrushed‚Äù bases timing never looked able speed process vaccines compared vaccines. 

I feel really confident looking it. vaccines, drug, medical intervention always include risk. need look individual vaccine make decision based public opinion.

Edit: clarity 6th June 1944! Wait, no, wrong day wonder we'll still anti maskers anti vaxxers 2120..... Ugh. guess elderly really revert back children. condoms work. Every 100 times sex, 2 times might break, leakage, slip issues.

The vaccine 95% people, exposures ""useage"". 19 20 people get ill regardless exposure.  Yes long vaccine last? Last heard 4 5 months. would mean 60% population would also keep getting shot every 4 months so. Anyone info this? know long vaccine effective getting vaccine soon, plan place schedule get another vaccine shortly after? way worse Spanish Flu. Spanish Flu potent enough kill young healthy individuals large numbers. concerned child getting flu school, even less reason concerned getting Covid-19 Nobody's going give vaccine weeks now. way back line that. US buy ALOT HCQ? India replaced HCQ Ivermectin afaik. sure reversal. Perhaps something one various treatment protocols (MATH+, i-MASK). Whatever reason, hope helps sick people. really. There's everybody slue gigantic idiots visit grandfather (outside, distanced, masks) retirement home yesterday, said they're expecting everyone get first shot Christmas. I'm excited grandmother might able get back semblance normalcy soon, even within home. Thanks do!  100,000 have, past years anything go antigay politicians there? real sex party don‚Äôt study history (or science) forced repeat it. ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said Monday Turkey impose five-day full lockdown beginning December 31 maintain gains pandemic, official data showed new daily coronavirus deaths hit record 229. Erdogan, speaking cabinet meeting, said stay-home order would begin 9 p.m. New Year‚Äôs Eve run January 4. Separately government data showed new daily COVID-19 cases stood 29,617 last 24 hours. [Summary] Gotta love glass half full mentality.

Do think possible although majority population vaccinated several months, things still improve significantly months leading point? nothing life is. think according UK twats mean government last 90 days so,and think mutated least seen there's apparently new strain South East England that's spreading fast least 1000 cases far,yet government England say ok see family Christmas,sooner Scotland leaves UK bloody better. I'm sure asked before, so, sorry, butI'm confused availability vaccine. couple questions: 
1. distribution criteria (order gets it) controlled federal government? State governments?
2. one sign get ASAP? (I'm talking jumping queue, making sure one getting soon available)
I ask elderly mother (not nursing home) worried about. anxiety heightened lost one relative COVID related complications another hospice care result COVID. Soon Possible mean they're getting soon. ""I'll buy dollar"" really feel like countries lockdown christmas new years. Pennsylvania locking January 4th. yet never worried vaccines given. trust anything Trump says? Yea I‚Äôm talking generally 50s. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs chill outside whether people, I‚Äôm def California boy.  independent * honestly, requiring cause damage vaccine movement/vaccine science voluntary first place. much bias data? data sparse?

Go research basis modern day gynecology understanding effect STDs human body. Granted look Africa, poor relatively untouched virus. 

The fact medical advancements allow people live 80s 90s western countries old one factors. Populations much younger back.  Ooorgy Retesting determine somebody still contagious increasingly recommended many people continue test positive quite time longer contagious. couples isolated recommended period time return community. almost assuredly least reduces transmission, given know truly asymptomatic cases (infectiousness reduced 3/4 couple metastudies). Since vaccine least makes people asymptomatic majority cases, see corresponding drop transmission. bunch vaccinated people means bunch new dead ends. reliably comparable 650k number. Covid example UK die point within month positive covid test reason go covid death. Recover, walk door get run over? covid figures. Somehow doubt that's counted 1918 Stupid fuck magas new infection. stupidity unrestrained . DUMB fuck. Proud hell Also boat, server, gamer, binger YouTube, like OP Illinois. clear country coasted many ways crash sky thinks flew in. U.S. needs shunned cold shouldered. schoolyard bully needs outcast. right. Close actually one helper Sinterklaas live anywhere near unfortunately. aunt tested positive, husband tested negative. dad, spent thanksgiving her, tested negative. common? It‚Äôs strange assume two full dose since regime doesn‚Äôt enough efficacy data. lot experts skeptical one half one full regime really 90 % effective small sample size. saw longest testing line I've seen yet outside Raymond James stadium Tampa FL past weekend. They're definitely getting tested record numbers facility. Can't imagine rest state would different. many children per room pupil:teacher ratios?

In US, except wealthier school districts, often children seats urban schools. speak vaccine stood test time. new vaccine, also new type , RNA vaccines.

At least expect speculations effectiveness side effects I've never known another company that's good customers bad employees. Yeah point is? Sounds like described obesity 50% population promote unhealthy lifestyle fat loveable characters. Hopefully acts wake call live health sadly won‚Äôt. 

If people lived healthier lifestyle immune system would able fight build immunity like humans thousands years.

Let‚Äôs talk America deaths due heart diseases, sickness related obesity diabetes see numbers hundreds thousands yearly. 

As fact 85% deaths average age mortality would say would counted anyways regardless.

It might morbid viewpoint 2.5% age groups started dying yes would worse could compared Spanish flu it‚Äôs not. 

The second order effects unwarranted shutdowns (weird aren‚Äôt slowing spread) effect economy education felt years maybe decade yes let‚Äôs keep listening government stooges get paycheck change guidance. Remember singing family gatherings... everyone hesitant hastily-developed vaccine anti-vaxxer. even doctors scientists. can‚Äôt anti-vaxxers move travel restricted island WiFi die preventable diseases leave us alone. 85 percent actually higher range vaccines it‚Äôs good sign, unfortunately always going people refuse Oh, definitely, feel way. Everything worried pandemic basically come true really destroyed lot progress made years mental health. feel like I'm living worst nightmare every single day since March. feel way. *should* historic moment. trucks rolled Pfizer plant cheering crowds along road sides, felt.... hope. Hope pride, difficult year.

However, always, undercut undermined negativity, vitriol divisiveness gripped country late. fellow Americans seem incapable looking past minor petty arguments (usually political nature) fully appreciate scale endeavor vaccination campaign. Imagine trucks, planes, ships, human chains people racing time bring life saving vaccine bring wretched virus end. energy logistics incredible human endeavor, usually reserved war, aimed saving lives. no, can‚Äôt appreciate it. 


But historic moment, OP, *should* feel like one. programs American Heroes Channel. know name sounds atrociously propagandistic shows actually decent quality Mafia marathons Saturdays. did. quite literally worst administration worst possible time Making generalizations instead providing source previous generalization excellent argument. Ty time Japan lot covid now. likely Singapore Despite politicians told us (and wrongfully believed recently) vaccines undergo normal safety trials. administering experimental vaccines people. tested shown work cause harmful side effects. Media Hugely blame. allow fear mongering ignorance spread without limitations across platforms like twitter, facebook, cnn, fox new, many others. problem way interpret first amendment. specifically Judges allow corporations argue unrestricted freedom speech. Yes. I'm sure that's true extent, since main health conditions said put higher risk covid. I'm actually pretty sick chronic conditions make list though even though I'm lucky enough obese diabetes/high blood pressure/the main high-risk conditions, I'm super optimistic chances get covid. They're quitting ""great numbers"" Sweden either. Sweden lack nurses years already, pandemic exacerbated already ongoing problem. lot countries. lot developed western countries England, Scandinavia probably even Germany others relying foreign workers sustainable long run.  250 EUR fine held accountable? pocket change rich people. Seeing lots places outdoor tents indoor dining limited completely banned lots states. tents really much better indoor dining? ""So they're right point learning it."" incredibly low number parents would die Covid.

So present such. honest, hide behind generalizations, put number it. 'We project year, 45,000 parents die sent kids school, that's acceptable tradeoff vs. making million kids stay home'. 
You advocating policy would kill tens thousands parents. 1/10th 1% kids lose parent, that's 50,000 parents. 

It also count extended infections. We've seen lot situations one asymptomatic person infects dozens hundreds others. Sick parents infect offices, infect kids grandparents, infect older friends, etc. 

It's parents die. heard 70% either way feeling might difficult achieve, know people anti vaxxers concerned, hopefully fauci takes tv people follow get tested, peace mind. believe US calling dibs Moderna shots. 

The ones produced US, yes. also factory Switzerland executive order apply, Canada said procuring doses Swiss plant. Money talks - Australia ordered lots vaccine. don‚Äôt dire need get done today failure states do. Right on. hope things ease soon. crucial, challenging sometimes overlooked field. happy hear that.

Risk doesn‚Äôt work like that. Although experts saying risky health keep home send person, doesn‚Äôt mean schooling home automatically kills particular children. isn‚Äôt risk works. alive doesn‚Äôt mean doesn‚Äôt increase children‚Äôs health risks. ? Everything literally open except sitting restaurant already pretty limited begin with. think okay key political figures around world getting shot time first group. last thing need pandemic political collapse top everything else. can‚Äôt, won‚Äôt matter isn‚Äôt going conspiracy nuts, it‚Äôs going otherwise reasonable people worried fast vaccine developed approved.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Actually tourism net loss us Aus normal times - less visitors abroad send overseas.

Everyone stuck regional towns great business.  think better say vaccines silver bullet, they're dimmer light switch. take time roll everyone get enough people vaccinated, start returning back normal. listen people say we'll social distancing 2022. 21 days exactly said many them? Iowa daughter Caregiver home DD, son volunteer fireman, vaccinated next year. places employment responsible securing doses. daughter states share distribution enough cover everyone facility workers, waiting arrive well. Independent needs editor... 'within week' camera different week camera?  find slippery slope. I'm conspiracy theorist stretch, freedom taken away, rarely given back.

If give freedom private sector, believe would work out. airlines would require vaccine, thus travel restricted. on...

But, imagine this. today's world everything recorded. OK someone getting killed refuse vaccine? Whether mob mentality someone refusing arrest getting shot, even tazed? Personally won‚Äôt social distancing friends summer, regardless. I‚Äôll still mask public need be, staying home stuff done point. That's complete lie. I'm conspiracy theorist...

But wondering prove whatever getting injected placebo? 328,000 mark officially 1 every 1000 Americans dead. hit that, what? New Years I‚Äôm guessing? That's incorrect. History full diseases believed eradicated though herd immunity, sweating sickness Tudor England many, many flu viruses caused past pandemics There‚Äôs 54m people 65 US 18m medical workers. 

Moderna isn‚Äôt delivering 100m doses end Q1, likely March. 

Pfizer same. 

So we‚Äôll maybe enough high risk groups February. 

Assuming every 65 HCW gets it, ~56m doses left end March enough 28m people. 

This next group people comorbidities like morbid obesity diabetes comes in. They‚Äôll prioritized after. That‚Äôs big group, it‚Äôs still far cry average American getting vaccine. They‚Äôre 40%+ US population it‚Äôs murky many elderly included there. call 30%. Still looking 96m Americans. 

Then there‚Äôs going pretty big drought 100m doses Q2 Moderna one Pfizer doses. 

So we‚Äôd part way vaccinating comorbidities June likely. 

You‚Äôre right say may kind access end Q1 though. may look different though sign CVS app, tell hypertension diabetes get put waitlist vaccine. idea they‚Äôll verify though. tell people I‚Äôm obese even though look slightly overweight try get technicality. imagine people try that.

And course assuming Johnson &amp; Johnson AstraZeneca vaccines don‚Äôt receive approval. vaccines do, summer guaranteed. vast majority us? Finally headline accurate. D-Day first day Allied troops landed Western Europe. over, Allies controlled five beaches France little bit surrounding countryside -- rest continental Europe still occupied Nazis. marked *start* liberation Europe, would take another 11 months complete. ‚ÄúV-Day‚Äù synonymous ‚ÄúV-Card‚Äù pertaining vaccinations. need call something else. Dumb. basically want punish politicians super rich absolve are. think someone worth 200M cares 200k salary? problem it‚Äôs anti-vax people. It‚Äôs people typically pro-vaccine, understandably weary variety reasons. trust process, vaccine development even year ago. know potential short term affects, don‚Äôt know, can‚Äôt know, long term ones ones may take develop, later.

We need genetic research individual. OMG.

A biotech conference Boston last February that's already flagged Covid-19 superspreading event led least 245,000 cases across US Europe, new genetic fingerprinting study One single case seems responsible many eventual cases, team Broad Institute Massachusetts study finds two particular genetic fingerprints viruses associated conference tracks lineages across US.

True even reporting often makes rules sound harsher actually are. Even NRW many people belive rules apply inside peoples homes. Also Lachet said makes sense trying enforce kinds rules dystopian I'm even mad. I'm kinda impressed know, maddening. we'll celebrate without them. BOOM! Bring fireworks! White House official fell ill Covid-19 September recovering three months hospital, though ***he lost right foot lower leg battle virus***, according Bailey, director White House security office, severely ill among dozens Covid-19 cases known connected White House. Bailey‚Äôs family asked White House publicize condition, President Donald Trump never publicly acknowledged illness. Google: number vaccines available united states

Only 50 million available globally right now, Pfizer

And liberal estimate Possibly. individual shared article argument mask wearing? contact tracking/viral dna conclusively showed contracted area wearing masks. would hilarious guy started convulsing live camera, stoping going like ‚ÄúSIKE!, Stab ya self BIACH!‚Äù Mr. Mrs. Soon B. Dead wait want vaccine.  Survival Fittest. Yeah, probably. That's big hill get too. I‚Äôm talking dudes advocating within last 30-40 years. Clinton‚Äôs reforms welfare weren‚Äôt helpful all. THIS. keep saying this. family, daughter's father fired job first shut want pay mandatory parental leave schools shut would stay home couple days week. knew bill requiring mandatory parental paid leave 2 weeks pass knew he'd use it, fired him. Since then, full time stay home dad we've cut bills living expenses live income, that's even possible families US. enable daughter distance learning avoid going back classroom. kids made less money, even able this. lot people forced choose sending kids school losing jobs, really options. vaccines still want wait get one fully tested. skeptical taking version vaccine.

1. full understanding virus immune system react fighting short long term. Ex. Spanish influenza caused huge number narcolepsy cases protien shared brain. first swine flu h1n1 vaccine also gave people narcolepsy even killed few.

2. using mRNA delivery system first time mass. created potential vaccines type cancer treatments, MERS, SARS, EBOLA, vaccines never saw public use. effectiveness viability still studied.

3. using public lab rats. I'm ending pandemic going back normal idea much harm creating. bell's palsy already making news children developing auto immune issues, knows know 5 years.

4. know medical workers catch covid-19 every 3 months. know seperate strain strain allowing this. coworkers getting accurate tests public, becoming sick testing positive multiple times, experiencing varied severity reinfection. vaccine may grant longer immunity may give people false sense security makes pandemic worse.

5. know enough human animal transmission. stands know varied number species catch covid-19. saw mass kills even animal shelters early sparking huge adoption craze earlier year. need find mutating seperate human populations domestic wild animals transmitting back people. vaccine maybe effective lowering risk death complications may providing false sense security leading another contagious deadly outbreak next year.

My thoughts find way get people properly wear mask. want accept nature virus faster mutations flu, even vaccine stay. Vaccination never high enough able keep virus. far worse pandemic letting on. tinfoil hat statement. common cold can't vaccinated fast mutations struggling find good solution well. difference cold transmit animal populations like extremely deadlier strains like SARS MERS. animal human population become infected strains create new virus could death toll like never seen.

Final note. Go get vaccinated high risk essential worker might die. risk vs reward worth it. me. I'm gonna wait learn little possibly ending lifelong disability issue. true I'm surprised arguing this. Science fundamentally incompatible religion, former real latter ancient novella. take pretty strong fighting misinformation religion that. Giving credence approval vaccine religions bodies give credence religions might disapprove cause millions take it. simple church state kept separate. full paragraph anyone else looking missing context: 
 ""Before December 2020, mRNA drug vaccine licensed use humans, Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech close securing emergency use authorization mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, funded Operation Warp Speed (directly case Moderna indirectly Pfizer/BioNTech).[1] 2 December 2020, seven days final eight-week trial, UK's MHRA, became first global medicines regulator history approve mRNA vaccine, granting ""emergency authorization"" BioNTech/Pfizer's B""Verbeke_2019""62b2 COVID-19 vaccine widespread use.[9][55] MHRA CEO June Raine said ""no corners cut approving it"",[56] that, ""the benefits outweigh risk"".
 Reading rest paragraphs one provides information. 

This also front page source:

:) least 70% getting vaccine needed herd immunity, honestly, 25% saying good figure. Plus, know even good amount people get later anyway they've seen everyone else get issue. Wish headlines like KNOW 30% people refusing get it. shit.   feel too. absolutely wear masks subways, crowded areas, etc summer that‚Äôs still required, really don‚Äôt want throw another summer away, assuming friends/family vaccinated too. live near border, rumors ship car across border, take private helicopter across meet it. can't believe legal myself, apparently loophole. already treat body like tent. Bring vaccine! Hit ASAP! Cousin friends tested positive group. girlfriend slept bed him, never tested positive. tricky thing, virus taught well.  target reopening things reaching herd immunity, lowering hospitalization death rates back reasonable levels, given populations worst outcomes vaccinated first happen much sooner reaching herd immunity 53?!?! God damnit Remember mainstream media discredited (Fact Check!) President's claim vaccine way year? true, 10 severe cases BioNTech trial, 1 vaccinated group. So, numbers hold still see vaccinated people get severe disease rarely. enough vaccine, sure, people said flu, get first. President va, congress. Sure. White house staff, gets covid dies taking placebo, harm life‚Äôs work capable describing. 

1. zero reason get vaccinated knows it.

2. won‚Äôt risk fueling anti-vaccine dopes.

3. would prefer avoid covid die. 

Three reasons get vaccinated. may more. Take extra year school. already saved costs dorming. either walk away savings spend staying 1 year longer half schedule finding part time work. That‚Äôs anecdotal. Toddlers constantly moods shifts, they‚Äôll throw fit randomly unexpectedly. fiddle masks time. Blame parents, child zero reasoning skills. US, search ""&lt;your state's vaccine plan"" and/or watch governor's recent press conference. Damn. Right next clinic. *Ballsy.* keep wearing mask then, hear super effective Avoid possible yet unknown long term side effects? Probably look like either one. family member works nursing home. agree people‚Äôs wishes come first since affected.

Which understandable. choice large chance never seeing loved ones IrL higher risk getting disease likely survive, think would choose?

Especially since lockdowns harder nursing home residents rest us things lives visits family keep mental health going.

It matter statistics say isn't.

It matter experts say isn't.

That's moving goal posts. claim one thing someone goes proves wrong keep moving next thing argument tiny, insignificant, flawed, nobody argue there's literally nothing argue against.

Sure, one argue instances vaccine group, were. that's interpret data listen people know that.

You say numerically higher, said ""notable"" arguing against. notable, significantly different. at, guarantee tons places US also. go masked walk park house everyday tons people maskless, even (on multiple occasion) people bikes seeming purposefully want ride near people without masks. 

The place enforced inside public buildings, entire state. positive state exception. People still visiting family plenty maskless things. Cant say article particularly wrong anything strategy explicitly herd immunity, herd immunity effect strategy. least told,

To date I‚Äôve seen lot data efficacy vaccine preventing severe symptoms someone catches covid. haven‚Äôt seen much indicate reduces rate transmission. 

Which might actually create opposite effect. vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent getting covid, makes vast majority cases mild asymptomatic decreasing communicability, could see rapid increase covid cases everyone vaccinated, ideally sharp decrease death rates overall. 

This could, however, hide part story numbers would include drastic decrease deaths vaccinated populations, likely increase deaths unvaccinated populations (as general population whole longer following precautionary measures). Yeah, man. need stop uptight. mean, it‚Äôs like country‚Äôs frontline healthcare workers pleading cooperation relief civil unrest whipped order serve interest corrupt leadership.

The problem entire pandemic people indulging selfish natures. wanting wear masks, wanting give going eat, wanting sacrifice holidays, on.

If people willing get vaccinated stop giving shit everyone else get it, selfish ""screw got mine"" behavior help people mentioned groups can't get vaccinated yet.

Getting vaccinated important. Getting people unsure vaccine board also important. can't leave large groups people unprotected without trying.   post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Corporations know enough they‚Äôve literally able tell women pregnant based purchases/internet searches. people still think government needs kind microchip track you. I‚Äôve feeling way, too. huge discussion vaccinating ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù? 3/4 deaths come folks aged 55+ ... cut coronavirus deaths 3/4, would require cultural pressure today? think problem social media, culture individualism - ""I'm smartest person room underlings care about.""


What social media allow people gain confidence mobs. I‚Äôm preschool teacher, 3yos wear masks day except snack. beginning school year, needed reminders encouragement, they‚Äôre completely used problems.

Young children take cues parents. parent makes big deal masks, kid too. previous years, I‚Äôve students complained about/ refused wear shoes, jackets, gloves, hats, even pants. However, things widely accepted, parents work kids get comfortable wearing them. You‚Äôd never hear parent argue child shouldn‚Äôt wear pants public! Masks different; another piece clothing that‚Äôs uncomfortable get used it. Bold prediction : Italian government find every reason blame average Italians instead themselves. week‚Äôs end, nearly 30,000 doses expected 11 locations San locations include San Antonio State Hospital, North Central Baptist Hospital, St. Luke‚Äôs Baptist Hosptial, Christus Santa Rosa Medical Center, Christus Santa Rosa Hospital - Westover Hills, Methodist Hospital Methodist Children‚Äôs Hospital, Methodist Metropolitan Hospital, Northeast Baptist Hosptial, Wellness 360 Baptist Medical Center. can‚Äôt really work sort threat represents us simply comparing numbers dead.

A relevant figure compare would deaths per capita. would less third reach 600k deaths.

More relevant still would work much loss life represents. Given average age someone dying Covid 91 Spanish flu 28, 6 times less loss life per death. even reach 600k deaths Covid, would roughly one 18th loss life per capita Spanish Flu.  thought trials measuring transmission. basing statement something else? know? That's mighty sad... maybe understand long flight objection risk catching covid drops almost 100% almost 0%, surely long flight worth it?

And good authority Vietnam plenty beach-adjacent hostels hotels haha. Oh well lives... tired clickbait fake news country reality. Well, convention wanted go late August announced hold next year return 2022. disheartening understand went route. thought Pfizer barely hand process making vaccine. Wow, click article check actual headline. Literally 4 people entire trial (almost 30,000 people) developed Bell‚Äôs palsy, also ratio people general may develop Bell‚Äôs palsy. 328 million people USA. guess 200 million less want get vaccine, others may want approved ( children 16, etc). Rollout expects 20M vaccinated Dec, 30M+ Jan, 50M Feb ( total 100M+). March add another 50M. So, numbers correct looking 150M 200M willing vaccinated opportunity vaccinated USA end March. Ahh ok, get saying. Though I've read number studies surgical masks help prevent spread influenza. Also, wondering studies handy COVID pathogens particle differences COVID influenza. would love read them. 

Here study mentioned above. Vaccines prevent infection. you‚Äôre already infected, it‚Äôs late. vaccine cannot treat covid. prevent haven‚Äôt caught yet. like question stated. Wearing mask exercising jack shit except virtue signaling. Huh? post makes sense reply said. passed legislation already let expire. could pass again. It‚Äôs bull shit couldn‚Äôt done more. still aren‚Äôt. mean AZ/Oxford *your* governor read *The Art Deal* toddler bedtime story? not, hell not? makes sad see country used political bat time people dying. even seem find joy numbers going up, proven right.

The media coverage exactly best, often ignoring restrictions recommendations place back spring. guess helped birth myth ""Sweden nothing"", even though far case.

Sweden opted long-term strategy, thinking would hold long time vaccine arrived. hindsight, strategy may best, especially execution really poor. far ""letting virus run wild"" ""not anything"".

And like people misusing Sweden example back summer anti-lockdown age, others using pro-lockdown agenda. reality problems Sweden's handling much complex mere matter pro vs anti lockdown.

If interested, much discussed learned Sweden's approach. many mistakes repeated, highlights badly prepared country crisis whatsoever. please, try show bit respect. Remember together, actual people dying. wanna sleep everyone deny rural patients. Maybe send South Dakota something. Make giant hospice Covid deniers, Pence Mother Theresa Lmao Many ""third world"" countries far better Sweden despite exposed virus earlier, like Vietnam, Thailand Philippines.

As countries worse, countries higher population density, older populations, weaker health systems cannot compared directly Sweden. hand, Sweden rightfully compared demographically similar Scandinavian neighbors, fraction death rate. Gee, wonder differently? family, sadly. removed many people. snooze relatives wasn‚Äôt ready fully remove. always little hope may become wise 30 days up. yet. know end walle everyone comes ship goes ""woah""

Vax Get approved start mass vaccinations, let's finally start getting things back normal. believe 2021, please let us work suppress flu infections, Covid? I'm going see dad, seen year, 500-mile drive I'd stopping least once, maybe more, restroom breaks. 

I still see mom stepdad Christmas, though. We're 3-person 'pod' see grocery store people medical people. they're like 100-mile drive here, see monthly never stop.

As soon dad vaccinated, cases deaths dropping notably, I'll going visit him, though. Hmmmmm sound mad value child's life money. quite frank you, worked since 2017 issue dominat hand receive assistance for. yes please go ahead privileged bullshit. appreciable amount time.

It complete failure businessman execute contracts return amazing gains. turns seasonal factor. beating USA took summer *was* low season.  petty staffers White House refusing wear masks going big holiday parties. galls get priority medical staff risking lives front lines.

Those white house staffers day-to-day minutia Trump Pence combined. *especially* important right now, cooperation, petty small-time White House staff, necessary transition process has, everyone knows, delayed several weeks. 

The White House functioning going let Biden administration come in, actually resources start vaccine distribution plan, mention national security issues more. that's besides day-to-day minutia necessary general country operate. refusing wear masks going big holiday parties

Yeah, jackasses, yet worth karmic justice something unoptimal.  We‚Äôre part, friend. hope wife gets vaccine week! Yes, takes 4-5 weeks month become immunized vaccinated timelines work one-another. announcing routes deliveries many places due credible security threats. Even reason wear masks everything limit spread get back 2019 ASAP.

The pandemic doesn‚Äôt go away stop taking precautions.

In fact, governor Florida blamed summer surge News Media talking enough CoVID19. Exactly like would child. Constant praise right thing live opposite church seen people going whole time, including gathering groups chat courtyard. Pray home!! Church waiting many fellow parishioners 2% decline daily growth rate lot. daily growth rate United States right 3% (speaking quite roughly, averages whole country). 

2% sound like much, realize means United States' COVID growth rate could cut almost 70% universal mask wearing alone. Get number 0% continuous decline cases. Universal mask wearing probably effective single available tool, things like local lockdowns restrictions businesses like bars ideally filling gaps hotspots.

Note, case 2% means going 3% 1%, going 3% 2.94%. modernas vaccine gets approved I'd ask means they're gonna cut shit know better. Congrats America getting vaccinated tomorrow (Monday). Living New Zealand sucks. unlikely we'll get vaccine half year now. Yep. thought Trump gonna divert shit like PPE headed Mass(?) shit started. Nearly every expert saying going gradual shift back normal takes place months starting first doses administered population instant switch 

So really breaking news lot people there! took few. 100pct pandemic measures place (masking distancing). rises 100pct without that. People keep forgetting that, first global novel pandemic lifetime, circumstances unprecedented. Even vaccine trial circumstances unprecedented.  Sorry LOT sort through. guess funeral service 250 (in big church masks distancing terrible). uncle expected 150 show dinner 60 did. STILL way many least 80% people sense. uncle extremely confused piles leftover food. 

[This supper true, list notably absent daily Spanish flu deaths, though don‚Äôt really daily count Overall, recommendations endorse physician consultations heart screenings ‚Äî using electrocardiograms, echocardiograms troponin blood tests ‚Äî athletes moderate severe Covid-19. Heart screening recommended people cases asymptomatic mild. 

Based Covid cause heart issues mild asymptomatic cases too. Anyone Covid screened heart issues, especially experiencing long hauler symptoms. Seems places mandated masks places seeing biggest uptick cases. No, don‚Äôt.

We enough fully vaccinate even highest risk groups. LPN &amp; agree completely. change fact old white man largely unknown black community year built trust community. people say people entirely different beasts. there's bad news surfaces vaccine, true not, I'm sure brakes put lot people. All's going take handful loudmouths got one dose vaccine, stripped mask bother keep distance day one, get sick headline news ""Dozens people hospitalized Coronavirus even got vaccine."" care read fine print one shot blew caution wind. Lockdown causes spread. Everyone going work catching virus, going home giving whole family. Everyone done worse colder months. 

Low humidity also helps virus thrive. Colder weather weakens people‚Äôs immune systems. USA didn‚Äôt even cases sept. Almost everywhere except states fantastically summer. 

Ny prime example. everything right, break daily case record, people going back inside thanks cold weather. Thank you! I've never heard Kalamazoo, guys singing songs it!  human raised humans also agree confirm Cleveland Clinic start floating nurses unit unit soon they‚Äôre losing nurses like flies (often they‚Äôre stuff outside work together).

My mother, NICU nurse hadn‚Äôt worked adults since 1980s, furious moment. reason isn‚Äôt floated yet unit many people already can‚Äôt float anyone Literally none related coronavirus vaccine, none proven true. linked review articles possibility happening vaccines whole. fact. non-essential workers getting first? choice ""medical intervention"" nothing. choice controlled ""intervention"" vaccine proven safe, uncontrolled ""intervention"" courtesy live SAR-CoV-2 - proven kill, cause long-term inflammatory effects. arguments vaccine based fear, data.""

except isnt true statistically speaking. 100% people get virus. trial, number got infected small. Right? mean making ideas going effect fertility too, thought that's doing.

Seriously though, get vaccinated. Covid worse vaccine. Period. vaccine work either allowing get Covid, they'll stop reporting ""Covid Deaths"" people die something happen also covid. Either way, numbers go down.

The lockdown masks continue big government likes control now. Well Spanish flu definitely many spots list then. killed almost 700k Americans short period time. lockdown. pandemic. part understand?

Shake rocks head. Fundamentally, private companies meant maximise returns shareholders. look maximise revenue decrease costs. Revenues made premiums (and investing premiums). Costs overheads paying insurance claims - payouts divided revenues believe called payout ratio. Insurance companies look keep payout ratio low possible. Fundamentally, interest aligned - insurance company wants pay little possible relative premiums earned. Actually Posse Comitatus Act makes military personnel bad choice kind work. Unfortunately, people know say hospitals fraudulently counting covid cases get funds, continuing downplay pandemic. time also hear people faking negative covid results travel. would need fake results cases werent real. end, total number extra deaths cause year telling. People keep forgetting 300+ K deaths masking distancing hospitals constant danger overload even amid pandemic measures. benefits health open economy keeping job health insurance benefits, flat negated resulting hospital overrun. Sure, scenario health insurance attend medical needs, hospitals dont capacity pay medical attention. german translate via deepl.com Guess headline 2-3 weeks. define what's meaning ""conspiracy theories"".

These vaccines new possible many rushed. possible people die taking vaccine. better learn deal reasonable questions, instead using ""easy way out"" saying people reading conspiracy theories. Escorts place apparently, plus company‚Äôs trucks escorts, too, said Thursday. clear whether meant local police government officials, possibly private guards, declined elaborate details interview, citing security concerns. trucks leaving Pfizer‚Äôs facility tracked ‚Äúby minute,‚Äù it‚Äôs president vice president (in fact apparently president won‚Äôt getting vaccine he‚Äôs Covid recently) It‚Äôs petty staffers White House refusing wear masks going big holiday parties. galls get priority medical staff risking lives front lines.

And it‚Äôs pretty unclear they‚Äôre ‚Äúrun country‚Äù days‚Ä¶ deferred authority state governors. trying grift country way door, much. make lazy, uneducated 

Yah explain constitutions made. ü§£ü§£ü§£ actually bush people, set pandemic plan personally guarantee doesn‚Äôt effect it? Lol you‚Äôre talking ass. I'm going everything everyone. State charges would high-level vandalism. would almost certainly federal charges, well. would know now. Many thousands people vaccine four months. mRNA lasts week body.

Effectively known side effects almost every single vaccine ever immediate within months injection. I'm sorry hear that.

And Belgians, people, know better throw around 'Nazi' label trivially. Let's hope common sense prevails. Thanks nurse, wife one real heros. Florida‚Äôs deaths per capita almost 2x CA. Don‚Äôt bring weak sauce analysis here. Pretend ideas piece paper change anytime people want too. Heck could even change name country ""words matter peoples lives"" name country people wanted it.  anyone checked see Covid tired winning? Dude even look up. chance 100m people aforementioned demographics. Yes would. ok, say could get one tomorrow, 8 months, going take? Yes forced get specific vaccine we're quite far point person choose specific vaccine. know guidelines, claim Sweden nothing else rules group sizes social gatherings? Lol. Meanwhile cases increasing FL. simply behind curve bit. might want check metrics deaths per capita walk Reddit conversation look like fool. making opinion without research it? spreading educated opinion onlinev Hang tight friend, know, breaking point hit many, mine coming too.

This absolute hell I‚Äôm tired whole thing. want life back, hell need back. mental health really taken downturn

I want nothing outside apartment day foreseeable future. I‚Äôm sick place, it‚Äôs nice apartment So, argument, entire population USA already covid. Talk herd 

Well majority people get asympomatic. Also lump normal flu rates Covid one one reason.
We never shutdown even high flu rates past flu seasons. typically rates higher winter thats peak flu season at.

"" think 3 percent death rate (maybe 2 percent less now)""
I mean think actually know?

""Initially, requiring hospitalization, death rate 10 percent, though believe 5 percent according recent data""
Possibly retired folks. Anyone 65 99.9 % survival rate. Loads data that.
We already old folks facilities largely isolated begin with.
That doesnt warrant total shutdown hence people utilizing freedom assembly protest government protocols. 

""Unfortunately, everyone survives always 100 percent recovery.""
Majority recover healthy state unless one old multiple comorbidities. Germany instances EMA take look studies. Paul Ehrlich Institute approval authority Germany EMA.

I cant imagine work. gov't paying gyms, restaurant, small businesses 80% made last year. oh no, fascists republicans say that's socialism. fascist tell business, give people business squat go ahead defy order, anti constitutional there's covid. forget wave american/blue line flag push poverty.

Look much mismanagement happened. could shut business 3 weeks, gov't cuts net checks employees business file refund average week 2019. could done early april then, employ unemployed contact tracing tamp resurgence virus people coming mexico/canada europe, etc.  building arbitrage bot ? 

Like prices different different exchanges . find anomaly , exploit it. Anything I've read one dose data inconclusive phase 3 trial two dose recipients. sarcasm China better large nation earth. Eh, I'll take word. I'll probably get vaccinated another year I'm lucky (I'm depending Bolsonaro, so, really bad even starts *anything*, I'll need wait elderly, doctors, sick people...) effects would know  Godspeed!! Also doesn‚Äôt account died result covids effects society. Lost cousin last week (not quite sure what), seems like Covid following loss job broke him. hardworking guy according limited info (he kinda distant), drank sun sundown covid started.

I know he‚Äôs one long shot Really? So, Dad (who 70 Diabetes) would likely vaccinated somewhere Q1? I‚Äôm somewhat vaccine Lol Western chuds shambles China‚Äôs excellent response. Stuttgart eerily quiet window today. need get food tomorrow see howquiet comparison march lockdown. last month business usual,albeit mask wearing outside well inside. Good. necessary send signal people actually truthful versus taking words mad man. Stage III trials two dose recipients. data come from? understand ‚ÄúLong-hauler‚Äù quite medical sounding ring it, rolls tongue lot better ‚Äúlong-COVID‚Äù opinion. Women concerned variety medical issues. Medical sexism extremely common. nothing he‚Äôs handled COVID, hasn‚Äôt done particularly well at. 

It‚Äôs name recognition pathological fear state income tax infected many Dems state. Leave something behind vaccine people. (almost) Europe hade lockdowns virus Still spreading. lockdowns saved alot lifes didnt stop pandemic. maybe look reality? Again, lockdowns saved lives, think right lockdowns havent erased pandemic. Yep. Could worse, we‚Äôll still enough vaccinate risk groups. He‚Äôs idiot tho sound like scarified safety lmfaooo nice I'd [look climate see state(s) region increasing too. [Here's cases per guess tricky part map climates wont fit neatly state borders, even see similar pattern NV CA, albeit NV seems ahead CA. bright side NV seems plateaued, CA probably couple weeks too. believe AZ following similar path moment quite high hospitalisations

I understand viruses seasonal though. know we've seen behaviour known coronaviruses (including MERS-CoV), think anyone's pinpointed *why* yet know unless you‚Äôre specific high risk groups occupations months best chance vaccine US?

And many people rural/isolated areas America option vaccine B difficult transport store. instance, zero hospitals Hawaii large swathes flyover states capable hitting Pfizers cold storage needs. They‚Äôll store dry ice shipping containers makes accessing thawing small batches untenable, distribution Lot complicated.

It‚Äôs like picking cereal brand Walmart. hell downvoted?? appreciate song reference lol   NH dem here. expected hoped NH keeping step Mass spring. I‚Äôm also proud town, many others NH, took upon created enforce mask mandates. said that, voted him...but wished Volinsky. yes (more one vaccine) someone generally extremely injecting race discussions, think point valid. Black people suffered way, suffering lead many distrustful vaccines. long gets people responsible understanding science works, I'm ok it. think loosen restrictions now? Last week 3 days lost 3000 people per day guess what? going week. think government stop bailing friends billionaires help small businesses 3 -4 months. survive.  thought well  wanna get at-risk populations vaccinated cases decline, would restrictions need continue? Well that's better successful USA beating COVID  nothing could done hospitals point, even places ICU's running staffing issues. issues fixed summer people states less hit transfer help, EVERY state fire, anywhere get people from. Uh scientists, big pharmaceutical companies extremely shady history vaccinations. Please inform speaking like idiot. Key point success people paid AU$1,200 AU$1,500 every fortnight (two weeks) stay home. lasted, hmm, 8 months least, think. posted group truly upset me. understand WH staff could mean anybody (i.e. security, housekeeping etc.). Thousands people dying continue hear ""rigged"" election. 

Seriously --- ask daily serious WH briefings express nation severity situation. need trump politician. need someone federal government. done nothing justify reasoning behind receiving vaccine along side FDA approved individuals. posters asked, ""what else could federal government do?"" Literally -- broadcast facts. That's it. When's last time U.S. federal broadcast COVID? 

I'm --- ashamed. care 30+ vaccines going WH. Every single vaccine headed facilities providing healthcare. Absolutely ridiculous occurring country advertises equity. Ashamed. loss, even pandemic something easy accommodate customer perfectly easy allow curbside pay phone! Today day leaned Kalamazoo real fucking place. Lol.

Easy remedy : Cut potato half thyme along apply skin vaccine needle used.. suck mercury ease.


/s r/collapse probably real estate investors might end underwater though, given climate change that... data literally date, next day. also get folks saying vaccine( didnt) wear mask anymore, another issue deal with.

Vaccination cards apparently response issue people still assuming going mask good enough

A lot communities even that. Oh agree, currently aid, businesses scenario?  agree,folks wont wear masks,you get people fighting...or worse ...

trying get mask up,fights stores,in public etc. mean differentiate? also get folks saying vaccine( didnt) wear mask anymore, another issue deal with.  *Ifa mya grandama wheels she'da TRUCK!* don‚Äôt understand people even asking cases keep climbing

People write article think people read comment on. Case point: took time make comment. like wearing masks want to. fuck make fog glasses. forced wear one definitely cannot wait day don‚Äôt wear walk damn dog. thought popes forehead second lol Perhaps, COVID long-haulers (loss productivity, medical / disability spending) offset gains killing grandma grandpa 10 years early think [THIS may got image from. recognized typed here, remember seeing information found article. hate fuck. like white house, say virus exist want vaccine first. piece shit demand vaccines states. already noticed got higher percentage states first shipment (according nyt) Democratic hoax ring bell you? they've planning supply chain weeks ever since trials ended, logistics anything. pretty moot hijackers since sub zero cold chain, fragile. dry ice needed keep least -70C.

The Tale Eric Dread Gazebo 
by Richard Aronson (aronson@sierratel.com) 


...In early seventies, Ed Whitchurch ran ""his game,"" one participants Eric Sorenson. Eric plays something like computer. games methodically considers possibility choosing preferred option. given time, invariably pick optimal solution. known take weeks. otherwise, respects, superior gamer.

Eric playing Neutral Paladin Ed's game. lord's lands following exchange occurred:

ED: see well groomed garden. middle, small hill, 
see gazebo. 
ERIC: gazebo? color it? 
ED: (Pause) white, Eric. 
ERIC: far away it? 
ED: 50 yards. 
ERIC: big it? 
ED: (Pause) 30 ft across, 15 ft high, pointed top. 
ERIC: use sword detect good it. 
ED: good, Eric. gazebo. 
ERIC: (Pause) call it. 
ED: answer. gazebo. 
ERIC: (Pause) sheathe sword draw bow arrows. 
respond way? 
ED: No, Eric, gazebo! 
ERIC: shoot bow (roll hit). happened? 
ED: gazebo arrow sticking it. 
ERIC: (Pause) wounded? 
ED: COURSE NOT, ERIC! GAZEBO! 
ERIC: (Whimper) +3 arrow! 
ED: gazebo, Eric, GAZEBO! really want try 
destroy it, could try chop axe, suppose, 
could try burn it, know anybody would even try. 
It's @#$%!! gazebo! 
ERIC: (Long pause. axe fire spells.) run away. 
ED: (Thoroughly frustrated) late. awakened gazebo. 
It catches eats you. 
ERIC: (Reaching dice) Maybe I'll roll fire-using mage 
I avenge Paladin. 


At point, increasingly amused fellow party members restored modicum order explaining Eric gazebo is. Thus ends tale Eric Dread Gazebo. could worse; least gazebo grassy gnoll. demand hassle cost free! tried y‚Äôall voted red.  Florida man doubles vaccine dose taking half much saying is...water wet? really embarrassing still discussing denying 9 months pandemic. Uncomfortable reality. like reinfections, thing. look it, accept it, exist (or rare). Bury head sand move on. 37 days left jobs. 21 days separating doses needed get full immunity serve little public good. th everyone would homeless get work. people commute. bother read facts see want reports: try pain anti-vaxxers victims, please. way.

A look cold hard facts helps mask mandates slows spread 2 percent kind makes chill bit.

That number high enough go effort put one sake others, high feel need get angry others feeling different.

Really though last three months so, seen two people wear one called for, don‚Äôt really much angry hear different states.

But realize state always top 5 states cases per capita despite high compliance early adoption, look Denmark Canada much better long without them, remind really aren‚Äôt game changers, one many tools toolkit. yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

RemindMe! 100 Days ""How many people vaccinated far"" believe that‚Äôs guy died, Sununu. poor government Christmas holidays start earlier. kid return school 2021. Stop spreading antivaxx [Mild Lets math using USA numbers. population America 330 million. 1 percent 3.3 million. 0.1 percent 330,000.

So, argument, entire population USA already covid. Talk herd immunity!

Now lets talk realistic numbers.  think 3 percent death rate (maybe 2 percent less now). Initially, requiring hospitalization, death rate 10 percent, though believe 5 percent according recent data. things improving.

Now talking people expire. Unfortunately, everyone survives always 100 percent recovery. Correct I‚Äôm wrong, thought New Hampshire didn‚Äôt shut much Vermont Massachusetts did. uncle driving (from WMass,) spring could still go eat, think. Yeah uncle died embolism (not caused covid). want die alone hospital go. doctor told aunt likely treatable. Majored. graduated. degree fucking computer science. would take 4 years constitutional change. Nazis ruin EVERYTHING It‚Äôs matter days rich famous get ahold vaccine start live lavish lifestyle everyone else waits months dose. weird anti vax, cautious something that's developed haste. comes back issue. know can't know. impossible us know sure specific vaccine long term effects people long. End story. Please post/comment music links. 


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think global pandemic counts massive cataclysm? That's science works; impossible prove negative.

Either way, medical decisions prerogative, saying individuals getting vetted approved vaccine ""guinea pigs"" misleading point misinformation. Brinker we‚Äôll always together think covid-19 distant memory people study pandemic, gravity 300k+ dead modern society finally set in.  Uh...what? see sarcasm there. basically exactly happening. Dude stopped president got clock cleaned election. Live free die! I'm aware situation vaccination necessary infection. Definitely consult child's immunologist regarding need vaccination. case may different average individual. memory cells quickly activate defenses exposed antigen resembling previous invading virus. Well, get emails whenever someone tests positive, I‚Äôm seeing anything close outbreak. several cases, one traceable spread one person work someone infected. speak experiences though... going get injected soon possibly can. nothing voting, every health initiative, drug, vaccine deserves scrutiny. believe passed scrutiny, people like make people hesitant trust stuff saying essentially ""Shut fuck take vaccine stupid idiot"". ridiculous. fuck mumbling now. government trillions dollars debt can't spend money wisely. spend trillions war can't feed starving citizens. create regulations fines associated regulations continue generate money wastefully spend. 

Let's cut regulation, make government smaller, put money back pockets allow make decisions best families. Whether seat belt laws, mask mandates, speed limits, parking tickets, whatever. government supposed work people, create regulation steer money back pockets. Apparently know ""Provisional"" means. Cope Work prison upstate New York, 620 positive inmates 40 civilian workers including nurses, hits prisons hard. would feel good wouldn‚Äôt it. no, fake head cold. Masks make breathing hurt freedom sad. 

Americans love individual rights ruining it. Individual freedoms mean shit use freedom help fellow humans. please dont tell anti vaxxer  done things early enough yes. whether ‚Äúneed‚Äù lockdowns point depends trying accomplish. favor whatever takes shortest amount time possible bc even without lockdowns small business still getting hurt really badly. Australia Taiwan are.... idea.

I surgery July 11th I'm guessing then, I'm sure.

It's hard get infected local area surging 20% live city. think might underestimating contagious therefore dangerous Covid is. republicans filibustering nearly everything democrats wanted pass senate talk nuclear option brought up. Republicans haven‚Äôt need majority try dismantle democracy thru senate.

Also split 115 congress. Mitch problem bringing things vote republicans controlled house There‚Äôs gonna ton them. It‚Äôll take years get distance us pandemic, there‚Äôll quarantine love story family drama sorts stuff. It‚Äôll like made Steve Jobs movies.  need go back 2019 way life though. No-one wants interact people zoom reasonable. crazy sub changed earlier months scorched earth takes  president? height lockdown, rules, alongside Israel‚Äôs, [harshest lockdown rules world. 

So harshest lockdown earth get zero cases three months. coincidence eh? Okay. There‚Äôs nothing add. Home health option people. depends situation. It‚Äôs big thing seniors particular. POWNED HAHA ""we Sweden doing"" crowd forgets. would reject hand Social Democracy Nordic models enables countries like Denmark, Norway, Sweden Finland ""communism"" system allowed respond way did. Look many people drive drunk speed recklessly roads America. always apparent ton people easily risk people's lives avoid little inconvenience. see people got Pfizer vaccine unusual side effect lingering fish smell. Looks like you‚Äôre wrong. Enjoy hunkering til next winter! reading pre-Covid article said IRL interactions generate ten times much empathy. 

That could reason judgementalism cynicism. working hard getting rid judgmentalism isn‚Äôt healthy society. creeps don‚Äôt IRL close human interaction. could one biggest losses humanity come social distancing, maybe whole pandemic.

You can‚Äôt count measure way Covid deaths, incalculable harm society. Eh. wrong ignore something like allergic reaction, weird autoimmune disease something might cause bad reaction vaccine, way see it, ingredients sound fancy chemical names, relatively safe chemicals food grade exposed often. want give impression vaccine 100% without risk. would naive statement. I'm saying learn Pfizer vaccine, less fear it. 

3-Methylbutyl ethanoate

That chemical sounds scary. that's makes bananas smell like bananas.  hilarious long term effects people never back claims ignore rebuttals answers. exact type thinking like clockwork. actually read guidelines, heard aspects make comments based that.

Edit: also, man pic *not* Governor Agreed. see much hesitancy fueled anti-vaxxers belief vaccines give everyone dreaded autism. People often ask veterinarians vaccines cause animal autism too. Hopefully people get vaccinated enough case numbers drop. 

Many people care anymore. hospital bills horrific ICU care $8000 $10000 day, thats specialists care rehabilitation, testing, ambulance bills. People could saddled half million dollar bill. best insurance plan USA might pay 20% that. Many US states Medicaid adults.

Sweden's problems come border controls. Sweden could easily closed borders like Norway Finland (the 2 countries Sweden borders). fact every sovereign country ability close borders chose to. look virus spreads, advantages disadvantages formulate plan show leadership get compliance. example, US taken proper measures used advantages beginning instead nothing might seen case numbers deaths halved could considered success. Sweden, similar numbers Norway Finland achieved possible choose wrong. goes Ireland (an island population New Zealand 1st case day). One took quick decisive action numbers show one which. U tried.

-Frank Wilhoit mean could look LA County site's numbers see personal experience universal. [This](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/covid19_recovery_dashboard.htm) data 500 fewer hospitalizations today.

So time 18% countywide ICU capacity. I'm sure much ICU capacity filled COVID patients, however math see county roughly 2200 total beds sitting tight 400 available beds additional 500 COVID patients added... 2 days. take will. idea many 500 intakes go ICU, we've got 400 slots work moment influx people going stop anytime soon.

If obnoxiously vocal opinions, they'd chance quietly back pretend never actually thought vaccines Satan's water bottle backwash something, stands, dropping anti-vax rhetoric means admitting bullshit, implies suckered lemmings along. Since worldview central pillar self-esteem built conceit they've got blue-chip information makes better ignorant sheeple, never happen Based upvotes appears ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù That's strategy - let virus spread ""slowly carefully"" herd immunity would reached without overloading hospitals.

I agree first bit - spread acceptable, even ignored (The spread low risk groups). think goal full herd immunity. happened disease far know. goal hospitals overloaded mitigations required could maintained long would needed, vaccine. guessed 1-2 years. 
So basically strategy is: ""what maintain 1-2 years, legally/constitutionally possible, overload healthcare point time""? let virus spread ""slowly carefully""

Which country strategy? *Of course* acceptable level spread. countries reached uncotrolled society spread (most countries, is) decide acceptable level is. 

Almost none decided 0% acceptable level, measures required reach back 0 spread legally ethically possible democratic countries. Europe shelter place orders spain northern Italy spring, healthcare already overwhelmed. eradicate disease. acceptable level Sweden certainly decided higher places. That's tradeoff maintaining normal society (such school years lost) vs minimizing cost lives lost Covid. one can't argue country acceptable nonzero level spread ""herd immunity strategy"".

Hi, would mind pointing post referring? rest world wishes received covid stimulus. True. also messaging fucking upside down. hard give us facts. Kids spread it, anyone else, need back work. don‚Äôt know anything assume worst. That‚Äôs typical proclaimed far left. Either educate trust educated. can‚Äôt doubt suspicions based suspicions.

Sununu capable support middle State. Rumors flying he'll try take Senate seat away Maggie 2022 interesting say least.

I think Sununu ride governor try become face GOP years past. calm, kind, mostly immune feeding fake facts, plus he's great making people feel understood. think would well president shocked see selected VP point political career. He's GOP try emulate.

That said, I'm stay blue he's Republicans need. arguing sake it. vaccination process begun, UK. kind asshole. Anime better...

The two way related. that, certainly isolated, probably was, think it, Churches open, people go church, work, etc. There's less education spread word then, especially hte Internet get immediate information. remote, schooling, work, church etc wtihout actually attending person slow spread. Also lack disinfectant probably something easily attainable like stores pick up. Also cover mouths cough, used hands cover it, suggested using arms cover coughs. Different times, better tools education. yeah really understand importance isomers back then. One isomer really effective safe, isomer caused horrific birth defects. think that's going issue covid vaccine they're allowing used pregnant women case. need stop moving goalposts. Every time lose people go ""well people keep saying never gonna end bother taking precautions?""

The American government told us clear day: help us. Middle America go recession prop corporations.

People need relief. need people go back normal, can't move goalposts more. people get two pokes, able return normal life. say otherwise cruel.

Besides, goal never eradication. goal reduce deaths hospitalizations overwhelm health care system (no vaccinated individual got covid severe case, likely reduces severity disease), bring infection rate cases start trending downwards. Even people return normal getting vaccine, goals fulfilled.  OK, forget analogy. opinion subject, form opinion subject, right say subject created opinion? even getting first one 52% 85% effective, roughly? 

That's incredible. Since feeling lot people ""on fence"" get vaccine get second one if/when experience *any* side effects. 

I imagine lot people get first shot. I‚Äôm still waiting Planned Parenthood‚Äôs abortonplex. Probably best Onion article time. experts claiming spring developed countries, surprised takes longer. Also, developed countries, developing countries long road ahead say wear mask?

Asking people wear mask guilt tripping people vaccine.

Where's folks screaming NY control compared Florida rest country? happened? So.... get vaccine, do... safe?

It would mean would less demand vaccine, would think would easier get  enough vaccinate 250 million 267 million eligible Americans? That‚Äôs 93.6 percent rate. Right 8-9 percent Americans refuse take vaccines. 250 million doses enough carry vaccination program vaccine stop pandemic several reasons. people take it, 100% effective, know long effective for. massively help still need measures e.g. social distancing Laughing gas capsules? think normal sane person would've thought, ""hey kid can't spread covid cuz know, care like that."" Thank you!! 


Also, fuckin knew it. ü§òü§ò average person still want wear mask. vaccines start impacting deaths hospitalizations, personal risk wearing mask become greater public risk. is, I‚Äôm likely catch individually sick, I‚Äôm less likely kill grandma getting sick. Right risks high. Later one high.

We want get place risk low both. need locked 3 weeks without medical care, released test negative. what‚Äôs alternative? Tell everyone say bye mom/dad grandpa/graandma cause don‚Äôt want wear mask? family isn‚Äôt important small inconveniences. jump extreme instead providing counter argument - many people unemployed 300k people died; 40 million?

They one same, able compartmentalize issues make feel better opinions. divided want, get chance better believe I'll line simply chance of

Already seeing family members post willing take vaccine despite family members get COVID talk much sucked. COVID going stick around far longer needs solely anti-vaccine morons. AstraZeneca Moderna vaccine taking much longer approval? UK Pfizer approved quickly, 2 seem taking longer despite applying approval much longer.

I think 2 reasons:
1. Data less clear
2. Less need emergency approval 1 vaccine already approved healthcare workers elderly already enough

Any thoughts? ....the first kind? =P estimates those? 2400$(600$ per week) ended months ago. one ""prepare"" lose income? Start making kids skip meals get used it? Why?

Is interest nation catch stop possible spreaders? group accounts 99.9% covid deaths vaccinated can‚Äôt get it, vaccinated people follow shit. Period. think it‚Äôs fair group vaccinated anyone fuck want.

I disagree. People want told feel politicians, bloggers, people make documentaries. real issue is, people want told feel certain things certain types subjects. shared room mate, who's flying Ohio two weeks holiday fun family friends. fucking hope he'll wake Everything said proven wrong fact we‚Äôve already reacted virus way have. way whole world has. opinion held weight, world would never shut first place. tbf, there's always force, article seems suggesting. forget stories US saved world suffering casualties! I‚Äôm chef got covid month ago. wear mask whole time course. heat steam kitchen can‚Äôt fucking breath all. makes work go high stress burns high stress burns holding covid fatigue cough without air.

I‚Äôm mask right non industry friends work home say ‚Äúyou get used it. Ya, wear things goose it‚Äôs fine, 10 hour shifts masks? Fuck cares Pfizer? AZeneca? Modena? Huh? Nothing draws crowds? Pretty sure Massachusetts White Mountains summer. Never seen campgrounds full.  anyone know protocol happens someone tests positive office space? exposed monday, still office week told friday someone tested positive. I'm encouraged get rapid tested back work Monday. feel breadth like protected. Anything I've found online seems grey area HR representative told quarantining 14 days guideline unless directly contact positive person. got tested told need get computer order work how. 'standard' going moved online changed repeatedly placed writing (to knowledge).

TLDR: I've exposed someone positive office still required office, do? One funeral home director recently got accused moving fake bodies local hospital make look like death toll high. extreme departure consensus reality... probably kind people can't believe they're dying covid. (Allegedly, people's last words really ""but hoax!"" making up.) vaccine give cancer blatantly joking come I'm one people never gets flu shot. Every time get it, get sick. Can't remember last time flu like symptoms year get shot. that's anecdotal, I'm one body headspace getting vaccinated time comes.

The flu shot able drastically reduce spread. anecdotal statement poor, damaging worst. recommend stop spreading lies. 

The flu shot cannot ever give flu. may feel bad day shot. cannot possibly get flu. get sick, it‚Äôs takes two weeks effective bad luck. body headspace irrelevant science. 

I suggest getting sooner, flu season. free US

And vaccine production US we'll getting first Protesting quarantines yeah hear 95% effective, let's forget 100% effective trials preventing *severe* disease, point *actually* say, like getting flu 5%. stats exist imo draw clicks. ignore various days 1918 pandemic anywhere near stats now. ignores massive amounts population growth, seems cheap. feel like express gravity situation without pointing curated statistics. vast majority aren‚Äôt risk?  That‚Äôs true all. already immune, saying healthy kid collapsed basketball court Friday night? it? reality everyone risk, even though likelihood severe disease low people, notion young people don‚Äôt need vaccinated return normal false. return normal dictated data, community spread stops driving elevated number hospitalizations, nothing change vaccine exists. needs administered demonstrate impact numbers. That‚Äôs works. Yeah that‚Äôs issue it‚Äôs widely available. campaigns likely start spring. Businesses first got 4000 euro back April. subsidized 70% missed earnings maximum 30,000 euro per month big businesses. Restaurants got extra help top that.

That said, still lot businesses struggle make ends meet try find ways ride pandemic out. protesting too, right? Reporting definitely factor. countries (Belgium one them) analysis excess deaths matches reported numbers quite well. countries noticeable (US, Spain) enormous (some South American countries) gap reported many excess deaths seen. Adjusted that, Peru example would 2500 deaths per million. saying excess deaths necessarily covid, given many countries reported excess deaths match well, ones doesn‚Äòt match explaining do. doubt lots excess deaths covid. free heavily subdisized lot Americans notorious able build even government 2 years election. basically two separate countries, speaking different languages hating other. It‚Äôs really toxic relationship. think non-at risk population risk potential long term negative health outcomes go back normal risk population vaccinated? I'm healthy I'd like stay way. government needs offer vaccine anyone wants it. That‚Äôs we‚Äôre almost half fuck full idiot fascists. responding line: lucky disease isn‚Äôt deadlier would screwed.

I mention Spanish flu, absolutely deadly Covid. I'm debating that. completely different diseases must compared mind. Different infection rate, different fatality rate, affects population. 

My point Covid's relatively low death rate makes hard many justify severe mitigation efforts. people's kids' lives line, would easier decision say fuck economy, close schools, etc. Many places fact Spanish flu. deadlier Covid might actually help decrease transmission, could compared Covid disease. government disorganized incapable basic logistics chances mobilization second dose going well ""slim none.""

Do even listen yourself? one it? Technically Santa Clause, Sinterklaas.

There's difference. Explain others idiots Children like wear masks. They're acting immature actual children. won't.

Guess often countries check stuff like card? Yes, life death. screw nurses doctors made far (survivorship bias), give elderly nursing homes. aside restaurants, people largely ignoring city care. argue restrictions worth necessary, LA strict measures book means nothing real world moment. Even among people know believe virus initially supported government, we've lost faith ""fuck it, nothing's going change anything"" mood. 

LA can't used evidence measures claims implemented. believe real someone close literally dies it. sometimes even then. That's dealing with. ~~Possibly~~ Probably :( actually 60% dosing US phase 3 trial. average across various dosing 90% already exists.

I found gave immunity measles despite getting MMR vaccine twice. chances tiiiiny. 

I‚Äôll getting another booster soon can, fingers crossed works time. Well, given spread kind misinformation everywhere can, would say no. would u vaccinate group people wont die group will. People hung deaths need lower want shit back track soon possible. forget 10% hit economy took, compared 5% Australia.

I'd rather Australian approach. You‚Äôre wrong here:

Vaccines lover severity too. 

Which turn means body fights off, makes weaker, spread much smaller fraction.

So even 60% vaccinated population (using vaccines 90% efficiency), you‚Äôre pretty much ok resume life normal guess 5-6 people gatherings, okay mid-Summer 2021?   would also guess Florida temperate weather whereas get far enough north/east CA gets cold. People FL opportunities spend time things outside year round. get away San Diego/ Los Angeles areas people spending time indoors winter people live with, wearing masks, etc asked question found answer googling oscillating pattern covid deaths something like that. Found peer reviewed paper dont remember where, basically reporting artefacts (eg everyone reports day). Today get infected covid die doctors still clue you, thousands look similar survived.

I hope research goes finding risk factors. Yes vaccines also lower severity it.

Which turn means body fights off, makes weaker, spread much smaller fraction.

So even 60% vaccinated population, you‚Äôre pretty much ok resume life normal know Vaccines usually take develop simply funding, today‚Äôs pandemic, vaccine widely sought, pharma pouring funds expedite creation vaccine.

The difference vaccines one amount funding received expedite it, doesn‚Äôt even contain original virus it, worried about? drug associations already approved human use, really strict guidelines. understand. record, even real possibility S-phase cells infected virus, would still much, much rather vaccine virus, muscle cells arrested G0 Line-1 worry compared live virus infecting many cancer-prone organs, vaccine mRNA stable hours whereas virus goes weeks. Muh freeeeeeeedumbs  understand nurses given vaccine first, classic case survivorship bias. seems made long fine, consider reallocating vaccine vulnerable (elderly people, especially nursing homes).

Havent listened Reddit said? Canada=good, USA=bad. Well 500k/300mil way different 675k/100mil. Also covid affects riskier population Spanish flu (70+ vs 30s under).

Sure discount medical advances people departed planet reality, there's probably magic words bring back. lot people get vaccine things getting better, many people likely glom onto mainstream thinking get vaccine despite crap said. they'll reinvent past say ""I never said THAT, urging everyone cautious 'do research'! welcome helpful!"" vaccine talking here? dozens. virus never eliminated, small enough threat due string immune system, virus curable. see helps society all? point giving vaccines reward good behavior, stop spread virus know history repeat teaching it. rhyme. get stuck black white 'repeating' mindset, missing best part history: come get here?  Hate guy, Santa. Sint Nicholas. Belgium celebrate Sint Nicholas Christmas. jesus fucking goobers intellectually dishonest lmfao White house staffers getting it, yes. waste time trying vaccinate people dont want it? vaccines short shelf life, need stick people want soon clear people risk. Good old kiasu mentality ;) Oh yea definitely. matter cause people die anyway, nuke planet nd get with? fluid situation, timeline given guess. US publishing data?

Where transparency?

And people mention covid-passes: would count() number covid passes.  God hope people get it. 
My understanding need maintain something like 75%+ population vaccinated control thing. 
I'm afraid abnormally high number people get country (the US) conspiracy theories. becomes sort self-fulfilling prophecy vaccine ineffective. that's probably recommendation large convention-type gatherings weddings. small family gatherings long everyone vaccinated relatively safe. concern whether party goers regular contact good candidates vaccine (say caretaker disabled sibling elderly parent). still know vaccines prevent transmission virus others, halt lessen effect symptoms infected. I‚Äôm you. I‚Äôm far anti vax I‚Äôm going wait least year getting COVID vaccine. also live developing country, Coronavirus kill vast majority people general, 3rd world us.


 ridiculous say US much worse example country, argentina, 33k cases per Million compared 50k un us testing less 1/6th per Million US. know probably worse cases wise here. less population deaths per Million pretty close US lot less cases per Million. 

You cant see country without testing... congressman sends weekly email, past two he's devoted section vaccine logistics (when they're specifically delivered many). Republican.

The Moderna vaccine probably easily available due easier transportation requirements. Reddit. Probably actually know can't get virus vaccine. That's actually still studied. possible can, may looking things like briefer window contagiousness, example. maybe longer. short, know interacts much harder study aspect vaccine. Almost major trials start small pilot studies test initial premises feasibility. one wants fund go effort massive trial without primary small studies justification. 

You might never see results small pilot trials meaningless lot ways small reach significance justify publication public scientific community draw conclusions. trials often included grant applications. may show positive trends could indicate significance given proper funding trials. difference midst health crisis threshold publication significantly lower cost/benefit changed related publishing going rigorous trials. Lmao wow Blame pay rent. School speech therapist here! addition seeing students school, also always notified important things happening around school (ex. drill assembly happen). direct supervisor principal - we're supervised people district Special Education department. usually work multiple locations tied school, rather district, we're lucky. also special education co-ops provide IEP services multiple districts. might employee one district work another. work contract company well independent contractor. 

All say tend get forgotten comes important news, doubts would notified one students test positive COVID, even recently seem small group. already suspect close contact 2 students diagnosed COVID, one told sure. Effective wide term here. Covid vaccine prevent transmission, however significantly reduce symptoms. 

So X million people get vaccine increase risk catching disease bad symptoms significantly. Also means cannot receive vaccine health purposes unfortunately long road ahead. 2021 likely child 2019 2020. Somehow bad genes passed child. Several incidents involving Black people medical research United States especially egregious.  And, given long history lied government taken advantage of, hard blame suspicious.  Pfizer producing vaccine three US plants one Belgium European market. Moderna one plant US one main site Switzerland. It'll get around.

People 9/11 made stupid comments returning times catastrophe. Agreed. supposedly evidence least one vaccine trials prevents infection (I think Oxford/AZ vaccine show this). isn‚Äôt clearly shown yet. get downvoted that? Wtf? state plan look it.

The fact similar prevalence adults community suggests overall infection risk similar adults, meaning schools likely least matching workplaces + gyms/restaurants/etc source transmissions. indeed unemployment benefit trying apply week become officially unemployed. exactly works, I'm entirely sure I've moved months corona crisis.

What mean? Yeah, think states state-specific COVID commercials right promote social distancing mask wearing. study released Lancet last week showed transmission occurring school lower community, likely child get virus It‚Äôs find quite funny people much hatred anti vaxxers spreading misinformation vaccines. 

Sure it‚Äôs good others make error (which identified time) dosing none implication safety vaccine make less effective 62% figure (but may higher). You‚Äôd think somehow dosing error invalidated data way people talk it. ""She's great communicator"" would one way phrasing less baggage associated it. surface sounds like lesser compliment, lands sweet spot describing voice speech patterns, conveys information. think that's argument - data actually showing school infection transmission rates lower community #'s. Children mainly getting home asymptomatic - getting school. mean transmitting wherever I‚Äôm excited. still far least making positive steps right direction! told everyone cared listen, lock downs masks ridiculous, unscientific, populism effect.

Really? sound like direct quote least... time made in. clinical trials compressed. There's way know long term effects something existed long period.

Lack caution new technology lost many things like asbestos. testing more? could people getting sick? genius thinking there.

anyway, i'm sure partly preventative. I've noticed LOT belgians around coming shopping evade lockdown, expect germany following strategy want make sure similar influx tourists. Seems reasonable. including children 16 (~ 70M) people say ""definitely probably won't"" take vaccine (20 - 40%, 50M - 100M).

If possible, nearby pharmacy sells KN95 masks, however, chinese GB 2626-2006 standard, CE certification, ""fast-track"", non-CE (EU) 2020/403 standard. OK use? could counterfeit? 

Thanks advance. Let‚Äôs keep mind population US less 1/3rd now, average age death Spanish flu 28, 81. terms deaths per capita, Covid even close Spanish flu.

In terms life lost, instead lives lost, significance isn‚Äôt even close comparable. Yep. Put first vaccine queue... agree. school year absolute waste time. Distance learning absolute joke that‚Äôs parents want schools open soon possible. I‚Äôm fine everyone starting Fall 2021. keep kids safe home buy enough time vaccines administered enough people. year ago, many 500 month. 

Fair enough. still idea whether 1% 200% trying deflect attention away reality article pointing out, 

That people quitting? doubt it.  hard put numbers context. 500 quitting 100 normal would bad. 500 quitting normal 400 would almost ""good news"" given circumstances!

  like approach led less indefensible 

I think terms ""approach"" ""strategy"" etc relevant. Everyone ad-hoc strategy everyone changed it. matters execution, luck. well executed strategy seems work matter is. Meanwhile poorly executed strategy seems almost anything (long extremly restictive lockdowns, high mask use...) still failure. Uneducated fools can't read map think fictional, rest us know exists. They're wrong, though. Oxford given hard time made mistake testing one vital vaccines history communications terrible. They're still saying things like ""It'll probably sorted really soon"" instead ""We completed revised trials 28th December expect government approval 18th January"" whatever case. details communicate, communicate progress. Say ""We recruited 20,000 new volunteers begin inoculating intervention group 18th December"". Nobody wants hear vague statements time. Things serious sounds evasive untrustworthy.

I'm particularly angry mistake. stuff happens. really dealt well communications it. Luckily, comms team developing vaccine that's need remember. Bad comms mean bad vaccine. nope, mixed friend group. ""wait see"" mentality. know, country focus one person often they‚Äôll tokenize minority. It‚Äôs really annoying. odds Asian vaccines used US? volunteer. even boss FHM. Exactly!

More people want leaders field move wherever best opportunity is.

That mean dearly love certain nations. love work more. People said worse Spanish flu, I'm actually concerned we'll get 600K deaths total end next year that, first trials given high risk patients, killed 0.01% people US (299k deaths 16.5 million cases) ""high risk"" group makes almost entirety deaths. they're vaccinated, likely fall non-issue numbers. Pure speculation think take half high risk people take let's say reduces deaths half minimum. need stop. need stop. paper got lot criticism yesterday /covid19. Yup, like said, we'll see plays out. totally may missed news, source claim vaccine mot prevent transmission?

Google Bayanihan Act 1 2. visit DOF's website. many lapses, things, especially came LGU's execution aid, policies there. 

Most economically affected course, terrible purport be. tbh, country covid economically affected? strict guidelines, imagine devastating full effect pandemic 3rd world country ours, lesser resources, fewer hospitals, even fewer medical professionals. know lot medical professionals thankful stuff like strict quarantine imposed, public gatherings severely limited, masks face shields mandatory, online contract tracing launched etc. province successfully flattened curve it. perfect wish shit country like that. That's conservative mindset though. There's research shows conservatives far less empathetic towards others. I've always believed less creative can't put people's positions.

That way protect may adverse reaction.

In meantime, vaccines developed may work them.

There 50 pipeline. Anti vaxxers need locked punished severely. First made pandemic worse, they're making recovery worse. Every news outlet reporting two households/five people limit, without clarifying whether also applies home, official homepage state currently document text law available.

However, since news outlets reporting ""loosening contact restrictions"" Christmas, fair assumption restrictions apply home well, including non-enforcement rule.

That's really try anticipate shipments. know get 1st, enough doses, narrow even Considering even get promised doses December im sure last time. ""The government claims..."" bit ignorant. Idk, would assume vaccine groups representative/randomly selected, I‚Äôd guess maybe least one person worse immune system got vaccine tested. yea agree, 100% needs research anyways feel going something we'll need statisticians really ""see."" December imagine vaccine slowing increase rather prompting real decrease. Funnily enough likely irrefutable impact along lines slowing spread. (Speaking US) something see glossed much. theorized constantly hospitalization/death numbers going mean restrictions relaxed practice exactly metric used large number states. saying sound logic logic many used.

If last summer indication would bet large amount hospitalizations deaths dramatically spring, social end pandemic states. literally check ingredient vaccine believe ingredient list. actually care much, want reason scared.

You question company want cannot question science science laid you. concerned vaccine like concerned food buy local restaurant except probably concerned food give ingredient list usually.

Not sure alternative reasoning looking for. Big pharma made vaccine (vaccines extremely simple) going get paid shit load it. ingredients mRNA based vaccine. mean strategy idea let disease spread herd immunity reached. strategy prevent spread overwhelming healthcare, using means sustainable long vaccine available. think optimistic ones various authorities thought partial immunity (e.g. 20, 30%) would severly restrict spread could maintained vaccine arrived, bet (too much hindsight) that. \*don't\* second think however, anyone Swedish authority ever thought ""let's let 60-70% get it, slowly!"". 

You could call ""herd immunity strategy"" elements allowing level spread. take step back ask, wait \*all\* countries society spread total lockdowns gone, accepting amount spread? make strategies ""herd immunity strategies""? That's I'm confused... know people PhDs work drug discovery believe sending toddlers daycare way keep jobs, even WFH. meant early mid spring, like April March chose herd immunity strategy, let run course, infect many healthy people possible protect risk groups? flatten curve, unlike eradicating virus like NZ did, herd immunity strategy? totally agree herd immunity strategy. like rest Europe. almost feels like form gaslighting, general sense. pfizer vaccine covid Material amounts death reporting document chain government beaucracies work weekends.

If trend reporting need use 7 day average (or least compare like weekdays week week) Ok good luck one court buddy didn‚Äôt say adequate people SF. said opposite actually. think people would favor bigger stimulus, good luck getting Senate third country doesn‚Äôt need much.

Binding reduces chances substantially. Found random guy understand southern New Hampshire within commuting range Boston primary residences. Swedish best, 5/6 majority section issue? still think ¬ß21 justify lockdown - predicated sufficiently serious threat. also makes sense - course constitution prevent emergency measures.

So comes political health-authority evaluation threat. democratic society - suspension fundamental rights considered dire circumstances. saying whether current situation severity, saying *if* FHI political chambers agreement, Sweden could enact lockdown.

And thus justification based politics rational analysis. Tegnell actually done this, I've seen. clearly honestly gives analysis threat level proportional loss freedom inherent lockdown. said interview Danish English-speaking media least, assume done official Swedish capacity. 

But see Swedish politicians pundits discuss this, tendency point constitution, instead take political responsibility, say trust FHI threat dire enough warrant lockdown. true constitution blocks ability enact lockdown - conditional manner, absolute manner. would also crazy. course constitution inflexible.

We similar discussion Denmark regarding bans political demonstrations. Many claim absolute right guaranteed Danish constitution. actually true - law clearly states political demonstrations cancelled threat public safety. used forcibly postpone/relocate anti-Islamic demonstrations, police think possible maintain safety otherwise. could also used limit political demonstration due on-going epidemic. done Covid-19 health authorities think would proportional risk. again, conditional right, absolute right.

I think obvious really - almost every constitution exceptions dire circumstances. think placing political/academic justifications front (as many European constitutions do) better legalistic approach example US - questions settle courtroom. better elected officials best academics make judgments.

And reiterate, saying Swedish authorities wrong analysis proportionality - perfectly legitimate value freedom movement higher threat Covid-19. responsibility must also taken judgements - actually think Tegnell, whatever else may think strategy ideas, done good job of. open good. wish Danish health officials courage say loud principles base decisions on. county jail. clear much possible many people bond possible.

Long answer: risk particular disease medium economic impact low risk humans. Avian Influenza high mortality 60% humans, contagious, transmitted via faecal oral risk human human transmission low. recall less 5 reported cases human human transmission throughout history.

However, poultry affected farms cull, virus known devastate farm stocks.

In addition, keeping track particular disease awhile now, since pandemic potential especially virus becomes airborne. Hence, anti disease measures typically swift drastic reduce opportunities virus acquiring airborne traits. saw study children carried viral load adults ICU. Beer virus?

Realistically, would problem telling people vaccine trials getting real vaccine placebo? mean placebo could effective enough results confused vaccine even know vaccine around 90% efficacy, people give placebos? Studies shown placebos work even people know they're placebos, science really confusing me. infer knowingly taking coronavirus vaccine placebo would help someone someone nothing? I, too, master dice roller. Look roll sixes ten times row. it‚Äôs unlikely could spread it, would follow protocols? Shouldn‚Äôt protocols reduced us vaccine? ‚Äú4-5 weeks month‚Äù Unfortunately help there's structural problem, least current pandemic. Enacting policies right may make people decide enter medical career path, effect really seen decade they've fully graduated specialised (and that's budget reduced years). There's way make qualified medical personnel appear thin air, matter much money throw it. Importing doctors nurses abroad exporting patients treatment abroad really short-term things well qualified inactive (e.g. retired) personnel dried up.

I'd love know reason even though possible develop safe effective vaccine short period time, apparently impossible accepting legal responsibility safety vaccine. add me.

Yea, ‚Äòwe certain‚Äô mentality taken extreme (i.e. acting something likely proven actually false) creating huge issues. example messaging knowing 100% whether infections lead immunity (despite likely observationally quite obvious), it‚Äôs making hard recovered people postpone vaccination, may slow everyone weeks. Sure. like kids. born poverty parents adopt older brother born due lack resources family support years later struggled multiple jobs raise sibling got decent paying jobs. Happily, brother great family love him.

I won‚Äôt struggle raise kids, always afraid next minor catastrophe turns major lack resources. Pretty easy since accidental kids aren‚Äôt possible me. (I wish weren‚Äôt possible anybody). also don‚Äôt care kid I‚Äôm raising genes. 

Ideally, wages social programs country would let anyone/couple kid without strain. isn‚Äôt happening.

If want raise kid either supplemental parent role (the fun aunt/mentor/guardian type babysits free, pays winter clothes, kid school holidays much summer) I‚Äôd parenting partner whose extended family, along mine guarantee contribute time money needed due crisis. multiple parenting partners. 

Or large pile money saved (ha).

Ideally, lower income people would sane stable relationships (or looking relationship) stable jobs hook long term another local couple/people raise kids jointly sharing burden sharing household.

But people messy nuts sexual relationships fuck things often cannot put welfare kid desires that‚Äôs unlikely.

Four adults Walmart pay afford rental house time money commitment kid added daily living expenses. spreads time financial burden raising kid much thinner. One two low income adults can‚Äôt without great difficulty sacrificing things like retirement saving.

If kid sick, someone needs stay home - four people that‚Äôs lot easier cover. parent loses job? Three incomes cover bills get another. Daycare? Might expense depending everyone‚Äôs work hours. There‚Äôs always someone available help homework, listen problems, play kid. hands chores housework. Maybe shared vehicles cutting expenses. Small savings accounts pooled cover emergencies.

I‚Äôd like see socially acceptable legal Co-parenting contract. Adults XYZ Q sign raise kids together, parental rights, contribute x percentage income, reside together within x miles, sort thing. 

But people seem mix sexual poly relationship stuff. Raising kids together nothing sex, entirely separate.

People already multigenerational households- grandparent raising grandkids - that‚Äôs often physical financial detriment grandparent. It‚Äôs better several adults contribute grandma. usually grandma, leads whole rant deadbeat dads bunch issues.

Or three low income adults work one opt SAHP kid school. contract needed though - protect nonworking parent well welfare kid adults break family later. fact people get tested chance Covid means even smaller percentage population Covid, making Covid even smaller issue.


Now, opinion I‚Äôm definitely majority but....:
I‚Äôm precautions like less people store time maintain distance, also think people take bigger responsibility know they‚Äôre vulnerable.

Do remember time restaurant alongside A4 close instantly busy? Guests walking saying busy didn‚Äôt feel comfortable COPD. shocked.

If COPD think it‚Äôs smart go restaurant leave see it‚Äôs busy it‚Äôs fault stupid. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, right?

In meantime, let rest population surely handle Covid go restaurant want, even means keeping distance eachother. numbers rise wouldn‚Äôt matter people won‚Äôt end hospital.

Less people depressed suicidal - including -, less economic damage businesses still income even long-term economic benefit less aging (as rude sounds).

At point, I‚Äôm 100% convinced precautions damage Covid could give. Death part life, viruses come go time point government can‚Äôt protect everyone anymore. We‚Äôve passed point.

So far evidence variants different symptoms mortality rates. appear same. variants appear contagious

Don't know country referring to. I'm UK.

There zero data long term consequences. Mild cases could catostrauphic long term consequences...or none.

 

I plan future based literally data. burn bodies mass graves? bodies going? Florida much closer much culturally similar Canada. lot people also drive Florida too. You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs around .5%. Still 3x people compared back you‚Äôre looking 2 million fatalities maybe collapsed health care system. deliberately tried make confusing? Sounds like he‚Äôs trying make sound worse. stop London throwing tantrum? sorry excuse something personally happen someone basically count. get saying though  Remember shitstain said it'd gone Easter? Pepperidge Farm remembrs. A) dont ignore fact many dont care, let's look facts. ones likely care? ones actively PREVENTING care? general demographic sub? point answering question people likely care people arguing dont waiting go back business usual. I'm realistic may preaching choir, certainly arent missionary either. 

I wasnt talking implenting healthcare reform pandemic. I'm talking pandemic. Time time again, progressive policies advocated government's role substantial healthcare, especially elderly given tend pre-existing conditions average. liberal, leaning progressive sub. Many advocate actively trying put safeguards would prevented place. dont dispute clearly wasnt enough, made accusation OP didnt care I'm arguing seems bad faith since gave reason sad countless deaths.

B) spend billions dollars keep things operating scale keeps status quo. Medicare, Medicaid, VA highly REactive PROactive utilized. SS security one would agree prevented countless deaths elderly helping keep roof peoples heads. none programs operating fullest extent possible inadequate infrastructure unlike many European counterparts. I've experienced VA system. better nothing operating level could be.

What referring widescale government intervention step make choice population handling healthcare day day basis drastically affects ability choose. That's proactive. general, policies like dont get passed, get actively repealed. Sometimes good reason (arguably prohibition) sometimes (arguably war drugs). average american chooses freedom choice actual well being. saying governments current level interest adequate? dont understand: make argument government interested preventable deaths, keeps ""business usual"" stated, people like others sub advocating policies improve status quo ones dont care? seems eyes one enough, isnt. I'm generally curious, else think doing?

Look, I'm trying argue many people dont care enough change. I'm arguing arguing wrong people. still never answered question either, US, state, city level governments implemented shutdowns, think would resulted? People die everyday, pandemics like dont. Moral grandstanding isnt gonna change fact people wished dead, dead. Consider fast able get information date statistics outbreaks now. Even though still contingent people places much, information people take course action. 

Back then, much harder get there, where's bad, isn't, do. either heard paper local events part. One two options really helped spread it.

The thing may saving grace would less travel less global travel sure. I'd bet would right. think phase 2 would rather 90 year old grandmother mid 70s aunt uncle health issues get vaccinated roommates wonder long Tier 3 last time. 150-200 years ahead medicine 1918? we're 102 years ahead. parents 80% friends normally go Florida winter they're staying Canada year, thank god. 

It took waaaaay long convince parents come back Toronto early back March though. genes particular? Also massively undercounting. worst winter go. see progress bar vaccinated people would misleading No, genius, he's complaining military budget (which EXACTLY said still, somehow, get it) which, yes, something left often. Nice try though! Maybe participation trophy coming way. We'll see. flexibility blessing curse single parent. There‚Äôs daycare 1 Saturday. I‚Äôm speaking coworkers, could right too. researchers also pinpointed gene common among people wearing masks holding multi person gatherings : selfish a**hole gene. wonder would save lifes. Lockdowns sugar taxes ban stores sell candy next cash registers Operation Warp Speed.

Letting states control lockdowns masks. way don‚Äôt lengthy court cases federal government unconstitutional actions. Bull. vaccine widely anticipated, heralded, accepted way forward. media intentionally making decisive headlines. Healing 6 months away vast majority us. think propaganda strong word. infection likely give sort immunity science know still needed vaccination vs didn't. thought joke onion young children, meanwhile, also long flown radar, even Berlin virologist Christian Drosten discovered back spring immune SARS-CoV-2 either. tests found viral load throats young children similar age groups. German tabloid Bild blasted findings ""grossly inaccurate,"" appraisal paper reprimanded German Press Council disparagement study. Drosten, turns out, right.

The hatred Bild always there, remember erupting strongly loudly German population then. keep seeing people facebook talking vaccine ‚Äúaborted fetus tissue inside change dna‚Äù bunch people shouting ‚ÄúI get vaccine change dna!!! government wants enslave us!!‚Äù 

do people realize ridiculous sound??? like seriously thought agreed 21st century beyond vaccine conspiracies  horeca part equation. number went stalled, people got lax rose again. See Black Friday, see weekly crowds streets shopping. 

For know without gedeeltelijke lockdown number might continued rising quicker, say help nonsense.  Spanish flu killed like 5.5% worlds population.

We're currently what, 0.01% global population? Fascinating. Thank pointing gross error. thinking 5% sounds like lot, without bothering math myself. deaths also simply contributing factors deaths would otherwise occurred well.

Considering excess deaths year US 100,000 recorded covid deaths, wrong. tad hyperbolic, that's borderline insanity. 

People actually think coronavirus worse 1918... Whatever keeps masks faces guess 's plenty viruses germs around, BULLSHIT even widespread poor world...  OP r/iamverysmart understanding getting 2.9 million first batch negotiated 5.3 million. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs learning it, it‚Äôs living it. 

Until directly affects specific person, typically ignore it. 

My town/county breaking daily records COVID cases, hospitalizations, deaths (some) people starting take seriously. I'm even sure far conspiracy theory rabbit hole fallen know much boyfriend influenced beliefs. I'm certain appealing reason giving rational explainations trying slow spread even work. 
In July, bf seemed believe entire thing elaborate hoax designed impose government control.

 also family members spewed type insanity distanced well. use arguing crazy lol? loved ones dying it, see much changing. even might it, sadly. ""over"" mean? 

Virtually eradicated? Going mask less? Businesses reopening full capacity? stupid. vaccine doesn‚Äôt automatically mean can‚Äôt spread virus - don‚Äôt know not. 

Give people likely die people helping fight virus essential workers.   called religion superstition, parents fervently believe demons evil spirits everything False.

The goal ""achieve herd immunity without overloading healthcare system"". idea spread sickness death longer period time allowing virus ""trickle through"".

Throwing floodgates open never part plan, neither closing completely. Well real need hobby still expected go office work never got idea either ( kids don‚Äôt spread). second winter haven‚Äôt gotten sick I‚Äôm around people small kids going school. walking talking spewing Peter dishes. Little Typhoid Marys. read that? Smoking mutagenic.

And can't change DNA. Rna can't turn back DNA without reverse transcriptase human cells that. even dna outside nucleus rapidly degraded anti viral measure ( dna viruses produce factors inhibit enzymes ).

Tell friend stop smoking gave rush limbaugh lung cancer likely give too. COVID long haulers could identified pretty quickly real virus. vaccines human trials long while. symptoms associated long haulers *waaaay* less common vaccine, don‚Äôt seem last long. Maybe events. Ticketmaster floating something like around little while. 

International travel, would surprised requires card. I'm almost positive will. still many countries receive travelers from, visit. Nine months in. 

I imagine soon enough vaccine cards out, international travel open widely. Why? vaccine prevents getting sick. cure sick. yeah, unfortunately. also bunch frontline workers getting vaccines week. Names mean makes absolutely sense. wear mask sit others room extended period time. anything walking halls streets, transient contact, would better place take mask. Really wear mask crowded public areas people outside household. need annual flu shots flu mutates quickly deal multiple different strains year. Though may need booster shots, far looks like immunity last longer year. matters determining risk. I'm vaccine, first line. waiting see many people reactions hit general population.

&amp;#x200B;

Lots drugs given fast track time ended proven kill people years later would interested seeing many elementary aged kids tested find asymptomatic infection rates Considering latest news surprised goes 4. employer already given info expropriate vaccinated, one answer question yet. 5 hospitals New York vaccine today, start vaccinating tomorrow. vaccination process people outlined yet. qualify early vaccine job, employer probably best source info that. need daily briefings national level, transparency planning. trumped candy shit 45 doing. thought subbing extra money frankly get paid enough me, healthy 20s, feel like worth risk. We'll know 28 days later.  Thats crazy part me. Several people know saying ‚Äúhey wear mask consider distancing.‚Äù December. amazes me. Serious question...why cases Florida lower CA serious lockdowns? Pandemics work raw numbers. one illness kills people another, considered worse. Considering toll overall population interesting, typically considered determining one pandemic worse another. Lives depreciate value population increases. although often talk many differences Netherlands U.S none things really anything reason live U.S. 

My wife American would live moon that's would take. 

Having said would like move circumstances change. One complicating factor parents getting older needing help. studies evidence *for* it?? deeply misinformed breaks heart. get here? culture grew become self-destructive broken? K 3-4 months wishful thinking. Vaccines manufactured massive scale, distributed prioritized, two doses administered, tracking goes that. Unfortunately need certain percentage population take else population whole protected end process. No, said ‚Äûevery European nation stupid, know better‚Äú. Sweden lost much reputation Germany cause this. really disappointed. lie? know... maybe avoid accepting responsibility thousands unnecessary deaths? Nazi zombies

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly. high number asymptomatic cases helps enormously cases require medical treatment (and thus contribute overwhelming healthcare system) likely acquire convalescent immunity. words, asymptomatic case contributes end goal herd immunity. ""high income"" groups gotten it. 


FTFY UK government mismanaged pandemic pretty badly too, general availability vaccine expected take months. elderly care home workers getting first, believe front line medical staff, may well 2021 majority vaccinated. ""America"" ""the fed govt"" something good happens ""Trump"" saying something bad - post Reddit 2020 edition. Brought months back downvoted. Reddit fickle. means over. restrictions. also know long protected. also know possible still get serious infection either trials short sure thing. Hardly divided. vocal minority, best. Herd immunity end. Social end? We‚Äôre losing 3k people per day US! 1/2 america ignorant. yes, regent Street weekend believe! People mostly scared see dozens people personally know take vaccine bad effects think number reconsider Also need account time, data capabilities, defining qualifies death due illness. 

Spanish flu deaths occurred years. perspective time truly able see infection ""waves"". There's general assumption rolling vaccine equates rolling back Covid deaths. (That desire well) 

I know anything regarding data sets died Spanish flue. would surprised if, like Covid, many numbers intentionally (suppressed) unintentionally (overlooked) politicized. Also might likely better means collecting data days.

Lastly defining scope deaths due illnesses proven difficult. Economies effected. Everything civil wars increases drug overdose historically traced similar conditions. rural world we've murders past months we've decades. Why? alles proven! 

Why germany need wait product made german rules germany?  Correct I‚Äôm wrong don‚Äôt unemployment cover basic living needs? so, Many People Die make sure businesses get Enough profit?!! get relief funds relief bill. used funds first relief bill, need call/write senators approve 2nd relief bill. Fascinating! Thank Mexico one biggest vaccination programs world, look us. I'm worried vaccine. Admittedly, little concerned smaller sample size trials these. time became available (no way know exactly I'm guessing somewhere four months year based logistics ungodly-high-risk group), millions received safely, minor concern solve itself. doomed 40% fuck everyone else sheer stupidity. Gg, game rigged plus dumb af. hope right, way cases going right now, latest projections correct, 30%+ United States infected expected EUA application Oxford US.

I'm sure we're going end buying more, sooner, current contracts Pfizer Moderna. again, unless that's available less immediately, going hard stop virus burning population, since hard lockdowns going political non-starter US. problem entire political system giving extra votes empty pieces land it‚Äôs cultivated mentality ‚Äî expensive places country also populous therefore likely millions people forced risky work make rent.

If goal stop spread virus save lives, telling SF residents $1200 could pay rent six months Topeka isn‚Äôt going cut it. would assume 5% people received vaccine became sick anyway clinical trials, 5% spread virus. can‚Äôt spread virus don‚Äôt have. There's preschool street never, ever seen mask walking by. even staff. Like, get hard control 3 year olds adults, really? hate say it, (the US) really need help help others situation. bad place, really need improve tremendously even consider giving aid countries. would normally say that; but, worse shape anyone else moment.  can't compare lives manner unless simply saying life today less valuable life 1918.

Also likely taking IMA account. personal insults though. Work reading comprehension skills. dit jip en janneke taal uitleggen wat hier precies gebeurt. I'm curious know: hospital system backups people fall ill natural side effect vaccine (if one causes flu like side effects)?

Thank take care. Thanks. shut up. one people lead miserable life wish celebrate events like corona 2020 blame crap it. leads restrictions bad life everyone else You‚Äôd think republicans would push vaccine cult. democrats vaccinated republicans not, covid HEAVILY target republicans. They‚Äôre going die mass, maybe that‚Äôs goal? Increase citizen death perpetuate democrat hoax bullshit? 

‚ÄúWe see, called ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô, democrats practically immune covid. think? NEVER VIRUS.

No! they‚Äôre already brainwashed. Wake fight this! Don‚Äôt let America die democracy!‚Äù 

Massive /S that, wasn‚Äôt already obviously satirical. Yes maybe month! 70%+ Republican dumbshits still think voter fraud. really hate people try point life less valuable today then. per capita comparison. 300,000 people die, 300,000 people dead tragedy matter year big population is. Dump would rather get avoid ""helping"" Biden stop pandemic. He's fucking petty. buried far know. Yeah, chances getting killed terrorist attack extremely low well yet 9/11 national celebration actively invading middle east ""stop terrorism"" decade. 

Don't forget couple months ISIS national threat. cool... get saying but, seem fair, it?

Doesn't seem less fair people keep healthy, eat right, exercise, need hospital treatments people eat like shit end medical issues. complain people make worse choices get receive medicine don't. need medicine treatment. Australia need vaccine. like 3-4 ok It‚Äôs like strategy going lead immunity anyway. know exposure doesn‚Äôt grant immunity. knew record. know harder now. Yall guinea pigs test new ""vaccine"" out. MRNA vaccines tested enough research development. There's lot demographics vaccine companies test time. I'll trust immune system injecting something prior COVID, researchers never able correctly synthesize regards mRNA. I'm ""anti-vaxxer"" means. shots up-to-date. like stay informed. Obviously government/media mainly focusses ‚Äúbig‚Äù number infections don‚Äôt mention (or quietly) testing percentage positive tests hasn‚Äôt really changed.

This directly contradicts said. neighbor's 2 children private school, person ""really small class sizes mange social distancing mask wearing"". I'm buying far, ""haven't cases"", call bullshit too. quotes said neighbor. Ironically see different people dropping kids school there's mask wearing driver passengers car. invited come glass wine weekend kids ""are safe"" gets tested weekly goes nursing home facilities--uh ok, people transporting kids, fact family went away last weekend ""school friends""? know hell I'm here? I'm working husband working FIRST RESPONDERS everyday! Although kids online school, know visiting homes? People clue transmission!! work flora Holland, really hope close fully amount revenue lost devastating Christmas time. I‚Äôm it‚Äôs pretty bad. like worst definitely bad. That's pretty shocking statistic, half population either elderly, comorbidity, healthcare worker.  Yet even (originally) cautious &amp; compliant friends family deciding they‚Äôre done. fianc√©e starting get major pushback strict social distancing point pettiness (refusing pick something frivolous us already location ‚Äòit‚Äôs perfectly safe go everyone mask &amp; need stop risk-avoidant‚Äîessentially forcing us make extra trip punished boundaries aren‚Äôt choosing longer). They‚Äôve decided exposure work means might well makes happy &amp; traveling Christmas. make feel guilty judged something, think, continuing stay home. We‚Äôre pretty careful avoid criticizing directly though fianc√©e often reposts news like this. really sucks feel worried subjected passive-aggressive denial.

Infrequent, happen. government cautious, part  Eswatini, officially Kingdom Eswatini, sometimes written English eSwatini, formerly still commonly known English Swaziland, landlocked country Southern Africa. bordered Mozambique northeast South Africa north, west, south. That's kinda odd? Yeah that‚Äôs happens long term affirmative action identity politics. It‚Äôs poison society. I'm normal person, wait maybe April. 

We currently enough doses purchased vaccinate ~1/3rd US population next summer. likely improve vaccines get approved production increases, April may optimistic distribute number doses needed achieve herd immunity. Fingers crossed least get May June. thought somewhere 90 minutes hour half patience fools Succes man Exactly. celebrating someone skin color, that's special treatment. like harder black woman understand science.

So thankful black people medicines save whites well ground air vehicles. fact she‚Äôs African American matter? taking anything away her, feel ethnicity irrelevant quite expected even. Unusually decisive also current government. Lmao know go get thr vaccine...? instance, work essential place, work say ""okay get vaccine go get it"" go try get it? fall different category...? 

I'm understanding going work. Can't anyone say ""im high risk -insert something here-"" places like Walgreens CVS cant day ""prove it."" 

I keep hearing order people get vaccine way know groups regulated notified? Republicans can't take vaccine developed Black they? sort secret oath. afraid follow Germany's example, luckily did. Also quite swift announcement, everything closing today except supermarkets drugstores. 
 
I drove past shops, lines forming soon announcement made. Hopefully make extra cases. We'll probably see overcrowded inner cities within hours. black people invent vaccine black people trust vaccine? studies that? know Finland offered help previously close contact shops closed.

As people waiting houses, lemme tell that's nice dream. 90% people know still gather secretly friends. surprised kinda shitty quality churn out, without strict quality oversight contract. Also, Foxconn Taiwanese company happens use Chinese labor that‚Äôs all. article like pops up, mind immediately goes ""They bring ethnicity science."" yet meet scientist makes decisions based race instead research points to. (Though I'm experienced social studies)

But OP educated newer perspectives. current stance ""I hope actually got permission use race card"". people attack article like pops hope something prepared for. Ah yes, blame hellspawn call children. pressure ICUs rising much. want able care every patient, lockdown necessary. Mine graduated godsend. miss every day. matter compliance since masks part guidelines. People comply guidelines, example, bookings trains, buses airplanes way compared normal Christmas season. Yeah, we're taking generous heaping salt, seems align estimates given commission, e.g. reason keep repeating administer 100k doses/day. DeSantis see Floridians catch COVID suffer. vaccine require 2 doses hit effectiveness would give ONE dose first place. DeSantis charged murder seen Tenet cinema yet? cool. Nolan completely Nolan. individual, placebo effect *might* take place...or might not. take place, telling long last.

Basically effect capricious (as human psyche tends be) make good basis public policy. **""German biotech firm CureVac announced Monday start final phase clinical trials coronavirus vaccine seeking approval regulators.**

The company said 35,000 people would take part tests Europe South America... 


CureVac follows Germany's BioNTech already gained approval United States, Britain Canada vaccine developed US pharma giant Pfizer... 


Both vaccines use new technology based mRNA. process entails injecting short sequence viral genetic material trigger immune response producing proteins acting virus... 
"" surprising? 

We testing positive tests. doesn‚Äôt mean people Covid, KNOW people Covid. Meanwhile, % positive tests stayed pretty much same.

Obviously government/media mainly focusses ‚Äúbig‚Äù number infections don‚Äôt mention (or quietly) testing percentage positive tests hasn‚Äôt really changed. mix together Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccine get super vaccine?

They actually testing blends adenovirus vaccines like AZ/Oxford vaccine. think blend mRNA vaccines kinds. least, molecules degrade different temperatures. Why? Poorer nations economies already border line subsistence living lot downward movement available vs 1st world countries. rocket science

Why? Poorer nations citizens travel rate 1st world countries. Many citizens lucky travel 50 miles away birthplaces lifetime. rocket science shit... wondering long would take started talking race people involved. stupid culture live in. points here: really odd emphasis race US. live mixed race country. one cares skin tone. odd thing concerned about.

It wasn‚Äôt caskets seen coming back Vietnam people actually think reality situation. cause permanent organ damage alarmingly high rate points here: really odd emphasis race US. live mixed race country. one cares skin tone. odd thing concerned about.
 
Moreover think saying black people (how even define one?) would trust vaccines black woman helped developing it, colors racist stupid (which thing). sounds like saying people vaccinate more, basing decision facts science, skin tone one researchers. odd statement me. 

Many people experimented on. quick look wikipedia page subject may reveal this. I'm saying ""so what"", saying unique way emphasize races peoples. ""A white man wins Nobel prize Chemistry. important say he's white WW2 white males used human chemical experiments."" Odd.

To emphasis sound like ""she's black woman still able achieve that"", cringy every time read title. Someone's head got roll phase 3 screw up. Completely unacceptable. US ordered 300 million doses also.

If gets approved Europe, used US well. FDA's strict standards may end costing many lives. Well epidemiologist said spent 15 years Peru ground implementing vaccines said rushing take personally himself.

It's limited supply people desperate take get priority anyways. Thanks man appreciate agree last part folks wanna debate semantics. person lost due illness person lost. They're supposed count much old? That's craziness. like media wants us assume that's case. would pay picture mask on. blame people removing masks ride. ride inherently going cleanest thing world.
Glad Disney ending practice. real? Even extended circle (admittedly mostly like-minded, echo-chamber) friends, I've heard one person voice skepticism. people think miracle they've waiting for, praise Jeebus! 


Is headline? mentality affect masses, actually small group? Patently false. Even Tegnell admitted Tegnell even questions whether stopping progress virus desirable. ‚Äú**We trying slow it**, disease never go away. manage, like South Korea, get rid it, even say count coming back. **Stopping might even negative**, would pent-up possible spread disease, open gates, possibility would even worse outcome.‚Äù immunity could thus also relevant Sweden.  **We bit cautious using word** breathes little given question of, says Anders Tegnell.  **But basic idea probably starting become relevant** see virus, **this need get. control way**.  demands action believes fire allowed burn?  **It's like forest fires things, make burn little slowly carefully, make burn out.**

... Sweden achieve herd immunity, six million inhabitants would affected virus.**  Yes, time must remember vast majority become slightly ill. know big so-called dark number is, lot suggest very, big, says Anders Tegnell.  **Even sounds like lot, may one 60 percent get really sick maybe five six need care. smear five-six percent six-eight-ten-twelve months, manageable March, death toll exploded, Tegnell problem admitting pursuing herd immunity strategy.

The reason denies obviously terribly failed. Doesn‚Äôt try? 

It may already late step forward demand outgoing administration nothing vaccine distribution! Donald Trump fuck since his. Thanks boss appreciate kind words üëçüèª We're entering ""100,000 deaths per month"" phase. We'll half year's over. Holiday gatherings might drive back hopefully virus burned state already. 500 million Oxford vaccine well, 100 million J J.  media wants us doomscroll fearmongered, remember? Yes! Everything aside, really good see terms used appropriately time. OP link addresses question. isn‚Äôt even controversial. make cost-benefit analyses risk kinds things politics daily lives well driving one example.

It became controversial Covid politicized. hope recover quickly! that's sweet take care them, bet they're thankful :) Oh, I've encountered dozens experts Reddit insisted schools open fine, Kids cant spread virus, made fucking sense all. Kids always sick, god people stupid.  Well, assume half people immunity already, half vaccines going people already partial immunity. take marginally less time best. psychological projection makes sense. 

Can explain means? divide. There‚Äôs lot dumbasses say 100m vaccinated, mean 200m shots person getting two doses exactly 21 days apart. It‚Äôs routine news article. you‚Äôve shown, nothing implies ‚Äúalarm.‚Äù Perhaps you‚Äôve read headline actually reflects?

The gist article mutation appears make contagious, scientists believe contributing spike infection numbers. It‚Äôs routine fact, especially context overall article, also indicated. Yes, that's point go back reread comment. scientifically agreed upon percentage ""assumed provide herd immunity"". myth ok. Actually relatively low death rate probably makes worse death rate high higher among young people. ""99% survival rate"" ""it's mostly old people,"" lines may serious logical flaws emotionally compelling. reality there's significant chance kid might die, streets would barren we'd probably kick thing months. key total r value across society, whether 1 1. schools open increases r say, +0.3, due measures total r value still 0.9, new infections per day still decrease. hand, total r value goes 1, say 1.2, months pandemic get control, many places. ‚ù§

The amount books content written year.... paper sure, don‚Äôt see that‚Äôs realistic. 

What stops someone Covid lying saying never did? rate they‚Äôre rolling vaccines don‚Äôt think resources/time antibody check every patient. Also there‚Äôs roughly 190,000,000 haven‚Äôt yet it‚Äôs quite small group ‚Äúprioritize‚Äù. seems like cheapest, easiest way dramatically increase chance surviving virus. 

It also makes quite fearful many friends relatives contract virus summer mild symptoms think going experience illness contract middle January two months Vitamin deficiency.

I wonder mortality rate follows hours sunshine sort lag, maybe month two depending absorption speed? Googling 'vaccine trial' linking something way supports claim helpful.
 
Do actual evidence, *at all*?
 
It's really ok say ""I guessing""
 
There's shame it. Overconfident guessing 99% sub. I'm deep heart antimask Texas, one wants think others first. know personal bias strongly feel we'd make 2% difference people took mandates seriously. even governor does, trickles law enforcement businesses. disheartening feel safe around fellow Texans. Nazis space alien zombies. Trump University Epidemologists published paper topic. Unless parent‚Äôs schedule overlaps perfectly school times, point kids look themselves. unless kids 7 years old, family/friends turn to, parents able manage year two.

We‚Äôre trying improve parenting pandemic, we‚Äôre trying find least awful sacrifices people manage don‚Äôt innocents injured/die them. screw people‚Äôs plans, others. However, can‚Äôt really base policy worst us solely pandemic‚Äôs fault long term issue poverty societal work structure. Even without pandemic, don‚Äôt that. modern medicine like 150-200 years back then... And

Wat?

Medical research got extra years via time travel? miss THAT? Double posting (kind of) got job PCR test lab..... year I‚Äôve done covid disinfection job I‚Äôm going working w test results. Fun Ah see. consensus vaccine protect virus's symptoms, social distancing still practiced precaution people received vaccine yet. think social distancing going continue COVID cases severely died down, hopefully vaccine that. implications new variant?

Is likely contagious less deadly strain? early say? Thanks sharing - surprises me! Looks like paying attention thing works hope reached level herd immunity, however hope lead complacency. don‚Äôt think wrong, think kind exaggerating situation here.
while biggest problem certainly inaction politicians anything (we could least RECOMMENDED masks public transport), Sweden also resisted fairly well side effects pandemic. also spent time European countries pandemic, say still much mental health left compared Southern neighbours. surprises actually encourages bit. Thanks sharing. take time reach herd immunity, vaccine 95% effective. probably we'll start seeing something close normalcy 2023-2024. 2030 think we'll able go socially distanced masked concert. Well given mid-range estimate 50 percent Americans immunity infection already, also fair amount individuals already cross-immune, might take long think reach 60-70 percent herd immunity range. experts saying measures necessary prevent overexposing healthcare system. indicators showing bad trend. Acting necessary, acting later likely catastrophic. number already disturbing - countries taking way seriously act lot earlier (take South Korea Germany example). 

Yet somehow possess true knowledge done 2 months numbers decreasing increasing again. people taken responsibility here. government gave way patient would people.

As someone works public health expert GGD works hospital (and who's Christmas got cancelled work three days Christmas), measures late lot could prevented decisive action taken earlier. mess are.  feel nothing holdout, d00mr? failure imagination cute. We'll lucky somehow avoid Trump 2024. great news, true. I'm going guess love Bills (the poor glutton punishment) Buffalo area. Lots Bills fans lived Rochester, too, usually refer Rochester area ""Upstate"" Buffalo area ""West."" salty healthcare workers, elderly, high-risk individuals receive inoculation do?

Umm, salty much salty hypothesizing might able vaccinate proletariat justified probably matter opinion. Personally, don‚Äôt like it.

Ah.. ok. psychological projection makes sense. Experts currently see reason respond vaccine, either

IIRC one reason used corona's spike target vaccine unlikely lose change mutation. No. individual plots family loved ones direct. course people choose cremation ceremony later. Yeah.. I'm misinformed. last week nurses experiencing allergic reactions ""thoroughly safe"" vaccine beginning. see people browse subreddit scared fear-mongrels. get everyone hiding homes. Especially virus mainly fatal elderly/other health issues low side actually catches it. That's unpopular opinion take is. I'm going Dr Fauci Dr Redfield said general public receiving vaccines late March early April. risk groups healthcare workers vaccinated get better hospitalizations decrease. I'm sorry convinced going get worse worse stay bad long possible true. Vaccinations group beginning speak. Moderna also approved week add vaccinations. stop new normal stuff Ehhh mean don‚Äôt know estimates used hyperbolic honestly. think getting 90% effective vaccine played huge part haha Don‚Äôt listen guy, he‚Äôs posting misinformation. Dead Snow? Awesome film. could pandemic killing 20 million 10 years ago they'd still divided. Take away half population might half intelligent country There‚Äôs difference variant strain. That‚Äôs important distinction.

Maybe young people different standards days there's sorts red flags jumping exchange. 20 24 million pretty good percentage Vitamin deficiency admission hospital associated 3.7-fold increase odds dying COVID-19, according observational study looking back data first wave pandemic.

Nearly 60% patients COVID-19 vitamin deficient upon hospitalization, men advanced stages COVID-19 pneumonia showing greatest deficit. ¬†

Importantly, results independent comorbidities known affected vitamin deficiency, say authors, led Dieter De Smet, MD, AZ Delta General Hospital, Roeselare, Belgium.

""[The findings] highlight need randomized controlled trials specifically targeting vitamin D‚Äìdeficient patients intake, make call general avoidance vitamin deficiency safe inexpensive possible mitigation SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"" say De Smet colleagues article,¬†published¬†online November 25 the¬†American Journal Clinical Pathology.

A search ClinicalTrials.gov¬†reveals¬†there currently close 40 ongoing intervention trials vitamin COVID-19 around world varying purposes, including prevention, varying forms treatment.

Consider Vitamin Prevent COVID-19 Infection

With regard potential role prevention, ""Numerous observational studies shown low vitamin levels major predictor poor COVID outcomes,"" notes Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, internist specializes treating¬†chronic fatigue syndrome¬†and¬†fibromyalgia¬†who also interest COVID-19.

""This study shows severe problem is,"" Teitelbaum told¬†Medscape Medical News. ""A 3.7-fold increase death rate someone's vitamin level 20 [ng/mL] staggering. arguably one important risk factors consider.""

""What clear whether vitamin levels acting acute-phase reactant, dropping infection, larger drops indicating severe disease, whether vitamin deficiency causing worse outcomes,"" added Teitelbaum, director Center Effective CFIDS/Fibromyalgia Therapies, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.

Also asked comment, Andrea Giustina, MD, president European Society Endocrinology, said: ""The paper De Smet et al confirms we¬†already hypothesized¬†in¬†BMJ¬†last March: patients low vitamin levels high risk hospitalization COVID-19 developing severe lethal disease.""

""This likely due loss protective action vitamin immune system SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm.""

He said particularly interesting authors new study reported prevalent vitamin deficiency among men women, likely women often treated vitamin for¬†osteoporosis.

The new study prompt clinicians health authorities seriously consider vitamin supplementation additional tool fight COVID-19, particularly prevention infection high risk COVID-19 hypovitaminosis D, elderly, urged Giustina, San Raffaele Vita-Salute University, Milan, Italy.

Results Adjusted Multiple Confounders

De Smet colleagues looked serum 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D) levels 186 patients hospitalized severe COVID-19 infection function radiologic stage COVID-19 pneumonia well association vitamin status admission COVID-19 mortality.

Cognizant potential confounding multiple factors, adjusted age, sex, known vitamin D‚Äìaffected comorbidities diabetes, chronic lung disease, and¬†coronary artery disease.

Patients hospitalized March 1 April 7, 2020 (the peak first wave pandemic) institution, AZ Delta General Hospital, tertiary network hospital.

The mean age patients 69 years, 41% women, 59% coronary artery disease. Upon admission hospital, median vitamin level 18 ng/mL (women, 20.7 ng/mL; men, 17.6 ng/mL).

A remarkably high percentage (59%, 109/186) patients COVID-19 vitamin deficient (25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL) admitted (47% women 67% men), write authors.

""What surprises me,"" said Teitelbaum, almost 60% ""of patients 25(OH)D 20 ng/mL clinicians consider 50 low.""

All patients chest CT scan determine radiologic stage COVID-19 pneumonia serum vitamin measurement admission. Radiologic stage pneumonia used proxy immunologic phase COVID-19.

Vitamin Deficiency Correlated Worsening Pneumonia

Among men, rates vitamin deficiency increased advancing disease, rates 55% stage 1, 67% stage 2, 74% stage 3 pneumonia.

There therefore ""a clear correlation 25(OH)D level temporal stages of¬†viral pneumonia, particularly male patients,"" write authors.

""Vitamin dampens excessive inflammation,"" said Teitelbaum. ""In patients with¬†acute respiratory distress syndrome, immune system gone wild.""

""The study carried Belgium, there's less sunlight places, even Hawaii, plenty sunshine, vitamin deficiency,"" added.

""More studies needed, think enough data suggest multivitamin used aid prophylaxis, reflected [some] infectious disease recommendations,"" noted.
Source :above article probably much higher, closer 15-20% based 300k deaths 0.5% mortality rate keep sky rocketing next couple months think weren‚Äôt clear sick people might get? wonder people certain comorbidities still get pretty sick. think find sure month two. Maybe two immune response takes get ramped up. played Call Duty since first Modern Warfare, like 15 years ago. past 3 years I've bought 3 games - RDR2, Factorio latest Cyberpunk 2077. honest I'm quite disappointed Cyberpunk. Stupid stupid dies. Okay. Following trends...Apparently US leadership hasnt really got much timing aspect it...So USA - protip - vaccine available, take fucking thing, ok? fact five year processes turned nine month one. idea you‚Äôre saying suggest anaphylactic reaction caused allergy, simply factually incorrect.

There's light end tunnel I'm excited summer 2021. Even things back 100% normal yet work retail, mall, every sunday. Getting tired it. general mindset mall consumer pretend kind conspiracy, wear masks around chin, touch products without buying anything? Good idea planning Christmas July. Turn cancelled event delay instead. Contractor here. work hours clients facility many employees.

They planning offering free Covid test every employee week. saw boxed earlier. There‚Äôs enough every employee, individual bag name ready go health tech contractor hired make happen.

None guys. fact don‚Äôt actually want test every employee regularly facility says lot. don‚Äôt care, optics stunt. Record daily deaths perhaps??? ü§îü§î  Marshall's Holy Shit Gates Nostradamus Right?? I‚Äôm honestly kind looking forward it. divorced parents there‚Äôs inlaws, 3 different families see Christmas. Someone invariably gets feelings hurt feel like don‚Äôt get much time us, we‚Äôre super stressed trying make everyone happy. I‚Äôve honestly always wanted Christmas relax home. Overall pandemic sucks donkey balls obviously, missing ‚ÄúChristmas‚Äù isn‚Äôt worst thing ever me. cannot offer investment advice, suggest research. Sweden strategy?

I'm done talking wall listen though. Sad they've done think little recognition service much ask. Yeah, America people attempted kidnap murder governor suggesting wear mask. tried that‚Äôd end federal government. took state capital building.

Im praying vaccine doesnt fucking illicit sepsis reaction - cytokine storm that.

Mathematically need 70%. 15% anything...    Exactly. US tests far Sweden

[Ehh, depends timeline EMA? They‚Äôll gone literally like week two getting second dose too. Obviously exception permanent crew like custodians kitchen staff. great numbers they're not. necessarily true 5% people could still transmit covid yet confirmed astrazenica study contracted covid viral loads via nasal swab significantly lower point good reason doubt people could transmit covid.

Also even 95 percent basically mean resume normal life, moves risk contracting passing covid within acceptance levels, far reasonable precautions take seem lower chances infection anything close that. Continuing attempt reduce 5% chance develop immunity seems unnecessary. Well, they're going wait. Nobody going give vaccine months, going old people, medical workers, on.

3 4 months now, finally turn 250 million people already vaccinated worldwide, decide waited long enough. make killing pawn shop. believe killed people, swine flu vaccine 1976 ended causing neurological damage number recipients; generally accepted fast-tracked vaccine caused damage flu time. even 95%, still shed virus. able resume normal life even got vaccination today. indicators pandemic officially things go back normal? got vaccines going keep hearing articles social distancing measures may continue least 2022.

Spanish Flu fucking terrible, would hope 100 years later could higher standards constitutes emergency.


I'm sure agree, thought said loud. body lot complicated think. saying small minority people vaccinated, everyone allowed travel. Get fucked, stay US everyones vaccinated. catch cat? think understand means. 

It fact certain cultures live intergenerationally often others. Like Italians Mexicans.  Usually, that's great. Right now, great. 

Cultures different. ok acknowledge that. It‚Äôs also hispanic parts OC like Santa Ana Anaheim way worse Irvine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lol exactly.  Thanks confused thought saying can't carrier vaccinated depends.. winds soft reaction expected come trials, could lead vaccine altered removed market. reactions months, comfortable taking Welp. Sorry that. One perk still working home, apart lowering risk transmit/catch covid right kind stuffs clock ha ha.

I 3 hours overtime today forgive one. Chiropractor here...we actually business classes went. whispers/demand wanting business taught years. business degree (and half chem degree) didn‚Äôt want pay business classes chiro university. 

I wanted butt-in (hope don‚Äôt mind) bc think really hit nail head. that, think it‚Äôs obvious decades probably whole n√©e generation MDs coming knowing difference. 
Medical doctors essentially decided ok cogs machine means less stress running office. sounds great ‚Äújust see patients get paid salary society sees high (although I‚Äôd argue pay MDs going relative workload/stress handle.) Honestly, idk guys it. last 3 PCPs I‚Äôve (moved once, switched docs once) 3 IMO seeing waaay many patients short periods time doubt pressured hospital group. seemed stressed across board. 
Beyond simply agreeing, wanted point think sell soul corporate extent it‚Äôs simply worth it. 
One thing really like chiropractic (as well dentistry, physical therapy, optometry) kind last Cowboys sense. Many (but less year [similar paths coming]) us facilities aren‚Äôt beholden corporate overload. 
To PRICELESS. Despite labeling essential closed practice 2 months one point, sacrifice probably $45-$60,000 income. Why? wanted to, savings, felt right. numerous calls from: firefighters, nurses, EMT, prison guard patients, former addicts (who initially became addicts prescribed hard pain meds simple mechanical back pain)...AND acquiring PPE developing protocol. re-opened. 

There‚Äôs also sense community comes self-ownership. friend (local physical therapist) close non-PT employee tested positive...I offered able see patients office test negative. discussed thorough protocols testing staffs. (Fingers crossed) haven‚Äôt single issue office yet. But, really made feel good said ‚Äúsame you, use space anytime.‚Äù feel dentists locally PPE ventilation dentistry (constant aerosolization saliva) constant issue would think. 

I love owning practice. don‚Äôt live shades grey. possibly wrong thing patient MONEY. charge practice, one else. MDs positive impact society overall. But, CEO says ‚Äúno drive-thru/tent, covid testing in-office pays more‚Äù...they tolerate that?!

That set stresses pro/con. But, like wouldn‚Äôt way. makes sad MDs run practices now. saddens see stressed. I‚Äôd like see set hours, protocols, scares seem insinuate hospital groups permeating medical schools. 
I‚Äôve also heard much borderline unethical/illegal stuff big groups. ‚ÄúWell, won‚Äôt surgery unless schedule PT there.‚Äù whenever bloodwork ordered it‚Äôs always steered labs ‚Äúfor convenience‚Äù, even patient would prefer another lab, closer house etc. 

I swear could go back way. One thing manage heck office. I‚Äôd say chiropractic success moreso measure ability run small-medium healthcare facility diagnosis adjusting skills. 

My best friend runs/manages 13 urgent cares large group. talk stuff time. Perhaps, start consulting business getting recent graduates running practices. posts mention profits prioritizes safety what‚Äôs best patient...I hate hear it‚Äôs surprising. 

In closing, MD/DOs, business end going ran either way. Run employee. choice that, choice. really wish MD/DO would break current (very) flawed system. think waaaaay power realize. 

Sorry unwanted rant thread guys...I guess felt need vent. Thanks do, idk it. hope burn-out never occurs hope corporates listen reason more.

edit: wow long, screw im leaving EMA insists granting full use vaccine, rather emergency use authorization full use authorization follow Spring. result four-week delay result thousands extra deaths lockdown fatigue. Who's listening moron? 

Where obtain medical degree? They‚Äôre full shit. 99.99% vaccines prevent transmission. hasn‚Äôt confirmed new vaccine yet give us reason suspect won‚Äôt prevent transmission. I‚Äôm guessing weather related...looks like virus survives longer cold dry air. actually see someone would prefer US Greece, Japan, Korea, UK, countries.

Asian countries pretty toxic work culture. Even get nicer things like better government assistance, healthcare, etc... Asian countries kinda want work death.

And people UK *almost* crazy America, really trading much there.

Every country problems. really much better America. But, things, answer question also really depends social hierarchy.

Being poor America bad. Period.
If money, would better multitude countries better social structures. blame whole administration, remember 70 million Americans dumb dumber. blame individual denies science wear fucking mask. administration direct reflection poor mental state nation. agree Belgium disaster country, plays role, also clear they're reporting *all* excess deaths, many countries aren't. (Scroll ""Weekly death rates, western southern Europe"" click little immunity chicken pox despite really bad like 5. government gives green light companies cannot sued brought due unforeseen complications resulting said vaccine; that's problem. little research can.

Yes I‚Äôm sure people covid spread I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs wrong assume vaccinated people don‚Äôt get infected spread it

5% best we‚Äôre getting need deal it. definitely don‚Äôt want lie either lol. I‚Äôm saying stop making best vaccine we‚Äôre getting sound bad genetically confirmed second infections I've read genetically confirmed reinfections. 10 severe, 5 less severe, 8 severity. likely severely immunocompromised

Fun fact. immunocompromised generally better virus. HIV agammaglobulinemia tend less severe disease. Basically past vaccines made using inactive version virus vaccine made fight against. vaccine doesn‚Äôt use inactive form COVID, instead uses mRNA (messenger RNA tl;dr like genetic instruction manual) introduced body, immune system say ‚Äúhey! doesn‚Äôt belong here!‚Äù build immune response fight it. mRNA degrades pretty quickly, even building adequate response, folks need two doses 3 weeks apart.

It‚Äôs perfectly safe mRNAs function provide instructions. won‚Äôt hijack body. proteins produced body, stop immune system tells to. mRNA die off. pendant already late contact trace. long becomes overwhelming Sure, even that's tricky, especially smaller states. Let's say Rhode Island 10 vaccine ""stations"". 2000. Assuming we're working 24 hours day, means one able process ~1.4 people per minute. That's...a lot. I'm sure pipeline stuff, would still imagine all-in time person least 10 minutes (that's takes get flu shot paper work actual injection). non-trivial.

Unless get kind mark can't forged, like barcode QR code (religious nightmare), there's way differentiate gotten vaccine hasn't. i.e. probably case numbers drop, everyone keep procedures simplicity unless there's way ID people vaccine. 
2. unknown think. guess would a.If vaccine lessens effects, yes. b.If stops transmission, it'll probably take couple days/weeks. thing is, think anyone knows long it'll take reach point. pt 2: see above; there's way verify. Otherwise bunch entitled people lying vaccine. 
3. think vaccines always 100%, least reduce effects illness target. Sometimes, bodies produce antibodies enough still get mildly sick. reword someone zero knowledge biology chemistry? used common sense gone.

Congrats Australians. consequences selfish assholes.

Maybe watching innocent car accident victims, stroke victims, people need immediate medical attention suffer die hospitals full finally make utter losers realize foolish are. confirmed reinfections known clinical outcomes, 10 severe, 5 less severe, 8 same. Never. often think Ypsilanti Pooper. current evidence, scientists believe persons mild moderate COVID-19 may shed replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 10 days following symptom onset, small fraction persons severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised persons, may shed replication-competent virus 20 someone infectious? people getting infected people everywhere going die, doesnt mean young people dying would overload hospitals

I said hyperbolically, like I‚Äôm saying primary people dying old

We‚Äôre going 100 million people vaccinated March? playing here. knowledgeable head warp speed, made statement?

My timeline stayed consistent, made up. Put simply: problem? job profitable retain good employees right?

Don't get wrong businesses dont oppose stimulus, oppose basic income, they'd get check too.


But right sole concern keeping lights on, concerns secondary. may like mindset is. Wait, one key scientists NIH side, actually wasn‚Äôt involved Moderna, correct? article makes sound like one lead scientists actually invented created vaccine, accurate say one key scientists NIH helped pave way Moderna get accepted? probably both. seen coherent plan yet produce vaccine get distributed quickly enough. see big deal. CVS alone like 20 million flu shots year. Every CVS, Walgreens, Costco, Doc box someone give vaccine. need get supply. think black person articulate unusual, real racist. Dad, please. *embarrassing*. think public health measures need stay place vaccine available everyone. 

I agree. Lots people think hoax still Exactly.... 

They don‚Äôt care public anyway Pfizer ran trials nontrivial. want see fucked trial looks like see AZ/Oxford. Oxford CLEARLY picked wrong pharma partner. Even Dems win Georgia?    ""Which produces stronger immune response: natural infection vaccine?

Solids seem less blended water. Speak yourself. We've told governor fuck several times already. refused wear masks blame others numbers rise.

Absolutely idiotic people going spread chance GET vaccine. know cdcs projected baseline deaths 2020 lower 2019 totals? 2019 already low mortality year. could be? curious bottlenecks beyond distribution. Let's say actually ship many quickly. Let's assume immediately administered.

Has info released quickly usa get vials injected? supply issue, many could injected daily? bottleneck? need enough nurses focused months end - spoilage, watch side effects, etc.

Otherwise, could quickly situation vaccines shipped weekly administered. Usually metrics Nordics nearly lockstep infrastructure, health, welfare, wealth, demographics living standards. statement substantively different flat inaccuracy. Sweden‚Äôs different Covid results direct consequence public health policy differences. BTW economy similarly affected Nordic neighbors. difference death toll.

This week break records deaths. 

Yes outliers trend I've seen entire time. Like quotes example? Spain, opening schools, small studies claiming kids less chance get it, get sick spread much adults. Everything gut tells can't possibly right, read studies immunologist. disappointed Moderna Pfizer, didn‚Äôt check asymptomatic infections. 

There‚Äôs safety issues AZ work, see trial portrayed media people don‚Äôt confidence. action taken FHM pointed directly ""herd immunity"" strategy.

Nope, false.  still going get sick, vaccination going mitigate symptoms. know spread virus vaccine. However, would seem many people spreading virus asymptomatic is... People likely getting tested point, data underestimating reality situation. long supposedly enriching history people basically idolize it, quick many Americans conveniently forget convenient parts. Low vaccine trust among Americans. less people line get vaccine LUL. /s

but real, can't take vaccine indirectly risk: elderly, compromised immune systems, babies, worse imo, people/kids cant get friends/parents told / allowed/ misinformed.. say stuff like ""no evidence masks"" December that's ignorant. scientist, miss one year developments. know wrong.

But keep saying it. IMO, we're likely see dent lock measures put place across country. Yeah, richies support first, poors afterwards.

It's even universally conscious either- neoliberal hypercapitism's final form. system's job provide mechanisms decouple richies/fancy-lads moral culpability would otherwise accompany advantages. 

Wealth inherently insulatory, ""membrane"" class (professional/admin/political etc class) develops maintains *disassociative structures* ultimately morally launder profits moving towards top. *is* evidence. thought could read draw conclusions, apparently asking much.

So, spell anyone poor reading comprehension: summary clinical trial vaccine question. give stats long term effects like fatigue.

Compare prevalence long term fatigue COVID. whopping 52% recovered COVID patients report long term fatigue: results clinical trial (which previously linked) show fatigue less 4%. could go on, I‚Äôm tired research someone rude lazy.

I‚Äôve blocked you, won‚Äôt see idiocy.  I, too, make numbers support teenage opinions. Deaths tally ledger. Different deaths different times different people different significance community individual.

This never controversial Covid politicized. saw bumper sticker car yesterday saying (person‚Äôs name) killed drunk driver 13. relevant 13? think deep heart, know, cynicism snuck people‚Äôs hearts hardened hearts along pandemic, pretend understand supports ideology.

Public health care systems set prioritize direction limited resources towards end lengthening amount quality time alive. Everybody wants that.

It politicization Covid people changed this. don‚Äôt need stretch conception here. mortality rate Spanish flu per capita basis greater COVID 19. want add color, killed much younger cohort years life basis, substantially larger impact. first point sufficient justify Spanish Flu worse though. Sure whole quote says could sooner too, interviews said april-july timeframe reasonable. 

Quote article:

""I think that's quite reasonable,"" Fauci said. ""If deploy vaccine implement public-health measures, think might even sooner that. 2022, think, pretty good bet."" feel depends live state. I'm also WI would say near 100% mask usage stores go to. places mask usage poor restaurants. personally dine-in, pick food I'd say majority customers regardless eating not, wearing masks surprisingly staff either time.

I've mainly noticed rural areas worse it. went north couple months ago could literally see mask usage getting less less stops made travelling north. last gas station got quite remote, customer came wearing mask, asked maskless cashier needed wear one said ""I'd rather pay fine wear mask"" ripped agreed. 

Guess showing 'the man' tough are. bad ones end killing elderly health compromised friends family. Top 1% almost certainly got already. Money power everything Fauci expects widespread vaccine April. It‚Äôs old article dude, things change. That‚Äôs thought too. David Pakman, show, referred 95% efficacy meaning 19 20 exposure virus protected individual. don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs 6 weeks, closer 3-4 weeks. That‚Äôs current spike began early October deaths didn‚Äôt start rise 24th. I'm sure answered can't find it. someone know get shot? call doctors office ask? According rollout I'd phase 2 since I'm teacher heart problems. We're targeting ""at risk"" infection/ mortality. We're actually targeting ""vector"" population would active social young spread minimally symptomatic go bars restaurants work...


So spread may actually slow while, see drop hospitalization death. 


This premise vaccinating ""vectors"" briefly entertained thought unethical vaccinate young healthy irresponsible people 'at risk' even though paper vaccinating likely spread may actually end pandemic faster.

So... basically yes, lol. agree you. AZ population around 7.3 million. number absolutely insane 95% effective number reflect effectiveness individual taker effectiveness let‚Äôs say 80% people get vaccinated? bunch well known people public spotlight take vaccine early would help dissuade many fears reservations people 

You're right, think celeb vaccine movement happen early next year doctors nurses already supply replenishes. 

Expect see Taylor Swift etc news getting vaccine february (hopefully). highest risk health workers, need implement lottery system birthdays give vaccines comes draw 365 days.  use mRNA vs modified viral particles new rest ingredients make vaccine based pharmaceutical knowledge vaccines medicines Unemployment due businesses closing require people live savings retirement mismanaging money?

I smell sanctimony. Well, nurses quitting U.S. too? What's difference exactly? think matters sort economy have. people work nurse likely quit global ass pandemic starts pose risk themselves. countries. Sweden much larger safety net. also possible... Roughly 2.8 million Americans died cause 2018.
Roughly 2.9 million Americans died cause 2019.

Roughly 2.8 million Americans projected die cause 2020.

This figure expected remain largely without significant increase. understand whart people worried about.

Do research! trust mainstream media! I'm talking bosses small business owners freedom decide workers get benefits kind. meant fair stacked favor bosses. gift guys. keep em. Wait automod deletes ‚Äúd00mer‚Äù :'( vaccine rushed? I've extremely pro-vax, I'm concerned AZ-Oxford vaccine. Pfizer Moderna trials well designed, simple trials. Large sample size, randomized (but well-matched cohorts), well defined primary outcome. vaccines very, similar, two large trials essentially identical results essentially doubles confidence vaccine. getting Pfizer vaccine, hopefully soon (healthcare worker).

The AZ-oxford studies, hand, mess. One UK arms capped age 55 (which happened highest efficiency), dosing error, they're publishing combined trial. degree heterogeneity within combined trials, use post-hoc subgroup analyses major red flag. Maybe treat Brazil trial worse case scenario (30-80% effective 95% CI), still feels post-hoc. get reasonable amount safety data trial, great efficacy data (and also branch looked asymptomatic infection). want approved US, large prospective, randomized trial.

This disappointing AZ-Oxford vaccine potential cheap, effective, cold chain issues. are, expediently approve vaccine work safety issues could significantly undermine vaccine confidence future, tragic good vaccines, including COVID19. Exactly! ocean wide difference antii-vaxxer conspiratoid folk suspicious anything pfizer makes. answer reveals attitude. Saying ""yes"" obligate get vaccine if, availability opinion changes.

But saying ""no"" definitely shows got mental issues already committed despite evidence may show future. techniques find causality besides randomized controlled trial though. Yes, gold standard, public policy almost never able achieve that. Difference difference technique seems applicable here. Look Personally, I'm authoritarianism, regardless conservative side liberal side.

The correct answer properly funded education unified message leadership. think evidence assume vaccination prevents spreading virus. Yeah agree - one niggling things see, really correct people know want say. like read people writing ""your"" instead ""you're"". Still isn't, never was. 

It always was. Even Tegnell admitted Sweden achieve herd immunity, six million inhabitants would affected virus.  Yes, time must remember vast majority become slightly ill. know big so-called dark number is, lot suggest very, big, says Anders Tegnell.  Even sounds like lot, may one 60 percent get really sick maybe five six need care. **If smear five-six percent six-eight-ten-twelve months**, manageable Tegnell even questions whether stopping progress virus desirable. ‚Äú**We trying slow it**, disease never go away. manage, like South Korea, get rid it, even say count coming back. **Stopping might even negative**, would pent-up possible spread disease, open gates, possibility would even worse outcome.‚Äù favorite part assumption Bill Gates access total science fiction technology / magic.

A microchip, power source, antenna etc. function indefinitely inside bloodstream, without ever detected millions/billions people, also fit inside hypodermic needle? think people still getting tested Florida? 

Nvm that, think Gov. Death Santa actually allowing real reports covid numbers sent he's simultaneously opening state more?

C'mon now... real risks reinfections beyond .001% chance? entire family got due exposures working either healthcare high risk jobs, thinking meeting Christmas since COVID risk seems moot. healthcare providers reassuring reinfection super rare, would appreciate unbiased perspective. Yeah he‚Äôs saying April-July see ‚Äúrelative normal‚Äù shit bc vaccines ended fire

That‚Äôs September article think vaccine news vaccine, developed Pfizer Inc German partner BioNTech SE, emergency use authorization federal regulators Friday found 95% effective preventing illness large clinical trial.

Healthcare workers seen detrimental side effects lot vaccines. They're obviously antivaxx know risk vs benefit. I'm sure many level headed people want see proper long term studies taking new vaccine, especially make sign non disclosure agreement beforehand. joke, actually going trial mixes doses different vaccines new year. Including Oxford sputnik. blame people voted politicians in. messed like 2 party US people every opportunity vote SD V instead M/C/L/KD/S.

There‚Äôs going interesting studies written graduate students psychology programs mess. luck, lockdown 2023!!!!!! /s google image search ""covid icu"" real king shit right Literally everyone sub team Astrazeneca months ago. vaccine cheaper, easier produce, easier distribute appeared fastest testing. made perfect sense give largest order. gene therapy - using something like CRISPR ability ""target"" specific areas DNA cut out/edit them. imagine target HIV genome (which integrated DNA infected) - could, theory, cut - specifically - leaving rest DNA untouched. would leave template virus replicate genome anymore, effectively cure virus.

The issue is, technologies infancy. We're getting understanding use effectively, limit off-target hits. also 100% success rate, would need actually cure someone entirely - otherwise cells missed would re-infect others.

But getting there. also want note - technology made possible ""basic research"" ""obvious"" direct technology mind discovered. Make sure support, tell elected officials, support basic research funding find technologies promising! Source needed.

Also, what's point?

Also, know long term consequences mild infections. Could latent phase know about. start preventing infections 5 days, expect obvious, visible impact U.S. state case charts January February. expect effect death numbers noticeable around time, dramatic able vaccinate good portion elderly population. Mid Q2 anyone wants vaccine (in US) it.

Pretty amazing, differences, good way. like politicians accountability weasel way it, continue pretend exist. don‚Äôt see point. I‚Äôm denying there‚Äôs increase cases. saying don‚Äôt need overreact. 

OP stated multiple times we‚Äôve doubled cases, haven‚Äôt. Firstly literally haven‚Äôt even doubled, secondly he‚Äôs looking absolute numbers, relative numbers.

Aside still don‚Äôt think lockdown way go little increase we‚Äôve seen lately. also multiple friends work hospitals - including Covid departments - obviously say it‚Äôs busy, it‚Äôs still manageable.

In opinion people take responsibility government should‚Äôve increased capacity start. feel like you‚Äôre vulnerable, stay home vaccines let people willing ‚Äútake risk‚Äù, take risk. They‚Äôll fine.

Experts warned years ago government kept decreasing capacity we‚Äôre supposed see heroes throwing us lockdown?

If shoot leg provide first aid shouldn‚Äôt praise possibly saving life.

Now obviously nurses overwork always sucks unheard of. isn‚Äôt first time happening doesn‚Äôt justify measures. people still hanging - it‚Äôs winter break, lots folks work too. near LA? original statement correct? potential maskless-vaccinated spread virus unvaccinated Read article: vulnerable groups named Canada's first phase.

They talking second phase (spring, hopefully) health care workers, LTC homes, indigenous communities elderly vaccinated. Evidence decreased case loads hospitalizations isn‚Äôt good metric necessarily. 

Both metrics drop cliff next two months. There‚Äôs 3m people vaccinated first wave. We‚Äôve lost ~300k virus. that‚Äôs case, target right groups, see deaths hospitalizations cut least half really quickly. Listen, terrible see this. But, adults USA blame. College kids college kids do. President taken seriously whole time, here. Nope. Poorly mitigated spread contributor, tho. It‚Äôs RNA virus; [it‚Äôs gonna mutate passes person person, people like gonna pandemic ends? you‚Äôll way spread doom Eh, humans virus? ... Damnit Agent Smith!!! Hope pull fine. Great look them.

- ""But... That's murder!""          
- ""That's murder.""       
- ""Why not?""      
- ""Because said want kill victim. said it. kill victim, murder.""        
- ""Still, looks pretty much guilty. hated victim, alibi, DNA crime scene witnesses saw smoking gun victim's blood him.""       
- ""That's proof! say killed victim? didn't. proof killed victim.""     
- ""What phone call? Right murder, said ""I'm going kill him, that's easiest solution.""

That would funny tragic. US 3x bigger now. you‚Äôd need 1.8 million worse. worse 1918. lockdowns? vaccine tested long enough see certain long term effects. tests see vaccine affect fertility, instance. inherent dangers rushed drug pushed hated told truth Link working me..anyone want paste article? true full count Spanish flu analyzed tallied. Rona take years us figure many actual deaths occurred. feelings  That's pretty decent rate twins FINALLY learned cover mouths cough. they'd tilt heads upwards cough germs like fucking geyser. Like guy above, single sickness household since started. fucking glorious cause twins habit throwing get post nasal drip. someone‚Äôs paying post reddit get money back. dumb think saying word science means anything.

Most increases overall life expectancy come first fixing childhood mortality quite high, later extending amount time able keep seniors alive debilitating diseases.

This article (written pre-Covid times relevant ever) written Biden‚Äôs new Covid advisor, doctor bioethicist, Yeah, obviously little bit preliminary since virus around long enough sure - think they're basically pro-rating immunity rates people caught early. 7-8 months almost nobody catching again, pretty sure average way beyond year. New normal crew bit days, hoping manufacturing delay vaccines months. I'm suggesting would need justify choices. I'm suggesting alone responsible them. coronavirus fault, government fault, yours. people hear kills black brown people often kills disabled/obese/diabetes often too. wouldn‚Äôt shocked think it‚Äôs little bit hate genocide work tbh. People need aware chance, every slim, new variant vac resistant deadly. well possibility anti bodies built fighting first time might effective new strain. Chiming also confirm, New England native, NE widely used refer it. personally effected covid. say they're lying. Tegnell can't get big head ass. We‚Äôre gonna break record baby agree 100%. totally wrong philosophy there's something wrong elites get vaccinated first.

A hundred thousand elites getting ahead everyone else make everyone else jealous want get vaccinated ASAP. Many lives saved. really interesting question. would guess lockdowns isolating cases/contacts cases would put evolutionary pressure virus would favour asymptomatic cases longer incubation periods. I'm qualified virus science though probably listen me. US, vaccine free, providers allowed charge fee administering it. insurance, zero copay-- like flu shot. 

Most ordinary people US get vaccine CVS Walgreens. national chains, out-of-state insurance problem. 

BUT, concerns, ask insurance company details. eager help; make profits everyone gets vaccinated stays hospital. know, many idiots anyway. working cooking home spouse, retired parents. prepared P100s N95 stock since N.Korea acting up. I'm favor letting sort out. Everything's open. masks required. fun. I'm already enjoying depressed real estate market. evictions come great buying opportunity. There‚Äôs plenty science explains documents dangers consequences rushed tested vaccine. new variant created people taking follow vaccine shot gonna doozy definitely worth it.   Scientists, Doctors, Medical professionals overhwelming favor taking vaccine. hasnt ever time probably outside polio scientific community ever unified working solve problem, biggest problem lifetime this.

Seriously? first dose administered [New York live parents even know this, watched live Fox News. mean asshole, little discouraging Fox News viewers informed lot people sub.

The current plan vaccinate frontline workers, risk, general public last. Seems like pretty good plan, especially considering 100 million doses going moment, another 100 million approved start distributed next week. ""MICHAEL!"" Idk I‚Äôd argue earmarking like dozen vaccines high profile highly influential folks would save thousands lives driving rates

Imagine broadcasted vaccination Lebron James, Kim K, President Obama, probably handful people don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm old

In scheme things 10 doses probably worth heard dog take shit, what‚Äôs point say vaccines also reduce severity it? Yeah, parents going snowbird year. trust Governor DeathSentence. Thank link; stand corrected. 

For benefit wishing read it, article states ""top"" Washington DC officials across three branches government likely vaccinated week part ""continuity government"" protocol, purpose ensure government leaders able keep government going times crisis. article also says early inoculations prevent spread infection among White House staff. article mention state local politicians. 

Whether justified probably matter opinion. Personally, like it. think important note countries reporting new variants months now

Yep. ‚ÄúBeing obese increases risk infection complications single obese person, recent evidence indicates large obese population increases chance appearance virulent viral strain, prolongs virus shedding throughout total population eventually may increase overall mortality rate influenza pandemic. ‚Äú

No, respect others personal safety, it‚Äôs right thing do. ask question lot nowadays. parents live Singapore live Texas, USA differences two places terms COVID-19 striking like unbelievable problem. Dang covid infiltrated family, dad tested positive suspect whole household caught now. Smh fucking stressful man

I‚Äôm done it, caught October back college, thankfully take care Read said again. I'm pulling ""most people died middle age"" argument, nothing post hinted that.

Yes, people reached old age back then. many people lived *really* old, ones make 80 90 likely people without major health problems (like diabetes).

Modern medicine good getting people imperfect health live 10 years longer would done past, that's group covid really takes toll on.  really, plenty movement war, bit slower damage spread 2 years. reached remote parts alaska Took us 3 years trying get pregnant first time. Took 1 month second time. Plus we're getting younger actually safety margin age trying kids. 

Not justify choices anyone else, go anyways. divided. reason people pay attention vocal minority believe majority. People literally denying Covid real dying it. ‚ÄúMost people take vaccine‚Äù one uniformed, naive takes ever. enormous portion country going take vaccine. obvious anyone even ounce common sense. #1 nearly enough vaccines available actually warrant lax cautious, however I'm sure matter since tons places basically zero restrictions anyways Cases stalling we're running supplies. Barely anyone vaccine yet. vaccine make remarkable change April. Therapeutic treatments could improve 100% survival hospitals full (as many are), matter. immune system nothing compared COVID kinda crazy think even 200 years ago people could die one clue happened. mean still happens today seems rare. Long gone days parents would 10+ kids half would die 5. trials?

  

This fun everything, responses literally indistinguishable ""I heard guy say once"" extremely difficult take seriously. Well, phenomenon exactly myth vampires started Middle Ages I'm mistaken. favorite idiotic talking point whole thing. 

We're 2020, almost everyone smart phones spewing location data everywhere folks tag social media locations time.

Why unemployment matter workers paid stay home? changed generating surplus value ""small business fucking stupid. Capitalism economic system, reality, live under. game opt Jesus Christ.

Capitalism means production controlled capital, people get surplus value production. people called capitalists. (the petit bourgeoisie merchant class gone try tell business owners lol) perhaps said ""they played capitalist"" happy? think throw money pay people stay home. would correct right thing two week lockdown done. However nine months cost policies combined huge economic contraction means enough (by far) save economy put lockdown.

Yet China Vietnam pulled off... almost like solution central planning separating income surplus value... Yup. body aches two days, haven‚Äôt able taste smell. fianc√© got taste back smell. 17 days. Apparently get comfortable tasting smelling, friend got Halloween still can‚Äôt taste. It‚Äôs fine say ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù fact matter. Governments need build trust communities skeptical vaccines, showing many different people involved helps that. plenty idiots everywhere. Hospitals deny tell hold breath back Canada get care. reasonable concern though. 100 million doses enough vaccinate elderly Americans essential workers.

It's opinion doses go cover essential groups developing countries *before* general population USA western countries gets it. Ask dying viruses spread them. Good news then. use additional cloth mask one valve makes less conspicuous taping inside good idea, try next time. White House told cdc lie us kids spreaders could force kids back school. Heard seen that, too. Friend mine sent 2yo back daycare minute opened back up. She‚Äòa SAHM husband kind VP works home. Ridiculous. see trace - kids asymptomatic mostly, time mom/dad sick, kid would untraceable contact since they'd clear virus. currently whipping penance. understand anyone cares Bill Gates say this. fucking stupid.

Wait parents find insurance pay either. assume mean lack supply. WOULD FUCKING THOUGHT?? described elementary middle school experience perfectly.

I say high schools around (IDK many) assigned seats keep teacher day. think started week week home high schoolers since legally stay home alone parents work. _Obesity_ worst pandemic century - 7,600 deaths every day, year in, year out, due obesity. (That‚Äôs 2.8 million deaths annually)

COVID-19 thus far? 1.6 million. 

Obesity orders magnitude worse. simply cannot believe thought opening schools cases 'low' 8 weeks explosions nationwide / worldwide cannot tied schools. (and believe Science.).


If kids mainly asymptomatic, almost that, time adult shows infection got kid, kid it, can't trace back.

I'm acting like I've ""owned"" you. know potential long term effects vaccine that's using new technology, may end lethal. vaccines collectively tested 100,000 thousand people zero deaths

Small fry compared amount people infected COVID. millions vaccinated? gonna look deaths say ""oh look, 0.3% entire vaccinated population"", discounting fact that's still thousands reason purposely sabotage health

Straightforward question - trust Pfizer Merck GSK? Cause don't, given history. reputations would ruined. would lose tons money

The money already made. walk away look multiple scientists published safety vaccine. know would like believe smarter experts, not.

This kind thinking leads technocracy. '""The experts"" say x, therefore that's do'. Fact is, blindly trusting anyone bad idea. Who's say manipulate data show x z safe? I'm saying definitely do, I'm saying definitely illness, kidding me?

I meant terms spreading it. kill people accidentally giving flu know yet. entire economy shut it.

No, economy shut keeping case numbers top priority politicians helm shutdowns instead realising they're gonna people streets end keep small businesses open. people EVERY DAY families loved ones

I lost grandfather back April. time fully board lockdowns restrictions such, knew felt like lose someone it. 

After saw [politicians breaking though, started questioning things. they're breaking rules made up? press [taking masks right press ? came countries like UK [counting deaths way turned deaths COVID . 

So forgive bit sceptical I'm told politicians such, forgive little wary vaccine that's developed year using new technology manufacturers ethically dubious histories, like time [Pfizer tested trovafloxacin children Nigeria without ethical , [AstraZeneca accused corporate tax evasion](http://www.pharmafile.com/news/499747/astrazeneca-accused-tax-avoidance-dutch-scheme) , [Merck's arthritis painkiller caused heart attacks strokes, leading 60,000 . That's right - there's nothing wrong concern vaccines developed people responsible types controversies. 2-3 days would joy. It‚Äôs averaging 4-5 days results SW Ohio. Moving goal posts last comment. Listen, see well everyone there‚Äôs huge population US refusing wear masks trying convince others edge whole thing take vaccine

You need build public trust true. Please delete. Good luck that, might warmer you‚Äôre fuck lot safer bit feeling people read article all. vaccine make infertile. whole concern that, targeted tests group specifically made women pregnant planning pregnant.  


My two cent, think MRNA vaccine actually hurt pregnant mothers, considering live virus injected produce response, since immune response triggered suppose targeted spike protein, harm fetus, however mother, i'd opt time being. analogies humbly submit mixing universes: Caitlin Snow meets Captain Marvel left handed? minority still care eight 10 Americans say would receive vaccine, 40% saying would take soon available 44% saying would wait bit getting it.
  15% said would refuse vaccine entirely new survey, conducted Ipsos partnership ABC News using Ipsos' Knowledge Panel -- reflection growing confidence rapidly-developed vaccine, marks long-awaited turning point amid unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic.
  
Now that's interesting part It‚Äôs ridiculous question. lot Black Americans rightfully skeptical government-backed medicinal claims (see Tuskegee experiment good reason why). Showing skeptics Black people helped develop vaccine helps trust it. someone idea right? easy!

For people here, Swaziland (or Eswatini), one poorest countries world, gdp 4 billion (more less much small first world city), third adult population HIV, would need miracle raise medical standards something decent Grasping straws? literally hundreds thousands people told absolutely take vaccine. 
What problem that? something unsafe directly affects you?  forced stay it‚Äôs over. taking EU damn long? black person myself, sounds like saying ""wow black person something!?!?!"" getting pretty condescending point always try downplay achievements feel people thinking, ""wow he's good software engineer he's black?!?!""

Tired woke bullshit. could say...

Winter coming voted sununu Dem fool. debate every word said attacking president Republican party. Almost nothing said directed Sununu disgustingly wrong facts. think juuuuust fine. fucking sucks businesses position blame them. Federal Leadership shit made state whatever wanted. see bipartisan relief bills getting sent GOP run senate McConnell blocks gets corporate relief rich. People, mostly left, voting send real money families small businesses relief mirror countries done McConnell dismisses Senate week holidays. agree Dems scummy. really appears GOP could give zero fucks working class small business owners. 

Also, think Joe Biden gives shit us. Trump EVER has. Nancy Pelosi, I'm pretty neutral on, fucking hated pandering African shall kneeling. fuck that? can't imagine nurse doctor this. constant sound respirators, watching people suffer die without able see families again. 60-80 hours week however long takes till break.

Lots folks look space, hardware PPE required, think next big challenge we're going see attrition go roof I'm divided. really really want whole thing go away fully understand isolation works. hand, toddler, wife 8 months pregnant expected deliver early January. can't help around house due complications pregnancy take care her, house, chores errands also keeping normal work schedule, thankfully working home. already hell trying juggle this, toddler able go school either means one thing juggle. 


Then gets better. new baby arrives, hoping bring grandparents help. that's happening. means there's another baby coming equation. 
Screw covid. also, day many hours got two arms, y'know? Lots people missing point comments today. would it? They're trying slow spread virus hospitals FULL. state decided try solve things. Federal leadership NOTHING prevent this. guidance coordinated effort fight COVID. Trump golfing buddies numbers skyrocket. States left figure shit thing. House Senate come SOMETHING us, even individuals businesses. stops happening, ding ding ding, head GOP, Mitch Fucking McConnell. sure understanding. take vaccine, body learns produce antigens fight infection. exposed, body fights infection kills virus. Virus capable spreading person never got sick. asking level herd immunity needs be? Kind depends communicable disease is, though experts say 70 percent. combination vaccinated well previously exposed members herd. say 50 percent herd immunity virus could still spread unprotected members herd. Well past 50% deaths ages 70+. elderly get access vaccine thing fizzle out. Second vaccine halted due severe, unforeseen side effects. PfIzer's also severe unforeseen side effects.

Why insisting vaccines perfectly safe, I'd feel like bonehead destroying credibility making silly claim could known. reading peoples comments, I'd question agenda 

But seen level group think internet since 2002 this'll doozy reality hits. also halted Brazil. Canada UK imposed restrictions Pfizer population level anymore. major vaccine halted well, paying much attention.

I'm anti vaxx. anti lying people we're mess right now, yet people addicted trying clever manipulative via lies. need account population.

No don't, asinine comment. persons life today worth less person 1918 ""of population"", one person allowed die population 100 million, 300 million 500 million more. 

600k dead still 600k dead 1918 2020, that's fucking tragic either way. make black community little nervous propaganda aimed vaccine. trying little hard it‚Äôs uncomfortable. Fauci rounds topic well  Considering Allies much bombing that's terrible analogy. Allies Germans saviours, lesser evil. Go fuck back doorknob licking fan subs? I‚Äôm US sat contact tracing protocols/training.

Ain't yet. fair, much sourcing claim people above.  Worth noting skewed huge number elderly people gotten far. rate would definitely decrease population large infected. Divided people take idiots.

BTW J&amp;J's phase 3 clinical trial testing one-dose two-dose versions, we'll able compare data.  He‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs smart dude, kinda goofy, kinda sweet, articulate. Didn‚Äôt say is. outliers still exist shouldn‚Äôt dismissed. Yes Think marketing ploy since concerns African Americans taking vaccine?  Yep.

My friends assuring words eating out. It‚Äôs fucking insanity AstraZeneca Oxford‚Äôs first choice. Dr. Gilbert‚Äôs team discussions ‚Äúa previous company two,‚Äù Adrian Hill, one Oxford scientists, said last month. One American pharmaceutical giant Merck, Wall Street Journal AstraZeneca, known drugs treat cancer, asthma chronic conditions, scant experience Hey man - referring irritating, affluent WFH parents interact with. feel deeply single parents. whole situation nightmare without govt support. wanted clarify. He's articulate, might why. communication skills adequate best, fine, he's politician speaker. He's expert, impeccable impressive credentials. Like respectable, serious scientist, tends waffle deflect strive contextualize pressed specific answers unproven ambiguous things he's unwilling get pinned misinterpreted. Scientists frustrating talk they're conditioned deal minutiae wary drawing overbroad conclusions small sets data. Laypeople often want story. That's ""science ambassadors"" like Nye Tyson, authors like Mary Roach, tease story science.

People looking directly Fauci there's nobody next competent enough informed Fauci's expertise relay messages public effective way. Nice make assumption guess Bad journalism guys trying get little anti-mask, reopen, etc. party going? blame them, would quit long time ago. absolutely defer physicians experts complex condition. seemed encouraged mRNA vaccine interesting solution person like him. news principal school told entire faculty doors must remain open schools/kids aren‚Äôt vectors safest possible place everyone this. Unfortunately it‚Äôs news seemingly educated people believe everything article saying. think there's less talk moment - we've learned live now, vaccines way. matter getting next six months enough people vaccinated push reinfection rate point fizzles out. Minorities underrepresented positions power, look past presidents, CEOs, heads universities, etc. That‚Äôs ‚Äútells‚Äù us we‚Äôre less capable, it‚Äôs see. seeing something different highlighted exciting. feel like I‚Äôm repeating here, what‚Äôs hard understand? would expect know difference! would different vaccine specifically tested offered black people case horrific chapters history. vaccine trials multiracial vaccine promoted everyone.

Plus Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine approved several different countries (Canada, Mexico, UK, UAE, Bahrain believe far). would trust US government, trust countries‚Äô governments either. Gotta throw fact shes black right?!? don‚Äôt employ dogs sniff us it. It‚Äôs cheaper test.  fact Sweden hasn‚Äôt mandated masks yet still blows mind  soon posts online parents ‚Äújoking‚Äù able wait kids back school given year, let alone one stop outnumbering posts parents expressing concerns current state economy relates childcare concerns, argument die down. then... right. hope also live country! Without threat widespread death hospitalization, protecting from?

Even ""at risk"" people get vaccinated, everyone else still cautious, want covid may kill long term effects virus great assuming I'm interpreting comment correctly, let know I'm not.  countries done really, really well. One things common populace really values social responsibility. I've curious too. think first exposure information covid 19 definitely helps forms opinion behavior. First impressions make big impact. started volunteering April artist memorial project, drastically shaped seriously took everything compared peers still does. Hey, almost government trying hard hide numbers, know death toll already much higher reported, even close done thing. Einstein said, ‚ÄúInsanity things expecting different results?‚Äù Yeah, US government definitely insane. Yes trump back fucking everything up. Looks like guy days get genetic reshuffle vaccines coming out, pandemic come end. Guys, vaccine hope ahead us. also know people charge public health communication likely spectrum, deficits theory mind astounding. Like could worse job purposefully tried to.

This equivalent MDs telling public health stop lying. literally happened jurisdiction. is.



Disclaimer:So long health insurance, probably free/kinda cheap medical staff then? yall deserve bullshit hoaxers put yall quite frankly need since job contact directly it. Im teleworking Id happily take one, fully aware dont priority qualms it. Okay, understand you. think confused. I'm talking unintentionally spreading it. 9 months this. travel without wearing PPE point, need assume ticking time bomb. think people follow people take precautions all. information get good thing. Epidemiologists live completely different world everyone else. think people going accept mask-wearing social distancing part lives years come, completely touch. Kroger subsidiary near you, get $25 plenty available: told her. comment downvoted, rest world vaccinated, going recurrent thing.  

Like annual flu shots, may well require re-vaccination 9,000,000,000 people (two each?) rest lives. yeoman's work = good, hard, valuable work someone especially support cause, help team, etc. Maybe people want vaccine could implant chip notify cellphones case get close. /s Serious question: gata' waiting house morning ready wrestle street? true wins gets title house? Louisiana seems like fascinating place. arent enough vaccines get excited, I'm hopeful beginning end get lives back summer. honest, I'm burned out, frustrated tired. US still won‚Äôt, there‚Äôs enough doses everyone. might actually best year young life. ü§∑ I'll help bit. longer 0. doubt true, live small town, small kids teachers phone contact lists wife sits numerous community boards/associations them. So, least case, know personal interactions teachers hated remote teaching much preferred seeing students face face. 

But yes, infuriating kids come home tell us one friends got sent home sick still came school even though one siblings home fever. 

We're lucky enough two times kids came fever stomach issue COVID tests came back negative, least rampant enough infecting whole classroom. isn‚Äôt surprising they‚Äôd botch rollout, it‚Äôs still important call Trumpists this. Especially since delays caused blamed Biden.  genitalia pants

Wtf? Epidemiologists worry many unknowns, including long immunity lasts; virus may mutate; challenges vaccine distribution; possible reluctance accept vaccine among groups.

Sounds disagree we‚Äôll reach herd immunity, want keep pandemic measures without pandemic. Let‚Äôs keep mind population US less 1/3rd now, average age death Spanish flu 28, 81. terms deaths per capita, Covid even close Spanish flu. terms life lost, instead lives lost, significance isn‚Äôt even close comparable. 

We MUCH better healthcare now, fact it‚Äôs gotten bad shows much country gone shitter. Lol see Canadian rollout...we‚Äôll lucky 4-8% population vaccinated spring. frustrating news must Americans, many stretches already much better countries terms delivery schedule. forget 1918 103.000.000 people US. 

Today 330.000.000  nobody need know? stating ethnicity headlines? talk racists  Oh get it! D‚Äôoh! really think anyone beyond help, that's really simplistic way look things. People learn grow throughout lives, judge based one mistake / unwise decision consider lost cause. NY going vaccinate well people value science.
Lol amazing fast people jump straight ""my side takes seriously, unlike ""other side"". vaccine skeptics NY know, unfortunately nowhere insulated that. Yeah lot vote people want stimulus. many leopards eating peoples faces. one know queue? add this- masks cover mouth. People smile less wearing mask nobody sees it. I‚Äôm sure one could argue seeing smile someone‚Äôs eyes, etc, nurse working months several layers masks reason smile. People half brain understand don‚Äôt need bearing huge grin getting vaccine vaccine good thing.

This boils ‚Äúyou smile more‚Äù mindset. She‚Äôs resting face. Leave be. problem! Unfortunately great data this, tracked 3-4 week period. also know long immunity lasts first jab. 

But lot people quoting 52% number, incorrect, includes 10-day ramp-up period. think bring good points - definitely agree black white UK much larger global impact NZ AUS. Remember. Everyone still wear mask social distance see evidence decreased case loads hospitalizations hopefully due herd immunity likely happen spring.

Stay safe. want swine flu vaccine? want population take vaccine, build heard immunity, want convince fence take vaccine. 

Having bunch well known people public spotlight take vaccine early would help dissuade many fears reservations people vaccine. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure doctors frontline workers getting first anyway. stupid question eat drink test CVS? 

the line long thinking picking something starbucks don‚Äôt wanna mess results  Celebs rich people absolutely getting it, DL avoid attracting negative attention. U.S. Republican Senator Trump sycophant might even 'forget' take second dose.

I guarantee big issue considering stupid average person is. mother nurse volunteered start vaccinating health care workers week. It‚Äôs really exciting finally happening! necessary medical care be. Nope. US secure enough vaccines Americans do. thinking anyone else. Getting vaccine right now, would worth fortune. average Joe probably gonna wait late spring, earliest. 

If live USA, chances contracting very, high. change life now? I'm assuming still taking normal precautions like wearing full PPE masking everywhere right?

Maybe feel better able go get brunch something friend? Yes, expect it.

Because photo plastered internet, thousands people fence getting vaccinated use photo excuse get vaccine.

Perception everything. Trust earned. Using person forthe photo op mistake cost even lives. That‚Äôs tad hyperbolic. per capita basis not. Add always pandemic hysteria conspiracy precarious position say unequivocally worse. think US definitely could done better job doesn‚Äôt translate ‚Äòworse 1918‚Äô. post right makes sense topic.  unfortunate part this. Fox News Hannity, Ingraham, Carlson get vaccine live programs. answer simple, never happen.  Quite specific question, closed since March AFAIK. also led 'underground' sex work, ain't positive position safety prostitutes. One many negative side effects pandemic probably hear coming years. said even vaccines, would probably take year many activities safely restart, parts lives may never return way were.

## Abstract

Effective treatment choices severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) limited absence effective target-based therapeutics. main object current research estimate antiviral activity cannabinoids (CBDs) human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. presented research work, performed *in silico* *in vitro* experiments aid sighting lead CBDs treating viral infections SARS-CoV-2. Virtual screening carried interactions 32 CBDs SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. Afterward, *in vitro* antiviral activity carried five CBDs molecules SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, among them, two CBDs molecules namely Œî (Yu et al., 2020 \[9\])-tetrahydrocannabinol (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ10.25‚ÄØŒºM) cannabidiol (IC50‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ7.91‚ÄØŒºM) observed potent antiviral molecules SARS-CoV-2 compared reference drugs lopinavir, chloroquine, remdesivir (IC50 ranges 8.16‚Äì13.15‚ÄØŒºM). molecules found stable conformations active binding pocket SARS-CoV-2 Mpro molecular dynamic simulation density functional theory. findings suggest cannabidiol Œî (Yu et al., 2020 \[9\])-tetrahydrocannabinol possible drugs human coronavirus might used combination drug molecules treat COVID-19 patients. Yeah this? ready vaccine today still seems like far away. Britain vaccinating people last week. can't imagine mismanaging anything America mismanaged pandemic told me. Yeah! Unfortunately really common experience North Americans, specially ones come marginalized groups. understand white North Americans seems really unnecessary weird, lot
kids huge. can‚Äôt speak Europeans, feeling brown Europeans similar experiences.
The whole ‚Äúnot seeing race‚Äù thing huge privilege comes experiences negatively impacted race, food thought. Even pessimistic view shared case, 21 million people. 500k elected officials us, 18 million healthcare workers, 3.2 millions people 1%. Next elderly, ~45m people 65. comes 66m people rich, well connected, risk population. Let's add another 10 million younger people high risk conditions. 75 million people. 25 million ""everyday joes"" left get vax end April Idk someone ends believing backward nonsense... oh wait yeah Fox News Agreed! vaccine talk action. started spring promising vaccine late summer. disappointing results shady trial-results, desperatly want spotlight back. biontech grinding lab, oxford-scientist tabloids making unrealistic promises.

the loud ones usually disappointing - oxford fits category. would pretty bold assumption make, considering know nothing anybody life. record, I‚Äôm ‚Äúpreaching‚Äù anybody, I‚Äôm posting thoughts feelings based things I‚Äôve observed people around me. also never called anybody ‚Äúterrible disgusting,‚Äù actions definitely been. annoying Trump circlejerking every single thread still time! Lol... milf (Psst...they aren‚Äôt informing cases. Sick kids show school daily. Teachers losing fighting union go remote. Don‚Äôt believe admins.) covid vaccine free US mean perfect world would 700 million doses today. there's definitely ""shortage"". question whether get everyone vaccinated middle year end. Personally I'd say absolutely hit 70% next fall. Unfortunately winter going shitshow matter do. done that, sub would bitching America hoarding medicine. 

This sub already *convinced* rich people going vaccinated ER nurses Los Angeles, based absolutely nothing. Yet morons think ordered 300,000,000 doses every vaccine? Jesus Christ. People need wear masks everyone US gets vaccine Pfizer took 0$ dollars federal sources (meaning trump/warp speed) Research &amp; development. administration PASSED 500 million additional doses November negotiating get today. 

If going get political (which virus political issue, science issue) least understand support. Well, right. 7 day average eclipse 200K plateau sight. Meanwhile Colorado, 
[Thanksgiving spike didn‚Äôt materialize, reopen Fuck no
 
Doctors frontline first. 
 
Thered excuse celebs getting first. isnt goddamn popularity bullshit. life death, celebs actually important anything first one important ([confers 52% ~85% effective )), I'd say track assume people get second. ideally track both. hopefully begin publishing data week jan 20th. Pythagoras furry rain you!

edit: also fury... get doses vaccine still need isolate 10 days believe, still possibly transmit virus get it/will get minor case cares calculated attempt get African Americans trust vaccine. number staggering. I've witnessed otherwise intelligent friends say crazy stuff vaccines I'm sure we'll hit 600K vaccines starting roll out. think lot depends happens Christmas New Years. What's kind scary IHME model's projection even rapid vaccine deployment still showing 482K April 1. Yikes! parts capital i've read Marx related unemployment increase production scarcity means production, COVID lockdowns causing increase production, decrease?  

## Conclusion Expecting Outcomes

There urgent global need universal vaccine cover SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains stop threat inevitable second wave coronavirus. Currently, hundreds clinical trials, yet approved antiviral drugs specific treatment COVID-19. physical, biological, medical properties CO2 gas suggest humified warmed CO2 gas possesses multiple bioactivities offer new concept SARS-CoV-2 viral disinfection COVID-19 treatment. inexpensive broadly applicable therapy could lead massive reduction global number infected, especially used carrier delivery inhaled drugs creates new possibilities mitigation suppression COVID-19 second wave, indeed new future respiratory viral pandemic. future, bioactive properties CO2 could identified, mechanisms action investigated. believe well-designed clinical trials CO2 various bioactive properties warranted examine efficacy diseases human beings. hoped hypothesis serve stimulus investigation issue. killed nowhere near 5%. US population 1918 103 million. killed .5%. posture photo shows she‚Äôs comfortable singled team. Well hate cold snow sort understand reasoning, especially they're paying mortgage house bought want maximize use still can. 

It seems ridiculously risky. Things get back normal vaccinate enough people, remain vigilant. Yep. critically ill patients, also trip quite difficult, impossible. 

That‚Äôs scary part. triage doctors must because, society wealthy medically enables USA, community behavior forcing death citizens might otherwise able saved. Lmfao never said would tracking devices vaccine . take vaccinations matter what, people. better worse US paid fuck ton money three vaccines result get anyone else. Don‚Äôt make false equivalencies. Let subject discussed unto itself.  Fun fact: [anti maskers thing Definitely, regardless pandemic ends, I'm never going able forget many people selfish cruel honest, ruined mental health. Ugh get better boyfriend. 

And yeah I‚Äôd pissed roommate.

Outside safer inside, masked safer unmasked. risk it‚Äôs bunch people staying one place hours. Hopefully windy. shake head? rushed vaccine human history first one we've coronavirus. hope successful, skeptical. agree you, insane. Doctor then. People entitled opinions harms people profession takes oath protect, harm, Doctor work medical field, period. refusing get vaccinated medical field puts patients risk harm. Safety patient one top concerns. anymore, patient. need shut get fcking vaccine (unless medical reason course) find different field work in. 

Sorry, salty topic. Oddly topic, husband thinks due number viral fatigued survivors mix long debated 4 day week 3 day weekend might gain traction population brim stimulants without number living fully abled people meet demands, need another business day gone eases many issues ignore.

The name ""Spanish Flu"" kinda disinformation itself. Spain major nation world without Orwellian levels censorship going time. None belligerents wanted worry populations epidemic top bazillion whatever boys killed maimed psychologically tortured, newspapers report it. country reporting Spain, due non-participation war therefore heightened freedom press, world started noticing, looked flu originated Spain, hence Spanish flu. 


And I'm pulling info memory, quote me, believe Spanish Flu's Typhoid Mary American GI, first cases army barrack Georgia. Americans went overseas 1917, brought Europe. Obesity widely reported risk back March. much sympathy even tried lose weight get fit. wonder Moderna vaccine talked compared Pfizer vaccine. agree, there's reward acting responsibly and, even worse, blatant unfairness sent back line vaccinations. That's pitching thought experiment purposes discussion figure epidemiological implications line thinking. 

In isolation, seems useful stop transmission vectors. However, much like economics, phenomenon directed human, therefore able react policies implemented.

Targeting irresponsible vectors would likely increase transmission people get frustrated policy stop acting responsibly. So, respond point, indeed, terrible plan. 

But might work vaccinating, example, wild monkeys tigers read.   Pointing areas high intergenerational living seeing high numbers right now. literally topic. don‚Äôt vast majority us work hospitals rarely ever go them. vast majority us ""healing"" from? Welp say 1/4 say won‚Äôt take poll, polling?

I'd also say--and true polls, true general human self knowledge: There's world difference say do, actually do. polled everyone New Year's Day dieting, poll saying going healthiest year American history. Actual behavior align perceived planned behavior. Facts Like said, xenophobia might factor. ridiculous choice: go someplace culturally similar (where out-of-control epidemic) go someplace different culture different language (but there's epidemic).

*said straight face obese person smoking cigarette* sure. know girlfriend pretty devastated. Today first day long time i've felt genuinely hopeful stuff. still stressful tiring see light end tunnel. position in, right thing taking help encourage trust vaccine?  I'm bit wary too. Let's see Moderna's CEO does. going running tally many people vaccinated? think could lot good psyche country / world, especially number really starts grow higher death count eventually, case count. Masking happening low levels worldwide time think draw many conclusions it. catch: mRNA vaccines completely novel, first one ever human use. downvoted stated fact still get infected rather actually don‚Äôt know not. Scientists aren‚Äôt world‚Äôs parents, none ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù ‚Äúpunishing‚Äù anyone. 

It‚Äôs best scientific approach stop pandemic. 

You see world weird way. 

Don‚Äôt let ego-inflating self righteousness get way actual reality. US country literally ever. keep rereading I'm sure tired realy saying there's bigger risk children dying kept home. thing I‚Äôm concerned unable vaccinated relying herd immunity safe. think responsible thing mask/distance much possible herd immunity reached. people vaccinated, restrictions lift sooner rather later everything normal safe travel. doubt Florida restrictions since barely now. also arent ridiculously obese diabetic like US. Doubtful. open lawsuits. Restaurants enforce requirements see business do. We're kind already seeing masks. jesus that's freaking scary find out. glad gotten w/all crazy anti-vax stuff going around like plague :/ Depends time takes vaccine reach effective level immune response, numbers people vaccinated, vax prevent asymptomatic mild case spread prevents severe illness? pfizer &amp; moderna chcking initial study, hopefully now. I‚Äôve heard everyone wants one April Don‚Äôt get wrong, people held accountable wearing masks told private property. ridiculous. kid 2. 2 year olds young understand this.

It‚Äôd different kid 12 22 2? You‚Äôre lucky get 2 year old put toys away without issues. Pick battles United.

Having said that, one plane 2 year old right now. that‚Äôs opinion. says lot.... vaccination elderly save elderly lives. could vaccinate one person person could walk senior care facility kill dozens hundreds people.  

In short, vaccinating 20% population saves lives. could vaccinate 80% still save lives wrong people get infected. vaccine results thus far, there's reason throw another summer away. 

If get Moderna AZ approved top Pfizer, really think small sense normalcy going return (at least US) April so. infection death rates plummet, even lot cautious people going resume lives degree. 

Again, said downthread worth repeating - expect Memorial Day weekend summer crazy around country travel, parties, etc. . would continue masked, assuming everyone vaccinated? he's free travel florida stands right now. can't imagine changing policy, especially people vaccinated would know better anyone worried about. also seem like kind guy would fake get population take it. He's worked public health field decades could way lucrative positions. None npis much significance spread flu worldwide. Spanish Flu generally ran population mutated less deadly virus. ""Oh bloody hell...."" *Sighs &amp; drinks tea* That's uneducated buy internet fear-mongering. worst outcome vaccine, fraction worst outcome getting COVID. don‚Äôt understand mean, get complete vaccine shouldn‚Äôt able get transmit it. link something discussing might helpful Yeah nothing hip ignoring people going suffer pointlessly. shit.  country in? sadly first shots given political figures a.k.a people didn‚Äôt lift finger protect laughed thought virus dangerous. Smh. still need wear masks herd immunity achieved. said, I'll swapping wearing KN95 12 hours day something comfortable that. I'll believe see it. half population deadset taking covid vaccine? want hopeful but....... virus sucks. Looks like UK another rise infection rate hospitalisation too. happening over. look bright side. Life meaningless we're gonna die &lt;3 Don‚Äôt worry government fuck somehow asymptomatic infection **could** reduce viral transmission

Sure.. **could,** data whether doesn't

(it might transmission **could** also reduced vaccine, regardless PCR swab positivity) Ah, thanks! curious happened. suffice conspiracy nuts, fact asking questions BIG clue probably one.   Missing prom must hard high school seniors too, especially girls dreamed years going. I'd really like explain restrictions anti science mandating vaccinations know COVID preexisting condition. People flat idiots think vaccinations mean everything go back normal millions street facing eviction.

Also market opening back hospitals overloaded people sick work, see Florida. Bunnies? Awesome ! lol doubtful trump wrote that. Pretty sure handlers take care anything require full, complete sentences. grammar, punctuation. lack caps. organization words.

Those elites. use replenish life force. /s infinitely easier, smoother, faster blanket ""no mask, fly"" policy deal things case-by-case basis. 

I also really give shit 2 year old thinks, whether understand what's happening. Catching COVID toddler different catching COVID 22-year-old.

I hate United every airline, I'm this. letter, addressed leaders Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney +, Apple TV+, Hulu, HBO Max, King underlines Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) guidance Americans avoid traditional holiday travel gatherings reduce transmission COVID-19, well increased danger social isolation typically festive family-driven season. Citing unique position provide Americans safe entertainment options winter months, King requests streamers open content non-subscribers public service, aiming boost national spirits protect public health non-traditional holiday season. I'm happy hear this! wish grandparents best, things return normal them. :) Thanks pointing out.

Definitely copy-pasting agenda. wow, principled..saving 1 place line, really believe Like said comments, own. shut em man literally said would return normal 2021, changing mind every week 60% includes asymptomatic cases. Realistically considered might see Pfizer vaccine less impressive headline 90%+ since caught symptomatic people trial. Selfishly, \_want\_ vaccine. I've extremely cautious. understand healthcare workers people frontline ought get priority me, that's cool. extremely frustrating irresponsible people prioritized getting vaccine. understand concept vaccinating people risk, people risk choices. Additionally, sounds like perhaps 100 million people already infected time vaccines truly available. people presumably least level protection, rest us basically none. Yet heard anyone talking deprioritizing people, people truly need vaccine get first. also somewhat frustrating we're talking NOW, 9 months pandemic. sure would nice tell people back in, say, April priorities could be. wonder whether maskless people might behaved responsibly told ""those demonstrate irresponsible behavior get lowest priority vaccine comes out"". feels late create naughty nice lists, better late never? Good point. would that? Waiting results? Better fact. IIRC, good flu vaccine two thirds effective given year. 95% good enough drop r0 low enough significant portion population get achieve herd immunity. politico-speak, designed non-committal, sound like saying something without actually saying anything. extensive media training talk like that.

Frustrating, need read anything sinister it. agree traveling Florida dumb decision, Florida's easily swapped Vietnam. many older folks long flight, language barriers, reduced accessibility need walk farther distances, etc. intimidating cases prohibitive. elderly people know it, even adventurous travel younger. Even doctors nurses hospitals polling 50% so- outlook great. need pretty large sentiment shift. Didn‚Äôt Trump say NY wasn‚Äôt going get vaccine? Oh, that‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm being, like, super dramatic about, like, nearly 300,000 dead Americans. need to, like, relax shit Walmart treats it‚Äôs customers like shoplifting trying rip off. horrible. don‚Äôt shop even though don‚Äôt lot choices am. proven effective Covid even is, vaccines would still better Problem options seen bad, people twitter criticizing made decision.

Completely completely agree Canada guidelines 14 days, office would ‚Äúfine‚Äù December 16 Rich would ‚Äúfine‚Äù December 18. contact Rich‚Äôs case secondary doesn‚Äôt require quarantine too, unless Rich tests positive.

I think right people nursing homes first responders medical professionals go first someone tell directly get one today, next week next month. I'd say run people start informing next group think kind supported said dude Long term effects COVID people full recovery. I'm science teacher (currently physics Chem, previously taught Bio Earth Science). faculty members (SCIENCE faculty members!) openly talk never get flu vaccine, flu once, absolutely get COVID vaccine. feel disheartened disconnected peers. used admire people, more; feel alone. teach science can't understand this, can? mean, maybe people vaccine feel power magic bullet, nobody, outside people harms way are.  ‚Äúyou still distance mask vaccine time,‚Äù true.

That's known point, everyone make risk assessment deciding whether vaccinate not. Correct I'm wrong, culture lot intimate terms personal space? Anglosphere culture distanced. Dunno, spitballing. also need 80% population get it, see happening.  Bunch photo ops things been. medical professionals work choosing get yet.

Maybe also urge ISPs fuck people data caps well. Got bored work

My time shine baby.

Ok USA 200k cases day.

Most populace get vaccine untill March -June.

200k cases day * 30 *6 = 
36,000,000. 
But there's more.

We +-16million cases moment.

So 16+35=51,000,000.

Which translates roughly 14/100 people 

To answer question, someone family get covid.

Good news vaccine yes worst part now, always darkest dawn etc. Also one thing overlooked need two shots* vaccine work, set month.

*Not including new vaccines. Same, im going senior year next fall. Sweden played stupid game it'll never live down. forever known country played eugenics still failed save economy, matter much fact checking details matter alternative history spins off. countries tried save lives, Sweden gleeful supporters even say lives expandable. respect. That's [demonstrably false across effective NPIs include curfews, lockdowns closing restricting places people gather smaller large numbers extended period time. includes small gathering cancellations (closures shops, restaurants, gatherings 50‚Äâpersons fewer, mandatory home working on) closure educational institutions. around year believe Radiology (X-ray, CT, MRI, Interventional radiology, NM, Ultrasound, etc.) three people gotten Covid. vaccine coming little known see risk worth taking. take get sick adverse effects miss work would otherwise fine. already hours cut people forced take month long sabbaticals. Better see goes take there‚Äôs certainty.

It‚Äôs funny medical professional nearly year honest post make seems always get downvoted. People seem really hate truth. science medical field? teen comes home tells interesting stories. Sweden 60% includes asymptomatic cases. 

I believe actually included report different vaccine, mistake. Thanks! I‚Äôll tell her, loves Thai food. üòä mean, *right now*? vaccine. know access. Well 99% antivaxxers survive fine, even contract covid (which far certain). think die-off going happen. vaccine candidate based messenger RNA, technology shown separately Moderna alliance BioNTech Pfizer 95% effective, far expectations. know US doctors quitting left right want ride out... uneducated guess would say medical field he‚Äôs huge figurehead? sure that‚Äôs right word. saw comment saying nurses polling 50% take vaccine/not take it. would also help persuade people see someone position take it.

Not Pfizer's specifically addresses said. Like, really specifically.

But yeah, strangers congregating actually reduces viral spread, fun Cfr vs ifr poll, roughly one four Americans say get vaccinated. another one four say remain unsure won‚Äôt get inoculated vaccine made available via largest vaccination program U.S. history.  ominous numbers: Unless 70% U.S. residents get vaccine, nation reach level create herd immunity refuse shots, experts say.  disturbing side note, recent Gallup poll found political divide: 50% Republicans willing get COVID-19 vaccine, compared 75% Democrats.

I'm doctor, hundreds best scientists doctors top global universities governmental regulatory bodies suggesting take it. face almost seems like hubris skeptical. different people skeptical 5G even though spell non-ionizing radiation. would excellent idea matter end. Unless high risk 70+, wait millions millions get vaccinated anyways. defense showing facebook post someone sent him. Said figured BS, wanted know saw yet. Pfizer vaccine white house called demanded approval resignation letter politicizing? Wow, talk stupid necessarily, unlike Spanish flu recession depression right (1920), government numerous safety nets place. Remember back then, Medicaid, Medicare, health insurance (everyone paid pocket back then). social security welfare programs, bailouts, FDIC (bank account protection), basically nothing help. posting quite bit summer post post sub people gloating Northeast successful many southern states stupid learn lesson provided.

It airborne virus spreads like anything else people indoors. smarter, locked longer, people wearing masks FL, outdoors more. MUST REPEAT REPEATS ITSELF!! Yep. Hindsight 20:20 - knew know now, would invested solely ramping manufacturing MRNA vaccines, since appear significantly effective types vaccine.

But 6 months ago, suggest bet everything never-before-tested type vaccine seeming sure bet Oxford would seemed crazy, even though would turned better. heard magically go away Easter 2020 I‚Äôll wait see that. History repeats itself. mine scheduled Friday!!! I'm relieved! There's light end tunnel! Long-term effects rare. 

[The comprehensive survey ""Long COVID"" date showed 2.3% patients aged 10-49 reported symptoms lasting longer 12 these, older patients longer-lasting effects. Please happen, 21st June hope celebrate properly friends family. lot deaths Spanish flu bacterial pneumonia though; possible without antibiotics would covid deaths across demographics pneumonia cases became non-lethal modern treatment. edited link timestamp, seems spotify link working. Apologies. Nothing posted thing said.

In exact time Iowa's cases hospitalizations dropped rapidly South Dakota. Nebraska. 

Neither 2 states mandates put restrictions. airline's policy worded though? read ""Children 2"" read ""Children 2 under""? 40m Pfizer 100m AstraZeneca (which going approved either week next). ordered think 7m Moderna vaccine. Though think we'll alright two tbh.

My grandma actually got first dose Pfizer today, lives carehome.

I wish EU would get move on, I'm dual national want family Ireland get access vaccines asap go visit sooner rather later. Yeah, seems like madness wait long.

And greatest respect like many people Turkey celebrate Christmas! Im Santa Barbara, wonder we'll see people moved coming weeks. struggles understand Finland Norway successful.

I think Europe struggles that. mine, one person met reddit it. probably know before, many people know know? Two year olds it. cousin two wears correctly. friends. entirely dependent parents' teaching ability priorities get trouble trying make much money possible

Trouble who? government care. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* No. not. 

Your child get run around naked piss aisle either. importantly, herd immunity vaccine   apparently show evidence preventing transmission? 
 
This mRNA vaccine effectively protects user. seem stop prevention. sense, like pre-treatment. Which, good whoever gets vaccine. would even talk herd immunity affect transmission? whole point herd immunity enough people ""shielded"" transmission, cut Rt 1.0 virus goes away. 
 
That seem case vaccine. like treatment. video made disinformation propagandist using numerology attempt misinform viewers grift money. q-anon level idiocy. Honestly, please delete comment avoid inadvertently spreading dangerous misinformation. seems patient running clinic here!

- Kris Kringle, Miracle 34th street. right, agree that, again, i‚Äôm continuing follow precautions public setting. i‚Äôm trying understand people ‚Äúpersonally safe‚Äù sounds like change absolutely nothing way interact *everyone* ‚Äúpersonally safe,‚Äù makes sense. difference june (at least way understand it), theoretically actually *be* safe around vaccinated people, contrast *illusion* safe around healthy people vaccine even available take trip let alone fly.

Entitled indeed. deadly 65. suspect amount deaths distributed evenly people would care more. Since old person's disease, die hidden away hospitals old folk's homes easy ignore. Lol.

A mask going kill child. information seen suggests that? grandma live Ireland? Absolutely, would sooooo nice, people obeyed rules... takes like 5 people one apartment afford rent California Fauci says March/April available general public, I'll give May.

I would honestly rather die continue living been, even summer things open. Like I'm willing mask grocery store I'm going limit size events host/go I'm going wear mask private events. That's good know!

The major allergy Papaya-- like EpiPen &amp; everything... probably linked someway latex allergy. Although latex causes rashes/sores/irritation me. almost die lol  Sending people spread virus Native Americans heard friend? Alrighty.

I‚Äôm Puerto Rican Spanish. thank showing someone claiming others racist also racist don‚Äôt seem mentality PoC. I‚Äôm surprised, want highlight fact. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. 42% seems like smart rationale brother. anything, less educated people ones denial science. realizing modern science far beyond dude smoking blunt questioning vaccine good step. drew line years didn‚Äôt wear masks flu killing tens thousands year. long? Indefinitely? masks always required going forward? really discriminatory towards kids that‚Äôs ok. Well it‚Äôs illegal sell then, ways distribute would filed FDA recorded. would get logistically? would need dozens rich pharma, FDA, healthcare workers participating scheme one getting pissed spilling beans.  Exact phrasing:

*All travelers age 2 required wear face coverings entire flight. We're also requiring travelers wear face coverings airport, including United customer service counters kiosks, United Club‚Ñ† locations, gates baggage claim areas.*

I would take mean age 2 fly without mask. 2 years old + 1 second, age 2. Apparently that's folks United defining too. mUh fREedom!!! Lampe Berger flame actually kill airborne viruses? mother lighting house since plumber left afternoon swears works kill Covid. extremely doubtful. Thoughts? He‚Äôd need two doses. I‚Äôm saying vaccinate employees‚Äîjust top dog. That‚Äôs taking vaccine away literally one person, convinces even two people get vaccine it‚Äôs net gain. thing wild Spanish Flu disproportionately killed young, healthy people normally don‚Äôt die flu. know exactly I‚Äôm talking about. vaccine prevent infection. vaccine builds immune response vaccinated people won‚Äôt get disease. Disease infection thing.

Getting vaccine automatically mean can‚Äôt infect others. several reasons including infection spreading primarily nose isn‚Äôt strong immune response.

Whether getting vaccination stops person spreading virus yet studied. don‚Äôt know one way vaccine produces ‚Äústerilizing immunity‚Äù means vaccinated people can‚Äôt spread virus.

It‚Äôs unsubstantiated idea right vaccinated people can‚Äôt spread virus.

It‚Äôs already well established asymptomatic people spread virus. 

I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs hard understand basics here. don‚Äôt know vaccine prevents vaccinated person spreading virus.

People don‚Äôt want hear want assume vaccine end pandemic. intentional biasing sampling data. last bit fit: 

‚ÄúSEAN: Thank you, producer Amina hatched lab. help answer questions obviously pretty well, many epidemiologists there. think regular people help, too? 
MARIA: really think certainly job. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs job. think people really help well, like many things disagree about, person life reach might Covid-19 vaccine. might able really productive conversation vaccine. say, know, understand concerns really makes sense given everything that's going given much new. let try sit talk concerns kind explain common ground. want safe healthy. want safe healthy. want get vaccine protect do. 
SEAN: think like flip side coin helping people hesitant understand vaccine maybe quell fears also caution people maybe overconfident moment, like, ‚ÄòGreat, there's vaccine, over!‚Äô over, right? 

MARIA No, I'm sorry say this, no, over. vaccines one tool public health toolkit, they're important tool. They're wonderful they're huge success story. know vaccine prevent getting sick, might good preventing getting people sick. also really important note considered vaccinated probably two weeks receive second dose. wait then, kind long time, also make sure everything else meantime continue everything else sort afterwards. One thing that's really challenging really hard fact process transmission United States high vaccine effective reducing that. number cases still really high baseline so, high. really need continue using tools have. 
MARIA: know, think lot conversation Covid virus, we're going win virus really feel like decisions made virus. think may forget people power. us ability make behavioral changes prevent spread.‚Äù History? Nothing learned that. next time bang head wall hurt. foretell new apocalypse, human race dies stupidity gifted social media.  agree go older, risk first. think accept many young people get COVID though say matter vulnerable protected. new virus know much surprised medical community many times. also know 100 year olds recover 20 year old, healthy college students don't. People thread saying goal vaccinate vulnerable that, there's justification public health protections place. personally think goal herd immunity provide anyone vaccine wants one, thus significantly reducing spread. also vulnerable people cannot vaccinated rely herd immunity. Disgusting flying to. 

And, according another post, they've flying kid summer. way emergencies. That's true. UK reporting suspected deaths totals since beginning pandemic. AFAIK, demographics say take vaccine people 18. obvious reasons, trials children lot difficult, time consuming, requires intense stringency. that, trials far included adults aged 18 (I think maybe 16-17 year old range yet). empirical data adults.

Scientists live data. data adults clearly safe effective age groups. likely vaccine also safe children, simply data support hypothesis make judgement data acquired.

On top that, children fare whole lot better adults get COVID statistical standpoint, limited vaccine availability make judgement call focus groups need comes research deployment, that's Pfizer vaccine trials done. Herd immunity real thing context vaccination. point percentage population able get vaccinated vaccine effective. vaccinating critical portion population surrounding unvaccinated people enough vaccinated people, protect indirectly. Quality shitpost I‚Äôd curious see though effectiveness one shot instead two equally high year value begins differ really don‚Äôt get this. COVID tests uncomfortable traumatic strep test pretty commonly used kids. People overhyping bad test is. 95% people immune 5% 5% population spread virus to. vaccine 100% effective 95% good gets. Herd immunity reached. still cases polio smallpox world even though pretty much everyone world vaccinated them. polio smallpox spread problem? pandemic? no. that's aiming for. Nothing 100% science epidemiology. still get Covid 19 virus beds hospitals effective treatments. Ursula von der Leyen!

I hate her. swayed trump cult point long gone already. roundabout way ask degree virology, no. went school botany expert. far medical field goes family friends working industry ""as nurses, job placement, er."" trust telling know definitive proof yet. less year study virus. ask? Pasted transcript others prefer read (sorry formatting. I‚Äôm mobile, also character limits)

‚ÄúMARIA SUNDARAM (Epidemiologist): say caveat, possible force anyone change mind want change mind they've already made mind, they're going get one push it, that's maybe case call family, ‚ÄòMy mind made up. confuse facts.‚Äô 
SEAN: *chortle*
MARIA: leaving aside, think there's lot people maybe questions. want know little they're slightly hesitant. They're slightly fence vaccines. understandable. really new vaccine product. understand people want know more. also get idea asking questions. That's day job researcher. 
SEAN: That's day job, too. 
MARIA: *laughs*
SEAN: I, ask questions right now? I, like, pretend someone who‚Äôs ‚Äúvaccine hesitant‚Äù? 
MARIA: Oh, yeah. 
SEAN: Maybe can, like, tell be. maybe maybe tell hesitant, kind go motions might sound like people. 
MARIA Yeah. Yeah. Let's definitely, let's it. 
SEAN: OK. right, here's first one. right, so, Maria, vaccine developed faster vaccine kind history world. corners cut here? thing's half baked? 
MARIA That's good question asking. totally get asking it. right, vaccine production timeline super, super fast. say kind beginning absolutely corners cut. different procedures take identify vaccine safe vaccine effective, still happened like would happened taken 10 years. happened way quicker. reason happened way quicker lot interest developing vaccines. lot money lot political went developing vaccines know important responding pandemic. Another thing that's really important lot people, tens thousands people agreed participate. number people agreed participate clinical trials really helped us find lot quicker vaccines safe they're effective. lastly, actually already seen coronaviruses cause severe disease. One original SARS. Another one called MERS, diseases also really high interest. already kind went road developing vaccines coronaviruses. starting entirely scratch able hit ground running well. 
SEAN: United States, like everything else virus, vaccine politicized. president's bragging it. guy said maybe it'd good idea use disinfectant treat virus. sure whole process politicized? sure FDA level sort approved hydroxychloroquine later reverse approval? 
MARIA hope much nerd digression everyone listening. always think story Odyssey Odysseus asks crew tie mast ship dove overboard he's listening sirens singing. kind knows beforehand tempting going be. knows beforehand exactly make sure keeps safe crew safe. lot ways, that's kind clinical trial. Obviously, want vaccine safe effective. understand personal interest saying safe effective. trial starts, group statisticians, clinicians, physicians scientists, epidemiologists like myself, sit table say, ‚ÄòOK, here's number people we're going enroll. Here's number cases we're going able find. Here's exactly percent effectiveness we're going strong, statistically powered find. we're going stop study see outcome see vaccine effective thought might stop early. see we're seeing safety outcomes thought, might stop early.‚Äô write rules hand independent safety monitoring committee, Data Safety Monitoring Board, DSB continually reviews information that's coming clinical trial. they're ones make decision safe, effective. lot ways, we're trying protect making sort political decision even deciding something really wish true. But, know, maybe science support. 
SEAN: know. saw something Facebook said there's non-human DNA vaccine. Like, chance become sort human chimera? 
MARIA OK, yes.
SEAN: Yes!
MARIA: No. There's chance. Sorry, that's responded. usually say yes people ask question want know I'm listening. bad question respond yes immediately. 
SEAN: first mistake.
MARIA: good question understand asking it. no, become chimera neither ability like Spider-Man anything. here's what's going happen mRNA vaccine. Usually get seasonal flu vaccine, example, we're showing immune system killed copy virus immune system learns looks like learns protect it. mRNA vaccine, actually similar. maybe one two steps removed. instead showing immune system full killed copy virus, we're giving reading instructions make one protein sars-cov-2 virus, really like set IKEA instructions we're giving ourselves. cells say, ‚ÄòOK, I'm going read this. I'm going make piece furniture, I'm going learn protect piece furniture.‚Äô thing mRNA set instructions kind degrades time. read certain number times, kind goes away. become incorporated DNA. like me, reading book make pile books. new piece information cells use. 
SEAN: know attempt track us all? read vaccines contain nanoparticles act biometric detectors, patented Bill Melinda Gates Foundation. know started this. biometric detectors traded cryptocurrency push cash flow. 
MARIA tell you, understood words. 
SEAN: Get level. 
MARIA: *laughs* I'm sorry. I've watching much great British baking show enough documentaries cryptocurrency. 
MARTIN: haven‚Äôt got modern machinery see haven‚Äôt got Youtube Facebook online things all.
In general, like, vaccines material track you. would really poor use really great public health strategy really great success story. also seems like technologically possible. think there's microchips lot things, certainly microchips vaccine. 
SEAN: I'll take word it. 
MARIA appreciate that. 
SEAN: Maria, thank indulging character Hesitant Vaccine Getter there.
MARIA Oh, pleasure. nice character actually.‚Äù need certain percentage population get vaccines end, level immunity population needed protect can't get vaccine. point make compulsory? going enough people keep us crossing finish line?  hope not. What, mean president throwing pandemic plan made previous administration spite previous president good idea? happened mum rubella. Immunity take contracted rubella whilst 6 weeks pregnant me. good news antibodies protection. think that's reason survived, immune response there.

Tbh pregnant right might easier whole world social distancing! fine baby :) They're likely catch you. I‚Äôve read, five days normal refrigerated conditions. spots US accessible within window? guess better question whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúfinancially‚Äù feasible government penny pinch anyone isn‚Äôt already wealthy though. Western Australia hasn‚Äôt case corona like eight months. deserve credit handled it. Along buried ancient stone-aged burial grounds. 100M J&amp;J also. That's single shot well. gets approved Jan would game-change. want go packed theater stuff popcorn. read vaccine posts subreddit, people thinking vaccines tested all. Like ten thousands volunteers phases fake news something. ignorance astonding even though every vaccine news post tied AutoModerator bot post featuring FAQ.  info AZ wrong tbh. lot misinformations surrounding beginning smack libel Pfizer/Moderna definitely vested interest stopping vaccine provided cost (and far cheaper) theirs.

The vast majority test subjects given standard full dose time. administrative error regarding half dosage small minority participants reported UK's health agency way back summer, agency actually ordered Oxford continue trial terms.

Efficiacy/safety data fully available Lancet, suprise surpise, Moderna/Pfizer's aren't. Fair. Speaking Canadian (I moved States almost 2 years ago), hate winter would love go someplace tropical, options right now. safe places require 2-week quarantine, 10 days haha

When get 2nd vaccine shot, I'll responsibly (mask all) travel catch family friends spending year isolation. I'll take sabbatical fuck Vietnam least 3 months. :) top pre-pandemic destination (more Costa Rica man myself) it'll one safest places earth. This! main take vaccination procedure. think biggest group people (including lot people around me) far culture goes, people also love flaunt rules. I'm looking forward getting mask backed Kickstarter. filter intake well filter outflow. He‚Äôs busy lockdown skeptic Hear timeframe US trials plan wrap up? Believe J&amp;J Dec/Jan... call bullshit excuse, like one vaccine really going make difference, it‚Äôd beneficial took build trust.  Distinction

Yes, erection. No, erection. No, let's look science says. vaccines safe effective. tested 30,000 people Thank pointing out, future, someone spamming conspiracy theories/spamming comment pushing certain drug whatever, please report us rather engaging! want minimize amount metadrama greatest extent possible :) No. don‚Äôt think world making big deal.

First article Google result question flu: CDC estimates 12,000 61,000 deaths annually since 2010 blamed flu. higher number reflects particularly harsh 2017-2018 flu season. years, US death toll flu closer 34,000 43,000. Globally, World Health Organization (WHO) estimates flu kills 290,000 650,000 people per year.""

You look YTD coronavirus yourself. know what's worst thing mental health? fact stay inside. fact impossible get job now. fact economy shambles. people like you. People care less terrible pandemic economy hurting.

Do think like like this? think us like like this? think love spending literally time tiny studio able see family Christmas? hate everything it, most, hate people disregard human life sake ""economy"".

You know would help mental health? Everybody together realizing much terrible situation is, also realizing order save lives, maybe even grandparents' parents' lives.

It's save lives, stay inside, realize together shitty situation is. likely somewhere 10 25% right now.

Daily rates look like transmission rate 1.5 weeks ago, would imply 30% saturation value, may even lower right people got scared. 

But people relax coming weeks, driving herd immunity threshold higher again. going surpass number many deaths acceptable? Seriously, draws line? Jeff Bezos gets stuck jail contempt court, I'm going believe corporate personhood.

Unless stick behind bars sit ass church pew, person. think misleading, someone smarter probably debunk video I‚Äôm glad well takes absolutely horrendous. Yeah, I'm also Melb, team office one day per week. work home, office hosting dev/test systems storage. rate might shift AWS (for hosting) local coffee shop odd meeting. Indeed. US: dozens developing countries even getting vaccine 2022 point. 

Hundreds thousands volunteers still needed clinical trials.

We've developed website volunteers find trials area. AZ J&amp;J among them: http://coviddash.org. Right!? What‚Äôre going next, reward people willingly took student debt without thought paying back fuck everyone right thing? Santa üéÖ it‚Äôs blairwitch ! it‚Äôs easterbunny ! Reminds AOC's viral politics videos... Sure, but, everyone received polio vaccine kid. amount people I've talked that's said plan getting covid vaccine astounding. hope enough people voluntarily take enough herd immunity.  Modern corporate law require for-profit corporations pursue profit expense everything else, many not. understand, it‚Äôs 95% effective keeping symptoms. tested prevent infection. appears could conceivably get vaccinated, get infected virus, spread others. 95% chance would get sick that. that‚Äôs correct, don‚Äôt see reduction masks distancing good idea. Nope insists, first tribe members Indian reservation... Probably we're talking past need get reddit day. people saying solitude old people worse death. Worse death. vaccines literally deployed speak. Can‚Äôt make shit tagged USA headline says Belgium? relevant issue discuss here? huge majority infections either mild asymptomatic, getting infected necessarily mean experiencing significant symptoms. 

It's marketing wank there's reason world right think recovery COVID confer long term immunity vast majority cases. Yet saying get vaccine even already recovered. Why? sell vaccines, I'm guessing. Ironic Florida would critical Italy's treatment covid. Yes. Wait, trying say keeping 1 meter distance washing hands ""strategy"". Oh man that's pretty good. Yeah hit nail head one!

Hey guidelines pretty funny started quarantine kids *living household confirmed infected person* last month! True. super confusing post. resist tear every time see anything related. Dying COVID fucking ugly. want stop seeing it. How'd know? /S What's background ? Like majoring ?  Belgium lockdown. opened stores 2nd februari. social life closed though. Well said. drive truck (a small bread truck still truck lol) could true. lol think people US (and maybe Canada?) refer US ""America"", whereas rest countries ""American"" landmass refer ""America"" single content going Canada way Chile. 

I think that's comment trying reflect: COVID affecting ""America"", defined context. yes wish people social circles would little realistic getting vaccine. think vaccine approved get one next week (none work medical field). tried tell could 4-7 months people like us even begin get brush pessimism. Mind probably hundred million infections. couple handful reinfections bad. help shut god damm support. corps get bailouts millions yeezy trump &amp; co. , illustration research findings coronavirus indoors. Unpopular opinion: distasteful, pragmatic good thing white house staff, senators congresspeople, unfortunately, yes, President vice President priority vaccine.

Regardless disgusted them, fortunately run country, latter January 20th, would problem die hospitalized. combined number blip radar terms vaccine numbers. get infected?! measles-level contagious No, almost chance got Covid someone coughing 20 feet away. feed troll. know Swedish strategy? read guidlines example? Wow that‚Äôs interesting AF anything, mutate less severe form itself, basically become another common cold causing coronavirus. mean state lines kinda joke. Unless committing felony state lines mean little. 

As far armed protection federal officer military personnel full jurisdiction state. Lots tech employees. Twitter said employees work home good now. guess husband feels secure continue would find something else. moving EU job anyway (and may stay there,) lower carrying costs made lot sense. think understand prescribing opiates anything vaccine.

Getting someone addicted opiates profit polar opposite vaccine. vaccine removes threat medical care (so ways pharmaceutical companies would get money you) extremely cheap.

Your doctor involved flu vaccine like would involved COVID vaccine.

Science shows opiates dull pain like science shows vaccine effective. Sure, vaccine would harmful gave 4 gauge needle like opiates harmful stop prescribing them. 2.8 mil Americans die year.

\~350k deaths US due COVID vast majority COVID deaths co-morbidities (80%) 65 years age (80%)

If going reproduce already mutated. hasn‚Äôt mutated enough yet absolutely sure current vaccine isn‚Äôt effective. aren‚Äôt absolutely sure way true either. 

Those giving people promises current vaccine bring us back normal lying. Nobody sort information. Unless create vaccine variants (which possible) people need curb enthusiasm bit. don‚Äôt, 20 million vaccinated 17 days good accomplishment. Yeah, it‚Äôs doable, especially file consent-to-treat forms informal guardianship minor, people seem disinclined larger scale.

I may someday, I‚Äôm caregiver parents.

Try suggesting single parent live friendly couple coparent friend add friend kid family everyone point ways won‚Äôt work. Fair enough. Including sheer number adults can‚Äôt get lives together enough supportive parents, screw interpersonal relationships variety reasons sex addictions money impulsive behavior.
Yet single parent happily date somebody move them/move things implode six months later.

Ha. Need Parentmatch.com.

‚ÄúResponsible adult(s) seeks single parent low drama life fairly okay kid age 1-15 coparent. XZ City. Housing included shared expenses. Negotiable contract renewable three year intervals. Interview mutual family matching process meeting schedule, background checks evaluation forms attached.‚Äù definitely super spreader event.  People would know name Biontech people would use Super hot take. even one year. first official deaths reported March 300k hit early December, looking span 9 months 300k reported deaths. CDC saying worst likely yet come daily death count. Which, conservative estimate based statement gives us 90k new deaths start trending down. say conservative, said expect ~3k plus day next 60-90 days. math 3k 30 days.

My guess would easily 500k+ time get March 2021. Sept

Estimates case count undercount factor 3-20. Given today‚Äôs official case count, good mid range multiplier, looking 50 percent.

The serology tests heard unreliable best, measure antibodies, reduce unmeasurable level bit time, parts immune system like cells take over.

In case, confirmed cases alone almost 20 percent US pop today What‚Äôs confusing like yeah wrong there, affect statement made earlier others said, can‚Äôt really afford worry things long term side effects vaccine long term short term side effects covid shown awful sometimes life threatening That‚Äôs exactly I‚Äôm asking. ask die hard republicans know think happening millions people world wide right deflect, come absolute nonsense, scream democrats. 

I literally can‚Äôt understand it. It‚Äôs like meme gun shoots another guy. Covid guy gun, kills guy chair, says ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt exist didn‚Äôt kill him.‚Äù There‚Äôs lack logic used don‚Äôt even know talk die hard republicans anymore. 

I‚Äôve even nurses tell it‚Äôs lie they‚Äôre working 18 shifts max capacity hospitals. PEOPLE COMING SICK FAKE?! think might change tune proof vaccine mandatory enter sporting events, concerts movie theaters. Copying visibility reply another comment think answers folks questions. I‚Äôm PhD candidate biomedical sciences. Willing answer questions best can! 


This correct. Think like cookie recipe different type chocolate chip used. base recipe already established researchers made ‚Äúchocolate chip‚Äù one specific covid-19. Also ‚Äúrushed‚Äù component explained. researchers funding available making vaccine ever scientists could work faster without worry logistics funding. companies also allowed start producing vaccine large quantities trials completed results published. eliminates time normally exists post trial companies get approval, produce package vaccine distribution. also able get results validated reviewed faster. things normally take long time medicines vaccines. 

There shouldn‚Äôt substantial long term effects type vaccine due work. illicit immune response makes body produce antibodies virus. vaccine ingredients eliminated body. people side effects, mostly due immune response unknown allergy vaccine ingredient, often mild (sore arm, headache, low fever) severe side effects rare. It‚Äôs also important note side effects things also experience get covid rate occurring due infection greater rate occurring due vaccination. 

Additionally know covid lasting effects seem long term surviving patients. obviously don‚Äôt know long last novel virus covid survivors already reporting things like chronic fatigue, heart disease, lasting shortness breath, kidney issues, etc. Compare vaccine trial participants don‚Äôt see symptoms reported. 

Now said monitoring unexpected effects post vaccination rolled large scale. common medication clinical trials 5-10 years approval. wish government would relax instead 7 day, advantage smoothing weekend vs weekday figures get great deal insurance $84/month still spend $5,500 services anything ""free"". **still hasn‚Äôt read article* I‚Äôm thankful living New Orleans. Summer honestly worse stuff outside winter. I've heard brought too. really even want understand point, you?

What I'm saying absolute number infections (33k vs 43k) reflect many people covid directly. able test everyone, people covid able tested shown statistics, mean covid.

It's completely possible currently 50k people Covid, able test 7k people week. test another 60k people next week, 'number infections' go again, **but mean people Covid, people tested positive.** difference seem even WANT understand and/or acknowledge.

That's (and many others, also virologists) say look percentage people tested positive, absolute number. understand I'm saying? Yes no? getting $600 week top one point? CARES act portion ran months ago. zijn te hard g e c r n e e r Let's forget dipshits went way transform panic ignorance meaningful obstruction progress could easily kept silent. Conservatives helped get us here, too. would think want early summer Wrong! It‚Äôs ‚ÄúScIEncE‚Äù! think many states would already shut bars/dining expanded UI still place. Turks Hungarians working Germany American flag, sharing? nice see international teams are. ""We ended (herd immunity)""

*But could mean?*

Sweden apologists keep struggling basic English. right there. We've ended herd immunity. Actually another translation ""we've settled herd immunity"". Turks Hungarians working Germany American flag, sharing? nice see international teams are. ... yeah Idk. today, mate? couldn‚Äôt whole team developed it?? Next. Muslim leaders regional flexibility catholic leaders. I‚Äôm sure, big decisions approved Vatican? systems good points though. Except approval could done faster.

See UK. Netherlands get stimulus check like US. lost 10% income government compensation. Spring ends June 22nd. Ready whole country play tier hokey cokey. point say need anti depressant, don't, could say need vaccine don't. get it? Kids also get tested usually. son 38 fever week, daughter 2 days. wife mild cold symptoms two us got tested, kids (negative), many kids tolerate test. I'm pretty sure would sedate son make test, simply cannot restrain strong 9y old way test potentially dangerous cause trauma. least without medication.

And reason, doc said test kids symptoms one parent positive.

Long story short, available data kids seems least somewhat unreliable.

I'm still angry politicians. closing everything end October big mistake 675,000 terrifying consider much smaller us population back then. Nursing homes ground zero epidemic .. decisions like made?!?!! also way Americans Reddit. Chill bit, comment harmless (I India btw, US) family member hospitalized Covid last week, family member's spouse STILL total denial. vast majority us arent risk, question going vaccinated?  see. realize FDA opened data states even finished assessment. send source that? live different country :) Lol ""conspiracy"" said nothing death coverup

First off, people immediately die virus people get would probably prefer painful experience go through.

Secondly Death Santa Florida pretending science exist reversing lockdown rules virus continues spread like wildfire places actually following lockdown rules etc

What think means Florida people fucks give him? 

You think people getting tested?

Furthermore interest obviously taking virus seriously taking care people state, think he's allowing actual infection numbers sent state?

The way scientists entire home raided officers reporting actual info what's going Florida virus, took computer pointed guns kids. judge approved said raid appointed guess who?

You need anything else another delusional troll swears virus conspiracy??? wasn't, like posting passive-aggressive conservative bullshit. vaccine efforts politicized. could set dangerous precedent scientists can/will pushed around politicians. 

also, think expediting process even would changed much. still enough doses yet...

vaccine development takes years. already cut many corners safe conclusive. ...these people. I'm tired caught tangle lives Thank you, appreciate it. factoring lag reporting deaths. know exactly many people died today weeks later. would mean...birds? side effects kinda bad? case every job, limited medical field. Well said, b*t*ch reference give warm fuzzies, immediate dismissal viewpoint lol comment seems indicate value opinion intelligence much. want pass much judgement single narrow window personality. know he's great guy. best impression that. well certainly bad acted like europe Shoot dik barely qualifies intelligent life Smells like dairy cottage cheese lol! say count?

I'm urging caution course action follows deaths politicians tend use tragedies enact legislation another time palatable. do! üòÉ good hear! Take care! one colleagues (in Michigan) COVID throat swab test last week grateful humans you. wish lot happiness future. Says guy social life scared leave basement LOL. coughing wild minks. History hoax. prove it? Evolution lie too, God created us 80 years ago. Donald Christ born, given us God. fuck people.

Look get it. still care. Fuck. Those. People.  still option. Idk, mother saying scared take rushed was. dad 80s definitely risk. Anti-Vax line mother's personality whatsoever. going take I'd lying said worried. approving faster going make virus go away faster. number doses needed vaccinate general public. cons rushed process pros circumstances. Disclaimer: I‚Äôm pro vaccine fully vaccinated 

Why told get vaccine protect family friends don‚Äôt know stops transmission? I‚Äôll getting ASAP wondering wife two years cable. miss sports that's it. Religion‚Äôs purpose help deal questions/unknowns science can‚Äôt answer yet. 

Science higher power religion questioned beliefs contradict truth. US handling COVID truthers, COVID deniers anti-VAXXERS kid gloves whole pandemic. result 300,000 dead Americans. folks disregarding social distancing guidelines basically murderers.

Belgium article one highest death rates Covid world. understand they‚Äôre facing taking aggressive action save lives. I'm wishing death upon anyone, however people die.

94% covid deaths co morbidities. unfortunate may be, people limited time is.

It unfortunate lives cut short, however risk losing freedoms due politicizing deaths. doesnt shock me

If vaccinate 3/4, enough make covid non issue. There's point disease spreads much, much slower eventually dies WOOOO GO SCIENCE. looking forward getting vaccinated summer, hopefully. know vaccine highly effective. would insane mutation. Since antibody attacks whole spike protein people **can‚Äôt** take vaccine therefore depending can. yeah, matters.  completely false. see eyes daily yet, knew exactly referring despite. Yeah, united States actually united would unstoppable presence. unfortunately see happening within next 20-30 years.

We're kind past rubicon point. Reuniting country likely require extremely aggressive steps look like violent grab power side (policing right wing media, silencing propagandists, social media, etc...)

Because that, progress made immediately undone every single time people continually pumping half population full lies 24/7.

I really wish different, misinformation machines reached self sustaining levels, hope getting past take active steps them. think liberals spine that. we're kind stuck something really, really breaks forces change.

I've watched parents completely consumed right wing media machine conspiracy theorists... despite knowledgeable tons topics, good speaking convincing people things, goddamn kid... can't even make dent them. good argument, thanks. Tbf, they‚Äôre probably coronavirus Intergenerational living. 

I strongly suspect also numbers LA bad, despite strictest longest lockdowns whole country. Millions people, Latinx immigrants/ children immigrants, living multiple generations single household.

Can't socially distance grandma work shift live her. uk rolling review data. us fda not. sure why, think want change processes fear reduce public confidence. would need study virology 10 years even know ingredients interact human biology. first kind used masses. No. work home, protect employees wait herd immunity? get times difficult im America companies employees getting help way majority people treat virus lax say least. understand people wont die. really average joe contracting covid. shielding vulnerable. Nobody wants see unnecessary deaths. I'll take vaccine 1200 bucks mutates, will. virus went snakes, bats, humans, back mammals, back humans. 

We really idea end result, hence novel virus. uninsured person who's feeling unwell go toa hospital check treatment free?

Of course ‚ÄúIn disturbing side note, recent Gallup poll found political divide: 50% Republicans willing get COVID-19 vaccine, compared 75% Democrats.‚Äù

Two reasons
1. government currently run pathological liar inherently reduces people‚Äôs trust.
2. Many republicans still think virus hoax numbers inflated. think vaccines solution problem don‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs really quite sad. took awhile find too. looked wondered AstraZeneca provide confidence interval half-dose full-size regime. go original paper, variables a,b,c,d number vaccinate patients, number unvaccinated, number infected vaccinated group unvaccinated group. 

The standard error natural log odds ratio root inverse variables. So, either positive cases either vaccinated group control, standard error high. 

A vaccine shows 100% efficacy defined interval. 

AstraZeneca 30 cases control 3 vaccinated. That's enough control low amount vaccinated group 90% efficacy estimate high level uncertainty. need cases groups. effective vaccine takes longer positive cases vaccinated group, takes longer demonstrate high level effectiveness. course don‚Äôt. didn‚Äôt study become virologist don‚Äôt years Facebook medical research. know power money corrupt science.  smell surrounds \*bun anan unanana nununun\* I‚Äôm pro vaccine I‚Äôm bit lost something. keep hearing public health doctors say Ireland vaccine silver ballet merely tool fight corona. Isn‚Äôt whole point vaccine end pandemic? Sucks hear:( hope guys able differ us citizens guys charge... gf works medical mental health ward state prison. boss, Doctor, take vaccine ""it enables government track you, rise Marxism America want tracked"". honestly believes this, someone PHD. doctor America, still believe conservative conspiracy theories. insane me.  Taking vaccine life high risk age 28 pandemic ravaging everybody noticeable way..and feeling like ""I got nothing else lose....might well try save myself"" alot different feeling completely fine....worked entire year nonstop busy workplace multiple coworkers got everyone quarantined one person 200 got sick sick basically roll eyes everytime someone gets half staff quarantine screw business 5th time everyone comes back fine every single time....and chance dying .0 something percent 60-70 yrs old. 

Yes...if living pandemic watching coworkers friends getting badly sick dying age ans reality SEE exleirince...I would gladly take chance it. case..I worked 9 months high volume work place ...dealt 6 7 full quarantines Job...and nobody got sick died...and feel fine. im right working ....why would willfully inject shit put risk massive side effects could happen road? makes sense. Unless thing mutates going fine going sample size one small used without redoing phase 3 centered around dosing regimen we're going reward anti maskers fuck everyone right thing smell ass around you! without worry

Just clear, still transmit virus. vaccine avoid critical symptoms. technically, still social distance someone vaccinated, otherwise, could catch (and potentially get ill/die)

We need 80% population vaccinated actual herd immunity. hard time believing we'll get number without laws/forcing people like think wildlife this. fuck anyone think wild animals *wouldn't* already infected? I'm sure millions animals already it. they?! America divided education Fuck it, let's bring polio back. supposedly 6 vaccines eventually rolled onto market. Perhaps eventually get past booster shot stage time goes on. speculation happens though. around 16 million confirmed cases 328 million people US gives us 16/328 = .05 5 percent, 20 percent. 

Please don‚Äôt speak confidently don‚Äôt know basic arithmetic Democrats made deal Pfizer make sure use ship vaccines. knew Donald Trump loved tuna wanted make sure never got tuna again. vaccine doesnt prevent transmission, means wont kill already vaccinated

youll still probably get little sick aquire virus, shelter place less needed virus almost died out.

With anti vaccine folk u.s. might able go maskless gather long time unfortunately STILL SPREAD VIRUS GETTING VACCINATED.  Whats going there? thought Biontech collaboration Chinese firm. Aren‚Äôt gonna get HK too? [Here's everyone stock big mask looking right unnecessary dig Americans dumb you? think people past didn‚Äôt take vaccine didn‚Äôt trust it? idiot, took it‚Äôs fucking pandemic. Also, people trusted vaccines 1900s, fuck makes think medical developments we‚Äôve it‚Äôs untrustworthy? Keep going around spreading disease braindead idiot evidence yet it‚Äôs less deadly per se; contagious.   That‚Äôs works. 5% shows hospital contracted window time, manageable situation, number, whatever is, goes quickly. number matters right hospitalizations relative staffed bed capacity. numbers improve, easing restrictions happen. People pretending acting restrictions dont apply them, prolong date. expect Moderna vaccine start approved around world? sister healthcare worker outpatient setting part large hospital system Virginia. sent email last week asking would interested vaccine (immediately, point time, never). prioritization list, seems good number people working higher risk roles turned down, found morning receiving vaccine week. seems process working expected. hope people start see stories like believe process. sounds like conspiracy rant. Yes, need evidence could even prevent covid numbers getting out. 

Testing rates Florida CA really aren‚Äôt different. 500 vs 700 100,000 pop. Meanwhile EU - oh vaccine could save thousands lives? Let‚Äòs better wait weeks translate instructions maltese... scan passport every time enter western country. automatically runs number internal databases queries various information. There's reason one databases include COVID vaccinations.

The coordination standards could problematic insurmountable hurdle. History Channel going bonkers well Learning Channel even National Geographic Discovery channel starting lean way final nail coffin cable TV us. fine without cable almost 8 years now. least guys getting something.
In M√©xico getting dime, anything prices everything went up. Depends. country least prioritizing exposed workers, high risk individuals elderly. common public get mass vaccinated summer / fall next year perhaps? Make deck cards costume party perfect fit. 2012, released study estimated around 280k deaths due Swine Flu, 15x amount official deaths. 2 years Swine Flu ‚Äúover‚Äù.

You could argue better capacity count now, reality won‚Äôt know weeks means. Wonder net effect human intelligence pandemic have. 

In theory, go up. Actually, attacked line argument. attacked character comment.

Obviously issues work through. Sorry them. particular redditor I'm responding exact redditor I'm quoting. I'm sure else call it.

The Nordic cooperation makes great media story (‚Äúhaha look stupid fuckers asking help‚Äù) that‚Äôs cooperation. past summer Stockholm flew ICU patients countries since excess capacity. 

It‚Äôs open secret hospital staff underpaid (save senior positions) there‚Äôs churn employees good year. don‚Äôt doubt COVID made worse; course has, context numbers would helpful. 
Same goes ICU usage; they‚Äôre meant run certain capacity - don‚Äôt doubt COVID made much worse, context would helpful. 

Of course, feel free downvote rawr-rawr stupid US conservatives, it‚Äôs really disappointing journalism crap here. might stupid question but...
When friend covid doc told stay away dog dogs get covid. dogs get disease isn‚Äôt dangerous trained pups? tell it. got one kids private school work in. hands feet, low grade temperature whole week work. thing is, agree seems reasonable. always prefer telling truth, least staying quiet.

The best solution imo would tell truth dramatically, wartime-style ramped production masks. would never latter (neoliberalism), second best solution would tell truth rather say nothing all, say sure (which basically truth well). course, either, ideology demands ""expertise"". mean ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù?

A rushed vaccine; thanks gets upper hand...it is! ‚Äúeverything‚Äù keep people safe would open That's literally 20,000 per day per state, reality, Texas/California/NY/etc would way 20k per day per state hypothetical beause population. 

Rhode Island 1 million residents total would need far less per day keep pace werent articles asked drs vaccine said wasnt good, didnt time enough tests give green light. forgot save article, ever since then, ive sketchy vaccine. cure something thats almost around yr cant find vaccine something else. read someone's sarcastic comment took mean they're ""intimidated""?

I saw nothing wrong comment, apart sarcasm.

When uni, unfortunately many people less employable degrees convinced job would directly lead well paid career. uni well known well subscribed English degrees, unfortunately many English students spoke thought they'd get journalist jobs major papers

There's many jobs many degrees like that, even engineering students convinced degrees would instantly land job, that's far case either wait European Medical Agency? seen old man year now, I'm hoping vaccine let travel Australia soon. Bold assume identity politics bullshit subside within year Respiratory here...

Children Amy smaller lungs breathe 2x often don't? relevant mention race scientist? like social/political propaganda? I'm truly happy great scientist making magnificent work covid-19 vaccine, feels like take advantage situations feed society bias arguments, like woman scientist, African American scientist, gay/lesbian,.... praise accomplishments, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation relevant professional accomplishments. scientist loves work, driven better, better Yes that‚Äôs called cell phone. hell getting information?

They rolling tho, germany rest europe still waiting! right, german vaccine german people first rest. got benefits others one providing possibilities! 

And say non german came Peet T√ºll, former head National Board Health Welfare's infection control unit, job state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell took T

Again again, cut rest answer? aggressive keeping high risk old people ICU's. explains ICU survival rate much higher countries. tons australian articles making claims ""herd immunity strategy"" etc

I'm sure else call it. vaccination, options? herd immunity, either ""nothing see here"", ""fuck it, we'll live"". kinda sad ironic fat unhealthy Americans want it. Like, guys think better individual level? non-Swede living Sweden, think whatever faults (and quite some) approach had, least come place malice hatred towards citizens. Many Philippines (where born) resorting picking food scraps markets trash bins desperate scavenge often beaten police, worse forced sex acts them.

One news outlets pointed Sweden failed therefore stuff think right: sick leave, parental leave, unemployment welfare, self-checkout systems groceries (companies would afraid shoplifters Philippines), contactless payments thrown discussion too. disgusting nothing thing everyone now. analogy, woman tubes tied would still take birth control? man vasectomy, would still need wear condom contraception? 

Like vasectomy, vaccine high efficacy. protocols still? still catch spread virus, need protocols forever protect can‚Äôt vaccinated. catch spread highly contagious respiratory illness vaccine, moving population forever. else protect vulnerable people? herd immunity. lot people sounds like ""Can believe black woman something remarkable!?"" must understand criticism. Still one thousand per year statistically normal, seeing 4 cases within two month period? draw line though? Who's say employable worth money isn't?

Engineering sciences clearly lead onto job. Media studies? History? Art? Much less likely make career it, mean they're valuable society. Would nice repeat roaring 20‚Äôs, ya know, without shitty part end. distance &amp; others, air systems used. restaurants. countries, 'normal' pandemic circumstances, I'd agree except time on-its-way- out-administration shown deserve first access vaccine. Eventually, maybe, way first line.  


Not actively working over/almost 300,000+ deaths citizens, could avoided proper action, information, leadership. one slap face citizens truly awful administration. Sounds like chose live here.

Not sure people would honestly.

I actually polled friends ""when last time felt genuinely proud country""

Not single person could remember time beyond ignorant children... country genuinely sucks compared developed countries. vaccine talking ? We've trying stop/contain spread mid-march, slow infections much possible. Starting prepare vaccinations start Jan. way, demand normalcy now. think Spring social end mid summer medical/social end combo. thing all, old CT scans used radiation. don‚Äôt know precisely.

I know long-term heart damage normal flu. even die recovering flu. normal flu. also know pneumonia cause including Spanish seasonal flus, Covid, also cause long term damage lungs. know that‚Äôs meant Yeah believe chances getting high make sound like half population going get true. never made sense. front line worker I'm getting mine week I'm pretty excited tbh. Younger, healthy young people dying, lower rate still happening. Middle aged becoming debilitated well. low numbers mean current virus growth become problem. one person getting symptoms life tragedy. 

I see saying, realllly need humanity solid start caring one another. 

I referring U.S., absolutely bias considering idiotic countrymen makes say this? There's absolutely indication elected position relative wealth income factored triage vaccine distribution. salty healthcare workers, elderly, high-risk individuals receive inoculation do? appears trying make pictures viable riders row followed rules. already NZ's proof hard lockdowns work

China Vietnam well. isolated islands like NZ. US lucky 45+% population gets influenza vaccine every year. two highest prevalence vaccination age groups remain children 17 (~60%) adults 65+ years (~65%). Sweden like UK compared European nations really shitty health care system pandemic. Nations universal health care single payer system much better.  Spanish flu contagious regular flu? regular flu practically nonexistent year conditions 'rona still growing. like V-day! would prefer comment removed vs banned this, feel someone say point:

Fuck them. refuse take measure society get rid virus seriously, go fuck mothers.

That all. Prove it. It‚Äôs still different today. We‚Äôve got millions potential sources bullshit easy far reaching platforms. sometimes pro wrestling hopeful people come around vaccine well continue spread, likelihood continues increase mutation arises defeats benefit vaccine. Even vaccine 95% effective, thats broadly speaking true everyone well. Social media reason people divided. seems mainly new variant spread faster original variant?, List countries approved Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine chronological order:

1. Britain

2. Canada

3. Bahrain

4. Mexico

5. America

6. Kuwait

7. Singapore average age death Spanish flu? matters ton. Also excess mortality percentages look like 1918?  Loosen tin-foil hat bit, good circulation brain. People want assume every variant zombie apocalypse variant. Here's actual full context quote. guys terrible manipulating quotes try prove reports new variant 60 local authority areas, believed similar found countries last months.

He literally cut quote mid sentence ellipses basically reverse meaning sentence. Read articles. since provided sources, i'm going i'm seeing comment  clusterfuck. guy charge power resources secure enough doses. half country vaccinated put huge dent things sure, it‚Äôs enough return normalcy. Yes. vaccines disembarking. 4 year old same, wear mask, come eat know well stays play time. Honestly though children don‚Äôt argue masks, it‚Äôs adults issues wearing them. Michael Bay produced COVID movie came We‚Äôll find soon enoufh Waiting horrid nightmare end. feel like there‚Äôs nothing look forward anymore. Apparently highly unlikely respond vaccine  Breathing exercises help high anxiety. Try meditation too. Life expectancy around 30-40 point, would much fewer old people fatality ratio would lower. US, I'm hearing stories around Netherlands. I'm amazed.. Well, it‚Äôs propaganda message pushed immunity. it‚Äôs often pushed way. overall mortality rate much less relevant age-specific mortality rate. Child mortality, much shorter elderly phase life really skewed overall morality rates. Mortality rates range average victim haven‚Äôt changed much.

Our gains overall mortality childhood mortality, keeping seniors alive sick.

This article written Biden‚Äôs new Covid advisor, doctor bioethicist, (written pre-Covid times relevant ever) think conflating seasonal flu Spanish flu. Different flus different risks. aren‚Äôt same. thought border closed countries type non-essential travel. didn‚Äôt learn Flu 1918 school Buy house dig bunch holes backyard. It'll give Fido something do. Daycares open essential workers' kids, force people work home. thing happened earlier year causing lot people struggle work. expect workload increase kids, share burden bit. people don‚Äôt want informed, completely wasting time I‚Äôve found old navy kids masks work best tiny two year old. ears adjustable face folded style shapes face. ears pretty floppy sometimes pops off, I‚Äôve using behind head clips help that. Dooooooommmmm No. sounds like friend confused. ""all steve jobs movies"" gave chuckle isn‚Äôt bigger news? vaccines brand new. Nobody assume make 100% immune COVID, especially complicating health issues. 

If vaccine works, get sick COVID, jury's still whether could carry enough virus contagious. 

So we'll need keep wearing masks awhile. That's double negative, seems actually saying *will* go away still option buy them. New normal crew... favorite band Sometimes dumb people think going die. Except can't even conversation coronavirus think wearing mask think shouldn't. Right bat there's friction.  Neither taxes bar shows percentage population vaccinated line percentage assumed provide herd immunity. young healthy don‚Äôt need vaccine FDA peer-reviewed? Thank you. 
That's good way summarizing it. 

Seriously also lots things love U.S also plenty room improvement. true Netherlands.
Sometimes point something negative get ""just go home"" response. really easy, like said. moved different country massive effort. really plan considering it. 

It kind heartbreaking. moved people nice friendly. Everywhere went people asked background seemed genuinely interested. something American independent spirt love last years gotten harder harder connect people. south people afraid anything foreign.

I'm wondering better option? heard place allowing restaurants stay open, guidelines place - including bar seating, liquor/beer sales, must close 10 PM. way, restaurants could still open serve food. However, think lot places make ton money bar, right?

Don't tell leaving everything open letting people make choices right answer. governor already tried times people prove make bad decisions. brother works bar downtown location cases COVID weekly local joints. People close long, especially drinking.

Some bars restaurants going governors order reopening. wholeheartedly feel want able make money again, see online arrogant purposefully wearing masks following guidelines hurts brain. would think still try good person try ""safe"" prove could reopen safely... sort makes think maybe governor right shut places dine-in... ugh.

What's state doing? working? ideas would safe would allow places make money? governor making best decision? Obviously lot opinion. I'm curious. One reason go. thought remove anyone wearing mask...

If data right 100% population would already. random Internet stranger excited you!! Stay safe thank you‚Äôve done.  hopefully bit impact, think party existed W's tenure long gone. say ""might"" actually make assumptions. positive though holier-than-though attitude comes across loud clear daily interactions. come sub get validated. This. wife teacher told real morons teaching I'm troll? Get real. I'm pandemic denier like you. Enjoy living ass backwards state. We're never going achieve real equality long point race everything. kinda condescending. works converted covid clinic (almost entire hospital covid beds now) high priority Glad hear kind news. ABC mentioned 6:30 pm news yesterday shipment escorted US Marshals security reasons. I'm sure stupid xenophobic, even split: fly Vietnam instead? way cheaper, weather comparable, they've defeated pandemic.

I live Canada hate winter months too, going Florida point sounds like one self-destructive things warrant intervention loved ones. Oh agree I'm trying pessimistic. I'm optimistic we'll back normal summer. expect start chaotic given probably largest vaccination programme history pfizer said hardest one covid vaccines terms storage distribution. imagine Moderna vaccines get approved alot smooth sure background member several minority groups, know personally happiness inspiration representation brought long time. never thought couldn‚Äôt something seeing great thing. So, bars restaurants still open, can't knee replacements?

Cool wish knew. I'm hoping sort article released soon discusses logistics this. many doses Pfizer produce per day/week? prioritizing distribution throughout world? distribution affected concurrent holiday shopping season? Etc. Yes exactly better healthcare means don‚Äôt need panicking much. 

Like old days relatively minor flesh wound could life threatening, cause major concern, longer is. Keep trolling then, guy! 
I reconnected ex bf Snapchat. started chatting. said,

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like hang I‚Äôm waiting COVID vaccine.‚Äù

‚ÄúB*tch, what? You‚Äôre gonna get vaccine?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck lol.‚Äù 

I blocked that. took disrespectful: 

1.	Why ‚Äúb*tch‚Äù term endearment ridicule? Intimate repressive?
2.	Belittling life choices rather engage conversation opportunities. thinks vaccine dangerous say express concern choice may cause harm?

Been wondering ever since whether overreacted though. maybe eliminated one person life could changed view. first person get USA? general unemployment insurance. Basically year worked past, get 1 month unemployment benefit, roughly 70% normal pay (capped roughly 3k per month). go welfare, paid much lower. cases, need keep trying find new job, otherwise benefits could cut.  Still pretty much normal. Went see Croods mask sight. Surprisingly good movie too. Muscles ass? feel you. Herculean task year, balancing kids, work life general. hope lockdown time prevent longer lockdown, let's hope extended.  
 
Good luck new baby! sincerely hope grandparents help soon possible. Well ex-president Bush going live still means anything party... US giving away/selling unused doses.

These vaccines cost nothing compared economic relief packages already passed, additional relief packages necessary, monetary tools used. (To put perspective, 100m doses cost $2 billion. 0.1% 2 trillion stimulus package.)

There ZERO reason order much every vaccine anybody would willing sell us, even mean ordering enough doses billion people, country 250 million vaccine-eligible people. don‚Äôt want see one those, I‚Äôll orgasm everytime see number go up. Ok antimasker still would though? people would wear mandate, able see numbers. ‚ÄúThose *watch* History doomed believe aliens.‚Äù EU joke. even order anything like enough Pfizer vaccine time, probably real reason delayed. backed wrong horse, instead backing all, like UK USA. ‚ÄúOur primary aim work find effective treatments,‚Äù said study author Kenneth Baillie , University Edinburgh clinical researcher investigator GenOMICC Consortium , explores associations genes critical illness. research, published recently journal Nature , aligns earlier reports also found variants genetic makeup critically ill patients. ‚ÄúA chunk answer genes‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs unlikely single element fully responsible development severe covid-19,‚Äù study author Sara Clohisey, researcher University Edinburgh, pointed out. researchers plan continue analyze DNA samples coronavirus patients ‚Äî severely ill intensive care, also people milder symptoms. (Summary) don‚Äôt think monetary gain important life. also don‚Äôt believe one life better another. Peoples friends family members ripped away forever virus. know 27 year old guy died left behind wife three boys. You‚Äôre right. won‚Äôt ever see way. Sometimes wish time machine could show people from, like, 1995 posts tweets shit 2020 try figure mean. like half doses held back unnecessarily second doses, instead vaccinating double amount people immediately first doses waiting second doses come later.

That seems like good idea practice, can't mobilize second dose proper time table people? Remember, US still even ordered enough doses vaccinate even half population yet. think happening across many RNA viruses - including Dengue, Zika, etc. - rather SARS-CoV-2-specific phenomenon. 8% high fuck. Every 50 people cross, 4 currently COVID. 

Thats including ones gotten tested due asymptomatic. serious? 600,000 MASSIVE chunk US population back then. world coronavirus, 99.9% survivable, worse something clearly killing lot young folks?

You people different breed, like want tragic every indicator points opposite direction. said many times. Heck, one family sick since kid stopped going school. Vaccines arrival late general public seeing many people state mid summer earliest general public maybe June Essential workers. Nobody wants reduce human interaction zoom. Sorry agree, also context, [mortality rate 1 40 turn century 1 140 [Infectious diseases also now. 

Additionally, United States, [22,000 people died Flu last feel like number matters lot look 300k deaths covid year. Alright, I'm getting incredibly frustrated. know come sooner ONE answering simple question.

How get vaccine? 

I live New York City

Do need make appointment? walk in? locations? health care worker? work mental health counselor Community Based Organization. know count essential worker (though still going office twice week) need show work ID? Like..... what's deal? scouring news can't find simple answer question. Make Lack Capitalization. vaccine developed finished end March. rest process trials, approval, etc. expedited looking info, plans raw material generated St Louis facility, purified Andover facility, fill finished Michigan facility also serve distribution hub. right sites completely active fitted new technology. majority drug product made Belgium manufacturing site already set mRNA production probably used generated clinical lots. I'm loop definition ""doses"" used media. approved vaccines date require 2 shots, 2 doses, 1 dose? words, media cites 100m doses, actually saying treat 50m people getting total 100m shots, 100m people receiving total 200m shots? People died rate 1918 advances technology, advances technology would also facilitated spread 1918 pandemic. Commercial aviation really thing cars still infancy. People largely interacted lived near. ravaged world due WWI, still would spread significantly modern transportation. There's consider. We're lot globally connected now. built world optimal fast spreading. reread comment. We‚Äôre going buy first two. AndAZ JJ still track try keep masses people going places once. course work what's going happen leaked. It‚Äôs even broken basket it‚Äôs taking longer get data necessary approval. get approved end January assuming get trial readout US. 

And vaccines purchased still good  thank information! \^THIS Geez cant wait next one apocalypse larp Teeth big ? That's happens essentially support government global pandemic/crisis. pandemic merely shown US rest world corrupt, ineffective, misguided US government is/has been, least on-the-way-out-administration's handling government pandemic.  


Massive amounts money funneled massive corporations almost none going businesses people truly need (certainly enough make meaningful difference 9 damn months counting), lack factual information, *purposeful spread misinformation*, near complete lack leadership guidance, topped far many citizens ~~doing nothing correctly keep anyone else safe~~ going way engage reckless dangerous behaviour anyone around them.... ? Anyone could seen coming, many did, enough did. fact US tragedy could easily avoided hellish knowledge have. 


It breaks heart see monumentally US government failed citizens. I'm sorry repetition enough renders near speechless, can't get it. :( 


P.S. I'm expecting comment get deleted mods, apparently okay comment honestly what's happening right front us. :( general operation warp speed called that. day mission begins fast assumptions.

I bet worse compared 100 years ago.

Why?

We elderly people now. think people older 70 years exception century ago.

Most casualties age group. alive time. mean anything them. It‚Äôs high sure. total population that‚Äôs still 8% it‚Äôs still unlikely get it... that‚Äôs say shouldn‚Äôt still distancing isolating don‚Äôt like exaggeration it‚Äôs going on. Maybe we'll start seeing counters state state &amp; country vaccine numbers? used wrong term, doesnt mean wrong Good thing I‚Äôve stocking cannabinoids boss idiot? wish people would seriously dwell number cases occurred vaccine recipients

It's hard understand rigor Phase 3 trials. rigor causes dilution knowledge gives you.

The number Moderna much different.

8 illnesses (appropriately documented, hard) happened people got vaccination. really want draw conclusions severity illness 8 known cases? doubly true COVID, know affects people tremendous inconsistency. Last checked, 300,000 Americans hadn‚Äôt died 2020 ‚Äúalcohol consumption‚Äù. lack foresight astonishing Governments capable departments incapable others. don‚Äôt understand almost nobody works government motivated much money brings in. Conversely, usually motivated much department spends. know worked government. also motivated careers. government isn‚Äôt business. 

They easily motivated much donors earn host corrupt things though. numbers we‚Äôre headed... Exactly. Nevermind. probably proved wrong downplaying already, either ignored stats moved goalposts. Oh well, like said, hope right ends big deal. Half million excess deaths USA might suggest otherwise, cares numbers. Keep holding covid potential danger level getting hit lightning. Keep head sand! Cable TV dead end technology, pony boomers havn't bothered cancel it. TV channels filling lineup cheap filler since one cares anyways Separate trials run US. requirement X number people infected covid determine compairson vaccinated placebo groups. trials halted US 5 weeks sign enough people initially still trying get enough data submit approval. waive expectation care making stupid decision. think risky, risk. get 150 million half country whether want not. Dang bruh. Now, ever, need compassion fellow citizens. people simply luxury putting life hold wait return normalcy. 

In last 9 months, I've learned together sense adrift sea without sight land (yet). us yachts speedboats, us cruise liner, many us homemade rafts. throwing buckets water people's vessel's going get land quicker, going sink ships. Idk science says I've consuming fuckton weed since march gotten covid üëÄ can't imagine hellish assisted living (especially elderly care) must past months - residents employees. I'm really glad hear near first line, friend. I'd say like there's fraction causing needless death suffering people chosen place next life. People people. matter location. Mask compliance high Portsmouth, believe said many places Rockingham county though. Compliance noticeably low simply go outskirts Portsmouth. downtown, compliance high. Rim shot rim job? city, yesterday: one vaccinated 

My city, today: people getting vaccinated 

Feels pretty good! north korea seems survive famine season every year, maybe they've got pointers ""Normal mutation practically impact much"" get clicks tho Hey little confused CDC guidelines couple coronavirus one two weeks test negative one still tests positive one tested negative go back work? I'm reading guidelines correctly says can. able spread sick spouse people even antibodies?  Enough time passed even remote idea could possibly happen future. That's exactly U.S. though. I'm regular citizen illusions getting vaccine year. do, great, absolutely expect to. Birds worrying, mammals. list stupidly skewed reason. Good thing we've skipped system time. don‚Äôt seem know everything. I‚Äôm stupid you. welcome. Glad help. exactly definitely patterns could helpful general population spotted signs easily actually opposite. 62% real trials people accidently gave half doses initially 90% category. They're considering re-running trials half initial doses. Wait hears mobile phones. get shot get stop wearing masks? Ah, 'deal rejection' another orange-man-bad fear mongering story. Good know. really, vast majority us even sick first place. I've screaming stupidity the, ""flatten curve"" rhetoric since day 1. always terrible messaging even extent made sense ever meant first step. First flatten curve... crush it. fact vast majority US (including majority here) seem think 30,000 hospitalizations 1000 deaths day GOAL absolutely horrifying. thus country go losing shit 2 Ebola infections thinking 365,000 deaths day success story? People always disappoint. Fake lines change I'm sure many think vaccination free pass go mask less attend gatherings. Businesses probably feel way employees vaccinated. go use cell phone 24/7 tracked parties think.... Even people get may spread it, Pfizer CEO said unknown prevent spread symptoms. definitely think much laughing stock redditor touts conspiracy theories thinks walk beach 80 degree weather. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre familiar though, seem like type guy wear shirt beachüòÇ. Btw, keep chasing UFO‚Äôs, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs relevant cause use time on.  earth would nursing home even think good idea pandemic???????? can‚Äôt people listen????? Yes, time next month would suspect death and/or hospitalization per case rate way down, whether cases actually are. Yup! 
They averaging 40K tests/day. 
Now they're averaging 12K tests 3K positives day.

Positivity went 37% 28%. true positivity rate might bit higher people without symptoms getting tested. tests restrictions u needed negative test travel, inclined get test even u living bubble. country lockdown! :( guy wants purge favelas. Covid work him. mentally disabled person think somehow use willpower masks stop fucking cold virus think people get somehow morally deficient. true mental defective. think 1% need US approval get vaccine people elsewhere world already it? Anywhere aside maybe Florida Yeah idea things would‚Äôve different without last existing fragment hateful, uncaring, sociopathic soul.

So, correct. big loss, right? Let old fuckers die. run. Fuck 'em. Trust science scientific trials shown vaccine safe. Penso fosse una battuta Mixed acid rain, yes.

Is get naked dancing zombie chicks? fucking stupid, waiting going change chemical makeup vaccine. you‚Äôre willing take it, take soon can. Honestly people looking ""ammunition"" mentally ill would find ""evidence"" support whatever crazy ass shit wanted believe like, told believe whatever insane sources have. great day Canada, therefore world. Confirmation take, ""SWIM"" type diversion?

We'll never know. adding 1% per week immune group right Germany, nearly number dying people per day.

We lockdown next month least, still I'd expect bit leaders, although know US planning many manufacturers, official numbers Biontech&amp;Pfizer. 1918 one. seem know everything. Typical moron.

Seems like trouble reading comprehension basic math, 99.9% 0.1%. too, looking 1 - 2 years published results need confidence now. knew Santa. Fauci said natural immunity. thought vaccines prevented getting sick dying. still get infected spread. true?
Anyone got info this? divided though? 

I‚Äôve meet single person won‚Äôt take it.

Let‚Äôs count crazies 1/2 population. Finally someone thinking children. ""rights' infringed upon largely going unenforced, majority working class people ignoring rules feel like rights violated since they're still able please aside bars restaurants really. 

The class business owners feel rights violated violation somewhat enforced collectively balls storm Garcetti's office house demand things change. wonder is... hmmm... atom bomb super friendly. links telling Sweden, like every country planet wishes achieve herd immunity. goal ever country? mean claim Sweden going 'herd immunity strategy' ever country similar polices also same? vaccinate teachers next. idea hard teaching chemistry without circulating room? wear surgical + KN95 help kids still could easily spread I'm sanitizing constantly properly (double) masked up. circulate, would fail. millions people ""at risk"" still avoiding virus themselves. Lots 40-year-olds good health get fucked weeks even months illness. incredibly ignorant think magically minority Americans immunity. silico mutagenesis human ACE2 protein translational efficiency explain SARS-CoV-2 infectivity different species Yes vaccine actually 100% effective preventing severe symptoms absolute game changer. course data limited I‚Äôm sure people get severely ill, data like extremely promising. Literally year grad school level biology would teach ingredients interact body.

If going make effort understand get critical can't understand it. perfectly capable going thousands free online biology courses reading scientific literature order understand even google every single word.  Fast-paced.... Thr packaging take fast food survive covid around 3 days. packaging grocery items. 

Now, viral load enough get sick. Thats debate. 

I still take time wipe down. settles then, thank you. want wait longer

It clear better use 28, 35, 42 days instead 21

25% placebo bad choice fast results Yeah, death rate per 100k people 1918 flu 655. COVID would kill 2.16 million Americans equal that. taken telescopic lens flatten image make crowding appear far worse actually is. common manipulative technique that's used decades. Fair enough might convince people unfortunately bunch won‚Äôt convinced. Personally put faith published results watching someone take vaccine. Unpopular opinion: whenever shutdown happens, elected officials put place temporarily lose income set stimulus. Thanks. I‚Äôll check out. ""This shot might turn Spiderman.""

I get wanting straight direct people, already skeptical person actively telling feel puts defensive posture get go.
 
Just craft title nothing facts.
 
e.g.: *Pfizer COVID Vaccine: Incidents Bells Palsy Consistent Expected Rate*  feel way. times trouble, really see people pretenses down. Sometimes good. seen ugly things fair number people can't unsee them. agree. Yeah need build public trust, given times, FDA could lied expedite approval everything would fine lives would saved.

The original FDA process wasn‚Äôt specifically designed scenarios think rules bent depending results clinical trials. Mom teacher 34 years public school. even pretend kids don‚Äôt spread illness even pre Covid absurd. Parents send kids school anything get house. parents like sister, taught young kids answer Covid screening questions. say allergies sneeze cough always say don‚Äôt travel. Yet go everywhere. 

But yeah Economy jazz.. cares School Staff every family America needlessly exposed virus. know, kids need routine social interaction mental health growth. didn‚Äôt anything try mitigate that, dumped teachers made write lesson plans person virtual learning, rearrange classrooms figure usual budget thoughts prayers. went shit said fuck it, open schools won‚Äôt fund you. buried information saying ‚Äúhey terrible idea‚Äù made myth kids can‚Äôt spread sent way. 

You know what‚Äôs also traumatic kids? Students Teachers, Parents Janitors dying ‚Äúthe flu‚Äù justify reopening economy. Land opportunity dreams, didn‚Äôt even try mitigate risk. threw everyone‚Äôs life line name personal causes, said fuck thy neighbor. We‚Äôll hear years come bad fucked ourselves, only, someone told us take seriously... NY ICU nurse Sandra Lindsay made history :)

She joins ranks Margaret UK! USA historically accept data generated countries. previously argued US population different enough (racial mix, obesity etc) nations' data may prove efficacy. Asian candidates trialed mostly Brazil, Latin America etc, would eligible apply FDA unless something changes. division... Thanks answering question. shit denmark.

According recent poll, 88 % nurses considering changing jobs.

Blame politicians new public management-cronies underpaying overworking vital workers.

A hospital copenhagen recently paid 250.000 dkk bonuses. Every fucking crown went middle managers. None doctors nurses risking lives us.

Shameful. mean brag medical degree Bill Gates has.. .. person many allergies reactions approve message. discussing systematic drugs cause significant shifts bodies mechanisms. Synthetic drugs. would point vaccine caused long term effects. old vaccines adjuvants preservatives caused effects. vaccine adjuvants. would point towards something could potentially cause long term issues vaccine. drugs entirely different. pointed drug take every day. created serum equilibrium blood. always drug present effects compound build time.

It's like:

CONGRATULATIONS!! Due government people able make right moves keep thins control large personal sacrifices... get KEEP MAKING SACRIFICES, governments/people get act together, get get rewarded behavior getting vaccine need undergo even less hardship bunch babies\* can't follow fairly simple instructions! Yup. Seems fair.

\*note: *people* hard struck areas babies... governments either point hard struck areas. Yep, say disease.

Imagine Ebola longer incubation period - AIDS spread airborne. Let's face it. stage 98 people, lost cause point. Mask mask, it'll spread event indoors significant length time. administer flu shots country every year. past two years I've walked local pharmacy, filled forms got shot. appointment needed, every pharmacy country give it.

Because storage requirements, logistics problem. appointment probably required. However enough people qualified give shot country. kids public school cases far. treat individual class pod entrance classroom (the old fire escape door), require masks, limited class sizes 20, spacing desks, staggered recess breaks minimize contact amongst pods. 

So far worked really well. sick policy strict teachers really want move back virtual classrooms they're enforcing strictly. üéµIt's worst day since yesterday excerpt:

## Protective measures

In humans, randomised trials patients viral upper respiratory tract infections shown mask wearing reduces viral droplet Furthermore, masks found reduce inhalation Several epidemiological studies indicated mask wearing social distancing measures reduce severity Additionally, use masks shown laboratory setting reduce disease transmission severity SARS-CoV-2 infection case series humans comparing three transmission clusters different degrees social distancing showed differences outcome severity Differences social practices living conditions lead variation inoculum may partly explain discrepancies case fatality rates countries.

The relation inoculum size infection severity clear public health implications. northern hemisphere enters winter time spent confined spaces, important emphasise separation measures mask wearing, ventilation, social distancing may reduce spread virus also disease severity. Even imperfect adherence measures likely beneficial.

A question remains open relative contribution droplet versus aerosol Although measures screens face shields intercept droplets, less likely reduce aerosol transmission poorly ventilated spaces. approach eliminate risk, prioritising measures effective reducing substantial viral transmission events enables balance managing covid-19 pandemic allowing society continue function.

Although current high number cases alarming, lower fatality rate sign public health measures success protecting vulnerable, well potentially reducing disease severity people infected. Ensuring adherence control measures reduce viral exposure critical minimising severity pandemic, particularly given severe harm caused hard lockdown. don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs cases humans yet. Bird flu transmitted fecal matter human contraction rather rare. Human human transmission unbelievably rare. 

Also FDA approved vaccine H5N1 (bird flu/avian influenza). don‚Äôt think something particular worry about, even think outbreak US 2015. state sets priorities &amp; procedures.

What personally seen employers go state health department apply early-phase doses. state tells employer allocation be, employer decides gets doses. 

Note far, employers state allocated doses health care systems government agencies capacity administer vaccines in-house. 

I'm sure work get people go CVS Walgreens get vaccine. probably go around spitting people. could result physical injuries well infections.

Realistically one exposed, virus needs get busy trying replicate. know certain believe body controls infection transmission occur. viral load stopped causes actions like sneezing can't transmitted. guess can't Americans. Gotta get hyphen there.

Our unity country completely destroyed identity politics. Ok. enough stop virus second infection? sure thats correct 100% factors well like lot viruses mutated less deadly strains time. empathize it, actually, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre ones unreasonable. work home, fianc√©e MS, store trips, etc. keep exposed. pushed wedding back 2022 make absolutely sure wouldn‚Äôt put anyone bad position. I‚Äôd love worry it. would travel go get coffee whim patio drinks, national caseload high? put extra strain people go out? Said friends &amp; family back weddings, parties, holiday gatherings. say asked someone pick something up, one specific example‚Äîmy fianc√©e confided asked SiL grab surprise Christmas already getting thing. response met with. hurt, neither us understand everyone convinced ‚Äòearned‚Äô right suddenly start acting like everything normal late game. rather, they‚Äôre put don‚Äôt encourage so/attend. They‚Äôre people posting memes respecting pandemic boundaries 5 months ago. we‚Äôre allowed question inconsistency maintain own. Idk. thoughts I‚Äôm expressing private thoughts kind way work out. Thanks productive comment though. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è experts?

We aren‚Äôt going restrictions herd immunity reached, we‚Äôll see fewer fewer cases deaths go down. #ScienceMatters

I try keep mind much better vision hindsight. think post pandemic studies going amazingly interesting. big ones like mask mask, expect pretty interesting nuances prove much influential ever expected. I'm always curious people make comments like one made. Ask him. I'm sure makes think we'll go another lockdown. That's going happen without another stimulus. overweight person cause restrictions social distancing last time? studies like huge problems - accounting less testing children, include time periods children school, etc. 

Like, sure, test adults more, confirmed cases. adults go grocery store children don't, adults exposed. Lol clearly I've read lot theory hahaha. One shocking explanations Marx's theory capital ever seen used subbed r/communism.

Like difficult know start. Like someone ever read Capital write ""what's big deal unemployment""? write ""Capitalism means production controlled capital, people get surplus value production?""

We far worst country WITHOUT restrictions. 

If country better USAs approach validated then? Mexico‚Äôs? Canada‚Äôs? 

All countries deaths COVID, comparing country restrictions country restrictions less fatalities still proves point. threads pretty mind blowing people show many things ""those oppose"". Nuanced comments discussions unpopular hidden threads though.  Schools spread minor disease lice. supposed believe spread highly contagious disease? Right? Maybe worse janurary due inevitable christmas traveling, end janurary damage fully visible already 10's millions vaccinated.

You‚Äôre kind missing point though. point experiment eroded public trust medical establishment, it‚Äôs related specifically vaccination. point experiment blatantly unethical run, people making thought OK victims black.

The fact people ran experiments (it‚Äôs one!) like means many Black people uncomfortable trusting doctors.

There‚Äôs lot talk rolling vaccine communities hardest hit first, many communities color. experiments like these, people questioning whether guinea pigs. Many people, unfortunately husband included, like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs let people get vaccine first really sure side effects‚Äú.

You're laughingstock... know that, right? Time freak nothing again. Deaths seem lag 6 weeks so. deaths seeing today Halloween Elections. 
 
We see deaths caused Thanksgiving gatherings early mid January, goes Christmas, around start February. Hashtag jealous

/S, mostly I've seen circles even reasonable people, testing effort much. 
When symptoms, reduce partying wash hands more, maybe sleep separate room.

No one least dozen symptom cases last weeks went test, even older people.
Because testing means getting appointment, driving 20 kilometres, high, extreme risk actual Covid infection test center.

I concluded tests available supermarkets cents change things. never policy

That's false. Tegnell admitted multiple times back March.

The strategy beginning allow virus continue spread slow, controlled rate herd immunity would achieved without overloading twelfth day Christmas spreader gave thee fresh case covid 19. ELI5. What's difference variant strain? virus rip least another 3-6 months vaccines start working. Many die we're near end yet even though see light. opinion give spot line vaccinated then. Put back line vaccines come back. Also, need aggressively enforce 14 day quarantine return. Let‚Äôs learn nothing enforce approach last spring. Me. would. I‚Äôve saying I‚Äôd take approved vaccine Phase 1 trials began. Phase 3 results aren‚Äôt necessary commit taking effective vaccine that‚Äôs approved authorities world over. 

It takes simple understanding process: get lab millions doses. It‚Äôs long process arduous testing many, many eyes process watching diligently. 

I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôd take untested vaccine - one one been. think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs messed polls. could question they‚Äôre asking. passes Phase 3 (and thus 50% effective) I‚Äôd take it. That‚Äôs basically flu shot, not? *You* don‚Äôt need see info first making commitment surprised! Tustin south Orange County, part Southern California region lock-down right now. Yesterday, ICU capacity hits 4.2%. flu season would like word you.  Sad say zero complacency really anyone since April- may. Herd immunity isn‚Äôt good thing, feel healthcare workers who‚Äôve died. Fuck, know people family members die still don‚Äôt give shit. OoooOOOOoooo smell open.

Was quite weird cycling one streets them. street would normally busy Saturday night instead pretty empty, women sitting windows looking bored scrolling phones. *divisive I'm happy you!! Seriously fucking happy grateful work. know that's words. put mask everything end help express gratitude sacrifices make, too. think lot. mechanism place that. impossible. correct. Think like cookie recipe different type chocolate chip used. base recipe already established researchers made ‚Äúchocolate chip‚Äù one specific covid-19. Also ‚Äúrushed‚Äù component explained. researchers funding available making vaccine ever scientists could work faster without worry logistics funding. companies also allowed start producing vaccine large quantities trials completed results published. eliminates time normally exists post trial companies get approval, produce package vaccine distribution. also able get results validated reviewed faster. things normally take long time medicines vaccines. 

There shouldn‚Äôt substantial long term effects type vaccine due work. illicit immune response makes body produce antibodies virus. vaccine ingredients eliminated body. people side effects, mostly due immune response unknown allergy vaccine ingredient, often mild (sore arm, headache, low fever) severe side effects rare. It‚Äôs also important note side effects things also experience get covid rate occurring due infection greater rate occurring due vaccination. 

Additionally know covid lasting effects seem long term surviving patients. obviously don‚Äôt know long last novel virus covid survivors already reporting things like chronic fatigue, heart disease, lasting shortness breath, kidney issues, etc. Compare vaccine trial participants don‚Äôt see symptoms reported. 

Now said monitoring unexpected effects post vaccination rolled large scale. common medication clinical trials 5-10 years approval.  Obscurantism fanatic right-wing always walk together.  fear people going take false comfort start process going take months months actually complete. definitely good news, hardly time start relaxing.

If pandemic shown us anything, people US take false comfort slightest sign able go back normal lives. :( anyone know Belgium getting fuckerd virus? I'm hard time finding logic it... daycare requires 2 hallways least. older classes (3+) require day life less valuable today us. X people die that‚Äôs 1% population that‚Äôs terrible. X people die that‚Äôs 10% population society going huge problems long time. even reading article cause think you‚Äôre lost. mention mission accomplished anyone wants vaccine get soon. It‚Äôs variant said doesn‚Äôt mean anything vaccine it‚Äôs mutation happened probably hundreds times far, it‚Äôs animal ones get iffy though, drastically change things pass back human, haven‚Äôt said one you‚Äôre speaking I‚Äôll tell what, though Oxford‚Äôs vaccine bit flop, PR team incredible. Whoever able hype delayed, 62% effective vaccine much deserves promotion. Spanish flu flu, got less deadly. Science shouldn‚Äôt need religious approval Fauci hasn‚Äôt said anything close 2022 since learned vaccine 90% effective Ah see. receive vaccine I'll still wear masks socially distance precaution people, vaccine proven effective mass produced everyone get it, life return normal. 52 million Americans aged 65 older. brother ED doc... gets vaccine Thursday I‚Äôm relieved

Fucking Sinterklaas... elders die dumb fuck, gotten tested shit like this.

clorox works covid too, let's hope nobody suggest injecting /s I‚Äôm sure. Traveling spreading lot easier 1918. People didn‚Äôt travel far distance it‚Äôs easier.

We also Moderna approved next week Oxford likely January plus JnJ shortly that. Mid Q2 anyone wants vaccine (in US) it.  r/covidlonghaulers know day began develop symptoms? Testing positive Friday would necessarily mean contagious Monday. think they're still trying decide two questions agree argument. also think another context consider life expectancy time period substantially lower, 50 years old male excluding 1918 (which lower due flu). average age death Spanish flu would lower well. (Excluding argument disease deadly handled)

We larger, older population, naturally affected. least it‚Äôs 95% effective. goes well ones want get vaccinated get vaccinated, bye bye pandemic us normal people asinine comment, maths.

It's maths asinine compare % dead population meaningful comparison impact two. poster isnt trivialising deaths highlighting comparison valid unless account population.

No, comparing % considers one virus lethal case-by-case basis specific point time. Covid19 would easily cause deaths Spanish flu early-20th century medicine.

Especially since know people going gather holidays still...  keep forgetting mention tiny, isolated island nation relatively small economy major role New Zealand's success.

New Zealand sees 4 million tourists one year. Heathrow, one airport UK, sees one week. UK massive trading nation close heart global economy. cannot close borders easily reddit likes think. New Zealand fringes. New Zealand's air traffic Asia rounding error comparison large airport.

New Zealand closing borders affects little global economy population. comparison UK closing borderers, much easier. detract NZ's success geography vital role addition competent governance. close borders lock proves lockdowns isolated places work. surprising. first shot second one? think second one would important track. Isn‚Äôt obesity considered comorbidity? Well yeah, think article, headline least, conflating two things really important separate:

1. side effects vaccine vs effects COVID body.
2. ""natural immunity"" recovered COVID infection vs ""artificial immunity"" induced vaccine.

A person never COVID needs think mainly 1. point 2 highly relevant already COVID--is ""worth it"" get vaccine body already generated immune response? Also, social question: prioritize vaccine never COVID? seems like, given scarcity vaccine, really important answer question. also curious. heard, premise children spread virus much require masks. true premise is, know, given amount sickness goes around school normally.

I looked up. Dec 1 on, children elementary school (4-12y) required wear masks all. Children high school (12-18y) required wear mask, moving; sitting class, take masks.

The weirdest thing Physical Education, singing, acting, dancing, practical classes exempt need wear masks. True Permitted ; Nothing Everything person year TN increased 33.9k 43.1k, increase 27%. However, absolute numbers. also tested 60.8k people actual increase 11,1% 11,6%, 0,5%.

Minor mathematical error: difference percentages given percentage points (ppt.) 

I completely get sentiment, staying home months sucks ass. However, analysis assumes implicitly sample population getting tested uniform arguably case people get tested chance covid. number tells us amount problematic people risen ~25%, significant. 

And 25% much expected growth prevented.

Anyhow, share sentiment wondering whether measures bad consequence. However, cannot draw conclusion data assumption simply valid. Topics try avoid talking others: 

Sex, Politics, Religion, Coronavirus... I‚Äôm also MA. Since schools opened, cases rising steadily. silly low. Idk hard people grasp. It‚Äôs obvious contributing. one. another platitude incessantly spread ""*b....but KNOW*"" crew.

There definitive research one way another, likely vaccine reduce transmission greatly even people carriers (based know viral load symptomatic spread). imagine even stupidly rich people appreciate need keep trained art keeping people dying alive. They‚Äôll keep riding private islands estates months - like it‚Äôs strain them. think empathy limited imagination functionally innumerate. Basic probability might well advanced calculus average person.  I'm showing article video students, mostly african american living poor community high high school drop rate. I'm always telling ""Education path, it"". article like great see possibilities, really able envision scientists, highly educated. Ted Cruz? know, can‚Äôt pass say something.

This woman works critical care unit. Unless you‚Äôre healthcare worker, commentary assume not, cannot comprehend woman endured last several months. Overrun units, people dying shouldn‚Äôt, dying quite painful lonely deaths gasping vent air, bodies overwhelmed secretions get oxygen need maximum vent settings. 

Imagine nurse, lacking proper ppe, afraid fall ill. Or, take care critically ill colleagues. Or... bring virus home family. 

But, expect slap smile picture. comment shockingly insensitive. Hopefully pulls might feel way you, guy stop preaching wonderful everyone else terrible disgusting. US extra vaccine obviously throw away. I'm sure aby excess would donated poor countries. bad reactions? blame dems like Cuomo sowing seeds doubt ‚ÄúTrump developed vaccine.‚Äù fact played politics whole Covid virus last year makes blatantly clear don‚Äôt give shit people.

No one praised key scientist behind Covid vaccine right now, key scientist. 

This literally global effort. Moderna Pfizer leaned scientific community large get done. amount research testing went build body knowledge happen quickly staggering.

Lockdowns still keep virus control almost entirely impossible erase virus forever. Well duh, wants people inject toxic vaccine bloodstream force us switch mac windows. (Obviously /s) I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs completely terrible idea some. one, behave safely Florida: wear mask, keep distances seeing people, shop online, avoid crowded/indoor space etc. Second, 
being stuck Canada winter chance really exercise outside socialize problematic physical mental health. Finally, winter dangerous elderly too. safe spot Florida chance get exercise/walks outside, maybe even see people social distancing, I‚Äôd definitely consider it. 

My mother lives sunny place Europe, used Alps. much better isolating there, able take walks etc. stuck apartment months end. antii-vaxxers conspiracy theorists divided want, get chance better believe I'll line simply chance able see family without worry.

a) getting reasonable amount population vaccinated
b) making sure residents incoming population vaccinated

Aka I'm staying I'm vaccinated borders uk open. Chill. comment shitty sake it. Don‚Äôt buy yet. Exactly Pretty sure lot Americans reckless disregard know history. mean school forced? mean approve another $29,000,000,000 Bailout Airline Industry. 

My question Why?

Nearly experts even regular people agree know Air Travel simply return pre-COVID levels. 

Ever. 

Business travel big one. Companies adopting getting used using telework video conferencing. 

Business travel simply return levels before. 

Leisure travel make way back. it‚Äôs going take years decade people jumping planes tour world whim. There‚Äôs simply going much red tape long take long time return. 

THAT SAID...

Why shouldn‚Äôt airlines fail? are‚Äî simply put... many airlines. many planes. many pilots. many flight attendants. many baggage handlers. on. 

Globally flights 48%. specific countries / routes 85%. 

So people aren‚Äôt flying. Shouldn‚Äôt simply laws supply demand allow airlines compete... win. fail. 

The result less competition. requires less cost compete. 

I mean it‚Äôs clear people flying like did. don‚Äôt plan to. many planes. Period. 

Is plan keep pumping money airlines fly empty planes around? 

Let best airlines win. air travel picks new companies formed. enter market place. 

If 10 Barber Shops Main Street... survive. much competition. best ones win. smartest ones win. 

29 Billion‚Äî exactly money going used for... exactly? That‚Äôs works. Clearly hospitals dealing serious outbreaks verge collapsing.....so, no, logic doesn‚Äôt hold. want everything go back way used be, without making sacrifices part. reminds five year old acts sometimes. You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs funny said loud Ya get it. Im saying bring latinx post italy? Given COVID numbers Belgium, assumed everyone invite list. Weird guys jumping joy months ago NY lower case numbers high want divert topic instead talk much shitty state failed! 36k dead people! Wake up! go that? wash hands you‚Äôre done. got bidet bring TP hoarders üßª consequences fines, like Amazon really cares. normal schlub skipping court DUI would warrant his/her arrest. put thousands workers harm's way? miniscule fine compared billions Amazon worth. teach 'em! It‚Äôs stupid Bavaria everyone get tested free. Less 99% cases even **survive**. High wealth tends indicate heavily populated area thus medical facilities much likely get doses. logistical problem. easier cheaper roll vaccine higher density areas trying hit dirt roads Alabama. trying disparage anyone. vaccines currently available require ridiculous support cooling makes transportation rural areas lot harder.

I think set aside doses wealthy people think wealthy better protected given proximity high population centers. single mother chronic illness, household chores wait weeks. done less frequently weeks. Choose battles wisely. 

Maybe look daycare toddler? Even 1 2 days week, things normalise. daycares pretty good precautions, infection rates among young children still low...

Good luck! pull through! Oh lesson learned. century. social media, misinformation, fake news happened. Worse absolute #'s % population?

Spanish Flu: U.S., 28% population 105 million became infected, 500,000 850,000 died (0.48 0.81 percent population).

1918 US Population: ~103M

2020 US Population: ~331M

To bad Spanish Flu US Covid-19 need kill ~1.6M ~2.7M.

*Not* saying dead person horrible Covid 'isn't nighmarish'... trying think comparison Spanish Flu make it. I've heard people say ""thinning herd around thousands years"".  unnerving. Like time governments used vaccines nefarious purposes? Especially black people US? remember that. fucking shit Right? Even Canadians sometimes think FL actually desirable destination.

I mean, come on, understand wanting go somewhere warmer winter ... FL? Increase cases stalling vaccine start impact. Therapeutic treatments improving candidate showing high efficacy. 

We could hit 4K, won‚Äôt go higher. could see us stalling low 3ks slowly declining. exactly!!!! facebook culties convinced seconds googling something teach much doctor knows.. people helpless Raw, rippling muscle. considered developing countries enough testing capabilities? think true private  Haha you‚Äôre funny.

Wow, Florida. got source Im pretty sure inaccurate considering 10-15% develop severe symptoms 5% end critically also year virus. know pop long term. results clinical trials. ""We're backed we'll call got door""

""Bu- know nevermind"" Reported idea downvoted correct. person correct. virus already proved primarily wreak havoc elderly, people pre-existing conditions, generally unhealthy people. running course flu majority young generally healthy poeple. Spanish flu wreaked havoc anyone around today I'd imagine modern medicine would able treat much easier though population standpoint across demographics deadlier virus. I'm thinking along lines july-august school starts start see real change. Remember, see vaccines June cuz administration let us incompetence. ""highly unlikely"" new mutation respond coronavirus vaccine

That's vaccines work, Mr. Hancock. meant say was, ""Our immune response likely effective new mutation, vaccinated."" wouldn‚Äôt want kids anywhere near teacher wishes people wary rushed vaccine ‚Äúlearn lesson‚Äù logical person sound like sociopath thought gas used mass slaughter conjunction shallow graves made bodies rise ground? [Do smell Trump said ready everyone immediately. would say people agreed vaccine ready end 2020 - take months months everyone get access one. Trump bare minimum. Based data? course better healthier kids spend day children. anyone knows parent whose kid distance learning tell Zoom school stuff crap. kid willing sit go school great, lot kids get bored walk away thus need supervised. 

However, right now, shitty may be, sending kids school wrong plan, result kids infecting families, results kids critically ill dead parents grandparents. However bad may deprive kids interaction, worse kids (and society) family members die. 

Of course quite right need rethink structure pay workers whatnot- societal level, take two incomes raise child. minimum wage introduced, person minimum wage could afford live support small family. Now, person minimum wage often can't support themself without roommates 2nd/3rd job. family often NEEDS two incomes.

Opportunistic infections knocked antibiotics. antivirals, steroids ventilators oxygen. treatment lowers mortality rate. know flu, 2018 variety nearly deadly today. native think vaccinated come contact infected people can't pass on. come enough contact infected person would normally make sick (or asymptomatic) still pass theoretically.

Meaning, vaccinated, please still wear mask practice social distancing people vaccinated. Probably depressing thought another summer without majority people vaccinated. puff* risks COVID concerning vaccine.

I mean guess depends age, given I'm 50 I'm concerned rushed vaccine getting COVID. I'm going guess people consider vaccine free pass go maskless again. probably get worse gets better  White House official fell ill Covid-19 September recovering three months hospital, **though lost right foot lower leg battle virus**, according friend.

Wow. Many people spreading virus presymptomatic. There's little evidence people develop noticeable symptoms spreading virus. almost incentive continue level restrictions risk group vaccinated. small part population represents overwhelming majority deaths hospitalizations. worried them, lockdowns make sense.

Name checks out. know right, people care anyone themselves. sounds like kind party. Nah, way said ""healthy young americans"" pretty telling.

I've dealt lot abileist crap growing whenever people use ""healthy young"" play tragedy sort tells priorities lie- think people healthy young. That's awesome. whole family toxic bunch turds. 

Flying New Jersey weekend get-together friends family pandemic want sympathy? GTFOH   data 2 weeks ago.. wrong.  two year old old enough wear mask, fly. Simple. answer risk everyone else's life flight. government garnish wages arrest fine gets large. I‚Äôm really sure there. 

Relying private sector drawbacks, like isn‚Äôt alternative forces people change jobs protect themselves. don‚Äôt trust guys... I‚Äôll wait til millions others taken first. ""covid fog"" actually thing? I've problems focusing lately I've made pretty dumb decisions recently (like Christmas gifts gift wrapped filling cards they're to) I've found forgetting things 100% remember (like people's birthdays). I've people tell symptom long term covid. I've people tell I'm stressed/burned need get rest. Thus proving USA populace learned nothing. 

I remember reading 1918's ""anti-mask league"" back January thought, ""we could possibly *that* stupid century better scientific understanding.""

America proved fucking wrong. Racist much? Show me. couldn‚Äôt agree more. Yes. highlights:

He said ""You gotta kidding me"", ""You're going us?"" asked get plane. got said ""You going fly us first class NY?"" ""I think stupid enforce \[points mask\] strict, makes sense. virus 99 percent survival rate.""

When told bags going destination, said ""you're gonna stop plane right now!""

She said, ""she's 2! literally 2!"" ""What mean? We've flown summer! flown us!"" ""Is actual joke?!"" want high five another random fan sporting event. Yeah.... he‚Äôs waiting see goes. It‚Äôs one vaccine wouldn‚Äôt make difference compared hundreds millions needed. Also solid PR. Rural Canadians lot common American counterparts. exception goobers dictate domestic foreign policy. well armed. took job office years working alone home specifically get room people went virtual March 1st. I'm wondering lines communication work. know there's state agency contacting residents done pre-existing medical systems (i.e. call one's doctor)? feel like basic information effectively communicated come months ago. also 675k 1/3rd current population. one reads article. talking rich countries Gov. Death meeting board members startup, we've decided pull plug disappointing year. There's good chance would happened anyways without COVID, certainly speed things up. People fuck somehow

FTFY. anti vaccination crowd biggest hurdle viable vaccine exists. Nice move, Hungary. EMA slow molasses situation. See wrote, ""an opinion""? opinion, one created.

Right, moment creation, becomes opinion. Therefore, ""creating opinion"" poor grammar, neither ""effecting opinion."" (though agree edit: grammar

[Muphry's Pack guys! Redditor foggynotion doubts it, happening! Except people thread saying *exactly that.* vaccines since baby, apparently scary reaction vaccines given. doctor told mom child, vaccinate basically. always listened advice-- anti-vax all.

(Not we're great. expert predictions always dire actuality.) Honestly, think logical means trying deligitimize anyone camp. mean getting nothing vaccine 9-10 months absolutely unheard think bit skepticism warranted healthy. Fortunately, however, people fall category eventually get vaccine if/when see safe. I'm looking forward day anyone walk pharmacy get vaccine, guess variety tiers people prioritized happens. Sure said Corona virus. Smartphones + social media means literally every village idiot megaphone qualified scientists. people concerned about. ignorant, mostly well-meaning people middle could swayed arguments.

Yes, rightfully so. accuse OP quoting misinformation, clicked read information included source felt lots good information share add context. I'm sure understand defenition word context.
It say sentence. say wrong. short context adds... Context. I'm sure words better clarify dictionary defenition context: 
""the parts something written spoken immediately precede follow word passage clarify meaning.
""word processing affected context words appear"". 
I believe non sequitur (a conclusion statement logically follow previous argument statement.), literally part previous statement full (aka context). Thank Fuck you, elevator queen. exactly hold HPV vaccine good example testing, since permanently fucked lot people got even mildly immunocompromised.

This happened used one binding agents placebo vaccine, wrote people getting permanent disabilities unrelated. one actually true. killing part, believe creates false positive test positive. cancelled vaccine might imagine. mean, I'll admit, helped speed along, great. I'll give credit that. take away harm caused us meantime, what's done done, wanna move forward. issue enough research done people already ‚Äúnatural‚Äù antibodies would react vaccine? testing done? could concern WH since many people already Covid. people enjoy wearing mask next year then, employer going let go without one can't prove vaccinated. Funny, read note Astra Zeneca trial gave feedback indicating high percentage vaccinated could still spread virus. data size small apparently frankly, problems reported trial, suspect imho. 

No word Rna vaccines. hoping many things require proof vaccinations people hold out. come Arizona. Ever heard snow birds? Look charts. northern migration sun caused us major spike. adult people able receive vaccine immediately. Right children pregnant people included studies. know cause reactions severe allergies, many vaccines. want us wait bit ""herd immunity"" community spread almost totally die out. / can't vaccinated danger.

Guessing rumours hotting up.  Anytime someone asks I'm vigilant and/or refuse go say, ""Oh know. Maybe COVID *worse ever been...*"".

I've saying since July people give fuck anymore. 

They need putting cameras hospitals showing live streams people dying. morbid, know, unwillingness witness what's going going fuck us even worse. one days Moderna week two?

 basically vaccines gonna work? expecting thinking maybe 1 would work. I'm little skeptical effectiveness vaccine I'm physically good shape &amp; live fairly solitary lifestyle, I'd rather get build natural immunity. I'm bit dissapointed US too. Something treatment AZ smacks corporate libel. AZ shown efficient TheLancet yet keep seeing negative articles posted like two weeks ago popping reddit. know bungled somewhat, fixed.

It makes wonder something AZ produced cost cheap, big american pharma want slash people buy theirs.

Either way proven efficient get definitely good news. I'm hoping we're vaccinated June go Glastonbury. Ok delayed additional Moderna be? I‚Äôve heard Pfizer July, I‚Äôm sorry way late. need able offer anyone wants April. There‚Äôs excuse take 7 months get enough doses 40% country currently wants it. sure 3 covered April, I‚Äôd like know least one 2 already approved 95% large part them. gotta say, IMO seem like worked something else comment. attempting condescending. attempting clarify. assume anything, clicked OPS link, OP provided, read full. Again, found lots great info link, words op commented, felt share. share opinion previous comments, shared full quotes OPS source, assuming people time click read full. search negative written word find it. Maybe take break today. 
And added context meant add CONTEXT. Literally. figureatively, sort sarcastic code. info OP shared, without clicking. I'm also sure ever used term ""antivax"" mentioned anywhere quotes posted read sure... Keep mind 12 week survey. There's indication effects last forever, year, even six months. nasty virus body take long time recover, generally, bodies recover.

More research definitely needed, think decision pretty clear go older at-risk people time.  Wonder US approve also month next? Seems short supply early 2021. Originally, hoping 60%+ effectiveness Pfizer/Moderna achieved 95%... Maybe Astra vaccines younger at-risk groups? Thank you. listened. think me, know enough science behind mRNA (I need personal research). keep coming back this, though: mRNA comes without risk, said (within breath assuring safety) certain groups people *not* take vaccine? stands reason enough data yet....so end back square one, thinking myself: science behind vetted well enough yet. Woah, enormous news. Right, line. think people making vaccines get first, show confidence *and* make sure supply chain disrupted outbreak. He's important person get it. vaccine *that* scarce would make difference. can't, yet. US lined enough doses everyone. emailed doc say willing expect get least March. ''If get vaccine eventually get COVID. There's zero risk option, weighing risks other.''

Even true stretch imagination, risk getting COVID, serious symptons, thenbeing hospitalised eventually ending long term health complications low considering taking new vaccine (the first kind) unknown side effects.

I'm trying convince you, make judgment do. Given he's helping direct pandemic response, one could argue he's even important vaccinate practicing health care professionals nursing homes. Constantly bringing people front centre every moment comment like sort gotcha seeks downplay people follow clear consistent scientific messaging. outliers exist every topic including smoking meanwhile laws progressed people follow science.  wonder covid numbers would look still 1918 medical technology Yes, doctor PhD. title earned. confirm, child i‚Äôm sure frantic headlines fear mongering. 

surely they‚Äôre making jokes saying ICU beds full flying patients germany. nobody said many care? Might opinion thing enough money think it‚Äôs 100% plausible. I‚Äôve outgrown 90% allergies. list 120 things child reacted everything. Since Dad polio vaccinated mild reactions, honest time reactions mild. adult still many allergies managed counter drugs. 

Do food allergies now? strong reactions adult?

Talk doctor get simple test done. uncommon outgrow many allergies. monitor shot. virus becomes less harmful flu vaccines, ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù might legitimate argument. understand point; however, I‚Äôm genuinely curious‚ÄîI get impression would still discouraged anything differently we‚Äôre now, even private situations, I‚Äôm trying understand why. instance, wanted get together friends right now, we‚Äôd wear masks distance, vaccinated U.S. beginning reach level ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù, *why* would still unacceptable us together without masks? understand you‚Äôd still need precautions public, what‚Äôs harm forming social bubbles people already vaccinated? could risk higher it‚Äôd everyone‚Äôs vaccinated? continue spread, likelihood continues increase mutation arises defeats benefit vaccine.

God wish anybody else realized this. whole 'herd immunity' crowd, friends mine, can't wrap heads around fact idea bug capable gets chance infect several billion hosts. could become benign. could become even deadly. idea. someone explain video true. Read last post, im cell sorry. We're divided. topic Americans, vs. morons. Let's stop pretending they're equal numbers. don‚Äôt know... yes, people around maybe not. 

being immune can‚Äôt get serious sick doesnt meant can‚Äôt spread it, yet. Seriously. Showing confidence important ""line."" making plenty. Yet TB still kills million per year even treatment one cries it, terms numbers COVID nothing giant numbers cancer heart disease (which due missed scans, treatments etc get worse)

 Covid isnt deadliest thing face, even we're acting were. many killed number, far meaningful number would people killed per capita. Even relevant still would life lost per capita. figure 40 times lower Spanish flu. I'd really like know that. Jesus Christ. like vaccine ten thousands volunteers trials already. logic applies soon enough supply limiting gets vaccine high risk people. hope first line vaccines available, exactly reasons state. point decide risk worth it? flu killed tens thousands year lived normally, Covid reduced flu-levels less don‚Äôt see can‚Äôt live normally. think joke No.. R value went ~1 1.28 announced today. that's rapid rise let spiral exponentially  Problem is, vaccines magic. Snap fingers, jab, done! wish ... However, sometimes work, sometimes people transmit even personally immune, one knows long immunity lasts. So, get LOT information, MUST careful. Haha thought convo recently reason! Healthcare workers getting jab Christmas, like we've known strong possibility since phase 2 concluded August üòè

Merry Christmas  I'd *like* think instead Covid-19, something scale 1918 flu even smallpox, we'd take much seriously.

That's I'd *like* think, recent history made unsure. would say, go back re-familarize events denial, mask holes, blame, prepared type events, lock happening have, reopening soon, sanitation, Initially fudging body counts, et al. like we're reading script written 1920s acting 2020. remember shutdown Hasidic wedding. Well done. one complaints come time, Germany. people going disobey rules surely better vaccinated? realize ""widely available"" means second half next year earliest, right?
Again, really see taking precautions ""throwing away life"". black white. Polio vaccine 78% effective virus 100% dead gone pushes spreading vector 1( r 0.5 means 10 people get it, spread 5, spread 3, spread 1, spread 0).

95% efficiency GOD TIER vaccine. Except whole part Spanish Flu represented 30 times risk lifespans Covid. 2.5 year old feel you. done everything think get child wear mask. model behavior, big brother big sister, put masks stuffed animals, watch videos sing songs mask wearing, etc. it. Rips mask immediately. result, take anywhere. Toddlers famous meltdowns tiny things, feel like bad parent understanding something ready do. parent realize going happen behave responsibly.

I agree parents story put child position. would travel emergency right now, know would need drive, fly. There's grain truth there. patients HIV though. translate practically cash flow, even women's organizations - use example - somehow got preferential slot vaccine dispersement waiting line, acquired immunity before, say, &lt; 50 year olds high risk higher risk say 30-40 y/olds, would (hopeful) immunity resumption group-specific activities benefit cash flow way significantly different currently stands? Surely subsisting cash generated handmade goods like masks, could continuing either socially isolated amongst other, wearing masks taking precautions 

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps missed logical progression saying - make much sense me. agree randomizing based birthdate best way, unless mean reverse chronological order starting eldest society. Even then, I'd argue balancing act immunizing already lived ""most"" life, probably isolated function age already, statistically risk still contribute society, wide social network, lot wick left burn It‚Äôs essential got first Covid test yesterday. Sitting car, surrounded National Guard, nurses protective gear, felt like movie. whole thing hit like wave, thinking death, suffering, despair, uncertainty past year. finally got front line, tears. must thought crazy. lot people don‚Äôt want to. opens question his* mother even alive. based expected demographics odds high mother already dead. Mother-in-law needs first assume married (divorce...)

While questions found research, also private questions would prefer general public find without permission I'm going look.

*he another assumption, though think female CEO would loudly noted now. lockdown works, that‚Äôs great. doesn‚Äôt work, must done wrong. logic assumes shows lockdowns great idea, circularly dismissing data consistent starting assumption. Decent chance J&amp;J single-shot vaccine gets approved Jan also. so, would massively help getting big supply early on. ""politicians take live TV""

""They swapped placebo""

""Who's coming statistics""

""Those doctors scientists paid government can't trust them""

There literally nothing convince antivax conspiracy crowd there's always another layer deception think happening.

I apprehensive new vaccine remembered couple hundred years ago guy rubbed pus cowpox blister cut became cure smallpox. local media drew cartoons people sprouting cow heads taken vaccine.

Times change people don't, unfortunately. Don‚Äôt tell guys people get it, businesses require it, others fall line People absolutely take precaution going around infants immunocompromised people feeling well. 
I never said continue lockdowns it, I'm responding ""absolutely social distancing"". OOS Please, want see close friends mutual classmates end high school career.  Redditors anti-science. One thing consider *who* gets vaccinated. Disease transmission seems adhere network topology, gather. people interact enough spread beyond immediate family, people enough interactions could potentially spread whole host people. 

If target network ""nodes"", people would responsible majority spread, could effectively get herd immunity effects earlier.

This front line health workers long term care workers targeted first, likeliest exposed, potentially spread someone vulnerable. 

After long term care workers front line health workers vaccinated, gets lot fuzzier, different strategies there.

Not epidimologist, interesting strategies actually come computer networking, would also apply.

Can link articles later (when bit mobile). crossed 1 death per 1,000 people milestone weekend too. cases reported right show death statistics another 6 weeks so. [I've calculating forecasted death demographic based current death rates today total 211 future deaths... probably low side since numbers skewed rapid increase cases past couple weeks. surprised averaging 200-250 deaths per day end January. use line thought, last time rushed vaccine? Honestly could use history back points view. 

I way antivac, blacked drunk talking shit jenny mccarthy's views vaccination new year's party (my wife told funny was), honestly makes concerned.

I know researching form vaccination SARS, halted money ran outbreak contained (god miss government could work correctly.

Someone trying fuck us squabble amongst ourselves. United stand. Slow Nazi zombies fast Nazi zombies? Slow zombies would really fuck choreography.

Anything requires nationwide cooperation intentional acts thoughtful kindness doomed fail. country isn‚Äôt split people vaccine. Yeah people dead set aren‚Äôt getting aren‚Äôt going persuaded anyone. Cool ignore them. Appeal people middle (like me) know it‚Äôs good still nervous it. Appeal people plan take eventually want wait see‚Äîthis could get taking sooner it‚Äôs available. Appeal people understand science still concerned politics. lot people nervous aren‚Äôt fully anti-vaccine. hospitals risk overwhelmed I'll reevaluate hospitals managing vaccine widely available longer care. know chose timing, far late.  Sweden telling decades best health care world. Maybe pandemic wake call them. He's high enough risk due age he'll going late winter / early spring even skip line.

But assume he'll getting within next days. Normally, approve political leaders getting cut ahead regular people, Joe's elevated risk fact chaotic, last thing need president-elect keel he's even inaugurated. even want imagine kind chaos would cause. I'm sorry, 2023? What? Exactly (alone) taking vaccine make everything go back normal. happens regardless do.

Also, Australia's borders closed, borders countries low Covid. North Dakota 4th per capita death rate still rising. South Dakota rising even faster.

Thats im saying close! Swedes say so! People stopped working home, black Friday happened, autumn break kids started going school again.

And no, said going to, moment, appears though severe long term effects far minority. bugs eat you. Welcome Magical-thinking Kingdom...  Rules thee, immunity last longer year.

Actually know all.

All really say immunity lasts many months, that's low long observed it.

But people got covid 9-10 months ago mostly seem immune, take vaccine immunity last long, probably longer. drop long term immunity tends curve gradually, opposed stopping suddenly one day, early victims still fine almost year, fine many months more. Covid = idea infected, getting symptoms subside couple days, losing taste smell week two. yeah, deadly. always thought today would scene end Return Jedi, quite still great day. easily begin argue merits capitalism even way enriches peoples lives gives possibility hope people dreams idea. blaming capitalism isn‚Äôt necessarily generalized belief whole structure criticism current potential future iterations based trajectory we‚Äôve set up. 

Be may think way people often navigate system today inherently predatory dangerous. byproducts framework necessity people crushed weights financial aspirations leaves feeling sick. I‚Äôm bright person can‚Äôt articulate simply, use flowery words talk abstractions, hear people bit switched observant talk trappings capitalism get real uneasy feeling can‚Äôt pinpoint. start pandemic, assumed would millions deaths now. next one worse. literally evidence exist. reinfections common all. 

Do think plausible/suspect reinfections magically stop state lines that, somehow, Oregon, Colorado, South Dakota unique? applies magically apply states? I'd like see immunology/virology backs basic immunology/virology. 

The basic immunology/virology virus shows us certain percentage previously infected population (looks focusing ~7%) develop long term immunity. Whether look antibodies, cell, memory B cells, memory cells... seem converge 7% developing long term immunity. also PhD Microbiolgy way regularly work vaccine projects.

It's literally teams job right figure reinfection rates develop model reinfection one vaccine manufacturers see if/when boosters may necessary bring pandemic close. I'll take work opinions day week. there's max spread? Ugh please stay hell true. matter people like, want get away them. view. Psssh, call BS. Kids can‚Äôt drive...

Nobody IQ doesn‚Äôt begin decimal point ever believed kids couldn‚Äôt spread Covid. glad US. Seriously. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sure. others pointed out, 150M vaccinated people two mRNA vaccines alone (before options) ballpark 18+ population less 40% population currently willing take vaccine.

I still think potential overall delay willing order month several, huge disaster like year something. 5th graders stay one class, starting junior high kids start rotating different classrooms art, home ec classes similar high school model 8 class periods. minimize economic damage, essentially.

I‚Äôm saying whether agree not, that‚Äôs why. Stores stuck less useless inventory put orders. sort thing.

Let us examples kids. like editorialized titles driving narrative low information readers basically read titles here, confirming comments.

I think reporters, think news orgs obvious editorial bias, caught feedback loop people seek positive headlines post Reddit also craft narrative / confirm narrative.

It's almost if. you‚Äôve never heard capacity issue haven‚Äôt watching news. isn‚Äôt something resent weeks, resent months.

As said first wave major shortage tests caused people unable get tested. Good friends mine probably Covid first week unable test couldn‚Äôt know sure.

Meanwhile mainly people intensive care got tested, leading infection rate close 100%.

Have look [this page compare ‚ÄúAantal bij de GGD gemelde positief geteste personen naar meldingsdatum‚Äù ‚ÄúAantal overledenen naar datum van overlijden‚Äù starting 27th February.

You‚Äôll see deaths recent weeks (about double March), whilst 1/10th amount infections. 

More infections ‚â† deaths ‚â† beds taken hospital. ESPECIALLY vulnerable people (~2% population) take responsibility going much. Wait minute - recent pic crowds like London? Holy shit. meant sardonically. clearly care view business owners might profits slightly reduced already dreadful earning they're probably getting. Whatever, played capitalism lost. Would care share info/sources pfizer vaccination stops transmission?
