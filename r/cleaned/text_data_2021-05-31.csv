United States 479,918,943 tests

India 344,866,883

Even United Kingdom, fraction China's population, carried tests.

On per capita basis, China ranks 145, LOL. Aside government response, wonder altitude affect? People seem think 100% guests told need wear masks 100% guests actually wearing masks correctly. wasn’t. Theme parks really safe unvaccinated. also weren’t safe mask policy. I’m AP Disney gave AP Universal last month. Don’t take kids. 

That said, they’re pretty safe vaccinated people. They’re still nuts cleaning sanitizing they’re still operating reduced capacity. Ah, San Marino, country always screws GeoGuessr. Yes I'm expecting uptick. point, people still higher risk changing daily behaviors risk factors remain same; whereas changing daily behaviors overwhelmingly protected vaccine. Mild/asymptomatic cases likely go unrecorded. June probably going last month COVID-19 considered average threat general health public U.S. end month hospitalizations deaths par influenza. Southern California one people relatively severe reactions vaccine. basically ate away coverings lot nerves. I'm close full recovery. I'm terrified telling NEED get booster shit I'm going to...but I'm terrified Hmmmm...I thought Vermont lower...and Alaska... Still waiting 4th wave caused feelings impending doom. I'm sure coming soon. way thump comments mocking particular demographic would feel comfortable locked room person programmed People don’t want hear bad news pandemic. thing happened stories India. isolated reason inside ever (even dining, unless rains) helps lot. That's there's emergency use authorization. seriously understand? Hawaii track 100% visitors primarily arrive plane (a small percentage arrive boat). 

Other states, like Indiana example, tens thousands state visitors every day, primarily travelling automobile. File studies obvious results. Yeah I'm pretty much expecting go back before. pandemic totally destroyed trust society governing bodies beacuse hate government taking shortcuts convey information, understand lot people care technical side feels misleading like making minds us implement things do. Exactly

We're half country least one dose daily cases 20,000 still plummeting despite everyone acting like 2019 

There's zero reason keep pushing restrictions vaccinated people keep masking unvaccinated people may still danger? Assuming get point kids ages vaccinated, won’t really matter. Doesn’t matter... legitimate reason ask determine whether person threat not. Completely legit question. refuse answer, best assume threat. Period. play games want- you’ll shunned good chunk country sick bs. Delayed, skipped. applies test positivity rate California. applies people suspect may covid get tested. people getting tested 0.8% test positive covid, little less 1 100 people getting tested actually covid. 1 100 vast majority people yet vaccinated got shot days prior yet become effective. Doesn’t matter... legitimate reason ask determine whether person threat not. Completely legit question. refuse answer, best assume threat. Period. play games want- you’ll shunned good chunk country sick bs. kids unvaccinated old enough. also people can't take vaccine medical reasons.

The anti vaxxers spit face can't get vaccine.  Yeah, dare say somebody runs ""alternative health salon"" going sort clients already believe shite anyway. sorts morons nod understanding says ""fear lowest vibration"". Lol. bad. saying comments toxic, said poison Yeah everyone who’s died far 70. that’s good news us. happens nothing one even think possible unless you’re old Here’s important part, though: 

If someone legitimate disability, businesses (not all- eg really small ones) must provide reasonable accommodation possible. Businesses required accommodate causes undue hardship. That’s ‘reasonable’ part about. also cannot fire solely disability (they fire cannot perform job tasks even due disability.) 

All applicable person actual disability. legitimate medical reasons person cannot safely vaccinated covid many (eg history severe allergic reaction vaccination) meet definition disability. legit reason vaccinated doesn’t mean protected disabled person. 

People trying inappropriately hide behind ADA since covid began it’s frankly despicable. majority people refuse vaccination (despite able work long enough get vaccinated recover) using whatever bs excuse get away using. rest us need call demand better. 

As without paid time off, need demand employers better provide financial aid needed work couple days vaccination. plenty people would get vaccinated could afford work... part problem, need help. feel like we're seeing many signs various countries rolling back large swaths planet basically back 2019 fall  That’s saw last year. year least percentage vaccinated. That's sort point. time go wedding. roommates brother works local McDonalds told management lot McDonalds locations may permanently go drive thru isolated helps ton Americans can’t inconvenienced ya know... simply allowed. 3 weeks ago. lot like Mexico long ago.

Despite might think media often tells us, Remote learning Videoconferencing happening decades. People would rather believe FB post vaccination made unemployed civil engineer educated doctors risk dogs getting covid? Hopefully see many new cases this. stated vaccination rates shabby. WhatsApp fb great misinformation spreaders

Like US then... Marching = moving = going B.. yeah, gathering sucks losing family member. grandmother got friend went aunt's Christmas. infected 7 people already lost grandmother year pneumonia fall knew went hospital it. sucks say goodbye's phone thing hear oxygen machine. worst part would gotten vaccine another month half two, happen. friend also died COVID. sucks going 3 grandparents 1 within 2 years. 

At least vaccine available. excuse immunocompromised i.e. cancer, organ transplant, autoimmune condition actually allergic vaccine 18 who's parents anti vaxxers. adult loved one gets COVID dies vaccinated that's fault suffer complications die now. Took client see house today told vaccinated ""waiting people die off"" getting it. really know meant like, non-vaccinated people (aka her) like, people vaccinated but, something like 30,000+ died covid since vaccine became available everyone i'm just......so confused people see obtuse are?

I made joke horns still growing microchip keeps malfunctioning time time flew head completely. Exactly Alternative medicine certainly become popular among people thru social media days. WhatsApp fb great misinformation spreaders. think countries facing this. 

But see quack doctors arrested state. say govt promoting quack docs.
 
My family believe alternative medicine.

Isn't responsibility also? Dude, following Indian scene weeks now, shit show. even order vaccines far, except meager amount. 

Their leader nowhere seen election concluded last month. said election rallies April seen large crowd before. remember another shit show years ago, leader announced current currency notes defunct.

Anyway, third world gonna third world.. updated last week. odds low it’s something one even think about. acquaintance pass? masks then, think unvaccinated continue wear honor system, awesome bridge Brooklyn sell them. went inside get food week lol can't yet Yea like India Taiwan right. Oh wait doesn’t work Hey, I'll know Alabama pretty high alphabetical list! also large areas really complying covid restrictions immunity population. That's people mean say last summer way worse been. saw northeast drop minimal levels explode fall. also theorized people stuck inside got really hot out, leading bumps, especially south air conditioning normal (still given AC parts northern US). 3rd wave fall, however, way worse summer levels saw. No, big believer masks. saying argument, nothing matters except local community spread demonstrably false. lost 7 people first wave. Yet still conducted weddings, bhajan functions. 

When people believe exceptionalism, sky daddy quackery medicine, happens.

Doesn't government promote alternative ""medicine""? 15 early full use 28 phase 3 trials. Indeed. useful outside West.

Yes, fact pointed covid far dangerous vaccine plausibly could give long term health effects. pointed vaccine cannot change DNA make infertile. pointed neither covid vaccine around multiple years really feels dark long term ramifications vaccine, equally position regarding virus itself.

I think I've got permanent dent forehead. Hot take, make fun people face coverings pandemic too?  risks? Wow, must hard right 😀 There’s lot people open convincing. Antivax popular 2020. people convinced misinformation. I’m curious major media outlet claiming vaccine doesn’t protect variants. Well, defense vaccine, primary target market much less concerned infertility general population. can't believe there's stigma. release virus. changed slightly there.

Like Spanish Flu started Ohio something Spain country disclosing flu cases neutral WW1 issue talking casualties.  still approved EMA right? people said ""they really die covid!"" also comorbidities sure every death occurs week someone got vaccine 100% caused (even person 80 years old sickly). &amp;#x200B;

So provide cite, then.  TL;DR: Moral decision-making COVID-19 pandemic appears affected dark personality traits, masculine honor beliefs, belief pure good evil.   Safer?

Alpha solves  going mention police murdering people streets, sexual assaults almost 400 forced disappearances police? second mRNA shot 1-6 months give immunity large boost. Eventually we'll multivalent boosters. One mRNA shot quite effective. Canada UK delaying second shot 12 weeks, gives better measured immunity closer spacing. would India.  least trying (and failing miserably) maintain illusion give shit people’s well being... news flash: don’t give fuck. gotta maintain illusion long enough let people get used enough don’t rebel... goodluck.

Edit: people give fuck money. guys hilarious. richest country world trillions tech, shit pen paper. Meanwhile, little podunk Canadian province, access digital vaccine record anytime. problem counties like Australia New Zealand basically little Covid public become used basically zero cases.

The rest world happy reduce death hospitalisation point it’s worse flu.

Whereas Aud &amp; NZ public media expect zero cases. Forever. Governments pandering close minded thought.

I think expect countries closed years  deaths plateaued? Sorry you’re downvoted telling truth experience giving opinion. Thanks sharing. country stay home we're sick go out, mask not.  Yeah, losing two loved ones frustrated people get vaccine won't. spent winter terrified would lose more. never grateful anything vaccine. Screw that, whole thing ridiculous  mRNA vaccines contain mRNA spike protein. think pretty clear become endemic already. There's way go many cases enough cases get rid completely without getting everyone vaccinated. 
We ain't going smallpox polio one - there's many vaccine resistant people, vaccines circulating wipe less economically well countries. Wonder Indian aka: Delta variant going devastating outside India? still refusing acknowledge difference past present.

There's really point us discussing further. We're never going agree. guys still talking COVID?  Exactly. never ask anyone they're want eat dinner. Conversation pointless. ask anyone anything.

OK, took advice entire year reading COVID-19. conclusion it’s new flu. live COVID forever, like previous strains, become another flu. Hopefully considered that. could happen.  Nepotism.

I've see pretty healthy 35 years die much 58 year old obese guys ton health problems. alternative vaccines, better. Especially works well. might miss vaccinating many first world countries middle lower income countries going fighting it. Oh, crazy chi. Vaccination pretty uneven though. absolutely zip codes like 15% vaccination rates. There's gonna flare-ups there. yet, probably now. Hopefully enough put hardship hospitals, elderly protected vaccines time. side effects immune system reacting vaccine.   even known originated Vietnam?   Smart- someone thinking less reason would say weren’t going get vaccine clot risk ignore bigger risk clots covid. Drives crazy!! Covid control pandemic, low amount vaccinations, think Vietnam really low level immunity overall. think people infected infected first time. Safety data robust

Just like Johnson Johnson shot...... market even bats pangolins destroyed argument.   devs know three Greeks letters though alpha, beta nightly Don’t ignore junk data? Listen know nobody wants hear spending day surrounded hundreds international strangers normal. normalized got infected immune need vaccinated again, yes much time?  Pretty irresponsible though  many ignorant nurses omg think lot comes getting vaccine something choose seek vs covid either hope won’t happen feel like wasn’t doing. That’s like phrase choice vaccine covid infection, you’re going hide infection forever choosing vaccinate choosing catch covid. People hesitant active choices. PSA: covid 19 linked erectile dysfunctional It’s surprising leap- plenty women (myself included) cycle changes COVID vaccine, since things like fever (or major immune system reaction) cause cycle changes. people looked would realize there’s evidence infertility, see rumor stuck.

Honestly hit nail head. lot people beginning pandemic asking PM going shorten week four days kinda laughed scoffed question think legitimate thing need rethink here. lot people unable afford take sick day. country big issue taxation. middle class destroyed foot taxpayers bill forces people work sick. 

I much better place now. make lot less money still recovering fatigue getting lot better, horrendous stomach acid anymore. enough people give shit unvaccinated still dying thousands.

How many unvaccinated choosing unvaccinated though - especially vulnerable age groups? people give shit largely getting vaccinated. Wooooah would’ve thought.... live society 😯😯😯 read opposite facebook.... realistically assume get COVID once. also based last year, approximately 10% US got COVID. say napkin math, all, even going try daily risks anything like that.

For age, took risk dying 65+ group (3200x higher 15-17) compared 18-29 30-45 group (10x 45x higher 15-17). Without checking numbers, assumed 25% deaths occurred 65+, leaving .25% deaths occurring 18-29 group.

So yeah, napkin math got errors. ultimate point really show go extremes reduce COVID 1 million even 1 100k risk death vaccine. weird little article. like starts fear based article. author decided put little disclosure end reminding people covid basically safe take mask. best friend’s mom got COVID week two ago. eligible vaccine since January, refused take vaccine.

Of course, Trumpist types knee-jerk reaction tried double ""Wuhanvirus"" worse names hate China ostensibly ""that's always done"", terrible argument.

The Coronavac vaccine strong prevent hospitalization death, would guess people's biggest concern, lol. Still, would appreciate message clearer extremely high % prevent infection; everybody check news coming USA, Europe, etc, see infection numbers (and deaths) decreasing quickly, using different vaccine, course different results.

Notes: 

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC's 2019 population data. They're looking 224 extra infections per day statewide (assuming 90% efficacy 75% vaccination) justification nearly entire extra year masking social distancing. 

At point need balance mental costs continued isolation. 

We 300,000 new infections single day (nationwide) January. see 224 infections (most greatly reduced severity due vaccines) justifies level continued public health policy.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Thankfully problem state (CA).

It pretty scary quickly became dominant UK despite good chunk population vaccinated. though current wave would probably much worse there.

edit: automod cancer. rewrite post several times stopped deleting alleged ""incivility"". good question.

Some hospitals still report deaths public holidays weekends, (it probably depends whether anyone admin days, registration services open).

So UK always lower average death figures weekends public holidays, higher death figure first full working day after.

Daily deaths really low right now. Yesterday's count 1 death, today's count 0. first weekend public holiday day we've 0 deaths reported, shows general situation going well. really good news.

But tomorrow likely deaths public holiday reported. really really hope 0 again, seems unlikely given usual trend.

Despite living primary color city cool rather warm color, still 32% vaccination, right par entire state's rate. sad. Great need do. would nice stop telling people need do. I'm certainly hoping lower dose. vaccine experience bad, first time considering going hospital head definitely suffering worst headache life. terrifying, esp given talk blood clots. Wuhan mass testing operation last year, tested everyone using pooled tests. sure hope so. info may outdated since mass testing occurred almost year point due control public spread.

In June 2020, relevant time China's mass testing public spread, 90 million tests spread travel though. local. proportion people interacting locally vs state visitors gargantuan. governor would implement shots shots program. Fun fact, flu always originates south-east asia. sure downvote; perhaps offended someone idea burden placed choose get vaccinated? don't--it's illegal ask vaccination status Florida. sign shut lawsuits case someone gets covid park files suit park claim following CDC guidance therefore liable. *Private business, choice!* there's morbidly obese woman ice cream stand yelling everyone step back put masks high risk group.

(I know experience) localized lockdowns necessary isolate clusters?  felt like kids weren’t even really affected much whole time! saying one 18 never got passed away it, felt like adults got worst 18. Sooooo I’m sure fine haha. one wants make argument want like pre COVID never even existed, that, good luck waiting world cure 😂  MERS-CoV gone away, still hanging around.

[There's 8 cases feeling lot world probably heavily counting No. insurance company's best interest people get vaccine. COVID-19 result long hospital stays long-term health problems. discount would less amount would save average person gets vaccinated. NYT reporting Georgia numbers providing proper county-level data. someone Georgia gets vaccinated list county simply gets reported state level dumb.


Georgia reporting vaccinations almost daily disease slowing adults getting vaccinated, become situation hard get enough data without performing studies countries low vaccination numbers high case numbers?  Ironically, us immune compromised family gone back vaccinated plus everyone masks meant feeling safety. return caution risk due others refuse get vaccinated wear mask. Covid life forever point... different way, like 1 year ago. Yep , order phone pick brave going inside restaurant ordering verbally cashier think one argument allow spread, mutations possible. potentially one resistant natural artificial immunities. Edit: stop wearing mask?

You don't. Wear want to. vaccinated unvaccinated evenly distributed? not, pockets unvaccinated easily become reservoirs. sounds overly cautious. General literature leaning towards asymptomatic carriers infectious. mostly unvaccinated, unvaccinated choice get give disease held responsible? Masks “lockdown measures.” haven’t seen anyone saying universal forced close. I’ve seen saying universal require masks. injected nose though?  likely misspoke  hahahha dang man cutting close! Copen rules though. before? lmao absurd. fair, even sub 3 months ago people saying 2022 2023 normalcy USA literally (or mid June latest). maybe NZ change quickly too--or maybe become 1600s Japan get cheaper free? know, let's return normal. Y'all got normalcy? /s flu vs. expected. got nearly 70% population without reliable supply March year, June 1st empty vaccination centres. were, outliers hardly relevant. last three months, Ontarians fighting book vaccination appointment. guess real question much vaccine waste, bet number super impressed. true MURICA moment. Absolute garbage followed brute force effort knocks park don’t blame hesitant that. likely we'll getting large 4th wave . Germany opening fast I'm terrified leave house , something last year . . Sizzler? idea still existed cannot close borders completely like Taiwan New Zealand.

Why not?

Which exactly happening Brazil. president sabotaging everything, state governors trying something. got vaccines state governors.

Having centralized plan action makes difference. Sorry hear. Yeah, keep reading Florida. COVID really helped show it’s dark sides…  Everything possible that’s bad always end

So. masks vaccinated, checking people actually vaccinated either. 
I guess everybody’s vaccinated! won’t become superspreader event, nooooo... relevant question person asks vaccinated?

Listen goddess everyone. /s avoid confusion, use regular numbers. course conservative states way bottom. lock borders bit honestly. Universal always walking petry dish cares.  Yea nurse I’m even gonna disagree. People like act like nursing school absurdly hard reason. literally studied night tests fine. It’s like it’s medical school something No. Post vaccination treat like flu maybe( shut schools workplace outbreaks). it’s hard know happens said vaccines effective. Maybe ring vaccination ? Let’s see Hawaii dedicated masks, isolated huge bonus favor means one drive Hawaii without regards rules. Sucks lol clusters likely rural parts country (where vaccination rates low) didn’t lock shit prevent spread things worst last year. They’re going lock small spikes rest country returned normal. They’re going deal consequences decisions.

This sounds like somebody would fear dihydrogen monoxide told anyone who’s ever ingested died.

You can’t fix stupid. Unless someone doesn’t want make cake someone, hire someone protected class, etc. feel like would result everyone goverment approves getting voted next cycle idea explored, think biggest impact must surely Peruvians simply can't afford socially distance. people can't simply take months work job home.

Multigenerational households intimate cultures also major impact. UK using mostly AZ vaccine many one dose. People get downvoted honest misunderstandings Reddit. blame bots. believe that. CDC get shit together enough declare airborne 8 months ago studies said was. want update guidance based last summer likely businesses like it. much trust CDC anymore.

Probably unfortunate timing. I'm sure that's true. healthy say teenagers risk death covid? Less 1/40k risk clots form AstraZeneca.
 I'm ranting authorities kept saying blanket statement risk vaccine lower covid. true depends individual basis. I'm vaccines happily got mine need honesty discussions.

Sure-nursing homes took large brunt initial deaths still young people susceptible. Vaccines arrived nick time less. Well depends long time frame you’re talking.

The risk accumulative, time goes likely exposed COVID, unless herd immunity happens, countries, aiming herd immunity dropped Immunity COVID 19 Probably depends company see point.

With numbers vaccinated 65, see virtually deaths unless vaccine studies weong fair, aren’t two related? virus ravaged huge amount people; ones likely die did, rest gained immunity. Vaccines don’t really need much work you’re starting baseline.

Apples Oranges. frame people lepers feel random stranger right information medical status.
 
Get vaccinated, go back living life. need act like creeper.

Stop trying twist agenda. want wear masks forever, that's fine. Society obviously want to, mandate going happen. Get you. Actually single dose mRNA vaccine quite poorly variants. 2nd dose pretty important. havent seen recent info, big remember wife pointing lot women ""birth control demographic"" high risk blood clots already 3 DVTs recent years.

I've separated fiancé year half Vietnam's border closing, still idea finally get start visa process. I'm fully vaccinated, I'd pay thousands quarantine full month could see her. Oh sure. fact that's did, preferred wait Pfizer instead taking AstraZeneca. using mRNA tech decades. new minds general public only. I’m sure many people terrified disease deeply denial it. bet stubborn partisan, unwilling publicly admit got vaccine, quietly getting themselves. People LIE!!  insanity Maybe needle-less injections? use thin high pressure jet medication penetrate skin without needing stabbed much larger steel needle.

The last needle-less injectors read jet size 34 gauge needle (0.15 mm). Standard vaccinations usually given 22-25 gauge needles (0.70 0.50 mm).

So think agree say case would pointless continue current mandates yet realize tinnitus result COVID severe long lasting enough people killed despair? provide cite Patches microneedles  ight I'm  easy cliches throw data much troubling that. Harrison County Gulfport Biloxi 29% vaccinated. Hinds isn’t much better 31%. We’re six months this. Large swaths population easy access shot declining get it. lot unvaccinated people already covid likely. fine get diminished still potent protection one dose, guarantee long protection last. anything would require full vaccination (like vaccine passports entry venues), qualify.

If muster it, I'd really recommend getting doses. afraid needles, know mRNA needles *extremely* thin someone cope injections well, Pfizer vaccinations easy could be.  There's plenty info both. last years become abundantly clear willful ignorance dangerous epidemic humans currently face. Wearing mask shouldn’t make kid vomit. reading/playing games? yes motion sickness likely.   question people. also recognize people feel much comfortable knowing people interact vaccinated. frame trusting vaccines ask whether people vaccinated. Yeah, state cool color, county surrounding counties southern half ruddy hue. made scary last winter, showing numbers vaccines. :( partially immune. It’s best get second shot. It’s even new technology though. It’s studied decades. Vietnam island, population ~100 million people 47 COVID deaths entire pandemic. turns government citizenry take pandemic response seriously, hundreds thousands people don’t die, US. You’ve one shot? you, would focus getting second shot moderna soon. doesn’t sound like something vaccine would cause.

This tinnitus joke, right? tinnitus long haul covid. would gladly trade last 6 months absolute hell slight tinnitus one ear vaccine. could get case mild covid long covid symptoms much worse tinnitus.  thought well. Covid deaths rough. I’m speaking strictly mRNA vaccines way operate it’s simply possible effects pop road. fat lipids deliver instructions gone within days. You’re literally teaching existing cells fight new infection vaccine gone. PR campaign explaining science teaches reasonable people probably already accept science enough gotten vaccinated. 

The people needs reach stick fingers ears scream belligerently. shit it’s one depressing things (tied masks political) I’ve ever heard something convince people believe. No. don’t. Full person crisis I’m hoping that’s soon 9 year old. He’s last one pod waiting vaccine! strategy injure badly enough need urgent care least every 10 years, stay caught boosters! mean alright, or... wash mask? Honestly case rates already low Cali, positivity rate mostly irrelevant now. data China July ,2020， 90 milllion June,2020, means 70 million tests taken one month.

Maybe u compare datas countries period. 

And think pandemic went .maybe would explain China didnot need much tests. use Astra Zeneca longer recommended women 40. seems like science work. 

Just get one mRNA based vaccines instead. seem fewer complications adenovirus types.  think that's saying. think saying vaccinated people, fairly well protected serious illness themselves, could still potentially carry spread. countries requiring vaccine proof entering could still potentially allowing Covid spreaders in.

I thought seeing good evidence transmission fully vaccinated people low, could wrong. It? article? No, mean like read lots things general. wasn’t telling read article. Must vary region. family member close friend nurses two different hospitals NC it’s always mandatory get flu vaccine. Learn read agree. read lawsuits well. ""Emergency Use"" seem necessitate nothing else stand place, ""An Emergency"". think people worries bar moved future, mandates become precedent. fine half million dead, long aren’t inconvenienced. Got it. Even though I'm anxious take vaccine shot since years ago early 2010s, happens take one dose Pfizer nothing else? Lol ok people lie 😂😂😂😂 joke research COVID-19 vaccine distribution. wanted know citizens Poland pay vaccine free them? Thanks everyone! can't get shot? people allergic. lose jobs?  people got vaccinated. refuse feel sage everyone shot
 mom got blood clots. I’m scared taking it. I’ 34 run lift weights 4 days week. eat super healthy. don’t feel scared get it. already got literally unnoticeable want infinity gauntlet vaccines :( virus reproducing (in infected humans), chances happen. single mutation jump top B.1.617.2. quite possibly even originate Vietnam (like original strain added onto), although could - lot less potential originate elsewhere. Stop stupid. dead simple random mutation plus natural selection. Two reasons crowded bars didn’t take long come back: 

1. Amazingly, vaccines incredibly effective. 

2. Sadly, enough people give shit unvaccinated still dying thousands. I’ve read actually rule stating can’t mandated emergency approval. It’s it’s never done before, whoever tries probably get sued. fact hospital TX sheriffs department NC mandated employees sued. outcome lawsuits help determine whether employers mandate it. Please repeat anecdotal stories heard fact. way verify this, comment removed. know it’s probably reporting issues due holiday, US hit lowest 7-day case average since start pandemic think that’s worth celebrating Oh, ""good chunk country"" must mean something different me. Since threw masks garbage weeks ago, single person - **not one** - asked I'm vaccinated.  That... actually sounds surprisingly competent politician.   Oh ho.... western media basically depicts shows poorest poor make guys think US ahead. India China growing threats.....soon 2030 overtake US. US mostly import economy.....good luck. find weird vaccine available states Florida Texas thing, cases never went up. Florida February free CNN showed. people wore masks others didn’t. People dropping dead. 99.7% survive. much ado nothing IMO  Nothing 100% effective. vaccines effective enough though risk covid falls neighborhood struck lightning.

Mind you, I've read studies clearly linking JJ AZ blood clots (because blood clots question different), seen anything similar Pfizer Moderna yet, albeit I've seen 4 million numbers.

Also, COVID much likely give long-lasting side effects vaccine, far know.  Every vaccine good. taken better efficacy vaccines available. really appretiate opinion.

[Here link number 1 - Previous text ^PM ^[\/u\/eganwall](http://reddit.com/user/eganwall) ^with ^issues ^or ^feedback! ^| ^|  can't? then? Yes, believe so. fully vaxxed, problem  I'm older you, I'd suggest. Get antibody test know. US, go lab buy them, countries I'm sure doc get one. negative - odds probably - may help decide. Since blood clots concern, also remember there's sort hierarchy risk - mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) far less risk AZ J&amp;J - low risks themselves.

It's also helped people consider they're vaccinated, things lot less worry - fly, sports stadiums, crowded restaurants, etc. mindf\*\*\* personally ""wow, again,"" ""wow, need mask now."" I'm going stores, restaurants, visiting parents, flying - list months.

I'm internet rando, that's take. Hope helps - good luck stay safe. people lucky people starving. Actually, personally, wearing masks West longer considered crazy, continue wear mask indoor permanently. Especially flu season, I'm sick myself.  

I've always wanted that, since I've lived Japan while, normal thing do. Western countries, entered bank post office mask, thought wanna rob it. Thankfully, socially acceptable people know why.  

Thanks wearing mask, sick flu 2 years. got paid nothing work got sick doctor's note even give part time work schedule entire letter written doctor. least could get benefits medical EI system, system sounds way better. quit end going fire found later one got sick wanted/needed less hours employer. Germany sounds better way tbh. Take Russia well example. Officially 120k covid deaths, excess mortality 460k.  America involved 3 those.

...With power money. look am, fortunately, rarely sick. six weeks employer pays normal salary. still sick health insurance pays 70% normal salary (before tax), 90% salary (after tax). would paid maximum 78 weeks. claim benefits. Anyone vaccine resistant need check critical thinking skills incorrectly informed. Andrew Wakefeild someone see mentioned lot talking vaccine resistant people. Hbomerguy great video vaccines. think people also forget fucking horrible disease like polio were. something personally upsets beacuse fiancée unable get ton vaccines, prick tested cause immediate flare up. problem way calculated though, covid die something unrelated like car crash, count covid case. even bother looking covid death numbers anymore covid positive test numbers.   UK around 350 people 65 die without underlying health conditions. sure happening are? IVM clearly huge step forward preventing overcrowding hospitals. Yet current vaccine EUA's void there's alternative viable treatment. Current situation however calls dual approach: first line early treatment IVM based medicine risk bad covid, building lonlasting broader (spike mutation proof) natural herd immunity, also novel vaccines risk bad covid, elderly, immunocompromized,... issue hand one global politics, one scientific healthcare. they're well, beginning. countries well accused lying. problem they're getting different shot, according new report, they'll slotted everyone else chance get shot.

With vaccine passports becoming thing summer, big advantages vaccinated change policy, means young people back queue start told wait even longer group boomer Karens wants everything done way. young people never even choice take vaccine. Many would've gladly taken AZ shot offered them.

The government initially said people refuse vaccine allocated would end queue vaccine choice. that's reasonable. government pressured revise policy.

Once again, inter-generational solidarity goes one way seems. impact vaccination programs totally see Covid suppressed heavily large swaths world basically back 2019 fall winter holidays 

Kind growing ""low-risk"" bubble forming long people moving countries there's restrictions deal with.

Then bubble kind grows there's many hotspots left later 2022   news, sky blue.

P.S. news good reaffirmation reduce vaccine hesitancy. AFAIK, Moderna Pfizer nigh zero risk bloodclots. Americans actually grasped essence simple cause/effect practiced things we'd huge reduction seasonal flu deaths, complications, hospitalizations, health-related costs (as well uptick economic productivity), we'd shot distilling Covid19 population period years. People want simple things, doubt it.

Let's fair, hygiene world-wide problem.

It's far difficult get people wash hands. Covid-19 Skull Skull Text document Lucky get kind financial compensation missed work? see working way. live Canada unfortunately good days long past here. past amazing, residential schools example bad got..... probably. 

except maybe places like Western Australia death toll 9 total, vaccinations 3% population two people hospital blood clots AstraZeneca right now.  

I'm waiting Pfizer rollout. think afraid give immunity. Germany. oxygen means doubling tripling fatality rate COVID-19.  tinnitus half year really bothered anymore really get better.  capacity oxygen support, IFR goes lot. US least, people admitted admitted need oxygen support, high number would died without it. We'd looking 1.5 - 2 million dead without oxygen. sorry sir ignorant?
You told strain hands receiving shot maybe long feel arm still sore. big deal? Wearing mask doesn’t need political statement, people don’t mind wearing one even don’t to. This. would worked done start. creates confusion since means additional name thing. Given tremendous amounts publications using old names likely get updated late replace existing names completely. freedumbs liberties. Might boil fact that, theres money made Ivermectin solution.

Less polution less driving, believe people perform better home less corporate competition, less sick days, less costs employer, heating, less buying renting buildings, less use electricity, less internet costs etc)., less burnouts stress. It´s win win... shocked pikachu face country sounds amazing.  Regions India saw decline upto 92% hospitalizations, implementing first line healthcare. outbreaks rampant people symproms getting tested, given IVM already got test results. Early treatment covid key preventing hospitalization.

This early treatment IVM also rolled Mexico city, results upto 75% less hospitalization. Seems covid much treatable, yet countries still first line healthcare, although 've living deadly pandemic year we're still telling positive testing people nothing quarantine, infection multiplying untill necessary get hospitalized.  would wait 50s vaccinated whole population? Even European countries going reopen fully then. News like makes think upcoming Christmas season restriction-free traveling visiting friends family. Yay. #1 mass vaccination effort. 

Nope, UK Israel win that. live society. issue personal health. let virus ping people mutate, COVID continue issue.

Herd immunity via vaccination talked versus vaccines personal protection, even though provide both. Removing virus vector true goal.

Wow sub really dying lol. daily discussions aren’t even getting 300 comments throughout whole day, large majority new posts getting like 10 comments (if even that).

It kind sad though seeing far positive articles negative, articles aren’t really getting much attention. good sign sub slowing down. That’s fair, though don’t think ever takes position vaccine-resistant variants can’t develop. Though think majority consensus among Jha, Gottlieb, likes also unlikely event. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Probably looked total ""noob"" point would logically come conclusion expose body example 5 sicknesses time immune system harder time learning remembering what. hand expose body one sickness time immune system time ""power"" learn it. 

But probably immune system works, even seems logical me. Yep. Concern trolling, largely originating salty teenagers don’t want forced back classrooms radical introverts looking forward societally required socialize again. Trials kids 5-11 conclude year’s end. final phases started. Kids 5 probably get ok early 2022. 

Safety trials super conservative. start adults progressively inch younger age groups. Adults, teens, tweens, grade school kids, babies toddlers get tested it’s cleared everyone else. Actually CureVac already mass producing certain level right ahead approval. Depending production levels might able deliver millions doses day one July would still useful 18-34. 

And also stored lower temperatures rest world needs billions doses don’t think CureVac late party. look India Ivermectin.

Using ventilators frequently god damn tragedy. haven’t. They’re steadily declining. they’re lagging metric. No, won’t, areas 60-70% prior infection rates. mild flu year kill half million people United States, despite extraordinary measures fight it. notice almost influenza past year. care? vaccinated affect you. unvaccinated wearing mask affect you. unvaccinated wearing mask clearly care. think would long term lung issues someone becomes breakthrough case moderate symptoms?   said  Uh duhhhh may planing change/alter HISTORY frame whole europe near future catch covid year also catch cold flu first time ever. I'm going always wear mask way now, probably crowded areas like shops I'll keep sanitising hands. bad habit like idea getting sick less.  Isn’t supposed obvious? guess it’s sad reports like need done.

It’s like report saying “Kevlar safer Kevlar get shot” Make sure loved ones get vaccinated. late help anyone else. wear fucking mask. drama. Fuck no-maskers. Period. Darwin’s law prevail. People ugly anyway. Can’t wait hear latest COVID19 Omega Foxtrot  It’s excellent, straight up. favorite venue LA easily. Yeah it’s crowded, could be. It’s giant concert venue. great comparison. actually work industry requires latex gloves among things. nurse site treat reactions. also offer alternative allergic latex. 

The road afraid could lead company right mandate course treatment take different medical condition future. even eat ""benifit health"". 

Many Companies operating little issues covid past year. would need mandate vaccine now? continue operate have? people can't get vaccinated number medical reasons, people WONT get vaccinated putting risk. That's herd immunity works. people made arguments continue make bad faith.   want care people outside ""me mine"" seems completely lost people like this. cool. I've always wanted go Bogota. I've heard little rough lately south america really rough time overall lately. That's awesome, fun. Meanwhile, Brazil, best-known variant known locally either ""the Brazilian variant"" ""the Manaus variant"" ""fashy"". new favorite word now. Herd immunity. dont see anything wrong language here, since used encourage. think I've seen consequences vaccine play years I'd okay getting reason. 

Consider this. put risk someone else high risk? likely high risk covid things well. unfair put healthy people risk? Yeah, bit fucking late. every news source say ""the delta variant (indian variant)"" people know they're talking about, totally defeats point it.  
 
You would think would've idea back pocket pandemic even started. mean sorts situations surely thing spent time preparing for. Makes sense. want get it. I'm weary them. posts see would indicate one dose bad side effects people. looks like game changing solution India desperately need arrived problem personal lived experience.

My admittedly small personal experience seen every friend family member vaccine get severe side effects lasted weeks. many hospitalized friends Covid.

My experience enough valid sample, it’s enough make pause, worry. know woman got ill Covid, still refuses get vaccinated. Going far call ""lethal injection"". people willfully ignorant there's cure that. work grocery store times not, another person leaving I’m going restroom, didn’t wash hands 🤮 sad, although 43,000 number based estimate one model, want see data confirms figure.

For anyone reads this, you’re adult dependents, need adequate life insurance. families article facing loss homes, cars, children’s education, etc. 100% preventable life insurance, isn’t necessarily expensive. pretty fine line draw, take account spread virus others also mutation rate. dad epidemiologist says people either get covid get vaccine. variants it’ll hard avoid it. Besides peer pressure convenience/availability, havent lot prisons significant outbreaks? perhaps also plays role. effects virus visible person, they're probably likely take threat seriously. least likely time get it. People say ""oh, unvaccinated sure get COVID *now*"" understand important exposure risk is. 

While COVID local phenomenon every city even area within city different, taking national numbers, average person 7-10X likely get COVID month January month May. Even accounting fact unvaccinated, 3-5X likely get January May (since almost cases un unvaccinated ""subtract"" vaccinated population per capita risk). 

Exposure risk trumps vaccine efficacy day week. late summer, areas highly vaccinated (e.g. New England) safer unvaccinated Massachusetts vaccinated Mississippi cases almost nonexistant Massachusetts due (near) herd immunity. exposure risk 20X higher, benefit vaccine effectively neutralized (unfortunately moreso vulnerable populations efficacy lower). 

This vaccinations important. Pawning saying ""the unvaccinated taking risk"" true, also impacting others. good thing vaccines effective age groups risk becomes trivial, change fact anti-vaxxers affect everyone living around - get benefit around vaccinated people (lower exposure risk) contribute exposure risk all. understand still commented every thread this. people vocally anti-vax ones refusing wear masks begin with. mandates, lifting such, people would act responsibly people getting vaccinated, less necessary them. vast majority people, going matter since plague rats likely spread people vaxxed, able vaccinated extremely immunocompromised probably going Universal places anyway. Fuck anti-mask morons, guidelines functional people. boat, went thankfully didn’t bad side effects. 

You might bad side effects, even small chance getting really sick covid it’s still worth chances bad case covid high enough two doses vaccine still smart have. 

Also it’s good piece mind you’re way less likely transmit someone else, don’t quarantine two weeks exposed, get benefits fully vaccinated like wear mask, side effects worth it. Selfish sure. true.??? chile mostly coronavac cases still high expect see vaccine move “emergency use” since many waiting full FDA approval? Probably anecdotal unverifiable info easily spread misinformation. Anecdotally say know women got pregnant getting vaccinated. also say anecdotally I’ve gotten period since shot. would leave I’m breastfeeding haven’t period long vaccine existed though! could say whatever want without sources facts. would think helpful post would “show scholarly research articles fertility COVID vaccine”.

I think it’s important continue discussion risks benefits. Nothing without risk even though dread bad news vaccine don’t want solid research data ignored. forget math hard people. think try kill International travel? places makes sense implement. America always right thing exhausts options. external travel. 1,222 people flu since October country ~340,000,000?

*spits* good since lot anti-vaxxers use argument vaccines safe. Didn’t think needed article prove this? Lol yeah still mask mandate. sure haven’t gotten used wearing one now. hope helps them! That’s great problem have. Hopefully vaccine uptake remains high. Nope hang around post cringe conspiracy day.  Thanks. That’s helpful. Unlikely yesterday public holiday fewer deaths reported. Deaths happened Saturday, Sunday, Monday likely reported tomorrow (Wednesday). Japan spend time protesting lack vaccine access rather Olympics. basically fault vaccine hesitancy too.  dOnT kNoW LoNg TeRm EfFeCtS Definitely sub. Even among science fans, frustratingly common.

Spoiler alert, be. similar situation you, actually got normal cold haha. forgot actually get colds. immune system probably weak point think needed it. ""follow organizer here, signups were, notify future events too. Possibly - likely cover variants. expecting new release towards Autumn.

The University hospital work start research 3rd vaccination. already 2 doses (as nearly health workers UK), asking give third, different vaccine - see if, much improves overall immunity. think currently 7 different vaccines consideration (including Pfizer AZ widely used here) Correlation equal causation. Get shot. incredible think nearly 2000 deaths per day start year. vaccination effort first class. UK lowest vaccine hesitancy world result. sincerely wish rest Europe wider world similar results ASAP. Ah, ok makes sense. kind person want buried mask dead. ask that. thinking approved. “No vaccine ever fully approved fast” bs like  understand, full FDA approval takes minimum amount time, flexibility speed up. 

Yes, needed trails need fixed amount EUA, however skip speed efficacy safety evaluation required garner FDA approval.

Exaclty, that's critizesed use ""without shadow doubt"" talking vaccines. Like, that's comment was. think public schools legally require it’s fully approved We've multiple bank holidays since start pandemic today first day 0 deaths. Can't wait life get back normal. dare try manipulate silence? I'm telling anyone get vaccinated, I'm saying important consider fact impossible know long term side effects vaccines. 

We consider possibilities. That's yhe scientific method. following whatever popular moment. think working around clock limited number experts, workers time. Here’s discussion approval vaccines 8 months ago:[Coronavirus Vaccine Update FDA – October 5, us: common sense

To others, fail think long-term: article lie Nice Hopefully, realistically there'll atleast few.   Man, hope things turn around Chile soon.

Medics would stand vaccines, nobody vaccinate, province let vaccinate people 55. 

I can't find right now, one local pharmacist tweeted 53-year-old plumber dude literally cried little young receive AstraZeneca vaccine, pharmacist's hands tied. early stage vaccine rollout tyrannical, counterintuitive, terribly executed.

My argument choose vaccines get, ones wont control health wont take vaccinations unless deem necessary health. That's it. you’re already (fully-) vaccinated, shouldn’t affect all. Continue live life.

I'm saying justified true belief knowledge, even true belief yet justified cannot called knowledge, scientific beliefs empirically verified (almost?) never justified degree call knowledge. sort context, anyway.

That's experiments analyses done.

So matter I'm smart medical researcher not. matters can't claim know result research done yet, even case educated guess likely turn right.

For reason, yahoos whining err side caution (especially last year) need learn basic epistemology. German here. first time ever decided EU this. Usually healthcare stuff like 100% national level.

But limited supply vaccines would ended Germany far richest nation buying vaccines small poor EU nations getting nothing. decided pool money together let EU order us.

Of course means Germany got beginning less could got ordered alone. situation whole EU project would exploded, headlines nations like „those greedy Germans!“ on. Doesn’t matter. gets additional 5% people get it, would huge got vaccine. worried future now. risk vs reward time. Hopefully made right decision. use anecdotes degree.i see problem long lead harmful behavior. It’s supply issue Pfizer. Y’all enough AZ get much vaccinated are. 

It’ll six months wait Pfizer/Moderna/Novavax shots. Again, literally said ""before giving meat"" confirming anything. Literally proved 1. judgements hastily made proof 2. excuse forcing people go vegan. actively taking advantage people's deaths force beliefs throat. That's definitely bad taste next day hesitant. side effects (including tinnitus) cleared entirely within month. Totally worth it. 1) I'm sure need story like motivate people help contact tracing...seems found plenty motivation own
2) Yeah, see would motivate someone. ""Hey, I'd urge help people health department. lady refused help them, made example outing her. destroyed career. absolutely cooperate them"" /s much hate rush hour traffic, I'm looking forward getting back office mid-July. Tell nanorobot one (or use someone else's, I'm sure better analogies there). 

Or, better yet, keep simple, cells use many ways send receive messages, mRNA send message make vaccine message destroyed. sincerely wish rest Europe wider world similar results ASAP.

Portugal regularly days 0 Covid deaths reported, doesn’t even make news more. wish they'd let vaccinated travelers US fuss. bit annoying providing context number hospitalisations etc. widespread vaccination hope/goal becomes manageable risk (like cold) really disappears entirely. 

If people getting potential new 'wave' getting hospitalised, that's massive thing acknowledge route normality. Even pretty debatable point (in US vaccinated countries). Vaccines really knocked wind COVID's sails, there's good reason expect covid range flu forward regard deaths hospitalizations.
 
The vaccines good made ""covid worse flu"" crowd correct.. took year lot bad times get here. No, know it. know lipids deliver mRNA instructions immune system gone within days. Therefore lipids causing side effects year. Yeah, continue monitor safety ongoing basis. information part goes applying BLA along specific information manufacturing quality controls forth. think Offit wrong per se, think he's dumbing things bit sake getting public understand urgent messaging, vaccines proven safe. Thanks guess scenario road, year two. vaccine literally system within couple days, vaccine causing side effects ""down road."" And, say I'm wrong, I'd still take chance COVID find long COVID mild cases. accept Sinovac legitimate vaccine, approve usage. might implies causation: mask reason colds. don’t see could isolate variable much extreme one isolation. Yeah, countries done pretty detailed studies. China’s vaccines legitimate. Philippines presidential adviser Joey Concepcion, coordinating vaccine procurement Philippine government private sector, told Reuters AstraZeneca **had informed delivery first batch 1.3 million doses would pushed back third week June mid-July also reduced 1.17 million doses.**

I'll give AstraZeneca, incapable meet targets anywhere, Europe. One point consistency. Amazing news   INDOOORSS he's wrong. He's ass

I interpret comments mean referring situation specifically, rather covid generally. case, absolutely wrong, ass. sounds good. 'll leave though. US wasted 180,000 shots May 5 care enjoy summer. clear? Chris Witty describes Sars2 mainly seasonal virus. true test vaccine rollout autumn/winter. numbers today better last summer without vaccine program.

Which, far I’ve read every epidemiologist I’ve come across, uncorked bottle won’t able reseal. goal isn’t eradication, keep masking? Vaccines readily available, hospitals good. would protecting people refusing vaccine eventually get Covid time.

It seems request others keep masking based science; headlines point many people dead total, won’t point vaccines. That’s negligible difference. interpret mask request instead people wanting retroactively *be respectful* people already died. get good faith intention, read articles like this, need demand people get vaccinated never happens due Covid, vaccinated people wear mask.

[Yeah, Canada also poised overtake UK terms single doses administered per that's spite Canada limited access vaccines early on. Glad experienced minor symptoms hope feeling better! Yeah man. really want live post covid world cells use many ways send receive messages, mRNA send message make vaccine message destroyed.

There go! like analogy India take long long time. atleast year away this, assuming vaccine resistant strain develop. also combat vaccine hesitancy, people like lala ramdev best spread vaccine hesitancy too. I’m denying shit. stores live dropped mask requirement, live area historically pretty strict covid restrictions. Right April fools day surge?!?! think vaccine efficacy means? 95% efficacy means exposure risk 20X higher risk infection someone unvaccinated area 5% exposure risk faced with.

There asterisks protection binary many cases since know side binary line face moot point, least short run. We’d need put numbers that. can’t create policy based extreme outlier situations. saying that’s case here, need data determine that. good resources share vaccine hesitant people? Testing scarce, decline testing would indicate decline symptoms. People aren’t going get tested hell it.

What? I'm conservative suburb north Austin, TX, tons anti-vaxxers here. got walk across street kids preschool get vaccine April free.

It readily available now, day next day.

Technology problem, ignorance disinformation is, again, Texas evidence based science usually takes back seat fear, greed conspiracy regarding health/good public policy general. lost sense smell taste, there’s that. interesting, thank others said protective immunity vaccines, even one dose, remains strong.

I'm trying understand means precisely. understand 1 dose ""less half effective B.1.617.2"" referring risk catching covid severe consequences are? aware evidence one dose reduces severity variant specifically?

Or extrapolating variants even though risk catching variant may higher one dose (compared variants) severity expected high?

I'd like interject moment. referring Pfizer vaccine, fact, BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, I've recently taken calling it, BioNTech plus Pfizer vaccine. Pfizer develop vaccine itself, rather another company called BioNTech came original formula trialed Pfizer become vaccine know today.

Most people injected vaccine refer Pfizer vaccine every day, without realizing it.
Through peculiar turn events, BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine widely used today often called ""Pfizer"", many recipients aware basically vaccine BioNTech developed initially.

There really Pfizer contribution vaccine, people injected it, part vaccine given. Pfizer distributor responsible running clinical trials. clinical trials essential part vaccine, useless itself; function developed first place. Hence, Pfizer vaccine work developed first place BioNTech: whole vaccine basically BioNTech Pfizer contributions, BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. so-called ""Pfizer vaccine"" really called BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine. animal food industry health hazard think ever meant long term solution.

There evidence previous infection antibodies last years that, statement last three months completely wrong longest parts vaccine approval process phase 3 efficacy trials. take 10 years get enough infections placebo group. vaccines developed something isn’t common widespread. pandemic, amount time takes determine efficacy accelerated greatly. haberdashery good sir page showing much vaccine China using? Survey survey showing people want return fully back office. unfortunate businesses lose out, lot areas office space converted homes make much vibrant city businesses benefit even from. Guns, Trucks &amp; Cash West Virginia super group coming soon radio near 2 factories whole EU, surely that’s fault building enough. situation rely UK, especially since left EU? UK isn’t obliged give vaccines rest Europe. feel like high vaccination rate, lots friends either vaccinated fear covid / long covid others want travel. doesn’t matter take vaccine, I’m glad uptake much higher expected. make sure panic new variants though right? force arrest someone violence anyway

And resist someone touching manhandling without consent? I'm priority group still able get one (either doctor vaccination centre). distribution seems patchy. urban centers ones likely need it. rural less air-spit strangers you’ll ingesting less you’ll contributing people’s mouths.

I think it’s bad assume inoculation prevents spread equally different population densities.

It might taboo say it, it’s probably less necessary rural peeps vaccinate. There’s less “do around you” claim, there’s one around you. already traveled church town already immunity. Unlike countries US isn’t counting infection recovery inoculated.

At point, people going hesitant catch covid instead vaccine. Unless vaccine legally mandatory, still choice. think main criticism CDC's announcement. rushed vague, give enough guidance states companies adapt it. think many said get 70% adults. think many (myself included) think we'll get July 4th - math work out. 75% adults challenging milestone hit, especially talk fully vaccinated (state-dependent states 5-10% folks getting second doses). 

Unfortunately every Vermont Mississippi.   exactly. seem irritated people saying really next 12 months data show successful vaccination program been. never said helped. unreasonable think 12 months data covers winter give clearer picture. aimed swear users shares Pfizer...just joke get angry. public holidays, though, it’s still significant zero deaths reported time. Isn’t employer? Mid end july FDA needs look data analyze give full approval. That's understanding least.

And that's process take 6 months try fast track. Moderna data within month. enough things though. Like visiting EU USA someone vaccinated Sinovac. 2021-06-01 USA Vaccination demographics update

Honestly reason Im wearing one stores little longer.

There order Australian developed vaccine, work out.

There Australian produced AZ (plus AZ imports), delivering slower planned 50s. supply continue increase.

There also Pfizer, currently short supply. order get signed somewhat late, Australia delivery list.

I recall Moderna ordered too.

Also slow uptake even vaccination became available. able book GP days first became eligible. wait list GP increased 2 3 weeks, plenty times available.

The latest outbreak saw number vaccinations per day increase 2 3 fold quickly, think supply constrained. 

Some eligible AZ may waiting Pfizer since international travel local transmission low zero. c19 snuck quarantine started spread, vaccination suddenly became higher priority. Actually AstraZeneca might main player story. vaccines produced Siam Bioscience. Siam Bioscience owned royal family. Thailand illegal say anything bad royal family.

""Isnt better vaccinate world whole instead countries stop variants?""

While know probably lamenting situation would actually argue may best way handle it. Herd immunity (or effective herd immunity R&lt;1 cases go decline) requires high level immunity within population. lets say example vaccinate world equally ever country 30% population vaccinated. would lead reduction cases anywhere since country would enough immunity drive R value 1. actual best case scenario would over-vaccinate hardest hit areas virus spreading order drop R value places focusing areas lower case loads. that's either since everything world based money could make argument vaccinating US quickly bad thing world. Though yes would want send vaccines India, Brazil, etc (which exactly going happen) something confirmed can't accept fact right?

Right. Considering something fact requires high quality evidence confirm. 

This fundamental tenet critical scientific thinking. foundational building reliable accurate base knowledge.

If find confusing, may direct read Carl Sagan's ""A Demon-Haunted World"" particularly Part 1 think may help explain little better. example dragon garage really gets it.

Example: tell teapot orbiting sun orbits mars earth believe it? provide high quality evidence (or even low quality evidence) proving there. Without proof, reason believe actually exists. Otherwise would believe every statement, matter ridiculous.

And would unable tell fact fiction would unable build body knowledge led scientific advancement many people felt COVID confirmed threat 

Well, let interrupt right there. 

What people ""feel"" reliable source knowledge; feelings constitute evidence. 

High quality evidence COVID-19 obtained scientific method subject process scientific peer review quite clearly established fact COVID-19 therefore accept taking preventative measures, also justified, right?

No, epistemology severely flawed. call alpha vaccine 😉 confuses alpha-delta represent big variants, epsilon taken. happens there's another big variant? can't epsilon. People need put reason ahead fear. That's evolution. makes sense Biontech/Pfizer expand production capacity Europe rather US, limited effort trade freely due DPA. ...because there's 3 day weekend, there's always lapse weekends...and we're weeks behind. yeah...whatever :| good... would nightmare. Next pandemic lot people would hesitant get vaccinated. seems pessimistic given news consistent overdelivering OK, wait see guess. Yes know, said deliver less Q3 unless bring forward 1.8B doses Fair enuf. ironically, incurable cancer. Uncertainty way life I've accept it, die waiting perfect solutions. meantime, waiting vax certainty allows covid variants develop endanger greater population. Individual fears outweigh needs populations.

Sometimes wonder doubters simply suffer life imagine deserves level certainty? 

Also I've read studies counter argument I'm qualified quantify results. Today people stop wearing masks streets crowded like pandemic. think 3 weeks lock down.again. Yeah

A lot things study claiming add look massive decline infections we're seeing nationwide even current vaccine coverage level add Chile vaccine distributed minority population, **we might even see surges magnitude seeing prior vaccines noted vaccine coverage approached **75%** simulations, saw level infection decline.
Just half adult population US **40% total population fully vaccinated**, according latest CDC data.  UK variant less issue symbolically, harder identify Brit crowd generally 'others' list average American South Asians perhaps are.

Sure help rep countries USA though. people kept pointing Florida success story, highest cases every day month now? need Moderna x Kirkland collab Chicken Bake also protects H1N1 I've seen newest hbomberguy video antivaxx movement. guy basically started making shit study UK. started UK recovered incredibly well highest vaccination willingness now. wish countries could learn recovery. hope helps you, also think OK take little time. I've fully vaxed since like end April I'm still going crowded spaces awhile yet. See friends house? Sure. restaurants, movies, etc little longer yet me. Hang there, things start feel normal time goes on. I'm thinking samples eat in-store. Costco toyed around several ideas pandemic. getting whole, undivided samples things like empanadas cans soda.

It looks like 2019 country still less 20,000 new cases day nationwide dropping I'd curious see people double check team's math one  Physical force detain someone = violence. think need [educate I'm still cautious. restaurants except last week first time since Feb 2020, movies, etc. Changes take time. I'm also waiting case numbers officially go well March 2020 surge. we're averaging 8-10k cases day less, I'll start feel comfortable. bet many others boat. probably downvoted spreading inaccurate information (that numbers better time last year) rather said data good thing (which true).

That’s like said “Cases generally going around world, Earth flat.” I’d get downvoted comment, would people disagree second part comment, first. getting downvoted wouldn’t mean people think cases aren’t going down. would mean people don’t think world flat. 

Likewise, people don’t think data bad thing. People downvoting comment saying something objectively wrong. combo pizza hope Right, think we're agreement here. Partnerships often marketing deal, case vaccine production two companies much tied hip. much prefer overly cautious alternative. I've happy see people bit hesitant change back ""old normal.""

Hopefully one time thing frankly, suppose better happened month later overexerted like... blizzard 9 months later...how bad would then? 

But seriously. wonderful thank asked legitimate question…..love Reddit. Let’s forget selfish people though. could totally see trashy anti-vaxer saying whatever get want bragging lying. Another poster actually mentioned happening “Vaccinated Section” ball game.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Have questions vaccines? Check bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Vaers basically Wikipedia. Anyone put anything. tells adverse event happened vaccination (if they’re telling truth begin with). doesn’t give evidence vaccine caused event. Could complete coincidence. bit, still vulnerability can't ruled anyone yet Obituary, news story, etc. people bringing vaccine, pretty much reason we’re opening up

One thing I’d like note well we’re significantly better detecting Covid compared before.

We’re likely significantly fewer cases despite official total same. Yeah, sucks arse. 

Next time disease impacts adults elderly I'm making kid wear mask. sure care safety kids can't get vaccinated yet. cousin's 12 year old died covid like 6 months ago. 

I'm Florida frustrating. finally gave quit wearing masks weekend kept getting screamed wearing one. figured we're likely get murdered anti-masker kid likely die Covid. 

I explain weekend safer wear mask since men keep yelling threatening wearing mask. like, sorry baby, catch covid get murdered wearing mask grocery store. proof people want someone’s story? Obituary? get signed?

Seems easy way scammers replicate fake cards signature required. not. Expecting released FDA soon. Crossing fingers time week. Yes. I’m sure people want interact coworkers…  Measles cause sterilization males. Never heard measles vaccine causing it. eleven. point significantly reduces risk death complications COVID. Seems pretty clear me? think important takeaway study CoronaVac good, mass vaccination bring pandemic control reduce deaths cases. I'm sure repeated Pfizer AstraZeneca, results would similar. Covid 19 part six... time nothing!! That's secret, 2heads1shaft... I'm always angry. It’s free.  get idea? Th governments insurance companies footing bill. vaccine USA costs 20-45 per dose. Plus salary providers employees working. 

When pandemic it’s serious illness, might pay. thought r/noshitsherlock Sounds like mom victim disinformation campaign. needs context. risk death say AstraZeneca higher young healthy person area cases? Yes.  US excel anything fixed power money data though. people reporting think might related vaccine. Plus anti vaxxers falsely reporting time. news, ice cold human need water survive.

It’s truly sad need kind news antivaxers yet won’t even help, all. Got real numbers death covid? compare bro, dont. 
Covid: 3.54 million dead.
Covid vax deaths US: 4,863 285 million Bingo! How's vaccination campaign going? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Have questions vaccines? Check bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* quick read, good things bad things say.

\-Unless missed it, implication get COVID vs. get vaccine, vaccine safer, PLENTY people planning skipping vaccine basically waiting everyone else get it, presumption they'll mask forever dodge it. 

\-The good thing: data criticize VAERS (basically adverse vaccine deaths) likely even overestimates deaths vaccinated greatly study points out. massive amount people died getting vaccinated result COVID, either fully vaccinated yet time exposure, actually suspected exposed several days prior getting vaccine (which seems offer pretty good protection post exposure pre symptoms iirc studies correctly) What's known long term effects COVID? Oasis really arbitrary metaphor here, it? They’ve 2-3 days behind Universal every lifted restriction far, so, I’m betting will. ""Because Emergency Use Authorization COVID-19 vaccines, healthcare providers bear legal responsibility reporting serious adverse event following use. includes deaths among vaccinated individuals, even clearly unrelated vaccine. Then, CDC FDA investigate death report determine whether might associated vaccine."" I'd like see report. Great idea. Reducing barriers help. dick short news, water found wet! 11 Yep make new fashion statement. Honestly something think adopting feel ill. literally proven reduce transmission, kinda key point. say want wear mask feel ill essentially saying want protect people arround help reduce chance spreading whatever someone. sound little extreme sure, factor mask really protect effective reducing ability spread disease becomes something others. fine honest say really give fuck someone gets sick cuss you.

Edit: edited Grammer cuss can't write cohesive sentence without making glaring mistakes. I’m mind, people mask compliant getting vaccine. people getting vaccine going majority Covid deniers anti-vaxxers. 

There outliers legitimately don’t feel comfortable getting yet, people can’t get medical reasons, course they’ll likely wear masks still. 

I could wrong, overall think people want vaccine gotten now. Ok thanks good hear Moderna started exporting US week ago. can't find article listed Canada announcement they've begun exports

Pretty damn encouraging see well 200 comments. pandemic effectively US. financially cripple overnight 101 Good news, things keep trending way are, sub dead next year. really bizzare knew day we'd see pandemic changes brought rapidly fade would come pass nobody expected soon 

Especially country got hit bad US  thing excess stockpile month demand fallen significantly there. receive 500k week, delivery next week 1.5m week after, suddenly turn around? I'm hoping pattern changed really now. might able commit global commitments even US supply. 

We might get lucky mid june turnaround point signs far. Anita Anands statement 'millions' also promising along several statements made Moderna would likely make target.

Talking procurement, still seen proper J&amp;J vaccines delivered? 

Fingers crossed major Q2 end push I'm convinced. friend’s friend refuses get vaccine. black, doesn’t trust medicine, says doesn’t want foreign stuff body he’ll get forced take it.

If dies suffers long-term effects getting it, fault. care idiots? might small swell like get Flu winter vaccines available long going mask lock bad like restaurant announcing refuse serve customers wash hands. 2 days ago, 177. lot. true also true news 44 deaths cause national celebration evidence many indicators headed encouraging direction. 44 families, numbers tragic. nation Italy, spirit lifter. two realities exist together without contradictory.

THANKS Uh oh. going violate privacy demanding proof non-vaccination? What's equivalent HIPPA* UK?

^* deliberate misspelling.  20% get within 6 months. seeds mean spores brain fungus Haha fun first got kind boring. Clearly someone know wants keep wearing mask little overly sensitive it. I'm sorry got offended. Peace love.  Source we’re getting moderna shipments us? know pfizer didn’t hear moderna I'm expecting uptick I'm guessing unvaccinated people behaving vaccinated. think big enough consider ""wave"" many people vaccinated, reached herd immunity yet. Yay! Hope means we’ll get 2nd shots sooner. 31.6% fully vaccinated, another 8.7% first dose. 
It seems supply blocked though, rather issue demand.
We vaccinated pretty much front liners, 75% seniors (the PM seemed imply might problem understanding work system.)  think that? US production facilities Moderna well, produced 125 million doses within US. supplied plant instead Europe there's little reason think meet commitments. plant produces close 1.5 million doses per day, 3 days would cover remaining shipments US significant excess vaccine stockpile (70 million counting) there's little reason it'd held up. Rolling lockdowns vs this...and people actually think better. rare confirm, greater reported numbers. prove reinfection, need genetic comparison prove they're different strains, relapse previous infection. actually keep lot samples beginning pandemic, making reinfection really hard prove.

Not everyone risk reinfection, course, newer variants seem increasing likelihood it, depending strain  President Jair Bolsonaro mounted largest protests since beginning pandemic, suggesting new volatility next yearâs elections.  suspect boyfriend got twice, think first time worse him. 10 months apart. got Moderna vaccine today. Decided might well get I'm delaying inevitable since mother immune deficiency virus I'm obligated protect woman brought world. I'll deal potential complications later road. Spend much time connecting loved ones never know next word speak final words. love mom. really something need lol recommend vaccination seems greater threat reinfection earlier strains newer variants.

The vaccines bit effective natural immunity point targeting specific part virus, whole strain. variants shown escape natural antibodies, makes important previous covid cases get vaccinated  Complete waste time. I'm sure better things renaming ""offensive"" variants. Agree seen astounding amount repeating mistake within companies. countries fields better others sure, keep going back India due tech even though getting work done company needs. ends bad unvaccinated fools care anyone kind predicting came pandemic survival instincts longer numbing pain we'd mental health crisis hit like storm bricks really see fall. Right now, we're heading summer, last year definitely gave reason believe there's seasonal component covid. Areas lower levels vaccination going see low, persistent spread, possibly getting little worse height summer weather forces people inside bit more. school year, however, big test spread grow. problem media keeps putting crap saying possible vaccine protect variants completely false people read fees mongering headlines  oh sorry didn’t know needed bring 3rd grade comprehension level. 170 million dead yeah great humor there. “masks dumb dumb force smell breath :(((((“ You’re putting words mouth lol Yeah son literally 2 weeks vaccine appointment What's McDonalds waiting for? Can't enjoy big mac inside yet Oh know vaccination pregnancy, vaccine simply wasn’t available baby utero. Yep

She'll carve nice little stable regulars anti-vaxx community keep afloat right, justify logic, UK would need reduce number daily tests occur, see significant tapering testing daily charts (below). Yet saw pretty sizable decline daily cases initially, increase opened country.  
You're wrong less testing = less chance finding positive case, UK's case, case. Rather, easing restrictions less masking caused - means enough unvaccinated people cause increase daily cases, even 70+% UK partially Sounds like misinformation… Personally, I'd assume decided none business. infer anything additional. say show numbers? Also think vaccine straight doesn’t work think work government might also injecting malicious chemicals something? really hard time understanding antivaxxers concerns data literally proves vaccines working unvaccinated don’t wear mask get sick don’t care. That's probably said ""outdoors"". We'll find 2-3 weeks holiday affect numbers. expect small uptick cases either mild asymptomatic cases given vaccinated. Sounds like someone paid education. apparently actually know diseases communicated. plague nowhere near easily spread coronavirus, especially modern hygiene standards Oh, lol. course, there’s too, fun stuff. That's strange comparison make. Maybe understand fully behind mask yours? Could speak up? meant living subjects putting body parts subjects' orifices Vietnam controlling COVID-19 managing borders barely started vaccinating populace. countries need vaccinate public order manage highly populated work areas factories. got me. gonna start measuring women’s skirts well case aren’t preferred length? imagine giving damn people wear need tickets valid sellers like cosport claim need give full refunds what's vax rate Singapore? Next lockdown when? I’m aware. confirming people still wearing outdoors. know people got twice. never cared kept partying last year. wear two masks really show who's boss Yo, it’s vaccine, kidney donation abortion.  good thing people aren’t wearing aesthetics? like pathetic ass take. sorry doesn’t look good you? little left help them, blame them? took like week fully recover J&amp;J  alpha nothing ask able read article USA Today mobile app, able read full article here. adjuvant talking here? Cases dropped half since early May, looks like working. saying someone chose get vaccinated - hope lawsuit succeeds. Whether get vaccine medical decision left individual. employer, including work hospital, able require undergo medical treatment condition employment. happen think getting vaccine easy decision make would idiot want one - people right idiots wish. expecting uptick I'm guessing unvaccinated people behaving vaccinated.

Those people taking COVID-19 seriously abundance vaccine. People take seriously throughout 2020 probably actually caught it. vaccinated folks caught previously getting harder virus spread. suspect we're probably near end pandemic US. 

Having said risks variants still certain long immunity lasts spectrum vaccines well spectrum severity infection. Though even fronts data looks pretty good. Haha Shouldn’t really effect much vaccinated data help scientists researchers medical community... ignoring it. However, data roughly summarized cherry picked quoted people idea talking about, worse. avoids stigma, sure. sure confusion though. delivered without needles

what's proposed method then? inhalation?  think lot skeptics stem accelerated creation vaccine new technology. PR campaign mRNA vaccines would better suit people imo Perfectly healthy? Seems pretty anecdotal even detrimental think something can’t prove spouting it. I've read 25% reduction transmission asymptomatic people. much might expect.   do. It’s honestly bad you’re underway air airplane damn dry. landed one like six hours (horrendous delays) sucked airport jetbridge lot humid. 

The flying experience already sucks honestly unbearable. Worth see family year… can’t say feel inclined fly lol  live LA I’m heading road trip Utah/Wyoming/Colorado next 2 weeks. I’m fucking excited come home 15th put mask on. well, die specifically? Aren’t vast majority bad reactions vaccine clear within first two weeks? ever long term impacts haven’t thoroughly debunked? example, so-called link autism vaccines proven fake. thinking wrong. Vaccines 100% effective there's higher risk unvaccinated person transmitting covid vaccinated one. absolute thing like ""they're threat"", minimizing risk. Let's hate Greece now!  proscription aware use fever-reducing pain medications treat nominal side effects. Fever actually good thing comes immune systems. Higher temperature enhances immune response natural defense mechanism.

Obviously extremely high fever another matter...and calls doctor's attention. virus surviving also cause number potentially lifelong issues probably worse, saying. Thank this. legitimately makes feel better it. far really struggle falling asleep. You’re right - don’t get worked it, fall right asleep. Greeks?  &lt;Wisconsin entered  Thanks sharing. helps, I've tinnitus life since 10. brain learns adapt barely notice ringing unless there's absolute silence. Stress make worse, please think/worry it. also almost 50% republican adults currently planning getting vaccine Might inquire parent comment said? got deleted. happens get clots something?  Lmaoooo  pregnant sister same. Perhaps worse since she’s also inpatient OT working geriatric hospital patients. questioned she’s going continue masking everywhere, “no, I’m healthy. mean guess big crowd will.” Forehead dent deepens.  Oh funny enough, she’s hawking MLM supplements boost immune system decrease inflammation. I’m sure keep Covid away. /s I'm vaxxed hell masks.

Time get pal  point it’s one non-scientist’s summary one paper, scientific consensus it’s impossible vaccine-resistant variants develop. makes sort sense feel bunch people wouldn’t want go time want “keep renewed freedom” (aka don’t want wear mask vacation) maybe tourism industry last word that. I'm public places indoors. hard take chances?  true. expecting zero Covid forever extremely ridiculous. Wait 50+ vaccinated, sure. get it. zero Covid? That’s happening convince people? would effect cases even worked preventing severe outcomes (which doesn't). can't fudge numbers extra inaccurate make point.

The peak 253k we're 17k, guess OP thought would made point? lets give false number 97%. Thanks clarification that! toddlers eligible yet? worked years hospitals. would amazed ignorant nurses be. First, [all variant Maharahstra. 

They mostly vaccinated people 20s yet, pandemic ended everywhere else probably it'll happen UK too.

It also appears 1 dose vaccine less half effective B.1.617.2 2 doses, finding hole delayed-dosing strategy (only really since know second dose gives higher immunity delayed).

Fourth, UK used *mostly* AZ vaccine, know poor sterilizing immunity compared mRNA. 

Despite above, they're still giving 500k vaccine doses day new infections 10k. Even infections continue double weekly close race immunity versus infection. others said protective immunity vaccines, even one dose, remains strong. point being? references Science, highly reputed journal.

And she’s done amazing journalism throughout pandemic. knows shit. Nothing say except messed getting downvoted. would fucking hope so. Yes convinced campaign within particular interest channels. We're talking people even see /r/science watch medical segment Dr. Gupta CNN. good way reach them. actually big part donating awareness instead research/treatment iffy lot things. hard quantify impact message reaches narrow spectrum. danger really reaching people already knew.  blog sociologist  Yes government controlled media true. Rest world media insane. Grow man. media outside India praises us share overall social media. Yet real criticism guys like cry. world revolve around India country. Almost every country faced criticism point handled pandemic. hate see open criticism limit exposure Republic TV reddit subs like Indiaspeaks everything India glorified. 14 days, see happens.

You nothing worry about. Hope good time.  seems silly. disease virus naming conventions actually follow pattern? know many use letters (Influenza A, Hepatitis B, etc.), I've never heard using full Greek letter names. use standard lettering convention keep things internally consistent?

We've never done variant-naming general public before. Influenza A, B, etc... different viruses within family, different variants virus.

Until covid-19, never media attention virus variants. Partially rapid mass sequencing becoming available partially there's never good reason report variants.

There naming schemes variants work fine experts. Schemes use names like ""B.1.1.7"". really media-friendly, choice either let media come names introduce new naming scheme least somewhat neutral. job spread misremembered otherwise unreliable medical information way Covid-19 managed closer way common flu dengue fever tackled, public health measures personal precautions

That's ""new normal"", that's normal. went absolutely packed carnival NY maybe 5% population masked. Lines 75 persons deep, social distancing, nobody seemed concerned. Fingers crossed! I'd ever visit place something like this, would literally easier lie someone vaccinated instead lying someone vaccinated.

What, owner going make take antibody test?   country from?

(Asking India would love hope better tomorrow) peru react whole pandemic terms NPI? lockdown really hard? True, 12-15 approved couple weeks ago. Would low, many kids want finish school year/do tryouts/go summer camp first many vaccineshots healthy us relatively short period time? Legit question. see problem couple shots, relatively healthy doubt 8-10 shots year-18 months within safe boundaries. Let's say Covid evolves often enough need shots 5 times year. can't believe AZ binned use altogether places like UK enough Pfizer/moderna go around, feel stuck point asking gp get Pfizer AZ they're going know. feel like given option vaccine put us, obviously emergency situation. know risks clots low, brain clot aparantly really really rare develop everyday life, feels like taking huge risk get 2nd jab, matter uk government says, really care die😂 simple. think people higher risk definitely vaccinated. young halthy people, think risk taking vaccine unnecessary.  I'm doubting unknowns time me. That's bottles say 99.9%. man dont know talking   stupid, Indian variant meant easy end traffic India. Anything else would confuse people. Two quick points make here:

1) never said anything people putting lives hold, said people get vaccinated put people can't get vaccinated risk. Herd immunity works enough population vaccinated, fit get shot get shot protects others can't get shot.

2) 'put life hold' - cry River sweetheart, we've spent last year lives hold exactly reason. us get covid fine, enough everyone lockdown businesses close. Things opening now, people get vaccinated pool hosts remains high risk mutation. always going terrible people get vaccinated, wear mask anything preserve life own, unless that's understand important everyone EVERYTHING fuck vulnerable. comment seems suggest would prefer certain deaths now, possibility deaths complications 10 15 years line, despite indication case.  User name totally checks out. remember cyborgs lung, kidney … seen proven diseases.

That disease named region seemed come economic impact, hurts society there, etc.
Take example Ebola, named region Ebola. 

This back 2015 decided change naming policy diseases name regions anymore.

Now believe dumb stigma, fine, end people bias places, whether consciously unconsciously, enough people make matter. Canada G7 country program place compensate injured vaccine. companies manufacturing still full immunity.

I’ll keep waiting… People age died vaccine: Maybe 1? 
People age died Covid: 100s 1000s.

But seriously, even new double mutation become new virus infect whole world (like UK, SA, indian etc) Would manufactured produce new vaccine? long would take? mean 1 dose enough everyone get 2 dose ASAP? stop reason. Since beginning sub, apparent people almost seem want pandemic continue. place ghost town long. Can't happen soon enough. Actual, reasonable way get rid them: give countries suffering pandemic.

How they'll actually it: dunno probably trading rich people South America exchange promising start coup something. stance similar mine regards situation; still fence trying assess situation. mentioned antibody test could indeed good method shed light road take. news, little blip cases seems plateaued already deaths continue fall (1 yesterday). 

Despite latest reports ∂-variant, vaccines good. boat. would rather get Covid second jab AZ imagine given protection first jab far likely die vaccine Covid. bit crazy look way. need protocols action plans like Australia, China others did. need nip things bud. need intervene American intelligence (CIA etc).  education, innovation, &amp; free market capitalism. :) someone wash hands often it, shamefully agree this. LMAO given vaccine uptake UK going hard time finding customers. Look dude, honestly think it? big pandemic solved shot nothing this? 

Covid-19 prelude much larger beast way. warning shots sars mers, covid end. hope wrong one, honestly feel one two vaccines change bump 70% vaccinated. wasn’t hard understand people refuse listen scientific reasoning. progress tragedy Every AZ/Ox trial absolute shitshow honest. results mixed variants though, particularly Indian variant. think safety concern worst thing though, people probably scared lack efficacy.

Yeah I'm UK, early 30s, first AZ jab months ago, want 2nd government stopped use 40s, I'm completely pissed everyone else getting Pfizer, feel left behind given risky, less protective vaccine.  Would nice get first shot 🙄 want everyone put life hold small percentage people able get vaccinated due medical reasons? Yeah..... no..... Well yes, we’ve also plenty Sundays since October.

All time make informed decision based know point time, data shows administering first COVID vaccine (6 months ago) now, shows safe. 

We cannot wait 5, 10, 20, however many years deem comfortable waiting see off-chance surprise side-effect springs up. That's millions dead people. 
Here UK, vaccines administered strict lockdown peaked 1823 deaths day, yesterday pubs, resteraunts wider economy mostly open, one death. clear indication vaccines working, can't help you. get hit lightning blue going get vaccine.

(curious, ""skeptic"") Well blowing candles birthday cake could disgusting depending birthday person covid not. /s Yes it’s pity original trial UK quite lacking quality. trial US also real life results UK shown good vaccine, also variants. 

The safety concern understand, that’s decided give older age group first place - group much lower risk rare side effects. 

Hopefully delay vaccination process NL much. something general populace doesn’t understand research statistics. thing 100%. Variability exists. n large enough always freak thing happens, person vaccine doesn’t work well etc.  It’s germ bottles kill 99.9% on. Without knowing actual numbers headline doesn’t tell degree appears safer, tell need make informed decision. One way clearly safer. 8000 cases isolation locked down. locked highly infectious virus could spread like wildfire. there's essentially 0 risk happening India didnt pay tedros enough 🤑 helpful. husband sot (10 years) takes mycophenalate flagged possibly lowering immune response vaccine. It’s super stressful works factory still hope moderna shot effective him. shockingly never got covid despite high risk work.  Yeah also amazed pen n paper based certificate. India, virus last 2-3 months wrecking ball slow vaccine rollout, silver lining via official contact tracing app/vaccine registration app, access vaccine certificate anytime, anywhere. best part easily verifiable Centrally maintained records QR Code digital certificate. Black Widow variant - resists vaccines. I’m fully vaccinated going try tell people vaccine safe would say it’s safe instead comparing thing it’s preventing. 

This seems like saying it’s safe safe virus that’s killed many. Cases lowest levels roughly year... large portion blamed talking heads.

If pushing narrative economy people liberals trying control you, nonsense, big deal.

I mean, people totally fine PATRIOT ACT, asking questions talked to? WORST!

I wish good ways account much spread could reduced effective TTI. 

Now, think also could better salesmanship agreeing help contact tracing took entirely long get state systems ground even patchwork state systems lot missing people traveling, border towns, working individuals move around country (say, gas station attendants).

Feb 2021 Mixing vaccines boost cell Plus it’s worth noting vaccine technology developed since SARS MERS popped early 2000s. It’s something started developing scratch March 2020. Yeah great many people getting vaccinated really fact many people (and animal hosts) means virus play hot-potato eventually change *just enough* render vaccines useless.

Not trying fear-mongerer *really* hate rush back normal. false start last summer...until get vaccine numbers **globally**, could easily setting massive disappointment.  Well, really, really late giving COVID-19 official name first place. age internet inexcusable officially label thing information efficiently categorised found.

It seems like anything agree label ""conspiracy."" get PHD Feigl-Ding School Virology? good step right direction used justify early easing restrictions it’s safe to. Every “alternate origin” theory Spanish Flu always massive holes it.

And that’s theories anything purported back results confirmation bias American exceptionalist/western chauvinist sources, *want* believe greatest medical scourge 20th century could come oh-so-glorious western civilization, let alone so-called “greatest country ever exist”, many “backward” people around.

Not mention sinophobia wildly rampant days could find source claim reason car broke China. wouldn’t surprised try pin Swine flu (definitively proven originate Mexico) possibly coming China “according new research” something within next years. news, grass green. Obviously. Unless watch anarchists Fox (Absolutely Fucking Not) News know already.

Just little worthless man bow-tie yelling delusions television elevate content beyond is: ravings frustrated, ignorant psychopath.  Lol, here. No, pretty stupid question indicates lack understanding efficacy figures. That's literally people sub 9 months ago. getting kind ridiculous still see misinformation time. 
 
And given strange crowd people seem rabidly hoping AZ vaccine fails reason, many people (usually correctly) assume asking extremely bad faith, sane person would've simply educated time cared much efficacy. Maybe? But..but...is it...FDA approved!? nice article autoimmune disease expert positing long term side effects watched studied respect vaccines, based findings previous study white paper. Source NIH. medical researcher isn’t confident, maybe confidence Thanks mod believe me. PhD, genetically engineer microbes living including working viruses, several published papers reviews adaptive laboratory evolution many papers topics several patents. I'm going argue asshole Reddit private account I'm identifying myself. Point magical literature quote getting from. Go on. fair, know deal virus got SARS 1 control. virus think ever imagined countries would botch infection control measures severely long year later would suffer consequences massive tomfoolery. get he's saying, think bit misleading. agree data/trials required get EUA perfectly sufficient establish safety nobody thinking data lacking. clearly still requirements full approval beyond EUA concerned safety. includes data efficacy, case (that ongoing efficacy concern), Pfizer already approval since submitted application weeks ago. take weeks review data efficacy that's concern. obviously requirements here. that’s certainly good news, note states didnt report cases due holidays generally test sites may closed too. possible real number bit higher frustrates people insist right 'difference opinion' simply must respect that. Lies fearmongering valid ""differences opinion"".  


If tell someone they're spreading lies, turn around I'm mean need show respect. ""agree disagree"" sort situation. mean, one people concerned two reasons.

1) know much time randos different states would congregating together game, line, etc

2) Superbowl parties great way get groups together indoors spread virus back less people vaccinated.

How that? right degree. can't say absolute certainty long term side effects manifested yet.

However, already people vaccinated almost entire year. clinical trials. talking pool ~100k people more. would expect side effects presented considering side effects vaccines would presented now. 

So likelihood, vaccine safe. there's small possibility we're getting Legended.

Plymouth Coventry experience fair share destruction. anything lack knowledge subject makes see yokel tears. specifically said mRNA vaccines customizable vaccines everyone saying. 

So everyone agree narcissistic? Interesting

Did even finish high-school? Yeah, Russia China authoritarian regimes mean great scientists. true, necessarily long time frames individuals. Therefore hard extrapolate:

1) long protection last.

2) (unlikely) long term side effects may occur, manifest several months later.

Observing million people couple months give equivalent data observing thousand people year, case. They’ll still call experimental. someone doesn’t trust vaccine safety, point, they’re never going Realism Reginald speaking strictly mRNA vaccines way operate it’s simply possible effects pop road.

That's lie, know is. NYC's vaccination stats looking like (first dose fully vaxxed)? anyone data hand? trust guy fine, think hes simplifying complicated message sake public understanding. clearest messaging (imo) actually explained FDA website issue. number steps involve things like inspection production facilities go full approval, likely source think germane public understanding.  better vaccination response do, even government bungled lockdown response. simply possible effects pop road

We're still long way reach needed 75% control de pandemic, hopefully younger people go get vaccinated least want vaccine mobility pass. comes downvotes reason people won’t get vaccine it’s dichotomy comparing risk COVID vaccine. It’s weighing risk vaccine, COVID odds contracting COVID all/or whether already natural immunity contracting earlier. exactly, non USC/residents can’t physical Europe (Schengen) last 14 days. 

A French citizen living Canada example would fine. euro-centric point view. third world nations struggling Covid vaccines certainly help world. knew single mom passed away left two kids behind. restaurant server. think kids went father wasn’t involved much lives way knowing sure. sad   Problem going getting in, problem open things are. Hoping ease restrictions. It’s understanding there’s evidence vaccine would cause sterilization/infertility, people still believe might don’t know long-term effects they’re thinking “well, if...”. There’s also crazies Facebook say Bill Gates discussed dangers overpopulation big backer vaccines, way enforcing population control lol  large number people still working home states removed restrictions yesterday today.

Lots people still wearing masks, especially indoors, distancing careful. Masks still required apartment buildings office buildings elevators example.

I think it’s fair say it’s new normal now. I’m curious see many people stay working home. That’s biggest possibly permanent change along mask wearing public transit see. dangerous part getting vaccine risk catching Covid getting vaccine. EU nationals live outside EU vaccinated outside EU? Oops, thanks! missed delivery chart. think people like really care safety. use excuse seems socially acceptable. bet person's friend still get even approved FDA.

I know someone close pretends care safety. I've known whole life tendency obsess worst-case scenarios act like they're intelligent well-informed they're not. someone never bothered get flu vaccine ""possible side effects"". Testing lines long today long weekend; lots work places requiring tests. nothing 'treaties'. Countries completely ignored warnings scientists late. lot answer communication sketchy best counterproductive worst. government forcing vaccinations? mom also refuses get jab fully approved. But, I'm 80% sure moving goal posts. would even? Come $20 says friend still get FDA-approved. Obviously? goal flatten curve medical facilities overwhelmed researched better treatments vaccines could get herd immunity. Isn’t article talking vaccinated travelers going unvaccinated areas?  it’s seems odd deductions yet. usa pfizer moderna cases dropping every week. 50 percent 75 drunk? said anything moron *for* vaccine decision? already one. qualification previously established, covid vaccine. called virus ""a hoax election ploy"" said ""they lying many people died"" ignored part keeping people safe pandemic. Went indoor events wedding parties went directly 70's year old parents, took joyride airplane covid hot spot Christmas vaycay December, thinks there's conspiracy election ""rigged"" ""stolen"" Trump...do really need go on? already self centered moron covid vaccine. I'm finally done usual. 

Not getting vaccine absolutely choice. am, however, allowed find reasoning completely ridiculous. Specifically part going go solipsism -heavy ""we know, can't know, could hurt us years later, want take risk"" comes vaccine, pointed also know *deadly fucking virus* could people long term suddenly follow previous reasoning says ""I'm willing take risk"" without skipping beat without hint self awareness. well reasoned basis choosing one risk long term effects other. easily led around ear, FOX news ranting family members. Gottlieb says US might see another Covid wave late fall / early winter. combination schools reopening, indoor activities, waning immunity, variants, vaccine hesitancy fuel wave. remember, might actually flu season year additional Covid cases could put hospitals strain.

So won’t restriction free. Masks work home might return. otherwise much smaller wave. able visit friends family. I'm fully vaccinated. answer close friend family member would ""Yes"". answer acquaintance random stranger would ""none fucking business"" People general hard time risk assessment understanding nuances guidelines. large number people consider whatever allowed ""safe"" whatever allowed ""unsafe"" despite often true. Restrictions made reduce minimize risk completely take away often many things allowed safe necessary survival society risky enough population level ban (indoor dining great example)

For year people told could xyz long wore mask translated ""I safe things wore mask."" definitely reduced overall risk, nowhere near eliminated it. forced situation view unsafe told long safe needed wear mask feet table safe.

Basically people think hard things mask outwards symbol safety; much changed without restaurant situation feels less unsafe Can’t week week alternate? Give 2.5 million poor people one week, give 2.5 million rich allies next alternate keep moral side “pragmatic” side happy? Ah yeah, one since COVID. Thanks letting know! used Yankees game. That’s it. lab come from? one going follow Tedros leader. lost credibility had. probably going happen. man eastern China contracted *what might be* world’s first human case H10N3 strain bird flu, risk large-scale spread low

Yeah bad journalism post belong Wow hope it’s enough. Chile yet see reductions even though age groups 50+ 80% vaccinated. Every weekday, new group vaccinated. Today it’s 24 year olds turn, tomorrow 23 year olds on. Also, pfizer approved kids older 12 hopefully soon see reduction cases. much convenient use rather carrying vaccine card. NY, lot dance venues vaccinated-only, they're becoming common. 1. think impression. think made pretty clear think dishonest, means act like it, really think that. 

2. Instead waying ""You've entirely missed point... Try again."" letting guess intentions could explain it. add this, need minimum 6 months clinical data able seek full approval. emphasize/provide efficacy, related safety. Facebook things

Sure, know does? coworkers, pass bullshit person. Weeeeeeeeeee!  Willingly passing deadly infection *is* violent behavior   true, takes serious consideration. convene panels experts, sent data. pour it, research own, present findings opinions. turn, anything found considered panel, re-researched, debated on, finally put vote.

Just getting experts work (taking regular jobs) present requires months planning, travel, expense. No, isn't. continue wear mask socially distance. parents got covid right eligible (in US) amd told need wait 3 months first negative test. Bird **flu** influenza virus. 1. American
2. fully vaccinated
3. trust Americans honest whether vaccinated.
4. Hence, requirement proof. think tourism Hawaii return. much $ people collectively put medical/insurance industry, certainly feel like consumers getting short end stick. [The US whole many states I'm coming across exactly? 

Someone said vaccines customizable said are. fact. No, you’re not. You’re downvoted cos thats you’re coming across. plan wearing mask public foreseeable future. Simply like anonymity. wrong every way numbers better last summer. 1st June last summer 1400 positive cases around 250 deaths. Compared today 3000 positive cases 0 deaths. bear mind fraction tests last summer (lucky 40,000 day) much better last summer. Also fact last June 4000 people hospital covid 870 people hospital covid. vaccines helped massively. Yesterday first day allowed wear mask work. took thing second could. felt weird also great. stopped feeling weird pretty quick. Turns decades practice wearing one muscle memory took pretty quickly. 

My inner mantra started feel self conscious ""I fully compliant masking policies guidelines, still fully compliant masking policies guidelines."" want help normalize idea hate masks without anti mask. comparing like like? we're summer yet, quick glance 7 day average end May 2020 shows 200 deaths day.   said nothing I'm downvoted.

But since mentioned it, is

I downvoted ignorant people think became experts reading random newspieces media still playing fearmonger. New York Post published article today titled, ""Highly contagious India COVID variant spreading rapidly US"". checking case death totals every day, would think cases rising based headline, opposite happening. 

I'm also seeing articles India's rapidly-declining COVID cases. 7-day average India half three weeks ago. still bad there, situation improving rapidly. Everyone tell know media seem covering this. want report stuff scares people. one trusts media anymore. really sad.

Every time hear variants roll eyes point. think exist (I do), know vaccine still likely quite effective them, every damn variant. pandemic end, end SOON. happening quickly U.S. (my life pretty much back pre-pandemic point), even rest world continue see great progress throughout rest year. guess get many clicks.  Yes, doing. bills intimidating happening first place zip code's 7 day positivity average 0.1%!  Lmao thats you’re downvoted dude. That's worry too. I'm scheduled get Pfizer first dose I'm reasonably sure I'll still get Pfizer second round. I'm concerned ill-effects getting Moderna second dose it'd piss end find immunized via mix-and-match bar hassle-free international travel compared travellers vaccinated per Big Pharma's instructions along (i.e. mix-and-match *and* timelines used trials rather hunches Bonnie Henry and/or recommendations NACI). simply doesn't/didn't way, matter proponents chaotic vaccine rollout insist.

If purposes unrestricted/hassle-free international travel I'd need vaccinated per Big Pharma's prescriptions, somehow get Pfizer second dose I'd try like hell get J&amp;J instead. least that's one-and-done administration impervious public health shenanigans involving dosing. eyes border guards, one shot J&amp;J should/would less questionable immunized using Pfizer first Moderna second.

In bigger picture, Canada whole deliberately struggled administering two-dose vaccine instructed. matter instructions given English French seeing rest world consistently facing problem demand far outstripping supply.

I think first inkling we'll second-order effects institutionalized mix-and-match come Trudeau comes back G7 meeting later month. foreign leaders agree let Canadian travellers hassle-free travel later year travellers fully vaccinated using looser definition ""full"" vaccination?  approx 50% adults though? 1) agree. said statement true now, past year.
 
2) sorry, said ""among vaccinated people"". count care morons chose anti-vax. death numbers meaningless me. Sorry they're stupid.  Misery loves company Yeah, that's get. students started going back person learning, saw people say ""one death child many"". However, I'm comparing flu, 2020 2021, Michigan example five flu deaths children 15 years age, four COVID-19 deaths age group. 

So, logic ""one death child many"", go remote learning masking every flu season? look here. Ralph Baric, UNC. truth truth. title makes seem like zero people died. reality, weren’t counted. They're still offering second doses Ontario AZ. stopped first doses. happened unique day blitz ww2 actually second war London bombed air, ww1 German airships attacked several times, right end able build bombers capable same. Went full barcode weekend. People walking around unmasked, say excuse times get around, didn’t fear world. I’ve fully vaxxed it’s felt weird beginning, slowly I’m getting used things like again. trying manage expectations! Went two parties weekend (everyone present vaccinated). felt weird around many people nice. Also, happens if/when hit ""Xi"" variant? already 4 away. still use letter skip avoid making China mad? seems like would easier simpler public numbered order identified something - ""Variant 1"", ""Variant 2"", etc.  agree. put retail workers position enforce something that's become deeply politicized (in USA). companies want adopt hybrid schedules response employees' preferences, local governments really business telling otherwise. neither government's big company's responsibility keep foot traffic flowing local Starbucks. Lmao getting test March 2020 unless showed testing center ER gasping air (or rich fanous). Probably keep those, sadly. Biden admin longer mindlessly sending doses making states actually ask doses start looking donating exporting more. guess turned blind eye privacy complaints around contact tracing? world anyone issues lying? Whatever dude. Live reality. real world shit damages efforts get people share data would help others. amount useless snark changes that. Damned (hey taking long?), damned (hey, updating recommendations?) noted many people impossible 100% population actually catch virus. comes point diminishing returns since many new hosts get virus. probably get walk-in rapid test point set mind ease Science yes, advisory committee, government body. wherewithal publish conflicting statements, or, least, wait data form opinion. Thanks comment. updated wording. Need educate myself… everyone wants vaccine get one, including kids, say we’re done pandemic unnecessary restrictions. Kids start vaccinated around sept. Masks easy shouldn’t restrictions going places point. I’m headed July Wow, can’t even imagine must like. Mask wearing live looks mostly since January. I’m thinking it’ll start fade July. Tbh US bad job talking exports. Everyone talks vaccine diplomacy China, Russia, India Europe aren’t really donating anything, exporting. US people idea.

US still hoarding supplies needs end aren’t stopping exports anymore. Could give examples million ways could done better isn’t already implemented

I’ll impressed come back even ONE idea brings much money lottery public schools, roads social programs. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

""COVID-19 vaccines caused many deaths disease young people, VAERS records COVID-19 deaths""

This study compares people take vaccine vs people get virus. better comparison would probability person getting covid x chance death since getting covid guarantee whereas getting vaccine already confirmed. Fantastic news! Optimistic people UK fully vaccinated (end summer guess), Covid finally become mere afterthought. Canadian, exactly science works. course inner workings pinnacle proven vaccine technology subject public approval disapproval voting system reddit.

Lol

I saying customizable vaccines not, mean advantages. exactly went me. I'm also hoping temporary, understand often case still steroid treatment.

I sort agree last sentence there. Like said, mixed feelings. Part really wants protect others, glad immunity. part thinks would fine without - especially since im careful. Correct, Pfizer manufacturer, creator I’ll SD august. Can’t wait. Haven’t back California since moved away last year. Nice hear it’s bustling again. nothing simple words...you say organisation failed anything pandemic Hey check out—a vaccine recently developed covid, many people gotten it. Pretty cool huh? March, Pfizer principle manufacturer vaccine production process. BioNTech got new Marburg facility running March they're handling bulk manufacturing work, still plasmid cloning capabilities Pfizer does, Pfizer still handling DNA distribution manufacturing facilities. 

I'm really disagreeing you, highlighting Pfizer-BioNTech partnership truly tightly integrated one. Good know thanks! Untrue. getting downvoted heavily. say ""not negative"", quite simply false. see negative numbers right there.

That's sound like. know Biontech working mRna shot MS. sure different vaccine, whatever hope works! There's literally way know that. Goodbye Tell pay cent, insurance companies/medicare/medicaid supposed pay 100% fees. actually got tinnitus night 2nd shot. strong immune reaction featured high fever, 3 day migraine aforementioned tinnitus. 3 weeks ringing dimmed day, still there. I'm worried right now, ignore day fact dimmed kind indicated could temporary. Even wasn't, I'm sure would prevented getting vaccine. think certain take time socialize ""normalcy"" going maskless vaccinated who've wearing regularly, fully vaccinated person want help embrace ability us again, safely vaccinated. technology developed scientists various universities way used Pfizer Moderna.

Pfizer particular nothing vaccine development. Late stage development done Biontech, small German company. They'll never accept am, Seattle :(. People still double masking outside here...... mean, reasoning, literally never stop wearing mask social distancing, no? chances unknowingly contributing sickness death another due covid much lower flu point. That’s assuming vaccinated covid anyways. Covid cases deaths low they’ve past 14 months. half country least partially vaccinated. that’s much risk take mask, I’m sure really see you’d waiting anymore. Pretty sure do. looking Bloomberg vaccines delivered US compared EU - already way ahead (and Pfizer plants EU also export countries - UK, Japan Canada)  Yess, started review month ago Every time go grocery store St Louis masks usage drops another 20%. Businesses made huge stink CDCs new guidelines dont even mask signs out. Starting see employers wearing masks restaurants. think far big shift feeling everyone. know last weekend first true normal feeling one I've I've vaccinated since February Ontario ones who've said ""It's unsafe"". I'm Alberta they're saving AZ doses second shots. But..... Ontario came said unsafe, they've become pretty skeptical. hope God Sure lipids gone within week probably, effects aren't. surely know *at least one* effect vaccine, namely increased immune response COVID-19, lasts much longer 3 days. Right? makes liar. Alliter Ation* People still receiving bills vaccine. sister charged $100 Kroger administering doses. Sigh...really? 1) know damn well he's talking ""in context current situation, vaccines, summer upon us, shit like that"". know he's flat saying since day 1 covid worse flu.

2) Even given current situation context....our current US death toll covid 500/day (7 day average). typical flu 35000 year, 95 deaths per day. Even consider typical flu season lasts 13 weeks, that's still 384 deaths per day. metric actualy circumstances would judge worse flu? ""not getting tested even would help community"" something sociopath would say. in: Water is, fact, wet. mean directives? Things change. Situations change. still feel bad affected expecting companies ? Soooooo triple-mutated burmese death variants? Good know ~60% immunity seems like enough control spread. They've stuck now. keep seeing again. Biontech didn’t pop nowhere - technology development 20 years private public funding (not German EU well)

Pfizer helped speed vaccine development roll substantially. vaccines used EU coming Pfizer plant Belgium biggest manufacturing plant Comirnaty world.

I pretty sure Biontech would teamed Pfizer confident abilities  originally framed 3 days. saying 1-2 years. Yet clue. Data shows effects occur within 8 weeks. can't say certain long term effects, changes immune system affect future exposure viruses/COVID variants, including possibility overactive immune response. Yet said effects 3 days **impossible**. liar spreading misinformation.  LOVE seeing associated case/hostpitalization/death #s Manhattan alongside 70% vaccination rate adults. &lt;40 cases, &lt;5 hospitalizations, many days zero deaths despite us literally living top other. vaccines amazing. province? Quebec go ahead AZ second shots. in-laws got theirs.

Keep mind AZ vaccine worked we'd thrilled it. safe alternatives, plenty doses point, use it.  Australia New Zealand allow people months let anyone in. It’s explicit saw people US early struggling countries lament “if locked properly things would back normal now” saw dozens articles New Zealand “beat” virus great Merkel “paying people stay home” would eradicate virus. clear wasn’t case early even New Zealand lived sword Damocles head next lock down. talking points media lay people must’ve came somewhere Microsoft wants people latest secure version Windows. First time? times 2020! No, “calculated” risk hospitalization young healthy healthy people way off.

The risk death hospitalization COVID-19 30 year-olds nowhere near 0.5%, absurd. Sounds like tested mixing Pfizer AZ deciding ok extend result types vaccine mixing.  Congratulations Poland. Peru short oxygen pretty much entire - - February - April. vaccine hesitant population consequences... definitely try medical mask (usually blue black yellow I've seen well) actually found although supposed reused much, get wears em comfortable sufficiently fulfilling mask requirements. there's actual requirement vaccines tested years right? I'm glad places offering kind incentives. Anything inch populace closer closer herd immunity helpful. Vietnamese leader commends US government’s decision send 80 million extra vaccine doses help global inoculation efforts, pointing growing Covid crisis Southeast Asia. Phuc says hopes American support Vietnam continue, suggesting countries improve cooperation research, production, technology transfer agreements Covid-19 According Vietnam News report, Phuc praises partnership US Vietnam, saying continue benefit citizens countries. Vietnamese leader also asked governments Russia, China, Japan support Vietnam’s vaccination efforts, calling cooperation aspects Covid-19 vaccine production. It’s frustrating think there’s plenty criticise lockdowns policies say it’s conspiracy take away liberty even though mask mandates dropped things opening again. trying say try eradicate SARS-CoV-2, vaccination situations, marginal value additional person could higher rather lower. Nature healing 🥰 bring back combo pizza fresh chicken bakes!! Mmm, think that's incorrect. AFAIK they're submitting past 6 months data, coming 6 months.

If vaccines 90% efficacy given 75% adults, model showed average 527,409 new infections precautions lifted, 450,575 new infections maintained.

 
It would better give lower-efficacy vaccines people, calculated. would reduce risk virus spread giving higher efficacy vaccines fewer people. incredibly confusing around here.

UK made decision space shots manufacturer guidelines, really worried would major problem, I'll happily eat words now.  watching Quiet Place told friend happening real life would people outside screaming, ""There EVIDENCE sound attracts monsters!"" Here's hoping right. look global perspective, critical area fight definitely moved eastward places like India dire. Pfizer 40% AZ 60% roughly Outside Chittenden county correct. Also jobs pay greatest cost living quite high state. many people went school ended moving job issues here. Pfizer AstraZeneca mostly. Though Moderna believe J&amp;J used soon Costco given samples they're little paper bags instructed eat store. JoCo, grocery stores Targets. Maybe picking right times? probably 50/50 Price Chopper Shawnee 2/3rds HyVee, weekend. Outdoor garden part Home Depot like maybe 10/90 outdoors part 90. watch Royals TV, lot stands still few. Like said think one bit - cases stay low, maybe row YYY July.  know! exactly happened last year started! shame.... love live, makes want go spend money support them. Thank this. whole thing started found arguing anti makers claiming covid flu nonsense, exhausting. find arguing similarly stubborn people side overstating true risks covid ignoring science. difference time latter folks claim moral/intellectual high ground. Yes bitter angry, rightfully so. case, country doesnt doses bc govt shit know others dont access them. Also, securing enough doses immunize whole countrys population times bit overkill dont think? Yeah none confirmed work time one give contracts countries? Also, understand wanting give priority country thats stop worldwide pandemic (by vaccinating 100% population three four countries) thats give space virus mutate eventually become resistant vaccine, whole effort vaccinate would vain. yeah, selfishness might come back bite countries ass. Fast mutation slow spread. could Hulk smash HIV. benefits Africa would tremendous. I'm sorry. met couple similar situation weekend. Dude ass, wife wasn't. wish best. Yet governor gets crucified daily everything does, good, bad cautious regards pandemic. fear gubernatorial election cycle NJ. said something incredibly stupid, it'd best either say wrong keep quiet. putting words mouth! course treat fall ill COVID best ability, immunise people illness, need treat them, never fall ill, understand? It’s probably still trending even Holliday honest. Last year Memorial Day, country reported 20k cases. Sure buddy....who decides get antibodies test vaccine. course despite actual government peer reviewed studies, vaccine doesn’t work.

Forget hard-on Chinese vaccines post history Covid vaccines make everyone expert lunatic. Yeah, certainly want people stop dying COVID I've also already done part getting vaccinated. cases declining rapidly, point much virus United States month today. Masks stopgap vaccination pace picked up, never solution far know, got Sinovac vaccine, entering EU countries still problems since vaccine approved EU.

The EU accept vaccines EMA approve. going issue unless china apply authorisation.

The EMA probably rush anything though since EU order vaccine. Russia's faced problems EU states side deals Russia. may another reason lower vaccine hesitancy European countries. never even questioned going free not. invented it. you?

Words cost nothing.
Prove statement, enough babbling. know that's great analogy happening. like ordering pizza online. go website put things want (encoding mRNA genetic sequence) instructions get sent pizza place (the mRNA injected arm makes way cells) people inside pizza place make pizza according instructions (cells produce spike proteins) send door eaten (spike proteins found immune cells produce antibodies combat them).

For COVID ordering basic pepperoni pizza, maybe variants we'll need half-pepperoni/half-pepperoni red onions. really order anything want long kitchen tools cook (as long cells physically capable producing protein want) long edible (as long output safe body). We've already proven process delivering order cooks safe, get weird ask make. Seven day moving average US COVID deaths right now: **442** deaths per Yeah, I'm British definitely thought 7/7 first, London bombings specifically one city Blitz happened England here's current outbreak. linked many become positive isolation

I believe uncertainty around outbreak fuelling doubt we'll open soon. 3 new cases today looking positive.

The economic cost massive federal government made clear helping financially. many people vulnerable positions right Japan isnt country think vaccines ""another tool kit"".Even US number people advocate never ending lockdowns opposed vaccination mind boggling. Vaccines ""yet another weapon""-They **only permanent solution.** 

Everything elese mitigation hope specific directives professional firms Fortune 500 corps occupy massive office complexes &amp; campuses. hesitant calling workers back kind full time in-person schedule. Part safety, also many white collar workers (especially mothers) love flex-time approach juggling family duties/quality-time work. win-win cohort professionals, many small ancillary businesses city centers depend foot-traffic &amp; in-person meetings. cafes, mini-marts &amp; eateries dry cleaners &amp; nail salons whole host print shops &amp; promo material creators. never survive 50% employees returning office buildings. I'm sure partially due yesterday holiday, truth is, city fairly open since March. fact positivity rate low things essentially open without restrictions amazing. first wave tore us probably gave us natural immunity supplemented vaccination effort allows new case rate low is. Yes human conception tragedy often rapidly changes means fit environment. NHS really matter covid vaccination also free US? finally got free donut weekend. isn’t Krispy Kreme town business took one one took opportunity it. Best donut ever. Trevor Truthful Trump admin invested heavily pre-ordering Moderna/Pfizer vaccines. sayin’. 

Not giving pass failures. negative all. getting UK lowest vaccine hesitancy world?

Sources year since then, vaccine hesitancy US stayed same, vaccine hesitancy UK plummeted lowest world. UK administered 75 doses per 100 people, 95 percent people age 50 gotten first vaccine dose. clear, US vaccine effort going well, too. growing concern hesitancy might keep country reaching herd immunity slow progress toward normalcy. UK, apparently, doesn’t face challenge. negative something that's clearly good everyone? NACI waited synthesize available information rather pronouncing one recommendation rescinding week later, like done many times last year. UK resident also living outside London, same. still point misunderstood. People bother reading statements issued articles written see headlines conflicting information assume officials ""flip flopping"" ""have idea they're doing"". apparently unfathomable people new information become available influence previous decisions. Especially area many studies conducted perspectives change hour hour. Science evidence-based research always wins, even creates momentary confusion less informed.   point give advice rescind week later, repeatedly throughout whole pandemic, rather considering information giving measured response time. Canadian understand. Betting roughly month now. long death rate hospital admissions high, think OK, one ever said vaccine would stop people getting covid, chance death greatly reduced. I'm hoping vaccines effective Indian variant others UK lowest vaccine hesitancy world result.

The government get credit this. massive drive Flu vaccine too, pushed public confidence up. helps everyone trusts NHS. wife reading articles this. told within 48 hours full virus genome, working design mRNA code spike protein.

Here is. mRNA-1273 developed weekend 01/13/2020. Jesus one ""I-know-everything-but-won't-prove-anything"" guys? mean sense Coronavac grants total immunity. real problem stop spread. individual got shot probably fine, they're going killing parents friends. worst thing mind KNEW going this. information hidden medical experts kept warning gotta vigilant herd immunity, no, acted like idiots.

USA fortunate even though acted like idiots, mRNA vaccines seem effective curbing spread. great, still excuse act like idiots. read article? ""Recommend"" context mean think does, means NACI allowing mixing doses depending availability. parents need pissed got AZ, highly effective vaccine already saved tens thousands lives, continue save even more. got April, they're already clear blood clotting risk essentially zero get second AZ dose.  pandemic everyone became genius expert everything really strong opinions pretty much everything. That's says. So, something confirmed can't accept fact right? people felt COVID confirmed threat therefore accept taking preventative measures, also justified, right? masks social distancing stealing months years prime life.

This bit dramatic. vaccine, part go back normal life now. lost ""years"".  Irishman, Blitz occur saw mentioned another comment.  got German measles once. Don’t hate Germans it. issue wanting extra cautious also needs reward getting vaccinated. Saying need keep wearing mask fully vaccinated unfortunately another reason skeptics get vaccine point getting people vaccinated higher priority mask mandates IMO. couple vaccines *did* long-term bad effects (e.g. causing disease trying prevent due poor manufacturing processes), showed within days weeks vaccination. (The CDC good page [historical vaccines real suspected safety concerns.)

I think big issue people realistic idea actually *could* go wrong vaccine assume anything could happen time. medicinal chemist Derek Lowe somewhat-technical writeup last summer could gone wrong main safety concerns vaccines Antibody-Dependent Enhancement Guillain-Barré syndrome. pretty serious, everybody watching course phase 2/3 clinical trials; going get vaccine, know really soon. vaccine cause develop years later. great news. capacity really helpful vaccines adjusted new variants need booster shots One outbreak eventually get control way sustainable variant roulette. goes blaming people critically questioned lockdown, mask usage, vaccines etc.  feel like at-risk person still vaccinated, probably pile crowded theme park. applies kids. underlying condition puts risk severe symptoms, stay crowded, unmasked places get vaccine. UK resident lives outside London assumed Blitz. made neither easier faster, likely made better wonder numbers like average American’s perception covid overall. know bunch people still think overall risk much higher is, even fully vaxxed. Public perception obviously slow change, would hope people soon start realize end pandemic US. parts US, ""signs"" it, they're full-blown back normal already. could couple years begin eradicating horrible disease that's terrorized world decades.

Let sink second. mRNA proving one biggest medical advancements ever; we've barely begun scratching surface potential. People working mRNA delivery since late 70s. understand big stumbling block get mRNA cells. Like said, confirmed. Making gullible claim hoax delivered yesterday part big Pfizer AstraZeneca deliveries. see number doses stock, less amount delivered Monday, already used day delivered. Duh-duhh ridiculous thought need prove safety new medicine science? Theoretically, yes, could still get serious illness contracting COVID one shot. It’s rare, it’s unheard of. Likewise, could get mild form still end long term symptoms—again, common, unheard of, don’t enough data say sure point, know long COVID isn’t limited severe illness, it’s even documented among asymptomatic cases. already studies showing certain variants bypass one shot, two enough fend off, unvaccinated partly vaxxed folks infected, variants crop up.

I totally get dread second shot, 30-40% folks even symptoms. overactive immune system disorder, virtually guaranteed strong reaction, looking forward all. sure enough, considered moderate symptoms. still worse mild flu, done 36 hours. I’ve dealt far worse. sat around reading, gaming, watching TV whole time—not exactly worst way spend day half! LOL That’s small price pay bumping decent protection outstanding protection virus.

Please, go get second shot. urgent thing do. See, thinking cap on! LMAO  Well, least they're TRYING making real steps towards opening appreciate this. Might fly OZ instead worrying get NZ instead. Went mask free world weekend. little weird first got pretty quickly. Here's getting back normal. Laws inherently enforced threat violent aggression. It’s fundamental principle government works. according replies - whatever, shortage people wanting get vaccines Ontario date. Thank sharing this! two dozen world leaders said March support international treaty framework pandemic preparedness response, signing letter whose signatories notably include the U.S., China Russia.

Ok absolutely nothing done. publish article  you’re not. Status quo everyone choose whether wear mask. one forcing wear one. would make sense, world well COVID. locked away sold highest bidder.

So long system driving innovation one based profit, never see true prosperity Ia normal keep high percentage vaccine doses reserve? 1 million seems like lot administered 6 million date. “Biden’s FDA approved stole election” surprising nobody commented 'The original number way more'(And agree;) likely scenario say approval rushed. always foot-draggers. exactly makes ""normal"" newer other? I'm pretty much back regular life point.  make new law people like this. Obstruction public health? Something like idk know gonna help contract tracing, testing, anything need locked bit test negative safety people.

Your personal freedom stops starts harm others. ""It rubber stamp approval""

""We still know make arm fall 10 years now"" part reason wife hesitant. Another part mother (I hope correct term it) sonographer (ultrasound technitican?) also hesitant vaccines. colleagues (fellas multiple PHDs) group chat single opinion matter COVID vaccines.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* One mom's cousins told yesterday he's allergic lot things that's he's getting vaccine. say anything him, fully vaccinated. said consult doctor, doctor would able tell whether safe take vaccine. Epi pens hand reaction it. 

I dunno, think like mask question. help prevent deaths? Yes? Well screw it, let's it! I'm also 34yr old, relatively healthy guy, mom's cousin probably 60's. might easier say someone else.   fully approved, excuse antivaxxers use? Ask explain difference EUA full approval, words. $10 says can't. tl;dr? article politics virus. also actually addresses little.  Disney offered 1/2 price tickets, bet would get vaccinated Went Nordstrom yesterday maskless. policy aligns current CDC guidance Ive fully vaccinated since March, didn’t wear mask. pleased see lot people (hopefully vaccinated too). Also, restaurants cities allowing fully vaccinated employees (aka employees) work without mask. Everyday starting feel closer normal.  right. Case point, myself. father passed brothers left mother, housewife worked years. 

My mother given $800 per month social security care us. it. Even 1977 pay mortgage payment. relatives ignored us. got help them. None. turned backs. richest could - oh, could gone live them, good life, even I, star family, scorned.

Oh - I...and brothers received psychological help, even school. A+ student. grades faltered. brothers sulked, I. mother barely kept sanity. Barely. 

Voluntary organizations, Big Brothers Big Sisters best help got, aid skimpy. Pell Grant allowed attend couple years college. that, nothing. left falter pull up. 

If government left alone, I'd psych ward.  Dont forget want say vaccine REAL virus thats going get us all... think ""require"" sounds bit better ""force"" Every infection prevented saves government far money vaccine costs. want many people possible get it, it’s absolutely free charge COVID-19 Vaccine Provided 100% Cost Recipients. organizations providers participating CDC COVID-19 Vaccination must administer COVID-19 Vaccine out-of-pocket cost may deny anyone vaccination based vaccine recipient's coverage status network may charge office visit fee COVID-19 vaccination sole medical service may require additional medical services receive COVID-19 may seek appropriate reimbursement program plan covers COVID-19 Vaccine administration fees vaccine recipient, vaccine recipient's private insurance company
Medicare Medicaid reimbursement
HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured Program non-insured vaccine may seek reimbursement, including balance billing, vaccine  got emergency approval use general public full approval still worked on. I've tried calm, understanding, level headed conversation friend get COVID vaccine. information provide matters, amount compassionate listening concerns makes difference willingness hear side. feeling vaccine harm virus. given up. hope die, kill at-risk spouse child. “I’m disgusted comments “throw volcano”.”

I’m not. likely killed someone behavior. vaccines work. People need calm stop advocating violence people. believe determined [not case. noted research veryifying whether relationship causal occur 8-10 years later. won’t.

It bought DoD financed debt, given free.

You’ll pay taxes next years, free point jab.

Even charge it, would $80, won’t charge it, like one DoD ever charged flu shot. Tell Bill Mahr , sister,my stares senator friend second bought covid vaccinated.
I want get matter masks problem all. Unless wear shit ton makeup vain hell. One previous comments stated ""young healthy people"" vaccination unnecessary. 
As silencing you, contrary effectively said say want, hope people listen.

The scientific method encourage sceptical results observe. That’s really interesting wonder improve? covid lost smell it’s slowly coming back weird ways. Still months I’m healthy mid twenties person. Definitely hard know would better people age health. Glad antibodies protection now. know I'm preaching choir subreddit, people get vaccine can. matter one right high enough vaccination level bring herd immunity. We're seeing effective others. perfect world, magically get best can, live world need get can.

Still, mRNA results incredibly good, mean well beyond seen traditional methods. really excites future medicine. said, again, results we're seeing traditional methods well line expected. No, Krispy Kreme that? site run experts field epidemiology? Save 39 minutes. What’s tldr? chile sinovac vaccine working, since many positive covid cases unvaccinated people according official Shouldn’t welcome opportunity debate prove everybody skeptic wrong, versus silencing go one-sided platform everybody eggs misinformation spews? gotten free donut yet? safety theater. guidelines put place actual safety, made make people feel safe. new data information that's come really thought saving lives putting piece fabric mouth table wearing one entire time table really know tell you. Thanks giving new material spread.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* basically fully open. Big gatherings, inside, still allowed(no nightclubs, seated pubs apart entering/leaving going toilet, limited attendance sports/funerals/weddings) stays weeks longer, really wouldnt bother personally.

I appreciate hospitality entertainment industries feeling though, still hard time want definitive end date.
