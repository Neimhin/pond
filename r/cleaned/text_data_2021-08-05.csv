Science changes improves learn. Also, leave concert. can't leave cruise. wish could give award. terribly correct Mississippi here. Wednesday announced six ICU beds state, coast’s hospitals nearly full. statements stand true, far almost everyone knowing someone caught it, still wasn’t enough last week two. There’s shift sense urgency getting vaccinated. places running low stock, incredibly bittersweet thing, rushing get vaccinated better late never situation could’ve avoided. anything like industry big pay open positions, ones already filled. meaning would leave new role realize gains higher wages. sake nurses hope getting well comoensated That's correct, determined cycle threshold vaccinated unvaccinated patients comparable, indicates similar viral loads. could indicate similar chance spreading virus, real world data support claim yet. CDC still says vaccinated people less likely spread others. dad 80 December. Fully vaxxed got covid June. sick three days said, “The flu worse this.” Vaccines work. Well, fair, vaccination point prevents severe illness occurring. said thus far, transmission still occur among vaccinated unvaccinated, even vaccinated showing mild symptoms. turn leads cases among unvaccinated, essentially pressure cookers newer, potentially dangerous variants said virus. lack visible enforcement state federal level, there’s way discern really vaccinated without various mandates, including mask mandates. short term, still one easier options enforce protect everyone. virus mutates initial vaccines prove ineffective, everybody back square one.

Is annoying inconvenience us vaccinated tried follow rules? Yes, is. necessary due politicization fear mongering among relative minority population? Also, yes. Good. I've take Uber / Lyft pandemic would love match vaccinated drivers. I'm sure vaccinated drivers would prefer vaccinated riders. 

Let's simply add option add vaccination status app, let drivers riders set preferences. Let free market take care it. course would. hell not. Whatever would I.  
I'm part original clinical trial first I've heard Phase II booster trial. get participants trial orignal pool guinea pigs like me, what?  daughter loves outside, (as I), mindful heat/humidity poor air quality sometimes. desperately want take library children's museum. public places ever inside hospital doctors' offices. feel like mind going blown finally gets vaccine world opens up. 16:38

""No, give mic"" Smoking, morbid obesity, diseases could've prevented getting vaccines come financial penalty instead expecting everyone else pay it.

Actually, study found smokers fat people lower lifetime healthcare costs die younger medical costs accrued old age. also save Social Security ton money.

If concern paying share, giving hamplanets smokers discount.

source: still free. excuse aside medical conditions someone gotten shots yet. barrier entry states. exactly. sounds much fun. cool. possible serious concerns besides death. science still emerging, long covid happens good percentage kids there's info coming possible brain damage people symptoms like anosmia. There's also misc-c. I'm keeping kids virtual vaccinated reasons, everyone option.  blame happened Tuskegee? wish (any) mandates Florida. don’t disagree mandate level protecting health moving ship forward.  see may issue. California something like health care workers unvaccinated. people complete access made choice. interesting see choose job versus anti-vax stance. find real soon! Interestingly, executive order specify penalties lack compliance….. assumed people would smart get vaccinated. r/diditreallyneed/s experience similar. got Covid July, weirdly noticed things tasted “off” September bad way. Took lots months things finally getting back normal I’d say significantly better 2 months. take while. me, almost meat tasted bad. husband worked together adapt try new recipes things items still liked taste of. It’s hard hopefully she’ll make full recovery :) 100% feel. See wish us vaccinated people look antivax/antimask people laugh. Sadly we're still affected dumb actions said scientists - specifically mean team CDC. doctor random biologist someone whose entire career researching this-- random medical practitioner. 

 political stance. I'd agreeing shit's handled federal government not. Fools. like Texas. contact tracing notify parents covid cases, need quarantine.

These kids need get out, I'm scared Delta. chose daycare good health safety protocols (small class sizes, lots outdoor time, masks teachers, zero tolerance covid symptoms, etc) hopefully help, least. understand coming from. sucks over. Marginally Yes. think OP shingles. Possibly covid shingles, assuming positive covid test. So, I’m coming 6 months since second shot. what?? Healthcare workers vaccinated ones, too. So, given chance contracting covid 10%, chance needing hospitalization 1%, rate hike around 0.1% cost treatment, right? I’m glad mandating here. sooner companies do, better. California companies leading US requiring vaccine mandates many people coastal areas mind. problem areas Central Valley, inland empire red neck counties near mount Shasta cares?   really tie next stim check getting vaccine, restrictions otherwise. unvaccinated adults dumb. Go figure If... Yes.

From executive order:

Better statement ""It'll gone Easter."" Seems like he’s contemplating kind big government overreach he’d object matters, since involves diminishing public health he’s big government. wish objected COVID hospitals instead. live dirty south, kiss fat ass goodbye. Maybe kids survive Scheduled vaccination shot Monday, today develop low grade fever scratchy throat. Taking Covid test tomorrow. Hope catch virus couple days vaccination, I'll upset. guessing read article. true. executive order:

You’re next. Bye bye! I've saying whole time. Unfortunately take people knowing someone gets really sick COVID get vaccinated. 
It's classic ""it happen me"" sort thing. someone close put oxygen/intubated, take seriously.

But people say go cruise see countries places, hard pass me. actually get experience country culture spending 4 hours port town. travel internationally, spend minimum one week location usually stay hostels. Get out, walk around, avoid typical commercial tourist traps.

Australia becoming unfortunately case study looking Delta spreading including able see situations outdoor transmission like following reasons:

. Australia effectively locally eliminated wild variant COVID outbreaks Delta across cities country. 

. Relatively low vaccination rates 16.6% adult population far

. Advanced contact tracing.

As far I'm aware people spreading virus vaccinated still investigation.

There also instances outdoor transmission observed recently Australia including large sports stadiums Melbourne. notice ones 30 days due infection live virus.

Live viruses can, course, infect people months years initial introduction - there's constant replication.

I suppose could consider ""side effect"", considered infection disease.

And noted above, certainly concern modern vaccine (at least used west) make use live viruses. Ugh. Paywall.   hospital stats. 50/50 mostly ideal conditions intubated. That's surviving long enough get breathing tube out. 50% made pinnacles good health say least.  company

TIL  post updated specify Walensky referencing fully vaccinated people get breakthrough infection saying vaccines longer prevent transmission Covid-19.

She needs choose words carefully clarifications required. Honestly. people need get Reddit go outside. safe without living like hermit. lot posters believe precondition makes ok die COVID. It’s utter unfeeling garbage. deepest condolences you. **IMHO, message pretty clear.**

&amp;#x200B;

While correct messaging still wrong. What's stopping unvaccinated people spread way push agenda vaccines work? Moreso exact statement coming CDC itself. say things like still wonder can't convince unvaccinated people take jabs? took 2 biostats 3 immunology courses efficacy still confusing everyone try remember explain someone else lol

Good explanation! Canola oil actually omega-3 Coconut oil. Coconut oil also 90+% saturated fat. It’s probably least healthy cooking oil available lard. It’s also best tasting mind you. 

I think people hard time thinking canola one healthier oils cheap, mostly associate *healthy* *expensive*. sorry hear son. Extreme exercise actually suppresses immune system. mention, bring health care likely exposed high viral load. Even mycophenolate, might response. ask rheum request antibody test actually find out. 


I'm mycophenolate reduced response yet recommended 3rd shot. don’t think fear much charged $, (legitimate) fear treated like shit MDs. Unless you’re male, white, abled, thin, middle class wealthy, history experiences MDs likely filled harassment, degradation, abuse, assaults.

It’s easy enough get vaccine drugstores, though, zero interaction MDs.  It’s first successful mRNA vaccine, it’s far first that’s gone clinical trials. mRNA concept vaccines around lot longer people realized. really interesting. Even schools closed social distancing, Delta contagious kept spreading. Warm weather ruled (see USA) real head scratcher. I’m following. What’s question? feel way parent. home learning since March 2020. I’m worried sending back. I'm sorry loss. time people need aware even they're vaccinated, mean go bars unmasked go visit 70 year old immunocompromised grandparent assume able spread it. tough balancing act keeping confidence vaccines, also making sure vaccinated individuals still taking reasonable precautions.  forget, let's close airports, whole interstate highway system. socialist all. states right ICUs filling again. fear mongering. restrictions recieving compensation vaccine related injuries. notice several onsets ranging 6 months year after.

also listing historical incidents : 

all said (and people downvote without reading...the recent vaccine safer is) smokers. obese. slippery slope tolerate?  Also pic. Tried getting wallet thing work, keeps saying need Google pay even though already use it. months .. 4 months second dose 3 months giving birth 😐 IMHO, message pretty clear. 

Vaccinated people still highly unlikely get seriously sick delta, chance spread it. 

At end day, unvaccinated running nation’s doctors nurses meat grinder.  moment 1. I’m furious too. Idiot. I’ve thoughts. covid “easy” compared climate crisis!

I work tech. Scaling incredibly complex difficult endeavor. that’s cold, logical machines. comes it, think human animal simply doesn’t scale well. 🤷‍♀️ Absolutely .. except believe stall bit.. nurses denial refusing vaccine north fired turning high paying travel jobs hasn’t good data showing surfaces significant source transmission. things already factored many premium discounts.

But additionally: Losing massive amount weight, stopping smoking, etc take lot effort cases lot time.

Getting vaccinated fast, free incredibly easy. really fewer excuses. lessons learned remember months ago quite people sub going "" COVID BAD PEOPLE DYING STREETS?!""  


 feel like people take covid seriously watch somebody know choke fluids broad daylight. pointed another poster pre-delta. data prior February 2021. apples apples comparison. data isn’t related Delta. looking past. happening different, might least. anecdotal evidence suggests is. little bit difference steelwork working hospital pandemic watch many, many people get seriously ill many passing away. Yeah, backwards step promotes vaccine hesitancy/apathy Business booming. Basically, we’ve letting blow past year entire planet. wouldn’t strains virus stopped early. Blowing population making mutate faster keep up. one seems get much virulent round. Basic Training line inject cattle inoculation gun. get bunch shots; one consistency injected peanut butter it’s painful. arm, others buttcheek. 
Was penicillin? went Basic Clinton Administration don’t remember. She’s 44? seriously looks 64 way find side-effects “too toxic” 250 microgram doses were? Thank helping advance science healthcare! fuck matter?! lost child pneumonia 3 years old. disability issues exactly make difference? held son took last breath.  (He died 5 years ago covid) died pneumonia none less. seems probable someone like already asymptomatically. one careless likely “lucky.” What? trying get bingo? Check r/lollapalooza you’ll get answer /s Well cdc director said vaccines longer stop transmission... probably not? agree Vaccines still incredibly effective curbing transmissions. agree 100%

What I'm fearful moment even scientific evidence vaccines STILL prevent transmissions, CDC putting kind message headline? going appease vaccinated population unvaccinated population use weapon spread agendas.

&amp;#x200B;

Incredibly frustrating downright wrong. tell stopped washing hands using restroom germs liberal hoax. Fwiw, two doses Pfizer pretty effective Delta, see Moderna study? UK. health system good quality studies, delta variant early on. used Pfizer oxford vaccine there, much moderna. temporary

Too bad baked official guidance. well would someone fare covid already got vaccinated vs someone ever get vaccinated? whose expense?

Ideally expense; realistically probably not. imagine testing provided student health centers, etc. *could* get free vaccine avoid need much testing. mandate vaccine students IMO. need tuition money, we'll see goes. predict poorly. timing outbreak worse back-to-school season. Plenty viruses eliminated human race, come back new forms spread amongst us even vaccines effective previously seen strains. immune systems outpace virus get point cases really low managed easily. moves mutates faster keep might stuck long time. talking doses least one dose? two-dose vaccines, they'll hurry, since takes six weeks considered fully vaxxed. Yeah good living life survive ain’t living damn injection peanut butter! Second dose end June. Well said. Similar app ny got two AZ shots part trial. 2 Pfizer February. quantitative antibody test yesterday. got results earlier today. long after, antibodies roof still. 1593 units/ml vs ~50 units/ml friend Pfizer alone month me. Oof, same. Almost everyone know (30F, south TX) supports universal healthcare state totally, hopelessly gerrymandered. I'm moving PNW year get away shit fda cdc dragging feet usual countries already getting done would make sense, feels like approved months late. hope so. world still doesn’t shots.

Idk everyone complaining that. boss gave town square I’d pretty stoked. There's tons major events since Delta. Outdoor spread still rare difficult prove - Lolla much safer bars/clubs open every city fact outside. Guaranteed people get delta bars/clubs every Saturday Lolla weekend.  Tell R’s this… study includes lower levels obesity (bmi 30-39) rather morbidly obese (bmi 40). also bases healthcare costs claims Netherlands rather costs U.S. healthcare system. different costs. 

An employer paying premiums employees benefit savings Social Security. They'll paid premiums years based historical claims costs smoking, morbid obesity, vaccine-preventable diseases included already. 

Smoking employee vs. Non-Smoking employee costs: Healthcare costs Morbidly Obese persons:  I’m finding new learning curve even vaccinated, well educated friends. Specifically delta spread vaccinated individuals, it’s damn contagious. 

I think lot people floating zone think made it. Jason came back dead… again.  nursing home offering $5k bonus nurses. think aides offered $15 hour. wants kill working understaffed? It’s ugly market there. facilities bad worked two weeks notice left. Two weeks one day hit floor.   I'm glad vaccinated plan wearing dont expect bunch redditors across world wanting chime think know better understand that. one events distinctly Iowan.

You're saying rest world understand you, I'd suggest maybe understand rest world. lot people world miss really important events. events still going modifications clamp COVID spread.

For example, Hajj Mecca (which literal religious obligation millions Muslims around world) mostly-cancelled last year [limited 60,000 vaccinated residents Saudi ton social-distancing regulations year. Pilgrims willing deal limitations believe event truly important.

If people running Iowa State Fair willing make modifications event help keep public safe (such limiting number attendees ensuring lines social distancing), acting like fair truly important? looks like they're throwing hands saying, ""welp, people wanna vaccinate, whatchu gonna do?"" first thought, too. government making hard possibly prevent happening. I’m vaxxed, also selfish Everyone has/will get COVID.

Accept instead fantasizing zero cases. Medical residents! Maybe hospital staff nicer us service industry folks pre pandemic. Seriously least favorite customers besides church folks   94.58% hospitalizations Arkansas UNvaccinated past Tuesday. Plague partner massive phenomenon happening (medical center Texas). Nurses leaving jobs joining get signing bonus say whatever want, intelligent person (The majority) wont work Ya well, gotta whole lot Jesus healthcare workers think prayers enough. qualified either. vaccination numbers low? I’m taken surprise.   Honestly one worst parts totally defeated people even going fight COVID. like knew there's way cared enough sufficiently control virus right start. You’re right general, thankfully breakthrough cases really tend truly mild, clinically mild. far. definitely exceptions though.  They’ll either go around unmasked create communities 5.42% hospitalizations Arkansas vaccinated, 15%. wouldnt buy iphone first place  I’ll one even better. Maskless. campus Hospitals don’t take medieval licenses away. Medical boards do.

Medical boards would problem. Losing potentially thousands licensed healthcare professionals pandemic would non-starter.

Loss license would empty threat. people still vaccinates always be. needs approved workplaces start requiring wish people focus Pres, Gov, Sen maybe House.

Do people understand many small *state level* districts going impacted? School boards everywhere. Sheriffs. Judges.  County commissioners. There's *3000* counties US.  Thousands upon thousands towns cities mayors. 

This v R. going affect *primaries* everywhere anyone steps office. Lotsa people dying might tried running local office ... never mind voting. think point missing vaccinations shown work, even Delta. virus infect someone vaccinated good odds even get sick lower probability spreading. We're 60-70%... Meaning 30-40% people potential walking Petri dishes defense whatsoever one contagious viruses we've ever known. number 95% vaccinated, virus would difficulty spreading spread slowly. Maybe endemic still people get less sick less people die vaccine. key point vaccines shown work effectively (not absolutely), getting vaccinated choice, something born with. get upset getting vaccinated choice, making disease outbreak worse would otherwise. Hope makes sense.

Also, science standpoint, mutation occurs primarily reproduction copying viruses genetic material. mutations errors replication. 99.99% mutations anything even make virus unviable, occasionally mutation makes virus ""more competitive"" premutation virus. proliferates. point vaccine today still effective slowing infection. rampant spreading unvaccinated populations tragic resulting many deaths, virus also reproducing quickly increases rate probability mutation actually helps virus.

We might eradicate said, certainly much manageable... people part get damn vaccine. got. treatment get sick. either live die. vaccine, body prepared get less sick. prefer field old jobs wage slave, working health care clinical research fronts broken system long time. magnifying exponentially. According waking panic attacks last April, yes. thought sure going undergo rapid diversification adaptation upon crossing species finding first million human hosts. I'm glad shut last year. edge full outbreak. wondering too. 60 received J&amp;J shot. seem red-headed stepchildren vaccinated. Precious little data effective J&amp;J vaccine Delta variant. would gladly take booster shot offered, even 2 shots Pfizer Moderna offered. curious. I’m hearing stories healthcare personnel “walking job.” Isn’t patient abandonment? shift even starts? you’re pro mask anti vax. Don’t spreadneck, ditch mask get vax, prepared ventilator shoved fucking throat Partisans built entire apparatus first broadcast media (during Clinton administration), social media (since Obama administration) zero intent inform, create dissent partisan alignment/identity. Anyone prioritized former shunned, without participants, priority media bubble creating identity among viewers readers ceaseless opposition political adversaries, also science subject expertise.

For caught bubble, partisan alignment/identity comes first. Facts exist buttress it, facts contradicting party line denigrated ignored, facts supporting party line amplified. unlike media identity totalitarian states.

There people antisocial personality disorder naturally rose top heap perverse environment, well aware propaganda death toll. them, matter followers die, long die *their* hill.

Doctors universally take Hippocratic Oath. article found 2016 Oath-taking become nearly universal US medical schools, oaths stripes often called “Hippocratic,” hardly schools use original oath Hippocrates, Greek “father medicine,” said written 2,000 years oath several problems, said Smith. starters, pointed Greek gods: “I swear Apollo Physician Asclepius Hygieia Panaceia gods goddesses,” oath begins. original oath also asks doctors never “give woman pessary procure abortion,” abstain euthanasia (“I neither give deadly drug anybody asked it”).

I think variants see coming months rona continues worst world tour ever, going see different variants affecting different demographics. 

People need get heads asses utilize tools developed. 

However, vaccine doesn’t stop vaccinated people getting Covid. 

Source:two doses Pfizer vaccine, wear mask religiously, stranger danger, that. Somehow got Covid last week, gave infant son. Fucking nightmare fuel. Pharmacists matter 😥 would take punch 7/11 guy Hospitals don’t take medieval licenses away. Medical boards do. know data Israel different rest world? Seems like Pfizer much less effective delta there. featuring cookies toppings!

*eats one*

And it's... raisins. good explanation breakthrough cases. don’t blame them. I’m surprised didn’t happen 2020 time around, get it’s even angering latest surge. It’s purely selfish refuse take precautions. Billy sure dump briquettes box roll coal libs one last time took trip Solvang couple weeks ago, literally day Delta hype started. Planned wineries, restaurant, “getting back normal” kind weekend. Driving in, everything absolutely packed, handful masks. turned around went home, lost hotel payment, scary. working crisis center several nurses call crisis line emotional breakdowns. People worked decades thinking changing careers abuse trauma, feeling broken hopeless.

And talk nurses rural areas like live trying refuse get vaccinated. Everything mess. so? sure still say ""we back normal soon'. hoped went lockdown 5 weeks ago, look today... First off, embarrassing CDC moved faster vaccines kids states taking safety precautions dumb, BUT...

**It's worth noting overall risks COVID kids still quite low. I've seen incredible amounts fear parents sub -- entirely understandable, since COVID scary! -- also think worth noting kids catch COVID fine.**

[Out 74,000,000 kids U.S., 519 died COVID since crisis Every death horrendous, means mortality rate 0.0007%. mortality rate 0.015% amongst COVID. [Children higher mortality risk car

We still lots learn long COVID, (in view) best studies suggests risks relatively low symptoms children resolve time. earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged third!). suffered immense methodological weaknesses, low sample sizes, parental-reported symptoms, control groups. recent research suggested much lower rates. self-reported survey UK, 95% infected kids symptoms lasting longer four weeks, 98% symptoms 56 days. Moreover, one study control group, researchers found kids infected COVID Zurich actually likely report symptoms long-COVID kids infected. point long-Covid occur -- much can. However, suggests actual prevalence long-COVID kids likely quite low. ([Here's write-up discusses research clear, research still needed.

Finally, since post pertains remote learning, I'd point significant costs remote learning kids -- particularly disadvantaged backgrounds.

Since studied, wonder could almost dangerous, although I'm well aware CDC recommendation doable 28 days second dose (of approved vaccine). Thanks advance insights. Yup.. wholeheartedly agree Pfizer started submitting massive amount approval data said might take September. FDA delaying anything since Pfizer completed work. favorite anti-vaxxer talking points: 

""I'm getting vaccinated CDC tells - CDC part government! 

I'm waiting full approval FDA!"" insurances long covid shortage workers. They've lost least several hundred nurses refused get vaccinated. nothing job burnout, that's politics. Also, fact Governor Texas refuses enact anymore mandates restrictions also pure politics. trying make sound like nursing shortage travesty, really lot games playing. got third jab today! amazing hear  real investment experience, best guess is... think another lockdown, unsure stock crash; however, expect small businesses forced market repeat cash redistribution flowing rapidly larger companies like Amazon, inflating stocks. mean. could set literally water use restrictions. re-examined water rights farmers using flood irrigation desert (so lose potential future water rights). used 90% water grow water intensive crops belong desert like alfalfa ship overseas.

My biggest dilemma much vax help vulnerable children, cuz die. much really think vaccinate young group. voted otherwise? Virginia website, narrow date rage capture recent cases Delta strain. Maybe choose starting point June 1 focus Delta strain. started submitting massive amount required data 26 days Pfizer did. FDA says might apply fully approve Pfizer’s vaccine end month though assumes Pfizer finish submitting data analysis. Presumably Moderna would approved end September much smaller company submitting needed data might take longer delay approval. ""signing"" ""sign in""?

It's comparing fatality rate among hospitalization cases.

15.5% 4.1% right number calculate efficacy death.

It simply safe patients cared unvaccinated healthcare workers. still get covid even though vaccinated. get less sick usually. people use face masks keep distance, still going spread around. Also get covid multiple times, infected guarantee get again. depending country, lots people decided vaccinate. Pre-Delta surge likely safe bet. Also motivated someone fence get vaccine. delta causing breakthroughs higher rate expected tough stance defend.

IMO cases appeared declining last time, everyone wanted vaccine could get one(excluding cannot medically) - point kinda accept kind normality even means covid gone forever. problem is, infect people bc he’s fucking POS plague rat perhaps even kill them. gotta suck treat stupid fucking ass.

It’s burnout, it’s attempting run hospitals profit margins. 5% risk long covid seems like incredibly high price pay waiting couple months (I hope) kids vaccines come out, especially kid well online.

This well taken.

For me, optimistic spin comes 1) significantly lower studies long-COVID adults, could much worse; 2) fact percent children symptoms halves next four weeks (to 1.8%) seems indicate symptoms mostly resolve time; 3) reading percentage children symptomatic illness. know significant share children asymptomatic COVID, overall risks longer-lasting symptoms lower reflected statistics. Clearly, however, large number children aggregate may experience symptoms four weeks, certainly problematic.

One last note: need careful discussing long-COVID differentiate symptoms bad manageable, symptoms debilitating (this really comment directed specifically you, often see long-COVID spoken unified thing mean spectrum different experiences). study, least, common symptoms lasted children lasting symptoms 1) fatigue, 2) loss smell, 3) (to lesser degree) headaches. Even really resolve question -- depending levels fatigue, example, certainly debilitating -- think something really lose sight discussing long-COVID.

Anyhow conclusion kid person, they’ll likely get covid mask not. CDC fatality rates low age range, ~20 per million, similar unvaccinated chickenpox, long covid 5% keeps night. hope myocarditis risk little one's. Yeah grit. read that? shows bad cars are.

And yeah parents go great lengths keep kids getting hit cars. Lots additional factors consider though. 

1. Data UK, CDC suggests Delta severe general. 
2. Last year many schools remote hybrid less transmissible variant. 100% person year certainly infect kids. 
3. higher percentage reported cases children now, simply children major unvaccinated population. (Not claiming difference Delta, distribution vaccines) level cases, level kids 2-3x last year. Stats UK clearly show effect. 
4. 1/2 1/3 car fatalities kids car seats. you’re concerned covid probably put kid car seat. Slightly sore throat Jesus horrible pay stress training required. Insane amount waste Healthcare costs vs salaries working.

I fully agree. billions dollars spend healthcare every year, translate people front lines paid worth all. survive here, EMT pay needs double, example.

We need nationwide single-payer healthcare middlemen/women insurance field find new jobs.

A huge part waste inefficiency tons people system, hands out, already know much efficient way it. symptom came first? Right. jfc 5% chance kid gets hit chronic illness absolutely horrific. want voters die badly? work 100k hours/year 100k dollars/year. They'll get along. Currently positive vaccinated friend.

Medicare includes health insurance pay every month. can’t opt insurance far know. choose replacement insurance can’t remember name. restricted see facilities use. also medical still run $200 month. mom died drew penny. dad died drawing 4 years. I’m sure I’ll live long enough paid back Medicare taxes nurse yet work aide (one the) Covid unit. extremely understaffed burning us out, pay pennies despite much hospitals making Covid patients.

Trust say don’t like seeing patients pain throwing able offer ice packs cold compress. Heck aren’t even allowed give someone glass water doctor put diet you. Even though spend 99 percent time caring (nurses aides) simply middle man implementing told us do. mean... reading sources. good reason peoples smell does. “Only” like 20 30% report moderate worse loss smell (and presumably taste) like couple months iirc. 

Don’t freak much get symptom. suck hear. Yeah, odd. Wife barely symptoms, amounts moderate sinus infection, others coming something close flu. also H1N1, symptoms bad one night knew going die. that's considered ""mild"" case covid, come close matching.

None non-technical jobs limit person job healthcare.

They’re well-compensated, they’re also easier replace. jobs require years training get educational qualification professional license.

Everyone vaccinated, that's do. need learn live COVID move on. people say “the flu” every winter mild/moderate cold stomach bug best.

I think people think covid gonna nice mild summer cough get week. might be, potential extremely scary. chance getting severe accident much, much, much lower chance dying covid catch it? That's like saying understand people play Russian roulette driving kills people Russian roulette. There's nothing can't justify pointing heart failure saying ""see?? worried playing Russian roulette? wayyy likely die heart attack."" New worry?  Even interesting: rabies vaccine still works take *after* get infected (but becomes symptomatic). Nope, wont matter unless immediate family close family ends ups pushing daisies.

Editorial5 August 2021, 18:47

Peter Vlug, dance school owner Utrecht, one first. decision ask students vaccination certificate made national headlines. Rather demand test certificate, says Vlug, proved unreliable Testing Access. similar reasons, Germany, among others, also shifting test society vaccination society. Het recently noted: even negative test certificate, unvaccinated visitors would 'too risky' compared vaccinated people without test certificates.

But really case? least six months ago, vaccinated people great difficulty transmitting virus others, concludes RIVM new time less contagious alpha variant SARS-CoV-2 circulating. Vaccinated housemates become infected, infected 11 percent housemates, versus 31 percent unvaccinated housemates.

Delta variant 

The proportions undoubtedly different much infectious delta variant. vaccinated person becomes infected it, also likely pass virus, experts believe. reason, [United considering oral mask requirement vaccinated persons. become infected delta, fact, breed many virus particles throats. many there? still uncertainty that. numbers vary four (according preliminary Maastricht) thousand times (according equally preliminary China).

It certainly even vaccinated person jumps around enormous amount delta virus particles first days, although amount decreases rapidly compared unvaccinated people. exactly translates risk infection meeting vaccinated people impossible say precisely. Delta changed rules game,' says Martijn Luijsterburg, dna researcher Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) regularly explains vaccination figures social media.

Still, something said, Luijsterburg thinks. outlines two get-togethers: one visitors vaccinated one one has. Based recent infection figures United Kingdom, researchers so-called REACT-1 roughly keep track often vaccinated unvaccinated people contract virus much virus carry, Luijsterburg fills drinks figures.

Three hundred people need attend vaccination-mandated get-together one carry virus. Among 300 non-vaccinated attendees, however, less four carry virus. vaccinated people carry fewer virus particles average infectious shorter period time. would go vaccinated get-together,"" says Luijsterburg.

Super spreaders 

A testing requirement unvaccinated get-together would stop infected visitors, perhaps four. example, test certificate valid long someone still turns seriously infected. visitors use antigen rapid tests, case someone gets negative result still carrying virus - something happens one five ten cases.

And super-spreaders: people contagious manage infect dozens hundreds others one evening. also exist among vaccinated people. whether they, carry fewer virus particles, also spread much less virus unclear, says Luijsterburg. 'The question whether super-spreader spreads much less virus vaccination,' says Luijsterburg. 'We know that.'

So delta variant could potentially go around meeting, though vaccination requirements testing obligations naturally depress risk. 'The bottom line neither offers guarantee,' Luijsterburg says.

Irrelevant. help. help, it?

I like reframing masks quite bit. Setting time high sign leveling off? Opinions like ass holes. stink.  love contrary: recovered covid (mild symptoms) fully vaccinated, I'm going take free pass cautious least months.

I'll still follow rules respect people's level dis/comfort though. like first time stress things year half, I'm actually really happy right now. I'm similar situation. Especially since summer live, easy meet backyards parks, etc. Personally, would feel way comfortable restaurant, theater, airplane knowing around vaccinated.

It seems lot public health experts agree vaccine requirements best way ensure people get vaccinated. Incentives work well disincentives. soon people inconvenienced, they're likely stop questioning experts get vaccinated. important,, important would free, concerned, check local health departments whatever. district this. started Monday.

You want Biden shred Bill Rights something? saying? theres lesson learn Thanks friend, stay safe well think meant gets authoritarian time too. Marion School District, one districts challenging mandate ban, Friday said 949 staff students quarantine since classes began last week coronavirus outbreak. district said 54 students 11 staff tested positive COVID-19.

Will really make difference though? Schools likely shutdown again.

Kids choice wear mask, knows did. School makes eight hours day kids, know they're large groups friends every day school weekends. Vaccine required. pretty sad get point people take common sense hand. worth, Dave Blake, someone followed lot Springtime, says projects cases continue rise somewhere around Labor Day, go decline endemic status reached around Halloween. damn sad agree. 4 billion way small sample size.

Jennifer Anniston 16 people placebo group hospitalized vs. 0 vaccinated group. works 100% confidence interval 74.3% 100% according phase 3 trial report.

Exactly - 100% expected. SA study showing effectiveness 67%... result really EXTREMELY unlikely. happened?

Okay, starts getting pretty complicated here, really. Let's say true efficacy (that want know, unfortunately never truly will, better better estimates) 80%. seen confidence interval 67% let's say wide previous study - 54% 80%. results would nicely include true value.

Even didn't, like true value 82%, unlikely - 1/20 little less.

At stage, I'd say nothing really happened. Variants change things happily consistent previous results. thought I'm reporting this, know rule Outdoor implies lots space around you. fairies nature grant +100 HP outside. Outdoor also presume packed together literally giving mouth mouth. Common sense. 

It'll funny Lollapalooza comes low positives zero hospitalizations. so, going see EVERY concert closed unvaccinated.

Mild symptoms, lost sense taste smell. said, second jab probably 1 day caught it, guess could consider single jabbed.  delete Realistically, seems like even high vaccination rates aren’t sparing areas fell dramatically increasing cases (look San Francisco).

Thank you. 🙏🏻 I’m therapist works underprivileged kids. There’s lot anxiety start school. I’m really hoping vaccine gets approved younger ones soon, least something. 1) India followed arc cases, despite minimal vaccination. seems like Delta hits really hard, fizzles fast
2) risk speaking soon, seems like states earliest Delta outbreaks (MO, NV) might reaching peaks. Case rates stabilizing test positivity slightly down. time needed see trends continue, it’s hopeful news time there’s much got free donuts Krispy Kreme can’t particular ride probably required specialist transport team included NICU nurse neonatal respiratory therapist too.

RSV vaccine exist yet Synagis injection given monthly RSV season. protects vulnerable (usually preemies) severe disease.

I'm terrified kids catching Covid RSV joke either. 3 year old four months old RSV put hospital several days.  big story transmission ""outdoor"" events, generally assumed fairly safe back alpha-variant times.

Obviously lot people packed tightly together, perhaps extreme examples. would think so, Sandy Hook basically effect peoples' opinions person's right bear firearms mass destruction, hopeful. say. said, real world conditions, vaccinated people 4 times less likely infected unvaccinated.

##Percentage Population Vaccinated 
**(18+ population removed since Total People Vaccinated counts 12+ age groups go 12-14, 15-24 hard exclude 18 adult population)**
- Total Population: 21,944,577
- Everyone who's Vaccinated Entire State Population (includes partially fully vaccinated): 12,103,207/21,944,577=55.15% **(+1.58%)**

IMHO, great efficacy hospitalization. mRNA booster considered vulnerable people took J&amp;J.  It’s always like this. Hospitals pay travel nurses double triple pay regular nurses. would pay regular nurses more, hospitals wouldn’t shortage nurses. feel bad people care stupid ass died.

CDC always shockingly inept. people read history ACT-UP movement would know this. we're living repeat HIV/AIDS crisis, let thousands upon thousands people die without anything hand forced outside, activist pressure. Also important: reducing transmission much possible reduces opportunities virus replicate, reduces opportunities mutation, reduces number new, virulent strains develop. think smallpox. yep.  Antivaxxer brought ER: “I’ll take vaccine now!” can’t pay nurses enough yet medical cost already high? weird simple concept lost general public. can't get rid it, yes still prevent great majority deaths. true pass bar, state revoke license practice.

Vaccinated + seroprevalence likely extremely high here. I'm NYC measures rising, hospitals close overwhelmed moment even winter's surge managed fine. expect rise coming weeks, life fairly normal despite situation parts country. RT equal bias sides. What? sounds wrong. Even CDC - [presentation p.28 relevant - pegs ~1/7,800 male teens. 128 cases per mil.

There studies development myocarditis vaccination vs myocarditis infection - one recently out, unfortunately leveraged assumptions asymptomatic - need those. suspect get better data those, we'll need ask chance getting virus equalizer (the prior study assumed *per year* rate COVID 100%. We'll getting boosters per year can't looking lifetime perspective, case chance infection - least - would correctly close 100%). That’s responsibility, that’s governments.

And importing medical professionals something US done visa programs encourage it.

So are… options. fully certain transmission. know prevent people getting infected according them, would mean unvaccinated primary transmitters. Regarding uncertainty transmission, well CDC also certain never said transmission rate unvaccinated findings report subject least four limitations.First, data report insufficient draw conclusions aboutthe effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines SARS-CoV-2, including theDelta variant, outbreak. population-level vaccinationcoverage increases, vaccinated persons likely represent largerproportion COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthroughinfections might underrepresented detection bias. Third,demographics cases likely reflect attendees publicgatherings, events marketed adult male participants; furtherstudy underway identify population characteristics amongcases, additional demographic characteristics underlyinghealth conditions including immunocompromising conditions.\*\*\* DPH,CDC, affected jurisdictions collaborating response; MADPH conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples forgenomic sequencing, linking case information laboratory dataand vaccination history.

Turns terrible people occupying Governors’ offices country. like everybody kind accepts governors several states literally kill constituents. I’m engaging argument covid vaccines. I’m telling want debate something bring studies it’s cite sources someone asks. 

I’m scientist publish paper can’t say readers google subject citation even I’m citing published well known work ever. That’s works. 

I’m conversation. You’re obviously tool. walk clinc pfizer town nect door me.

Should go make 20km trip get pfizer shot?

Yes 
Or 
Yes Internet people think someone raising eyebrow kind horrible micro-aggression Dude friend friend lawyer she’s staunch antivaxxer spreader misinformation. Microchip arm kind person. don’t get it, things babies born autism dyslexia. people still practice law beyond me.  also coughing others. It’s pathetic can’t understand covid contagious.  infuriating thing even though families, even school districts bandwidth time financial resources deal another Covid year, federal government could absolutely make easier. Instead - finally getting around infrastructure week? 

It insane shameful current administration Congress contingency plan another Covid wave. Makes wonder even for. ""Life sucks suck much everyone else."" hospital months. Based position.

I guess working check in/clerical ER (where people sent doctors covid tests matter much tell drs immediate care faster safer employees) worth 0 extra dollars nurses got 2/3 hourly pay extra. anyone really harassing IRL wearing mask? think phrase ""pre covid life"" give indication there. Historically, pandemics kinds historical consequences unlikely we're ever returning prior-to-covid status quo. course new normalcy, unlike lived before. know. I'm pro-mask, think entirely necessary wear getting vaccinated, Delta-like spikes probably going happen every year, Provincetown outbreak taken context. friend er nurse St. Louis. stuck around whole time, bonuses taken away overtime pay cut half. beyond furious. live area Manhattan 85% fully vaccinated. Even people coming boroughs, aren’t going get anywhere near outrageous avoidable levels infection places 20% vaccination.

These places outbreaks overrun hospitals brought themselves. Yeah real people's lives they're messing political gain J&amp;J shot... Great news disgusting, frank. lady runs COVID tracker page area saying ""bring surge schools "" believes people selfish can't come words describe rage. actively rooting virus take schools right. disgusting piece shit.

The virus mind definitely seasonality aspect virus. ""high mighty"" feel good surge calm Florida mid late September resume elsewhere country. shall see. peak day based UK curve.

Everyone seems love pile DeSantis things going bad that's rage directed at. Florida's vaccination #'s average. hit parts country too. ""turn"" right last point spot on. I've overheard people getting car license plate west talking stupid Floridians one wearing mask inside. Go inside store? least 50% wearing mask inside. Yea are. I’m still barely speaking mother anti-vax. lives small 2 bedroom apartment two brothers. One 40+ year old man Syndrome.

Shocker mom got covid. concerned downs brother getting sick. twist god damn arm get tested. kept saying CO could get test symptomatic. true one point happened. 

Anyway, pleaded brother bring downs brother get tested. Finally, get test appointment. call way find MOM ONE DRIVING BROTHER TEST!

Like holy shit! Mom! knowingly infected coronavirus going testing clinic?! sitting car risk son? Ugh. god damn fucking moron. 

Oh ya forgot mention first gonna home test him. didn’t understand administering test might bad idea. Sure mom, put plague rat hand inside orifices downs son. Way fucking moron. 

She also downplayed bad symptoms were. doesn’t know know 911 called (non downs) brother held passed face completely blue. 

Sorry, cathartic. Needed get out. really insane get talked thinking vaccines would get us back normal. would also say that, without exit criteria, uncharted fairly bleak territory. Pandas :-) Singapore context, US 50x size terms population, mention entire geographical area scale NYC. 

That said, think lot countries (like EU) ran past fully vaccinated rate US saw recent vaccination upticks fuelled fear Delta. 

We targeting 80% population (entire, adult) fully vaccinated early next month fingers crossed able successfully navigate way Covid zero mindset last year. say ""The CDC still cites 75-85 percent effectiveness infection"" also mean effective making infectious (as can't spread it)?  Hello fellow Floridian, employee largest private employer state, terrifies honestly know people still pushing vaccine hard

Because shutting business due covid expensive, covid benefits business-side already played year new ones horizon.

US society structured almost entirely around employment. Health care, sick leave, social security, hell even unemployment centers around employment. corporate overlords going eat teeth scared vaccine.

Don't like it? Better start union get pro-labor. second thought smart getting vaccinated. realized i'm dumb. 😆 go! takes one airline start rest follow suit. hope require passengers vaccinated near future! vaccine mandate? Students required get many. one different. EUA approval pandemic. roughly vaccinated UK, expect similar trend? meanwhile allowing child develop fully robust immune system exposed communicable pathogens (remember body neutralizing antibodies, meaning cannot spread pathogen even enters body today, running around kids remember 3-7 years age). give problems get older.

you need balance good bad.

the risk greater 0 child develop autism normal infant vaccines (i read science docs vaccines gave children, probably good anxiety). proceeded caution good far outweighs bad.

in case, long term immune response children worth .02% chance kid developing MIS.

please anti-pathogener test impossible regardless studying not, yeah, study. make kindergartners sit SAT. Maybe whole story end like Ebola ended...not entirely sure. Bay area. call *Delta 2.0 (alpha release, exclusive early access GOP members)*  conflation ""traditional"" definition anti-maskers 2020 people vaccinated dislike wearing mask 2021 good. two different camps, monolithic movement.

Our tolerance nuanced viewpoints waning rapid pace, least online discourse.  Exactly, many said Delta end vaxx still worth full working. Hook 'em horns... spike proteins. think will. He’s dropping polls behind Crist.   wondering anti mask mandate “laws” would start showing court ridiculous argument, way. Religious beliefs never qualified someone break laws/ require society completely accommodate them. 

It's like saying Amish right take horse drawn carriages highways. It'd asinine religion's rules allow something unsafe rest society. chance got reference that? god wanted us wear masks, would born attached face!!! /s  Maybe people less cautious? Also, there's new Covid variant town name Delta. Oh no, completely avoidable outcome. 

Tldr, get vaccine already. time! Let's get kids vaccinated! sympathy parents children control born shitty family.  middle class really live type bubble?

I think higher echelons executives care short term profits. I've seen many things private industry stuff makes higher short term profit damages company severely long run. 

This economic experiment putting greedy, short sighted sociopaths charge everything total failure. seems balancing act stating facts vaccine (can't prevent transmission) encouraging people get (good kids, loved ones, etc). latter similar tactic announced ditch mask vaccinated... early pandemic said masks work really trying preserve stock healthcare workers.

All equals lack trust confusion unfortunately. Haha! imagine stupid think people intentionally making things worse deserve standard care people could? Interesting, something similar, never Covid far know. Maybe pregnancy hormones, I’m feeling pretty annoyed people saying need third booster ASAP, really need people even get FIRST shot (and second). get third booster tell to? bet ass. I’m still annoyed us who’ve masking up, social distancing, avoiding life, getting fully vaccinated still stuck shit limbo, people haven’t won’t get vaccinated, going bars, huge parties weddings, etc. want go back “normal”, that’s never going happen rate. (I’d imagine I’m one feeling way, frustrating.) 45 Lots theories. thought wife's work function resulted several positive cases, another user suggested time instance development symptoms might soon, we're almost back square one. either (on Thursday) grocery store (Sunday prior to).  hate happy you. kind retail? big box type store, i'd pass. smaller boutique shop customers time would fine provided wearing N95 equivalent. &amp; customers un-masked probably going get infected end year. mean, yeah? people vaccinated, higher rate breakthroughs be. That's useless determine efficacy without knowing potential spread would looked like. 200 people community 150 vaccinated, saw outbreak 40 unvaccinated people caught virus, 10 vaccinated caught virus, means 20% infection breakthrough. said, 6% vaccinated caught breakthrough. That's rough way it, get point. people vaccinated community breakthroughs always possibility. fact 37% community 80% people vaccinated actually reinforces point. could potentially LOT people vaccinated. Losing weight good idea well Please never build subway line there. According Florida reports 22,783 new coronavirus cases, biggest one-day increase record, 199 new deaths Higher ed, entry level position.

A 4% raise provost level would annual salary. Say will, Florida might achieve herd immunity pretty soon. Many deaths long Covid patients could avoided, interesting situation rest world.  sounds like administrative malpractice. Yup, same. Shit getting hand, housing prices skyrocketing rich people viewing good investment. They're bringing back feudalism.  Get vaccine spread high wear mask avoid crowds.

Well, ask... That's truth, may hoped hear point time, reality situation. Right, considering masking Manhattan rather religious, dense borough fine. unvaccinated probably live Queens Brooklyn. Yeah, many people walking perti dishes, October could even contagious variant. Especially people catch Delta feel need get vaxxed. end game: Covid becomes “variant” flu i.e. new Covid variants everyone catch while. accept reasonable number die year (Eg 30k die flu year US perhaps similar number Covid). 

I mean eventually everyone take vaccines gotten it, everyone else get infected recover die. Since vaccines 100% effective preventing infection transmission (and people recover could get re-infected), means it’ll endemic. 

Fortunately, vaccines highly effective preventing death/hospitalization point, probably won’t even bother track new cases anymore, maybe deaths maybe number cases ICU. like flu. Nobody knows many catch flu year knowledge many die it. Makes sense?

If makes sense, number daily new cases US (100k+) might starting irrelevant; number hospitalized/dead become better measure whether we’re close end state.

Since deaths lag new cases 2-4 weeks, we’ll know close end state: number deaths remain low, we’re close end state ie people, getting Covid big deal anymore. deaths high, means we’re still quite far end state… sue, likely won’t win. Federal law prohibit private employers mandating vaccination employees. Montana state currently prohibits private employers mandating vaccination condition employment. However, lot bills similar Montana law consideration many states.  wouldn’t call undemocratic per say, censorship video games, like there’s certain games can’t get due censorship, downright weird American eyes…especially Aussie film industry making things like [Bad Boy Fear sells better logic I’ve noticed new excuse people getting COVID point.

“I juuuuust get vaccine, hadn’t time yet!”

This attempt deflect responsibility themselves, onto “responsibilities.” 

It literally takes 5 minutes, pull drugstore get done zero appointment, free. 

It’s one easiest things world do. That’s wildest part me. I’m religious fact able make vaccine quickly closest thing I’ve ever seen miracle lifetime, yet people actually believe miracles reject it. 

Maybe seems like bigger deal actually social distancing whole time people whatever wanted vaccine makes difference them. math makes sense. ton deaths period time vaccines yet. Comparing timeframes way irrelevant. 

It's like February 1st told ""hey look, 97% new cancer patients diagnosed January 3% February, month February protects cancer!"" Why'd get two different ones? wrong. thing though pushers fraud concerned affect them, affects them.

I'm assuming since mentioned ""team"" employer coordinated testing?  us hard believe! Everyone thought 19th July, restrictions dropped Delta rampant, would bring huge rise cases. many people wearing masks wherever I've been, dropped around 95% around 40% last 2 weeks, social distancing, nightclubs open, cases fallen cliff!

I see going well. Give couple weeks Never thought I'd see local paper make front page /r/Coronavirus! Seems click baity. Technically correct delta dangerous - sense spreads more/faster - people get sick, end serious illness.

I dont believe known yet dangerous per case level.

Also using % cases purposely manipulating data make seem worse kids. 

Hell - could argue kids cases higher 19%.  Kids make ~20% population, 5% overall get vaccine rates arent great.

That's promotes vaccine hesitancy.

Time mask mandates, vaccine mandates, vaccine passports.



If want people right thing, reward antiVa fools right thing. Here’s thing. get saying, circles, nobody gives shit “scientists” say. It’s far important general population putting peer pressure people vaccinated. Far important general population blame, yes, blame unvaccinated extending pain selfish reasons. Disease specialists doctors information providers. Wikipedia first sources will. Peers affect decision making far info sources. 

(And talking “scientists” monolithic block bunch specialists biggest giveaway taking political stance, BTW) health workers know what's best case? use force needed? expect someone doesn’t consider drivers employees talking recent LA county mask mandate, back July. takes exact restrictions stop exponential growth 1000 cases/day 0 cases/day, difference open stop latter.

Europe never chance latter, chance, have. Fwiw, I'm one cities delta, eliminated it, ears still ringing nightclub last night. Covid 1000 allow that, there's nothing recommend - look Sydney.

As mutation replication still contend relative rest worlds populated countries, US still well terms containing replication spread virus within population. original point yes would help slow replication possibly prevent future mutation/variants, statistically significant (that's say it, worth it). Watching interview journalist doctor CNN, headline says “covid hospitalizations going up, doctors worried infected vaccinated people” thing doctor interviewed says vaccinated people go hospital mild cold like symptoms, it’s infuriating headline implies exact opposite, vaccinated people usual scapegoat cause reason media afraid blaming vaccinated people it’s easier blame ones job.

Definitely works everywhere it’s pretty common experience Conventional vaccines grow Corona virus lab, kill inject body produces antibodies, mRNA vaccines molecules contain instructions body make copies spike protein surface Corona virus. body creates millions copies spike protein, immune system detects creates antibodies spike protein, get infected real Corona virus, antibodies ready.

Conventional vaccines preferrable side effects mRNA vaccines though effectivenes slightly lower mRNA ones. 

Unfortunately, conventional vaccines available North America made India &amp; China. approved Western World. :-( law effectively prevents that, even attempted it, they’d stripped licenses life.

The hospitals would fucking themselves, like bunch nurses EMTs healthcare workers hand replace striking ones with.

The best time strike now, barrel.  get sentiment, lets people use ""Oh, FDA pressured it, they're \*really\* approved"" argument.

Of course, large number ""It's fully approved yet"" bullshitters probably make transition anyway, articles like helpful. Stats given Hutchinson’s press conference past Tuesday:

Cases: 95.29% UNvaccinated, 4.71% vaccinated 

Hospitalizations: 94.58% UNvaccinated, 5.42% vaccinated

Deaths: 97.01% UNvaccinated, 2.99% vaccinated 

Arkansas less 37% fully vaccinated. Breakthrough cases decent sized chunk hospitalizations—especially areas higher vaccination rates. That’s expected. Vaccines still keep total number hospitalizations lower would’ve otherwise. 

Here’s good explanation breakthrough cases: think issue since hospital want pay more, insult intelligence worth raising salary paying new people way more.

You could say bad blood, really, still insulted ways far beyond mere words. quit rehire yourself, bad blood good blood.

I'm sure clinics raise wages competitively even old workers fairness. ones good blood, deservedly so. friend works hospital indeed sporadically ""improve morale"". Medicare runs 10% overhead. Private insurance 30% overhead. Much less waste yes.

FULL TEXT ARTICLE:


NEW DELHI — Earlier year, catastrophic surge coronavirus cases ripped India, killing tens thousands matter weeks, plunging sharply. even markets reopened street life resumed, virus hasn’t faded away.

In parts India, might even inching back.

Just weeks India regained footing second wave, pockets sustained transmission nationwide, including south, creating ripples concern resurgence. Fresh daily cases, sometimes edged 40,000 concentrated state Kerala, highlighting difficulty stamping highly infectious delta variant even country antibody studies suggest two-thirds population previous exposure virus.

India’s experience delta variant, responsible nearly 90 percent cases May peak second wave, offers preview countries, including United States China, grapple stubbornly persistent variant.

In states India, rate transmission going “in wrong direction,” V.K. Paul, senior health official, told reporters Tuesday. “That shows virus wishes expand. must curb might.”


Public health experts government officials divided severe India’s next surge arrive — comes all. largely agree coronavirus likely continue dog vulnerable swaths India, world, least 80 percent population vaccinated acquired antibodies exposure.

Aggressive testing, contact tracing, cooked meals: Indian state Kerala flattened coronavirus curve

The country’s genomics surveillance consortium said July delta variant remains “dominant lineage new cases” country. variant first identified India 2020.

“We’re going live virus whether want not, virus going find way live us,” said Giridhar Babu, epidemiologist based Bangalore Public Health Foundation India. “Vaccination exit strategy pandemic.”

Less 10 percent India’s population fully vaccinated, country’s vaccine drive rolling slower expected amid hesitancy production woes.

Now, worrying data beginning resurface.

This week, researchers said basic reproduction number, R0, several Indian states rose back 1 exceeded 1 first time since early May, suggesting rate transmission could re-accelerating.

The current epicenter Kerala, southern state hailed globally pandemic management first wave 2020. state accounted nearly half 30,000 cases reported country Tuesday. Neighboring Karnataka Tamil Nadu states ordered travelers Kerala present negative coronavirus tests border checkpoints. area concern northeast, least six states reporting positivity rate 10 percent.

The delta variant continuing vex health officials researchers two months India’s case numbers touched horrific peak May 414,000 daily cases, suddenly dropped stabilized 40,000.

Britain faced similar drop recently, new cases plummeting daily week even public health experts predicted exponential surge caused variant.

In India, experts say sharp decline result Indians staying home amid harrowing unprecedented scenes: Entire families infected, hospitals overwhelmed. Patients died want oxygen, bodies cremated parks parking lots crematoriums ran space. Others attribute falloff virus exhausting itself; infected everyone could.

My whole family infected India’s devastating coronavirus surge. survived.

Whatever reason, delta variant lingering India, taking root elsewhere. United States, Centers Disease Control Prevention warned variant spreads easily chickenpox treated almost novel virus, according internal document obtained Washington Post.

Epidemiologists say nationwide seroprevalence survey released July, checks blood samples presence coronavirus antibodies, may offer clues regions susceptible. Two-thirds country’s population appeared antibodies spring wave, study showed.

Kerala reported 44 percent seropositivity, lowest among major states, Maharashtra, sprawling western state devastated April, reported 58 percent.

“Increased mobility lockdown relaxations combined fact larger susceptible population lead cases,” Rijo John, health economist based Kerala, said current spike state.

As Tuesday, India administered 476 million coronavirus vaccine shots, 105 million population nearly 1.4 billion received doses, according government data. Months-long supply shortages continue mar rollout efforts.

In Tamil Nadu, neighbors Kerala, Senthil Karuppiah, head coronavirus response Madurai’s Rajaji Hospital, said hospital administered thousands vaccine doses peak earlier year, constant shortage lowered 500 800 per day, said far few.

“We definitely emergency,” Karuppiah said. “We could’ve vaccinated southern states two months vaccines.”

The Indian government shared varying numbers India’s monthly vaccine production. Bharati Pawar, junior health minister, told Parliament recently “estimated production capacity” two locally produced vaccines 147.5 million per month — much lower number doses needed achieve target vaccinating adults end year. Sputnik, Russian vaccine, also available country limited quantities.

Another lesson India’s experience dealing delta wave: Infection among children isn’t likely severe. steered conversation India whether reopen elementary schools shut 15 months. state Punjab resumed in-person classes age groups week.

Rajendra Bhosale, official district Ahmednagar Maharashtra, said May, nearly 9,000 coronavirus cases detected among children, 10 percent cases. majority cases asymptomatic, said.

In Karnataka, people younger 20 accounted nearly 12 percent coronavirus infections past five months, marginal increase earlier, according analysis state’s coronavirus data management team. deaths reported.

These numbers par data shared UNICEF infection rates among children: Fourteen percent coronavirus infections 103 countries made people younger 20. mortality rate age group less 1 percent.

Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health, following situation India closely, said difficult predict next wave land. delta variant appears infectious another wave prevented 80 90 percent population vaccinated, estimated.

Hundreds millions Indians inoculated, Jha added.

“Much India still vulnerable,” said. “That’s keeps awake night think coming weeks months.” crisis would much better handled functioning democracy.

There also article calculated chances dying beyond 1 1m. figure percentage vaccine 0.0009%. 

However, 6 clot cases recorded Australia lead death 5 6 women. Suggesting may higher chance occurring women. know yet. 

Though guess we'll find soon enough there's push vaccinate available vaccine Sydney due current outbreak. What's vaccination rate UK. There's answer. Well, response cite 'major factor' adds stated yes covid absolutely transmitted surfaces. People touch surfaces, pick virus touch mouth, nose eyes. takes average 72 hours covid infected person room virus detectable surfaces. encourage dig science. anti-mask activist (definitely assuming, offense intended) need discuss further. 40 children admitted overloaded Florida hospitals today. One day, one state. Even states addressed highest vaccination rates millions unvaccinated people walking around, many children eligible vaccine. critical issue masks help reduce transmission.  get vaccine, yes card? Proof? Ok, walk way.  get vaccine no. Say line outside. We'll shortly. current spike starts coming peak, already happening U.K. (for whatever worth) people aggregate daily updates Twitter seem think 1-4 weeks away U.S.

Then another uptick related another variant 1-3 months later we'll bring back masks whisper NPIs again. continue cycles long evolution part natural laws universe. cycle, hospitalizations deaths become negligible. However, fail matter court public opinion idea every transmission must avoided might turn brain-eating long COVID, rate headlines skyrocketing case numbers always earn clicks.

I assume either point we'll get sick repeated cycle entertain audacious idea done masks (probably anywhere sooner half decade away) rest lives look like this. ""vaccines get us back normal"" ship sailed. we're left with. Good.

That board member seems like idiot. Preliminary data PHE yet shown significant change hospitalization fatality rates peer reviewed studies yet I’ve seen. evidence contrary? Don’t think so. can't help guilty conscience.

I friend really want see hang anymore, texts always respond really bare minimum, shared passion. anti-vaccine. spoken while, I'm pretty sure he's still anti-vaccine, still hates Gavin Newsom, etc. know drill.

I've saying want hang feel safe world, even though I'm fully vaccinated. truth going out, him. I've going people fully vaccinated, wear masks, believe science. remember last year hung bit wore mask didn't, knew want hang anymore.
The guilty part come ""lying"" him.

It comes knowing maybe would get vaccine said ""I hanging others, we're vaccinated"" ""I hang vaccinated people"" etc. I'm afraid respond: ""If get vaccine, hang out?"" feel like maybe I'm one people could get vaccinated? knows sure, feel like could true.

But truth is, said want around anymore. want ask ""If get vaccine, hang out?"" I'll say yes.

The guilty part comes knowing maybe power prevent getting it, prevent spreading others...

Help. :(

I want hang person anymore. Edited wording adenovirus one also first kind part understand people anti vax case covid MMR, chicken pox, pneumonia (if older), tetanus, etc etc etc countries Europe never removed mask mandates (actually them) experiencing spikes like anywhere else.

Meanwhile UK removed mandates cases stable (for least). think sooner later Western countries go Johnson's path deal it. We've pretty strict rolling based age vulnerability. started 80s healthcare workers went ages 5 years time. new group would offered majority previous group it. Vulnerable young people called 60-65 year olds. time got 50 year olds we'd offered vaccine representing 99% deaths. Uptake groups 90%.

Then carried going 5 year intervals. 18-25 year olds offered start June, mine. second dose next week, 8 weeks first.

From understand US restricted initially older people nearly strict. also wait vast majority vaccine opening younger people.

The advantage UK system extremely effective reducing deaths. downside lots young people who've recently offered vaccine unvaccinated, socialising other, allowing virus spread quickly. still think right choice estimated vaccines saved 60,000 lives. number would probably lower we'd offered younger people sooner.  ""I choice providers anymore""
 
/me Laughs Canadian, eh!

Within past 5 years, I've twice walked Emergency hospital choice, received treatment, left without ever paying bill even asked insurance info.  Incredibly frustrated. know anti-vaxxers copy paste news links every platform know. Good job CDC guy - true. Mississippi currently 85 ICU beds available...: 


That said, Mississippi's governor, Tate Reeves, piece shit lives Trump's butt. He's basically killing Mississippians minute backing conspiracy theorists, denying science sorts insane shit.

Thomas Dobbs, lead health official saint possibly can. poor guy probably lost 20 years life stress Tate Reeves caused nonsense he's spewed. don’t know based NYT article, headline misleading. saying EVERYONE’s premiums co-pays go plan unvaccinated people get hospitalized. 

Everyone gets burned independent vaccine status. indeed seem likely vaccinated person breakthrough case spread well unvaccinated case

Not really, think study Israel possibly also UK suggesting vaccinated individuals tended infect fewer people.  Thanks know, state, understated Florida. Voters allowed state gerrymandered seemingly way we're mercy science deniers refuse take seriously. getting rather hopeless. school year Minnesota start September 8th places here. districts Minneapolis metro area likely announcing policy weeks come. went got re-vaccinated.

What exactly mean ""re-vaccinated""? mean got third dose? mean barely seeing sunlight? prevented going outside? Millions families facing potential eviction, unemployment / underemployment, Covid related deaths, fortunes medical expenses, inflation rise, describe economic fallout word “mild”?

Same happened Australia China. ""Mild"" international guess you’re part upper class society, hasn’t bad guess, stock markets still rallying despite above.

You guess wrong, even live US.  figures ventilation survival coming China start pandemic. would assume fairly accurate. Ohhh sweet! Thank you! I’ll I’m work! discovered temporary heart issues children, FDA requested larger cohort children studied. Unfortunately unless come together one, get vaccinated, mask quarantine (when necessary) nothing done. really starts everyone page. Definitely evil behind this. It’s also unclear long vaccinations last. COVID I’m vaccinated, argument one uncertain implies there’s certainty other, neither certain.

Interesting mRNA vaccines “possibly” inducing greater immune response. spike protein vaccines? positive Lollapalooza. nice incentive lot young people get vaccinated. Still hoping doesn’t though bad. 85% Unvaccinated*. That’s still relatively low number we’ve seeing. It’s related article point manslaughter, disgusting Imagine that, disease likely cause problems vaccine.  Well dopes Depends means living without taste, smell cognition forever. Whoever says delta less deadly idiot 😂 Minorities, especially south, least say government bear largest impact government receive. Minorities Florida, Louisiana, Texas likely essential jobs work home offer insurance. racial disparities lead new data showing black people worse health outcomes, even advantage working home insurance. makes feel hopeless fuck. supposed do? done everything right. socially distanced, wore mask, got vaccinated soon possibly could. It’s still enough doesn’t seem like ever be. guess it’s another year miserable. point I’m starting feel like I’d rather risk getting seriously ill “living” like this. 

Fuck virus. much. got plenty issue. people names wrong, missing doses, can't found etc. Vaccines neutralizing never evidence would stop transmission .. , prevent infection.

This true. plenty evidence.

Starting CDC study: second dose vaccine (the recommended number doses), risk infection reduced 90 percent two weeks vaccination...""

Everyone knows part, important remainder little learning dangerous thing. Drink deep taste Pierian spring. shallow draughts intoxicate brain. Oh, met neighbors? honest fever, chills muscle aches walk park compared could happen unvaxxed. Glad I’m vaxxed well family. Also happily get booster need to. sure right message US putting moment.

It's even message. plain wrong statement period.

Vaccines decrease transmission. stop 100% never goal one ever gave shit. shortage healthcare workers already number frontline vaccine. interesting watch unfold next months cases continue increase. I’m boat. Thinking getting 3rd dose. peer reviewed clinical evidence benefits yoga entire field chiropracty. extent misinformation vaccine adequately accounted for. Initial vaccine rollout AWESOME. impressive numbers first couple months assumed represent widespread adoption would 80%+ vaccination end summer (with 12's follow soon after).

What wildly optimistic projections missed many people would reject vaccination. quick browse social media (including Reddit) would told high wall recalcitrance hit. get sense preparation this. also think car drivers pay premiums, even ones multiple DUIs?  Baseball stadiums across country packed every single night months, along concerts events across country none super spreader event. 

I wonder everyone centered solely Lolla, required vaccinations negative covid test, different whatsoever.   blood test available provide rating good ones’ immune system is? Indonesia used Sinovac seems less effective mRNA based vaccines. know starting give Pfizer boosters. problem vaccines gonna accepted, people coming countries enough vaccines available yet. GoFundMe collapse too? Disagree. thing. allow people transmitting deadly respiratory illness cancer patients even regular patients. life death loads people. same, depends long each. almost 18 months trying stay safe nothing

What Earth talking about? treatment methods improved leaps bounds driving survival rate substantially higher. vaccine offers virtually guaranteed protection fatal contraction. Catching good nowhere nearly serious 18 months ago heard virus March 2020 that, got it, result hospitalization death - it’s hard see society locking eradicate it. That’s case majority vaccinated population.

Edit: word Shortage skilled workers lead higher pay.

Pay factor. think many healthcare workers want service idiots need there.  clickbait titles. Here, take healing crystal powder essential oil (it's cocaine meth olive oil, little, tell anyone), cure AIDS Covid time! prove it, book!

/s seeing year Novavax? world absolutely shut down. 

Some parts world shut pretty effectively (ironically supposed fly Vietnam month shit really hit fan, turns great job closing borders keeping COVID almost non existent) world half ass shut exactly problem. half ass shut like closing screen door half way.  really keep bugs out.

But believe Australia one basically almost COVID started letting flights in. 

I've heard friends who's cities literally hard shut government paid stay home. Denmark wherever Europe like ""fuck we're gonna ram shut all"".

Around week shut roads ghost empty. week 2 traffic almost normal. Almost everyone knew found way make business essential somehow. 

So sleep world really shut learn live unfortunately, hope people get vaccinated. Anyone thinks otherwise denial

Oh agree, going anywhere probably going get worse. Best case scenario COVID vaccines become annual like flu deal uptick nasty side effects like organ damage loss taste smell.

Worst case COVID mutates something really deadly basically becomes walking dead time. got second dose 10 days you. Mind follow couple days see you’re doing? Hopefully push mild symptoms most. Sending good vibes 👊🏼 situation going worsen charging fucking governor? news. Unfortunately ignored MSM sexy kill enough people clicks want.  six months? So... would need get boosters every six months continuously protected..? mean seems silly no? Flu year. boosters every 10. 6 months seems stretch. vast majority people vaxxed medical reasons would prevent so. definitely recognize people can't get vaccine, reasonable accommodations made them. parent state governor forbid mask mandates schools, forced back in-person work online school option, nightmare scenario.

Wondering hosptal beds oxygen loved ones. Watch families get welcomed covid ward kids contract Delta variant.

Second society immunized nurses taking care 10% vaccinated people still got sick. beds trauma patients overwhelmed. adult visitors come visit loved ones also vaccinated using proper ppe. people freely go business usual little risk getting sick.  high transmission areas wear mask indoors, fine.

FDA slowed trials demanding thousands kids enrolled, thereby ensuring half kids get stay in-person school, unless send kids back remote “learning,” know long-term damage kids’ development.

The FDA needs one things:

- Allow, mandate, parents vaccinate kids based original data set starting September.

- Issue clear statement kids are, average, safe severe disease, in-person schooling safe even virus spreads schools.

- recommend distance “learning” again, acknowledging going costs decades come.

Masking distancing schools may help slow virus, without vaccines, difference take e.g, 8 weeks instead 6 weeks infect half in-person students. FDA shouldn’t say schools safe long use masks distancing. bet that’s exactly do, cases schools cold flu season get completely control, issue new guidance middle panic, again. think replied wrong person. media start putting stories people still getting flu getting flu shot? thing. Yes! sanity! One sensible things I’ve read here. People keep saying “we need learn live virus.” Well… are. That’s exactly we’re doing. Living virus means wearing mask community spread reaches high substantial levels, staying date latest booster shots, yes sometimes practicing risk mitigation best practices like socially distancing. Holy fuck that's amazing analogy. I'm borrowing that. pressure open things back remove mandates soon vaccinations surged.

So let's use ""evidence"" see plays out:

  Standard deduction: $0 taxes paid first 12,550 earned
   10%: $  994.90 paid earnings 12,551 22,500

Must american thing, Belgium difference kids variants far comes hospitalisations. see point die once.

Over lifetime odds listed stand really bad lets stop pretending COVID like black plague. smile. Healthcare United States stopped best patient instead became business. Patient satisfaction care about. patient happier get med makes feel better tomorrow rather putting work changing healthy lifestyle. Telling someone need stop drinking, lose weight, stop smoking forbidden. can’t tak COVID. smile repeat company mask mandate. nurse next transferred ICU got watch people die year bites tongue think back intubations talks family members knowing full well they’ll never see loved one again. Things aren’t fine. think money executives, politicians, insurances profiting COVID hospitals today's situation they'd enough pay workers spending almost 24 hours day high stress front lines work effort.

Give time off, hire new help provide enough ""profits"" bottom line.

Sure, unlikely get accident even speeding, you’d super negligent did. news story parent throwing unbuckled kindergartner front seat speeding resulting fatal crash, story would get hundreds upvotes angry comments. COVID risk even everything right get vaccine (just like cars risk even seatbelts, air bags speed limits), aren’t even buckling school “seatbelt” case, putting children extra unnecessary danger. That’s outrageous part. America already resources limited. get caught binge drinking wait list liver, bumped lower list allow someone careful receive liver first. see coming? 👀 think using statements like ""may needed"" ""likely needed"" added caveat, typically, situation constantly changing would lead people conclusion lol.

What's absolutely amazing many people openly admit ""numbers person"", second numbers become important part assessing problem magically act like PhD Discrete Mathematics.

So here's little help you. COVID R0 estimated 5 8. COVID Original 2.4 2.6.

Let's look lower end third string infections caused vaccinated versus unvaccinated group delta:

All Unvaccinated: 1 person likely infect 5 others (5+1=6 total). 5 infect 5 others(6+25=31), 25 infect 5 others well(125+31=156). That's 156 infected people. Based mortality rate, 156 people infected carelessness, killed someone.

All Vaccinated: 1 breakthrough case (7% chance) likely expose 5 others. 5 expose, 30% chance made least one 5 sick. Assuming 30% chance happened, another 30% chance make 1 5 exposed sick. Assuming 30% chance happened, another 30% chance make 1 5 exposed sick. Long odds means instead 156 people infected, 40% chance infected 3 people 4 total. Mortality rates among vaccinated MUCH lower unvaxed. chances killed someone statistically round 0.

**Why would get vaxed? want people dead understand probabilities exponential spread?**

Lets R0=8

Unvax: 1 becomes 8 (8+1=9) becomes 64 (64+9=73) becomes 512 (512+73=585). killed 5 people

Vaxed: 1 becomes 56% chance 1 becomes 56% chance 1 becomes 56% chance 1. again, statistically killed one. Fully vaxxed masked time. got COVID alert phone saying possibly exposed 7/ 27, today 8/5. spent weekend 93 year old grandmother aunt passed (not COVID related) kind making feel anxious.

DeSantis objects constituents alive Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Where? don’t see anywhere bot’s comment.  Well duh, everything reopen 100% longer trapped home. imagine numbers schools reopen nationwide month. sub shitshow. Yeah that’s pretty good answer! I’d also add many unvaccinated people get sick hospitalized, that’s *also* problem everyone strains limits resources available taking care people need care given time. data waiting for? think actual virus trustworthy? currently illegal. Smoking surcharge specifically allowed  offers double normal shifts though read fine print. I’ve seen offers high we’re 5x12 something like hours higher

Standard 3x12 amounts charged hospitals insurers oh no, Capitalism working wrong direction. /s peak working NY per diem ICU nurses making amount per hour hospital doctors 😂

Was shitshow though nurses definitely deserved it. annoyed doctors wasnt high nursing pay hospital cut physician pay work conditions craziness. Can't remember hospital works at, sister works peds, called offered contract would get paid additional $23/hr next 3 months, end three months get permanent pay increase. thing, work additional 12hr shift month. So, already gets paid $27 since works nights, plus extra $23, since extra day considered overtime, that's time half. Pretty good nurse, dreadfully exhausted. old. include Microsoft need include Intel, IBM, Oracle, etc… FAANG really arose dot com era.

For precedent comment, ask led think Jacobson precedent? widely regarded landmark public health case. two sections majority opinion discuss bounds situation they're ruling for, SCOTUS indicates case considered precedent substantially similar cases (or parts cases). Sure modern court could overturn like anything else stays. love feeling wind blowing hollow, soulless body.

Roman Catholic Church even agree Church's teaching use certain vaccines distant historical association abortion?
 number vaccines made descendent cells aborted fetuses. Abortion grave crime innocent human life. always ask physician whether product proposes use historical association abortion. use alternative vaccine one mean say products made ""descendent cells""?
 cells medium vaccines prepared. cell lines consideration begun using cells taken one fetuses aborted almost 40 years ago. Since time cell lines grown independently. **It important note descendent cells cells aborted child. never, themselves, formed part victim's body.**

Parents check physician regarding efficacy availability vaccine.
 vaccines alternatives?
 present alternative vaccines available United States rubella (German measles), varicella (chickenpox), hepatitis A. grown cell lines WI-38 and/or MRC-5. (See note #7 statement Pontifical Academy Life listing vaccines source).
 alternative vaccine produced cell lines?
 morally free use vaccine regardless historical association abortion. **The reason risk public health, one chooses vaccinate, outweighs legitimate concern origins vaccine. especially important parents, moral obligation protect life health children around free refuse vaccinate children grounds conscience?

 use vaccines encourage others destroy human life research purposes?
 use, one register complaint manufacturer products acceptable form conscientious objection. signals opposition wider, morally reprehensible practice using unborn little research material science. moral obligation register complaint order use vaccines.
 obvious vaccine use cases contribute directly practice abortion since reasons abortion related vaccine preparation.**

Important parts bold. Texas illegal nursing unions collectively bargain strike. Great question. Vaccine card guess. Oh least iPhone shot providers medical chart app phone linked Apple health app, vaccinations listed immunizations Health app. Nothing manually added section health app either far tell. could show screen plus paper card lieu something formal. Would ever start triaging based vaccination status? good news I'm surprised saddened requirement now. Nah, there’s always new nurses pay $24/hr get shit day night get experience. thought awesome new nurse let work 40-60hrs overtime. realized overtime pay still less travel nurses float pool’s standard pay. power daughter got first job movie theater $8.50 hour. she’s going selling tickets sweeping popcorn, treating people medically emergency situations! Neither article video mention anyone's vaccine status. also unclear much power step-mother part this, better worse.

Hopefully twins recover fully, family still needs get vaccinated, they're process so. original point yes would help slow replication possibly prevent future mutation/variants, statistically significant (that's say it, worth it).

I know else say wrong. That’s we’ve using. holding hope help, even little. know aren’t hospital grade, felt slightly better cloth mask. guess they’ll really put test unfortunately. Honestly hospital cut everyone’s pay last year (dropped bonuses cancelled cost living raises) paying temp workers absolutely crazy money left sour taste people’s mouths. Like third team including quit things calmed down. basically stuck around things horrible didn’t want abandon patients definitely felt undervalued hospital couldn’t see going another wave. ended retiring now, people found less intense jobs. Realistically, stepmother, probably legal standing get vaccinated. 

This bad decision made kids' father (if alive/involved) mother. Wow! thought BC (Canada) good, make appointment nearby mass vaccination clinic, plan around that. easy enough move appointment around, still half hour errand, drive there, get shot, wait 15 minute, head out.

I moved second dose wife went time, lunch break. *thought* pretty easy, getting shot shopping store includes pharmacy would even easier!

Another argument whole body chose get sick - that's well good get covid need hospital, someone's grandma heart attack can't get ambulance they're getting covid patients. defies logic.

/s upvote. people tonight over-emotional crazy today.  numbers game.

think way: original strain person would around infected individual maybe 10 15 minutes guarantee infection.

Vaccines push exposure number far essentially can't catch it.

With Delta variant, need exposed person less minute guarantee infection without vaccinated.

So, shortens duration vaccinated person needs exposed order guarantee infection. 

As vaccinated individual, I'm particularly concerned catching covid grocery shopping without mask. However recognize attend party, could potentially become infected. could definitely look like that, think could also look selfishly. get vaccinated, there's much lower chance I'll get it, even lower chance I'll hospitalized, even lower chance I'll die. Also selfish perspective, I'm helping protect love (I young kids can't get vaccinated yet, gave lot peace mind go grocery shop, etc.) absolutely, side benefit I'm stopping virus mutating. even someone single healthy really unlikely die Covid, getting vaccine helps prevent spread (protecting others around might vulnerable) gives less chance mutate. Win win really. Thanks share! Yea exactly.

However, selfish putting lives caring risk. disgusting. way keep yearly chance getting Covid 100% retain ""lockdown lifestyle"" ( Work home, social distancing, meeting people outdoors keeping unnecessary travel minimum, etc) rest life. fun that.  really suck. think worst case situations like probably another 6 months. laws overseas that's hard enough. Hang hate fucking headlines like that. Give anti vaxxers fuel fire really full story. Hospital system collapse, probably. People died COVID-19 materials staff exist. saw original Delta several orders magnitude worse. wave hitting hospitals right much larger last winter.

When happens death rate goes substantially. around 10% without medical care alpha. Delta, well we'll find soon....

We're going see failures, even united States. Sounds like need find new physician Yes, 100%. seems case, least much weaker immunity variants. vaccines good idea general fight pandemic there's less chance evolving. people get Covid, chance evolve new variants develop.  realise island right?

No, it‘s non-scientific fear-mongering. continue listen science reddit comments. lose sense smell and/or taste? so, returned? One trend I'm seeing also use recent news breakthrough cases masks required invalidate benefit vaccine. Basically add another risk benefits vaccine clearly garbage (their thinking- mine). 

Ultimately there's probably 15-20% population who's going perform whatever acrobatics necessary obnoxious this. another 25% got vaccine still conservative leaning going fuel flames social media.

So happening delta USA UK good thing? please stop catering sensibilities anti-vaxers? 

Amen! cannot reason unreasonable. like arguing wind. donny certain point, ""what necessary precautions"" shifts something experts dictate something individuals must consider light personal risk tolerance, personal health attributes, area attributes (such vaccination rates...which CDC's measure completely ignores) Buried bottom article:

“Her husband child bad colds since recovered” “without doubt, getting vaccinated saved landing hospital worse.”

Suggestion new headline: “COVID vaccine, miracle modern medicine, saves doctor family ravages COVID-19”. so, going long painful, much collateral damage happening. Yep, he's actively working make worse. 

For Public schools. handing vouchers charter schools like candy parents mad lack safety Public schools. deserves 1 million upvotes. Free markets personal responsibility best things remind “conservatives” of.  Oh shit oh fuck community 85% vaccinated, sorry, going uncontrollable spread. hard sell people who’ve told get vaccine, life return normal. Yeah blood thing still something don’t accept vaccines never something they’re thankfully lol Florida man abides rules, hard predict I'm curious vaccine gotten much pushback. vaccines past get much hesitancy people adamant ""safe""? social media made uphill battle? Like vaccine gets full approval FDA, like recipe changed, still stuff beginning emergency approval. Lol understand people's mindset this.

And think many thought vaccine made soon, really wanted wait 2-3 years vaccine available haha. Homie mask head there. Live life. Depression anxiety extremely dangerous. clinical trials conducted lockdowns/masks/social distancing/no delta variant, wouldn’t decrease efficacy *expected* measures removed? making Public schools un-safe possible time giving vouchers Charter schools.

This defund public schooling continue indoctrinate kids.

By banned mask mandate public schools, parents forced decide sending kids somewhere safe getting voucher private school mask mandate. Exactly. We’ve seen time time again. many times cycle need repeat itself? Migrants stealing oxygen now?  Again, it’s 2% risk children. It’s 2% risk kids actually contract covid experience symptoms. huge difference seems confusing people. agree one study - reason remain calm exaggerate numbers cause undue panic. He's pied piper he's fucking leper messiah  scenario imagines turning people away spite principle. commenters suggesting using vaccination status (in context individual's eligibility) triage tool. enough resources, someone getting turned away. one claiming triage going make health workers happy. vaccination status make sense criteria gets first dibs care there's enough go around. Yeah I'm fucking flabbergasted seem say everything wrong *constantly*. ""We need make sure can't deliberately misconstrued people explicitly Titanic scale"" seem concern them. Well UK trending back I’m beginning think way pandemic spreads unpredictable. I’ll interested see next several weeks happens states. cited letter editor, peer reviewed research. consensus research phenomenon childhood vaccination correlate positively negatively diabetes. [One paper published editorial find blame getting second dose, seeing doctors recommended it, going different state showing second appointment, throwing data little bit. 

If lot people that, throw data lot. 

Hopefully put system place record types doses properly. think personal hygiene key? think people masking opted vaccination instead people relying vaccination masking? think you’re confused. Next week: Florida ban private companies urging judges block ban. bans way down, 'cause freedom Right? solace got decent short term gig 'safe zone' got enjoy world bit. Putting onus store owners definitely rough without comprehensive plan. 

And cops won’t it, half aren’t even vaccinated Yes - correct. believe ADF asked assistance number times. PM denied assistance states NSW asked it. came - think symbolic protests. military actually power situation - can't actually anything meaningful toward citizens (maybe crowd control?). think maybe also help hotel quarantine NSW, I'm sure... many 2021? took science classes labs online several years ago. overwhelming majority people they're taking care disease whose worst effects could completely avoided they're listened health professionals. 
 
Something tells they're probably difficult patients deal behavior-wise. Like, take patients year ago, rank according well comply doctor/nurse instructions, take *bottom third*, make 90% current patients. It’s cuz 48other conspired Florida make Covid cases badder everyones else’s. Lol pinché DeSantis you’re people talking about. People like (traditionally) aren’t able get vaccines whatever reason protected herd immunity. many refusing so, resulting making vulnerable population (like you) even risk. angry people eligible get vaccinated refusing so. Vaccinated people protect people like you. willfully unvaccinated throwing unborn baby wolves. Great news. tricky everyone entitled opinion - lot opinions feel based anything except fear propaganda.""

Oh, we’re also expected record go come back bathroom.  Japan enough supply according recent news. bought vaccines mean they're delivered. Logistics bottleneck largely initial rollout. rest world absolutely supply issue. Ah right on, following closely 55%, good thought, definitely looks like come one less-vaccinated parts  days old sure still relevant, infection happening almost two years ago due earlier variant, coupled fact vaccines provide equal antibodies last longer previous infection, seem far fetched say antibodies waned fighting much worse disease variant first time around. 

And sure, new vaccine, point millions received version it, many point year ago. Generally vaccine side effects going pop quickly never problem vaccine before, unlikely problem one. 

Not say risk something adverse absolutely zero, nothing life sure thing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Seriously. biggest liars world claim made mistakes. gonna die Yeah, would explain old people used dropping like flies vaccine. /s That’s fantastic news. Obviously there’s info missing terms age, race, time infection compared think grand scheme things solid example vaccine working agree we’d literally President history charge, things would gone differently, disagree there’s kind legal basis US kind lockdowns seen elsewhere. (Much would liked seen happen.) Further, don’t think political enact kinds lockdowns (and aid citizens would necessitated) would existed matter charge. bar crawl part.

Edit: presumably part return home ever came less 0.0037% breakthrough infections result hospitalization, yeah I'm pretty sure people say ""I'm done"".

Just forgot basic risk assessment mean rest US did. School shootings say hi. trial happened world fully open, countries closed borders, everyone wearing masks socially distancing. -\_- mean, take genius know real time results would different. Well considering governor said equivalent “We’ve tried nothing we’re ideas”, get worse. readily available.  fine though what’s point? definitely result helicopter parenting, combined ""rugged individualism"" using kids proxies political agendas/beliefs/conspiracy theories. ""Taking reasonable precautions public health safety affects everyone? kids!!"" JOEY DOESNT SHARE FOOD also think lack travel wasn’t long term Spanish influenza 1918. people getting one part world next hours risk tempting fate, want second this. Live NJ, highly vaxxed area it. Kids colds last week got tested, it. Wife I, vaxxed, negative.

I say perhaps one positive way people getting tested, even they're vaccinated, among family social circle. Everyone would obviously quarantine received positive.

But yeah... know single breakthrough case yet, know similar situations among co-workers NYC found someone tested positive unvaxxed. tested negative. Looking picture, can’t imagine why… J&amp;J knocked ass 24 hours back March. Never response vaccine before. Maximum benefits state (including $300) $1000 week. Works $26/hr. Quite bit higher minimum wage Provincetown outbreak kind considered success though. barely hospitalizations vaccines worked. this. exactly feel don’t understand others don’t feel way. like it? work United Airlines then. appalling thing I've read today. hurts stomach. would bet 10% entire event unvaccinated. mean, even vaccine, people getting covid literally got symptoms. random, like disease. Yes! know last year county piloting hybrid, priorities kids need extra resources ESOL, learning disabilities, special education None got hospitalized though, vaccine supposed do? -\_- reach point herd immunity quickly? really say 70 percent efficacy isn’t good? Mind you, people US took J&amp;J young time don’t need hospitalized anyway… WHAT????  I'm SHOCKED!!

OK, feel bad kids, want kids get sick. far snarky comment...it directed towards dumb adults life comment stands. Never miss opportunity try reinstate segregation. Stay classy! YEAHH it’s terrible joke wanted say it. :D paid 2500 get vaccine. Source: friends United pilots I've actually asked question close, geneticist friend mine, want believe polyclonal nature spike mRNA provide lot future proofing mutations spike itself. seems untrained mind viral mutations defeat neutralizing behavior vaccine antibody would also render spike less effective. 

His response spike 1,273 amino acids long theory 1273^20 possible configurations. functional, that's huge number need hit sweet spots. mutations arise every 6-9 months, it'll outpace ability identify them, adjust mRNA coding, produce distribute boosters.

It's dismal view, I'm preparing serious immune escape variant next 18-36 months best can, begins emotional acceptance merely possible. Ok get people still going get COVID even Vaccine whole point Vaccine stop people dying going hospital doing.

In reality can't close everything that's possible way USA least when, everyone option get vaccinated COVID

and close everything mean COVID go away forever would require whole wide world effort doubt exists confirm. Lots pilot friends fly United. reason vaccinated earlier United gave $2500(captains more) Yes, real reason businesses want people vaccinate, return normal without extra precautions. actually cost implement them.

Last year masks + precautions, year also delta variant spreads really well despite them. Lol don’t know. know it’s thing. healthcare company work came yesterday requiring everyone vaccinated. Though I’m sure religious reasons excuse. I’m going try find Monday would justify one they’re allowing it. Would rather use legal portal instead? too. largely irrelevant. Chief Executive taken action let take court rule unconstitutional. can't assume know court would rule, especially crisis affecting entire nation killed Americans WW2 less time. Well that's concerning, thanks sharing.  say that, yet Vermont higher vaccinated percentage they're climbing “Don’t quarantine don’t test” - district, probably technically know anyone circle friends/ family who's COVID, I'm sure least us gotten realized.

None us done anything special, we've lucky enough get symptoms. 

Having said that, friends family including feel like crap days even without symptoms. I’m saying sick doesn’t suck you’re alive. even pretty bad case Covid worth never going restaurant eat inside. movie theaters, live performances kind. Kids eternally home schooled social interaction can’t see that’s worth giving getting sick.  Stop insulting incompetent jackasses. scary is, could start.

I'm hoping people see shot across bow react accordingly - immediate 180 beyond risky course action. looked Florida's vaccination numbers actually much higher expected...about 50% fully vaxxed, almost 60% first dose. Kind curious levels need get things calm down. Also curious Northeast see another surge weather gets colder (not bad ones surge, nonetheless). Preach... WFH godsend winter we'd normally sick felt like months end. Wrong DeSatan give context, I’m leaving see LDR partner Sunday 7:40ish morning. need results that’s ask! Whichever ones left probably I’ve saying since vaccine rollouts - someone eligible refuses get vaccine, get black tag.  25-45% Americans estimated caught Covid already though. adds herd immunity quick, even overlaps vaccines.

I feel reached herd immunity already Delta didn’t bump requirement 70% 80%.

Netherlands &amp; UK recovering ~3 weeks surge sign pandemic ending soon. able vaccinate children would lift huge weight.. fearful safety amidst wave highly contagious delta variant kid around. CDC eyes Florida, fully expecting variants spring there, variants may higher chance bypass antibodies Delta does. Well comment chain none us want on. Frankly, Days don’t go perfectly. Parents (most) expectation kid’s school experience near perfect. 

Having parents observe every melt friendship problem kids lessons recesses going helpful preserving dignity children dealing big feelings. 

I’m also open observed parents, grandparents, whatever people room child logs on. Imagine every decision make throughout day analyzed picked apart countless others? wouldn’t intention behind implementing livestreams lessons would surely byproduct. 

No. Hell no. I’m discounting smartest thing prevent get vaccine wear mask things really bad. there’s certain point think harm good everyone stay inside indefinitely everything look forward canceled fear getting sick. Mental health also important Sending positive thoughts! hope get time OP! Best luck :) Unfortunately it’s 24 hours already… Hopefully it’ll come soon!  I've got point think anti vax people given ankle bracelets let homes. bought Lutema ones Amazon dissected appeared 5-6 actual different layers. tie straps fit 4.5 year old. got kf94 kid sized becuase like daughter doesn’t like aren’t pink. also Provincetown outbreak among vaccinated folks: mean PCR test? I've gotten three ID tests travel, results always came back within 24h. Florida winning Olympic gold covid infections.  Well either there's kids infected percentage lot higher that. 500,000 kids infected 0.001% hospitalized 500 kids hospital. think past 500 kids hospital across country. Outcomes-based context obesity death CoViD:

\~80% US deaths CoViD among obese, represent \~42% population.

... so... obese folk **about twice likely** die CoViD non-obese folk.

Men aged 45 54 **about twice likely** die CoViD women aged 45 54.

Residents majority native counties (where reservations found), have, average, **about twice likely die** CoViD residents minority native counties; currently attribute reduced healthcare options overall infrastructure.

Now start getting major factors:

Unvaccinated folk represented \~98% US CoViD deaths since got oldsters mostly vaccinated; interpret mean unvaccinated folk **about 46 times likely** die CoViD vaccinated folk.

Folk age 85 **about 6,300 times likely** die CoViD age 18, and, folk ages 75 84 **are 2,400 times likely** die CoViD age 18.

Finally, anyone gets CoViD infinitely likely die CoViD someone get it.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 get infected - (infinitely better outcomes)

\#2 young (thousands times better outcomes)

\#3 Get vaccinated (46 times better outcomes)

\#4 decent health infrastructure (2 times better outcomes)

\#4 BMI 30 (2 times better outcomes)

\#5 female (1.2 times better -- across age groups) reminds GameStop January. Fair enough. read comments this. stop allowing anti vax people hospitals covid. religions would it? heard lot Catholics, align Church's stance basically states mRNA vaccines cause problems, vector vaccines also ok there's alternative available. Meh, yearly get combined flu shot. big deal either way. know anecdotal I'm know two people it, got vaccinated got again. miserable. Another two friends vaccinated one ended hospital almost respirator. told know six vaccinated people sick COVID. Several dealing long haul recovery.

There's also Provincetown outbreak that's news. 

We're vaccinated hate put family another lockdown that's we're thinking might best us want take chance get lucky enough ""mild"" case. Bulgaria next Romania half vaccinated Romania bunch tourists zero measures. week cases started increase Covid like flu. /s Yeah, hands purse strings, throats anyone capable mitigating damage he's causing. wonder he's called DeSatan. Wonder many hospitalized event ends. Put veins!!!  testing positive demonized heavily States. Furthermore, Americans given good advice expect long term regards COVID, even vaccines first given out. Long-term planning really thing seems, regards COVID. weirdly-worded headline. think ""more half"" ""more 50%."" initially reads is, ""chances COVID-19 reinfection vaccinated 50%."" reality, opposite! get inner syntaxes semantics right understand underlying math original headline. Makes sense now... bad math sometimes. think realize poorer countries don’t infrastructure house vaccines. Pfizer’s shot alone needs special freezer. would love see rest world vaccinated well, there’s lot logistically happen possible. Also would like point people don’t care others right now. It’s extremely unfortunate, wish wasn’t like downvoted coming psycho care last post. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Folks, vaccinated, get vaccinated. 

I'm fully vaccinated wake symptoms, Covid far know. Covid, know vaccinated...best luck buddy. play across country. like last year worse Australia island quarantines visitors promised close economy 2022 earliest.

I know &amp; understand lives aren’t equivalent money, next month two bad Florida, strong feeling vast majority Floridians care money getting back normal next 3-6 months. don’t think majority Floridians remember care Happened next month two.

DeSantis gambling big this, might come strong it. time tell.  frankly beds taken COVID patients, happens children bad case RSV flu? Several kids preschool already gotten RSV, one badly enough spend night hospital fluid lungs. Flu season around corner. get bad child (or adult!) states emergency strikes, even COVID. AFAIK pretty easy get, perhaps I'm wrong. local governments pushing vaccination everyone 12 up? Thanks, I'll check sub. FDA fully authorizes covid vaccine.

That part makes lot sense. Thanks. 6 year old 18 months old wife took ER morning stayed back oldest, almost nervous breakdown. doctor got oxygen immediately get electrolytes back up. stayed two nights, mostly stable second day. 

RSV joke far scariest thing I've ever seen two kids. 

My co-workers (most kids) like RS whaaa?? Australia actual lockdowns place (occasionally), strict quarantining international travelers effective contact tracing. Conditions United States gave lip service never actually practiced. Im sure vast cultural differences I'm qualified go also help. people believe vaccine kind magical shield? course still get sick, I’d much rather take risk getting case that’s almost guaranteed mild rather sit house alone never feel weather again. Yeah. students college still live families, making risk transmission daily affair. It’s ridiculous many post-secondary schools returned in-person classes. Yes RSV vaccines trials. would absolutely huge vaccine found. RSV affect older/sicker adults well major contributor morbidity/mortality population. Like COVID vaccine, RSV vaccine would first approved adult populations. mention there's less coughing, heavy breathing, etc point governor willfully killing hundreds people get life sentenced? 

Asking European friend, course 😂 Please elaborate. I’ve taking bed quite while. Small dosage haven’t ended taking increasing amount anything. Dead easy. Walk mass vacc site, pharmacies, pediatricians offices. appointments needed mass sites. preference Moderna Pfizer? Seems like Moderna might larger dose, might also reporting slightly better numbers?

Is reason trust pfizer since they're larger company? first thought was…. harsh already know answer. But, (sarcasm) good thing districts requiring quarantining exposure! keep sending them.

Maybe drier heat, else rural? Tough say. Honestly should/must requirement children. anti corona vax still pro vax lol. 

I really know people assume someone want get vaccinated current vaccines, automatically complete anti. 70% 18, 58% total population. vaxxed? think vaxxed, wear mask try avoid could venture again. 

Still, mental health would deteriorate going staying months people vaccinated case numbers start going would probably best.

Hopefully, months. Hang there. husband, Special Procedures tech, got work. came around May vaccinated everyone. got first shot discussion doctor need one Covid November. Hubs dealing Delta Variant patients every day. feel like got run truck(I react every vaccine like this). I'll oldest grandchild(15.5 yrs) stay next one hubs probably town. Prob 3 times size healthy 16yr old remember reading one group getting bent shape trying require put fucking triangle reflectors back black unlit buggies night many people getting killed killed rear end accidents. want bright orange reflectors religion wants plain shit. Pretty clearly, happened India horrific (and hundreds thousands number severe undercount). Thanks vaccines, we’ll spared worst that.

Nevertheless, arc cases India reassuring. seems like Delta’s M.O. hit hard, fizzle fast thinking would happen . think last time either. Yeah, night shift gets see empty pizza boxes trash. That's it. true pediatric hospitals. RSV often causes respiratory distress infants toddlers, leading greater 60,000 pediatric hospitalizations year United States, many patients need intubated need ICU level care. numbers absolutely dwarf pediatric COVID-19 hospital admissions. point best meet friends worried virus. So, haven’t learned lesson. Fantastic. Good you, courageous. Texas Florida ""Hold beer watch this"". Wtf wrong politicians/administrators?  First country get vaccines mass, way behind countries would agree idk would get downvoted. Oh No! Obese unhealthy morons get vaccinated die COVID. Anyways... cell phone get better reception yet ? Yeah, whole lot discomfort got J&amp;J. fever like 103 pain hurt move hurt move.

The Pfizer vaccine peanuts comparison. Sore arm, great sleep, soreness, league.

There's evidence, including new report Germany hunt down, suggests heterologous vaccinations vector virus followed mRNA leads higher antibody count even two mRNAs.

I doctor, doctor, cannot give advice. comforted increased protection mRNA booster, hope too.

Let know goes, friend. taking precautions still lead bullshit situation described. Vaccinations answer (look England Netherlands marginal death spike despite spiking cases). Sure [basic *R_effective* = *R_0* * *S*.

 * *R_effective* (usually written *R_eff* *R*) average number people infected person infects.
 * *R_0* average number people infected person would infect naive population (i.e. absolutely one immunity).
 * *S* proportion population susceptible.

We estimate *S* looking many people immunity good immunity is. theoretical (impossible) perfect vaccine, *S* = 1 - *V* *V* proportion population vaccinated. Instead better estimate *S* = 1 - *V* * *Ve* *Ve* effectiveness vaccine. Exactly measure complicated effectiveness mean preventing transmission preventing infection. model complicated needing consider natural immunity.

But going basic model simplicity: *R* = *R_0* * (1 - *V*) (we want *R* &lt; 1) *R_0* * (1 - *V*) &lt; 1 *V* 1 - 1/*R_0*. *R_0* 5, need 1-1/5=.8=80% immune. worst case predictions Delta put *R_0* high 9.5, let's round 10 simplify math, need 90% immune.

That translate directly needing 90% population (not adults) vaccinated, that's unreasonable estimate. one, vaccine provide perfect immunity, would suggest need 90% immunity. also, there's people amount natural immunity (worse vaccinated better nothing) get vaccinated. government restrictions minimal, still exist and, probably relevant, there's lot people limiting interactions wearing masks even required law. Sorry please wheel non vaccinated COVID folks parking garage treated. Make room people didn’t drink cool-aid. little sympathy left people can’t see reason believe science. It’s interesting people downvote comment asking adults get time work COVID exposures. wonder McDonald's give vaccine yet. I'm thinking might need to. United allow exceptions religious medical reasons

Yeah, fuck this. religion allow get vaccinated allow work united. 

My religion requires beer hookers provided company expense, provide documentation back up. Eris remarkably flexible way. Got first dose vaccine couple hours ago. Took lot get that. mess booth. Terrified needles anything medical. People certain it’s right thing do. People smarter me. Kinda scared side effects. know right thing don’t feel good it? Anyways, wanted get ether.  problem isn’t water, it’s liquid explosives. Anything acquire secure side already screened.

In theory, anyway. feel like logical conclusion well. site says verify accounts, seen social media companies take hands approach little enforcement. definitely serious issue. I've read vaccines works! know crazy. Like ok let risk death spite. China also solved last COVID outbreak locking people residential complexes. don’t think they’re example follow. Oh, well haven’t heard infections around you, guess everything’s ok. hear guys? guy said doesn’t even know anyone infected! Sounds like whole thing false alarm! Whew! Huge load minds, mate…thanks!  /s I’m sick shit. saying true. spreading rapidly daycares. spreads elementary schools also children transmit younger siblings. need talk protect young children RSV daycare think federal government legal ability impose national lockdown. States ability impose lockdowns, there's clearly appetite anywhere. many people stupid heartless. It’s antivaxxers. can’t imagine need medical care anyone doesn’t directly affect them. split second thought going try bribe people CVS $100. 404 content found comment CDC trying hard save unvaccinated themselves, may take additional steps prevent spread covid, would mean round boosters. personally think that's misguided even counter-productive, I'm guy. Sure... Even breakthrough cases aren’t major concern though. They’re very, rarely going result severe infection, even less likely death.

Vaccination status literally main thing need focus on. Every option less effective vaccine.  trial one person? 1 1 sure 100% effective. care past date, long green rancid smelling I'll take it. *RatinSweet stumbles hospital*

RS: think I'm heart attack.

Nurse: beds right Covid.

RS: That's fault! got vaccinated!

Nurse: Ok still gonna die.  NYC anywhere else now. anything, NYC pretty well vaccinated people wearing masks lot situations still. You’ll fine. told patients, likely going take deaths innocent children hands mislead parents (at point really word) evil politicians change minds many. likely still enough some.  I'm ex pedi/neo transport nurse. is. low case rates 2 months now…

Your message seem like anomaly. guess would hospital system diagnosed 15,000 children adolescents covid - number trending up. 10 percent required hospital admission.

So they're saying 10% whose covid diagnosed hospital require hospitalization. severe cases go hospital testing/diagnosis, milder cases go local Walgreens whatever, would make sense percentage way, way higher. Great news. hope federal government issues mandate soon. Except reading rsv quite contagious quite mild time, pretty much head cold. normally concern. slap hospitals full covid antivax issues, cases rav problem BIG problem. Neither event required vaccination status negative Covid test, unlike Lollapalooza Chicago, much better barometer  Surgical masks intended designed filter incoming outgoing air. intended keep surgical field clean catching large droplets sprayed surgeons talking, sneezing, on. form good seal leak air around sides. cloth masks. 100 year old technology certain uses designed protect wearer. 

N95-style respirators work forming tight seal face thus forcing air breathe pass specially designed filtration element entering respiratory tract, trapping virus-sized particles. want wearing protect others. Anyone sense would feel threatened asshole. everyone knows, vaccines cannot stop us getting infected. However, seems quite logical vaccinated people recovering infection much faster (because already antibodies), therefore spread virus much less time unvaccinated. wonder % could be, know guys studies that? RSV problematic babies 12 months age? something spreading elementary schools. Didnt Chicago one also last week?  Nightclubs England open social distance masks cases still going down. irony Jesus would probably tell get asses vaccinated; problem exists, means overcome available, you? can't willingly shoot foot ask Lord help. That's works. I’m still masking taking precautions, time, don’t think it’s fair compare last year year.

The people largely getting extremely sick dying unvaccinated. choice.

I don’t want cause anyone dying either, longer feel pity people dying anymore. It’s tragic, hate it, terrible choice what’s causing surge never needed come this.

And population spent year isolation, safe, it’s hard hell care people getting sick now, ones never cared. They’re largely ones lived life normally pandemic whole. still are. yet people least risk expected drop everything again.

I’m tired can’t care anymore. care reserved health care workers can’t vaccinated yet (or aren’t protected vaccine due health issues.) Beyond that, I’ll keep masking up, pity well run dry.

As aside, I’m sorry husband. hope you’re taking care yourself. Friendly reminder high body fat percentage high risk factor.

This isn’t shaming kids all. wholly parents. one person says, means nothing. China enough delta cases make conclusive statement. forms exercise burn less 200 calories per hour. Preventing obesity (which caused eating thousands calories BMR healthy weight person height daily) come almost entirely portion size restriction, costs far less gym membership. officials investigating Covid-19 outbreaks tied two recent outdoor music festivals Michigan Oregon, raising new concerns safety events tightly packed crowds, even outside, live music surges back transmissible Delta variant spreads. I'm virologist, personally trust immune system figure proteins target greater degree trust pharmas. I'd prefer attenuated vaccine reason. long history understanding these, everybody takes them.

As aside I'd also prefer injected PEG nanoparticles. preference, idea harmful may be.

Edit: found article, nvm  like vaccine going change then. emergency approval done reason.  Yes becoming clear me. get downvoted months think they'll finally start admitting vaccines near effective thought. think reason outright admitting still want people vaxxed say there's chance holdouts get it. excited school starting back. don’t know do. can’t stay home everyday. babysitter kids they’ll going back school well even risk. prefer staying home, it’s also bad kids isolate much. sucks around. I've trying get nursing school, process makes question really want train new nurses. schools, two-year waiting period start, even get accepted. programs take 40 100 students per term, looking another 4 years. hear schools take degree unrelated field, put fast track program 18 months. nature work actually require in-person presence (like healthcare)? simply enjoy sting master's whip ass? mean yeah…and sane people know that. “they brought upon themselves” comments piss off.

Social Worker here. -we also don’t sick leave, Florida take hands-on approach get shut up. asshole.

October. remain understaffed. We’ve like since December. offer bonuses come in, everyone burnt out.

The last time Covid floor. (18 weeks pregnant mind you.) four patients. One patient family complete assholes me. couldn’t visitors time. would call. patient demanded someone her. Unrealistic three patients. patient refusing bipap (meaning oxygen exchange shit.) wanna full code. Family kept calling nonstop desk (my mom called 20 mins ago!!!) clustered care much could. point family rude diminishing skills. “She must new inexperienced.” I’m going cater rude ass mom I’m stuck basically garbage bags hours dripping sweat. would rather spend time patients actually appreciate me. wanted quit. fact almost threw towel shift. 10 years nursing. also first wave nobody knew expect pregnancy Covid. I’m walking around eggshells trying make sure IM gonna ok. 

With covid, lack visitors, inability breathe, patients scared anxious. want someone hold hand feel alone. again. Staff stretched thin. patients issues acute. covid waves, get many codes. Compared dont. take bipap oxygen die. every time someone needs go make sure equipment on. Poor oxygenation status = confusion = “I don’t want uncomfortable mask face.” = “let’s take thing giving oxygen brain.” Talk governor… skip vax religious reasons problem. Assign permanent paperwork duties something. direct patient contact. forgot one additional point. Provincetown beach town mostly, weekend shitty weekend everyone headed indoors whereas nice sunny weekend, would likely stayed outside limited spread spread out. hear Mr. Anderson?... sound inevitability. nobody wants admit, vaccine giving everyone security theater. par course american governments

but hey i've got triple protection cousins 3rd world countries still waiting first dose According CDC report, 2020 Sturgis rally, one person died 460,000+ COVID-19 fewer 300 total cases. Australia literally buy enough vaccine everyone thats keep going lockdown. damn boy point went sailing dumbass head  Like said time last year.

Heroes get paid, usually sacrifice. grim stories sacrifice life. FAA mandate it... everyone Ah right, thanks clarification event. Regardless, good look. LOL no, f'd pretty good last drug failed phase 3 trials. here, seems completely illogical Yes. antibodies aren’t aspect immune systems still saves lives brings hospitalizations  Thank you!!! Vaccines always touted way out. amount gas lighting never said ridiculous. People real world remember vaccines touted way even people pretend never happened.  Ughhhhhh many streaming services already . last thing need . I'm nutter...just think interesting scientific pov. 
 One thing makes suspicious would explain old age home death decline vaccine. message would made sense 6 months ago makes sense. None said legally possible realistic. see Dr. going back hyperbole now...  80's kid, I'm waiting Delta Delta Delta. Rule #3 reddit ""Thou shalt speak ill CNN, MSNBC, NPR. Thou shalt speak ill Faux Noose"" Yep, we're going keep seeing variants could better everyone vaxxed. one person died 460,000+ COVID-19 2020 Sturgis motorcycle rally fewer 300 cases total. (the vaccinated) still carry spread it, hell vaccine for? would multiply mutate never go away even 100% vaccinated. sounds like describing treatment, rather vaccine.  We're going take masks point. Maybe immediately Delta, *somewhere* along line.

Because, let's face it: *mask mandates good long-term solution.*  Yes, prioritized California 6 months ago. gotten vaccine choice.
They cannot work get vaccine end September. could vaccinated, one this.

Unfortunately people still this. guess missed point vaxxed still transmit virus.

That's Good(TM) thought everybody saying NYC vaccinated couldn’t happen? would sympathy freely available highly effective vaccine anecdotal evidence, live unvaccinated state (AL), things weren’t great mask mandate- would often keep running tally went stores would 25-35% STILL didn’t wear mask- still much, much better. Since mandates lifted I’ve stopped count it’s 85-90% people unmasked.

So personally believe makes huge difference. numbers least seem back up.   rapture taking home you’re great! responsible protecting around literally need. Lol thing thinks theyre talking antimasker

Also thing apparently pro-mask home, says pro-mask anti-vax, also vaccine.

It really can't make mind. covid-19 hospitalizations Florida surged past 12,000 week — far exceeding record already shattered weekend — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) fed spreading misinformation vaccines refusing take protective measures. DeSantis instead railed reporters creating “hysteria” rising hospitalizations accused President Biden facilitating virus reducing immigration southern epicenter summer coronavirus spike fueled highly transmissible delta variant, reporting fifth new U.S. infections current hospitalizations. New cases admissions surpassed last summer’s Sun Belt surge. Florida center stage dangerous phase pandemic new strain spreads rapidly fully reopened society, attacking young middle-aged adults filling hospital beds faster ever. Could someone explain vaccinated people, despite getting infected spreading virus, contribute making variants unvaccinated people will? seems CDC suggesting make sense me. light rapture No. vaccines work fine. 

Chicken pox vaccine like cold either. would Covid different? 

You understand vaccines actually work. Lul  biggest thing masks kids wear work, cloth masks absolute trash blocking virus, majority kids wear. Plus masks get moist need switch effectiveness. kids underlying conditions virus rarely causes issues, know one cases, can't ask world stop one off. 

All parents get vaccinated add layer protection around kids, that's first foremost. Yes breakthrough cases still rare, I'm sold masks making difference kids all. Especially toddler, they're touchy little regards ""germs"". mask mandate vaccine mandate. Worst worlds. think asking good question personally think solution ""getting back normal

I stating solution point pandemic question needs asked. also need prepare shift view seriousness contracting Covid era vaccinations. shift endemic disease seems inevitable point. clear current vaccination rates point saying ""fuck it"" need careful make sure makes sense retread ideas control pre-vaccine era/early months era. 

Personally think lean harder vaccine mandates rather masking, point mere band-aid long term solution. say band-aid temporary use. absolutely was. mask mandates restrictions first came spring 2020, governors/mayors publications cited phased returns normal vaccines trigger ""back normal"" final phase. was. Many governors across country would say something like:

""Until widely available vaccines this!""

Plenty media articles also said something effect too. shocked many people pretending remember sub now. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article correct. entire population dosed would still Delta floating around, hospitals crumbling pressure far fewer people would seriously ill dying. would still happening small fraction we're seeing today.

Yup fire nurses don’t want vaccine make everything worse Travel nurses hospital getting 5k WEEK. CEO douchebag offering 5k retention current RNs stay given sign year contract stay. Fuck healthcare system. Looking another gig aren't. vaccinated even harder get test. number breakthroughs likely WAY higher CDC numbers indicate. running noticeable fever, certainly would dismissed allergies (I never get fevers allergies). It’s true. Places like California offering travel nurses $10,000 week. I've worked contractor hated it. Employers play games paying time tax structure horrendous. said delta variant highly contagious. mean virus contagion rate among vaccinated population non-vaccinated one.  Wow. That’s nuts. 
I know lady claims around vaccinated people makes dizzy.
But noooo, couldn’t possibly anxiety. simple. want anything all. Whatever argument results anything one use.
 
Anybody suggests need take action something clearly overreacting mind.
 
These people refuse evacuate told to. Sad people themselves. It’s remarkable everything Australia able considering it’s democracy. thought would basic democratic laws. Sadly, education without critical thinking worth much. Maybe aced every test every scholarship, experience without particularly smart, to
prepare correctly asked. yeah, maybe rich, good life, ultimately lost everything capable understand real world. mean alternative getting bad care overworked hospital employees, possibly side covid going building full contagious people..

The idea end BETTER started out, worse that’s pretty quick about-face comparing Covid related mandates slavery. Let people choose path, stop trying give government authority didn’t even feel needle all, either time. use super tiny ones, seems. 

Got flu shot arm, definitely felt one going in. someone taught person year last year masks, tell zero campus tranismisison k-12 school. work elementary kids good wearing masks. bad. worst part podding schedule changes. Bad made school life hard different, best could kids. masking hard keep kids. I'm aware delta may much transmissable ability keep covid may predictive future, quite hopeful. hopeful. think masking PLUS madatory daily reporting symptoms important. whole swiss cheese method thing. Prevention mitigation, perfection. Kids need school. is/was vulnerable group would vaccinated Pfizer January. reassuring, think need booster shot. vast majority never actually looked paystub life. realize $100/month health insurance premium actually $600/month, employer subsidizing rest behalf. think helping attenuated sense smell. US already paying twice much industrialized country per person healthcare, $11,000 person versus $5000 person Europe Canada.

This extra money going health care workers doctors. getting siphoned people provide health care all.  commonplace working world though.

It RARE ever really appreciated work for. Pretty sure work company. lab outreach even around get that, lol. choke point lab tests (including Covid obv.) go 50 practices day. got told boss two people's jobs big deal they're short staffed. 

Heard slew management outpatient facilities quit yesterday. Wonder even registered people run shit. stealthy *not chocolate.* callous enough teachers dedicated remote learning budget it. NYC already use ""stockroom"" fill person classrooms example teachers (including me) want hybrid (it effectively turns remote learning). science teachers especially hated since labs.

Unless come dozens teachers take little money, remote options coming back lot places. unvaccinated adults idiotic holding views. Plain simple. dragging rest us responsible adults back new lockdown. Misinformation need feel “against system” new virus.  FREE-DUM! Didn’t know subsidized cruise ships everyone cruise went looked liked chomping bit spend tax refund checks pina coladas swim bar full urine. fuck antivax crap yammering about? vaccine also protects them, won’t get sick, won’t infect anybody. I'm motherfucking done. go Texas five times current pay. southern state. Y'all yourselves, sorry. mean, HRs taught pizza party heals wounds, right? Wait, work? population higher, they'd suddenly personally know someone got covid people around? seems like one statements seems reasonable think perplexing becomes. Medical workers burnt out. dad RN, 67 years old considered at-risk. telling yesterday people come COVID refuse actually get tested asks first time. literally care want know walking biohazard. usually able persuade letting know best interested disease potentially kill 67 year old nurse helping surgical mask protection. Even then, ask toxic chemicals nose swabs use. 

It's completely ridiculous. easy get burnt patients refuse treatment every step way reason. kinda tism, call patriots. pretty good consolidating problems one. Yeah that's true. guess thinking worth talking idea vaccine supply chain looks like. 

But whenever tell need booster, I'm ready.  [insert abeRidingBear.jpg] [""FREEEDOMMM""]

Having religion tied laws rights creates huge grey area cannot legally commit murder (even though book might say to) legally deny epidemic-ending shot (even interpretation scripture). sorts stupid. Bingo. It’s anti-Vaccine crew aren’t capable critical thinking, things need carefully spelled them.  lot fat kids areas low vaccination rates tend also fat kids know obesity one risk factors.  No. even flying right now. never crossed mind haha! Britain proof vaccines work. We've dropped mask mandates cases going *down*. made go ""Wtf"".

Then remembered Ted Cruz like ""yeah makes sense."" interesting idea, would know? unvaccinated missed time, what's stopping ""damn yeah sick flu, definitely COVID""?

I guess could come whole regimen submitting test results verify. Seems like would work employer rote requirement get vaccinated.  true, sure. looks way though. nothing else also looks safe do. several countries say least. Literally worst people America offer. Nurse here. pretty much sums up. expectation stage, seen ""vaccines ticket back normal"" sputter crash, very, long future cyclical returns masking ahead us.

I really, really want right. consider side science data, thought forced wear masks years irritates me.

It common knowledge virus going endemic, cases going till end time, we're rather foolish believe still eradicate it. doubt forced periodical masking even precedent prior pandemic. Love it. hope encourage everyone get vaccinated. course lol Yes, grim reaper one way tickets shuttle unvaccinated. Meanwhile Florida well passed month cases/hospitalizations/deaths keep ticking.

It’s much virus ripping wants, equilibrium virus public right thing reduce transmission.  ton nurses Philippines California. initial contract period up, pro-union. loyal contract (or whatever terms get visa/green card/citizenship). They’re amazing nurses part unions California. 

Hospital admin takes advantage us there’s nothing grinds gears more! would made shortages much worse. still needed people working actually produce things buy.  Yup It’s nothing like chicken pox parties.

Things beginning crumble healthcare industry couple notes: 


\-You seem concerned Covid spreading students members family community. something factor equation? 


\-You, like people particular bias, demonize remote learning. Why? SAFER option health safety community, put emphasis it? Rather demonize it, maybe find solutions funding IMPROVING it?? fact fail mention reveals sort strange bias have.  


Obviously, remote learning took place last minute, without training proper organization, many factors limiting effectiveness (misinformation, lack funding education, stress anxiety void, lack training, etc). simply say ""it's bad"" seems incredibly misleading shortsighted. I’m last semester nursing school it’s unreal stressful without even worked full-time nurse. personal, non medical opinion, go every year i'd wait months go check ups occasionally, might well one delayed longer ha. i’m sure went well. scalpers pivoted selling tickets fake covid test results vax cards. fear needle prevention you’re going really pissed IV’s treatment. mom nurse decade tells this. Apparently nurses get sign bonuses $30k+ referral bonuses $3k. many nurses hospital stiffed regular wage increases past years. Texas hospitals coming long time. They've also cutting hours leaving staff home call staff need use PTO make ends meet never get proper vacations. hospitals Texas hellholes even covid. Holy shit, that's unsafe. interesting question long term, think probably find answer seeing lawsuits employers require MMR, chicken pox, childhood vaccines basically, what's currently ongoing South? real option reduce spread vaccination. teach teenagers get vaccinated. Anything delays spread, eligible vaccinated going do? Honest question end game clear here. US, standard line right universal health care say want pay peoples healthcare.

The original irony here, course, exactly private insurance is. hate government healthcare, they're subsidizing people less healthy tax dollars. problem private insurance, despite fact they're subsidizing people less healthy premiums. difference private insurance costs pay salaries bonuses upper managers top actual, know, health-related costs. Jesus that's nightmare. that, ICU nurses particular really demand short supply. specialty sure takes years perfect. I've floor nurse years, switched icu 8 months ago, 4 month orientation still barely feel competent ICU. complex theres much learn...and icu nurses burning like crazy. know ""missed"" majority pandemic, starting come back nurses unit ptsd like episodes. spent entire shift day COVID rooms exhausted - mentally physically...and one shift, 2 patients. burnout real issue - can't take another round this, PLEASEEEE get vaccines! patient's seen (in icu many others saying thing) far icu last several months unvaccinated ones. Obviously louder say something, true gets. believe individual control. make active decision get vaccine there’s unintended consequence, it’s fault. Catch virus community spread ‘was meant be’ ‘act God’ wash hands blame. Seems pride control issue. common definition i've heard ""standard care"" drops. words expect receive hospital get. like people NYC waited hours ambulances wave covid. 

i wish news agencies use sensational language, would instead put terms understand. hospital designed 500 patients 750 average nurse cared 3 patients caring 4 admission criteria used xyz abc, etc ""well lost customer!"" Lol still summer...wait winter informative! Thank you! think medicinal world still realizing much menstrual cycles affect women's health incredibly frustrating. same, thanks links info something government control…..like uterus. modern American dream defer responsibility covid shined light issue. know sure target paying hazard pay gave raises sister working them. heard others offering it. I’m saying many travel nurses staff nurses took advantage high rates overtime incentives make money pandemic slowed months ago decided take long breaks like 3 months etc. general prior pandemic nursing shortage relocation sign bonuses offered originally worsened pandemic many nurses deciding change specialties especially highly specialized nurses like ICU quitting althogether choosing work overtime anymore. It’s culture problem. Nurses educated specialized experience really counts still really labor force treated valued hospitals. Hopefully start see change culture hospitals start realize power. Even non-N95/KN95/KF94 masks, get level protection wearer. enough prevent infection room high concentration viral particles. perhaps enough fleeting contact you’re vaccinated. think truth hospital administrator's interest come say, ""A bunch people dying enough resources take care them."" 

Dr. Catherine O'Neal CMO Lady “When come inside walls, quite obvious darkest days pandemic. **We longer giving adequate care patients.** also stopped. heard physicians **we longer think we’re giving adequate care anybody,** darkest days pandemic.” 

That press conference August 2nd. There’s ton behavioral cognitive research says humans don’t make emotionless decisions. Emotion plays role decision making. get mean even disagree. mess Texas !! hear you. said probably. know every overweight person Virginia conservative. it’s likely are. sisonke website (and thanks way aware study) : Consistently finding 94% breakthrough infections mild, 4% moderate 2% severe.

from boston globe : study, known Sisonke, provides first large-scale evidence J&amp;J vaccine works dominant variant, according trial co-lead Glenda Gray. It’s probably protective delta earlier beta strain, said presentation Friday. single-dose shot 71 percent effective hospitalization much 96 percent effective death, said. 

i'd say pretty damn good self-administer medication via injections months get syringes. I'm glad finally managed get several months worth supplies became available recently - things looking great going forward :/  another year rate vaccinate everyone. source info Germany? first I'm hearing it, J&amp;J would interested mRNA booster autumn. Maybe real friends people got vaxxed along way What's vaccine rate? 50% fully vaxxed? Could add pool improve numbers slightly guess? Still lot spare capacity virus though. Vaccine trials take long need. Last thing want rare side effect ends worse covid (because small kids seem quite resistant far). course Delta future strains may change state things, would much rather data-driven decision, rather political histery-driven one. feel like that’s reference something…  can, say go it. I’ve known new nurses broke contracts we’re glad did. one friend miserable, actually point developed addiction pain meds. going rehab, works outpatient loves it. Since vaccination rates critical thing, OK attitude. ball firmly court unvaxxed. Covid vaccine hesitancy research made reevaluate position flu shots. I’m getting first flu shot decades year. break cognitive dissonance. didn’t feel comfortable taking pro vaccine stance covid anti vaccine flu realized position silly mostly based peer influences rather science. changed. people too, will. b) evidence showing vastly misreported Covid numbers.

Is though? fairly plausible cases deaths may intentionally undercounted beginning outbreak Wuhan, also makes sense government willing shut nearly normal transport business activity weeks end, track everyone's movement, seal residents homes able quickly curb domestic transmission fairly quickly. also extremely high degree individual compliance health directives.  Yeah, doctors nurses spoken dread using ""regular"" triage tools like ""this person sick survive intubation"" much dread, eg, tell people triaging BMI husband overweight get ventilator. Looking basically healthy 40 year old would almost certainly recover care telling them, ""the rules tell send home die, security make sure get back car"" - that's going shatter people later on. least triaging likelihood survival something point ""you're stupid fuck-up, need lie bed unhelped wait death"". 

I'm vaccinated, entire family close friends vaccinated, everyone around takes seriously. would benefit ""no care unvaccinated"" think terrible idea. Save money, get N R rated disks. P rated disks use environment oil droplets. P indefinite use environment oil, R 8 hours environment oil, N can't used environment oil.

The number actually important letter rating. 100 99.7% 0.3 micron particles, numbers actual percentage 0.3 micron particles blocked.

The whole reason letter rating electrostatic charge masks negated oil unless specially made. electrostatic charge negated, filters protect far less. Texas. could still infected transmit someone else even I'm asymptomatic.

And get breakthrough case severe enough require treatment, even yes, lot less likely die - *and* sort health emergency? definitely going care hospitals full then.

I basically right back masking, going big gatherings, etc. fact, went large indoor gathering since early 2020.

I think lot people *did* treat pandemic like real thing, wore masks, etc., denial COVID endemic, stay, hate say, think they're going get rude awakening pretty soon, either Delta, next, even exotic variant. think large percentage Sturgis rally demographic vaccinated? swear, statements like this, people everything make vaccinations seem unnecessary makes sense - bit trickier widely college prices vary states, argument pay rich kids go college _at all_ agree, absolutely people deliberately excluding rich universal services oppose it.

On hand argument pay obscene amount Harvard charging it, agree. Maybe free tuition anyone limit would make sense. Wondering- people get infected COVID? Anyone know? friends medical field- still vaccinated. Others living lives normal NYC past year - masks, never caught it.    wondering thoughts Moderna pfizer Antibodies immune systems weapon. important T-cells, soldiers fighting actual infection.

The Delta variant also evade antibodies, yet vaccins remain effective.

Or article says: ""It’s yet known whether lambda variant infectious Delta variant, many places world, including United States, dominant variant"" won't, sadly... is. Full stop. 

99% US population 12 older eligible vaccine. gotten problem. Genuinely burst laughing hahaha, free award pile horse goop  America dumbest country world. Oh come on, I'm fat guy Missouri, following stereotype conservative anti-vaxxer too, I'm extremely liberal fully vaccinated since March.

According dispatch No.18, signed Chairman Chu Ngọc Anh, 14 days heavy restrictions line Government’s Directive 16 began 6am Saturday, July 24 set expire 6am Saturday, August 7, city attained “certain results”, Anh said. 
However, outbreak city well across country remains “unpredictable complicated,” many infections found community without clear sources numerous cases displaying symptoms, added.
The capital city logged 1,800 cases fourth wave infections starting late April, half found lockdown period 60-70 cases new cases registered each day.

During press briefing held day, health official said health sector take advantage lockdown period ‘filter’ hidden COVID-19 cases community.
Under social distancing order, non-essential businesses continue remain closed, people allowed go outside except essential purposes like buying food medical emergencies. Public transport also remains halted.

The dispatch noted many members public organisations/companies strictly abided social distancing rules crowding still occurred from time time markets streets. presence highly-transmissible Delta variant threatens shatter city’s COVID-19 prevention control efforts, said.

The city leader asked for absolute compliance social distancing orders, separating household household individual individual.

Companies, businesses agencies city continue arrange employees work home go work truly necessary cases members armed forces people handling confidential documents monitoring company and/or local authorities.

The chairman noted success COVID-19 fight, “robust involvement” administration, predicated self-discipline compliance support people society obeying social distancing rules.

For green zones (COVID-19 free areas), residents remain proactive complacent preventing disease, stand ready respond emerging incidents.
For orange zones – high-risk areas like factories, workplaces, markets, hospitals medical facilities – unit must prevention control plan ready local authorities inspect permit operate units satisfy COVID-19 safety criteria.
For red zones blockaded/quarantined areas, local authorities decide impose stronger measures make sure spread virus occur inside zones contain outbreak soon possible.

Testing treatment

The city leader also asked stock taken city’s testing capacity, well mobilisation capable units help expand testing capacity.

Health agencies local authorities tasked taking initiative conducting rapid antigen testing based assessment outbreaks clusters, act fast flexibly avoid missing virus carriers, start offer guidance public take samples supervision healthcare workers.

The health authorities also asked prepare maximum capacity scenarios – regards treatment COVID-19 patients, especially ensuring enough oxygen, ventilators beds.

Healthcare centres told classify asymptomatic symptomatic patients sort appropriate treatment units.
Suitable apartment buildings, educational institutions, construction projects could requisitioned repurposed act treatment facilities asymptomatic patients (30,000 beds 50,000 beds necessary).

Anh also asked quicker vaccinations safe manner, providing sufficient instructions people vaccine appointments.
Local authorities relevant sectors must plans arrangements place avoid disruptions supply of goods city, market instability, shortages hoarding ensure safe circulation supply food essentials people, especially blockaded areas, guaranteeing one left wanting.

Trần Thị Phương Lan, Acting Director Hà Nội’s Department Industry Trade, said department told distribution chains stock three times normal amount goods (up VNĐ194,000 billion in value).

Lan said given markets supermarkets closed due COVID-19 infections, mobile units set provide essential products local residents. — VNS someone PLEASE think CEOs :(

Normally, would threat lawsuits avoidance possible health safety violations, expensive I'm sure there's many examples, gives general idea: results show expired N95 masks sterilized N95 masks provided level protection new N95 masks greater 95 percent filtration. alternatives provided less protection. example, surgical masks ties provided 71.5 percent filtration, surgical masks ear loops provided 38.1 percent.*

Last thing want car crash, end hospital, nurse gives covid… would require remorse part thing annoying point trying make important hard make. experts clearly communicated idea.

Basically, live people vaccinated vaccine might less effective, careful. Wear mask protects (*not* cotton), avoid indoor dining large events, etc. 

Serial vaccinated-to-vaccinated spread still believed rare, living high risk people, able continue live want, vaccinated.

I think people capable understanding message. Classic tension conveying factual information getting clicks. CDC media totally fucking messaging Pretty much. Hospitalizations also super low. able hide deaths, hospitalizations, case rates... data. 

Technically anecdotes part data. However insignificant may be, still data points. old you? (If mind asking) Stop spreading misinformation. read box. refute scientific proof mask usage effectiveness has.

Also: Damn, get Pfizer booster shoulder winter. willfully unvaccinated volunteer though. let happen themselves. Y'all super high vaccination rate. think north east hit like neck woods still nearly enough. Meanwhile, rest world could made sooooo much progress access India made vaccines.

Taking reasonable measures prevent getting people sick important, especially risk groups initially vaccinated. I've spent year wearing mask, social distancing. We're stage countries however propagation said pathogen low-risk prospect majority people vaccinated, distinctly young healthy age groups haven't.

Even circumstance, makes sense would perhaps promote vaccine younger age groups. Although think data warrants societal Governmental pressure said age group receive medical intervention, unless I'm missing something. know caught it? CNN hired. headline put going create huge mess. kid starts school two weeks. fence it, decided reluctantly school district mask requirement [based American Pediatrics recommendation noted feel great it, based current information appears best several bad options. 

If live state mask mandate ban school district without mask mandate kids starting school, everything overturn it. Write letters, protest, organize strikes work schools there. Whatever takes. completely unacceptable ridiculous ban masks cases soaring. I'll take: never passed stats class life know basic math 100$ Alex. Get good masks lessen viral load Fear-mongering nonsense. I'm retail manager. I've interviewed many nurses last year need job can't nursing thing anymore. They're taking 50,000+ dollar paycuts.  Fine, I'll Google 469 people infected. 5 hospitalized... FOUR FIVE fully vaccinated. Meaning 80% people requiring medical assistance vaccinated.

I say again. majority people get Covid need hospital regardless vaccinated not. saying, ""many people get vaccinated need hospital"" stupid true regardless vax. I'm familiar, know they're reporting accurately?  children develop complications COVID-19 several weeks first develop symptoms

This first time I've heard this. wonder even better getting previously infected. case getting Pfizer Moderna pretty dumb today they're available. risk die become seriously ill

I mention ""or become seriously ill"" part that.  death toll low, seriously-ill count something I'd like see substantiated summarily dismissed. UBC, alas, though least profs open windows. We’re concerned, faculty concerned, staff concerned. Provincial government doesn’t care. apologize, reading summary report linked first paragraph talking mRNA efficacy. second paragraph linked study UK. study (as far tell) doesn’t list vaccines, subjects vaccinated. 
The 59% would applicable vaccines used UK. enjoyed massive rebound thanks efforts 'protect' children covid

So let's understand logic here:

Masks - prevented kids getting COVID, also RSV last 18 months - blame fact RSV cases going kids wearing masks?

So beef masks boils effectiveness stopping airborne diseases. Right? actually care many kids actually get RSV, think kids gotten December 2020 vs. today. Right?

The Food Drug Administration expects strategy Covid-19 vaccine boosters early September would lay vaccinated individuals get follow-up shots, according people familiar discussions within agency.

The Biden administration pushing swift release booster strategy populations—people age 65 older people immunocompromised, well got shots December January shortly rolled out—could need boosters soon month, two people said.

Any booster strategy U.S. government need address declining protection certain people time vaccines remain short supply developing world.

About half country fully vaccinated, 165 million people, federal data show.

Research shows authorized vaccines offer effective protection symptomatic Covid-19 least six months. protection diminishes time, leading public-health experts vaccine makers believe boosters necessary maintain protection. growing body evidence suggests vaccines less effective among people weakened immune systems among general population.

Recent data Pfizer Inc. BioNTech SE shows efficacy shot declines 6% every two months, suggests boosters may needed broadly, one people said.

Pfizer plans ask U.S. regulators month authorize booster shots two-dose vaccine, arguing third shot may needed protect evolving virus.

Moderna Inc. said Thursday expects people received two-dose vaccine need third shot fall keep strong protection newer variants coronavirus. Moderna Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel said company expects ask FDA authorize booster shots September.

Some countries, including Israel, authorized booster shots immunocompromised patients older adults. physicians immunologists U.S. say isn’t clear yet whether needed general population.

A small growing number vaccinated people testing positive Covid-19, almost none dying requiring hospitalization. Scientists say vaccines working, part boosting ability immune system cells hunt destroy infected cells. 

The U.S. enough supply boosters needed general population, White House facing pressure internationally donate doses rather start booster campaign domestically. World Health Organization Wednesday called halt boosters least end September, citing urgent need vaccinate rest world. 

A White House spokesman didn’t immediately respond request comment. 

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said Thursday important provide boosters immunocompromised people.

The White House concerned people decide get boosters own, creating confusion combinations shots haven’t studied, one people said.

The Advisory Committee Immunization Practices, advises U.S. government vaccines, expressed preliminary support recommendation immunocompromised people receive boosters can’t formally vote matter federal regulators grant shots full approval amend emergency authorization rules.

Dr. Camille Kotton, transplant specialist Massachusetts General Hospital member committee, said concerned immunocompromised patients “taken matters hands” trying get boosters without formal guidance committee, adding fears people lack financial resources easy access medical care could left unable get shots.

The White House’s concern heightened San Francisco Department Public Health Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Trauma Center said would offer booster doses Pfizer Moderna shots people received Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose shot, person said.

FDA officials trying determine whether booster shot could create type lasting immunity resulting common childhood immunizations, one people said. four-dose poliovirus vaccine series, example, results lifelong immunity.

Agency leaders also grappling question whether booster shots would given prevent moderate severe disease, prevent symptomatic disease reduce transmission, person said. Large late-stage clinical trials demonstrated vaccines’ effectiveness symptomatic disease weren’t designed evaluate whether reduced transmission. Vaccine makers still investigating issue.

Pfizer Moderna studying effectiveness booster shots, including tweaked versions shots tailored specific variants. Government researchers studying mixing matching different vaccines.

The FDA analyzing Covid-19 data seniors long-term-care facilities, one people familiar agency’s discussions said. agency also wants sure boosters don’t increase risk heart problems affected small number people following initial vaccination, one people said.

Boosters may also necessary spread highly transmissible Delta variant virus raising risk additional, potentially dangerous variants might show up, well contributing rapid increase cases. projections suggest U.S. could see cases October month last year.

“We’re going make decision booster shots based compilation evidence,” Rochelle Walensky, director Centers Disease Control Prevention, said Thursday. Well, one kids hospital well.

True, within general public repubs antivax dems pro. many GOP elected politicians actively fighting masks vaccines? think governors 20x congressmen top head. many dems fighting vaccines masks? Thats pretty telling. Ugh, is... disturbing. Poor kids :(. Save Children

It’ll def peaked within month so. It’s infectious, burn fast long. similar what's happened UK think 40% vaccinated people hospital here. happening we've vaccinated 95% vulnerable groups. many unvaccinated people left still susceptible hospitalised worrying seems.

Mississippi population 2019: 2.97 million

Florida population 2019: 21.48 million

Mississippi covid cases today: 3,164

Florida covid cases today: 20,133

That's equivalent 22,883 cases population Florida. people positions power Florida held criminally negligent.   study linked time period Delta variant came about. Try again.  ""trust"" vaccine wacko conspiracy theorists posting anti-vax propaganda. military can't allow propaganda misinformation impact readiness.

COVID significant impacts (USA) military readiness, including Nuclear Aircraft Carrier combat ready 2 months due major outbreak. usually advertise impacts, USS Theodore Roosevelt incident hidden. Rest assured, many units impacted. 

For better worse, military always used ""carrot stick"" approach implementing policy. Well, ""rum lash"" old navy. Without ""stick"", anyone decides good time leave simply refuse vaccine honorably discharged. need policy balances risks total force readiness, illness personnel losses.  yeah better fucking be. second shot horrible share hobby, deal. Unless never nudes cause dozens us We're crisis, situation historically executive branch gets extraordinary amount power. Act first, debate constitutionality later. Seriously, mandates vaccines makes restrictions, 4 months later Supreme Court overturns it, consequence? We'll gotten 4 months control situation. stopped tolerating long ago personal level. I'm sure long society tolerate it. “Always been…”. :( tell? people eligible, I've heard stupid conspiracy theories taking them. I'm doctor scientist work kids. cannot help wonder let virus circulate around schools, school mask mandates, get least kids vaccinated....could covid evolve ""kid-friendly"" version? Like something different bodies, virus mutate figure work/spread efficiently bodies? big fear mine going new school year.


Also know impacts long covid little ones. end entire generation kids heart, lung, and/or cognitive issues? Isn’t nice hear truth, leader, this?

Sure I’d rather news it’s almost over—but truth significantly better. multiple hospitals go diversion, they’re forced it.

Hence aforementioned joke: “when everyone’s divert, *no one’s divert*” Anyone got vaccine got virus after? Particularly within like 4 months? Yeah it’s strange way covid patients prioritized. medical professional perhaps provide insight? Idaho ever really comply COVID restrictions?

I drove western Idaho Lewiston Spokane via Coeur d'Alene last October. people saw besides wearing masks a) college students elderly people Moscow near U campus b) two people (out many parking lot) walking grocery store Post Falls big sign saying Kootenai County required masks indoors. Nobody wearing masks going restrooms rest stop US-95. guy gave food drive-through restaurant wearing mask.

On trip, also drove parts rural southeastern Washington (Walla Walla Clarkston). area culturally, politically, economically similar Idaho, people *did* wear masks grocery stores gas stations state required it. would caution extrapolating Idaho. Pimp slapped free market. overly strong immune response. Similar people get fever second shot last sentence exactly said. started pushing boosters determining long current vaccines would effective. doctors saying people mRNA vaccines may protected years board members worrying kind study - saying booster needed. statements traditionally made board meetings members, researchers scientists.

Again, stated step (which apparently can't read) - waiting studies independent pharmaceutical companies say booster needed know getting one health reasons, line investors pockets.  Police many counties refused even enforce mandates last year, without Abbott's express blessing, see 'renegade' mandates helping. Texas Florida cage match title leper colony status know correlate vaccine dose, even did, even know antibody titers correlate immunity COVID, due immune mechanisms like T-cell immunity. took like week cave evictions. need rally.  possibly exercise infected? I've heard others really fit people get really sick earlier, suspect exhausting unaware infection   get better better coverage boosters targeted specifically troublesome variants. enough stop spread mutations long enough vaccine work deal consequences. done first place vaccine would exactly said was. People can't blame vaccine working alpha politicians idiots letting delta get control fully vaccinating population vaccine made delta. Honestly fantastic achievement works well does. phased rollout based age clinical vulnerability. 20-somethings got called first jabs June, they're requiring 8-week gap doses, majority young people eligible second dose date. pretty sure UK people generally healthier Floridians. 

It factor… going daily life kids right now? friends got newborn mom didn’t want stop breastfeeding really didn’t anyone could watch baby week so. Amazingly baby never developed much sniffle even though cared two Covid positive parents. don’t know baby got didn’t get tested. go downhill very, quickly understand.

I understand agenda get people vaccinated (and it’s noble; I’m vaccinated want everyone vaccinated doesn’t true medical reason) don’t misleading people. breeds mistrust.

That ‘theoretical maximum’ get worse assumption. CDC director straight told us latest estimates last week asked vaccinated start wearing masks indoors transmission high. 7 fold reduction noticeable illness 20 fold reduction serious illness/death. That’s best estimate find, though worded way people understood it.

That’s roughly 85% efficacy, that’s inline varying data countries. Breakthrough rare. Serious illness death still far know. It’s disingenuous misrepresent numbers, even good cause. lucky, felt like dumpster 36 hours second dose Moderna vaccine.  person deleted response me? probably deleted post. say, thinking it, advice really excellent wish could see again.

It sucks risk long-covid still possible fully vaccinated people though. need there, they're screaming yelling covid real kills them. would want treat patient spits face like (metaphorically literally). nurses battle century pandemic also put bullshit hospital admins insane patients frothing mouth. idk much someone would pay but, whatever is, doubt compensation remotely adequate. Hahaha fail realize nurses technical staff well compensated hospitals California already strong union here. also much less outbreak per capita extreme nursing shortages south. state big it’s like it’s easy get move another state here. felt like shopping hellmart work today. Ok efficacy *one* shot published (or even researched properly)? stats I've seen indicate close efficacy two. High 80's vs low 90's Pfizer Moderna. former actually mislead initial study paper measuring efficacy first shot 7 days, whereas 14 almost good two shots... starting soon month. California schools starts August. Natural immunity works like vaccine immunity. antibody protection infection wanes time resilience serious disease remains. 

People understand basic virology. Antibodies protect infection different part immune response t-cells protect virulence. Antibodies wane, t-cells not.

The one advantage vaccination one continue take booster shots increase antibody immunity, one can't natural immunity.

Can't imagine actually LIVING FL =/ Thanks including ots pts. pricing fair just. get Care Bear.  
All right world. Vaccines work they're arms!&lt; wonder many 2.7M already infected point.

Officially we’ve 500K cases think CDC estimates 3-4x real number. Obviously overlap exists previously infected people vaccinated people. Maybe become could mild ur symptom? it’s prior Delta, gives fuck data? Delta accounts 93% cases US growing. original efficacy statistically insignificant difference (95% confidence interval overlapped, Moderna 89.3-96.8, Pfizer 90.3-97.6) full dosage, Moderna's first shot efficacy significantly higher. 

It's interesting 6month+ efficacy also turning higher Moderna. following news 

Sources:  

* Pfizer BioNTech confidence interval   
* Moderna confidence interval ""mild"" covid still preferable living masks distancing forever? that's true. Ideally we'd high rates immunity around time local level.l could limit exposure people places they're still largely unvaccinated/unexposed get caught up. We've got travel bans helping, Delta got easily enough far many places US vaccine available accessible can't even get half population vaccinated.  

I'm damn impressed quickly we've gotten vaccines people, unless people willing get limit exposure cases still high wonder it'll enough. major aspect problem Republicans oppose universal healthcare also Democrats. Admittedly exactly leftists centrist. members congress actually support universal healthcare unlikely pass time soon. matter Democrats nearly supermajority. sad thing is...it's snowball effect disease deaths caused inability obtain treatment.

So asshole never got vaccine kills maybe someone needs surgery

It's exponential growth plenty firewood region... writing wall. pull umbilical straps.

My momma didn’t even cut mine. cut myself, slapped ass, immediately started filling job applications. yes, obvious highly vaccinated population can't stop transmission. 

It *always* obvious transmission can't stopped 100%. fact vaccines stop transmission provably false. studies Delta variant confirm vaccinated people significantly less likely unvaxxed contribute spread. gave vaccine record ever there. went got re-vaccinated. I’m debating get full series stop single booster shot.

Does anyone know need show two vaccine doses show vaccinated? That's different natural immunity protected you, good. However getting vaccine gives infected chance protect around them. ""..infection fatality ratio, percentage deaths infections, 0.5% 1%"" - WHO. sounds low, far US we're 615k deaths. numbers mean anything loved one dead.

I feel natural immunity mentioned best way minimize exposure growth mutant variants focus vaccination. IMO, like saying natural immunity viable course we'll Covid-19 parties, like ones parents expose kids chickenpox best ""it's ok get together immune system strong enough."" isnt point vaccinations. Maybe enough vaccinations Delta Variant would never appeared, speculation.

[fact check Southerner here, seen vaccination numbers? people need behave surge people need behave cases declining. Thanks understanding, appreciate comment. agree, want safe possible. I've even gotten treadmill nurses family saying stay fit possible, get good cardio, etc. friend parrots stupid shit like ""I choice providers anymore"" bullshit everyone would insurance every single doctor would take insurance go business. 

They think parrot shit heard Faux news. good news numbers nowhere go up... least vaccines lose effectiveness require booster considered vaccinated. Seems we're ways away though. hope essential workers also get chance get boosters soon well. mind holding bit want spend months waiting like last time Delta bad is. cannot afford open 'let rip' low vaccination rates. australia vaccination rate around 15%, increases keep seeing short lockdowns, shit alternative letting delta rip lots people dying even eligible vaccine yet  60%  patients prioritized acuity precautionary requirements per ethical regulatory guidelines. means, it’s matter Covid vs cancer, it’s matter prioritizing resources treat sickest, highest mortality risk cohorts, Venn diagram comparing Covid patients circle. curb transmission curbing infection (even leaked cdc slide decks maintain reduce risk infection 3-fold, line UK seeing, lower Canada seeing, line one array things Israel claims seen). indeed seem likely vaccinated person breakthrough case spread well unvaccinated case, fact happening significantly smaller scale continues curb transmission. guess would say we’re “right,” least that’s seems me.

But want add think saying without context irresponsible likely fuel misinformation hesitancy. Socialism? Already people know. Thanks Based fact yesterday, Mississippi 6 ICU beds available entire state, effective. ^ per month till nightmare ends

Shit's gunna get rough next month UI ends even worse cold weather rolls in.

People get desperate without assistance that's bueno. certainly look 44! like 54 - she'll look 64 get this.   arm ready go. Let's it.   Enjoy quarantining every time set foot back school, kids teachers. get it. likely correlate sterilizing immunity. cells useful stopping infection getting worse already taken hold.

At rate, think worth exploring difference. technical level Moderna Pfizer vaccines aren’t different. technology, protein spike. Currently one major substantive differences dosage. seems like obvious place start looking real difference efficacy.  understand tech companies think they'll ever get people back office remote better part 2 years. really need give idea focus make virtual offices effective possible long-term. someone aggressive immune system thought taking third dose terrifies me. first dose Pfizer felt pretty bad. lot stuff describing. take meds want interfere it. second dose Moderna. took max dose ibuprofen whole time still felt like head watermelon many elastic bands around it.  something could done prevent this. I've actively shoved away. I'm disabled vaccine denying basically attack personal safety. never make space life this. # #ThanksDeSatan  Late comers finally see delta’s writing wall. still means 5 6 weeks major spread full vaccination double dosers. Late better never, suppose… sure right message US putting moment.

Literally applicable point entire pandemic. Would able enjoy went, given hesitancy now? ...they stacked like cordwood shipping containers morgues filled overwhelmed capacity burials.

Before difficult human mind get around numbers system kind working.

After total failure system evidence clear.

This fact mass casualty like 9/11 event occuring every day. Excellent news got shots back Dec/Jan/Feb!!! could true I'm speculating potential risk # #ThanksDeSatan Uhh.. sleep first half pandemic? world shut months. came back. shut another month, thing gonna happen. Gotta learn live unfortunately, hope people get vaccinated. Anyone thinks otherwise denial Lmao. say 85% hospitalizations vaccinated people? Try contacting clear rabies. works show symptoms. symptoms start basically doomed.

I otherwise agree, want people wait playing bats something. Rabies terrible. Masks don’t really stop transmission either mask compliance never works. Sooner let virus blow population, better. got mine. Saved photos. Plus Keep bookmarked homescreen case. need experts things, need expert *one* thing.

And one thing failing us, *hard*. totally agree you. need hire PR team keep going like this, seeing vaccination going much except already planning getting vaccinated. booster shot, going disaster especially also say anything them. doesn't? That's weird since directly California Department Public Health. long ago vaccinated? Maybe needs update. [Those mountains, they're [yes risk small really, really suck PR that's sure. carefully craft messages unwashed (or unvaccinated) masses extra ammo willfully ignorant. Carefully crafting messaging important disease control actual scientific part job.

So frustrating much suck. poor messaging used anti vaxxers.  Even transmissiblility COVID infected exactly unvaccinated, less vaccinated people get COVID breakthrough first place unvaccinated, making less likely spread it, less likely begin with. Therefore, COVID vaccines prevent transmissions aggregate.  Sometimes, even know CDC could worse messengers are. Divide public schools vaccinated+masking vs unvaccinated+unmasking. Antivaxx teachers teach antivaxx children, unmasked schools. Alabama population 4,921,532; far, 2,154,479 people received least one dose, 2,767,053 left state administering average 12,200 vaccine doses per day Aug. 1,

Yeah, okay, pull chair, we're gonna ...    thought Israel pretty high vaccination rate? source that? I'd love see it. Seriously.

And people aren’t vaccinated probably won’t persuaded likes CNN.

It’s ridiculous. allowed tech companies like FB everyone curated content walled garden without dissenting opinion.

They probably won’t even see this. messaging that’s generated.

We’re really point society need deal issues face costs inaction.

From politics vaccine. transcends individual problems. disagree. virus unique, going eliminate human race. immune systems gotten us far, that's without advanced medicine. Yes, agree you.

As long still exists somewhere, there’s still risk. I’m sure we’re smallpox victims buried permafrost; iirc [scientists able sequence DNA Spanish Flu samples Right. Thanks reply. Hope everyone mends well. endemic point. signs pointing so. Saying something like ""Vaccines prevent transmission anymore"" WRONG message put though. That's gonna achieve ""high levels vaccination"" US wants citizen. they're planning give boosters?? Good luck they're saying things like this. course mine son's match records file. Thanks post OP. short, it’s unclear long immunity (natural) lasts. However, mRNA may induce longer persistent immune responses infection. Even interesting, mRNA vaccines may induce [greater immune response natural come every time we're trying talk transmission rates, like long dead hospital everything great??? 
I know you, want infected all. want roll dice. buy? make sure tested CDC? gonna get worse climate change. mean obviously Florida gonna get wrecked climate change, I'm referring complete deferral responsibility conservatives collectively act climate change. lot ways I've seen coronavirus pandemic test run society react climate change since they're huge abstract crises solved acting together.

 parallels there; got bunch misinformation influencing people low scientific literacy, arrogant wealthy conservatives think money shield negative repercussions vested interest rejecting proactive alternatives current business models would cut profits, religious people refuse anything since see catastrophes God's will, run mill asshole über-patriotic conservatives refuse admit they're wrong anything oppose type social responsibility principle ""communism"" ""un-American"".

It's extremely frustrating. consistently states highest vaccination rates lowest cases, hospitalizations death. 

I sure vulnerable still danger, staff that's vaccinated going end killing care. got mine, put second dose first dose. |: I’ve contacted correct still haven’t heard anything. far know, still bit buggy, gosh want it! It’s nice versus piece paper. Thanks sharing. Great explanation multi tier approach reducing covid. understand people understand reduciotn veruses eliminate. stop wearing seatbelts someone wearing seatbelt died crash?  is, vaccines never expected totally prevent infection transmission, simply reduce also severely reduce symptoms breakthrough infections... stop people freaking out. don’t think blame people getting back lives point. Unless unvaccinated. people care, many do. turned political issue rather public health issue. Governor DeSantis made clear sees economic health state important protecting human life. opinion sees ticket White House 2024. really sucks going super spreader event regardless precautions taken... Delta still spread, even vaccine. maskless people huddled together going show spikes couple weeks. try protect unvaccinated. Unvaccinated people want open taking risk, vaccinated want lockdowns. Goes back hospital capacity thing guess    Pardon? even know react Aborted fetal cells fave  follow previous comment, looks like somebody else legwork wikipedia article [vaccination organized groups mention opposed vaccination Christian Scientists Congregation Universal Wisdom (plus Jehovah's Witnesses couple decades mid-1900s). groups may specific vaccines think vaccines made ingredients prohibited religion. US wants get vaccination high possible. main reason still advising mask requirement etc. terrible thing yes endemic point public needs know that. talking escape variant. vaccinated population doesn’t protection escape variant, definition.

Absolutely untrue, reason believe variant coronavirus 100% bypass vaccine protections anytime soon. mean unvaccinated. 
""The AHA said among virus patients, 85% unvaccinated."" entirely agree you, mean many Anti-Vaxxers seem impression *secondary goal* primary reason get jabbed.  


To them, every breakthrough case demonstration vaccines entire bunk, true -- *still* entirely useful proven worth, *even* *if* get covid. 


[More 99.99% people fully vaccinated Covid-19 breakthrough case resulting hospitalization 


It's amazing mRNA jabs successful reducing infections/transmissions first place, however pointing breakthrough cases examples vaccines ineffective reflective reality; still substantially effective reducing severity, odds getting hospitalized, getting intubated, dying chance get infected -- That's point make discuss vaccines them.

Thanks perspective though! Influenza changes much faster *per infection* coronaviruses have. that's bit oversimplied. larger number infected people means greater potential mutation, regard, entirely naive world population gives sars-cov2 bump relative coronaviruses, that's unlikely last long. intrinsic mutation rate sars-cov2 appear line coronaviruses appear fast influenza. go. vaccinated really anything worry about. Seems like bad time try go back school like nothing wrong....

Not sure right message US putting moment. think mainstream religions so, least officially. keep mind religious texts subject multiple interpretations, major religions might consider ""splinter groups"" derive astonishing variety beliefs base texts teachings.

Many religions element faith healing either currently historically. idea illness due spiritual problems, healed believe deity spirits, pray meditate, get people pray you, sort healing ceremony religious figure, eat foods prescribed religious tradition, fast, make sacrifices, etc. people believe faith healing seem think modern medicine either ineffective (since addressing true spiritual roots disease) sort cheating.

Using Christianity example, certainly faith healing Bible. Jesus healed sick raized Lazarus dead. modern Christians developed world pretty okay idea modern medicine.

Oh, going walk one back. (Something effect of, ""yes, vaccines make less likely transmit but..."") 

But yes, obvious highly vaccinated population can't stop transmission. Israel outlier among vaccinated countries, they're going Chile Seychelles others went through.

In long run vaccines help lot population level. individual level help lot. keeping R number 1 goal (I'm sure be, seems like goal), vaccines needed while. strong especially Delta variant. don’t vaccinate anyone smallpox it’s eradicated.

The virus continue mutate hosts allow duplicate. truly global problem requires work together. 

We sit say media media that, truth great deal politicians using platform inflict pains harm trying get past pandemic. 

At point want go back normal live lives without damn mask guys claiming “your rights infringed”. scenario like this, sort sacrifice little comfort freedoms work together get comforts freedoms back.

Jokes aside, good news, Sinovac job well, preventing thousands cases deaths want return normal need step reinforce protection.

The thing I'm worried there's much evidence happens mix Sinovac mRNA Astrazeneca, terms safety/efficacy. expect studies available decision. still think nothing bad happen, studies something would like have.  patriotic country USA failed laughably bad vaccinating population, even produced enough vaccines completely vaccine citizens.   Yeah shit. longer care die point. faster better take hospital resources. sure hollering about. mutation preventable. going happen eventually, somewhere, spread.

Have good day. What's alternative here? two children young vaccination, need daycare go earn living hospital work in. hospital work in, short staffed one cover shift need time (which already never take btw). daycare says child shows symptom Covid (i.e. runny nose, cough) daycare 10 days. someone explain exactly fuck supposed this? like think I'm pretty rational guy, wife vaccinated, trying best here, need two incomes survive. shit going drive otherwise rational people breaking point, I'm halfway now. troll account? don’t really understand aren’t understanding can’t people test positive people. understand exponents work number people would limiting factor growth. Lol funny thing pretty much agree everything said here. two young kids can't vaccinated wear KN94 mask work need go out(I try limit going much possible). think part it(the hesitancy amongst vaccinated) can't take anymore emotionally/mentally. get it, kids can't suffer I'm overwhelmed. 

Am glad replied sorry snarky comment originally. misjudged you. told Reuters employees' health top priority keep adhering local government guidance safe office return. company earlier year said planned ""office-centric culture,"" soon updated guidance requiring in-person work three days week, facing competition startups others offering flexible schedules. Also needle nothing compared flu shot. even league. easy as. Good luck. everyone US would get covid morning, get better mid-afternoon catch covid again? Lmao Hey… that’s Sir Erdrick you, Titan! mean, don’t read news don’t want to. literally stating reality. Yep, it’s taxpayers teaching kids. 

Please, It’s even taxpayers paying school supplies, teachers routinely pay classroom supplies pockets! deeply apologize offending many people offhanded unclear remarks. 

I written angered beyond describe people refuse vaccine refuse wear masks. There's excuse behavior. brother sister belong cult. talk acrimonious discussion beliefs. hope get sick. 

Nobody, especially medical community save lives daily, deserves mercy mean, selfish narcissists. fact, would died last February hsd get ER quickly. covid - vaccinated soon possibly could. still wear mask. least do. suggesting do? 

The President pretty limited authority masks such. It’s easy, however it’s necessary ever want stop never ending cycle variants. Zero covid joke massive spike cases due Delta though. Surprise, I'm statistician either understand exponents.  Surprise, I'm statistician either understand exponents. Where’s “UK reach 100k cases soon” crowd? Oh right. messaging place, yeah,I see CDC's fault, public relations team.

It's fault people idiots listen anyway. fault mixed messaging. least one place th SF bay area offering them, according article saw. Also year covid many unvaccinated people virus immunity unvaccinated group much higher Pfizer first came results, causing effective efficacy drop. 

I’d say numbers encouraging anything. risk significant amount issues require healthcare resources. equivalent driver gotten multiple accidents; likely theyll need insurance money future pay pool result  current Delta wave we’re experiencing primarily driven unvaccinated people. like 80-90% country vaccinated wouldn’t nearly bad. lot hospitalizations deaths associated current spike entirely preventable. Godspeed Sire Drick. Yeah, think would worked ton better said recommended businesses use “mask required except proof vaccine” policy. bet would made bunch antivaxxers fold inconvenience alone. Republican melt 3....2....1 Godspeed Sire Drick. underestimate scrawny Actually taxpayers. teacher employee. Taxpayers run entire public school system DeSantis idiot. mask ban wrong. 

The mask stance I’m criticizing Fauci 4 weeks ago Biden told us go party knew half country kids weren’t vaccinated susceptible.to infection. wasn’t surprise. F kids mentality what? keep posting pics cigars one comments on? Lol school ended year, decreased, it’s increasing school still closed? Sounds like mental gymnastics  say thing. I'm president though, one listening. course, half country listening president, either. idea would take listen. love idea stubborn person alive rolling initial mistake k vs joke point. 
Can’t wait see double country’s population get sick day. 
Covid-19 everyone - twice per day! pass, doesn’t look like Nurnburger… think times mask mandate makes total sense. pandemic shown us anything things lowest common denominator, sometimes means saying wear mask. 2 toddlers want get Covid. want watch feverish child struggling breathe. want vaccinated pass grandparents. Ignorance. Reddit unvaccinated Americans bad - 8% vaccinated India good. virus continues shift. Transmission control vaccine case previous strains. That’s longer even case. idiots delta everywhere. everyone taken shots it’s might contained. Certainly wouldn’t ER ICU disasters we’re seeing now. mutates form vaccine longer works for… well, maybe new vaccine soon after, maybe not. idiots refuse… etc… see it’s gonna end up. Would better better visibility, sadly articles bombastic headlines popular.

These reports show delta much different alfa least terms hospitalization fatality. Yes, mutations happen may take primary variant delta.

We can't control what's happening countries. model effective plan (which..we're sort really) send vaccines, we've done countries.

Except we've seen people test positive months virus infects mammals too, meaning would still around get back infecting humans spreading like before.

Everyone world staying would useless unrealistic. health experts also expressed concern Lollapalooza, outdoor music festival Chicago took place last weekend. Despite outside, packed crowds 100,000 concertgoers per day could lead surge amid contagious delta variant growing rate breakthrough cases among vaccinated.

Article mentions Lollapalooza - since I'm fan hidden objects games played ""find masks"" crowd shot. morbid fun. I'm going perfectly honest here, think anyone knows word comorbidities means may also be, hear out, intelligent. I, too, would like know many hospitalizations involve comorbidities compared need understand statistically significant patterns disease affects most.

Yes, dumb people use data go ""see, healthy people fine"" everyone else rightfully respond ""hey moron obese, hypertension, diabetic- three comorbidities we're talking may even five even know about.""

I understand point could used minimize severity COVID (and trust me, I'm attempting belittle crazy disease slightest), think room nuance conversation. People stupid excuse avoid talking it.

It seems like much reasonable request idiots shouting ""PROVING VACCINATION STATUS VIOLATION HIPPA (sic)"". Ultimately it’s decide live with. spouse also caring empathetic small scale, like me, kids, larger scale stuff, nope, it’s him. admit used hardcore conservative much understand “me” mentality. Worried what’s taken done us, despite benefit many others. grew past 15 years. dug heels further. Personally, can’t live someone worried fact wear mask work even though got vaccinated, got vaccinated ditch mask. he’s pandemic affected we’ve got people know dying. personally, staying marriage doesn’t seem ability care society makes hypocrite. can’t advocate decency care others staying married someone doesn’t give shit. every relationship individual solution won’t solution. Best luck, it’s tough feeling much contempt person loved most. Look know works, I'm math here. might case. Maybe that's ""viral load"" means. Idk, I'm epidemiologist. That's point trying make; people embrace something trials claiming vaccine passed 3 stages clinical trials experimental bad. even take back knee jerk downvotes clarification. mean, viral myocarditis common. incidence rate 10 22 per 100,000 viruses, accounting COVID. 

On hand, myocarditis vaccinations rare. COVID become endemic highly contagious, decent chance people come contact COVID point. wish gold give 🥇 virus care many people US. I'm simple math. look trend last weeks, that's clearly we're heading. 6 5 4 3 I'm going Nepal. I'll safer there. original variant, delta. Delta relatively new U.S. took summer months kids school.

It may may virulent children , since way contagious, lot kids fall ill, good chance see many pediatric complications, based numbers.

Many states (including mine) banned mask mandates schools, school mitigation measures place last year gone. hope told continue mask wearing since immunity. nah.

\- Biden, probably long ago might make difference I've read.  Florida. We're number 1. cancer survivor ass DIY shit CDC/FDA stumbles towards decisions like Bruce Vilanch getting shot elephant tranquilizer. son quarantine 2 weeks one classmates came COVID...the entire class masked. must changed rules since then....because masked made difference. Maybe Illinois conservative come quarantine.

Maybe IOWA rotate student every 14 minutes avoid 15 minute sustained contact rule. “Learning live it” overwhelms hospitals isn’t exactly sustainable.  I’m sure downvotes. fair ask age pre-existing conditions. link kids, determine higher risk factors. like let's come complete stop approach intersection. Australia lockdown 6 weeks. Good news though population getting boosters. Since Friday 300,000 got third dose.

From article:
Among serious condition age 60, balance shifts: fully vaccinated patients serious conditions unvaccinated ones. However, 91% relevant population – almost 1.6 million people – fully immunized, 109,000 people protected. show me, article talks chills fever. seen reports vaccinated long Covid. science supported mask wearing vaccination useless alpha vaccination alone would eliminate it. 

The CDC nothing mandates anymore does. testing right front door wait line everyone see you.

That's shaming part. Okay, show data. point I'd get coverall 😂 doesn’t. Employees actively encouraged report etc it’s super toxic Would like minimum wage earner enforce that? neither. title bit misleading reading article broken down, clear getting vaccine better choice. I’m 4 5 months second moderna dose.

Does anyone know data regarding efficacy delta early yet? definitely want get third dose I’m able to. still worded poorly. vaccine EVER stop transmission 100% infected people?? said likelihood transmission greater before. thinking this. get Pfizer/Moderna shot? bad mix them? Nobody responds facts.  FAFO  72,000 children hospitalized? going need source that. article mentioned fewer 150 kids hospitalized Florida, state. This. Delta transmissible community spread timeline weeks, months like original strain. Never thought I'd say ""I think agree insurance companies"". probably doesn’t want follow New York’s example last year expected 180,000 beds filled called hospital navy ship, ended using 16,000 beds.

There probably pocket communities Florida fucked combination low vaccination rates &amp; natural immunity.

DeSantis probably looking UK &amp; Netherlands recovered 2 week surge cases. He’s probably expecting happen state.

This unpopular opinion constituents likely care businesses &amp; economy looks next half year/year two-three weeks could dented surge save unvaccinated lives millions dollars &amp; harsh restrictions

I Personally don’t necessarily agree it. DeSantis gambling it, might win big comes unscathed. Floridians already agree handled Florida last summer restrictions compared California handled strict restrictions. states ended similar case numbers. lower symptoms mean less viral reproducing, turn leads lower chance mutation spread. least that's understand it. mention people think paper vaccine cards shot easily forgeable want Vaccine Passports smartphone app tied next generation REAL ID cards. Children others can’t get vaccines? Great, delinquently sit application months, way Pfizer's. Hey buddy, blow stupid town? didn’t say like week ago boosters wouldn’t needed? Make damn minds. I'm sad people. know do. “Dr. Hardy TS Kagimoto, Chairman CEO Healios, commented “We thrilled report positive results ONE-BRIDGE study. HLCM051 demonstrated approximately 39% reduction mortality relative standard therapy group, giving us confidence efficacy save lives patients would otherwise die pneumonia-induced ARDS.” fact hospitals CEOs obscene itself. Healthcare run profit. Newcastle remote community several hours outside Sydney. teenager traveled Sydney (who later turned infected) attend beach party, caused cases appear Newcastle COVID free.

Australia kind unique position observe kind transmission due low cases virus community (although Sydney getting tipping point control now) combined advanced contact tracing. many chains transmission linked moment. Travel agencies likely won’t mandate .. hospitals may refuse nurses since it’s employees probably won’t even bat eye guys sense humor all! think I’d rather focus masking vaccinated people. Tell us facts let us decide them. don’t need color coding system checking 7 day percentages that.

While hate statement got headline, like way broke certain situations given extra consideration (if live someone can’t get vaccine immunocompromised example). think trying speak people specific circumstance going effective point trying broadly blanker everyone.

I think trying get spread reduction people already carrying spread reduction weight effort diminishing returns. Put every effort getting people vaccinated, make boosters available want them, end it, barring massive unexpected change circumstances. sure. know someone front line work told me, family went pharmacy said first shot got third. According news today, boosters pushed pretty hard, may available next month anyway. get booster shot??? No, it’s plenty us would like able determine actual risk children without comorbidities without bombarded sensationalized headlines. course every death one many, that’s husband got vaccinated soon possible try make safe choices.

Steroids treat crazy inflammation associated COVID-19 know states keeping record? tell yet going regular boosters everyone. Yup sure dumber.

That’s I’m wanting government come something better. No, it’s quitting job. don’t give two weeks notice reflected record/referral try get new job that’s it. like job. even patient abandonment?

Kudos article backing scary headline actual numbers. context 21,000 positive cases last week FL kids 19. 135 hospitalizations.  think necessarily case high vaccination rates can't stop transmission delta's increased R0 means higher vaccination rates needed. understanding vaccination reduces R0 reducing transmission infected vaccinated individual reducing likelihood vaccinated person becomes infected. Delta changed likelihood much seems going change effectiveness, need go ~70% fully vaccinated ~80-90% fully vaccinated theory. Look uk line graph cases. see two nice spikes end.

Florida beat Louisiana legalese, guideline globally. I've even heard local cases small city Finland they've call ambulance allergic reaction. It’s literally did, didn’t downvote posts. Calm dude. believe COVID pre-vaccine, several months J&amp;J shot tested positive covid, symptoms incredibly mild, there's another data point you. probably ballpark figure never get specifics, likely China good job containing covid least recently.

People basically living normal lives, social media (Weibo, WeChat) see users getting creative insinuate covid outbreaks (which would certain happen even official crackdown outbreaks)

But start seeing sporadic reports resurgence due delta, like one: let's see unfolds.  FWIW, Pfizer me. Think literally worst I've ever felt life illness-wise. 2nd shot sucked horribly.. totally fine day later though. Yup. kid daughter’s class diagnosed today. Hardly anyone wearing mask. I’m mad right now. totally vaccination think rip big pharma earn huge money!

How something free rip off? Tell they’ve already paid tax dollars might well claim dose. Wow... user deleted comment. post username we're gonna save reply ones help move goal post. Y’all vaxers arrogant boastful people it.

I fucking idea vaccinated people moving goal posts. Taking shot available goal post especially walk day appointment every state US get vaccinated. goal post. collective suffering affecting everyone would needless goal post.

Nice projection buddy. said said AntiVa arrogant boastful. agree. try play sides same. Sorry bud. imagining things. projecting feelings others. agree CDC really fucked timing lifting mask recommendations.

Not directed sharing information. nonsense. thought side effects pretty mild: arm sore hell whatever, mild fatigue. got second shot night full body tremors (calling chills doesn’t justice) like 30 minutes. fatigue week.

Still worth it. I'm fully vaccinated J&amp;J yet got breakthrough infection, I'll let anyone curious know like me.

I got infected point week long convention. Very, minor symptoms started couple days heading home (initially slightly sore throat), PCR test day symptom onset came back positive. also got rapid test sure also came back positive.

My symptoms mild, isolation need go far greater nuisance actual disease itself. me, worst symptoms were: moderately sore throat, feeling chills bit sweating, bit cough, barely noticeable headache, fever (although realize PatientFirst took temperature day rapid test). still taste fine, although may lost bit sense smell (not entirely sure). Also finding needing blow nose bit often, that's problem I've long covid came play, could unrelated.

I’m back normal apart occasional mask indoors. Isn’t whole conversation happening sub right regarding many feel I’ll post attending? Same. need hurry approve dose 3. Pfeizer 86% effective 6 months even get Delta. It’s obviously WAY number. Certainly it’s saving lives it’s effective needs people living life like normal.

If keep seeing evolution like new variants, vaccines never keep even everyone vaccinated getting boosters twice year. ""I've never read novel lack ability imagine anything happening lived experience"". 34% population infected, 56-70% vaccinated still spreading? they'll make disingenuous argument deny care obese drug addicted. There’s nuts blaming Cuban boat refugees Covid Florida lol. 100% would put money many, many noses out, chinstraps. guess aren’t fonde covid. foreign money =\\= governments   doesn’t even account Delta. Pfeizer 86% effective 6 months delta happened. knows low now? whole situation really sucks. Preliminary studies: Biden demand every place resume WFH was.

This third wave going 10x worse. 

No one suffer die moron expects someone sit office that's death chamber. Don’t mess Florida, Texas. covid Missouri ground. voted for. Randomly I’ll stumble upon comment someone US holding Novavax don’t get point. Like it’s clearly happening soon it’s time look towards one 3 options currently Good stay, AZ Pfizer 2 ingredients trigger rare allergies, think one polysorbate PEG. observation period safety. *shocked Pikachu face* neighborhoods towns without pollution go way price, plus, still large pool slaves draw work, since lots choice Yea AIDS takes years develop. says they're planning submit full FDA approval month. assume process might take while, anyone insight long may take? Lambda variant coronavirus, first identified Peru spreading South America, highly infectious resistant vaccines **than original version virus emerged Wuhan, China,** Japanese researchers found.

So every variant.

Also, I'm directly quoting, ""that emerged Wuhan"". There's typo. Step One Blame Chinese

Step Two Blame Mexicans

Step Three?  really helped, thanks! *now concussion, find health care* base lap up. get it? Better alternative (looking you, Florida), I’d rather vaccines mandates 12, mask mandate children young get vaccinated.  School starting mandate masks put ""interesting"" apocryphal curse ""May live interesting times"" Remember majority last year constantly told covid doesn’t mutate proofreading genes? Like, whatever happened that? lead possible spread hospital staff? whole hospital goes down. short Rona. aid possible treatment anti vaxxers? understand it: multiple tests must performed assess immune system response. (antibody tests) readily available easily administered. Others tests, cellular immunity tests, complicated/expensive available wide spread basis. problem tests results cannot easily translated level protection individual basis. People's bodies react differently infection vaccination. thus doctors can't look results tests say confidently protected (partially full) future infection.  Nobody hospitalized. vaccines work. I’d rather feel sick week stay home another year. suprise. 100% effective. key many cases result serious illness.

Will media put story every case? According BioRxiv, preliminary studies showing Lambda virulent suggests current vaccines work. Take grain salt since studies peer reviewed time, I’m surely hoping wrong. feel parents live stupid school districts. imagine.

Arguably, school age kids sacrificed anyone else this, minus medical workers certain others.

At time, mere months kids get vaccine, many places saying ""hah, got mine, forget kids!"" 

As much sacrificed, really think unfair them. Allow get vaccine, too. right. super thankful kids' school district, fully returning, still going masks, filtered air, protections much possible, really wish would this. know kids statistically much lower risk, son through, catch end despite we've done, I'd feel terrible. Fuck doctors nurses. - Abbott. [At least one still saying point administration offers piazza instead actually fixing underlying issues causing everyone burnout. pacifying us like bunch elementary school children. Fuck piazza Hey Missouri longer ground zero! Crazy people, man. looped. people procrastinating wait see mode. anti-vaxxers still anti vax saw various media outlets. sure people get them. unvaccinated basically variant factories unnecessarily putting risk long-term covid issues death. Check company stock holders? I'm board everything said, except last sentence. Vaccines useful need used. simultaneously need safe. Pfizer/Moderna cause issues specific sections population, par virus itself, much good group. Donald Trump Jr Ron DeSantis statistically tied top favorability poll among Republican voters early July. probably made think he's well staying course doubling down. question: healthcare worker fully vaccinated yet probably protected COVID due medication take modifies immune response. think matters comes mandated vaccination? I’m wondering! 

And fwiw I’m 100% pro employer school vaccine mandates. fine. Make sure well hydrated hand Tylenol hand incase really need it. think know DeSantis Abbott this: It’s make Bid3n Administration look bad keeping cases high vaccinations low, point say “See? Bid3n failed America! Ds failed America again!” They’re using people pawns again. Carnival running 100% vaccinated crew 95% vaccinated pax. 50 nonvaccinated, likely kids eligible vaccine. Intranasal vaccines? Time quit messing around Counties enough vaccine supply real impact cases small minority stage. comment replied said covid would still going globally. is. quite time. disrespectful people countries ravaged covid suggest ""its over"". 

I mean shit, Florida seeing time high hospitalizations, too. getting worse many parts US ever close 60% vaccinated least 1 dose.  studies this? seriously, vaccine available unvaccinated staff ""kill care""? ah, no...they follow standard protocols PPEs even PPE shortages...to make analogy misleading make health care staff look like incompetent fools vaccinated unvaccinated. article's 2013. little slow, catching on. people field life general respect? Like priest celebrity famous writer admire? 

It may sound better coming someone already trust. Distancing yeah got point. Explain mask affecting though. at-home test? Congress claw back unemployment stimulus benefits anyone vaccinated. pass retroactive tax, believe upheld constitutional supreme court.

Won't happen, guy dream. Many insurance companies waived copays coronavirus treatment recently. They're generally anymore.

Maybe take rash medical bankruptcies among people certain persuasion. got downvoted, bring interesting point. I'm pro-vaccine, limited supply begin, creating barriers, regardless barrier is, going make situation worse.

A basic economic concept supply demand put vaccine test.

Just today, hospital system started offering $25k signing bonuses always ""forever""? Eventually enough people vaccinated worldwide risk new variants much lower.

Whether think they're stupid not, technical specific education would take time money replace already short employee market.

I posted weeks ago Banner Health requiring vaccine. Meanwhile, I've heard rumors employees close 50% vaccinated rate among employees (keep mind California rates much higher). Yet recent news reports indicate company 800 open positions nationwide. Even pretty massive increase vaccinations Nov 1 deadline, massive layoffs stick guns, see reconciled.

It’s important note vaccines still give us high level protection becoming infected first place. 

You can’t spread COVID *unless* you’re infected, breakthrough infections still rare, even delta. comment implies vaccines don’t help transmission anymore, absolutely case. 

In rare case breakthrough infection—yes transmitted. *vast* majority transmission coming unvaccinated individuals. Hi! Prefacing with, pro vaccine, got 2nd jab weeks ago.

It's money. Replace COVID RSV virus one cares. Take minute look lethality RSV kids. It’s worse COVID expect kids get precautions. Same, take home message ever, get vaccinated limit contacts. kids can, 12+. doesn’t look like article says old child was. random.

But millions cases, natural evolution lead survival mutations fitter environment. 

And vaccines environment, means mutations better evading vaccines survive better.

It’s sad it’s reality.   people like vaccine still spread covid wouldn’t test us also? Huge supply problem!  exactly. kids district excellent job. Kids cam day, plenty facetime interactions breakout study groups. 

Was good class? No. think faculty amazing job though. 

I worried kid year delta. gonna lie. lack smell/taste thing keeps long, try using steroid nasal spray like Flonase generics. Helped get mine back normal months. state used COVID aid money tourism ads like South Dakota last year? lost taste smell 7 months I’d say I’m 90% recovered. people don’t lose smell forever. idea exactly long since it’s year two data first place. Definitely weird experience don’t wish anyone else. mom last year. step-dad put money together, bought newer F250 (before truck boom) 5th wheel camper. travel country making 3x much before, plus housing stipend gets like 3k lot rent per month usually like 500.. bankrolled. Lol. I'm jealous yet happy them. Well perhaps treating unvaxxed covid patients day finally get heads covid serious vaccines work.  Archive link: can't tell sarcasm Relatively low vaccination rates 16.6% adult population far

Is supply problem demand problem? vaccinated last may? Like vaccines even market? People don’t need jobs anymore long covid lots heart fluttering/high heart rate, esp standing up, months end along fatigue. slowly subsided never went totally away. got second pfizer dose, noticed lot chest discomfort again, though bad first dealing long covid. fatigue got quite bit better though, weirdly enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm low dose (25mg) Beta Blocker relieve chest discomfort/fluttering worked tremendously well me. seems idea that's vogue scary headlines stoke higher rates vaccination. U.S. we've actually seen rates go stalling month two, short term, may well working.

The scary part is, happens hit next vaccination plateau (which inevitable, matter doom-oriented news gets) we're blood squeeze bad news stone?

Retreading old pessimistic ground, restrictions mandates returning, enormous cost - mental health, even economy. We'd better damn sure worth get result short-term 5-10% spike vaccinated population nevertheless stalls out. son do? 6 week old freaking out. get vaccinated pregnant hoping confers help immune system scary many around us expect us back normal. masking husband go work. 6 weeks I. We’re attorneys worked home last year everyone wants pretend like things “normal” again. Wobbuffet! pattern goes lil deeper still. Consider attrition values nurses jumped field motivated accelerating pay increases already lookin back door well pandemic. 

I suppose could make argument honest representation facts regarding covid pressing issues. least wile narrative interpreted/expressed agencies skin game.  6 months got second shot March? *regardless anyone provide example might legitimate religious exemption getting vaccinated? suppose Christian Scientists (of people!) issue getting medical help, justify it, anybody else? let’s open schools ignore mask mandates!!! Someone poor immune system less protected vaccine.

Which would mean they're also likely unvaccinated, no? point. I'm sharing personal opinion, here. observing perfect example natural selection work. physically mentally weak ones likely die Covid. physically weak perhaps can't handle vaccine, mentally weak they're stupid unwilling take seriously. 

This literally nature operates every living species earth; dumb weak always die first. almost like trust media government eroding I'm sure rest world vaccine supply issue not. places like Japan &amp; Hong Kong enough supply population government dragging feet. India manufactures vaccines rest world, yet unable vaccinate population. delta wave, charging people money shots. forgetting countless laws regulations concerning driving get us number? That's exactly good argument. Especially feel state transportation abysmal dangerous USA agreeing pointing many topics. 

You list numbers know them. I'll help figure numbers determine vaccine effectiveness preventing hospitalizations. 

You take total number unvaccinated, positive, individuals hospitalized divide number total unvaccinated positive cases. gives percentage, telling you, okay x unvaccinated cases end hospital. thing vaccinated cases, divide total vaccinated cases hospital total vaccinated cases period. compare two percentages say ""oh okay, 20% vaccinated cases end hospital 50% unvaccinated cases end hospital"". pretty basic math word problem.

(Though, twins probably stop eating tots) move Florida assuming anyone doesn’t wear helmet probably vaccinated? Vaccine efficacy given multiplier rather percentage:

[Vaccine percentage reduction disease vaccinated group people compared unvaccinated group. example, vaccine efficacy 80% means **5 times** unvaccinated people infected (or suffered serious disease, died, depending measured), vaccine boosted immunity 5x. 90% efficacy would 10x, 95% efficacy would 20x, etc. (The formula multiplier 1 / (1 - e), e efficacy given decimal value.)

I believe vaccine efficacy communicated public multiplier, percentage. Would rather vaccine 50% effective, vaccine doubles immunity? latter sounds much appealing, mean exactly thing. 

It's possible small significant amount vaccine hesitancy could overcome technique. Many believe vaccines effective, efficacy given hard-to-understand percentage feeds that. People interpret percentages like letter grades. ""95% effective? Sure, sounds like A... 70% effective delta? sounds like C me. 30% chance getting sick worse now... I'll wait better product."" hard argue ""increases immunity 3x!"" 

This promotes nuanced discussion vaccine efficacy around fact multiplier actually average protection multiple, people receive protection less, right around number. also makes easier understand protection absolute, heavy exposure still puts high risk infection, even vaccine protection multiplier. makes easier ordinary people calibrate risk behaviour given level protection. ""3x protection? means worry one-third much exposure want maintain risk level.""

Thoughts? That's true, require flu shots still get transmit flu even vaccinated. Schools typically require vaccines sterilizing immunity. Unfortunately, COVID vaccines like flu shots. IMO need better vaccines need mandates. likely possibility [less difference delta alpha tremendous alpha cases dropping everywhere.

Well, tried drinking bleach /a numbers insane, cases still rising, hospitalizations nowhere near peak. Oh no! I'm sorry hear that. ridiculous people time living pandemic still want understand. Careless selfish people putting others risk. hope stay safe  that's feature, bug. delta variant well believe it’s great filter. ""protecting"" children goal.

As long kids, listen narrative convenient them.

Just send ""hopes prayers"". others. seems like read before, different staffer actually positive Scotland trip. recent one.  Stupid bot!!! insulting anyone. responding u/heretobefriends's comment Chris Chan. comment WAY uncivil to, directed at, u/heretobefriends!!! Third death, cares? Seriously comes highly educated family. father doctor started medical school well. hope hope antivax.

If ever get cluster headaches, dad expert field. Near end article say vaccinated people would expected able travel dont think I'd bother unless planning visit high risk person next couple days - even wouldnt get results back likely  Calm mate. Also surburbs Chicago aren’t liberal. compared Cook County vaccinated isnt he? It’s definitely Jack Geller! Isn’t lowest-risk group 1-18 age group? saying they’re dying, risk lowest groups? 

I say 15 year old friends anti-vax parents. won’t lock again, CURE PANDEMIC.

WE LITERALLY TOOL COULD END ENTIRE THING LESS MONTH. 

Lockdowns sledgehammer use options. silver bullet end this, people stupid use it.

Hell we’re going punish everyone bc lol idiots refuse accept science. would mind showing two sets numbers side side source? looking JJ study larger study nurses south africa showed similar results one another School starts Tuesday Florida counties. think sign folks. LONG way go. far in, half population fully vaccinated. Good I’ll happily take mine I’m surprised disappointed many people waited August get vaccinated. assumed would black-and-white, either “inject now” “get away 5G chips”. 

I’d curious see responses “why choose get vaccinated today” would today, vs. six months ago. “Children teenagers across state increasingly hospitalized contracting virus last couple weeks.”

“That data, available state Tuesday, shows five people age 10 17 people age 20 hospitalized virus past 30 days. state reported higher levels hospitalizations age groups throughout much last year” understand said uncomfortable frustrated. likely anyway want wearing mask. last thing wants advice wear mask. guess way look is, kids mask go school strikes balance keeping home school without precautions. envy parents navigate circumstances either way.  There’s also vaccinated could need ICU different medical issues related Covid. Pediatric ICUs full respiratory cases. Covid. It’s mainly RSV. side affect lockdowns masking. It’s making lost time. Florida #1 bay-beee!!! got automodded calling sly witty b****rd witticism meant good way. DeSantis America! pandemic never gonna end  Nah, he's fiddling, he's finding empty buckets throwing fire can't used carry water. Typical response someone feels threatened. Thank im surprised reporting/testing, india lot people still developing. 

but still think important note indias trending delta pretty line areas high transmission. big surge, almost mirrored drop off. thats happens virus burns host population. Thanks!

And wow, vaccination rate said local population Israel actually high?? It’s probably dependent area. rural Missouri people “meh” attitude Covid *still* haven’t made effort wear masks social distance.  
It’s life usual since last year here. course got free vaccines every pharmacy around go you’re gonna get treated like you’re walking abortion clinic.  
I know several people won’t get vaccinated “there’s reason to, it’s political”. How? Especially given current makeup.

It's current makeup problem following previous precedent Jacobson v Mass precedent. one case court yet overturned precedent. totally catch again. That's covid positive people still get vaccinated. That's vaccinated people still catch (with Delta) pass on. immunity like thinking is. magic. yes MRNA better, knew trials released, takes significant study like know sure. 

i think definition ""bad"" skewed MRNA good. compared ""no vaccination"" JJ wonderful year half ago started told vaccine would work 94/4/2 covid we'd accept heart beat actually think virus purposely made released could make vaccines make money vaccines. Stupid fucks.

Even believe that, correct thing would still get vaccine, *especially* free. matter came (or why); dangerous, vaccines work.

I know I'm preaching choir conspiracy theory even internal consistency. happens start dehumanize unvaccinated. lose empathy situation, lead dark path. Although breakthrough cases rare, still spread virus people, leads innocent people getting hurt people can't get vaccinated, people need go hospital non-COVID related incidents, people work health care. Ironically, vaccinated people still affected may need go hospital may admitted hospital full. ""Just let unvaccinated die."" Sorry, work like never work like that. easier dehumanize people rather come terms one horrible human whole time like people refused follow social distancing mask mandates. unempathetic vaccinated unlike unvaccinated themselves, difference jab vaccine.

Like not, everyone pandemic long haul, keep slow stop spread, even means inconvenience order protect unvaccinated people. understand frustrations also extremely frustrated unvaccinated people making things difficult, can. defense people unwilling get vaccine either, absolutely need to, need serious introspection get crisis. people vaccinated eventually either get infected get antibodies die. Unless plan hold stick needles arms isnt much done free societies least.

Those us vaccinated need get back living lives. vaccines seem effective stoping people fron dying good path. think article says they're vaccinated not, assuming not. I've heard far, getting vaccine actually helped mitigate symptoms people long Covid. Dears,

any recommended informations / articles protect delta variant, way transmittable?

I mean vaccines, taking precautionary steps like masking (which models - N95 still enough?), taking vitamines, HEPA filters on. every School Board mask mandate, think ones major cities, likely going like, 200 kids total end going either neighbouring public district mask mandate, private, probably basic ""Christian"" school like 8k tuition mask mandate. 

Its going ""every kid florida"" long shot, probably even every anti masker kid florida parents realize either wear mask, wake 5:30 district bus. Well definition vaccine again

&amp;#x200B;

a substance used stimulate production antibodies provide (Immunity) one several diseases, prepared causative agent disease, products, synthetic substitute, treated act antigen without inducing disease. Immunity means protected cant get it. Ohhhh see haha. I’ll eat crow Yeah, mean, I'm morbidly obese stupid, got fat ass vaccinated soon could working bariatric doctors lose weight. Though vaccinating lot quicker losing 100 pounds. lot people immediately follow sensible policy, throw hands give up?

It took decade get people wear seatbelts first came out, still working getting people quit smoking tobacco many decades. Changing behavior huge group people definitely happen overnight. get vaxxed wear masked indoors fine

And 3 localities, less. I'm sure exactly mean ""we seriously overreacting Delta"" places densely populated areas country.

Several places substantially less making impossible anyone apply pressure getting people vaxxed masked. sacrificing health - attempt protect it. obviously end well.

If meant literally leaving house, nowhere world required. know actual situation is. know need help dealing stress.

Get mental health care need. Figure safe enough area (unfortunately, 100% safe possible, going puts situation lose mental health). FTA:
 said expects seek Food Drug Administration authorization give vaccine kids 12 September.
 
In case one else curious. gym Flatiron one wearing mask. I'd stopped wearing mask like everyone else, started wearing one month ago delta started making entrance. seem like others got memo yet. Timeliness care important, patient safety even important.

Our first goal harm, point getting vaccine comes close actively harming patient. Now, passengers. informal tracing. Sturgis's rally. “We’re gonna die arrogance, that’s might well take time” literally one anecdote. Obviously, *can* affect children, see here, mean *generally* affects children. writes algorithms? Hold accountable. GOD I’m fucking sick tired Republicans using excuse “GoVt DoEsN’T WoRk” every time inevitably fail everything. 

Government plenty shit. 

Government put people moon built Hoover Dam eradicated polio.

**YOUR** bullshit-ass government doesn’t work, embrace ignorance actively try sabotage effective government sake corporate profit personal politics. 

GTFO bullshit self-fulfilling prophecy. 

It’s excuse child would use. talked mine concerned COVID babies. risk RSV concerning.  took list US states percent population 1 dose compared countries. instance, Scotland state, would rank second US.  repeated ignorant fact viruses hosted human bodies despite age. who? tickets G&amp;R later month San Jose. masks proof vaccination/neg test well.

This playing pretty much like thought would- hit majority vaccination levels people's patience dealing loud unvaccinated minority would exhausted. Welcome Sturgis Super Spreader Ver. 2.0. Agreed. long whatever family member held views. read cases anti-vaxxer less told sick family member, held different view, covid like flu they'll fine.

The impenetrable armor fellow ""believer"" must punctured rattle borderline sociopaths. vast, vast majority people hospitals unvaccinated adults chose receive shot. idiots, others receive shot legitimate reasons (age), suffering. It’s literally simple comprehend either actively denying reality afraid admit wrong, plain simple stupid. choice. significant thing story child transferred child transferred far major metropolitan area. entire Houston metro area can't find room one kid non covid medical emergency. big. I'm sure would done *much* better job job info time 🙄  ask why? means parents feel child safer, it? That’s exactly situation right now. Need results within 72 hours flight. really hope get time! Last resort guess combination airlines hit hard COVID restrictions, crew shortages expense cancelling flights result. Also, passenger even crew member, want sitting tube bunch unvaccinated flight attendants interact hundreds people country/world day. understanding get voucher public school mandates masks, way around. Board Education approved emergency rule allow private school vouchers parents feel children harassed school district’s COVID-19 safety policies, including requirements wear masks.&lt;&lt;

Which pandering base, also mostly hurts schools districts popular. Well, unlike US, people UK legally obligated socialize all, excuse.  get sit home suck expanded unemployment benefits

ah yeah $300 top less minimum wage unemployment checks. ballin out. watched mother die vent 20 years ago. ICU 8 years ago watched guy next die vent, alone family could ever visit live nearby. almost died vent less week prior ICU least opportunity say good bye loved ones case. Dying vent ugly painful everyone involved.

I like you, want visit anyone, family, person dies, medical staff fights desperately hard save avail. heart wrenching. I've watched doctors nurses bawling, dry tears go back work someone else depended life. cause inflicting pain anyone.

I sorry loss, deserve that, terrible burden bear know nothing say ever assuage. point hospitals say, “sorry we’re closed.”?  Yep. like I'm study author, early stage reasonable study huge population studied well including control group. Seems like, reasons mention, possibly could estimate, hence 5%.

Like said elsewhere thread main point impossible pin risk long-covid (itself poorly defined) point current data. Seems like \[1% - 10%\] reasonable range.

Then question becomes: given know risk? Curious knew BIL caught delta. exactly test that?  already saw episode. gets elected position he's handled COVID, sick. guy literally give fuck covid please Team Red Trump.  Wrong DeSatan needs shut resign he's dragged office angry mob. Perfect. Although I’d rather see vaccinated. terms data, Johns Hopkins currently 15 children COVID-19 admitted hospital today, four ICU. However, patients COVID doctors seeing emergency center manage symptoms home, according hospital. Transmission among vaccinated always possible long majority population vaccinated, policies fine. dude, dressed dude, disguised another dude. escalate one upper middle management chain, equivalent thousand calls. 1% reddit it....congrats. think tomorrow latest! issue countries requiring test within 72 hours departure also take 72 hours get test results back. It’s delicate game fucking tear up. 5 month old 

With without Covid, people go back more-or-less normal life, kid /u/NeatoNico’s kid (followed everyone live with) going sick every month two next several years years, stuff pick playground / daycare / school / friends (RSV, flu, parainfluenza, adenoviruz, rhinovirus, coxsackie virus enteroviruses, norovirus, parvovirus, Covid, ....). scary parent, kids extremely likely get fine.

For past year half everyone (in cautious parts world) living new society small kids lot less mingling usual, don’t get sick much all. it’s coming. Fingers crossed ever experience medium fevers, aches, stuffy noses, occasional vomiting, avoid serious symptoms like bronchitis pneumonia. Thankfully lot previously common viruses effective vaccines kids don’t end getting measles, rubella, rotavirus, chicken pox, polio, etc. anymore.

Sadly small proportion small kids serious illness, society many serious risks people live with. E.g. living near cars much riskier kids common viral infections.

Natural selection thin electorate. college students going back school Well anything it’s pretty good sign safe go large outdoor gatherings particularly vaccinated. time you’re allowed discriminate someone religion.

There isn’t *law* saying vaccinate work airline, it’s United Airlines policy.

If made policy said, “You must eat pork fired,” would illegal *because discriminates people practice Jewish Islamic religions*. 

At time vegetarians may complain, vegetarian religious protected class, it’s *illegal*.

This kind policy also ridiculous policy face, make contractual agreement says basically whatever want, something illegal protected class.

So religious exemption exists, show religion says, “you vaccinated,” cannot discriminate that, within reason. loads times, dad long distance trucker used go longer trips, states havent Alaska Maine, likely I've seen you, yes?

With Walgreens PCR testing, long take get results? need results flight I’m wondering I’ll likely results time.

Bonus got done recently haha. can't bothered (don't understand) science Floridian? don’t think know you’re talking about. It’s matter lower positivity rate. testing numbers plateauing combination things, isn’t related less people getting sick. We’re reaching testing capacity, lots people feel sick aren’t even bothering get tested since point assume going exposed. went schedule test morning earliest available testing times CVS weren’t Tuesday afternoon. That’s entire Orlando metro area. slowing here, getting started going apparent coming weeks. Countless studies shown vaccinated people safe, I’m really taking precautions protect myself. taking precautions protect kids immunocompromised, sure, MUCH bigger threat anti vax.

And literally said kids situation unfortunate… sympathy family. conflicting statements? ya, employees making minimum wage? crime humanity. people dying everywhere would take vaccines instant.

As long unvaccinated people America countries active travel business, pandemic end. true economic recovery home requires global recovery. Yeah apparently done wonderful job contact tracing Australia. 

It’s interesting see different strategies playing out. Obviously, isn’t Florida’s strategy (more American strategy actually).

Edit: typos people saying covid affect children. Read this. positivity rate near 20%. means isn’t nearly enough testing capture full extent spread. hate say think case. virus everywhere.  catch eventually. question becomes get vaccine lessen effects virus not? smart. Take care smart around people need to.  25% fully vaccinated, bad, keep pace. Well, stepmother really responsible this. husband teens' mother are. also responsible obvious COVID risk factor here.  Anti vax human beings, endangering themselves. vaccinated people chose take precautions protect them. don’t even know would care you’re judging me? I’m judging too. don’t care… absolutely feel sympathy family.

Me: stand 11-month-old flown Houston?

You: Unfortunate, absolutely feel sympathy anti-vaxxers, change lifestyle protect them.

Nobody asking feel sympathy anti-vaxxers. asked protect children, immunocompromised, *yourself.* understand this, way immature discussing this. signed trial! seen several, far less severe generally older. heard vaccinated hospitalization extended social circles, although may one I'm assuming one hospitalization unvaxxed due general attitudes political persuasion, can't say sure I'd rather error side calling unvaxxed. personally gone indoor restaurants. Probably unless they're vaxx'd only. certainly experience GA pilots idea airline don’t think they’re denial it’s stay, they’re pissed everything right people didn’t fucking again.

So vaccinated vs unvaccinated factor make much difference. Let's say two individuals came - unvaccinated individual significantly lower mSOFA score vaccinated individual. Rationally, unvaccinated individual selected get care better chance surviving. seems prudent business perspective. majority Americans vaccinated would embrace return normal knew surrounded vaccinated people. think many relish concept this, returning life like 2019 happening anytime soon. 

Just anecdotally, husband friends fortunate enough spend great deal travel, dining, entertainment, etc. latest Delta variant, friends scaling back activities even though we're vaccinated, we'd like wait latest data actually safe.

Besides many better reasons fly United this! groundbreaking discovery right people immune virus get virus Politicizing virus seems like good way keep unvaccinated reconsidering stance. diminishes perceived threat one large gathering criticized another totally fine ""You understand punishment, right?

You understand punishment, right? Like, really harming others community - - spite people? agenda (permanent WFH, in-person events since they're introverts, parties since never get invited, etc)

I think motivation businesses like airlines attract people took Pandemic seriously.

Similarly Disney requires vaccination personnel indoor masks even though Florida would get governor's support didn't. believe customers willing pay Disneyland tickets ones might still avoiding due pandemic. think newborns mothers vaccinated pregnancy going (relatively) protected? thoughts long immunity last? We're going hire nanny go back work, risk (and husband course works office now). Terrified 6 week old. mean, today.

Euro finals gathering everyone together, would expected things keep increasing lower rate. reaching sort herd immunity, would expected turn around gradual. vaccinations continue climb, may need to. 

That may sound like naive hope, doctors reporting delta variant moves quickly. I'll find sources attach bit, reported patients expiring lot faster OG strain - people may spent weeks ICU, expiring within days. think quicker ""effect"" follows ""cause"", higher vaccination rates go. Similar reason give blood, cookies juice boxes. Feels like crime, it?

Throughout pandemic, cared kids admitted covid-19 children's hospital Houston pediatrician. children included newborns fevers require sepsis evaluation, school-age kids whose bodies ravaged inflammation associated covid-19 children, tweens adolescents covid pneumonia need oxygen respiratory support. I've cared children whose entire families devastated covid - sometimes child sick enough admitted parent bedside parents critically ill adult hospital street or, worse, recently died covid.

All while, doctor mother, I've wrestled certain dissonance: popular notion covid affect children - public health epidemiologic training reminds population-level, true, majority children contract covid-19 asymptomatic mild disease. contrast reality clinician bedside children critically ill covid covid-related illnesses. two perspectives battle brain make risk assessments school-aged child. One thing terrifies parent can't predict children get incredibly sick covid others mild disease; know go lingering debilitation symptoms months, others make quick recoveries.

What know moment, highly contagious delta variant becomes predominant strain circulating enter another covid surge, worried children ever been.

First foremost, high transmissibility delta variant translate greater number children exposed before, lead greater number children infected. Even delta variant virulent children original virus was, sheer numbers translate children admitted hospital covid covid-related illnesses. school reopenings coincide growth delta variant, worry see large outbreaks school settings see less-contagious versions virus.

I wonder, people saw see patient bedsides, would protect children? talked one mother wondered whether could done something prevent child ending sick hospital covid. recall providing emotional support - addition oxygen, steroids remdesivir - teenager admitted covid pneumonia grappling recent deaths multiple family members covid. life turned upside short weeks.

Over course pandemic, hospital system diagnosed 15,000 children adolescents covid - number trending up. 10 percent required hospital admission. one-third children admitted hospital required critical care - including oxygen delivered high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation intubation mechanical ventilation. discharge children hospital, know many long road recovery, many require follow-up cardiac clearance long-term care hospital's long-covid clinic. 300 children across United States died covid since beginning pandemic, according Centers Disease Control Prevention. children covid make complete recovery, 10 percent, including mild illness requiring hospital admission, go develop months-long symptoms long covid.

During previous covid surges, children's hospitals United States experienced low patient volumes compared prior years people seeking routine medical care elective procedures. could easily handle influx children covid also seeing much common viruses childhood, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) influenza, typically keep children's hospitals busy winter. previous surges, children's hospitals across country able serve pop-off valves adult hospitals overwhelmed covid admissions, many instances stepping admit provide direct clinical care adult patients, lending equipment adult hospitals.

What's different time children's hospitals also dealing unusual summertime surge respiratory viruses, including RSV, causes acute illness infants toddlers. hospitals seeing huge, sustained influx patients RSV - often need oxygen respiratory support - busier baseline times pandemic. worry children's hospitals handle covid surge top RSV surge, stress hospital systems staff.

Adding concerns pediatrician society dealing covid-fatigue. Children younger 12 remain ineligible vaccination, people tired following mitigation measures eager get back normal life. many eligible adults adolescents 12 years age remain unvaccinated. One important step families take protect children ages ensure eligible household members age 12 vaccinated; heartbreaking care children hospitalized covid know could prevented.

I often approached friends, family members neighbors facing difficult decisions also face pandemic parent: keep children safe? like remind past 18 months, we've gained experience knowledge developed tools recommendations help limit spread covid - based scientific evidence. Masking (including universal masking schools), physical distancing, testing, contact tracing, quarantining vaccinating help. abandon crucial tools now, putting children harm's way.

Downvoted so-called breakthrough infections occur vaccinated volunteers, produced mild symptoms 96 percent cases resulted severe disease death less 0.05 percent, study found. trial ran February May year. J&amp;J readily available every drug store US free you’re done one shot.

That true case got J&amp;J vaccine weeks ago, live burbs outside major city Midwest. .gov website lists vaccine locations says is, wasn't.

Educators know parents families pain ass developed coping skills. doesn’t sound like have. sure things get reported EU, USA everybody 18 lumped ""children"" bucket. terms reporting covid cases/hospitalizations/deaths, 20kg five year old morbidly obese 17 year old treated comes reporting statistics. think anyone seriously considered many states would go back stay-at-home orders (let alone real lockdown ala Wuhan even Italy) Spring 2020 unless something DRASTICALLY changed like new variant true double digit IFR something. yet, cases seen small bump deaths budged Still tiny blip compared previous ""spikes"". 50 hospitalizations per day vs 1500(start pandemic) ~375 latest wave.

Its trending even close similar cases.

Do think testing widespread enough January? number cases somewhat accurate/representative?

Because we're still looking good trends cases correlated hospitalizations deaths.

There many countries much higher rates vaccine hesitancy US, like Russia, ex-soviet bloc states, countries Africa. virus mutating inevitable, matter US does. 

I'm putting life pause anymore. unvaccinated never going follow type protocol, pick slack? Agreed; think people forced work home either (once safe go back). point people demonstrated ability work effectively 2 years home choice work productive them. Wonder health workers leave one state giving sign bonuses 30k originally read “16% 80% people didn’t detectable antibodies” fell flat floor.

That correct. read right. See yourself: r/nursing

This cited reason going back person classes state. number reported child abuses cases halved 2020-2021 school year teachers person interaction see &amp; report it. Yeah people forgetting . hospital doesn’t worry paying health insurance,unemployment insurance , vacation time, liability insurance, ect… they’re ones driving exponential spread. everyone vaxxed would surge. Period. may small pockets infection surge across country like we’re seeing now. say fault unvaccinated 100% correct. are. work airline. Working airline basic human right. Ever payed taxes cigarettes alcohol? punishments / compensations bad choices damage system causes. Also activities already covered infrastructure build years. Corona new additional burden system may able cover addition things covers.

Maybe better solution would exclude antivaxers health system (and include unvaccinated people receive vaccine due real medical reasons)? least point everyone possibility vaccination would fairest solution. think going happen live society way gentle let people deal consequences bad decisions. doesn’t conflict posted all. 

*While contagious, contagious.* 

But “while” shorter. Oh No! Anyway... Don’t give hope sad pay ultimate price well putting family followers anger misinformed belief. difficult understand someone high educational background get sucked these, end believe science, blatant evidence around you. 

RIP. honestly bandwidth time financial resources distance learning son school year. We're lucky live high vaccination rate county responded fairly well pandemic. distance learning last year, put summer program school needed interaction kids, general cases transmitted much end Spring. 

But school announced distance learning provided, independent study allowed families want, try sort sync-up independent study kids teacher.

What troubles 3 weeks summer program, kid caught cold. He's 2nd grade age, kids summer program careful cognizent mask wearing distancing, seem like program workers care. 

If go back full in-person learning, classrooms, already capacity, going address social distancing order help reduce chance transmissions? conducted way summer program is, ton kids going get covid-19. anymore, apparently hell getting downvoted? literally correct Autoimmune disease going cause mutation virus, ever claiming understand autoimmune diseases are. Autoimmune diseases condition body's immune system attacks itself. vaccine less effect can't get vaccine immuno-suppressant drugs control condition. people need rest us get vaccinated protect them.

The vaccine reduces chance infection, prevent though. fully vaccinated room hour two 9 people infected, likely catch too. thing recover faster, infectious less time lowers expected R value limits spread. expected R value 1, virus can't spread faster people get burn out. Keep mind R0 value instance person immunity all, soon people immune, lowers expected R value. people immune, lower value. critical get many people possible vaccinated lower R value much possible.

Keep mind R value means, number people 1 infected person spread highly dependent viral load. masks prevent infection, remove possibility infection, lower lowering viral load receive. Even N100 masks complete protection, stop 99.7% 0.3 micron particles, smallest coronavirus particle 0.125 microns. stop biggest particles highest viral loads give time. body actually heavy lifting ultra small particles since entirely without defenses. defenses overwhelmed happens get disease.

So example spitballing numbers here. Let's say N95 (which blocks 95% 0.3 micron particles) would let stay highly infectious environment hour got disease, N100 mask would let stay 16 hours got disease. mask would give 3 minutes got disease way comparison.

The vaccine thing. Except layer protection inside body primes immune system immediately recognize virus start fighting right away. Think like National Guard immune system. already trained fight need mobilize start offensive. Without vaccine, National Guard, rely draft induct soldiers, train fight, finally deploy combat, takes far longer simply National Guard standby. Sure war National Guard, much worse war since took long start respond crisis without one? fair, never said implied anything age hiring. 
What said type behavior employers like hiring NEW employees older. Someone 55+ find new job extreme disadvantage younger, middle aged candidates likelihood retirement missed work due health issues. Yes illegal US numerous reasons companies give pass 60 year old great experience.  me, yes, does. many, many people, yes, does. want go back life without rolling waves mask mandates perpetuity.I believe moot discussion point - POV we've witnessed, last 18 months, permanent rewiring human beings interact.The one thing let POV do, though, tell like it. days freedom cyclical returns masking forever over, statutory and/or social pressure excludes possibility seeing faces busy city streets large gatherings schools periods viral spread rest days, promise absolutely miserable crank make sure rest world knows it. may permanent never, ever okay.

My view won. little mask wearing depoliticization masks US. describing something temporary permanent, throwing toys pram wanted believe over, yet. stop wearing masks without signifiying over, put without signifying everything horrible again. umbrella. happens raining. weather keeps improving. Eventually put umbrella away long time, perhaps good. nice fond feelings humble, useful umbrella, even hate rain.

We've pandemic year half, improved immensely. pandemics go privileged position even countenance this. Imagine bitching position privilege majority world shot. Considering Methodist already went lost like...1% ENTIRE staff - many nurses, I'd say extremely negligible contribution labor shortage. 

Not mention Texas regulations place years mandate hospitals implement vaccine requirements staff. point question money anymore, though. someone completely burnt saying ""I'll give 50k raise stay"" change mental state much. They're fried, fast replace them.


Also good catch. Anytime time pay raise staffing levels, hero again.  Wait till find waste real vaccine. Nice see someone supports ""Do tell punished"" mentality government/companies.... stop show papers Please let satire.

The message might alright, delivery questionable, needs exit metric (e.g. vaccine percentage) expect people obey. Nah means he’s good god-fearing man. Unlike filthy papist Catholic Biden, he’s heretic. 

/s term ""break through"" part public perception problem. implies something broken fact everything working expected. I'm boat today. Probably feel lowest right since started. Well put. apparently back ""heroes"" eyes CEOs there's labor shortage. I'm starting sense pattern.

Talk pharmacist. Talk kids, hobbies, weather-- distract yourself.

When go lie down. Sad true. I've sometimes wondered thing, think general, we've done bad job framing numbers likelihood infected covid-19 given time.

From checking New York Times tracker, highest per capita rates I've seen worst surges somewhere around 140 cases per day per 100,000. That's 1 percent population per state per week. rate unsustainable long stretches time. current surge 100 cases per day per 100,000. Even assume 1 5 infections accounted for, rate continues entire month, somewhere around 85 percent population get covid-19 month, somewhat unrealistic numbers. Also, people change behavior get sick, people around get sick, there's surge.

It's also important keep mind 27 ICU beds per 100,000 people US well. multiple week stays, that's going add quickly, even rate something like 50 per 100,000 per day. Absolutely likely happened. Problem unvaccinated probably don’t insurance anyway.

Remember typically talking lower SES levels society… disproportionately poor, minority, uneducated. People probably aren’t carrying health insurance policies anyway. Hey healthy go f yourself. N-terminal domain lambda spike protein, responsible evasion neutralizing antibodies.” 

Haven’t variants like South African one able evade anti bodies lab studies still covered vaccination?  people low-zero symptoms even know covid... like, mild hangover seasonal allergies? Who's running get tested sniffel? don’t get it. It’s absolute insanity. Makes sense try justify it. WISH federal gov would step in.

Everyone working person whole damn time. Unfortunately half family willfully ignorant group. Wtf example? Last numbers saw 526 deaths minors 4.26 million positive tests. numbers, could possibly say 2 equal Hopefully would nice. mean… could be? don’t know would human worked ass year half battling this, watch population large- even worse fucking government- actively work you. I’m angry convinced partner trust him. people aren’t putting danger expecting care, they’re dragging others path. cheaper overall sign one-year Delta+ sub I’m thinking (pregnant third trimester), give pharmacy insurance third shot? Fucked around, found out.  depends understand ""prevent transmission"".

Does individually prevent transmission? Everything indicates cases (at least reducing number people infected potentially transmit it, possibly also reducing transmission even case breakthrough infections). definitely ""prevents transmissions"" (some them).

Does ""prevent transmission"" sense virus can't propagate vaccinated population? completely, maybe even sufficiently reach herd immunity even fully vaccinated population (though read anything indicating far).

TL;DR: clearly still effect transmission. prevents transmissions would otherwise occur stops spread. ""prevent transmission"" sense vaccination stops virus dead infections occur. even case earlier variants. anyone else played Prototype? completely understand frustration sadness. please say nothing. 
a. right thing, that's something proud simply it. share baby pass unselfishness him/her.
b. possibly saved older immunocompromised person sitting petrified, waiting vaccine. helping slow crap 2020, person vaccine. Anecdotal daughter covid February caught week ago. vaccine. change gets bout. really need federal law makes illegal states localities ban acting advice CDC good faith. friend never intended get vaccinated that's real truth Wait mutates brunch variant.  honestly cannot wrap head around this. U.S. health care effectively twice expensive OECD/G20 economies health care systems. money going??

Ugh feel like answered question. benefit probably makes places start mandating it, huge. earlier mandate better, carrots worked time bring big sticks. Yeah, France, Israel UK saying they're giving boosters vulnerable populations. basically data yet US holdout. 

The CDC delaying psychological reasons. think announcing boosters make anti-vaxxers dig harder getting vaccine. reality is, nothing going make change minds. Follow science. Smart people always knew boosters going happen. get yearly flu shots reason. give damn boosters. So, actually seems like going thing part US, exactly medical system collapsing mean, look like, implications future happens? son terrified needles. pleasant think needle smaller helped really feel it. Plus far injected worse. Experienced Nurses already know Bay Area great treat hospital staff This. Exactly this. Even important that, many staff qualified operate complex equipment around them. think focusing wrong question. correct question long covid going pandemic influences public health point serious threat. threat passed mask question answers itself. 99% preventable think might something Jehovah’s Witnesses? 

Not sure cater every fucking quack set beliefs, though. technically ""letting"" people get third dose know people who've managed get one. centralized database federally people cross state lines get one different state. Oath? oath? Tell common sense without telling common sense. think so. say seen heard allot frustrated conversations exactly this. Generally get shut quickly coming place complete exhaustion frustration conversation happening. reality staff walk. Oh yeah, I'll booster soon available. completely agree, I’m moving taxes responsibility upstream much possible - however simply don’t see happening US within next 2-3 decades. 

The government sides isle shown lack leadership make decisions beyond immediate year two completely incapable going corporate sponsor’s private interests. Except Peru use SinoVac. 95% Peru vaccination Pfizer, 5% AstraZeneca/SinoPHARM.

Stop trying cover racist comment inaccurate statement. thought virus discriminated generations.

WTF people???   FDA allows even emergency authorization still understand. FDA required trials, FDA read analyzed results, FDA issued permission everyone get vaccine. sure vaccinated. article would mention were. Yet, I'd gladly again. Ok. that's science is, cold filled stats. science says person education worth risk COVID that's AAP, CDC, secretary education recommend masks. Yes, CDC considered made determination kids need school risk posed covid children serious enough override need.  one point respected said something like ""i'm going hold people need get vaccinated."" bit care older/sicker people turned excuses followed excuses supply increased father law brilliant hilarious. I’d also love see study like that. Ideally come around get vaccine it’s kinda best continue help boost immunity. new benchmark good ideas anything DeSantis like. works theory offering $15,000 sign bonus. Honest question long mask usage gonna last... 
Yeah get breakthrough covid rather rare there's less chance transmission vaxxed compared wearing mask totally agree. kind people say they'd anything country. Except seems get vaccinated wear mask! ""Can't pay insurance any."" (Taps head) Bro, don’t think that’s related vaccine...I think you’ve got issues going on. Here’s idea, let’s fire ones don’t want get vaccinated. *crickets* Capitalism melting medical industry  I'm suggesting know people got J&amp;J waiting. find local pharmacies (don't chains) sign first dose Pfizer Moderna. Ted fled. Kinda similar happens ISPs. stay ISP initial ""agreement,"" boom 50%+ price increase. threaten go competitor suddenly magically able give new customer discount. “We can’t possibly pay nurses techs more. Think lifesaving c-suite administrators, HR, billing reps, insurance goons need make seven figures!” vaccine ever 100% participation though. Glad one who. medic also told unlimited hours, yet keeps getting hours cut. he’s allowed work 36hour weeks. crap There's good news. I've read separate articles new vaccines developed use needle.

First, seems bit clear statement kids are, average, safe severe disease, in-person schooling safe even virus spreads schools.

Haven't though? person schooling safe even virus spreads that's incredibly dangerous thing say. Sure, maybe student get incredibly sick die, disease spread many family members, faculty, community members ""even if"" virus spreads schools. seems like incredibly dangerous stupid thing say. recommend distance “learning” again, acknowledging going costs decades come.

This spoken like politician trying force in-class learning. like put quotes around ""learning"" mock fact kids learning outside school. reality is, proper system place clear message, learning home take place. take extra effort organization early members community though... something difficult tons poor political leaders misinformation promoted prominent figures society news. poisoning well seemingly mocking home schooling expressing concern ""costs decades come."" cost lost family members illness throw kids back school delta variant gaining steam?? seem concerned cost. mandate, parents vaccinate kids based original data set starting September.

Honestly, statement really make sense. implying here? Mandate bad thing? Well, first all, can't mandate allow vaccine children exist. Obviously worked I'm sure allow one used one created. Also, problems this... eligible vaccine, many parents refuse children vaccinated (due misinformation conspiracy theories). So, then? ALLOW kids parents still send kids school, thus creating situation now? complicated issue... 


So again, seem pushing classic, dangerous viewpoint ""IN-SCHOOL: GOOD, OUT-SCHOOL: BAD"" mentality potentially prematurely places students, faculty, staff incredibly dangerous situation. Literally teach classes students 35 teenagers... way properly social distance setting. incredibly complicated issue really want protect members community decrease spread Delta variant, need better solutions in-depth thoughtfulness people like you. Online learning, potentially ideal, much better alternative. HWHAT? history proven vaccines work? reason small pox, measles, polio etc. Flu shots yearly norm. 

What makes different? They're waiting full approval Don’t hospitals already mandate vaccines workers like flu shot? vocally that?  cluster. republican, thoughtful good way. Pay. More. Money. please learn basic molecular biology. vaccines change fucking DNA. ability fda clearance that, we'd lot closer cure cancer today.

The biggest hurdle trying get stay calm relaxed. knowledge, first time really “didn’t feel good” really emotionally wound up. isn’t true children. odds dying car accident much higher dying covid. 

I found 2008 cause childhood death report (outdated sure directionally correct) almost 8,000 kids dying transportation related deaths year 6,000 motor vehicle related. hundred kids died covid US. external causes death kids likely covid include drowning, fire/burns, poisoning suffocation. Yet amount worry people put causes death kids appears much lower covid. people bad understanding managing risk. covid extremely serious adults, especially older adults, people inappropriately transferred risk onto children. 

Yes, poor health outcomes besides death true diseases affect children well parent ever got worked about. 

Of course it’s better kid get covid. I’m reading parents won’t take kid public indoor spaces like libraries whatnot, think madness. People making miserable potentially damaging child’s development manage risk undeserving extreme measures. Unfortunately even think antivaxxers completely responsible.

You seem trouble understanding estimating risk.

 
600,000 Americans died Covid year.   
35,000 died vehicle crashes time period. Dem governor doubt it. sad. think we’ve become desensitized death long lives before. 

If mass shooting killed 500 children, one would say, “eh, it’s many kids.” 500 families lost child! Shots meth burn surprising amount fat ride several months. Mine doesn’t stop talking long enough let ever let forget. 

I joke, seriously, parent hasn’t thinking 18 months now? Pay house ill get it. long term plan help people medically can’t get vaccines? Without sweeping vaccine mandates we’re going hit herd immunity vaccination current rate vaccinations. People medically can’t get vaccine might face Covid decades. Well people don’t realize true power vaccine. prevent getting really sick( cases) thoses breakthrough infections know didn’t result anything bad think estimated 60k visitors came weekend (4th July). Obviously everyone exposed virus first instance, numbers could show vaccine highly effective given number folks w infections relative overall number.  mean, 1000 covid positives Lollapolloza—with 300,000 attending-a media spin bad thing opposite may true (I.e. proof efficacy vaccination)  Many Americans health insurance anyways 🤷.

Problem subjectivity inherent ""serious threat"".

If serious threat high IFR among elderly, anyone would've pointed (first foremost) last year, vaccines absolute game changer.

If lack pediatric vaccine serious threat that's left, expect change within 6 months.

After that, though, it'll still technically true know long term consequences non-severe cases. serious enough threat ensure cycles mandatory masking return seasonal ebb flow virus ""long term"" occurred?

My expectation stage, seen ""vaccines ticket back normal"" sputter crash, very, long future cyclical returns masking ahead us. need too. Unfortunately play rusty nails.

Edit: got Pfizer's months ago  Well, people soft symptoms least, right? Ok, makes sense, stories people autoimmune systems causing mutations? really trying wrap head around information. would make different stating? mutation going happen anyway? Also, doesn’t still pose issue even 70%-80% vaccinated percentage still become infected, doesn’t provide host replication mutations? Maybe get science lesson Reddit.🤣🤣   Even worse, parents lawyers. asked well ignorance bliss  got cookies? got bags popcorn. cheapest fucking snack get. Management came around floors passing out, wanted throw overpaid faces.  unvaccinated essentially Petri dish allows thrive thus continue mutating. room full flies, people fly swatted get rid faster. They'll control time. go right way managable. UK restrictions R number dropping another commenter mentioned, okay agree masks effective preventing viral spread, may necessary now, also find uncomfortable long-term practice desire concrete end metric. mum needle phobia got two fillings done without anasthetic result.

It's problem! another airline cater unvaccinated? Yes, smoking, drinking, exercise, eating meat (global warming!): going forbid things too, contribute ‘system’?

What billions made, funded research vaccines, freakin’ tax evasion? contributing system? thing contributing vaccinated shareholders Pfizer friends. serious?

If vaccinated contagious unvaccinated, GROUNDS MANDATING VACCINATION.

Wake F up, already! skill bottleneck (something takes lot time learn job), hiring woes likely problem job conditions much pays.

If restaurant owner can't find anyone hire waiter/waitress, chances they're paying enough. people nearby could use job handle waiting tables. restaurants quit scammy ""pay less minimum wage expect make rest tips"" thing, maybe people would interested job.

And nobody wants drive bus full unmasked children middle pandemic, maybe would good idea make kids put masks on.

It's like unskilled labor disappeared. There's pretty much number people there's always been. people starting say ""no"" certain jobs, businesses compete attract unskilled labor instead offering bare minimum legally get away with.

And that's good thing. People unskilled labor deserve safe working conditions make living wage, even means pay little goods/services get employers.

Schools definitely authority include mask requirement dress code. way religious whackos withhold prudent medical care children are. Can't disagree. mandates addition yailylu said percent vaccinated individuals total number positives close meaningless number without baseline vaccination rate people attended events (which necessarily vaccination rate whole MA). It’s like saying 75% MLB players right handed without mentioning 85 90% general population is. 

Headlines like least partly trying generate clicks people without math skills account base rate fallacies. Lucky. right eligible vaccine still 85%. 

I 0% taste smell week. Well that's good news then. least nurse staff able pay electric Bill's vaccine ever 100% participation though.

That' given, missing point.

People always kind irritated lot vaxxed people still get Covid. normal statistical point view higher participation gets, greater proportion vaxxed people taht get Covid gets. Oh man whole thing Turing shit show would larger percentage patients realize. SE Asia relies heavily Sinovac, Lambda eventually arrives there, bad news them. couldn’t believe either. knew idiots selfish didn’t think would go house sick COVID. can’t wrap head around it, next time someone tells they’re mandates everyone take personal responsibility I’m going use assholes example that’s working. People aren’t right thing. Ew I’m still mad. Tbf, even bungled it, never going open peak cold-and-flu winter. Summer would always go, *hope* open then, hope we're last so.

The alternative implies others since closed, really nice scenario think about.

At current rates, adults vaccinated Christmas, rates increasing every day - plus sizable increases mRNA deliveries Oct (10mn/mo). Maybe best name hospital Dropped toxin years ago. outlook begins improve immediately. like everyone fucking everywhere (including CDC, WHO, everyone bloody message board) completely given concept informing news facts, gone completely ""control""

It's giving people truth situation, telling people parts truth ensure act way want act. want people buy masks? Say masks work (even do). Want people take vaccines? report news shows exceedingly effective vaccines are, including using misleading statistics control.

And anyone goes nuts here, vaccinated, support vaccinations, support vaccine passports, believe anyone vaccinated right selfish. I'm nurses hospital staff getting paid more, let's honest, America; top healthcare still get profits opposed losses. simply trickle consumer/patient lead even astronomical costs healthcare. think Delta variants may short lived terms pandemic? scientists intrigued graph countries mentioned. worship Nurgle something?  Tell talk doctor, stay facebook. Unfollow everyone. way literally nothing shows news feed. Takes 30-45 minutes mental health improve. still use features message people WANT. Well, Texans sure continue vote cycle disease. no. spelled like several times different comments assume administration buying properties Italy staff. 

I'll take that, mine cold pizza. Fever chills muscle aches sounds way worse covid last year. fucking miserable two weeks extreme sinisutis fairly consistent 94% blood oxygen level. I'm thankful fever muscle aches top that. I'm pretty surprised symptoms seem common vaccinated people. personal experience. Mine much different.

You get put anywhere near Covid ward getting cortisone shot. get emails offers every day. tempting. Honestly, bunch anecdotes liars. pay attention kind stuff-just look actual studies published science. 40s friends 30s-50s reports anything like that. mention hospital looks like 5 star hotel. Chandeliers statues waterfalls. joke benefit health insurer directly, benefit government's budget. government subsidies obese people would way balance out.

Regarding second study, common flaw including impact lifespan healthcare costs. study linked one aware actually factors lifespan. great funeral director Texas Florida. 

I smell profit!   teeth look fine. get dental work done? That's need federal mandate since states already ban like Florida implementation claim vaccinated people getting infected likely lead vaccine resistant mutation 100% false

Oh well, read orginal text like that, see it.

Thanks explaining polite. mutation would happen whether got vaccine not. Mutation rate immutable, selection pressure might favor variant always. anything selection pressure going favor transmissible variant evasive. example there's variant affected vaccine R0 18, would favorable spread variant affected vaccine R0 2. I'll give that's extreme example somewhat see simple X Y. Peru Southeast Asia... 18 breakthrough cases (.32% fully vaxxed employees) work know - mild symptoms. frustrating norm.

And honestly particular area I'm retail masks whole entire time. Anybody retail store 10 people tell one person gets cold whole store gets cold last year one single person got flu cold sinus infection anything else people prone including tell masks work. Ridiculous anyone know they're going verify this. live heavily conservative area heard anecdotally doctors willing give employees falsified vaccine cards.

Luckily able talk doctor day reassured unikely caused vaccine went second shot next day. I'm still lot irregularities, like near constant spotting, one large clot. article little reassuring.

Expect surge similar announcements month. Thanks. re-read email says artists require everyone vaccinated show negative Covid test. “Can” operative word. Hopefully offer artists option out. gone two years without eye exam, spring one lulls went. today two year point i'd either go day i'd wait month Delta variant going put lot vintage bikes market guess, that's that's positive. already plans move Covid pushed back, soon it’s relatively safe I’m leaving state looking back. missing something? 

The state pay private school tuition students anti-mask households?

The children idiots refuse wear masks rewarded superior education cost them?

It appears though DeSantis really wants punish mask wearers.

Wow. say stop calling vaccine? Normally flu shot called flu shot.

just call shots cause think funny know 2 people got fully vaccinated getting covid. one mild symptoms mild symptoms. odds one person know small get shots. 2 people know getting? Plus know many people got shot got sick. heck dad went icu cause second shot. Flu shots always get sick mean always vaccines got younger never thing me. family said. Polio shot doesnt make stop walking week etc. Im saying know vaccine sounds good im saying maybe call shots something else. United: Maybe wanna bad guy anymore. Thanks report. Personally witnessed vaccine indeed helped two elderly friends infected, die thankfully. Calling approach 'hands-off' insult anyone brain. He's meddling every level government. might well line people wall shoot them. know justification vaccinating 12s, honestly. Probably waiting results trials. point company i'd require negative covid test everyone returning work, someone claiming specific sickness doctor writing excuse note clear covid.

that said, people try cheat system exists i'm sure make perfect Don’t Fauci Florida baby! doubt much motorcycle rally. Midwest similar trend last year. can't believe downvoted. hate sub. completely right, let nature take course. lol truth. 6 year amazing using Microsoft Teams. Funny people without kids love preach raise kids. critical point appears side-stepped, I'm argue overall safety vaccine. Let's break though. According US Fire Administration, 171,500 highway vehicle fires US. concludes annual average 345 deaths. 0.2% likely die event highway fire, indeed unjustified fear. 

There 601,000 deaths COVID US, 18-29 year olds accounting 2,470 deaths. break percentages, make 0.4% deaths COVID. That's accounting fact difficult find data making distinction individuals underlining health conditions would categorize medium high risk. job required stuck tube random strangers day, would getting every vaccination there. fuuck governor says problem  hosted vaccine clinic Wednesday partnership local medical group, 42 people (mostly kids men). told us best numbers they'd months. somewhat heartening. large UK study control group find 10% risk particular figures 3 &amp; 4.

The 5% result mentally averaging 10% studies finding lower risk commenter linked Nature article. Buckle go... Chris Cuomo fired last year playing buddy-buddy ""hero"" brother NY gov throwing covid positive patients retirement homes. main reason NY highest death rate long.

But brother's getting comeuppance ""recuse"" himself. Fuck report brother pack bags cause capable job. Boosters could elevate immune response without implying lack booster means existing response get worse time. fools still argue there's enough sick kids hospital wear mask around others. I'm vaccinated think really unvaccinated live fear. can't. got JJ can't get booster shot unless CDC says so. West Taiwan totally transparent nothing hide ..... Great require passengers Sounds like vaccine jack shit you.

I covid unvaxxed barely anything me. People started taking precautions 2nd wave wer hardly going also local lockdowns. back normal, masking also gone down..... India.

 know atleast 7 deaths happened due covid wer reported covid. town area only. Imagine scale unreported covid deaths.

Yet still hospitals filling up. Like, know, 11-month-old flown Houston hospital full *in thread posting in.* feel like anti-vax argument, discussed far. work currently. vaccine elementary kids. right whether kid attend school mask mandate. made individual basis right? kid risk, keep home online learning. You’re saying keep home kids maybe risk? Trying understand so. keep 16 year old driving there’s risk killing someone road?

The vaccine part interesting comes kids. Flu vaccine mandatory attend school flu cases severe younger age. 

There’s many counter arguments made mobile app discussion 😂 Get 3m respirator. p100 disks,

The problem masks exhale always gap otherwise usually gap around nose. inhale right after. hardly work. issue vaccinated people clustered certain areas, areas 30% vaccination rate. 

Truly pandemic unvaccinated.  They've opened 16 17 year olds now. daughter (17) first today. glad going back college September!  I’ve already noticed cafe job less busy. hope I’m wrong, I’m hearing footsteps, footsteps major closures. Thank you! freedom food!  article mention China, Vietnam matter. Same. Bonus - also AZ part US clinical trial back December/January subsequently got J&amp;J needed proof vaccination grad school. Lol oh man. Facebook needs way turn commenting think anything political COVID related. Well, tell work lab, healthcare all, hopefully.

Outside healthcare, expect much beyond personnel interact with: phlebs, RNs drs. problem scope practice. Phlebs often identify ""lab"" lot people take mean perform testing, qualified, means can't answer questions often asked - often, give wrong answer patient.

Anyways, knowing what's lab huge component quality care. Expecting something beyond someone's scope practice leads bad outcomes. Also, recruitment thing. Kids school hear anything besides nurse doctor, staffing crisis even covid shows that. need qualified professionals perform clinical lab tests.

To put together, case point:

I'm 2017, cms (?) going change rules allow nurses perform interpret lab tests. terrible idea. RNs training highly specialized knowledge - MLS does. Thankfully, changed course due rather extensive advocacy work letter writing campaign, fantastic example people knowing laboratory scientist training require nearly ruined healthcare know it, that's hyperbole.

Sure, people know lab = test. nobody knows goes that, moving parts training need various roles.

That's also issue pay job duties. I've met many hospital admins clue particular degree, go intense internship, pass board exams. One talking said know people tests randos high school diploma - toured lab explained saw different things going on.

So, self centered? slightest. Interested quality outcomes patients, see pieces of? Extremely. Listen, provided data performance, not. I'm aware perfect education system covid, data shows online learning made performance worse aggregate. heard somewhere 50% fully vaccinated, 70% least first shot. 

No idea information legit hopeful things pick up, means vaccines natural immunity work completely screwed like beginning pandemic strain spreads even better. highly unlikely happen.

My real concern right return school. Yes, far kids hit covid badly, Houston's children's hospitals capacity that's bit concerning. Yes, masks, vaccines still bit way. worst case scenario we'll endure another semester remote work vaccines available smaller kids well. wiped nothing worse flus colds they’ve gotten

So like covid infection unvaccinated people? Pretty sure takes saying “this religion” could wrong.

Someone would likely prove they’re practicing member religion period time became “convenient” otherwise whole thing would fall apart could flip flop preferred religion whenever needed to. Lol. problem people realize using way regardless... They're blending ""irrespective"" regardless"" say regardless anyway clerk probably going get fired I'd like thank taking one team. Good Job *thumbs up* sounds like shingles. Rarely people get shingles like reaction vaccine covid. Happened Dad. Got worse worse. go doctor. recommend fool around. Get qualified medical help asap. First there's lot choice wrestle life comes us.

But idea vaccine escape myth perpetuated ignore spike still fits human ACE2 really can't change much mRNA vacines target.

There course DISEASES pandemic potential enter via ACE2, there's fair likelihood hit nasty strain one sooner later. point put masks on, tune cra k new mRNA vaccine that.

Chances are, future yearly immunization ready go cautious footing masks reduced gathering something lovally trending, extreme cases globally get vaccine out.

It's disease that's making life miserable, unprepared react quickly, still spending energy politicizing actual responding it. Imagine literal blood hands defend completely abstract notion ""freedom,"" double blows face.

This democracy, elected job, fucking it. constituents dieing.

Living society inherently means things one another, DeSantis' view sort requirement somehow totalitarian shit fucking freedom colored anarchy. Fuck speed limits we're too, government tell side street drive on? get state voucher private school

“Florida students allowed use state-backed vouchers transfer private schools object wearing masks classrooms” think that's understandable position take personally, society; can't let children's hospitals fill lots children may needlessly die sorts treatable illnesses injuries, covid. problem covid start, Delta transmissible children, big, big problem children. said change needed protect children 12 can’t get vaccinated state’s virus cases hospitalizations skyrocket

Actually no, spreading boomer garbage. first vaccine people taken last, take vaccine get it, easy scientist didn’t read article, guess based increase vaccinations lately cause decline cases especially serious ones death, take couple months effectiveness fully kick in. Meanwhile, masking, two things allow upward trend continue while.

The good news vax mask requirements starting happen, hopefully trend continue well. still I'd love know one avoid mean, looks it, lot. truth dont know. told story, believe it. I'm sure im one.  think thing don’t get all: folks around extremely sanguine costs remote learning.

It seems like common sense removing kids key socialization event childhood could bad kids. lots data point suggesting case.

And yet, folks Reddit seem knee-jerk reaction minimize costs remote learning. odd Texas, governor banned mandates executive Sorry I'm fucks give. CDC estimate 1 20 vivid infections require hospitalization. Vaccination 90% effective preventing hospitalization. Get vaccinated. think going happen now?

However, maybe feeling shame take closer look they're feeling way. eligible vaccine, get either stubbornness, ignorance, stupidity. would still polio smallpox way. Always wear mask social distancing outside house can, it'll help reduce viral load receive. would helpful everyone wore masks still every little bit may help. act like vaccinated take precautions based that, can't hurt anymore otherwise. might still catch it, done everything go complete isolation. actually performed better Delta Beta... efficacy slightly outmatched recorded beta variant, initially detected South Africa late last year. Together, levels protection also mirrored reported clinical trials vaccine authorized U.S. past protection good beta delta variants,” Dr. Glenda Gray, project co-leader president CEO South African Medical Research Council. “We showed it’s 67% protection beta dominates 71% protection Delta dominates.” Even lawyers misinformation. Multiple studies looking specifically infection risk found much, much higher 50% protection. Even delta 60-65% looks protection infection, symptoms. asymptomatic contagious - presymptomatic spread people soon become symptomatic real, people incorrectly assumed truly asymptomatic people highly contagious too. Spirit She’s idiot think memorization maybe thing lol Yep. Hate suffered but, play stupid games…. Completely agree. That's family using N95 KN95 mask since spring 2020. sometimes hard come easily available today. None us become sick.

I bought couple hundred preparation fall. good point! agree part. Although also think governments facilitate development [auxiliaries back plan, vaccinated unvaccinated get sick new variant waning immunity unpredictable shit. putting eggs one basket? going risk peoples lives already choosing citizen period. Maybe fired bunch refusing vaccine? good option many. Iust preference force onto others. White. Trasy negotiate. Walk pony loot.  simple cloth mask really effective thats used before

 - also know even mask effective air filter works ways compared cloth mask - know need worry edges mask - they're exposed open air - possibly letting virus.. counteract problem? Use stuff like duct tape sealing around edges. *Alternatively put rubber seal around edges see makes good seal.

- secondly wear swimming goggles, swimming goggles protects eyes I've heard apparently eyes entry point virus.

*Or maybe better fix compared mask swimming goggles deal mask goggle problems (ie worry mask, duct tape, rubber seal sealing correctly) -would simply get one 'full face swimming masks' cover end snorkel mask something like HEPA filter applying duct tape seal HEPA end - use method fixate plastic snorkel so.

-By way want inform experimental antiviral called 'DRACO' may protect viruses; covid, flu, common cold - etc. around apparently years already, ie I've seen news article 2011. apparently similar antiviral called 'VTose' well. Basically works unlike antibodies instead detects whether cell shows signs infected set destroy said cell. antibodies worry covering entirety virus spot gets missed due chance, concentrated effective antibodies - virus entirely covered antibody substance may still infect -- imagine take something like DRACO regular vaccine, antibodies first line defense, virus make DRACO sitting inside cell case - set splice onto virus infection code set self destruct cell. Let repeat again: outbreak happened Bear Week. Thousands men, many preexisting health conditions, barely sleeping, sweating breathing other, swapping spit, kinds higher risk activities people would never dream doing. outbreak troubling, sure, many others said, given environment, vaccine passed flying colors.

If Bear Week would happened without vaccines, HUNDREDS would hospitalized dead….the CDC media need emphasize million times day! definitely since 35% public fucking stupid really can't saved point. less Earth, better. best looking health one thing.

Earth talking about? person stating school mask mandate. 18 months person children wear masks everywhere keep safe. delta variant contagious chicken pox.

I feel like really need go work school, new wave also bringing us breaking point. sacrificed much avoid covid, year half later. guess people fear precedent would set. works? understanding nothing happens don’t forego shot make sure gets needy elderly person third world country? everyone else does: take available them.   Fucking it. Suburbia entire separate issue, I'll leave out.

But urban / rural divide always difficult one me. Particularly clear cut statements people often like make ""cities drive economy"" ""cities make much gdp per capita"" etc.

The problem this, opinion, lot difference GDP comes three factors:

1) Artificially different labor values different areas.

2) Artificial different values put different parts supply chain.

3) Concentration income wealth top.

For example, going three.

1) One reason GDP nominally higher cities people generally get paid higher citiesto account higher costs living. can't speak exact situation US, one extremely stark example London UK jobs touching public sector. amounts something like 15% higher salaries people job inside London, compared outside it, make higher cost living. primary school teacher might make equivalent $50,000 outside London, $58,000 inside London. course, enough people paid higher, knock effect. Higher wages = people pay houses = bid higher buy houses = housing rent prices go = higher cost living.

I'm sure lot examples similar wage scaling inside vs outside cities.

Overall ends bit circular argument. higher wages higher cost living, inherently higher productivity people city vs outside. higher wages general mean people shops restaurants need paid more, pushes cost living itself, reinforcing cycle. Artificially inflates apparent GDP cities dollar value, even ""real"" productivity difference.

2) Society makes choices part supply chain products valuable. Say farmer growing wheat destined make pasta fancy restaurant big city. I'd get small payoff growing wheat. mill grinding wheat packaging flour would get bit larger payoff. Chef making pasta would get even larger payoff. Going chain, last two steps involve people cities, *decided* valuable. whose jobs would absolutely function first step (growing wheat) done. one could argue thwt steps chain actually relatively equal importance. sort difference, arising choice society made, serve accentuate aparent differences rural urban wealth / income / GDP.

3) general terms, capitalist society, wealth continually concentrates upwards. big corporation might thousands branches small rural towns, profit would funnel upwards head office, head office alloted disproportionately lqrge share proceeds. Since head offices generally located big cities, drives aparent wealth / income cities compared rural areas, even real productive work done outside cities.


Overall, really cautious making sharp lines claiming cities productive/ drivers countries wealth, rural areas unimportant deserve downtrodden areas lesser public services result. 

The truth cities absolutely require work rural areas function. large part artificial valuations society created causes cities GDP much higher 5han rural areas. absolutely nobody would gain letting rural areas collapse; would hurt everybody country. Ah hello fellow Texan :-( try much like strawman make seem like I'm saying DO's incompetent witchdoctors. That's I'm saying all. acknowledged *several times now* DO's get MD training. want continue pretend I'm ignoring fact suppose can't stop you.

As facile points question emergency would question basic medical procedures like blood pressure test, clearly that's case.

At risk sanctimonious internet rando call ""insane"" (ouch, ever going get sleep tonight?!) I'll try thousandth time get point across:

It's pretty incoherent people sub pouring latest research studies daily basis wag fingers science-denying anti-vaxers simultaneously defending osteopathy non-science-based practices many DO's perform. endemic, nothing stopped. Mutations gonna come one way another. delta. I've said til I'm blue face people grasp concept.

I wonder non-sterilizing-immunity vaccines, coupled major CDC fumble ""fully vaccinated people wear mask"" results actually selecting robust variants? Like taking full course antibiotics leads emergence antibiotic resistant strains. FYI, report anonymously CPS neglect big impact mandates common person. allows public universities like UC system example, mandate vaccines in-person learning company calls 'return work'. keep pointing we've working fine. drives home boomer senior management, office == work. think they're special 4 billion doses vaccine given worldwide companies still want experiment *them*. ""I thunk dun got frum mu ~~sister~~ wife"" Yes, denying third shot give shot third world country point?
Seems plenty shots missing something?
I don’t think shots hoarded wrong? still get exemptions religious reasons otherwise? adjusts $208-260k year... Pretty sure that's many doctors make! children 12 years old can't vaccinated. live state banned mask mandates schools. 

Almost one kids' classes wear masks. metro area dozen school outbreaks, school started. concerned myself, concerned children. I'm sure meant 'inevitably' made profound statement... good chunk population younger 13.

Doesn't solve problem maybe quite bleak? Missing bigger picture might actually save lives entire staff vaccinated, even staff smaller.  this? What's operating number? would great ISDs ""forbidden"" mask mandates thanks Greg Abbott?  wonder overlap people ones wont take vaccine ""they care goes body"" vaccinated

I also want know this. sub seems focused notion pre-symptomatic vaccinated people cannot transmit, I'm seeing mixed messages this. authoritative info somewhere?  vaccination issue Australia related supply? thought AZ jabs going unused there? Libertarians can't nice things. get shot. probably another massive lockdown, ultimately market dictated people's emotions behavior. Even one lockdown right place right time could trigger events slide. No, comment didn’t insinuate all, it’s clear, right black white. comment made distinction difference variants, although breakthrough case first place order transmission occur, reproduction rate high Chicken Pox (the R0 closer 2-2.5 toward beginning pandemic, it’s estimated closer 7-9), even low percentage breakthrough cases, amount infection, breakthrough cases, 50% population vaccinated first place (in us) lead spread exponent 7-9, therefore increasing risk breakthrough infections. clear, I’ve vaccine, I’m pro vaccine, I’m discouraging anyone saying vaccine helpless, getting vaccinated masking/distancing things get us herd immunity, I’m saying need even careful new variant, let guard simply vaccinated, delta variant proving danger, don’t want see next variant may hold. “Our vaccines working exceptionally well,” Walensky told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “They continue work well Delta, regard severe illness death – prevent it. can’t anymore prevent transmission.”

That's bizarre thing say day also CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky: “Here’s tell American parents: best way protect children can’t get vaccinated yet Delta get vaccinated can't wrap head around true time, unless talking protecting kids non-delta covid. would odd way make distinction. I’m year (Phase III Trials) I’m pretty confident need one. Mainline shit me. Give vaccines, don’t hold back. got Pfizer-Biontech mRNA booster yesterday, supplement Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine got April.

In Germany, boosters offered starting September people got vector vaccines (Oxford-AstraZeneca Janssen / J&amp;J), places (like San Francisco) people (like Dr. Angela Rasmussen Dr. Vin Gupta) recommending well.

Seems like reasonable way play safe.  US sent 100 million doses countries, donations, meaning literally footing bill them. like sitting them.

Right bigger problem figure vaccine demand, rising south. US hospitals overwhelmed multiple states now, like afford stop vaccinating demand increasing. literally hospitals without oxygen supplies can't move supplies fast enough keep patients. Without making direct comparison cases deaths, things stand out.

18 months later hotel quarantine better March 2020. People lost tens thousands dollars cancelled flights alone direct result Australia’s refusal implement federal quarantine system adequate space.

You can’t leave country without permission, even plans coming back.

I imagine it’s pretty hard plan life lockdowns always looming. Lockdowns don’t seem effective Delta. 

As someone already mentioned, doesn’t seem like Australia exit strategy. say it’s 80 percent population vaccinated… well, look around world, might possible, especially lack natural immunity.

If another, similar, pandemic occurred ten years, would want Australia handle way? Hahaha counties US would love numbers Unfortunately large part anti masker, anti vaccines crowd believe kids can’t don’t get sick this. amount sick kids end September heartbreaking. blaming wrong thing though. Mask mandates blame. government offering meaningful financial support struggling businesses populace right thing get vaccinated culprits. blaming mask mandates again: *these businesses open compromise*. Right now, delta spreading like wild many areas country under-vaccinated, safest thing would close types businesses. fact even still go bars clubs privilege, treating face exposed like unalienable right. Based communication I've seen, think company planning thing minute EUA lifted, suspect many companies well. 

The FDA needs get final approval completed soon possible.  thing become cluster fuck trying read tea leaves making sure reading quotes closely it’s become extremely frustrating driving confusion. CDC can’t even get right wording hurting helping. It’s caused almost become numb “reports” wording. [Maybe dont die people ""young healthy"" group getting long term damage death covid vaccines. argument there. one? saw least FSU posted something along lines instagram acct last week Personally, I'm curious Australia actually stick exit strategy push comes shove. current variants, seems like 80% vaccination nearly completely naïve (practically prior infections populace) population seems unlikely result herd immunity. Australia really going able turn switch go rising infections causing lockdowns enforced military completely hands-off approach 2022 infections rise? 

I'm also curious Australia even hit 80% vaccinated. I’ve read guys huge issue older populations also refusing AZ holding Pfizer fucking rollout. It’s sucks lot data/guidelines common symptoms break thru infections people fully vaccinated Pfizer shot?

Not looking direct medical advice course I've got low grade fever literally symptoms. Super weird feeling I've never experienced before. think majority Iceland's breakthrough cases reported people got J&amp;J. good news people, matter vaccine got, getting sick. Huh, interesting. bunch mild heart stuff go COVID first wave hit (abnormal ekg later revealed pretty benign electrical thing.) echocardiogram showed “small calcified mass” scared shit me.

When finally able get Cardiac MRI (doc advised said wasn’t serious enough warrant hospital exposure) showed calcified scar tissue consistent past myocarditis.

I surprised. Asked could asymptomatic covid. Doc said no, something many years prior.  Awesome! Hoping African countries luck months due vaxx donations. Town next mine sent ridiculous amount alerts missing child once. We're talking getting 3-4 day 2 weeks. Mine turned now. theres significant overlap people champion fat acceptance people think healthy also obese. 

even technical differences, crossover. one descriminated bullied look (im extremely thin people make comments too, sucks). also know weight isnt healthy, think needs larger focus highlighting although dont need feel guilty over/under weight, comes sometimes severe health comsequences, one content overweight. overweight trying fix it. whether 15 pounds 150. go anywhere say need 2nd shot - theyll give you.  wondering, people sue company state (like california) something like this? That's callous. What's callous amount people ignoring reality current situation want deal personal responsibility mitigate take care communities! wish fewer people burying heads sand maybe shit position finding AGAIN! majority unvaccinated people get need hospital. So... don’t think guys joke feel frustrated all. feel frustrated sad every country point. It’s clear we’re shit situation together. Australia happens shit situation enough vaccines enough natural immunity y’all playing tough balancing act may depend area, I'm moderate living conservative area 99% people I've talked getting vaccine conservative media talking points. plenty conservatives gotten vaccine well, point also make population refusing vaccine, least area experience. Exactly. States apparently system set deal surplus. mean, look doses expired Arkansas.  shipped people desperate them. went trash.

So might well use boosters. Cool, deal insufficient people address healthcare needs guess? pretty darn clear Israel, particularly elderly. So....it become increasingly clear everywhere else well ... Yeah definitely think lack vaccine access developing world probably blame anything listed. think employees filing OSHA.. employees refusing work covid lack mask/vaccine mandates cant retaliate workplace. eventhough employ many pilots flight attendants, many could sitting home, getting paid refusing work unless safer work environment AA cant retaliate.. Yeah guys morbidly obese. young age too. Thats huge risk factor beside old age itself. That's shit-ton people. actually miracle 500 cases reported. Right what’s best vaccinated… No, .002 fully vaccinated died. still less likely get covid fully vaccinated, accounting less 6% cases. much slimmer chance dying vaccinated dying unvaccinated Maybe US stop hoarding vaccines Mine started thought sinus infection A/C unit something. it’s mostly bad sinus infection whole time. fever, cough. fatigue. headache sinus pressure

My wife hand believe infected fever Tuesday, mild cough, headache, said eyes hurt abc lost sense smell &amp; taste. 

My 7 year old light sinus symptoms maybe tiny cough. 

My 9 month old sniffles sneezing. 


Overall mild. Though sinus infection suck. 

One weird note.. took 2 rapid tests (one antigen test) 9 days exposure negative Covid antigen test showed positive Flu B. took PCR test Wednesday showed positive. think rapid tests right contagious symptomatic Yes. Thanks clarification. hate fellow healthcare workers treated overworked. Again. Even unvax people test positive require hospital... Sooo words precious national resource? people seem think covid need vaccinated all.

Last time checked chickenpox measles get can't get get definitely get covid once.

And would say doenst mean 2nd time get less symptoms asymptomatic.

Had covid Nov 2020 fully vaxed today. 

Yet apparently doctor wrong telling get vaccinated according redditor covid vaccinated sub used informative seems ot filling anti vaxers well. Commas, do, they, work? please stop *this* misinformation Round round go!  Texas like ""masks discouraged."" 


Teachers, coaches staff wearing them.  


Source: went assembly yesterday one small handful people wearing mask. everyone tests positive needs hospital even unvaccinated. fact majority people test positive need medical assistance. zero proof vax kept hospital.

All government saying reduces symptoms. impossible prove considering unvaccinated people display whole range asymptomatic death. people vaccinated required hospitals even died, again. way prove vaccine helps all. San Francisco administering received J&amp;J FDA working strategy rolled beginning September, likely immunocompromised 60. get excited exact stats yet. Several studies look much that's really point. point kids whole lives ahead, even 2% risk something dump them. Go, grandma! 😁 Best wishes!  Healthcare system collapse. may see high direct COVID related deaths, huge spike ICU usage snowballs secondary-death rates triage. 
 
I'm expert field, primary concern first COVID ravaged east coast. dont see different. 
 
However, knowledgable entire global supply chain shambles right now. Access lab equipment ventilators, O2, tubing, building materials.. name it, completely hampered COVID. work immunodiagnostic manufacturing make COVID test. absolutely bottlenecked global shortages bottles, cassettes, plastics, filter pads, proteins, whole host things. 
 
Pile paragraph onto sudden need supplies expand pop-up healthcare centers converting areas hospitals COVID over-flow... may space, equipment material needs likely wont support it. Currently, grade school aged brother whose school forcing everyone return person, one age vaccinated. Everyone fucking trying force ""normal"" point might end March last year. get covid brother dumbass school's decision, sue hospital bills die sue funeral expenses. 

Rant: also work teachers everyday, many care covid told one thinks ""the whole thing overblown"". teachers really fucking stupid. shame someone's child would taught ""corona truther"" anti vaxxer. Seriously teachers, protect fucking students please, protect us help jobs. manufacturing supplies past spike, probably going ti again. find odd stores clearencing masks, sanitizer e.t.c area straight donating crap tons well. almost people give crap anymore gonna bury heads sand screw science. pretty misleading. vaccinated majority vulnerable population exactly expect happen vaccine 100% effective. [This explains pretty well.

If vaccines would thousands even tens thousands people hospitalized. Definitely new worry bigger worry. We've stayed home, stayed mask got vaccinated soon could. last year thought worst case happened kids got infected least data showed would likely fine. seems less certain Delta. time last year worried husband would fare got sick, we're vaccinated I'm terrified kids young. week week growth been? Finding numbers states hard Tbf arrived Germany recently ferry checks anything. told bring negative test, did, trip ever asked results. think ""hero"" sign running much risk getting paid enough (soldiers, firefighters, nurses, ""essential workers"" covid infested warehouses, etc.). Depends where. US FDA guidance clinics decline giving boosters safety/liability. going opposite direction [vocally offering ~~booster~~ supplemental shot people mean kid even year old, assume attending school anyway. also, yeah. gonna ... something. NIH results J&amp;J boosters soon enough. everything I’ve seen, J&amp;J primary Moderna booster provide really outstanding protection. need studies prove out.  Yep. headline quote exactly White House talking cases, outreach efforts might occurred late. New York Times, instance, tweeted 
 early Friday morning, ""The Delta variant contagious chickenpox 
 may spread vaccinated people easily unvaccinated,  
an internal C.D.C. report said."" Ben Wakana, member White  
House's rapid response team, responded bluntly: ""VACCINATED PEOPLE  
NOT TRANSMIT VIRUS RATE UNVACCINATED PEOPLE  
YOU FAIL INCLUDE CONTEXT WRONG."" Times  
ultimately added context tweet Looking you, Kentucky, legislation passed law allowing 10 days virtual learning year. Despicable. bar disliking republicans “panders party rather making hard decisions serve greater good” mind telling us republicans that? Must really really small list. **part five** 

The federal government exercised power so-called conditional spending requiring states increase drinking age 21 years old receive full highway funds, said.

Gostin noted constraints federal government’s power use funding push states policy matters, citing Supreme Court’s 2012 determination Congress Obama administration went far threatening withhold Medicaid funding states greatly expand health-care coverage.

To stay safe constitutional footing, Biden would need use money directly related health sure totals “not extensive amount appeared coercive,” Gostin said.

Some industry leaders advocates say federal state vaccine mandates would welcome.

“A number members saying they’d love either state mandate kind government sanction mandate,” said Katie Smith Sloan, president CEO LeadingAge, group represents roughly 5,000 nonprofit aging services providers.
“Staff wants work safe place,” Sloan said. “We’re also hearing pressure residents family want sure staff vaccinated.”

Many health officials also say Biden administration rethink opposition vaccine passports play role least setting requirements them.

“There ways respectful privacy data breaches,” said Tom Frieden, former CDC director Obama administration pushing idea. “If established federal vaccine verification required increasing number things, would helpful.”

In France, President Emmanuel Macron requiring health pass citizens participate aspects civil life — prompted backlash also increased vaccination rates.

“The sense times changing,” Frieden said. “There increasing acceptance need vaccinations masks, increasing acceptance need mandates vaccinations masks.” Lmao school hasnt even started yet 😂 also don’t accept exemption places undue burden (the employer). reason exemptions usually fine small amount people use them, doesn’t really affect much. don’t think employer would tough time arguing least near-fully covid vaccinated workforce right necessary prevent undue burden. Basically, likely come much employer really wants enforce stuff problem legally.  No, US reached 70% *of adults*. We're something like 58% total population moment. total compensation includes straight salary + bonus.

If leave, might lose 401k vesting. might start PTO accrual. might lose health benefits really like. might lose professional relationships. might lose opportunities career advancement. might lose equity… **part four**

About third Americans unvaccinated, according data Kaiser Family Foundation. quarter reported plan get vaccinated end year, according organization’s July survey, released month.

The survey also found 3 percent unvaccinated Americans would get vaccinated required school, work activities. That’s June, 6 percent indicated would get shot required.

In recent weeks, Biden administration started ramping approach pandemic, initially focused making vaccine doses available, offered carrots entice people using sticks.
The Centers Disease Control Prevention reversed May guidance recommended vaccinated people wear masks indoors large swaths country infections high. led cities, including Washington, reinstitute mask mandates.

In recent decision federal workforce, White House said federal employees contractors wear masks, socially distance limit travel refuse get vaccinated. military, Biden’s direction, considering similar rules.

And White House putting together plan would require foreign nationals traveling United States countries fully vaccinated.

Other entities also started use authority mandate vaccinations. New York, city government soon require people show proof coronavirus vaccination indoor activities dining working gyms. Massachusetts officials said week requiring employees contractors long-term health facilities get first vaccine shot Sept. 1.

But federal government’s powers limited, according legal experts.
“The federal government can’t directly mandate vaccine,” said Gostin, Georgetown law professor. “It use spending power say state, ‘You mandate vaccinations. don’t, we’ll withhold certain federal dollars.’ This. get every 5 years week+ hell 2-3 weeks symptoms gone. 

I probably get colds 2+ times year mild symptoms power (although covid taught isolate now).  Way go, Joey Justin! mean it’s common floors. I’ve nurse 5 years actually seen 3 people die weren’t Covid. 2 expected old. It’s little different watching 50 something go participating society dead week Seems like it’s 50/50 covid strep, lol.  got first vaccine 2 months ago, get first vaccine now? get what?

I didn’t get 2nd reports heart problems young men age group :/ Right - everybody would least *something* prevent spread, would help lot, instead many *absolutely nothing* ignoring reality. I'm one states third vaccinated, sucks. needs misinformation flair. headline extremely misleading refusing get vaccine makes people care measurably less safe.

I every right compel get vaccine act self-defense. Thank you! problem regular nurses aware travel nurses making three times much are, likely quit. become travel nurses many leave entirely. read nursing sub even Covid bedside nursing stressful nurses last longer three years it. 

Additionally takes years study become nurse like easily fill role nurses leave. remember years Covid hearing Americans import nurses Philippines already chronic shortage. safe specifically get vaccine. get troll jerk, [deeply held vaccine somehow dangerous blatantly provably wrong. 

It's quite literally safer taking aspirin, keeps family people run safer, long excluded aspects society. seriously think mandates stop employees, even delusional previously thought... Mandates coming ass too. drag children tantrum ear actually what's necessary society. Agreed. He's Ivy educated claims read science.

Kind loss, could rational actor trying find ways keep economy open without spreading, used vaccines well, though. think 60% AZ something order. 90% pilots 80% FA actually pretty impressive. thought would lower numbers pilots. Kind weird comment. Every single law ever written something go free will.  stats covid infection cause 10, 15, 30 years. known yet. cavalier future generation's long term health moronic. recent comment someone said covid need get vaccinated period natural immunity good better vaccine. 

That comment atleast 11 upvotes.

I also commented saying got vaccinated extra protection, ability travel without restrictions prevent spreading 

According 

"" doctor wrong telling looked new studies"" 

What new studies ? 

I asked provide see even credible.

Also need traveling would need provide antibody test interesting last time checked antibodies wane time especially 6-8 months since I've infected.

I fully vaxxed today I'm also still potentially side effects time to,speak doctor (brain fog, head pressure) that's it.

Also apparently worth potential side effects.

Like covid lasting side effects know would risk getting sick like especially delta variant starting circulate. Americans allow lot shit processed food banned countries... artificial dyes artificial sweeteners. agree, us ""laundry detergent"" :) lied (or press misreported). said ""new legal authorities"" seems like actually actually begging courts mean. charade farce. still catch coronavirus masked. Best bet would stay home testing thoroughly.

As evident superior 10+ positivity rate tests. higher, better 😎 got J&amp;J shot day got Pfizer. What's consensus getting 2nd Pfizer?  59% protection symptomatic infection, severe disease. Protection severe disease lot higher, like around 90% higher depending source. deceptive JnJ worse mRNA must head sand dont think fat acceptance movement exists. business absolutely requires disease spreading behavior deadly pneumonia pandemic absolutely needs shut public safety. tolerate level risk human life business activity. work around turn lights.  school forcing work there/go there? 70% population least one dose. wonder doing. guess one ever know.

I (and even greater extent) already risk COVID (don’t let others hype thinking were, look CDC numbers broken age, healthy teenagers virtually 0 risk COVID), vaccine lowering already low risk. 

You’re vaccinated, you’re young, you’re healthy. Live life without fear, you’ve done part nothing worry about. military enforcing lockdown feels *decidedly* undemocratic. feel bad kids parents coming. dont grow obese without parents actively enabling unhealthy behaviors.

Abbott can't/won't seems hell bent making situation worse masking ban.  strong correlation unhealthy weight poor education. nurses treated like complete shit, would considered nursing career. would considered doctor expensive go med school actually trusted scalpel, though guess know live patient surgery required doctors going surgical residency.

I believe mean second class citizenship?

Also, yes, 100% ok treating unvaccinated people second class citizens. bad choices affect everyone. could done pandemic US, instead seeing rising case numbers mask mandates coming back. us responsible thing got shot rightfully pissed off. discriminate unvaccinated glee. worked gas station, bad job. 

Meanwhile I've known EMTs developed PTSD take care kids near death. Kind lame argument making though. Even efficacy numbers ""actually"" ~50%, still come benefit preventing hospitalization death, would think we'd still want many people possible vaccinated. 

To spin way sounds like anti-vaxx nonsense. understand looking 5-10 years data. Every vaccine history, side effects show within weeks. We've given 4 billion shots worldwide, 300 million shots US. Many shots many months ago. There's scary side effect bomb going go future.

But know even young people, yes low chance dying, higher I'd play around chance going hospital. Crunch numbers CDC (5% overall cases hospitalized, 18-24 year olds 1/4 likely hospitalized general average) young person catches covid better 1% chance going hospital it. Now, maybe think odds good enough play around with. me. Especially know serious side effects vaccines much rare that, covid infection produces effects vaccination does, higher rate. Vaccine requirements vaccine passports thing necessary variety illness/disease decades. Miss ""secondary citizenship"" nonsense. seems Mass. average person 0.26% chance dying virus.

The article post says people fully vaccinated 0.002% died virus.

0.26/0.002 = 130

People fully vaccinated died rate 130x less average person.

Of course change time 2 sets data dont exactly line gives general idea effective vaccines preventing people dying virus. currently 135 children hospitalized state Florida alone. know numbers original strain, seem Delta variant nothing mess around with. No, unless comorbidities would put greater risk. Dude. Look everyone hospital tell covid vaccinated. You’re completely blind don’t realize that. Completely anecdotal, covid June last year. Got first dose moderna January typical ""2nd shot"" reactions it, put two days. second shot half day feeling off. think want give bit leeway compassion considering they're teenagers. hope so, I'm also doubtful. vaccination #'s WAY higher ours, think it'll get there. hope I'm wrong! Thousands people Latin America prescribed Covid. Lol, oldest ever stop talking joke....please send help noise canceling headphones! 1 minute waking time interrupted constant questions already know answer to. said, keeping kids home year can't get vaccinated.

They 300 new cases COVID 20M population vaccination rate 24.8%

Meanwhile, Israel reporting 3000+ cases COVID 10M population 62% vaccination rate

Wtf going Romania cases low? Deaths also 2 day, even under-reporting cases, would expect deaths higher... media panic getting control. things considered, we’re remarkably well here. could possibly go wrong? think mean urn. No, see facts. fact majority people test positive need medical assistance. true since day 1. 35 million positive cases, unvaccinated people got went hospital.

With said 4k fully vaccinated people hospitalized died Covid. again, proof helps?

 thought sacrificing grandma supposed appeased COVID-19 gods Texas. Reducing hospitalization 70 percent nothing sneeze at. think we're probably going get COVID point now. going anywhere enough people refuse get vaccinated seasonal. mean mask anything though. treat they're vaccinated, pretty simple, want die, let them.

2020 like 🤨🤨🤨 ""Am joke you?"" Carl Sagan brilliant man. 

The WA slogan creates false hope ultimately divisive. someone believes ultimately go away, it’s two years later we’re still dealing it, fatigue talking ultimately create animosity towards anti-vaxxers non maskers. exacerbate “us vs them” feeling, which, opinion course based real research, bad “us vs them” non-maskers side. thoughts touchy subject.  Oh NO!!!

Anyway... anyone coffee Bailey's? retort always travel internationally I’m required get like 7 8 shots, get back. don’t see anything different one exception: vaccine new, technology (while researched years) also new. understand sympathize hang up. retort however there’s data long term effects particular vaccine, know short term effect get really bad Covid you’re going end hospital maybe worse. evidence long term effects even mild Covid, pick poison. Take one aren’t sure it’ll long term one that’ll kill couple months possibly loved ones. figures 3 4. Definitely control group included 10% risk kids. I'm saying study correct. I'm saying reasonable studies place really know point. Arguing exact probability bit like arguing many angels dance head pin.

My point that:

1. reasonable range serious long-covid risk kids somewhere \[1% - 10%\]. 
2. Unvaccinated kids person high risk getting covid schools open close Delta peak.
3. Vaccines released couple months kids
4. wave peak decline also within couple months
5. couple months online, kids, hurt learning measurable way
6. .... offering online learning kids yet eligible vaccine, time get vaccinated, \*option\*, seems like easy win  Reuters source saying ""71% effective infection"" seen study design assuming means symptomatic infection. know source correct?    second pharmacy correct. first one operating outdated information. unfortunate understandable mistake. Calling bullshit. 

Kids masking 18 months. would RSV start rising masking mandates *dropped*? Calm down. choice work somewhere else want get vaccinated. lol go shot quit living fear. Relax. Unless you’re like Staten Island, you’re fine. Yes, need look bright side. man, $200. 😇 mental health quickly gone downhill last 6 months. I'm introvert, everyone limits. **iusethistolearnstuff** correct incorrect.

2) **iusethistolearnstuff** said .26%, = .0026, rounds .003. .0003% would .000003. could also said ""just quarter one percent"" accurate. Correct. Many unvaxxed nurses tend rural areas state. NV. many going waste years education training cost say ""no vaccine"" quit. going go? Start over? Move? easily could move... maybe nurse begin (and question competency...the stories wife tell regarding nurse coworkers ""ability"" would make question many things. Shitty employees exists EVERY profession)  This. Oh, please don’t think I’m downplaying throw vaccines. Death numbers would 5-50x vaccines weren’t there, given numbers. McDonald's recommends buy big mac.  ""But know? Show real data!"" course not. look actually look statistics, people getting vaccinated aren’t stupid conspiracy theory believers. Man, healthcare fucked US. No, need both. That’s be. Vaccinations lead marked decrease infection rate severity. reasonable alternative vaccinating almost everyone, going back normal. incapable, rather, willing. freedom, ‘Murcia, etc etc.  ‘Muricans simply lack band together greater good.  guessing lazy vaxers thought people getting vaxed would protect them. another surge decided get it. guess this'll push, either deaths changing ideology, make Florida go blue. trying get political, position democratic leadership. press conference teacher spoke wanting masks school. “speech” went don’t need masks stating kids quarantine miss school due covid fell behind difficulty catching (paraphrasing course). It’s like - you’re soooo close yet far away lady! viewpoint world whole, particular countries. obviously giving people third world first shot going save lives giving people first world third shot. don’t need push boosters yet folks.

WHO right. Many poorer countries don’t even 1% population vaccinated. Please let’s help out, get vaccinated.

Push Congress people advocate donation vaccines COVAX.  understand situation perfectly. takes one person traveling cause massive outbreak city, lockdown efforts futile. Time focus productive measures, mate. think even cases, need get vaccine start showing symptoms. County health records. doctor knew immediately vaccinated. think I'd rather take chances live like next three years. I'm blighting life benefit people declined vaccine choice. Two years ago terribly sick flu. hit hard week, felt lingering exhaustion month afterwards. cannot understand people ""scared"" mild unpleasantness 24 hours know back mind immune system learning protect you. think getting Covid would better? Time quit reapply. Hell, 7 DMA deaths/day 310 week ago, 418. Shits getting hairy Putin you? news delayed return, local business continue get crushed. Hope make January without additional stimulus. Hundreds kids still died covid, I’m trying sister one someone Texas, feel pain. I'm painfully aware I'm surrounded idiocy none precautions take ultimately matter that. don’t know help, came across /r/Masks4All: Powecom offering kids’ size kn95. Currently anticipating fresh stock end August.

Bonafide legit retailer according Masks4All sub, vouch Powecom’s adult masks, I’ve using daily mask months (I use earsaver Delta achieve snug fit). One thing like brand code back package verify authenticity.

(Reposted link /r/masks4all post rather retailer due automod) places need this, florida, Texas etc never this.   certain point, department social services get involved? Wouldn’t letting child fall ill due negligence trigger sort fail safe let child harm’s way? Ooops, misinterpret then, sorry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks clarification! nice hear Moderna touting product, sure would never biased........ isn’t Florida already reporting well? Imagine true numbers! Yep- largely insurance companies able fuck people. Stop saying look data. data post it. going go research you. don’t post your, look data comment meaningless. Post data stop pressing it. live Melbourne do. normal summer we'll back normal soon

Been three month lockdown never want again. Locking prevents that. Also stops death overwhelmed hospitals

Just places can't mean can't done Look bright side things, fall could suck lot guys weren’t vaccinated. virus could’ve taken dad‘s life torn whole family apart, leaving rest permanent lung damage brain damage. means won’t much fun. Cases become hospitalizations, eventually deaths.

They matter.

They also spreads virus.

Florida 20k cases means there’s bunch sick people FL. Compare CA 10k see chance running someone covid FL far higher running someone covid CA, matters, it’s huge.   Right? Gimme dat Great already stated behavior happened back dealing polio, might still around god know many affect it. That’s badly society fucked selfishness and/or ego Mississippi. So, possibly? Lol wild ride. April may everyone optimistic. Look us now, back fucking mess. 50% vaccinated headed right back late December early January. I’m confused guys .

DeSantis info saying everything ok.

That’s impossible hurdle overcome.

He’s making Florida info hard access, telling people research…

This exact reason governments, handle big stuff, yet state government failing Florida. Every employer needs mandate vaccination. bookkeeping payroll clients. happens someone profession unvaccinated gets severe covid? could unable work. Employees get paid. Bills get paid.

Anyway… Miami-Dade city/County. DeSantis governor entire state trying imply know. saying doctors really get pick choose treat. basically say, first come first serve. south, extreme religious groomed deny science, faith god exists trust preacher person says. I'd wager fewer atheist anti-vax. One possibility Moderna dosage overkill original wild strain, antibody efficacy reduced much Delta helps abundance antibodies begin with.

Did antibody titers differ significantly Moderna Pfizer? don’t know ever saw study directly compared that. Everybody moved right onto phase 3, real world results versus wild strain. Yes anecdotal interviews without numbers. Again, look data England. delta wave already. hasn’t shown anymore dangerous variants. It’s transmissible, kids may get it, odds serious outcomes low. Eventually exposed, hopefully vaccinated, may may reduce odds children. cdc could definitely stopped administration wanted to. spread every inch planet don’t worry 100 percent correct.

""Scientists hoping coronavirus vaccine least 75% effective, 50% 60% effective would acceptable, too."" August 2020. vaccines blow numbers away—*even variants*. that's ""moving goalposts,"" it?  Early precedent nothing vaccinated people. 

The talks several studies vaccinated people transmitting virus. one saying vaccinated people spread virus, person originally responded comparing vaccinated unvaccinated, that's clearly unfair comparison. Also high sensitivity CRP( cardio reactive protein?) Cut completely then, there’s gain life, quit it. much do.   What’s drop 6 months? Fingers crossed mean. variants there. Warehouse employees shut hell pee pants tho Nice see someone bit sense around here. though people's risk perception completely atrophied response constant drip feed alarmism we're exposed daily form headlines like this.

I sincerely hope people never let children get car ever again, they're concerned safety. leave house ever again. people want deal kids school. understand many parents hell-bent preventing mask use schools though. daughter great mask run around day playground even care. used understands important.

As usual, problems start parents. Parents anti-mask able get kids wear properly (although doubt ever tried), parents try blame anyone anything else it. 60% vaccinated still needing lockdown? fuck going world lol. anyone positive outlook things.

What trying accomplish truly fucking impossible. much tracking daily (like Virginia, Chicago, etc) much randomly releasing numbers every weeks, something! recent numbers gathered info. everyone hospital two week period. Yes vaccinated numbers great working, hospitals filled blink eye. REALLY WELL first two weeks July everything skyrocketed there's really backpedaling masking. one's really willing wear anymore.  anti vaccine/masking

Yes. Several nurse friends say common, also common child care jobs(my sector) also woefully underpaid do.  Maybe someone close governor actually gets hurt even dies, realize error. maybe recalcitrant hard heart care. hear everyone adding 6 date second shot read 50% direct care workers vaccinated.

Also, data isn’t quite yet waning numbers. Yes, Pfizer’s efficacy numbers reported slightly less that’s real-world data Israel. Moderna still reporting 93% efficacy. 6 months later, vaccines holding strong. thing understand. somebody comes talks death covid, start questioning facts surrounding it, talk death rate like minimal, talk mild disease, say happy take risk getting covid, say flu, suggest deaths misrepresented, say death context, whole bunch bullshit minimise effect disease.

But second death vaccine mentioned, completely different story. okay take risk regarding health, effects deaths attributed vaccine extreme unacceptable, fact new vaccine therefore long term effects unknown becomes really important (even though covid also new unknown long term effects), question underlying conditions may caused death vaccine, etc.

It literally blows fucking mind. Ikr? I’ve always thought that. definitely instead Netflix imo  parents still screwed kid catches Covid make hard choice sending kid school sick working taking unpaid time work care sick child. whole situation sucks. Yes, actually would still better indoors similar situations, obviously something still avoid much though should. sadly Republicans try block every step way filibuster. hope wrong too, suspect right. America done again. normalized absurd notions behind getting vaccinated.

We'd still polio thing happened back then. Blisters?? symptom somehow missed?? Coworker said exact thing response end. Said need eat healthier…as drank high caffeine energy drink ate chicken nuggets.   Directed Steven Soderbergh  I'm sorry keep hearing pizza parties threads. serious?

Is actually hospitals drive ""motivation""? Try Reuters one. thinking same, aren’t creating vaccine evading variant vaccinated people spread since mutates frequently enough cause current multiple variants. one random comments makes miss FB laugh react. people outside bubble. me, interact well. afraid Moderna shot cause heard effects worse Pfizer. felt nothing first shot. second shot sore arm, slight headache, mild nausea, chills, low fever tired. lasted 2 days. silly apprehensive figured better real infection! fine Sounds like 603 I'm introverted want lot attention. bandwidth. COVID literally never alone hard me. easier say office. alone office easy easier ignore people.  go back masks change behaviors.

Your three paragraphs prior long way saying ""we'll keep thing, moral purity"" way see logically lead this. quantifiable endpoint? long focus behavioral piety, rather numbers, never thing ""no masks"".

That's true even stop wearing surge abates need go back there's another surge, even said surge accompanied minuscule levels death hospitalization. perpetual Sword Damocles functionally equivalent forever masking.  look like mostly alpha variant numbers skimmed. delta extra load waning antibodies time would increase numbers.

Still way better unvaxxed though. true. Yep. time got march, inevitably ordeal lasting years Sure. Unless concerts going days question becomes, won’t virus mutate away vaccine like antibiotics become useless and/or disease becomes antibiotic resistant? really seems frightening vaccinated people infected spread virus, creating new variant won’t work even booster. curious understood viruses/bacteria work general new variants diseases. Silicon valley SOP. also fairly easy tell understands evaluate compare risks. people really bad comparing risks. Actuary smh.  Im 100% sure you’re saying. You’re saying there’s unlimited amount people USA? I’m sure agree. even worse. convinced wear mask they'll forever. us live inside forever totally okay need bow healthy people's whims. right, got info doctor We’ll get back  dumb Microsoft included FAANG.  Ironically I've heard obesity (similarly smoking) actually lowers person's lifetime healthcare costs kills people younger, get really expensive elderly stages. best data could find quickly although years old. definitely think charging anti-vaxxers higher rates. well asked wear masks saw went right Hmm sure I’m following. you’re saying there’s unlimited amount people US? world whole? confirmed. They're giving Moderna booster healthcare workers doubt healthy lifestyle could unknown underlying condition covid may made worse. mean, said still got covid despite lifestyle. required get many vaccines life. another one. big deal? hope non vaccinated people pay lot higher insurance people hospitals Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Back**ed by** ~~Despite~~ Delta Variant first jab Moderna beginning April. actually signed Pfizer either available wanted use open, Moderna. really care either way. long term side effects, short term mildly sore arm first days second shot bad fever ill two three days (by third day mostly ok, every felt bad). feel absolutely normal now, obvious side effects. one family social circle long term side effects.

I would honestly worried Covid right now, seeing hospitals filling vast majority un-vaxxed people across country. sudden, [they trust Whenever make obvious joke like string people along realize. lil coaching helps. “I went party 14 vaccinated people; 11 us got COVID”

That's big chunk early alt-right started. suspect systems work, disheartening see. think exactly said, hate say it. tested positive yet. We've home antigen tests since found Monday wife tested positive yesterday (Wednesday). test yesterday today still negative. PCRs done CVS yesterday, said would 2-3 days get results. I've got funk nose/throat wife around infected person much wife. I'm crossing fingers I'm infected, holding breath.

That said, since I'm potentially infected wife definitely is, holed bedroom wearing 2 masks. comes bedroom (I try bring anything needs, work sometimes can't) kids put masks. 

I've solo kid duty, wearing 2 masks trying stay office much possible. started sleeping office last night. get antigen test comes back positive PCR positive I'll go back sleeping bed (sleeping chair sucks, even recline).

It's rough kids 5 8. 8 year old sort gets what's going mom can't hang dad involved much. 5 year old get it. pulled summer day camp Monday. They're bored others' throats half day. next door neighbor literally yelling me, simply said returned wearing mask safety immunocompromised, kids, FFS frontline healthcare workers. Took walk away. Meowth! That’s right!!! nearly zero side effects Moderna. shoulder sore 48 hours first shot, nothing second. Today learned. That's interesting info.

Was spices part supposed hyperlink? actually really interested reading link anything. Countries treating Covid endemic ample amount people vaccinated. Singapore UK sending intention awhile now. sure US still hell bent keeping R number 1 virus transforms quickly. going follow Flu route moving forward. Data presently shows AstraZeneca followed mRNA vaccine pretty much indistinguishable pair mRNAs. get vaccine may may outpace us. would be, IMO, foolhardy solely ""blame"" policy, politics, adoption. critical accountability demanded one simply must acknowledge develop, implement distribute brand new vaccine within months entire population world never likely fully succeed. *is* exponential growth works, stumbled upon force limits long go on. Everything think limit, approach limit exponential growth inevitably slow down. case limit population size (well technically lower number would take lot guesswork figure exactly), exponentials might physical limits like speed light size limitations (ie: Moores Law computing). break efficacy data age bracket? can't imagine flat across ages. Honestly heard yet. Thanks downvotes Reddit. stupid thing say lot people still impression can't get spread Covid they're vaccinated. needs shouted rooftops. think I'll necessarily get indepth studies either, think general recommendation come based data, least general recommendations boosters. 


Once hits, I'll first line. already got shot back March people due local vaccine hesitancy, regret that. Ok need booster dose please! can't wrap mind around crazy. Baby blood..wtf. know laugh cry. course, odds happening twice person basically zero. 

I think true. Remember, 2 doses get result simple random sample. get facility, example, impossible came adjacent lots, therefore likely over- under-diluted, 2 completely random doses would been. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I really agree discounts health care because, like said, still penalty base premium higher. 

Alas, perhaps we've already started slope. couldn’t agree more. We’ve lived shoulder shoulder people many years, agreeing disagree, took airborne disease like covid make distinctions us sharp possible. family considering relocation state. family members north tried get us leave last year, waited vaccine. see permanent way life people. So... antivaxxers True - said people used arrangement, think actually common one (people get flu shots every year, MMR etc much less frequently). I'm saying, easy idea people understand vaccines sterilizing, since common one get isn't. feel like we’re getting close six months lot fully vaccinated people. plan booster shots? Barring proliferation variants demonstrably significant vaccine escape Delta we've warned mostly try talk Fauci referred openly today. thought transmission thing old news? looked Republicans vote presidential primaries though numbers would look different.

If DeSantis running president primaries significant hurdle general election. Republicans electoral college advantage generally home state state Florida would add advantage. Plus primaries many candidates compete against, maybe including Trump himself. wants win he’ll stand building reputation hard-line anti-public health stuff could unfortunately help that. can't say surprised much hate this. things seen pandemic. they’re fucking brain dead morons hinge thought processes personalities antagonistic.

Interesting, I'm gonna reading that. interested exact question collected data articles (= anecdotal evidence).

Most include time vaccination someone got infected, question (which saw comments here) gets answered too.

**The scary thing is: vaccines sometimes even last 2 months :O** 

**And: cases even got infected despite wearing mask.**

First off, general data:

**Months receiving second dose** COVID vaccine, Jennifer Leascher exposed virus. started feel sick days later. 
“I thought ‘hmm maybe allergies giving sinus infection’... still go to, mind go COVID... vaccinated.” 
But symptoms got worse, Leascher **taken Midland Memorial Hospital.** “I admitted COVID unit 9th floor...” **“I huge amount steroids, oxygen...”** 
In Leascher’s case, says **her road recovery far over.** “I don’t know I’m ever gonna come back this. runner, I’ve runner since 1997.” making health insurance unaffordable

yeah that's already done. I've working 7 day scheduling since November. feeling ill day work service industry get fired. Yes, working around hospital staff every day risks exposing increasing risk breakthrough cases frontline staff spread patients.

Part qualifications minimize risk staff patients, isn’t willing qualified work high risk environments like healthcare. 

There plenty locations go requirement, swap (through normal market forces) positions someone non-critical environment doesn’t mind getting vaccine. wondering question though, measure Delta's infectiousness. describing infectious is, descriptor see R-naught value, wondered there's equivalent way describe infectious I'm vaccinated hanging around vaccinated people. thanks explanations!  VMware? Given option traditional vaccines mRNA vaccines, one would prefer get vaccinated with? I'd curious see family wearing masks vaccinated.  sending kids back school unprotected? Oh man. talking husband this. tried hard everything right. son starts middle school year needs back school. IEP I’m sure he’s fallen back fault own. kept home past year half don’t know do. feel like I’m bound make wrong decision. month feeling hopeful delta arrived. I’ve never unsure it’s eating up. Ugh. Let’s hope kids stay safe protected crawl school year. want unvaccinated nurse spreading covid patients. Nothing else matters here. wife Moderna tested positive yesterday. received Pfizer. far negative me. went county fair - outside wore mask time. removed eating drinking. small fever - 100 runny nose eyes small cough. About. Fucking. Time.

\-ER MD Sales side too. literally caste system anti vax nurses allowed work covid units. way pose risk patients.  Ok. I’m paramedic. got second done December. me? I’m 6 months! wanted say thank you. rarely come across comment almost immediately starts change mind subject. well said, fundamentally good point. means article calling law changed. illegal Yeah, annual event stop original COVID, reason think Delta variant would make difference. nation sorely needs general strike. think things consider plain efficacy talking better. Houston hospitals NICU bed today 11 month old critical need; care flight little one Temple. hospitals capacity governor issued ban mandatory masking, calling another special session election legislation. even click link read subheading?

""There little correlation CEO income hospital quality—but salary excessive marketing.""

Scroll little, read:

""Published Journal American Medical Association: Internal Medicine, study found link nonprofit CEO pay number important hospital quality indicators, including mortality rates, readmission rates, amount charity care institutions provide."" Interesting. Thank sharing. wanted Moderna, ended getting Pfizer. view vaccination hospital workers way view security clearance, yes. Many qualified people can’t get clearance due debt….because compromises ability job high level risk life though. probably buy lottery ticket odds benefits would huge, equal life huge. Also risk permanently affects even higher, long term effects covid (we know of) much worse anything know vaccine. purely risk-based approach choosing risk life 100-sided die instead 1000000-sided one, odds even worse becoming permanently debilitated. top choosing known higher risk, making quite assumption vaccine worse long term effects. 

The biology behind vaccine much established potential long term effects covid well. Like body treating vaccine mRNA different own, protein created produces immune response like vaccines know far lower risk covid. Like put perspective many foreign proteins immune system deal lifetime, covid protein one more. ingredients vaccine established miniscule risk well, basically risk, like far less spontaneous brain aneurism. hand know covid far higher chance causing kinds debilitating side effects. 

Basically treating like gambling casino's favorite customer. anemia lots ibuprofen. average weight consume anything recreationally (including alcohol) issues.

Appreciate it.  precedent set long ago. founding fathers afraid strong executive, we'd still living Articles Confederation.

Edit: also noted people issues Trump tried run roughshod sanctuary cities. judicial legislative checks executive power reason. People unreliable. come South Carolina McMasters pleads us @think kids” banning masks schools. good it? group tracking verifiable trustworthy adverse reactions vaccines? ...I mean... Unfortunately, public bunch selfish twats. ironic heavy smoker relatives willing take chances vaccinating. Misinformation rampant. Texas hates Reddit... wait. dont... Reddit hate us? thing is, nursing shortage profound nationally, nurses literally go anywhere. incentive stay Arkansas get fucked populace neither cares physical mental health. Move Northern California work infusion center. Move Seattle work endoscopy. Move New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, dozens nations offer reciprocity enjoy cushy ass life fuckload vacation days year A&amp;E. 

The saddest part though people driving nurses away ever convinced behavior problem - thus change it. drugs really miracle, melanoma responsive them. Keep hope--I seen many people saved drugs would done well 5 years ago. Yup, believe isolation worse kids covid call cops them? Seems like assault. Signing bonuses hospital applies ""new hires worked 12 months"" 🖕😑🖕  En moderación hay problema compa! They're literally killing themselves. fuck wrong them. Arkansas heard somebody working (Arkansas Children's Hospital) more, reported yet. Things bad. know what’s bigger Texas? staffing crisis. Yes I'm serious. right matters life?

Very sad. Sounds like stupid mother. persuaded boys get fully vaccinated, instead waiting became infected say, ""Pray."" 
      
If COVID-19 kill boys, still acquire debilitating symptoms [long-haul many months longer, might prevent completing classes graduating. Sadly, seems mother made bed them, boy's sleep it.

(I'm saying lock feel like crap come on, many times wasted days feeling like hot garbage colleague, friend, relative best prevent spread?) Yeah right basically delta timeline study included non delta. would look like last month two accurate data. all. Manufacturing supply network entirely different 6 months ago. Plus single shot need hold supply ensure people keep schedule. told vaccines like 95% effective

BEFORE DELTA. arrival Delta put original facts vaccine doubt? makes sense me. Yeah also individual rights. balance. That's measuring tool need seriously reevaluate life. ever enjoy work home family need make changes. Nice story guys. people valid reasons, people think they'll die, get sick microchips Bill Gates vaccin even blood babies. duty: get vaccinated help country raise percentage people vaccinated shit opened done. Yeah, Israel bringing back masks much curb transmission either.

If really want curb transmission they're going ask people stop socializing again, understandably want do, masking, especially kind masks people wearing, is... well, wish they'd least cite studies prove they're helping. ""Look know works, I'm math here,"" new answer derail current events discussions work Places like Florida Texas shown indeed teach stupid. ""essential"" workers this. Quit offer work much generous benefits. workers' market. really is. knew felt kick. can’t wait booster! sciencey term virus feeding stupidity side fuckin’ idiot sauce? said comment 😉 Blood fucking hands. makes sense. Amazon wants go WFH permanently I'm going perfectly honest here, think anyone knows word comorbidities means may also be, hear out, intelligent.

I disagree that. teach parrot word comorbidities almost guarantee idea talking about. vast majority time see people bringing person, idea talking about. parroting something heard.

Hell one using wifi signal strength detector detect ""harmful"" electromagnetic waves, Bluetooth earbud ear, browsing internet via wifi. I'm like know using frequency ""harmful"" waves, right? think it’s weird people can’t abort baby matter compilations might have. child dies Covid people say, “well, bet pre-existing conditions.” boggles mind people pretend kids can’t get really sick covid.

I think lot comes we've always asked consume science. usually get declared facts third-party sources (the media), we've kind culturally come understanding science finds facts closes book. We're seeing process directly first time. Science stated kids get sick. That's consumed concluded fact. Florida wont seem care bodies start lining streets. fucking sad. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Sounds like labor market working here. Shortage skilled workers lead higher workforce fatigued,” said W. Stephen Love, president CEO Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council. “These health care heroes 18 19 months. Many leaving workforce, saying ‘I can’t anymore.’”

Now apparently back ""heroes"" eyes CEOs there's labor shortage. I'm starting sense pattern. True, something tells multi-billion dollar corporations figure out. mention symptomatic vs asymptomatic, mild vs serious symptomatic, etc Viral load also fairly meaningless itself. like risk factor, like high viral load likely transmit it, and/or likely sever case. necessarily actually happen. Even high viral load, never makes progress body (because robust vaccinated immune response), going take damage. Listening science basing decision it, understanding biology itself, make moron. Seeing science burying head sand makes moron.
 
These people state waiting data making decision. They've already made decision.
 differences large degree driven unvaccinated Republicans. Majorities Republicans say “never” wear mask outdoors crowded outdoor places, work, grocery store.
 
They morons. things happened mass blackouts February (in Texas). understanding (entirely possible I'm wrong) grandfathered EUA since negotiations started long ago. Give weeks lying outside hospitals dying struggling breathe. J&amp;J vaccine exist anymore what? big goal getting vaccinated die ventilator. Vaccinated I'm track preferred death, shot jealous husband I'm 98. Would mind looking name person commenting to, compare name person made statement replying to? said there's comparison vaccination rate. I'm person posted original commenr.

I'm done  Needless SMH.  evidence points still curbing transmission, much previous variants. think extent sound-byte manipulated headline. mean, yes. sometimes take bus work people won’t even wear masks bus (or yell driver makes them). concerts, etc. Everything typical summer. Heaps people care avoiding places staying home enough people there’s difference. Austin hospitals serve 11 counties aren’t bright blue. 72k sick past week - imagine kid who's asymptomatic parents denial tested, they're passing huge differences weather well. Florida surge last summer everyone NE northern areas saw drop considerably. Guess happened fall hit? Yeah. vaccinated. dare sensible enough remember developing bodies substantially different mature ones! middle pandemic less! 

For real though, topic much average Reddit user. Lots people may brushed epidemiology 101 past 2 years overall response still likely emotionally-based actual knowledge. hope you’re right. 33,000 votes! course, done lot suppress vote since then, see. 

If think restricting mail-in voting keep voting, they’re wrong. voted person President last year despite vaccine, I’ll year matter many cases day. say they're prioritized, first come first serve system happens lot patients COVID+ Ultimately society gaining immunity, stronger time, becomes potential speed bump vast majority people.

This arms race. long virus heavy circulation people resistance (the ""immunity' get exposure) Increase evolutionary pressure virus adapt slip past immune systems. 

I'm starting wonder virus can't outpace us. I'd one thing people vaccinated infected/recovered around time. Cases could drop pretty quickly then, still seem pretty divided whole bunch vaccinated people mixed high number infected people seems like perfect breeding ground new strains pop up. children's hospital Kansas City ""at capacity"": Children’s Mercy, 269 patients tested positive COVID-19 259 tested positive RSV last week among in- outpatient children treated hospital system July 26 Aug. 1.  recently late spring, Children’s Mercy averaged roughly 30 positive pediatric COVID-19 cases per week. School started kids today 

They're 1st K

I told wear mask, they're kids class wearing them.
Eventually peer pressure got take off.

I dont know do. 

But know HATE Ron DeSantis putting whole state situation.

The man murderer Vaccines hope. need make society difficult unvaccinated. gets full FDA approval, bet flying, riding train, eating out, etc start require proof vaccination. It’s ideal world live in, better 200k cases day.  Ok guys crazy idea hear out. Anyone who’s reasonable listens scientists nonsense Facebook misinformation already gotten vaccine. Throwing science people going work. let’s give want. time let’s make misinformation positive. Tell everyone vaccine made penis grow half inch. lost 10 lbs 30 days nowhere. raises testosterone 10%!!

Hint: vaccination rates!&lt; tested weekly

At whose expense?  Stupid is, I'm glad usual side effects doses. made vaccine real me. 

After year pandemic, masks fear students testing positive around me, waiting turn vaccine half year, hard process finally vaccinated worst me. vaccination instant uneventful felt unreal. course, intellectually knew real, take bandaid hours, kept looking disbelief, next day got 24h fever finally sank in.

Again, know stupid. people would rather side effects. just... me, helped. That's pro-life conservatives hypocrites. want people born world help *live* it. Well needed Crap! Mask everyone! wear two masks tho? It’s much safer… small indie pharmaceutical company, please understand.  make uneducated guess children affected states also lot less healthier children UK. lot less children comorbidities UK US, change data lot point.

Full stop. Can't homeschool jobs requiring go back office.

Inaction seems easier &amp; feels safer. 

Now Delta it’s becoming clear weights changing equation.   thing time zone changes. Arizona holdout Every God damn road Florida feels like toll road. doubt they'll change even nothing left gators...  left dog freezing home, apparently. There’s also something bring outside drinking 4 days straight baseball fields/parks, it’s insanely dusty windy, get almost nothing body needs since food isn’t great typically flying city.

Az small risk. good supply.

Gov recently changed criteria people get az gp.

Basically supply issue living covid free lot means people 

Just think race Happy cake day.

I interpret story 1) breakthroughs happen, 2) 99% mild cases, 3) vaccine works Without department education funds states pass mask mandate bans. get really saucy try none. Go religion commando. It’s refreshing.  Similar story me. Mine late 60s central Florida. Thankfully fully vaxxed since March, sleeping well last weeks.

So far, data look good delta infections among vaccinated, said, hearing occasional nice anecdote hurt either. Like battling novel virus several weeks? people piling psych wards ramming walls addition staff bailing collapsing weight long-lasting trauma. merely symptom massive mental health crisis come happened times Bacterial antibiotic resistance little complicated that. many bacteria, antibiotic resistance stored primary DNA secondary DNA molecule called plasmid. plasmid funny things like exchange material bacteria, even ones different species.

Development new antibiotics lags behind; therefore, novel approaches problem antibiotic resistance sorely needed commentary highlights one relatively unexplored target drug development: conjugation. Conjugation common mechanism horizontal gene transfer bacteria instrumental spread antibiotic resistance among bacteria. resistance genes found mobile genetic elements primarily spread conjugation. Furthermore, conjugative elements act reservoir maintain antibiotic resistance bacterial population even absence antibiotic selection. Thus, conjugation spread antibiotic resistance quickly bacteria microbiome pathogens selective pressure (antibiotics) introduced. Potential drug targets include plasmid-encoded conjugation system host-encoded proteins important conjugation. Ideally, conjugation inhibitor used alongside antibiotics prevent spread resistance within pathogens acting growth inhibitor itself. Inhibiting conjugation important addition arsenal strategies combat antibiotic resistance crisis, allowing us extend usefulness antibiotics. still misunderstanding me.

The Rs even *would* listen getting vaccinated anyway. Texas? Probably due fatigue, human error, black market. happens times know, someone actually use biological weapon US obvious great number people would nothing prevent successful, would fact would help enemy succeed.

It's really easy. Wear mask, limit large gathetings, travel absolutely necessary. Get effecrive vaccine.

Put aside CEO pay question. details measure compare things like mortality rates readmission rates? comparable superficial level across hospitals due environment. inner city Chicago hospital ER receives lots gun violence victims may higher mortality rate hospital upper middle class suburb, *have* normalize data take account kind things right? Otherwise stat meaningless.

Also true readmission rates. Without normalizing patients base (type illness, complexity illness, etc), can't directly compare top cancer institute uses experimental treatments difficult cases hospitals even touch. That's extreme example, get mean.

Then ""amount charity care"". important charity chare society, fail see objective benchmark medical institute's operational capability. rank universities generous scholarship programs are, all. 

Finally, even argument current hospital CEO's pay correlated hospital's care level quality, argument high low CEO's pay be. correctly identify good CEOs incentivize push toward better care quality patients instead rewarding marketing campaigns, think *still* pay limited even incentives aligns general public? 15% Australia fully vaccinated, much choice else previous efforts would wasted. Sounds like shingles. got sick January 2020 – like sick sick doctors couldn’t figure got month – shingles followed whatever had. Apparently depleted immune system crack virus needs open door shingles. See sticky front page! lay plenty evidence exactly point there, particularly relevant Delta variant also touching variants too. NY provided guidance schools regarding opening up. districts bare minimum opening up, without testing protocols, check ins, covid car transparency, meaningful distancing. thing district requiring masking. That's it. Everything else literally ""back normal"". superintendent even refers pandemic using past tense. We're livid.  bot part PantsLivesMatter something? need hit herd immunity fall. numbnuts want get vaccinated course left.

Burn foolish leave room others fall/winter flu season hits. don’t really know yet. know mixing AZ Pfizer produces immuno response might better anything individually. J&amp;J might different enough doesn’t quite work like that. dumb? 
are seriously insinuating 2-3 month lockdown expensive hospital expenditure literally millions infected people? 
mate, please sit think, try answer comparative economics question *aren't people* ;-) article:
“I ask go get vaccinated, endangering people around you, walking machine gun shooting Delta viruses us,” prime minister said. “This selfish, unworthy irresponsible. None want kill people mistake, waiting vaccination stations.” CDC shockingly inept pandemic. virus deadly would completely fucked. read actual news, avoid social media  record, already vaccine, need convince me.

Still, important stay fair risk-benefit weighting, also demographic subgroup. current mood convince everyone get vaccinated sake herd immunity twisting facts sounds like great deal everyone, even facts clear.

I'm fan that. want convince people get vaccinated even though 100% clear (statistical) benefit health, mandate. Otherwise, always, compassionate people ones carrying risk. weigh upsides downsides policy options willing use statistics? 

Yes, 512 dead kids means 512 tragedies. Would 1,000 kids worse? Would 10 kids better? sure think so. 

Does logically mean protect 1,000 children protect 10 kids?

It's like increased social isolation school closures negative influences kids.

In 2019 9,173 children ages 1 14 died USA. 9,173 tragedies. died infectious diseases like Flu Chickenpox, car accidents, on.

If 48 million kids aged 1-14 stayed home time good proportion would still alive today. 

Is life worth living? childhood worth living 48 million kids? downside worth upside terms preventing tragic children dying? 

You run away dilemma screaming immoral think way, us taken actions every single year put children's lives risk cases right decision. control everything. Risk part life. Risk aversion fear. can’t upvote enough. Patient satisfaction surveys reason healthcare workers physically verbally abused daily basis. They’ve bred entire generation entitled patients know say anything healthcare worker say “Thank sir, more?” Best luck! got covid took 6-7 days lose smell 7 months later it’s still fully recovered it’s getting there. California hiring woes rest country unskilled labor? live Florida literally billboards advertising jobs need staff. Everything school bus drivers tradesmen restaurant staff billing personnel. think CDC access data - it’s public knowledge. mean fair EMT you’re exactly providing much treatment you’re mostly driving providing assistance medic. still license (depending state) pay tad higher $9. I'm upset high school lumped younger grades without access vaccine state reopening plan.

FFS, high schools probably one easiest places mandate COVID vaccines. Sorry meant probably numbers closer truth. haven’t shared them. see people transportation logistics industries going world without vaccinated. listen experts

I think Café boss expert Covid, were, they'd make masks mandatory guests too. course work café make (not working) compromise employees wear masks still open, instead selling to-go.

Its actually worse shows they'd rather risk café becoming infection herd, rather limiting service. profit's sake. employees take shit? Sounds wack. I'm pro-M4A, socialized medicine, wanted show currently US insurance charge 30% premium difference compliance http://chirblog.org/workplace-wellness-programs-have-overlooked-health-equity/ can't really expect government able sell line ""you live increased risk vaccinate someone Uganda"".

It makes sense vaccinate globally give third dose Europeans, selling people easy. great Australia well known system help support people mental health concerns. 

In NY lockdown situation needs protect mental health. Unfortunately, northern Virginia people need way convince happen children. pretty human rationalize abate fear place offered job bitches moans nobody wants work anymore. work county service paying EMT’s roughly $10 hour. act like shit don’t stink! don’t even get paid decently you’re medic that’s year minimum school you’re trying make work shitty wage year. know exactly they're obese. role genetics plays obesity metabolism quite small. obese 100% due overeating.  blame kids, parents. That's ok then!????? Actually saw one earlier comments worried you. Glad you’re feeling better! Stay mend! like I'm parent, sending unvaccinated children covid rich environment (with dominant strain making kids sick)?

It's nothing short mental Fuck, right.. nurse cnn saying want hero tag, sign give life job. ""But vaccinated people, replication soon alerts immune system send blood-borne antibodies neutralize virus nose throat, Leal says. Another new preprint scientists Singapore found although vaccinated unvaccinated patients infected Delta similar viral loads diagnosed, loads declined rapidly vaccinated. “Based basic immunology, that’s exactly would expect—that vaccinated individuals would clear infection much faster,” says Kristian Andersen, infectious disease researcher Scripps Research."" 


Symptomatic transmit virus window much shorter (i.e. overall transmit less virus). clear answer yet whether asymptomatic vaccinated people spread virus. Probably yes, probably rare case.

Vaccinated parents careful unvaccinated kids concerned.  Uh, yeah like me. Fucked smell since spring 2020. number least you’re general members public tell job? That’s gotta perk. brain damage alzheimer issue?  much uniform. get large areas like US masks seen political statement.

Many countries start wearing masks summer even took autumn become common. Denmark Netherlands anymore Sweden never really did.

The fact rules weaker countries change said. compliance mask mandate low? can't uncompliant something exist. fact rules weaker countries change said. Compliance rules high they're there, done. worn situations told to. example, barely ever see someone thought said times masks schools never thing are.

How relevant? wear masks schools, don't. compliance low something meant done? Adults wear public indoor spaces, do. happens nursing monthly weekly areas.

COVID fixing that!!!  **France rules health pass get bars restaurants lawful** 
It’s Robyn Vinter here, dipping live blog Nicola takes well-earned break. 
France’s constitutional court ruled new law requiring public hold health pass access bars restaurants health workers vaccinated Covid-19 mid-September largely complied republic’s founding charter, Reuters reports. 
The Constitutional Council however deemed unconstitutional sack health worker short-term contract refused mandatory vaccine enforce mandatory quarantine checks anyone testing positive. use concern unvaccinated, nature strong decide special kind stupid. nurses go public. Hospitals run MBAs zero knowledge understanding medicine/nursing (and maybe old school physicians). increasing profits make bonuses. leads cutting staff, cutting things like laundry blankets/pillows (so nurses run time patients don’t any), cutting needed medical supplies, serving shittiest low quality food possible patients hate, outdated machines broken TIME, re-using PPE, list goes forever things cut bottom line bigger. 

And patients get angry blankets food bad? nurses. nothing supply quality! It’s fucking CEOs admin making cuts affect patient care lower quality. It’s ridiculous. It’s “business” - spend millions marketing billboards zero actual patient care. mean, would kill unvaccinated people likely. probably pay better comment supposed disprove ?  


99,94% US Covid deaths adults. can't prove that. live one country Europe. may true are, mean everywhere else. logic, look around live California say mask compliance US high know that's true. think remember European countries like Netherlands even adopting masks last summer started mandating last April. believe Scandinavian countries even mandates all; I'm sure much they're voluntarily masking. Also, thought said times masks schools never thing are. “Covid cases skyrocketing”. 7k TOTAL whole damn state hospital positive Covid test ok……use scare people more. Mom drop child? china japan heavily invested US healthcar. hospitals, manufacturer’s too. Baxter owned Takeda example, japanese company. I’m honestly expecting masks next summer rate we’re going. Partially surge, partially would look guidance flipped month two later? recently, outbreak confined Greater Sydney Newcastle outside point restrictions. yeah, mask rules outdoors specific - you’re going around people can’t keep 1.5m distance. We’ve offering crazy rates sign bonuses paying doctors rates nursing year it’s gotten better. know everyone likes blame admin, truly situation like this? Hospitals can’t let people die you’re already spending money can, limiting patient intake, requiring overtime staff, Whats left? blame admin happening prior pandemic early it, everything seems happening everywhere regardless great admin is.  different groups people. option large metro ATL county, kids high school vaccinated wanted go back almost year half distance learning. kids younger get vaccinated I'd keep home. adore hot, sweaty cafe job requiring masks employees customers. vaccinated ass literally masking protest anti-vaxxers want served coffee indoors. fucking joke. always thought Alabama crimson tide. Lol. don’t follow college football much NY. It’s thing here. Well, look good funeral!

(When mom died GC sister mall 30 minutes away, shopping jewelry match funeral dress.)  Health insurance US allowed charge higher premiums ACA ongoing habits eating habits, exercise &amp; nutrition (obesity, hypertension) .

They viewed pre-existing disabilities, ruled active health conditions &amp; choices punished rewarded extra premiums &amp; bonuses via ""wellness programs"" health care;money main motivation progress development. way much good could done health care tied profit. Health care human right(USA), sadly death taxes come first. mean? Yes. CEO pay hospitals limited. Even still choice comes portion sizes. Someone orders single cheeseburger, small fries, water McDonalds daily going much better shape physically financially someone orders double quarter pounder cheese, large fry, large Coca Cola every day. Marks says vaccine’s protection generally achieved somewhere seven 14 days second dose.*

So they're encouraging people go outside congregate settings get vaccine effective 6 weeks now. Long wave burns out.

The right advice point isolate absolutely nothing weaken immune system cause injury requires hospital care. It’s tired tHeY’rE MaKiNg pRoFiT subtext that’s ridiculous. they’re pushing booster strengthens efficacy mutation novel virus that’s kicking ass span month? record they’ve saying theres possibility booster long Delta, weren’t paying attention. Nope, probably no-one could done better. likely responsible saving lives anyone US since cold war. Easy. He's running president he's betting strong man talk 'freedom' masks, etc. endear gop voters. know Fox, etc. spin defending state Biden's 'tyranny.' comes numbers, care. many gop voters care either come spin, like 'seasonal' thing, explain away. And, suspect knows eventually lot localities disobey nonsense orders institute safety measures, mitigate cases/deaths ignore masks, etc. point lower numbers say, 'see, seasonal approach right.' That's also frustrating well. essentially get vaccine day places US now. cities there's basically place get every blocks so. Even millions refuse get vaccinated almost spite everyone else forcing us take multiple steps back done this. countries would kill vaccine supply here. Insurance relationship medical business total scam, anything justified, expensive premiums anti-vaxxers justified. definitely run costs get covid.  Smokers already pay more.  6 months 😂 natural immunity even better that, god damn think virus cares feel math. always done. Thank you! happen know what’s point can’t affect hiring? Lol. designed priced health insurance, know?  right thing country would great well. ship sailed long ago due politicizing global pandemic.  fucks sakes could shortened cost less ignorant persons would worn masks, ACTUALLY locked real, fucking vaccinated long ago.  Would get advice fixing car transmission state governor ?  Maybe don’t take medical advice politician paid companies need workers feed machine  stop flogging dead horse.

Fair enough. covid man made signed sinopharm chinese made vaccine?

do computer/cell phone? already microchips recording data could ever want

their actions disprove argument. Well factually incorrect. Averaging 40-60k day outbreaks Public/political pressure. make sense back either. Thanks info! difference getting vaccinated doesn’t matter. point vaccine always prevent hospitalizations, completely eliminate cases. goalposts continue shift. definitely areas it’s opposite (like went target yesterday almost one wearing mask) frequent publix kind gives idea people around us viewing pandemic. Like essentially neighbors. definitely nice see. Mostly two young kids (4 2) 4 year old reluctantly wears mask, 2 year old would rather set fire. appreciate around us taking extra steps. wish everyone would.

And rock “I got fauci ouchie” shirt pride 😂 can't help guilty conscience.

I friend really want see hang anymore, texts always respond really bare minimum, shared passion. anti-vaccine. spoken while, I'm pretty sure he's still anti-vaccine, still hates Gavin Newsom, etc. know drill.

I've saying want hang feel safe world, even though I'm fully vaccinated. truth going out, him. I've going people fully vaccinated, wear masks, believe science. remember last year hung bit wore mask didn't, knew want hang anymore.

The guilty part come ""lying"" him.

It comes knowing maybe would get vaccine said ""I hanging others, we're vaccinated"" ""I hang vaccinated people"" etc. I'm afraid respond: ""If get vaccine, hang out?"" feel like maybe I'm one people could get vaccinated? knows sure, feel like could true.

But truth is, said want around anymore. want ask ""If get vaccine, hang out?"" I'll say yes.

The guilty part comes knowing maybe power prevent getting it, prevent spreading others...

Help. :( lose sense taste smell?? live Australia, locked week, everyone put mask on. meant nothing mask - didn’t inconvenience life all.

And yet here, clearly real world, piece cloth apparently *too much*.  allowed around vaccinated ones start bloody periods Maybe could try understand situation bit better mate

Sydney lockdown fast enough things gotten away them. Three removalists delta travelled Melbourne unloaded truck apartment complex without masks. Spread hit big sporting events. Melbourne locked quickly saw peak 22 cases

Then recently couple mystery cases popped up. quick lockdown contact tracers catch up

Sydney Australia I’ll personally seeking standard Pfizer dose “booster” early next month 250 person marriage go Texas middle September 6 months September 3rd 140 deaths yesterday highlighted alarming - cases point not. cases result hospitalization, let's discuss hospitalization. We're far past point saying case numbers shock one sounding alarm, one going take action slow spread.

This people's fault. want freedom? it. People blame point.  think panic worry point. think take common sense approaches protect point. 

You know like banning masks.  Hopefully majority vaccinated. don’t blame crowd. Knicks ever championship, I’d going crazy too. Unfortunately, I’ll probably die happens lol mild case excellent. yet vaccinated? Lol 500M cases? Americans get double infection day? least dose prepped robot. I'd argue balance governments corporations untrustworthy people general bad critical thinking. Anecdotally, conspiracy theory people know tend tear apart ""official"" anything, even question person questioning. example people get vaccinated, buy every ""Johnny Come Lately"" supplement medication get hands on. turns simply following different golden calf questioning sides. ""I patients denied Covid way intubation,"" said. ""They think cold, think we're lying them.""

Wow started fully recovered started getting better. even rejoined work( wfh) thinking could take boy wrong. stopped tv, laptop, phone, screen hour bedtime give chance sleeping without panicking.  20,000+ daily cases *and* rewarding children idiotic parents putting children risk *and* Miami-Dade employees must vaccinated.

Sounds like Florida.  School Vouchers allow send kid district school apply towards payment private school tuition. So, lets say live ""liberal"" city local school child would going street encourages masks. Well, good old Governor DeSanitize allow access program send another school mask mandate. Yeah exactly lol feels hard know what/where find good information Pbbbbt! 4th Wave!? never left 1st I'm seeing. guess know tell that's actual number people United States works Yeah I'm saying kids always fine get it. would like see percentages outcomes start worrying. right, misunderstanding saying completely agree preventable nature tragic deaths Unvaccinated Americans. 

Where disagree, feel mind keeps going last sentence. People need take damn vaccine far US concerned would over.

I see finality majority even able US population vaccinated. lot discussion today surrounding breakthrough cases transmission among vaccinated individuals? goes back said endemics humanities history dealing global disease eradication. think statements like lead disappointment irrational causalities (IE.

US worldwide. Vaccine proves amazingly effective covid hospitalizations. Yup, traveled ID past week CDC revised guidance.

With exception Sun Valley (resort town attracts lots Californians), saw total 3 masks probably 1,000+ people.

I think gotta realize lots U.S. done COVID restrictions, probably surprising originated there, like surprising variant started brazil, one italy, one UK, one florida, etc etc etc wherever lot people get sick mutations.

that said, tons misinformation origins genetically predisposed, possibly, I'd like show numbers claim genetics major cause obesity. again, that's contagion, that's genetics, safe effective vaccine existed it, pretty sure there'd large uptake. friend groups, correlation may exist people gravitate towards people feel comfortable with, imply causation obesity. prove point relevance wrt Insurance premiums.

American Academy Peds. 

Is larger pool unvaccinated kids comparison rest population. sure something it. impact kids, significantly larger number getting know yet. point really dumb say kids fine get it. planned first trip friends months ago, I'm doubting decision go forward high spread area weekend. Half trip outdoors, remainder bars/restaurants indoors, nobody else group wife/kids. worry bringing home breakthrough case spreading household non sure enjoy trip mind. 6 month pregnant wife fully vaxed moderna daughter two. We're around 30 healthy. Thought? vaccines lower probability symptomatic infection.. Maybe I’m social worker. lifting, standing day, running laps anything. making life death decisions. 

Edit clarity Read see feel children No, trial protocol. results trials published, find online. data FDA required EUAs data required approval, except efficacy data six months required approval. trial results preprint now. findings two month data. don’t want hurt feelings worse inhibit ability mindlessly harm others. remove kids comorbidities

Ah yes, children really important. know medicine works. It’s fine good obligation, they’re already turning people away lack space resources. triage system eventually put place don’t room. Either that, first come first serve doesn’t seem fair point. Shits going anywhere unless stockpile 16 billion vaccines give entire world time. 

This virus continue mutate poor countries time enough vaccinated. covid 2.0 vaccine give rich countries another mutation appears poor countries. cases happen, even test, positive yesterday. announced yesterday.

So far, 7,872 people reported tested positive yesterday. figure increase next day two testing data comes in, certainly possible could go 30K. yet.

The two days (the 2nd 3rd) far 28.562 26,295 positive tests recorded them.

The daily announced figures best way keep track total number positive tests. they're far less good way identifying trends, mixture tests happened several days - days complete others. instance, Wales announce cases Saturdays - mean daily cases Saturday, never get announced day. Every Sunday Monday, there's unsurprising peak announcements catch up. Well honestly tested. think awareness goes lot assumptions. ...huh? randomly cause problems reason? would that? never initiate conversation. It’s inpatient fatality rates necessarily climb. make decisions otherwise would not. instance last wave 85 year old woman covid. taking turn worse. spoke extensively family ICU care best her. Transfer ICU would take away nurses knew. would take away flowers pictures would around bed. TV ICU bed. point would likely become agitated, someone would either tie bed sedate her. Either way, going end one way 

Or could decide transfer her. nurses come know would there. balloons would table side. again, would end one way. I’m sure downvoted much.

I terrified long covid kids, home schooled remote learned last year, isn’t option coming year. article seems well balanced informative. Basically, doctors seeing long covid kids probably signs depression lock fatigue cases. Long covid kids exist, numbers think many kids seriously mentally effected. would love keep kids home vaccinated, isn’t going happen current set up, I’m hoping called hobbies men. 

*Hobbies males think need paraphernalia man ""Clarification: post updated specify Walensky referencing fully vaccinated people get breakthrough infection saying vaccines longer prevent transmission Covid-19."" 

Not sure makes statement better??

Vaccination far reliable. want initiate conversation. one Texas bound anything, unfortunately. It’s recommendation teeth thanks Abbott. er Fort Lauderdale suffering anaphylaxis didn’t even get triaged busy Covid patients. fortunate didn’t die fairness CDC, headline completely context. continue work well Delta, regard severe illness death – prevent it. can't anymore prevent transmission.” maybe weird thing stop surprised ebb flow virus know social responsibility wear masks times rampant spread, even though personal risk might well mitigated vaccination.

We need irrationally declare something over, simply tired certain background layer anxiety, alternately can't accept finished risk, unknown future.

We also know wearing mask ego virility, signal acquiescence totalitarianism anymore sneezing elbow rather someone's face. good sense.

Then go back masks change behaviors. moment catharsis, desperate declare over, us, paranoid need happy ending. know indeed come back, can't, can't locally. It'll instead ending war, rubble, millions lost, recognition brooks learning hopefully, joy.

Oh, kidding?  Try millions. hundreds thousands seriously ill thousands dead. lot less catastrophic without vaccination certainly drop bucket.   made laugh harder lmao NYC worst it. still bodies stored temp morgues spring 2021 people died 2020. unclaimed others waiting back log buried. NYC kinda shit together. FL TX not. least admitted wrong? Now, DeSantis. DeSantis blaming illegal border crossings state Juno Covid cases despite nowhere near border. No, I’m saying everyone can. Including getting vaccine. 5 months me. 

I willing take 3rd dose soon available. really. Deaths Vietnam reported chunks, ranging days weeks, often days. It’s best use seven day moving average, Thailand 158 Vietnam 246. Fuck FL, pull funding. Thanks clarifying lambda, local newspaper posted fearmongering article morning saying 'resistant vaccines' (with qualifier whether meant 'somewhat' 'highly' 'fully resistant') I'd panicking day, worried I've since last March. Weird. got headache tired shots. Never really got sick totally able function. Florida another wave still worse states north east.

And know it’s coming, perhaps try something instead declaring like DeSantis shut daily testing fought sort public awareness efforts. friend side effects either dose Moderna, reactions *both* shots, including rare ""Covid Arm"".

It's weird. No, I’m tx-36 includes Jasper, Tyler, Chambers Liberty counties nothing common Clear Lake/NASA area I’m at. Crenshaw’s district TX-02 got etched district ever! even legal. unfortunately it’s Texas Democrats reality.  Pretty sure trump tried sanctuary cities maybe even another thing federal court system said no. would expect would occur Pizza parties don’t make years understaffing underpay? I’m shocked… incentive . People waved random piece paper got great hear! Thank you!  think keep mind average Lolla attendee probably lot places could even easily exposed event too. Like packed trains airports, bars, restaurants, etc. Maybe sack tell like him. Years shitty pay, safe staffing rations, pizza parties used lieu actual help/changes, adding third covid wave 18 months…really bad time patient southern hospital. Nurses fleeing left right. sad. condolences family. urged caution.

You urge caution open, it’s entire North East live right now, fully open cautious watching cases, complete denial hiding facts like FL. Vaccines don’t prevent transmission vaccinated people *with breakthrough infections*. Seems fair.  Keep Florida. Wanna go “muh freedoms?” Feel free pay roads interstates. takes 36 hours get Disney world you’ll change mind vote for. 40 landed hospital yesterday alone Florida... I’m gonna err good people I’m optimist like that. Anecdotal, crossed state lines get 3rd pfizer. 5 days now, side effects second shot. 

I teacher florida extremely worried students returning classroom masks optional layman's terms, ACE2 stands angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

That word, ""layman""... think means think means. Nice see least people climb Foxholes. data isn’t preliminary good data take common sense approaches protect unvaccinated children. mean wearing mask really isn’t difficult. Hard believe 45. looks 65. eating Hot Pockets last 20 years? kind extreme headline? article sounds like idea transmitted point it’s possible happened car way event place near it. Maybe I’m missing something though. You’re broken.

I didn’t say UK put restrictions, said clear going ways combat it, giving citizens full set tools make proper choices, 180° DeSantis done Florida denying there’s anything issue even hospitals past full. photo ok? lost mine I’m freaking out. MIL died day idea put shit pretty screwed time… pandemic ended many friendships. may one them. 

Tell don’t. Ultimately it’s decision he’s clearly already made it. reward based honor system reward based tangible proof action two different things. That's difference stimulus reward vs letting people take masks hoping everyone abides advisory. ""I feeling ... vaccinated, hospitalized,"" Matzen said.

Yeah, shit. Prior Delta think pretty defensible actually worked fine. Many people thought would immediate (relatively speaking, weeks spread) big spike socialization occur all. Delta changed game though.  Lived three years! Go Dawgs! edited titles. Better suited daily discussion. Every time hear boosters makes wonder better worse get initial 2 Pfizer jabs June rather March April. long really take immunity wear off? sharp drop gradual? relative rule like +6 months last jab, us got jabs late end needing booster right winter. I'll hit exactly 6 months since 2nd jab Xmas Day. Mississippi. state makes Texas feel better itself. Devils advocate:

If we're vaccines, dont scale general self inflicted health issues. want fitness tests lower insurance costs. shouldnt pay people willingly inflicting heart disease themselves, putting holes lungs etc. 

Seriously, talking thing here. Health insurance scaling potential RISK put at. 

We go further, increased cost riding street bike, playing sports, living mudslide zone. 


Anyway, ya'l might think good idea might want see fallout implications policies 7 person family (6 vaccinated) (1 young vaccination) 4/7 us tested positive last week. rough man. asshole Governors threaten pulling funds school districts want mask up. seems fair Feds pull funds states. funds could cut would piss Governors hurting citizens? Federal golf course subsidies? 🤔 That’s far cry complete lack proper communication going on.

You open, inform citizens reality situation encourage masking distancing open.

DeSantis none that. There’s huge opportunity human error. ask husband bizarre string letters used first name EZ Pass system. It’s like didn’t common name boys 30 years. miniscule chance vaccinated people, I'm happy take risk get normal life back First right right life. without that, rights meaningless. Leaving pandemic go wild violating individual rights not.  Fat chance Florida give us something like see here!

Problem spike antibody test it’s known level correlates protection, doesn’t address memory B cell function cell function. words, doesn’t tell significant risk is. Antibodies measured that’s measured practically.  perfect, thanks mate preliminary data PHE shows thing. haven’t seen published study yet definitively shows delta less dangerous. Indications large national reporting databases however. makes sense. South Korea seen opposite, 3(?) blood clotting deaths, men 30s - vaccinated soldiers early on, people aged 30 eligible. Nah mainly personality surrogate. Mine pretty rough even first one, thought would better one second. Nope, pretty rough times, second way worse. Completely fine day though. Wow! helpful comment. helpful us severely struggling anxiety depression this. 
/s always obvious transmission can't stopped 100%. fact vaccines stop transmission provably false.

Yes, agree -- said would walk back mean sarcastically. course without vaccines, current minimal restrictions, virus would spreading even faster is. want either. believe healthcare right, extra money buy extra health care access.  realize almost country gets right. Yikes late now.  I’m sure easy way distinguish. home rapid tests pretty nice quick check concerned. Probably cold, unless around people may infected. called reacting rapidly changing situation. thinking strong suit, hurt trying comprehend that. CDC say encourage vaccinated mask also encouraging unvaccinated get shots? get tested ask physician probably least sought FAANGs known worst benefits like PTO well general worklife balance. said, definitely actively sought company work for, esp new grads.  Unvaccinated Adults morons Yeah thing I’m 29 year old male. 

It’s becoming commonly reported. *taps head* know? would even measure waste?

Government programs famous ""use lose it"" budgets. essentially encourages wasteful spending. denied care suffer consequences arrogance/ignorance. happening lot June. many colds testing negative covid He. AZ first shot sicker felt since stomach flu laying floor contemplating death.   unable sleep chills fever crazy aches migraine.

If refuse vax send back.

Re; accepted? approved destination country. information would realized travelers departure. like requirements now.


It's rocket science. Wow, super helpful table! Thank you! think KN95 would fall here? Maybe surgical N95? immune response makes COVID dangerous. virus damage, immune system responding infection. Inflammatory markers go roof. steroid dampens inflammatory response.

Actually saw patient recently COVID also turned undiagnosed advanced AIDS. COVID barely touched immune system mount response. co-infections AIDS serious threats. Interesting hell. find profession doesn’t allow put people harm.  appropriate comparison would rates myocarditis among vaccinated people vs unvaccinated people, including limited catch Covid.

Because that’s really decision people make: net risk vaccinated vs net risk unvaccinated, latter guarantee catching Covid.

Comparing myocarditis rates vaccines vs Covid deceptive implicitly assumes anyone vaccinated guaranteed catch virus. Yes, many times lifetime?

We'll getting vaccines every year. that's, what, 5 vaccines five years? many times catch COVID timeframe? 2x, 3x? 

The logical way think would per year basis. Getting vaccine booster year, similar flu? chances getting COVID next round.

As aside, stayed home year none us (with good luck, masking, social distancing) COVID antibodies.  benefits boarders still open? Ah, they’re fucking stupid. makes sense. 15% vaccinated? tell you?

we already know unvaccinated going get sicker...that's news...my concern vaccinated ones... Healthcare workers required vaccines precisely reason. sore throat awful nothing ibuprofen couldn’t help with. although hurt eat sucked. cough non stop three days. chills muscle joint pain/aches two days. couldn’t bring leave bed/couch two days. pulse ox oxygen levels never went 98 thankfully. pretty awful manageable already get flu shot every year. I’m also coward though so…   California—colleges especially  Probably less likely get delta. nasal lung 🫁 immunity Nah think funny get it. think people dying second round raising alarms since republican areas Ok I’ll admit said it’s meant countries access vaccines. don’t get either.

Someone somewhere always going something say someone’s weight (particularly person woman). it’s us know *healthy* is. Low risk? 10% end ME/CFS “long covid” many 15 million americans chronic fatigue syndrome virus, painful debilitating lifelong disease cure treatment. 40% SARS survivors it. virus cousin, SARS-CoV-2 10% come it. totally glossed over. We’ve known predicted since last year. don’t know shit false “long covid” insult, director NINDS NIH, equivalent Fauci, said expect cases ME/CFS virus. …in Texas i'm aviation worker, got covid ""covid hoax"" co-worker long hauler honestly i'm 100% vaccination requirements. plenty jobs require it. military requires it. medical professionals require it. seems like solid safety component. plenty jobs anyone like it. many healthcare workers burned quitting. trying help people help basic step getting life saving vaccine. Kids released holiday lifted (freedom day) restrictions less dense spread amongst age group. can’t explain someone uneducated. aren’t going believe matter say retort “long term 5 years, 10 years…” may right, personally don’t know. you’re trying convince someone doesn’t want get vaccine, feel like devil know argument better.

These people people believe microchips it, Mercury “toxins”, it’s activated 5G. narcissists think way get narcissist try reason hit effects them.

I appreciate information. Good know - could misremembering group, thought something JWs blood transfusions assumed they’d weird immunizations, too. get collect double mileage points? expected serological antibody studies. Beta evasive variant far, compared anything else always better.

This could probably said mRNA vaccines well. like family planning? cuttlefish. Yes, read elsewhere research says probably evade neutralizing antibodies. means catch immune system can’t fight all. Vaccines won’t work lambda evade immune system. 

This makes social distance, strict mask wearing, frequent sanitization important. 

The hope left lambda specific antiviral, speed virus mutating, drug resistance higher drug efficacy probably won’t last long. Like 2009 pandemrix influenza vaccine?  people pay food

this definitely will, board haha LGBT person here: got vaxxed soon could! can't wait kid get vaxxed, too. unvaccinated areas country (USA) infected areas. That’s seeing play real time. I’ve several people put vaccine go get last week… hope it’s late them. wish younger kids could get vaccinated. It’s shame exposed areas (poor) choices others.  think you’re misunderstanding. Lockdown promotes unhealthy, sedentary lifestyles. daily step count reduction *global* study, can’t pin unhealthy Americans. turns out, lockdown leads sorts terrible health outcomes. even like Jehovah's Witnesses? sitting pretty one highest vaccination rates world. probably 4th wave, going come close breaking us. Happy proud Canadian can’t differing opinion scientific fact. That’s works. They're forced, drive destination want. veil patriotism. join army better option. Also get federal $ grants go shitty overpriced colleges, graduate useless skill end working Amazon warehouse shipping swiffer sweepers fat suburban housewives. state actually fairly well vaccinations keeping cases overall. obesity definitely factor, I'm guessing, county live would probably offer insight likelihood they're vaxxed There's many variables play give vaccination many people. think would largely unfair put burden complete safety individual even authorities they've essentially year monitor it. may think there's going severe unforeseen effects, can't certain given maybe think odds good enough play around with. me. Especially know serious side effects vaccines much rare that, covid infection produces effects vaccination does, higher rate.

I agree. individual find data available unappealing terms risk, can't see problem get vaccinated. time, think statistically significant enough warrant Governmental societal pressure. That's I'm here, find statistical significance makes sense it. Ridiculous. Um, guys unload cylinder truck put regulator it? There’s way much editorializing IMO. need constantly-updated cheat sheet numbers, numbers. many commentators picking choosing convey. Often it’s done either downplay/exaggerate vaccine efficacy downplay/exaggerate Covid risk. put CDC category untimely data sets.  Yeah, Catholic Church come pretty strongly side vaccination.

It's *obligatory* Catholics, encouraged, religious reason refuse it. vaccine type issue typically seen within 30 days receiving it. extremely rare vaccine side effects later on. KF94 high standards too. research indicates delta [1.5-3 3x research found change age distribution. 

Vaccines tremendous confounding factor acts drop CFR skew deaths toward less vaccinated (younger) age groups. Controlling age hard. case kids, yes. case immunocompromised, no, cases.

Someone poor immune system less protected vaccine. get that, also big difference knowing comorbidities word actually knowing means (and using right context, too).

People also using ""HIPPA"" means sound intelligent. spelling error context generally gives away idea they're talking about.

I'm guessing someone uses word comorbidities sentence, makes sense contextually, spelled right, may actually genuine 80-90% time. (Making numbers naturally.)

Of course, could also wrong. happened before. strike word stupid people would use (correctly) normal conversation. Unjustified complacency old alpha-variant thinking issue also dangerous.

It's clearly better over-react possibility widespread infection spread vaccinated people under-react (""that smell smoke? I'm sure nothing!""). one find proof this?? want copied ready go I'm challenged friend, here.

I'm law clerk attend court hearings regularly, that's lot contact I'm worried I'm fully vaccinated. NP clarity... data long term effects particular vaccine: none. 

Long term effects occur chemical builds system. means we'd know vaccine occur matter months. vaccines - especially mRNA ones - literally disappear system quickly, getting broken enzymes. teach body potential threat defend it. That's it. 

Vaccines general long term effects ones different. We've people vaccinated year now. also makes really sad see many people know/love panicking basically reason.

Is antithetical living well functioning society ACTUALLY protecting kids public health crisis? Yes. 

But,   want point something mentioned enough. variants come countries. say mutation occur USA, certainly could, shows pandemic almost everyone world vaccinated. countries, due lack access vaccines, vaccination rates even teens yet. trying negative, cases UK longer dropping cliff, they're plateauing. Hopefully continue drop though, would welcome news entire world! news sub, replies reasonably informed. There's probably faq around every single piece misinformation rebutted. **reported** cases..   Less tourism? delta foothold yet? High antibodies waves? details de little different country/region.  Thanks! hate second guessing myself! Yes sooner later become norm unvaccinated scared needles would rather live fear. though? There’s surge happening rest world, Romania one countries affected. Yeah, tell people agree new surge Delta variant. honestly matter time breakthrough infection becomes breakthrough infection vaccine-resistant strain. also, banning mask ndates, pulled funding penalty. course deserves blame one link. heard week two ago NPR, expert vaccines in, confirming likely timeline. Might able find websight. Thanks information!  R value measure case spread though hospitalization rate kids matter. Based another comment either deleted sub flagged it, spreading misinformation it’s highly dangerous. I’m living fear, I’m following credited medical advice care family kids people. 

It really feels like trying stir drama one time that.

Nope, walk family practice, cvs walgreens. negatives. Employer require got tested came back though. like purging fire purging world idiots  would've gotten two even Covid prior. Getting 2nd dose Sunday never Covid though. Country manufactures disinformation can't control disinformation. Shocker. times like relieved children. need get vaccines approved kids ASAP. going vary wildly across country. 50% total population, paint whole story. going wind major pockets highly vaccinated pockets not. Ok, thanks. I'm still confused though - Anthrax spread person-to-person. Neither Malaria tropical diseases remember. COVID, hand, major threat military preparedness.  whole thought everyone can, wants to, online learning fall.

But that's fine!

If kids online:

1. puts less kids physical school building
2. allows easier social distancing  

making safer kids go person. Dealing person needs hospitalized ship expensive. noone blame yourself. Anecdotal obviously, vaccinated (2nd shot) mid April, got Covid late May. symptomatic 10 days hospitalized sure considered ""mild"" feel mild. Good work! I'm glad it.

Don't give excuses options. today day shot, get car open front door RIGHT NOW. put auto pilot. worst part experience anything happens. sooner get shot, sooner dread pit stomach goes away.

I was, still large part, WRECK shot. I'm dizzy pale anything happens usually pass out. Afterwards, usually take rest day couch. sucks, I'm better 30s 20s. it, it.

I'm happy talk anyone vaccinated reason -- privately. I'll help. higher community's vaccination rate is, breakthrough cases make larger percentage. works. treat unvaccinated. Treat real emergencies. Sorry hear. Lung issues joke. Hope gets feeling better! data percentage hospitalizations vaccinated/unvaccinated? Infections going isn’t surprising antibodies vaccine wear off, cell (?) memory prevent severe illness death much longer, unless individual immunocompromised old. Still can't come response comes next?

You're trying warn us something's coming, even know is? Good, go fly Spirit. Mask mandates delayed RSV, cycles every year like influenza. 

Protecting kids Covid protected RSV. didn’t increase spread. pushed back. 

What you’re saying makes much sense *“I didn’t get chlamydia stopped using condoms; obviously using condoms left vulnerable getting STDs.”*   haven’t made clear, agree points.

My original comment really geared towards folks say schools closed (something don’t think really public discourse, see pretty frequently Reddit). 

I imagine might disagree whether send kids school (I’m position, imagine likely would), certainly agree states provide remote options families able pick whatever works best them.  I've done 1, I'm 2 3, expect people agree me. Reddit real life. fever definitely sign infection.... go get tested!  Yeah, I’m confident either. People mention rare breakthrough infections are, really know rare vaccinated people aren’t getting tested regularly? It’s possible significant amount asymptomatic infections (and thus transmissions) happening without anyone aware it.

Genuinely trying generate doubt vaccine say everyone lock down, really want informed precautions take interest public health. haha long teach creationism would fine Qatar better Vax program using mrna (87% eligible 74% total) R still 1.

As woes, self inflicted  all-or-nothing. know vaccinated people spread (and get infected spread normally), vaccinated reduce chance infected current variants. one mutation developed ignores infection probability reduction, would thrive better others: that's pressure.

The cruise company, resumed sailing American ports Carnival Vista’s July 3 excursion, operates Vista sister ship Carnival Breeze weekly cruises port Galveston.

The cruises allowed CDC regulations give operators two options resume sailing: perform simulated cruises test COVID-19 protocols, ensure 98 percent crew 95 percent passengers vaccinated. Carnival pursued second option, allowing vaccinated guests go mask-less onboard requiring small number unvaccinated guests pay health fees obtain travel insurance.

But vaccines may longer mean COVID-free cruise, especially delta variant coronavirus drives resurgent pandemic breakthrough infections among vaccinated. Onboard Vista, tested positive isolated contact traced, according Carnival spokesperson immediately confirm number cases. Vista finish cruise, added.

In response cases, cruise line also adopting policy requiring masks indoor areas, spokesperson confirmed.  realized 6yo memories involve Covid everything says is... virus even typically, virus gone, xyz?? honestly pretty heartbreaking. Sadly Florida Gubernatorial recall mechanisms.

Because servicemember cannot quit like private employee can, can’t leave don’t want vaccine, full approval nothing.

But can’t mandate vaccine it’s approved. cool.

and yes, reporting accurately. peak 40k tests per day, 10k positives. capacity there.

edit: questions, i'll glad answer Exactly. Every year U.S., 58,000 children age 5 hospitalized due RSV infection, from 100 500 die. virus also kills 14,000 older adults every year.  Let take court overturn it. It'll take couple months argue least would bought time. really need political except executive level. Hell Trump kept tax records hidden two years letting take court it. That's country operates. really matter people think illegal not, make tell illegal. worst tell can't anymore. Better idiots mask get vaccines.

I'm glad worried long term health outcomes child. Must freeing. Unfortunately, government agents, myself, easily able find people, consider form neglect reportable. 

Any particular country area want see hospitalization numbers for? can't promise they're currently available yet numbers access authorized give, area, definitely paint picture. honestly care want go believing unvaccinated somehow hospitalized less often. given important task, contacting states child services. see part 90% pilots 80% FAs vaccinated? fear-mongering.

“Misconduct defined unemployment statute pretty serious wrongdoing. It’s carelessness, it’s negligence, it’s poor performance. pretty serious intentional,”

I guess depends whatever governing body control deciding whether refusing vaccinations count misconduct.

What thoughtful response. would thought way, suspect many good teachers did. Crippling permanent illness possible virus, know.  I’m anti-vax person mandate this? shouldn’t able ask medical history legally. really want know allowed. proves you’re lucky. two unvaccinated family members vents covid Texas right now. Huh, anyways... antivaxxers die Covid there, impact rest them, like USA assume murdered government something like that? pay also shit.  Basically almost everyone vaccinated able spread like now. Knock racist crap. born Japan live Thailand. I'm asshole anything, mixing Peru went SinoPharm instead Sinovac. study found Sinovac well vs Lambda included samples Peru, well other, Sinovac dependent friends talking president issuing nationwide lockdown, least nationwide *encouragement* lockdown, next week two. evidence base supposedly consists leaked internal reports. like lockdown, convinced going happen.

What tell people? They're obviously talking asses. always, anti vaxxers self solving problem They’ll pay twice really go thick like ICU nurse did. she/he said, you’re likely get ptsd (actual, possibly debilitating ptsd) conditions bad. Yes [the jury still find difference viral loads comparing unvaccinated individuals vaccine “breakthrough” infections. Furthermore, individuals vaccine breakthrough infections frequently test positive viral loads consistent ability shed infectious viruses. results, preliminary, suggest vaccinated individuals become infected delta variant, may sources SARS-CoV-2 transmission others.  What’s projection again? Like end year?  Exactly Yes! sons pediatrician 2 different entrances 2 different set nursing staff one works sick side one routine care side shut classroom sanitizing? it’s summer kids don’t spend time indoors large numbers point year.

It’s highly likely explode population move indoors fact they’re unvaccinated whole. wouldn’t surprised see another mutation targets children effectively schools start simply that’s last group zero resistance virus. free put want body. You’re free put want body work United Airlines. 

Your body autonomy doesn’t overrule United’s right vaccinated workforce. one forcing work United, you’re welcome go work another company doesn’t require vaccinations (until, course, also start requiring vaccinations, right well). Considering demanding abusive hospital jobs I'm surprised. Working insane hours, schedule change dime, expectation always ready work made hard everyone field covid. believe shit nurses put hospitals expect I've worked retail service jobs. super toxic industry.   ton medical issues past year people skipped routine doctors appointments fear exposure. know pediatric world upset many parents skipped children’s vaccine appointments meaning kids behind normal vaccine schedule. would absolutely go medical dental appointment case catch something.  Probably Emily Kent, parent toddler works speech language pathologist, among protesting outside the provincial legislature Thursday.

That's impressive toddler Cool, neighbor's whole family, including children, currently hospital COVID. 

The dad currently high flow O2 upset get vaccinated. mom probably would too, sedated intubated. There’s always “but wait, there’s more!” guys go bowling twice week pick furthest lanes others wear masks entire time. exposed step-niece unvaccinated dropped kid watch experiencing myriad symptoms didn’t tell days later.  Nah, I’ve around emergency medicine long enough see great work :)   know. frustrating, especially considering easily high schools mandate vaccines done it. They've available 12 ups *months.*

It's getting difficult cope, personally. pandemic physical health, mental health too. stories Reddit nurses quit went work traveling agencies. Placed back home hospital making 2-3x old co-workers.

My mom this. Every 13wk contract gets signing bonus too, plus travel nurses limited contract many hours work many patients take (unlike staff worked death). masking know it. way COVID spreads, people asked ""distance"" well US, really exact guidance we're supposed always comes back making people stay isolated.

No one wants talk seeing even fully vaccinated friends family indefinitely everyone fights masks instead. Reminds lot said enjoying SPH orders, cared going Applebee's. Exactly this. many people total many people vaccinated? 

Let's look two hypotheticals, pull numbers place anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers pull (the difference being, numbers purely explanatory, perverse attempt gotcha):

We two conferences going on, B, 100 people attendance each. Conference 95% vaccination rate conference B 10% vaccination rate.

Conference 10 people catch Covid, conference B 20 people catch it. both, vax/unvaxed percentage cases 50%. conference A, that's big concern means vaccine still showing roughly 95% efficacy rate, whereas vaccinated conference sure bet get it. However, percentage conference B would worrisome, shows vaccine better vaccine. Aside that, we'd also want know many cases severe versus minor, even conference B's case, vaccinated minor symptoms versus unvaccinated, would still point toward vaccinating.

Unfortunately, sorts stories circulated, present crucial bit information. Instead, hear ""Ah-ha! 74% getting event vaccinated! vaccine working!""

(Note, I'm saying that's OP necessarily doing, that's Facebook experts talk radio parrots doing) see older nurses learn hospital system somewhere 10 years so, reluctant move learn entirely new system. think increase pay would worth hassle though. fish-out-of-water lasts months. point masking distancing sustainable long term. need get back normal life point. point forever. stop, immune naïve individuals get infected long enough time horizon. kids already eligible vaccine taking it, going mask distance forever? end game? passengers  mind asking, parents go back pre-pandemic activities like maskless non-distanced indoor activities/events etc.? friend’s eldest son needle phobia he’s seeing therapist since well covid. got vaccine last week. “practicing” getting jabbed needle home days leading vax. younger brother able get right away.

I know extreme, somehow way thinking. Yeah. vaccine made prevent this, probably going see bunch people die. Even vaccinated, lot people get sick. thing useless ""news"" CNN ""news"" _about_ CNN. Except administer anxiolytic giving IV. can't pharmacy get vaccine. 

And someone says ""well take go"". people extreme syncope point like seizure simple fainting spell. Also existing heart condition severe syncope go cardiac arrest. Mask *usage* mask *mandates* two separate issues.

If wondering mask *usage*, that's probably going last end time. People want wear masks forever wear masks forever that's want, there's nothing stop them.

On hand, mask *mandates* I'm really sure about. asked question one month ago probably would've confident small chance returning, barring cautious regions, Delta play lot localities reinstated mask mandates, I'm sure. Unfortunately, might stick around transportation, healthcare, education settings end 2022. fair, talking covid risks kids lower. 247 &lt;15 year olds died covid according stats. I’d imagine died car accidents, point would stand. Irregardless lifestyle...?

Isn't true health cases much better risk vaccine side effects mode hazardous disease?   3 deaths entire state pretty low. I’m parent it’s awful. mean, it’s true can’t stay locked forever. Child abuse suicides also real dangers.  Internet ""With best possible solutions problems"" code whoever gives money. 

Lord knows Greg Abbott degree public health. Essentially, doctor drafted Louisiana’s “crisis standards care” decade ago afraid actually used.

Seems bit ahead reality thought I'd post it. purposefully misled drug manufacturers efficacy vaccines prevent transmission. trials ""case"" positive pcr test \*and\* least one symptom. measure positive pcr test efficacy numbers would much lower (around 50%?). 
See article:  


""The study defined case someone positive test result least one symptom.""

 
Why? convince everyone herd immunity possible vaccines \*everyone\* needs vaccinated, vulnerable. sell vaccines, duh.

The vaccines extremely effective preventing hospitalization death, numbers correct. can't get us herd immunity can't eliminate virus world. used protect vulnerable. Healthy people low risk, especially healthy children take misguided herd immunity goal. need determined family doctors based comorbidity factors. would leave vaccines provide vulnerable people around world. 
We live virus, choice. really thought “healthy size” stuff would stop learned vulnerable obesity makes covid, feel like one learned anything live healthier. 

How many “but he/she healthy!” see really big, healthy. 

At rate, isn’t kids. sickening tragedy. 

Parents need wake fuck up. really wish articles screaming vaccinated people viral loads unvaccinated Delta would go this. Yes, could - vaccinated people, virus could dying already due vaccine it’s job, therefore vaxxed people don’t spread Covid like unvaxxed people. messaging around been…. mess. Right? term ""long covid"" seem exist vaccine came out. never hear ""long flu"" ""long pneumonia"" completely possible.

It's like people sub cheering absolute worst outcomes matter slim chances are. still think vaccines going way ... unfortunately help natural immunity.

And say 'serious threat' I'm pretty much talking financial. harsh sounds $$$ going drive thing. $$$ another reason think vaccines uptake going increase. people $$$ ready already starting let displeasure felt. last admin was… 🤔 Yes, peak probably coming sometime next couple weeks USA trends similar UK. hopefully things start declining.  peak probably 10 times higher would everyone got vaccinated, almost completely self created problem. be, isn't.  sure, Pfizer/moderna recommended approved ages taken health officials across globe. 

I'm sure point hypothetical is. Inject drugs fired. someone forced school get vaccinated I'm people tell put body think free put want body ""We've tried nothing we're options!"" could directly responsible surge vaccinations. Unfortunately decisions made state level authorities like Greg Abbott really number things. Local leaders major metro areas like Dallas, Houston Austin want/wanted badly keep things like mask mandates occupancy limits place, Abbott made couldn’t. Things really going implode weeks school starts. Schools can’t mask mandates according TEA parents still send kids school even they’ve notified they’ve exposed covid. I’m glad able get 2nd shot, agree PP suggested reporting first Walgreens corporate misinformation. I’m sorry loss Dad. Hi, something understand. phase 3 already completed? read done beginning 2023 Isn’t truth? WFH never option many us. district superintendent sent email couple weeks ago saying weren’t going notify us, previously did, many students contracted virus. flipped shit. wrote another email week later saying heard us reporting numbers now. There’s lot Abbott obtuse bullshit, ‘not required’ ‘required’ two different things. Fight crumbs we’ve given.

why news? think misunderstand, could help me? thought phase 3 trials still ongoing. true? think still experimental. What's difference monitoring trial participants vs. trials continuing? Hospitalization rates lag behind infection rates. 4-6 weeks tell story regarding hospitalizations. Without getting philosophical, words hold meaning.

To promote, actively encouraging supporting decision. words, provide added incentive(s).

To pressure, coercing intimidating individual making decision. words, taking things away.

The introduction Delta US meant every state, even best-vaccinated ones, would eventually see become dominant strain also see *some* sort rise infections. That's virulent strains work. Well, Northeast indeed seen increases, they've much milder South terms new infections even better terms new hospitalizations.  
One possible explanation ""Delta made yet."" Well, apparently has. *is* Delta spike we're experiencing now, going well. 
The explanation I've seen floating around summer hotter South people retreat indoors air conditioning. dunno that, though. New Yorkers spend plenty time indoors regardless weather. There's also super high population density, public transit, sorts stuff pulls people together moreso South Midwest. 
It's almost though getting vaccine wearing masks indoors works. (Yes, people NYC still mostly wear masks inside, even absolutely required to.) 5000+ deaths per million population. average EU 1000-2000. absolutely shocking. Lol can’t. company came yesterday said they’re going start requiring vaccinations well. company healthcare provider I’m web developer doesn’t leave house. 

But I’m curious would use religious exemption. I’d assume one haven’t heard either way since came yesterday us. 16 eligible vaccine. article doesn’t appear mention got not. I’ll make assumption. local hospital actually appointments conditions 2020 assume still year, approach definitely works. points 2 3, reason believe COVID ever end, vaccine good enough justify measures permanently. point, realize living requires risk. delta variant (and arguable even it) risk vaccination people probably good ever gonna get, life return. know people say make risk ourselves, others. However, literally everytime get behind wheel, risk trivial risk killing others. There's way eliminate risks life. everyone gonna get vaccinated gets vaccinated (a sizeable amount never will) get life.  Spending protecting small risk way live. Asshole immediately impeached shit.

Assoc Prof. Mak asked caution countries, children “have done well” required care ICU.


So, studies done starting March last year.

It's clear entire timeframe is? sure accounts Delta variant we're seeing changes war completely viral loads ~1,000x higher. People getting sicker, faster. people arent happy look love commenting people look. ive noticed common people aged 30-55. vaccinations personal choice!!

Gullible assclowns killing people. unvaccinated scared needles would rather live fear. require employees airline treat us customers human beings would nice. good 👍🏾 move United. Big box, area high vax%. Yup grandparents knew least people polio, measles whooping cough back day, know anyone these.

I'm white dude deep South, means entire family hardcore conservatives. older aunts uncles got vaccinated soon could, surprised me, considering politicized everything is. younger cousins avoiding getting vaccinated.

What said absolutely said it. oldest uncle would middle school first started giving polio vaccines said came school one day, lined everyone up, gave shots. Everyone got one. 

They watched vaccines got nearly eradicate polio, something plagued them. Even ones young old enough live time ton people iron lungs, yet something worry vaccinated.

So, yea, literally saw vaccines almost completely away terrible disease, glad see thing happen covid happily got vaccine.  makes sense. private company. allowed protect employees customers. Good them. believe ""should"" comes people's health. 

then opinion matter, quite frankly, meaningless. dont know even discussing this. 

On subject health: people smoke, stop (if want improve health odds living longer, less adverse health events.

People drink bottle liquor stop, within context improving health

people eat cake 3 times day stop, concerned health.

You say ""person X"" without thinking less Y. Im 5'10 weigh 115 pounds, gain weight want within healthy weight range. to? course not. Doesnt change would within best interest so. many obese family members diabetes, made little dietary changes since diagnosed. dont think less them, think theyre wrong living want. dont care health it, doesnt mean rest world doesnt right call spade spade.

&amp;#x200B;

""Access affordable, nutritious food""

bananas $1 bushel 6. Doritos $4 bag. Eating healthy expensive, idea spend ton money eat garbage day classic deflection people dont want admit fault overweight\*\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

\*- yes people legitimate health issues control, lead weight issues. majority obesity product laziness ignorance, unwilling adjust lifestyle. would take away exact opposite conclusion.

A smaller fraction vaccinated attendees got sick unvaccinated, like ~1-2% people got sick all, really good considering nature event. surprising coworkers refusing vaccine like brain dead morons. actually think virus purposely made released could make vaccines make money vaccines. Stupid fucks. unvaccinated scared needles would rather live fear. We're yet. State pretty high vaccination rate seen hospitalizations triple past 3 weeks. Deaths remain low, that's like 4 week lagging indicator(2 weeks positive test death average, plus 2 weeks death certificate make way system). I'm expecting deaths remain lowish elderly 80% vaccinated, vaccination puts risk death awful 40 year old vaccinated. pushback comes, though, people seeing realistic strategy improve things going forward we've used biggest best ultimately weapon vaccination. max vaccination still spreading, slow stop it. flatten curve, aside vaccination see weapon actually PREVENT infections happenings vs stretching longer period. Good point person replied gets it. neither, vaccines recognized approved fda yet. media outlets saying scheduled approval next month That’s exactly point making. sounds like hell. worked bedside years grateful don’t, grateful read elsewhere research says probably evade neutralizing antibodies. means catch immune system can’t fight all. Vaccines won’t work lambda evade immune system.

Source? You’re making bold claim without providing evidence. better Johnson Johnson vaccines work Yeah, really adds onto suckiness also legally blind years 9 eye surgeries save vision. last surgery 2 weeks lockdowns, never got enjoy that. 

PLUS side gig sensory science consultant, speciality aromas, sense smell affected way I’m fucked. suggestion: turn away refused get vaccinated. greatly reduce load hospitals staff, allow provide service everyone else currently made wait.

This would let anti-vaxer problem solve itself. US huge place go one number, plus states operate differently.

If look individual states like Alabama Tennessee we're sitting 34% full vaccination. Glad decided get vaccinated  know course don't. Hopefully change someone's mind going though. head lice Covid. Ok. look forward it. didnt realize halfway drive J&amp;J much weaker compared two offered, time getting appointment 2 shot vaccine harder now, J&amp;Js walk-ins. Since went family members, went ahead got shot figured better nothing, wish waited extra week two get stronger dosage.

I work retail store hardly anything protect employees, also happen live small town seems mostly masks vaccines, kinda nerve wracking hear fast delta variant hitting community. parents feeling sending children school teacher unvaccinated? Six hours indoors unvaccinated adult makes nervous. school also requiring cloth masks.  ""Less likely"" coud 0.01%, 0.1%, 1% etc give value sources misread article. 59% serious disease. 59% symptoms. Huge difference. Lol like segment called “tell Tim” local fox station Dallas. It’s phone hotline people call say whatever. amazes messages people leave news stations. Feel sorry poor people go those. alone. I'm pretty sure every single one us point dozen anti-vaxxers know would fall similar category. listen doctors plague, probably going think obese. Damn goalposts wheels.

Even accepted argument, (covid long term effects heart, lungs, brain), kids definition live families. Besides fact parents want kid catch plague hurt, parents ALSO WANT DIE. Nevermind multi generational household group living situation. 

While chances kid keeling low, like parents unreasonable protecting child themselves/their family. Don’t we? thought 125,000 breakthrough cases. states didn’t report One question - got second dose vaccine - reaction like? Health Insurance companies stop covering unvaccinated persons take obvious easily avoidable risks absolutely attempt mitigation. abundance sadness came reading comment sign 100% right. clinging hope stupid people cant use big words correctly sentence. surprised vaccinated fee ($50) unvaccinated fee ($50) fly them. isn’t irresponsible, flat evil.

And need begin framing anti-vaxxers that: evil. Pure, stupid, evil. 

I’m done civil towards them. need take action. Now. children, we’re supposed protect. lol true actually, think way. guess people like place food chain ;) ICUs try maintain 40% vacancy rates handle surges, adjust personnel adequate time care existing patients. Within numbers, percentage ICU dedicated COVID-19 cases matters greatly level additional attention protection staff increases dramatically typical patient case.  


As general rule, want less 10% total ICU dedicated COVID patients. get 20%, unit considered ""extremely stressed"". get 50% unit assigned COVID patients, entire hospital danger collapse, supplies facilities part equation. Exhausting highly trained attentive staff onsite much higher concern right now.  


While current hospitalizations numbers yet, surge infections per 100K concerning generally considered predictive indicator planning capacity staffing - staff robots, vividly recall previous surges, dealing far younger healthier patients showing units. military assistance (similar happens natural disasters)? could imagine insignificant detail getting blown proportions. Yeah, careful wish for. Religiously affiliated hospitals might treat folks equally kind pick choose attitude accepted. think that's [*fully* right? first post thread percentage population least one dose, statistics I've citing response also first dose numbers.

(and US still [60.8% adults fully still pretty far behind UK's mark there) decided refused free vaccination global fucking pandemic asked offered counseling PTSD, depression, etc. employer result pandemic said no. Really sad. EU can't access site. wish twins best speedy recovery.

But thumbnail, think definitely say obesity's contribution COVID complications needs seriously addressed. makes sense young people dying COVID easily avoided weight.  require students still request exemption many states. said students still participate like vaccinated kids. comparing infection rates vaccinated unvaccinated people, unvaccinated rate infection 4 times higher. comparing RATES, raw numbers, (num. infected / num vaccinated time infection) vs (num infected / num unvaccinated time infection) worrying bit have. Sure teens spread covid teens generally much lower risk hospitlisation adults. fact still many adults unvaccinated worries me. Cases probably similar states think we're gonna see huge difference hospitlisation numbers states super low vaccination rates states highest vaccination rates. thought expanding trials? sites Ca expanded Another superspreader event, like last year. ride motorcycles stupid large gathering right now. Yeh I’ll likely one sooner later mom won’t let get vaccinated wish could, it’s feasible moment us. Same. Even comment saying online interaction person upvoted absurd. School starts one week... bet we'll virtual soon after... \*sigh\* take seriously send hope prayers.

Now, actually something it? Doubtful.

Could stopped Delta wave? Yes, probably still minimize within month getting everyone get vaccine get vaccine, happen. hope study completed quickly children 12 vaccinated, done kids (who wants vaccination) vaccinated, think country fully opened masks done (unless want to) point, unvaccinated HOPE enough vaccinated people protect ""herd"" immunity. One thing wish done lot pandemic get everyone lot smarter masks, make priority getting high performance masks everyone population. 

In US, really got wrong foot, first CDC advice people wear masks, wear N95 masks, conflating every kind mask every kind mask treating same. also understandable N95 mask shortage, jumped right away solved now.

Wearing disposable surgical mask old t-shirt around lower face wearing well-fitting N95 type mask. good fraction population even know talking say this. serious vaccine hesitancy issues they’ll masking long time. 

I’m pro-mask though, especially indoors. makes sense me. I’m well aware Jacobson v. Massachusetts. case whether vaccine mandate could enforced, I’d surprised Supreme Court would willing extend ruling’s scope beyond specific use. Especially given current makeup. Gov DeathSentence trying sabotage public schools Florida even divert taxpayer funds private schools. Florida rapidly entering ""failed state"" territory, previous memes Florida notwithstanding. if

lol fun. Population wise, Canada better comparison states provinces states. Canadian provinces higher vaccination US states lower population even Wyoming. mean Yukon population 35k. Same. swear 95% pilots super conservative.

Then again, I, got jabbed. Still surprising. lack oxygen, lack case reporting well. DeSantis following Modi playbook covering ears pretending nothing's happening. Oh, cram *all* children back schools, maskless, nothing go wrong! Good. did. here’s thing, hardly kids wear masks, changing classrooms classes. math one class, reading another, ect. I’d like imagine cleaned classrooms, somehow I’m doubtful. CNN: Rehires guy jacks zoom video
Call.

Also CNN: Chris Cuomo covers sexual predator brother acts like publicity agent. 

ALSO ALSO CNN: You’re fired despicable unvaccinated human being!!! normalize failing students learning biology I'm sorry same. Yes, joke. :) obviously BAD, I'm sure getting ""damn good"" numbers mRNA vaccines dramatically outperforming it.

Also, note Covid infections unvaccinated people mild, too. saying huge percentage breakthrough J&amp;J infections mild really *that* impressive. really think antivaxxers politicians Florida, Mississippi, Alabama Arkansas would behaved differently CDC hadn’t issued guidance? went Florida panhandle vacation March (kept enjoyed uncrowded outdoors) nobody wearing mask indoors, maybe 5%. Everything wide open. states done restrictions vaccine rollout infancy, CDC responsible that. problem. ICU beds full (93% reporting time), someone non-COVID needs it, bed, or, importantly, staff handle car wreck, violence anything else needs acute care. nurse friends quit precisely this. Dealing unruly patients part job, many unhinged, anti-vaxxers showing greater proportion before, becomes overwhelming - live heavily vaccinated area world.

I even imagine would like rural south.  State wide 47% fully vaccinated. holy fuck... swear living nightmare never end already two anxiety flare ups within week.. guess like anxiety hot summer much congrations florida! mean. Lol yea. True. man crap could get turned think everyone would much better place. shocked Bolieve it!  Well sure great schools across country reopening coming month! /s Yeah, miss wear DeSantis's EO amended allow schools mandate masks?

I guess I'm behind Florida's rules regarding mask mandates since article seems imply schools mandate masks. Local enforcement like pointless given freedom movement Americans enjoy across state lines. Heck state tried block people crossing border entirely Cuomo threatened sue us (because many NYers vacation homes want fleeing making situation worse). ultimately State Police could stop tell people quarantine 2 weeks going stay state. many think actually followed that?

And state national law, perfectly legal that. could enforced national lockdown right President time political it. There's nothing Constitution prohibits SCOTUS ruled within executive power take actions national crisis like that.

See Jacobson v. Mass. particular case deals vaccines, implication far John Marshall Harlan delivered decision 7–2 majority Massachusetts law violate Fourteenth Amendment.

Now, people travel anywhere world 24 hours, virus spread globally two three months, saw early 2020, recently Delta variant. I'm thinking going change equation lot ways. Obviously everybody get vaccinated, J&amp;J vastly better nothing.

That's nothing point, effectiveness J&amp;J practice seems like might lot lower phase 3 trial, really good compared mRNA vaccines. shocked number reliable. think it’s undercount least order magnitude. Well know long haul debilitating cognitive issues, that. assumed Covid boosters would needed big deal. get flu shot every year still occasionally get diagnosed flu. respiratory issues flu make sick I've never hospitalized. I'm ready get flu shots Covid shots year need be, better safe. unfortunate part, probably mutate point vaccines work shut world again. kid could happen conspiracy theorists. Nope. thinks protecting kids Covid made vulnerable RSV. It’s month’s pet theory. Pretty good rate educated you’d get even people crying “Censorship!” like Facebook branch government. It’s easy judge people allowing kids become obese many people likely people would call CPS saw children walking park playing park unattended, riding bike playing outside yard without supervision, etc.

Childhood obesity going improve stop vilifying parents allowing children active outdoors without perfect supervision. people know may CPS called allowing kids play outdoors, obvious choice simply kids sit inside day playing video games “supervised,” name safety.

On related note, would supportive Med1care everyone received sort basic gym membership. It’s easy judge people money world home gym expensive gym membership, land take care (yardwork good exercise) low middle class poor don’t money buy gym memberships home gym equipment, property even basic yardwork, least without landlord’s permission (which probably won’t get it’s liability issue).

I don’t think people seem realize hard low income people get proper exercise. “Just go walks” right? Well likely live neighborhoods become massive heat islands summer poor neighborhoods less likely trees. also likely live dangerous neighborhoods, would risking life and/or property “take walk.” 

I’m pretty solidly middle class live older neighborhood definitely suburban bordering rural area, simply aren’t sidewalks, are, last one street end again. It’s straight dangerous walk places around here. I’d walk half road mile hilly road blind spots get street sidewalk. imagine situation isn’t common, that’s least personally don’t go walks. This.

Remember goal vaccines let immune system learn recognize target virus looks like get practice training it.

There's decent summary wikipedia at: addition mRNA (Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech) inactivated virus types (CoronaVac, CoviVac, Covaxin), we've got adenovirus vector vaccines (AstraZeneca, Janssen/J&amp;J, Sputnik V, Convidencia) subunit vaccines (Novavax, EpiVacCorona, Sanofi/GSK). article notes types vaccines currently going clinical trials.

The adenovirus vector vaccines what's known viral vector vaccine. ""Vector"" context means ""delivery method"". take sort virus harmless humans fill little bits RNA instructions build parts virus want protect from. (Keep mind viruses world harmful humans!) Similar mRNA vaccines, causes body make bunch copies one target virus' proteins. couple vaccines Ebola type.

For subunit vaccines, manufacturer makes zillion copies one protein (or small set proteins) virus lab injects bunch proteins directly you. vaccine Hepatitis B type. There's difference asking questions hiring process asking US (depending question). Yeah...with ""free will"" clause religion.

I've like - right cancer diagnosis fight boss believe it, deadlines meet want see proof lying. triggers disgust reaction nurses even remotely ""they knew signed for"", please check humanity. someone reacts *any way* something needs fixed **NOW** - really, months ago - know say that's considered polite commentary.

That people deal appalling. friend nursing talked like death march runs year ""but Christmas family"", get December turns several notches.

I completely grok quitting spot. demographic associated Sturgis. say basically polar opposite demographic. Density *probably* contributing factor area experiencing surge explain last 18 months, Romania harder hit (per capita cases deaths). density important, we'd expect Israel worse overall places like NYC, London, Tokyo decimated non-stop. Couldve handled better sure cases skyrocketing everywhere US. East coast, West coast, everywhere getting hit hard. taking bet Yeah probably should. 



Get vaccinated. Pfizer Moderna vaccines amazing, even Delta, Delta variant highly infectious much serious variants. Wear proper mask crowded areas around anyone unvaccinated showing symptoms. think sick, get tested quarantine negative. isn’t Russia bro… normal school year people demanding? feel like US basically made EMTs/Medics medical field equivalent unpaid shitty internship. pay relative training cost jobs absolutely bs. Everyone know EMT certificate using get experience going nursing PT program. mean know kids young said (but also people 2 kids close age need outside socialization much child would need)

i agree everything open people congregating last months like isolated entire time covid. 

there's also difference 2 families meeting children socialize (all parents/guardians vaccinated) vs schools remaining open

kids socialize without going school crowded places Seems like major issue study it’s based self reported data people wo *suspected* long Covid. medical diagnosis required. Doesn’t even seem like controlled people positive test result. sell always been, ""When 70% people state get vaccinated, begin return normal"" can't keep touting individual importance vaccinations get upset people treat like group effort. No..., standard procedure double blame illegal aliens Nancy Pelosi. sure want give health insurance companies power determine ""deserves"" coverage? power before, remember phrase ""pre existing conditions""? Yeah shitty. 

What happens health insurance companies stop covering people get STDs? feel easily avoidable risk? people injured activities like mountain biking rock climbing? decides risk worthy one isn't? enforce effectively, worthless Yeah, people masking pretty consistently liberal city they're not. can't darn thing Florida chose live years ago felt somewhat functional lot places, we'd kept mandates place people would mostly followed them. drag.

Yes. nurse check chart make sure food asking approved diet. Almost die suffer. they'll another surge, that's works Jesus. That's definition bad news.  mean, already nix 30% number anti-vax.

We're 70% adults least 1 shot we'll probably north 75% pretty soon things ramping up. medical reason, ""stupid"" apply? already know lot people going quote amendments things properly understand, maybe even conspiracies, going blanket term ""stupid?""

I like less say need GOOD reason vaccinated fired. see lot new job openings future. Yes, that's correct. Make deal them: 2 people previously unvaccinated get vaccinated staff behalf, admit you. Otherwise, pound sand. breakthrough cases get much publicity, opposite doesn’t, here’s personal anecdote:

I around person didn’t know unvaccinated last weekend. even drink (bad decision, know) talked face face hours. 

This person tested positive Sunday. 

I (fully vaccinated since may) took COVID test today (no symptoms, safe) tested negative.

None vaccinated people tested positive either. 

I know breakthrough infections happen, I’m yet hear one outside Reddit. idea freedom... suppose level DeSantis admit might wrong this?  Again, lockdown scale you’re talking likely outside scope ruling Jacobson v Massachusetts. Yes, places limits personal liberty, also places limits police power. entire decision quite nuanced. Though it’s good take copy/paste straight Wikipedia try prove point. mention massive impact large percentages population die. people think they're affected things? get it. Theyve put hospitals diverting patients Mobile, live. think pediatric hospital beds remaining Online band isn’t fun.  think people realize amazing considering even designed delta mind. state beginning boosters drug store got booster (multiple high risk factors) said advised give third dose brand got first two. Two dose excellent protection need check doctor/pharmacist boosters becoming available least places.

Edit: Also good news pharmacy packed people wanting shots including people getting caught boosters. that's amazing progress! state that? mean say South rise again?  Context like crucial hate it’s getting left articles, it’s bad enough headlines sensationalized generate clicks.

I can’t count many people I’ve explain vaccine works test positive vaccine doesn’t mean carry spread like unvaccinated person does. Children 12 remains demographic can’t get vaxed. makes sense cases would shift age group Awesome  known interaction confirmed, non-serious RSV infection future susceptibility severe Covid kids 2? Would child 2 recovered RSV more, less, difference risk bad case covid? I'm implying difference. thought seen something cross immunity viruses remember ones age group studied. Successfully implemented successful  Nah would get wants protect humans animals Lol don’t kind money makes seem like plateau? likely. Thank goodness, wouldn’t want governor actual governing. /s That's concerned. next state everything pretty normal far night life, etc. Sure seeing increase cases scary headline ""NOT SEEN SINCE **ENTER DATE**"" people forget period time still ton restrictions masking requirements. knew cases going climb everything opened up. Probably cute nurse wants flirt Combination possibility Long COVID social/mental implications ""failing"" kind like evacuation orders: ""please evacuate -- expect us save later"" go toddlers MRI cancer. men waiting room mask nose - one punching holes mask. Like hello kid broken arm others cancer wear freaking mask you’re children’s hospital. 1 year, kid still inadequate immune system. riskier example 2 year old. Best ask pediatrician, that's generally say.

I 3 year old, plan send Pre-K yet. people might think I'm overreacting, doubt would it, want get health complications later.

Also kids doctors know typically fully masked also going school/kindergarten.  I'm sorry yours. lost mom 1990, thing worse losing husband comfort me. 

My husband also vent (he post-op complications successful bifemoral aortic bypass), still consider one luckier ones: gave CPR try get back (NOT faint heart - BRUTAL), able memorial 200 attendees, able get support lockdown hit. covid widows get either options.  gives conspiratorial crazies additional ammo. 10% kids requiring hospitalization like 100 times data I’ve seen anywhere else. Would love see actual numbers back statement. Maybe it’s fact hospital system going automatically see worst cases would skew higher. high level numbers shown 1 1,000 kids Covid need hospitalization. 10% way way way seen anywhere. That’s even see adults. based scientific evidence. Masking (including universal masking schools), physical distancing, testing, contact tracing, quarantining vaccinating **help**.

One ways messaging around covid went astray allowed become distracted question ""do masks **work**?"". problem word ""work"" subject binary thinking. Something works work; think work terms degrees. 

Help much stronger word. much easier think help terms degrees. masks work? Irrelevant. help. help, it? low risk reinfection becomes small risk vaccination. I'll take it. Ironically they're getting taste medicine refusing medicine. Better without, doubt mind. due circumstances got wanted faster protection opposed waiting month 2nd injection. 


I would totally get booster made available J&amp;J recipients. also, one doesn’t make special sub circle jerk. full people relishing fact people agree them, right side history, blame everything ""unvaccinated choice"" people blame everything dying. see disgusting enjoyment right tragic event. Ok know feels, yet willing go BACK lifestyle protect people get vaccine conspiracy theories? totally understand wanting protect can't get vaccine medical issues/being &lt;12, best thing everyone else get vaccine.

Why punishing enabling anti-vaxxers?? everyone eligible gets vaccine, nightmare over. hurting anyone taking precautions, hurting getting vaccinated.

And judge want lol literally care less. makes 100x special learn together.

The Internet made possible.

Sean Carrol's intro calculus possibly accessible come across: many full free Calc courses online, here's decent one: want great instruction bunch advanced subjects, trongly recommend channel. treasure. point tech, chumps people special needs paying expensive buildings high-paid administrators. sister's kid running 103 fever. didnt tested . I've spoken lot widows due profession. prevailing theme seems always hurts, comes waves. beginning, waves overtake constantly. Later on, come in, surf them. Maybe take little, come air. notice feel top.   People cough, natural. mean they're sick. say almost 0 proves you’re fucking moron, good luck   Schools contract trace. also notify parents child exposed covid. still notify parents kid class lice, though. getting tested? People mild cases I’d imagine it’s likely happened them. working ""94/4/2"" Covid.

Those numbers severity somebody breakthrough infection. they're actually different numbers somebody unvaccinated gets infected. they're really helpful all.

What's missing many people suffering breakthrough infections, something can't find reported anywhere.

But point, got J&amp;J vaccine thought, hey, okay, great, get Covid, least need go hospital... well, think again. 71% lot different 100%. actually seen results published. looked found them. saw [this CDC reported 6,587 Covid-19 breakthrough cases July 26, including 6,239 hospitalizations 1,263 deaths. time, 163 million people United States fully vaccinated Covid-19. 
Divide severe breakthrough cases total fully vaccinated population result: less 0.004% fully vaccinated people breakthrough case led hospitalization less 0.001% fully vaccinated people died breakthrough Covid-19 case.

This quoted constantly. determine number vaccinated infected, hospitalized, dead. CDC actually publish data relating vaccinations directly infections, hospitalizations, deaths. reason unknown me, plausible ones (that dispute merits).

I say calling large population people vaccines ""idiots"" quite impossible us reach amount vaccinated would remove danger unvaccinated (for legitimate reasons). “Breakthrough cases occur, very, rare,"" said Dr. Bukhosi Dube, senior health advisor Oregon Health Authority. ""What know current surge fueled primarily people vaccinated."" dont make, undo policy. governors hospitals overrun, turning people away, allowing virus spread children, block mask social distancing mandates especially schools ones hold responsibility.

Welcome real world. It’s darned do, darned don’t situation. would large percentage population angry matter done.

Again, agree shut everything couple months sent weekly payments everyone order sustain extended shutdown, never going happen. Antivaxxers 22%, according one poll, quite bad that. surprising. country (Australia) kinda similar. Except weeks ago government actively telling 40s get vaccinated current supplies, lol.  I’m assuming not. like teachers. exciting school year. 96% breakthrough cases study ""mild"" &lt;0.05% hospitalization death. I'm fine odds myself. exact reason. numbers university system showed 2020 slight dip enrollment, complete loss revenue students things like housing food. realize pandemic, cafeterias dorm rooms huge money-makers universities.

Going virtual would doubly catastrophic: said, time would considerable dip enrollment addition ongoing loss revenue on-campus sources. they'd still actual infrastructure (i.e. buildings) maintain. CDC revert guidance 5 days Florida school starts Aug 10th, I'd hold hopeful. Boosters now. probably logistically feasible transfer specific doses another country, could found people within state willing take them. makes scary Govenor Abbott TEA throwing elementary students teachers SUPER SPREADER EVENT five days week. could probably hold rapid test hours go traveling dont get results Opinions like assholes, everyone's got one wanna see  Killing impunity.  Thank you. I'm okay. I'm pretty sure that's gonna be. sequence it, I'm sure ever notify people whose tests sequenced.

You make fairly accurate guess based local prevalence variants though. instance, around 90% cases sequenced Oregon Washington delta. Additionally, vaccinated get it, pretty good guess caught delta even without fancy sciencing tools.  Lol. Biden literally can't lockdown country. He's king. ""few hundred"" cases superspreader event. Unfortuante, wave fault unvaccinated. punish them, instead us. Force take vaccine, wear masks, lockdown. let vaccinated please. Covid restrictions massive psychological toll, please please let us vaccine. R0 among fully vaccinated community 0.

Side note: really hate virtue signalling going days; tons people know bring protecting kids/grandma excuse push agenda (permanent WFH, in-person events since they're introverts, parties since never get invited, etc)  conventional vaccines available North America made India &amp; China

I heard speculation least part due manufacturing safety concerns. virus-growing part BSL 3 conditions, might make lower production capacity since lot facilities available. there's fear inactivation step goes wrong, get repeat Cutter Incident. could reasons well. Right, tiny rural communities everyone's living generations, suddenly towns getting rocked virus first time district Texas contact tracing requiring student stay home covid. 
Everything else…vax masks optional. Everyone wears masks “supported”. 
I give 2 weeks school starts hit fan. soon feel safe kid socialize, so.

You actually need $15 million building staffs teachers administrators making 6 figures organize play dates. Brazil trying Coronavac Hospitals filling unvaccinated people, vaccinated breakthrough cases. sure point is. Right back school. Funny happens... Yes. 

The fact CDC thought telling people wear masks protect others would fly 30-40% population hilarious.


Then really thought unvaccinated people would keep wearing masks telling vaccinated people take - based ""honor system""  Also, variant kills quickly die find new hosts. Unfortunately, lot hosts don’t seem care. Good question. would think would prevention mechanisms one dealing COVID-19 (whatever variant), respiratory. way many people coughing airport good army enemy could cough win war. blame them. That's happens treat people trying save lives like absolute dirt. got vaccine. find annoying may catch illness people afraid vaccine. think mean it’s ironic they’re “blue lives matters” don’t tread supporters “blue lives” treading fellow Americans, video even 

It’s also hypocritical don’t tread essentially means leave alone I’m causing others harm. They’re causing others harm denying COVID, refusing vaccine *and* masks

I could totally base that’s see anyways thread, great majority test positive, seemed cold going around. That's encouraging 1/5,000 low understanding side effects. skeptical CDC confidently saying there's likely link two months admitting Israel France said April. Countries stopped giving AZ altogether far rarer effects (clotting).

What correct ""short"" myocarditis indeed temporary mild. However, myocarditis studies COVID suggested increases risk heart attack road. joke either. Throw trash belong ""Fully vaccinated people *who get Covid-19 breakthrough infection* transmit virus, US Centers Disease Control Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Thursday.""

It's first paragraph link. can't transmit infected. Vaccination lowers risk infection. Vaccinated people less likely get infected therefore less likely transit virus. None happening vaccinated people got breakthrough infections cruise ship, happening masses unvaccinated people getting ill.

The solution always getting people fully vaccinated healthcare remain stable chances breakthrough cases miniscule. Good - y'all going catch flak it, there's way it. variants serious business many Americans completely oblivious again. [Let's use best case scenario half kids get covid ar asymptomatic. _still_ means 1 40 chance child developing long covid. That's badly funded school's classroom. taking precautions witu covid, 100% fair say every child catch end school year. typical 20 person classroom, we're talking 10 kids symptoms sort week two 50/50 gamble one lingering effects knock school month, whole term maybe whole year. actually enough data know.

This breakdown means literally every parent know kid bad run covid even considering macro analysis. Yes. something worry about. Many us face trying draining times work, difference walk away today I'm also battling guilt death. difference HUGE. heart goes health care workers idea them. It’s game play, see things get better, don’t they’ll push back another month. 

A lot companies entire pandemic, even worst they’d like “let’s plan three months we’ll readjust needed” year half later get you, get angry too, think people know aren’t vaccinated, come poor backgrounds almost none college education.

The unvaccinated tend people already sort slipped cracks system. disproportionately people color people low socioeconomic status.

I’m saying it’s fault, see victims larger issues right. lot hospitals are, least Michigan. opinions. they’re valid. 

It's opinion, However, CDC suggested unvaccinated children avoid flying. delta wrecking little ones now. 

It's not. confusing infections CFR. There's children infected hospitals, cuz there's people infected hospitals, two reasons, Delta really infectious, two, elderly vaccinated, mostly left younger groups. terms bad is, there's data worse children previous strains. So, far parent goes, little girls everything. I’m take unnecessary risks go day/night/weekend fun. kids young don’t even know care.

I'm talking schools, behavior vaccinated. 

Children go school, wanna mask them, go ahead (it shit), vaccinated people need get lives. 



This virus going endemic, stay, EVERYONE gonna get it. Near useless? heard anything stating that, admit lived relative blissful ignorance assumption stayed masked away people, would mostly fine. 

Is study outlining specifically? 3rd child death less two weeks Delta.  went 18 months reports child death even child ventilator. 

Delta like last year. Delta dangerous children everyone else. Don’t spread misinformation here. overreaction. pretend care.  ones keeping covid/vaccine news. covid, knew vaccines protect 100% reduce severity symptoms. never gave thought transmission asymptomatic mildly symptomatic carrier.

That said, parents due diligence learn stuff global pandemic. “We value making bullshit arguments suit needs client.”

In fact, exact title latest entry Bob Loblaw Law Blog.  decided keep another semester reason. Alabama. Yes u can. Source: vaccinated parent spread  heard English tunnel right? students gonna lose. 7th circuit appeals court already [ruled students Indiana really hope public schools state colleges defy asinine 'ban vaccine passport' laws respective states.   Texas, danger girl. hope realize COVID us end time. Newer cases always happen. agree sense, COVID never end.

However, ever get point COVID's severity like flu seasonal diseases, virus longer novel, stop factoring everywhere. CEOs still get seven-figure bonuses.  Sounds like great plan Even worse require tshirts fridays events. flat refuse wear all. Yep. Would new variant also contagious Delta variant even out-compete take over? wondered long time heard variants logical answer far Delta variant constantly outperforms mutations due high contagiousness. 

Does mean we're 'lucky' first version vaccines still effective Delta still muchother potential mutations Delta variant could get would make worse? Let here. serious. That's quite accurate. vaccinated people **who get infected** indeed transmit virus, fact remains vaccinated people **far less likely** *get* infected. patently false say vaccines nothing prevent transmission. Yes aware first release data appears transmitting. Thus wearing masks.

But note vaccines still **prevent getting infected get infected cannot transmit disease.**

Get vaccinated. Sounds like refused treatment. drugs fired. someone forced school get vaccinated I'm people tell put body think free put want body

Yeah. Entertainment. probably important war information lifetimes - can’t let bots ignorance win. Everyone comment support vaccination combat this. means hundred comments trying reason someone it. convince 1 person making difference. 

Remember dead 20th century wars US - war can’t let ignorance win. FDA granted EUA based clinical data. myocarditis link showed millions/billions vaccinated, since incidence low. exactly approval based on. rare benefits largely outweigh risk, age groups. take away EUA changed. health experts STILL recommend age groups get vaccinated. changed. logical sensible option, stupid think otherwise. 

essentially give flu? talking about? furthermore, myocarditis permanent, unlike many effects covid itself. would surprised FDA give full approval teens. know much less think do.  Healthcare collapsing due people unvaccinated? Huh, wonder solution mandating vaccines? Nah, be. Guess we'll let willfully unvaccinated determine live lives on. /s Came say add, Israel, they're actually already giving boosters (non-tailored) elderly people. Delta absolutely nasty.

In turn irony, asking countries [not give since developing countries enough vaccines. Right. Though never claimed it’s ideal  Florida would make 27/hr normal staff nurse. pandemic would receive offers 100/hr areas. Daily.

For now, it’s another month need wait see bad delta wave gunna get. 

One day kids might understand.  According CDC director vaccines nothing preventing recently told Stephen Nolan programme BBC Radio 5 Live although feels ‘foolish’ now, believed partner ‘highly said told her: ‘It’s gene thing, experimental thing. You’re putting something body hasn’t thoroughly tested.’ 

Why would lawyer know anything viruses vaccinations??  

It's Dunning Kruger effect action, yet again... 🤦‍♂️ media take misinformation. Facebook, YouTube, etc actively knowingly contributing disseminating misinformation. Delta still stopped using lockdown strategy. Victoria done it. South Australia, Queensland Western Australia done it. 

The problem quarantine hotels keep producing leaks. They've another Queensland. NSW keeps spitting embers closest states. 

If fix quarantine hotels firm state borders still limit spread NSW. NZ, Tasmania Western Australia still going strong elimination strategies, impossible.  I’m definitely vaccinated. I’m waiting patiently vaccine become available kids. adults immediate family vaccinated, continue wear masks about, regardless whatever mandate is/isn’t place least children get vaccine. wish could local hospital/medical staff deal stress/anxiety, don’t know what. Maybe makes sense Vax 9 up… good parents. this'll affect ones care kids. emotionally neglected children relatively safe. Nurses, please take money. 

We fully support decision capitalise people. merely reaping sowed point. That's fair guess. personally affected unfortunately. Oh keep seeing comments like outside thread:

""Masks always going needed! Vaccines stop getting sick! keep hospital it!""

This blatant lie. CDC still cites 75-85 percent effectiveness Johnson Johnson even shows 71 percent effectiveness delta infection 92-96 percent effectiveness death kidding, I'm worried flight attendants, I'm worried ending one flights someone thirty minute standoff pilot miss connection. guess incentive dying Covid enough people. Data early delta vaccines still provide protection getting infected exposed; appears get infected change transmit virus clear level lowered rate vs unvaccinated. Early reports said low transmission level transmission we'll need wait bit more.

We easiest solution gigantic global problem yet getting people get couple shots bridge far.

Definitely worth suffocating slowly support youtube research listening combined medical knowledge developed countries.

Dude, they’re rich republicans, care good people suffering. sudden nurses went back ""essential workers"" ""heroes.""

Yeah, I’m confused. reasonable places boosters, director CDC said vaccines longer stop transmission. Huh? can’t black white else virus would even widespread America already is.

The majority people dying obese old. One preventable. I'm sick hearing need wear mask protect fat diabetic whiner. that's me, let anyone else bully feeling safe.  Glad hear got case. Hope taste comes back quickly, things read seem indicate long term taste loss low percentage result encouraging. Vaccinated people probably spread it, much unvaccinated people. helps slow spread lot.

That's entirely true delta variant. depends exactly mean. 

Initial research shows breakthrough cases (where vaccinated patient gets COVID shows symptoms), contagious non-vaccinated cases. true context vaccinated person reduce spread slow break throughcase. primary reason CDC changed mask guidance vaccinated people.

In contrast first point, vaccinated person less likely get delta variant COVID, test positive demonstrate symptoms someone vaccine. regard, vaccination slow spread since vaccinated people less likely spread COVID less likely get spread it.

I know two odds certainly bit pedantic. But, thought might useful others reading comment understand nuances situation.

I'm talking specifically delta variant represents greater 80% cases US right now.

Primarily, vaccine's benefits center around area:

1. Makes less likely get COVID turns make less likely spread people

2. Makes less likely severe negative outcomes (e.g. hospitalization death)

The short version, get vaccinated. does, measurable degree, protect getting COVID helps reduce likelihood hospitalization death. Overall, help reduce spread population.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oddly, folk claim want uphold ""sanctity life"". They've forfeited credibility saying atrocious behavior pandemic. People get vaccine. get, say, muscle cramps. report VAERS vaccine effect.

But often muscle cramps caused vaccine, happen routinely caused dozen things trigger them.

It’s useful 500 people report getting muscle cramps two million people get vaccinated - researchers note trend take closer look study see vaccine causing muscle cramps. believe get shingles vax last year ended Covid. She’s sick since then… might need get every six months awhile. Especially since large population refuse vaccinated. They'll variant factories. hope variants emerge less contagious less deadly happened far. 

It's also possible we'll settle pattern vulnerable populations get every six months general population gets yearly. personally would happily vaccinate every six months keeps hospital keeps getting long Covid. It'll tough go deaths cases many deaths cases open up. Vaccines help reduce numbers significantly ultimately numbers much higher now. pandemic starting them. Improve working conditions. 

It’s triage sense “we three bandages eight patients need them, get rid sick ones treat three less sick ones” also “we’re nurses, prioritize patients likely saved turn away everyone else”.

Get rid rude patients. assault harass staff get discharged. Stop spending effort trying treat people society would better without. think anyone ever remembered OTs PTs before! I'm gonna guess OT 🤣  massive winter surge included 2021 stats, concluding anything Delta possible. Yeah exactly. consistently terrible messaging ? Anyway I’m making risk decisions masking required. certainly cave people guilting theatre purposes  way, good know US country education system failed give young people critical reasoning skills.

1) wrong, long painful recoveries.

2) infect people process may enjoy benefits ignorant youth.

And, so, children, that's vaccines. experts infectious disease, think things very, carefully, to. many folks going start 'Reeeeeeee'-ing airports then. Public freakout channels must pretty happy feel this! Watching brand new nurses receive $15k signing bonuses twenty nine years absolute dedication expertise ignored.

Better safe sorry. understand concern. parent wants something bad happen kid. almost certainly fine get covid. It’s great get go back school missing school far greater risk covid kids. saw study showed kids lost several months educational progress due covid far. can’t continue that. Logical headlines don’t generate clicks Nope. It’s triage. 

Also, message hospitals: insured patients likely vaccinated uninsured patients (based studies vaccines pre Covid). potentially legal way prioritize people actually give shit get paid so. Win win.

I’m MS saw report hospital assigning office staff bedside cafe. That's we're bitter hospital. We're like, us? fucking carried worst pandemic, where's bonus? 

There many nurses left soon. Older nurses like looking early retirement, younger ones looking careers altogether. they're leaving bedside areas. Management keeps making us less resources CEOs getting million dollar bonuses, patients getting demanding abusive. worth it. question around go, staying open guy posted experience back, wish I'd saved comment.

His parents got infected, mom got vaccinated (after recovery). tested antibodies. test gave concentrations antibodies, numbers exactly said, they're close enough get idea. test said protected greater 4 u/ml, dad 8 u/ml, mom 2,400 u/ml. (it may 1,600, get idea) 

So variant came along papers saying ""zeta exhibits 5.2 fold reduction antibody neutralization"" would reasonable assume dad would effectively &lt;2 u/ml, mom would effectively ~460 u/ml zeta variant. (there's zeta variant yet) I'm considering too. live zip code 37% fully vaccinated. husband picking groceries curbside ***AGAIN*** one wears masks. governor state pretty actively trying kill us all. Schools start next week mask mandates outlawed. Plus I'm required office 4 days week people take masks desks. Several school aged kids going person. Seriously thinking going getting booster happens. people get vaccinated want restrictions rather understanding biology.

Or, hear here, talking ass. clearly warning countries require vaccination prevent Brits entering, suggested UK prevent leaving. missing point. vaccine resistant variant may develop, randomly, mutations likely happen unvaccinated person given rate spread, viral load , length infection , number infections. claim vaccinated people getting infected likely lead vaccine resistant mutation 100% false. Let's go  one  time:

'Pretty well' mean never ever ever.

Got it? They'll probably stay open, they're treating covid patients. young people generally recover fine, serious symptoms might read overwhelmed hospitals can’t get staff even $25,000 bonuses, running oxygen patients held ambulances, ER ambulances.

I don’t give single fuck doctors think. get vaccinated listen science find different career doesn’t require working around high risk individuals.

Same goes nurses. don’t give fuck opinion. Many two year degree shitty college don’t expertise speak vaccines.

These people need get medical field something else.

I tired seeing nurses talking unmasking children giving single fuck pandemic. reply far could justify, scientifically least, would need pressure young, healthy adults taking vaccine.

The reading I've done long-COVID describes largely unknown anomaly, sources say could last months, years, forever. I've also heard vaccine reduce symptoms. scientific consensus (which may case data comes in), would realistically answer question, especially sort numbers claiming. I'll make sure check links reading.  I'd say yes also make sure there's 'facepalm' emoji embossed somewhere. would ask conducted study. way know vaccinated person got sick didnt need hospital would need hospital got sick weren't.

Anecdotally, I've traveling number different areas past two weeks, one saw relatively regular masking Cambridge, MA. even there, less 50% indoors (albeit, prior updated CDC guidance)  vaccines available back January. least 100% sure it’s Monica. Let bodies hit floor children needlessly dying many already.

 overkill, particularly given alternative socialization whatsoever, vaccines available yet, masking small kids problematic, put mildly.

That mean reality.

The vaccine absolutely critical step path towards collectively returning normal.

A lot sentiment come fully vaccinated people well. There's lot ""OK, hospitals full? I'm vaccinated."" Gotcha. Thanks elaborating. 🙌🏻🙌🏻 think hitting children harder infecting kids faster rate. plenty left, guaranteed source 5% long Covid? seen controlled studies ones seen found really doesn’t happen often all. Kid control group (seronegative covid) report lot symptoms rate kids Covid. Headaches, fatigue, etc apparently common amongst kids even without Covid. big one different loss smell.  So… Florida? Almost 60% people US least one dose, really bad 50% fully vaccinated. US 10% lower vaccination rates UK is. really thought late could called first dose. It’s vaccine. Crazy would turn away instead (mistakenly) telling thar start over. actually made two errors. He’s wrong, friends adults, nearing adulthood, small children hand DOOO need human interaction peers, need figure safely or, risk child’s mental health, need figure way balance out, kids vaccinated. said thing friend zero interest vaccine stopped talking lol  vaccinated friend gave 2 children. asymptomatic got tested vaccinated friend symptomatic tested positive). Kids negative test day positive days later. Sure Canada says thing require vaccine travelibg cases 3rd dose Children dying gun violence decades. motivation save children, pandemic either. I'm guessing reason they're loyal visas would deported lost job reason. Borders basically slave labor  ways?? saying variant handled current vaccines going continue infect kill people currently 4-6 weeks? stop fear mongering. Ashes, ashes

We fall down! refuse pay decent wages. Airlines notoriously low paid. 3 weeks pfizer 4 weeks moderna US. Though blame anyone wanting waiting longer since apparently effective. better approved Health Canada 3rd dose Severe illness, maybe, certainly thwart breakthrough infection me. I’m sure would advance vaccine schedule kids. anything data lack severity children shows studies slowed make sure risk worth reward. 

Your second point already done CDC. recommend person school masks social distancing. isn’t new. FDA would agency recommend this. Let's get kids old people Yes. think number breakthrough cases stratospheric ally higher saying.

If vaccinated dont test (and dont show breakthrough case) unless bad hospitalized.

But seeing people covid *than previous time pandemic*.

I'm fucking terrified. Fortunately live well educated purple blue area people generally good social distancing everyone went got vaccines.

But going people like wildfire. asymptomatic! group vaccinated people something, later one person loss taste smell, get tested, positive, people event tested - positive.

Look what's going positive covid19 subreddit well.

People vaccine acting like cannot catch virus. can. transmit virus. I've seem conflicting studies saying higher viral load unvaccinated saying lower.

The vaccine prevent dying covid. breakthrough cases know couple hospitalizations one single death (one good friends lost beloved father).

But preventing catching spreading others? seems like effectiveness 30% based see around me.

I'd happily rely actual data CDC instead except arent collecting data let alone publishing it.

Almost entire family vaccinated except young kids couple adults immune system issues allergies- one wife. I'm worried I've ever been. feel like sleepwalking towards massive calamity CDC still acting like catching transmitting covid unlikely vaxxed see nothing could truth. Oh man, bonkers. I'm essentially like office manager newsroom also see mail get sent people really rockers. like we're outlet frustrations we're reporting it, ""shoot messenger"" will. I'm also admin official fbook can't ever look comments.  claim article? I’ll try help.  many variables factors students ""worse"" make study completely subjective. bias wanting person education high academic elites schools morsel negative info DL would run it. many polls surveys saying black parents prefer kids remain DL return person school inequities school system.

I think identities based around certain value conflict science, whether anti-global warming belief medical community ""out get Trump"". true, phase 3 trial J&amp;J, two vaccinated people caught Covid weeks 2 4 hospitalized.

I found news article new study according small blurry graphs had, seems like maybe half dozen vaccinated people hospitalized.

I find source graph though. There's big web site study finding results eluded me.  number definitive stretch. paper linked order magnitude worse.

It's bizarre everything kids cavalier health new virus. think understand high 1% is. Stupid autocorrect. Gets time too. I'm going repeat third time now: mask mandates bars stay open compromise.  think large contingency people arguing 
 ZERO effect business, effect business  
is negligible compared business open--which  
alternative. business wants stay open  
long-term wants pandemic end soon possible,  
likely want things best public health.

I understand mask mandate better closure, would think reasonable person would agree. would hardly call compromise, guaranteed shutdown. one political capital another shutdown capacity restrictions country think even know this. vast majority county even mask mandate. get saying nothing forces politicians shut down. lot people saying things like ""they would shut down"" learned last year..the virus hold gun head anything. situations mask mandates measures necessary get wrong. saw last year seeing places necessary year well. seeing Mississippi example, total catastrophe hospital system. believe public health violating constitution anything, effective vaccines available think choice made lightly think large contingency people arguing ZERO effect business

Possibly real world like talking about? Oh yes is. Outside daily discussion thread anyway. whole point comments. claiming ""zero cost"". think mask mandates whole immoral violating rights anything crazy like wonder is? Like what's connection there? Like 
 remotely possible geographic locations  
aggressive implementing public health measures throughout  
pandemic would ones who...aggressively implement public health  
measures?

Yes..I disagree this. pointed places high vaccination rates implementing mask mandates highlight mess become. areas possibly reach 80 percent vaccinated ones implement mandates, irresponsible 38 percent vaccinated south concerts masks. one ""using mask mandates lightly"". 

If using avoid collapse healthcare system fully agree you. conspiracy theorist, believe used ""control"" anything like that. think places jump gun responding media pressure. think needs focus hospitalizations like UK did. area seeing huge increase cases seeing link cases hospitalizations broke? Yeah restrictions needed. Otherwise see get cyclical process lifting restrictions cases implementing go back up. I'm vaxxed, I'll friend. gotten booster J&amp;J well felt same! many ppl catching it?    Really can't believe thing media reports Tell Yankees Dang... hate autocorrect puts ""Authoritarian"" place ""ALL"" Seems like opting give obese children vaccine like wishing death upon them.. Ok whatever. current wave unvaccinated idiots think gives 5G. I’m helping people can’t help themselves. way many people understand many social media accounts bots foreign agents masquerading someone else.  employees working masks think cant breathe kids cant school would go to?  keep hearing news different places requiring vaccination keep thinking...why before. service industry serves lot people mass there’s something called development  fair. assume still at-home options available can't get test centre anyway. can't herd immunity without least 80% percent entire population vaccinated. true measles, mumps, rubella chickenpox. 

I think anyone would think 25,000 cases day measles healthcare success regardless politics. end particularly important since *children* vaccinated yet. hate others guts develop severe behavioral issues. seeing neighbors extremely strict isolation. 

We concerned long-term effects isolation especially small kids concerned potential long-term covid effects. 67% means 1 hospitalization vaccine arm 3 placebo arm, right? would first vaccinated hospitalization trial, absolutely look confidence/credible intervals here, point estimate.

Of course exact true 100%. based 1-20 hospitalizations placebo arm 0 hospitalization arm also essentially useless point estimates (but great PR releases).

J&amp;J primes absolutely get mRNA booster. think doubt that. talking without notes, said something extent ""If vaccinated someone vulnerable home, assume they're fully protected that's true more."" used words quote, without context get basically ""vaccines work preventing spread."" Yeah I'm sick alternate timeline too, want go back dimension came clearly it.   Hard disagree. staying home, masks, affect people ways might understand.

Well, husband four months died unexpectedly late February last year, went blissful newlywed total isolation 24/7 space three weeks. deal grief completely alone: hugs, going brunch friends distract myself, fighting urge kill every damn day. yeah: fucking understand. still say part protect other. know old lady front Publix vaccinated, know given unvaxxed person wilfully ignorant medically unable get vaccinated. 

My position absolutely everything power make sure I'm responsible family experience hell past 17 months. free feel otherwise, I'm free judge fuck it. donate them. literally together. global issue.

It's disappointing see people understand downvote me. certainly saying US need vaccination, necessary broaden focus. 

I understand frustration. well warranted. Sadly nothing done address root issue. vast misinformation machine allowed operate unchecked USA. risk like 2 kids, get vaccine Yeah, track macros seem to. works stick it. sugars, get bad phlegm. Phoebe seems like likely one anti-vax. 3 months ago governor going wait hit 70% lift restrictions.

Then didn't.

Then restrictions lifted, what, weekend 4th July!!??

A lot people waiting vaccines fully approved FDA. right wait. (Not personally supporter pursuing strategy time, support person's right idea head.)

So went back word lifted restrictions mask mandates made 70%, right before/during major holiday people gather, months vaccines fully approved (probably Sept hearing). Dumb, dumb, dumb.

OH, Summer! Olympic Track Trials! people came gathered world! Yay!

Not smart. smart all. 

We actually pretty good, Oregon!! Throughout whole 'rona craziness. pretty good compared states. really bad decisions made.

And well anymore. people confused heck, even belligerent stupidity. And, hey! School start. Wooo hooo! fall going sh\*t show super spreading. Ya'll ready!? 70% Adults one shot, coastal areas much higher. FL, Texas, Missouri Alabama WI suffer now. vaxx rates going natural immunity infections peak collapse fine. India could vaccinated population, chose prioritize manufacture vaccines foreign governments own. also charged money ($20 per shot) vaccines basically prevented poor acquiring one. poor people make $125 month. got Triple Delta +++. awesome. Right? thought article wasn’t bad people fearing could be… I'm lazy look likely still 25% adults gotten shot yet variety reasons ranging apathy full crazy loony antivax. True don’t think testing cites source transmission. Everything pretty buttoned me. leak people taking public transport place 

In case woke sore throat, work open plan office, worked home, walked test centre, got negative result 24 hr. 

The turnaround mailing would longer, expensive. 

I think it’s fine. Look way, kids seriously risk covid, children died hospitalized flu years ago covid entire pandemic, still pretending know long term effects covid? study children determined kids significant risk, low risk long covid, ones get long covid recovered 2 months, kids get covid somehow got long covid. first time heard vaccine associated myocarditis  Delta spreads local hospital fills, sent home die stroke.

Also, really know impact Delta kids, far, looks like way dangerous original strain.  That's double natural immunity, duh. ones wearing masks time better 1918 back making masks gauze. argument: highly educated certain political views anti Vax 

Meanwhile, liberals disproportionately likely educated educated individuals disproportionately pro vaccine. 

So yeah, think *is* scientist. law referring prevents nurses striking? One easily find evidence many nurses strikes. 100% certain parents obese well Morbidly obese accurate Yes Obv full herd immunity yet, also can't forget natural immunity, actually kinda sounded like might staff. ""Cut weekly routine"" Came make comment!  think people assume it’s inevitable kids eventually get since largely shown dangerous healthy kids make choice take risk. Yes small chance adverse outcome that’s true many things people kids. saw Fayette County ambulance southwest Austin yesterday. Afaik would normally going Houston county full first either way they're 70 miles away home best.

Shits good. Can't triple stamp double stamp!! Well I’ll make sure consult isn’t danger parents, grandparents, goddaughter future. Apparently you’re willing write health play devil’s advocate. going sound cold… that’s remotely fair comparison US UK. population 1.4 billion living tight quarters questionable sanitation healthcare. FDA approved vaccine history 300 million doses given full FDA approval. lucky see 300 thousand doses. faith vaccines, faith one. people cleared yet 12 that's even finished case studies age bracket. Every age bracket consider fully approved. school making masks optional. say want give parents choice. Complete failure understand masking helpful easily delta spreads. word yet even virtual option year families feel way risky. wish would least wait vaccines available ditch masks schools. ex husband Marine got plethora vaccines zero choice matter. mistrust , even debating it. seen any, given less 1 case myocarditis / million vaccines overall, would really hard find statistically significant difference there. specifically consider undemocratic?  Fuck around find ""Tell hillbilly, without telling hillbilly"" Im Florida visiting two clinics ask, seems one FL got J&amp;J allowed get Moderna Pfizer time, CDC governor gives clear, know anything Florida politicians, governor help all. think realistic zombies ones they're infected virus that's using human bodies host extent even taking motor control. there's nothing magical involved, bodies still rot, decompose, fall apart, etc. 

In stories, end game sorts, people realize hold certain number seasons, they'll able slowly wipe zombies rebuild society. Low energy! Sad! anti-vax parents afraid vax covid yeah, makes sense. Seems reasonable, (and say someone first dose) mandating vaccines - vaccine manufacturers immune civil liability adds - UK set payment severe disablement outside own.

&amp;#x200B;

However, taking vaccine reducing risk transmission well protecting yourself. seems sensible taken step reduce risk transmission regular testing. instances perfect could catch spread Covid despite measures perfect better nothing. require employees get vaccinated? railing vaccine passports? deep, many students thrived distance learning worry social pressures school like bullying, anxiety, peer pressure conformity. Yes others isolated lonely make seem like k-12 education amazing pre-pandemic kids wasn't. actually really sucked. Soon Child Killer Governor.

You guys voted him. 🤷 mom says I’m really husky. is... thorough rebuke. there’s one thing learned growing up, dumb people every profession. imprecision term ""long covid"" problem. Symptoms lasting longer 4 weeks common. Crippling permanent illness rare. people hear long covid ((the first definition) common freak thinking second common.  wonder many hardcore anitvaxxers got shot recently downlow. Guess trusted immune system all. put better myself. even sad ""good guys"" spreading misinformation. short sighted strategy -- nobody's going trust long term.  People wanting get vaccine would protect others making second class citizens. want live community, abide rules. It’s simple. want get vaccinated disease transmitter, stay home ignorance can’t harm kill others. want part community stuff, get vaccinated, simple that. ""somewhat"" get it. probably top DeSantis bans school districts mandating masks. one successful response this. Everyone trashes surge states states going lull. 

He could say right things virus going whatever regardless. would thought Israel clear staring another lockdown. 

I wanted Biden White House Trump figured would take COVID seriously. definitely case much control really matter end day.  actually serious issue, thanks taking opportunity smart ass typo said yesterday got downvoted oblivion. look India UK cases declined rapidly would assume would happen US. I'm vaccinated encourage others get vaccinated. safe effective, I'm willing bet feel anti vaxxers ignorance.

I'm cheering deaths though. sub human matter Redditor thinks. Delta really fucking everything up. Would also think people like (healthy 18 yo) would need booster top jnj? Airlines normally subcontract ground operations like fueling, bag handlers, etc. Would interested know many employees actually effects besides corporate staff gate/counter agents. Might take look Netflix, then. current job pays far market crap insurance. actually paid us bonus first time year.

Too many hospitals enough staff. Others great. whole pandemic eye opening experience confirming already deeply suspected. awful.

Was used say. still suck, there's 1% bit redeemable quality org now. nobody ever gets prosecuted.  know exact numbers let's assume 70% adults fully vaccinated. There's roughly 280 million adults versus 50 million children (rough numbers close that). leaves 84 million unvaccinated adults versus 50 million children, course every child unvaccinated since 12-18 vaccinated. Assuming every child 12-18 vaccinated makes one third children 0-18, leaves 84 million unvaccinated adults 34 million unvaccinated children.

Heck, even Canada said mix mRNA vaccines need travel, risk.  


Vaccines safe, point tested. Like medication, go outside bounds, science know human body going do. non-Brits here, actually teach biology curriculum. know.... Couldn’t understand part too. sympathy me. stop coddling willfully ignorant. Yeah, phones track much ""microchips"" could vaccines available everywhere.

Asking Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J enter USA would complicate tourism business travel people coming countries vaccines used.
If America could offer vaccination upon arrival, that's great, would partially solve problem, although forced take two different vaccines (for example AstraZeneca country J&amp;J upon arrival America) ideal.

July 2020 Desantis: Yes, hospitals full even though said over. guys... umm... seasonal?

&amp;nbsp;

People angry Desantis concerned CYA getting reelected leader. mean pre covid life includes going work, restaurants, bars, concerts, sporting events, gyms, gatherings friends.. Sooo returned pre covid life.  I'd call hands-on neck approach latest data showing mRNA vaccines 59% serious disease. would guess article correct one. I’ve never study showed J&amp;J higher efficacy mRNA ones. beliefs wrong wrong. Society doesn’t need beliefs. Sorry, sorry. love keep expanding list. rock! problem buddy. watched open round table DeSantis (I'm fan) heads hospital groups across State Florida. big takeaway 95% COVID hospital admissions unvaccinated. One interesting tidbit half vaccinated COVID-positive patients completely asymptomatic admitted (and tested) non-COVID related reasons. Clearly, vaccines effective keeping people hospitals.

Predictably, YouTube comments praise DeSantis open forum accusing hospital administrators spreading lies misinformation vaccines COVID. Anti-vaxers fucking dumb. natural selection work, need conspiracy ;)

people outside food chain, guess modern natural selection looks like humans. also have, typically, 3 week lag reported cases reported deaths. case rise jas past 3 weeks. expect winter scale death rise next month.  Mine caused breakdown awhile back. fun! Yes visited area CA conservative told multiple times need wear mask since COVID fake, people telling visibly angry me. last weekend.

Agree. evidently much, much better nothing, end \~5× hospitalisations vs. full course AZ Pfizer (and presumably Moderna, I'm UK based Moderna barely thing figures I've seen).

I wonder much effective second shot J&amp;J would be, mRNA available reason. Again, opinion. Facts clearly spun support particular point view

As far certain households unvaccinated children, also young school, easy avoid gatherings. really I’m talking here. 

Everyone catch day. Yes. However, children, fucking hope they’re vaccinated catch it.

I'm moderate conservative, many friends, know single person circle refused vax. kids loading groceries Walmart bitching Walmart wants vaccinated want to. doubt conservatives among them.

People believe want believe -- fits narrative. downvote points view.  Yes scary. I’m saying children going die, disabled, suffer either way. I’m saying there’s simple answer. Depends KN95. study back found 70% KN95 (the Chinese standard) fake.

Personally, I'd go 3M N95. failing that, I'd go KF94 (Korean standard). Back number new cases first time, March-May 2020 similar spike deaths. is, averages hundreds per day.

The second spike cases, Nov 2020 - Apr 2021, saw increase deaths, single digits low double digits, even similar increase new cases reported.

This time, seem discernable correlation new cases increased number deaths.

Is particular reason concerned? Vaccines pretty much widely available anyone wants eligible, VAST majority deaths older groups almost completely vaccinated.

It's like lock things wear masks going away going stop mutating. global thing well beyond control. Sure, encourage vaccination, see using scary reporting useful anymore.

I'm 100% willing hear contrary opinion, like I'm anti-vax anything like that(vaccinated follow requested mask guidelines, germane question). IIRC, data shows vast, vast, VAST majority new cases came private gatherings. bother restrictions restaurants bars accounted small percentage spreading?

To help return profitability, small cuts profit sharing 401k distribution, added three mental health personal days year. employees LOVED mental health days much complaints cuts profit sharing 401k. cuts helped minimize price increase consumers. Businesses need get creative. First question is, vaccinated willing get covid?

Seriously. MOM…love dearly boy spouted bullshit involuntarily shouted “what actual fuck, Mom!” (which stopped tracks really try curb swearing around her, lol). months ago.

Biden came office pledging “full-scale wartime effort” beat back coronavirus. frequently compares number Americans died pandemic country’s war dead, contrasting 615,000 covid deaths past 18 months number U.S. soldiers died foreign wars past century.

But president hesitant use full powers available push Americans get vaccinated, experts say could include requiring Americans show vaccinated flying traveling states.

Still, Biden hinted exploring extent authority spur Americans get shots. “It’s still question whether federal government mandate whole country,” Biden said last week response question whether supports vaccine mandates. “I don’t know yet.”

A senior Biden administration official, spoke condition anonymity earlier week frank, said White House believe Biden authority institute nationwide mandate vaccinations.

“Will look sectors federal government make determinations other, know, potential mandates self-attestation programs might effective? Yes,” said official. “The president clear going use every tool available him, ranging bully pulpit various authorities president work try get many people country vaccinated possible.” Responded another, started sore runny nose, felt like seasonal allergies. light fever. im dealing mild dry cough, headaches aches. Also ibs may may related. 


Not nearly bad first time got last year vaccines. scale 1 10, 3 head cold, 6 influenza, would put 4 5. first time vax covid 8.  What’s crazy nurse goes strike lose license. Nursing unions literally schedule strikes hospitals bring outside coverage. makes total sense think it; people die don’t jobs. Except working nurses ground much easier know walk away without plenty head’s literally writing entire career. get tested come internet scare people. viruses still exist.  rich people greatest enemy. Wow much empathy.  sensible people mask. MA, .26% population died Covid regardless vaccination status. **part two**

Several experts noted even President Biden’s team could force Americans begin getting shots soon week, still takes five six weeks mRNA inoculations — require second shot — fully effective. means infection rates could keep rising short term matter steps taken vaccinations.
When asked vaccine mandates Thursday event electric vehicles, Biden said administration looking options encouraged Americans get vaccinated. White House declined comment story.

The talks within administration come amid calls many public health experts aggressive federal approach vaccinations. country reported 100,000 new coronavirus cases Wednesday, infection rate par early February, vaccines widely available. Thursday, rolling seven-day daily average new infections 95,000 new cases.

“I think wisely using federal spending power absolutely right,” said Lawrence Gostin, directs Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute National Global Health Law said discussed idea using federal funds incentive Biden administration officials.
Gostin said suggested White House use power judiciously, “bludgeoning private sector” rather “starting high-risk settings absolute ethical obligation legal obligation keep workers clients safe.”

Other leading experts publicly floated idea using federal incentives push vaccinations lever Biden administration could use.
“If look history, presidents — even absence legal authority — influence people, might say,” said Ezekiel Emanuel, bioethicist University Pennsylvania recently organized joint statement nearly 60 medical groups urging every health facility require workers get vaccinated. “We keep referring covid thing like it’s emergency don’t behave like it’s wartime emergency.” ""Some may die that's risk willing take""

Business leaders, 2020   Yep, going agree there. hospital CEO makes 1 million dollars year (seriously) cutting hospital staff left right past year. say can't afford staff. guess recently got sizable bonus ""hard work""? 

Meanwhile manager husband's department hospital got payroll bonus keeping employees short staffed, worked! Suck toe, aimee. 

Yeah, give F's people see yet denial. That's wonderful. 

SE Asia lowest rates childhood obesity world. sure else post this, actually get straight-forward answers.

 
Vaccines great, understood need push one fast possible high risk. understand they're putting pressure younger age groups low &lt;0.2% CFR get vaccinated order protect others. seems responsible give time access data next 5-10 years, make decision. efficacy rate vaccines 90%, one large study claimed stop spread high risk groups 40-60%. live society 90%+ vaccinations said group, exactly putting risk aside yourself, others decided get vaccine?

 
I understand herd immunity, can't achieved mixture vaccinations natural immunity dependent risk COVID poses age group individual basis? also know added stress hospitals issue, I've seen data suggesting 5 per 100,000 20-39 age group end hospital. tend also underlining health conditions. far mutations, I'm well read all. understanding continue mutate regardless % people vaccinated, less so? 


I'm agenda, really want learn. one media explained well enough actually understand need low risk groups pressured vaccination.  **Posting complete article, please check replies additional parts**

The Biden administration considering using federal regulatory powers threat withholding federal funds institutions push Americans get vaccinated — huge potential shift fight virus far muscular approach getting shots arms, according four people familiar deliberations.

The effort could apply institutions varied long-term-care facilities, cruise ships universities, potentially impacting millions Americans, according people, spoke condition anonymity discuss sensitive conversations.
The conversations early phases firm decisions made, people said. One outside lawyer touch Biden administration issue recommending president use federal powers sparingly.

There particular focus discussions whether restrictions Medicare dollars federal funds could used persuade nursing homes long-term-care facilities require employees vaccinated, according one people familiar talks.

If Biden administration goes forward plans, would amount dramatic escalation effort vaccinate roughly 90 million Americans eligible shots refused unable get them.

The discussion highest level government also signals new phase potential federal intervention White House struggles control delta variant virus, spreading rapidly even dire models predicted.

But drastic moves likely trigger backlash many Republican-leaning regions vaccine hesitancy highest, agitating conservatives already skeptical Biden administration use federal power. administration already said federal workers contractors must vaccinated wear masks, Pentagon considering similar requirements. true  Oh cool we’re North Korea thing  Valid point. guess we’re hearing change tune Would less problem shitty dumbass adults would get vaccinated. kids teachers parents going suffer. looked EMA's website useless press release data sources cited, contain definition considered menstrual disorder.

Im guessing don’t deal lot fish… Second class citizenship.

That's definitely said. Seriously, read comment. still there.

Also comes next? I've seen couple people ask comes next seem answer. pretty clear clue. This. Vaccinated people much less likely contract pass virus. everyone vaccinated R0 value would almost certainly go 1 would go extinct.

Obviously there's logistics problems make impossible vaccination would absolutely lower R0 value slow spread enough hospitals overwhelmed.

The hospital closest 103% ICU capacity right now. next closest hospital 30 minutes away. That's really bad. even filled last year worst time. headline quote misleading.

People *with breakthrough infections* viral load unvaccinated infected people.

The vaccines quite effective preventing breakthrough infections.

Additionally, vaccinated people breakthrough infections clear virus faster, contagious long.

Both things reduce transmission vaccinated. bright side also living country filled idiots get paid kill themselves😩 I'm guessing benefits masking going school strike balance best remote school school without masks, lot fools crying behalf children, proven resilient willing needed around peers - adults want use political war nonpolitical issue. *Sigh* Pilots special breed. highly skilled, highly trained , generally speaking highly educated individuals ... often certain political view, result covid became clear many anti-vax.

Delta came around things changed say NEVER said lie several people saying never did. Another day, another fear mongering headline used fuel antivaxxers read article. vaccinated already? Good news, still worry long covid. wish info well hospitalization &amp; death short term. someone got J&amp;J, makes feel *tad* reassured. Paywalled, argument involvement bad source early somehow means entire subject long Covid house cards? 

The catch term “Long Covid” imprecise describes probably collection distinct disorders, sure, don’t care semantic argument there. that’s point cede you. focus notion that’s increasingly verifiable concerning potential long term sequela exist Covid infection. Yeaaaaaa nurse that’s like good 20% patients. that’s guy. girls unit get harassed way Glad TX least getting higher pay.

That's resurgence actual outbreaks easily preventable diseases. Whooping cough, measles, mumps outbreaks pockets past couple years, almost exclusively unvaccinated kids.

Now vaccines gotten politicized, probably going get worse. Exactly co-worker coughing 3 days, fever refuses get tested says.

That turned pretty good analogy experience. Wise people look facts/data *first* form opinions based information. Unwise people opinions first try find facts/data validate opinions. Looking Phase 3 study, hospitalisation different moderate/severe disease: 

""The ENSEMBLE data demonstrated Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine 85 percent effective severe/critical disease.

THEY WORK IT. I’m sorry, don’t really get feel need lash post.

Personally, look statistics feel assured. think suggests lower risks one would think spent day sub saw frequent stories kids vents kids dying.

Maybe look statistics differently. interpretation certainly isn’t valid one

But don’t get need call naive patronizing looking data coming conclusion… Yeah, know covid stay we'll reach balance point it. I'm hoping delta last variant worried though. way burning US population may make end closer confers natural immunity people. tell people get it. job, career (meanwhile...15 years later I'm still it).

Get outta Smash Mouth, completely inappropriate! We've established earlier *not* temporary, NIH studies showing increase risk heart attack road.

You keep bringing false equivalencies. myocarditis worth 10% boost immunity? 5%? Unless studies start comparing myocarditis efficacy different vaccines mind, bad faith ignore heart inflammation.

If someone 90% immunity Pfizer, 1/5,000 risk myocarditis - I've continually shown - 70% immunity J&amp;J, risk myocarditis, let's compare option better young men high risk group.

I brought data need, keep ignoring it. good day. super jealous it. could completely isolate little Covid. open majority time without worry seemed wonderful.

Obviously I’m could totally wrong. zero Covid possible long term. government seem think is? that’s still strategy doesn’t seem like cut rest world much longer. also don’t understand vaccines? Starting feel depressed. far, county masked mandates place (yet), like everywhere else cases going up. County well vaxxed, eligible total. Unfortunately, every county around (for part) mandates starting....I feel like fish water, actually virus, later vaccine (I early). Due that, I've read very, instances double infections virus vaccine (and people virus, vaccine). I'm even sure CDC brought yet.

It's sort of, well, downer starting get bit, trying meet people, this. hope US (in northeast) quiets soon. follow anyone twitter (I even 'have' it, google twitter updates) experts, I'm sure experts like Scott Gottlieb currently saying.

I also understand CDC changed guidance either, that's me. heard yesterday expect cases go vaccinations (but severe). logic seems be, higher cases, higher hospitalizations, always case? 70% country High Substantial transmission think counties low hospitalizations (though all) great transmission). believe likely approved yet.

Forcing someone take unapproved treatment could legal issues imagine (ianal).

Once approved though, imagine companies, especially personal health insurance companies require it. Sustainability ironically enough lead short term health managers leaders competent enough think way. fire jail siblings people break law country.

People tired wearing year half, people day everyday. blame one bit sick it. easy say. it’s also worth nothing delta strain much contagious even common cold flu basically matter time everyone encounters it, 50% vaccination rate we’re at. think states need go get rid possibility fake cards. still people absolutely convinced children can't get it, let alone die it. family people. hated playing D&amp;D online quarantine. hard concentrate, hard hear people saying, constantly dealing technical issues. don’t care full-blown zombie apocalypse, I’m going back online gaming ever again. three pilots know represent entire pilot crew airline? Lol Yeah I've thraxxed 19% Oregons cases July breakthrough cases risk lower, higher previously assumed.  90 something percent hospital unvaxxinated can’t make determination without knowing testing capacity positivity rate. I’m sorry. You’re stronger could ever hope be. they’re requiring siblings quarantine. Bobby comes COVID brother Timmy allowed keep going school. He's actively sabotaging efforts control spread. funny. People died. Yeah energy go...oh yeah masks FREEDOM don’t understand argument kids don’t get bad.

That’s technically true. kids, especially younger ones, ***nasty hell***.

They pick nose, don’t wash hands often don’t cover mouth sneeze. knew kids growing who’d see long go without hand washing. Yeah I've used metal worker. get P rating dealing aerosol oil. get R N rated ones, protective COVID P except environment oil. That's literally difference. Since N95 recommendation, literally filter NIOSH particle rating would work. Obviously higher number better, letter rating fairly inconsequential unless environment would negate protection filter.

And record, that's mask used use operating twin spindle lathe, protect breathing oil in. That's know stuff. Dr.Bobby Bobby agrees moon!!! even Pastafarians could break explain better, need know familiar viral replication mechanics innate cellular-level immune system works....  kind agree this. easier bash Sturgis red state...but considering open things everywhere, see different like big concerts happening NY. imagine older folks. Old people tend understand they'll die get it. yet countries covid control, government enacted policies prevent spread early on. Yes Tuskeegee experiment real. started 1932 ended 1972. Fifty years ago. relevance whatsoever vaccines Covid. Anti-vax people throw everything wall see sticks. 

Blacks may mistrustful government medical programs it, make sense context. vaccine clinical trials whites enrolled racial group. whites vaccinated racial group US. Hundreds millions people around world vaccinated- blacks Africa ones complaining countries getting enough vaccine. Wondering folks like 2 dose J&amp;J trial could also benefit mRNA booster.  Can’t wait randomized controlled trial 2030 Florida least 3x new cases every state. feel same. I’m fully vaccinated 2 unvaccinated kids I’d rather none us get sick. still get groceries delivered go (fully masked) doctor’s appointments. finally felt comfortable enough go dentist 1.5 years felt uncomfortable whole time didn’t mask on. We’re keeping 7yo home again, least things improve. We’re tired it’s infuriating we’ve done everything needed - got vaccinated, wore masks, stayed home, gatherings, we’re still nowhere closer end crap year ago parents Jehovah’s Witness religion encouraged members get vaccinated. also haven’t congregating since March 2020. don’t see religious exemption exists it’s ridiculous. Probably preach extreme churches don’t allow people masks discourage vaccine sermons. Hm. Seems working.... Unfortunately lockdowns, average American gained 2lbs month daily steps reduced 27% promote healthy lifestyle. Either way (vaccination not) delta seems burn population quite fast. Germany prior infection subsequent antibodies test counts much first shot. need/get one shot get vaccination certificate like people 2 shots infection.

Though count infections within last 6 months. Tim Fox Governor Jeez. Sorry man... (Or woman!) 199 deaths per day? That's extreme, we're 25 Germany like four times population. Well theoretically, someone can’t take religious beliefs, they’re *supposed* continue wear masks, distance, etc. isn’t necessarily putting everyone else unnecessary harm since that’s we’ve year. Whether people *actually* fall category actually continue so… don’t know %. Good policy! Fuck United Airlines anyway!    think care trusted doctors say media comes reaching rural residents, large majority rural Americans (86%) say trust doctor health care provider provide reliable information COVID-19 vaccine.

""The long run"" null phrase them. Everyone still forgets lab testing. OK though, we're used it. 🤣  agree healthcare workers (nurses, EMT's, support staff), doctors US get paid lot Canada Europe? 

Regardless, still issue lot getting siphoned administrations, companies provide supplies pharmaceuticals. mention insurance companies.  think hospital staff hover around burnout days. crisis could easily tip over.

We ask patients drink Monster, Full Throttle energy drinks health indications. sell energy drinks hospital cafeteria. true sign “return normal.” I’m truly worried catching Covid, since trust vaccine prevent dying even become infected. can’t wait longer need go whole process tracking cases, isolating long periods time, disrupting plans even case asymptomatic. understand we’re quite yet, vaccines kids approved, time rip band-aid soon follow. don’t know real KN95 supposed able stop (as others posted, there’s fake ones afoot) real N95 obviously much tighter seal KN95s I’ve used.  Well anxiety real condition. Taking sick time ""brilliant hilarious"". last job laid third developers ""because covid"". Never mind flailing years covid. Never mind stock price stagnant years. Never mind new CEO came right covid promising make things ""lean"". No, totally covid.

And freaking productivity down. least Governor, Greg Abbot, showing leadership preventing mask mandates working voter suppression bills. good news is, you’re vaccinated you’re good. You’re unlikely severe case die stop letting live rent free head. :) hope gets better ASAP. I'll go ahead say 'Happy Birthday' advance. retired health care...my heart all...I imagine, day live in...also family members still health care Chicago...worry alot...I get  Yeah, agree this. scares strain like delta high enough viral load infect vaccinated people would indicate going give disease much better population evolve quickly circumvent antibodies vaccine. 

It's obviously statistics basically exposure populations ripe that. Delta come nation feasibly could vaccinated people quickly, suck may providing building blocks next evolutionary step. 

Your point hospitals also right. wild impacting US whole rather specific localities chosen outcome. metro even south still ok ICU hospital capacity. bit hinterland mess. explains lack vaccination among black people then? Trying white libs? I'm sure really understand real option reduce spread vaccination.

I vaccination. sure thought saying. quoted statement true. Masking, social distancing, cleaning surfaces, ventilation, washing hands (just name few) reduces spread virus. Right? eligible vaccinated going do?

Again, I'm sure trying say here. think kids vaccinated available. expand question? saying school? allow vaccinated unvaccinated students schools together? Again, post clear, sorry. Taste smell came back week got COVID? got better? get tested contacted symptoms. Tell us know anecdote without saying know anecdote is. mind ya business Doubtful vaccinated, area appears third population vaccinated unfortunately. sure tried best making pizzas though. Hell. half staff covid making them. Always lol. Like “half family died hospital look beautiful $4k diamond neckless bought gift shop!” Maybe one day they’ll convert places casinos build actual hospitals. Tiny chance vaccine side effects  ooorrrrr moderate chance getting long covid Hmmmm onboard years health individual I'm sitting tight. Well think really need students can't get vaccine yet. greatly reduces logistical financial problem. Yup! I've lost 70 pounds. always knew fat would kill abstract concept. COVID showed fat could kill tomorrow. know would ever gotten serious without COVID. NC going real crisis month given current pace new cases hospitalizations: vaccinations could lot better least 65s well Im vaccinated live hotspot state. city decently vaccinated surrounding areas filled antivaxxers. It’s incredibly unfair back position everything right last year… top off, already 1.5 years. 

I honestly don’t even know solution antivaxxers country also realize majority world still unvaccinated due lack access. Variants likely arise long continue living like this? long continue accept restrictions? fully vaccinated friends going back reposting cdc graphs, wear mask memes, “stay home safe” it’s sort ridiculous considering fully vaccinated good levels protection. seems big disconnect complete intolerance risk, makes sense. don’t see healthy sustainable. wear mask necessary I’m private events family friends know vaccinated don’t see need it… think cdc screwed may changing recommendations prematurely result due delta surge, antivaxxers emboldened super cautious scared shadow again. We’re bad spot. 100% true Corporations: ""EMPLOYEES GET BACK OFFICE! REMOTE WORK YOU!!!""

Because body makes mRNA protein synthesis breaks vaccine constituent nucleic acids recycling fairly quickly. putting anything already you. mRNA blueprint make spike protein safer injecting live attenuated virus stop think it.

Well risk non-existent mRNA vaccine. honestly probably they're aware 80%+ cases 95%+ hospitalizations fully vaccinated people  Wait, AY.3? case number AY.3 WA state exploded last half July, like 3 AY.1 ~30 AY.2. vaccinated, odds getting infected low, odds get hospitalized tiny, odds die LOWER got flu. point, vaccinated people tired looking unvaccinated people.

That mentality could hold covid disease existence.

You vaxxed still medical emergency accident totally independent covid, still die “because it” hospital space receive attention.

More Ron DeSantis stupidity. risk RSV children much higher COVID-19 RSV around decades. vaccine RSV. cancel daycare school permanently. I’m trying ass think id genuinely important question recent towing charge + ticket suddenly seem big. 134,500 new cases reported week, last week 110,420 week 73,000 change. Almost doubled 2 weeks!

Florida like double case count California right It’s important note RSV virus driving far massive strain pediatric ERs inpatient units PICUs COVID. nursing shortage huge effect well. surge COVID another factor system overwhelmed, one factor vaccinated people can’t help feel bit like “suckers,” Chapman said. Many people covered dutifully awaiting shots, tossed masks aside government said could—only reel whiplash last week’s switcheroo. guidelines unvaccinated (that is, keep masking) haven’t changed, immunized called upon act. “Asking people mask triggering lot emotional stuff,” Lindsey Leininger, public-health-policy expert Dartmouth, told me. “You can’t tell people feelings invalid.”

This true, shows tremendous damage CDC others overselling vaccine, relaxing mask requirements vaccinated. simply maintained existing masking requirements, cases would lower now, pervasive feeling failure backsliding associated resuming use masks. Instead, people would feeling done smart thing continuing wear masks.

Those writing history pandemic certainly point incident big screw-up. 
""You take total number unvaccinated, positive, individuals hospitalized divide number total unvaccinated positive cases. gives percentage, telling you, okay x unvaccinated cases end hospital. thing vaccinated cases, divide total vaccinated cases hospital total vaccinated cases period. compare two percentages say ""oh okay, 20% vaccinated cases end hospital 50% unvaccinated cases end hospital"". pretty basic math word problem.""

I mostly talking death rates. numbers mentioned work.

While agree many engineers step outside lane, like mentioned quote above, pretty basic math. 35.6 million cases us, 615k deaths... 615,000/35,600,000=0.017275=1.75% (rounded clean number). 1.75% death rate US. rate would lower getting today 2 reasons. less 50yo 95% deaths 50 according AARP. ( ).And medical field much better ways treat sticking ventilator like start.

So let's go step further, 5% 615,000 deaths 64.7% 35,600,000 cases apply people age 50. 

0.05*615,000= 30,750 deaths
0.647*35,600,000= 23,033,200 cases

30,750/23,033,200= 0.001335= 0.133% death rate people age 50 united states.

Remember like 10-15 years ago people arms saying vaccines kids autism refused vaccinate kids. time ago HPV vaccine pushed super hard. years later studies saying cause infertility, premature ovarian failure, ovarian cancer. find vax 10-15 years? 

I'll take chances 0.134% death rate. N95 enough? What's next masking plan pal?  phase 3 trial J&amp;J, efficacy hospitalization 100% (95% confidence interval 74.3 100).

If google ""johnson johnson vaccine"" see results recent SA trial reported, results 67% effectiveness hospitalization Beta variant 71% effectiveness hospitalization Delta variant.

These numbers obviously pretty different. Oh shit. Didn’t know high. vouchers undermine public education. allow public school institute mitigating strategies. give vouchers private schools please sets parents, anti pro. think control thing. 

People think control getting virus wearing mask avoid getting injected vaccine, therefore avoiding COVID ""risks"" associated vaccine.  Pete Parada choose get Vaccine, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, got kicked band Medical Condition. countries begging vaccines tossing trash. Gross. That's word come with. think result nothing equally disastrous party. Incumbents lose re-election country unless third party throws wrench works (aka Ross Perot). think speaks volumes people expected chief executive. among vaccinated patients hospitalized, J&amp;J shots? mean? 80% enough EVERYONE took it. eradicated polio 60% effective vaccine. Life get back normal highly effective vaccine (even deaths/hospitalizations). everyone got vaccine, life literally go back normal.

The facts get vaccinated, risk COVID low, comparable cold/flu, evne though COULD spread get infected, really spreading unvaccinated people (you're spreading vaccinated well, much lower degree, R0 among vaccinated population practically 0). going stop protecting unvaccinated people restricting lives people told? everyone eligible got vaccine, nightmare over.

My bottom line: stop forcing restrictions vaccinated people. punishing us letting unvaccinated people get free passes continue selfish (I'm talking doznes millions willfully unvaccinated, kids &lt;12). Look cases specimen UK past days 

This article may today referencing survey thats days old. decrease cases definitely plateaued, check discussion R/coronavirusuk

It refers week ending July 31st see upside left individual discretion vs mandated, besides appealing vague sense individualism personal liberty anyone know scientific papers studies done COVID-19 cases among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people?

Not mention would cut continued rise medical costs covid patients. Listen, I’m Arkansas. one “hotspots”. 

-our governor WONT anything. can’t even reverse mask ban place publicly admitting regretted signing it. 

-we can’t get community transmissions lack precautions place. Everything open. Arkansas, one undereducated states, people literally acting like covid here. distance, barely mask wearing, low low rate vaccinations, huge get togethers. 

-the schools ability enact mask wearing. kids wearing mask work intended. Parents literally forced send children death traps less two weeks. hospitals full. mention local district decided virtual year k-6 (which absolutely crazy kids CANNOT vaccinated) 

-the state sued multiple people last ditch effort drop stupid mask ban it’s looking possible far. Two school districts (Little Rock Marion, one started two weeks ago, already 800 children quarantine) suing state. Parents suing…..Little Rock mayor defied ban put mask order place Little Rock cannot enforce legally. 

-our hospitals full. FULL. nurses staff literally walking job frustration exhaustion. medical system close possible state emergency collapse causes deaths ways. icu beds means help car accidents victims, strokes, heart attacks name it. transfer patients Denver Dallas beds. 

-even got people mask vaccinate now, it’s late stop surge. It’s started it’s going get worse it’s better. 

-the kids dying either vaccinated parents, old enough. One kids died 11 died within hours symptoms getting worse. One parent lost 16 year old STILL refuses get vaccinated. cannot argue uneducated people here. 

Your comment may well meaning trust say, it’s simple. 


Also, anyone reads far, vaccination breakthroughs delta strain horrible. know many people sick vaccinated.

I've read Delta show within 2 days, 6 days sounds well within time frame, too. We're waiting contact tracing complete see gives us ideas. Australia bought fifty million doses this. think approved yet. Really hoping mask mandates permanent near permanent thing.

I'm okay want wear masks rest life yourself. personal choice. even like oft-cited Asia comparison. Okay. think made great points really changed mind topic. work? concern? vaccine best defense have, *know* reduces chance hospitalization death COVID. data ages 15% vaccinated, hospitalized COVID patients I’d bet money 70+ comorbidities.

(For record someone wanted see lockdown one left homes except get essentials couple months.) asked nearly dozen infectious-disease experts week set new benchmark—the next bellwether signal vaccinated divorce pandemic-level masking. Everyone agreed one thing: isn’t clear-cut answer, yet.

I'm camp ""this ain't sustainable""  Can't fucking wait! Vaccines always mandatory military. Troops get vaccines diseases never even heard of. 

If argument simply wanted wait full FDA approval, understand that. love it, understand it. However, seems though troops want refuse vaccine vaccine.

You would? penalties washing hands? fined cough cover? Everyone gets sick leave? would say incorrect assessment. insult intelligence want. Unless show math numbers support claim, think 1.75% death rate (which likely lower feel like finding numbers prove I'll stick 1.75%) worth non approved vaccine, especially considering even approved vaccines negative effects years road. getting COVID 100% guarantee survival rate would 98.25%. getting COVID guarantee.

You're talking bunch different things need clarify need numbers on. far aware, discussing people unvaccinated less likely hospitalized compared vaccinated. None numbers provided relevant discussion. Remember word problems sometimes throw additional numbers relevant throw off? Yes that's doing. discussing Rates compared things kill. comparing car accidents. current discussion vaccinated vs unvaccinated hospital rates. That's all. Saying ""oh there's something entirely unrelated kills more"" valid argument entirely ignore put effect laws something wife engineers,

If look comments (not here, general) see make LOT comments engineers thinking know things topics outside engineering engineer math. actually hate engineers general attitude see LOT people like you. Yes engineer good you. know anything POPULATION statistics epidemiology or, idk, PEOPLE matter? Usually engineers touch antisocial people, really want say things like there's nothing worse someone knows little one field thinking makes master all. leave sort work people actually trained stop looking car accident rates validation scared needles. Exactly. anti vaxxers use support cause vaxxers use argue societal controls need vaccines. Every scientific study mortality seroprevalence China points death figures pretty accurate.

In Wuhan, epicenter initial outbreak, percent population antibodies virus: Outside Wuhan, numbers even lower.

Excess mortality due pneumonia Wuhan initial outbreak 4500: forget, numbers seemed large back January/February 2020. US passed China infections people started questioning China's numbers. China locked extremely hard, way places world (other Australia, Vietnam countries well China). pandemic basically ended China around March 2020. large waves since. sure. guess far cases round past I’m sure feel way. I'd love see breakdowns age brackets. 0-18 pretty ridiculous way report figures helpful attempting assess risk children. 

Unless ages kids equally risk, seems unlikely.  Agreed. believe covid mainly airborne, new articles suggesting spread due surface contact. 


Especially don’t know front mask (covid), don’t know doff protective gear. 

You correct. work health field sanitize everything patient leaves room, specific protocol covid 19. 

???Let know hospital would like hear different practice put place. 

Thanks stay safe healthy I'm already back full-time cubicle farm windows. back saying told us August stuck August even changing events. That’s complete insanity! I’m former athlete, oil gas worker 40 years old putting 100hr/wks critical health, nutrition fueling body. Nothing ever come diet. Nothing. Good respecting sons choices. didn’t see anything vaccination status husband. article said infected them, wondering, vaccinated? child 2, obviously vaccinated. Also wondering another J&amp;J vaccinated person mRNA? peaked UK due high vaccination rate. peak ""any day now"" areas &lt;50% vaccinated. Similarly, hit ""everyone"" same. risk kids comparable chickenpox. Worth vaccinating changing life around. vaccinated grandparents still highest risk. feel threatened this. I'm vaccinated, wear mask asked, that's that. Today worked couple hours inside favorite coffee shop, ""strongly recommends"" mask, couple months without even suggesting, let alone requiring one. indoor seating actually *expanded* since last week. wore mask done coffee, nbd.

Delta change rules nearly much sold. difference lot unvaccinated people choosing gamble getting sick, losing. I've already done work last 5 years accept population's self-destructive streak; see get they're asking affects mental health marginally. end game travel cases fizzling vaccine saturated population. infected person may quite likely infect vaccinated family member friend, vaccine advantage plus sensible behaviour around cluster keep going exponential.  false. vaccine greatly reduces chance infections spreading covid.

I feel antivaxxer spreading lies. Source claim vaccines stop symptoms. San Francisco one highest vaccination rates country, Covid cases increased 25x past 6 weeks, still rising.

It’s seems likely delta variant spreads well enough among vaccinated people everyone goes back indoor bars restaurants, riding transit without perfect mask use, house parties, etc., virus going rip community, despite vaccinations.

Thankfully vaccinated people see rare severe cases, asymptomatic mildly symptomatic infections. unvaccinated people going protected. seems likely people catch Covid sometime year, unless take extreme personal precautions. might able stomach 'learn live it' 'go back normal' brigade current wave hitting children hard. Like, get it, sucks. barbarous children breathing tubes inspire change? 😂😂 happen 6-8 weeks. seriously overreacting Delta ..get vaxxed wear masked indoors fine require every student wear mask, student harassed.... Still true 'lockdown' like done countries. Thank this. Thank you. I'm college student normal end highschool good little taste college everything spun around. However, seeing incoming freshman/ rising sophomores experience online far, feel most.

Education really online, I'm sure know well. Here's hoping things spin around better sometime soon. 54 kids many.

Wear masks. Hospitalizations always percentage cases. enough find percentage is. vaccinate above-average-risk people it'll drop, certainly wealthy countries. point still stands either way. countless gatherings happening daily across country one talks about, whatever gathering NY Times reports day one gets demonized sub.  Good. Universities businesses, need make money. universities come conclusion go remote semester, many students reach tipping point get tired paying 60k dollars zoom university simply drop out, incoming freshmen won’t come all. 

Not mention missing money get students living dorms. almost every college country, going fully remote option. gerrymander Tom Segura's fence around Louisianna include South Dakota. big deal 80% city vaxxed one shot least, deaths NYC still low cases high. listen big media carefully, renewed emphasis importance economy covid recovery. go back life, who's gonna die gonna die (mostly unvaccinated) comes across loud clear. thing collapses keep growing, enriching top. Imagine antivaxxer, lmfao. Catholics *Jehova's Witnesses* shit together better you. Sturgis isn’t “people outside riding bikes”. It’s two-four week long town takeover. half million people. 1 shot doesn’t provide much protection. might keep hospital local news San Francisco surrounding area. California lockdown place months, recall election governor coming up, it’s doubtful he’ll reinstate form lockdown anytime soon.  Please walk that. *have* children dying 'but kids!' crowd would like ignore fact.  


***ANY*** children *needlessly* dying ***too many already.***  


I've never wanted kids *still* can't imagine parents must going through. *still* hope parents go this, but, are. :( According news Israel started restrictions week. Whereas can't find anything Romania all. 

It weird, Israel could weeks ahead delta timeline. Agreed. cut wasn’t even normal standards time either :( similar last summer wave Sunbelt Texas, Flordia, AZ deep southern states got hit hard. 6 weeks receded significantly without vaccines. I'm concerned, Delta pass within 4-6 weeks. take hit now.  really see point. data Canada UK (where gave AZ first dose, Pfizer second dose, millions people) roughly good two doses Pfizer. protected anybody else. “The definition insanity thing expecting different result”

-Albert Einstein

What worked COVID-19 work well COVID-21 (aka Delta). No, fundamentally understanding issue.

Vaccinated people okay socializing sensible degrees spread low. (Sensible mean packed intimate party)

It's spread pumped insane levels UNVACCINATED EVERYONE needs mask behave cautiously tamps levels challenge imorrtant, imperfect individual vaccine protection. 

That's contagious disease vaccines work - individual protection part it, actual safety comes everyone vaccinated.

Until baring unvaccinated fun parts life achieved goal that's played reduced spread,your thest us still going exercise sensible precautions.

Denying reality every bit much head-in-sand people refused vaccine gave numbers, address, continue list numbers support argument.

Both wife engineers, know math, hard follow math NUMBERS.

You say rules driving get numbers down, Covid. about, wash hands, sanitizer, cover cough, sick stay home, see someone sick stay away them. would relate speed limits stop lights.

You insult intelligence want. Unless show math numbers support claim, valid.

Personally, think 1.75% death rate (which likely lower feel like finding numbers prove I'll stick 1.75%) worth non approved vaccine, especially considering even approved vaccines negative effects years road. 

Even getting COVID 100% guarantee survival rate would 98.25%. getting COVID guarantee.  Yes. FDA required six months data full approval completed Pfizer submitted May Moderna weeks later. FDA reviewing (It’s hundreds thousands pages). People intentionally misrepresenting fact trial participants continue followed 2022 2023 whatever meaning vaccine experimental then. No, subjects continue followed long FDA approval collect long term data- happens antibody levels different populations, etc. routine. chance ton bad stuff could happen life. greater chance dying car crash way job getting breakthrough infection leads brain damage. NEVER zero risk life. I’m sorry loss normalcy past two years though 😔 work education know students definitely suffered pandemic, it’s frustrating see experience politicized 🥺 personal thoughts need stop stressing cases unless hospitalizations go up, looking southern states. cases going Ohio fairly rapidly. 

Florida enigma vaccinated national average. Time find new barber. Yeah noticed too. airplanes well

I remember flying ebola scare (2014) acutely aware whenever someone coughed airport plane. Heard none airport, heard 1 plane 5 hours 

Now I'm hearing 2-3 coughs hour Definitely, things lol. worst part work store really hold customers accountable little protect employees. 9 employee covid cases last Tuesday. I'm best, people community taking Delta seriously :(  71 detected cases Minnesota. It’s combination social media, social engineering, lack quality education imho. one could managed required, three together end situation seems matter try approach it, there’s always rebuttal, matter incorrect poorly informed/supported. laughter sadness ? Yeah that's one state donating to. Fuck that. got asked for. Arrogance deserve empathy. get see photo-op honor, governor, visiting people COVID wards ? Demonstrating first hand masks required. Everybody sub losing shit people outside riding bikes somehow turning global epicenter covid every baseball stadium, bar, nightclub, festival packed across country summer nobody talks identified elusive super spreader hasn’t happened despite much worse disregard covid places. 

It’s whatever gathering happens news page day one demonized, ones can’t skim article fine. Well, Mesa also one lower vax rates states We've never even first real legit 'lockdown'. way would even able attempt one now. biggest reason wanting get dose lol. like idea messing data. EDIT: Although state top 10 vaccinations right now, big deal. Without contact tracing, notify parents? April–June 2021, COVID-19 cases caused Delta variant increased rapidly Mesa County, Colorado. Compared Colorado counties, incidence, intensive care unit admissions, COVID-19 case fatality ratios, proportion cases fully vaccinated persons significantly higher Mesa County. **Crude vaccine effectiveness symptomatic infection estimated 78% Mesa County 89% Colorado counties.** go Florida. collateral damage. smart governor's do.

Unlike moRon Florida deaths (39,403) Australia cases (35,688) despite Florida’s far higher vaccination rates similar population.  Check extensive channel. he's board-certified Pulmonary doctor Covid unit specialist. Watch video decide strikes someone worth listening to. call. covid19 sub might good place It’s called Wook Flu  Aye post PCR test require travel mail box. Lateral flow done 100% home.

Fair point trusting people properly though guess. nations seem decent success home testing though. bad. work healthcare setting. wearing damn mask properly. see OPs argument time. say “New Zealand, *that’s* lockdown!” doesn’t change fact California implemented far-reaching drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions. 

The real issue didn’t seem much effect viral transmission. parent two young kids, think pretty selfish. still know little long term effects Covid delta variant seems dangerous children previous variants. don’t want wear mask bar, that’s fine. grocery store, etc., I’d hope you’d considerate. Don’t ever go FL again, actually. Take $$$ elsewhere. I'm asthmatic, never heard correlation. drink smoothies everyday. long fibre accompany sugar, slows blood absorption decreases gylcemic index. like throwing piece paper fire vs log wood. body feeds sugar glucose powers brain. democracy allows people things self interest--like getting sick-- good democracy.  appear true according this? Yeah. dont know genome current one exactly, since Florida, assume vanilla covid last year, delta now


Thanks internet stranger. Ill take luck get malicious comment, see what's wrong it. looked uncomfortable looked frustrated, rude anything. get they're mandated work trying help. Source? sure hope it’s greater three pilots know, 90% vaccination rate strongly disputes claim. People masked distanced testing centres. drive though option. 

The actual test higher quality, people home might swab correctly, actually post it. 

Source me, get test yesterday I'm talking purely UK party political strategy perspective here, rather liberals conservatives general. Obviously Conservative line Boris great haters dickheads, opposition line COVID much COVID count success. Humanity will; might not. Ready roll dice? Hospitals for-profit. enough “lockdown” shutter thousands small businesses, cause massive spikes unemployment, homelessness, mental health issues, domestic violence, non-Covid related bad health outcomes, etc etc etc. 

I agree, “lockdown” minimal effect viral transmission. call whatever want, can’t pretend didn’t implement drastic damaging non-pharmaceutical interventions.   First agree large extent. need get vaccinated. back February glad did.

But fairness can't blame person getting upset comment mask. really think would end well? Hear out! call ""lung lice""? Cases really stay plateau, though. r 1, fall. r 1, rise. cases plateauing right pause way either continued decline another rise.

I think another rise would terrible situation. weather much better now. idea ongoing plateau really work. bet lot may never know unless come would never save face. actually know someone got day people found forgot take bandaid confessed secret. think that's funniest shit ever. Texas. Feds, please something Alberta screws whole country. J&amp;J shot pretty intense side effects night, feverish, bad chill couldnt brush teeth shaking much. 


Other arm pain injection sight Yeah, costs money...and particular hospital fingers lot outpatient facilities live. I'm considering it. smallpox vaccine invented, Pope Pius VII ecstatic praised invention gift divine providence sign God's love time later Pope Pius IX mandated vaccination Papal States financial incentives. law Papal States described refusal vaccination ""reprehensible conduct"" punishable loss financial benefits warned ""a deep-rooted prejudice stronger parents love offspring."" Coughing clinics wait line get coughed think Japan chose vaccines foreign ones initially, put order foreign vaccines, order last line. Supposedly 17 Japanese companies working vaccines, heard news yet. Yeah, that’s don’t social media Yep. traditional school model seems 25% academics 75% learning cope (or not) dysfunctional society. Canada followed similar strategy. Except opened earlier.

We see works. ask Chicago using testing centres rather sending tests people's homes stay home think they're infected?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Prefer say exact age. early 30s main voice calling boosters company sells vaccines.

The reason hear sources, though, interplay cells antibodies. Antibodies protect ever infected all, body eventually stops making them. cells, make cells make antibodies, stay around much longer -- years decades even forever, depending virus. body defended cells antibodies, still protection serious illness, body taken surprise get mild infection easily. Studies confirmed response vaccination, body's T-cell production robust.

So basically, looking % vaccinated hopes completely stopping spread, sure, express concern. looking % vaccinated hopes saving lives, nothing worry about. personally, think many vaccine deniers there, stopping spread fool's errand, giving everybody opportunity survive covid something we've already achieved, changing. Well, tell work food service public facing jobs get it. Karens best handled customer service people life experience. Maybe Delta's R₀ least 3 , vaccine 50 % effective 3 \* 0.5 1 might hint?  Went annual physical i'm pretty frustrated. told employees vaccinated, ""mostly young ones want it"", course they're ones wearing masks holding walk by.

One young woman checking mask loose, told could knot back tighten barked back ""can't breathe like can't breathe can't job check in"".

Shouldn't surprise say i'm Florida. Like, thanks taking temperature door Brenda breathing everyone's face maskless, what's fucking point? Thankful i'm vaccinated Florida frustrating. struck couple reasons, supposedly one Arkansas legislature passed another bill mask mandate ban accidentally used code number ban. Republicans made typo forgot update code number, overwrote ban. can't enforced longer exists. Hilarious.  happen Arkansas, surely common sense also happen Texas right? (Our governor also instituted bans mask mandates versed Texas current events). understand mentality completely. vaccinated, odds getting infected low, odds get hospitalized tiny, odds die LOWER got flu. point, vaccinated people tired looking unvaccinated people. ""Right thing do"" decide everyone else. Lockdown, staying home, masks, affect people ways might understand. Again, vaccinated STILL make sacrifices willingly unvaccinated? since get Covid much unvaccinated people, spread less well (and vaccinated people spread less, media disingenuously interpreting CDC data)

And children 12? Covid cold/flu vast majority time. Interestingly protecting grandma we're protecting &lt;12.

You're fine whatever want, tell vaccinated people version ""right thing"" Yea risk I’m willing take based numbers there. child likely won’t get covid likely mild case, want child enjoy normal school experience. That’s preference kid doesn’t wear mask day school. However will, think we’ll go back say masking kids likely actually useful protective them.  breaks heart say this, unfortunately think right. guy real fuck face feel guilty spreading Fair take. another mutation takes hold and/or current vaccines fail ""fizzle"" transmissions? back social distancing, mask requirements, coerced drug intake? sustainable that? seems endless. low plateau cases, high vaccine rates low death counts ask for

Of course, 30,000 cases day really low plateau measure. imagine work way back down, though. needed study figure out? China’s sudden flatline cases wasn’t suspicious all. Pun intended might get big surprise 4 6 weeks. ready. absolutely true, definitely make work, experience (not mine, fiancé's). personal health insurance (which turns better employer-provided insurance, live), plus liability insurances, etc., come bit $1000/month more, makes easily $4000 month.

It's moronic system imho, Be, result inefficiencies built said moronic system. said, available, take it. ""Most vetted vaccines history"", yet FDA approved, given blanket legal immunity. kids literally dying like yeah need socialize that's important 

a child socializing year remedied later. covid them? 

also 2 kids lol socialize other. boom problem solved IIRC kinda forced way lexicon,  know. sure I'm downvoted totally oppose policy, scientifically quite interesting. thanks employers force employees go office unnecessarily Laissez faire COVID policy 😵‍💫  Yep. He's hands-on pro virus. Statistically speaking bigger concern.

You spend seconds near employee highly ventilated space. Odds getting sick pilot flight attendant nearly 0. 0 mask on.

Hours near passengers. Non zero risk.

I’d rather unvaccinated staff vaccinated passengers choice.

Good move regardless, let’s realistic. It’s one needed. long, funeral homes also feeling strain. Watch Ask Mortician YouTube. episode strain morgues/mortuaries/funeral homes LA there’s nowhere keep bodies grandma upvoted answer Also immunocompromised, fully vaccinated without detectable antibodies. lung issues though. sounds terrible. :( Wearing cotton mask really much protect wearer. Yeah better nothing people waaaaay overestimate safe mask makes them. wouldnt feel comfortable situation unmasked, amount protection mask gives shouldnt materially change comfortable feel. work best source control everyone wearing. terrified needles. first shot wife held hand. second shot, told guy scared wasn’t rude, going put headphones watch video phone, going ignore him. tap back get leave. dumb was, least didn’t try get bailed doctors last minute. 

He died stupidly needlessly, think didn’t burden system views. 

You can’t say anti vax morons. Thank you. They’re human beings. personally know people firmly, deeply believe vaccine bad *because doctor told so*. wife’s grandpa didn’t get doctor told likely die vaccine virus, he’s trusting doctor decades. 

Yes, anti-vaccine garbage horrible decimating country. I’m going laugh mock guy’s death. People spread misinformation, even unknowingly, something awful. I’m angry scumbags sit position trusted authority use lie make quick buck. get infected transmit virus. Vaccines reduce infections study Singapore shows even infected virus systems nearly long unvaccinated Yeah, channel's totally ours, French company actually owns tunnel atm. You’re wrong feel bad. Interesting I've seen lot stuff past months.. *Jabs Joints*, Free movie tix, Lotteries... etc. 
I heard much lately think prevailing winds shifted ""Now stupid, get shot can't partake X, Y, Z etc."" point threat constant lockdowns scary? US Delta mess unvaccinated, people still traveling, weddings, big gatherings, etc. I’m assuming one plan events Australia right given could lockdown time small amount cases?

Obviously huge advantages- far less illness death overall. That’s awesome. wonder DeSantis going send eldest child school year instead keeping safe home children. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

""“As population gets vaccinated, see higher relative percentage vaccinated people hospital,” PHE said.""

with majority vaccinated population, numbers similar hospitalizations flu season. fearmongering headline usual.  never knew college students getting repeatedly spanked adults. “As population gets vaccinated, see higher relative percentage vaccinated people hospital,” PHE said.” 

This headlines annoying, completely ignore statistics fear mongering. There's gaslighting. people seem incapable understanding we're even two years global pandemic new virus things rapidly changing. there's much time (sometimes). medics knew would call EMS ""earn money sleeping"" willing take low hourly rate pick extra 24 hour shifts top 2 3 already worked. Still ends taking away home 48-72 hours week least got time half 40 hours definitely great news deaths down. definitely means vaccines working. thing I'd say death bad part getting covid. still bad sickness long term symptoms many survivors. personally agree another lockdown, ignore rise positive cases. Everyone little cautious. much red tape, know people vaccinated - legit health reasons antivaxxer? parents vaccinated kids/teens aren't? teens gotten vaccine, parents haven't? FWIW, vast majority posts negative test results. I’m ready jump soon 12 vaccine ready. people know lucky available children right now!? could easily avoided. Liar id problalay wait guidance 3rd shot take ""2nd"" pfizer shot 3rd one spaced timeframe give 3rd shot  [Make mind. I'm dealing absolutely infuriating. said “anything 99.999% bad statistics”. completely false statement. course may (and are) specific claims allege wrong. don’t know anything accuracy covid tests I’ve made specific claims anything here. dismissal statistics completely wrong showed underlying misunderstanding field works. bet alcohol consumption something Americans Europeans think we’re joke?

Personally think ýour government bit joke yes. really shows Australia long-term plan low vaccination rates could've easily avoided. 
Zero Covid seem possible long-term constantly relying population follow lockdown rules eternity. people give shit little if, maybe force people facilities something doubt anyone would accept that. 

The current outbreak Sydney also showing lockdowns really always work. toughest lockdown democracies worldwide (maybe except states Australia, correct im wrong), cases still rising. point conclude working? 
Also lockdowns really natural immunity, something also hurting now. Older generations general like change. Scoff thought changing jobs every two three years pay becomes stagnant. reading nursing sub last night seems like already happening. Nurses saying people hospitals extra sick waited first wave go hospital would normally sought care earlier. 

I read one post nurse described treating people waiting room, they'd waiting hours dying. 

I read another post nurse said stroke victims getting treated dying waiting room.

I remember nurse losing temper man who, tired waiting, asked, ""do dying get seen?"" basically said yes. 

These Florida, Georgia, Texas recall. Also read Alabama Louisiana bad details those.  Plame Evolution. tomorrow everyone earth vaxed still would new mutations appearing. WANT TO! send every available dose overseas let anti vaxxers fend themselves? isn’t possible UK? Requiring specific vaccines towork uncommon US, especially healthcare, childcare, veterinary jobs. qualms people facing consequences actions comes public health. concerns life incarceration forced labour due minor drug infractions.  Florida best place world? allowed enforce vaccine passports masks Wow. well truly fucked. Oh fun I'm state, same.

The increase cases started around month ago, hospitalizations still pretty darn low: better look things month, especially deaths. It’s War Worlds. help ya, help ya, help ya? use phrase ""avoid like plague"" anymore many people seem Team Plague.  Oh Jesus. well! unfortunate. Story doesn’t mention lads vaccinated. accurately, able enter country want go without fully vaccinated. many people hospitalized severe disease? LoL anyone lab supposed know care do? know every job world is? Talk self centered

That said, people know lab workers do. meet handful reason think everyone quit, along exhausted, traumatized nurses. think I’m going avoid sub while. I’m worried stressed next semester school look like. can’t stop fixating fact unique time I’ll literally never able make for. sub making much worst. It’s driving nuts I’m starting get completely burnt stress. 

I vaccinated. location highly vaccinated. world ending. I’m going try stay away place. three years kids eligible vaccine /s 


I lost hope young kids ever get vaccine Thanks, hate it. let die quietly. TL;DR:

1. unvaccinated w/o natural immunity - 90%+ cases; 8x infection risk, 25x hospitalization, 24x death (Based state reported data CDC estimates). 
2. Vaccinated symptoms - 5%, tend milder
3. vaccinated asymptomatic - detected routine testing ??? - consensus lower ability spread (based lower spread unvaccinated asymptomatic) need start allowing green pass QR code given people countries. one knows rules. sure feel one hand, pushes people get vaccinated that'd good, hand gives already terrible corrupt system power exploit people. N95 KN95 respirators give good protection wearer others. cost little $0.20 bulk. come designer colors prints. I'll agree with. Immunocompromised patients going harder time fighting course going give virus chance mutate due longer resident time. faster body fight off, less chance mutation since less time everyone would try real conversations, might help division regarding Covid.

But part disagree with. seen interacted you, resort name calling shaming anything like generally people start making ridiculous claims. someone misunderstanding something I'd rather take time help understand try shame submission.

But people can't reach. matter nice are, much try show them, refuse listen. understand frustration people feel dealing that. Heck one people father. flat thinks vaccine poison even though I've gotten two doses Moderna, fiance gotten two doses Pfizer well. even went hot zone Mississippi work reasons came back fine. also masked addition vaccine specifically outbreak area. There's always going non-zero risk catching it, vaccines minimize risk well helping get faster less complications.

What really recommend seeing doctor it. They'll able recommend best vaccine they'll know pre-existing conditions what's greater lesser risk side effect that's dangerous. Like case, J&amp;J verbotten already clotting issues, doctor recommended Moderna Pfizer took one gave office house. also bit safer way already know health quickly see something wrong clinic may. saying clinic unsafe, someone knows better obviously better source. Actually do. moment money developments flows every direction. read article read articles source. somehow legitimate way many articles bending truth. think future may develop reliable medication moment vaccines medications actually deliver reliable results scientific standpoint. course may change future. remember hydroxychloroquine fiasco? medication came along lot health problems increasing amount damage unacceptable high level. Overall think ""one solution"" problem. Still moment vaccinations, tests masks best have. asking countries extra doses give countries without. raises interesting question - effective stopping Delta? Israel started giving boosters elderly population recently, hypothetical. part-time gig grocery store wore N95 two 5 hour shifts week stocking produce October 2020 March 2021, mostly still relatively frequent interactions elderly parents didn’t want bring covid them.

It excessively miserable. public-facing job work tight quarters others know don’t take seriously, think N95 good, reasonable idea balanced misery. expect general public wear running errands shopping, etc indeed laughable. may luck time - much detail yet paragraph caught eye: countries United States … many countries EU, allow Singapore-based travellers go countries without quarantine (stay-home notice). reciprocate arrangement, also open travel countries achieved high level vaccination ""reduced rates significantly""

Assuming Delta peaks soon enough US fear fuels hesistant take vaccines, hopefully US get good enough shape nationwide level blanket border controls lifted. Thanks!! Anything crazy going on? Like original virus complete loss taste smell insane. experiencing anything similar? Former overweight American here, agree. Cytotoxic… covid virus!

You know else cytotoxic? Water, air, salt(sodium chloride), etc etc. 

Context matters.  free state union. Salute. Florida's policy extremely irresponsible. Cases hospitalizations roof. silver lining deaths still relatively low. expect stay way, deaths climb previous waves? heard pretty good.  It’s… get ready it…

THE SLIPPERY SLOPE FALLACY

Guess what, it’s coming next, it’s *already here* Definitely immoral. It’s better reflection US allowing business protect employees customers reasonable protection global pandemic. argument extreme idea ‘what comes next’ fear mongering. know happens people don’t get vaccinated. Smallpox, polio, etc. none would eradicated without vaccines. fully vaccinated improves chances dying virus 130x. 

That's pretty impressive. Sort actually shortage teachers. Lots people get teaching certificates, teach years (or less) decide worth it... almost entirely working conditions, pay, treated. agree anti vaxxers primarily got us mess think might misunderstanding me. talking two things here:

1. mask mandates negative effect businesses
2. people say mask mandates ""zero cost"" affect business all

I agree mask mandates hospitals overwhelmed. health system important bar people need stop pretending mask mandates zero cost saying. used lightly. Local governments can't control federal government give aide failing businesses allow shut down, control mask mandates. wish people would get vaccinated end agree that, places highest vaccination rates ones primarily implementing mandates. country mask mandate ones need never will. Fake science immune system. Nonsense. advice, decide get shot GO RIGHT AWAY. 

This. response bad people here, definitely want jab. spur moment decided get pharmacy saw advertising administering day. J&amp;J Moderna, wanted moderna. moderna frozen want wait two hours it, knew get J&amp;J right get it. Told pharmacist concerned pulled explained issues reinstated, desire get shot right weighted worrying J&amp;J shot. got it. 

I'm glad did, know I'd found reasons keep getting talked then. likely same. putting everyone mother hospital pre vaccine era. agree. give us truth plain English. "
