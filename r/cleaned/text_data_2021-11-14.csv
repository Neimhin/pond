0,2021-11-14," Despite popular belief, USA behind many many countries world many many ways. Even country question Bolsonaro charge, countries tend still actually function, unlike USA.

# surprising least country publicly funded healthcare outperforming USA public health obstacle. totally agree people get vaccinated protect people. sound like sooner get vaccinated, better protecting people around me. simple. Even thinking others' welfare own, makes sense delay vaccination. Here's why.

 state CDC currently pacing lowest prevalence category. 3 levels ""minimal,"" state lowest 3 levels. means very, very, cases flu area. chance catching flu right now, &amp; thus posing risk people, therefore also very, very, low. get vaccinated make 50% less likely catch flu, chance catching flu go tiny extra-tiny. Meanwhile, time passes, immunity decline 10% month. flu peaks around in, say, January, level protection around 10%. means time there's real risk catching flu passing on, almost vulnerable flu unvaccinated person. there's lot flu around, chance catching becoming contagious pretty high, even old, worn-out vaccination board.  

Which better: 50% protected catching passing flu there's almost flu around, 10% protected there's lot around? flu 2018 weak opening door doctor‚Äôs office difficult. wasn‚Äôt fun. Yes also fact, fuck costs masks. course people dumb hence spiraling deaths restrictions due control spread again. looked around non national chain pharmacies? Pfizer x2 Walgreens spring got Moderna booster Friday local grocery store that‚Äôs kind regional name. borders open tourists thinks?   far they've strayed anti fluoride protests. achieve anything protests? ""Healthcare professionals"" US build lives top system bankrupts people takes advantage desperate jacking prices outer stratosphere.

You really think system going give bonus? caught flu Hong Kong, long covid bed hotel room week straight bed home another three weeks.

hey thanks bringing back you! Iran, India, Indonesia tons working-age Covid deaths, though. That‚Äôs ultimately, selfish either sides determine they‚Äôre limited Pros cons exist, people weighed stuck believe best them. restrict them?

By logic, people allowed drive drunk, drinking driving choice, drunk driver thinks best them, restrict them? knew would happen. Obesity personal institutional failure. many people participate failing institution able make choices sacrifices necessary maintain healthy weight.    new card immunization record card fits passport. Maybe CDC card also intended fit passport? line ""by educating people scientific reasoning"" laughing. clearly paying attention. people believe u/letsGoBrandonQAnon1 ever listen doctor. trump doctor  That‚Äôs opinion. still look far worse world? Northern Europe seeing surges bringing line UK months months.

And yet we‚Äôre enjoying life zero restrictions. I‚Äôm certainly complaining. Source? One causes all.  happens Singapore. government gave front line workers massive bonus.  surpassed highest infection rates pandemic quite bit. measures slow (according experts). yeah, coming Austria next weeks sounds like bad idea. Right heading another lockdown everybody. Based Austria seems like British government willing tolerate high case numbers long period time, whereas governments many European countries start shitting bed soon cases start going again. Doctor - Here's something keep alive, turn 100% chance dying

Idiot - choose die

ü§¶  new thing restrictions unvaccinated people, country need vaccines updated get access schools social security example    said would first line take doctors told should. Based context, clear saying take *only* Donald Trump says take it. Completely reasonable, since Donald Trump consistently proved completely ignorant health issues. Got college. Lost 20 lbs month. spent weeks sleeping chance got. Horrible, horrible illness. Cry childhood city 91% 12 1 shot 84% last week 5 1 shot.

I know 6 year old 7 11 year old cousin's shots weekend bump number higher.

Their school district already hosted vaccine day well. Every time mom gets hint fever, claims coming flu. takes handful vitamin c 6 hour nap. wakes ""miraculously cured,"" therefore ""doesn't need stupid flu shots."" Drives nuts trying explain handful vitamin C cure flu never first place. think lot MILLION people confirmed dead covid, likely millions go expected deaths vs actual deaths, lockdowns massive public safety measures. 

You think overblown personally affected. buying propaganda think covid measures fucking power grab trick ""to progress science"", whatever fuck that's supposed mean... government telling since inception. already mandated get vaccines, go speed limit, steal kill. 

Thinking THIS, free vaccine limits unvaccinated people spreading disease, flexing power absolutely moronic Unfortunate obvious would happen. yet UK experienced bigger surge cases, didn‚Äôt introduce restrictions all, cases started falling anyway.

Your government simply shit bed. Manitoba Yeah know law enforcement arbiters justice. simply individuals following orders (thank using straw-man argument). 

Now don‚Äôt get wrong, everything mentioned previously another redditor merit, however problem argument regarding cops getting vaccinated law law particular gonna unintended consequences, it‚Äôs good one. Why? Well let ask questions: know long takes train competent cops? know long takes recruit new officers work particular station? Ooo here‚Äôs one million dollar question: cops fired complying mandate long think it‚Äôs gonna take LAPD start fully staffing competent cops one vaccinated, two willing deal incredibly shitty people throughout scope employment? find answers following questions, ask this: long think gonna take LA county realize shot foot legislating silly mandate gonna eventually lead high crime rates? Californian lives LA county myself, deeply concerning me. Yes important get many people vaccinated possible personally think it‚Äôs bad idea tell people bodies mandate. gonna make people become reluctant get vaccine make people starting questioning authority figure(s)‚Äô motives issuing mandate first place. 

Also another flaw found argument hearing lot sources (word mouth, news stations(yahoo new, msnbc, etc.) reports people fabricating fake vaccine cards get around vaccine mandate. Im kind curious aware piece information. 

P.S. call stating like following orders gave impression must type would follow law, matter silly unconscionable right minded person. Californian fully vaccinated moderna, don‚Äôt like mandate cause potentially lead high crime rates throughout LA county, law enforcement unable quell chaos dumb vaccine mandate telling cannot work, dine out, go public places unless vaccinated. It‚Äôs sounds incredibly classist discriminatory toward people unvaccinated and/or towards people choose get vaccine whatever reason may be.

What thoughts this? :) Zero covid work even try contain covid every beginning passed point return early. got booster last week! Pfizer third shot bad second shot.

Second shot took 5 days fully recover. Muscle aches fatigue. third day, felt like flu 4-5 hours.

Third shot felt fatigued 3 days felt like cold second third days. made week maybe month 

This excellent plan universal imo

Ty posting [State CA Digit Covid-19 merely illusion Tedcruz multiple beings whose social media mind gone rogue.  true cases flu mild. much overlap colds symptomatically. nose stuffed temp bit sore throat want sit computer watch stupid videos, probably cold. shivering blanket high fever, everything hurts, mustering walk bathroom, that's flu. Highly capable disease detection, China, (didn't detect case SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence 9 states US 1.1%; delayed PCR testing due first testing kits botched CDC)

Highly susceptible population (high percentage anti maskers, anti vaccxxers, extremly high total cases.) Even fully vaxed get tested watching movie going late night restaurant club.

Only Vienna.  Yes, reddit likes use logic someone gets stopped speeding tells police arresting murderers. Point someone else bad (or even they're worse) absolve harmful actions. know sadly doesn‚Äôt way 

It‚Äôs purely self inflicted wound lack better term Getting vaccinated reduces spread area.  question asked article. get worse next years.  Anything vaccinated Hetero women? Sorry loss. That's absolutely fair, sharing one perspective pro-vaxxer. assume get flu shot similar reasons... matter awareness visibility think, convince others get it. got one last year happened waiting 15min CVS get prescription filled. Yep. delays restricting unvaccinated mean restrictions vaccinated line. Hardly ethical vaccine mandates. I've got friend recently booked trip Austria wife around Christmas. good time traveling there?  mean, pharmacy give third full dose instead booster, believe incompetent. also fill card, thankfully online database state.  Something go court without clear precedence exact situation, that's contradiction. one said zero chance getting Biden ""admitted"" knew that. fucking weasely. I've mild flu multiple times (mainly started getting flu shots) relatively bad flu once, young healthy. distinct memory body freezing whilst drenched sweat bed, begging die also argument imaginary man room (shouting real f\*\*\* off). terrible day so, took well week really get back normal that. No. keeps repeated last time actual Austrian said article wrong get entry fee waved. still need pay ladies. YES! Ohmgd, never thought that! *Brilliant!* weird thisnis getting hyped FALA DE NOIS COMEDIA give mild symptoms, yeah basically ignorance. ‚ÄúWith 65% total population vaccinated, Austria one lowest vaccination rates Western Europe.‚Äù

Worth noting US currently 59% fully vaccinated Olympics July, Japan's vaccination rate like less 20% US crawling barely 50%. around August, vaccination drive exploded, surpassed US September bunch European countries never looked back. 75% fully vaccinated now. They're gonna catch Canada surpassed soon.  think good point make, would come say doctors tell us take it, I'll first line take it.

Seems perfectly reasonable me. Israel data pfizer 10x reduction positive tests, 20x reduction hospitalizations. numbers actually better younger people, except hospitalizations low measure phase 2s measuring antibody numbers Generally wrong. covid anti vaxxers, that's much part ""I research"" verbiage, discredit real science. unintentional treading area, people see statements way. tremendous level dehydration (and therefore extreme headache) right first dose. second third one loaded electrolytes right away. feel always thirsty pick pedialyte similar. Fortinately BS sort accepted many places employent especially vast majority health care. that's flu story! ask, corny sense humor fit right looking like Westley? yeah, make sense me. people either gotten covid, know people covid fine, also know people gotten vaccine gotten myocarditis after. dad example, everyone household vaccinated, except him, help one us may gotten myocarditis it. federalist nation. states ton power throw massive roadblocks. top that, states, like own, municipalities level power relative states. mean we've already guy refuse rabies vaccine exposed bat. That's bad enough is. Good. Want lockdown? bare minimum decent part society. rage inducing, particularly if/when person dies, lumped ""fully vaccinated"" category unless fraud detected. place, 42%, 200%, 1000%. Mixing 1 week several weeks.  


Somehow get 42%, without taking account factors. make calculations, based 42%, draw conclusion that. Misinformation? ****? would listen head Pfizer former head FDA, trust sources?! remember said recently) ""The pandemic January,"" ? Cite better source I'll take that. moderna [phase trials run 6-8 months second dose. complete pfizer trials &amp; real-world data, includes [third doses right 6 (showing 10-fold decrease positive tests versus 2-dose cohort) ~[11 (showing 20-fold decrease symptomatic covid).

We know moderna creates initial antibodies, takes longer wear off, timeline ""needing"" third dose slightly back versus pfizer. [3-6 months protection severe highest, likely waiting lot longer going help much.

Most likely everyone countries pandemic get third dose 6 months. lot done state level. use Docket App NJ, Utah started it. Colorado database well. similar rules made Singapore, unvaccinated allowed enter malls, eat restaurants go tourist attractions. telegram anti-vaxxers happy, dare start revolution smth like that. (We also app show status) first thought 'Oh come on! flu shot now?' actually makes perfect sense. convince science medicine real got hard back track reality. husband says thing... fools think flu big deal either never mild case. 

I'm sure I've ever not.... I've pretty ugly viruses though. I'm asthmatic make sure get flu shot started getting pneumonia shot 30s Andrew Wakefield, disgraced ex-doctor tried connect MMR vaccine autism sell fake alternative (and also tortured children, btw) guest honour Trump rallies 2016. Trump claimed connection vaccines autism least remember.

So, vaccine safety non-issue already political/partisan.

I like word ""polarization"" current political conflict, implies two less morally equivalent sides. true.

When one side lie, invests specifically rejection critical thinking objective reality, baddies. necessarily make guys good, better.

Distrust institutions inherently bad, healthy valid reasons. distrusting reasons based reality that's problem. This, again, neatly divided two across political lines. i'm actually surprised numbers high

wonder they're like live. given free, I've never yet considered getting one, I've never flu symptoms hate timeline live in, really  double vax rates low Germany compared UK Spain? supply issues attitudes? Germany use AZ vaccine? briefly used Canada seems canned. Canada high double vax rates.  They‚Äôre still though. entire world, even ones believe science, suffer it. Historically communist countries Europe seem low vaccination rates.

I assume anyone grew place like would learn authority figures can't trusted.

In East Germany, may added complication: country, injected athletes experimental drugs order improve performance. Many suffered severe permanent side-effects. Obviously, doctors would complicit this. would presumably huge effect extent people trust relatively new vaccine. good way get people shots? PSA: Given estimates 22 million kids missed MMR vaccine shots pandemic:

* gotten MMR (mumps, measles, rubella), please so; would gotten shot prior 1989 (or, like me, mumps rubella vaccinations, *not* measles), consult healthcare advisor getting one.
* TDAP (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis). Tetanus cause muscle cramping severe *break bones*. [Most people need booster every 10 Flu shots save lives. - looked it. looks like vaccines stop getting it. 

They make less make u less likely pass on? 

That too.

Also, overwhelmed ICUs anti-vaxxers threat everyone needing ICU bed. means people die due fucking idiots. currently biggest problem German speaking countries due incoming winter wave. hubbub now?

Traveling necessity. Even working specific company necessity. nonessential places want deny unvaccinateds that's one thing. think crosses line someone denied entry grocery store buy food unless inject themself something. understand mask sufficient cases, especially protection vaccine. I'm incredibly sorry friend went through. :( six month wait booster arbitrary current circumstances, idiotic. still effect everywhere?  secret organization known bacterium can't afford it, round trip ticket America like six months full time job pay me. Plus third world countries citizens cannot fly somewhere want, visa exemption like rich countries people need apply visa months advance, costs alot money too. vaccine people economicly weak neighborhoods foreign speaking ones.

I think important. know comment downvoted. experience, German authorities vastly underestimate bureaucratic difficulties many non-EU foreigners others living places like Neuk√∂lln. traditional vaccine campaign reach somebody health insurance angemeldet living. think us since 90s they've way vocal last year ideology colliding reality (and really happen often) really really stressing people out. 99% countries allow patients refuse life saving treatment Resuscitate orders? find hard believe. one ever mandated flu shots vaccination certs phones easy spoof? Singapore, anti-vaxxers would try gaining access showing screenshots people's vaccine certs passing own, app makers modify status screen prevent sort thing. stated press conference government. try dig something out. Well, choose term then: competed it? can't actually find anything chance getting rabies bitten rabid animal, impression almost certain.

Everything could find chance animal even rabid first place odds case.

Also vaccine works clear would vaccinated time.

If know anything specific subject googlefu better I'd love know there's also chance catch bitten it.   vaccination rates East lower? something historically part East Germany? vaccine requirement venues ‚Äúhygiene theatre.‚Äù 

It significantly reduces odds catch Covid one events.

At last check Colorado 145.6 cases per 100k vaccinated week 10/24, vs **559.6 cases per 100k unvaccinated population.**

It also encourages vaccinations hesitant. 

A mask requirement restaurants sit take mask ‚Äúhygiene theater.‚Äù

Vaccine requirements make sense. mindful takes ~2 weeks fully effective Hey, want say I've upvoted posts here, really appreciate good writing is, well articulated viewpoints.

 disagree everything saying, narrow-minded short-sighted selfish way thinking, appreciate cogently stated everything.

But seriously, realize contradictory thoughts like ""everyone deserves safe society"" ""people high risk covid deserve go everywhere without restrictions"" are? Me, too! need encourage family same.  Well expect least number customers rise again! know million people die car accidents every year, right? surely advocating banning cars.

No, proper safety enforced, safety belts, following rules road, speeding, etc. complicated. Yeah things looking good winter 21-22. :( right. true. pandemic *real* (for people) happens *you*, good friend, family member. 

Since ""it's happened"" around often, take seriously. That's got booster shot flu shot, spent weekend bed. 

In day return work, test hundreds happy seniors go cruises visit relatives Thanksgiving. 

I discussion mother we'd see other. calculated next Spring, goes well. Honestly, I'm afraid her. think good shape (at least, Florida) guestimates. We'll see. That‚Äôs great. 

It seems parents last feel ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù bc kids couldn‚Äôt get vaccinated.

I hope lot parents feeling relief right now. county Southern California college students working hospitals really bad fall-winter surge last year. :( Honestly, could good thing. flu shot already tragically used Democrats see duty 49% population getting flu shot might actually improvement past years.  Aw. live within walking distance testing centers, requirement negative test would limit life lot. :( Thankfully I'm Vienna. terrifying, frustrating, infuriating exhausting turns American right now. wonder teens anxious. Literally everything say correct! That's specifically bothersome. statement line people normally would get flu shot, getting playing political COVID antivax game.  Luv 2 navigate different doctors use followmyhealth mychart make sure QR codes apps He's busy thinking fake adverts making fun real. absolutely support Republicans abstaining getting life-saving vaccinations. choice, respect decision die misery leave rest us peace.   hard educate covid19 vaccine? internet, social media news paper, television. point anyone still wanna play dumb covid19 vaccine purposely choose ignoring facts. 

You know unvavcinated could carry virus spread around everyone including people could get vaccinated due health problem, freedom choice live?

If someone act extremely selfish want harm society, think fair society repay them. Vaccine absolutely personal choice, unless decide meet person life. print‚Ä¶. TV. Mainstream media loves scapegoat internet media problems crystallizations traditional media. Traditional media making bank rage decades Facebook came along. difference Facebook doesn‚Äôt actually produce content, way they‚Äôre simply middlemen. root cause problem actual, non-social media creates poopy content first place. Portugal 10 million people, though; inhabitants constitute minor part portuguese-speaking world. portuguese-speaking people net come Brazil, there's lot africans also speak language natively. Brazil's general appreciation vaccines comes culture, Portugal's.  Stalin said, 1 death tragedy, 1 million statistic. compassion abstract number. truth. could lie make people feel better, case, think better blunt. 

That make bad person, makes human being. phenomenon called psychic numbing. lockdowns restrictions, we're pushing limits people capable psychologically handling. least past times, people could turn friends families support comfort, responses pandemic precluded too. 

Most normal people going compassion large abstract number. truth. Maybe morally superior people, salute that. I'm though.  gotta kidding me!

Seriously, flu?!


When anti+intellectualism end? ok hand gesture, someone lost job racist symbol   Well damn, goes theory virus hiding nerve bundles. *not* neurotropic. *where* hiding long COVID patients?! NYS   would thought difference vaccine efficacy preventing symptomatic asymptomatic spread among previous iterations COVID, delta, enough make clear. Breakthrough infections delta exponentially common original COVID. feel like basically vaccine mandate except starts consequences non compliance first. Vaccine mandates proven difficult enforce places maybe something many countries either lying covid cases (like Tanzania), don‚Äôt test enough people. Tanzania reported thousand cases far, despite massive population.

And countries like Ethiopia Nigeria reported hundred thousand, consistently 10-20% positivity rate, meaning cases likely lot higher.  I‚Äôve never taken it. never get flu one time actually got flu shot, ended getting really sick. saying it‚Äôs pointless, immune system hasn‚Äôt let far. That, terrible needle phobia. pass every time get shot, avoid possible. Yet another reason get vaccinated wear mask...for four footed family members. Thanks non-patronizing response. agree‚Äîthat sounds like we‚Äôre headed. don‚Äôt hear much covid Africa. bad there? Don‚Äôt hear stories like Italy last year India etc.  low vaccination rates imagine it‚Äôs pretty bad  Imagine picking evangelical, molesting, lying grifters medicine, science &amp; history. I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt understand polling works Well, whatever good them. good authority. really worry means next generations. babies old enough get vaccines, protected herd immunity vaccinated even getting boostershot next month. Someone functional healthy brain understand normal.  Pharmacists nurses. wheelhouse. Pharmacies labs either charge testing. ideal.  Also, diabetics supposed they‚Äôve maxed four insulin injections? Yeah ok. population isn‚Äôt even polled. It‚Äôs select groups. even say that‚Äôs accurate? last sentence basically magical thinking.  Everyone understanding this, I'm sure. Really? Smokers already singled pay insurance.

Let's unvaccinated. Er, guess write two polling firms involved research quoted article let know personal anecdote data? Japan actually one worst vaccinated OECD country world.

[Japan 9th 38 OECD countries percentage population fully Japan Portugal, Chile, Iceland, Spain, South Korea, Denmark, Ireland Canada.

Behind Japan Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Finland, Australia, Norway, Sweden, France, United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Switzerland, Austria, Greece, Israel, Hungary, Latvia, Estonia, Turkey, Czech Republic, United States, Costa Rica, Slovenia, Poland, Mexico, Colombia Slovakia. Stupid could vaccinated year ago longer antibodies course people get vaccinated get boosters soon can. Humanity's stupidity remains boundless.  ‚ÄúCOVID shot controversy‚Äù say ‚ÄúVaccine misinformation spread primarily republicans‚Äù Well fair, people actually catch flu usually sick care *what* have.  six months based best evidence vaccination committee point. more, good data comes change. Yes effect people immunocompromised. evidence claim arbitrary? vaccination sites struggle deliver vaccinations due lobbyism many closed. Even could follow current surge demand wouldnt help current wave would effect next year according Drosten, Wieler etc. Okay, get doctors note. People set appointments get vaccine, don‚Äôt get doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt need documentation like rest us.  mild serious cases flu (diagnosed medical professional).

The mild one debilitating could walking around. serious case was... devastating. thought would stop breathing care.

I've also colds - used lot colds. worst cold mildest flu same... unnecessary. problem effectiveness diminished time, delta. booster good delta tailored vaccine. vaccination like hepA+B need 3 injections time span recommended covid -- weird though 3rd called ""booster"" instead ""part base immunization"" (though ""immunity"" ""train body long term) -- also, accepted flu, get yearly vaccinations strains mutating last year's. would people accept SARS-CoV-2 necessary?

People double standards afraid new shit.    Yes, hardest lockdown government **legally allowed** place population -- 

* cannot forbid going **single person recreation** (going walk - means, big groups going walk together), essential physical mental health constitutional right good health
* cannot restrict social contacts (but limit least **weekly contact lockdown**, visit single person household), human contact essential mental health constitutional right good health
* cannot restrict **most essential** tasks like going work WFH option, grocery shopping, getting medication **critical** administrative procedures (like renewing visas renewing passport expires soon time critical applications requests), essential **survival** keeping life order.

No, saying ""but need party mental health"" valid reason party. ;) 

The first lockdown like Spring 2020 like people really kept it. Streets empty, public transport EMPTY (cannot legally closed luckily, seeing public service), grocery stores overcrowded, parks like places see people, especially kids.

I honestly prefer one EVERYONE 3-4 weeks really kick 4th wave butt half measures time. vaccinated would everyone's best interest, even own. infection one some. Reinfection thing, particularly unvaccinated, every infection chance become long-hauler.

An endemic, live it, ‚Äúexit‚Äù exit, endless suffering.  need Delta specific mRNA vaccine. Pasting another thread:

The way variant effectively make vaccines effective mutating spike proteins. Coronsviruses proofread mechanism mutate spike proteins stay relatively otherwise able bind receptors easily make us sick. 

Variants become contagious, reasons efficacy went tiny bit Delta due us exposed higher viral load thus upping chances slipping cracks significant enough huge impact double vaxxed. 

We need delta specific vaccine, current ones designed extremely well. mutations pose risk making vaccines obsolete, especially third shots coming next year extend sterilizing immunity antibodies would normally wane transition B-Cells.  Ah, far 'brain dead', know... brain tumour all.
Honestly, internet stranger. mean harm bringing conversation, passionate, respect that. also must respect people passionate believes course information surrounding COVID, seems like huge battle morally correct!

For one, 3 major hospitals within UK, including cancer ward. Funnily enough diagnosed pandemic hit. treatment delays, oncologist team available within 48 hours needs be.

I well-being specialist assigned COVID wards major downside. two family members also battling terminal cancers seen reduction care. Maybe lucky, tend look beyond circle cause stress anxiety.

I done part got vaccinated, even someone like position in, forgive select opt away vaccines,

To me, shows fragility care systems susceptible are. grand scheme things, COVID high mortality pathogen, require ICU care lot cases, unwise that.

But, standing anger better directed charge. let reach level incompetence surrounding flow money fund hospitals care drastically immoral. COVID eventually becomes another seasonable respiratory infection, likely will. probably see cost cutting health care systems, learned short cuts ways around treatments.

There conspiracy, would suggest hidden. They're plain sight.

And, meet maker. stand sentiment humans change precipice. Sorry, keywords? read entire paper. someone previously infected covid better immunity then? focus build prepare infrastructure future challenges. COVID shown, massively fragile healthcare systems are.

Unless somehow one ICU bed available every citizen constantly, always limitations health care system. 

Hindsight always 20/20. easy say need ICU beds. last large pandemic Europe 100 years ago. many people would thought ten years ago good idea spent lots money resources significantly ICU beds available usually needed? might large pandemic decades without one? still struggle convincing people really something limit climate change. something affect us sure future something might affect us future.  understand mRNA vaccine delta variant already out. whole point technology change sequence used whatever want (in case delta variant) plug existing technology? far lowest Western Europe. It‚Äôs shamefully low sure. respect people made choice get vaccinated

You really shouldn't. dumb bad choice. Italy, apparently people paying getting scammed

There news people paying Bitcoin scammer fake certificate (which didn‚Äôt get) paying names disclosed authorities.    Even ignore ""health risk others"" aspect. many countries (I believe also Austria) wearing seat belts car mandatory. mainly protect users still mandated. measures protect someone certain self chosen risks unheard unusual law.  90%? Damn, that's good. Good you, hope rest country catches point. cons exist, people weighed stuck believe best them. restrict them?

One con voluntary vaccinated part comparatively high risk group. might end targeted measures meant limit spread high risk group.  could random check points entering shopping centre similar non-essential service centres. someone said before, punished unless legitimate policing it. ireland. Apparently, also black market covid certs. People paying couple hundred quid fake ones. personally problem unvaccinated people getting pushed back line, still ethical dilemma. whole point medicine treat you, matter what. Doctors differentiate burden decide gets treatment. kidnapper getting shot, dumb teenager recklessly injuring someone vaccinated (which mean corona, also things: forget renew tetanus shot contract tetanus?). 

Of course, situation different scale problem, imo anyone saying simple decision making easy. could add examples vaccinated 70 year old needs put vent met 10 friends without mask? know behavior hard prove compared vaccination status, person definitely less ""deserving"" treatment someone vaccinated wearing mask distanced themself others. 

You go (vaccinated, ignoring masks vs unvaccinated, observing social distancing masks), treating unvaccinated last magical fair solution - maybe fair, depends point view. 

In case, medicine kind decision avoided costs, plus unfair force doctors make calls like this. think mandatory vaccinations start prioritizing vaccinated unvaccinated. Maybe ready die? MIL chronically sick, hospital, starting resist everone's efforts keep going.  depressed tired struggling.   post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Vaccination mandatory. either make mandatory stop thinking mandatory. made choice get vaccinated respect people made choice get vaccinated. too. human so. given fact health care gets overwhelmed hardly anybody really wants deal fallout (e.g. people dying various treatable conditions injuries simply resources available actually treat them) government say someone ""you must else"".

In words nothing really option. comes deciding target necessary measures. Limiting group people comparatively high risk choice sounds like good idea. Although fear might late enough point. families expressed fear loved one dying COVID-19 hospital used part global experiment.

The funny thing that, we're basically already part global experiment. Researchers already tracking spread effects virus biological, financial e.t.c. fields. Whether deliberate not, people ask themselves, want spread virus put others danger?  US Europe though  point, doubt pandemic ended vaccinations and/or infection. reservoir unvaccinated Germany huge breakthrough infections thing.

Vaccinations super important, doubt stop pandemic. thing (maybe) safe ass medium long term better drugs. get them, future looks bleak older people. dont think complicated even there, assuming 20something doesnt medical condition prevents vaccination one person duty society didn't, put old guy ICU Whenever something fast (didn't exactly happen often. Immigration crises nuclear power plants come mind like said) thought repercussions longer. Whenever decided something sat out. Anti-Vaxxers plus stupid media effectively still second-guessing vaccines focussing reports breakthrough infections instead reporting prevented hospitalizations deaths. I've double jabbed I'm curious seen accusations B.M.J Pfizer?? BMJ joke agree different topic. However, previous comment unscientific. article fine, headline bad. call fake flu. Going moment combo covid booster. flu arm hurts covid arm, I've awake since 3am reason. lymph nodes around jugular veins quite upset.

Still better covid flu! Front line war death front line war COVID, front line war bullshit. That‚Äôs booster shots. True, significance implications widely understood  Well said!!! Yes. Austria certain regions Hospitals overflowing. Germany classified us ‚Äòhigh risk‚Äô meaning live near border like many people friends family germany it‚Äôs lot harder visit them. People (and like official data shows mainly unvaccinated people) dying spreading covid like wild-fire yet third country still doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated pretty much responsible whole mess. announced consequences restrictions mainly (but exclusively) unvaccinated, many decided get vaccinated places get vaccinated overflowing. won‚Äôt end close 90% population vaccinated, meaning reach 90% one way another.  Unfortunately, seems large population human race prefer let virus mutate, go coffee. help governments suck helping people issues COVID related (e.g. income), organisations exploit this, think forest got cut lack protesters. seem considering recovery virus somehow vastly superior vaccination, isn't. article complete nonsense?  wait... it'll ""verfassungswidrig"" we'll start forget rushed decision shutting AKWs coal plants increase output TIL Austria western Europe /s I'm afraid trend continue, winter 22-23 ill worse again. magnitude. Greece small country countless small towns villages people's mentality ""naahh.. we'll fine without stupid vaccine"" keep gathering without care world that's doing, well ,since forever.

The majority young / middle aged people vaccinated careful. Older generations stubbornly still unvaccinated .

I unvaccinated relatives ( age 70 ) shame hugging/ kissing . Stood ground told really care offended goes show much people touch reality. wonder happens next year, students drop like full-trained health workers.  Seems 2-3 month wave pattern. yes -- seems random actually related government restrictions (barring full lockdown).  said. There's many different people saying different things. government consists two partys can't different rules changing literally day day.

So well ... know expect change soon. try get family's third shot asap care rules follow. care need common mask, FFP2 mask mask. wear FFP2 wherever go.

But hey, everything's gonna good day :) politicians. work, I've hearing high management almost two years pandemic almost end months everything back ""normal"". almost like read happened 100 years ago translate times. Maybe contrarian appeals people, even go get vaccinated.  dispair question.

You need answer, happily assume American watches Fox main news channel. don‚Äôt think masks make much distance store. There‚Äôs enough spread matter. mix time intervals.

You mix different, compare different things. E.g. 76% 2-dose vaccination rate, better lot places, nowhere near Mumbai's 87% seropositivity point Delta pandemic ended there. 

Comparing vaccinated NL 87% seropositivity Mumbai. add NL got Covid already? Starting get level Mumbai. comparing different things. Mumbai sero test include adults 18? 76% vaccinated NL people. Adult vaccinated people NL higher. 87%? Also Mumbay NL. 


You mix 7 days averages single days averages. less throw random values, e.g. single day 20% positive test share.

You base 42% growth new cases, without taking account factors like testing. Number cases best indicator, e.g. depend number tests.  


You could looking hospitalizations, deaths, e.g. Yes, hospitalizations lagging cases week, since compare since beginning October use it? 


If used hospitalization would get less 42%. Last complete week November ***far*** less 42%. 


I deny cases beginning October. I'm saying calculation sketchy. base sketchy 42% draw conclusion analyze, e.g R, 8000 deaths, 70000 hospitalizations.

However, *effect* mutation, faster replication - particularly nose &amp; throat region antibody levels usually lower - causing higher incidence breakthrough infections, *not mutation escaping antibodies produced current mRNA vaccines.* Hence, Delta specific adjustment sure tolerated much treated rubbish reasonable adult would believe, be. 

But treating rubbish reasonable people would believe pattern emerges examining histories leading modern US societal movements. seems current vaccines effective delta. Delta spreads faster mostly higher viral load, nothing defeating vaccine.

Breakthrough cases increase reduced effectiveness time, solved booster, reformulating vaccine.

So understand think delta specific vaccine needed. directly change viral load infected people address waning effectiveness time.

Everyone vaccinated spend forever line likely want avoid flying, anyone still allowed fly. Came say this. Measles incredibly diabolical. I‚Äôd less exposed COVID, since breakthrough infections thing.  Kids get loads shots. right that. disqualify everything stated last cuff remark post. Let‚Äôs continue make list people boycotted them. already Big Bird Santa Claus. Let‚Äôs make list bigger. 3-4 shots anything good you. 

Your words, fuckface. flu respiratory illness. Exactly. people conflate head cold flu. understand difference got Swine Flu back 2009. bad. understand, soon know 3rd dose trick. right, date info making public less trusting. 

I'm denying vaccine saving lives, however impression madness would 60-80% people get vaccinated. want things go back normal. 

Thanks explaining. immunized child schedule dose following ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 months, 4 years, 11 years. boosters every 10 years. 

[CDC Childhood Immunization Schedule sure common area live, time someone gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea and/or vomiting) call ‚Äúthe stomach flu.‚Äù generally 24 48 hour passing virus sort. tell norovirus, still think flu. 

They not. 

They confident ignorance, can‚Äôt educate them, it‚Äôs surprise don‚Äôt think flu big deal. 

These people exhausting. I‚Äôm convinced antivaxxers read news. can‚Äôt boycott group people stupid, lazy undisciplined organize. thats pointless argument. Yep :/ angered show delivery lady looking large block flats showing can-do attitude... reality live floor 2 higher arrive looking like evil person daring order delivery.  brought flu shot ya numb skull real. (well, media) need stop giving people false sense power covering bullshit opinions masking ‚Äúnews‚Äù. Hey whatever takes get people vaccinated. think undo vaccine fine me.  No, course not.

Take next time move goalposts: Sorry, saying improving ventilation doesn‚Äôt work? misinformation it‚Äôs dangerous.  "" Christians "" rapture moment.

This part get make stand ~~the mark beast~~ Vaccines.

Source: family/Loved ones U.S. Russia. Literally canceling Santa Claus. War Christmas! think 3-5 %, considering get type vaccination. That's supposed case restaurants NYC far less half places I've actually asked. Covid-19 seem hit Europe harder rest world even though vaccination rate among highest countries like UK, Austria, Netherlands etc.? That‚Äôs neat! Get vaccine take bath! That‚Äôs brilliant! didn‚Äôt think before! ‚Äúif done globally coordinated lockdown 2020 could avoided this‚Äù people insane enough. person entire different level!  agree, fact pretty much France, bit late now. best have. Yes. Anti-vax, anti-censorship leisure activities partake hard work book-burning done week. perceive ""pandemic unvaccinated"" ""the vaccinated share"", he's right. share vaccinated, things would bad, too.

But compare shares, number vaccinated dwarfed number unvaccinated. Yet cry foul point vaccinated. sports fan, think NFL fans respect Rodgers' intellect opinion.

He's least worries. keep thinking this. many election influenced small amount voters. Bush Gore 2000 one. going make difference long run. official numbers say 762k covid deaths US. However, it‚Äôs Lillie million looking excess mortality pandemic instead raw covid numbers. March us estimated 900,000. That‚Äôs many dead  take vax instead ""cure"" later

This. seriously people, rube-goldbergesque mess conspiracy ignorance landed somehow situation that, still insane, actually one live with. MESS UP. correct.  appalled number people cannot handle one variable making decision. give much information frozen uncertainty nothing. many respond one answer qualifications. Yet another failing educational systems coupled fact develop late never develop higher order reasoning skills. kind voodoo essential oil moms recommend RSV,flu, croupü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è really matter time. US gone top 50 fully vaccinated country, 72nd vaccinated country.

Brazil started 85th 64th, still climbing. 

As countries gain access vaccine, expect see US settle around middle. general rule, traditional doctor offices tend work flu vaccines regular appointment schedule. Clinics pharmacies tend lot walk-in vaccine also engaged site administration (such place work certain day two).  jesus christ  butcher education basically destroyed critical thinking within greater population. also long history science denial.   Germany very, large problem homeopathic/alternative doctors. doubt mind majority people ""can't"" get vaccinated told one fake doctors. example, couple weeks ago post r/de poster's grandma vaccinated ""doctor"" told frail poor health body tolerate it. Obviously BS. doctors tell patients ""can't"" wear mask due asthma something. 

German healthcare literally pay see witch doctor want reading glasses, birth control, routine STD screening, SOL. think somebody started try get vaccinated surpassed Canada Exactly going say.  Huh. Good know! go work??
In Italy since one month ago can‚Äôt go work don‚Äôt green pass. allowed work home, green pass give right WFH. Oh well, could not, that's much figure out. Yes, know scar comes from. mean use different form vaccine US now, scar, see evidence vaccinated like scar do.  also asthma anything catch goes straight lungs. love working home I'm always sick asthma much better controlled. Also flu 6 years ago literally even get bed 4 days. flu wrecks you. Anyhow got covid booster yesterday, I'm messing around that. 6+ months last dose Covid? so, I‚Äôd personally get it. Especially going winter Northern Hemisphere, feel like it‚Äôs inevitable spread many areas. celebrate upcoming holidays, it‚Äôs nice little extra protection increased gatherings. given wrong dose. headline read: pharmacy breaks protocol diluting adult Pfizer vaccine pediatric patients. absolutely way Romney, McCain bush 1 2 would argue masks vaccinations high school weights trainer USA leg 8‚Äù shorter due Polio (he‚Äôs likely 70‚Äôs now)

And yes, saw fair number rural areas Brazil. Polio officially eliminated 1989 Brazil according best data could find. still affected it. Creating leper colonies. Asshurt. need use word often. need outlive them. playing Russian roulette, dont want catch stray. read half article agreed everyone let believe this, read whole article sounds like bunch dangerous stuff like sucking vaccine syringes too. COVID hitting Christian countries (U.S, Russia, Italy) hardest? totally agree overall argument. personally I'd frame as: ""We pandemic unvaccinated unboosted"".

Or Dr. Bob Walker, Chair UCSF Dept Medicine, puts get ""vaccine designed prevent infections"" line. vax used prevent 95% infections, wanes, protection restored via safe/cheap boost (not prevents cases/Long Covid‚Äìit also keeps community safer),  ""many epidemiologists"" relatively small circle heavily ideological followers around-zero political influence. Reality called name. ""opinion question"" way antivaxx groups also ""a different opinion"". live virus that's perfectly fine.

The protection hospitalisation death barely wanes people younger 50-60 years old. kind ""if vaccines sterile, entirely rely them"" logics absolutely identical among Querdenkers NoCovid extremists. is, course, entirely false - _we needed vaccines first place virus leads loaded hospitals many deaths_, since prevent effectively (with two shots people, three elderly/sick), goal achieved. That's measure effectiveness need, everything else irrelevant.   Correct. would marginal gain tweaking mRNA sequence specific Delta, really worth work needed adjust 

Suspect they‚Äôre watching see offshoot Delta shows signs vaccine evasion, case would probably tip balance favor making adjustment boosters even main 2 dose regiment right here: ""Misinformation emboldens believe falsehoods led physical violence doctors, death threats public health officials protesters blocking cancer patients entering hospitals. 
Since scientific triumph safe effective vaccines SARS-CoV-2 virus many discussions patients. ones start ‚ÄúI‚Äôm anti-vaxxer‚Äù inevitably lead vaccine denial. Similarly, Rodgers defends celebrity credibility someone ‚Äúnot sort anti-vaxx flat Earther. somebody who‚Äôs critical thinker‚Äù ‚Äúdid research.‚Äù 
Yet amplified dangerous disproven myths COVID-19 vaccine."" That's impressive, honestly. must really popular parts country, cause Massachusetts seemingly ain't taking it. clinic primary day, drove curiosity getting coffee packed regular day doctors office. I‚Äôm worried thing happen US vaccine won‚Äôt choice anymore  Question tinnitus vaccine: low-level tinnitus got lot louder 2 doses. booster cause tinnitus get even pronounced? around permanently, restrictions, accept deaths it, new generations get early lives get typical viruses form immunity. Flu ""can reduced"" absolutely need to, even helped prevent thousands yearly deaths, since costs would greatly outweigh benefits. That's stand regarding COVID, too. Whether ""pleasant"" think avoid getting infected altogether irrelevant since marginal group. There‚Äôs headline never thought I‚Äôd read. live strangest timeline There‚Äôs headline never thought I‚Äôd read. live strangest timeline Oh, great. lot sick people coughing over. Lovely. 
 
I hate timeline. Truly. Every little helps  tell anti-vaxxers get vaccine card, ""undo"" afterwards? Maybe quick shoot one down. wife pregnant got shots good friend ours. Months later babies. Clearly vaccine makes people babies. Although, clear, surgical mask top N95/FFP2 fine. probably add real filtration, keep clean (especially N95/FFP2 fluid resistant, saw healthcare workers beginning pandemic). I'm imagining going Avatar mode last shot. Nobody 12 vaccinated threw kids back schools, level vaccination general population insufficient.

Virus going whatever going do. Probably something along lines seasonality effect spreads winter cold areas everyone inside dry air, spreads summertime hot areas everyone inside dry air. Plus human behavior incidence goes stop taking precautions goes start careful, seems randomly pogo stick every 4 months. UPDATE: absolutely mentioned it. Still conspiracy theories, good news posts seem really dying hopefully group them. tell declaring ‚Äúwar Christmas‚Äù watch heads explode  Logic checks out.

Vaccines make babies. Well, choice? There's seems plenty go around since holdovers getting time soon. ""at risk"" get boosted US 65, criteria broad practically everyone qualifies anyway. go now, one turn away. Also eligibility already much wider think (asthma, depression, BMI 25, hypertension, vague description high risk work strong vaccination drive get-go. Boosters provided, vaccines provided children. capital can‚Äôt go specific places unless fully vaccinated, rest country can‚Äôt go work unless fully vaccinated weekly PCR. anti-vax movement minimal support here. smart folks NYC. :) Seasonal dynamics something like least 10x spread cold weather extremely hot weather (inside using heater A/C). Across Europe weather turned cold starting October. 

Additionally, vaccines really recognized 3-dose series order maintain longer effectiveness, Germany recently approved boosters (instead previous approval age 70+). 

To see difference booster campaign makes, compare UK Israel case graphs, around time UK approved boosters age 50+, Israel rolled 18+. Israel completely rocked pandemic case curve, UK remains high. cannot ignore symptomatic infections let pandemic rage.    authorities diagnosed 21,060 people COVID-19, 304 people died coronavirus-related diseases past three days, official government portal reported Monday morning. 5,286 people coronavirus infection hospital, 519 ventilator. Seriously, don‚Äôt think heard anyone turned away since late-October. one asked eligibility got one. free point necessary. 

It‚Äôs shame CDC/FDA guidance behind scientific curve. think cases climb see adults become eligible nationally, maybe December. probably late avoid significant surge holidays.  idiots reads titles conclude Russians even want Sputnik vaccine reason, way could flown Croatia get Sputnik vaccine first. They're getting booster shots available Croatia approved EU fly EU since Sputnik vaccine yet approved EU. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Point hypocrisy move on, rinse, wash, repeat. Anything else giving wanted beneficial attention. still missing point... people LOSING JOBS harrassed attacked CAN'T take shot medical reasons, employer ZERO excuse policy idiots street give damn person doctors note.

I idiot screaming sitting car without mask on. total lack common sense amount stupidity event astounding. nature's way. accept it. absolutely, yes. America never completely free democracy. It‚Äôs bit late that.  nonsense. Vaccines prevent spread. study shitty methodology repeatedly debunked r/science. vaxxers posting repeatedly avail. biggest flaw study study timeframe 7 days. isn‚Äôt long enough assess progress disease.  Inconceivable Inconceivable.  mean 1954 - 1973 Communist Control Act meant US didn‚Äôt free elections since ‚Äúcommunist-action‚Äù party, including Communist Party, banned? really showed us, can‚Äôt come back  true, got denied actually 6 months. go somewhere else told flat HIV since back off. It'll definitely last longer since brings antibodies much higher second dose. reply point though - know it'll still decay annual boosters desirable, 3-4 doses give lasting immunity. really enjoyed commercial. nice job. upfront fact 3rd shot. want claim unvaccinated, that‚Äôs prerogative, aware although Pfizer dosage initials booster, dose 50% moderna booster is. know lied HIV get booster.  Breathing nose filters droplets certainly better idea.  miss aerosols though (it's far n95 quality filtration). Dehydration common avoidable side effect.

Fools always quickly separated money think ventilation (and filtration) help great deal cutting intensity waves additional benefits helping reduce waves influenza, colds, norovirus. better filtration, indoor air quality improve less mold pollen allergens, diesel exhaust, smoke wildfires. There's also lot plastic garbage particulates air healthy studied. also know many diseases thought spread fomites likely often spread air like MRSA, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

So think filtration investment lot benefits. better filtration/ventilation high school chorus/band/plays, jetways, conference rooms, double-occupancy hospital beds, bars/restaurants, churches, would likely different ""R0"" many diseases.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* got mine CVS 12th Walnut. Signed online, questions asked new Matrix movie even need advertise. Apparently people desperate advertise them. They're still turning people away places. asked pharmacy Philly low doses enforcing criteria strictly. probably depends are. Well, people arent known brains.. recent paper University Austin shows whole, raw potato, soaked borax 35 minutes, administered suppository 4 times effect detox bath.  also nobody asks cares vax distribution sites idk boosters getting torpedoed thing coming from, rollout NY example going fine. got mine couple weeks ago record stored Samsung Pay. update automatically show got booster? that, unless people genuinely know? claimed unvaccinated see way disproving anyone. trust CDC instead take bath things know nothing about? Genius level thought. Wow. Header image red pill blue pill. Really?  directly reflected incidence. Take federal state saxony example. Incidence vaccinated 73, unvaccinate 1389. highly unvaccinated area therefore automatically create high incidence (if testing high), npis used again. Furthermore areas US show high enough vaccination rates. numbers 90% 40% seem extreme prove point. Natural immunity due infection deaths higher might play greater role, still unreasonable assume US get winter without npis due terrible vaccination uptake. Mother-in-law still dealing long Covid symptoms, like body pains, dizzy spells fatigue comes goes sure post this, finally convinced friend get vaccinated (between scared needles mutual friend got Guillain Barre [she still advocates vaccine], tough), going getting J&amp;J get Pfizer booster, anything know help after? know friends got asses kicked rest day, I'm trying help minimize that. Like, eat hand, drink after, etc.? point setting rules? can't prove vaccinated anyway, they?  Low effort, banal America bashing. Always good votes. Late night bed trying get asleep alwayse best guess \*expect\* last longer, since that's vaccines work. OTOH, new virus, new vaccines, really know.

Chances are, 6 months so, start getting data. People pressured taking vaccines. Yay population protected now, cost? I'm curious see results QR society. Well, 12-17yo's cannot decide vacc rates comparatively low age group.  Yes, Russians making comment local grown Vaccine. can't travel EU EU approved vaccine. Sputnik V EU approved. different staff members notices somebody stealing fighting store. can‚Äôt arrest personally, call police. ‚Äòjust walk off‚Äô doesn‚Äôt mean general rule doesn‚Äôt prevent people stealing fighting. COVID PogU ""ventilation"" hogwash

Do data showing outdoor spread common? feasible, given rare outdoor transmission appears be, seems like unvaccinated population indoor contacts would less spread vaccinated population normal indoor contacts. Better ventilation indoor spaces approximation this, likely lot better ""test trace"" (which never worked can't keep borders shut)

Contact tracing technique keeping low cases low getting early warning longer low. combined testing borders requiring foreigners participate contact tracing system. course, work well United States general population go along multiple reasons.

""Optional vaccinations only"" clearly sufficient policy manage pandemic, intermittent lockdowns option.  question might seem bit stupid, let's consider inhale air contains coronavirus virons. Would better inhale nose mouth? heard difficult virus infect mouth time breathing trough nose filters air. Trending Twitter purely sane people mocking morons enraged fictional marketing fabrication protected fictional self fictional elves.
Absolute turnips anti-vaxx bunch, goodness fair assessment. 

I lot nurses family. paid attention, lot time issue wasnt ever getting vaccine, ignoring union contracts placing undue burdens staff. example, get paid sick leave react vaccine? still access ppe working covid floor? paid exposure quarentine? still exposure quarentines? 

Remember, hospitals threw safety staff window completly COVID. providing adequate ppe, firing nurses using sick leave, forced pregnant women work covid floors, forced overtime, flagrently ignored union contracts union busted. necessarily nurses trust vaccine, nurses trust hospital, damn reason. Hospitals wanted vaccines arms could drop safety PTO protocols get back getting abused work quickly possible. nurses wanted contractual guarantees protect health safety happened. 

You really make hobby judging nurses barely escaped death every day two years continue get unrelenting abuse? Victim blaming finest, truly. Compliance rules really low. People dining indoors full capacity, even masks used elsewhere, plenty opportunities spread. Restaurants asking vacation status. Employers can‚Äôt make mandates. seasonal changes obviously. hand, massive testing schools means asymptotic cases noticed compared places less testing.  aid treatment baking soda epsom salt bath, good cupping after.. Still true. Got boosted 2 weeks ago. feel great I‚Äôm ready start licking door knobs again.  fewer unvaccinated people Tesco...

yay!! No, doesn't. confounding data. vaccination rate 350m person country. variation locally. one county, might 90% vaccination rate another 40% rate. higher rate county, hospitals empty. case rate exact NPIs.

Dr. Monica Gandi wrote this.

The CDC changes policy slowly consultation experts. Many swinging doubt NPIs highly vaccinated situations. can't afford loose PTO think original 2 doses fine now, esp people get vaccinated. wear masks try go super crowded indoor areas.  It‚Äôs stretch, I‚Äôm curious anyone anecdotal evidence low antibody test vaccine efficacy? 

I‚Äôm cancer survivor got booster shot August. got antibody test S-type antibodies positive, low (mine 25 range ranges .8-2500). know fully vaccinated healthy individuals 600-800 range. anyone lower antibody count encountered COVID fine? curious stand unfortunately concrete evidence yet minimum benchmark vaccine efficacy vs quantity antibodies. Thanks advance!  Maybe final solution would give death penalty anti vaxxers. can‚Äôt harm us ever again

/s last year grocery bill gone around $400ish month (for family 3), easily $600+ per month.

Good thing getting $300-$250 month form child tax time need 5 things store swear it‚Äôs $100. fed family processed crap I‚Äôm sure would cheaper.

I went Five Guys yesterday. spent $18 burger, fries, drink. went grocery store bought $18 worth cold cuts would enough make cold cut sandwich lunch week, would healthier. 

I also reject claim [""processed = lot blame rampant obesity, consider holistic circumstances people living poverty US, obesity generally choosing.

I willing give way latitude living actual food deserts living poverty line. 13% people poverty line 37% rate *obesity*, highly doubt poor people obese percentage absolutely comes solidly middle class people indulge many gluttonous habits. Currently better fart around democrats. fart around Republican friends Republican president power. Good, I'd love that. wouldn‚Äôt say parents reluctance huge factor 1/3 kids even eligible. Bah. lived there, *tolerated* differences. bad. One question is, immunity third dose last longer second dose?

In words, going need boosters every 6 months? Personally mind getting booster, know many people want to. potential drag pandemic even longer turns twice-a-year boosters required.

I'm already feeling like never going end! I'm sorry consequences actions catching you. Possibly this? http://injectsafebandages.com/  Serious question‚Ä¶have opened everyone point? Everything I‚Äôve read says anyone 6 months last Moderna/Phizer 2 months last J&amp;J.  Absolutely moron. needle's tip probably got damaged going bandaid, longer surgically sharp reached skin. rather cutting cleanly, wrecked things way in.

If I'd talk manager facility got vaccinated putting people risk infection vaccine working correctly. mean (SD) age survivors 54.4 (8.9) years, 140‚ÄØ196 (56%) male, **and 197‚ÄØ777 (79%) hospitalized acute COVID-19**. 

Emphasis mine. study representative general population. people hospitalized. Further, analysis studies. Unless missed something, control group. downplay importance research, must looked context. would ever advocate smoking. takes way single cigarette become addicted nicotine. get anti vaxxers get vaccinated? get shot get privileges back detox. Got booster yesterday. COVID, got 2 shots, booster still kicked ass symptoms. (Fever, chills, exhaustion) super protected body terrible? Lol  gonna go ""good saturnalia"" year. Nah, next year much better off. Kids chance get vaccinated unvaccinated either immune dead till then. winter, though... you‚Äôre telling still hospitalized spread virus post vaccination? less likely?

...yes. That's vaccines work. That's they've ALWAYS worked. even condom 100% effective; still get fatal car accident even wear seatbelt. Good job figuring out. would bode much much worse actual COVID infection virus actively replicating millions billions copies itself, including many times spike proteins, relative vaccine generates spike proteins. Vaccines use spike protein target finite dose replicate, get cleared body within hours. anything underscores critical get vaccinated.

I asking based part previous post. like went way call 65% vaccinated ""embarrassing"". Lookin' good, America. Yeah unless live here, everyone thinks everyone else idiot. It‚Äôs coexist strangely enough. forget ""Don't Tread Me"" always meant ""Don't Tread ***ME***"". care (interpretation of) rights, rights only. think wrong keep unvaccinated away others, see problem cause healthcare system collapsing, would hurt many many MANY people. propaganda rotten west vaccines kind backfired, comrades. Let's see Japan. Vaccination level Western Europe. also temperature London. Population density somewhat higher. Still number new cases 100 day 1-2 deaths.

But countries much lower vaccination rate, similar climate much lower new cases deaths. I'll get back PC I'll get examples. hope one day open mind Right, would rather society prioritize honor life, regardless age. someone chosen see prioritized someone something fully endorse. Lol aunt passed away (of cancer) polio child‚Äî almost died left lifelong disability. Honestly disturbing unable people learn history. ppl seem firmly believe America can‚Äôt fall like empires wrong‚Äî we‚Äôve clearly demonstrated inability learn past mistakes willful rejection even trying learn closed vaccination centers . Kinda making mountain molehill, hey bring shorter queues üòè  ""functions better"" rather general, something say, I? Weird. depths human stupidity truly incomprehensible efficacy numbers J&amp;J + Pfizer booster? numbers? lol

Just random curiosity really like people wanted boycott stores let without mask. Great, thanks cooperation. It‚Äôs supposed detox bath, drinking stuff. Pretty harmless way. Right! Thank forgot that. quote Honer Simpson : am, like sucker, going work everyday. Lmao people really complain anything Chokshi's NYC ad saw TV yesterday says highly recommends get one got unless J&amp;J mean, explained comment -= isnt much nuisance said.

and note governments forcing things: sole purpose government force people follow certain rules, otherwise revert back governments rules existed, nomadic stone age tribes roamed Africa.   saying while, really tired shocking looks me

Those people clearly don‚Äôt want medical treatment, could give two shits die  Natural selection play. No, get booster J&amp;J, Pfizer, Moderna per current CDC guidelines. sure sound like antivaxxer.

choices consequences. welcome real world.    Americans here: many European countries mind governments put measures slow spread virus. ""freedom"" concept trust governments. reason, although usual covidiots USA, people tend follow measures. 


I'd love government Spain introduce measure country. Although many anti-vaxxers Austria countries, around 90% ICU beds used unvaccinated people, fucking hate making Spain climb positivity rates.

Are trying make point here? agree..

Berlin - Time again, politicians speak ""pandemic unvaccinated"". World Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery recently even warned . Behind accusation mainly vaccination refusers contribute bad Corona situation - also responsible tightened measures. Berlin virologist Christian Drosten disagrees: ""We pandemic unvaccinated, pandemic,"" stresses. pandemic ""to everyone contributes - including vaccinated, albeit somewhat less"".

Drosten sees core problem fact existing vaccinations withstand delta variant coronavirus limited extent. ""After two three months, spread protection vaccination begins decline,"" says. Older people particular already vaccinated spring, adds. ""They gradually losing spread protection, becoming so,"" Drosten says. second problem, however, actually fact larger number unvaccinated people. Among 60, rate fully vaccinated people 86 per cent, said. ""That insane, really dangerous,"" Drosten continues. 

Drosten: Booster campaign could prevent worse things happening

A possible way worsening pandemic situation
. ""What could would carry booster campaign great vigour, campaign third-party vaccinations among already vaccinated, starting elderly,"" says Drosten. way, might possible guarantee herd protection duration winter. Ideally, would succeed: boosting closing existing vaccination gaps. question remains many people go along it. 

Drosten: Demands tests unrealistic

There many options:
Drosten considers unrealistic. noticeable testing effect, ten million tests per week would needed, spring. lack alternatives, Drosten says, resort contact-restricting measures again. know whether legally tenable. would remain would ultimately lockdown unvaccinated. ""Whether reduce incidence November - doubts,"" says Drosten.

Like I'm genuinely curious would want kids vaccinated. youre risk sure mortality healthy children pretty much 0% long term effects still unknown. reunification, companies old GDR compete closed down. Mass unemployment followed. Many, especially educated, young, female part population, left went western Germany concentrated cities (e.g. rural state Saxony-Anhalt lost 1/4 population). rural areas especially Saxony shaped old, badly-educated, bitter men, mistrust institutions high.

Got first comment removed ""political"", leave that. 1.	Regional concentration south. Aggregate numbers telling whole story.

Narrator: *but later*

If Idiots could put two two together line would exist.   lay feet insurance companies doctors. seems partisan divider awhile; global warming biggest divider last decades.

At point, divide one side embracing full-blown contempt expertise, seemingly figurehead exhibited full-blown contempt expertise experts pushed back asinine assertions made look like fool. Whether experts national weather service scientists making hurricane path projections, climate scientists, military strategists, public health officials, contempt expertise one common denominator disregard advice experts. Oh thanks I‚Äôll try tomorrow. It‚Äôs tad better still feel thirsty.  Holy shit. vaccinating pets misdemeanor crime, least, Florida... now. Saint-Petersburg everything works usual, even six feet requirement followed practice. common folks confused even whether outbreak exists need vaccination urgently.

However, regions already started introduce strict QR-code-even-for-groceries policy, like neighbouring Tatarstan republic Samara oblast.  need prepare world vaccines met skepticism educating people scientific reasoning

We need start forcibly vaccinating people. fucking around. clear, pro-vax. believe vital everyone can, obtains vaccination protect can't. adults household fully vaccinated.

*However,* type person refused vaccine certain political online beliefs, last group people take news well. effectively giving conspiracy theorists want.

Lockdowns effective enforced taken seriously. year half these, humans whole turned Facebook mum's Twitter dad's realise feel persecuted. recent events indication, anti-vaxxers US get lesson free market economics insurance premiums go anyone refusing vaccines. market doesn‚Äôt care personal beliefs unless law says to. 

We‚Äôre seeing tip house iceberg now, contracts renewal coming months. 

Put beliefs one hand stack dollar bills figure carries weight.  One favorite things Covid shutdown getting couple year colds. point I've gone full 2 years without little bugs. I'm looking forward reemerging society germs.  Eventually? Republicans. Flu affects elderly often severely older likely you‚Äôll Democrat. good measures place. good measures mean measures dont divide already divided world even more.

So go lockdown unvaccinated decided get vaccinated? No. Fuck that. see would extremely hypocritical, talking individual choice punishing others‚Äò choices?   argument person X choice, ostracised it, choice, invariable quality. wanted say. think pregnancy influences pregnant person think mistaken.

Edit: unvaccinated also lead infecting millions people, good measures place. good measures mean measures dont divide already divided world even more.  afford fly here? walk pharmacy get it. sarcastic. hope aren‚Äôt serious case wondering antivax bots coming from, russia conservatives ones behind literal paid shills. 

Look video YouTube vaccine, every single one brigaded trolls downvoted oblivion. However, look video russian sputnik vaccine, comments like found. 

If want know controls them, find refuse criticize. That's interesting take! Brazil always strong ally vaccines medicine, weird dumb (only voting)    CDC making app they're worried antivaxxers starting civil war ""right"" continue causing pandemic. Austrian here. true! Unvaccinated people meet one two persons close you, like girl/boyfriend, parents e.g.   Nah clever, set precedence claiming 10 sessions say that? We‚Äôve pretty exactly lot parts Canada it‚Äôs working fine.  pregnant infect around pregnancies eventually causes worldwide pregnancy pandemic kills millions. ü§£   point, I‚Äôm feeling increasingly confident anti-vax crowd responsible bringing polio back lifetime. global warming biggest divider

When Republicans decided deny climate change face clear science, that's started shift pure fantasy. Horrible fantasy that. sure antivax even remotely significant Austria... That's American french thing vaccine mandate would smarter choice avoided dividing population.  choice state jurisdiction over. like saying OK state mandates abortion permitted, woman made choice sex must deal consequences. Human body something state interfere with. Definitely don‚Äôt agree that. Rushing second doses, enough testing next tracing, mixed messaging masks early on‚Ä¶a lot bigger missed opportunities US.  good No, get wrong you‚Äôre highly sensationalising personal approach life death. merely giving personal take situation people decide themselves, pro anti vax, problem either view situation.

Post post focuses DEATHS, always deaths. 5 million big number. objectively speaking, focusing infected expected recovered, done exceptional well. Lockdowns public health measures helped, doubting that. people roll dice risk minimal THEMSELVES. meant selfish also selfish force limitations people make decision.

That‚Äôs thought important give perspective people think differently you, shouldn‚Äôt punished basic human rights void it.

Couple fatalism realistic outlook life death, vaccine becomes somewhat untrustworthy, null worth risk without.

No amount science proof vaccines safety adjust people‚Äôs selfish outlook, sometimes that‚Äôs okay? Even people‚Äôs lives line.

Because things actually get serious, people look closest around them. entire situation validates true megalomaniacs either side pond. 

But entire point boils this, people prefer natural approach things unravel without intervention. It‚Äôs possible say, worldwide poll taken, think we‚Äôd shocked percentage would allow COVID rip communities let deaths pile up. knows numbers mostly acceptable without vaccine some. 

Let‚Äôs say 40/50 million people die continued normal, lockdowns public restrictions. Herd immunity strong come side. That‚Äôs 0.6% loss society people find tantalising trusting freshly made vaccine. It‚Äôs something alien people hard time trusting material pumped body.

Just personal opinion end day, decided would like minimise risk others also knowing current health. 

People never decision health removed. softer approach that, spiral enforcement get worse, validates lot anti vax folk.

Breaking way makes easier understand anyone‚Äôs individual decision. Fear mostly decider people don‚Äôt make best choices whilst operating fear. No, source 4:1 death rate. true name, though.    hate left, they‚Äôve begged, bribed, pleaded yelled trying get people right thing, they, trump office. There‚Äôs hate politics one side Covid. Lmao, outrageous, sorry. 

We arrived point people losing rights dont want consent certian form medical procedure. harsher measure exists state mandated vaccination without consent individuals. Getting vaccinated personal choice! least been. 

Why take away basic rights? Like people children understand ""do this, else punishment come"". executive legislative branches goverment think people enjoy crisis? Repression, repression repression. 

The average age people die coronavirus higher average life expectancy several EU countries! saying young people die entirely correct young people also die kinds diseases accidents preventable, example, state mandate obligatory alcohol test driving car outright ban sale alcohol. rightly so, everyone makes decisions state shouId telling people time do! 

I dont want rude blunt always space basic human rights, right? Restricting personal freedom freedom movement along right work last possible measure taken. Prison last possible measure criminal offenders exactly takes away freedom movement extent lot rights. Last possible measure!

I realise getting vaccinated best solution keep people dying, worst symptoms, infecting others, keeping hospitals collapsing really need force people taking away basic rights? 

Why state urge opressive directly, could mandate, case maximum capacity hospitals, vaccinated people take priority unvaccinated foot whole bill hospital visit shit like that? 

Everyone choice live do. Vulnerable groups that- vulnerable. pains say is, extent, problem. de facto locking people sake protecting vulnerable group nonsensical. People discover trough others obligation towards those, forced never learn. 

Before tag antivaxxer, vaccinated chose it. hate ill, love (elder) relatives friends, miss hanging people, travelling, going sports matches believe getting vaccinated best way it. kind manner state, entity guardian people forcing something upon them, threatening dire consequences dont something said so. believe kind mentality ill fated catastrophic certian cases. 

Educate, punish people ignorance. Punishment better evolving improving people society education cases.   Nah. Dipshits gonna dipshit matter what. Worst case, measures like accelerate inevitable. *takes fake nose glasses*

‚ÄúMuhahha, along!‚Äù also said try bleach‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt choice thanks comment. know it‚Äôs global economy flu circulates world every single year planes, cargo ships, general migration intercontinentally etcetera correct? Honestly, boosters somewhat muddy waters. appears vaccines holding pretty well preventing hospitalizations deaths without booster - especially certain age groups. preventing cases though, not-so-much. got booster 3-year-old daughter high-risk condition, protection getting case me, means I'm less likely pass something her, protection her. feel like boosters 100% individual look personal situation make risk assessment. 

I however think previously Covid, get least one dose vaccine. Multiple studies shown better protection infection add vaccination. general disobeying direct orders? covid patients enough fun work..... Thanks!! 42% week many 7-day rolling averages divide. calculator helps. use Oct 13, instance, get

Even important would getting parents, likely beyond 6 months out.

You line avoid unvaccinated people though.  Well guess change things.  1% variant. masquerade variant . chris odd variant .   How's working out? exhorting people fail less productive stopping rampant rise obesity?  Right mainstream conservative position COVID-19 vaccines somehow radically different others. However arguments standard anti-vax canards could used vaccine. same, forgot first card got second. Base told could go immunizations combined, kept forgetting. got booster CVS combined one me. carry around kids wallet 3 cards lol. Here's issue.

I've got vaccines, got flu shot. kids date inoculations flu shot. I'm pro vax, issues it. Let's go!

However, show hesitation kids take covid vaccine, tap brakes comes getting booster I'm called science denier, luddite genocidal maniac.

Vaccines reduce disease burden individuals society. delta, circulating variant (Covid 1.0 eradicated vaccines), reduce transmission much, reduces hospitalization enough 100% vaccinated could pretty much go back normal. kids got sore arm fever? words, ""what common cold deadly?""

As suggest, decline childhood vaccinations multiple causes. 

In 2020 early 2021, drop childhood vaccinations primarily due lack access care. People lost jobs also lost health insurance; many also moved became homeless. time, number patients pediatric practices could see dropped need keep everyone distanced isolated. Many free clinics provided services at-risk populations closed budget cuts pandemic restrictions. 

About needles: Every conceivable medical supply stock somewhere point pandemic, thankfully, standard hypodermic needles big problem.

There also supply chain issues certain types sterile glass vials used store vaccines; thankfully big problem childhood vaccines USA need cryo-vials used extremely low temperature storage. childhood vaccines also enormous production runs multi-year supply contracts, helped. may grim, would rather focus anti-vaccine, instead anti-climate change, used be.

That's I'm saying.

Yep. We're busy arguing idiots whether vaccines effective, etc. Stop taking insulin, it‚Äôs microchipped! point sent bill like singapore Quick question, often history mass house arrests ever ended looked upon favorably history normal, necessary policy, compared times haven't? wish US. there's one thing I've learned past two years, idiots literally kill admit morons get vaccinated. Well here‚Äôs hoping don‚Äôt pay much fines get caught. get caught, let know laugh them. Tell respectfully stop worrying what‚Äôs right comes protecting people running around unvaccinated don‚Äôt give fuck give Covid never think twice it. starting recover case Covid JJ vax 6 months ago, trying get booster couldn‚Äôt get one time. Got pneumonia I‚Äôm healthy 35, pretty pissed handled. forced office idiot came infected, fortunately didn‚Äôt go hospital close couple nights   That's good way get people shot. Yes. fucked. Measles going next big one. outbreaks last years anti-vaxxers, last year 22 million kids missed vaccinations.

Measles R0 around 12-15 among unvaccinated. Delta Covid around 5-9.  worries people might stop getting dogs cats vaccinated. need show proof vaccinations eat indoors restaurants, attend movies sporting events, attend large gatherings like weddings go gym. proof vaccinations reviewed places using provided app scan provided QR code. Italy every thing sounded much worse. made without collapse (although even lot staff died iirc) exactly I've afraid of.

I knew Antivaxxers convinced people afraid COVID vaccinations, would start denying modern medicine. hate right. Yes shot doesn‚Äôt give flu, people seem think happens. shot side effects it‚Äôs infected flu. happen? doctor? Could politicization COVID-19 vaccines lead politicization vaccines?

It's headed way long time though. Fucking Andrew Wakefield Jenny McCarthy set back vaccines hundred years. First autism fears based rigged study, tying politics. America also police murders innocent people, always headed evil imperialist problem killing innocent brown kids make bit money oil military industries.


Trump far problem America.  mandatory then. show sit Starbucks. Restaurants obvious place need show them. can't remember else top head think grocery stores never going list. Yeah guys stupid took horse paste need spread it. Already subject Breitbart article John Nolte September 10. 

I'd link it, want give traffic.  Already seeing here. nursing home family member mine got locked bit week ago got bunch covid cases. They've restricted visits precautions since began letting visits happen back around March April. Currently 7 residents 5 staff covid. Probably closed visitors next month more. he'd get rabies, also vaccine /s read closely. Sometimes higher better, donations lower odds better.

Your 95% confidence interval tell numbers significantly high low, use 68-95-99.7 rule amount anti maskers anti vaxxers America fucking high. people ignorant blame everything government.   symptoms myocarditis experienced? First off, every unvaccinated person covid spreads it. Second off, vaccine stop spreading it, makes somewhat less likely to, science settled extent does. alone enough want mandate it, logic, also mandate mask wearing literally rest time makes less likely spread common colds, flus, etc. right infect people illnesses either.Finally, original argument nothing whether covid contagious, fact person want pay medical costs peoples' decisions, would also apply smoking, obesity, etc. brought initial card got second dose, got new card second dose.

I desperately want put vaccination status single card add Apple Wallet. It‚Äôs 2021 ffs.  mine google pay wallet.  can‚Äôt breathe get help.  mean people beginning lockdowns insisted people lockdowned vulnerable? Well they're vulnerable group now. Australia even one app instead one per state. Ditto healthcare per state. I‚Äôm 22 got Moderna shots April haven‚Äôt got flu shot yet. Debating getting booster flu shot knocked time week. anyone done get sick?  think short sighted, think intentional coworker says tetanus something ""they"" made up. It‚Äôs 2021. want able add vaccination card Apple Wallet like basically every card. put car insurance it, let proof vaccination.

Or, drink driving illegal punishable imprisonment due known percentage risk committing act. 

COVID pathogen, also new grand scheme things. believe 1 3rd traffic deaths relate drink driving, real quantifiable risk death. COVID doesn‚Äôt statistical outcome comparing chance death. also natural morality situation changes.

I never compared two directly, used outline attack expect ‚Äònormal‚Äô citizen inclined do. 

Nobody expected forced take mandatory vaccination. would prefer people did, already peace idea don‚Äôt. heck you? I'm Quebec. We've issues system.

You must Ontario.    know harder measures implemented. come point, every needed measure labeled ""verfassungswidrig"".   works sadly.

People tend get confused proportional likelihood get sick (which much lower among vaccinated) absolute values. thousands cases among vaccinated, lot still gonna end hospitals, potentially straining healthcare system. 

Essentially pandemic end pretty much everyone infected. Fair point. said (at least according you, following that) job, resources, would reasonable criticism. I‚Äôm surprised isn‚Äôt norm everywhere. True, least there's much slimmer chance us die think puts (or newspaper reported it) 100% clear people twist words. course even vaccinated people getting sick contribute problem still careful, also says vaccination booster shots best bet get situation. shit like that's feeding antivaxers

 antivaxers feed shit, there's nothing us really us trying protect every drop news use benefit.

I understand frustration share it, give solitary shit anymore. news, something else make latch onto. pharmacists fault fucked administering vaccine kids causing antivaxers anything Oh airheads neither, close familiy member (fully vaccinated) stage 4 cancer would hate life saving surgery posponed unvaccinated CoViD cases Limited resources, guess. 

Imho whole thing lockdown unvaxxed people political stunt. Government wants demonstrate, easier vaxxed people. experts say, already late that, need full lockdown get situation.

There's loads idiots got vaxxed cause wanna get locked again. u gonna tell next, they're lockdown even tho got vaxxed?

My bet is, there's full lockdown weeks everyone.
And really care much anymore. hope get kids vaxxed soon public health system collapsing gets warmer numbers decreasing. working develop kits test autistic enterocolitis, condition claimed result MMR vaccine.  someone I'm close familiy (fully vaccinated) stage 4 cancer. I'm getting almost point supporting leave unvaccinated people ICU die order make room vaccinated people needing ICU care. average IQ planet grow. see absolute win. numbers that? wakefield trying sell mmr vaccine too? ""love"" implication they'd rather kid die preventable illness autistic. CDC recommends vaccination end October.

I don‚Äôt think number work way think. don‚Äôt think start 50% go 40% next month. source that?

CDC page: huge chunk ones see say still get flu even get flu shot really vaccine that's like COVID Actually wrong, every healthy adults vaccinated, virus severely weaken hard transmit, called ""herd immunity"". Sadly jeopardize healthy adults refuse vaccinated. 

The reason vaccinated ppl keep getting covid19 due new variants produce unvaccinated people. people refuse get vaccine, new vatiants virus produce.

So trust me, vaccination scientifically proven method protect people around you. remember back 2000s middle school bad flu year. school police officer came Health class encourage people get flu shots whole police department gets every year get too.

Clearly times changed.  Man. people really struggle context, you? pandemic continues everyone acquired humoral memory B cell response virus. Vaccinated people definitely response.

Not mention completely messed work schedule deadlines. serious problem, stuck trying deal next two weeks. avoiding worth shot. get inside, concert-goers show proof vaccinated tested negative coronavirus within previous three days.

Seems like people get testet, thst took place summer (the virus seems spread cold). According worldometer also hardly new covid cases general state took place time.

Germany covid cases right time pandemic (and pretty low vaccination rate compared western europe) . many restrictions place plan even stricter ones tr get control.

I'm saying cancel christmas markets,but makes sense current situation additional restrictions make changes ensure safety, even outdoors  otherwords, unvaccinated people pose threat vaccinated people.  fuss about?

18 month pandemic already know, one else answered you:

When hospitals ICUs get filled unvaxxed people, non-Covid related life-threatening issuses get denied treatement first. bad enough need hip replacement able walk again, can't get it, Anti-Vaxxer selfish...

And Austria point hospitals breaking point. doctors nurses already working overtime 18 months vaccine, kind ""okay"". now, 95% people treat ICUs unvaxxed. still need work overtime, even people could prevented hospital stay. numbers getting worse every week. Basically nothingburger. fuck think **not** job?  Lol can't even enter supermarket without health pass covid spike exact measures. explain county Waterford Ireland then? highest vaccination rate country, one highest world actually 99.7%, also highest covid rate country. evidence right front you. totalitarian measures help fact may even make things worse. Ah yes, ‚Äúmy feet still get wet bother umbrella‚Äù argument. Well, people read keywords jump conclusions. First, findings vitro (e.g. test tube).

Making delta-specific vaccine might useful places people still hard time getting first dose. places Pfizer Moderna make money from, people want vaccine it, boosters relevant part. 

Another thing might able Delta specific shot slightly lower dosage improve safety maintaining effectiveness Delta. rule Delta variant specific useless, getting much safety data mRNA vaccines impossible. 

There might also concern get vaccinated Delta-specifc vaccine super Delta comes out, might able get booster easily Delta antibodies effectiveish (similar people get flu vaccine every year may weaker protection given year flu changes little compared someone got flu shot year specific stain). happen antibodies still effective super Delta though, bad reason Delta vaccine. That's actually pretty good analogy seeing here. Without confidence intervals comparison worthless. Nope, probably see pediatrician We're great Sweden though - vaccines work. repeat got vaccinated knew travel rights going infringed didn't. I'm young, eat healthy take care myself. people really bad reactions jab, yes know small percent still exists deny say 'oh get jab' dumb. know people died cancer that's small percent too. know likely hood long term affects low still potentially exist. forcing people take shot arm want live normal life, dangerous prescient set. everyone's vaccine effectiveness wanes 8 months going also force everyone get every year? give farma companies billions every year?

If vaccinated care someone isn't? choice risk take. wont ever get rid covid that's argument. wish feel pressure get jab would perfectly fine without it. Also measles wipes immune memory. shit show. vaccinated make safe? Well kid vaccinated everything give her. feel like need give best shield protect craziy human petri dishes walking around.  And? due us exposed higher viral load thus upping chances slipping cracks significant enough huge impact double vaxxed.  need delta specific vaccine, current ones designed extremely well.

The contradicting information frustrating part.

Most people know afraid vaccine, afraid getting side effects pain body, headaches, nausea.. afraid would controlled evil government BS kind.. people afraid vaccine started seeing people taking feeling alright it, started feeling confident taking well took indeed..

The fact matter Donald symptom much greater threat modern civilization. there, governments organized groups, actively relentlessly shitposting internet single goal fucking modern civilization.

Everyone's risk, US significantly greater risk thanks decades people insisting properly teaching people. least US, lockdowns never ever coming back. They‚Äôre destabilizing society far more-so outright covid deaths are.

A lockdown done *first time* USA eventually. 

Taking vacation 2 weeks healthy. plan ahead reason people cannot supplies stockpiled. could, example, plan starting July 4th 2023. Could 99% counties Monday July 17th 2023.

With thorough mass testing campaign small towns counties could quarantine group. pick drop trailers without driver making contact anyone. barricade roads open briefly caravans tractor trailers. state lines drivers switch trailers right interstate. Emergency services need train double redundant team. lockdown crew quarantines 2 weeks 2 weeks after. 

For people takes 2 weeks relaxation (or telecommuting). Compare getting vaccinated every year 2025 2045. adds 20 days feeling sick sore. addition vaccine damage breakthrough infections continue get us ill. 95% reduction hospitalization still means going hospital 5% time. course 20 years odds look really bad. myriad diseases virus' permeate kill humanity, COVID another one many. Pre vaccination posed major problem combination high R value higher acceptable death rate systemic risk well spreader major pain/suffering.

Thanks vaccines, among taken protective step, risks plummeted danger level line ""acceptable"" risks.  remaining alive ones least really kills resources morons taking up. risk stress putting health care system - nothing. 

Sure, there's 3-5% people legitimately cannot get vaccine due allergies, problem. people worried honesty, well, bum smoke, take one puff, throw away. Boom, you‚Äôve smoked. Go get booster.

It's different discussion reason people historically foregone routine flu vaccines. username like that, got legit! exactly mean ""endemic""? me, word seems mean merely virus would around permanently. word know imply cheap pleasant around, around cannot reduced. contradicting information result people either understanding intentionally misrepresenting conditional probabilities.

The vaccine makes less likely get infected. infected, makes less likely develop symptoms. develop symptoms, makes symptoms less harmful.

Because less likely a) get infected, b) stay ill long, c) cough around lot meantime, also less likely infect others.

However, *are* infected, *can* infect others.

Also, classic example Bayes‚Äô theorem action: people vaccinated, ratio vaccinated people hospitals increase. doesn‚Äôt mean vaccine doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs like saying: people getting injured car accidents wearing seatbelts, clearly seatbelts don‚Äôt help.

The people vaccinated, less virus reproduce, fewer opportunities find new hosts.

Is two weeks feeling like crap (COVID vaccinated) 100 times worse (counting probabilities) day feeling cold? meh can't really assume things; need evidence. That's whole foundation science. variables play like cold storage procedure, adjuvant type amount, etc.  they‚Äôre looking rate infection vaccines mainly work stopping adverse affects getting covid. looked adverse affects would show different point. summary shaming people getting vaccinated letting make decisions. point research.

We knew people right thing(mask, distancing vaccines) variants would limit vaccines *stopping* transmission, still effective limiting bad outcomes(hospitalizations up). look, guess.

Hopefully means they‚Äôre finally coming around You‚Äôre 4 steps ahead! Oh, number - perhaps - generous estimate.

I personally know someone (she got anyway, really rough her) speculating near zero. personally know many people. 


edit: looked information. certainly appears lower 3%. I've seen anywhere .3 2%. talking them. talking vaccinated people. humoral immunity vaccination/recovery. immunity wanes exposed many times time old. virus also likely forced mutate eventually better completely escape immunity likely come cost fitness virus.

It unlikely there's kind reset virus goes back lethal.

It never cause zero deaths, immunity lifetime exposed it, it'll become another viral pneumonia. known ""the old mans friend"" tend get everyone end, often eliminate suffering chronically ill elderly.

And there's precedent respiratory virus this, since 1918 H1N1 pandemic came back every season seasonal influenza. come back pandemic waves killed 2.5% population every years.

And H1N1 jumped back humans 2009, everyone born 1957 T-cell B-cells H1N1 partial immunity took edge 2009 pandemic since older people partially inoculated ravage nursing homes. conclusion one draw mix match boosters?

Everywhere go, people masked staying 6ft away. high vaccination rate, Vermont showing Covid always us. political science, epidemiology. I'm familiar generalized social science methodology quantitative methods necessarily specific tools epidemiologists use or, whatever reason, avoid using.

This study makes weird choices. eye, choices bad enough find difficult understand made review.

(1) country study, they're looking confirmed case rates particular week comparing vaccination rates. would mostly measuring whether country before, during, delta-related surge.

(2) analysis US counties boxplot bar chart. including manner actual analysis generate estimate statistical discernibility?

(3) Even treat using figures instead analysis acceptable, figures US counties show appears eye obvious downward slope -- relatively highly-vaccinated counties better. Frankly, think they're showing estimates statistical discernibility here.

(4) analyses countries counties weight population size, means low-population countries/counties over-represented data. Low-population countries/counties inevitably going noisier levels vaccination rates covid.

(5) They're reporting percent counties increase. Why? dumb. raw information simply compute change case rates use DV. wish twitter would get rid trending tags feature media moronically abuses it. bet 80% tweets causing trend people ridiculing it.

One thing ridiculous individualists seem gloss government specifically setup ""promote general welfare"" population. means public works, aid, even \*gasp* welfare/healthcare wrapped that. also one core principals constitutionally gives federal government right institute public health safety measures. 

I mean...Washington required vaccination troops, one guys wrote damn thing, think arguing solid ground trying challenge constitutionality vaccine mandates. didn‚Äôt say wouldn‚Äôt weaken transmission everyone fully vaccinated boostered time (clearly vaccine effectiveness wanes) - realistic that? always people refuse also people cannot take it. people coming countries potentially bringing new variants them‚Ä¶People bad side effects days even true vaccine injury shots going want booster risks every 6 months indefinitely‚Ä¶

In many countries traditional 70% reached herd immunity - it‚Äôs enough. Also, UK health security report, showing seropositivity COVID antibodies (whether post-infection post vaccine - though distinguish two) 96% adult population. Yet case numbers high. I‚Äôm beginning think herd immunity simply possible virus (like isn‚Äôt common cold) unless manage vaccinate everybody - babies medically exempted. anyone left uncovered, variants form continue infect people. variants surely form amongst vaccinated get infected sick, right?

... stick it. would real incentive go there. I'm tired getting hairy-eyeball anti-maskers grocery. 

Like, dude... see cashiers? See still wear masks? long wear mask indoors, too. fair. heard ivermectin blow everything system. vaccines give type protection infection. simplify lot: vaccine, say, halves chance becoming infected, things like opening society makes one 10 times exposed virus, end result one 5 times likely get infected. reason see fivefold numbers cos vaccines likely result asymptomatic infections, means less testing.

Also vaccines may halve probability infection, mean probability given exposure drops 65% 15%, something like 2% 1%, long time exposure something like 21% 11% (the Dutch study spread within households).

Many factors make bigger difference. seasonal variation alone huge already vaccinations.

Edit: Dutch souce OK, uneducated downvoting me? know talking downvoting please explain why.

Especially since two top comments said did... Singapore, Moderna booster also half dose given primary series.

Source: booster dosage Moderna vaccine less 100 mcg used first two doses. data shown 50 mcg dose effectively boosts immune protection COVID-19.* similar thoughts summer listening biography. really recommend it, especially audiobook form Levar Burton reads it.

Something distinctly unprofessional begging trashed despite obviously good advice like right? sure Biden force issue. mean governors making recommendations seek.

Plus many doses ready go. could give basicly sterilizing immunity good chunk population matter weeks  Santa communist like Big Bird Still, trouble getting college due academics and, frankly, anyone would take animal dewormer follow Joe Rogan's advice least dumb ass. try avoid using moron describe people like that. Subsequently boosters torpedoed FDA CDC.

I think including CDC inaccurate. Pretty sure saying FDA ultimately powerless handed CDC blank check CDC proceeded write generous possible guidance high percentage people get boosters.

I mean, shoot, even opened door states like Colorado say ""Due high spread, everyone lives high risk environment"" curious osteopathic doctors likely recommend things like this? could coincidence seems like see D.O. pop often anti-vax content.

Cutting nose spite face. Quite sad, really. Really? shitty click bait article crap source reflect reality? shocked! Truly shocked! /s Here's problem: least US, people waste time thinking something to. read headline instead full article. 

So point messaging. 

If read full list criteria makes eligible booster, absurd covers like 80%+ adults US. must people that. read headline says, ""FDA CDC reject Pfizer's request approve boosters adults"" think, ""well shit, guess can't get booster."" NEVER THINK AGAIN.

The FDA CDC fumbled messaging time time pandemic, point inexcusable they're still getting wrong consistently. covid numbers high? Obviously that's 2/3 population, still. countries around numbers breaking records.   distrust spread around quilters? I'm sure people shop Morrison's Asda anyway, based sheer amount anti-maskers I've seen stores. rates fully vaccinated people (of entire population):

Sweden - 67.72% 

Germany - 67.53% anyone noticed seems increasing radicalization pro-NPI people social media (Ding, Lucky Tran, Yaneer, Denise Denwald, ""MDs"" platforms really seem real), that, pretty much everyone moved on? Even areas technically mask rules, people seem kind ignoring doors.

Do radical social media personalities stock masks? filtration systems? afraid loosing followers fading away obscurity? grift? heard dad's friend's sister's uncle's hamster's nephew's coworker, chiropractor, beat head mallet 69 times full moon, vaccine dematerialize inside veins detox body. Stop bus people! conservative triggered something don‚Äôt like.   comment made day. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Yay borax! less covid carriers. you‚Äôre telling still hospitalized spread virus post vaccination? less likely? 

And don‚Äôt believe got vaccinated ‚Äúreduce risk test.‚Äù Can‚Äôt arm vaxxed syringes car purses/backpacks, ‚Äòinfect‚Äô in-vaxxed? Germany seeing high cases people getting vaccinated?  It‚Äôs largely meaningless though. whole point everything keep people becoming sick, overrunning medical system dying. 

Stuff like Austria locking unvaccinated people precisely stuff like this. doesn‚Äôt matter much vaccinated person symptoms transmits another vaccinated person also symptoms, go daily lives. problem gets person end ventilator hospital.

When wild animals catch you‚Äôll never able fully contain it. people hate cancel culture sure love cancel culture That's true. Lesson: unvaccinated Florida.  good authority it‚Äôs effective second shot ‚Äî that‚Äôs key getting properly detoxed. anti-vaxxer's list ""conversation stopper"" words/phrases think shut inquiries people leave alone. thought saying ""HIPAA"" would enough, ""religion."" fails people keep pressing, usually get belligerent pretty quickly. problem get bunch contrarian blowhards, force become opposition stupid wrong. compromise contrarians, go get whatever want without considering views actual facts situation.

So contrarians force become uncompromising approaching things good faith.

I think Mr Rogers anything showing response dealing people acting bad faith. there's way much bad faith running around right now. I'm willing say bad faith right use be, idea reject common idea ""things use better"" usually espoused people ignored true situations past. Oh God damnit came back wtf here. Moderna 1, problem. 2, laid out. Fever, chills, malaise, joint pain. Moderna booster yesterday--just sore arm.

I've read reacted first dose Pfizer/Moderna second, means COVID. way around, reacted second shot, COVID. I'm curious non-reacting booster means, anything. thing Rodgers proven be, smug. Soon everything way. Sometimes stars something intelligent say. glibly shrug Covid extremely dangerous. That's people like AR Matthew McConaughey keep opinions quiet. many people think they're ""experts,"" want believe are, anyway. So, saying anti-vaxxers would upset US, previously said? sure effectiveness judges' rulings.

And number people actually *cannot* vaccinated absolutely tiny. clearly civil rights issues federal judges overruling state local requirements? nation's chief civil rights defender, ACLU, raising hell? Y'know, conversation whether vaccines mandated / whether unvaccinated people put house arrest, whether people get vaccinated. impression way argue vaccine mandates argue vaccination? never planning even going that

Anyhow, I'll actually admit many people like unvaccinated pretty bad reasons believe false claims, IDK sorts interactions us turn engaging conversation us anything, I'll say this: can't change someone's mind berating them, can't grow thinker listening people already agree Oh course. wanted warn numbers somewhere, mean can't go again.

This false. According article Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 3.5 GPA high school got 1310 SAT. Butte coach convince Rodgers‚Äô mother community college good enough academically. 

Rodgers attended Butte looking major college scholarship. It‚Äôs common move late-developing athletes. Especially guests psychedelics.

/s Whenever think sensationalist headlines, always think shitty cellphone games.

You know ones, download fucking ad level. ads always equally shitty games. shitty games advertising shitty games theory make money forcing watch ads... putting original money system make ads even worth anything?

Thats feel clickbait. people really clicking bullshit article misleading headline buying stuff advertised source? advertising agencies pay pageviews ever consider quality pageview? fuck injecting original money system creates it, ever pay off? That's clear densely populated countries getting colder much lower vaccination rate (and talking 3rd, even 2nd 1st dose here). Still cases/deaths far lower Europe. Unvaxxed costumers avoiding crowded stores? Good. Thanks antivaxxers! heard people shouting government going door-to-door forcing vaccines people, long restaurants started requiring employees vaccinated. They've shown boosts immunity well notably suppressed study direct comparison know much difference was. Neither countries much much fewer cases death rate. UK example 80% vaccination rate among 12+. Got mine ny morning. Super stoked now, think us get word tell friends family totally get booster CVS, regardless whether underlying conditions. They've felt vindicated since day one, they've doubled times count. Asking nicely TWO YEARS take precautions worked. Asking nicely get free, safe, effective vaccine could end plague FIVE MONTHS worked.

They've come excuses getting vaccine; Mark Beast, aluminum-based alien it, poison, saline, microchips, whatever. Waiting work. Waiting NEVER worked people give damn anybody themselves.

Even vaccine mandates businesses launched, anti-vaxxers wearing homemade Stars David shouting they're oppressed hunted forced take ""an experimental gene-therapy injection"". Even NOTHING happening them, cried pooped diapers cried came good time they're feeling attacked right now.

A crazy person might get crazy, sure, there's point waiting magically become LESS crazy. Fuck it. tried reasoning two years, nothing came it. fuck it. tried carrot, work; use stick. work? Use BIGGER stick - club. Joe Rogan expert everything. detox stuff scam decades. remember ‚ÄúMaster Cleanse‚Äù ‚Äúfacilitators‚Äù charging $400 supervise individuals going process 2001-2002. think assume (wrongly) passive immunity vaccinated mother's fetus utero provides long-lasting immunity. reality, passive immunity like typically wanes 3 6 months birth. 

Their post implies young children risk born unvaccinated mothers. that's case. case probably not.

Based NIH study Moderna booster best regardless primary series, even though based 100ug instead 50ug they're giving, still 30ug Pfizer. I'd stick Moderna.

But got JJ, definitely want mRNA booster. Yeah, know this. data we've collected since policy gone place called doubt, highly vaccinated areas. still lot cases, hospitalizations deaths. question becomes end-goal NPIs? playing odds, get forms colds flus ever. increasing - folks (like Ding) always leading sensationalist takes. really changed.

We've patiently watching world burn around us two years, think we've realize saying ""please help stop global pandemic killed millions people"" going convince people wear tiny piece cloth front mouths noses. least that's literally contagious... metaphorically.

People influence one area influential others. particularly surprising. But, hard science technical subjects, influential opinion valuable (and potentially harmful) unless expertise go along it.  I've got bunch people jumped line ignored rest it. agenda challenge potential civil liberties violations? original post asked thought anti-vaxxers US would opposed? 
Don't get wrong, enjoy good trolling much next guy, I'm done. nice day get vaccinated. There's extremely preliminary data suggesting using pfizer booster moderna vaccinated people, vice versa, might produce slightly robust antibody response - read thread [this context

but real answer, IMO, enough data know certainty yet. That's CDC recommended people received MRNA vaccine get booster manufacturer (although *mandate* so, recommend it) are.

We may really understand why, every respiratory pandemic recorded history ended ~2-5 years without vaccines. hope vaccines end faster less illness death, like going go forever without them. whatever reason (probably prior immunity repeated exposure/getting sick/those can't handle dying off), eventually new infections level out.

Drugs show promise make illness disease much less dangerous, get used someone already known infected, unlikely they'll significant impact spread therefore course pandemic. nothing else good experiment see happens vaccinated people about. take likely won‚Äôt change anything rates stay same.

Maybe let's solve current problems first think future? restrictions way gain control situation police union always easy work with. still participate essentials life, like going grocery store work. can't go restaurants, movies, etc. sound reasonable you? think could legally it, suppose would probably require contract renegotiation, probably logistically quite difficult. virus wired think anyone says predict future waves lying. Hungary zero restrictions since June checks whatsoever borders, registration required. Remember full stadium Euro 2020 games. Masking still required. COVID free summer cases started rise like month ago. skyrocketing. idea low cases summer, definitely government measures, high vaccination rates (around 60% now). Old seriously ill people die thousands every flu wave. Nobody introduces society-wide restrictions this. Restricting 83 millions people want vaccinate use booster opportunity coming time impossible.

The old people able get boosters. thing government regards vaccinated deliver boosters many people 60 possible coming months.  natural selection killed reproducing. turd makes turdlets genes turdiness passed on. thought ACA would make difficult.  know unions, like police firemen?  1.7 years in. Time people like stop feigning ignorance. Thank info! Wow really? 73%? that's insane   Well yea, thats thing people like mom. Since retired, watching shitty channels YT eating conspiracy shit serve. believe simple argument 'they work', mind work big wealthy fishes allow paying media blame 'amazing' drugs. Duh, Im tired this. design feature federalism US. individual state departments health issue vaccine requirements tracking features. isn‚Äôt national healthcare network 50+ different healthcare networks. 

So CDC would grab data individual state department. test 25% find cases. 42% increase could partly explained 25% testing. calculation sketchy. 


Edit: 200%? Yeah, Canada, antivaxxers even know restrictions were. saw constant rhetoric restrictions actually place here.  Lmao Random checkpoints make huge amount sense. Universally requiring enter non-essential businesses vulnerable population (the unvaccinated) less exposure risk? Sure.  force people dying, hey rubs wrong way stop guess  slippery slope. Although feel everybody vaccinated, get vaccinated; global society must everything reasonable put end pandemic, must also careful measures. laws rules created adjusted today common good could used inappropriate ways future.  
  
My biggest fear staunchly anti-vax people become radicalized violent. Unfortunately seem exhausted carrot approaches, stick seems necessary. got Bronchitis flu simultaneously years ago. went ER Christmas day. skipped flu shot since üòî  smart ass, vaccine does... quite literally?  sort rhymes. can‚Äôt agree because:

- Hospitalizations deaths function number cases. Knowing case trends helps predict hospitalizations death.

- High case rates lead faster rates mutations, keep track dampen spread necessary. 


- Many can‚Äôt get vaccinated low immunity despite vaccinated, vulnerable. Knowing ambient case rate area lets them, parents, caregivers calculate risk.

- transmission leads breakthrough cases. Knowing community covid-fire useful information vaccinated well.  fate every damn thing moving forward? don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre correct, it‚Äôs typically longer that. 6-8 months, 90% patients studied, according below. saying don‚Äôt get vaccinated, even you‚Äôve covid (hybrid immunity incredibly potent), it‚Äôs anyone favors understate long natural immunity lasts either. 

It also worth noting vaccine immunity tends produce consistent immune response natural immunity well. tend last least 6 months.

Go Fund seems socialist yet . read every comment thread understand less vaccines ending pandemic started.  long anti-intellectualism includes skepticism birth control, it‚Äôs evolutionarily favored.  No, that's correct. thing cancels vaccine getting another covid shot 3-4 weeks later. second shot reverses first. basic science.

All party leaders vaccinated. It‚Äôs simple math problem them. No, doesn‚Äôt. 762k deaths / 160M cases per CDC estimate

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* known fact high incidence even vaccinated people mask up, e.g. guidance CDC. people impression vaccinated dont care anymore. everyone unvaccinated stupid antivaxxer. exclude people whos immune system doesnt work properly, heavy burden hospitals incidence high, cause even vaccinated, need ICU reasons suffer. matter complicated black n white. Europe current example unfortunately happens low vaccination rate indoor activities delta. Obviously measures like using masks everyone seems reasonable putting ""lockdown"" unvaccinated vaccinated freedoms, currently plan germany, depends incidence, hospitalisations etc. vaccinated excluded infection chains albeit play smaller role.

I recommend reading comments here: post known heavily discussed. viral load similar said vaccinated people less often get infected, infected shorter time less often show symptoms. cough obviously transmit viruses.
This study interpreted vaccinated risk unvaccinated mixxed setting unvaccinated tested access. may infected, less likely, still, vaccinated. However vaccinated less likely infect, get infected get severily ill.
EDIT: Forgot add testing still useful. mask mandates there? 

Just trying compare am. OP says ‚Äòfocus‚Äô case data took mean consider it. reasons listed post think would mistake. 


My point case data matters collected made transparent. best policy choices make based data another matter. 

WRT that, you‚Äôre right cases vaccinated people mild stopped tracking wouldn‚Äôt appreciate value boosters. 

‚ÄúAbsolutely tiny‚Äô opinion data feels true great height. 2% people blond, ~.2% Jewish, small children can‚Äôt yet vaccinated. small percent large number large number. 

Again, policy based data separate it. strongly believe need data. What‚Äôs effective practical data say open debate. pharmacy following guidelines. Plus, entitled ask proof medical history. Pick reason. right pry. also possible could get better. rare serious side effects really need research smaller doses risk them.  - Seasonal effects, cases Germany skyrocketed last year around time. 

- Also, recently federal election caretaker government cannot make fundamental decisions. 

- Parents reluctant get kids vaccinated. Corona ripping schools

- East still reeling communisms big minority listen anything state says. 

- Country major transportation traffic hub continental Europe bordering CEE states like Poland Czechia even higher numbers. Austria.

- lockdowns last winter worked means smaller percentage infected say UK. fuel fire season. Europe giving third doses young people, country actually highly vaccinated. indoor season now.  9 yo reaction this, similar rashes show shots. never bother go away own. Good luck him! Might onto something. win everyone  What's even it? Feel poison exiting body dickhole war Christmas people warning decades? means working Lmao Shhh! Don‚Äôt tell Pretty sure entire concept invented anti-vaxer, it‚Äôs taking advantage stupid good   look happened Romania. would absurd say numbers going strongly vaccinations. Yes vaccines limit spread, obviously effect marginal compared things. Google said 3.8 GPA. Unless produce high school transcripts equally ignorant A-A-Ron right now. That's months old. know breakthrough infections Delta - previous variant - similar presymptomatic levels contagiousness unvaccinated infection, resolve much faster.

Get third dose. Definitely safe. Pfizer booster j&amp;j best, especially older people. sinopharm great what's available. This, however, also means non-life saving operations postponed keep last reserve ICU beds. turn means people e.g. suffering cancer, die needed operation comes late. according Wikipedia bio. US, understanding US, pretty much everyone could get booster? wrong?

Some people would fib form. 65 over. 18-65 condition long list (which includes hypertension BMI 25, two like three quarters adults). 22 year olds overweight hypertension exist, technically qualify. think 12-18 also approved, lot 6 months now.

No one checks lie. true August. could go get another first shot. Wow, it‚Äôs like tactics evangelists similar, might even think people behind snake oil scams.  Butte, dummy, Butte. Haha. worked entirety known civilization I've perused 19th-century parish records, include births deaths. sobering see sets records dozen people (including infants) parish died span days bcause scarlet fever something ripped local villages. Don‚Äôt tell them. fact, tell mask two weeks second dose, starve vaccine oxygen kill it. German head state similarly stated ""What else happen take jab?""

It's yet dire, pandemic ripping country like wildfire. Mostly big minority feel entitled get vaccinated, also country federal election couple weeks ago government yet formed. Merkel heading caretaker government expected institute big changes. mother got vaccinated Johnson April read getting booster problem country Johnson (she travelled get vaccine).

Is safe use Sinohparm and/or Pfizer booster ?? (She turned 60)  Got mine OH last week. fall ‚Äúeligible‚Äù criteria, tbh don‚Äôt even remember what, any, questions asked. get booster. Numbers already going area we‚Äôre even Thanksgiving yet. lot folks won‚Äôt even get first shot, let alone booster take care take care of. Shhhh!! tell them. getting vaccinated. CDC quite clear masks even vaccinated incidence higher 50 positive rate you‚Äôve fully resume activities prior pandemic. reduce risk infected Delta variant possibly spreading others, wear mask indoors public area substantial high transmission. areas high substantial incidence Well yeah! last year grocery bill gone around $400ish month (for family 3), easily $600+ per month. Every time need 5 things store swear it‚Äôs $100. fed family processed crap I‚Äôm sure would cheaper. 

What families don‚Äôt financial access fresh vegetables meat? certainly cannot afford $200+ per month grocery bill increase. 

There lot blame rampant obesity, consider holistic circumstances people living poverty US, obesity generally choosing. Depends pharmacy. I‚Äôve seen pharmacists reject boosters people &lt;65 years old. lot type post like call ""the end bell curve"". people much nuanced Anyone paying attention reaching point. I've already decided life ended car accident 5 years ago. Everything decline since. I'm sticking around take care dogs much good energy completely give up. customers want lose. Antivaxxers read start? likely ruled emergency regulations outside authority majority people vaccinated. good economic sense pander largest group. anti vax side dead make even sense. know people breakthrough infections natural infections. It‚Äôs bigger people realize. wish effective giant percentage population either going headlines able comprehend read applies real life. :( Typical. Repubs want ""Healthy"" voters. target vaccine. 
It's totally safe get flu shot, years. lumped Covid anti-vaxers beliefs. 
So, guess fewer Republicans physically go polls vote, mail ballot illegal states! /s sick stand lines, without food water, vote. Fine! got Moderna first 2 shots? get Moderna Pfizer booster? Really interesting see lack long Covid vaccinated individuals. hope data comes aspect significant issue.  existing vaccines pretty effective delta. replicates fast sometimes kicks immune system react, especially antibody levels dropped. would bump down. triaging prioritize emergent first. did, explain would bad me? Specifically? somehow seem obvious it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot good‚Äù? Shop Tesco then. Got it. someone previously infected covid better immunity then?

I read paper, well comment person talking to. understand saying person infected covid would better immunity? explain logic? Superb shoutout equally dumbass fiancee headline enough data statistically significant mean cares. He's celebrity anyone takes medical advice non medical practitioner deserves whatever repercussions come. Idiocy needs stop somehow. Wow, almost missed moving goalpost ‚Äúevery day‚Äù.

You also may want research malaria prevention works. 100%

antivaxxers clearly want healthcare given (which vaccines), deny healthcare let die Haters gonna say flu shot changes voting pattern causality wrong way round. least *some* protection. Natural immunity typically pretty potent. (I‚Äôm arguing NI vaccines though). Fly like always does? Go Brazil!!! Another common misconception conflating ""stomach flu"" actual influenza (the respiratory illness). suspect lot ""just flu"" people too. Ah, old 3-dimensional chess move...  Hell, fine, whatever works.  There's correlation really, Indonesia India disastrous covid infection rate too. Billy Joel song? That‚Äôs partisan now? must missed memo.   I'm sure antivaxxers read.  uae high? Especially compared rest Middle East?   Oftentimes it‚Äôs child, part issue. saying want people‚Äôs kids die, I‚Äôm saying experiencing loss personally makes people continue ignorance stupidity. think want look lottery legalized gambling first concerned that. I'm sure that's right. UK's science advisors think quite possible *eventually* mutate way makes current vaccines obsolete. happened often claim spike protein can't evade immunity still bind ACE2 there's really data back up. many, many different ways bind receptor, colds flu good reinfection.  can't imagine antivaxxers big boycott force UK, nearly 90% eligible people vaccinated, remaining holdouts likely young healthy people feel like need never got around rather committed opposition. 

That said, 1. hilarious, 2. advert really strike something we're going look back 20 years sign DEEPLY weird time was. Thankfully, rabies typically spreads biting, isn‚Äôt particularly effective way spread disease. Luca App garbage. I‚Äôve never used fainted shots count life. got moderna booster. 

People choose fear vaccine need sit chat therapist doctor. It‚Äôs going even higher. predict 100k cases per day soon wish eligible unvaccinated ones faced 100% consequences actions without hurting anyone else, that's Almost certainly within margin error.   killed two cats covid patient feeding apartment great risk‚Ä¶.
Idk, don‚Äôt want say pro Chinese crowd think end justifies means.  [""I Corporate pharmacies like Walgreens, CVS etc turn anyone away unless less 6mo 2nd dose. 'tƒ±s season complete ignorant morons Yes, goes 9000. many realize vaccination rates US gone past weeks, especially mandates children 5-11 vaccinated. vaccination rates high since May. We're averaging 1.5 million shots day now.

The thing countries still surpassing America vaccination rates far higher ours. US would average 3-4 million shots day like back April catch keep rest high vaccinated countries. Go it! went street town's community center got done last week. decided wanted get booster could Friday? felt pretty crappy shots least good go Monday morning. Aside ask doctor, may well enough protected may really want get booster predisposed catching covid, knows. CA NYC followed.

It complete dereliction duty withhold boosters prevention ""mild moderate"" covid, still serious, preventing transmission.

It equity, rubbing right Biden Fauci's face proved independence. seems like even bigger factor given immediately turned around approved 90% population anyway, 10% excluded arbitrary. course mass confusion messaging made seem lot narrow... Bullshit coming people allegedly worried ""message"" antivaxxers naively believed honest saying boosters would make get first shots. Allergies one factor, one. There's immunocompromised people people conditions might make vaccine particularly dangerous well. Homeopathic therapies - common Rogers!   scares me! vaxed, partner not. overweight, diabetic works, refuses jab. stopped begging get causes arguments.ü§∑ CDC FDA always seem chasing leed. pharmacy tech interrogate getting booster. told get pharmacist, looked like wanted murder tech. apologized quickly gave shot.

Tough get good help :) can't legally. Anyone really get one anywhere. real CDC failure. advising universally. Instead, States Cities going rogue CDC issued terrible confusing guidance. \` Stupid thing people blamed Trump CDC getting horribly wrong we're 10 mos Biden administration bad. CDC clue communicate public policy. really ought hire marketing firm point. I'd like see Easter commercial Jesus gets vaccine leaves tomb. would really get anti-vax knickers bunch. Honest question even care case counts anymore? Many cases likely asymptomatic extremely mild person vaxxed. caring hospitalizations deaths. Article even says hospitalizations still much lower before, 4.7 per 100,000 vs Christmas peak 15.5. Pretty much, Biden basicly let them. That's poor leadership. Super protected.  went Rite Aid definitely asking questions. Maybe company policy differs?  main question ""will effective next big variant?"" Guessing this. got booster. 1 year diagnosis. Sense smell weaker across board. taste flavors gone ruined. Still get brain fog, definitely memory issues. see mind, can't find words. Covid taken lightly forget anti-vaxxers. organizing themselves. see terror attacks soon, terrorist experts already warned that. economy crisis remain, making things harder well. Missing health care workers drop next year... I'm taking care family member health problems, I'm really vigilant. One thing pandemic taught careful enough before. thought careful, school age kiddo, germs part parcel person school. kid actually loves remote learning ( way school set up, awesome charter school ) alone minimized germy contact. way schools set US kids go school sick pretty often. tell send kids school sick, also get legal trouble miss many days. Even doctor's note. literally police officer show house daughter long, even though sending school doctor's note every 3 days. invited come catch flu! ridiculous!

I thought crap immune system, I've necessary last several months ( vaccinated, masked, using vivid precautions like wiping things bringing in, hand washing etc.) single cold! I'm pretty excited it, lol. grounds made 10% distinction fucking absurd too.

The primary consideration really seemed sticking Biden Fauci going ahead saying wanted boosters evidence mounting month VRBPAC/FDA dragging feet.

Then monumentally grotesque decision say people denied boosters ""mild"" infections, even though getting knocked ass week plus long covid plus transmission damn good reason allow vaccine safe these.

And ""message"" sent delusional antivaxxers claiming boosters would make get first shots... single internet poll took gospel. completely nonmedical part decision *at all*. global vaccine equity, much drove decisions them. 

It hard watch disgrace confident judgement anything.

Some fucking blatant too... ""This prove independence administration."" Unethical asshole, making decisions spite. think people believe stuff would play Russian Roulette semi-automatic pistol?  feel like hit truck, flu. Got mine IL (Chicago) Friday. questions asked know nobody who's breakthrough infection couple people who've natural infections. anecdotes climb Octogon together. scientist knows vaccines work inbred Facebook believes conspiracy theories, think know qualified talk vaccines, tin foil hat wearing asshat kicks ball living people never understand logic. ten percent available beds still free [in Hesse].

That's misleading. like 90% beds taken covid patients. hospital beds usually taken even normal. actual covid occupancy rate Hesse atm around 15%. arguments bad. moronic point view. absolutely hope would able reason you. nothing could say write would refute, using one many idiotic arguments spewed previous comments.

Yeah, 3 people lot likely contagious.  Please explain then. understand. last winter 0% population vaxed 60% population vaxed, healthcare facilities overwhelmed?    Well yes, also now. time like present search data find it. believe Israel started raising alarms regarding Pfizer's infection late summer. bits data place since well. One think hit Scott G's twitter. days ago link showed breakdown Israel's cases/hospitalizations November 9th. conclusion 2 dose group showing infection around 50-70%. boosted group 95+. difficult say sure month moth, rom remember Moderna showing similar linear regression, higher starting point speak. words Moderna bought durability/time. time I've ever gone emergency room flu mid-20s. went urgent care first dehydrated vomiting even two bags saline, get heart rate down. Ended spending rest day hospital several bags saline bunch really expensive tests. I'm glad ""just flu"" scenario made take Covid even seriously already would have.  got vaccinated. Done me. imposing others.   Agree. fine everyone gets vaccine detox bath. diabolical plan

i love Also, risk compensation. vaccines give protection, people things safer vaccination.  think better. Think logically mathematically... booster, got moderna first two shots. got Pfizer #3. 

My spouse experience next-day symptoms like #2 moderna (chills, muscle aches). little shoulder soreness injection site. 

Anyone similar experience? I'm saying this: impossible healthcare facilities overwhelmed overwhelmed time pandemic nearly 60% population vaccinated. Either people vaccinated hospitalized well. totally support this. want everyone get vaccinated take magic bath. this! go Croatia Johnson &amp; Johnson available there. 1-component vaccine, make 2 trips get fully vaccinated eligible EU Green pass Gotta wonder malicious, narcissistic deity worship think demands protect others deadly virus. think leaders organized religions said vaccine fine, they? loose rules regarding fringe religious groups? agree you, kind of. reason whole thing gone political ""us vs them"" regards vaccine. Things like reinforce it. Aaron Rodgers doesnt take vaccine, media everyone else scream yell, folks hate media run away taking vaccine. stopped planting instances place, might actually help people make decision get vaccine instead ""owning media/libs"". can‚Äôt agree every type vaccine safe &amp; effective

Because wouldn‚Äôt accurate? vaccines *hear about* safe &amp; effective, found approved general population.

There vaccines less effective and/or side effects. rarer diseases given people would actually encounter them: rabies, plague, anthrax, etc. plenty Free Rogerses there. failing giving platform need show people live one another. FYI, ""almost"" vague term, deliberately used. Literally point getting booster. According every statistic essentially zero risk. Isnt needing icu bed highest level emergency, point likely survive gets priority? Normal regulation takes 2 years, look history OSHA Emergency regulations, mostly lost court Really? Almost 100%? Sure that? proof? completely different ball game here. US many times size EU countries. could complete nightmare outbreak NYC things fine North Dakota. tell people ""sorry stay inside serious outbreak thousands miles away"" wish anti-vaxxers would publish definitive list places go.

So issue then? Interesting - I‚Äôm really surprised Germany anti vaxxers (well critical mass them) Maybe lockdown like Austria unvaccinated help. thought may due resistance using astra Zeneca blood clot issue, lag Pfizer/Moderna supplies.  Yea used work D1 University's Basketball team required get flu shots. came gym practice one day told want come back tomorrow go get shot leave today. wonder efficacy original regimen shots let‚Äôs say March year. going see possible winter surge unvaccinated non-boosted? think countries also weighing compliance many shocks system economy take. can't keep flipping lockdown switch down. People tolerate it. Vaccines seen way fully vaccinated, risk COVID-19 equvilent flu (its median age vaccinated hospital around 75). tells unvaccinated almost 100% likely need hospitalization... ad campaign would be.
